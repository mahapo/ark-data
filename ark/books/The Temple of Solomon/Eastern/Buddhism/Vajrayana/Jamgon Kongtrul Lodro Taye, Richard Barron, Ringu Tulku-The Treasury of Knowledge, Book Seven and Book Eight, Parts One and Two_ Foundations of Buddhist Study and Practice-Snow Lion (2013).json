Even the commentary to the source verses is very compact and difficult to translate. Thanks to the ceaseless efforts of dedi­cated translators such as Richard Barron and the generous support of the Tsadra Foundation, we are now extremely fortunate in that the entire work has been translated in a series of volumes.Jamgon Kongtrul the Great incorporates the whole of Tibetan Bud­dhism and its complete system of education and practice into the Treasury o f Knowledge. He shows us how all the works of the “ten pillars of study” and the “eight chariots of practice lineages” are genuine and complete paths with unbroken lineages transmitted by realized beings.1Tibetan Buddhism stands apart from other Buddhist traditions in two main respects. In the first place, it follows the tradition of great Indian Bud­dhist universities like Nalanda and Vikramaslla and encourages the accep­tance, study, and practice of all aspects of the Buddhist teachings, whether those of the sravakayana, bodhisattvayana, or Vajrayana. All schools of Tibetan Buddhism follow the practice of each practitioners observing all three levels of ordination—those of the vinaya, the bodhisattva vow, and Vajrayana. Different stages of view and path are seen as a building of many stories. One may have a better view from the upper floors, but one must get there by way of the lower floors; the building may exist without an upper floor, but it cannot stand without the ground floor. That is why it is seen as very important for one to study all schools and the views of different traditions.The other feature of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is the emphasis on the Buddhist system of logic. Santaraksita and Kamalaslla were great mas­"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ters of logic and reasoning who were instrumental in bringing Buddhism to Tibet, where the use of logical analysis and debate (deriving from the teach­ings of Dignaga and Dharmaklrti) became an important part of Buddhist studies. Provisional truth and definitive truth are defined through analyti­cal investigation; a clear way of reasoning and a reliable method of analysis became very important.This volume of the Treasury o f Knowledge is especially important in that it provides a basis for looking at the whole body of the Buddhist teachings and coming to a deeper understanding, free from fragmented ideas. I would like to congratulate Richard Barron for his excellent translation of this chal- lengingly compact work. This is certainly one of the most important texts to study for a deep and complete understanding of the profound Buddhist path.Ringu Tulku Gangtok January i, 2011viii - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Transla to rs In tr o d u c tio nTliis book is a translation of all of Book 7 and the first two parts of Book 8 from Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye s Treasury o f Knowledge (Sloes bya rndzoa). As such, it deals with two of the three overarching themes of the Treasury. For Kongtrul, the project had begun as a treatment of a theme much discussed throughout the history of the Tibetan tradition, that of the “three levels of ordination” and how these are interrelated. As he began work on the book, however, Kongtrul found his inspiration lay elsewhere:Lama Karma Ngedon had urged me to write a treatise on the three levels of ordination,... [b]ut my feeling was that there were already any number of treatises on this subject, and that if I were to write a treatise it should be more comprehensive in scope, something that would be of use to people who had not studied much. So in the periods between my meditation sessions I had been composing the source verses to my treatise [the Treasury o f Knowledge], a treatise dealing with the three higher trainings.2As Kongtrul noted, the subject of the relationship between the three levels of ordination—the vows of Individual Liberation (Skt. pratimoksa\\ Tib. so sor tbar pa) of the Hlnayana approach of the Buddhist path, the bodhisattva vow of the Mahayana approach, and the tantric samaya of the Vajrayana approach—had already been extensively discussed in a great number of works by masters of all schools of the Tibetan tradition. Indeed, it had been a pivotal issue since at least the eleventh century CE, when the, Bengali master Atlsa came to Tibet. According to accounts in the more recent (Sarma) schools founded in the centuries following his coming, Atlsa found the situation of Buddhism in Tibet to have degenerated since the teachings had first been introduced, beginning in the eighth century,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"and that his activities were part of a “new wave” of Buddhist teachings that were reintroduced from India. It was Atlsa who was credited with estab­lishing the model of the “threefold vajra holder” (Tib. gsum Idan rdo rje dzin pa)—the ideal of a fully ordained monk (the model was also a male- oriented one) who also upheld the bodhisattva vow and tantric samaya.To be fair, the more ancient tradition of the Nyingma (which came under criticism from this Sarma perspective for having allowed such “degenera­tion” to occur) has maintained that it was due only to lay practitioners, who upheld the pure teachings, having “gone underground” during the persecutions of the king Langdarma (in the mid-tenth century CE) that the original Buddhist teachings introduced during the “earlier spread” (Tib. snga dar) were able to survive and flourish, revitalized but not replaced by the “later spread” (Tib. phyi dar) from the eleventh century onward. The historical circumstances help to explain the important role played by lay masters as holders of Nyingma lineages, as compared to the predominantly monastic presence in the lineages of the Sarma schools. This is not to sug­gest that the Nyingmapas placed no emphasis on the Buddhist monastic tradition; indeed, the major Nyingma monasteries historically have been centers noted for the purity of the discipline upheld there, and many of the greatest Nyingma teachers, including Longchen Rabjam (1308-1364) and Mipam Rinpoché (1846-1911), were fully ordained monks. But the fact that Langdarma focused his oppressive efforts on monastic institutions and their inhabitants would have made it easier for a lay community of prac­titioners to escape notice and avoid persecution, and the need to rely on this tactic would have developed over time into an integral model for the tradition.In any event, although Kongtrul did treat this theme of the interrela­tionship between the three levels of ordination in Book 5 of the Treasury o f Knowledge, he expanded the structure of the work to encompass the three “higher trainings”—those of ethical discipline (Skt. sila\\ Tib. tshul khrims), meditative stability (Skt. dhyana\\ Tib. bsamgtan), and sublime intelligence {Skz. prajñá\\ Tib. shes rab)—as well as ancillary topics, resulting in a monu­mental work that covers virtually the entire range of learning available in the Tibetan religious tradition during Kongtrul s lifetime.In the parts of Books 7 and 8 translated in this volume, Kongtrul presents a number of models that can be used as tools to come to a precise and accu­rate understanding of the meaning and value of the Buddhist teachings. What emerges from these discussions is a sense of the teachings as a body ofZ - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"t r a n s l a t o r ’s i n t r o d u c t i o n- 3knowledge to be evaluated and examined in light of one s personal experi­ence rather than a static list of facts to be memorized or accepted without question.It might be useful to reiterate the overall structure of the Treasury o f Knowledge at this point. To cite from Kongtruls autobiography:The first of the Five Treasuries is The Encompassing o f the Know- able? This begins with an introductory section—the part that is “positive at the outset.” It discusses the title of the work, as well as the formal verses of homage and my statement of intent as the author.4The main body of the work—the part that is “positive in the interim”—comprises ten major sections. These discuss the fol­lowing topics:► the universe as the field in which beings are guided spiri­tually5► the Buddha as the teacher who guided them► the cycles of the Buddhist teachings that are the means of guidance► the ways in which these teachings spread in India and Tibet6► the three levels of ethical discipline that serve as the foundation of spiritual practice7► a detailed analysis of the study undertaken at the outset of the spiritual path8► a detailed analysis of contemplation as the intermediate phase► a detailed analysis of meditation as the final outcome9► the paths and levels that are traversed through these last three processes, and► the eventual way in which the fruition is gained.10Each of these ten sections has four subsections. Through these discussions, one can also come indirectly to understand the Hinayana, the Mahayana, and the special enlightened in­tent underlying the Early Translation Schools approach of the vajra pinnacle of utter lucidity. To summarize these sections, the fifth deals with the higher training of ethical discipline, the sixth and seventh with that of wisdom, and the eighth with that of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEmeditative stability; thus they constitute the core of the work, while the rest of the sections deal with secondary topics that are the causes or results of these higher trainings.The conclusion—the part that is “positive in the outcome”— brings the work to its completion by discussing the nature and value of the treatise and the way it was composed; as well, this part contains prayers of aspiration and benediction.The source verses, the summary and overview, and the line-by- line commentary comprise three volumes.\"Thus, Book $ of the Treasury o f Knowledge is Kongtruls primary treat­ment of the first training. It is in Books 6 and 7 that Kongtrul turns his attention to the higher training in sublime intelligence, which, in the Bud­dhist context, is developed in three successive steps. The first of these is that of studying the teachings—literally, “hearing” them because of the empha­sis on receiving the teachings from a living teacher (who can clarify difficult points and correct ones misunderstandings) rather than merely reading texts on one s own. The next step is that of contemplation, which consists of reflecting over and over on the points one has already understood with certainty in the previous step. The point here is to deepen one s appreciation of what has been initially understood, so that it begins to affect one s lived experience and does not remain merely intellectual knowledge. There is a .saying in the Tibetan tradition that the first level of understanding is like a patch applied over a hole in one s garment, which will fall off eventually, for just as the patch remains an overlay on the cloth, this kind of understanding remains “on the surface” and does not penetrate into one. However valuable it is at the outset to provide one with a framework, intellectual understand­ing alone will not significantly affect one s direct experience or deal with one s suffering in the final analysis. That final step occurs when one applies what one has become completely certain about through contemplation in the process of meditation, in which the understanding merges completely with ones experience and edifies it to the level of realization; this is the main focus of Book 8.Whereas in Book 6 Kongtrul presented his summation of the fields of knowledge to be “heard,”12 in Book 7 he takes the theme of higher training in sublime intelligence to the next level, including that of contemplation as well as hearing. In his own verse summary to the Treasury o f Knowledge, Kongtrul describes Book 7 in the following words:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"t r a n s l a t o r ’s i n t r o d u c t i o nThe seventh book discusses how sublime intelligence develops through hearing the teachings: the four keys of understanding for evaluating the teachings; the topics to be evaluated (the two levels of provisional and definitive truth and the phenomena of interdependent origination); the view of the lack of identity in things, which is crucial to all approaches in general; and the four contemplations that turn the mind, providing the foundation for meditative discipline.13And in his introduction to the commentary to the source verses of Book 7 (included in the present volume), he notes:Whatever teachings you have heard concerning general objects of knowledge, and profound and extensive topics in particular, it is necessary for you to come to a complete certainty about the significance of all this through conceptualization and investiga­tion; hence, Book 7 concerns the stages of contemplation.The first part of Book 7 is devoted to a discussion of what Kongtrul lit­erally refers to as “keys” (Tib. Ide mig), in that they help one to unlock the deeper significance of the knowledge one has gained through initially hear­ing the teachings. These keys are to be used in contemplation, in order to evaluate further what one has learned. It is clear from this presentation that what is meant by “contemplation” is an introspective process of working with understanding that is gained intellectually in a personally meaningful way rather than mere rote repetition of a set of facts for the purposes of memorizing them. As Kongtrul himself puts it in his commentary to Book 7, Part 1:It is when you examine each and every word and its meaning, bringing numerous scriptural citations and kinds of reasoning to bear on these, that you authentically arouse in yourself an aware­ness that entails certainty on a very fundamental level.These keys that one uses as tools to understand the teachings are of two kinds, the more ordinary and the extraordinary. Kongtrul discusses the more ordinary tools under four headings: provisional vis-a-vis definitive"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"meaning; direct vis-à-vis indirect intention; the “four reliances”; and the four logical principles.The question of which of the Buddhas teachings can be taken as pro­visional and which are to be understood as definitive statements has been and continues to be a controversial topic that historically has placed entire schools of thought at loggerheads. What is at issue is the fact that the Buddha, who encouraged serious critical thought in his followers, did not intend that every statement he made simply be accepted blindly. But decisions concerning which of those statements are provisional and which definitive are not individual decisions based on personal prejudice or on a concern to render the teachings “politically correct” with respect to current fashion. The term that is rendered here as “provisional” (Skt. neydrtha; Tib. drang don) refers to a meaning that, while not to be taken literally, never­theless leads or guides one to a more complete understanding. It consists of teachings that concern things that are, in Kongtruls words, “well known in one s ordinary perception.” While such teachings are not descriptions of what is ultimately true, they are usefulas means to gain access to the fundamentally unconditioned nature of reality [and] are evaluated in categories that can be described, imagined, and expressed, and are presented through the use of some conceptual overlay. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part i)In contrast to this is what is definitive in meaning (Skt. nïtàrtha; Tib. nges don) y which consists of teachingsthat discuss the significance of the fundamentally unconditioned way in which things abide (which is utterly lucid by nature, be­yond all describing, imagining, or expressing). (Kongtruls com­mentary to Book 7, Part i)The next key is that of the principle of “intention,” which is used in this work to translate the term that Professor D. Seyfort Ruegghas described as follows:The Tibetan word dgons pa is an honorific and is used to trans­late Skt. abhiprdya when the “intention” of an honoured, recog­nized and authoritative speaker or author such as the Buddha is6 — THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"being referred to. Abhiprdya may be translated into Tibetan also by the (non-honorific) word bsam pa, which also renders bhdva “meaning,” as well as dsaya “proclivity, disposition.”14Intention is a factor that allows for certain of the Buddhas teachings (and those of the commentators thereon) to be interpreted rather than taken literally. As in the case of provisional vis-à-vis definitive meaning, however, there are precise criteria for when such interpretation is required. An understanding of the role of intention in the teachings permits one to view them from a larger perspective rather than assigning the same weight to every statement. If taken exclusively at face value, the Buddhist teach­ings can seem filled with internal contradictions or “magical thinking,” but an understanding of the intentions underlying various teachings serves to resolve such problems. Kongtrul cites the example of the statement, “By simply recalling the name of the tathâgata Vimalacandraprabha, you will attain buddhahood.” Taken at face value, this pronouncement seems sim­plistic in the extreme, unless one understands that the intention here is one that is “concerned with eventualities,” and that while the attainment of buddhahood will not come solely or immediately from one s recalling the name of a given buddha, that act of recollection can be seen as setting in motion a process of spiritual development that will, in fact, eventually lead to ones attainment of buddhahood. Seen in this light, the statement is not robbed of its inspiring and evocative power but is nevertheless put into a more meaningful context.Kongtrul highlights the traditional distinction between “direct intention” (Skt. abhiprdya; Tib. dgongs pa) and indirect intention (Skt. abhisamdhi; Tib. Idem por dgongs pa). He cites from an Indian work by Asvabhâva (see note 75, this volume), which gives the following explanation:Direct intention simply plants the idea in the mind; [3.115a] it is not asserted to depend on the other persons absorbing it;15 indi­rect intention depends on the other persons absorbing it.He also cites from the writings of the fourteenth-century Nyingma master Longchen Rabjam, who notes that while a statement of indirect intention is especially not to be taken literally and is geared to the level of understanding on the listener s part, it is nevertheless a valid statement, “falling shy of being a falsehood” (as Longchenpa puts it).t r a n sl a t o r’s INTRODUCTION - 7"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEKongtrul then turns his attention to a well-known theme in the Bud­dhist teachings, the “four reliances.” These can be summarized as follows:(i) to rely on the meaning of a teaching as conveyed by the words, not the words themselves;(i) to rely on the teachings, not the individual who teaches them;(3) to rely on timeless awareness, not the ordinary state of dualistic con­sciousness; and(4) to rely on the definitive meaning found in the teachings, not the merely provisional one.In each case, however, the issue is one of emphasis. While the meaning is of more importance than the words used to convey it, Kongtrul is not advocating a lack of concern for accuracy in the language and terminology used to frame the teachings, only that being overly concerned with these is a distraction from the more crucial factor, that of the message itselfIn a similar vein, in relying on the teachings rather than the individual, the following quote (attributed to the Buddha) is often cited by Buddhist authors:Like someone smelting, cutting, and polishing gold, my monks and wise peopleshould accept my words once they have examined them well, and not simply out of respect for me.Early indications of this spirit of free inquiry are found in the Pali canon of the Theravada school; for example, in the Kalama Sutta we read the fol­lowing:Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumour; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon spe­cious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another’s seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, “The monk is our teacher.”Kalamas, when you yourselves know: “These things are bad; these things are blamable; these things are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill,” abandon them."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"t r a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n- 9Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another’s seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, “The monk is our teacher.” Kalamas, when you yourselves know: “These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness,” enter on and abide in them.16Granted, the sutra just cited purports to be a record of the Buddha’s advice to a tribe of people who had apparently been exposed to other religious teachers who were somewhat fanatical and intolerant in their attempts to convert the Kalamas. But such quotations are often mistakenly supposed to be encouragements for one to simply take what appeals to one from the Buddha’s teachings and ignore or edit out what does not.In relying on the teachings rather than the individual, the point is not that one should discount the indispensable role of living teachers, for to take this instruction too literally would be to relegate the study and practice of Bud­dhism to an intellectual exercise derived from the mere reading of books. Particularly in the Vajrayana tradition in which Kongtrul was steeped, devotion to one’s gurus is crucial to one s spiritual progress and accounts in part for the efficacy of this approach. Rather, the cautionary note offered here is to guard against a healthy and necessary respect for teachers devolv­ing into some form of personality cult. When too much emphasis is placed on the individual personality of the teacher, what masquerades as devotion can in fact be more of an emotionally biased attachment on the part of the student for the teacher, something that could actually interfere with spiri­tual progress if it is an expression of the student s unresolved personal issues. The function of the teacher is not to replace the sources of refuge or the teachings but to serve as the conduit through which the student can gain access to these and become liberated thereby. As well, too much reliance on the individual teacher as an individual can leave the student feeling bereft and without any further support when the teacher (inevitably) dies.The emphasis on timeless awareness, as distinct from more ordinary states of consciousness, is again one of keeping the ultimate goal in perspective. There can be a tendency for this point to be misunderstood and interpreted"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"to mean that conceptual thought per se is suspect, if not downright harmful to an individuals spiritual development. As important as it is to transcend the limitations of dualistic and conceptual thinking, it is that very thinking process that serves as one s most useful tool in overcoming confusion and developing the precision and clarity of thought that in the final analysis allows one s mind to make that leâp. If for no other reason, the fact that the vast majority of the material covered in the Treasury o f Knowledge could be considered widiin the scope of “ordinary consciousness” should argue for the vital role played by our rational thought processes. What really comes under Kongtruls scrutiny as “ordinary consciousness” is thinking that rein­forces the limiting effect of one s intellectual and emotional biases.Finally, Kongtrul revisits the theme of definitive and provisional mean­ing as the fourth of these reliances. The latter he defines as pertaining tothose teachings that arouse a sense of disenchantment with samsara; that deal with the will to be free as defined in the vari­ous spiritual approaches; that present things in terms of substan­tial versus nominal existence, or as “mind only,” or as an empty state of nothingness—these are provisional teachings that are presented as temporary expedients, and so one should not rely on them. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part 1)But again, to “not rely” on such teachings means not to hold them to be concerned with what is ultimately meaningful—that is, not to lose sight of the perspective of what is useful in the shorter term vis-à-vis what is truly the case in the most authentic sense:The definitive meaning is found in those teachings that go far beyond one s immediate perceptions, or intellectual speculation, or the scope of ¿râvakas and pratyekabuddhas; and that deal with profound and vast topics that fall within the scope of those of the very highest acumen, which is inconceivable to our ordi­nary way of thinking. It is this meaning that one should rely on. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part 1)Kongtrul next turns his attention to four principles that provide a logi­cal consistency to our experience of phenomena on the relative level. I have chosen to translate the Tibetan term rigs pa here as “logical principle” ratherIO - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"tr a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n— IIthan “reason(ing)” (which is another quite valid translation) because of Kongtruls own gloss that the term in this context refers not so much to the sense of a human process of thought as to what underlies our experience and proves to be logically the case when we investigate how things mani­fest in our perceptions.17 An understanding of these principles is an integral component in one’s being able to interpret one s conventional experiences in ways that contribute to one s spiritual development and ultimate libera­tion rather than merely reinforcing one s confusion and erroneous thinking.The model of two levels of truth is found throughout Buddhist teach­ings on the Mahayana level and higher, and while it is true enough to say that “the ultimate level of truth is that of emptiness, while the relative level is that of interdependent connection,” both of these levels can be explored and understood with great detail and accuracy through the application of such principles as the four discussed at this point.Thus, things as we ordinarily experience them exhibit a predictability and a logical consistency that are borne out in several ways: their occurrence in relationships in which they are dependent on one another; the functions they perform in our experience of the phenomenal world; the relationships between them that we can infer, perceive directly, or rely on scripture to validate; and the natures they exhibit. The Tibetan term chos nyid (here translated as “the nature of things”) in this context does not refer, as it does elsewhere, to the true nature of all phenomena as emptiness, but to what things individually exhibit as their respective natures—“for water to be wet, for fire to be hot,” as Kongtrul says.In addition to the more “ordinary” keys to understanding the Buddhist teachings, Kongtrul discusses tools that are crucial to a correct interpreta­tion of the tan trie teachings of the Vajrayana approach, referred to as the “six parameters” (Tib. mtha drug) and “four modes” (Tib. tshul bzhi). The parameters concerning provisional vis-a-vis definitive meaning were dis­cussed previously but are here presented in light of their role in promoting an understanding of the more esoteric teachings of Buddhism. Similarly, the category of interpretation (which is to say, those explanations of the teachings that require interpretation versus those that do not) is a recasting of the theme of “intention” that was discussed earlier in Part i of Book 7. In addition, words and phrases found in the tantras can be seen in the light of what can be taken literally and what needs to be interpreted, lest too literal a reading actually bring one to a totally erroneous conclusion.Hand in hand with these parameters come the four modes, which are"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"multiple levels of meaning that pertain to any significant term in a Vajrayana context. The literal meaning is defined by Kongtrul as the mere reading of a passage word-by-word, using the “dictionary meaning” of the words and treating the language as one would ordinary grammatical sentences. While there are tantric teachings that can be understood literally as given, to treat all such texts in this way can and does give rise to potentially enormous misunderstandings as to their actual intended meaning.In addition to their literal meaning, words and terms used in the tantric context can have “shared” (or “universal”) meaning, which Kongtrul defines as the meaning that “alleviates misgivings.” Such misgivings can arise when one does not have the correct perspective on the various approaches within the Buddhist framework and how these approaches support and integrate with one another. Kongtrul notes that one might feel that the approach one was following was not advanced enough and that one was selling oneself short in not following a higher approach. But the efficacy of any approach is dependent on the acumen with which practitioners apply themselves to it rather than it necessarily being the case that “higher is always bet­ter.” Alternatively, someone following a so-called higher approach might feel resistance to accepting its principles due to a shortcoming in his or her understanding of the underlying purpose and perspective of that approach and its methods. Yet another aspect of shared meaning lies in that fact that in the particular case of the two stages of tantric meditation—that of devel­opment (Skt. utpattikrama\\ Tib. bskyed rim) and that of completion (Skt. sampannakrama\\ Tib. rdzogs rim)—there are themes that are common to (that is, “shared by”) both stages and that form the bridge from the former to the latter.The mode of hidden meaning refers to topics discussed in the tantric teachings that are not appropriate for too public a revelation. Such top­ics are those that relate to the roles that sex and power play in Vajrayana practice (which is for the most part far less than many people s imagina­tions would have it), and the problem lies not in there being any “dirty little secret” to be kept hidden but in the enormous potential for an unreceptive mind to misinterpret and distort the intended message. The late Herbert V. Guenther, one of the foremost Western interpreters of the Vajrayana teach­ings, noted the following:The term tantra, from the time of its first appearance in the Westup to the present day, has been subject to serious misunderstand-12. - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"t r a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n- 13ings. The term w^s introduced into the English language in 1799 when tantric works were discovered by missionaries in India. These were not Buddhist works. In fact at that time it was hardly known in the West that such a thing as Buddhism existed. The term tantra was then known only as the title of these works, the contents of which were quite different from what people expect­ed in books dealing with philosophy and religion. The mission­aries were for the most part quite shocked that other people had religious and philosophical ideas so different from their own.To them the word tantra meant no more than these expanded treatises; but since the subject matter dealt with in these treatises was so unusual from their point of view, the term began to ac­quire quite a peculiar connotation, a connotation which proper study of the texts has not borne out. Unfortunately, in this case as in so many others, once a false conception has been formed, a nearly superhuman effort is required to root out and set right all the wrong ideas and odd connotations that have grown up around it.18The problem that can arise when what is couched in hidden meaning is made too public can be either one of rejection (as in the case of the mission­aries mentioned above) or of a misconception that these issues are far more central to Vajrayana than is the case. Elsewhere in his writings, Guenther notes that because the subject matter of the tantras does deal with sex and power, these teachings can become a source of counterproductive fascina­tion for people who are obsessed with either of these, and especially those who are obsessed with both.Finally, there is the mode of consummate meaning, in which the impli­cations of the words and terms used refer directly to the ultimate nature of reality and to the fruition state of enlightenment that constitutes the direct realization of that nature.Kongtrul notes that any or all of these modes can apply to even a single “vajra word” and that they are geared to the various levels of acumen in the minds of those reading or hearing such words; hence the need for the appropriate meaning or meanings to be understood in every context. An appreciation of these multiple levels of meaning clearly demonstrates that any translation of a tantric source will of necessity be severely limited and will require extensive commentary to bring out the actual intent of the text."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"At the conclusion of Part i of Book 7, Kongtrul summarizes the impor­tance of the foregoing keys to understanding as follows:Lacking these foregoing keynote instructions, no matter how meticulous ones thinking and mental investigation, one will not be capable of developing an authentic state of sublime intel­ligence; whereas in having access to them, if one applies them to the techniques employed in the sütras and tantras, this will arouse in one the flawless sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation.Part i of Book 7 covers several crucial themes, the first being that of pro­visional vis-à-vis definitive meaning as these apply to the three cycles of the Buddhas teachings (the three “turnings of the wheel of the dharma”). The standard Mahàyâna model for categorizing the Buddhas teachings divides them according to three periods in his career as a teacher. Elsewhere in the Treasury o f Knowledge, Kongtrul refers to this model:When scriptural transmissions are classified, the wheel of Dhar­ma has three cycles: this is widely known and accepted among followers of the great way.The first doctrine the Buddha taught is the scriptural trans­mission of the four truths; the middle one, the scriptural trans­mission concerning the absence of characteristics; and the final one, the scriptural transmission of accurate discernment. The Discourse Requested by PowerfulKingofDharanis states:Aware of the dispositions of thoroughly impure sentient beings, the Transcendent Buddhas speeches on imperma­nence, suffering, absence of self, and undesirability [of the wheel of life] provoked disillusionment in sentient beings enthralled with the wheel of life—those beings entered ex­alted beings’ spiritual discipline.The Transcendent Buddhas diligence did not end with merely that; his later accounts of emptiness, absence of in­herent characteristics, and lack of aspiration allowed sentient beings to comprehend the nature of transcendent buddhas.The Transcendent Buddhas diligence did not end with14 ^ t h e TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"t r a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n- 15merely that; his later accounts of the irreversible wheel of Dharma and of complete threefold purity [of act, agent, and object] placed beings within the transcendent bud- dhas’ domain.As stated, the Buddhas initial talks of disillusionment given to those attached to the wheel of life compelled them to enter the path of peace. Then, talks on emptiness brought them to spiritual maturity in the great way. Then, talks on the irreversible wheel had them enter the transcendent buddhas’ domain and receive outstanding prophecies [of awakening].19The writings of the fourteenth-century Nyingma master Longchen Rab- jam were important sources for Kongtrul in composing the Treasury o f Knowledge. In his Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, Longchenpa gives the following treatment of the three turnings of the wheel of dharma:According to the well-known interpretation of the ordinary Mahayana, in the excellent place of Varanasi, on excellent oc­casions, the excellent teacher Shakyamuni spoke to an excellent retinue made up of the five noble ones and eighty thousand gods, teaching the excellent dharma—the first cycle of the Buddhas words, the various teachings pertaining to the four truths; this he did between the ages of thirty-six and forty-two. He began by teaching principally the training in discipline, what came to be known as the compilation of Vinaya. The ethical codes of Vina- ya contain extensive overviews that classify actions according to their nature or their relation to formal precepts. The discourses of Vinaya concern the stages of meditative absorption and the celibate way of life undertaken in yogic practice. The further teachings of Vinaya give extensive, detailed explanations and analyses of these topics.Then, at the excellent place of Vulture Peak, the excellent teacher Shakyamuni spoke to several excellent retinues. Among the four relatively ordinary retinues were about five thousand ar- hats, including Shariputra and Maudgalyayana; about five hun­dred nuns, including Shakyamunis stepmother, Prajapati; and groups of laypeople, including the householder Anathapindika"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and the laywoman Sagama. As well, there were enormous num­bers of gods, nagas, demigods, andgandharvas. The extraordinary retinue was made up of an enormous number of bodhisattvas— including Bhadrapala, Ratnasambhava, andjaladatta—who had truly attained great levels of realization. On excellent occasions, he taught these retinues the excellent dharma—the intermedi­ate cycle of the Buddhas words, the various teachings pertain­ing to the characterization of phenomena as nonexistent; this he did between the ages of forty-three and seventy-two. He taught principally the training in mind, what came to be known as the compilation of Sutra. The ethical codes of Sutra classify the precepts of the bodhisattva vow. The discourses of Sutra dis­cuss meditative absorption in profound and extensive ways. The further teachings of Sutra analyze related topics—spiritual levels and paths, powers of recall, and meditative absorption—in great detail.Then, in excellent places—not any one place—such as the human world and the abodes of gods and nagas, on excellent oc­casions, the excellent teacher Shakyamuni spoke to an excellent retinue of innumerable monks, nuns, gods, nagas, bodhisattvas, and others, teaching the excellent dharma—the final cycle of the Buddhas words, the various teachings pertaining to defini­tive truth; this he did between the ages of seventy-three and eighty-two. He taught principally the training in sublime know­ing, what came to be known as the compilation of Abhidharma. The ethical codes of Abhidharma have to do with taming the afflictive states in ways that are easy to implement and involve little hardship. The discourses of Abhidharma discuss the vast range of techniques for engaging in the experience of suchness. The further teachings of Abhidharma analyze in great detail the mind-body aggregates, the fields of experience, the components of perception, the controlling factors, consciousness, and tatha- gatagarbha (the innately, totally pure “buddha nature”) and dis­cuss related topics.2016 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEOf great importance is the issue of which among these teachings may be considered provisional in meaning (and hence open to interpretation, albeit according to a judicious process and not mere personal whims or"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"t r a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n- 17preferences) and which should be taken as definitive statements that were not intended to be subjected to any interpretation at all. This classification of teachings into what is provisional and what is ultimate is based on state­ments found in such sutras as the Definitive Commentary' on Enlightened Intent and the Discourse Requested by Dhdranisvarardja. Here Kongtrul presents several alternative models of the three cycles of the Buddhas teach­ings and offers his definition of a sutra whose content is that of provisional meaning:[It is] a sutra that principally teaches on the relative level of truth, which serves as a means to ensure that the path to the definitive' state of excellence can arise in the experience of those who are to be guided along any of the three spiritual approaches. (Kong- trul’s commentary to Book 7, Part 2)By contrast, a sutra whose content is one of definitive meaning is[one] that principally teaches on the ultimate level of truth, so that the few to be guided who can patiently accept its profound meaning can attain nirvana that is not defined by extremes, by meditating on the path to definitive excellence. (Kongtruls com­mentary to Book 7, Part 2)While this may seem at first to be a relatively straightforward set of cri­teria, an ongoing controversy throughout the history of the Tibetan Bud­dhist tradition has focused on this very issue. Although (as Kongtrul notes) all schools of Mahayana thought consider the first cycle of the Buddhas teachings to be provisional in meaning (“primarily concerned with what is relatively valid”), when it comes to making distinctions between the inter­mediate and the final cycles, he notes that there is less consensus, at one point stating quite bluntly thatit would seem that—due to a failure to examine accurately the meaning of the underlying intent of this source [the Discourse Requested by Dhdranishvarardja]—there have occurred cases of Tibetan teachers indulging in a lot of nonsense concerning two cycles (that is, the intermediate and the final), as to which is provisional and which definitive, and which is “higher” or"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"“lower” than the other. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7,Part 2)Kongtrul presents alternative opinions concerning the intermediate and final cycles: that of the “proponents of things having no finite essence” (that is, the proponents of unqualified emptiness [rang stong], a reference in part to the majority of those in the Gelukpa school of Tibetan Buddhism); that of the “yogic practitioners” (that is, the proponents of what became the basis for the view of qualified emptiness [gzhan stong]); and that of Nagarjuna and his followers. He then argues in favor of his own conclusion thatthe intermediate and final cycles of teaching are equally defini­tive in meaning, with the distinction that the former concerns the definitive meaning that puts an end to conceptual elabora­tions in the shorter term, while the latter concerns that which reveals the true way of abiding in the far-reaching sense. (Kong- truls commentary to Book 7, Part 2)He finishes this discussion by noting that no aspect of the Buddhas teachings, however provisional in nature, should be considered false, for all such aspects partake of a single underlying intent, being simply more obvi­ous or more subtle means to eliminate erroneous concepts and realize the ultimate nature of things. He urges his readers not to fall prey to sectarian biases, an issue that deeply concerned Kongtrul throughout his entire life:This being the case, to boast, “I am a follower of the Middle Way!” could be a case of one s implicitly denigrating other aspects of the Buddhas sublime words; and to claim, “I am a tantric practition­er!” could be a case of ones dismissing the repositories of teach­ings in the sravaka approach and so forth as though these were useless straw.... Therefore, one should examine and investigate the possibility of one s rejecting the Buddhadharma and exercise caution! (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part 2)Kongtrul concludes this section on a touching note of concern: his wish that people not become embroiled in the sectarian controversies that have plagued Tibetan Buddhism throughout its history:l8 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"t r a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n- 19It is for this reason that the venerable Maitreya emphatically ad­vises one not to misinterpret the tradition of the Sage, which was established by the Buddha himself. With folded hands, I beseech all to respect this. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part 2.)The next section of part 2, is concerned with the two levels of truth, rela­tive and ultimate. This Mahayana model is found in the source sutras (the Reunion o f Father and Son, for example) and is based on the experiential criteria that distinguish what is nominally valid from the perspective of an ordinary being (one who, by definition, is perceiving within a state of con­fusion) from what a spiritually advanced being perceives while engaged in meditative equipoise. After a comprehensive discussion of the terms used to refer to these levels of truth, Kongtrul analyzes them in detail, outlining the stances taken by the various schools of Buddhist philosophy, including that of the tantras. He then concludes with some remarks on the value of one s understanding these two levels of truth, reminding us that none of what he is presenting in this book is meant to remain theoretical but is to be applied to our own experience in ways that contribute to spiritual liberation and enlightenment.The final topic of the second part of Book 7 is that of the process of interdependent connection (Skz.pratityasamutpada\\ Tib. rten cing ’brel bar 1byung ba), a principle that is held to lie at the very core of the Buddhas teachings. This process is usually described from the point of view of how it is involved in the perpetuation of samsara (“the usual progression,” as Kongtrul notes), but in addition to discussing it as such on both the exter­nal and internal levels, Kongtrul here explores more profound aspects of interdependent connection, seen in light of the true nature of phenomena and the state of nirvana (“the reversal of the usual progression”).In Part 3 of Book 7, Kongtrul provides an exhaustive inquiry into what he terms “authentic view,” which he describes as the “principal factor” in the individuals search for liberation and enlightenment. Having established the necessity of cultivating such a view, he discusses the development pf a sublime degree of intelligence (Ski. prajnd; Tib. shes rab\\ specifically that which brings one realization of the lack of any real identity in any phenom­enon or in the individual sense of selfhood, the nonrealization of which, from the Mahayana Buddhist point of view, constitutes the fundamental distortion of reality and one s major stumbling block on the path to libera­tion and enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"20 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEKongtrul then turns his attention to the four axioms of the Buddhist teachings. These are not seen as some form of dogmatic creed that one must believe in order to be a Buddhist but more as basic truths about the nature of reality that one can convince oneself of through contemplating their meaning. A certainty concerning these axiomatic truths constitutes the foundation on which one can begin to develop authentic view by fol­lowing what Kongtrul refers to as “the path that avoids dualistic extremes.” These extremes are those of naïve realism, in which one assumes that things exist as they seem to from one s limited and confused perspective, and nihilistic denial, in which one denies the validity or meaning of any­thing and everything. These extremes are also referred to as overstatement (assuming that what is not the case is, in fact, the case) and understatement (assuming that what is the case is, in fact, not the case). In this section Kongtrul is intent on defining more precisely the famous “middle way” of Buddhism:In general, proponents of all philosophical systems, both Bud­dhist and non-Buddhist, presume that they are espousing a “middle way,” refuting dualistic extremes in light of their own understanding of what this means. This is because they hold that they profess, according to their own systems, a middle way that avoids two extremes—although lower approaches, in ex­aggerating what does not exist as existing, incur the extreme of naïve affirmation, while relatively higher approaches, in denying what exists as not existing, incur the extreme of nihilistic denial. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part 3)He discusses the lower schools of Buddhist philosophy to point out the limitations in their approach and then focuses on the Middle Way tradi­tion (Skt. madhyamaka\\ Tib. dbu ma) in particular. Kongtrul begins by identifying what is implied by the crucial term “emptiness”—so often mis­understood both in historically Buddhist cultures and the modern West that some translators feel that more interpretive translations of the San­skrit term sünyatâ (Tib. stongpa nyid) are called for. He then delineates the understanding of this from the perspectives of both unqualified emptiness (Tib. rang stong, “self-empty”) and qualified emptiness (Tib. gzhan stong, “other-empty”), a distinction that did not exist as such in India but that became highly controversial in Tibet, especially after the Jonang master"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen codified the interpretation of qualified empti­ness in the fourteenth century.However, Kongtruls purpose—in the present discussion, at any rate— is neither to engage in that controversy nor to decide it but to expose his readers to the fact that distinct interpretations exist. He quickly moves on to a trenchant treatment of the two aspects of identity, that of phenomena and that of the individual, as the primary targets on which to direct the weapon of one s intelligence. He discusses each aspect in turn, presenting the points of view of various philosophical schools, and then concludes with advice on integrating the two mainstream traditions of the Middle Way from India—those of Nagarjuna and Asanga—which were the precur­sors of the interpretations in Tibet of unqualified and qualified emptiness, respectively. Rather than see the situation as one of a correct interpretation versus an incorrect one, Kongtrul states the following:Although there is no question of any hierarchy of higher or lower between [Nagarjunas and Asangas] enlightened intentions, the fact that there may seem to be one is due solely to one s lack of good fortune and to one s highly restricted intelligence.That being the case, once one has understood the distinct ap­proaches found in the sources of the two masters who codified these mainstream traditions, if one can integrate these through realizing that the enlightened intent of both is, in the final analy­sis, one and the same—the meaning of the Middle Way—one is freed from the many flaws of misinterpreted suppositions or denials. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part 3)In his discussion of view, Kongtrul also examines how these interpreta­tions of emptiness from the sutra tradition are cast from the perspective of the mantra approach, or Vajrayana. His general discussion of these points is followed by a reference to the writings of the sixth Zhamar incarnation of the Kagyii school, Gargyi Wangpo Chokyi Wangchuk, who lived from 158410 1630.1 have been able to locate only two short works by this master, neither of which concern the topic discussed here; given the special men­tion Kongtrul makes of the sixth Zhamar s interpretation of tantra in this context, it is to be hoped that more of his writings will become available in the future.Finally, Kongtrul concludes Part 3 of Book 7 with a brief summation oft r a n sl a t o r’s INTRODUCTION - 21"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"the view of “unborn primordial unity” (Tib. skye med zung ’jug)> in which he succinctly sets forth the view that integrates the approaches of unquali­fied and qualified emptiness discussed previously and forges the bridge between the approaches of sutra and tantra.The fourth and final part of Book 7 begins with Kongtrul s comments on the impact that studying (that is, hearing) teachings and contemplating their meaning is meant to have on one. This impact includes the arousal of a sense of faith and confidence in the validity of those teachings, as well as the instilling of a moral sense of how to conduct oneself as a good human being and a truly spiritual practitioner. This segues into Kongtruls remain­ing discussion, for as he notes:This being the case, one will not be able to hear and contemplate teachings properly without relying on a deliberate and precise contemplation of such topics as one s hard-won state of oppor­tunities and endowments. Even if one is able to do so, one s ex­perience will not be affected in an ongoing way. So one should carefully contemplate the four contemplations that reorient the mind, which are methods found in the tradition of pith instruc­tions that dramatically reorient an ordinary individuals mind. (Kongtruls commentary to Book 7, Part 4)He then lays out his definitive treatment of a series of exercises known collectively as the “four contemplations that reorient the mind” (Tib. bio Idogrnam bzhi), which will be very familiar to anyone with any exposure to the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism. While the themes of these contempla­tions are found in all Buddhist traditions, their particular formulation as a standard group of four seems to be unique to the Tibetan schools.In fact, Kongtruls presentation of these four contemplative themes is an expanded version. The idiom usually refers to the four topics that Kongtrul treats in the first two sections of his discussion—that is, (1) the contempla­tion of the human state of rebirth (or rather, a certain set of circumstances within the human realm) as a hard-won state of opportunities and endow­ments; (l) the contemplation of one s mortality and the impermanence of every thing within the scope of our ordinary experience; (3) the contempla­tion of karma, that is, one s actions and their consequences; and (4) the contemplation of the shortcomings of samsara. In treating these four topics in two sections, Kongtrul then adds a third section, concerning the cultiva­11 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"t r a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n- *3tion of an altruistic and compassionate resolve; and a fourth, focusing on the development of sublime intelligence that culminates in the experience of a nondual state of timeless awareness.The progression of these contemplations is that of reorienting ones mental focus in increasingly profound ways. The first section, comprising the two topics of contemplation of the human rebirth and impermanence, deals with reorienting one away from being overly preoccupied with things of this life, while the second section, consisting of the contemplations of karma and the shortcomings of samsara, ensures that one is further reori­ented away from perpetuating a continued entanglement with the cycle of conditioned and limited existence in general. The third section is presented to guard against the spiritual complacency of a self-oriented desire for mere personal salvation and introduces the theme of altruism. The fourth section addresses the development of a sublime degree of intelligence that culmi­nates in the nondual experience of timeless awareness that takes one beyond the confines of ordinary dualistic consciousness.Given the lofty nature of the preceding discussion of view in part 3, it might appear odd for Kongtrul then to treat such seemingly elementary topics as those found in the first two sections, which are generally consid­ered “entry level” teachings. But the practice of Buddhism as a vehicle for spiritual liberation is grounded in a conviction that our present state of being is limiting and confused, coupled with a sincere desire to rise above those limitations and discover our true potential as beings in general and human beings in particular. This certainty—the will to become free of samsaras constraints—is often (perhaps somewhat misleadingly) translated as “renunciation,” but it is not meant to be understood as a puritanical mis­trust of the world. The four contemplative exercises contained in the first two sections of part 4 are designed to instill in one this will toward real freedom, which lies at the core of the discipline that is the very foundation of all Buddhist practice and is termed “Hinayana.” I have spoken elsewhere of my reasons for using this term,21 despite the negative connotations it can be interpreted to convey, as indicative of an individual attitude rather than of any historical group or geographic region.During the three-year retreat in which I participated from 1976 to 1980, under the auspices of Kalu Rinpoche, in the final year we were introduced to the practices known collectively as the “six doctrines” (Tib. chos drug)> which are considered advanced Vajrayana practices. In the context of these practices, the instruction manuals we were studying encouraged us to return"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"2-4- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEto such old familiar themes as the contemplation of impermanence and our mortality. Plainly, as much as such contemplations constitute “beginners practice,” they are not left behind but rather serve like the foundation of a house, important at the outset and never losing their important role as supports, just as the fact that one must begin learning one s alphabet in kin­dergarten does not mean one can forget or discard it when one moves on to higher levels of education.The third section introduces the element of altruism and compassion that is the foundation of the Mahayana approach—again using this term to refer to the individuals outlook and motivation—while the fourth sec­tion focuses on the other fundamental principle of the Mahayana, that of wisdom and intelligence and its role in bringing realization of the ultimate nature of mind and the phenomena it perceives.Kongtruls presentation of these four contemplations that reorient the mind parallels another model formulated by the great Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelukpa school—that is, the “three foremost principles” of the path (Tib. lam gyi gtso bo m am gsum), which are (i) the will to become free of samsara, (i) the awakening attitude of bodhicitta, and (3) the authentic view of the nature of reality.22In the case of each of these topics for contemplation, Kongtrul lays out methodical guidelines for addressing it as a topic of contemplation, so that the exercise is not one of merely musing on a subject but coming to a thor­oughgoing comprehension of its significance in light of one s personal expe­rience.In Book 8 Kongtrul discusses the last of the higher trainings, that of meditative stability and absorption. In his verse summary, he describes the contents of this book as follows:The eighth book discusses how higher states of absorption develop through meditation: calm abiding and deeper insight, the two common foundations of meditative absorption; the stages of meditation in the greater and lesser cause-based approaches;the tradition that emphasizes the Anuttara tantras of the secret mantra approach; and the traditions of the eight lineages of spiritual accomplishment, with emphasis on their esoteric instructions.23"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"t r a n sl a t o r’s in t r o d u c t io n- 2.5A translation of Book 8, Part 3 by Elio Guarisco and Ingrid McLeod has been published as The Treasury o f Knowledge: Book Eight, Part Three: The Elements o f Tantric Practice; a translation of Book 8, Part 4 by Sarah Hard­ing has been published as The Treasury o f Knowledge: Book Eight, Part Four: Esoteric Instructions. The present volume contains a translation of the first two parts of Book 8.Once one has gained certainty about the teachings through hearing and contemplating them, the logical next step is that of integrating them into one s experience through the process known as “meditation.” It is telling that the Tibetan word for “meditation” {sgom pa) is cognate to that for “becoming familiar with” (goms pa), resulting in a well-known case of word play: sgom pa ma yin goms pa yin (“It is not so much meditation as it is get­ting ‘used-to’”).Part 1 of Book 8 then presents the practice of meditation in the Buddhist context as a twofold process comprising elements of mental calmness and a deeper awareness of the nature of reality. The first element is termed “calm abiding” (Skt. samatha; Tib. zhignas), the latter “profound insight” (Skt. vipasyana; Tib. lhagmthong). In one way or another, these two factors play a role in meditation as it is carried out on every level of every approach in Buddhist practice. Here Kongtrul is discussing them in light of the general sütra tradition common to the Hlnayana and Mahayana approaches.The three-step process of hearing teachings, contemplating their mean­ing, and putting one’s understanding into practice through meditation is entirely logical in light of Kongtruls analogy of a fine harvest (the under­standing) being useful only when it is eaten, as it is intended to be, rather than being left on the level of mere intellectual understanding. It is in medi­tation that the real purpose of study and contemplation finds expression.Meditation, then, consists of the two factors of calm abiding (which Kongtrul defines as “a one-pointed state of attention”) and profound insight (“the discernment that thoroughly analyzes phenomena”). Kongtrul gives us the traditional analogy of meditation as being comparable to the flame of a lamp burning both steadily and brightly in order to illuminate effectively. Since the relationship between the two factors is that calm abiding supports the development of profound insight, Kongtrul begins by discussing calm abiding. Having examined such preliminary concerns as the supportive circumstances for the cultivation of calm abiding and correct meditation posture, he draws on both mainstream sources (Tib.gzhung)—in particular the works of Asañga—and personal advice (Tib. gdams ngag) to delineate"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"pitfalls in the development of the calm abiding of mind and remedies to address them. He concludes by reminding us that calm abiding, though of crucial importance in the pursuit of liberation and enlightenment, is not in itself sufficient; for while it serves as the necessary basis for all further cultivation of meditative stability in both the sutra and tantra traditions, the function of calm abiding is simply to suppress the afflictive mental states and their attendant suffering, which interfere with the development of pro­found insight and obscure the true nature of things, which is the object of that insight.Kongtrul then speaks to the issue of profound insight in its various expressions according to several approaches, including that of the Vajrayana, and concludes with a discussion of the integration of calm abiding and pro­found insight and the results this brings.In Part 2 of Book 8 we find a treatment of the stages of meditation as these are described in the cause-based, or dialectical, approach—which is to say, the sutra tradition comprising the three paths of the sravaka, the pratyekabuddha, and the bodhisattva. In many respects, this part parallels Kongtruls discussion of the stages and levels of this approach in Book 9 of the Treasury o f Knowledge.1* However, the treatment in Book 9 deals more with the overall theoretical models of the five paths (and only distinguishes the aforementioned three paths incidentally within that general frame­work), while here the focus is more on the specific process of meditative discipline as a crucial (perhaps the crucial) factor in all of those paths, and the distinctness of the different approaches is emphasized. Kongtrul pays a great deal of attention to the appropriate preliminaries to meditative disci­pline (includingpractical factors such as attitude and lifestyle) as well as the actual stages through which one progresses in meditation. His discussions of the Sravaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva paths here focus more on the actual way in which meditation is practiced. Taken together, the discus­sion in Books 8 and 9 complement one another and provide a very clear and complete picture of the cause-based approach as a path to liberation and enlightenment.Sanskrit terms and names have been rendered with diacritics, and the Wylie system of transcription has been used for Tibetan words provided (with place and personal names phoneticized in the text for ease of pro­nunciation but fully transcribed in the endnotes).

There are four cases of indirect intention,because they are concerned, respectively, with edification, characteristics, remedies, and transformation.Differences between Direct and Indirect Intention [iii]Direct intention simply plants the idea in the mind; it does not depend on the other person; it is explained that indirect intention does depend.32. - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE SOURCE VERSES- 33Four Reliances [c]Relying on the Meaning, Not the Words [i]Rely on the meaning, which makes evident the omniscient state of timeless awareness; do not rely on the words and letters that are conventional terms and designations.Relying on the Teachings, Not the Individual [ii]Rely on the teachings concerning unmistaken view and conduct; do not rely on an individuals family, ancestry, fame, or wealth.Relying on Timeless Awareness, Not Ordinary Consciousness [iii]Rely on timeless awareness, which is free of elaboration, without identity, and the very essence of being; do not rely on ordinary consciousness, which is a mind fixated on characteristics and concepts.Relying on the Definitive Meaning, Not the Provisional One [iv]Rely on the definitive meaning, with its profound and vast implications; do not rely on the provisional meaning that is temporarily expedient.Four Logical Principles [d]In mundane contexts, things are established through dependentrelationships; the sense faculties, objects, avenues of consciousness, and so forth,perform functions with respect to specific objects but do not perform these with respect to other aspects of experience; there is valid cognition based on inference, on direct experience, or on scriptural authority; and all phenomena can be found always to have their common and individual characteristics:These are known, respectively, as the logical principle of dependent relationships, that of the performance of functions,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"34 - THE t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g ethat of establishing what is reasonable, and that of the nature of things.Extraordinary Keys to Understanding [2]Brief Discussion [a]The extraordinary approach of secret mantra is evaluated through six parameters and four modes.Extensive Explanation [b]Six Parameters [i]Given the presence or absence of a fortunate capacity regarding reality,a single vajra word conveys distinct meanings.Therefore, the provisional meaning is found in the stage of development and its ancillaries;the definitive meaning lies in both the causal aspect of tantra and the stage of completion.A single meaning treated by different and seemingly contradictory statementsis a case of explanation requiring interpretation, in which the meaning being expressed depends on the underlying intent.Where it does not depend on this, one understands the presentation directly; this is explanation that does not require interpretation.

Understanding Truth and MeaningProvisional and Definitive Meaning in the Three Cycles of Teachings [I] General Discussion [A]The principal topics for evaluation are the three cycles of the sacred dharma.Specific and Detailed Analysis [B]Common Tradition [1]All agree that the first cycle is provisional in meaning.Tradition of Proponents of Things Having No Finite Essence [2]Proponents of things having no finite essence opine,“The intermediate cycle is primarily definitive in meaning, the final one largely provisional.”They have no actual scriptural authority for this, only proving their rationale through reasoning.Tradition of Yogic Practitioners [3]“The intermediate cycle, putting an end to elaborations, is definitively meaningful in the shorter term; the final cycle, bringing a definitive conclusion concerning what is ultimate, is definitively meaningful in the far-reaching sense.” So says the tradition of Yogic Practitioners.Their scriptural authority is found in the distinctions made by the Victorious One himself, and the further distinctions made by the tradition of the prophesied exalted one, who attained the third level of realization.The reasoning is found by applying the example of refining a gem and so forth.Rangjung, Dolpo, Drim£ Ozer, and othersprimarily accept this latter interpretation, others the former.Explanation of the Exalted One [4]In particular, it is explained that the three successivecycles of the dharma—"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE SOURCE VERSES- 37initial, intermediate, and final—undermine, respectively, nonvirtue, the belief in identity, and all bases for dogmatic opinions.Incorrect Opinions and Single Intent [5]Some think of what is provisionally meaningful as untrue, as false, but this is an incorrect opinion, for the Buddhas word entails no falsehoods.Because it eliminates elaborations concerning the manner in which things appear while actually demonstrating the way things actually abide,the great spiritual guide and others accept that the entire Buddhadharma has a single intent.Two Levels of Truth [II]Introductory Comments [A]The sacred Buddhadharma was taught on the basis of two levels of truth.Actual Classification [B]Essence [1]Generally speaking, these are in essence contrived and uncontrived, respectively—that which is imputed by the minds of ordinary beings and the state of spiritually advanced beings in meditative equipoise.Derivation of Terms [2]As for the derivation of the terms, what is conditioned is true on the relative level itself, while one fact is true on the ultimate level.Characteristics and Synonyms [3]The characteristics are those of the object s being either that of a confused consciousness that does not investigate it"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"or that of the unconfused mind of a spiritually advanced being—that is, deceptive or not deceptive.The way in which the subjective perceiver apprehends is either one of confusion or its absence.These levels are presented with many synonymous terms.Precise Analysis [4]The Actual Analysis [a]General Analysis [i]Without investigating any foundation for analysis, on the basis of what simply can be known, one can distinguish the way in which things appear from the way they abide—that is, the relative from the ultimate.Specific Analysis [ii]The way in which things appear is a state of confusion—the perceptions in the minds of ordinary beings; the unconfused state is accepted by most to consist of the path and its fruition.The relative is that of ordinary mortals and the spiritually advanced, or that of mundane people and advanced spiritual practitioners.The ultimate is in essence indivisible but can be analyzed as having three characteristics, or, from the perspective of topics under discussion, sixteen aspects, and so forth.Reasons Underlying the Analysis [b]Due to the difference in the way that the minds of the spiritually advanced and the spiritually immature perceive, and the classification based on mutual dependence,...Certainty of Two Levels [c]... truth is certainly twofold.38 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE SOURCE VERSES- 39Two Levels of Truth: Identical or Separate?

More obvious things and streams of consciousness are relative, while what is indivisible is ultimately true. This is the tradition of the Particularist school.Things that are ultimately able to perform functions or not, which are characterized as specifics or generalities—this is the tradition of the Followers of the Sütras.Dualistic experiences of perceived and perceiver, of objects and their perceiving subject, are considered as actually being nondual consciousness. This is the tradition of the Mind Only school.Sensory appearances, which are proven to be relative, are similar to illusions,while what is ultimate, like space, cannot be found to exist. This is the tradition of the Autonomist school.What is imputed by ordinary consciousness is relative (accepted in accord with what is commonly understood in the world), while freedom from conceptual elaboration is beyond imagination or expression. This is the tradition of the Consequentialist school.The imputed and the dependent are relative; the ultimate is the absolute—self-knowing timeless awareness.

Authentic ViewThe Need for Authentic View [I]Given that nirvana—the deathless state—is what to strive for, sublime intelligence is the remedy to eliminate ignorance, the source of obscuration.Without it this will not take place, for it ensures that one s view is pure. Conduct through skillful means brings purification, and one swiftly gains freedom in the integration of totally pure view and conduct.In particular, because all the teachings spoken by the Victorious One are directed toward, and come down to, the basic space of phenomena, initially one should come to a definitive understanding of the view. Having properly understood the flawed attitudes of erroneous opinions, one eliminates these while seeking out and accepting what is definitively meaningful as one s authentic view.The Way to Develop Sublime Intelligence [II]With ignorance serving as the cause, the belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates is the false perception of identity, which is the root of four mistaken ideas. The remedy to this is to develop sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of identity.Preliminaries: The Four Axioms [III]Conditioned phenomena are momentary and impermanent; all that is corruptible is of the nature of the three kinds of suffering; both the deeply ingrained afflictive state and the totally refined state are empty and lack identity; nirvana alone is liberation, the state of peace.These are the four axioms that denote the general teachings of the Buddhas words.Contemplating them thoroughly, one arouses a sense of certainty at the outset."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Path That Avoids Pualistic Extremes [IV]General Way to Avoid Dualistic Extremes [A]Next, one follows the path that avoids dualistic extremes.One uses the sublime intelligence that understands ultimate reality as the perceiving agentto pare away conceptual elaborations concerning the object that is to be known. This is the tradition of each individuals own school.Be that as it may, materialists may eliminate naive affirmation and nihilistic denialaccording to their own interpretations, but they still fall into extremes of overstatement and understatement.Therefore, these interpretations are partly truth but with much untruth.Because the way of abiding is realized to be free of conceptual elaborations and the way in which things manifestto be a process of interdependent connection, the Middle Way tradition is entirely true.Specific Explanation of the Middle Way Tradition [B]Identifying Emptiness [1]The scope of its view is emptiness—the actuality of negating the two kinds of identity, and an aspect of unqualified negation.Unqualified Emptiness (mngstong) [2]The basis for emptiness is objects in the phenomenal world, which are also what is to be negated and the basis for such negation.The way in which these are empty, according to the unqualifiedinterpretation of emptiness, is that they cannot be proven to exist in essence.If this is analyzed, there are sixteen aspects—of outer, inner, both, emptiness, and so forth—but these can be subsumed within the four aspects of what is substantial, insubstantial, true nature, and alternate reality.41 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE SOURCE VERSES- 43Qualified Emptiness {gzhan stong) [3]The basis for negation is what is absolute, while the factors to be negated are what is imputed and what is dependent.The Yogic Practitioners profess that it is “empty of these.”They explain that this can be analyzed into fourteen aspects, which can be subsumed within two.Main Explanation; Two Aspects of the Lack of Identity [V ]Purpose [A]The hindrances to perception are the ten distracting concepts; the remedies that dispel these are the two aspects of lack of identityAnalysis [B]Lack of Identity in Phenomena [1]Key Topic [a]The more obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phenomena is an issue common to Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, and so one should come to a definitive conclusion about it at the outset.Factor to Be Negated [b]This is, in essence, similar to a rope being taken for a snake; there is just the fixation in the ordinary mind that this is something self- justifying that is truly existent.Purpose of Negating Identity [c]This is negated because it is the cause for misconstruing things to have identity, which lies at the root of the two obscuring factors.Philosophical Interpretations [d]Although the Particularists and Followers of the Sutras do not have a completely perfect understanding of suchness,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"4 4- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEthey come to their definitive conclusion on the basis of temporary objects in the phenomenal world.The rationale is that nothing whatsoever is found through investigation; for to consider this to mean a lack of true existence is their general tradition.The Mind Only schools own tradition holds that they realize both aspects of the lack of identity; but if a follower of the Middle Way evaluates this, because nondual consciousness is held to be ultimate, there still remains a rudimentary sense of identity in phenomena.Definitive Understanding through Middle Way Reasoning [e]Although there are many lines of reasoning in the Middle Way, the tradition of the Exalted One uses five to usher in certainty concerning the integration of emptiness and interdependent connection.Candra speaks of two models: once perceived objects are negated, the proof that they do not exist negates the perceiving subject; and the logic that a single relative thing is empty means that all phenomena are empty.Lack of Identity in the Individual [2]Key Topic [a]The issue that distinguishes non-Buddhists from Buddhists is that of identity in the individual.Factor to Be Negated [b]In essence, this is the instinctual fixation on “I” and “mine.”Purpose of Negating Identity [c]It is negated because from it comes the sense of “other,” from which all opinionated views derive."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE SOURCE VERSES- 45Philosophical Interpretations [d]While there are differences in the way in which realization takes place, all four philosophical systems bring realization.Definitive Understanding through Middle Way Reasoning [e]The five aggregates are not the self, the self does not possess them, nor do they act as supports one for the other.

This means that, under the circumstances, you reflect thoroughly on the conventional words used and their mean­ings, eliminating any superfluous indecision through a precise process of examination and investigation. For even though you might understand something in a rough way after having heard it once, this does not bring you the certainty that comes with a definitive conclusion concerning what exactly is meant. It is when you examine each and every word and its mean­ing, bringing numerous scriptural citations and kinds of reasoning to bear on these, that you authentically arouse in yourself an awareness that entails certainty on a very fundamental level.As to how this process of contemplation is carried out, it involves what can be called an “internal dialogue,” involving both conceptual thinking on a more obvious level and mental investigation on a more subtle level. These are used to evaluate the topics concerning what one needs to know.The source verses state:Mundane conceptual thought is associated with ordinary mental functioning,while transcendent thought is associated with sublime intelligence; [3.111a]a discerning mind engages in precise investigation.In this regard, the first stage, termed “internal dialogue as an all-absorb­ing state of sensation,”26 consists of conceptual thinking that may be either an ordinary process of thinking about some topic to be understood or a function of sublime intelligence.

It is a more precise state of mind that comes to a definitive conclusion by discern­ing the state of things more accurately (“this is a well-made vase,” “this is a badly made vase,” “the color of this blanket is a good one [or a bad one]”). If we analyze it further, the same categories apply as in the preceding case.30Thus, the sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation is aroused by conceptual thinking and mental investigation being applied to the topics of the teachings you have heard.Specific Keys to Evaluating the Teachings [II]This more specific explanation has two parts: a brief enumeration by way of introduction, and a more extensive explanation of the significance of these keys.Brief Enumeration byWay of Introduction [A]The source verses state:This involves two factors: the keys that are crucial in order to evaluate the teachings and the treasure chamber of the sacred teachings that are to be evaluated.The standard processes of evaluation are primarily those ofprovisional vis-à-vis definitive meaning, direct vis-à-vis indirect intention,the four reliances, and the four logical principles. [3.111b]In terms of the way in which the process of contemplation is carried out, this can be concisely defined to consist of two factors: the tools that are crucial in order to evaluate the teachings (which can be likened to keys) and the sacred teachings that are to be so evaluated (which can be likened to a treasure chamber of precious gems)."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"58 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEAs for the first factor, there are tools for evaluation that are ordinary and extraordinary. The ordinary tools are primarily the following: the four aspects of provisional vis-a-vis definitive meaning and direct vis-à-vis indi­rect intention; the four reliances; and the four logical principles.Extensive Explanation of the Significance of These Keys [B]The extensive explanation focuses on two points: the ordinary keys to understanding and the extraordinary ones.Ordinary Keys to Understanding [1]There are four topics: provisional vis-à-vis definitive meaning, direct vis- à-vis indirect intention, the four reliances, and the four logical principles.Provisional and Definitive Meaning [a]The source verses state:Individuality, the state of an ordinary being, origination and cessation,the mind-body aggregates and sense fields, and so forth—these are means to gain access to the fundamentally unconditioned nature of reality.These topics, together with the discussions of them, constitute the relative level of provisional meaning.When the things under consideration fall principally within the range of sensory appearances that are well known in one s ordinary perception (for example, one s sense of individuality; the state of ordinary beings; the mind- body aggregates, sense fields, and other components of ordinary experience; and the origin and cessation and the coming and going of these), as means to gain access to the fundamentally unconditioned nature of reality, they are evaluated in categories that can be described, imagined, and expressed, and are presented through the use of some conceptual overlay.

Whichever discourses explain things in terms of emptiness, the absence of subde traits, the absence of naïve speculation, the absence of any overt states of ordinary mind, nonorigination, nonoccurrence, the absence of any substantial­ity in things, the lack of identity, the nonexistence of ordinary beings, the nonexistence of life force, the nonexistence of an in­dividual, the nonexistence of any agent, up to and including the nonexistence of any avenue to complete liberation—these are called “definitive in meaning.”41And In Praise o f the Inconceivable Middle Way:The emptiness of phenomena is presented as “the definitive meaning.”42Some cite such passages as the following from the Highest Continuum.Faintheartedness, belitding lesser beings, fixating on what is inauthentic, disparaging what is authentic, and egocentric attachment: the Buddha spoke of these five specific faultsso that those who had them could eliminate them.43Such citations are indeed used to claim that the texts that are provisional in meaning are those that present a purpose for the teachings they contain.6O - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"But this is not definitive, for the fact that all teachings are entirely for the purpose of guiding those to be guided would then mean that all teachings were provisional in meaning,44 and all those that anyone holds to be defini­tive in meaning were nevertheless taught for a purpose.45Generally speaking, the Discourse Taught by Aksayamati states that those discourses are definitive in meaning that speak of seven topics (engage­ment with the fruition state, ultimate reality, the totally pure state of total enlightenment, the exhaustion of karma and afflictive states, the nondu­ality of samsara and nirvana, the direct perception of profundity that is difficult to assimilate thoroughly, and mind functioning with certainty46), [3.113a] and an eighth set of topics (that is, such topics as the three avenues to complete liberation, the absence of ordinary mental states, nonorigina­tion, nonoccurrence, the absence of any substance, and the lack of identity). The sutra speaks of discussions dealing with anything else being taken to be provisional in meaning. A parallel discussion of the foregoing eight topics is also found in the Most Majestic State o f Meditative Absorption}1The authentic way of distinguishingprovisional from definitive meaning can also be found in the tantras. Vajrapani, the Lord of Secrets, makes such statements as the following:Provisional discussions speak of the bhaga of the karmamudra\\ those that are definitive discuss the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence—emptiness, . . . On the mundane relative level, there is the “bringing together of the circle of dakinls”; with the definitive meaning, there is also the “bringing together of the circle of dakinls.” In the latter case, however, the term “dakinls” is a reference to the thirty-seven factors that contribute to en­lightenment;48 the consolidation of these is called the “circle.” These factors are expressions of the emptiness that characterizes dharmakaya.49These methods will be dealt with in the next section.50 Direct and Indirect Intention [b]The four cases each of direct and indirect intention are explained in three ways:51 the four cases of direct intention, the four cases of indirect intention, and the distinction between these two groups.KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING - 6l"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Four Cases of Direct Intention [i]The source verses state:Words can have different implications,52 but the method for interpreting them reveals that there is no contradiction.Because those to be guided are guided by relying on these methods,[one considers] the underlying motive, the function, and the seeming incompatibility.The four cases of direct intention are those concerned with equalness, implied issues,eventualities, and the attitudes of individuals.There are cases in which some inference can be made that is different from a more obvious explanation—from how one understands the words and their meanings. These two aspects, the actual wording and its hidden meaning, can be revealed, through a single method of interpreting them, not to be in contradiction. Because many who are to be guided are guided by the actual wording on which they rely, a teaching is said to be “intention­ally interpretable” when it meets three criteria:i) the underlying motive involves some other meaning;53z) the function is that of those to be guided being guided by such a method; [3.113b] and3) it seems to involve scripture and reasoning incompatible with the actual wording per se, and so undermine it.There are four cases:1) Direct intention concerned with equalness includes such statements as, “At that point I became the tathâgata Vipasyin,. . ”54 which takes into consideration equalness with respect to dharmakâya.551) Direct intention concerned with implied issues includes such state­ments as, “All phenomena are such that they have no finite essence per se,” which takes into consideration the three ways in which things have no finite essence.56 That is to say:(a) Things that are imputed57 have no finite essence with respect to their characteristics, because they definitely cannot be found to exist in actual fact.58(b) Things that are dependent59 have no finite essence with respect to61 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"KEYS TO UNDERSTANDINGorigination,60 because they cannot be found to originate through any of four alternative processes:61► things are not produced from themselves, because there is a sub­stantial contradiction in the product and the producer being simul­taneous;► things are not produced from other things, because nothing “other,” if examined critically, can be found to exist in and of itself;► things cannot be found to be produced from both themselves and other things, for this also involves a substantial contradiction;62 and► things being produced without cause is an impossibility.63However, the seeming origination and so forth of all that manifests as it does is a process of interdependent connection, simply as is an illusion or a dream, and so things are apparent yet nonexistent. The sutra Manifest Adornment o f Timeless Awareness states:O Manju^ri, a dream manifests without being something that exists; similarly, all phenomena manifest without being things that exist 64It continues in the same vein, using the analogies of an illusion, a mirage, a fata morgana, a reflection of the moon in water, a reflection in a mirror, and a phantom.(c) As for the absolute,65 this has no finite essence in any ultimate sense,66 for given that this constitutes ultimate reality, what it epitomizes has no finite essence defined by such conceptual elaborations as \"pure” or “impure.” As the sutra Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states:Taking into consideration that things are nonexistent in their very essence with respect to their characteristics, that things are nonexistent in their very essence with respect to origination, and that there is nothing that ultimately exists in its very essence, I have taught, “All phenomena do not exist in their very essence.”673) Direct intention concerned with eventualities [3.114a] includes such statements as, “By simply recalling the name of the tathagata V imalacandra- prabha, you will attain buddhahood.” While the attainment will not come from that alone, one will awaken to buddhahood at some point after pursu­ing spiritual development initiated by that act of recall."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"64 - t h e t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g e4) Direct intention concerned with the attitudes of individuals includes such statements as those that disparage discipline while extolling generos­ity, spoken to those who are obsessed with the opinion that discipline is an absolute principle in its own right.Four Cases of Indirect Intention [ii]The source verses state:The means to educate others that are not definitive yet capable of leading themare with respect to šrávakas, the three aspects of the very essence of things, the overcoming of flaws, and the profundity of what is expressed. There are four cases of indirect intention, because they are concerned, respectively, with edification, characteristics, remedies, and transformation.The words that express ideas may not be definitive but may neverthe­less be used in consideration of their simply being capable of providing guidance. As a means of educating those to be guided, teachings may be spoken using words with a certain connotation. This is known as “indirect intention.” In this regard, there are four cases of such intention—that which is concerned with edification and so forth—because they are concerned, respectively, with those who belong to the srávaka type, with the three aspects of the very essence of things, with the overcoming of flaws, and with the profundity of what is expressed.1) As for indirect intention concerned with edification, some who are of the srávaka type are daunted by emptiness and so do not follow the Mahá- yána approach. In order for them to embark on it, the Buddha said “Forms exist”; while those listening understood by this that these can actually be proven to exist and so embarked on the approach, the intention of the one explaining this was that these “exist” in the way that dream images do.z) As for indirect intention concerned with characteristics, in order that people come to understand the way in which things actually abide, without any finite essence per se, the Buddha said, for example, “All phenomena are such that they have no finite essence per se.” For those who held that phe­nomena do not exist, he spoke of nonexistence in consideration of what is"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING- 65imputed, while for those who held that they do exist, he spoke of existence in consideration of what is absolute.3) As an example of indirect intention concerned with remedies, in con­sideration of some who felt, “Sakyamuni has such a small stature and short life span that he is inferior to other teachers,” [3.114b] the Buddha said, “At that point I became the tathagata Vairocana.” Those hearing this under­stood the form manifestations of these two to be equal, while the inten­tion of the one explaining this was of three considerations—equality in the perfection of spiritual development, equality in the attainment of dharma- kaya, and equality in the ensuring of benefit for beings. As the Treasury o f Abhidharma states:All buddhas are equal in their spiritual development, in dharmakaya, and in their conduct to benefit beings, but not on account of their life spans, their family background, or their physical stature.684) Indirect intention concerning transformation refers to cases in which something very difficult to fathom was taught in order to remove the flaw of thinking, “This dharma is so easy to understand that it must be inferior to other systems.” To give an example, in Didactic Aphorisms we read the following:Having slain the father and mother,and vanquished the ruler and the two ritually pure ones,as well as the kingdom and subjects,that person who has done so becomes purity itself.69In this passage, the two factors of compulsion and perpetuation70— because they contribute to the patterning that sustains samsara—are the “father” and “mother.” The basis of all ordinary experience,71 serving as the support or basis for myriad habitual patterns, is the “ruler.” The “two ritually pure ones” are the brahmin who believes in the reality of the per­ishable mind-body aggregates and the spiritual practitioner who believes that personal rules of discipline and deportment are absolute principles in their own right. The eight avenues of consciousness'2—the inner aspects of the sense fields73 and the dualistic consciousness of subject and object they entail—are what is meant by “as well as the kingdom and subjects.”"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"66- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGETo “vanquish” them—that is, to become purified of them—is to awaken to buddhahood.Differences between Direct and Indirect Intention [iii]The source verses state:Direct intention simply plants the idea in the mind; it does not dependon the other person; it is explained that indirect intention doesThese two—direct and indirect intention—are essentially identical, with certain differences, so that occasionally they are in accord. But if we make a distinction, we may cite from Explanatory Essays Commenting on the “Compendium o f the Supreme Spiritual Approach, ” which gives the fol­lowing explanation:Direct intention simply plants the idea in the mind; [3.115a] it is not asserted to depend on the other persons absorbing what has been said;74 indirect intention depends on the other persons absorbing what has been said.75In this regard, the omniscient Drimé Ozer says:76“Direct intention” refers to cases that depend on some circum­stance or another, so that the explanations follow suit, although they do not depend on whether the other person is influenced or not. The term “intention” is used because when, for example, others ask about the issue at hand, whatever meanings are not fully understood are left within the underlying basis of that in­tention.“Indirect intention” refers to cases in which , in order to ben­efit others, teachings take place in accord with someone’s percep­tions, using a somewhat oblique approach. This is because the speaker speaks, the other persons understanding is awakened, and this message serves as a basis for understanding of other top­ics to be further perfected, while nevertheless falling shy of being a falsehood.77"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING- ¿7Four Reliances [c]The term “reliance” means that one can place one s complete trust and con­fidence in the object in question.78 In this regard, we read such passages as the following from the Discourse on the Supreme Passing Beyond Sorrow:O monks, you should focus on four things. What are these four?To focus on the teachings and not focus on the individual; to focus on the meaning and not focus on the words; to focus on timeless awareness and not focus on ordinary consciousness; and to focus on the definitive meaning and not focus on the meaning that guides.79 These four things are things to be realized; they are not four kinds of spiritual individuals.80This theme is developed very extensively in the Discourse Taught by Aksayamati.Relying on the Meaning, Not the Words [i]Of these four, the source verses refer to the first as follows:Rely on the meaning, which makes evident the omniscient state of timeless awareness; do not rely on the words and letters that are conventional terms and designations.The “meaning” refers in general to the presentations of factors that con­tribute to the transcendent state of enlightenment and more particularly to the path of the complete purity of the three focal points (and the frui­tion it entails) [3.115b]—in brief, the extraordinary methods that make fully evident the completely omniscient state of timeless awareness. It is on this meaning that one should rely.Mundane terms and conventional designations, ordinary fields of knowl­edge, and so forth, up to and including the eighty-four thousand collections of the dharma—to follow after the mere terms and words and letters is of little consequence, and so one should not rely on these."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGERelying on the Teachings, Not the Individual [ii]The source verses state:Rely on the teachings concerning unmistaken view and conduct; do not rely on an individuals family, ancestry, fame, or wealth.There are individuals who embody unmistaken view and conduct with respect to the causes and effects of the completely refined state of enlight­enment and the unenlightened state of all-consuming afflictive states and who in particular have thoroughly assimilated the methods of the Middle Way, or Madhyamaka, school in the Mahayana approach. It is on the fact that they are not in conflict with the mainstream tradition of the Buddha- dharma that one should rely.These individuals may be from great families of aristocracy; they may be descended from great lineages of noble ancestry; they may enjoy great fame as recognized incarnate teachers, or erudite scholars, or accomplished masters; they may be very wealthy, with retinue and students and material possessions. However, while any of these may be the case, if these individu­als contradict the dharma in general in their view and conduct, or if in par­ticular they are not in accord with the Mahayana tradition, one should not rely on an individuals more superficial appeal.Relying on Timeless Awareness, Not Ordinary Consciousness [iii]The source verses state:Rely on timeless awareness, which is free of elaboration, without identity, and the very essence of being; do not rely on ordinary consciousness, which is a mind fixated on characteristics and concepts.Timeless awareness entails (a) understanding that the way in which phe­nomena actually abide is, from the ultimate perspective, free of all limita­tions imposed by elaborations of origination, cessation, and so forth; (b) realization of the nonexistence of the two kinds of identity;81 and (c) unerr­ing knowledge of sugatagarbha82 as utter lucidity, the way in which things actually abide, beyond any context of speculative value judgments.83 It is on this awareness that one should rely."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING-Ordinary consciousness entails (a) belief that what one immediately per­ceives constitutes something truly existent; (b) conceptualization in terms of characteristics, such as the sense of personal identity and the mind-body aggregates; and (c) mental states that are conditioned, for example, [3.116a] by attitudes of naively fixating on the pleasures of the senses. One should not rely on such consciousness.Relying on the Definitive Meaning, Not the Provisional One [iv]The source verses state:Rely on the definitive meaning, with its profound and vast implications;do not rely on the provisional meaning that is temporarily expedient.The definitive meaning is found in those teachings that go far beyond one s immediate perceptions, or intellectual speculation, or the scope of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and that deal with profound and vast top­ics that fall within the scope of those of the very highest acumen, which is inconceivable to our ordinary way of thinking. It is this meaning that one should rely on.Those teachings that arouse a sense of disenchantment with samsara; that deal with the will to be free84 as defined in the various spiritual approaches; that present things in terms of substantial versus nominal existence, or as “mind only,” or as an empty state of nothingness—these are provisional teachings that are presented as temporary expedients, and so one should not rely on them.Four Logical Principles [d]The source verses state:In mundane contexts, things are established through dependent relationships; the sense faculties, objects, avenues of consciousness, and so forth,perform functions with respect to specific objects but do not perform these with respect to other aspects of experience;"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEthere is valid cognition based on inference, on direct experience, or on scriptural authority; and all phenomena can be found always to have their common and individual characteristics:These are known, respectively, as the logical principle ofdependent relationships, that of the performance of functions, that of establishing what is reasonable, and that of the nature of things.The term “logical principle”85 refers here to what is logical and valid if one examines what is commonly accepted in mundane contexts to be proven as authentic purely on the conventional level. There are four cases of such principles:(i) The first is the establishment of things through dependent relation­ships. It is logical that a seedling occurs in dependence on there being a seed; it is logical that formative factors and the other links of interdependent con­nection occur in dependence on there being ignorance;86 and while visual consciousness does not occur by its own nature, it is logical that it occurs in dependence on there being both the visual faculty and the forms that are the sense objects involved. Such cases are examples of “the logical principle of dependent relationships.”(z) In the second case, the sense faculties, sense objects, avenues of con­sciousness, and so forth, contribute to performing the particular function of perceiving a specific kind of object and do not perform this with respect to anything else. Thus, it is logical that if visual consciousness occurs, [3.116b] it performs the function of seeing forms but is not appropriate for the hear­ing of sounds. In the case of the visual faculty, moreover, it is suitable to perform the function of generating visual consciousness but not suitable for generating auditory or other kinds of consciousness. It is logical for grains of barley to produce barley but not logical that they produce buckwheat or millet or some other grain. Such cases are examples of “the logical principle of the performance of functions.”(3) The third case may involve valid cognition based on inference, such as knowing that there is a fire from the fact that there is smoke, or realizing that there is water from the presence of water fowl; valid cognition based on the direct experience of what is perceived by the six avenues of ordinary consciousness or the mind of an advanced spiritual practitioner; or valid cognition based on scriptural authority—the infallible words spoken from"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"the mouth of a buddha. These are cases of “the logical principle of what is validly cognized,” “the logical principle of establishing what is reasonable.”(4) As for the fourth case, it is logical for water to flow downhill (but not logical that it flow uphill), for the sun to rise in the east, for earth to be solid, for water to be wet, for fire to be hot, for wind to be motile, and so forth. The fact that phenomena are such that they have characteristics in common (including being empty and lacking any identity), as well as their individual ones, and are known to continue always to be that way by their specific natures is termed “the principle of the nature of things.”These successive topics are known as the “four logical principles.” The foregoing discussion has been summarized on the basis of the source verses.Extraordinary Keys to Understanding [2]The explanation of the extraordinary methods for evaluating the profound meaning in the secret mantra approach is twofold: a brief discussion and a more extensive explanation.Brief Discussion [a]The source verses state:The extraordinary approach of secret mantra is evaluated through six parameters and four modes.One could never arrive at a definitive conclusion concerning the defini­tive secrets of the extraordinary secret mantra approach of the Vajrayana with the more superficial scriptural authority and reasoning of intellectu­als; rather, these secrets are to be realized through six parameters and four modes.Extensive Explanation [b]The explanation is of both the six parameters and the four modes.87Six Parameters [i]The source verses state:KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING - 71"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEGiven the presence or absence of a fortunate capacity regarding reality,a single vajra word conveys distinct meanings. [3.117a]Therefore, the provisional meaning is found in the stage of development and its ancillaries;the definitive meaning lies in both the causal aspect of tantra and the stage of completion.In this regard, as the source tantra of the Kalacakra cycle states:The language of what is intended to be interpreted, and likewise what is not;what is to be taken literally, and likewise what is not;the provisional meaning and the definitive meaning:tantras are characterized by six parameters.88Which is to say, the vajra words89 of the tantras, which plumb such pro­found depths, are embraced within these six parameters.The first pair is that of provisional vis-a-vis definitive meaning. Out of consideration of the fact that some have the fortunate capacity to realize the significance of the reality of suchness itself, while others do not, a single tantra of vajra words conveys distinct meanings.Of these, the provisional meaning is found in the methods for engaging on the inner level of spiritual practice—colored sand mandalas, offerings, symbols, ritual hand gestures, fire rituals, development stage practice, prac­tices to carry out specific activities, and so forth.The definitive meaning lies in the presentations of the causal aspect of tantra90 as the true way of abiding and the completion stage of practice.91 These are found in the sources that discuss the control of subtle channels, subtle energies, and bodhicitta;92 or the “universal ground”93 (that is, the way in which mind truly abides, utterly lucid by nature), the buddha nature, the sublimely unchanging state of mahamudra.94 To cite, for example, from the Hevajra Tantra:Supreme and timeless awareness abides in the body.All ordinary concepts have been truly eliminated.This is what permeates all things.Although it abides in the body, it is not produced by the body.95"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The spurce verses state:A single meaning treated by different and seemingly contradictory statementsis a case of explanation requiring interpretation, in which the meaning being expressed depends on the underlying intent.Where it does not depend on this, one understands thepresentation directly; this is explanation that does not require interpretation. These are two more parameters.(A) With respect to a single topic of development stage practice, there may be different vajra words that seem to be making contradictory state­ments about that topic. The meaning being expressed must be understood in relation to the underlying intent, and so this is “explanation requiring interpretation.” [3.117b]Alternatively, different intended meanings can be imbedded in a single vajra word. When this approach is adopted, there is interpretation with respect to time frame, interpretation with respect to implied meaning, and interpretation with respect to understanding.(i) The first case is, for example, the statementIn a single instant there is perfect buddhahood.96Here the intention concerns something that will occur at some future point in time.(ii) The second case is, for example, the lines from the tantra Supreme Illusion'.Having kidnapped her from all the buddhas,enjoy the maiden born of the sublime deity.97Here the intention is that one should constantly be experiencing emp­tiness endowed with the most sublime of all distinct manifestations98— Prajnaparamita, the feminine principle that embodies the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence, the mother of all buddhas99—the nature of which is like that of a diviner.100(iii) The third case is, for example, like the passage from thtH evajra Tan- tray which reads:KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING - 73"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"74 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEYou should slay living beings 101Here the intention is that one should “slay” the fixation on personal iden­tity that is referred to here by the name of the supreme subtle energy that sustains life force.(B) In cases in which the meaning being expressed does not depend on the underlying intent but is clearly understood simply through the direct presentation, there is “explanation that does not require interpretation.” For example, there are the statements:You should not slay living beings.You should not speak false words.102The source verses state:Descriptions of mandalas and other topics in well-known language are to be taken literally;those that use uncommon language and are bound up in symbolism are not to be taken literally.Since the words and meanings do not fall outside the foregoing, they are the six parameters.Topics and terms that are described in language that is well known in mundane treatises and other such sources—ceremonies involving mandalas, fire rituals, tormas, and so forth—are to be taken literally as stated. Those that use language not commonly found in mundane treatises—the secret language of tathagatas—and that are bound up in symbolism are not to be taken literally; for example, when terms such as kotdkhyah are used in nam­ing the ten aspects of subde energy, or when the tantra the Heart Essence o f Secrets refers to the processes of union and release as the Sanskrit vowels and consonants, respectively.103Since the foregoing principles are such that all words and meanings found in the secret approach do not fall outside them, [3.118a] they are referred to as the “six parameters.”"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING- 75Four Modes [ii]These modes are discussed in the tantra Compendium o f the Vajra o f Timeless Awareness as the four kinds of explanation—the literal meaning, the shared meaning, the hidden meaning, and the consummate meaning.104(A) The source verses state:The mere reading word by word is the literal meaning.An explanation that is based on the mere reading of a text word by word,105 arranged in the same way that one would employ for a text on gram­mar or logic, is said to be “the literal meaning,” or what the Galpom refers to as “the meaning of the words.”(B) The source verses state:The shared meaning concerns the alleviating of misgivings concerning the sutra tradition and others, and the stage of development.The shared meaning is concerned with three situations:(i) In the first situation, any misgivings one had at following the sutra tra­dition are alleviated. Suppose someone were to feel misgivings and think, “This is not good. Instead of following such a path as the inner level of the secret approach,107 which is so straightforward and swift, I am following the sutra tradition, or that of kriya and carya.”108 The “shared meaning” would then be to point out that these latter are springboards to that path and that even in the sutras we find such passages as:For those who are endowed with supreme skillful means,afflictive states become the supports of enlightenment.109That is to say, even the sutra tradition and others accept that, if one is of sharp acumen and endowed with an extraordinary understanding of skillful means, that very path can be straightforward and swift, so that a single, very powerful act in one s spiritual practice can ensure the accelerated develop­ment that otherwise would have taken many eons.(ii) In the second situation, any misgivings one felt at following the inner level of the secret approach are alleviated. Suppose someone were to feel"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"7¿ - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEmisgivings and think, “In this inner approach, one s conduct is like that of a pig or a dog, with no concern for impurity versus cleanliness, or for such things as bathing and ritual purity. Things such as union and release are like the dogma of those with extreme views, who profess that harmful actions are somehow spiritual.” The response would then be to point out that one engages in this conduct with the thought, “This is to eliminate my fixa­tions,” for if one has not eliminated such fixations as those with impurity versus cleanliness, one cannot realize the significance of the true nature of phenomena; this is something accepted even in the sütra tradition. Fur­thermore, as in the cases of the slaying of the evil one with the spear or the enjoyment of the captains daughter,110 due to ones having a virtuous mind, even if one engages in union and release, one will not be sullied by any flaw; rather, one s merit will be increased immeasurably. This, too, is something accepted even in the sütra tradition. This is the “shared meaning” because these are common guidelines of training.111 [3.118b](iii) In the third situation, the shared meaning for practitioners of the stage of development lies in those factors that are connected with the devel­opment stage—such as meditation on immeasurable mansions as supports and deities as what is supported within these. This is the “shared meaning” because these are guidelines of training that are common to the stages of both development and completion.112(C) The source verses state:The teachings on desire are hidden, relative truth is hidden, and the higher, middling, and lesser degrees with respect to what lies at the core are hidden meaning.Because the presentations of karmamudrá, ceremonies involving sexual union, and so forth, are unsuitable for public exposure, the teachings on desire are hidden. The process of “self-consecration”113—the completion stage practices involving subtle channels, subtle energies, and bindu, are cases of the hidden meaning of relative truth. Generally speaking, these teachings are “hidden” because they constitute what is comparable to the very core of something since they bring one to the central position between dualistic extremes. In this regard, the meaning of higher, mid­dling, and lesser degrees with respect to what lies at the core is as explained previously.114"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING- 77(D) The source verses state:The path of utter lucidity and the fruition state of primordial unity constitute the consummate meaning.

[3.119a]The principal topics that are to be evaluated with the foregoing means for evaluating the teachings constitute the treasure house of the precious dharma, what is known in the Mahayana tradition as the “three cycles of the Buddhas word.”In this regard, from among the words of the Buddha, a clear classifica­tion of these three cycles is found in the sutra Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent, which speaks of the first cycle being concerned with the Four Truths, the intermediate cycle with the absence of characteristics, and the final with a thorough and precise analysis of reality. Expansive Gem merely refers to them in passing,118 while the sutra the Discourse Requested by Dhdranisvarardja speaks of them as the mode of the Four Truths, that of emptiness, and that of the very heart of attaining the state of suchness.119 In the Highest Continuumy Lord Maitreya uses the terms “bringing the world to the path of peace,” “bringing complete spiritual maturity,” and “uttering prophecies.”120The exalted Nagarjuna refers to the first cycle as teaching on identity, the intermediate as teaching on the lack of identity, and the final as undermin­ing all bases for dogmas. In commenting on the significance of such termi­nology, the master Aryadeva states that the first cycle undermines all that"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"is not conducive to spiritual merit, the intermediate cycle undermines the [false] sense of identity, and the final cycle undermines all dogmas.As for the ways of analyzing these as provisional or definitive, let us consider the characteristics in general of provisional and definitive sutras. As for the characteristics of a sutra containing provisional meaning, it is a sutra that principally teaches on the relative level of truth, which serves as a means to ensure that the path to the definitive state of excellence can arise in the experience of those who are to be guided along any of the three spiri­tual approaches.121 As for the characteristics of a sutra containing definitive meaning, it is a sutra that principally teaches on the ultimate level of truth, so that the few to be guided who can patiently accept its profound meaning can attain nirvana that is not defined by extremes,122 by meditating on the path to definitive excellence.The classification of these within the three cycles of teachings is twofold: (A) how this is found in the Buddhas word [3.119b] and (B) how this is found in the commentaries on his enlightened intent.123(A) In the first place, according to tht Definitive Commentary on Enlight­ened Intent'.O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, at the deer park of Rsipatana in the region of Varanasi, you first turned the wheel of the dharma, presenting the Four Truths of spiritually advanced beings124 to those who had authentically embraced this spiritual approach. This cycle of teachings is amazing and marvelous, for you turned the wheel in an excellent manner and in a way that had not been done in this world previously by anyone, whether a god or a human being. Nevertheless, this wheel of dharma that you turned, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, is still surpassable, is for the shorter term, is provisional in meaning, and is a context that is open to debate.Then, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, begin­ning with the fact that phenomena have no finite essence, begin­ning with the facts that they have no origination, that they have no cessation, that they are forever a state of peace, and that they are by nature nirvana, you turned the wheel of dharma a second time, by way of speaking about emptiness to those who had au­thentically embraced the Mahayana approach.

This cycle is exceedingly amazing and marvelous; this wheel of dharma that you turned, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, is unsurpassable, is not for the shorter term, is defini­tive in meaning, and is not a context that is open to debate.125 [3.120a]And in the Discourse Requested by Dhdranisvarardja:O children of spiritual heritage, it is thus: Suppose, for example, that someone skilled in the knowledge of gemstones, who knows how to refine them, should take from among such precious stones one that is still totally untreated. He dips it in heavily salted water and rubs it with a piece of haircloth, and so treats it thoroughly. But he does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for following that he dips it in a strong broth of foodstuffs and rubs it with woolen cloth, and so treats it thoroughly. But he does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for following that he dips it in a powerful medicinal solution and rubs it with fine silk and so treats it thoroughly. Once it is totally treated and free of all blemishes, it can then be described as a great specimen of a gemstone.O children of spiritual heritage, in a similar way the Tathagata, knowing the totally impure condition of ordinary beings, uses talk of impermanence, suffering, the nonexistence of identity, and uncleanness to arouse dissatisfaction in those beings who take delight in samsara and to cause them to engage in the disci­pline that is the dharma of spiritually advanced beings. But the8 2. - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANINGTathagata does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for fol­lowing that he uses talk of emptiness, and the nonexistence of subtle traits, and the absence of speculation126 to cause them to realize the ways of the tathagatas. But once more the Tathagata does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for following that he uses talk that constitutes the cycle of nonregression127 and talk of the complete purity of the three focal points to cause these or­dinary beings, whose fundamental temperaments are so various, to engage in the scope of the tathagatas.128(B) In the second place, the foremost among those skilled at comment­ing on the Buddhas enlightened intent129 is his regent Maitreya, who made the following comments on the ultimate meaning of the sutra teachings:130 [3.110b]Initially the teachings are for the purpose of using discussions that are discouraging to urge those to be guided who are fascinated with samsara to enter the path to peace; next, of using discussions of emptiness to completely mature them into the Mahayana approach; and finally, of using discussions from the cycle that ensures no regression131 to cause them to embrace the scope of the tathagatas and obtain the supreme prophecy.132 In one of his synopses, the exalted Asanga cites from the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent to establish that the final cycle of teachings constitutes the consummate level of definitive meaning,133 and Vasubandhu and others are in agreement with this. While Asanga and his brother,134 however, do not state that the intermediate cycle of teachings is provisional in meaning, in the source Reasoning fo r a Detailed Explanation and its commentary, it is explicitly stated to be definitive in meaning.135 The great spiritual guide Dharmapala, in his Decision concerning Conscious Awareness^ explains that both of these cycles concern the definitive meaning of the teachings.The exalted Nagarjuna considers the three stages of refinement referred to in the Discourse Requested by Dharanisvarardja to be from the point of view of definitive meaning, and Aryadeva concurs with this. Among Tibetan teachers, there should be no one who does not agree that this treatment is in accord with the three stages of beginning, middle, and end found in the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent, for in fact such is actually the case.137 Those who upheld the genuine lineage of Maitreya and composed commentaries on these teachings138 in later times did not"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"84 ^ the TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEcontravene this tradition, while Candra,139 in commenting on Nâgârjunas treatise, did not employ the model of three cycles—initial, intermediate, and final—but simply used the analysis on the basis of provisional vis-à- vis definitive meaning as found in the Discourse Taught by Aksayamati.m It would seem that—due to a failure to examine accurately the meaning of the underlying intent of this source—there have occurred cases of Tibetan teachers indulging in a lot of nonsense concerning two cycles (that is, the intermediate and the final), as to which is provisional and which definitive, and which is “higher” or “lower” than the other. In this regard, as was men­tioned earlier,141 this sütra speaks of eight topics that distinguish provisional from definitive meaning. The others142 apply equally to both the intermedi­ate and final cycles of teachings as topics of definitive meaning; [3.111a] as for the eighth topic, however—that of the lack of identity—Candrakirti assigns as the definitive meaning the mere fact that things are empty of both kinds of identity,143 while Asariga, his brother, and their followers analyze this point more precisely and thoroughly, for the point here is that of the lack of any such identity as is construed by spiritually immature people. As the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states:It would be inappropriâte to conceive of things in terms of identity;I have not taught this to spiritually immature people.144And in Angulimâlâ we read such passages as the following:Even though the transcendent and accomplished conquerors investigate all phenomena assiduously, a self in the mundane sense, neither something about the size of one s thumb,145... nor anything that can be described as “it is like this” is found by any of all the buddhas, or by any of all the srâvakas, and once they have awakened to manifest buddhahood, they explain this fact to living beings.146And in the Journey to Sri Lanka\\Teaching concerning the buddha nature [tathagatagarbha] is not equivalent to theories that those who hold extreme views entertain concerning self-identity147 . . . [bodhisattvas] are not obsessed with self-identity.148"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"With a definitive conclusion having been reached concerning the signifi­cance of the foregoing citations, it is shown that the intermediate and final cycles of teaching are equally definitive in meaning, with the distinction that the former concerns the definitive meaning that puts an end to concep­tual elaborations in the shorter term, while the latter concerns that which reveals the true way of abiding in the far-reaching sense.Specific and Detailed Analysis [B]This specific and detailed analysis includes five topics: the common tradi­tion; the tradition of proponents of things having no finite essence;149 the tradition of Yogic Practitioners;150 the connection with the explanations of the Exalted One; and the negation of incorrect opinions concerning provi­sional meaning and the establishment of a single enlightened intent.Common Tradition [1]The source verses state:AJ1 agree that the first cycle is provisional in meaning.Concerning the first cycle of the Buddhas teachings, all proponents of the Mahayana approach agree in professing that it teaches largely on the level of provisional meaning, for they classify it from the point of view of its being primarily concerned with what is relatively valid.Tradition of Proponents of Things Having No Finite Essence [2]The source verses state:Proponents of things having no finite essence opine,“The intermediate cycle is primarily definitive in meaning, the final one largely provisional.” [3.12.1b]They have no actual scriptural authority for this, only proving their rationale through reasoning.Proponents of things having no finite essence are of the opinion, “The intermediate cycle is the consummate degree of definitive meaning, whileUNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 85"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"86 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEthe final cycle presents primarily what is provisionally meaningful/’ There is no actual scriptural authority found in the sutras that makes such an obvious distinction; they prove their rationale through reasoning, using only the most general scriptural citations that distinguish provisional from definitive meaning.Tradition of Yogic Practitioners [3]The source verses state:“The intermediate cycle, putting an end to elaborations, is definitively meaningful in the shorter term; the final cycle, bringing a definitive conclusion concerning what is ultimate, is definitively meaningful in the far-reaching sense.” So says the tradition of Yogic Practitioners.Their scriptural authority is found in the distinctions made by the Victorious One himself, and the further distinctions made by the tradition of the prophesied exalted one, who attained the third level of realization.The reasoning is found by applying the example of refining a gem and so forth.Rangjung, Dolpo, Drime Ozer, and othersprimarily accept this latter interpretation, others the former.The intermediate cycle of teachings—because it puts an end to the con­ceptual elaborations of thinking of the view in terms of absolute princi­ples—is concerned with definitive meaning in the shorter term; while the final cycle—because it clearly brings a definitive conclusion that the true way in which things abide is that of individual self-knowing timeless aware­ness—is concerned with definitive meaning in the far-reaching sense. Such statements are found in the mainstream tradition of Yogic Practitioners, or Yogacara.Their scriptural authorities, as cited previously, are those conferred by the Victorious One himself,151 making such distinctions in his discourses. In addition, in the Discourse o f the Great D rum we read the following:"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING- 87Any and all those discourses that teach on emptiness should be understood to be intentionally interpretable, while such unsur­passable discourses as this one should be understood to be expla­nations that do not require interpretation.152As this passage illustrates, the modes of provisional and definitive mean­ing are analyzed very clearly, over and over again, in the sütras that teach on the buddha nature.In addition, the foregoing is the tradition of one who codified the dis­tinction between provisional and definitive meaning—the exalted Asañga, whose coming was prophesied and who had attained the third level of real­ization—and his brother.153 [3.12,2.a] Their reasoning154 would appear to be that of applying such models of metaphors and their underlying meaning as the threefold refinement of a gem spoken of in the Discourse Requested by Dhdranisvarardja,155From among the masters of the Tibetan tradition, the all-knowing Rangjung Gyalwa, the omniscient Dolpopa, the omniscient Drime Ozer,156 and others, together with their followers, would seem to have professed this latter interpretation.157 The majority of renowned teachers in Tibet were proponents of the former interpretation.158Explanation of the Exalted One [4]As for the connection that the foregoing has with the explanations of the Exalted One,159 the source verses state:In particular, it is explained that the three successive cycles of the dharma— initial, intermediate, and final—undermine, respectively, nonvirtue, the belief in identity, and all bases for dogmatic opinions.In particular, the exalted Nágárjuna and his spiritual heirs160 state:What is nonvirtuous is undermined initially; intermediately, any sense of identity is undermined; and finally, all bases for dogmatic opinions161 are undermined: Whoever understands this is wise.162"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"88- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThus, they say that what is nonvirtuous, the belief in identity, and all bases for dogmatic opinions are what are undermined respectively in the initial, intermediate, and final cycles of teachings; and teachers of the Tibetan tra­dition have also adopted this progressive model of the three turnings of the wheel of the Buddhadharma.In this regard, the first cycle ensures that, by becoming unerringly involved with moral choices of acceptance and rejection on the level of what is rela­tively true, one is more capable of perceiving what is ultimately true. For the purpose of undermining perception based on a sense of identity, the second cycle presents ultimate truth in a quantifiable way, negating one extreme of conceptual elaboration.163 And in order to undermine all bases for dogmatic opinions about existence, nonexistence, and so forth, the third cycle pres­ents ultimate truth in actuality, in the sense that transcends all elaboration.According to this model, then, the intermediate cycle previously dis­cussed is considered by those who profess unqualified emptiness to be the final word;164 this is even accepted by certain of those who profess qualified emptiness. As for the vast majority of those who profess qualified empti­ness, they interpret the undermining of identity in the sense of proving the absence of identity (that is, an absence that is a freedom from conceptual elaboration), and the undermining of all bases of dogmatic opinions in the sense of transcending some emptiness that could be investigated intellectu­ally.165 [3.12.2b] They explain the underlying intent of these cycles166 to be in accord, in keeping with the progression found in the previous two citations from the sutras.167Furthermore, the omniscient Rangjung168 gives the following expla­nation:The cycle of the Exalted One169 (which undermines all dogmas) and the cycle of the venerable Maitreya (who was prophesied by the Buddha), generally speaking, both come down to the same crucial point; for this key point is the fact that if something con­stitutes die final cycle of teachings, of necessity it is a cycle that demonstrates a freedom from conceptual elaboration.In certain particulars, however, these are not identical, for the former does not speak of anything but that freedom from elabo­ration, while the latter explains that timeless awareness, which is free from elaboration, is a particular way in which one’s own individual self-knowing timeless awareness can be experienced."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING- 89But if one were to wonder, “Does that mean that Nagarjuna and his heirs did not accept timeless awareness free of elaboration?” such is not the case because they actually demonstrate this ac­ceptance in such works as the “Collection of Praises” and the Four Hundred Verses for Engaging in a Bodhisattvas Conduct.170Incorrect Opinions and Single Intent [5]As for the dispelling of incorrect opinions concerning provisional meaning and the explanation of a single enlightened intent, the source verses state:Some think of what is provisionally meaningful as untrue, as false, but this is an incorrect opinion, for the Buddha s word entails no falsehoods.Some, who lack the immaculate vision of sublime intelligence, think that everything spoken by the Buddha as provisionally meaningful is false in being unreliable because it is not true from the ultimate perspective. But this is an incorrect opinion due to their own ordinary minds’ being ensnared by myriad layers of delusion. The words of the Buddha never entail any false­hood or deceptiveness because the provisional meaning itself is true, albeit as what is provisionally meaningful, and so leads one in an authentic man­ner toward the profound way in which things actually abide.This being the case, to boast, “I am a follower of die Middle Way!” could be a case of one s implicitly denigrating other aspects of the Buddhas sub­lime words; and to claim, “I am a tan trie practitioner!” could be a case of ones dismissing the repositories of teachings in the sravaka approach and so forth as though these were useless straw. In particular, the lord Mikyo Dorje171 said:Those who claim nowadays to be Nyingmapas, but who do not regard the Buddha Sakyamuni to be their teacher and have never heard of the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlighten­ment [3.123a] are not worthy of inclusion among the ranks of Buddhists!172Therefore, one should examine and investigate the possibility of one s rejecting the Buddhadharma and exercise caution!"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The source verses state:Because it eliminates elaborations concerning the manner in which things appear while actually demonstrating the way things actually abide, the great spiritual guide and others accept that the entire Buddhadharma has a single intent.The ways in which conceptual elaborations on the relative level (the man­ner in which things appear) are eliminated and the ultimate perspective (the way in which things actually abide) is actually demonstrated can be more obvious or more subtle, depending on the audience s specific level of acumen.173 It is for this reason that the great Spiritual guide Nagarjuna and others accept that all avenues of teaching taught by the Victorious One have a single underlying intent. As we read in the Source Verses on Sublime Intel­ligence:The transcendent and accomplished conqueror, understanding what is real and what is not, refuted both existence and nonexistence in his advice to Katyayana.174That is to say, since there is advice concerning freedom from the extremes of existence and nonexistence even in the initial cycle of teachings, all the Buddhas statements concerning the “existence” of things within the range of ones ordinary experience are intended to refer to what merely mani­fests.175Furthermore:“Nirvana, the transcendence of sorrow, alone is true” is what victorious ones say.At that point, would anyone who is wise not think that everything else is false?176That is to say, in the intermediate cycle, everything else—from forms up to and including the state of omniscience177—is false due to being relative and conditioned.178 That these are, in essence, empty of any elaborations is nirvana, which is unconditioned and is taught to be solely what is true.90 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"And from Stages o f Meditation in the Middle Way tradition:Therefore, through pure sublime intelligence this ultimate essence in and of itself is thoroughly ensured as being the case,and so anything else, being imputed, does not have any reality.179Thus, all of Nagarjunas statements on the topic of meditation are in accord with the final cycle of teachings. In particular, he emphasizes the meaning found in that final cycle in his “Collection of Praises,” and in his Commentary on Bodhicitta he discusses the connection between that cycle and the profound meaning of the mantra approach, without these mutually excluding one other.180 [3.12.3b]This is also illustrated by the fact that the exalted and venerable Asanga also states quite clearly:To claim that there is a contradiction between one sutra and an­other sutra is to reject the sacred Buddhadharma.181It is for this reason that the venerable Maitreya emphatically advises one not to misinterpret the tradition of the Sage,182 which was established by the Buddha himself.183 With folded hands, I beseech all to respect this.Two Levels of Truth [II]The classification of the two levels of truth involves two topics: an introduc­tory discussion and the actual classification.Introductory Comments [A]The source verses state:The sacred Buddhadharma was taught on die basis of two levels of truth.However many avenues of the sacred dharma were presented by the Tathagata, these were all spoken on the authentic basis of there being two levels of truth.

The relative and likewise the ultimate; there is not in any sense a third level of truth.185And as the venerable Nagarjuna states in following this citation:The dharma taught by buddhas is authentically based on two levels of truth— the mundane level of relative truth and the level of ultimate truth.186Actual Classification [B]The actual classification is fivefold: the essence, the derivation of the terms, the characteristics and synonyms, a precise analysis, and the value of under­standing these truths.Essence [1]The source verses state:Generally speaking, these are in essence contrived and uncontrived, respectively— that which is imputed by the minds of ordinary beings and the state of spiritually advanced beings in meditative equipoise.Concerning these levels of truth, there are numerous ways in which the individual philosophical systems posit them and identify what they are in essence. But generally speaking, the interpretation of those who follow the Mahayana approach is that relative truth constitutes what is contrived and conceptually imputed, while ultimate truth constitutes what is uncon­trived and not imputed. In particular, thz Entrance to the M iddle Way states (according to the Consequentialist system, the pinnacle for those who pro­fess Buddhist philosophical systems):Due to all things being perceived either authentically or erroneously, [3.124a] any and all things can be taken two ways in essence.92 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING- 93Whatever is the object of authentic perception is ultimate;187 erroneous perception is said to be relative truth.188That is to say, all phenomena—from forms up to and including the state of omniscience—can be thought of in terms of being perceivable in two ways in their nature or essence. Thus, there is the individual makeup189 of things that is detected by the ordinary mind of spiritually immature beings, which engages by taking things at face value, without examining or investi­gating them further; and there is the essence that is discovered by spiritually advanced beings in formal meditative equipoise through nonconceptual timeless awareness.Of these two cases, the former is termed “relative truth.” Due to a lack of recognition—that is, the obscuring of the perception of suchness itself—it is termed “completely overlaid.”190 This level is taken to be true, and as long as one has not realized the significance of suchness itself, this level continues to perform a function that accords with one s misconstruing of it; because it is thus infallible for spiritually immature beings, it can be termed “truth.” For as the same source states:Because ignorance191 obscures the true nature, everything is completely overlaid.Whatever this contrives nevertheless appears to be true, which the Sage said to be “relative truth.”Things that are contrived are on the relative level.192The latter case is termed “ultimate truth.” This is because the state of for­mal meditative equipoise for spiritually advanced beings—that is, noncon­ceptual timeless awareness—can be referred to as “sublime,”193 for it engages with the actual way in which things abide, just as they are, and because that is its domain, and so it is infallible in all ways and in all that is truly mean­ingful, being “truth.”Derivation of Terms [2]The source verses state:As for the derivation of the terms, what is conditioned is true on the relative level itself, while one fact is true on the ultimate level."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"As for the derivation and meaning of the terms for the two levels of truth, due to the rules governing the formation of words in the Sanskrit language, the term “relative” can be explained to be interpreted to mean (i) “obscuring what is authentic”; (2) “gathered together,” or “composite”; (3) “symbolic,” or “conventionally designated”; (4) “all-differentiating”; and (3) “deceptively masking.” [3.124b](1) The term “relative” refers to a lack of recognition that entails afflic­tive mental states and that obscures what is ultimately true—the authentic nature of things. This exerts an influence over the ongoing experience of an individual, such that the conditioned phenomena that manifest in the valid experience of one who is under that influence are “true” in a relative sense, which is why the term applies. The. Entrance to the M iddle Way gives explanations such as the following:Because a lack of recognition194 obscures the true nature, everything is completely overlaid.195(2) The term “relative” means that things that are gathered together196 are ensured only due to their dependent relationships with one another, like a stack of poles leaning against one another, and not due to their very essence.(3) According to Clear Words:Alternatively, “relative” means “symbolic”; it is an equivalent term for “conventional designation” in the mundane context. It is characterized by such factors as verbal descriptions and what is being described, or consciousness and what is known.197(4) In Blazing Logic we read the following:Due to its function of thoroughly differentiating all things— forms and so forth—it is relative.198(5) It is relative due to the fact that it cannot stand up under mental investigation, as the master Haribhadra states:Since it cannot withstand the force of thorough mental investi­gation, it is relative.19994 - THE treasury of know ledge"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"In the case of the one level known as ultimate truth—the “truth of the sacred meaning”—what is actually sacred is the timeless awareness in the ongoing experience of spiritually advanced beings in formal meditative equipoise; what is meaningful is the emptiness that serves as that aware- nesss domain; and truth lies in the fact that this is infallible under any and all circumstances. That is why such terminology is used.A parallel to what is sacred is inferential knowledge based on reasoning; to what is meaningful, the emptiness that is characterized as an unqualified negation, which serves as the domain of that knowledge; to what is truth, the fact that this is infallible in light of the reasoning that involves mental examination and investigation. Again, that is why such terminology is used. This latter aspect is termed the “approximation”200 or “quantifiable aspect of ultimate truth.”201 In treatises of the Middle Way school, all the debate concerning the process of investigating the two levels of truth has taken place on solely the basis of this aspect, for ultimate truth in actuality202 is not something to be investigated with the conceptual thought process.203 [3.125a] Blazing Logic discusses clearly there being, from a conventional perspective, two aspects of the ultimate and their characteristics.Characteristics and Synonyms [3]Concerning the characteristics of, and synonyms for, these levels, the source verses state:The characteristics are those of the objects being either that of a confused consciousness that does not investigate it or that of the unconfused mind of a spiritually advanced being— that is, deceptive or not deceptive.The way in which the subjective perceiver apprehends is either one of confusion or its absence.These levels are presented with many synonymous terms.As for the respective characteristics of these levels, what characterizes relative truth is that it is, in essence, imputed or contrived—a false state of perception, in which the meaningful objects that are discovered are discov­ered in light of a consciousness that is spiritually immature and does not investigate them. What characterizes ultimate truth is that it is, in essence, not imputed or contrived—an authentic state of perception, in which theUNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 95"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"96 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEmeaningful objects that are discovered are discovered in light of the aware­ness of spiritually advanced beings.204 As Mabja Jangchub Tsondrii, the fore­most among the spiritual descendants of Patsap,205 explains:The relative level is the scope of consciousness that is confused and does not investigate things; the ultimate level is the scope of a spiritually advanced being s awareness that is unconfused.206There are many who consider that the mere fact that confusion is involved in one s individual perception of sensory appearances qualifies this as con­sciousness based on confusion. That would mean that inferential knowl­edge based on reasoning definitely was also, but because this is knowledge that involves investigation, the qualifier “does not investigate things” is used to exclude it.207In this present context, however, the criterion for whether an object is true or false lies in its being nondeceptive or deceptive, while the criterion for whether the subjective perceiver is true or false lies in the way it appre­hends, being one of a lack of confusion or one of confusion.As for the synonyms for these levels, due to the styles of individual philo­sophical schools, these are very numerous. According to the Middle Way tradition, to cite from Distinguishing Center and L im it:As for emptiness, in briefsuchness, the final authentic state,the absence of subde traits, the ultimate,and the basic space of phenomena are its synonyms.Because it is nothing other,208 is unerring,.. .209The venerable Vimuktisena, following the sutras, explains that there are eleven synonyms,210 [3.125b] while the master Candraklrti explains that there are many synonyms.211The opposites of the foregoing terms would serve as synonyms for rela­tive truth; in addition, such terms as “merely symbolic level,” “mere label­ing,” “merely imputed level,” “mere conventional designation,” and so forth are used."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Precise Analysis [4]My precise analysis is fivefold: the actual analysis, the reasons underlying the analysis, the determination of the levels of truth as two in number, their unity or separateness; and the positions held by the various philosophical systems.Actual Analysis [a]This involves both a general analysis and a specific analysis of the respective levels.General Analysis [i]The source verses state:Without investigating any foundation for analysis, on the basis of what simply can be known, one can distinguish the way in which things appear from the way they abide—that is, the relative from the ultimate.Generally speaking, the relative is not something that can be known in light of pure awareness, while the ultimate is not something that can be known in light of confusion. However, in the context of things being taken at face value without being examined or investigated further, the sütras speak of what simply can be known as the foundation for an analysis of relative vis-à-vis ultimate. As is said:Concerning what can be known, this amounts quite simply to the two levels of truth.212On this note, as is said in the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence:the mundane level of relative truth and the level of ultimate truth.213UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 97"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"98 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThis means that there are two levels, that of deceptive phenomena, con­stituting relative truth, and that of what is undeceptive, constituting ulti­mate truth; alternatively, the analysis can be into the two levels of relative and ultimate truth on the basis of the way in which things appear and the way in which they abide, respectively.Specific Analysis [ii]For the specific analysis, the source verses state:The way in which things appear is a state of confusion—the perceptions in the minds of ordinary beings; the unconfused state is accepted by most to consist of the path and its fruition.The relative is that of ordinary mortals and the spiritually advanced, or that of mundane people and advanced spiritual practitioners.The ultimate is in essence indivisible but can be analyzed as having three characteristics, or, from the perspective of topics under discussion, sixteen aspects, and so forth.As for the way in which things appear, there are actually two ways, a confused one and an unconfused one. In the first place, that of the con­fused way in which things appear, this consists of any and all ways in which what is based on confusion—sensory appearances, fixated perceptions, and consciousness—occurs in the mind of ordinary beings. Since these are deceptive and untrue, all that manifests such that it can be thought of or described, from hell realms up to buddhahood, [3.126a] is imputed by the designs of the ordinary mind and is not something one can be aware of in any actual sense,214 and for this reason it is explained as being a state of con­fusion. Furthermore, things such as the four elements215 that manifest and are capable of performing a function are considered to be what is relative in an authentic sense, while things such as a hallucination of two moons that manifest but are incapable of performing a function are considered to be what is relative in an erroneous sense.The unconfused way in which things appear is also twofold. The timeless awareness together with its attendant qualities that is experienced on the spiritual path and is not confused with regard to the fruition state is imper­"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"manent due to the fact that it evolves; nevertheless, it is unconfused from the point of view that it leads to the fundamentally unconditioned level of being.216 The unconfused way—due to the fruitions having been attained— consists of the timeless awareness of buddhahood together with the mani­fest expressions of enlightenment217 that abide in the pinnacle pure realm.The foregoing points are by and large posited by the Autonomist school. In this regard, what this school considers to be relative in an authentic sense is posited on the basis of the fact that they hold that one is unconfused about ones own individual perception of sense objects—that is, the direct experience of one s sense faculties in apprehending the forms, sounds, and so forth, that one perceives in ones immediate situation. But those who follow the Consequentialist school hold that these cognitive states are con­fused with respect to one s own individual perception of sense objects, and therefore they do not accept that there is anything relative in any authentic sense—for them, rather, if something is relative, it is erroneous. More recent generations of dialecticians have said that this is a subde point, for the issue hinges on whether or not to hold that things are established due to their specific characteristics.218Alternatively, one can discuss the two aspects of the relative as that of ordinary mortal beings and that of spiritually advanced beings. The first aspect consists of such things as the reflection of die moon in water or an echo because even spiritually immature people can determine these accu­rately as having the qualities of being false and deceptive. The second aspect consists of such things as forms, sounds, and so forth, on which spiritually immature people are completely fixated, because those who perceive what is true for spiritually advanced beings can thoroughly appreciate that these are fallacious, hollow, and lacking in any real substance.As yet another alternative, the teachings speak of an analysis into the relative level for mundane people and the relative level for advanced spiri­tual practitioners. Santideva says:[3.126b] What is relative for advanced spiritual practitioners is without flaw,...219And Candraklrti states:“Being nonexistent due to this seven-step analysis, how could it exist in anyway?”Thus, advanced spiritual practitioners do not find it to exist.220UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 99"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"IOO- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEAs for the basis of what is being defined, the relative level for mundane people constitutes the more obvious things in the phenomenal world, per­ceived in light of confusion, in which things are taken at face value without being examined or investigated further. The relative level for'advanced spiri­tual practitioners constitutes both the appreciation of impermanence on a more subtle level (the meaningful experience discovered by an ordinary mind of conventional values in light of some small degree of examination) and the perceptions experienced in postmeditative awareness by spiritually advanced beings (from those on the path of no more training in the sravaka approach to those on the spiritually advanced levels of the bodhisattva approach).221As for synonyms, the former aspect is also referred to as the relative “of what is not examined,” or “of spiritually immature people,” or “unconnected with knowledge based on reasoning.” The latter aspect is referred to as the relative level “of what is investigated,” or “that entails knowledge based on reasoning for spiritually advanced beings,”222 or “of the follower of the Mid­dle Way.”With respect to what is ultimately true, from the point of view of its essence, this cannot be subjected to any analysis because it is in all ways of “one taste,” like space, and because it transcends the purview of conven­tional designations. In the Amassing o f the Rare and Sublime we read:O monks, this ultimate truth is unique. It is thus: it constitutes nirvana, the transcendence of sorrow, which has the quality of being infallible.223If one analyzes this level in a purely semantic way, a brief treatise on the levels of truth speaks of two aspects of ultimate truth, a quantifiable one and an unquantifiable one.224 The former aspect is free to a certain extent of conceptual elaborations, as in the case of its being “unborn,” which negates its having origination; the latter aspect is free of absolutely all conceptual elaborations.225As for the quantifiable aspect of ultimate truth, if one analyzes it from the perspective of what is being negated, there are two aspects to the lack of identity—in the individual and in phenomena. If one analyzes it from the perspective of characteristics, there are the three avenues to complete liberation—emptiness, the absence of subtle traits, and the absence of naive speculation—or the four avenues (the fourth, its being completely uncon­ditioned). If one analyzes it from the perspective of the topics under discus­"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"sion, there are sixteen aspects of emptiness; the phrase 'and so forth” in the source verse refers to analyses into eighteen or twenty aspects. [3.127a]Reasons Underlying the Analysis [b]As for the reasons underlying this analysis, the source verses state:Due to the difference in the way that the minds of the spiritually advanced and the spiritually immature perceive, and the classification based on mutual dependence,...Thus, the reasons underlying this analysis into two levels of truth derive from the differing ways in which the minds of two kinds of individuals—the spiritually advanced and the spiritually immature—perceive. Therefore, it is from the point of view of the subjective perceiver that truth can be analyzed into two levels not because these abide in any actual sense. For if the relative level abided in any true sense, it would not, in fact, be the relative level; and besides, this would mean that there would be two ultimate truths! For this reason, other than the fact that what is relative does not abide in any ulti­mate sense, there does not exist whatsoever anything “ultimate”226 because the classification that assigns two levels of truth227 is established on the basis of their mutual dependence.Therefore, the statement that “ultimate truth is reality free of limitations, while everything else is relative truth” applies in the representational lan­guage used by those with such fixations; but in the tradition of the Middle Way itself,228 there is nothing whatsoever to be classified on either side, relative or ultimate. For as long as one has not realized the significance of what is ineffable, for that long one is not even a follower of the Middle Way because one has not realized the meaning of the middle way.Certainty of Two Levels [c]The source verses state:... truth is certainly twofold.What is true is certainly to be enumerated as twofold—what is relatively true and what is ultimately true, as we read in the Journey to Sri Lanka:UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 101"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"There is the relative and the ultimate;there is no third alternative born of some cause.The relative is imputed by concepts;the exhaustion of that is the domain of the spiritually advanced.229And according to the Reunion o f Father and Son:Thus, the Tathàgata has thoroughly mastered the relative and the ultimate. The knowable amounts to this as well—relative and ul­timate truth.230The logic behind this, moreover, is as follows: The relative level, which emphasizes the principle of skillful method, is indispensable for making moral choices of what to undertake or avoid; whereas the ultimate level is indispensable for the nonreferential state of complete purity, [3.127b] which is foremost among all that is to be undertaken. This being the case, allowing for any fewer levels of truth would not take account of the situa­tion, while these alone ensure the welfare of a given spiritual practitioner in its entirety because any inore levels are unnecessary. Alternatively, it is certain that the minds that are the subjective perceivers of things are of two kinds, confused and unconfused. The relative level is assigned with respect to the former case, while the ultimate level is assigned with respect to the latter case. This classification is indispensable, and so it is certain that there are two levels of truth.Two Levels of Truth: Identical or Separate? [d]The source verses state:Conventionally, this is one nature with separate facets; ultimately, there can be no discussion of being identical or separate.Regarding the way in which these levels of truth are identical or separate, the philosophical schools hold their individual and disparate positions. However, according to the glorious Rangjung:Concerning the two levels of truth explained thus, this itself is simply the way things are—phenomena and the true nature of those phenomena—and so completely free of any other consid­102 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING- 103eration, so there is nothing whatsoever to be discussed concern­ing these being identical or separate.231This means that it can be accepted that, in light of ones not having investigated the issue, on a purely conventional level, the two levels of truth constitute a single nature with separate facets, while from the ultimate per­spective, there can be no discussion whatsoever of their being identical or separate in essence.That is to say, if they were identical, this would entail many problems. Spiritually immature people would realize ultimate truth just as they do relative truth, because the situation would require that they gain freedom without any effort. As well, if the relative were, like the ultimate, not sub­ject to any division, this would require that it be the cause of the state of complete purity; or if the ultimate were like the relative, this would require that it be subject to myriad divisions and be a framework for the increase of deeply ingrained afflictive states.If they were separate, this situation would require that even though advanced spiritual practitioners had realized the ultimate they would never­theless be incapable of eliminating their overt fixations on the relative level and that this ultimate level could not be the true nature of the relative. This would entail many such issues that make the possibility invalid.It is for the foregoing reasons that the Definitive Commentary on Enlight­ened Intent states:The characteristics of the realm of ordinary mental states232 and the ultimate are the characteristics of being free of being identical or separate. [3.118a] Those who conceive of them as either identi­cal or separate have fallen into fallacious ways of thinking.233Positions Held by Philosophical Systems [e]Concerning the positions held by individual philosophical systems, the source verses state:If something is destroyed or broken down, the concept of it can be either discarded or not. More obvious things and streams of consciousness are relative, while what is indivisible is ultimately true. This is the tradition of the Particularist school."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"104 ~THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEGenerally speaking, the classification of two levels of truth is something that is accepted by all Buddhist philosophical schools. Of these, followers of the srávaka approach234 say:Whatever can be dismantled or mentally dissected such that the mind no longer entertains a concept— such as a vase or water—exists on the relative level;Anything else exists on the ultimate level.235This means that if something is dismantled by an instrument of destruc­tion such as a hammer or if it is mentally dissected to eliminate individually all extraneous material factors, such that the mind no longer entertains the concept of that thing that is capable of being done away with, then that thing—such as a vase, or the water it contains—is relative. When the mind still entertains something after attempts to dismantle or mentally dissect it, and it still presents itself to one s consciousness as something autono­mous—as with such things as perceived forms, sounds, and so forth—this is ultimate. Both cases, however, are considered “truth,” given that the things concerned exist with their respective essential qualities.To summarize, the followers of the Particularist school hold that substan­tial things of the more obvious kind and ongoing streams of consciousness are relative, while indivisible moments of consciousness and indivisible par­ticles of matter are ultimately true.236The source verses state:Things that are ultimately able to perform functions or not, which are characterized as specifics or generalities—this is the tradition of the Followers of the Sütras.According to the Detailed Commentary:Whatever is ultimately capable of performing a function, that exists ultimately in this context.Anything else exists relatively.These are held to be specifically or generally characterized, respectively.237Things that are capable of performing functions in an ultimate sense (such as a vase or a pillar) constitute ultimate truth, while things that are"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING- 105ultimately incapable of performing a function (such as space, or the generic idea of “vase,” or the generic idea of “pillar”) constitute relative truth. To put it concisely, these categories are held to correspond to those of things existing with specific characteristics versus those existing only with general characteristics; [3.128b] and “to exist” is held to mean “to be true.” This is the tradition of the Followers of the Sutras, or Sautrantikas.238Some more recent scholars explain that in this tradition the terms “ulti­mately true,” “impermanent,” “substantial thing,” “conditioned thing,” and “specifically characterized thing” are synonymous, while “relatively true,” “permanent,” “nonsubstantial phenomenon,” “unconditioned thing,” and “generally characterized thing” are synonymous.239The source verses state:Dualistic experiences of perceived and perceiver, of objects and perceiving subject, are considered as actually being nondual consciousness. This is the tradition of the Mind Only school.The perceived objects and perceiving subjects experienced by dualistic consciousness constitute relative truth, while nondualistic consciousness only is considered to constitute ultimate truth: such is the tradition of the Mind Only, or Cittamatra, school. The Anthology on the Heart Essence o f Timeless Awareness states:“Nothing with facets exists;240even minute material particles are not existent.241Perceptions of individual things, moreover, are like dream images,experienced242 in a state without any fixed point of reference.Consciousness free of object-subject dualismis held to be what has ultimate meaning.”In the vast range of sources for Yogic Practitioners, those who follow the approach of the transcendent perfections expound in such language.243If we tie this in with the three principles, things that are imputed are rela­tive in the true sense of the term because they are nonexistent as anything substantial and are determined to be merely conventional designations.244 Things that are dependent constitute the quantifiable aspect of what is ulti­mate in the true sense of the term, and the quantifiable aspect of the relative"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"because (respectively) they can be determined to have true existence if they are examined in the light of reason and because they obscure ones percep­tion of suchness itself245 What is absolute constitutes the ultimate in the true sense of the term because it is the domain for the timeless awareness of spiritually advanced beings.246The source verses state:Sensory appearances, which are proven to be relative, are similar to illusions,while what is ultimate, like space, cannot be found to exist. This is the tradition of the Autonomist school.All that appears as it does, which is proven to be relative, constitutes relative truth, like horses and elephants in an illusionists trick. What is ultimate, which—like space—cannot be found to exist in any way whatso­ever, is accepted as ultimate truth. This is the tradition of the Svatantrika, or Autonomist, school. [3.129a] In Overcoming Confusion, we read the fol­lowing:What involves a frame of reference is relative; in the ultimate, there is freedom from anything to focus on and any attempt to focus.247The analysis of the relative level according to this system is as discussed earlier.248The source verses state:What is imputed by ordinary consciousness is relative (accepted in accord with what is commonly accepted in the world), while freedom from conceptual elaboration is beyond imagination or expression. This is the tradition of the Consequentialist school.Things that are imputed by ordinary consciousness as describable, imag­inable, and expressible constitute relative truth; these are accepted in accord with whatever is known through being commonly accepted in the world.249 The fundamentally unconditioned nature that is free of all such description, imagination, and expression constitutes ultimate truth. This is the traditionIO6 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"of the Prasangika, or Consequentialist school; as Candraklrti states:With respect to the arousal of a frame of mind that is in accord with emptiness, this can be referred to as “realizing emptiness,” but it does not constitute the realization of emptiness.250Otherwise, this would be similar to ones realization that the nature of space is one of providing a dimension of openness meaning that space itself and one s ordinary mind had become inseparable. In this context, the omni­scient Drime Ozer remarks in his commentary to his own Finding Ease in the Nature o f M ind ItselfIn this context, let us analyze this clearly and in accordance with the pith instructions: Within the unique scope of the basic space of phenomena as the basis for this analysis, the manifest aspect of sensory appearances is similar to an illusion, or a mirage, or the reflection of the moon in water. That is, the nature of these ap­pearances is that of being apparent yet nonexistent per se, and so we call this “relative truth.” As is stated in the sutra tht Discourse Requested by Druma:Just as the clear image of one s face appears in the flawless surface of a mirror, so too, O Druma, know that phenomena cannot be found to have any independent nature.251According to what such sources say, even though an ordinary being perceives sensory appearances as though they were so very true, an advanced spiritual practitioner sees them with no such conviction, but merely as dream images. [3.129b] Being merely indeterminate yet vividly apparent, if these are not investigated, they manifest, but if investigated are known to be wholly nonex­istent; this is termed “realization of relative truth,” which is not undermined by the influence of those sensory appearances.If this realization becomes further refined, this ensures such miraculous powers as ones being able to pass without impedi­ment through these appearances252 and so forth. Without ones committing oneself to any opinion about these whatsoever,253 these very appearances have no independent nature, and so one sUNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 107"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"mind becomes trained in the fact that they have no separate sta­tus as “true.”Once one has gained the timeless awareness of a spiritually advanced being, even though pure realms of experience254 and so forth manifest, one has no fixation on these as being truly exis­tent, and so they constitute what is called “valid on the relative level.” All concepts and perceptions that involve attitudes of fix­ating on things as truly existent constitute what is erroneous on the relative level. I hold that what is valid on the relative level is all avenues for the arising of awareness and all perceptions where these do not involve fixation on the seemingly true existence of things.As for what is ultimate, this constitutes the way in which mind itself truly abides, without any independent nature, and inner mastery of the experience of all phenomena without any fixation on their seemingly true existence—their nature rather being like that of the reflection of the moon in water—so that one understands them in essence as having no independent na­ture, merely manifesting without there being any fixed basis to support perception based on confusion. Once such concepts as “exists” and “does not exist” have vanished in basic space, it is said that one has “realized the ultimate way in which things truly abide.” As is said in In Praise of the Mother by Râhula:Indescribable, inconceivable, and inexpressible, the tran­scendent perfection of sublime intelligence is unborn, unceasing, the very essence of space, yet experienced as the domain of ones individual self­knowing timeless awareness—I pay homage to the mother of victorious ones of the three times.255Thus, it is accepted that one s individual self-knowing timeless awareness is what is ultimate and that to realize this constitutes the realization of ultimate truth.In this regard, the two levels of truth are not separate from one another, like an animal’s horns, even as the way in which what is relative truly abides is perceived to be comparable to the reflec­tion of the moon in water: from the point of view of the mani-Io8 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"festation of the moons image, there is the relative, while from the point of view of the moon’s having no true existence,256 there is the ultimate. [3.130a] Just as these two aspects are in essence identical, even as what does not exist nevertheless manifests in the water of a pond, these levels of truth are inseparable, or a primordial unity. A mind that has realized this257 to be the case is said to have “realization of the two levels of truth.”258The source verses state:The imputed and the dependent are relative; the ultimate is the absolute—self-knowing timeless awareness. This is the tradition of qualified emptiness.What is imputed and what is dependent constitute relative truth, while the ultimate is considered to be what is absolute—self-knowing timeless awareness: this is the tradition of those who profess the Middle Way inter­pretation of zhentong, or qualified emptiness.In this regard, the omniscient Dolpopa259 maintained that what is imputed has no true existence even on the relative level (being comparable to dream images) and what is dependent has true existence in a merely con­ventional sense, while the absolute is constant, stable, and truly existent. The interpretation of Serdok Panchen260 accords with the position of the Mind Only school in the two former cases261 and that of Dolpopa in the latter case. I will discuss the interpretation of the venerable Rangjung, Lord of Victorious Ones,262 later.As for that of the great and venerable one of Jonang,263 all phenomena subsumed within the perceptions of dualistic consciousness—substantial and nonsubstantial things, perceived objects and perceiving subject, and so forth—are relative, while he considers self-knowing awareness (that is, the basic space of ultimate reality, timeless awareness empty of such dualism) to be what is ultimate. Thus, he does not consider the ultimate to constitute simply a freedom from elaboration but rather considers it to constitute pure awareness devoid of the elaborations of dualistic consciousness of object and subject. Therefore, concerning the three principles Taranatha states, while the dependent constitutes consciousness that entails perception based on confusion, the imputed constitutes'the confusion that manifests to that consciousness, and the absolute is that consciousness, empty of theUNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 109"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"n o- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEconfusion imposed by subject-object dualism but not empty of being, in, essence, self-knowing awareness. And so what is imputed, other than con­stituting what is assigned on the basis of symbolic and conventional desig­nations, has no status whatsoever as anything existent; what is dependent exists in the relative sense but does not exist ultimately; and what is absolute exists in the ultimate sense. [3.130b] In this, Taranátha aligns himself with the enlightened intent of Dolpopa.The source verses state:In the mantra approach, there is further embellishment due to its special features.In particular, the relative consists of the appearances that manifest to dualistic consciousness,which are described as being apparent yet without true existence, like the reflection of the moon on water.The ultimate is the essence of things, emptiness in its eighteen aspects;the truth of this is nondual timeless awareness.The way of interpreting the two levels of truths in the mantra approach is explained as being one that is based on the Middle Way view of these truths, further embellishing this with special features, such as that of viewing sense objects and the perceiving subject as the circle of the mandala and as a state of supreme bliss. The master Jñánapáda264 speaks of the view of “profound and lucid nonduality.”265In this regard, the relative constitutes samsára—an adventitious mani­festation of what is actually nonexistent, like a mottled rope being misper- ceived to be a snake; the ultimate consists of mind as a profound and lucid state of nonduality, analogous to the actual rope.266 For a mind that entails confusion, samsára is comparable to the purely adventitious consciousness that mistakenly perceives the mottled\" rope to be a snake, while nirvanas becoming fully evident is comparable to that adventitious consciousness’s being dispelled, so that the perception of a snake is invalidated, and the actual nature of the rope is seen. The fact that the ordinary mind of samsára is by nature nirvána is analogous to the fact that the rope is by nature not a snake, but remains with its own properties.The very fact that samsára has no independent nature of its own means"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"that it is by its actual nature nirvana, and this means that the profound nature of samsara and the lucid and unceasing quality of what is simply the manifestation of samsara constitute what is, by nature, the mandala of the support and what is supported.267 As for the consciousness to which this clearly manifests, given that its nature is one of supreme and uninterrupted bliss, the lucid aspect of that nature is nirmanakaya, while the supremely blissful aspect of that nature is sambhogakaya. While these aspects consti­tute a lucidity, these two are acknowledged to abide as a primordial unity, similar to that of a mirror and the mirror s clarity.In particular, the venerable and omniscient Rangjung gives the following interpretation: [3.131a]Relative \\kun rdzob] refers to the perceptions that manifest to dualistic consciousness; while not existing in actuality, these are imputed by the conceptual process—the manifestations of the anifnate and inanimate universe and so forth; truth \\bden pa] refers to the fact that, while all of this manifests, it has no inde­pendent nature, being like the reflection of the moon in water.Thus there is a nominal truth in what is meaningful to a con­fused mind.Ultimate [don dam pa] refers to emptiness as the actual nature of things—that is, emptiness of what is internal and the rest of the eighteen aspects of emptiness that are discussed; while truth [ibdenpa] describes naturally occurring timeless awareness, which entails none of the dualism of subject and object; this awareness is present in the ultimate sense.263In this respect, the meaning of this discussion is as expressed in the glori­ous tantra Compendium o f the Vajra o f Timeless Awareness-.The enlightened intent concerning the two levels of truth is as follows: there is the truth of what is relative and the truth of what is ultimately meaningful. O children of spiritual heritage, the relative consists of the inanimate269 and the animate; the truth of that is like the reflection of the moon in water. What is ultimate­ly true consists of the eighteen aspects of supreme emptiness; the limit of that is one of abiding.2'0UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - III"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"112 —THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEValue of Understanding These Truths [5]As for the value of understanding these truths, the source verses state:Knowing the foregoing, one is undeluded concerning the words of the Sage,puts the skillful means of moral choices—what to accept or reject—into practice, and beholds the significance of what derives from those means, reaching the far shore of samsára.Thus, if one does not understand the way in which the two levels of truth are present, one does not understand their profound suchness. But through understanding them, one becomes undeluded concerning the unerring top­ics that constitute the meaning of the words spoken by the Lord of Sages.271 So, becoming learned with respect to what is relatively true, one is aware of the skillful methods involved in all moral issues—what to accept and what to reject—in their entirety and applies this in a practical manner. And having realized what is ultimately true, one is aware of that which derives from those skillful methods—that is, nirvana as defined in any of the three spiritual approaches,272 which is totally pure by nature and entirely free of all adventitious distortions—and so reaches the level beyond samsára, that of supreme nirvana that is not confined to any extreme. As we read in the Two Levels o f Truth:Those who understand the differentiation of the two levels of truth are undeluded concerning the words of the Sage.They are those who augment all spiritual qualities without exceptionand reach the far shore of excellence.273 [3.131b]Investigating the Process of Interdependent Connection [III]The examination of the process of interdependent connection is threefold: interdependent connection with respect to the fundamentally uncondi­tioned nature, interdependent connection with respect to samsára, and interdependent connection with respect to nirvána."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Interdependent Connection: The Fundamentally Unconditioned Nature [A]The source verses state:The totally pure nature of the foregoingis the way in which things are fundamentally unconditioned— interdependent connection free of limiting extremes.The totally pure nature of the foregoing—the relative and the ultimate, or samsara and nirvana—is the process of interdependent connection with respect to the way in which things are fundamentally unconditioned, or the ground of being, and that moreover is free of all limitation imposed by conceptual elaborations. The true nature of the universe of appearances and possibilities (whether of samsara or nirvana), its actual nature, is such that nothing has come from anywhere whatsoever, goes anywhere whatso­ever, or abides anywhere whatsoever. Given that objects in the phenomenal world are sustained by their true nature, even as these phenomena appear as though originating and ceasing, they are free of all limitations due to origi­nation, duration, and cessation, and so their nature is said to be that of the middle way. According to the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence:Whatever occurs through being connected interdependently is explained as being emptiness.This is designated contingently;this itself is the path of the middle way.274The foregoing statements are not at odds with utterly lucid timeless awareness275 (which is beyond the domain of interdependent connection). This is because even though it transcends the domain of the relative level of conventional designations, what is itself ultimate manifests as the nature of that level and because the former276 constitutes the definitive meaning, while the latter277 is a classification based on conventional designations.Interdependent Connection: Samsara [B]The source verses state:UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 113"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"114- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEWhat occurs dependently, externally and internally, constitutes the interdependent connection of samsara.That which arises in the usual progression—originating in dependence on causes and conditions, whether external or internal—is termed “the interdependent connectedness of samsara.” To explain the significance of this a bit, there are two considerations: the connection with causes and the connection with conditions.Of the two aspects of the process, the external and the internal, the exter­nal aspect of interdependent connectedness that involves connection with causes is as follows: From a seed through a seedling and on to the fruit, the situation remains such that without one, the next does not occur. Even though there is no conscious deliberation—“I will produce this” or “I was produced by that”—on the part of these factors, if the causes are present, the results will occur. [3.132a]Second, as for the external aspect of interdependent connectedness that involves connection with conditions, the earth element serves the func­tion of supporting the seed; water, of moistening it; fire,278 of maturing it; air, of stimulating its growth; space, of ensuring that this proceeds without impediment; and time, of allowing the seed to change. Thus, even though these six elements and the seed have no conscious deliberation vis-à-vis one another, the situation remains such that without a given factor, another will not occur. None of the foregoing factors is created by the things themselves, or by any other thing, or by a powerful creator god, or by time. They neither occur by their very nature, nor are they causeless. Rather, through the com­ing together of the elements, once the seed ceases, the seedling is ensured.This external aspect of the process of interdependent connection is not one of permanent things. Moreover, the seed and the seedling are not one and the same, for the seedling is not produced by whether or not the seed ceases, because the cessation of the seed and the occurrence of the seedling are simultaneous events. Nor is this aspect of the process one of a nihilistic void, for the cessation of the seed and the occurrence of the seedling are like the rise and fall of a balance. Nor is it a case of transference, because the seed is one thing and the seedling is another.279 In addition, a small cause can ensure a large result, such as the case of the seed of a banyan and the actual tree.280 There is a continuity of like type, for it is impossible for the relation­ship of cause to effect to become random.Of the two considerations for the internal aspect of the process of inter­"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"dependent connectedness, that which involves connection with causes con­stitutes the process from ignorance up to and including aging and death.281 Although there is no agent involved, and these factors have no conscious deliberation vis-à-vis one another, as long as there is a cause, the correspond­ing result occurs.The internal aspect of interdependent connectedness that involves con­nection with conditions is as follows: With the coming together of the six elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness, these serve their functions (from earth providing solidity to space providing the cavi­ties and orifices of the body),282 ensuring the formation of the “seedling” of the mind-body complex in a manner similar to a stack of spears.283 With the coming together of the six avenues of ordinary consciousness,284 there is consciousness. Although the body is formed with the coming together of all of these factors, there is no agent involved, and these factors have no conscious deliberation vis-à-vis one another, but the situation remains that their nature is such that when a factor is absent another does not occur. Moreover, none of these factors—from earth to the coordinating function of mind—is something with identity, [3.132b] or an ordinary being, or a life force, or a life form, or a member of the human race, or a human being. There is neither a woman, nor a man, nor even an androgyne. There is nei­ther a self nor anyone else.In this regard, one has the impression that these six elements constitute a single thing; or a unit; or something permanent, stable, and standing on its own; or something satisfying; or anything from an ordinary being up to a human being285 or an “I.” These and other such aspects of unknowing are termed “ignorance,” because this constitutes a greatly benighted state and because there is a lack of understanding of suchness and an erroneous con­cept of it.With that serving as the cause, the three patterns of attachment, aver­sion, and delusion occur; due to the influence of ignorance, there is “form a­tive karmic patterning,” given that such patterning becomes fully evident. Because this patterning gives rise to specific expressions of consciousness that lead toward states that are meritorious, nonmeritorious, or neutral, there are three aspects to this patterning.This gives rise to consciousness that is cognizant of individual types of things; this constitutes the six avenues of consciousness. Occurring con­comitantly with these are the four aggregates—of forms, sensations, per­ceptions, and formative factors—that perpetuate cyclic existence.

Further fixation on those brings compul­sion, because there is deeply rooted attachment and fixation. The increase of this brings perpetuation, because the causes of those sensations are per­petuated. The perpetuation of those brings about involvement in condi­tioned existence, because it leads to actually taking rebirth in conditioned existence once again. From this come the mind-body aggregates—that is to say, rebirth—because one is reborn into whatever state of existence is appro­priate. [3.133a] Once rebirth has taken place, the maturation of the mind- body aggregates brings aging, and their destruction brings death; these two factors are combined as one—aging and death. On account of that, there is sorrow due to attachment, because this gives rise to inner torment; verbal expressions of grief due to that; suffering due to the experience of unhappi­ness ; mental anguish due to dis tressing states of mind; and so forth: second­ary afflictive states render the mind completely turbulent.These twelve links neither constitute anything from a self or an individ­ual up to and including something that is “mine”288 nor belong to anyone else. They are neither permanent nor impermanent, neither conditioned nor unconditioned. They are neither acausal and aconditional, nor do they exist as agents of experience. Nor are they phenomena that become exhausted, are subject to destruction, or cease to exist. They have, however, played out continuously throughout beginningless time due to other causes and other conditions; they have played out in succession without interrup­tion, like the flow of a river.These twelve links can also be subsumed under four categories: (1) karma, because it is like a fertile field; (2) ignorance, because it is like the sower of a seed; (3) compulsion, because it “moistens” like water; and (4) conscious­ness, because it is like the seed. While consciousness as the seed is ensuredII6 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING- 117by these conditions, there is no agent involved, and these factors have no conscious deliberation vis-a-vis one another and do not constitute anything from a self up to and including something that is “mine.” Nevertheless, if the “seed” of consciousness is supported by the “field” of karma, moistened by the “water” of compulsion, and planted by the “sower” of ignorance, it per­petually takes rebirth in wombs. But no one at all causes this to happen; it does not come about without cause; and it does not “come” from anywhere. All the same, when conditions come together—the cells of the father and mother uniting, the disembodied consciousness289 entering, and so forth— the “seedling” of the mind-body complex forms in the womb. This, too, does not constitute anything from a self up to and including something that is “mine.” It is not some subjective agent; rather, it is analogous to space, having as its nature that which characterizes an illusion.Visual consciousness, too, comes about due to five causal factors: (1) the eye serves to provide the support, (2) forms, to provide the frame of reference, (3) illumination, to provide the cause for clear perception, (4) space, to ensure that there is no physical obstruction, [3.133b] and (5) the mental focus that gives rise to this consciousness, to perform the function of cognition. Although these factors bring about visual consciousness, that visual consciousness is not an agent, and it does not have any conscious deliberation, being like an illusion. The same is true for the other avenues of consciousness.Therefore, although it is indeed the case that no phenomenon whatso­ever passes into some future state, and no phenomenon whatsoever comes from some past state, once the coming together of causes is complete within the context of a state of confusion, things appear as though they have passed forward from past states and are produced in future states. But in the case of all these phenomena, that situation is like that of ones face appearing in a mirror even though it is not transferred to the mirror, or like the reflected image of the moon, which moves forty-two thousand yojanas above in the sky,290 appearing in a vessel of water on the earth s surface, or like the burning that occurs if the causes and conditions for fire come together.As well, this internal process of interdependent connection is not some­thing permanent, for the mind-body aggregates at the final moment of death are one thing and those that are then born are another. Nor is this process a nihilistic void, for the aggregates that are born do not occur due to whether or not those at the final moment of death cease; rather the cessation of the"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"aggregates at death and the occurrence of the aggregates at birth are like the rise and fall of a balance. Nor this is a case of transference, because the rebirth that takes place can be that of a different type of being.291 In addi­tion, a small cause can give rise to a large result, such as the case of a single moment of an extremely malicious attitude propelling the mind toward rebirth in a hell state, or a loving attitude of short duration propelling it toward rebirth as a king among the Brahma gods. There is a continuity of like type because results are experienced according to actions committed.These processes are discussed in the Journey to Sri Lanka:O Mahamati, just as a pot comes from a lump of clay, so too a blanket comes from yarn, thick cloth from carded wool, seed­lings from seeds, and butter from human efforts such as churning and from curds, so too, O Mahamati, the external aspect of the process of interdependent connection occurs such that what is later comes from what is earlier.... As for the internal aspect of the process of interdependent connection, [3.134a] it is as fol­lows: ignorance, compulsion, karma, and such phenomena as these are given the name “interdependent connection.”292In summary, the initial failure to recognize one s own self-knowing time­less awareness constitutes a supreme state of ignorance. From that comes the formative karmic patterning for conditioned existence, leading to con­sciousness and all the way down to aging and death, these occurring in an uninterrupted succession, which each relying on the last, as is stated in Let­ter to a Friend:From ignorance comes karma,293 from thatconsciousness, and from that the mind-body complex fully forms. From that come the six sense fields, and from them, said the Sage, contact occurs in all situations.From contact come all sensations.From sensations as a basis comes compulsion.Compulsion brings about perpetuation;from that comes the process of becoming, and from becoming, rebirth.Il8 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Once there is rebirth, there is sorrow, illness, aging, feeling poverty-stricken due to desires, death, destruction, and so forth— a huge amassing of suffering comes about.294With respect to these aspects of the process of interdependent connec­tion, the expression “coming from causes” is used from the point of view that what is later comes from what is earlier, while the expression “coming from conditions” is used due to there being a process of giving rise to things from the point of view of the coming together of six elements—earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness—on the internal level.I have previously discussed to a small extent the particular ways in which this process is interpreted in the Hlnayana and Mahayana teachings—of it forming a continuum over one, two, or three lifetimes and so on; of how it is complete in any given instant; and so forth.The foregoing constitutes what is called “the usual progression, the inter­dependent connectedness of samsara.”Interdependent Connection: Nirvana [C]The source verses state:Whoever beholds the interdependent connection of nirvana— the reversal of the usual progression— has access to the key points of the Buddhas speech; therefore realize the significance of these through dedicated contemplation.Interdependent connection with respect to nirvana, which is the reversal of the usual progression, has two considerations: the path and the fruition state.In the first place, as for the spiritual path, [3.134b] given that ignorance is the root of the usual progression of the twelve links that constitute inter­dependent connection with respect to samsara, this is removed by pure and timeless awareness. Through becoming familiar with the evolution of sublime intelligence through studying teachings to contemplating them to meditating on them, one removes the initial root factor, that of ignorance.UNDERSTANDING TRUTH AND MEANING - 119"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Once that has been removed, the other factors that depend on it are suc­cessively removed. When the causes for engaging further in conditioned existence have come to an end, one moves beyond the state of samsara. Let­ter to a Friend states:With the stopping of rebirth, all of this stops.295In this regard, since advanced spiritual practitioners who wish to attain liberation have not reinforced the karmic causes that sustain samsara, any future result of samsara does not come about because formative karmic pat­terning has stopped. This is why it is said:The root of samsara is formative patterning; therefore, the wise do not engage in such patterning.296As for interdependent connection with respect to the fruition state, this is the fact that the benefit that buddhas ensure for ordinary beings takes place in the manner of a dream or an illusion. That is to say, whoever beholds the fact that all phenomena simply occur through a process of interdepen­dent connection does not view things as self, or other, or existent, or non­existent, and does not conceive in terms of the limitations imposed by the three phases of linear time. They are not involved with such views as the atman theory of Brahmanical practitioners, and so have uprooted belief in the reality of the perishable mind-body aggregates. Those for whom objects in the phenomenal world are unborn and unceasing have access to the key points of the limidess collections of teachings that are the speech of the Buddha; therefore, having thoroughly assimilated the meaning of these as true, they also have access to the state of all-seeing enlightenment. The Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence state:For those who behold that things occur in interdependent connection, suffering and its all-pervasive origin stop, and they behold the spiritual path.297Thus, having contemplated in a dedicated manner these two levels of truth and the way in which things occur through interdependent connec­tion, [3.135a] one should not leave it at following a path of studying teach­120 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"ings, but rather should truly realize the significance of these topics.

It is this intelligence diat ensures that one s view is totally pure and that one gains the most excellent degree of perspicacity concerning what is definitively meaningful.In order for that to become fully evident, moreover, one is aware that one must apply the aspect of skillful means in a practical manner and in every way possible. By one s truly engaging in such means, one s conduct becomes totally pure, and this awakens in one the most excellent degree of perspicac­ity concerning what is provisionally meaningful.In this way, ones totally pure view and conduct are integrated, not becoming divorced from one another. And so, it is said, one swiftly gains access to the bliss of complete freedom. [3.135b]The source verses state:In particular, because all the teachings spoken by the Victorious Oneare directed toward, and come down to, the basic space of phenomena,initially one should come to a definitive understanding of the view.Having properly understood the flawed attitudes of erroneous opinions, one discards thesewhile seeking out and accepting what is definitively meaningful as one s authentic view.Moreover, of the two—view and conduct—the former is especially important. All of the limitless collections of teachings spoken by the Vic­torious One, whether of provisional or definitive meaning, are entirely directed toward, and come down to, the basic space of phenomena. And so, for one to seek out the authentic view—that which accords with this iact—through the eye of sublime intelligence becomes the direct cause for one s gaining the experience of that basic space. Initially, then, one should come to a definitive understanding of the true and abiding nature of this view./As we read in Letter to a. Friend:Even though individuals with erroneous opinions may conduct themselves well,they will endure all manner of intolerable results.299AUTHENTIC VIEW - 12.5"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThus, erroneous opinions, which conflict with the authentic view, together with anything associated with them, constitute the source of all flaws and faults. Initially, then, one should use the minds powers of thor­ough discernment, relying on scriptural authority and reasoning, to under­stand the role of such opinions and, having gained certainty about this, one should discard them.In this respect, non-Buddhist doctrines based on naïve affirmation or nihilistic denial, 300 and even Buddhist schools that profess materialist tenets,301 are subject to the flaw of philosophical absolutism. The authen­tic view, therefore, lies entirely with the Middle Way path. So one should accept the profound and flawless definitive meaning of the mainstream tra­ditions of the two “charioteers,”302 seeking these out with a perspicacity that does not fall into any extreme, marshaling the forces of good by reinforcing ones merit, and striving with the sublime intelligence that derives from the threefold process of studying, contemplating, and meditating on teachings.The Way to Develop Sublime Intelligence [II]In referring to the process of developing this intelligence, the source verses state:With ignorance serving as the cause, the belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates is the false perception of identity, which is the root of four mistaken ideas.The remedy to this is to develop sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of identity.With ignorance serving as the cause, [3.136a] there ensues the “belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates.” That is, due to the deluded attitude that completely fails to understand that the collection of the mind-body aggregates has no identity, there develops the confused belief in the reality of these aggregates, that they constitute some identity.While this belief is a mode that is perceived as a clear image in the mind,303 ignorance is an unclear impression without any such differentiation whatso­ever. So these two modes304 are in contradiction with respect to the impres­sion they present and the way the mind perceives them. Therefore, while ignorance does not, in actuality, develop from this belief, it nevertheless"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"develops through the force of the potential that derives from habituation to this mistaken attitude—belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates.305Furthermore, this belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, when analyzed with respect to the three realms, functions in three ways. The belief as it is experienced within the states of the realm of desire constitutes an entirely negative influence, whereas the belief as it is experienced within the states of the two higher realms constitutes a karmically neutral obscura­tion.306The belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates is synonymous with “false perception of identity,” which is the root of four mistaken ideas. These four are: misperceiving what is impure to be pure; misperceiving what is productive of suffering to be pleasurable; misperceiving what is imperma­nent to be permanent; and misperceiving what has no identity to have iden­tity. With the first three of these being accessories to the false perception of identity, these ideas all serve as the basis, or root, as it were, of all thought patterns that derive from mistaken perceptions.In general, the term “identity”307 is the equivalent of the Sanskrit atmaka,. If this term is interpreted in the broadest sense, “identity” refers to some­thing that is able to stand on its own, without depending on anything else; it is in this sense that it is meant when referring to “the identity in phe­nomena.” If the term is interpreted in a narrower sense, it refers to the “I,” or “self” falsely perceived with reference to the mind-body aggregates; it is in this sense that the term is meant when referring to “the identity in the individual.” In this regard, what is called “belief in identity” constitutes that selfsame belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, for that itself constitutes the false perception of a self with reference to the collection of these aggregates, [3.136b] which are by nature perishable and impermanent. This misperception is itself connected with ignorance. For as long as there is ignorance, which consists of delusion concerning the Four Truths,308 there is this misperception; and once that ignorance has been eliminated, this misperception has also been eliminated.309The remedy to this misperception is sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of any identity because it serves as a counterbalancing force that is the opposite of the belief in identity, which is allied with ignorance.310 If ignorance and the belief in identity, together with their potentials, are not uprooted and eliminated, there is no way for one to become free of the three realms. And if one lacks the sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of any identity, one is incapable of eliminating the belief in identity. Thus, oneAUTHENTIC VIEW - 127"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEshould train in that completely authentic view through the three means of studying, contemplating, and meditating on teachings, and so develop that flawless and sublime intelligence.Preliminaries: The Four Axioms [III]In explaining the overview of these four axioms as a preliminary step, the source verses state:Conditioned phenomena are momentary and impermanent;all that is corruptible is of the nature of the three kinds of suffering;both the deeply ingrained afflictive state and the totally refined state are empty and lack identity;nirvana alone is liberation, the state of peace.These are the four axioms that denote the general teachings of the Buddhas words.Contemplating them thoroughly, one arouses a sense of certainty at the outset.It is said that, in coming to a definitive understanding of the lack of iden­tity through studying and contemplating teachings, if one has not aroused a sense of certainty concerning these four axioms that denote the Buddhas words—that is, the view—it will be difficult for one to develop the cer­tainty that will finally resolve this issue of lack of identity. So one should initially examine these axioms precisely:(i) In this regard, all conditioned phenomena311 subsumed within the outer and inner levels312 are found to be impermanent because there is never any situation in which they exhibit permanence. And this impermanence is not simply and completely accounted for on the more obvious level of impermanence; there is also the more subtle level of impermanence, in that the characteristics of things are such that they cease in the very moment they come about, having no independent status that allows them to last for even an instant. [3.137a] Just as the flame of a lamp can be understood to be momentary (as the oil fueling it is consumed moment by moment), likewise so can all that is conditioned. And just as it is impossible, in the case of a rider and mount, for one to proceed and the other not to, so too the sense faculties and their respective sense objects are found to be momentary because they constitute the support for momentary consciousness."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 129(2) That being the case, suffering can also be understood because things must disintegrate moment by moment, without any independent status that would allow them to endure. In this context, subliminal suffering—the subtle aspect of suffering—lies in the fact that conditioned things, merely by having come about, can be characterized as producing suffering. It is not appropriate to think that whatever entails suffering constitutes some agent that somehow causes happiness or suffering, for the thing itself has no inde­pendent status. This is why it is a contradiction for any phenomenon that is impermanent to also be something with identity or a producing agent.Regardless of which phenomenon one considers, everything that serves as a cause to perpetuate afflictive mental states is corruptible,313 and these things do not transcend the nature of suffering. In this regard, the suffering of actual pain, as experienced by beings in the states of animals and lower, can plainly be understood to be suffering, and so we need not prove it to be so through reasoning. The suffering of change can be understood to be actual suffering by ordinary mortal people with good powers of discern­ment, and so it too need not be proved to be so through reasoning. The suf­fering that needs to be proved to be so through reasoning is the subliminal suffering that spiritually immature people do not understand to be suffering and instead hold to be happiness.On this note, all conditioned things come about and disintegrate moment by moment, their nature being one of impermanence, and so there is not the slightest chance of them enduring. Without the indepen­dent status that would allow them to endure, they constitute suffering itself because they disintegrate even though we do not wish them to do so. Fur­thermore, if we put aside the case of something that we do not wish to dis­integrate nevertheless disintegrating and so constituting suffering, [3.137b] even something that disintegrates whether we wish it to or not is suffering because its disintegration is due to its lacking any independent status to prevent that disintegration.From among the Four Truths, in the case of those of suffering and its all-pervasive origin, from the point of view of their common ground, the all-pervasive origin is considered to be the cause and suffering the effect. To give an example, if one is motivated by an afflictive state of aversion and so commits the act of.taking another being s life, from that cause (that is, the all-pervasive origin) comes the effect (the truth of suffering), in this case the formation of a body in a state of hell.314But while, as a general rule, these two—suffering and its all-pervasive origin—are related to one another as effect and cause, respectively, it is by"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"no means certain that the all-pervasive origin will always be the cause and suffering always the effect. All suffering comes about through the force of impermanence, for things are such that they do not endure in their respec­tive situations; those situations change into others and eventually things disintegrate, so that they are productive of suffering and are sources of dis­appointment. To give an example, when a seed as the cause is thoroughly augmented by water, fertilizer, warmth, and other factors, it does not remain in the state of being a seed. Rather, it completely disintegrates, and there ensues the state of a seedling. That, too, does not last, but completely disintegrates, and there ensues the complete state of a fruit. And that, too, does not last forever, but eventually disintegrates.(3) All phenomena that pertain to either deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state315 are empty and lack identity. Generally speaking, those who believe that things have a creator are mistaking an inappropriate cause to be the cause.316 This serves as the avenue for ordinary consciousness to perceive things in an erroneous way—in fact, for all manner of afflictive mental states and flaws. And even though there are mistaken ideas of taking something that is not a cause to be a cause—such as that of taking a seedling to come about from some cause other than itself, such as impermanence— [3.138a] it is not as though these serve as the avenue for all flaws to come about, as is the case with believing in a creator.In this regard, all of the happiness and suffering in the world comes about through the force of positive and negative karma. The fact that one commits negative actions and experiences suffering as a result, or that one commits positive actions and experiences happiness as a result—these are not due to some creator imposing these on each and every ordinary being as some ultimate essential principle. And so, although simply as a general rule it is definitely the case that the results of happiness and suffering come about due to positive and negative actions, respectively, this is not ever made to be so, as non-Buddhists believe, by some eternal, unitary, autonomous entity,317 such as the soul of an individual or a powerful creator god. If such were the case, one would incur the effects of actions one had not committed, the effects of actions one had committed would be ineffectual, and there would be no predictability in ascertaining causes and effects—the entire frame­work of moral choices of acceptance and rejection, which is based on cause and effect, would be subverted. This would serve as the utterly intolerable avenue for ignoble opinions based on exceedingly warped interpretations of which actions to embrace and which to avoid.Therefore, if one understands that all phenomena, although they are130 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 131devoid of identity and have no creator, nevertheless can and do come about through a process of interdependent connection, unceasing in their manifestation, then all of the afflictive mental states pertaining to the three realms are completely undermined.(4) If the belief in identity is thus eliminated, one gains the state of cessa­tion—which is to say, nirvana, the transcendence of sorrow. In this regard, the happiness of higher states of rebirth and so forth are temporary states of well-being, which are very limited, deceptive, unreliable, and lacking in any real essence. And so nirvana alone is the liberation that is an ongoing state of well-being—the state of peace that is undisturbed by the waves of afflictive mental states. If we analyze it, however, there are many different interpreta­tions in the Indian and Tibetan traditions of Buddhism regarding the state of nirvana according to each of the three spiritual approaches,318 and the consummate level of the truth of cessation. I will discuss the essential points of these in the section on the fruition state.319Let me use an analogy to describe the role played by these four axioms that denote the general teachings of the Buddhas words. [3.138b] Just as a ruler s subjects uphold the edicts of their ruler and would not contravene them, in a similar fashion, it would be inappropriate for those who consider themselves followers of the Lord of Sages320 ever to stray outside the guide­lines of this view. So one should contemplate these axioms thoroughly and at the very outset arouse a sense of certainty concerning them.The Path That Avoids Dualistic Extremes [IV]There are two considerations in following this path: the general way in which to avoid dualistic extremes and a specific explanation of the Middle Way tradition.General Way to Avoid Dualistic Extremes [A]The source verses state:Next, one follows the path that avoids dualistic extremes.One uses the sublime intelligence that understands ultimate reality as the perceiving agent to pare away conceptual elaborations concerning the object that is to be known. This is the tradition of each individuals own school."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Be that as it may, materialists may eliminate naïve affirmation and nihilistic denial according to their own interpretations, but they still fall into extremes of overstatement and understatement.Once one has already cultivated one s authentic intelligence, such that it is capable of becoming totally pure, one then must follow the Middle Way path that avoids the dualistic extremes of conceptual elaborations involv­ing either naïve affirmation or nihilistic denial. As the means to follow it, one uses the perceiving agent of sublime intelligence that knows ultimate reality to pare away conceptual elaborations concerning the object that is to be known. This is, in general, the tradition of each of the Buddhist schools of thought. Therefore, those who follow philosophical systems that profess materialism321 may, with recourse to the scriptural authority and reasoning that pertain to their own traditions, eliminate naïve affirmation and nihil­istic denial as these apply with their specific context. Nevertheless, if their positions are evaluated according to the Middle Way tradition and the rea­soning that concerns the absence of conceptual elaborations, they still fall into extremes of overstatement and understatement.Sublime intelligence, generally speaking, can be of two kinds: sublime intelligence that knows the relative and sublime intelligence that knows the ultimate; the latter is the basis of what is being characterized in this present context. Concerning that kind of intelligence, moreover, within the Mahàyàna approach we can ascertain three distinct interpretations: (i) fol­lowers of the Mind Only school understand all phenomena to be simply conscious awareness; (2.) those who assert unqualified emptiness under­stand all phenomena to be free of conceptual elaborations; and (3) those who assert qualified emptiness understand that freedom from conceptual elaborations itself to be endowed with the potential for all manifestation.322 [3.139a]In general, proponents of all philosophical systems, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, presume that they are espousing a ‘middle way,” refuting dualistic extremes in light of their own understanding of what this means. This is because they hold that they profess, according to their own systems, a middle way that avoids two extremes—although lower approaches, in exag­gerating what does not exist as existing, incur the extreme of naïve affir­mation, while relatively higher approaches, in denying what exists as not existing, incur the extreme of nihilistic denial.132. - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"With respect to our own Buddhist schools:(1) For followers of the Particularist school, the way in which the extremes of naïve affirmation and nihilistic denial are avoided is as follows: the extreme of naïve affirmation is avoided due to the fact that all condi­tioned things disintegrate moment by moment, while the extreme of nihil­istic denial is avoided due to the fact that minute and irreducible subatomic particles are truly existent.(1) For those who are Followers of the Sütras, the extreme of naïve affir­mation is avoided due to the fact that causes in their own individual essences are subject to cessation, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided due to the fact that their accordant results ensue.323(3) For those of the Mind Only school, the extreme of naïve affirma­tion is avoided by the fact that what is imputed has no independent nature,, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided by the fact that what is dependent can be proven to be truly existent.324(4) For those of the Middle Way school,325 the extreme of naïve affirma­tion is avoided by the fact that the nature of things is a freedom from con­ceptual elaboration, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided by the fact that what is relative comes about through a process of interdependent connection.(5) For those who profess qualified emptiness, the extreme of naive affirmation is avoided by the fact that all phenomena on the relative level (which come about due to other factors) are primordially such that they cannot be proven to exist, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided by the fact that the heart essence of the attainment of the state of bliss326 (which is naturally occurring and unchanging) abides as the fundamentally unconditioned mode of being.327The source verses state:Therefore, these interpretations are partly truth but with much untruth.Because the way of abiding is realized to be free of conceptual elaborations and the way in which things manifest to be a process of interdependent connection, the Middle Way tradition is entirely true.Because they largely fall into the extremes of overstatement and under­statement, the majority of the foregoing views of the respective schools ofAUTHENTIC VIEW - 133"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"134- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEthought have some element of truth, but for the most part contain much that is untrue.328 But because it entails the realization of things just as they are—of the fundamentally unconditioned mode of reality as a freedom from conceptual elaborations and as the utter lucidity of unconditioned basic space, and of the way in which things manifest as such, that by nature they come about through a process of interdependent connection— [3.139b] it is the Middle Way tradition that is entirely true. As we read in the B rief Presentation o f Buddhist Views:In the scriptural sources of the Particularists,Followers of the Sutras, and Yogic Practitioners, there is some small element of truth and there is untruth.The Middle Way tradition is entirely true.329In this present context, to summarize the path that avoids dualistic extremes, there are two considerations: the way in which to dispel dualistic extremes with respect to conduct and the way in which to dispel dualistic extremes with respect to view.1) In the first case, if one asserts that phenomena (whether of deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state330) that can be vali­dated through what is considered valid cognition in the ordinary mundane sphere331 are in fact nonexistent, one falls into the extreme of understate­ment.332 On the other hand, if one asserts that phenomena (whether of deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state) that are tainted by causes of confusion in the present circumstances,333 or are posited in schools of thought that espouse extreme views, are in fact existent, one falls into the extreme of overstatement.334 On the Middle Way path that avoids these two extremes, one s conduct is that of training in the six transcendent perfections.3352) As for the two extremes with respect to ones view, if one naively accepts the existence of all objects of knowledge that there are in general, and all the limitless aspects of the relative level of truth in particular, one falls into the extreme of overstatement because one is asserting that these exist even though valid cognition cannot prove that they do. On the other hand, if one naively asserts that, on the same relative level of truth (which can be validated through valid cognition), things are not existent once they are thoroughly investigated (using such reasoning as whether things are unitary or manifold336), one falls into the extreme of understatement because one is asserting that emptiness is the cause of things disintegrat­"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 135ing.337 On the Middle Way path that avoids two such extremes, one s view is such that it pares away conceptual elaborations.Specific Explanation of the Middle Way Tradition [B]There are three considerations in explaining the Middle Way tradition: a general discussion identifying emptiness, a specific explanation of the inter­pretation of “unqualified emptiness,” and a specific explanation of the inter­pretation of “qualified emptiness.”Identifying Emptiness [l]The source verses state:The scope of its view is emptiness—the actuality of negating the two kinds of identity, and an aspect of unqualified negation. [3.140a]Given that the scope338 of the view in the Middle Way tradition is that of emptiness, the significance of that term “empty” is one of “absence.” What is it that is absent? The two kinds of identity. The “-ness” component signifies that this constitutes the “circumstance” of things.339In this regard, according to the school of Yogic Practitioners, what is alone explained as being the actuality of what is ultimate is timeless aware­ness—entailing no duality of perceived object and perceiving subject, such that the two kinds of identity (as what is to be negated) have been negated. According to those who have an unqualified interpretation of emptiness, diis actuality is, rather, an aspect of unqualified negation that is simply the negation of the two kinds of identity.Unqualified Emptiness (rangstong) [2]The source verses state:The basis for emptiness is objects in the phenomenal world, which are also what is to be negated and the basis for such negation. The way in which these are empty, according to the unqualified interpretation of emptiness, is diat they cannot be proven to exist in essence."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"136 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEIf this is analyzed, there are sixteen aspects—of outer, inner, both, emptiness, and so forth— but these can be subsumed within the four aspects of what is substantial, insubstantial, true nature, and alternate reality.More specifically, the basis for emptiness lies in objects in the phenom­enal world340—which is to say, all possible phenomena, as many objects of knowledge as there may be. These are, at one and the same time, what is to be negated—that is, what it is that is empty—and the basis on which there can be this negation.341 In brief, they constitute two lands of things—indi­viduals and phenomena.As for the way in which these are empty, all phenomena that could be considered as bases for negation are empty by virtue of their very essence— for example, just as form is empty of form, any given thing is empty of being that very thing; because when one evaluates it using the reasoning that investigates from the ultimate perspective, the thing in question cannot be found to be that thing. To give an example, when a vase is investigated to establish whether it is something unitary or manifold, it cannot be estab­lished to be a “vase.”To summarize, to say nothing of things that are unsuitable to be objects of ordinary consciousness,342 as many phenomena as are suitable are all explained as being empty of their respective essences. The Entrance to the Middle Way states:Since that343 is its nature, the eye is empty of the eye; the ear, the nose, the tongue,the body, and the mind are to be described likewise.344The basis for emptiness lies in its sixteen aspects, such as the emptiness of outer and inner objects in the phenomenal world.345 If these aspects are sum­marized, [3.140b] they fall into the four categories of what is substantial, what is insubstantial, nature, and “alternate reality.”346 As is said:Furthermore, O Subhuti,347 the Mahayana approach of the bodhi- sattva consists of the following aspects of emptiness: emptiness of what is internal, emptiness of what is external, emptiness of what is external and internal, emptiness of emptiness, emptiness"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 137of what is great, emptiness of what is ultimate, emptiness of what is conditioned, emptiness of what is unconditioned, emptiness of what is beyond limitations, emptiness of what is without be­ginning or end, emptiness of what is not to be discarded, empti­ness of nature, emptiness of all phenomena, emptiness of specific characteristics, emptiness of what has no frame of reference,348 ... and emptiness of the very essence of what has no substantiality.349Of these aspects:(1) The first aspect refers to the six internal components of the sense fields (the faculty of vision and so forth).350(2) The second aspect refers to the six outer components of the sense fields (forms and so forth).351(3) The third aspect refers to the foregoing outer and inner components of the sense fields but not in this case to the physical bases for the senses.352(4) The foregoing explanations confirm that phenomena on the relative level are empty of any finite essence on the relative level, but the fourth aspect of emptiness is explained in order to negate any fixation that the fact that things are empty of being things itself constitutes something that is their “nature.” The topic under discussion in this fourth explanation is that of emptiness in the three aspects just explained. The purpose of present­ing this fourth aspect of emptiness is to negate any fixation that emptiness, moreover, “exists,” or “is,” something.(5) Concerning the fifth aspect, the term “supreme” is used because there is a pervasiveness throughout the entire animate and inanimate universe, without exception.353(6) The sixth aspect refers to nirvana because this is the most sublime purpose concerning what is ultimate.354 In this context, this is not held to refer to nirvana that does or does not entail residual traces,355 but to either nirvana as the natural state356 or nonlimited nirvana.357(7) and (8) As for the seventh and eighth aspects, what is conditioned and what is unconditioned refer, respectively, to that which entails the three phases of production, duration, and cessation, and that which does not.358 [3.141a](9) Concerning the ninth aspect, “what is beyond limitations” refers to a freedom from the dualistic limitations of naive affirmation or nihilistic denial. It applies to all three topics of emptiness, interdependent connec­tion, and the path of the Middle Way."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"138 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(10) As for the tenth aspect, “what is without beginning or end” refers to samsara.(11) Concerning the eleventh aspect, in the expression “what is not to be discarded” “to discard” in general implies there being some “thing to be discarded,” which is another word for a “flaw.” To say “not to be” with regard to that implies “what is to be accepted,” which is another way of saying “the phenomena that pertain to the totally refined state of enlightenment.”359(12.) Regarding the twelfth aspect, “nature” refers to the emptiness of phenomena of any finite essence on the relative level because this consti­tutes the essence of phenomena on the ultimate level. Although there really is no difference between this aspect and the topic discussed as the basis for emptiness under the fourth aspect of emptiness, they are explained in these distinct ways in order to negate the fixation on emptiness per se and the fixation on that emptiness as being some “nature.”(13) As for the thirteenth aspect, “all phenomena” refers to as many phe­nomena as there are, whether conditioned or unconditioned.(14) Concerning the fourteenth aspect, the “specific characteristics” referred to are as many characteristics as there are that are specific to phe­nomena (such as anything that is suitable to be a form and so forth)—“from forms up to and including the state of omniscience.”360(15) With respect to the fifteenth aspect, “what has no frame of refer­ence” refers to the three phases of linear time. As it is said:The present is not something that abides, nor are the past or the present things that exist.361This aspect of emptiness must be discussed in light of the foregoing cita­tion; it is not to be discussed in the sense of “no frame of reference,” mean­ing a situation in which one thing is absent in another.362(16) Regarding the sixteenth aspect, the expression “the very essence of what has no substantiality” means that any substantial thing is empty of being that substantial thing itself. That emptiness being in turn empty of itself is termed “emptiness of the very essence of what has no substantiality.”Thus, a detailed analysis discusses these sixteen aspects, while a less elab­orate treatment subsumes them into four categories. In the extensive and middle-length “Mother” texts,363 we find these words following the discus­sion of the sixteen aspects of emptiness:"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 139O Subhuti, what is substantial is empty of what is substantial, [3.141b] what is insubstantial is empty of what is insubstantial, nature is empty of nature, and alternate reality is empty of alter­nate reality.364This passage, then, speaks of four aspects of emptiness. In this regard, if we summarize all objects that there are in the phenomenal world, which are bases for emptiness, they can be subsumed within the two categories of rela­tive and ultimate truth. As for the relative level of truth, it comprises two categories, what is substantial and what is nonsubstantial.365 And although the ultimate level of truth cannot be analyzed from the point of view of what it constitutes in essence, from the point of view of its aspects, it can be shown to consist of both nature and what is termed “alternate reality.”The points to be understood from such a presentation are:(1) that phenomena on the relative level have primordially never known existence, but it is not the case that timeless awareness has newly made them nonexistent (this is the logic that shows emptiness to be the nature of all that is relative); and(2) while this is the case, it is not appropriate for emptiness to be an object either of a consciousness that is subjectively perceiving what is relative, or of its verbalizations (this is the logic that shows it to be “alternate reality”).“Well,” one might wonder, “why is this term ‘alternate reality’ used?” The commentary to the Entrance to the Middle Way gives three reasons366 in dis­cussing the use of the term “alternate reality”:(1) due to the fact that, while objects in the phenomenal world—that is, things on the relative level—are not constantly present, this is constantly present;(2) due to the reason that, while things on the relative level are not what is realized by timeless awareness, this is what is realized by that awareness; and(3) due to the reason that, while what is relative does not transcend samsara, this does transcend it.Qualified Emptiness (gzhan stong) [ 3]The source verses state:The basis for negation is what is absolute, while the factors to be negated are what is imputed and what is dependent."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Yogic Practitioners profess that it is “empty of these”They explain that this can be analyzed into fourteen aspects, which can be subsumed within two.The basis on which there can be negation is what is absolute367—that is, basic space, suchness beyond the confines of conceptual elaboration. The factors to be negated are what can be characterized as imputed or depen­dent.368 As to the way in which emptiness is so, given that the basis for nega­tion is empty of the two factors to be negated, [3.142a] it is the absolute itself that is described by Yogic Practitioners—that is to say, those who uphold the tradition of qualified emptiness—to be “empty of other.”369 In this regard, Serdok Panchen370 provides the following explanation:That which serves as the basis for emptiness is that which is de­pendent—that is to say, the limidess aspects of the consciousness imbued with the dualistic framework of perceived objects and a perceiving subject. The factor that is to be negated is that which is imputed, which is in turn twofold according to an analysis of what is perceived and what perceives. Each of these aspects of perceived and perceiver has two further divisions, from the point of view of the individual and that of phenomena.371As to the way in which these are empty, the basis for the nega­tion is empty of the factors to be negated in the sense of being “empty of other,” not in the sense of being “empty in itself.” For the factors to be negated—the two aspects of what is imputed, that is, perceived and perceiver—are in essence “other” with re­spect to the two aspects of perceived and perceiver that pertain to consciousness based on dualistic perception (which are the bases on which negation can take place) because the former can­not be considered to be of the essence that is specific to the latter.“What,” one might ask, “is the essence that is specific to that consciousness based on dualistic perception?” It is nondual time­less awareness itself—the bare lucidity and awareness of experi­encing whatever is knowable.372In general, while timeless awareness—entailing none of the duality of perceived objects and perceiving subject—is explained as being the basic space of phenomena, when its ramifications are analyzed, there are fourteen140 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"aspects of emptiness; when the significance of these are summarized, these are understood as being subsumed within two categories.373These fourteen aspects as follows:Emptiness of what is internal, of what is external, of what is external and internal, and of what is great; emptiness of emptiness,of what is ultimate, of what is conditioned, of what is unconditioned, of what is beyond limitations, of what is without beginning or end, of what is not to be discarded, of nature, of characteristics, and emptiness of phenomena.374In this case, the bases for these aspects of emptiness are referred to in Dis­tinguishing Center and L im it:There is emptiness of that which experiences and what it experiences, of their body, and of the basis for existence; there is also such perception of how, what?i and why, which are also emptiness.375This passage constitutes a brief summation of all aspects of emptiness without exception. The specific contexts that are the bases for these aspects of emptiness are the inner components of the sense fields, the outer com­ponents of the sense fields, [3.141b] the body that constitutes the context for of these two, and the inanimate universe that serves as their support; that is to say, what pertains to the relative level of truth. The timeless aware­ness that has direct knowledge of the emptiness of these four categories is the specific context that is the basis for the emptiness of the fifth and sixth aspects;376 this is from the point of view of the ultimate level. So the specific contexts that are the bases lor emptiness in the six foregoing cases are assigned on the basis of an analysis of the two levels of truth, while the specific situations that are the bases for emptiness in the last eight cases377 are assigned in light of their usefulness.

Because bodhi­sattvas base their spiritual practice on these eight specific contexts, one might wonder for what purpose any given aspect is undertaken.Because the two kinds of virtue—(i) conditioned and (z) uncondi­tioned—are to be gained in the more consummate sense, one pursues the practice of these two kinds of virtue—conditioned and unconditioned—in the shorter term. These two kinds are the specific contexts, respectively, for the emptiness of what is conditioned and the emptiness of what is uncon­ditioned;(3) using the same model, because there is the specific purpose of benefit­ing beings, one pursues spiritual practice on the path of the Middle Way;(4) in order not to abandon beings, one pursues practice to engage in samsara;(5) in order to ensure that virtue becomes inexhaustible in the state in which there is not residual traces,386 one pursues the accomplishment of vir­tue that accords with the true nature of phenomena;387(6) in order for it to be purified of adventitious distortions,388 one pursues practice that focuses on ones naturally indwelling spiritual potential;(7) one pursues spiritual practice in order to gain the major and minor marks of perfect form;389 and(8) in order to gain the attributes of buddhahood, [3.143a] one pursues practice to accomplish the powers and so forth.The first four of these aspects of emptiness390 are from the point of view of what is held in common with the ordinary approaches of the sravaka and pratyekabuddha; the latter four aspects,391 of what is extraordinary about the Mahayana approach.

To give one example, if one did not understand samsara to be empti­ness, one would feel disheartened and relinquish samsara.In this context, with respect to the explanations of the specific contexts that are the bases for aspects of emptiness, there are distinctions in how this interpretation differs from that found in the sources of the interpretation of unqualified emptiness—specifically, the naturally indwelling spiritual potential, as distinct from emptiness of nature; the major marks of per­fect form, as distinct from the emptiness of specific characteristics; and the qualities of the level of buddhahood, as distinct from the emptiness of all phenomena.393As to the way in which there is emptiness,394 the true nature of phenom­ena is empty of what is “other”395—which is to say, dualistic consciousness from the point of view of the individual and phenomena.396A concise analysis consists of two aspects—emptiness of what has no substantiality and emptiness of the very essence of what has no substantial­ity.397 These two aspects, moreover, can be analyzed into their own aspects. Emptiness of what has no substantiality is designated from the perspective that there is a negation of an imputed individual and imputed phenomena as factors to be negated. Emptiness of the very essence of what has no sub­stantiality is designated from the perspective that there is a negation of what remains in the wake of the negation of the foregoing factors to be negated— that is, the existence of the individual and phenomena as being the true nature of things. These two aspects are not two separate “emptinesses” that can each stand on its own; however, they must be designated as a means of dispelling the two extremes of overstatement and understatement with respect to each situation involving things that are actually emptiness. The point here is that one understand that these two aspects must be seen as applying to all fourteen aspects of emptiness.The two extremes here are explained as being that of overstatement (that is, of naively assuming the existence of an individual and phenomena that are imputed) and that of understatement (that is, of denial that states: “The factors of the true nature of reality and the entity of the individual do not exist”).398 [3.143b]AUTHENTIC VIEW - 143"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"144 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEMain Explanation: Two Aspects of the Lack of Identity [V]The main explanation—that of an investigation of the two aspects of the lack of identity—is twofold: an articulation of the purpose of addressing the lack of identity and an investigation of this actual lack of identity.Purpose [A]The source verses state:The hindrances to perception are the ten distracting concepts; the remedies that dispel these are the two aspects of lack of identity.That which acts as a hindrance to one directly perceiving emptiness con­sists entirely of ten digressive concepts.399 As the Summary o f the Meaning o f the Eight Thousand Verses states:Due to the ten ways in which mental distraction occurs, the mind is distracted to other things, so that spiritually immature people have no chance to develop nondual timeless awareness.400The remedy that dispels these concepts is timeless awareness that direcdy realizes the twenty, or sixteen, aspects of emptiness. If these aspects are sum­marized, they are twofold, due to an analysis into realization of the lack of identity in the individual and in phenomena.Analysis [B]The investigation of this actual lack of identity is fivefold: the lack of identity in phenomena; the lack of identity in the individual; the relevant issues related to both aspects; the defining of the topics for investigation through the individual interpretations of the Middle Way; and the advice concerning the integration of the underlying intent of the two main­stream traditions."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW■- 145Lack of Identity in Phenomena [1]This discussion has five topics: (a) the key topic for initially coming to a definitive conclusion; (b) what, in essence, constitutes the identity that is to be negated; (c) the reasons that negation is necessary; (d) the realizations that are specific to the individual philosophical systems; and (e) the process for reaching a definitive conclusion through reasoning in the Middle Way tradition.Key Topic [a]The source verses state:The more obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phenomena is an issue common to Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, and so one should come to a definitive conclusion about it at the outset.Concerning the lack of any identity in phenomena, there is a more obvi­ous aspect (in which the factor to be negated—which is in fact negated—is the sense of this identity having true existence) and a more subtle aspect (in which even something having no true existence is negated). Of these two, first and foremost one should come to a definitive conclusion concerning the more obvious aspect, for the following reasons: (a) because this aspect is an issue common to Buddhists and non-Buddhists; (b) because the real­ization of this more obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phenomena must precede the realization of the more subtle aspect of that lack of iden­tity; [3.144a] and (c) because once one has come to a definitive conclusion that all phenomena on the relative level are empty in and of themselves of any finite essence, this proves as a consequence that anything called “the identity in the individual”—which is imputed by an almost innate level of nonrecognition—is empty in and of itself of any finite essence.Factor to Be Negated [b]As for what this is in essence, the source verses state:"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"146 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThis is, in essence, similar to a rope being taken for a snake; there is just the fixation in the ordinary mind that this is something self-justifying that is truly existent.The identity in phenomena, in its essence, is discussed in the commen­tary to the Four Hundred Verses, which states that this isa case in which something exists solely due to there being a con­cept of it, but is not something existent in the absence of that concept. These are cases like that of a coiled rope being unhesi­tatingly imputed to be a snake; this is certainly a case in which something cannot be established to exist in its very essence.401In accord with this citation, it is due to the influence of this almost innate level of nonrecognition—to which one has become habituated through­out beginningless time—that all phenomena, both external and internal, all forms, and so forth, that manifest to the ordinary mind, are fixated on as though truly existent things that have their own specific and innate characteristics. In any way that this occurs, it comes down to nothing more than something being imputed by conceptual thinking—like a rope being mistaken for a snake—for things by their very nature cannot be found to exist. And so they are things that are negated through reasoning when one is focusing on suchness itself.Purpose of Negating Identity [c]As for the purpose of negating these,402 the source verses state:This is negated because it is the cause for misconstruing things to have identity, which lies at the root of the two obscuring factors.Such overt fixation is the cause for misconstruing things to have identity, which lies at the root of the two kinds of obscuration.403 This is discussed in the Precious Garland:As long as there is reification of the mind-body aggregates, for that long there is the belief in an “I.”"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"If there is belief in an “I,” there is, furthermore, karma, and due to that there is rebirth.404That is, furthermore, the foremost factor in the cognitive obscuration, as is pointed out in the Highest Continuum:Whatever conceptual thoughts involve the three focal points405 is held to constitute the cognitive obscuration.406Therefore, those who wish to attain liberation and omniscience407 by eliminating the two kinds of obscuration [3.144b] must eliminate overt fixation on the root of these two kinds of obscuration. This, in turn, must be eliminated through negating the sense that objects are truly existent things. As we read in the Four Hundred Verses:With one having perceived that no identity exists in sense objects, the potential for conditioned existence will come to an end.408And according to the Detailed Commentary on Valid Cognition:In this context, without repudiating an object, one is unable to eliminate it.409Philosophical Interpretations [d]Concerning the ways in which the various philosophical systems under­stand this issue, the source verses state:Although the Particularists and Followers of the Sutras do not have a completely perfect understanding of suchness, they come to their definitive conclusion on the basis of temporary objects in the phenomenal world.The rationale is that nothing whatsoever is found through investigation;for to consider this to mean a lack of true existence is their general tradition.AUTHENTIC VIEW - 147"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"148 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEWhat is simply the most obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phe­nomena is found in all philosophical systems, for it is explained in such texts as the Ornament o f the Middle Waym that this is found even among non-Buddhists. But even though this will suppress the more obvious aspect of the cognitive obscuration (which is in direct opposition to it), it is not the view that becomes the path to omniscience. It is not possible for one to directly perceive the lack of identity in the subjective perceiving agent411 by familiarizing oneself simply with this because it is devoid of the basis for positive qualities that is in accord with liberation.412Concerning this issue, the followers of the Samkhya school believe objects in the external world to be mind and further believe that dualistic consciousness becomes a nondual state with the dissolution of mind into primal matter.413In the systems of the Particularists and the Followers of the Sutras, there are no explanations that bring one to a definitive conclusion on the basis of all limidess objects in the phenomenal world, and so they lack a completely perfect understanding of suchness as it pertains to the lack of identity in phenomena. Nevertheless, their explanations bring a definitive conclusion on the basis of ephemeral objects in the phenomenal world, and so they must have a partial understanding.That is to say, source texts of the Particularist school explain that exter­nal objects on the coarse level have no true existence; while the sources of the Followers of the Sutras do not stop there but make the distinction of a duality between what is material and what is a mental determinant414 and explain that mental determinants, too, have no true existence. The rationale for this, moreover, is as follows: whenever a given phenomenon is examined in the light of sublime intelligence from the ultimate perspective [3.145a] and nothing whatsoever is actually found, that fact alone means that it does not truly exist. This, in fact, is the general tradition for these systems,415 and so it is said:Whatever can be dismantled or mentally dissected such that the mind no longer entertains a concept— such as a vase or water—exists on the relative level 416And generally speaking, as soon as a given phenomenon is accepted to be relative, it must be accepted that it does not truly exist; this is in fact the tradition of all who profess a Buddhist system of philosophy. And in a source of the Followers of the Sutras, we read:"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Due to this, in any way that something is imputed, it does not exist in the ultimate sense.417There are a great number of such scriptural citations explaining that exclusionary mental determinants have no true existence.418The source verses state:The Mind Only schools own tradition holds that they realize both aspects of the lack of identity; but if a follower of the Middle Way evaluates this, because nondual consciousness is held to be ultimate, there still remains a rudimentary sense of identity in phenomena.To say nothing of the lower philosophical systems, even the Mind Only school of the Mahayana approach holds that, according to its own tradi­tion, both aspects of the lack of identity are realized. But if this is evalu­ated with the reasoning of the Middle Way, the two aspects of the lack of identity have not yet been brought to consummation since there remains a rudimentary sense of identity in phenomena because consciousness per se, devoid of the dualism of perceived objects and perceiving subject, is held to be ultimate. Nevertheless, the obvious and subtle aspects of identity in the individual and the more obvious aspect of identity in phenomena have been eliminated.In particular, those Mind Only proponents who hold sense data to be valid,419 even though they accept that objects in the external world do not exist, also accept sensory appearances to be mind, and so do not accept the emptiness of both perceived objects and perceiving subject. Therefore, they accept the lack of identity in the individual in a completely perfect way, but their way of establishing emptiness on the internal level has not been fully developed. This is because even though they accept that any identity that is entirely imputed does not exist, they do not establish the identity that is imputed to be a perceiving agent does not exist.420Definitive Understanding through Middle Way Reasoning [e]As for the way in which one comes to a definitive conclusion through the reasoning of the Middle Way school, [3.143b] the source verses state:AUTHENTIC VIEW - 149"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEAlthough there are many lines of reasoning in the Middle Way, the tradition of the Exalted One uses five to usher in certainty concerning the integration of emptiness and interdependent connection.Candra speaks of two models: once perceived objects are negated, the proof that they do not exist negates the perceiving subject; and the logic that a single relative thing is empty means that all phenomena are empty.In the Middle Way school, there are many traditions of individual mas­ters, such as Asanga and his brother,421 for lines of reasoning that bring one to a definitive conclusion concerning the lack of identity in phenomena. However, the tradition associated with the Exalted One, Nàgârjuna, uses five—four that investigate, respectively, the essence, the cause, the result, and both the latter, and a fifth that is die reasoning concerning interdepen­dent connection. I have explained earlier in this work422 the way in which these lines of reasoning usher in the state of timeless awareness in which emptiness and the process of interdependent connection are integrated.Candrakirti discusses two distinct methods that have been developed for coming to a definitive conclusion concerning the lack of identity in phe­nomena. He states:If no object of knowledge exists, the negation of consciousness is ensured;at the outset [the Buddha] negated objects of knowledge.423Accordingly, one method is to begin by negating the objective pole of consciousness, following which the evidence that perceived objects do not exist negates the subjective pole of consciousness. On the other hand, as is said:Whatever is the seeing of the one is the seeing of everything.424This, the other method, is one of coming to a definitive conclusion that a given single relative phenomenon is empty in and of itself, so that by the very same reasoning one comes to a definitive conclusion that as many objects of knowledge as there are—subsumed within the two levels of truth—are all empty in and of themselves of any finite essence."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"This process of coming to a definitive conclusion is from the point of view of someone progressing from a purely mundane path to embarking on the path of the Middle Way, without having been conditioned by any other philosophical system, Buddhist or otherwise. It does not apply to other cases because those who have already become involved in other systems of thought may have reached a definitive conclusion that coarser objects in the external world do not truly exist, [3.146a] but due to the conditioning of their belief systems, the reasoning they employ cannot be reassigned to some other specific situation.425Lack of Identity in the Individual [2]The investigation of the lack of identity in the individual also has five topics:(a) the key topic for initially coming to a definitive conclusion; (b) what, in essence, constitutes the identity that is lacking; (c) the reasons that such negation is necessary; (d) the realizations that are specific to the individual philosophical systems; and (e) the process for reaching a definitive conclu­sion through reasoning in the Middle Way tradition.Key Topic [a]The source verses state:The issue that distinguishes non-Buddhists from Buddhists is that of identity in the individual.As just mentioned, even among non-Buddhists there is realization on a more obvious level of the lack of identity in phenomena, as well as some degree of virtuous conduct. So the real distinction between non-Buddhists and Buddhists must be made on the basis of whether or not there is accep­tance of identity in the individual because the lack of identity in the indi­vidual constitutes the unique and extraordinary feature for all those who profess some system of Buddhist philosophy.In this regard, identity in the individual has two expressions: a more obvious expression as imputed by belief systems, and a more subtle one that is imputed by an instinctual sense of fixated perception. What is called the “self” is that which is the object misconstrued by this instinctual fixa­tion—that is, belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates. If one has not realized that this “self” is empty in and of itself of any finite essence, one isAUTHENTIC VIEW - 151"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"incapable of completely realizing the lack of identity in phenomena. And so if one has not completely realized the lack of identity in the individual, one cannot have realized the lack of identity in phenomena.426Factor to Be Negated [b]As for what, in essence, constitutes such identity, the source verses state:In essence, this is the instinctual fixation on “I” and “mine.”In essence, what is known as the “self” of the individual is something that all ordinary beings, even down to animals, are naturally born with. It is simply this conceit of thinking “I,” which is the object of fixation for an instinctual sense of “I” and “mine.” According to the commentary to the Four Hundred Verses:In this regard, what is called the “self” is what is imputed on the basis of the mind-body aggregates. . . ,427 In this regard, what is called “identity” is that which would naturally be the case in things such that in its essence it did not rely on any other fac­tor.428 [3.146b]This, indeed, cannot be found to exist in the ultimate sense, as it is pre­sumed to by holders of extreme views, as something permanent, unitary, and autonomous. However, just because this perception is capable of func­tioning on the conventional level, it is not the case that this does not exist simply as an imputation. This is because such thoughts as “given that I am following the path to liberation, this is, in fact, that path to liberation”429 or “my path to liberation,” and various other conventions of perceiving what is “mine,” are well known in the world and pose no problem.430 As Entrance to the Middle Way states:Just as the Buddha, although free of any belief in the reality of the transitory aggregates, taught in terms of “I” and “mine,”similarly, even though things431 have no independent nature, they are taught as “existing” in a purely provisional sense.432151 - t h e t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g e"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 153Purpose of Negating Identity [c]As for the reasons that such negation is necessary, the source verses state:It is negated because from it comes the sense of “other,” from which all opinionated views derive.While this can be established as a convention, it cannot be found to exist in the ultimate sense, and so must be negated through reasoning. All emo­tionally afflicted views and all afflictive mental states (such as attachment and so forth) derive from overt fixation on “I” and “mine” with respect to this “self.” The Detailed Commentary on Valid Cognition states:If there is an existent self, there is a sense of “other.”From self and other come attachment and aversion.All flaws derivefrom a complete involvement with these.433And as Entrance to the Middle Way explains:Once there is first fixation on the identity of “I,” attachment develops to things that are “mine.” .. .434 ... Having used their intelligence to see that afflictive mental states and flaws all, without exception, derive from belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, and having understood that the self is the object of that belief, advanced spiritual practitioners negate the self.435Philosophical Interpretations [d]As for the realizations that are specific to the individual philosophical sys­tems, the source verses state:While there are differences in the way in which realization takes place, all four philosophical systems bring realization.The significance of emptiness, and the conventional terms used concern­ing this, are found nowhere other than in the Middle Way school. And so,"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"given a distinction that is to be made—between a general way in which realization takes place and a consummate degree of this— [3.147a] those who follow all four systems of Buddhist philosophy realize at least the lack of identity in the individual. For if this lack of identity in the individual is presented in a complete way in the source texts of the Particularist school, it goes without saying that the Followers of the Sutras also accept this.436Therefore, through gaining familiarity with the lack of identity in the individual as definitively presented in the source texts of the Particularists and Followers of the Sutras, one comes to experience this lack directly. And through becoming familiar with that experience, one becomes capable of making fully evident the state of nirvana (in the sense that the potential for fixated perception of individual selfhood has been eliminated).However, these systems accept that the two aspects of the lack of iden­tity437 are substantial things because they accept these to be ultimately true (based on the reasoning that they are capable of performing functions in the ultimate sense). As for the bases on which they characterize these things, with the negation of any agent above and beyond the internal factors438 (as the specific case in point), they specify either of two things that are irreduc­ible.439 And with the negation of any materially existent thing above and beyond objects in the external world (as the specific case in point), they specify substantial things that are irreducible particles of matter.440While it is axiomatic that those of the Middle Way school have realiza­tion of the foregoing to a consummate degree, even those of the Mind Only school have a similar degree of realization.441Definitive Understanding through Middle Way Reasoning [e]Concerning the way in which one comes to a definitive conclusion through the reasoning of the Middle Way school, the source verses state:The five aggregates are not the self, the self does not possess them, nor do they act as supports one for the other. Some twenty alternativesare negated by lines of proof such as the reasoning based on the chariot.Generally speaking, the object that serves,as the frame of reference for concepts that involve the belief in a self consists of the five mind-body154 - THE t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g e"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"aggregates that are subsumed within one s ongoing experience. These con­stitute the objective pole that expresses itself in the way that the mind per­ceives, believing in the identity of “I” while focusing on that object. It is for this reason that the idea of believing in a self functions at all times with respect to any of the five aggregates subsumed within one s ongoing experi­ence.442 In all kinds of other situations, there are thoughts of what pertains to the self—“This is my friend, my family, my house, my land,” and so forth; because if someone else causes harm to any of these, [3.147b] there is the thought, “So-and-so has harmed me.” Nevertheless, the objective pole in the way that the mind perceives—that on which the thought fixates —is nonsubstantial and an abstract concept.Forget about identity in the individual not existing in light of reasoning that investigates from the ultimate perspective; identity in the individual does not even exist in light of reasoning that investigates from the conven­tional perspective! An individual, a person, is held to exist only to be in accord with what is commonly accepted in the world, taking things at face value without examining them or inquiring further. But this is not under any circumstances existent in the sense of being a material and substantial thing. Therefore, while this is not existent on either of the two levels of truth, it is accepted to “exist” as something imputed merely on the level of what is relatively valid.443In negating the object of that, the Buddha spoke, for example, of some twelve kinds of reasoning that negate in a general way the objects of belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates. These, however, must be learned from other sources. As for the specific negation of the objects of the twenty aspects of belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, in general the transcendent and accomplished conqueror444 spoke in the sutras about the “twenty beliefs in the reality of the perishable aggregates” as follows: belief concerning any one of the five aggregates (making five);445 belief that any one of the five aggregates is a possession of the self, by way of being partnered with it, or a secondary attribute (making ten); belief that the self serves as the support, with any one of the five aggregates being supported by it (making fifteen); and belief that any one of the five aggregates serves as the support, with the self being supported by it (making twenty). As is said in Letter to a Friend:“Forms,” it is said, “are not the self.” Nor does the selfpossess forms, nor do forms depend on the self,AUTHENTIC VIEW - 155"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"I$6 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEnor does the self depend on forms. In a similar fashion, understand that the four remaining aggregates are empty.446That is to say, in one s analyzing the five mind-body aggregates, in each case none of these is the self. The self (which is not some substantial thing) does not possess any of the five aggregates. With respect to the five aggre­gates vis-à-vis the self, or the self vis-à-vis the five aggregates, in no case is the one associated with the other. So in the case of these twenty alternatives, to prove the nonexistence of a self [3.148a], the master Nâgàrjuna and his heirs use the reasoning of the chariot and so forth to negate identity in the indi­vidual, as was discussed previously.447 To describe the form this takes clearly, it is as stated in the first version of Stages o f Meditation by Kamalaslla:The individual is not thought of as something aside from the mind-body aggregates, or the components of ordinary percep­tion, or the sense fields. The individual is also not the essence of the aggregates and so forth. This is because the aggregates and so forth are, in essence, impermanent and manifold, and because the individual is imputed by others to be, in essence, permanent and unitary.It is not suitable for that (or, alternatively, an individual that cannot be described448) to be an existent thing because there is no other form it could take as an existent thing.Therefore, it is thus: one should investigate the fact that what is called “I” and “mine” in the world449 is confusion, pure and simple.450This identity is a fixated concept of selfhood based on the conceit of thinking in terms of “I,” imputed with respect to the aggregates that perpet­uate one s body. If it could truly be found to exist, would it be identical to, or separate from, the aggregates of forms and so forth? One might suppose it would be identical, but this is not the case, because their characteristics are not in harmony. The aggregates are impermanent, compounded of mani­fold factors, and subject to external influences, while the self, it is presumed, would be something permanent, unitary, and autonomous.In this regard, it is not the case for the following reasons:(a) because the aggregates can be determined through reasoning to be impermanent and conditioned, while the self is supposedly provable"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"through some experience of one s taking it to be permanenty such as assum­ing that what one recognizes it as now is what one perceived it to be previ­ously;(b) because the aggregates can be determined through reasoning to be manifold groups of forms, sensations, and so forth, while the self is suppos­edly provable through some experience of one s taking it to be unitary, such as assuming, “I endure as a single entity”; and(c) because the aggregates can be determined through reasoning to be subject to external influences such as origination and disintegration, while the self is supposedly provable through some experience of one s taking it to be autonomous^ of the inward sense of “I.” [3.148b]One might suppose that it can be determined to be separate from the aggregates, but this is not the case:(a) because the fixated concept of selfhood could not function with respect to anything other than the aggregates; and(b) because it would thus be deprived of the characteristics of the aggre­gates and so be nonsubstantial and, if it were therefore nonsubstantial, this would contradict its being capable of performing functions.451On this note, the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence state:If the self were the aggregates,it would be subject to origination and disintegration.If it were other than the aggregates,it would lack the characteristics of the aggregates.452In addition, substantial things amount to just these five aggregates— forms, sensations, perceptions, formative factors, and aspects of conscious­ness; one cannot direcdy detect in the slightest a self that is separate from these. Because the vision and the other sense faculties are the subjective perceivers of the external components of the sense fields (visual forms and so forth) as their objects, and because even reflexive consciousness453 is the subjective perceiver of consciousness as its object, it is not logical that any of these be the self. Because the nature and effects of such an identity—not subsumed within the aggregates—would be unable to be perceived, there is no line of reasoning that can support there being such, and it cannot even be provable through valid inference.454One might suppose that this mental attitude of thinking in terms of “I” is a valid state of subjectively perceiving in terms of a self as its object. ButAUTHENTIC VIEW - 157"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"158 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEsince this is just a concept that embodies an overt form of fixation, it does not constitute direct experience, and because it cannot be supported by any valid line of reasoning whatsoever, it also does not constitute valid infer­ence.455 Rather, it amounts to nothing more than the conceit of thinking in terms of “I” without any real reason for doing so, due to the influence of a familiarization process that has extended throughout beginningless time, similar to the case of a rope s being mistaken for a snake.Therefore, given that the self and the individual are imputed on the basis of what is merely the collection of the mind-body aggregates, if they are examined with authentic sublime intelligence, no substantial thing that is an identity can be found. In the sutras it is stated:O monks, any spiritual practitioners or brahmins456 whose be­lief is one of thinking in terms of “self” [3.149a] are all focusing solely on the five aggregates that perpetuate samsara. That being the case, all fixated perception of a self is solely with respect to the lack of such identity.457And:Thus, just as the name “chariot”is given to an assemblage of parts,similarly on the basis of the mind-body aggregates,there is the relative term “ordinary being.”458If such investigation negates there being any “I” that can be found to exist by its very nature, this also negates anything “mine” that can be found to exist by its very nature. This is similar to the fact that since one cannot conceive of the child of a barren woman, one also cannot conceive of that child’s having its own eyes and so forth. In the Source Verses on Sublime Intel­ligence, we read the following:If the “I” itself is not existent, how could “mine” exist?459And in Entrance to the Middle Way:Because there are not actions without agents, there is, therefore, no “mine” that exists without “I.”"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 159And, therefore, seeing “I” and “mine” to be empty, advanced spiritual practitioners gain total freedom.460The source verses state:In Distinguishing Center and L im it, there are ten ways of being wise, as remedies to ten ways of believing in identity in the individual. There are many other such ways of reasoning.In the regent Maitreyas source Distinguishing Center and L im it, there is discussion of some ten ways of believing in identity. The text states that identity in the individual can be (1) misperceived as something unitary;(2) believed to be the cause that gives rise to all other things; (3) believed to be an agent of experience that appreciates sense objects; (4) believed to be a creator; (5) believed to have control over sense objects; (6) believed to be permanent; believed to be the basis (that is, the support) for (7) deeply ingrained afflictive states or (8) the totally refined state;461 (9) believed to be a spiritual practitioner; or (10) believed to be that which is not free and then free.462Given these beliefs, the text speaks of the ten ways of becoming learned as their remedies:463(1) The remedy to the first belief is to become learned about the mind- body aggregates; because these are by their nature collections of myriad fac­tors, [3.149b] this serves as a remedy to the belief in something unitary.(2) To become learned about the components of ordinary perception464 serves as the remedy to the second belief; given that the significance of these components lies in their being causes, to become learned about these eighteen components becomes the remedy to believing in a self as being a cause.465(3) Ones becoming learned about the sense fields serves as the remedy to the third belief; there is no existent self as that which enjoys sense objects because the process of appreciating sense objects is due to the interdepen­dent connection between the twelve constituents of the sense fields.466(4) To become learned about interdependent connection serves as the remedy for the fourth belief; things are not created by a self because they are the manifestation of what is simply the interdependent connection between causes and conditions.(5) To become learned about what is or is not in accord with the nature"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"of things serves as a remedy to the fifth belief; things are not controlled by a self in any way whatsoever because they proceed from a process of harmoni­ous cause and effect.467(6) To become learned about the faculties becomes the remedy to the sixth belief; there is no individual as the governing condition468 because the twenty-two faculties serve as the supports that govern our experience.469(7) To become learned about time serves as the remedy to the seventh belief; there is no permanent self because the three phases of linear time ensure that things are subject to origination and cessation.(8) To become learned about the Four Truths acts as the remedy to the eighth belief; there is no identity in the individual that is the basis for either deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state because the first two truths constitute the basis for deeply ingrained afflictive states, while the latter two constitute the basis for the totally refined state.(9) To become learned about spiritual approaches serves as the remedy to the ninth belief.470(10) To become learned about what is conditioned and unconditioned serves as the remedy to the tenth belief.471Given that there are a great many ways of reasoning such as the foregoing, one should learn about these from the traditions of the scriptural sources.472Relevant Issues [3]An explanation of the relevant issues related to both aspects of the lack of identity consists of five topics: [3.150a] an examination of the identicalness or separateness of these two aspects; the purpose of explaining these two aspects; the factors to be negated in these two cases; the valid cognition that ascertains these; and an investigation of authentic ways of reasoning.Identicalness or Separateness [a]The source verses state:Because all phenomena lack identity, in essence these aspects are inseparable. The factors to be negated being true existence and the “I,” or self, the aspects are assigned as this vis-à-vis that from distinct points of view.l6o - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- iélGiven that the two aspects of lack of identity in the individual and in phenomena are distinct aspects that are identical in essence, the reason­ing behind this is as follows: Because all visible and audible phenomena473 are such that they lack identity, from the point of view of their essence, there cannot be the slightest division whatsoever. By way of example, a given phenomenon as a basis for specific features—a vase, say—may not be something that can actually be fixated on as a substantial thing, but under the circumstances (from the point of view of its being merely something imputed), it can be identified as a basis for specific features. Something such as a vase, then, does not ever have an “I” or “self”; this is the lack of identity in an individual. And the vase cannot be found to truly exist in the slight­est; this is the lack of identity in a phenomenon. This is because there is, in essence, no distinction to be made between the fact that no identity can be found in this and the fact that no true existence can be found. Therefore, all phenomena lack any identity as an individual and lack any identity as a phe­nomenon. Nevertheless, from the point of view of distinguishing an “I” or self as the factor to be negated, there is the lack of identity in the individual, while from the point of view of distinguishing true existence as the factor to be negated, there is the lack of identity in phenomena. These are assigned as this vis-à-vis that from the perspective of distinguishing the factors to be negated; so the division is due to there being aspects.Purpose [b]As for the purpose for explaining these two aspects, the source verses state: The purpose of this is in order to care for two types of people.One might wonder, “If the two aspects of lack of identity are in essence inseparable, what is the point in analyzing two aspects?” The reasoning is as follows: The Victorious One474 spoke of the lack of identity in the individual in order to care for those of the srâvaka and pratyekabuddha types in the Hlnayana approach, and of the lack of identity in phenomena in order to care for those of the bodhisattva type in the Mahâyàna approach. [3.150b]In this regard, it was definitely necessary to teach the lack of identity in the individual for those of the Hlnayana type, for if this were not taught, they could not become free of samsara. But he taught only the lack of iden­tity in the individual for them because they are not suitable recipients to be"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEtaught the lack of identity in phenomena in addition, and so there would have been no point even if he had taught this. But for those of the Mahayana type, he taught the lack of identity in phenomena because of the necessity of their attaining omniscience.Factors to Be Negated [c]As for an investigation of the object to be negated in these two cases, the source verses state:Although the actual factors to be negated cannot possibly be known,due to confusion on the part of the subjective perceiver, they are imputed as being perceived as the one and the other.The actual things to be negated that are the objects in the case of these two aspects of lack of identity cannot possibly be objects that can be known. It is impossible for an identity in the individual to exist as something per­manent, unitary, and autonomous, and in the case of any visible or audible phenomenon whatsoever, it is likewise impossible for there to be a single phenomenon that can be found to exist by its very nature, or that can be found to truly exist.Nevertheless, since the mind that is the subjective perceiver is confused, it fixates on the one and the other, which gives us the factors to be negated with respect to the two aspects of lack of identity. Because these are errone­ous notions of taking what does not exist to exist, they are done away with. Therefore, since the factors to be negated cannot possibly be objects, there is nothing to be eliminated, and so it is the elimination of such errone­ous notions (as what is to be negated in the subjective perceiver) that is explained as “negating identity.” If the factors to be negated could be found to actually be objects, one would be unable to eliminate them, no matter how hard one tried! No one at all can negate anything that actually exists as such, just as no one at all can confirm anything that does not actually exist as such.Valid Cognition [d]As for the valid cognition that ascertains these points, the source verses state:"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 163The special attitude that derives from inferential knowledge based on reasoningis the primary kind of valid cognition that ascertains what is ultimately the case.If one summarizes the categories of reasoning that rely on logical arguments,these are proofs of negation, due to a failure to observe something supportive or an observation of something contradictory. [3.151a]Generally speaking, the special attitude that derives from inferential knowledge based on reasoning is the primary kind of valid cognition that ascertains the ultimate level of truth.475 In this regard, there are many detailed analyses that rely on lines of reasoning. If one summarizes these, however, all of them are definitely and solely proofs based on negation, which negate that what is to be negated is something true; according to the criteria employed by logicians, therefore, any proof based on affirma­tion is impossible. To give an example, the statement “X is like an illusion because it is interdependently connected” presents the appearance of being an explicit proof of affirmation; but it does not lead one to any certainty concerning what is ultimately the case, and to the extent that anything is affirmed, it is that X is empty of any true existence.476Proofs of negation are of two kinds—due to either a failure to observe something supportive477 or an observation of something contradictory.478 The proof of interdependent connection belongs to the latter type, the others to the former.479Authentic Reasoning [e]As an explanation of authentic ways of reasoning that investigate what is ultimately the case, the source verses state:The key point of all reasoning that investigates what is ultimately sois investigation that identifies a basis for attributes and then seeks outthat which does not contradict its essential quality and that which contradicts its particular attributes.Therefore, the freedom from being unitary or manifold negates any finite essence,"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"164 - t h e t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g ewhile the negation of production in any of four ways negates particular attributes.These two models are foremost; the rest are simply secondary.The root of all of these is found in the homage to the Middle Way.The key point to all reasoning that investigates what is ultimately the case is as follows: First one identifies some basis for attributes,480 whatever it might be under the circumstances, and then undertakes to seek out that which does not contradict it or its essential quality,481 and to seek out that which contradicts it or its particular attributes.To give an example, if one explains, “The characteristics, or essential qual­ity, of a vase is that it has a roundish body and a flattened base and is capable of performing the function of containing water,”482 one then must investi­gate such issues as the following: “Then it must follow that the mouth of the vase is its roundish body, because of its being the vase.”Therefore, from among these lines of reasoning, those that are foremost in being capable of bringing one to a definitive conclusion that both objects on the external level and consciousness on the internal level do not truly exist are two—that of freedom from being unitary or manifold483 negates any finite essence [3.151b] and that of the negation of production in any of four ways484 negates particular attributes. The many other variations on lines of reasoning that are explained in the Middle Way sources are simply secondary to these.The root, so to speak, of all of these lines of reasoning is found in the homage to the Middle Way by the lord protector Nagarjuna:... revealing that which occurs in interdependent connection, without cessation, without origin, without being denied, without being affirmed, without coming, without going,485without ultimate distinctness, and without ultimate identity, and revealing the thorough subsiding of elaborations to be peace.In accord with this citation, there are four basic lines of reasoning:(1) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—are without cessation in the final analysis or duration in the interim because they are initially unborn."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW - 165(1) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—can­not be found to be separate things because they are not identical.(3) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—do not come, because they cannot be found to have gone.(4) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—can­not be denied because they cannot be affirmed.These four models are the basic lines of unsurpassable reasoning.Specific Middle Way Interpretations [4]An ascertainment of the significance of what is investigated, according to the distinct Middle Way interpretations, is twofold—that of unqualified emptiness and that of qualified emptiness.Unqualified Emptiness [a]The source verses state:In the Autonomist tradition, all substantial things are proven not to truly exist; emptiness is proven so as to eliminate concepts of fixating on them.The Consequentialists negate conceptual elaborations but do not try to prove a freedom from elaboration.Concerning the way in which one comes to a definitive conclusion by investigating things with such reasoning, those who follow the Autono­mist system of the Middle Way school begin by proving that all substantial things do not truly exist. Following this, they understand that the concepts of fixating on that lack of true existence are factors to be eliminated, and so they come to a decision, and so prove, that the lack of true existence, or emptiness, is itself emptiness. The sublime intelligence that thus dispels both extremes—of existence and nonexistence—is not the consummate view since it still involves concepts. [3.151a]While Consequentialists negate the multitudes of conceptual elabo­rations with many variant forms of reasoning, they do not try to prove a freedom from elaboration, since to do so would constitute an incurable poison.486"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThe meaning of the foregoing points has been discussed previously to a small extent.487Qualified Emptiness [b]The source verses state:In particular, in the extraordinary tradition of Yogic Practitioners,it is realized that there is nothing other than mind and that mind does not exist.The nondual basic space of phenomena is endowed with the seven vajra properties.From among the proponents of the philosophical systems of the Middle Way, the tradition of those who are Middle Way Yogic Practitioners488 is adorned with many secret key points that are special and extraordinary. As to the way in which they come to a definitive conclusion about their view by studying teachings and contemplating, as the great regent489 states:Once they are intelligently aware that there is nothing other than mind,they then realize that mind is also nonexistent.When those with intelligence are aware that these two are nonexistent,they dwell in the basic space of phenomena that is unencumbered with these.490In accord with this citation, they begin by coming to a decision con­cerning all phenomena—that these cannot be found to exist as anything other than, or apart from, mind alone. On account of that proof, the objec­tive pole of experience is found to lack any independent nature. Having then come to a decision that the subjective pole also lacks any independent nature, they come to a definitive conclusion concerning the basic space of phenomena—empty of both the objective and subjective poles, flawless and utterly lucid by nature, endowed with the seven vajra properties.491In discussing the definitive conclusion that is gained through contempla­tion, the source verses state:"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW - 167The heart essence of all ordinary beings and buddhas is free of elaboration, in no way resembling any identity of an individual.This is the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, free of the mere lack of identity in the individual, transcending being manifest or nonmanifest, and even inter­dependent connection.What is referred to as “suchness itself” or “the very heart of attaining the state of bliss,”492 is that which permeates and is present in ordinary beings, in buddhas—in all phenomena—in a state of evenness. This is present in ordinary beings in the manner of what lies at their very heart and in bud­dhas in the manner of being fully evident, [3.152b] and so is termed “the very heart of buddhahood” because in essence it undergoes no change.493 Yet it in no way resembles some permanent, unitary, and autonomous identity of an individual since it constitutes a freedom from all limits imposed by elaboration. While there can be no division into a duality of samsara versus nirvana within its very essence, it can be classified into three phases with respect to context.494 It is freed from being merely the view of emptiness (that of lack of identity in the individual), primordially ensured as what is uniquely and ultimately true. And it is freed from being either manifest or nonmanifest, substantial or nonsubstantial; it is truly unconditioned— what is termed “unconditioned ultimate truth.” Since this ultimacy is said to transcend even interdependent connection, the ultimate is not classified as interdependently connected.The source verses state:Empty of adventitious flaws, it is not empty of unsurpassable qualities.There is nothing to be removed or added, for it is realized through naturally occurring pure awareness.Because this selfsame heart essence is empty of all adventitious flaws or distortions yet not empty of unsurpassable qualities (being spontaneously endowed with these), from the point of view of its essence, there are no distortions to be removed or qualities to be added.

This is not an object of inference, because it is beyond language and concepts.Since this mode is difficult for any mind other than that of a spiritually advanced being to comprehend, it has become a topic of controversy, but I will not elaborate here.The fact that this mode of being is difficult to fathom is attested to in the commentary to the Highest Continuum'.To summarize, these four kinds of individuals are considered to lack the vision to behold the very heart of attaining the state of suchness.”495 “What are these four kinds?” you ask. They are ordinary mortal beings, sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhi­sattvas who have newly embarked on their spiritual approach. [3.153a] This is as is said:496O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, the very heart of attaining the state of suchness is not within the realm of experience of those who have fallen into the be­lief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, or those who have overt desire for497 what is mistaken, or those whose minds stray completely from emptiness.498As the foregoing citation indicates, not only we who remain at the level of ordinary mortal beings, but even sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhi­sattvas who have newly embarked on their spiritual approach (who are beginning practitioners on the path of accumulation499) do not have mas­tery of the view of the true nature of reality that is the very heart of attaining the state of bliss. Given that this fact has been clearly expressed by the Lord of Sages, the Lord Regent,500 and others, this is not an object to be evalu­ated by the conventional methods and reasoning of intellectuals, such as"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW - 169some kind of valid cognition that is arrived at on the basis of the power of the thing itself,501 or some inferential knowledge based on reasoning. This is because this way in which things truly abide is beyond the domain of language and conceptual thought.This being so, with the exception of buddhas and spiritually exalted bodhisattvas,502 it is difficult for the minds of others to embrace this mode that lies at the very heart of things, in the true sense of what the term implies. And since this seems contradictory within the framework of lan­guage and concept,503 in the perceptions of half-baked intellectuals who in these times are renowned as supposed “Middle Way proponents”—whose understanding and personal merit are limited and who are lacking in any truly profound intelligence—as profound as this way in which things truly abide may be, to that extent they simply use it as a basis for their unfounded suppositions and denials, thus subverting the four reliances and turning this into a topic of controversy. Therefore, I will not elaborate here on the secret key points of this traditions philosophical system; rather, if one wishes to gain understanding of these points, one should learn them from the scrip­tural sources of the great spiritual traditions of India and Tibet.Advice Integrating Both Traditions [5]As for advice concerning the integration of the underlying intent of the two mainstream traditions, the source verses state:Having realized the individual methods of the two mainstream traditions,one integrates them as a single underlying intent, free of the flaws of exaggeration or denigration.One is endowed with flawless vision concerning the sutras and tantras. [3.153b]Two masters—Nagarjuna and Asanga—were great spiritual guides who unquestionably dwelled on the level of the spiritually advanced, who adorned this human world, and whose coming was indisputably prophesied by the Victorious One. Although there is no question of any hierarchy of higher or lower between their enlightened intentions, the fact that there may seem to be one is due solely to one s lack of good fortune and to one s highly restricted intelligence.504"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"170- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThat being the case, once one has understood the distinct approaches found in the sources of the two masters who codified these mainstream traditions, if one can integrate these through realizing that the enlightened intent of both is, in the final analysis, one and the same—the meaning of the Middle Way—one is freed from the many flaws of misinterpreted supposi­tions or denials. One becomes endowed with the flawless vision of the view concerning all sütras and tantras. Understanding these two approaches— the one more short-term, the other more ultimate; the one more obvious and externally oriented, the other more subtle and internally oriented; the one putting an end to conceptual elaboration, the other focusing on the ultimate point of meditation505—one comes to realize the unerring intent of buddhahood, free of the conceptual imputations found in the minds of ordinary mortal beingé, with ones view of both the sütras and the tantras being unaffected by any flaw of seeing supposed contradictions therein.Mantra Approach [VI]An analysis of the distinctive view of the mantra approach is twofold: the presentation of the position held in general by masters of the Middle Way and that of the specific position held by Gargyi Wangpo.506General Position [A]The source verses state:In the mantra approach, the interpretation of unqualified emptiness is that the subjective aspect is distinguished as the skillful factor of bliss, but that there is no difference in the objective aspect as freedom from elaboration.For the interpretation of qualified emptiness, even the objective aspect is not merely freedom from elaboration; rather, it is posited to be endowed with the most sublime of manifestations, comparable to divination with a mirror.Some say that other than the mere freedom from elaboration, because of the skillful methods involved, the difference is like that between an ordinary fire and one of sandalwood."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 171One might wonder, “In which interpretation of the Middle Way is the view of the secret mantra approach to be found?” In this regard, individual masters have advanced many positions that incline to their own personal inclinations. Nevertheless, the explicit message of this approach is entirely in accord with the final cycle of the Buddhas teachings and that is by and large what is taught in the authoritative source texts from the land of spiritually advanced beings.507 [3.154a] It was only in Tibet that the interpretations of the Middle Way renowned as “unqualified emptiness” and “qualified empti­ness” arose as distinct positions.Those who follow the interpretation of unqualified emptiness posit that the subjective aspect is to be taken as superior508 due to the skillful influ­ence of supreme bliss. With respect to the objective aspect of emptiness as the freedom from elaboration, they maintain that there is no distinction between the approach of mantra and that of the transcendent perfections.509Those who follow the interpretation of qualified emptiness agree with the foregoing concerning the subjective aspect. With respect to the objec­tive aspect of emptiness, however, they posit that this is not merely a free­dom from elaboration, but emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations, transcending even the most subde subatomic structure yet comparable to the visions that occur through the process of divination with a mirror.510And there are some who say that, while the approaches of mantra and the transcendent perfections are in accord simply concerning the essence of emptiness as a freedom from elaboration, the mantra approach is superior as to the way in which realization takes place, because of the special feature of. the skillful means it entails. Speaking generally, the Sakya school and others categorize their view on the basis of both specific phenomena and their true nature; that is, from the point of view of the true nature of phenomena free of elaboration, there is no difference between the approach of mantra and that of the transcendent perfections, but there is a distinction in the mantra approách of the káyas and timeless awareness as specific phenomena. The former point is the basis for the enlightened intent of the venerable Sakya Pandita,511 and he had no objection to the latter.512Specific Position: Gargyi Wangpo [B]The source verses state:"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEIn the Middle Way of the mantra approach, the profoundly lucid unity of bliss and emptiness, the position of the vajra of enlightened speech, who bore the mark of light,is that there are four special attributes—the function of the central channel, the skillful means to experience emptiness, the influence exerted with respect to the ground of being, and the attainment of the kaya of primordial unity.Since origination and cessation are eliminated from that inseparable unity of supreme and unchanging bliss and emptiness as freedom from elab­orations, it is profound and lucid. This unity, endowed with four character­istics513 is the basis for what is characterized as the Middle Way in the mantra approach. There are four special attributes that are associated with it:(i) the function of the central channel,514 that is, the path of skillful meth­ods such as that of focusing intently on the avadbuti;515(2.) other skillful methods to elicit the experience of emptiness, such as the techniques of instantaneous or gradual dissolution;516 [3.154b](3) the influence exerted by establishing a connection, within the context of the ground of being—the way in which things truly abide—between the ground for refinement and the factors that bring refinement;517 and(4) the accomplishment of the consummate kaya of primordial unity that is the specific manifestation.These four are posited by the vajra of enlightened speech, the sixth bearer of the crown marked with light—the scholar from the north, Jamyang Chokyi Nangwa.518Summation: The View of Unborn Primordial Unity [VII]As for a brief summation of the view of unborn primordial unity, the source verses state:If this were not present as the fundamentally unconditioned nature, viewing it as such would not make it so, and when emptiness is realized, cause and effect are spontaneously ensured.Whatever is the ceaseless process of interdependent connection is itself the supreme seal of unborn primordial unity."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"AUTHENTIC VIEW- 17 3Just as washing a lump of coal will never make it a conch shell,519 if the true nature of buddhahood were not present as the reality that is the funda­mentally unconditioned way that things truly abide, it would be impossible for it to become so through a process of investigation involving scriptural authority and reasoning, or through viewing it as such through a process of conceptual meditation.On the basis of the three kinds of sublime intelligence,520 one realizes emptiness in direct experience—not allowing the significance of the utter lucidity of emptiness to remain merely an object of intellectual understand­ing. At that point timeless awareness, which as a consequence is undeluded concerning the significance of cause and effect, is spontaneously ensured, so that its radiance arises as the unceasing process of interdependent con­nection. As this does not in any way deviate from the realization, in one’s direct experience, of its fundamentally unconditioned and unborn nature, there is the primordial unity of skillful method and sublime intelligence. This is termed the “transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence” (prajndpdramitd) or the “supreme seal” (mahamudra), which is the con­summate meaningful state to be realized according to the sutras and tantras.Theforegoing constitutes the commentary on the third part, concerning a definitive treatment o f the view that is the principal factor."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Part 4.

The impact of this is one of arousing faith, uncon­trived yet informed and without any sectarian bias, in the general teachings of the victorious ones (both the Hlnayana and Mahayana approaches) and in the special spiritual mentors who uphold these teachings.Without falling into some extreme of inflexible prejudicial thinking or zealous adherence to ones own personal belief system or dogma, one conducts oneself in a forthright manner, behaving precisely with respect to the process of karmic causality, without confusing moral issues of what to accept or reject.522 The excellent speech of the victorious ones—that is, all the sutras and tantras—serves as one s advisor, as one does not let these teachings remain mere words but applies them to one s experience, feeling a growing sense of freedom.

Of these eight states, four are states within the human realm that are devoid of opportunity:(1) that of people in “border regions,” that is, places in which the four branches of the spiritual community are not present;524"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"178 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(2.) that of people whose faculties are incomplete, due to mental or physi­cal impairment, deafness, and so forth;525(3) that of those with erroneous opinions, who hold that there is no con­tinuity from previous to future lifetimes, or consequences to one s actions, or who deny the validity of the Three Jewels; and(4) that of those in worlds in which buddhas have not appeared and the teachings of the victorious ones are not present.The four nonhuman states devoid of opportunity are (5)-(7) the three lower states of rebirth and (8) that of the long-lived gods. These long-lived gods are explained in Letter to a Friend to be those of both the state devoid of perception and the realm of formlessness;526 of these, the former are found in one region of the state of the Mahaphala gods (associated with the fourth degree of meditative stability),527 as though in a hermitage outside a populated area,528 while the latter are ordinary mortal beings who have been reborn in the realm of formlessness.529 The Account ofthe Eight States Devoid o f Opportunity explains the long-lived gods to be those gods of the desire realm, who are constantly distracted by activities driven by their desires.530Of the ten endowments, five derive from one s own situation:To be a human being, to be reborn in a central region, to have all one s faculties intact, not to have made wrong ethical choices, and to have faith in a spiritual foundation.531“To be reborn in a central region” means to be reborn where the four branches of the spiritual community are active. “To have all one s faculties intact” means that one is not physically or mentally handicapped, and one s limbs, sight, hearing, and so forth, are complete. “Not to have made wrong ethical choices” means that one has not committed, or caused anyone to commit, any of the acts that bring immediate consequences at death.532 “To have faith in a spiritual foundation” means to have faith in the ethical codes of the sacred dharma, as the foundation that gives rise to all positive qualities, whether mundane or transcendent; here the term “ethical codes” refers to any and all of the Three Repositories.533 These five factors are called “endowments that derive from ones own situation” because they are cir­cumstances supporting spiritual practice that pertain to ones own personal experience.The five endowments that derive from others are as follows:"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE- 179The coming of a buddha, the teaching of the sacred dharma, the establishment of a tradition of teachings, the adherence of followers,and the kindness shown for the sake of others.534“The coming,” or advent, “of a buddha” refers to one who has truly awakened to buddhahood [3.156a] after a process of spiritual development spanning three incalculably long eons. “The teaching of the sacred dharma” refers to the teachings presented by such a buddha or by followers of that buddha who are arhats. “The establishment of a tradition of teachings” refers to the fact that, from the time a buddha awakens to enlightenment and teaches until that buddha passes into nirvana, the practice of the teach­ings is unimpaired by way of making the ultimate aspect of the teachings fully evident. “The adherence of followers” of the tradition thus established refers to people being aware that the realization of those teachings has the power to make the sacred dharma evident to ordinary beings, and so fol­lowing those teachings as they were given in accord with such realization.535 “The kindness shown for the sake of others” refers, for example, to sponsors and patrons donating monastic robes. These five factors are called “endow­ments that derive from others” because they are circumstances supporting spiritual practice that pertain to the personal experience of others.Great Purpose [b]Next, one contemplates the great purpose of this state. To have the eight opportunities and ten endowments is called having a “precious human exis­tence” because it is extremely difficult to obtain and once obtained gives one an enormous advantage, for one is then capable of attaining all the lim­itless states of higher rebirth and the definitive excellence of enlightenment. In Letter to Students we read the following:The path that is obtained by human beings with great mental fortitude,and that serves as a support for conveying beings along die path of those gone to bliss, is not obtained by gods, nagas, demigods, garudas, vidyadharas, kimnaras, or mahoragas.536"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Therefore, one contemplates in the following way: “I have obtained, at least for the present, the noble working basis that is the most special one throughout the three realms.537 If I do not then use this support, which has such a great purpose and which is the cause for higher states of rebirth and the definitive excellence of enlightenment, I will be more grievously deluded than someone who returns empty-handed from the fabled Isle of Jewels”Difficulty of Obtaining the Support [c]To contemplate the difficulty of obtaining this support, consider the dif­ficulty from the point of view of the causes of such a rebirth. In general, to obtain any more fortunate state of rebirth requires some degree of sin­cere and positive action, such as ethical discipline. [3.156b] In particular, to obtain these freedoms and opportunities in their entirety requires a great many fundamentally positive factors: you must lay the foundation with completely pure ethical discipline, support this with such qualities as gener­osity, and provide momentum with flawless prayers of aspiration. Consider the fact that, if such factors are necessary, it seems that there are very few cases in which such causes are established, from which one can deduce that, as a consequence, the results—more fortunate states of rebirth in general and these freedoms and opportunities in particular—are difficult to obtain.As for the difficulty from the point of view of the resultant states of rebirth, generally speaking, the Foundation o f Scriptural Transmission states that when beings die and pass from lower or higher states of rebirth, those who go on to a lower state of rebirth are comparable to the motes of dust covering the great earth, while those who go on to higher states are only comparable to the few motes that gather on your fingernail.538 One consid­ers the fact that any merely higher state, when compared to lower states (which bear no resemblance to it) seems to be just within the realm of pos­sibility, while this special state of freedom, even when compared to higher states (which share many common features with it), is exceedingly rare.As for one contemplating the difficulty of obtaining this state through the use of analogy, Šántideva points out:Similar to the case of a turde whose neck might enter the holeof a yoke buffeted on a very turbulent ocean,the state of a human being is said to be very difficult to obtain.539l8o - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE- 181Alternatively, one gains certainty by referring to any number of other analogies, such as that of a star in the daytime or the udumbara flower.540Contemplation of Impermanence [2]The contemplation of impermanence is twofold: the recollection of death (since one will not remain long in this world) and the contemplation of how change occurs when one passes on to another state.Recollection of Death [a]The source verses state:There are three primary topics: death is certain; when one will die is unknown; and when death occurs, anything that is not spiritual will be of no avail.There are secondary considerations: death cannot be prevented, life cannot be extended, and there is never enough time; the time of death is unpredictable, it happens under many circumstances, and life is fragile; and death does not allow us to take our companions, body, or wealth.One recalls death by applying these nine rationales.There are three primary considerations in contemplating death and impermanence: the certainty that one must definitely die (due to the proof of death lying in the fact that one has been born); [3.157a] the uncertainty of when death will occur (due to the proof as proved by the fact that people die unpredictably, both young and old); and the fact that when death occurs, only what is spiritual will be of any benefit (as established through scrip­tural authority). Each of these involves three secondary considerations. There are three rationales for the fact that one is certain to die:(1) the Lord of Death541 is certainly coming for one and no means what­soever can prevent that;(2.) ones life span cannot be extended, and each moment day and night there are factors that shorten it;(3) even while one is still living, death can come suddenly, without there"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"181 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEever being enough time to> carry out all of the plans one has, both secular and spiritual.There are three rationales for the fact that it is unknown when one will die:(4) the length of one s life in this human world is unpredictable, unlike that in other worlds, which is more or less fixed;542(5) there are a great many conditions that can cause death (diseases inside one s body, negative forces and the elements in the external world, and so forth), so that in just staying alive, one is pointed toward death with no other guarantee;(6) ones body is fragile, like a bubble on water, and the slightest injury could end one s life.There are three rationales for the fact that only what is spiritual will be of any benefit, for none of the following will be of any use at death:(7) even though one might have hundreds or thousands of family mem­bers, friends, attendants, or servants, one cannot take a single one of them with one at death;(8) even ones cherished body, which has been with one all along, must be left behind, like so much earth or stone;(9) eyen though one might have incalculable wealth, one cannot take even a single needle with one.One recalls death by applying these nine rationales.Rebirth in Other States [b]The source verses state:Once one has died, one will be reborn in either of two destinies; having contemplated the foregoing, one reorients one s mind away from this lifetime.Given the certainty that one will also die swiftly, one has no chance of remaining in this life, and after death one does not become nothing but must take rebirth. [3.157b] And given that there are only two possible desti­nies, and no other, one will be reborn in either a more or less favorable state. This process is one that is subject to the external influences of karma, not something over which one has any control, and so one takes rebirth under the impetus of ones positive or negative karma."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 183Therefore, one contemplates the suffering of lower states of rebirth, thinking,“What would it be like if I were to be reborn in some lower state?” As Nagarjuna tells us:Bring to mind what a day would be like in the realms of the hells, whether exceedingly hot or cold.Bring to mind as well the tormented spirits who are tortured by hunger and thirst.Observe and bring to mind the forms of animal lifewho are subject to so many sufferings due to their ignorance.Avoid the causes of these states and engage in the causes for happier ones.When one hears of the state of human rebirth in Jambudvlpa, difficult to obtain, one should strenuously put an end to the causes of lower states of rebirth.543There are incalculable forms of suffering, foremost among them those of the hot and cold hells. Again, according to Nagarjuna:If one s own fear is aroused by seeing depictions of the hell realms, hearing of them, recalling them, reading of them, or making one s own depictions, what can be said about those who are actually experiencing the unbearable consequences of their actions?.. ,544 ... Whatever pain one would endure in this life by being pierced violentlywith three hundred spears for a daywould not even come close to, and could not compare with, the smallest suffering in the hell realms.545Tormented spirits are also subject to many kinds of suffering, due to hun­ger and thirst and so forth:Among tormented spirits there is constant and incurable suffering caused by the distress of their unfulfilled desires."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"184 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEUnderstand that they undergo unbearable suffering caused by hunger, thirst, cold, heat, fatigue, and fear.546Animals are subject to such suffering as that of the predation of one spe­cies on another:In animal states of rebirth there are various sufferings, [3.138a] such as being slaughtered, bound, beaten, and so forth.These beings, who have abandoned the virtue that leads to peace, undergo the utterly unbearable pain of preying on one another.547In the foregoing ways, one recalls death and contemplates the sufferings of falling into lower states of rebirth. Thus, one reorients one s mind away from this lifetime and arouses the attitude that one s real concern is for one s future destiny.Reorienting the Mind Away from Samsára [B]There are two ways in which ones mind is reoriented away from samsara: the contemplation of the consequences of karma (which are the causes of happiness and suffering) and the contemplation of the shortcomings of samsára.Karma [1]This has two further parts: the contemplation of karmic consequences in general, and the contemplation of such specific issues as the degree of gravity.General Contemplation [a]The source verses state:Such is the process of karma: it is ineluctable; its results are greatly magnified; actions not committed have no effect; and the effects of actions committed never expire on their own."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 185Generally speaking, whether you are an ordinary mortal individual or a spiritually advanced being,548 all positive experiences that carry with them any pleasant sensation—down to even the slightest pleasure caused by a cool breeze for beings reborn in a hell realm—occur due to positive karma reinforced in the past; it is not in accord with the nature of things that hap­piness be due to negative karma. And all negative experiences that carry with them any unpleasant sensation—down to even the slightest suffering that could occur in the experience of an arhat549—occur due to negative karma one has reinforced in the past; for it is not in accord with the nature of things that suffering be due to positive karma. As the Precious Garland states:All suffering comes from nonvirtue, and so do all lower states of rebirth.From virtue come all fortunate states of rebirth and the happiness within all those rebirths.550Karma is marked by four characteristics: (i) the certainty of the conse­quences of one s actions, (2) the greatly magnified results that come about,(3) the fact that one is never subject to the effects of actions one has not committed, and (4) the fact that the effects of those one has committed never expire on their own.(1) All the various kinds of happiness and suffering derive from the cor- respondingpositive and negative kinds of karma, without the slightest con­flation; neither are these causeless, nor are they due to such dissonant causes as primal matter or a powerful creator.551 [3.158b] Rather, the general states of happiness and suffering come from the general kinds of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions, while myriad specific states of happiness and suffering come about individually from myriad specific actions of the corresponding kinds, without the slightest conflation. The certainty one gains concerning the predictable and ineluctable process of karmic consequences is referred to as the “authentic view” for Buddhists and is extolled as the foundation for all positive qualities.(2) A great degree of happiness results from a small degree of virtuous karma, while a great degree of suffering results from a small degree of non­virtuous karma; and so the kind of magnification from cause to effect that takes place on this inner level is not found in the process of causation in the external world.552 As is said in Didactic Aphorisms:"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Due tQ a small harmful action being committed, something very destructive553 occurs in the next world.This brings about great ruination; it is like poison having been ingested.Due to a small meritorious action being committed, some great happiness is brought about in the next world.This brings about things of great purpose;it is like an abundant harvest of grain ripening.554(3) If one has not reinforced the karma that serves as the cause of either happiness or suffering, one will never experience those pleasant or painful effects. In this regard, the Teacher555 stated that while those who enjoy the fruits of reinforcing positive karma over incalculably long eons do not nec­essarily need to amass all the causes of those results, they still must amass them to some degree.556(4) The virtuous and nonvirtuous actions one has committed bring about their corresponding effects, wanted and unwanted, respectively. As is stated in the Foundation o f Scriptural Transmission'.The effects of actions do not expire on their own, even after a hundreds eons.When circumstances come together and the time is ripe, their effects occur for ordinary beings.*57Specific Issues [b]As for the contemplation of such specific issues as the degree of gravity, the source verses state:The degree of gravity is greatly influenced by the focus, intention, underlying support, and actual content of an action— these bring about results due to complete maturation, results consistent with causes, and governing results. [3.139a]In this regard, there are certainly three avenues through which one engages in conduct,558 whether excellent or ignoble.

As for the overt mental state, this is ones motivation, which comes from a strong attitude that involves one of the three emotional poisons or their absence.565 Familiarity with an action is due to ones committing either a virtuous or a nonvirtuous action many times over, with a familiarity born of having engaged in it over a long time. The essential quality of an act is reflected by the fact that, of the seven kinds of physical and verbal actions, the former kinds are of greater gravity than the latter, while in the case of the three kinds of mental actions, the latter are of greater gravity than the former.566 The focus of the act refers to beneficial or harmful actions com­mitted toward the Buddha, dharma, saiigha, or your guru, for example. A unilateral commitment to counterproductive factors refers to the fact that one is unilaterally committed to negative actions, and not positive ones, throughout one s lifetime; while the elimination o f counterproductivefactors [3.159b] refers to ones rejection of negative influences and involvement in positive actions, free of desire and attachment. As Letter to a Friend states:"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"i88- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEActions performed constantly, with strong feeling, without any remedy,or in which the primary focus is imbued with positive qualities— these factors contribute to five major kinds of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions.Therefore, strive to engage in virtuous activity!567In this citation, the number five refers to two kinds of primary focus—a focus endowed with enlightened qualities (such as the Three Jewels) and a focus of someone who has benefited one (that is, one s father and mother).Actions are powerful due to any of four factors—the focus, the intention, the underlying support, and the actual content of an action.(1) This is a factor because if one commits even a minor beneficial or harmful action, without any strong intention, toward the Three Jewels, or ones guru, or likewise ones parents, the corresponding merit or ignoble­ness is nonetheless great. In particular, bodhisattvas are very powerful foci for one s virtuous (or nonvirtuous) actions. If someone were, out of anger, to imprison all beings in the ten directions in a dark dungeon, it would still be an action of incalculably greater harm for that person to stand with his or her back turned to a bodhisattva and say, “I won’t look at that villain!” It would be an act of far greater harm to be furious with and feel malice toward a bodhisattva and say something spiteful than to tear down and bum as many stupas as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. By the same token, it is also said that they are sublime foci for one to reinforce one s spiritual merit.(2) The sutra Mound o f Precious Gems568 states that there would be more merit in someone who never loses sight of the intention to gain omniscience casting a single flower with the motivation of bodhicitta than in all beings in the three-thousandfold universe each erecting a stupa as large as Sumeru and paying honor to these in all ways that honor can be paid, for tens of millions of eons.In this regard, one should also understand that there are other variables, such as one’s intention—whether the goal is more sublime or more com­mon, [3.160a] or the focus is on ones own or others’ benefit—or the degree of intensity or weakness of the action, or the length or shortness of the dura­tion of the action. With regard to negative conduct, moreover, the more powerful actions are those that involve intense attitudes of afflictive mental states and that take place over longer periods of time, and among all of these"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE- 189factors, anger is an extremely powerful one. Entering the Way o f a Bodhi- sattva states:Whatever excellent conduct has been reinforced for a thousand eons—generosity, honoring of the sugatas, and so forth— can all be destroyed by a single act of anger.569In this regard, it is said that it is extremely grievous to indulge in anger toward someone upholding pure ethics,570 and even more so toward a bodhisattva.571(3) A ball of iron, although small, will sink to the bottom, but it will float on the surface if fashioned into a large bowl. By analogy, it is said that harmful actions have more or less gravity depending on whether they are committed in an unskillful or skillful manner. In this respect, it is further said that the gravity is lessened when one has the skill to create virtue by using the remedy to harmful actions previously committed—regretting them, resolving not to commit them again, and not hiding the fact that one has committed them. But it is a grievous thing not to do the foregoing, and instead to arrogantly presume that it is skillful to engage deliberately in such actions without regard for the consequences.In the case of virtuous actions, as well, there are variables that succes­sively bring about considerable changes in their benefits and advantages— the skillfulness of understanding the key points of such actions, the fact that one is upholding vows, and the fact that one is endowed with a significant degree of meditative absorption.(4) To share the generosity of spiritual teachings in being generous to beings and to honor buddhas with one s spiritual practice are far superior to acts of material generosity and offering. One can understand the other cases on the basis of this illustration.The foregoing paths of action bring about (1) results due to complete maturation, (2) results consistent with causes, and (3) governing results:(1) Each of the ten paths of action has three degrees, depending on the three degrees—great, middling, or small—of the three emotional poisons that are their basis. [3.160b] In this regard, the main text of Levels o f Real­ization states that in the case of each of the ten kinds of actions—killing and so forth—a great degree of emotional poison leads to rebirth in hell states, a middling degree to rebirth in preta states, and a small degree to rebirth in"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"animal states572 (the sutra Ten Levels o f Realization reverses these results in the cases of the middling and small degrees).573(2.) Even though one is reborn from lower states to a human one, there are consequences that follow one. As is said:Killing brings a shortening of life,574causing harm leads to many threats,theft causes a loss of wealth, andbehaving in immoral ways produces many enemies.Speaking lies leads to censure,divisive speech deprives one of companions,abusive language means one will hear unpleasant tilings, andpurposeless talk causes one to hear dishonorable words.Covetous attitudes mean that the hopes in one s mind are dashed,malicious intent ensures fear, anddogmatic belief systems lead to wrongheaded opinions.575(3) These are flaws that occur in the external environment. As is said:Externally, litde is impressive and there are many threats, dust storms, bad odors, and uneven ground, poor soil, environmental upheavals, and poor or failed harvests.576As for the relative power of virtuous actions, using the foregoing discus­sion as a model, the complete maturation is such that virtuous actions of a small, middling, or greater degree lead to rebirth, respectively, as a human, a god of the realm of desire, or a god in the realm of form or formlessness.577 The results that are consistent with the cause and the governing results apply in the reverse manner to those for nonvirtuous actions.As for the distinction between those actions that provide momentum and those that bring completion,578 virtue is the karma that provides momentum for more favorable states of rebirth, while non virtue is the karma diat pro­vides momentum for lower states of rebirth. The karma that brings comple­tion is more unpredictable; those in more favorable states of rebirth can190 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"still have defects of major and minor parts of the body, incomplete facul­ties, ugly complexion, shortness of life, many illnesses, poverty, and so forth, which are accounted for by nonvirtuous karma. There are also animals and pretas who possess great wealth, which is accounted for by virtuous karma. Thus, there are four alternatives: in states in which virtue has provided the momentum, there are both situations in which virtue has brought about completion, and nonvirtue has brought about completion, [3.161a] just as in states in which nonvirtue has provided the momentum, there are both situations in which nonvirtue has brought about completion, and virtue has brought about completion.Of the two lands of karma—that which is certain to be experienced and that which is not—that which is certain to be experienced is action that has been consciously committed and reinforced, while that which is not certain to be experienced is action that has been consciously committed but not reinforced. As for the distinction between committed and rein­forced, “committed” means that which is thought of or, even if not thought of, is carried out through physical and verbal action; “reinforced” refers to actions other than those of the ten kinds and so forth that are committed in dreams, while “not reinforced” refers to actions of the ten kinds that are committed in dreams and so forth.With respect to that which is certain to be experienced, from the point of view of the time frame in which results are experienced, there are three alternatives. “That which is experienced in one s immediate perception” is the result of actions that is experienced in this lifetime. “That which will be experienced upon rebirth” refers to a result that is experienced in the next lifetime. “That which will be experienced in other contexts” refers to what is experienced in the lifetime after that or later.One should contemplate all the foregoing processes very thoroughly.Samsara [2]Contemplation of the sufferings of samsara is twofold: contemplation of eight kinds of suffering and contemplation of three kinds of universal suf­fering.Eight Kinds of Suffering [a]The source verses state:FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 191"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"192 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEBirth, aging, illness, death, being separated from what is appealing,encountering what is unappealing, striving for what one desires and not finding it, and the suffering of the aggregates that perpetuate samsara:...While it is patently easy to understand that the nature of lower states of rebirth is one of suffering, there is also no true happiness in higher states, for in general the nature of samsara in its entirety is one of suffering. As the lord protector Maitreya points out:Just as there is no pleasant odor in filth, there is no real happiness in the five states of ordinary being;579 the sufferings of these states are like that of being in constant contact with fire, weapons, or corrosive salt.580Of these sufferings, eight are primary:(1) Birth is fraught with suffering, birth entails tendencies toward the perpetuation of ignoble states of existence, birth is a context for further suffering, [3.161b] birth provides a context for afflictive mental states, and birth leads to unwanted separation.581 Given that this is the very nature of birth, it entails these five attendant kinds of suffering.(2) There are five sufferings attendant on death: the body degenerates, strength wanes, faculties weaken, the enjoyment of sense objects fades, and life itself is completely undermined.(3) There are five sufferings attendant on falling ill: the body’s constitu­tion changes, pain and mental discomfort increase, there is no power to enjoy pleasant sense objects, what is unwanted must be endured,582 and one comes close to losing one s life.(4) One contemplates the five sufferings that are attendant on dying. There is separation from four aspects of the richness of living—family, entourage, material wealth, and one s own body—as well as the actual suf­fering of dying and the intense experience of unwanted sensations.(5) There are five aspects to the suffering of encountering what is unap­pealing: there is the pain and mental distress aroused simply by ones encountering those who are like enemies; there is the further terror of pun­ishment and physical injuries inflicted by them; there is the fear of being slandered; there is the fear of dying in a state of anxiety; and there is the fear of being apprehensive that after death one will fall into a lower state of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"rebirth due to having flouted what is spiritual.(6) One contemplates the five aspects to the suffering of being sepa­rated from what is appealing: mental anguish is aroused if one is separated from companions, for one is devastated at losing them; one cries aloud in anguish; physical harm is done to one’s body;583 one s mind is tormented by the longing brought on by memories of former sense pleasures; and one s experiences of enjoyment no longer feel complete.(7) There are five topics to contemplate concerning the suffering of striv­ing for what one desires and not finding it; these are similar to those in the preceding case of being separated from what is appealing. In essence, this is the suffering of taking up farming but having your crops fail, or going into business but failing to turn a profit, and so forth. [3.162a] This is the suffer­ing of disappointment that comes from seeking and striving for whatever one hopes for, only to fail to attain it.The foregoing are definitely experienced by all beings subsumed within the four methods of rebirth but are primarily associated with human beings, so much so that some classify them solely as “the sufferings of the human condition.”(8) In brief, diere are five topics involved in contemplating the fact that the five mind-body aggregates that perpetuate samsara are described as “suf­fering.” Over and over, one contemplates the following topics: (a) that these constitute a context for the suffering in a situation becoming fully manifest, (b) that they constitute a context for the suffering that takes place on the basis of that situation having become fully manifest, (c) that they constitute a context for overt suffering, (d) that they constitute a context for the suf­fering of change, and (e) that their nature is one of subliminal suffering. To elaborate:(a) Due to these aggregates having been taken up,584 the sufferings of the rest of one s life are ushered in.(b) With the aggregates already in place, they serve as the basis for such attendant sufferings as those of aging and falling ill.(c) and (d) Since these two kinds of suffering are entailed in the perpetu­ation of ignoble states of existence, they develop accordingly.(e) The mere fact that the mind-body aggregates, which perpetuate samsara, are ensured means that they do so with a nature that is one of sub­liminal suffering, because everything that is subliminally conditioned due to the external influences of karma and afflictive mental states from previ­ous lifetimes constitutes suffering on a subliminal level.If one does not arouse a genuine sense of disenchantment with samsara,FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 193"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"194 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEwhose nature is that of the mind-body aggregates that perpetuate it, one will not arouse an equally genuine attitude of seeking liberation and will also have no real chance of arousing supreme compassion toward the ordi­nary beings who wander in samsara. Hence, this contemplation is crucial regardless of which approach one embarks upon, Hlnayana or Mahayana.Three Kinds of Universal Suffering [b]As for contemplation of the three kinds of universal suffering, the source verses state:... For everyone, moreover,there is nothing reliable, nothing satisfying, and this has been going on forever.Contemplating the three kinds of suffering, the mind reorients itself away from samsara.Letter to a Friend states that six flaws pertain to all beings who are in samsara: nothing is predictable, one can never know satisfaction, bodies are cast off again and again, the relentless continuity of rebirth asserts itself over and over, circumstances change from high to low and back again, [3.161b] and one is on one s own, without real companionship.585If these points are summarized, there are three considerations: (1) there is nothing in samsara upon which one can depend, (1) no matter how much of its happiness one may enjoy, there is no end point at which one will truly be satisfied, and (3) this process has proceeded relentlessly throughout beginningless time.(1) This has four implications:(a) It is inappropriate to depend on having attained a body, for bodies are cast off again and again.(b) It is inappropriate to depend on circumstances being either benefi­cial or harmful, for one s father could be reborn as one s child, one s mother as one s spouse, one s enemy as one s friend, and so forth, without any pre­dictability.586(c) It is inappropriate to depend on the achievement of any prosperity, for one only falls from a high place to a low one.(d) It is inappropriate to depend on companionship, for one will go forth587 unaccompanied.(1) As one has moved entirely within the cycle of existence, with no evi­"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"dent starting or ending point, one might have become a powerful master among gods or humans and enjoyed boundless sense pleasures. Neverthe­less, this has been like trying to slake your thirst with salt water or scratch an incurable itch, for one has never known the slightest real satisfaction. Thus, one s compulsive urges only increase more and more.(3) This refers to the relentless process of continuity, that is, the succes­sion of rebirths with no evident end point. Other sufferings felt by human beings are discussed in Advice for the M ultitude:All the sufferings of lower states, without exception, seem to be the case for human beings, too.There is intense pain comparable to that of the hellsand poverty like that of denizens in the world of the lord of death.588In this state,589 there is also the suffering of animals, for the powerful oppress and tyrannize the powerless.This is like a flowing river.590And in the Four Hundred Verses we read the following:For the highly placed there is mental suffering, while for the lowly it is born of the body; each and every day, the two kinds of suffering591 bring destruction in the world.592Furthermore, die minds of demigods are tormented by their envy of the splendor and wealth of the gods, on the basis of which diey fight with the gods, only to experience as well the many sufferings of their bodies being hacked and beaten. [3.163a] It is said that even though they are endowed with intelligence, they are obscured by the consequences of their karma and so are incapable of beholding what is true in those circumstances.Gods in the realm of desire undergo the sufferings of dying and falling from that state, the suffering of becoming demoralized,593 and such suffer­ings as being hacked, beaten, killed, driven away, and so forth.594 Gods in the two higher realms595 do not have overt suffering but nonetheless are subject to afflictive mental states and are obscured, and so suffer due to dying and falling from those states, having to take ignoble states ofxebirth due to their lacking freedom to remain in their states.FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 195"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"196 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGETo summarize, one contemplates the fact that, regardless of where one is reborn in any state within the three realms, high or low, the process is one of constantly floundering about in a ocean of the three kinds of suffering— overt suffering, the suffering of change, and subliminal suffering. One thus reorients one s mind away from samsara.Reorienting the Mind Away from Quiescence and Naive Happiness [C]As for reorienting the mind away from quiescence and naive happiness, the source verses state:Through seven practical instructions concerning cause and effect, the basis for arousing an attitudeof concern for the welfare of others is established by an even- minded attitude and a sense of empathy.Seeking enlightenment as ones goal, with loving-kindness, great compassion,and altruistic motivation, one reorients ones mind away from quiescence and naive happiness.Having thus contemplated the shortcomings of samsara, one sees the whole of conditioned existence as being like a pit of fire. If those whose minds are completely consumed by the wish for liberation—which will cause afflictive mental states and suffering to thoroughly subside—were to train in the path of the three higher trainings,596 they would indeed gain the liberated state of freedom. But although they would not revert from this state to something like the splendor of higher states of rebirth,597 it never­theless constitutes a state in which flaws have only partially been removed and positive qualities only partially attained, and so their own benefit is not complete. For this very reason, die benefit they can bring to others amounts to something quite limited. In the final analysis, they are exhorted by bud- dhas and see that it is only logical that they must embark on the Mahayana approach. Given that the awakening attitude, bodhicitta, is the avenue through which one enters that approach, it is once that has awakened in one s ongoing experience that one is considered a Mahayana practitioner. [3.163b] Concerning this point, the Cluster o f Stems states:"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"O child of spiritual heritage! Bodhicitta is like the seed of all the Buddhadharma.598In this regard, regardless of what conditions come together, a grain of barley is not suitable to be the cause of rice or any other plant, being the specific cause of its own seedling, while the water and fertilizer and so forth that the grain absorbs are also causes of the barley seedling.599 In a similar fashion, from among the causes of the “seedling” of buddhahood, bodhi­citta is the specific cause (comparable to the seed grain), while the sublime intelligence that realizes emptiness is the specific cause (comparable to water, fertilizer, and so forth) of the three degrees of enlightenment.600 It is for these reasons that the Highest Continuum says:Dedication to the sublime approach is the seed, while sublime intelligenceis the mother that gives birth to the buddhas and the dharma.601Thus, it describes dedication to the sublime spiritual approach as being comparable to one s father s seed, while the sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of identity is comparable to one s mother. To extend the analogy, since it is impossible for a Tibetan father to sire a Chinese or Mongolian child, the father is the cause that defines the child’s ethnicity; but since a Tibetan mother can bear children of various ethnicities, she serves as the common cause.602As Nàgârjuna says in his praise of the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence:You upon whom buddhas, pratyekabuddhas,and srâvakas definitely rely,you alone are the path to liberation;it can certainly be said that “there is no other.”603That is to say, even srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas rely on that intelli­gence, which is why the perfection of sublime intelligence is referred to as the “mother.”604 And so, because it is the “mother” of both Hïnayàna and Mahâyâna “children,” the distinction between the Hïnayàna and the Mahâyàna is not made on the basis of the sublime intelligence that realizesFOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 197"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"198 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEemptiness, but rather is made on the basis of bodhicitta and its truly mag­nificent conduct.Therefore, given that it is necessary to train in the awakening attitude of bodhicitta from the outset, there are two methods of practical instructions concerning this, which are both lineages transmitted through the Noble Lord.605 [3.164a]The instructions transmitted by Tumton Lodro Drak, who was a student of Sharawa,606 involve five stages of cause and effect. These entail one pursu­ing the following train of thought:“Given that I must attain buddhahood, as the cause of buddhahood, (1) bodhicitta is necessary. As the cause of that, (2) compassion is necessary. As the cause of that, (3) loving-kindness is necessary. As the cause of that, (4) knowledge of what has been done for me and a desire to repay that kindness are necessary. And as the cause of that, (5) knowledge of all beings having been my parents is necessary.“All beings have been my parents. How very kind they have been! Why shouldn’t they all be free of suffering and instead be happy and joyful? In order to bring them to happiness, I will attain buddhahood. And having attained buddhahood, I will furthermore bring all beings to that state of buddhahood!”Alternatively, it is said that one trains one s mind607 through seven prac­tical instructions concerning cause and effect, which were transmitted by Tsangpa Rinpoche, a student of Jayulwa.608 If one adopts the point of view of these instructions, they state that buddhahood itself, as that which is to be attained, does not come about without cause or condition. Rather, it comes about from (1) bodhicitta as its cause. This in turn comes about from(2) completely pure altruistic motivation. This comes from (3) supreme compassion. This comes from (4) supreme loving-kindness. This comes from (5) a sense of empathy.609 This comes from (6) knowledge of what has been done for one and a desire to repay that kindness. And this comes from(7) cultivating the idea of beings as ones mother.In this regard, the basis for arousing an attitude of concern for the welfare of others lies in establishing an even-minded attitude in oneself that is free of attachment or aversion toward beings. Initially one cultivates this even­mindedness toward those whom one regards as neutral—that is, who have done one neither good nor harm. Then one extends this attitude toward those who are loved ones and friends, then to those who are enemies who harm one, and then to all beings."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"With respect to the foregoing, one contemplates as follows: “From the perspective of ordinary beings, they are all alike in wishing to be happy and not wishing to suffer. Thus, it is not reasonable that I should treat certain of them as close to me and try to help them, [3.164b] while holding others at a distance and trying to harm them (or at the very least not trying to help them).” One also thinks, “From my own perspective, given that I have been in samsara throughout beginningless time, there is no being whomsoever who has not been my friend a hundred times over, so to whom should I be attached and to whom should I feel averse?” This is as stated in the interme­diate version of Stages o f M editation^One then develops a sense of empathy toward everyone.611 That is to say, one thinks of each and every being s having been one s mother, recalls their kindness, and therefore contemplates the necessity of repaying that kind­ness by ensuring their release from samsara. Since it is held that the means to liberate them from samsara is for one to seek the state of supreme enlight­enment as one s goal, one should train one s mind in cultivating its causes— attitudes ofloving-kindness, compassion, and altruistic motivation.Loving-kindnessOf these, the focus for loving-kindness is beings who are lacking in hap­piness. The forms it takes are the thoughts, “Why shouldn't they find happiness?” “May they find happiness!” and “I will ensure that they find happiness.” The benefits and advantages of this are boundless, as is illus­trated by the following passage from the Precious Garland:Even if one were to give away three hundred vessels of food three times each day, the merits of this could not compare in the slightest to even an instant ofloving-kindness.Gods and human beings will treat one lovingly, they will also protect one,one will have mental happiness, many other kinds of happiness, will not be harmed by poisons or weapons,will realize one s goals effortlessly, and be reborn in the world of purity.FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 199"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"2.00- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEAnd so even if one does not gain liberation, one gains these eight qualities of loving-kindness.612As for the stages in meditation, initially one should meditate on loved ones and friends, then on those to whom one feels neutral, and then on enemies. One then meditates, step by step, on all beings. [3.165a]As to the way in which one meditates, just as one would arouse compas­sion by contemplating over and over the way in which beings are afflicted by suffering, here one contemplates over and over the way in which beings are devoid of happiness, lacking any virtue, whether corruptible or not.613 Once one has become familiar with this, the wish that they find happiness will occur as a matter of course. Furthermore, one brings to mind all kinds of virtue and mentally confers these on beings.614CompassionThe focus for compassion is beings who are afflicted by any of the three kinds of suffering. The forms it takes are the thoughts, “Why shouldn’t they be free of those sufferings?” “May they be free of them!” and “I will ensure that they are free of them.” As for the stages in meditation, initially one should meditate on loved ones and friends, then on those to whom one feels neutral, then on enemies, and on all beings in the ten directions. (Such successive meditations on impartiality, loving-kindness, and compas­sion, distinguishing their respective objects, were set forth by the master Kamalasila, following the model found in the sutras of the abhidharma class;615 these are exceedingly profound key points.)As to the way in which one cultivates compassion, it is by contemplating the ways in which these beings (who have been one’s mother), having fallen into conditioned states of existence, experience general and specific forms of suffering. As to the measure of having successfully aroused compassion, the first version of Stages o f Meditation says the following:At whatever point compassion is engaged as a matter of course, expressing itself as the wish to rid all beings forever of suffering (as though they were ones unhappy children with whom one feels a sense of empathy), so that one takes on that same qual­ity oneself—at that point this is perfected, and so can be called “supreme compassion.”616"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"From this one can also understand the measure of having successfully aroused loving-kindness.Altruistic MotivationHaving thus cultivated loving-kindness and compassion, [3.165b] one finally thinks, “Alas! These beings, who are dear to me and with whom I feel empathy, are thus lacking in happiness and tormented by suffering. I will do whatever it takes to ensure that they find happiness and are liberated from suffering.” As for accepting the responsibility to liberate them, one trains ones mind, even if only by giving lip service, so that one never loses sight of the intention that they gain higher states of rebirth in the shorter term, while one s desire is that they be brought solely to supreme enlightenment and not just to some more limited state of mere liberation.617 This is what constitutes the especially superior states of higher altruistic motivation.In this regard, spiritually advanced beings of the sravaka and pratyeka- buddha approaches do not regress back into samsara, their minds abiding innately in the absence of conceptual elaborations, and are endowed with entirely authentic qualities of enlightenment, so that from our perspec­tive as ordinary mortal individuals, they are indeed truly awe-inspiring. However, by comparison to the way in which buddhas and bodhisattvas eliminate the two kinds of obscuration;618 to the way in which their time­less awareness unfolds as awareness of the true nature of things just as it is and awareness of things in their multiplicity; to the way in which they are endowed with limitless qualities of enlightenment; to the way in which the force of their innate compassion and the dynamic energy of their spiritual power and might (which are all difficult to realize) are present in them; and to the way in which their enlightened activity ensues to carry out benefit for beings in all places and at all times—by comparison to these inconceivable aspects, the freedom experienced by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is so very much smaller in scope. By analogy, the difference is greater than that between Sumeru and a mustard seed!Therefore, one contemplates over and over, “I will attain perfect enlight­enment and the sublime state of liberation, for this is by nature such that all processes of elimination and realization have been completely perfected for my own benefit, while enlightened activity for the benefit of others is inexhaustible. Come what may, may I attain buddhahood!” In this way, one reorients one s mind away from the inferior goals of quiescence and naive happiness.FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE - 201"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"201- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEReorienting the Mind Away from Dualistic Consciousness [D]As for reorienting one s mind away from the dualistic mode of conscious­ness, the source verses state:Investigating the significance of the unborn nature of all phenomenawith discernment, one reorients one's mind away from dualistic consciousness.Using ones discerning powers of sublime intelligence, [3.166a] again and again one examines and investigates the significance of the fact that the nature of all phenomena—those of the deeply ingrained afflictive state and those of the totally refined state—is primordially unborn. From this comes the timeless awareness of a spiritually advanced being, and one s mind is reoriented away from the confusion, in its entirety, of how things appear at present to dualistic consciousness. The objects in this case consist of topics discussed previously, such as the two levels of truth, while the subjective perceiver of these consists of this selfsame discerning quality. Its important role in the development of sublime intelligence born of contemplation is spoken of in the Chapter o f Kasyapa:O Kasyapa, it is thus. To use an analogy, suppose two trees are rubbed together by the wind, which causes them to burst into flame. Once this has happened, both trees are burned up. In a similar fashion, O Kasyapa, if one has authentic discernment, this causes the faculty of sublime intelligence in a spiritually ad­vanced being to develop, and once this has developed, that self­same authentic discernment is “incinerated.”619This passage states that the sublime intelligence of a spiritually advanced being develops from this discernment. In the intermediate version of Stages o f Meditation, moreover, we read the following:In this way, sublime intelligence is used to thoroughly investigate thus.

He or she also realizes the very nonexistence of the very essence of all phenomena.When one does not meditate using sublime intelligence to examine precisely the very essence of a thing but rather engages in meditation solely by completely eliminating all conceptual processes, that will never do away with conceptual thought and also will never lead621 to realization of the very nonexistence of the very essence because the perspective of sublime intelligence is absent.In this way, if the fire of knowing what is authentic, just as it is, comes from authentic discernment itself, then die wood of conceptual thought will be incinerated, just like the fire brought on by rubbing wooden sticks together.This is what the transcendent and accomplished conqueror proclaimed.622As for the important role that contemplation plays in meditation, more­over, we may quote from holy masters of the past, who said: [3.166b]Gathering together in ones mind the teachings one has heard previously, over and over one must contemplate them, evalu­ate them, and truly understand them. Someone who allows the teachings to be forgotten and trains only in some focusing of the mind is left without any allies.

These six are used to analyze things in detail, from visual forms to omniscience.These can be understood in three ways: meaning, reality just as it is, and things in all their multiplicity.The preparation and the main practice are subsumed, respectively, within discernment and an unwavering state.Cultivating Profound Insight [iv]As for the way insight is cultivated in meditation, having used sublime intelligence to investigate the fact that things lack identity, one rests in equipoise in a state free of conceptual elaborations.The bases for the investigation—the nonconceptual images—"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"212- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEare focused on as bases of attributes, while any false assumptions concerning their specific attributes are eliminated.The nature of what is perceived is known to be empty, like space; what is to be examined—the origin, location, shape, and so forth, of the perceiving consciousness— and the discerning function itself are like fire sticks consumed by fire.

For no matter how profoundly one has studied and contemplated, in the absence of meditation, this will not bring about freedom from bondage.To give two analogies: A farmer may reap a fine harvest, but unless it is consumed, one s hunger will not be assuaged, for it is meant to be eaten. Alternatively, no matter how skilled one is at reading and thinking about and knowing about medical prescriptions, that skill will not assuage the pain of one s disease, for the medicinal regimen must be followed.Identifying Meditative Absorption [II]The source verses state:Seek for certainty about the themes for the vast range of meditative absorption— in the Hlnayana and Mahayana approaches—in the two aspects of calm abiding and profound insight.In citing the pronouncement of the transcendent and accomplished con­queror,628 th e Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states that all the states of meditative absorption in the Hlnayana and Mahayana approaches are subsumed within the aspects of calm abiding and profound insight:Whatever presentations there are concerning the many expres­sions of meditative absorption for iravakas, for bodhisattvas, and for tathagatas, one should know that all of these are sub­sumed within calm abiding and profound insight.629Thus, for those who are motivated to develop meditative absorption, but who cannot thoroughly investigate its endless categories, the universal themes for the vast range of states of meditative absorption are twofold— those of calm abiding and profound insight. Therefore, one begins by seek­ing to gain certainty concerning these two aspects.One might wonder, “What is the necessity for doing so?” As the Defini­tive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states, all qualities found in the Hlnayana and Mahayana approaches, whether they are mundane or tran­scendent,630 are the results of calm abiding and profound insight. [3.167b] As this source states:"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"114- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEO Maitreya, you should know that all virtuous factors, both mundane and transcendent—whether they pertain to ¿ravakas, or to bodhisattvas, or to tathagatas—are the results of calm abid­ing and profound insight.631Extensive Explanation of Meditative Absorption [III]This explanation has five topics: the essence of these aspects, a definition of the terms, the reason that two aspects are necessary, die developmental process involved, and the way in which one trains in the significance of the individual aspects.Essence of Meditative Absorption [A]The source verses state:In essence, these are a one-pointed state of attention and the discernment that thoroughly analyzes phenomena.As to what these aspects constitute in essence, calm abiding is essen­tially a one-pointed state of attention that is focused within an authentic framework, while profound insight is essentially the discerning and sub­lime intelligence that thoroughly analyzes phenomena and comprehen­sively investigates suchness itself. As we read in the Cloud o f the Rare and Excellent:Calm abiding is simply a one-pointed state of mind; profound insight is discernment.632And as Vasubandhu states, by way of commentary on this text:One should know that calm abiding and profound insight are to be understood to be a sequence because they constitute, re­spectively, mind settling in mind633 and a thorough analysis of phenomena, both relying on an authentic state of meditative absorption; neither can be the case in the absence of meditative absorption. Such are the characteristics of calm abiding and pro­found insight.634"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"And as die intermediate version of Stages o f Meditation explains:With the calming of distractions due to external sense objects, one takes delight in engaging with a focus, continuously and as a matter of course, and rests in mind itself, which is imbued with thorough pliancy;635 this is termed “calm abiding.” “Profound insight” constitutes whatever thorough investigation of such­ness itself takes place when one is focused on that state of calm abiding.636Definition of Terms [B]The source verses state:As for the derivation of these terms, with the calming [zhi\\ of dis­traction, there is abiding [gnas\\ to the highest degree, [3.168a] and theprofoundly [lhag] special quality of things is seen with the insight \\mthong] of the vision of sublime intelligence.As for the etymology and meaning of the Sanskrit terms, in the word sa- matha, the component sama means “calm” [Tib. zhi ba], while tha637 means “abiding” [Tib. gnaspa]. Thus, “calm abiding” means that once the mind distracted by forms and other sense objects has become calm, it abides one- pointedly in any given state of meditative stability that one is cultivating.In the word visesapasyaf8 the component visesa639 means “special qual­ity” [Tib. khyad par] or “profound quality” [Tib. lhag pa], while pasyaG40 means “having insight” [Tib. mthong ba] or “seeing” [Tib. Ita ba]. Thus, “profound insight” means that there is insight due to the perspective of sub­lime intelligence that sees the profoundly special quality of things—that is, their true nature.Necessity of Both Aspects [C]The source verses state:Similar to a lamp s being unstirred by wind and burning brightly, when both aspects come together, the true way of abiding itself is realized.FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 125"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"One might wonder why both aspects are needed, with neither calm abid­ing nor profound insight being sufficient on its own. To give an analogy, if a lamp is both unstirred by wind and burning brightly, one can see things clearly, whereas one cannot see if the lamp is, for example, stirred by wind, even though it is bright. Similarly, if one is endowed with both sublime intelligence that ascertains the meaning of suchness itself in an unmistaken manner and meditative stability in which the mind can abide at will on its focus, one will perceive that suchness clearly. However, even though one has meditative stability (which ensures that the mind abides without wavering), without the sublime intelligence for understanding the way things actually are, one could not possibly realize the way in which they truly abide. And even though one has the view of realizing the absence of any identity,641 without meditative absorption in which the mind abides one-pointedly, one could not possibly perceive the way things actually are with any clar­ity. Therefore, all the sutras and tantras advise the way of integrating these aspects, for the underlying intention is that one will realize suchness itself when both aspects—those of calm abiding and profound insight—come together.Developmental Process [D]The source verses state:The developmental process involves a relationship of support and supported.The developmental process of calm abiding and profound insight involves a relationship between them of, respectively, a support and what is supported, similar to that between oil and the lamp it fuels. [3.168b] According to Engaging in the Conduct o f a Bodhisattva:Having understood that profound insight utterly imbued with calm abidingwill completely overcome afflictive mental states,one first seeks calm abiding 642Therefore, one begins by establishing calm abiding and, based on that, cultivates profound insight. There is a reason for this order: it is because2.2.6 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"profound insight consists of using discerning and sublime intelligence to perceive, just as it is, the true way in which mind abides; and in order for such perception to take place, it must certainly be the case that the mind being perceived is pliable and has been brought under control, which depends on there being calm abiding to begin with.Training in Meditative Absorption [E]The explanation of how one trains in the significance of the individual aspects is twofold: a more extensive explanation of the individual aspects, and a summary of the general principles.Extensive Explanation [1]This explanation is threefold: the way of training in calm abiding, in pro­found insight, and in these aspects in conjunction with one another.Training in Calm Abiding [a]The first explanation is fourfold: reliance on the circumstances that are sup­portive of calm abiding; analysis of the stages of calm abiding; the process of how these stages are cultivated in meditation; and the measure of success gained through meditation, together with its benefits and advantages.Supportive Circumstances [i]The source verses state:One dispenses with all that is counterproductive by relying on the circumstances for calm abiding— dwelling in a conducive place, having few wants, knowing contentment,observing pure discipline, and avoiding distractions and concepts.That is to say, for those who wish to accomplish calm abiding, it is crucial that they rely on the causes, or circumstances, for it. As the Lord [Atlsa] says in his Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment'.FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 217"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEWith the factor of calm abiding impaired, though one were to meditate with intense effort even for thousands of years, one would not accomplish meditative absorption.Therefore, rely entirely on all the factors outlinedin the Chapter on the Circumstances for Meditative Absorption.^With respect to any pure focus whatsoever,6'14 one s mind should settle in a virtuous context.645Once an advanced spiritual practitioner accomplishes calm abiding, levels of deeper discernment are also accomplished.646 [3.169a]One might wonder, “What are these circumstances?” According to the intermediate version of Stages o f Meditation:To dwell in a conducive place, to have few wants, to be content, to completely avoid having many activities, to observe pure dis­cipline, and to completely avoid the concepts and distractions of desire and so forth.647And in the Ornament ofthe Mahay ana Sutras we read:The place in which an intelligent person will practice is where everything fine is provided, with a fine dwelling, a fine environment, fine companions,and the things that delight an advanced spiritual practitioner.648That is to say, everything fine is provided means that it is easy to come by food and clothing. A fine dwelling is where one is not subject to such threats as bandits and thieves. A fine environment is one in which one will not fall ill. Fine companions are those whose view and conduct are in accord with ones own. The things that delight are such things as the absence of busyness caused by people and the absence of the hardship of noise.In such ways, one:(1) dwells in a conducive place\\(1) hasfew wants for fine food and clothing;(3) knows contentment with these being simply adequate;(4) completely avoids having many activities, such as business matters,"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"and observes pure discipline, without any flaw or breach of one s vows (both those of individual liberation and the bodhisattvapath); and(5) completely avoids concepts concerning desires, keeping in mind that they create many problems in this lifetime.In addition, one should rely completely on the advice given by the lord Atlsa in his Chapter on the Circumstances fo r Meditative Absorption, where he discusses the circumstances or supports for calm abiding, as well as coun­terproductive factors.Stages of Calm Abiding [ii]The source verses state:An analysis includes the mind of the realm of desire, the states of meditative stability, the formless realm, and the state of cessation.If we analyze calm abiding according to the working bases,649 or kinds of beings, we find that there are four categories of stages that are included (i) within the mind of the realm of desire, (2.) within the states of meditative stability, [3.169b] (3) within the states of meditative equipoise associated with the formless realm, and (4) within the meditative equipoise of cessa­tion.650 The ways in which these stages unfold can be found in earlier and later discussions throughout this work.651Process of Cultivation [iii]The process by which these stages of calm abiding are cultivated is three­fold: establishment of physical posture, presentation of the means of set­tling the mind, and identification of the experiences that develop from these methods.Physical Posture [aa]The source verses state:The process of meditation involves sitting comfortably in a physical posture that has eight points.FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 129"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"When one is cultivating calm abiding, physical posture is very impor­tant from the outset. In this regard, one sits on a comfortable seat, with one s posture having eight points. As described in the Stages o f Medita­tion,652 these are as follows: one s legs arq fully crossed or half-crossed; ones’ eyes are half-closed and focused beyond the tip of ones nose; ones body is held erect; ones shoulders are even; ones nose serves as the guide for ones gaze;653 ones lips and teeth are slightly parted; ones tongue rests against ones hard palate; and ones breathing is allowed to occur quite naturally, without any effort.Settling the Mind [bb]The presentation of the means of settling the mind is twofold: a general discussion of the focus employed, and the actual discussion of the specific stages of meditation.General Framework [1']The source verses state:In general, the focus can be any of four—pervasive, purifying one of former behavior, involving knowledge, or purifying one of afflictive states—and accords with the individual.Generally speaking, the transcendent and accomplished conqueror654 spoke of four kinds of focus used by advanced spiritual practitioners:(1) As for a pervasive focus,655 there are four alternative ways in which ones goal can be realized. The first two are those of (a) resting without any process of mental investigation or (b) using a focus in which one does use mental investigation. One may also meditate on (c) the “limit of things”656 (both things in their multiplicity and their true nature just as it is) or (d) the significance of any of these657 and thus effect a transformation, which are ways of validating the purpose of the practice.658(2) As for a focus that purifies one of former behavior, there are five alter­natives. One s behavior in one s earlier life might have been due to a pre­dominance of desire, anger, delusion, pride, or discursiveness. The respective remedies are to meditate on what is unattractive, loving-kindness, interde­230 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION- 131pendent connection, a detailed analysis of one s mind-body complex, or the coming and going of the breath.659 [3.170a](3) As for a focus involving knowledge, there are again five alternatives— that is, knowledge concerning the mind-body aggregates, the components of one s ordinary experience, the sense fields, the twelve links of interdepen­dent connection, or what is appropriate and inappropriate.660(4) As for a focus that purifies one of afflictive mental states, there are two alternatives—the higher and lower levels of the coarser state of calm abiding,661 or the sixteen topics (impermanence and the rest) pertaining to the Four Truths.662From among all the foregoing alternatives, which focus is used by any given individual must accord with one s acumen. If one is an individual subject to a predominance of one influence or another (from desire to discursiveness), one should use the corresponding definitive theme (from unattractiveness to the coming and going of the breath). If one is an indi­vidual who has behaved in a balanced way, or who is subject to few afflic­tive mental states, one may focus one s attention using any of the foregoing themes.Specific Stages of Meditation [2']The actual discussion of the specific stages of meditation is threefold: set­tling with a physical support, settling without such a support, and settling in the very essence of meditation.663Settling with a Support [a]The source verses state:As for specific ways of settling the mind, these may involve an impure or pure physical support.With regard to the specific ways of settling the mind, what is important at the outset is training that uses a physical support. One may setde one s mind using some impure object, such as a small stick of wood or a pebble, to focus one s attention. Alternatively, one may use a pure object—a painted or sculpted image (such as an image of the Buddha), a sacred syllable, a symbolic emblem,664 and so forth."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"2.32. - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGESettling without a Support [bf]Concerning the way in which one settles one s mind without a support, the source verses state:Without a physical support, one settles one s mind on a partial impression up to a complete one, or uses some external or internal focus on the body or something related to it.Once one has gained some sense of ones minds abiding on a physical support, one calls to mind some object that is not such a support, such as the image of an enlightened being s form. Initially the impression is partial, as one focuses ones attention on some specific part (such as the face or hands); this is called “having a partial focus.” Once one has become familiar with that, one can focus one s attention on a general impression of the com­plete form; this is called “having a complete focus.”In his analytical overview of the foregoing stages, [3.170b] the master Bodhibhadra explains in his Essay on Meditative Absorption that calm abid­ing is subsumed under either of two methods: that of (1) directing ones attention outwardly or that of (2) directing it inwardly.(1) The outward directing of ones attention can be of two kinds, special or ordinary; the former involves focusing on either a form of enlightened being or a sacred syllable.(2) The internal directing of ones attention can also be of two kinds, that of (a) focusing on one s body or (b) settling ones mind on something related to the body.(a) There are three ways to focus on the body: as the form of a deity, as a symbolic emblem, or as a skeleton.(b) There are five ways to focus on something related to the body: on the breathing, on some minute characteristic of the body,665 on a sphere of light,666 on rays of light, or on feelings of joy and well-being.667Although other works contain any number of ways to classify what one focuses on, these nevertheless all fall into the two categories of those that involve a physical support and those that do not."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 2.33 Essence of Meditation [c']As for settling in the very essence of meditation, the source verses state:Once the waves of thought dissolve into the ocean that is the basis of all ordinary experience, one strives at meditative equipoise that is the very essence of meditation.Once one has become familiar with the foregoing methods, without bringing to mind any support for ones focus, one settles into a state in which all mental activity associated with object or subject has thoroughly subsided. With this, all the waves of thoughts proliferating and resolving dissolve thoroughly and in their entirety into the “ocean” that is the basis of all ordinary experience.668 This is meditative equipoise that is the very essence of meditation, and so constitutes the consummate state of calm abiding. One should, therefore, strive at that.Identifying Experiences [cc]There are two points to identifying the experiences that develop from the foregoing methods: a brief presentation by way of introduction, and a more extensive explanation of the significance of individual experiences.Introduction [1']The source verses state:There are two ways to identify experiences that develop from these methods.There are two traditions for identifying the meditative experiences diat arise from these processes—that is, of settling with a physical support, set­tling without a support, and setding in the very essence of meditation."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"2-34- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEExtensive Explanation [2‘]The extensive explanation is twofold: according to the tradition of main­stream sources and according to the tradition of personal advice.669Mainstream Sources [a ]The first tradition involves two models: that of relying on eight remedial techniques to eliminate five flaws, and that of accomplishing nine steps in settling the mind (which involve six powers and four ways of focusing). [3.171a]Five Flaws and Eight Remedial Techniques [i']The source verses state:According to mainstream sources, the five flaws are: three kinds of faintheartedness, the forgetting of instructions, two kinds each of laxity and agitation, nonapplication, and overapplication. These are remedied by eight techniques: intention, effort, confidence, and thorough pliancy (which prevent the first flaw); meditative absorption without forgetfulness (endowed with three special features); alert effort, and equanimity (once evenness has ensued).If we consider the way in which calm abiding is explained in the great tradition of mainstream sources, it is said that one relies on eight remedial techniques to eliminate five flaws, which act as impediments that obstruct the development of meditative experiences. According to Distinguishing Center and L im it:Abiding in that state with flexibility ensures that all one s goals are fulfilled.This comes about due to the causes on which it depends— using eight remedial techniques to eliminate five flaws."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION- 2.35Faintheartedness, forgetting instructions, mental laxity and agitation, nonapplication, and overapplication— these are held to be the five flaws.The context, remaining within that, cause, and effect; not forgetting the framework; being alert to laxity or agitation;taking steps to ensure that they are actually eliminated;and entering into a genuine state of repose when calm ensues.670From the foregoing citation, the words abiding in that state mean that, in order to do away with counterproductive influences, one exerts oneself diligently and remains in that state. This leads to meditative absorption that brings physical and mental flexibility.671 This is the basis, or context, for supernormal powers (such as powers of deeper discernment) that bring realization of all one s goals, and so ensure that ones goals are fulfilled. Such a state of meditative absorption develops due to the causes on which it depends— using eight remedial techniques and eliminating fiveflaws.Of these five flaws:(1) Faintheartedness is a flaw when one is trying to apply oneself to medi­tative absorption because it ensures that one does not, in fact, apply oneself. It can be of three kinds: lethargy (which includes sleepiness), obsession with ignoble activities, or diffidence.672(2) Forgetting instructions is a flaw once one is diligently pursuing medi­tative absorption, [3.171b] for ones mind cannot settle in equipoise if one forgets the focus.(3) M ental laxity and agitation are impediments to settling in equipoise since both of these make the mind inflexible. Each of these can be of two kinds. There is obvious laxity, when one loses the sense of holding one s attention to the focus and instead feels a sense of losing consciousness, in which that focus is no longer clear; and there is subtle laxity, when there is still some clarity, but the strength of the mind holding the focus wanes. There is obvious agitation, when the mind is fascinated with sense objects and cannot be reined in with remedies; and there is subtle agitation, when the mind is stirring slightly, without abiding in an unwavering way."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"2.36 - THE t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g e(4) Nonapplication673 is a flaw when either laxity or agitation occurs, for it ensures that neither subsides.(5) Overapplication is a flaw once one is free of laxity or agitation since it means one cannot abide in equanimity.When laxity and agitation are counted as one, there are five flaws; when they are considered separately, there are six, as described in the Stages o f Meditation™One uses eight techniques of elimination as remedies to these flaws:(i)-(4) Four of these techniques—intention, effort, confidence (as the cause), and thorough pliancy (as the result to which that cause leads)—put a stop to the first flaw, faintheartedness.675(5) The remedy for forgetfulness is meditative absorption that ensures one is not forgetting instructions. Such absorption is endowed with three features, in that it involves an intensity, due to the minds being extremely lucid; a nonconceptual quality, due to the minds abidingone-pointedly on its focus; and an experience of well-being that takes the form of a blissful sensation.(6) By ones being alert to whether or not laxity or agitation are taking place, then should either occur, one exerts oneself in any means to dispel the problem—focus, gaze, conduct, and so forth.676(7) Rather than failing to apply remedies for laxity or agitation, one applies them with an attitude of making effort.(8) Once meditative stability ensues faultlessly and one is resting in equi­poise, rather than continuing to make effort in application, one trains in equanimity, no longer applying any remedy.Six Powers, Four Ways of Focusing, and Nine Steps in Settling [if]The source verses state:Through six powers—listening, contemplation, mindfulness, alertness, diligence, and familiarization— [3.172a] involving situations of tension, interruption, no interruption, and spontaneity,nine steps of settling the mind (settling on a focus and so forth) develop."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION- 2.37One relies on six powers that promote one s growth: these are the powers of listening to teachings, contemplation, mindfulness, alertness, diligence, and familiarization. The first power ensures the first step in settling the mind; the second power, the second step; the third power, the third and fourth steps; the fourth power, the fifth and sixth steps; the fifth power, the seventh and eighth steps; and the sixth power, the ninth step.These steps involve four attendant attitudes: those of involvement with tension, involvement with interruption, involvement without interrup­tion, and spontaneous involvement. During the first two steps of setding the mind, one is involved with the first situation; during the third through the seventh steps of settling, with the second situation; during the eighth step of setding, with the third situation; and during the ninth step of set­tling, with the fourth situation. These steps are therefore said to “involve situations with four attendant attitudes.”The nine steps of setding the mind that develop through these powers and attitudes are those of settling, settling continually, and so forth. Of these nine steps:(1) settling the mind involves drawing ones mind in from any external focus and directing it toward some inner focus;(2) settling continually involves the mind that was thus directed initially continuing to setde on its focus without becoming distracted by anything else;(3) setding repeatedly involves ones being aware if the mind becomes distracted outwardly and causing it to settle once more on its focus;(4) setding more intimately involves settling in a more subtle way, ensur­ing that the mind is drawn naturally from a broader scope to a more con­centrated one;(3) guiding the mind involves a feeling of inspiration when one reflects on the positive qualities of meditative absorption; [3.172b](6) pacifying the mind involves ones seeing distraction to be a fault, so as to pacify any resistance one still has to developing meditative absorption;(7) pacifying it thoroughly involves pacifying feelings such as desirous attitudes or unhappiness;(8) setding the mind one-pointedly involves striving in order to be able to setde effortlessly; and(9) settling in equipoise, once the mind has achieved evenness, involves ones allowing that to occur with equanimity; thus, the final of the nine steps in setding the mind is awakened."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"23B - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThe nine steps of settling the mind are discussed in the Ornament o f the Mahdyana Sutras611 while the six powers and the four attendant attitudes are explained in the Levels o f the $ravaka.mPersonal Advice [b']As for an explanation according to the tradition of personal advice, the source verses state:In the tradition of personal advice, understanding is gained through illustrative analogies of five experiences— movement, attainment, familiarization, stability, and consummation.In the tradition of those who employ personal advice, the process by which calm abiding develops is subsumed within five stages of meditative experience:(1) the first stage is the experience of mind in movement, comparable to water cascading down a rock face;(2) the second stage is the experience of attainment^ comparable to a tor­rent in a deep ravine;(3) the third stage is the experience offamiliarization, comparable to a meandering river;(4) the fourth stage is the experience of stability, comparable to an ocean free of waves; and(5) the fifth stage is the experience of consummation, with the mind abid­ing in a state of limpid clarity in which no circumstance whatsoever can cause it to stir; this is comparable to the flame of a lamp unstirred by any breeze.One should understand that each of the analogies is an attempt to illus­trate the actual experience taking place.Measuring Success [iv]An explanation of the measure of success gained through meditation, and related topics, is twofold: the way to attain calm abiding and the attendant states of mental focus, and an explanation of the purpose of such attainment."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION- 2.39Attaining Calm Abiding [aa]The source verses state:With the consummation of thorough pliancy, calm abiding is ensured—the space within which well-being, clarity, and the absence of any concepts about subtle traits blend.That is to say, even though one may have achieved the four attendant attitudes and the nine steps of setding the mind, if one has not gained a thorough pliancy of mind and body, one has not yet reached the consum­mate state of calm abiding. According to the Commentary on Enlightened Intent: [3.173a]“O transcendent and accomplished conqueror! As long as a bodhisattva’s mind is such that the attention is directed inward­ly but thorough pliancy of body and thorough pliancy of mind have not been attained, what does such attention constitute?”“O Maitreya! This is not calm abiding. Rather, one should describe this as a case of someone who has an approximation of, and a dedicated interest that is entirely in accord with, calm abiding.”679And in the Ornament [ofthe Mahay ana Sutras] we read the following:Once fajniliar with that, they no longer use application.This then brings about a consummate degree of thorough pliancy of body and mind, which is termed “involving deliberation.”680In this context, the phrase “involving deliberation” refers to calm abiding.681In brief, calm abiding is explained as being the thorough pliancy that involves flexibility of body and mind. Before it is attained, any state of meditative absorption still falls within the realm of desire; this is not yet"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"2.4°- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEactual calm abiding, and so is referred to as “the one-pointed mind of the realm of desire.”As for thorough pliancy, the Compendium ofAbhidharma states:“What is thorough pliancy?” one might ask. It is flexibility of body and mind, because the continuity of the physical and men­tal tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states of existence has been interrupted; its function is that of removing all obscurations.682The physical and mental tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states of existence are such that one is incapable of engaging at will in positive actions, whether physical or mental. Their remedy lies in a thorough pliancy of body and mind, for due to being free of both kinds of such tendencies, one s body and mind are extremely flexible in engaging in positive actions. There is flexibility of body, for once one has made effort to eliminate the afflictive states that reinforce physical tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states (and interfere with the process of eliminating those tendencies), one is free of bodily inflexibility (such as physical sensations of heaviness) and instead feels one s body to be buoyant and light, like a ball of cotton. There is flexibility of mind, for once one has made effort to eliminate the afflictive states that reinforce mental tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states, one is free of mental inflexibility (in which the mind is incapable of engaging wholeheartedly within any positive framework) and can engage without any impediment. [3.173b]According to the Levels o f the $rdvaka,m of these two kinds of flexibility, the thorough pliancy of mental flexibility develops first, and due to its influ­ence, a subtle energy (that causes thorough pliancy of body to develop) stirs and becomes pervasive throughout the body, so that one is freed of physi­cal tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states, resulting in the development of thorough pliancy of body (This thorough pliancy of body is not just a mental state; there is a remarkable and extremely pleasant physical sensa­tion throughout one s body.)As for the way in which these states develop, at first thorough pliancy is subde and hard to detect; then it becomes more obvious and easily rec­ognized; then it develops to a great degree, with a powerful sense of well­being and joy overtaking one s body and mind. According to the Levels o f the Srdvaka.,684 once this has developed, one meditates by adopting an atti­tude of equanimity toward the joy that could otherwise make ones mind"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"too excited. At a certain point, due to the influence of a thorough pliancy that ensues, as light as a shadow, one gains calm abiding,685 As for the mea­sure of success in the calm abiding that comes with the consummation of this thorough pliancy, without any obstacle due to distraction, outwardly or inwardly, one s mind rests inherently on its focus in a stable way, abiding limpidly since it is free of laxity or agitation.Thus, the attainment of the aforementioned attendant attitudes ensures that one attains four factors to some small degree: (i) a mind state included within the realm of form,686 (2) thorough pliancy of body, (3) thorough pli­ancy of mind, and (4) one-pointed focus. With these come calm abiding on a more obvious level (or what could be termed the spiritual path that embodies the aspects of the Truths687), which has the capacity to refine away afflictive states. If one then turns inward, resting in equipoise, thorough pli­ancy of body and mind develop very swiftly; the five obscurations (such as fascination with objects of desire or sleepiness)688 do not, for the most part, occur; and even when one arises from a formal state of meditative equipoise, one is, at least from time to time, endowed with a thorough pliancy of body and mind. This explanation, found in the Levels o f the Srdvaka,m concerns the indications that one is imbued with this state of mental engagement.690It is also explained that there is the sense of well-being that comes from thorough physical and mental pliancy. This pliancy also leads to exceptional meditative experiences of clarity, such as being able to perceive things on the atomic level, and to an absence of conceptual thinking about any of the ten kinds of characteristics that one might perceive in things (that is, the five kinds of sense objects (visual forms and so forth), the three times, and male and female genders), [3.174a] so that one has an experience as though one were blending with space. This experience is such that during formal meditative equipoise one has no perception of having a body, while one’s mind blends with space; in postmeditation, one has experiences such as the impression that one’s body suddenly reappears.Purpose [bb]The source verses state:This is the basis of all meditative stability in the traditions of sutra and tantra.It suppresses all afflictive states and suffering.FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 241"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"242 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThe consummate state of calm abiding that comes with the attainment of thorough pliancy is the basis that gives rise to, or supports, all the states of meditative stability discussed in the sutras and tantras, whether these states involve conceptual frameworks or not. It is like a fertile field for someone who wishes to grow crops. This state of meditative absorption alone is itself capable of suppressing and pacifying all the overt manifestations of afflic­tive states and suffering. And that is not all, for the realization of the authen­tic state of suchness (that is, the lack of identity in things), just as it is, must depend entirely on one s resting in equipoise. As the first version of Stages o f Meditation states:A mind that is not resting in equipoise cannot know what is authentic, just as it is. The transcendent and accomplished con­queror proclaimed, moreover, “It is through resting in equipoise that one knows what is authentic, just as it is.”691Training in Profound Insight [b]The second explanation, how one trains in profound insight, is fivefold: reliance on the circumstances that are supportive of profound insight; an analysis of the specific expressions of profound insight; an analysis of the essential experiences of profound insight; the way in which it is cultivated in meditation; and the measure of attainment.Supportive Circumstances [i]The source verses state:The causal circumstances for profound insight are to rely on holy masters,to hear many teachings, to think correctly, and so to seek the view.In this regard, the intermediate version of Stages o f Meditation states:“What are the circumstances that support profound insight?” one might ask. They are: to rely on holy masters, to seek any and every way to study the teachings in depth, and to think correctly.692"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION- 2.43That is to say, one relies on learned people who have fathomed the mean­ing of the scriptures [3.174b] and listens to their teachings on the flawless mainstream traditions. Through the sublime intelligence that comes from listening to and contemplating these teachings, one develops the view that constitutes the realization of the very nature of things. These are the indis­pensable causal circumstances that are supportive of profound insight, for it is impossible for the realization that constitutes that profound insight to awaken without one s having the completely authentic view.With respect to such a view, one must seek to develop this by relying on the definitive meaning of the teachings rather than the provisional mean­ing. And so, having understood the distinction between the definitive and provisional meanings,693 one must master the profound meaning of the scriptures that deal with that definitive meaning, which, in the present con­text, is to say that one should discover the view that constitutes the realiza­tion of the profundity of emptiness by relying on the extensive traditions established by the two guides.694Analysis of Profound Insight [ii]As for a more detailed analysis, the source verses state:Its specific expressions are said to be tne more obvious state of quiescence also found in non-Buddhist traditions, the topics that pertain to the Truths (in the sravaka and pratyekabuddha approaches), the view of emptiness (in the paramita approach), and the influence of bliss (in the tan trie approach).The ordinary preparatory phases parallel those of the mundane path;however, these are not pursued by those in the tantric approach and others.In this regard, if one considers profound insight from the point of view of its expressions from lower to higher levels of spiritual development, the following expressions are spoken of:(1) The expression of insight as a more obvious state of calm abiding— which is found in common with non-Buddhist systems—is the more mundane level of insight that eliminates overt manifestations of afflictive mental states."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"(2) In the sravaka and pratyekabuddha approaches, the expression of profound insight is the view that focuses on impermanence and the rest of the sixteen topics pertaining to the Four Truths.(3) In the Mahayana approach of the transcendent perfections, it is the view that focuses on emptiness.(4) In the systems of the tan trie approach, that same view is imbued with a blissful quality.The three latter expressions constitute profound insight that transcends the mundane sphere, in that it completely eliminates even the underlying potential for afflictive states.The way in which the main states of meditative stability are accomplished through the seven preparatory phases that are expressions of calm abiding695 is, in fact, the one that was explained in the section on the mundane path.696 However, those who are following the tantric path—and the words “or others” refer to those with the exceptional view of the paramita approach— are not motivated to practice deliberately to achieve these phases.Essential Experiences [iii]As for an analysis of the essential experiences involved, the source verses state: [3.173a]An analysis may involve three categories: analytical insight, thoroughly analytical insight, and insight as the avenue for four essential experiences of examination and investigation.Insight can derive from the ordinary distinctions one makes, from a thoroughgoing search, and from discernment.It can involve six explorations—of meaning, things, characteristics, influences, time, and logical principles.(There are four logical principles that concern dependentrelationships, performance of function, establishment of what is reasonable,and the nature of things.) These six are used to analyze things in detail, from visual forms to omniscience.At this point, my discussion will not place emphasis on the profound states of insight that pertain to the advanced paths and levels;697 rather, I144 - THE treasury of know ledge"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"shall emphasize the profound insight that is cultivated in meditation while one is an ordinary mortal individual. An explanation of such an analysis involves three categories:(1) In the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent,698 two aspects are those of analytical insight and thoroughly analytical insight. Each of these two is further divisible into two modes, those of thoroughgoing examina­tion and thoroughgoing investigation, making for the third category, that of what is known as “profound insight involving four essential experiences.”Of these, analytical insight focuses on things in all their multiplicity, pre­cisely analyzing the mind-body aggregates, sense fields, and components of perception. Thoroughly analytical insight focuses on reality just as it is,699 leading to realization of the lack of identity in the individual and the lack of identity in phenomena. The two modes of examination and investigation involve mentally analyzing things in a more obvious and more subtle way, respectively.As for the way in which these aspects of profound insight are realized, the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states:with thorough examination, certain examination, thorough evaluation, and intimate evaluation.700If we apply the same detailed divisions to investigation, we arrive at a total of sixteen degrees of insight.701 A precise classification of these can be found in the Levels o f the Sravaka.A similar treatment is found in the Compendium o f Abhidharma:“What is profound insight?” one might ask. It is the analysis, the thorough analysis, the thoroughgoing examination, and the thoroughgoing investigation of phenomena, because it is the remedy for tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states of existence and the ordinary distinctions one makes, keeps one away from what is erroneous, and allows one s mind to settle in what is with­out error.702 [3.175b](2) As for profound insight through three avenues of engagement, we read in the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent'.“O transcendent and accomplished conqueror! How many ex­pressions of profound insight are there?”FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 245"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"246 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE“O Maitreya, there are three: that which derives from the or­dinary distinctions one makes, that which derives from a thor­oughgoing search, and that which derives from discernment.”703If we define these three expressions of profound insight with reference to meditation on the absence of identity, for example, the first expression involves focusing on the identification of this absence of identity, so that the ordinary distinctions entailed are called to mind; but it does not involve much attention to come to a definitive conclusion. The second expression involves coming to such a conclusion, in order to gain certainty about what was hitherto uncertain. The third expression involves the same kind of investigation as used before but concerning the significance of what has already been ascertained.(3) As for “profound insight that involves six explorations,” this derives from a thoroughgoing search of six factors—meanings, things, characteris­tics, influences, time, and logical principles—and from the discernment one gains through having examined them. Of these factors:(a) the exploration of meaning here refers to the inquiry “The meaning of such-and-such a word is such-and-such”;(b) the exploration of things refers to such inquiries as “This thing is something internal, while that thing is something external”;(c) the exploration of characteristics has two aspects, what is more com­mon and what is more particular, as in the inquiry “These are the character­istic specific to something, while these are its more general characteristics”;(d) the exploration of influences involves the examination of negative factors (from the point of view of their flaws and drawbacks) and positive ones (from the point of view of their qualities and benefits); and(e) the exploration of time involves the inquiry “Such-and-such hap­pened in the past, such-and-such will happen in the future, such-and-such is the case at present.”(f) The exploration of logical principles entails four such lines. Of these:(i) The logical principle of dependence focuses on results coming about in dependence on their causes and conditions. It also involves investigations of what is relative or ultimate, and the respective bases for these contexts. [3.176a](ii) The logical principle of function focuses on the functions that are specific to phenomena, such as the function of fires being that of burning. It involves such explorations as “This is a given phenomenon; this is a func­tion; this phenomenon performs this function.”"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION- 2.47(iii) The logical principle that establishes what is reasonable involves the proof of a point without contradicting the process of valid cognition. It involves investigation by considering, “Does this point in question con­form to any of the three kinds of valid cognition, whether direct experience, correct inference, or reliable scriptural authority?”'04(iv) The logical principle of the nature of things involves investigating things by concentrating on their nature s being what is commonly accepted in the world (such as fires being hot and waters being wet), on the incon­ceivable nature of reality, and on the true and abiding nature of things,705 without considering extraneous issues.706One can apply these six methods of exploration to any given phenom­enon within the deeply ingrained afflictive state and the totally refined state—from forms up to and including the state of omniscience—to ana­lyze them in detail and gain realization thereby.The source verses state:These can be understood in three ways: meaning, reality just as it is, and things in all their multiplicity.The preparation and the main practice are subsumed, respectively, within discernment and an unwavering state.While these examinations can be classified as sixfold, for an advanced spiritual practitioner, there are three topics to be understood: the meaning of what is uttered, reality just as it is, and things in all their multiplicity.In categorizing these topics, from the point of view of the first topic, the method of exploration is of the first kind.707 From the point of view of the second topic, the methods of exploration are of things and characteristics (both general and specific). From the point of view of the third topic, the methods of exploration are of the latter three kinds,708 plus that of general characteristics.The avenues to the four kinds of profound insight discussed earlier709 are threefold,710 while the methods of exploration are explained as being the foregoing six. Thus, the three avenues and six methods of exploration are subsumed within the foregoing four kinds of profound insight.Alternatively, profound insight can be considered as twofold, divided into a preparatory phase and the actual state. So profound insight can be subsumed under two categories: profound insight as a discerning function of thought (in the context of the preparatory phase) and profound insight as a completely unwavering state (in the context of the actual state). [3.176b]"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"248 - THE t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g eCultivating Profound Insight [iv]As for the way in which profound insight is cultivated in meditation, the source verses state:As for the way insight is cultivated in meditation, having used sublime intelligence to investigate the fact that things lack identity, one rests in equipoise in a state free of conceptual elaborations.The bases for the investigation—the nonconceptual images— are focused on as bases of attributes, while any false assumptions concerning their specific attributes are eliminated.If one has not discovered the view of things lacking identity, one will stray from the ultimate point of suchness itself, regardless of which method of meditation one employs; so one must discover that view. However, even with an understanding of that view, if one does not meditate by resting one s mind on the basis of that understanding, one will not cultivate the experi­ence of suchness. Therefore, having used sublime intelligence to investigate the fact that things lack identity, one rests in equipoise in basic space, free of all conceptual elaborations.With respect to this point, if one engages a great deal in analytical medita­tion and the abiding aspect of one s meditation diminishes, one can engage more in resting meditation and nurture that abiding aspect. If one engages in a great deal of resting meditation and becomes disinclined to engage in analytical meditation, one should engage in the latter. For it is explained that it is more powerful for one to meditate by balancing calm abiding and profound insight in equal measure.In this regard, the usual model common to most systems of Buddhist thought711 is that once one has completed an investigation of the topic of meditation using discerning intelligence, one rests in equipoise in this free­dom from conceptual elaboration. The model of the Gedenpa school,712 however, is that when maintaining the main practice of meditative equi­poise, one should continue to clarify, further and further, the way in which one s mind deliberately apprehends.70As for the actual cultivation of profound insight in meditation, if one has begun by cultivating calm abiding, the many forms that are perceived within the scope of ones meditative absorption—whether or not these"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"accord with external circumstances—are termed “nonconceptual images.” If one then cultivates profound insight in meditation, one meditates by- using those reflections (which arise on the strength of one s calm abiding) as the bases for examination by one s discernment. But the mind is entirely directed inwardly; there is no examination that actually focuses on exter­nals in a deliberate way.714When one investigates those images, which constitute the scope of one s meditative absorption, initially one must use the discernment of one s sub­lime intelligence [3.177a] to focus on the individual phenomena under investigation, because one cannot eliminate any false assumptions concern­ing the specific attributes of things until one has ascertained the bases of these attributes. Therefore, one first clearly brings to mind a given object about which one s false assumptions must be eliminated. Then one uses the authentic discerning function of one s sublime intelligence to examine it, coming to the definitive conclusion that it is apparent yet has no indepen­dent nature. One then focuses without wavering on that as the object of one’s meditative absorption, and so realizes that the object upon which one is completely focused is apparent yet has no independent nature.715 Medita­tive absorption and sublime intelligence are thus integrated with an iden­tical focus. This is what is meant when the Compendium o f Abhidharma states:involving the congruency of meditative absorption and sublime intelligence.. ,716The source verses state:The nature of what is perceived is known to be empty, like space; what is to be examined—the origin, location, shape, and so forth, of the perceiving consciousness— and the discerning function itself are like fire sticks consumed by fire.Nothing is found, for things dissolve into basic space, and one rests without any fixated perception.Suppose that, while resting in equipoise vis-a-vis visual forms and so forth, one uses the discerning function of one s sublime intelligence to real­ize that the nature of those forms and so forth is empty; this is not due toFOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 249"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"250- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEone s calling to mind such things as the ordinary characteristics of those forms. By initially familiarizing oneself with this, one becomes aware that the nature of what is merely perceived is emptiness, comparable to the realm of space, without any fixed frame of reference. This is to immerse oneself in the genuine state in which there is no conceptual framework of perceived objects; one meditates on what is external as the inseparability of appear­ance and emptiness.When one experiences the onset of a given state of one s inner perceiving consciousness—such as aversion—in one s ongoing experience, one exam­ines this with the discerning function of one s sublime intelligence, trying to determine what cause it could have come from in the first place; what location (whether internal or external) it could reside in for the duration; and what shape, color, and so forth, it might have in its essence. One should rest in equipoise, experiencing the significance of finding nothing whatso­ever through such examination. This method is applied upon the onset of any of the six primary afflictive states.717 And that is not all, [3.177b] for in becoming aware of any thoughts that occur, including neutral ones and so forth,718 one applies this method accordingly. This is to immerse oneself in the genuine state in which there is no conceptual framework of a perceiv­ing consciousness; one meditates on what is internal as the inseparability of awareness and emptiness.Finally, the objects to be examined and even discerning sublime intelli­gence itself dissolve into basic space so that nothing can be found any longer (analogous to a fire sticks being consumed by the fire it produces), and one should rest in that state without any subjective perception. The foregoing points are presented in distilled form in Pith Instructions on the Middle Way by the Noble Lord, which states:In this way, the mind of the past has ceased and so dispensed with; the mind of the future has not yet developed or occurred; the mind of the present moment is likewise extremely difficult to examine.719 Since there is a similarity to space, with no color and an absence of any shape, if one uses the weapon of reasoning in investigating and analyzing mind—whether from the perspec­tive that it cannot be found to exist, or that it is free of being one thing or many, or that it is unborn, or that it is utterly lucid by nature, and so forth—you will realize that it cannot be estab­lished to exist."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION- 2.51Thus, given that mind cannot be found to exist in essence as some “thing” of either of two kinds720 and so simply does not exist as such, even discerning sublime intelligence itself21 cannot be established to exist as such. To give an analogy, the fire that results from two sticks’ being rubbed together consumes them both, and in the wake of them vanishing, even the fire that con­sumed them dies out in and of itself. Similarly, once it has simply been established that all phenomena (with both shared and spe­cific characteristics) do not exist as such, even that sublime intel­ligence itself is not something manifest, but rather is an utter lucidity, free of all conceptual elaborations,722 not something that can be found to exist as anything at all in essence. And so every­thing that could constitute a circumstance723 of mental dullness, agitation, and the like has been eliminated.Under those circumstances, there is no thinking about any­thing at all, no fixation on anything at all; for all deliberate recol­lection and formulation of thought has been eliminated. One s consciousness should rest724 for as long as enemies and thieves— that is, ordinary distinctions and thoughts725—do not arise.726Measure of Attainment [v]As for the measure of ones attainment of profound insight, [3.178a] the source verses state:The gaining of thorough pliancy is explained as being the point at which there is attainment.When one meditates using the discerning function of one s sublime intelligence to investigate things individually, as long as thorough pliancy has not been attained, one has a valid approximation of profound insight, but with the onset of that pliancy, ones insight is completely authentic. The essence of thorough pliancy and the way in which it comes about were explained in the context of calm abiding.

Nevertheless, they agree that what is to be devel­oped is the integration of that abiding and insight.In this regard, the master Bhavaviveka gives the following explanation: Having fostered calm abiding by focusing on unattractiveness, loving­kindness, and so forth, one follows this by developing profound insight through the influence of precise investigation using reasoning/29 The mas­ter ^antideva explains that, having first fostered calm abiding by cultivat­ing bodhicitta, one follows this by developing the sublime intelligence of profound insight by focusing on emptiness.730 In the intermediate version of Stages o f Meditation, the master Kamalaslla states that one first develops calm abiding by focusing on an image of the Sage,731 for example, and then gains profound insight through a precise investigation of the nature of that same focus.732 [3.178b] According to the master Candra,733 calm abiding and profound insight are accomplished on the basis of the view that derives from investigating suchness itself."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Given that all these interpretations, moreover, are completely accurate and constitute unerring paths, they all agree in holding that one meditates in a methodical and developmental way, given the cause-and-effect relation­ship that involves three steps: calm abiding, profound insight, and dieir integration. And for all these masters, what is paramount is the unwavering quality of one-pointed attention.Integration [ii]The source verses state:When one is meditating with a construct, integration involves a precise analysis of the image on which one is focusing.Once one gains profound nonconceptual insight, there is integration when these have become identical in essence.“Well,” one might wonder, “at what point do calm abiding and profound insight become integrated?” When one is cultivating that abiding and that insight by meditating with some construct,734 both the calm abiding (the nonconceptual mind focused on the image) and the profound insight (the realization that analyzes phenomena precisely) are equally engaged as a matter of course—that is, they are in actual fact integrated. In this present discussion, though, when one gains both calm abiding that is completely nonconceptual and profound insight that is also completely nonconcep­tual, these two abide identical in essence, and so there is truly what is termed “integration.”735 As the first version of Stages o f Meditation states:At whatever point one is focused on the absence of any finite es­sence in all phenomena, such that one s consciousness is engaged yet free of mental dullness, agitation, and the like, and without the overt application of any remedy, at that point one has com­pleted the path that brings about the integration of calm abiding and profound insight.736FOUNDATIONS OF MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION - 253Result of Integration [iii] The source verses state:"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"2.54 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThat is the consummation of authentic meditative absorption— the attainment of nirvana that is not confined, but free of the bonds of conditioned existence and the state of peace.Such meditative absorption, which integrates calm abiding and pro­found insight, is truly authentic meditative absorption.

In the Vajrayàna approach, there are many means available to one: the pith instructions on consolidation (isolating, and thus eliminat­ing, the perceptions of specific sense objects), die empty framework744 of the subtle channels, the advanced practices for harnessing the subtle energies, the melting bliss745 of bindu, the visualization of deities, or the repetition of mantras. Or one can rest in the natural state of relaxation—the uncontrived and unfettered state of genuine being.

These are means to arousethe superb discerning function of ones sublime intelligence, accommodating the acumen of individuals.According to the principles of valid cognition,746 for example, one may investigate such issues as what serves as a basis for certain characteristics, what is characterized, and what serves to characterize it. In the abhidharma teachings, one may thoroughly investigate the general and specific char­acteristics of phenomena. One may gain understanding of the process of interdependent connection, both the usual progression and its reversal.747 One may eliminate wishful thinking through use of the five major logical proofs, focusing on causes, results, both, things in their essence, and inter­dependent connection.748 Or one may be introduced directly to one s own true nature, beholding it in all its nakedness, due to many means involving scriptural citations, logical reasoning, the transmission of blessing, or the use of symbols. Ail such approaches are a developmental spectrum of means to arouse the superb discerning function of ones sublime intelligence, in accord with the acumen of individuals. Given that any of these means will develop calm abiding and profound insight, any in itself will ensure that the goal is realized; there is no need for a single individual to employ all these methods.Investigative and Settling Meditation [b]As for the means by which calm abiding and profound insight are accom­plished through investigative and setding meditation, the source verses state:Investigative and settling meditation are both alike in accomplishing calm abiding and profound insight.As discussed previously, calm abiding and profound insight are accom­plished by alternating the two modes of investigative meditation and settling meditation. Since either mode, if carried through to its consumma­tion, will ensure both aspects of meditative absorption, in the final analysis, investigative and settling meditation are alike."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Auxiliary Explanation [c]As for an auxiliary explanation of the three situations involved in medita­tive stability, the source verses state:Initially, with the meditative stability of an inexperienced practitioner,one experiences indications such as smoke.

One engages in meditation through the following:(i) the underlying basis, which is the observance of discipline and devel­opment of the three kinds of sublime intelligence;751(2.) the circumstance that promotes meditation, which is the fact that one is capable of both physical and mental isolation;752(3) the eschewing of counterproductive circumstances, that is, the eight mundane concerns;753(4) the supportive circumstances, that is, the twelve disciplines one maintains in one s spiritual training; and(5) the circumstance of a pure lifestyle, that is, the complete abandon­ment of the five kinds of wrong lifestyle.(1) As to the first of these preliminaries, one observes any of the seven kinds of ordination for individual liberation,754 [3.180b] thus avoiding all manner of harmful actions of body, speech, and mind. Following that, one hears teachings by listening to scriptures that accord with the actual real­ization of what is true. One uses reasoning to thoroughly investigate the meaning of what one has heard, developing the sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation (which is to say, the correct functioning of the thinking process). In this way, one proceeds to apply oneself to meditation"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - l6lby focusing one s attention one-pointediy on the meaning of what one has contemplated.One might wonder, “What is sublime intelligence that derives from hear­ing teachings, contemplating, and meditating?” The Particularist school holds that the sublime intelligence that derives from hearing teachings has only the words as its objects; that which derives from contemplation has both the words and their meaning as its objects; and that which derives from meditation has only the meaning as its object. But Vasubandhu points out that a single state of sublime intelligence cannot focus on both the words and the meaning at once; thus, while that which derives from hearing teachings constitutes the aspect of sublime intelligence that focuses on the words and that which derives from meditation constitutes the aspect that focuses on the meaning, it is impossible for there to be sublime intelligence deriving from contemplation that focuses on both the words and the mean­ing at the same time.755Therefore, it is logical that hearing teachings involves listening to author­itative and reliable scriptural sources; sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation constitutes that which comes from using reasoning to arrive at a definitive conclusion concerning the meaning of what one has heard; and sublime intelligence that derives from meditation constitutes that which comes from meditating one-pointedly on the meaning of what one has contemplated. Therefore, these are aspects of sublime intelligence that involve, respectively, gaining certainty concerning the meaning on the basis simply of the language employed; gaining this on the basis of lines of rea­soning; and gaining this certainty concerning the meaning on the strength of meditation, without relying on language or concepts.(2) One might wonder, “What is the working basis on which these aspects of sublime intelligence that derive from hearing teachings, contem­plating, and meditating can be developed?” In order for these aspects of a deep immersion in spiritual practice to develop, people, whether they are lay or monastic practitioners, must physically distance themselves from the busyness of societal ties and mentally distance themselves from inappro­priate trains of thought and other distractions. But for those who are not content with monastic robes and the simple fare obtained through begging, [3.181a] and who are very covetous, desiring fine things and many posses­sions, these aspects of deep immersion in the spiritual path—deriving from hearing teachings, contemplating, and meditating—will not develop.(3) Given that the path of a spiritually advanced being will not develop"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"161 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEfor someone who is caught up in the eight mundane concerns, one should eschew these concerns in order to promote access to that path.

The five are lifestyles that involve the following:(a) ingratiation (that is, speaking sweetly to others in order later to receive gain and honors);(b) flattery (that is, praising something owned by another because one wishes to obtain it);(c) self-promotion (that is, speaking of one s qualities in order to advance ones own interests);(d) profiteering (that is, using one s gain to seek further gain by boasting about one s previous gains or giving a little to receive a lot in return); and(e) hypocrisy (that is, pretending to control one s senses and be restrained in order to receive gain and honors).In addition, engaging in agriculture, trading, or the selling of religious articles and texts are wrong kinds of lifestyle that incur a heavy burden.758 Thus, if one pursues them, the manifest states of realization associated with the spiritual path that have not arisen in one will not arise, while those that may have arisen will swiftly fade. So avoid these lifestyles completely and adopt a lifestyle that is completely pure.Actual Process of Meditation [II]A discussion of the actual process of meditation is twofold: the stages of meditation in the Hlnayana approaches of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, and the stages of meditation in the Mahayana approach of the transcendent perfections."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"2^4 - t h e t r e a s u r y o f k n o w l e d g eHinayana Approaches [A]This discussion is also twofold: the stages of meditation in the sravaka approach and the stages of meditation in the pratyekabuddha approach.Sravaka Approach [ 1 ]This discussion involves two topics—a brief discussion continuing from the preceding remarks and an extensive explanation of the significance of these stages.Brief Discussion [a]The source verses state:... then, the process of meditationconsists of seven stages for those who follow the Sravaka schools.These are subsumed within five points—focus, content, essence, result, and context.The first of the successive discussions of the process of meditation in the more common and extraordinary approaches [3.182a] concerns those who follow the sravaka schools. They meditate on the first four paths759 in seven stages. According to the Treasury ofAbhidharma:The seven stages, in order, are thoroughly analyzed as follows: those of beginning practitioners,those of the phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough, that of meditation, and that of seeing.760That is to say: on the path of accumulation, (1) in the initial phase, one cultivates the four applications of mindfulness; (2) in the intermediate phase, one cultivates the four aspects of authentic renunciation; (3) and in the final phase, one cultivates the four bases of supernormal powers.

In this regard, as the gen­eral remedy for desire, they meditate on their own and others’ bodies—and, in fact, all sensory appearances—as being skeletons, and thus neutralize their desire. As the Treasury o f Abhidharma states:skeletons in all situations that involve attachment.763"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"2 66- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEAs specific remedies, they meditate on eight mental images, such as a decomposing corpse, a swollen corpse, a maggot-ridden corpse, and so forth.764 [3.182b] Once they are free of desire, from time to time they use the application of mindfulness that scrutinizes the body to meditate on their bodies as being, for example, like hollow reeds.They next meditate on the idea that regards sensations—whether plea­surable, painful, or neutral—as being productive of suffering, and the idea that these are like hollow reeds, without any real substance.Then these practitioners calm their thought processes by focusing their attention on the coming and going of the breath; and while the usual flow of thoughts in the mind constitutes the relative level of truth, when they examine this, the ultimate level of truth lies, for these srávaka practitioners, in indivisible moments of consciousness,765 and so within that context they meditate on the fact that nothing has identity.Next, they meditate on everything subsumed within the categories of mental states and aspects of consciousness—everything that seems to embody something either internally or externally—to determine that the nature of all of these is such that they have no true identity, are imperma­nent, are like illusions, and forth.“Why,” one might ask, “do they take these topics as their focus?” It is in order to undermine the following concepts in the minds of those whose thinking is erroneous: that the body is the actual abode of the personal self; that sensations are the basis for the self’s experiences; that the mind is the actual self; and that phenomena are the basis for the self’s experience of either deeply ingrained afflictive states of mind or the totally refined state of enlightenment.In this regard, there are three aspects to what constitutes one’s “body”: the inner aspect, the outer aspect, and the aspect that partakes of both. The first aspect consists of the eyes and other corporeal sense organs that are the internal components of one’s perceptual field. The second aspect consists of visual forms and other tangible sense objects that are the external com­ponents of one’s perceptual field. The third aspect consists of the bases for one’s own sense organs and the corporeal sense organs of others, for causes and perceptual fields interact in a way that effects change in both.Each of the remaining three topics766 also has three aspects; one can understand these through consideration of the bases and the scopes of focus that apply in their respective cases.The term “phenomena” here includes all mental events other than sen­"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - 2.67sations, as well as distinct formative factors767 and forms that fall within the sense field of one s subjective consciousness,768 as well as unconditioned phenomena.769 [3.183a]The source verses state:They employ the applications of mindfulness, using sublime intelligence to examine the fourfold characteristics that are specific and general.They engage the Four Truths, cultivating the initial phase of the path of accumulation.This model serves for the remaining stages.(B) As to the content of their meditation, they focus on the specific char­acteristics of the body and the other topics (what any given thing essentially is, of what elements it is composed, what derives from these elements, and so forth) and the general characteristics of things (that they are imperma­nent, productive of suffering, empty, without true identity, and so forth). Alternatively, they focus on four topics: that the body is unclean, that sensa­tions produce suffering, that the mind is impermanent, and that phenom­ena have no true identity.(C) In its essence this meditation brings an understanding due to ones sublime intelligence (which discerns both the general and specific charac­teristics of the body and the other topics) and ones mindfulness (which ensures one does not forget the scope on which one is focusing or the content). The term “application of mindfulness” is used because one thus considers the general and specific characteristics with sublime intelligence, while mindfulness keeps ones mind directed again and again toward its focus.(D) The result (or alternatively, the purpose) of this meditation is that of causing one to come to terms with the Four Truths. The first topic770 causes one to come to terms with the truth of suffering because through precise analysis one gains a thorough appreciation of the body as a subliminal state of suffering that perpetuates ignoble states of existence. The second topic771 causes one to come to terms with the truth of the all-pervasive origin of suffering because orte realizes that the primary factor in this all-pervasive origin—compulsion7'2—is the cause and condition for the three kinds of sensations (pleasurable and so forth), and so one wishes to eliminate that factor.

The fourth topic774 causes one to come to terms with the truth of the spiritual path [3.183b] because one determines that afflictive states (such as attachment) are factors to be eliminated, while aspects of the totally refined state of enlightenment (such as faith) are factors to be relied upon, and so one wishes to follow the path.

To these ends, one arouses one s intention, brings exertion to bear, focuses ones attention intently, and immerses oneself thoroughly in the process.(C) These aspects, in their essence, constitute the diligence that ensures that factors to be eliminated decline, while the remedies to these factors gain in strength.(D) The purpose, or result, of these aspects is that all factors to be elimi­nated decline without exception, and one avails oneself of all the remedies without exception.(E) As for the context demarcating this process, one cultivates these aspects of authentic renunciation during the intermediate phase of the path of accumulation. This is due to the fact that, having meditated by relying in the appropriate manner on the topics for the application of mindfulness, [3.184a] one sees the flaw of those factors that are to be eliminated and the advantages of their remedies, and so arouses the diligence to begin making choices, rejecting the former and embracing the latter.One might wonder why the term “aspect of authentic renunciation” is employed. It is because it signifies that these aspects eliminate all that is spiritually counterproductive.Once these aspects are in place:(A) The scope o f one's focus in cultivating the four bases of supernormal powers includes creating emanations and other powers of transformation that are achieved through meditative absorption. The process of meditation is described in Distinguishing Center and L im it:This comes about due to the causes on which it depends— eliminating five flaws and using eight remedial techniques.777That is to say, one meditates as discussed earlier, employing the eight remedial techniques.778(C) As for what these constitute in their essence, they are in general states"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEof meditative absorption that are fourfold from the point of view of being supportive factors. Meditative absorption that involves intention is carried out on the basis of exertion as a dedicated application, due to which one reaches a state of one-pointed attention; while due to another aspect of meditative absorption that involves investigation, thoroughly analyzing in detail the spiritual teachings given by others, one reaches that same state of one-pointed mind.(D) The purpose, or result, of these bases is that one wishes to make any given supernormal power fully evident, and brings it into full evidence by directing one s mind accordingly.(E) As for the context, one cultivates these bases during the final phase of the path of accumulation.One might ask why meditative absorption is referred to here as a “basis of supernormal powers.” The term signifies that this absorption serves as a support for one to acquire all spiritual qualities.Four Anticipatory Phases [ii]As for the stages of meditation in the four anticipatory phases, the source verses state:During the four phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough, one applies two groups of five factors—confidence, diligence, mindfulness, meditative absorption, and sublime intelligence— to the sixteen topics pertaining to the Four Truths.The foregoing meditative absorption brings one to the path of linkage, which anticipates the decisive breakthrough779 and has four phases: warmth, the peak experience, patient acceptance, and the highest state of mundane experience. During these four phases, one focuses on the sixteen topics that pertain to the Four Truths (those of impermanence and so forth),780 apply­ing two groups of five factors: the five governing powers—confidence, dili­gence, mindfulness, meditative absorption, and sublime intelligence—and the five strengths that are the transmutation of these.781 [3.184b]In this regard:(A) The scope o f onesfocus in cultivating the five governing powers is that of the Four Truths, because these topics constitute aspects of those truths insofar as they link one to the path of spiritually advanced beings.782"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"(B) As for the process o f meditation™ one meditates with confidence, such that this gives one the conviction that these truths address what is to be understood and what is to be eliminated; with diligence, such that ones enthusiasm is aroused in order for one to come to a realization of what these truths actually entail; with mindfulness, such that one does not forget the topics on which to focus (that is, what these truths actually entail); with meditative absorption, such that one s attention is focused in a one-pointed manner; and with sublime intelligence, such that the topics of these truths are individually and precisely analyzed.(C) This process, in its essence, consists of the five governing powers of confidence, diligence, mindfulness, meditative absorption, and sublime intelligence.(D) The result is the swift attainment of the path of seeing and the accom­plishment of the four steps in the path of meditation.(E) As for the context, one cultivates these powers during the two phases of warmth and the peak experience.If one wonders why the term “governing power” is used, it is because these factors give one governance over that which supports the state of definitive excellence—that is, over the mundane factors associated with the completely refined state of enlightenment.Next, in the cultivation of the five strengths:(A) The scope fo r ones focus and (B) the content employed are similar to the foregoing case.(C) In their essence, these strengths constitute an increase in the force of confidence and the rest of the five powers, such that they become solely remedial, without any admixture of a lack of confidence of any of the coun­terproductive factors; this is what the term “strength” signifies.(D) Their result is the onset of the phases of patient acceptance and the highest state of mundane experience, and the accomplishment of the path of seeing.(E) As to the context, one cultivates these strengths during the phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane state. As Distinguishing Cen­ter and L im it states:For the governing powers and the five strengths there are two pairs of anticipatory phases.784MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - 2.71"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"172. -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThe meaning of the term has just been discussed in the discussion of their essence.Path of Seeing [iii]As to the stages of meditation on the path of seeing, the source verses state:On the path of seeing, there are seven aids to enlightenment: mindfulness, thorough analysis of phenomena, diligence, joy, thorough pliancy, meditative absorption, and impartiality.(A) The scope o f one'sfocus in cultivating the seven aids to enlightenment (which are the factors to be cultivated on the path of seeing) is that of what the Four Truths of spiritually advanced beings actually entail. [3.185a](B) As for the process o f meditation™ authentic mindfulness as an aid to enlightenment ensures that, when one focuses on suffering, one seeks to remove it; when one focuses on the all-pervasive origin of suffering, one seeks to be free of desire and attachment for it; when one focuses on the ces­sation of suffering, one seeks to experience that fully; and when one focuses on the path that leads to the cessation of suffering, one seeks to cultivate it. The process for the remaining six aids is similar.(B) In their essence, these aids are as follows: (1) mindfulness is not for­getting the scope of the path of seeing; sublime intelligence is (2) a thor­ough analysis of the suchness of phenomena; (3) diligence is enthusiasm for what is virtuous; (4) incorruptible joy is a beneficial influence on the mind and body; (5) thorough pliancy is flexibility of mind and body; (6) medita­tive absorption is a one-pointed state of attention; and (7) impartiality is the minds engagement without the fluctuation due to mental lethargy or agitation.(C) As to the way in which these function as aids,786 mindfulness is an aid that provides a sense of abiding because its influence is one of ensuring that the other aids do not stray from their focus. A thorough analysis of phenomena is an aid by its very nature because it is, in essence, the non- conceptual state that constitutes the nature of the path of seeing. Diligence is an aid to one s will to be free of samsára, for through relying on it, one feels a certainty about one s release from suffering. Joy is an aid that consti­tutes a benefit and advantage, for it comes about as the result of the other"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"aids. The remaining three aids (thorough pliancy and the rest) are aids in negating afflictive states because it is thorough pliancy that brings about the absence those states, meditative absorption that constitutes the absence of those states, and impartiality that is, in its essence, the absence of those states. The foregoing is referred to in the following lines from Distinguish­ing Center and L im it:An aid by nature, an aid providing a sense of abiding,the third an aid to the will to be free,the fourth an aid that is a benefit and advantage,and three that are aids in negating afflictive states.787 [3.185b](D) The purpose and result of these aids is one of bringing about the removal of all factors without exception that are to be eliminated on the path of seeing.(E) As for the context, once one attains the path of seeing, the nature of that state itself is that of these seven aids to enlightenment.Path of Meditation [iv]As to the stages of meditation on the path of meditation, the source verses state:The path of meditation is explained as eightfold: authentic view, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and meditative absorption.(A) The scope o f ones focus and (B) the content involved in cultivation of the eightfold path of spiritually advanced beings (which is the factor that is to be cultivated on the path of meditation) are as described previously.(C) The branches of this path are, in their essence, as follows:(1) authentic view is the thorough determination, in postmeditation, of what characterizes the realization one gains during formal meditative equi­poise;(2) authentic thought is the motivation to speak so as to convey to others what one has oneself realized;(3) authentic speech is the verbal ability, on the basis of that motivation, to actually convey to others what one has realized;MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - 2.73"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(4) authentic action is action that is totally purified of such acts as the taking of life ;(5) authentic livelihood is mental and verbal activity that is totally pure of such activities as ingratiation or hypocrisy;(6) authentic effort is diligence in applying remedies in order to remove all the factors without exception that are to be eliminated on the path of meditation;(7) authentic mindfulness consists of not forgetting the purpose of calm abiding, of holding ones attention intently, and of impartiality;(8) authentic meditative absorption is meditation for the purpose of dis­pelling obscurations that impede one s experience of supernormal states of perception and other special spiritual qualities.These branches are considered to be present on the path of seeing insofar as they are attained on the basis of the potential of formal meditative equi­poise of that path; they are considered in their essence to constitute the path of seeing in that they become fully evident on that path.These eight branches function as four kinds of aids. That is to say, authentic view is the aid that involves thorough determination; [3.186a] it constitutes the investigation “This is what has been realized during formal meditative equipoise.” Thought is the aid that promotes understanding because it con­stitutes the motivation to speak in ways that completely define what one has realized. Speech, action, and livelihood are aids that inspire conviction, for they inspire confidence concerning view, discipline, and a completely pure livelihood, respectively. The three branches of effort, mindfulness, and meditative absorption are aids that are remedies to counterproductive influ­ences because they function as remedies to the afflictive states that are to be eliminated on the path of seeing, to the afflictive states that contribute to mental laxity and agitation, and to influences that are counterproductive to the attainment of such special spiritual qualities as supernormal states of perception, respectively. As is said:Involving thorough determination, promoting understanding, bringing conviction (in the case of three branches) in the minds of others,and serving as remedies to counterproductive influences— these are the eight branches of the path.It is held that others are made aware of view, discipline, and few material needs.788"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH- 2.75There are remedies to counterproductive influencesthat involve afflictive states, secondary afflictive states, and mastery.789(D) The result of these branches is that, due to one s cultivating them, all possible factors to be eliminated are removed.(E) As to the context, they are cultivated at the point that one has attained the path of meditation.In this regard, proponents of the Particularist school explain that the seven aids to enlightenment constitute the path of meditation since they are associated with what derives from meditation. For this school, the eightfold path of spiritually advanced beings constitutes the path of seeing because the path of seeing is the “wheel of dharma,” and the eightfold path (due to its facilitating swift progress and so forth) can be likened to a precious wheel.790On the path of no more training,791 one has the incorruptible knowl­edge that suffering has been understood, its all-pervasive origin eliminated, its cessation made fully evident, and the path cultivated. As well, one has the incorruptible knowledge: “Suffering has been understood; now there is nothing more to understand” and so forth, [3.186b] up to “The path has been cultivated; now there is nothing more to cultivate.” But other than these successive states of knowledge, that negative factors have been exhausted, and that suffering will not occur again, there is nothing upon which to med­itate as some additional focus with a specific object or structure.792Pratyekabuddha Approach [2]As for the stages of meditation in the pratyekabuddha approach, the source verses state:Pratyekabuddhas employ the foregoing and, in addition, the process of interdependent connection, and focus their attention on the three avenues to complete liberation.Pratyekabuddhas, having traversed their path by relying on the aspects of the totally refined state of enlightenment that were just discussed and on the process by which things occur through interdependent connec­tion, maintain the focus of their attention on the three avenues to com­plete liberation."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"276 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEIn this regard, speaking generally, there are three ways in which pratyek- abuddhas train in their path:(1) Some of those who belong to the pratyekabuddha type serve the bud- dhas who appear during one hundred eons. Having thus matured them­selves for the state of a pratyekabuddhas enlightenment, they then become learned in six topics793 in order to attain that state.(2) Some serve the buddhas that appear over an indeterminate period of time and listen to spiritual teachings by relying on holy masters. Having reflected on these teachings accurately, in the presence of spiritual masters, they undergo the experiences of the anticipatory phases of the path of link­age. However, unable in that lifetime to gain full realization of these teach­ings or the fruition of their spiritual practice, they become learned in the six topics in order to attain that state in a future lifetime.(3) While similar to the foregoing on other points, some gain full realiza­tion of these teachings in the presence of spiritual masters and fully experi­ence one or the other of the first two stages of fruition. However, unable to fully experience the latter two stages of fruition, they become learned in the six topics in order to experience these stages fully in a future lifetime.Of these three models, the first are those who are solitary like a rhinoc­eros,794 while the latter two are those who participate in groups/95 [3.187a]In any of these cases, in the lifetime following that one, they are reborn in worlds in which there are no buddhas or sravakas. Upon going to cem­eteries and seeing the bones there, they immediately feel disenchanted with samsara. They think “Alas! Where did these bones come from? They came from aging and death. Where did aging and death come from? They came from birth ...” and so forth, examining in succession the twelve links in the process of interdependent connection. Wondering “How can I become liberated from this?” they then cut through the root of those twelve links, undermining the process of interdependent connection by arresting igno­rance, karmic patterning, and so on, through the arresting of aging and death. Once they understand that all phenomena occur merely through a process of interdependent connection, they meditate on the twelve links of interdependence and the sixteen topics pertaining to the Four Truths. They thus fully experience the five paths in a single session, and so maintain an ongoing focus on the process of interdependence and complete liberation.In this regard, the following explanation is given:(1) Of the three avenues to complete liberation that concern the know- able, emptiness is the lack of identity; the absence of subtle traits is the non­existence of anything the self takes to be its own; and the absence of naive"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - 277speculation is the lack of any fixed frame of reference.(2) In terms of the path, of the three avenues to complete liberation, emptiness is the cessation of suffering; the absence of subtle traits is the path; and the absence of naïve speculation constitutes suffering and its all- pervasive origin.(3) In terms of the fruition, of the three avenues to complete liberation, emptiness and the absence of subtle traits pertain to the state in which there are no residual traces, whereas the absence of naïve speculation pertains to the state that still involves residual traces.796Mahàyàna Approach [B]An explanation of the stages of meditation in the Mahâyâna approach of the transcendent perfections is threefold: the individual who engages in such meditation, the preliminaries to such meditation, and the actual stages to be carried out in meditation.Individual Meditator [1]The source verses state:Those who have awakened their affinity for the Mahâyâna uphold the two aspects of bodhicitta.An individual who is an aspirant for following the Mahàyàna path of the transcendent perfections is someone in whom the affinity for the Mahàyàna approach has awakened and who upholds the training involved in the two aspects of bodhicitta—relative and ultimate. [3.187b]As for the nature of that spiritual affinity, the sütra Discourse o f Oueen Érimâlâ states:The potential for attaining the state of suchness permeates all beings.797And the Highest Continuum says:Because the kàya of perfect buddhahood is pervasive, because the state of suchness is indivisible,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"178 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEand because all beings possess spiritual affinity, beings are forever endowed with buddha nature.798As these passages demonstrate, this affinity abides innately and perva­sively in all beings.If one analyzes this spiritual affinity, it is twofold: that which is naturally abiding and that which is perfectly developed. As to what these constitute in essence, the incomparable Dakpo has the following to say:First, as to the naturally abiding aspect of spiritual affinity, it is the capacity to develop the qualities of buddhahood, partakes of a timeless quality, and is obtained by the true nature of reality.As to the perfectly developed aspect of that affinity, it is that capacity to develop the qualities of buddhahood that is attained by ones having become familiar with fundamentally positive qualities.Thus, these two aspects provide the good fortune for one to awaken to buddhahood.799Synonymous terms are “spiritual affinity,” “potential,” “natural state,” and “fundamental being.”800In considering specific situations, the Ornament o f the Mahây âna Sütras discusses five alternatives,801 which is to say:(1) the fact that someone has the spiritual affinity for the Mahàyàna approach is the proximate cause of buddhahood;(2.) given that the spiritual affinities of srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas eventually lead to the attainment of buddhahood, they are the more long­term causes;(3) of those whose affinity is uncertain, for some it is the more direct cause, (4) for others the more long-term cause;802 and(5) even in the case of those whose spiritual affinity is said to be “cut offi’ this is only in consideration of the length of time required, not that they will somehow never attain enlightenment; for them, then, it is the extremely long-term cause.803Therefore, because beings have these kinds of spiritual affinity, this scrip­ture states that ordinary beings are endowed with the quintessential poten­tial for buddhahood."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH- 279Nevertheless, the affinities for both the ¿ràvaka and pratyekabuddha approaches are more rudimentary, whereas that for the Mahâyâna is far more sublime than all the others; in the former cases, the affinity is fully expressed by the refining away of the afflictive obscurations alone, while the latter is only fully expressed with the refining away of both levels of obscura­tion.804 [3.188a]The Mahâyâna affinity can be either awakened or remain unawakened; how these situations are to be understood is discussed in the sütra Discourse on the Ten Attributes'.The affinity of intelligent bodhisattvascan be known from indications,just as fire can be known from the presence of smoke,or water from that of water fowl.805As this source states, one can know these situations from the signs or indications. The signs that this affinity has been awakened are that one’s actions and speech are naturally gentle, without one s having had to rely on remedies; that one s mind holds little hypocrisy or deceit; and that one is loving and sincere toward beings. Again, from the sütra Discourse on the Ten Attributes:Not being a rough or crude person, completely rejecting hypocrisy and deceit, and being utterly sincere toward all beings— such is a bodhisattva.806In addition, one feels compassion for beings bdfore undertaking any activity; is inspired by the Mahâyâna teachings; has forbearance, not being daunted by undertaking difficult challenges; and engages wholeheartedly in the fundamentally positive attributes entailed in the transcendent perfec­tions. This is stated in the Ornament o f the Mahâyâna Sütras:Even before one undertakes training,to have compassion, inspiration, and forbearance,and to pursue what is positive wholeheartedly,are to be known as the indications of spiritual affinity.807"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The signs that one s spiritual affinity, although latently present, has not yet been awakened are described in the Highest Continuum:If one lacks sensitivity to one s fundamental being, one s buddha nature,one will never be sufficiently dissatisfied with suffering, or desire nirvana,or strive for it, or even aspire to it.808That is to say, this is like the situation of the vast majority of ordinary people.As to the circumstances under which one s spiritual affinity is awakened, it is awakened when one is free of counterproductive conditions and influ­enced by conducive ones; as long as the opposite is die case, one s affinity will remain unawakened. [3.188b] There are four conditions that are coun­terproductive: to be reborn in a state devoid of spiritual freedom;809 to be heedless;810 to engage in morally wrong actions; and to be subject to the harm caused by obscurations. There are two conditions that are conducive: the external condition of others teaching one the sacred dharma; and the internal condition of one s reflecting on these teachings correctly and being inspired by what is spiritually positive.Hence, this affinity is crucial since individuals in whom it has awakened are capable of following the Mahayana path and applying it in their ongoing experience.Preliminaries to Meditation [2]The explanation of the preliminaries to meditation is twofold: the training of one s mind in the four immeasurable attitudes and the process of gaining ongoing experience through the ordinary path of accumulation.Four Immeasurable Attitudes [a]The source verses state:The initial step is that of the four immeasurable attitudes (loving­kindness and so forth).Beginning practitioners focus on beings; those who are advanced in practice180 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"focus on phenomena; those who have gained patient acceptance have no fixed frame of reference.For those who wish to train on the path of the transcendent perfections, the initial step is to train in the four immeasurable attitudes (loving-kind- ness and so forth), which constitute the training for bodhicitta as aspira­tion. According to the Intermediate Length “Mother”'.O Subhuti, thus a great and heroic bodhisattva should cultivate supreme loving-kindness, supreme compassion, supreme joy, and supreme impartiality.811And from the Sublime Heart Essence:O Sàriputra, thus there are four pure states—those of loving- kindness, compassion, joy, and impartiality that are not preced­ed by the authentic arousal of bodhicitta and that do not entail such arousal. These states entail the overt formative patterns that contribute to conditioned existence.There are four immeasurable attitudes—those of loving-kind­ness, compassion, joy, and impartiality that are preceded by the authentic arousal of bodhicitta and that do entail such arousal. These states entail the formative patterns that contribute to the path to nirvana.812In this tradition, the distinction is simply one of the immeasurability entailed.813 And as the Categories o f the Levels states: [3.189 a]The four immeasurable attitudes develop both with a conceptual frame of reference (whether that of beings or the true nature of reality) or without a frame of reference.81'1That is to say, having understood the distinction between there being a conceptual frame of reference or not, one trains either within the scope of such a framework or within the scope of the immeasurable attitude in itself.815These attitudes are developed through four conditions:(1) the causal condition is that of one s naturally abiding spiritual affin­ity—that is, one s fundamental being;MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - l8l"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"zSz —THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(2) the governing condition is a spiritual mentor who instructs one in the teachings concerning the four immeasurable attitudes;(3) the referential condition is the scope of the respective attitude that has become fully evident;816 and(4) the immediate condition is one s prior familiarity with the benefits and advantages of cultivating these four immeasurable attitudes and the shortcomings of not doing so.The processes by which these attitudes develop are explained as being threefold, depending on the specific scope of the focus:(1) those who are beginning practitioners, who have not realized the absence of identity in things, develop the four immeasurable attitudes by focusing on beings;(2) those who are advanced in practice—who have realized 75 per cent of that absence817—develop these attitudes by focusing on phenomena; and(3) those who have gained patient acceptance, who have realized both aspects of that absence, develop these attitudes through a process that involves no frame of reference.With respect to the foregoing processes, the Levels o f the Bodhisattva says:To have beings as the frame of reference is a process held in com­mon with non-Buddhist holders of extreme views. To have phe­nomena as the frame of reference is a process held in common with all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. To have no fixed frame of reference is a process that has nothing in common with any of the foregoing.818Path of Accumulation [b]The source verses state:As preliminaries, one maintains discipline, controls the senses, exercises moderation in eating, exerts oneself in spiritual practice in the late evening and early morning, takes joy in maintaining alertness, is enthusiastic without regret, enjoys the seven riches of spiritually advanced beings, engages in the ten kinds of spiritual activity, and relies on inspiration and other positive causes of liberation;..."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"From the point that they first embark on the Mahayana path of accumu­lation [3.189b] until they reach the path of linkage, beginning practition­ers—completely motivated by the wish to attain enlightenment—maintain completely pure discipline; control their senses; exercise moderation in eat­ing; exert themselves in spiritual practice, foregoing sleep in the late eve­ning and early morning; take joy in maintaining alertness in issues requiring moral choices; and are extremely enthusiastic and have no regret at dieir positive actions.819The seven riches are as stated:Faith in the basis of truth, pure ethical discipline, hearing of many teachings, familiarity with giving, knowing modesty concerning others, having great self-respect concerning oneself, and having sublime intelligence in abundance; these are the seven riches of spiritually advanced beings.820The ten kinds of spiritual activity are spoken of in Distinguishing Center and Lim itiCopying texts, making offerings, giving generously, listening to teachings, reading them, memorizing them, explaining them, reciting texts aloud, contemplating and meditating— these embody the ten kinds of activity, the qualities of which are incalculable.821The practical application of these is discussed, for example, in the excel­lent writings of Situ Rinpoche Chokyi Gyaltsen.822In addition, the preliminaries involve ones efforts to increase ones spiritual progress through any and all positive acts—such as arousing one s inspiration and other positive factors that serve as causes of ones libera­tion—without any bias or prejudice. One then can embark on the stages of the path in the actual practice of meditation.Actual Stages of Meditation [3]The actual stages to be cultivated in meditation are threefold: the stages for training ones mind in general, the specific processes of meditation inMEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - 183"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"184 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEformal practice and postmeditation, and a summary that simply mentions four applications.General Stages of Mental Training [a]The source verses state:One trains one s mind with the four axioms, the five factors conducive to liberation, recollection of the Victorious One and so forth, the nine perceptions of impurity, the eight thoughts of a superior spiritual practitioner, and the thorough purification of one s sphere of activity.For those on the path of accumulation, in general it is the four axioms that denote the Buddhas words and other similar topics that are to be culti­vated in meditation. [3.190a] Of these, the way in which one meditates on the four axioms is to arouse bodhicitta; to then meditate (1) on all that is conditioned being impermanent, (2) on the nature of what entails corrupt­ibility being that of samsara and suffering, (3) on all phenomena as lacking identity, and (4) on nirvana as a state of peace; one then concludes with dedication.823As for “recollection of the Victorious One and so forth,” this refers to one s recollection of the Buddha, dharma, saiigha, one s ethical discipline, giving, one s body, death, birth, and the inhalation and exhalation of ones’ breath.The nine perceptions of impurity are of a corpse decomposing, rid­den with maggots, motded with dark blotches, rotting, putrefying, being devoured by wild animals, scattered in pieces, being cremated, and disinte- grating.824The eight thoughts of a superior spiritual practitioner are to think as fol­lows:(1) “At some point, may I be capable of removing the suffering of beings!”(2) “At some point, may I be capable of bringing great wealth to beings who are afflicted by poverty!”(3) “At some point, may I be capable of ensuring benefit for beings with this flesh-and-blood body!”"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - 285(4) “At some point, may I be capable of ensuring benefit for beings, even if it means my remaining in a hell realm for a long time!”(5) “At some point, may I be capable of fulfilling the hopes of beings with great wealth, both mundane and transcendent!”(6) “At some point, having awakened to buddhahood, may I truly be capable of bringing beings out of their suffering!”(7) “In all my lifetimes, may I never take a rebirth that does not benefit beings, or engage solely in experiencing the ultimate,825 or speak words that do not satisfy all beings, or adopt a livelihood (or a body or intelligence or wealth or power) that does not benefit others, or take any joy in what harms others!” [3.190b](8) “May the fruits of beings harmful actions ripen for me, while the fruits of my positive actions ripen for them!”As for the thorough purification of one s sphere of activity, the Ornament o f the Mahay ana Sutras states:When heirs of the victorious ones act in any way whatsoever, their perceptions826 functioning in a variety of ways, they are aware of things as they are and, with appropriate words, make this evident in their ideas in order to benefit beings.827This passage should be understood to mean that which accords with a thorough purification of the sphere of one s ordinary activity. When bodhi- sattvas enter a building, they arouse bodhicitta and think, “May all beings gain the citadel of liberation!” Using this as a model, when they lie down to sleep, they think, “May beings attain the kayas of buddhahood!” If they dream, they think, “May beings realize all phenomena to be like dream images!” Once they awaken, they think, “May beings awaken from their ignorance!” As they arise, they think, “May beings gain the enlightened forms of buddhas!” When they don clothing, they think, “May beings don the raiment of modesty and self-respect!” As they tie their sashes,828 they think, “May beings unite themselves with fundamentally positive quali­ties!” If they sit on seats, they think, “May beings attain the vajra seat!”829 Thinking in such ways, they feel, “I arouse bodhicitta!” Practicing in such ways, one trains one s mind.830"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEFormal Meditation Sessions and in Ppstmeditation [b]As for the specific processes of meditation in formal practice and postmedi­tation, there are two considerations: the specific phases of formal practice vis-à-vis postmeditation and a general discussion of the postmeditation phase.Formal Meditation vis-à-vis Postmeditation [i]The source verses state:In the specific phase of formal practice, the significance of the Middle Way is paramount, and that involves investigation as a preliminary.Autonomists rest in the significance of an unqualified negation, comparable to space.For Consequentialists, the basic space of phenomena (as what to become familiar with) and the mind that becomes familiar are inseparable, like water poured into water.For those who profess qualified emptiness, the state is nonconceptual and utterly lucid.They all agree on the key point of there simply being a freedom from elaboration.In the specific case of the meditation that is unique to those who follow the Mahàyàna approach, during the phase of formal practice, it is the signifi­cance itself of the profound Middle Way (concerning which they have come to a definitive conclusion through hearing and contemplating teachings) that is their paramount concern in meditation. [3.191a]In this regard, those who profess the Autonomist interpretation begin by arousing bodhicitta and pursuing an investigation with the discerning function of their sublime intelligence. They then rest in equipoise, in a mode of “one taste” within the essence of emptiness comparable to space, an unqualified negation in which all extremes due to conceptual elabora­tion have been removed, so that there is no concept even of whether 01* not the very mind that is becoming familiar with the practice has anything with which to become familiar. Given that the conventional designation of “primordial union”831 is not used in this interpretation, the postmedita­"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH- 187tion phase in this context is one of not blocking what manifests in light of ordinary awareness, while overtly conceiving of developing one s merit within a state in which, in light of timeless awareness, there is no fixed frame of reference whatsoever. It is this that they term the “primordial union of the two levels of truth”; they also term it the “development of merit that is imbued with sublime intelligence that does not conceive of the three focal points.”832Those who profess the Consequentialist interpretation begin with the arousal of bodhicitta and an investigation with sublime intelligence. They then arrive at a nondual state, like that of water poured into water, without the mind that becomes familiar and the basic space of phenomena with which it becomes familiar being separate and distinct. Although they use the conventional designation of “sublime intelligence that realizes the basic space of phenomena,” in actuality they have no classification of something to be known versus that which knows it, and so they do not employ even the conventional designation of “primordial union.” As for the postmedita­tion phase, their way of thinking about it is like that in the context of the Autonomists.As for those who profess qualified emptiness [gzhan stong], they begin with the arousal of bodhicitta and a brief investigation in which there is no frame of reference of things having any inherent nature. They then abide in the state of supreme utter lucidity, spontaneously present without involv­ing any conceptual thinking. They rest in equipoise of that naturally lucid self-knowing awareness—timeless awareness that is devoid of the duality of perceived object and perceiving subject—and this by way of not think­ing in terms of, or fixating in any way whatsoever on, ordinary distinctions of such elaborations as “exists,” “does not exist,” “is,” or “is not.” As for the poscmeditation phase, they take as many tangible phenomena as there are as objects but do not fixate on any of the ordinary distinctions of conceptual elaboration whatsoever. This they term the “primordial union of the mani­fest and emptiness,” [3.191b] and it is within this context that they engage in the development of merit on a vast scale. The phase of formal practice they refer to as the “primordial union of lucidity and emptiness” because it is empty of any conceptual thinking, while not straying from what is, in its essence, lucid pure awareness.The foregoing three interpretations agree on the key point of simply rest­ing in equipoise within basic space, which is a freedom from conceptual elaboration."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"General Discussion of Postmeditation [ii]The source verses state:In the postmeditation phase one meditates successively on the thirty-seven factors that contribute to enlightenment; their significance has extraordinary dimensions of vastness and profundity.In the phase of postmeditation, once one has arisen from that of for­mal practice, on the lesser degree of the path of accumulation, one practices the applications of mindfulness by regarding the body, sensations, mind, and phenomena as having no inherent nature in any authentic sense, medi­tating on their very essence without conceiving of them individually: this is the aspect of profundity. And one meditates on the body as being like an illusion, sensations as being like dream images, the mind as being like utterly lucid space, and phenomena as being adventitious like clouds: this is the aspect of vastness.833 Likewise, one meditates successively on the thirty- seven factors that contribute to enlightenment.834 These are enumerated here just as they are in the context of the sravaka approach; however, their significance as factors that contribute to enlightenment in the Mahayana approach is such that, as the immediately preceding discussion illustrates, there are extraordinary dimensions with respect to the profundity of their scope and the vastness with which that scope is applied.Summary [c]As for a summary that simply mentions the four applications,835 the source verses state:In summary, through four applications—perfecting all aspects, culminating, sequential, and instantaneous— one gains accomplishment of the “mother,” the unsurpassable and transcendent perfection.If we condense all the limitless stages of the paths of the Mahayana approach into a summary, the consummate fruition to be attained is that of omniscience; the means to attain that is knowledge of the path; and as an2.88 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"MEDITATION IN THE CAUSE-BASED DIALECTICAL APPROACH - 189auxiliary entailed in the moral choices one makes in that context, knowl­edge of the ground (that is, knowledge of counterproductive factors in ones existing situation and of a detailed analysis of remedies). These three aspects of knowledge constitute the context within which one puts an end to erro­neous assumptions. [3.192a]The four applications involved in spiritual practice are:(1) the “application that perfects all aspects” is one of meditation in turn on some 173 topics, which subsume within them the significance of the definitive conclusions that one has reached through hearing and contem­plating teachings concerning the foregoing aspects of knowledge;(2) the “culminating application” is one of developing ones realization (based upon meditation that summarizes the foregoing aspects of knowl­edge) to a consummate level;(3) the “sequential application” is one of meditating as before but on all topics at once, in order to gain stability from the foregoing application; and(4) once that stability has been gained, the “instantaneous application” is one of meditating on the topics of the three aspects of knowledge in a single instant of timeless awareness, so that it is certain that immediately following this the fruition state will become fully evident.Once one has pursued spiritual practice in the foregoing manner, one will straightforwardly accomplish what is renowned as the unsurpassable Prajriaparamita (the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence), the supreme mother, dharmakaya—that is, the three kayas and their attendant enlightened deeds.Theforegoing constitutes the commentary on the second part, concerning a presentation o f the specific stages in meditation in the cause-based dialectical approach.This concludes the commentary on [thefirst two parts of] the eighth book,a developmental analysis o f the higher training in meditative absorption, from The Encompassing of All Knowledge, also entitled The Precious Treasury of Sublime Teachings:The Compendium of the Methods of All Spiritual Approachesand A Treatise That Thoroughly Presents the Three Higher Trainings."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Appendix: Outline of Book Seven and Book Eight, Parts One and Tw oBo o k Sev e n[Part i.

These are three aspects o f meditative absorption that bring about the attainment o f the complete liberation o f nirvana; they are associated with the Cittamatra position that all that is knowable is subsumed under the three headings of imputation, depen­dence, and the absolute. The three avenues are:(1) emptiness as an avenue to complete liberation, which is the realization that con­ceptually imputed phenomena do not exist;(2) the absence o f subde traits as an avenue to complete liberation, which is the real­ization that what is absolute and unconditioned has no subde traits such as shape, color, and so on;(3) the absence o f naive speculation as an avenue to complete liberation, which is the elimination o f reliance on dependent, conditioned phenomena due to the knowledge that such reliance produces only suffering.On diese three avenues, see Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophi­cal Systems, 145:O f the three avenues to complete liberation that concern the knowable, emptiness is the nonexistence o f a self; the absence o f characteristics is the nonexistence o f anything the self takes to be its own; and the absence of speculation is a nonrefercntial state. In terms o f the path, o f the three avenues to complete liberation, emptiness is the truth o f cessation; the absence of characteristics is the truth o f the path; and the absence o f naive assumption constitutes the truths o f suffering and its universal origin. In terms o f the frui­tion, o f the three avenues to liberation, emptiness and the absence o f charac­teristics pertain to the state in which there are no residual traces, whereas the absence o f naive assumption pertains to the state that still involves residual traces.40.

These are attempts to translate the Tibetan terms dgongspa and Idem dgongs. “Inten­tion” conveys an honorific term for the activity o f the enlightened mind o f a bud- dha— the functional equivalent o f an ordinary beings thinking process. In the context discussed here, it refers to the specific motive or intention that informs a bud­dhas teaching.5 2. The woodblock o f The Treasury o f Knowledge has, in error, “conventional” {tha snyad) for “different” {tha dad).53. That is, some meaning other than the obvious one contained in the statement.54. Vipasyin was a buddha in a former eon, the first o f “seven successive buddhas” spo­ken o f in the Buddhist teachings—Vipaiyin, Sikhin, Visvabhu, Krakucchanda (the first buddha o f the present eon), Kanakamuni, Kasyapa, and Sakyamuni (the fourth buddha o f the present eon, in which some 1,002 buddhas will appear in total). The statement cited is a case of the Buddha Sakyamuni describing his attainment o f buddhahood as that o f “becoming” Vipaiyin.5 5. That is, the fact that all buddhas awaken to the same ultimate realization o f dharma- kaya, and so are equal in that respect.56. As Kongtruls discussion indicates, these correspond to the three principles by which16 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"NOTES - 317the Cittamatra school o f Buddhist philosophy describes the entire range o f phenom­ena— imputation, dependence, and the absolute.57. “Imputation” (Tib. kun brtags\\ S k i.p a rik a lp ita ) refers to the adventitious mental pro­cess o f assigning labels and describing things in terms o f categories. Something that is imputed, being nothing more than a conceptual label imposed by the ordinary mind, does not exist even conventionally, let alone ultimately.58. Imputed things are nonexistent in their very essence with respect to their character­istics because they are phenomena that are imputed to exist when in fact they do not, like a mottled rope being mistaken for a snake.$9. “Dependent” ijY'fo.gzhan dbang-, Skt.paratan tra) refers to things that are empirically verifiable and brought about through causes and conditions, such that they then serve as bases for the foregoing process o f imputation. The impure aspect of this dependence constitutes the animate and inanimate universe, manifesting because o f the minds myriad habit patterns; these manifestations are “dependent” by virtue of the fact that they are dependent on other conditions, namely, karma and habit patterns. The pure aspect o f dependence constitutes pure realms o f experience, such as Sukhavati (the Realm o f Bliss associated with the buddha Amitabha); these are “dependent” in that they rely on circumstances that are due to the mind being purified o f its obscurations.60. Because phenomena that are dependent {gzhan dban g) come about through the influ­ence [dbang) o f causes and conditions other {gzhan) than themselves, not only is there no snake existing in the m otded rope (see the example in n. 58 o f an imputed phe­nomenon), but even the mottled rope itself, being nothing more than a collection o f many individual strands, cannot be found to exist in its own right.61. This line o f reasoning, which refutes the belief that things originate through any o f the following four alternatives, is central to the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school of Buddhist philosophy and was elaborated by, among others, the Indian master Candrakirti in his Entrance to the M id d le Way. See Padmakara Translation Group, Introduction to the M id d le W ay, 165-278 and Wangchuk Dorje, the Ninth Karmapa, The K a rm a p a s M id d le Way, 185-314.62. Because it has already been established that things are not produced from themselves, nor from other things, some combination o f the foregoing two alternatives does not constitute a viable option.63. Because this would mean, for example, that anything could arise from anything, and that things would be independent o f time.64. M anifest A d o rn m en t o f Timeless Awareness, (Toh. 100), Dg.

The passage as cited does not appear in this source, although similar state­ments are found in it and throughout the m Do sde (Sutra) section o f the Kangyur.65. “Absolute” refers to both the “unchanging absolute”— the basic space o f phenom­ena as the true nature o f phenomena that is ultimately real, neither dependent nor imputed— and the “unerring absolute”— timeless awareness as experienced by spiritu­ally advanced beings in meditative equipoise.66. That is, what is “absolute”;docs not constitute some “thing” with any finite essence in the ultimate sense; by way o f analogy, just as in the example o f the mottled rope’s being mistaken for a snake, neither the rope nor the snake exists on the basis o f the individual strands.67.

They are: (1)—(5) the avenues o f sense consciousness (visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile); (6) the coordinating mental faculty that organizes sense data and develops conceptual frameworks; (7) the afflictive aspect o f consciousness, which imposes a sense o f individual identity; and (8) the basis o f all ordinary experience.73. That is, the faculties o f sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and conceptual thought as avenues o f sensory and mental experience.74.

The issue o f reliance here is not one o f “all or nothing.” Those factors on which one should not “rely” may nonetheless be useful and supportive in the shorter term; the question is one o f what one can ultimately place one s trust in. For example, in con­sidering the three objects o f refuge— buddha, dharma, and sarigha— only the first, the state o f buddhahood, represents the ultimate source o f refuge, with the dharma and sarigha being more “temporary” (in that they are only necessary as sources o f refuge until one becomes a buddha oneself), but this does not mean one is not to rely on them.79.

This lies at the very root of the path in Buddhism; the terms used to describe it (Skt. nihsarana\\ Tib. ngespar *byu n gba) are often rendered as “renunciation,” but the English word, with its negative connotations of aversion to, and fear of, the world at large, does poor justice to the sense o f the original terms. This sense o f dissatisfaction does not find its expression in a puritanical attitude o f repression and self-denial but rather as an inspired will to become free o f the limitations imposed by our present state o f ignorance o f our true nature and the confusion and frustration this imposes on our mind.83.

Six perspectives on the teachings that a Buddhist student uses in under­standing them: literal meaning (S: neyartha; T: drang-don), true meaning (S: nitartha; T: nges-don), implied (S: samdhya-bhasa; T: dgongs-pa-can), not implied (S: na samdhya-bhasa; T: dgongs-pa-can ma-yin-pa), explicit (S: yatharuta; T: sgra ji-bzhin-pa), and not explicit (S: na yatharuta; T: sgra ji-bzhin-pa ma-yin-pa). These are often used in conjunction with the “four methods.”His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche composed the following doha to explain the meaning o f these ten terms:The literal m eaning mainly expresses relative truth with appearances.Disciples are gradually shown the true meaning.The true m eanin g show s naked absolute truth beyond appearances.This is the oral instruction for fortunate ones with sharp faculties."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"320- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGETo cue the root o f existence, it is said, “Kill your parents.”The meaning itself—cultivating and refraining from attachments— is implied.The real meaning is said to be “conquering with remedies the cultivation o f attachments N ot im plied is said to show this clearly with words.In each o f die four orders of tantra, beginning with the mandala, fire offering, and so forth,Explicit dharma language is proclaimed.Bound by signs not proclaimed by sastras in the world,N o t explicit is bound by words difficult to understand.The actual root texts are explained word-for-word with definitions, according to syntax.That is the meaning o f words.The path o f mantrayana, the perfection o f ground, path, and fruition,Is only proclaimed in anuttara; this is the. general meaning.The extraordinary union and destruction, ali, kali, and so on,Are shown by code words; this is the hidden meaning.The unsurpassable secret o f the actual path and fruition Is clearly shown by both words and meanings; this is the ultim ate meaning.88.

The term “vajra word” (Tib. rdo rje’i tshig, Skt. vajrapada) refers to the use o f language in the Vajrayana tradition, where it is an inspired expression o f deep inner realization, and a word is suggestive o f multiple levels o f interpretation beyond its literal, lexical meaning.90. The Sanskrit term tantra (Tib. rgyud) literally means “continuum” and can be dis­cussed from the point o f view o f causal and resultant aspects. The causal aspect is the true and ultimate nature that remains constant for all ordinary beings as well as bud- dhas, and which undergoes no change during the process by which the former become the latter. This corresponds to what, in the sutra tradition, is termed tathdgatagarbha or sugatagarbha— the “buddha nature.” The resultant aspect o f tantra is the state o f complete enlightenment that “results” when purely adventitious factors that obscure that true nature have been removed.91. The completion stage in Vajrayana practice has two phases, a “thematic” one (Tib. mtshan bcas) based on conceptual structures that involve visualization, breathing exercises, and physical postures; and a “nonthematic” phase (Tib. mtshan med) that focuses on a formless and direct experience o f the true nature o f mind. Both phases are considered to constitute definitive meaning.92. That is, the thematic phase o f the completion stage.93. According to the Kagyii school o f Tibetan Buddhism (and in particular the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorj^, whose writings were a major source for Kongtrul in his composition o f The Treasury o f Knowledge), the Tibetan term kun g zh i (Skt. dlaya),"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"NOTES- 3Hhere rendered as “universal ground,” must be interpreted according to context. It often connotes a more negative sense o f a “basis for all ordinary experience,” as a subtle aspect o f ordinary mind that lies at the root o f samsara, sustains the imprints o f kar­mic patterning, and allows for the continuity between the commission o f an action and the experience o f its results, a continuity that often remains valid over lifetimes. Here, however, the term refers to the ground o f being that underlies both the ordinary consciousness o f samsara and the timeless awareness o f nirvana. In his treatise D is tin ­guishin g O rdinary Consciousness fro m Timeless Awareness, Rangjung Dorje notes that such Mahayana sutras as the Journey to S ri L an ka do not make a distinction when using this term, with the result that there are many points o f potential misinterpreta­tion in reading such sources. There is a need to distinguish between kun g zh i/d la ya as the universal ground o f being and as merely the basis o f all ordinary experience within samsara.94. That is, the nonthematic phase o f the completion stage.95. H evajra Tantra, (Toh. 417), Dg. K ., rGyud, vol. Na, p. 3 ,1. 6 to p. 4 ,1. 1.96. Source not identified.97.

This term (Tib. m a m p a kun g y i m chog dan g Idan p a'i sto n g p a nyid\\ Skt. sarvdkara varopeta iun yata) is a term that derives from the Kalacakra tradition. It emphasizes the aspect o f emptiness as a rich field o f possibility, not a blank state or a bleak void.99. Sublime intelligence (Tib. shes rab\\ Skt. p ra jn a) is considered to be the feminine principle in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. The transcendent perfection o f this intelligence is personified as a goddess (Tib. Shes rab kyi p h a rol tu ph yin m a\\ Skt. P rajn dpdram ita), who is the “mother” o f all buddhas in the sense that the enlighten­ment o f all who attain to buddhahood is “born” o f the realization o f this transcendent perfection.100. That is, realization o f emptiness reveals what has previously been hidden from ones direct understanding and experience.101. H evajra Tantra, (Toh. 417), Dg. K ., rGyud, vol. Na, p. 34,1. 6.102.

The terms “union and release” are code words for processes that are particularly discussed in the Mahayoga tradition o f the Nyingma school and the father tantra classes o f the Sarma schools. “Union” (Tib. sbyor ba; Skt. prayoga) in the ultimate sense refers to the resolution o f dualistic consciousness in the non­dual state o f timeless awareness; this is the underlying principle for the practices o f karmamudra and jrianamudra, which involve a physical or imagined consort,"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"respectively. “Release” (Tib. sgrol ba\\ Skt. uttarana) refers specifically to the ability gained in advanced Vajrayana practice that allows one to skillfully release the con­sciousness o f another being from its body and guide it to a higher state o f existence; this is admissible only when the one thus liberated would otherwise cause great harm through further actions in that lifetime. To confuse union and release with ordinary expressions o f sexual desire and aggression is to miss the point utterly; it is due to the potential for grave misinterpretation that these teachings and practices have histori­cally been closely guarded.104.

That is, common to the traditions o f both sutra and tantra.111. There are themes that bridge between the stages o f development and completion, such that methods used in the former stage have the threefold effect o f “purifying” one (Tib. sbyang ba) to prepare one to embark on practice o f the latter stage, o f “maturing” one (Tib. sm in pa) to be more capable o f such practice, and o f “finding their completion” (Tib. rdzogspa) in the latter stage.113. Tib. rang byingyis rlobpa\\ Skt. svadisthana. This term refers to practices such as that o f inner heat (T ib. gtum mo; Skt. candali), in which the harnessing o f subtle energies in the body to generate deeper states o f realization parallels die process o f karmamudra, in which one relics on a consort in sexual practices designed to harness those energies. Self-consecration, which is also termed “one s own body endowed with skillful means” (Tib. rang lus thabs Idan), is often presented as a preliminary training to practices involving a consort, termed “another’s body as the source o f sublime intelligence” (Tib.gzhan lusshes rab), but it can be considered a complete practice in itself.114. The “hidden” quality referred to is a case o f “self-secrecy” rather than something delib­erately being hidden, or withheld, from someone; the true nature o f phenomena is such that its profound implications are inaccessible to a mind unprepared by training. W hile such analyses of degrees do not in actuality apply to this true nature— which constitutes the “core,” or heart essence, o f the teachings, one can apply useful models (such as the one found in die Highest Continuum, which speaks o f three situations— the impure situation o f ordinary beings, the pure situation o f bodhisattvas, and the utterly pure situation o f buddhas) from the perspective o f the degree to which a given being can appreciate and direcdy experience the true nature o f reality.115.

Those who are brought to the path o f peace are ordinary mortal individuals who enter the spiritual path, for whom the first cycle o f teachings (dealing with the four truths) is most appropriate. Those who are brought to complete spiritual maturity are spiritually advanced beings (Tib. ’phags pa\\ Skt. drya)— that is, diose who attain the path o f seeing as defined in the particular Buddhist approach they are following— toward whom the intermediate cycle (dealing with emptiness) is geared. Those for whom prophecies are uttered are bodhisattvas on the eighth spiritual level (the prophecies concern their imminent attainment o f buddhahood), for whom the third cycle (dealing with a thorough and precise analysis o f reality) is most relevant.121.

In terms o f the path, o f the three avenues to complete liberation, emptiness is the truth o f cessation; the absence o f characteristics is the truth o f the path; and the absence o f speculation constitutes the truths o f suffering and its universal origin. In terms o f the fruition, o f the three avenues to liberation, emptiness and the absence o f characteristics pertain to the state in which there are no residual traces, whereas the absence o f speculation per­tains to the state that still involves residual traces.127.

The passage cited by Kongtrul is worded somewhat differendy in the source, although identical in substance:O children o f spiritual heritage, it is thus: Suppose, for example, that someone extremely skilled in the procedures for the refining o f gemstones should take from among such stones one that has not yet been refined. He washes it in water heavily infused with sodium chloride and polishes it with a piece o f black felt, thus polishing it. But he does not stop his diligent industry simply at this point, for following that he washes it in a strong solution o f mercury and polishes it with a piece o f serge, thus polishing it.

W hile the issue o f definitive vis-à-vis provisional is not as key in the Kagyü school, for example, both this school and the Nyingma tend to regard the intermediate cycle as being definitive in the shorter-term context o f the spiritual path and the development o f authentic view, while the final cycle is definitive in the more far-reaching sense diat concerns the practice o f meditation and the fruition state.138.

Moreover, lexical translations have singularly failed to adduce any reason why the Sanskrit term svabhava should be trans­lated into Tibetan as rang'bzhin in one case, and as ngo~bo-{nyid) in another.The fact that the Tibetan translators o f Sanskrit texts thought about what might be intended by the texts which they translated— which lexical transla­tors painstakingly avoid doing— forced them to use different words for oneterm [Here the word is] ngo-bo-{nyid) which corresponds to our ‘fact’ and‘facticity’.

The Sanskrit term Yogacdra has been translated here as “Yogic Practitioner.” The term yoga has gained prominence in recent times (and is now accepted as an English word in most dictionaries) but is often misunderstood in its Buddhist context because of the popularity o f hatha yoga and other non-Buddhist schools in the modern West.

Any connotation o f “union” (as “yoga” is often translated, given that the Sanskrit root {yuj) means “to yoke together”) is devoid o f a sense o f union w ith something other, such as some godhead or abstract absolute principle; rather, it is mind that is united with its own true nature in a nondual manner. Proponents of the Yogacara school were obviously not alone among Buddhists in practicing “yoga” (in the sense that the Buddhist tradition understands this term), any more than the Sautrantikas were the only “followers o f the sutras.” In The Treasury o f Knowledge: Book Six, P a rt Three: Fram eworks o f B u d d h ist Philosophy, 176-77, Kongtrul offers the following interesting etymology:The E ig h t Thousand S ta n za Perfection o f W isdom Sutra says:O sons and daughters of the victors: all these three realms are simply mind {sems tsam ).Since they practice correctly bringing to mind the meaning o f this quota­tion as it reflects [the actuality of] things {dngospo d a n g m th u n p a ), they are also known as Yogacaras.In her insightful note to this statement, Elizabeth Callahan (ibid., 349, n. 522) states the following:Early uses o f this term designated Buddhist practitioners in general, but it later came to be associated with the works attributed to Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu, possibly having been derived from the title of Asangas Yogdchdrabhumi {rN a l 'by or spyod p a ’i sa, B hum is o f Yogic Practice). . . .

In his own commentary to his source verses, Nagarjuna refers to a sutra entitled A dvice to K a tya ya n a, in which the Buddha refutes both existence and nonexistence ( U niversal Fearlessness: A C om m entary on the “Source Verses on Sublim e Intelligence, ” (Toh. 3829), Dg.

The term “what merely manifests” (Tib. snang tsam ) is synonymous with “relative truth” and “provisionally meaningful.” It refers to the interpretation found in the Middle Way school o f relative truth and the entire range o f sensory appearances— that these “merely manifest” within one’s perception without having to be assumed to have any autonomous existence in their own right.176.

The verse from Candraldrtis E ntrance to the M id d le Way states that any and all things have “two essences” (ngo bognyis), but these do not have equal status ontologically.

The Tibetan term kun rdzob (Skt. sa m vrti), translated here as “relative,” literally means “everything {kun) covered up (rdzob),” in the sense that the true nature of things remains inaccessible to one s perceptions on this level.

That is, the “unquantifiable aspect” of ultimate truth. Concerning these two aspects of ultimate truth, Longchen Rabjam {The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 103-4) makes the following statement:As for what is ultimate, this also has two aspects. There is a quantifiable aspect of the ultimate; this aspect entails the simple negation o f production and so forth in any true sense, but other than that, it does not entail freedom from the conceptual elaboration o f nonproduction. The unquantifiable aspect of the ultimate is a freedom from absolutely all elaboration such as production and nonproduction.This distinction concerning ultimate truth dates back to the early development of Madhyamaka thought in Buddhist India, with the master Bhavaviveka (also known as Bhavya):Bhavaviveka {Legs Idan 1b yed p a ) (sixth century) was the Madhyamika master retrospectively considered to be the originator o f the Svatantrika- Madhyamaka school, said to have been the abbot o f fifty monasteries in the region o f Dhanyakata, in South India. He excelled in debate and was the first to use the dialectical methods developed by Dignaga in a Madhyamaka con­text, which are found in his L a m p o f W isdom . He is also considered the first to make the distinction between a “nominal ultimate” (paryayaparam drtha, m a m g ra n g sp a ’i don da m ) and “non-nominal ultimate” {aparydyaparam drtha, m am g ra n g s m a y in p a ’i don d a m ), as found in his S u m m ary o f th e M ean in g o f the M id d le Way {M adhyam akarthasam graha, dB u m a ’i don bsdu spa). (Kong- trul, The Treasury o f K now ledge: Book Six, P art Three: Fram eworks o f B u d d h ist Philosophy, 380, n. 694)The primary source for the twofold presentation o f the ultimate seems to be Bhavavivekas S u m m ary o f the M ean in g o f M adh yam aka {M adh yam akarth a- sam graha, dB u m a ’i don bsdus p a ) and the third chapter o f his B la ze o f Reason­ing, in which texts he uses the terms “nominal ultimate” (paryayaparam drtha, m a m g ra n g sp a ’i don dam ) and “non-nominal ultimate” {aparydyaparam drtha, rnam grangs m a y in p a ’i don d a m ). (Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge:Book Six, P a rt Three: Fram eworks o f B u ddh ist Philosophy, 383, n. 714)Bhavavivekas treatment o f ultimate truth was as follows:Bhavya considered the important objection that since the ultimate truth tran­scends the discursive intellect, it follows that no verbal formulation can pos­sibly express it. How therefore is it possible even to talk about the two truths, distinguishing ultimate truth in opposition to the relative? If the ultimate cannot be talked about, how can it be distinguished from anything at all? In332. - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"NOTES- 333response, Bhavya draws a distinction between two kinds of ultimate truth.On the one hand, he says, there is the ultimate that is “world-transcending”{ jig rten las das p a ). This is the ultimate truth in itself, the completely inef­fable state beyond conceptual elaboration, which can only be experienced but never expressed. On the other hand, there is an ultimate that Bhavya describes as “pure worldly wisdom” [d a g p a 'jig rten p a ’i y e shes), which, in the con­text o f the division o f the two truths, is the counterpart o f the relative and is the object o f thought and word. It is “the ultimate that can be talked about.” These expressions run parallel to another, better-known distinction, which first appears in another text also attributed to Bhavya, between the “ultimate truth in itself” (m a m grangs m a y in p a ’i don da m ) and the “approximate ulti­mate” {m a m grangs p a ’i don d am ) or “concordant ultimate” {m thun p a i don d a m ). (Padmakara Translation Group, The A d o rn m en t o f the M id d le Way,11-12.)Rather than being an invention by Bhavaviveka and his followers, this distinction would seem to have been presaged in the sutras o f the Buddha himself:In his commentary on The O rn am en t o f the M id d le Way (a Svatantrika- oriented treatise by the Indian master Shantarakshita), Mipam Rinpoche notes, “The sutras sometimes teach the inconceivable and inexpressible uncategorized ultimate [i.e., m a m grangs m a y in pa'i don d a m ], free from all extremes o f existence, nonexistence, and so forth. At other times, their teach­ing is no form, no consciousness’, the categorized ultimate s [i.e., m a m grangs p a ’i don dam ] mere existential negation.” (Doctor, Speech o f D elight, 151)203. Concerning this distinction between two aspects o f ultimate truth, Longchen Rab- jam notes in The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 104-5:Proponents o f the Madhyamaka approach give the following analysis: Using the negation o f one part o f a conceptual elaboration as their rationale, they apply the term “quantifiable ultimate truth” to what is, in fact, ultimate truth as a particular aspect o f relative truth— that is, nonproduction [i.e., the nega­tion of production].They apply the term “unquantifiable ultimate truth” to the simple tran­scendence, in the ultimate sphere, of all such elaborations, since these can­not in any way be established in light o f their fundamentally unconditioned nature. Nevertheless, the Madhyamikas say that given this “freedom from all conceptual elaborations,” nothing can possibly be defined as some ultimate thing in its own right.204. The awareness referred to here is the timeless awareness experienced in formal medita­tion by spiritually advanced beings.205.

Because it is the domain o f timeless awareness, which is purified of the cognitive obscura­tions. [Vasubandhus commentary says] “because it is unerring”; this means “because it involves neither naïve affirmation nor denial.” In speaking of it being a cause, [Vasubandhus commentary says] “because it is not the basis for anything erroneous.” W hat is erroneous is ordinary conceptual thought; and since this is not the framework for ordinary conceptual thought, it is unerring.(3) [Vasubandhus commentary says] “because subde traits have ceased, it is ‘the absence o f subtle traits’.” Here the absence o f subtle traits means the cessation o f subtle traits. In order to present this point emphatically, [Vasu- bandhu’s commentary] here says “because a ll subtle traits are absent.” Since the emptiness o f all subtle traits o f being conditioned or unconditioned is empty, it is said to be “the absence of subtle traits.” Because all subde traits are absent, there is the absence o f subtle traits; the very fact that there are no subde traits constitutes the absence o f subde traits.(4) [Vasubandhus commentary says] “because it is the domain of the time­less awareness o f spiritually advanced beings, it is ‘the ultimate’.” The term “ultimate” in this case means timeless awareness that transcends the mundane sphere; the significance o f that awareness is what is ultimate.(5) [Vasubandhus commentary says] “since it is the cause of the qualities of spiritually advanced beings, it is ‘the basic space of phenomena’.” In this con­text the word “phenomena” means the qualities o f the spiritually advanced. It refers to authentic view and so forth, to authentic and complete freedom, and to all that pertains to timeless awareness. Since it is the cause of these, it is basic space. In order to demonstrate that point, [Vasubandhus commentary says] “because the qualities o f the spiritually advanced come about with this as their frame o f reference.” The term “realm” [as a synonym for “basic space”] is used also here, meaning that it upholds its own characteristics and its func­tion of serving as a causal factor.

One must gain a thor­ough understanding of this. An example is that o f water; that is to say, if the mind eliminates such factors as its form, the mind no longer entertains the idea o f “water.” These are entirely cases of things that are assigned labels on the relative level, but due to the circumstances of that relative level it is also entirely valid to say “Vases and water exist.” Given that these are not false statements, this is relative truth.Other than that, is what is ultimately true: anything diat, even if one attempts to dismande it, remains entirely something with which the mind still can engage; or anything that, once extraneous factors have been elimi­nated, remains something with which the mind still can engage. These things exist on the ultimate level. An example is something like a material form; that is to say, whether it is dismantled down to minute particles, or the mind has eliminated extraneous factors such as its taste, there remains the nature of “form” with which the mind still can engage. One should regard sensations and the rest [of the mind-body aggregates] in a similar way. Because these exist on the ultimate level, diey constitute “ultimate truth.”Masters in the past stated, “Whatever is constitutes a transcendent state o f consciousness, or whatever is perceived by a mundane state in die wake of such a consciousness, that is ultimately true.

So a thing having unique characteristics, genuine reality, and genuinely real; these are all synonyms from their perspective. Whereas something that is mere conceptual abstraction, something that has only general characteristics, something that is only apparendy real or relatively real, are all synonyms as well. If we define these; what is genuinely real means that it has its own unique characteris­tics independent of our concepts about whether those characteristics exist or not, the characteristics exist in the thing independent of what we think about it.” Gyamtso, The Two Truths, 11.“For example, if we think about a fire, then the actual thing that is there to which we give the name ‘fire’ is doing something; it has its own unique characteristics, unlike anything else.

These three principles are general tenets o f the Cittamatra school. Concerning the first principle, that o f imputation, Longchen Rabjam states the following:Imputation is here defined as the mind assigning and describing things in terms o f categories. If we analyze this, we find that there is “purely theoretical imputation,” which concerns things that may be perceived clearly but are non­existent (like the image o f two moons, which is nonexistent in actuality yet can be described in conventional terms), as well as things such as “identity.”In addition, there is “imputation involving categories,” which includes all manner o f systematic and detailed analyses, and all that can be labeled in terms o f letters, words, and phrases. These ways o f analyzing things— begin­ning with categories such as words and their underlying meaning, or the expressions o f meaning and the meaning thus expressed, up to and including categories such as the mind-body aggregates, the components o f perception, and so forth— are conceptual elaborations imposed by the ordinary mind.They are thus imputed, in that they serve as means to bring about understand-"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"NOTES- 341ing, without there necessarily being any connection between them and the objects being analyzed. Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f P h ilo- sophical System s, 8 3.For the Chittamatrins, imputation is a purely adventitious process. Some­thing that they say is “imputed” does not exist before a conceptual label is applied to it; in fact, it does not exist at all, even on the level o f conventional designations, let alone on the ultimate level. Ibid., 418, n. 163.245. According to Longchen Rabjam:Dependence has two aspects. First, “impure dependence” pertains to the myriad specific manifestations that constitute the animate and inanimate universe, arising because o f minds myriad habit patterns; these manifesta­tions include sense objects, perception, and one s physical embodiment. Here the term “sense objects” refers to the five kinds o f objects (visual forms and so forth). “Perception” refers to the eight avenues o f consciousness— that is, consciousness that is established as fields for sensory experience as a result of other conditions. “Physical embodiment” refers to the mind-body aggregates that perpetuate samsara. These manifestations are classified as dependent by virtue o f the fact that they are dependent on other conditions, namely, karma and habit patterns.Second, “pure dependence” pertains to utterly pure realms o f experience, aspects o f timeless awareness, and so forth. These are considered dependent in that they rely on circumstances that are conditioned by the power o f obscura­tions being purified. Ibid., 83-84.Dependence pertains to things that are empirically verifiable. Such things are substantially existent and are brought about through causes and conditions other than the things under discussion; they then serve as bases for imputa­tion and are aspects of the basis o f all ordinary experience. Ibid., 418, n. 165.246. Concerning the absolute in the Cittamâtra system, Longchen Rabjam notes the following:The absolute also has two aspects. First, there is “the unchanging absolute”— that is, the way of abiding, the ultimate ground o f all experience, the basic space o f phenomena that is utterly lucid by its very nature, “buddha nature.”. . . Second, “the unerring absolute” is the incorruptible spiritual path, together with its fruition, because one proceeds authentically and does not regress once the destination has been reached.

Therefore, if the metaphor being used does not refer to some “thing,” then the underlying meaning that it illustrates— mind itself, pure by nature— is not something that has ever existed in the slightest.

From the perspective o f the Madhyamaka school, even followers o f lower Buddhist schools of thought (Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, and Cittamatra) are philosophical mate­rialists, in that they accept that certain things have ultimate existence.302..

That is, the idea o f a “self” or “I” based on the clear impression o f the mind-body aggregates. The belief in this self as something with identity that is truly existent is a distorted and counterproductive form o f “intelligence” (Tib. shes rab lo g p d ).304. That is, ignorance and the belief in a “self” or “I” that has more than merely nominal validity.305. That is to say, initially there is ignorance, which is the lack o f recognition of the true nature o f things. This gives rise to belief in the reality o f the “I,” which in turn rein­forces the ignorance diat gave rise to it. This is not, however, a case of the belief produc- ing ignorance (like fire producing smoke), for once the false belief in the “I” has been eliminated, diere still remains some residual degree o f fundamental ignorance.306. That is, although the belief obscures direct experience o f the true nature o f things, it does not under the circumstances exert any influence at all on the mind, whether positive or negative.307.

That is, ignorance is a primary state o f mind, o f which the belief in identity is an attendant mental event.311. “Conditioned” (Tib. ’dus byas\\ Skt. sam skrta) implies that something is brought about by, or compounded from, causes and conditions, and hence not some unitary “thing” with an independent status o f its own.3 11.

W hy is this so?Because even those things that do not produce something would all, without exception, be alike in being “other” than it.317. These three properties are the traditional definition o f the identity that non-Bud- dhists ascribe to the “selff or “soul,” and other things, and that Buddhist philosophers argue is not tenable.318. That is, the approaches of the srivaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva.319. This is the last o f the ten books o f The Treasury o f K now ledge. See Kongtrul, The Trea­sury ofK now ledge: Books N in e a n d Ten : Journey a n d G oal, 253-451.3 20. That is, the Buddha Sâkyamuni.321. In this context, the srâvaka schools of the Vaibhâsika and Sautrântika.322. The term “endowed with the potential for all manifestation” implies that all positive qualities that pertain to the completely enlightened state o f buddhahood are present as naturally occurring attributes.323. That is, being impermanent, things that act as causes cease in the very moment before the results that are in accordance with those causes come about; for example, the ces­sation o f the seed is immediately followed by the outset of the seedling, for otherwise causes and results would be simultaneously present.324. There are numerous differing interpretations that fall within the general category o f Cittamâtra thought. As Kongtrul notes here, some Cittamâtra thinkers held that what is dependent (Tib.g zh a n dbang-, Skt. paratan tra) is truly existent, but the same principle would apply to those who felt that both what is imputed and what is depen­dent (according to their definitions of these terms) are not truly existent but that the absolute is. In either case, the extremes of naïve affirmation and nihilistic denial would be avoided from the point of view of the respective Cittamâtra proponents.325. Here Kongtrul is referring to those who profess unqualified emptiness (Tib. rang ston gpa).3 26. That is, the “buddha nature” innate in all beings (Tib. bde b a rg sh egspaisn yin gpo; Skt. sugatagarbha).3 27. The issue here hinges on the distinction between phenomena that come about due to causes and conditions that are other than themselves (Tib. gzh an byung) and that which is “naturally occurring” (Tib. rang byung\\ Skt. svayam bhu). The term for qualified emptiness (Tib .g zh a n stong, literally “empty o f other”) emphasizes this dis­tinction; since it does not depend on other causes and conditions, buddha nature is naturally occurring, as are its innate qualities, present as natural attributes. Buddha nature is “empty o f other” in the sense that it is em pty 0/phenomena that come about due to other causes and conditions but not empty o f what is naturally occurring.3 28. “True” (Tib. b d en p a ) in this context means “in accord with what is ultimately true.”329.

That is, all phenomena subsumed within samsara and nirvana.331. The phrase “what is commonly accepted in the ordinary mundane sphere” (Tib. ’ji g rten gragspa) refers to what “makes sense” in the light of conventional common sense, taking phenomena as they present themselves without examining or investigating them any further. Given that this discussion hinges on the principle o f one s conduct in the world, the perspective is that o f the relative level o f experience.332. That is, o f denying the nominal validity o f these phenomena.333. There are many phenomena associated with the totally refined state o f enlightenment that are nevertheless “tainted by causes o f confusion,” such as various kinds of medita­tive experiences and visions undergone on the spiritual path.334. That is, of investing these phenomena with an independent nature, or true existence in and of themselves. This is not the same status as that of the qualities o f enlightenment that indwell innately as natural attributes of the true nature o f mind.33$. That is, generosity, ethical discipline, patience, enthusiastic diligence, meditative sta­bility, and sublime intelligence.336. This is one o f the five major lines of reasoning employed in the Middle Way school to undermine the naive tendency o f the mind to regard phenomena as truly existing and bring one to an understanding o f the way in which things truly abide according to their ultimate nature. For Kongtruls discussion o f these five lines o f reasoning, see The Treasury o f K now ledge: Book Six, P a rt Three: Frameworks o f B u d d h ist Philosophy, 235-40 (including p. 235 for the line of reasoning in question here). In The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 108-11, Longchen Rabjam (who was one o f Kong- truls major sources in composing The Treasury o f K now ledge) provides a Nyingma interpretation o f these five arguments, including a detailed breakdown o f the reason­ing that things are free o f being either unitary or manifold (109-11). This line of reasoning investigates phenomena from the point o f view o f what they constitute in essence and demonstrates their emptiness as an avenue of experience that leads one to total liberation.337. That is, if one concludes that things are empty because they are proven to be through reasoning, emptiness then becomes the philosophical equivalent of a hammer that is used to smash a vase into shards, thus “proving” that the vase is empty o f any inde­pendent nature as “vase.” Here the consequence is being mistaken for the underlying reason: the smashing of the vase did not “make” it empty; rather, it could be smashed only because no “thing” called “vase” ever existed as such in the first place.338. The Tibetan term y u l is usually used in the sense o f the “object” in a dualistic object- subject situation, with the “subject” being termed j/«/ can (literally, “possessor o f the object”). In the present context o f a nondualistic view, for the purposes o f discussion, the language used to describe the situation nevertheless refers provisionally to sublime intelligence as a “quasi-subject” (Tib. y u l can) experiencing emptiness as its “quasi­object,” or scope. In actual fact, however, the experience is not one o f some “thing” being aware of some other “thing.”339. That is, emptiness as “what is the case” with respect to all things, not some other “thing” that is separate from them.340. The term translated here as “objects in the phenomenal world” (Tib. chos can-, Skt. d h a rm in )— rather than the more usual term \"phenomena” (Tib. chos-, Skt. d h a rm a )—"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"NOTES - 349is used in context to confine the discussion o f the various aspects of emptiness to the perspective of specific situations and aspects within the relative level of truth, rather than that o f what is ultimately true. Objects in the phenomenal world include every­thing that pertains to either the all-consuming afflictive state o f samsara or the totally refined state of nirvana.341. In Buddhist logic, there do exist separate terms for the factor that is to be negated (Tib. d gagbya) and that which provides the basis for such negation (Tib. d g a g g zh i). Certain trends within the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism place great emphasis on distinguishing between these two. They would frame the issue as follows: “A thing like a vase is not empty of being a vase (that is, the basis for the negation); it is empty of any true existence (that is, what is being negated).”For Kongtrul, however, and those whose writings he takes as his primary sources, there is no need to make such a distinction— in fact, to do so holds no real mean­ing. The eighth Karmapa, Mikyo Dorje, whom Kongtrul acknowledges as one of his principal sources in writing The Treasury o f K now ledge (see Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge: Books N in e a n d Ten: Journey a n d G oal, 463), used the analogy of gold ore being smelted; what is to be eliminated (the ordinary rock) is eliminated, while what is not to be eliminated (the gold) is what remains. Mikyo Dorje’s stance on unquali­fied emptiness would be: “The vase is empty o f being a vase” (that is, the basis for the negation is also that which is being negated).342. Traditional examples of such things are the horns of a hare, the child of a barren woman, or a flower growing in the sky. W hile such things can be imagined, they do not constitute possibilities that are “suitable to be objects of ordinary consciousness.”343. That is, emptiness.344. Candraklrti, Entrance to the M id d le W ay, chap. 6, v. 181, (Toh. 3861), Dg. T., dBu ma, vol. A, p. 4 2 5 ,1. 7 to p. 4 26,1. 1.34$. W hile no analysis is tenable from the point of view of the true nature o f phenomena (Tib. chos nyid\\ Skt. d h a rm a ta )t this analysis is from the- perspective of specific aspects of the phenomenal world (Tib. chos can\\ Skt. dh arm in ). The point o f such a thor­oughgoing analysis is to focus on fundamental components o f our total experience in order to eliminate any lingering trace in the mind that there is some “thing” whose true nature is n o t that of emptiness.346. That is, the true and ultimate nature of phenomena, which can be realized only by nonconceptual timeless awareness. The term “alternate reality’ (Tib.g z h a n g y i dngos p o ) is specific to the teachings in the Prajnaparamita sutras and the commentaries on these, such as Maitreya’s O rn am en t o f H igh er R ealization.347. Subhuti was one o f the ten main students of the Buddha Sakyamuni who were exem­plars o f the sravaka approach; he was considered the most excellent teacher of empti­ness, and so figures in the sutras as a principal interlocutor who requests and receives teachings on emptiness from the Buddha.348. In the source sutra, there are two further aspects o f emptiness (which are the two components o f the final aspect, treated as separate aspects) listed here: “emptiness of what has no substantiality, emptiness of the very essence of things.” This brings the number o f aspects to eighteen, which is a very common theme developed in the Prajnaparamita sutras.349.

The emptiness o f these refers to the fact that in none o f them is there an iota o f anything that exists as a permanent thing, or self, or something with identity that stands on its own.3$ 1. “External” refers to the six kinds o f sense objects (forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tac­tile and kinesthetic sensations, and objects o f the imagination), which are inanimate components in our experience, not imbued with consciousness. Again, the emptiness o f what is external refers to the fact that in none o f them is there anything that truly exists in and o f itself.352.. “What is external and internal” refers to the sense faculties and their respective objects. W hile the mind has the impression that “something exists” within the gen­eral situation o f a given faculty encountering its object, this is nothing more than a case o f one o f the six avenues o f ordinary consciousness functioning, without there being any substantial “thing.” In excluding the physical bases for the senses, Kongtrul is choosing to follow the interpretation found in the writings o f the eighth and ninth Karmapas; see Wangchuk Dorje, The K a rm a p a s M id d le W ay, 461:The tradition of the master Haribhadra asserts “outer and inner” as the fac­ulties and their [physical] supports. The explanation found here, however, follows the sutras.353. See ibid., 466:Other texts, such as D istinguishing the M id d le fro m the Extrem es, teach that the meaning of that quotation about the emptiness of the great refers to the environment o f the world. Here, however, Chandraklrti teaches in accor­dance with the M oth er sutras.Beyond the ten directions— all o f space— there are no worlds consistingo f environments and inhabitants Therefore, the ten directions are indeed“great.”354. That is, nirvana is the most sublime goal sought by spiritual practitioners and, in fact, that can be sought by any and all beings.35$. These are goal states that pertain particularly to the ¿ravaka and pratyekabuddha approaches. See Kongtrul, The Treasury o f K nowledge: Books N in e a n d Ten: Journey a n d Goal, 106-7 ^ d 109. In The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 140-2., Longchen Rabjam discusses these two alternatives in more detail, including the fol­lowing remarks:For arhats who experience residual traces, there remains a slight residue o f the truth o f suffering (since they have not yet eliminated the mind-body aggre­gates that perpetuate samsara) As for arhats who experience no such resid­ual traces, it is held that like a fire once its fuel is exhausted, they no longer have physical bodies when they attain nirvana, but their minds enter a realm o f cessation, a state o f pristine cognition in which ordinary mind has ceased.356. See Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge: Books N in e a n d Ten: Journey a n d Goal, 186: “[Nirvana as the natural state is] the suchness of phenomena . . . a state o f complete purity by its very nature.”"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"NOTES- 351357. See ibid.: “Nonlimited nirvana . . . does not fall into either extreme of conditioned existence or personal salvation.”358. Emptiness ofTvhat is conditioned refers to emptiness as the true nature o f any and all phenomena within the three realms o f samsara. Phenomena that come about due to causes and conditions, and therefore are produced by these, endure as long as they are in place and cease once those causes and conditions no longer pertain. Emptiness of what is unconditioned refers to the fact that, even if one conceives o f some uncondi­tioned phenomena— not dependent on causes and conditions and therefore free o f being produced, enduring, or ceasing— as being some “thing,” no such thing exists.359. An additional explanation o f “what is not to be discarded” is that this refers to the fact that there does not exist, in any ultimate sense, some finite essence of any phenom­enon that must not be discarded or eliminated. See Wangchuk Dorje, The K arm apas M id d le W ay, 470:W hat should not be discarded is not an object o f relinquishment and should in no way be abandoned. It is, rather, what should be adopted: the virtue of the two accumulations, such as generosity. Those very things that arc not to be discarded are empty o f what is not to be discarded. Therefore, this emptiness is called the emptiness of what is not to be discarded.360. That is,any and every phenomenon of samsara and nirvana, without a single exception.361.

That is, one (unacceptable) sense of “no frame o f reference” could be to say, “There is no elephant on top of this table”; there can be no frame of reference when there is no context to begin with.363. These are, respectively, the Transcendent Perfection o f Sublim e Intelligence in One H u n d red Thousand Verses and the Transcendent Perfection o f Sublim e Intelligence in Twenty-Five Thousand Verses.364.

Furthermore, that which is present in a transcendent context is alternate reality; because this is beyond samsara, it is known as “alternate reality,” that is, the furthest limit o f authenticity. Since this is not subject to change in any way, it is suchness itself, characterized as emptiness, and emptiness is emptiness as alternate reality.367. See n. 41.3 68. The interpretation o f qualified emptiness for the most part employs the Cittamatra model o f the three principles— the imputed, the dependent, and the absolute. It is for this reason that the proponents o f qualified emptiness can be, and often are, referred to as “Yogic Practitioners” (Yogacara), but the name needs to be understood in con­text; it can refer to the Cittamatra school, to the Yogacara-Svatantrika, or (as Kong­trul uses it here) to the proponents of qualified emptiness, since they all share this model o f the three principles in their explanations.369. Tib. gzh an gyis stong p a . This is the etymology for the termgzh a n stong (pron. zhen- tong; literally, “empty of other”), which I have translated as “qualified emptiness.” The idiom “empty o f” does not imply total absence or denial, only that while imputed and dependent phenomena can and do arise in one s experience, they do not truly exist as such in the very essence of the absolute. To say here that the basis for negation is empty o f the factors to be negated is not like saying that the table is empty o f there being an elephant standing on it— that is, that something simply “is not.” Rather, it is a case of saying that while things can and do manifest, in doing so they do not therefore exist as such. To claim otherwise would be to invalidate the primordial unity of manifest phenomena and their emptiness (“Form is emptiness, emptiness is form; other than form there is no emptiness, other than emptiness there is no form,” as die H ea rt Sutra puts it). Similarly, to state that the true nature of mind is “empty o f” adventitious distortions does not mean that these distortions do not occur, but that even as they occur the nature of mind is unaffected by them.370. See n. 161.371. That is, in the case of the individual personality, the perceived object is a seemingly existent “I” or self that is imputed on the basis o f the five mind-body aggregates; the perceiving subject is the minds fixation on that object as though it were something truly existent. In the case o f phenomena, the perceived objects are any and all seem­ingly existent phenomena that are included within the mind-body aggregates; the perceiving subject is the minds fixation on those as though they were truly existent things.371. Source not identified. Here Serdok Panchen, whose writings were much admired within the Kagyii school to which Kongtrul belonged, is in accord with that schools view that objects in the phenomenal world are “empty in and o f themselves” (that is, unqualified emptiness), while the true nature of phenomena is “empty o f other” (that is, qualified emptiness). The alternate view is the opposite: that objects in the phenomenal world are “empty o f other” (“A vase is not empty o f a vase, rather a vase is empty of being anything established to have true existence”), while the true nature o f phenomena is empty in and o f itself.373. Although the basic space o f phenomena is not subject to differentiation in its very essence, it can be provisionally analyzed with respect to specific situations.374.

Maitreya, D istinguishing C enter a n d L im it, chap. 1, v. 17, (Toh. 402.1), Dg. T., Sems tsam, vol. Phi, p. 81, lines 3-4. The Indian commentary by Vasubandhu (student of Asanga, who received the source text from Maitreya) on Maitreyas source text gives the following explanation (C om m entary on \"D istinguishing C enter a n d L im it,\" (Toh. 4017), Dg. T., Sems tsam, vol. Bi, p. 9, lines 1-3):In this regard, the passage begins with the emptiness of that which experi­ences, that is, the internal components o f the sense fields. As for the empti­ness of w h a t it experiences, this refers to the outer components. As for their body, this refers to the physical body, which is the context for both that which experiences and what it experiences; the emptiness of that is what is termed “emptiness o f what is external and internal.” The basisfor existence refers to the inanimate universe; because this is vast in extent, the emptiness o f it is what is termed “emptiness o f what is great.” If you wonder about how there is also such perception o f the internal components of the sense fields, it is through understanding emptiness; the emptiness of that is “emptiness of emptiness.”As for the emptiness o f w h at is perceived— that which is ultimate— this is “emptiness of what is ultimate.” As for why, this ensures the accomplishment of a bodhisattva, that is also emptiness.The verse thus references the first six of the fourteen aspects of emptiness.376. That is, the fifth and sixth aspects in the list o f fourteen given previously— emptiness of emptiness and emptiness of what is ultimate.377. That is, emptiness of what is conditioned, of what is unconditioned, of what is beyond limitations, o f what is without beginning or end, o f what is not to be discarded, of nature, o f characteristics, and of phenomena.378.

One might wonder, “If such is the case, what would the situation be in the basic space o f nirvana in which no residual trace o f the mind-body aggregates remains?” Although there would be no body due to the consequences o f cor­ruptible phenomena, the dharmakaya o f the incorruptible reality o f buddhas, transcendent and accomplished conquerors, would be uninterrupted in the basic space o f nirvana in which no residual trace of the mind-body aggregates remains. This is attested to in philosophical works. Therefore, the emptiness o f this is what is termed “emptiness o f what is not to be discarded.”382.. The Tibetan term rigs (here rendered “spiritual potential”) is a synonym for tathdgatagarbha, or “buddha nature.” According to Sthiramati, ibid., p. 4 3 1 ,1. 7 to p. 431, lines 1 and 3:As for the line because, moreover, th eir spiritu a l p o ten tia l becomes eviden t in its to ta l p u rity, the emptiness of this is the emptiness of nature.

Concerning the corresponding situa­tion according to the sravaka approach, Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 141, gives the following account:As for arhats who experience no such residual traces, it is held that like a fire once its fuel is exhausted, they no longer have physical bodies when they attain nirvana, but their minds enter a realm of cessation, a state of pristine cognition in which ordinary mind has ceased.The term n irvana here refers to the sravaka interpretation o f the term as personal salvation from suffering. W ith the arrest o f mind in the attainment of the state with­out residual traces, there is no longer any virtue (or nonvirtue) functioning. In the Mahayana context, the efforts a bodhisattva makes in spiritual practice ensure the continuity o f virtuous factors beyond the attainment of the state without residual traces.387. In the sravaka and pratyekabuddha approaches, an act is virtuous because of what motivates it; in the Mahayana approach, diere are actions that are virtuous by their very nature.388. That is, it is not the case that the potential is purified but rather that purely adventi­tious factors that obscure one s direct experience of it are removed, so chat it becomes fully evident as ever-present.389. Kongtrul discusses these marks in Book 10 of The Treasury o f Knowledge. See TIjc Treasury o f Know ledge: Books N in e a n d Ten: Journey a n d Goal, 313-28; see also Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 216-18.390.

That is, phenomena that come about due to causes and conditions other than them­selves (Tib. gzh a n byung), as distinct from what is naturally occurring (Tib. rang byung).396. See, by way of comparison, the citation from Serdok Panchen above, at the beginning o f the section on qualified emptiness.397. That is, the sixteenth and seventeenth aspects o f the eighteen aspects o f emptiness as set forth in the Prajriaparamita sutras.398. That is, a distinction is made between die imputation o f the individual and the rela­tively true phenomenon that is the basis for that imputation. The “factors o f the true nature o f reality” refer to the qualities o f enlightenment that are innately present as natural attributes o f the true nature o f mind.399. These are ways in which the mind digresses from an authentic perception o f the true nature o f things, by thinking in terms o f (1) nonexistence, (2) existence, (3) over­statement, (4) understatement, (5) single entities, (6) manifold entities, (7) finite essences, (8) particular features, (9) names being the things they refer to, and (10) things being the names that refer to them.

See Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge: Book Six, P art Three: Frameworks o f B u d ­d h ist Philosophy, 385, n. 723:Samkhyas (Calculators or Enumerators) (Grangs can p a ) are followers of the oldest o f the “orthodox” philosophical schools, that is, schools that take the Vedas as authoritative. The Vedic sage Kapila is traditionally said to be the founder o f the Samkhya school (though this is not verified), which also serves as the philosophical system for Patarijalis system of Yoga.In the Samkhya system, all things are subsumed within two categories, soul and primal matter. Primal matter, in turn, gives rise to ordinary consciousness or mind, leading to the conceit of self-identity, which then accounts for the manifestation of all that constitutes the material world. See Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 5 5-60. Here Kongtrul offers only the Samkhya interpretation as an example of non-Buddhist schools that accept the most obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phenomena; Tibetan accounts of non-Buddhist philosophy tended"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"358 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEto be limited to treatments o f other ancient Indian schools as critiqued (often rather cursorily) in the writings o f Indian Buddhist teachers.414. For the Sautrantika school, the material (Tib. rdzas\\ Skt. dravya) is defined as what is capable o f performing a function or being of use to a person on the ultimate level, and not simply something ascribed by language or imputed by conceptual thought— things such as forms, sounds, and so forth. By contrast, mental determinants (Tib. Idogpa-, Skt. apoha) are concepts that are based on the exclusion of everything that is not the thing itself—for example, a form that is perceived in the mind, such as the isolated form o f a vase that simply excludes everything “not-a-vase.”415. That is, a tenet held in common by both the Particularists and Followers o f the Sutras.416. Vasubandhu, Treasury o fA b h id h a rm a, chap. 6, v. 4a-c, (Toh. 4089), Dg. T., mNgon pa, vol.

Mental determinants are merely concepts that exclude everything that is not the thing that is the object of the concept.419. These are Cittamatrin thinkers “who assert that external referents do not exist as real entities and yet, owing to the habitual tendencies for conceiving [of appearances] as objects, cognition itself arises as the image of a referent, as in the analogy of a crystal with a color. Thus, everything that appears as forms is simply the mind itself, which is the agent for appearances {snang m khan) manifesting as distant cut-off objects (rgyangs chad kyi d on ) owing to the power of the deluded habitual tendencies. More­over, [appearances,] in fact, are real in being the mind, which is the perceived object. Therefore, the aggregates, constituents, sense spheres, and even true cessation (which is considered to be mind free from the factors to be abandoned), all o f which are taught in the sutras, are real in being mental phenomena, which is to say, they are [only] die mind itself.” Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge: Book Six, P a rt Three: Fram eworks o f B u ddhist Philosophy, 186-87.420. That is to say, these Mind Only proponents accept the nonexistence o f what is imputed but not that of what is dependent.421. That is, Vasubandhu.422. See Kongtrul, The Treasury o f K now ledge: Book Six, P a rt Three: Fram eworks o f B u d ­dh ist Philosophy, 209-11, where Kongtrul outlines these lines o f reasoning, which are used in both branches o f the Middle Way school— Svatantrika and Prasangika:In Madhyamaka reasonings, generally speaking, the evidence (linga, rtags) is presented in two ways:(1) by setting up negations {pratisheda, dgagpa), or(2) by setting up affirmations (v id d h i, sgru bpa).First: Negations(1) Negation through the analysis o f causes is called the “vajra sliver [reasoning].”(2) Negation by means o f analyzing results refutes the arising of [a result] existent [at the time o f its cause] and the arising of [a result that is] nonex­istent [at the time o f its cause].(3) Negation that employs the analysis o f both causes and their results refutes arising from the four possibilities."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"NOTES- 359(4) Negation that analyzes a nature [demonstrates that a phenomenon] is neither a single unit nor a plurality.The first type o f negation is taught in the Rice Seedling Sutra and the last kind is presented in the D escent into L a n k a Sutra. The two middle ones appear in certain sutras. These four eliminate the Realists’ inflated ascription o f inher­ent existence to things, thereby removing [their belief in] the extreme o f exis­tence. ...[Second: Affirmations]Affirmations are set up as evidence in the following way. The reasoning of dependent origination is an analysis o f mere appearances, and it is found in the Q uestions o f the N dga K in g A n avatapta Sutra.In Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f PhilosophicalSysterns, 108, Longchcn Rabjam presents these five in a slightly different order:These five can be understood to conform to four models. The argument known as “vajra shards” is a refutation that examines the causes o f any object to be refuted. The argument called “the refutation of the production and ces­sation o f what is existent or nonexistent” is a refutation that examines the results. The argument called “the refutation of production in any o f four ways” is a refutation that examines both the causes and results. As for refu­tations that examine something in its essence, the argument known as “the supreme principle of interdependent connection” is one of establishing a line o f reasoning that involves a qualified negation, and that called “freedom from being unitary or manifold entities” is one of establishing a line o f reasoning that involves an unqualified negation.He goes on (ibid., 109-1 o) to present each in more detail, and later (ibid., r 20-23) examines the particular way in which they are used in the Prasahgika approach.423.

As Kongtrul notes, even followers o f lower Buddhist schools of thought have self- imposed limitations on their ability to investigate the true nature o f things. It is only by evolving beyond those limitations of reasoning and inquiry that a given individual can truly embrace the Middle Way perspective.426. That is, identity in the individual is a particular subset o f the greater issue of identity in phenomena; for the latter to be completely realized, the former must also be.427.

Because the Followers o f the Sutras (Sautrantika) school is generally considered to be a more advanced system than that of the Particularist (Vaibhasika) school.437. That is, one on a more obvious level (which they establish on the basis o f external objects) and the other on a more subtle level (which they establish on the basis o f the internal mind).438. That is, the mind and the internal aspects of the sense fields; the “agent” being negated is the concept of a permanent, unitary, autonomous self as posited by non-Buddhist schools o f thought.439. That is, irreducible particles o f matter and irreducible moments o f consciousness, without which (according to the systems o f the Particularists and the Followers of the Sutras) the universe as we experience could not be the case, and on the basis of which they establish the lack o f identity in the individual and the nonexistence of phenomena on the coarse, obvious level. The Mahayana schools (Cittamatra and Madhyamaka) reject the notions o f these irreducible particles and moments existing ultimately.440. Both material and mental “things” pertain to the internal level, which includes not only the minds experience o f the external world but the body and its sense organs as the supports for that experience. Only material “things” are required to account for the external inanimate world.441. That is, with respect to realizing the lack of identity in the individual, the Middle Way and Mind Only schools are identical.442. That is, at any given point the sense o f “I” may be associated with the physical body (the aggregate o f forms)— “I am hungry”— a sensation, a perception, a volitional state, or some aspect o f consciousness. The mistaken assumption is that the “I” is the same entity in all situations, rather than a misperception that fixates on any given fac­tor among the aggregates as its object depending on the circumstances.44 3. This is a reference to a way o f analyzing the relative level of truth from the Autonomist(Svatantrika) perspective; see Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge: Book Six, P art Three: Frameworks o f B u ddh ist Philosophy, 221:Svatantrikas classify conventionalities as being either correct conventionali­ties {yang da g k u n rdzob) or mistaken conventionalities {lo g p a ’ik u n rd zo b):"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"NOTES- 361(1) a correct conventionality is whatever is capable o f performing a function that is consistent with the way it appears [to its corresponding cognizer]; and (2.) a mistaken conventionality is whatever cannot perform a function consis­tent with its appearance.See also Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 103:If we analyze relative truth, we find that it also has two aspects.

That is, the Buddha.445. That is, the beliefs that the “I” or “self” is identical with one or another of the five mind-body aggregates.446. Nagarjuna, L etter to a Friend, v. 49, (Toh. 4182), Dg.

See Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge: Book Six, P a rt Three: Frameworks o f B u d ­d h ist Philosophy, 240:The sevenfold reasoning [that uses the analogy of] a chariot proves the absence o f a self o f persons. The jEntrance [to the M id d le Way) states:A chariot is not considered to be other than its parts.It is not identical [with them,] nor does it possess them.It is not in its parts, nor are the parts within it.It is not the mere assembly nor the overall shape.In addition to the fivefold [analysis that begins with seeing that] a char­iot is not something other than its parts (such as the nails), [Chandraklrti] examines the collection [of parts] and the overall shape [of the chariot]. If we investigate [a chariot] using this sevenfold analysis, we will not find that it is the parts themselves nor will we find that it is something other than those [parts]. Similarly, if we look for a self using this sevenfold analysis, we will not find that it is something other than the aggregates nor will we find that it is the aggregates themselves. In this [analysis o f the chariot], the overall shape and the collection are refuted implicitly, since they cannot be found apart from that which has the shape {dbyibs can) or that which is the collection (tshogspa can).This reasoning is also found in the Theravada tradition o f Buddhism; see Rhys Davids, The Q uestions o f K in g M ilin d a :And the venerable Nagasena said to Milinda the king: “H ow then did you come, on foot, or in a chariot?”“I did not come, Sir, on fo o t. I came in a carriage.”“Then if you came, Sire, in a carriage, explain to me what that is. Is it the pole that is the chariot?”“I did not say that.”“Is it the axle that is the chariot?”“Certainly not.”\"Is it the wheels, or the framework, or the ropes, or the yoke, or the spokes of the wheels, or the goad, that are the chariot?”"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEAnd to all these he still answered no.“Then is it all these parts of it that are the chariot?”“No, Sir.”“But is there anything outside them that is the chariot?”And still he answered no.“Then thus, ask as I may, I can discover no chariot. Chariot is a mere empty sound. W hat then is the chariot you say you came in ? It is a falsehood that your Majesty has spoken, an untruth! There is no such thing as a chariot!You are king over all India, a mighty monarch. O f whom then are you afraid that you speak untruth?” And he called upon the Yonakas and the brethren to witness, saying: “Milinda the king here has said that he came by carriage.But when asked in that case to explain what the carriage was, he is unable to establish what he averred. Is it, forsooth, possible to approve him in that?”W hen he had thus spoken the five hundred Yonakas shouted their applause, and said to the king: “Now let your Majesty get out of that if you can?”And Milinda the king replied to Nagasena, and said: “I have spoken no untruth, reverend Sir. It is on account o f its having all these things— the pole, and the axle, the wheels, and the framework, the ropes, the yoke, the spokes, and the goad— that it comes under the generally understood term, the designation in common use, o f ‘chariot’.”“Very good! Your Majesty has righdy grasped the meaning o f chariot’. And just even so it is on account o f ail those things you questioned me about— the thirty-two kinds o f organic matter in a human body, and the five constituent elements o f being— that I come under the generally understood term, the designation in common use, o f ‘Nigasena’. For it was said, Sire, by our Sister Va^ira in the presence of the Blessed One: ‘Just as it is by the condition precedent o f the co-existence o f its various parts that the word “chariot” is used, just so is it that when the Skandhas are there we talk o f a “being.”’”“Most wonderful, Nagasena, and most strange. Well has the puzzle put to you, most difficult though it was, been solved. Were the Buddha himself here he would approve your answer. Well done, well done, Nagasena!”One early school o f Buddhism in India, the Vatsiputriya, accepted the existence o fan “indescribable self”; see Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f PhilosophicalSystem s, 68-69:As to the system o f the Vacsiputriyas (Followers of Vatsiputra),. . . Vatsipu- tra then asked the Buddha whether the individual self is the same as the mind-body aggregates, or distinct from them, or both, or neither. The Bud­dha’s answer was to say nothing at all, which Vatsiputra interpreted to mean that the self does exist but is indescribable. Although he had embraced the dharma, he accepted the existence o f an indescribable self, for his view was tainted by a form o f extremism.The source texts o f this system maintain that the entity o f the self is the agent that carries out all positive and negative actions, experiences the results (whether desired or not), which are its own creations, and casts off the mind- body aggregates of one life and takes up those of the next. They hold that this self is not eternal, because former lives are left behind and later ones are taken up. However, they also maintain that it is not impermanent, because"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"NOTES - 363the self chat has committed actions in this life has already experienced doing so, and the self in a future life will still experience the results o f those actions, which it did not commit. These two selves in fact constitute a single self.It is this self that experiences the playing out o f karmic results, which are thereby “exhausted,” but will continue to experience those that are “not yet exhausted.” The Vatsiputriyas hold that since the agent receiving, or undergo­ing, the experience is the same as the self, it cannot be impermanent. There­fore, they say that “self” is what exists as one s sense o f identity, not describable in any way whatsoever, as eternal or impermanent.Their position is not a sound one. In fact, it is untenable, because their refutation o f this “self” being some permanent thing does not constitute proof chat it is some impermanent thing; their refutation o f its being some impermanent thing depends on the proof o f its being some permanent thing.And how is it possible for something to be neither eternal nor impermanent?449.

Kamalaslla wrote three texts all entided Stages o f M editation-, these are gener­ally referred to as the “first,” “intermediate,” and “final (or third)” versions. W hile Kongtrul cites this passage as being from the first version of Stages o f M editation , it is actually from the intermediate version.451. The definition o f a “substantial thing” (Tib. dngos po) is something that is capable of performing a function. Nonsubstantial phenomena (such as space) cannot perform functions.452. Nagarjuna, Source Verses on Sublim e Intelligence, chap. 18, v. 1, (Toh. 3824), Dg. T., dBu ma, vol. Tsa, p. 20 ,1. 6.453. That is, the function o f consciousness that is aware o f perception taking place. For example, when visual consciousness (which is nonconceptual) sees a flower, it is the reflexive function o f consciousness that is aware that seeing is taking place, making a connection between nonconceptual visual consciousness and conceptual conscious­ness, which knows, “I am seeing a flower.”454. Valid inference is the process of arriving at some conclusion upon seeing some kind of evidence that leads one inevitably to that conclusion, thus revealing some conclusion that was formerly hidden. Examples are those of seeing smoke and inferring that there is a fire, or seeing waterfowl and inferring that there is a body of water nearby. Kong­trul is maintaining that no truly valid process o f inference could definitively prove the existence o f a self, or an identity in the individual.4$ $. In Buddhist epistemology, for a state of cognition to be a valid one (Tib. tsbad ma-, Skt. pra m a n a ), it must meet criteria o f being either a valid form o f direct experience, or a valid state o f deductive inference, or based upon scriptural authority from some authentic source. Inference is valid only when it meets very specific criteria; the fact that the self “feels like it exists” due to deeply entrenched patterns o f habituation does not constitute a valid inference, or intuition, that such is the case.456. In the sutras, the terms “brahmin” and “spiritual practitioner” are used to refer to indi­viduals who espouse spiritual values, but whose understanding is still immature.

Ibid., w . 16c—22 (p. 84,1. 4 to p. 8 5 ,1. 2).464. There are eighteen such components. Six are external components— visual forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tactile sensations, and mental phenomena (this category includes the three aggregates o f sensations, perceptions, and formative factors; indiscernible forms; and all unconditioned phenomena). Six are internal components— the facul­ties o f vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and the mental faculty that coordinates sense data and creates ideas concerning what is perceived. Six are components that are based on consciousness— visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile conscious­ness, and the coordinating function o f mind.465. In any given perceptual or cognitive act, some external component functions as the support, the corresponding internal component provides the frame o f reference, and the corresponding components based on consciousness are the supported factor; for example, when a visual form is seen, the form (external) is the support, the visual fac­ulty provides the frame o f reference, and the visual consciousness is what is supported in the situation. It is, therefore, these components that function as the causes of our ordinary experience, not some “self.”466. O f these twelve constituents, six are internal (the faculties of vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and mental coordination and imagination), and six are external (the sense objects o f forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tactile sensations, and mental phenomena). The term translated here as “sense field” (Tib. skye m ched; Skt. a yatan a) is defined as that which functions like a cause, or avenue, for the arising (skye) and augmenta­tion (m ched) o f some avenue o f consciousness, such as visual consciousness. Again, no existent “self” is required to account for the sum total of ordinary experience, only the interaction between these twelve constituents.467.

One o f the ten powers o f a buddha is that of “knowing what is or is not in accord with the nature o f diings,” such as knowledge o f the fact that karma and afflictive states are the causes of an ordinary being, not a self or creator god; or knowledge o f the fact that virtuous actions lead to higher states o f rebirth, not lower ones. The fact that such situations arc the case proves that no self exists as something that could control an outcome.468. A governing condition (Tib. b d a g p o i rkyen\\ Skt. adhipatipratyaya) is one that exerts a primary controlling influence over some result coming about; for example, the sen­sory faculties act as governing conditions that contribute to the occurrence of their respective kinds o f consciousness.469. The “faculties” referred to here are twenty-two in number. Seven serve as bases for consciousness (the five physical sense faculties, the coordinating mental faculty, and the faculty o f life force); two serve as further determinants o f experience (the male and female sexual organs); five serve as vehicles for sensation (the two physical sensa­tions o f pleasure and pain, the two mental sensations of well-being and suffering, and the neutral state of experience); five are faculties that contribute to the totally refined state o f enlightenment (faith, enthusiastic diligence, mindfulness, meditative absorp­tion, and sublime intelligence); and three are faculties that are found in the makeup of those who are spiritually advanced beings (the faculty that brings all-knowing awareness, the faculty of all-knowing awareness, and the faculty endowed with all­knowing awareness). Concerning the latter three faculties, see Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Know ledge: Books N in e a n d Ten: Journey a n d G oal, 104-$ and 577, notes 230-32.470. Knowledge o f the various spiritual approaches to enlightenment brings an aware­ness that the qualities associated with these approaches manifest as a result o f the processes themselves, not due to ones “making them happen.” This undermines the tendency toward the spiritual pride of identifying oneself.as a practitioner, a tendency that undermines the effectiveness o f ones chosen path to negate the mistaken belief in ones individual identity as something real and absolute and to allow die innate qualities of one s true nature to manifest.471. That is, the belief that some self exists, which previously was not free but that “becomes” free at a later point in time.472. For a commentary on these verses by Mipam Rinpochd o f the Nyingma school, see Dharmachakra Translation Committee, M id d le B eyond Extrem es, 84-101. Mipam Rinpoch6 (1846-1912) structured one o f his most famous works (Tib.. m K has pa la ju g p a i sgo) entirely on the theme o f these ten ways o f becoming learned; see Mipham Rinpoche, G ateway to K now ledge, vols. 1-3.473.

W hile the term used here (Tib. ngo bo-, Skt., svabhdva) can refer in other contexts to the true and ultimate nature of reality (as in “all phenomena are, in essence, empti­ness”), here it refers to that which makes a given phenomenon what it is, as distinct from all other phenomena; for example, the “essential quality” of fire is to be hot and burning, that o f water to be wet and moistening.482. This is one o f the many traditional descriptions of things used in teaching logic and debate in Tibetan monastic institutions.483. See Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 109-10:[This] argument, that o f freedom from anything being a unitary or manifold entity, can be understood through a threefold process: establishing a line of reasoning, proving the properties o f the subject under discussion, and exam­ining the validity o f die argument by ascertaining what is entailed. The first step in the process is described as follows: Something that is o f necessity free of being a unitary or manifold entity is necessarily devoid o f any attribute of true existence, as is the case, for example, with a generic idea, which is not a real entity. Specifically, although things manifest as they do, this necessarily entails their freedom from being unitary or manifold entities in die ultimate sense.484. Ibid., 109:[This ] argument is as follows: Something that is devoid o f the status o f being a single result from a single cause, a multiple result from a single cause, a single result from multiple causes, or a multiple result from multiple causes is utterly devoid o f the status o f being a real entity that is actually produced, as is the case, for example, with a generic idea, which is not a real entity. Specifically, although things manifest as they do, they are devoid o f the status of beingpro- duced in any of four alternative ways: whether o f one thing being produced from another thing; o f many things being produced from one thing, o f many things being produced from many things, or of one thing being produced from many things.485.

This ordinarily refers to a branch o f the Autonomist school o f the Middle Way, which on the relative level accepts consciousness as a mere convention but docs not accept external objects. In this context, however, Kongtrul is using the term to refer to the consummate view o f qualified emptiness (zhentong).489.

That is, the true nature o f everything— ordinary beings, buddhas, and all phenom­ena— is not some substantial thing that is subject to change. Different terms (such as “tathagatagarbha” and “buddhahood”) are used purely as conventions to refer to different contexts.494. The three phases are the impure phase (the state o f an ordinary being, in which karma, afflictive mental states, and other adventitious factors temporarily obscure the ever­present buddha nature), the partially pure phase (the state o f bodhisattvas, who have removed these obscurations to some degree and have thus gained partial access to the experience o f this ultimate nature), and the utterly pure phase (the state o f buddhas, in which all obscurations have been removed and the buddha nature is expressed in full evidence).495.

That is, the Buddha Sakyamuni and the future buddha Maitreya.501. That is to say, the fact that the buddha nature is present and has the qualities it docs is not enough to allow one to experience it directly simply by intellectually appreciating that presence and those qualities.502. That is, bodhisattvas on either the path o f seeing (which corresponds to the first of the ten levels of realization) or the path of meditation (the second through the tenth levels); see ibid., 81-100 and 107-27.503. This is due to the truly inconceivable quality o f the buddha nature, which cannot be fully fathomed or embraced by ordinary rational consciousness. Even though ever­present in ordinary beings, under ordinary circumstances buddha nature does not carry out its “function”— that is, is not experienced as enlightenment— and even though it is innately endowed with, for example, the ten strengths o f buddhahood, it has no power in and o f itself to dispel the distortions that obscure its presence.5 04.

That is, the tradition o f Nâgàrjuna— who is regarded as the consummate interpreter o f the unqualified interpretation of emptiness (rang stong) in the Consequcntialist branch o f the Middle Way school— is more short-term (that is, applicable to the spiri­tual path), more obvious, and oriented toward investigating externals and putting an end to concepts regarding them. The tradition of Asariga—who is regarded as the consummate interpreter o f the qualified interpretation of emptiness (gzhan stong) in the school o f Middle Way Yogic Practitioners— is more far-reaching (that is, appli­cable to the fruition state), more subtle, and oriented toward internal investigation and the ultimate point o f meditation.506. Gargyi Wangpo Chôkyi Wangchuk (Gar gyi dbang po chos kyi dbang phyug, 15 84- 1630) was the sixth Zhamar incarnation o f the Karma Kagyii lineage, student of the ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorjé (dBang phyug rdo rje, 1556-1603 ?), and tutor of the tenth Karmapa Choying Dorjé (Chos dbyings rdo rje, 1604-1674). Noted for his erudition, he authored works that arc still important sources, especially on the “six yogic practices o f Nâropa” (Tib. N d ro chos drug).507. That is, India.508. That is, in the secret mantra approach o f Vajrayâna (the “esoteric” branch of the Mahâyâna approach) as compared to the equivalent aspect in the Pâramitàyâna (the “exoteric” branch). W hile the terms “subjective aspect” (Tib.y u l can) and “objective aspect” (Tib.jyul) are employed, in this context these are pure conventions to facilitate understanding on the level o f ordinary language and concepts. The consummate view o f both branches o f the Mahâyâna is that of nondual timeless awareness; nevertheless, one can provisionally speak of the subjective aspect (timeless awareness) being “aware o f” the objective aspect (emptiness).509. That is, the Pàramitâyâna.51 o. This is a reference to a traditional method of divination, in which the diviner beholds visions arising on the surface o f a mirror, without the usual process of causes and con­ditions to account for these manifestations, which are termed “expressions of empti­ness” (Tib. stonggzugs).5 il. Sakya Pandita Künga Gyaltsen (Saskya pandi taKun dga rgyal mtshan, 1182-1251) was perhaps the most learned master of the Sakya school o f Tibetan Buddhism, whose writings have served as a basis for the schools view, termed “the inseparability o f samsâra and nirvâna” (Tib. ‘khor das dbyer m ed).512. Kongtrul is obliquely implying that Sakya Pandita accepted the latter point, in that he did not specifically or explicitly refute it in his writings.513. That is, (1) the elimination o f origination, (2) the elimination of cessation, (3) profun­dity, and (4) lucidity.514. The Tibetan term for Middle Way is dbu m a, which some translators render as “Cen­trist”; the same term is used in Vajrayâna contexts to refer to the central subtle chan­nel. Thus, the central channel is a particular expression in Vajrayâna contexts of the “central principle” of the greater Mahâyâna.515. The Sanskrit term avadh u ti, used untranslated by Tibetans, is another term for the central subtle channel:The term a va d h ü ti can be translated as deriving from avadh ü n oti, which means “banishing the harmful effects o f actions.” It can also be translated as “eliminating duality,” or “shaking everything off.” Kongtrul, The Treasury o f K now ledge: Books N in e a n d Ten: Journey a n d Goal, 181."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"370- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE516. These are techniques in the practice o f the stage o f development according to the Kálacakra cycle. Once one has visualized a deity and the attendant features, such as the mandala and mansion, and maintained the visualization during a session of meditation, the entire visualization is mentally dissolved into a formless state of medi­tation, either all at once (instantaneous dissolution) or step by step (gradual dissolu­tion). This dissolution technique is a powerful means o f directing the mind toward a realization o f the emptiness o f all phenomena.$ 17. A reference to a model found in Vajrayána teachings, which involves four factors:(1) the ground for the refinement process (Tib. sbyang g z h i), which is a way o f refer­ring to the buddha nature that is primordially present as a natural attribute in all beings, comparable to a flawless wish-granting gem with many facets (representing the manifold qualities innately present in the buddha nature as natural attributes);(1) the factors that are to be refined away (Tib. sbyang bya), which are all the adventi­tious distortions, both subtle and more obvious, that obscure the ground o f being, which are comparable to a layer o f mud that covers the gem without in any way affect­ing or diminishing it;(3) the factors that effect the refinement process (Tib sbyong byed), which are the techniques employed in the two stages of Vajrayána practice (the stage o f develop­ment and the stage of completion), which are comparable to the water and cleansing substance used to remove the superficial layer o f mud; and(4) the result o f the refinement process (Tib. sbyangs 'bras), which is the context in which the qualities of enlightenment, innately present in the ground o f being, have become fully evident once the adventitious distortions have been refined away, com­parable to the revealing o f the gem once the mud has been removed, so that it can function as the answer to all one’s wishes.518. Jamyang Chokyi Nangwa (’Jam dbyangs chos kyi snang ba) is another name for the sixth Zhamar Gargyi Wangpo Chokyi Wangchuk (1584-1630). The title “vajra of enlightened speech” refers to the successive Zhamar incarnations being considered emanations.of the buddha Amitábha, associated with the padma, or lotus, family and the principle o f enlightened speech. The “crown marked with light” is a reference to the formal red crown o f the Zhamarpas. The reference to “the north” is to Tibet, which lies to the north o f India, the historical home o f Buddhism.519. That is, as white as a conch shell.510. That is, sublime intelligence that derives from hearing, contemplating, and meditat­ing on teachings.511.

Implicic in this statement is Kongtruls deeply held belief drat indulging in intolerant sectarian biases constitutes nothing less than a rejection o f the Buddhas teachings.523.

There are five such acts: parricide, matricide, killing an arhat, causing a schism in the Buddhist spiritual community, or causing physical injury to a buddha.

The fourth through sixth periods, known as the “time of accomplishment,” are marked by emphasis on the attainment o f profound insight, meditative absorption, and ethical discipline, respectively. The seventh through ninth periods, known as the “time of scriptural transmission,” are marked by emphasis on the abhidharma, sütra, and vinaya teachings, respectively.

In the traditional cosmology o f the Buddhist Abhidharma teachings, human beings occupy four “continents” in our (and every other) world system.

O f these, '‘failing” refers to all moral failings without excep­tion occurring due to deeply ingrained afflictive mental states. “Origination” refers to that which leads to experience in the realm o f desire, or to lower states of rebirth. “Psychological makeup” refers to any conduct due to desire and attachment and so forth, or any states that are not associated with com­plete nirvana, that occur when one is in the prime o f life, with all ones facul­ties fully developed. “Focus” refers to someone who serves as a guru being the point of reference, or someone or something imbued with positive qualities being the point o f reference, or any situation in which one should not be involved being the point of reference. “Deeply ingrained motivation” refers to deeply ingrained patterns o f afflictive mental states overwhelming and com­pletely controlling one’s mind, such that one’s physical and verbal actions are completely influenced. “Consummation” refers to whatever by its very nature constitutes ones predominant pattern; in its initial stages, this can be elimi­nated by a relatively small antidote.In the discussion that follows of the factors that give weight to a specific action, Kongtrul employs somewhat different terminology and explanations.$65. The three emotional poisons are those o f attachment, aversion, or ignorance. See Nagarjuna, Precious Garland, chap. 1, v. 19, (Toh. 4158), Dg. T., sPrin yig, vol.

The most common traditional model for the states of ordinary beings in samsara is of six kinds of beings— hell beings, pretas, animals, human being, demigods, and gods.

Here Kongtrul is paraphrasing the content o f Nagarjunas Letter to a Friend (w . 6 6 -7 6 in particular), rather than citing specific passages; see Kangyur Rinpoche, Nagarjunas “Letter to a Friend” with Commentary by Kangyur Rinpoche, 123-28.586. See, for example, an account concerning one o f the Buddhas main disciples, Katya- yana, in Patrul Rinpoche, The Words o f M y Perfect Teacher, 50-51:One day while the Arhat Katyayana was out on his alms-round he came across a man with a child on his lap. The man was eating a fish with great relish, and throwing stones at a bitch that was trying to get at the bones. W hat the master saw with his clairvoyance, however, was this. The fish had been the man’s own father in that very lifetime, and the bitch had been his mother. An enemy he had killed in a past existence had been reborn as his son, as the karmic repay­ment for the life the man had taken. Katyayana cried out:He eats his father s flesh, he beats his mother off,He dandles on his lap the enemy drat he killed;The wife is gnawing at her husbands bones.I laugh to see what happens in samsaras show!587. That is, pass from this life.588. That is, pretas.589. That is, the human state. Kongtrul actually cites the line as reading: “For humans, there is also...”590. That is, a relentless process of suffering. Vasubandhu, Advice fo r the M ultitude, w . 17-18, (Toh. 4166), Dg. T., sPrin yig, vol. Ge, p. 347, lines 4 - 5.591.

O f these, for those who are the highest placed— with vast wealth, o f good family, possessed of enormous desires— it is difficult for them to attain the enormous things they obsess about. Therefore, they feel intense jealousy and cannot find what they desire, which causes them inescapable mental suffering. On the other hand, lowly ones— those o f ignoble family, with the poorest o f diets and beds and dwellings and clothing— are overwhelmed by suffering on the physical level.Thus, how can there be any chance o f real happiness for anyone? Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, these two kinds o f suffering bring destruction to the entire world each and every day.593. Although gods in the realm of desire experience great pleasure during their extremely long lifetimes, they experience intense and demoralizing suffering toward the end of their lives as they see indications o f their impending demise and fall into lower states o f great suffering; see Nagarjuna, L etter to a Friend, w . 9 9 -1 00b, (Toh. 4181), Dg. T., sPrin yig, vol.

That is, in their battle with the demigods. Although gods can be healed of their wounds with the nectar that is found in their world, they still undergo pain when those wounds are inflicted.595. That is, the realms o f form and formlessness.596. That is, the higher trainings in ethical discipline, meditative stability, and sublime intelligence. The entire text o f The Treasury o f Knowledge began as a treatise on these three higher trainings.597. For if they reverted to higher states of rebirth in samsara, they would eventually fall again into lower ones.$98. Cluster o f Stems, (Toh. 44), Dg. K., Phal chen, vol. A, p. 618,1. 1.599. The distinction here is between the specific cause, also called the “direct cause” (Tib. dngos rgyu), o f a specific result (such as die grain o f barley for the barley seedling) and other contributing causes, also called “indirect causes” (Tib. brgyud rgyu), that are needed but not essential for the specific result to occur.600. That is, enlightenment as defined in the sravaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva approaches; see Kongtrul, The Treasury o f Knowledge: Books N ine and Ten: Journey and Goal, 285-87.601.

The point o f the analogy is, o f course, that bodhicitta is the specific cause o f the enlightenment o f buddhahood, while the realization o f some degree o f emptiness is the common cause o f ail corresponding degrees of enlightenment. W hile Kongtrul s analogy has been translated here as given in his original text, it is obviously a product o f a patriarchal culture that, without the benefits o f modern genetics, accepted the assumption (found in many ancient cultures, and in Aristotelian thought, for exam­ple) that the mother played a passive role in conception, being simply the receptacle for the fathers sperm, which alone determined the sex (or even the life itself) o f the child. A more accurate analogy might be that the father is responsible for the sex of the child, while the mother bears all children in common, regardless o f gender.603.

In the source, the last two lines read slighdy differently than as cited by Kongtrul:The path to liberation is one only— you; thus, it is certain that there is no other.604. For example, the three longest versions o f the Prajñápáramitá sütras are referred to by Tibetans as the “Extensive M other” (Tib. Yum rgyas p a ), the “Middle-Length Mother” (Tib. Yum ‘b rin g p o ), and the “Concise Mother” (Tib. Yum bsdu spa).605. That is, the Bengali master Atlia Dipamkara Sríjñána (982?-1054?), who was argu­ably the single most important figure in the introduction to Tibet o f teachings on the cultivation o f bodhicitta. His Tibetan students founded the famous Kadampa school o f Tibetan Buddhism, whose teachings are found in all Tibetan schools surviving to modern times.606. Atisas principal Tibetan student was the layman Dromtón Gyalwai Jungné (’Brom ston rGyal ba’i ’byunggnas, 1004/5 -1064), who in turn had three main students— the “three spiritual brothers” Potowa Rinchen Sal (Po to ba Rin chen gsal, 1027-1105), Chen-ngawa Tsui trim Bar (sPyan snga ba Tshul khrims ’bar, 1033/38-1103), and Puchungwa Shónnu Gyaitsen (Phu chung ba gZhon nu rgyal mtshan, 103 1-1106). Sharawa Yonten Drak (Sha ra ba Yon tan grags, 1070-1141) was a student of Potowa, and it was Sharawas student Tumton Lodró Drak (gTuin ston bLo gros grags, 1106- 1166) who codified the five-stage method o f arousing bodhicitta; he is also credited with founding the monastery o f Narthang, which became the source o f an important edition o f the Kangyur andTengyur collections. See Roerich, The B lue A nnals, 282.607. The Tibetan term for “mental training” (bio sbyong) refers specifically to these and other processes o f arousing and cultivating bodhicitta, all based on the teachings of Atlia, whose impact on the future development o f the Tibetan Buddhist tradition was enormous.608. Jayulwa Shónnu Ó (Bya yul ba gZhon nu od, 1075-1138) was a student o f Chen- ngawa Tsultrim Bar. Jayulwas principal student was Tsangpa Dorjé Mikyó (gTsang pa rDo rje mi bskyod, 1077-1161), who succeeded to the abbatial throne o f Jayul monastery after his masters passing. See ibid., 292-97.609. The Tibetan termy id d u on gba (literally meaning “appealing to ones mind”) implies that bodhisattvas feel connected to others, can empathize with their suffering, and feel inspired to relieve it. Everyone can feel compassion to a limited extent, but the resulting sense of being emotionally overwhelmed or incapacitated in the face o f that suffering hinders the development of the “supreme compassion” that leads to bodhi-"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"NOTES- 379citta.

The term “corruptible” (Tib. zagbcas-, Skt. dsrdvin) refers to situations that are still based on conceptual consciousness, and thus susceptible to the onset o f afflictive men­tal states.614. That is, one confers virtue as the cause o f happiness, rather than merely the happiness that is the result o f virtue.61$. That is, sutras such as the Ten Levels o f Realization and the Garland o f Buddhas, which emphasize the principle of sublime intelligence. Kamalaslla develops this theme in the intermediate version of Stages o f M editation, (Toh. 3916), Dg. T., dBu ma, vol. Ki, (see especially p. 84,1. 5 to p. 87,1. 2).616. Kamalaslla, Stages o f M editation, (Toh. 3915), Dg. T., dBu ma, vol. Ki, p. 4 6 ,1. 7 to p.47,1- 1.617. The enlightenment attained by Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas entails their personal liberation from the sufferings o f samsara but limited insight into the true nature of things and limited ability to benefit others. The supreme enlightenment of buddha- hood, attainable only through the Mahayana approach, entails both liberation and omniscience, as well as an infinite capacity to benefit others.618. There are two factors that obscure the true nature o f ones being, preventing access to, and direct experience of, that nature. They are the afflictive obscurations (that is, thought patterns and emotional responses based on afflictive mental states, which hinder the attainment o f liberation from suffering) and the cognitive obscurations (that is, thought patterns based on dualistic consciousness, which hinder the attain­ment o f omniscience).619.

See KungaTenpai Nyima, “A Lamp on the Path to Liberation”:Through familiarization with such a one-pointed mind o f the desire realm, your body and mind become attuned. This is termed “thorough pliancy.” The mind, being mastered like a well-disciplined horse, can be placed at will in any positive state. Your mind experiences a sense o f well-being, for it is com­pletely freed o f any potential for future negative states such as the unhappi­ness that comes from anxiety and other factors. By the power o f this mental well-being, a finely attuned energy moves through your body. Your body is free o f heaviness and other impediments to its functioning which contain some potential for future negative states. Your spinal column feels like a stack o f golden coins, while your body feels light as a ball o f cotton. You feel as though your body were flooded throughout by a warm flow o f milk, as this sense o f well-being brings pliancy o f the body, which can function at will in positive activities. Such pliancy is coarse at first, growing progressively more subtle. From these initial coarse and subtle phases, eventually this pliancy clearly becomes total. W hile the coarse phase of pliancy distracts the mind, gradually the strength of this distraction weakens, and a subtle phase o f pli­ancy sets in, light as a shadow, serving to complement unwavering meditative absorption. This is termed “calm abiding that is included within the stages of meditative stability.” This process ensures that any meditative technique you employ— the stage o f development, the stage o f completion, or whatever— becomes authentic.636.

The general principle for a pervasive focus is that o f focusing in some way (conceptual or otherwise) on the true nature that pervades all phenomena.656. The focus on the limit o f things in their multiplicity involves the understanding that all that is knowable is subsumed within, for example, the model o f the four truths o f spiritually advanced beings (the truths o f suffering, the origins o f suffering, the cessation o f suffering, and the path to that cessation), the model o f the mind-body aggregates, and so forth; the “limit” is the realization one has that nothing knowable lies outside the limits o f these models. The focus on the limit o f things from the per­spective o f their true nature just as it is involves the understanding that all phenomena are emptiness by their very nature, and that nothing lies beyond the limit o f this fact.657. That is, having first analyzed things on the relative level, one then investigates the significance o f their being empty, lacking identity, and so forth.658. That is, from the perspective o f the fruition o f calm abiding, one s mind has relied on all the frameworks o f calm abiding, become familiar with them, and carried them out over and over. This effects a transformation that eliminates the tendencies in one that perpetuate ignoble states o f existence.659. In each case, the point is one o f counterbalancing the existing pattern by applying an antidote, not o f veering to the other extreme. To meditate on what is unattractive is simply a means to undermine one s obsessive desires, not to make one, for example, a misogynist or a misandrist.6 6 0. That is, knowledge that accords with the nature o f things— for example, the fact that ordinary beings are born as a result o f karma and afflictive mental states, and not as a result o f a soul, or creator god, and so forth; or that virtuous action leads to higher states o f rebirth, while nonvirtuous action leads to lower states.661. That is, calm abiding associated with any o f the levels o f the realm o f form; by com­parison with one another, each succeeding level is more subtle (“higher”) than the last, while each previous level is more coarse (“lower”) than the next.662. See Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical System s, 131-32:W hat are these sixteen topics? Four concern the truth o f suffering: imperma­nence, suffering, emptiness, and the lack o f identity. Four concern the univer­sal origin o f suffering: the fact that all things in essence have causes, that these causes are the universal origin o f suffering, that they are produced relentlessly, and that they are perpetuated by conditions. Four concern the cessation of suffering: cessation, peace, the ideal situation, and disengagement. Four con­cern the path: the path itself, the logic o f this process, the proven attainment to which it leads, and the certainty of release.Concerning the “four truths,” see Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f P h il­osophical Systems, 392, n. 27:"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"NOTES - 383A term more accurate than “the four noble truths” might be “the four truths of spiritually advanced beings.” They are not truths that are evident to ordinary beings, but are seen to be so by those who are spiritually advanced, i.e., who have attained the path o f seeing in any o f the three approaches of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, or bodhisattvas.663. That is, the context in which all sense o f some object and the subjective perceiver thereof falls away; this ushers in the experience o f profound insight, although it does not constitute such insight.664.

It thus provides a support for all aspects o f the karmic process— both the complete maturation o f its natural consequences and the potentials— and is aware o f the essential qualities o f the objects o f one s expe­rience (that is, the aspect o f any given phenomenon that serves as a basis for its specific characteristics).669. The term translated here as “mainstream sources” (Tib. gzhung) refers primarily to the texts found in the sdstra tradition o f Indian Buddhism; the explanations in these sources can be extensive, often exhaustive. More streamlined presentations are found in texts called “personal advice” (Tib. gdams ngag), in which learned masters have synthesized and condensed the material found in the mainstream sources into a more accessible and practical format. This streamlining approach finds its culmination in the “pith instructions” (Tib. man ngag), which are extremely concise statements that in few words sum up the main principles o f the subject matter. Such instructions, however, are often most useful only once one has some familiarity with the more extensive background material; otherwise, too concise a presentation can lead to one coming to flawed conclusions and making “snap judgments.”670.

They focus on the elimination of factors in ones makeup that obscure the true nature o f mind and its innate qualities, so that these powers are not so much gained as they are revealed. In the Buddhist tradition, such powers are seen as natural by-products o f ones growing realization, not as ends in themselves; one must guard against them becoming distractions or means o f self-aggrandizement.671. The Tibetan term le lo, usually translated as “laziness,” is here rendered as “faint­heartedness” in an attempt to include all three aspects o f le lo, only one o f which corresponds to die English word “lazy.” Faintheartedness in general is defined as a secondary afflictive state that undermines one s enthusiasm for what is virtuous and spiritually productive. “Lethargy” refers to the inability to exert oneself diligently due to an addiction to pleasure. “Obsession with ignoble activities” is obviously an impediment to virtuous endeavor, and equally obviously not laziness, in that one could be extremely busy with such activities and thus fainthearted at pursuing virtue. “Diffidence” is faintheartedness in the sense that one feels inadequate and unable to make progress in spiritual practice.673. That is, the failure to apply a remedial technique when appropriate.674. This enumeration is found in the first version o f the text; see Kamalaslla, Stages of Meditation, (Toh. 3915), Dg. T., dBu ma, vol. Ki, p. 6 3 ,1. 4:In brief, there are six flaws that affect all states o f meditative absorption: faintheartedness, forgetting the focus, mental laxity, mental agitation, lack o f effort, and [too much] effort.The identical passage is found in the final version o f the text; see Kamalaslla, Stages of Meditation, (Toh. 3917), Dg. T., dBu ma, vol. Ki, p. 118,1. 5.675. In the foregoing citation from Distinguishing Center and Limit, the context refers to intention; remaining within that, to effort; cause, to confidence; and effect, to pliancy. See KungaTenpai Nyima, “A Lamp on the Path to Liberation”:These are the intention to seek meditative absorption purposefully, the effort to persevere in that absorption, the confidence that comes from seeing the positive qualities o f that absorption, and the pliancy that results from that perseverance. O f these, the intention is the context for meditative absorp­tion, perseverance is remaining within that context, confidence is the cause of the intention, and pliancy is the result of perseverance. Among these, the principal factor is perseverance.676. See, for example, ibid.:Among these flaws, you should recognize the two extremes o f laxity and agita­tion to be the principal faults to be avoided. In the case o f laxity, reduce the quantity o f food you eat before a session o f meditation, sit on an elevated seat with a thin cushion, recite prayers o f refuge and supplication in a loud voice, and meditate with your body held erect. In the case o f agitation, die oppo­site methods will eliminate the problem. Once laxity and agitation have been pacified, meditate in a relaxed state.677.

In the same way, the power o f mindfulness with respect to the directing o f the mind ensures that it concentrates effectively and does not indulge in distraction, and so causes it to setde in a concentrated manner and to settle more intimately. Then, the power o f alertness ensures that the mind is not stirred toward the traces o f concepts or afflictive mental states, and so causes it to be guided and pacified. The power o f diligence ensures that the occurrence o f either o f these is not encouraged, and causes ones ongoing experience to be one-pointed.The power of thorough familiarization brings about the state o f meditative absorption.One should understand that these nine steps o f settling the mind involve four attitudes— those o f involvement with tension, involvement with occa­sional interruption, involvement without occasional interruption, and effort­less involvement.That is to say, in the mind’s settling and setding authentically, there is the attendant attitude of involvement with tension.

As well, when one arises from meditation, one s mind and body are sometimes endowed with thorough pliancy. Things that are in accord with the foregoing should be understood to be indications that one is imbued with this state o f mental engagement [that is, a stable degree of calm abiding].690. The Tibetan term yid byed (“[state of] mental engagement”) here refers specifically to the state o f stable calm abiding. In the current context, as long as one is an ordinary mortal (that is, one who has not yet attained the path o f seeing), calm abiding and profound insight are “mental events,” which is to say, attendant functions o f the ordi­nary mind. Once one has attained the path of seeing (and thus has become a spiritu­ally advanced being), these both become ones primary state o f mind.691. Kamalaslla, Stages o f Meditation, (Toh. 3915), Dg.

In the Kagyii, Nyingma, and Sakya schools, generally speaking this is regarded as an error, in that any and all deliberate focus must be allowed to subside for the authentic experience of the true nature o f things to ensue.

Zhen pa bzhi bral), a teaching imparted by the bodhisattva Manju^ri to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (Sa chen Kun dga’ snyingpo, 1091-1158), the founder o f the Sakya school: “If there is deliberate appre­hension, this is not the view.” (Tib. dzinpayod na Ita ba min).714. Forms that arise in the mind may be those that are based on sense perceptions of external objects (that is, that “accord with external circumstances”), or those that are entirely products o f the imagination. Both kinds o f forms can be objects o f ones dis­cerning intelligence, although investigation o f forms based on externals is not to be undertaken deliberately in meditation that is to develop profound insight.715. The preliminary phase is one o f coming to a definitive conclusion, through the exer­cise o f sublime intelligence, that the object in question has no independent nature; this leads to the main point of meditation— the direct experience o f that lack of inde­pendent nature.716.

The usual progression (Tib. lugs ’byung) o f the “twelve links” o f interdependent con­nection accounts for the way in which samsara is perpetuated; the reversal of this process (Tib. lugs Idog) is the key to liberation. These links are a particular topic of contemplation in the pratyekabuddha approach. See Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Systems, 144-4 5:The twelve links of interdependent connection are as follows:Ignorance, karmic patterning, consciousness, the mind-body complex, the six fields o f experience, contact, sensation, compulsion, perpetuation, becoming, birth, and aging and death: these are the twelve links of interdependent connection.Here ignorance means a fundamental lack of understanding. Because of it, beings continually fall into samsara, whereby karmic patterning occurs. This leads to consciousness, in that overt consciousness emerges from the basis o f each beings ordinary experience. From consciousness arises the mind- body complex, consisting o f the five mind-body aggregates— that is, the four aggregates o f mind (which include each individual being s aggregates o f sen­sation, perception, and formative factors) and the physical form on which these depend. On that basis, the six fields of experience— visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and conceptual— develop. This leads to contact, which is the coming together of three factors: objects, faculties, and mental focus. This leads to sensation, in that it produces sensations that are pleasant,"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"painful, or neutral. This leads to compulsion, in that the mind takes objects to be its own, rejecting or accepting them according to various responses of attraction, aversion, and so forth. This leads to perpetuation, in that yearning arises for what is desired and one takes this as a goal. This leads to becoming, with conception talcing place in a womb in the next lifetime. This leads to birth— the birth of the physical body. This leads to aging as youth fades, and then to death as one s life force comes to an end.

Both idioms refer to the way in which one experiences (“tastes”) phenomena from the perspective o f their ultimate nature.751. That is, sublime intelligence that derives from hearing spiritual teachings, contemplat­ing them, and meditating on them.751. The source verses o f The Treasury o f Knowledge, as well as those verses as cited in the commentary, both read “existence” (Tib. sridpa), but the prose commentary itself reads “isolation” (Tib. sring ba), which accords with Vasubandhu, Explanation o f the “Treasury of Abhidharma,”(Toh. 4090), Dg. T., mNgon pa, vol. Khu, p. x3, lines 5-6:If one wonders, “H ow does someone who strives intendy at meditation per­fect that meditation,” the source text states:W ith twofold isolation ...If one isolates oneself physically and mentally in order to distance oneself from busyness and nonvirtuous thoughts, meditation will become perfected.753. These are the seeking of gain, fame, praise, and pleasure, and the attempts to avoid loss, notoriety, blame, and pain.754. O f these seven kinds of ordination, two pertain to the householder situation (the ordination o f a male or female lay practitioner), while five pertain to a monastic situ­ation (those o f a fully ordained monk or nun, a novice monk or nun, or a female aspi­rant). The vows o f a female aspirant are an intermediate step between the ordination o f a novice nun and full ordination; there is no corresponding ordination for men.

That which derives from meditation focuses entirely on the mean­ing; it engages the meaning without relying on the letter. They give the anal­ogy o f someone who has not learned to swim well having to be pulled along in the water without swimming at all, while sorpeone who has learned to a small degree can occasionally swim while occasionally having to be pulled along. Someone who has learned thoroughly can cross the water without having to be pulled along. They are known for stating that this is the analogy.Others say, concerning this understanding, that whatever focuses on the words is that which derives from hearing, while whatever focuses on the meaning is that which derives from meditation, so that sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation cannot be established [as focusing on both words and meaning]. They say, rather, that sublime intelligence that derives from hearing constitutes the certainty that develops from authoritative and reliable scriptural sources; that which derives from contemplation constitutes that which develops from convincing examinations through reasoning; and that which develops from meditation constitutes that which develops from meditative absorption. It is my opinion that these characterizations are not without merit.756. Nagarjuna, L e tte r to a F riend, v. 29, (Toh. 4182), Dg. T., sPriri yig, vol. Nge, p. 83,1. 3.

For the Particularise school o f the ¿rávaka approach, what is ultimately real are irre­ducible particles of matter and indivisible moments o f consciousness. This view is not accepted by other, higher schools o f Buddhist thought.766. That is, sensations, mind, and mental states as the focus for the application o f mindfulness.767. These formative factors, which are posited by proponents o f the schools o f the Par- ticularists and the Followers o f the Sütras in the srávaka approach, are considered distinct from the other three “bases of the knowable”: forms, mind, and mental states. See Longchen Rabjam, The Precious Treasury o f Philosophical Schools, 408, n. 90:These are factors that have no congruence (of time, etc.) with mind or men­tal states, yet are evident in certain situations. The Vaibhashikas accept that these patterns are substantial entities. In The Treasury o f A bh idh arm a, . . . Vasubandhus fourteen factors are acquisition, nonacquisition, equality, the meditative stability o f cessation, the meditative stability o f a trance state, the trance state itself, the faculty o f life force, production, deterioration, dura­tion, impermanence, groups o f words, groups o f phrases, and groups o f let­ters. Asangas list of twenty-four [in his Com pendium o f A bh idh arm a] adds the following factors: the ordinary state of being, continuity, differentiation, connectedness, speed, sequence, time, location, number, and grouping.768. Such forms are considered by the sravaka schools to be o f two kinds. “Forms associ­ated with the sense field of subjective consciousness” are forms that exist within the realm o f ideas, such as atomic particles (as hypothetical conceptual models) or dream images. “Indiscernible material forms” are experienced only subjectively by one s own consciousness and are indiscernible by others; they include various kinds o f vows and ordination, which are held to contribute a subtle material component to the makeup o f one taking and upholding them.769. Unconditioned (or uncompounded) phenomena are things within ones ordinary experience that are not brought about through causes and conditions and thus are not subject to origination, location, and cessation. See Longchen Rabjam, The P re­cious Treasury o f Philosophical Schools, 73, 77, and 9$:There are three uncompounded phenomena: space (that is, the absence of any tactile sensation), the cessation o f consciousness owing to discernment (an absence that comes about through the application o f an antidote), and the cessation o f consciousness independent o f discernment (in which something does not happen, because its necessary conditions are incomplete). For the Vaibhashikas, what is incorruptible are these three uncompounded phenom­ena, plus consciousness as the coordinating mental faculty when it is focused on the truth of the path, as well as all that is associated with that conscious­ness. Everything else is corruptible___For the Sautrantikas, the three types o f uncompounded phenomena do not exist as substantial entities, for they are as utterly nonexistent as the sono f a barren woman___W ith respect to the group o f uncompounded phenomena, the Chittama- trins are in agreement with the Sautrantikas.

Bi, p. $57,1. 4 to p. 558,1. 7:H ow is it that these are remedies to counterproductive influences? It is because, according to the source text, they are successively:remedies to counterproductive influencesthat involve afflictive states, secondary afflictive states, and mastery.O f these, the remedy in the first case is what is termed “authentic effort.”The first kind o f counterproductive influence is that o f afflictive states that are to be eliminated through meditation; their remedy is authentic effort. H ow is this the case? [W hen Vasubandhu says,] “By that,” he means that this is due to one meditating on the path with authentic effort. Diligence that is in the context o f meditative absorption free o f mental laxity or agitation and that is subsumed within authentic view is authentic effort. Because meditation using that brings about the elimination of afflictive states (which are to be elimi­nated), one meditates with that remedy on the path. Therefore, given that one is practicing to accomplish authentic meditative absorption, authentic effort is termed the “remedy in the first case.”For one who is meditating on the path, the second case is that o f secondary afflictive states— characterized as mental laxity and agitation— to which what is termed “authentic mindfulness” is applied as what is termed the “remedy.”H ow it this so? [Vasubandhu says,] \"Because the causes o f calm abiding and so forth are due to an extremely intimate association with mindfulness, since mental laxity and agitation are absent therein.” (The phrase “and so forth” should be understood to mean that this is also the cause o f total attcntiveness and the cause o f impartiality.)In this regard, since this ensures that the causes o f distraction are thor­oughly pacified, there is calm abiding. The “causes o f calm abiding” refer to the efficient causes that bring about calm abiding and so forth. In this regard, should one s mind become agitated, or threaten to become agitated, to focus one s mind on something that arouses a feeling o f disenchantment is a cause o f calm abiding. Should one s mind become lax, or threaten to become lax, to focus one s mind on something that inspires joy is a cause o f total attentive­ness. W hether a case o f one s focusing uniquely on calm abiding, or focus­ing uniquely on profound insight, or engaging in their integration, these two secondary afflictive states constitute the “secondary afflictive states,” and so to focus ones mind on a sense o f being spontaneously present is the cause o f impartiality.As to what constitutes a counterproductive influence (with respect to one s"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"NOTES - 397gaining mastery o f such things as powers o f deeper discernment, which are by nature qualities o f enlightenment), it is a state o f ignorance that is not an overt afflictive state, but which by its nature constitutes an obscuration that interferes with meditative equipoise. This is the third case, to which authentic meditative absorption is applied as what is termed its “remedy.” H ow is this the case? Because [as Vasubandhu says,] “it ensures that, when one is abid­ing in meditative stability, such qualities o f enlightenment as deeper levels of discernment become fully evident.” Meditative stability is the context that ensures that all special qualities become fully evident. That being the case, in becoming a supportive influence for the actual accomplishment o f such quali­ties as deeper levels o f discernment, this constitutes the remedy for obscura­tions chat interfere with meditative equipoise.The foregoing being the case, authentic effort thus demonstrates a free­dom from the obscuring influence of afflictive states; authentic mindfulness ensures that meditative absorption is completely pure; and authentic medita­tive absorption ensures that there is freedom from obscurations that interfere with meditative equipoise.790.
