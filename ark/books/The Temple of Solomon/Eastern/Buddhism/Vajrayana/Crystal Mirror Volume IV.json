[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CRYSTAL MIRROR Volume IV"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A Word from Tarthang Tulku fOR MANY CENTURIES, the pure teachings of the Buddha have alleviated much suffering in the world. So in the past year it has been encouraging to see many more people become interested in studying the Dharma. The Dharma is not just a series of doctrines and practices, but a way of life-a learning process that encompasses every possible situation. Buddha's teaching emerges from his own expe-rience of being human. But we often are blinded by our own confusion, frustration and struggling. We are afraid, or we feel trapped by our karma. The fascinated mind chases after sensations which glitter like rainbows, but we must realize that all grasping is insatiable and futile. Studying the Dharma means to look at ourselves honestly, with complete openness-not as we would like co be or should be, but just as we are. Our lives are precious and time is precious, so use this present situation, whatever it is, to feel more positive, more balanced, and to live harmoniously with others. The Dharma is vast and often quite subtle. It cannot be evaluated or appreciated without a will-ingness and openness co study. We are not trying to escape this world, but thoroughly examining our participation in it. By analyzing the contents and limitations of our own mind, we can gain a knowl-edge and understanding which no one will ever be able to take away. With sincere study comes clarity and certainty, a broad, healthy point of view, and the solution co doubt and confusion. The Dharma be-comes our refuge, our protection, our own home. The essence of Buddhist teachings can best be understood by internalizing the meaning-not by searching and evaluating from the outside. Over time, the effects and significance of Buddhist prac-tices change and dee~ as our minds and hearts become more open. Knowledge is as infinite as the scars in the sky, yet the most valuable, the most useful, the most reliable knowledge is knowledge of our own mind. This is the lasting gift of the Dharma. The Vajrayana teachings are the highest expres-sion of Buddhisr theory and practice. All aspects of our present situation can be used to understand the mind's true nature. With proper self-acceptance and self-nurturing, we can learn to heal ourselves, and then to encourage others. The ancient transmission of the Vajrayana includes a wide range of approaches, such as philosophy, psychology, meditation, and rit-ual practices. All of these topics are vast subjects. In this volume of Crystal Mirror we are only beginning to lay the foundation for study and practice. Once we have a useful understanding of the basic teachings, once we have directly experienced the inner free-dom that is possible, then further study will come naturally. Since the Vajrayana expresses the understanding of the Nyingma lineage, we are presenting the early history of Buddhism in Tibet, as well as the life story of Padmasambhava and short biographies of his twenty-five disciples, who were responsible for the early continuation and spread of the Tantric teach-ings in Tibet. These articles are not meant to be scholarly, but include what I can remember from my own study, the words of my teachers, and some research with my students. Few materials are avail-able for srudy, so in the future we hope to present a comprehensive survey of Buddhism in Tibet. I hope this volume of Crystal Mirror will help to make your life easier and give you greater insight into your own process of growth and health. I especially appreciate the encouragement and help of my wife Nazli, the students who collaborated with me in editing the various manuscripts, and everyone at Dharma Press for their hard work and dedication to the preservation of the Nyingma teachings. May the blessing of Lord Buddha and the Lotus-born Guru inspire you with strength, under-standing, and compassion, and may the lineage of Nyingma masters bring you to full enlightenment in the Dharma.

But eight years from now, in the midst of an immaculately pure lake in the northwest land of Ut/.t/.iyana, one will appear who is wiser and more powerful than myself. Born from the center of a lotus blossom, he will be known· as Padmasambhava and will reveal the teachings of the Secret Mantras to deliver all beings from misery.\" YE-SHEY Tso-GYAL, Padma Thang Yig Padmasambhava, the renowned saint and scholar of the eighth century, became a central figure in the shaping of Buddhism's history in Ti-bet. Born from the lotus of compassion and revered as the 'second Buddha', he entered this world to enlighten all beings. As his biog-raphy relates, Padmasambhava is the manifestation of the mind of Avalokitdvara, the speech of Amitabha, and the body of Sakyamuni Buddha. All the Buddhas of the Ten Directions and the Three Times of past, present and future are identical in essence and unitively embodied in Padmasambhava.Just as the Buddha's teaching is the same for all but is interpreted variously by those on different stages of the spiritual path, so Padmasambhava appears in different ways according to the receptivity of those seeking liberation. This account of Padmasambhava's life story operates on many levels. While his origins as well as various episodes in his career are"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4 History shrouded in mystery, we know that he appeared on this earth as a great seeker and integrator of the Vajrayana teachings. In worldly matters, such as language, logic, the earth sciences, the fine arts, and even architecture, Padmasambhava was the quintessence of a true • renaissance man'. In his travels, he exhaustively mastered the teachings of human and 'non-human' guides, practiced austerities to subdue the demons of cupidity-attachment, aversion-hatred and bewilderment-erring, received numerous initiations and appellations, and, at the time of his invitation co Tiber, was renow~ed as the foremost scholar and Tantric master at the University of Nalanda. Upon his arrival in Tibet, he did not entertain obstacles but instantly transmuted countless manifestations of negativ-ity and, in a shore time, safeguarded the Tan eric teachings in the hearts and minds of the Tibetan people. In the grandeur of the mountain highlands, Padmasambhava en-countered numerous capricious spirits, personifications of the emo-tional undercurrent of the entire Tibetan civilization. At once he was faced with the prevailing powers of primitive mythic beliefs, hostile natural forces and wrathful wielders of destructive magic. His first task, therefore, was to provide new explanations for ancient u'nder-standings and to demonstrate, in a skillful and unsullied manner, the deepest and most mystic aspects of human existence. He could nor ignore the pre-existing Tibetan predilection for magic and the world of spirits, for Buddhism has always recognized chat demonic or godlike forms are the expression of our own minds. To subdue wrathful spirits is co tame our own emotionality, and thus the very obstacles to our spiritual progress. To some therefore, the magical aces performed by Padmasambhava may appear co be an ostentatious display of his psychic accomplishments. However, his miraculous aces were in actuality a pretense for something else. By encountering these malevolent demons, he not only transformed their hostile displays into an energetic appre-ciation for the Dharma, but entrusted to their charge the responsibility of protecting and safeguarding the sacred teachings. Similarly, his words and deeds sene a shaft of fear into the minds of the Tibetans and stirred them with hope, offering co the king and his subjects a dramatic opportunity to express their confidence in him. In this way he carefully prepared them to receive the liberating teachings of the Tantras. Until they sought out the truth in their own minds, the Guru illustrated that they would remain helpless against the demons who inflicted wrath upon the country. As the dispeller of darkness and the immediate expression of Buddhahood, Guru Rinpoche addresses himself to the consciousness"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The lift and liberation of Padmasambhava 5 of all beings. More implicitly, episodes in Padmasambhava's biography express meditation experiences through events in the outer world. To some, for example, he may appear as the wrathful deity, Dorje Drolo, fearlessly treading underfoot the ever-deceptive ego and severing karmic entanglements by wielding his three-edged dagger (phur-bu). To others he appears as the central figure of a radiant Mat;~qala, an all-discerning friend, refuge and inner guide. By subduing the self-created demons and fascinations of our individual predispositions, he lays bare the appari-tional nature of all selfish aims and exposes the mind as utterly pure and ready to receive any content without bias. He challenges every manifes-tation of negativity with an attitude that each situation in life, regardless of its outward appearance, can prove to be an instruction in truth. If, in the course of Guru Rinpoche's biography, certain episodes seem ambiguous or are couched in metaphorical language, it is because the essential meaning is revealed in silence, beneath the level of specific language, such chat one is left co measure and test the authenticity of his own psychological insights from within the meditation. On the most inner level, Padmasambhava is not intended to be viewed as a mere historical figure having a psycho-somatic constitution just like ours, for he is no ordinary being. He is like a rainbow-pure, transparent, untouchable and dear. He is all-knowing and all beauty -the Buddhas of the Three Times shine from the pores of his skin. His. entire form is pure light in a world of absolute perfection. He sics on a locus seat of compassion and a sun throne of highest wisdom which resides in the heart of the meditator. From here, the illuminated mind of the Guru fills the Ten Directions of space like the rays of the sun, the embodiment of the Tri-kaya: his view is all-embracing, absolute aware-ness (Dharmakaya), his thoughts are in perfect actunement with every situation, self-lucent (Sambhogakaya), and all his actions the on-going expression of the very nature of the universe (Nirmat;~akaya). Timeless, ageless and deathless, unoriginated, not dependent on externals and without suffering, he manifests through a variety of forms which he assumes at various times-and in this time-to teach theDiamond Path. Constant and mindful meditation on the pure essence of the Guru destroys all selfish desires, inappropriate qualities and unnecessary delu-sions, so that one learns co view every situation as the means to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. Ordinarily, the mind is diffused and wandering, but when this meditation is properly enacted, every form which one sees becomes the body of Padmasambhava, every sound which one hears, the speech of Padmasambhava, and all action, the mind of Padmasambhava."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"JN THE LAND OF Uqqiyana1 lived a wealthy king named Indra-bhiiti. He was a compassionate king who in times past had freely given his wealth-and even his eyesight-for the welfare of his people. Upon the death of his only son and heir, he was filled with overwhelming sorrow, for famine and drought afflicted the land, the royal treasury was exhausted, and the people were forced to eat unripened grain and flowers. Making offerings of all their possessions, the King and his people prayed to the immortal Buddhas. A valokitdvara saw all this from the Sukhavati heaven, and ap-pealed to the Adibuddha of primordial awareness, Amit:ibha-from whom all Buddhas emanate-to witness the people's suffering with compassion. Immediately there went forth from Amit:ibha's tongue a ray of red light, which, like a meteor, entered the center of the Dhanakosa Lake where a locus blossom spontaneously unfolded. Simultaneously, he emitted from his heart the mantric syllable HRi which fell in the shape of a golden dorje into the center of the lotus. There, in a mist of rainbow light, sat the essence of all Buddhas in the appearance of an eight-year-old boy, who was surrounded by pakinis.2 Thus, from the heart of the most compassionate Buddha, the Locus-born Guru appeared in the world to aid all beings. Indrabhiiti, meanwhile, downcast and near despair, decided to risk his life for the good of his people and set out to obtain a wondrous wish-fulfilling gem from the Nagas who dwelt beneath the waters of the ocean. After a hazardous but successful journey, the Nagas greeted him with offerings of precious stones, while the Goddess of Azure unveiled a brilliant blue gem. With this auspicious gem safely concealed in his garments, the King uttered a wish, and his blind left eye immedi-ately opened. Returning from the palace of the N:igas, the King beheld a five-colored rainbow hovering_ over the Dhanakosa Lake. There he discovered the young boy-whose body shone like the sun-sitting on the pollen bed of an enormous lotus. Believing this shimmering sight to be a dream, the King asked the child who he was and from whence he came, and the boy replied, \"! have no parents, but am born spir-itually, the gift of Amitabha and Avalokitdvara. As foretold by the Buddha, I have come to aid all beings and reveal the doctrine of the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Inner Mantras.\" Hearing this, the King completely recovered his sight arid joyfully enthroned the youth as his son and heir, naming him Padma Jung-nay ('Locus-born'). Thereafter, in the land of Uqqiyana, vapor arose from the sea, clouds formed in the sky, rain fell, flow-ers blossomed and fruits ripened; all depression and fear lifted from the hearts of the people. When the Lotus-born grew to maturity, Indrabhi.ici, who had now grown old, arranged Padma's marriage to a beautiful princess from Sirp.hala' and crowned the young prince King of U<;l<;liyana, Padma Gyal-po ('Locus King'). Secretly, the King presented Padma with the wish-fulfilling gem, saying, \"This will satisfy all your wanes.\" But the prince returned it replying, \"Whatever I behold is my wish-fulfilling gem,\" and, requesting the king to extend his opened hand, instantan-eously produced another gem. But Padma's attainment of the heights of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8 History worldly power and sensuous enjoyment quickly led him to realize the illusory and unsatisfactory nature of all things. Recalling the Great Renunciation of the Buddha, he decided to renounce his home and kingship, saying, \"This worldly life is transitory, the activities of Sarpsara are endless, and separation is inevitable. Since chis is the law of the world, I will fix my thoughts on attaining liberation.\" Soon, however, it happened chat Padma was held karmically responsible for killing the wife and demon son of a minister and was banished into exile without worldly possessions. Thereupon he freely cook up the life of a yogi. Seeking the Teachings Wandering among the eight famous cemeteries (cremation grounds) of India, Padma practiced meditation without distraction. Then he proceeded to the Cool Sandalwood cemetery near Bodh Gaya.4 Using corpses for his seat, he entered into deep Samadhi and continued meditation for five years. Peaceful pakinis often visited him and gave him many empowerments and oral instructions. For food he cook che offerings made to the dead, and for clothing, the shrouds of the corpses. In each of the eight cemeteries he received ritual practices (sadhana) from the guardian Herukas (wrathful male deities) and Siddha Masters (accomplished yogis), who hold the secrets of enlightenment. While meditating for many years in these cemeteries, Padma traveled th~<,>Ugh space to different realms and world-systems, requesting instructions in the esoteric teachings. Through constant practice he acquired mastery over all the restless and destructive forces of nature and was named Dorje Drag-po ('Indomitable Wrathful One'). Then Padma walked to Bodh Gaya multiplying his body so that it appeared like a vast multitude of yogis, and thus astounded the crowd of onlookers. When asked by the people who he was and wha~ guru he followed, Padma replied, \"I have no guru, but am the Self-born Buddha.\" Yet seeing that these people and those of coming generations would need spiritual guidance, Padma disciplined himself in the three yogas of body, speech and mind, and continued to study with teachers in both human and non-human realms. For he desired to find a doctrine capable of being explained in a few words, which, when applied, would prove immediately effective, just as the Sun, once it has risen, imme-diately gives heat and light."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Life and Liberation of Padmasambhava 9 Journeying to the country of Padmavati, Padma mastered the art of healing, learning diagnoses and an innumerable variety of rem-edies. In the land of Ragala, Padma met an old, white-haired man, the Friend-of-All, and asked him, \"Old man, what is your knowledge?\" And the old man replied, \"In teaching language and writing, I have no rival in the world beneath the sun.\" \"Then,\" Padma said, \"kindly teach me language and writing,\" and so he learned Sanskrit, the language of the gods, and many other dialects-all together 360 languages and 64 forms of writing. Thereafter, he mastered the arts of the lapidary ·and the potter and became skillful in all crafts. In this way, Padma proceeded, receiving whatever instruction he requested. From Ananda he received an account of all the SG.tras and com-mentaries that had been recorded in writing. From Guhyabuddha he received the Mahayoga Tantras, from Sri Sirp.ha the Tantras of the Supreme Heruka, and from Garab Dorje the Dzog-chen (Mahasandhi) teachings, the highest of the Tantras.~ Visited by Bodhisattvas from other realms, Padma learned all that was known concerning astrology, philosophy, logic, physics and the combined wisdom of all other worlds. His next teacher was an ordained pakini who manifested before him one hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities and transformed him into the syllable HO¥. Then she initiated him into the Hayagriva MaQqala, empowering him to overcome all conflicting spiritual beings and mental forces. Thus having practiced the outer, inner and secret tradi-tions of the Tripi~aka, and having received the precepts, explanations, initiations and empowerments of the Tantras, Padma became a com-plete master of all existing knowledge. Before him, the incarnation of the mind of the Buddha Amitabha, there spontaneously appeared the MaQqala of the Unity of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Externally he appeared as a brown-robed monk, but inwardly he was master of the Supreme Secret Mantras. Then ·Padma attained the yogic arts of clairvoyant seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling and tasting, by practicing austerities which assisted his development ofbreath control and the resultant 'psychic heat'. Having acquired knowledge as limitless as the sky, Padma journeyed to a cemetery where the Tantric deity, Mahakala, dwelt. There, resting his back against a Stii.pa adorned with precious gems, he taught the Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings to the pakinis. Having traveled far and wide, in India he was called Nyi-ma Od-zer ('Ray of the Sun'), and in Nepal, Loden Chog-se ('the Transmitter of Wisdom to all Worlds')."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 History Travels throughout the World Padma then journeyed to the land of Zahor where he preached the Dharma and gave instructions in the Mantrayana to the King's daughter, Princess Mandarava. However, the people became scandalized, believing that a monk was cohabiting with a woman, and reported this to the King. The King became enraged, confined his daughter to a pit of thorns, and condemned Padma to be burned alive. But the Lotus-born Teacher, in full command of all natural forces, transformed his cremation pyre into an immense lake6 surrounded by a burning ditch. In the center of this lake, an ivory-petalled lotus supported a child of eight, whose translucent body glowed with the purplish color of seashells. The King, rubbing his eyes, saw the whole sky haloed with iridescent lights and, repenting his error, offered Padma the throne, naming him Padmasambhava ('The One Born from a Lotus'). Then Amitayus ('Buddha of Boundless Life') came in a vision to Padma and Mandarava as they were meditating in a cave, and, placing the urn of boundless llfe on their heads, rendered their bodies luminous, and henceforth immune to illness, old age and death-the immortal essence of the Buddhas. Thereupon he constructed the MaQ.galas of the Wrathful Deities and demonstrated the effectiye methods of doctrine and conduct, whereby one may, step by step, attain NirvaQ.a. Stainless as a diamond, the Guru then returned to his birthplace, Uqqiyana, and appeared in public with his woman disciple, asking for alms. But the royal ministers recognized him saying, \"This (is the former prince who abandoned his wife and then murdered the minis-ter's son. What catastrophe will he now bring upon the country? He aspires not co good, but co crime.\" All the ministers agreed. So loads of sandalwood and measures of oil were assembled, and the couple was committed to the flames. But even after twenty-one days, che smoke from the pyre had not dispersed. With all his ministers the King visited the site and beheld an enormous lake, with the entwined couple dancing in the center of a blossoming lotus, radiantly enhaloed in rainbow auras. Humbly, the King ofU99iyana asked for blessings and teachings, and Padma replied, \"The three worlds7 are like a prison house. Even though you are a wise king and possess every material comfort, you cannot escape the material and sensual attachments which cause you frustration and mental suffering. But knowledge of temporal impermanence and the inevitability of death will guide you to honor this precious life, abandon worldly illusions, and teach you to govern your mind.\" Thus saying, Padma became known as Dorje Dro-lo ('The Eternal Comforter"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Life and Liberation of Padmasambhava 11 of All Beings'), and stayed in U44iyana for thirteen years, instructing the populace in the outer, inner and secret mantric formulas. Many of these people became successful practitioners and later passed away in a brilliant rainbow light, leaving behind no physical trace. Padmasambhava traveled throughout India and Nepal giving instructions in the Mantrayana. He also journeyed throughout this world and to higher realms-to South India and Lanka (Ceylon), In-donesia, Burma, Central Asia, parts of China and Russia, Afghanis-tan, Persia, Egypt, Africa, to various mystic lands such as Sambhala and Sumeru, and to many other realms. In all these lands he subdued fierce mountain gods, barbaric cannibal spirits, and demons of pestilence and plague. To all dark planetary forces he brought the harmonious in-fluence of the Dharma, and in those tormented by mental anguish, emotional instability and lack of confidence, he dispelled the causes and manifestations of bewilderment, dissatisfaction, frustration and nega-tivity, and cultivated equanimity. In Southeast Asia, in the copper-colored land of Zang-ling, a Tirthika (non-Buddhist) king had him bound and thrown into the river.

Once, at Nalanda Mahavihara, the renowned Buddhist university, the Buddhist scholars were being challenged in philosophical debate by powerful proponents of opposing doctrines and said among themselves, \"Although we can defeat them in controversy, we cannot overcome their occult powers.\" Thus, making many prayers and offerings, the Buddhists invited Padmasambhava. The next morning at dawn, Padma arrived at the palace, coming down through the branches of trees like a great bird, and emanated four personalities resembling his own, while he himself remained seated in meditation. Quickly challenging dualistic arguments, he convinced his opponents to doubt their own views. In the next competition, the non-Buddhists magically produced leaping flames of fire, whereupon Padma touched the earth. At once, a lotus blossom appeared and a wide swash of sun-bright flame jumped from the pollen bed, rising beyond sight into the sky. Thus quelling all doubts concerning the supreme nature of the Buddhadharma, Padma became known as Seng-ge Dra-dog ('The Lion-Master of Wisdom'). Padma also traveled to Nepal where, at that time, many natural disasters-earthquakes, storms and floods-plagued the land, destroying both animals and harvests. While meditating in Yang-le-shod grotto, he assumed the wrathful manifestation ofVajrakila (rDo-rje Phur-bu) and, through the intensity of his concentration, bound by promise eight different classes of conflicting and disruptive forces to protect and defend the Dharma in Nepal. Through his activity, Padma transmuted the obscuring powers of bewilderment into a stream of peaceful exis-tence and exemplified the unerring integrity and compassion of all Buddhas. The Advice of the Bodhisattva Abbot The work of perfecting mankind is guided by three Bodhisattvas called the Lords of the Three Families: Mafijusri, Lord of Wisdom, Avalokite5vara, Lord of Compassion, and VajrapaQ.i, Lord of Mystic Power. In order to bring the Dharma to the plateaus of Tibet, they appeared as three early kings of that land. Avalokitdvara manifested as Song-tsen Gam-po, the first Buddhist king of Tibet, whose two queens, a Chinese and a Nepalese princess, were emanations of merciful female Bodhisattvas. Manjusri appeared as, King Tri-song De-tsen, and VajrapaQ.i as King Ral-pa-can."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The IJfe and liberation of Padmasambhava 13 Tri-song De-csen, eager to spread the Buddhadharma in his king-dom, invited from India the learned scholar and gentle Bodhisattva, Santa~ita, and placed the construction of the 'Self-created Temple' of Samye8 under his direction. One auspicious morning, the King, robed in white silk, took a golden pickaxe smeared with unguents and dug to the depth of one cubit, whereupon three oils oozed up from the earth, one red, one yellow, and one white. Spreading this chrysm over his face and anointing his head, the King proclaimed, with great joy, the coming of the Buddha's Doctrine to the Land of Snows. Thus were the foundations laid for the building of Samye Monastery. The priests and shamans of the Bon-po religion, however, did not wish to relinquish either their governing social status or their cultural heritage. They firmly resisted the intrusion of new and different teach-ings, and called upon the wrathful Nagas who destroyed by night what had been constructed during the day, restoring all the earth and stone to its original places. Realizing that social insurrection and chaos would ensue if Santara~ita remained, Tri-song De-tsen reluctantly requested him to depart. But the Abbot replied, \"I have endeavored to perfect the spirit of a Bodhisattva.

By new moon he had reached Nepal. Then Padma, the Doctor of U<;l<;liyana, spoke: \"Carrying out the task of conversion, in the end I will arrive. The Spirits born sexually must hold their peace.

King Tri-song De-tsen, Ye-shey Tso-gyal, the translator Vairocana, and others, each offered the Guru a ten-ounce gold-piece, shaped as a lotus flower, and asked him for initiation into the MaQqala of the Unity of all Buddhas (bDe-gshegs-'Dus-pa'i dKyil-'kor). During the ritual ceremony, each of the disciples tossed a flower into the MaQqala and thus invoked the wrathful deities (Herukas) who guard the entrances to the inner circle.

Realizing that mankind was not yet ready to receive some of the highest Tantric teachings, the Precious Guru composed many scriptures which contained the essence of his teachings. At a cave near Chim-phu, several miles north of Samye, these texts were transcribed by his disciples in an abbreviated, codified script which could only be understood by those who were properly prepared. These teachings, or Terma, were then carefully wrapped and concealed in caves and temples, at the bottom of pools and in the cracks of rocks-and also in the Guru's Mind.11 Knowing that the Buddhadharma would be misinterpreted by those who were not enlightened, the U~<;liyana Teacher predicted that t!Jese same twenty-five disciples would later return as Tertons, incarnate emana-tions of the Guru, to recover these treasures from their hiding places and to interpret the abbreviated script for the understanding of whoever required instruction. When at last this work was completed, the Master of the Mantrayana predicted the specific time and place of the Terma discov-eries, the name of each Terton, the disciple to whom the teachings would be given, and the number of people who would become en-lightened throughout the Himalayas and the world as a result of their efforts. Then for twenty-one days, at Tha-duk (Multi-colored Dragon), he once again explained the outer, inner and secret teachings, and fi-nally commanded the King and his people to practice diligently and to protect the Dharma in the future. In addition, he advised them on a variety of subjects such as farming, law, the organization of society and principles of enlightened government. A vast throng of people then escorted the Lotus-born Guru to the Gung-thang-la Pass on the border ofTibet (Mang-yul) where he made his final gift to the people-the Thirteen Precepts which remove all obstacles to the continuation of the Tantric lineage. Giving them his final instruction, Padma said, \"May all future generations who cannot now meet me read this exposition of my spiritual practice and self-liberated existence in this world, obtain a clear view of its significance, and live according to its implied command, becoming perfect in all things.\" Thus exhorting the people to aspire to Buddhahood, Padma mounted a winged horse which appeared from out of the sky, and, rising upwards in a mist of rainbow radiance, he vanished on the rays of the sun."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Life and Liberation of Padmasambhava 33 From Tibet, Padma flew to the southwest land of the untamed Rilqasas and liberated them from the frustrations of samsaric exis-tence.

Each disciple, then, has come to be known by a specific gesture, as illustrated by the traditional line drawings in the following sectio\"n. The accompanying biographies are also intended to provide convenient points of entry into the drawings, for each pictorial metaphor draws our attention to the unitive character of the mind and irs external manifes-tations-something which is neither easily expressed nor experienced. The lives of the twenty-five disciples provide us with rich examples of properly motivated activiry,.....an aspiration for enlightenment un-hampered by pretenses. To enter the MaQqala of the dynamic presence of the Guru, each of the disciples made a 'sacrificial' offering of his body, speech and mind-symbolized by casting a flower into the ·center of the MaQqala. The primary purpose of such an offering is to present to one's Guru a gift whose price is beyond measure. To enter a MaQqala, either physically or as a totally internalized visualization, is a very significant act. One's entire being-one's thoughts, feelings and perceptions-are fully and actively engaged. Rather than make the pursuit of enlight-enment into some idealized, future project, the meditator chooses to give of himself completely here and now. Nothing is held back. Without chis basic willingness co surrender all our evaluations of who we think we are and what we chink is possible for us, genuine lived freedom is impossible. For this reason, many Buddhist teachings focus attention on the deceptive nature of desire. Desire can either painfully entrap us in self-centered craving, or it can lead us to recognize our bodily limitations and thus yearn to exchange this world for some illusion concerning the 'infinite' and 'transworldly'. Entry into the MaQqala, however, demands the death of all desire, and this death permits the birch of an appreciative commitment to the intensity of life just as it unfolds. 'Entering', chen, is not possible without 'offering'. Entry into any of the stages of Buddhist development involves th~ taking of vows by those who are guided by the motivation to attain enlightenment in this lifetime. This vow is not something we muse carry out with a blind sense of duty, but rather the natural outflow of a firm commitment co be true to who we are, rather than to any selective biases concerning our 'development'. If we must have a 'view' at all, only an enlightened .one will do. This aspiration for enlightenment, which evokes the transfigura-tion of all generally frustrating constituents of Sa111sara, is further illumined by a living exemplar, the Guru-as-Reality, who, as the em-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"38 History bodiment of the enlightened consciousness, is uncompromisingly awake and compassionately active. At the moment of initiation, each of the disciples accepted as their exemplar one of eight guardian Herukas who elucidate various aspects of the mind of Guru Rinpoche. While our timid personalities are normally confined to the realms of fiction, the wrathful deities, or Herukas, are not similarly constrained to some fictional 'beyond'. They stride over all boundaries and thrive on the nourishment of all circumstances. Their power derives from their fierce practieality, their immunity to the seductiveness of inauthentic uses of body, speech and mind. Their bodily action-the spontaneously kept commitment to reality-suggests the nature of the very advanced Sidhana practiced by the twenty-five disciples. Similarly, by means of this internal transformation, their speech expresses the essential quality of Mantra, which communicates the intrinsic value of life present in every situation. Through Mantra, the mind becomes relaxed, concen-trated and fully appreciative, envisioning all manifestations of body, speech and mind as essentially perfect. Calling upon a 'tutelary deity' or inner guide awakens within us our own deep connections with this enlightened consciousness. For example, propitiation of Hayagriva (the wrathful aspect of Amitabha, Lord of Speech) empowers the initiate to subdue the impure mental forces of passion-lust. Propitiation of Vajrakila (the wrathful mapifes-tation of the 'fearless' Amoghasiddhi) severs the roots of karmically inherited dispositions constituting the personality stemming from envy-jealousy, and eliminates feelings of separateness instigated by insecurity, fear and self-condemnation. To call upon one's Heruka is, therefore, to bring the enlightenment of the Guru-who spans all circumstances-into a meaningful relation with the immediate events of one's own life. This process of integration produces a new vision and fresh perspective whereby the individual apprehends the world around him and all that it contains as a total presence-a harmoniously inter-related field seen as the embodiment of absolute being. Padmasambhava's followers accomplished this integration to such a degree that their actions appeared to be' magical' to those unwilling to believe that such spontaneous and inspired activity might constitute an appropriate norm for everyone. Their display of paranormal powers or abilities, such as drawing water from rocks, indicates that beyond a rational system of conceptual interpretations, there exists a level of reality where an unprejudiced awareness operates freely within the open, undefined parameters of immediately lived experience. Once chi~ underlying awareness was discovered and developed, the disciples re-cognized the material world as neither fixed nor solid. By contemplat-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Twenty-five Disciples of Padmasambhava 39 ing the transitoriness of all phenomenal existence, they learned to penetrate material substances-such as passing through rocks-as easily as they could penetrate the most subtle regions of mind itself. Neither magicians nor metaphorical 'deities', the disciples manifested the effects of their direct realization through their subsequent activity in the world. The line drawings depicted here, then, only point in a symbolic way to this realization and represent mere drops in the ocean of possibility. I have compiled these short biographies from the Tibetan accounts of Dudjom Rinpoche's \"History of the Nyingma,\" Kong-crul's \"En-cyclopedia\" and from my own memory based on the teachings of my guru, Jam-yang Khyen-tse Lo-dro. These twenty-five disciples-and their disciples-are also responsible for a great number of the early translations of the Siitras and Sastras which appear in the Tibetan Tripi!aka, as well as many original and compiled works appearing in the collection of Nyingma Tantras known as the rNying-ma'i rgyud-'bum. Even today many scholars are not aware of the sizeable contril;>Ution by early Nyingma translators such as Vairocana, Ka-wa Pal-tseg, Ye-shey De, Cog-ro Lu'i-rgyal-tshan, Ma Rin-chen-chog and others, so I hope it will be useful and informative to introduce their names to the West. Throughout the centuries, many great 'precious masters' (rin-po-che) from all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism have benefitted from the preservation and oral transmission of Nyingma meditation practices and initiations. May the memory and subtle power of this ancient and direct lineage now be planted and shared with all people, fulfilling Padmasambhava's prophecy that the teachings of the Vajrayana would one day bloom throughout the world. [1) Tri-song De-tsen (mNga-bdag rGyat-po Khri-srong !De'u-btsan) As Tibet's most powerful King (c. 755-97 A.D.), Tri-song De-tsen extended his territories well beyond the Tibetan frontiers and main-tained political influence over one-third of the known world. But nothing ·could satisfy him more than fulfilling his desire to unify the teachings of the Buddha in the Land of the Snow-capped Peaks. So he invited the Bodhisattva Santarak~ita to instruct the Tibetans in the meaning of the Sutras, the practice of the sixteen moral precepts, and the basic mental trainings of Mahayana Buddhism. Convinced of the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"40 History Tri-song De-tsen superior value of the Buddhist teachings, Tri-song De-tsen then invited the Uggiyana Master, the renowned Padmasambhava, who brought with him the inner teachings of the Tantras and the oral instructions of the Mantrayana. Guru Rinpoche then initiated the King, as well as other advanced disciples, into the MaQ.gala of the Unity of all Buddhas, wherein the King offered a golden flower to Chem-chog Heruka in the center of the MaQ.gala. 1 Through his practice of Sadhana, the King integrated his behavior and awareness with that of Hayagriva and awakened into Samadhi.2 Tri-song De-tsen carefully studied the texts which Santarak$ita had brought to Tibet and was determined to translate the Indian texts and teachings into Tibetan. For this reason he sent well over a hundred Tibetans to learn Sanskrit in India. These later returned carrying numerous sacred texts and were accompanied by scores of Indian PaQqitas. Then, joined by such masters as Vimalamitra3 and Vairocana, they translated innumerable volumes of Sutras, discourses and Tantras in the Great Hall at Samye."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Twenty-five DiscipLes of Padmasambhava 41 The King, however, whose clan of De belonged to the ancient Bon tradition, found it increasingly difficult to justify to his ministers the presence of the Indian teachers and scholars. The royal family of ministers, who performed specialized religious, social and political functions, were therefore intimidated by the authority and prestige given to the King's Buddhist guests. They accused the King of being tricked by the Indian magicians who, they claimed, had cleverly de· pleted the royal treasury in order to build Samye monastery. \"Of what value,\" they asked, \"are the Buddhists? They waste our resources and make food-offerings to their wrathful deities which are never eaten.\" Rather than relinquish their power, the King's ministers persistently counseled him against the Buddhists, saying, \"You are a Bon-po and the Bon is a venerable tradition. There is no reason for you to invite these Indian teachers and threaten the social order in Tibet.\" Even the foreign relatives ofTri-song De-tsen's queens opposed the Indian Pai).gitas and demanded their departure. Not knowing how to resolve this conflict, the King was advised to sponsor a debate to determine which group was more worthy to direct the religious activity of Tibet. The Bon-pos, thinking that they possessed the most eloquent and intellectual speakers, and convinced their psychic capacities were significantly ad-vanced, thus publicized the debates widely. When the debates were scheduled to take place, the Buddhist disciples of Padmasambhava, who had been meditating in caves and in the surrounding mountains, gathered together near Lhasa. In a place called Drag-mar Rin-zang, a tent made of cotton was erected. Many Bon-pos and Buddhists were present, and overseers from each party were appointed. Thereupon, Tri-song De-tsen said: \"Everyone observe, which is true and. which is false, which has the greater magical powers. Once and for all, Bon-pos and Buddhists must contest their skill.\" And thus the contest began. The Buddhist disciples were prepared. Their intense practice had nurtured and stabilized in them a deep understanding that all appear-ance arises and remains within an open horizon of possibilities, and, with limitless freedom, they displayed myriad signs of their spiritual development. The teacher Padma hung his cloak over the rays when the sun rose in the morning. The Bodhisattva Sanraralq;ita threw a thunderbolt into space which stayed there for a day.

Vairocana's swifc-foocedness equalled chat of a bird. Gyal-wa Chang-chub stood a vase in mid-air. Kon-chogJung-nay sat in a bonfire without being burned. After this amazing display of skill, the King summoned all of his ministers and said, \"Since this holy Buddhism is good for both the here and hereafter, I urge you to follow Buddhism ... ,\"and thereby ruled for the Buddhists to remain. The Bon-pos, in their books, also claim to have performed a number of marvelous signs, but, as the King wanted to practice Buddhism, they had no choice but to concede. At that time, many Bon-pos became Buddhists and henceforth the twenty-five disciples of Padmasambhava were recognized as true masters of the Mantrayana. Tri-song De-tsen, who was regarded as an incarnation ofManjusri, received Padmasambhava's complete teachings and became Guru Rin-poche's direct successor, passing on the Dzog-chen instructions called sLob-dPon Chen-po Pad-Ma'i bK.a'-Srol. He wrote ·commentaries on the Siitras, practiced the Tantric teachings, and meditated in the awareness of perpetual Samadhi. In subsequent years, scholars and translators arriving from India brought many precious relics and jewels. With these, Tri-song De-tsen initiated the work of restoring the 108 Stiipas which had been constructed throughout Tibet in the time ofSong-tsen Gam-po. Thus, under the direction of Tri-song De-tsen, the Doctrine spread across the country like daylight at dawn. (2) Ye-shey Tso-gyal (mK.h'-'gro Ye-shes mTsho-rgyal) Ye-shey Tso-gyal was Padmasambhava's closest disciple and mastered the Guru's complete teachings. In the Initiation MaQ.~ala, her flower-offering fell upon Dorje Phur-bu (Vajrakila) who revealed to her the intrinsic awareness (ye-shes) which is radiant with all positive qualities. Originally one of Tri-song De-tsen's young queens, she received the name 'Tso-gyal', which means 'The Conqueress of the Lake', from Padmasambhava. One day, Ye-shey Tso-gyal came upon a young man who had just died, and, out ofheart~felt compassion for his mother, rescored him co life.

Then, with an unfailing memory, she transcribed his teachings and reduced their meaning to symbolic form in a codified script known only to the inner circle of initiates.

Through her continuous compassionate activity, she awakens awareness in the hearts of those who recite the Vajra Guru Mantra and who practice the teachings of Guru Rinpoche. [3] Vairocana (sPa-gor Lo-chen Bai-ro-tsa-na) Vairocana was one of Padmasambhava's most gifted disciples. He was born into the Pagor clan in Zangkor near Lhasa and practiced meditation in caves, unattached to the extremes of misery or happiness. It is said that, at age eight, he left the imprint of his foot imbedded in a rock at sNe-mo as a sign of his spiritual attainments. One of the original seven monks (sad-mi) trained by Santara~ita, Vairocana was sent to India by Tri-song De-tsen and, while there, studied with the master Sri Siq1ha. Secretly, during the night, the master delivered to him the Tantric doctrines of the Ati-yoga, writing them out with goat's milk on a white doth. Sri Siq1ha told him, \"If you hold the cloth over smoke, the letters will become quite visible, but you must carefully guard the secret teachings.\" When Vairocana returned to Tibet, he became one of the most respected translators of his time, carefully wording the Tripiraka and Prajfiaparamita literature with precision and insight. Afterwards, in close communication with Padmasambhava, he edited the eight Nyingma Tantric Sadhanas, including the cycles of Vajraklla and Hayagrlva. When Guru Rinpoche initiated him into the MaQ.<;lala of the Self-same Nature of All Buddhas, Vairocana cast his golden flower on Drag-nag Heruka (Mod-pa Drag-sngags). Thereafter, he practiced meditation ceaselessly and received many private teachings and ad-vanced practices.

After meditating for many years in Kham, Vairocana carried the Tantric teachings to China. His unclouded devotion and faith opened his inner eye and enabled him to see both the formed and formless as the manifestation of unoriginated awareness.

His .practice reached full maturity when he mastered the three unsurpassable yogas, Maha, Anu and Ati. So successful and fearless was he that one day the King Lang Dar-rna, hearing of the great 'magic man', invited Sang-gye Ye-shey to his court. \"What sort of power do you have?\" he asked. \"Show me your power.\" So Sang-gye Ye-shey accepted the challenge.

The Tibetans of pre-Buddhist rimes believed that the forces of wind and :water, tides and quakes, personified heavenly powers which, whether wrathful or benevolent, inspired their homage and reverence. Bound co a world of superstition, they believed their kings were divinely empowered, and so traced their ancestry to heavenly realms. As long as the king served as intermediary between the world of man and the world of the gods, man and the mysterious powers of a seemingly impersonal nature might abide in harmony. That the first Tibetan king was not of divine origin, but descended from the royal Indian dynasty known as the Licchavis (Li-tsa-byi) of the city ofVaisali, necessitated a radical depar-ture from many ancient cosmological notions. Followers of the native religion of Bon held that their ancestral inheritance represented a progressive descent, of aeonic duration, from the heavenly spheres. Concurrent with this was the still popular belief in animism whereby demons and ocher aboriginal powers who dwelt in the obscure recesses of the country possessed the relentless capacity to unleash earthquakes, floods, and other 'natural' catastrophes. Conse-quently, the myth and legend of Tibet's earliest history reflects a dramatic world-a world impregnated with an atmosphere of joy and grief, of anguish and exultation. Wherever there is mankind, there is myth. Mythic knowledge does not necessarily depend on man's sense of historical continuity, but on the interpenetration of his psyche with the external world of sensuous forms. The mythic world directly intervenes with human activity be-cause it seems from a world view whose primary interest is practical. More than mere'speculacive knowledge', myth and legend provide man with intuitive insights which not only provide protection from sickness, death or misfortune, but which simultaneously unite him-in his search for total being-with his deepest aspirations. This mythic world may be seen by the scientific-minded as 'ready-made', a symbolic world unique to a specific culture, but which serves no practical purpose. Contem-porary man may wish only to take a pragmatic-and hence prosaic-interest in his mythic past, yet to do so would be to overlook the sustaining power which mythic knowledge provides for contacting the potential underlying his own existence. The macrocosm and the microcosm are not seen as two mutually exclusive domains, bur rather coexist within man as a felt unity. In his sense of pure beingness, man is not delimited by deterministic laws, nor by society, nor by the will of some god-he makes himself what he is.

Just before Padmasambhava's journey co Tibet, King Tri-song De-csen was caught in an imponderable dilemma. With the acceptance of the new religion of Buddhism, the people were gradually forsaking their ties co the old religion of the Bon, and with it, the king was forced co relinquish his god-like status. No longer did he pose as the shaman-istic protector of his people against the aboriginal dei ti~ that threa cened co overrun Tibet with diseases and epidemics. When these forces were unleashed co express opposition co Padmasambhava's arrival, the Great Guru subdued them once and for all, thus reestablishing the preemi-nence of che king and demonstrating the efficacy of Buddhist practices co transmute negative forces into the supremely positive. Without des-troying the ancient traditions, he revitalized the old cosmic order by delegating to the demons and malevolent spirits the responsibility of guarding the new religion. Then, by constructing Samye monastery in the shape of a MaQ.qala, Padmasambhava presented to the Tibetans a new symbol for an entire cosmos, which ultimately finds its source within each individual. . Our story begins approximately seven centuries after the arrival of Na-cri-tsan-po into Tibet, describing an incident chat occurred to his twenty-eighth successor, King lHa-tho-cho-ri: the appearance of a mysterious chest provides a natural link between the ancient Bon belief in the sacral status of the king and the introduction of Buddhist ideas ... by way of a Sutra book and ocher articles of a genuinely Buddhist origin. THE YEAR 333 A.D. marks the dawning of the Sacred Doc-trine1 and the beginning of Dharma history in Tibet. In this year something extraordinary came into the view of King l.a-tho-tho-ri,2 who, in his seventy-ninth year, was residing at the summit of the Palace Yam-bu-la-gangLa chest, appearing to descend in a ray of light, fell from the sky. When the King raised the lid, he found two Siitra books,4 the Six-syllable Mantra, 0¥ MA~I PADME HfJ¥, a golden Stiipa,5 and a Wish-fulfilling Gem with its base cast for impressing.6 The texts, however, were written in a language that neither the King nor his ministers could read, and, since they had fallen from the sky, it was first thought that the chest and its mysterious contents were the gift of a Bon sky god.7 In a dream, the King received a prophecy which revealed"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"78 History that the significance and meaning of this magnificent gift would not be known for five generations. Nevertheless, these objects were honored as something portentous and very precious.8 Through their powerful influence, the King was rejuvenated into a youth of sixteen, lived to be 120, and his whole kingdom flourished. To this day, King La-tho-tho-ri is revered as an emanation of the Bqdhisattva Samantabhadra.9 King Song-tsen Gam-po: The First Great Flourish The fifth successor to the throne10 following King La-tho-tho-ri was one of the three most famous and popular kings of Tibet. Song-tsen Gam-po11 was recognized as an incarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalo-kitdvara. When his father died in the year 582, he ascended to the throne at the young age of thirteen. Two years after his coronation, out of a deepening respect for the Buddhadharma, he sent an emissary to southern India to obtain a most valuable statue of Avalokitdvara. He also sent his loyal minister, Gar,12 to the court of the Indian king to acquire two priceless statues ofSakyamuni Buddha (jo-bo). These sacred images were formed out of four alchemical metals, adorned with precious jewel inlays, and had been fashioned in India when the Enlightened One was just a young prince.13 The Indians, however, had previously given these priceless statues away-one to Nepal and the other to China. Thus, in the first century B.C., along the many winding routes from Bodh Gaya and Magadha to Nepal and on to China, these famous statues were venerated by wayfarers, caravan leaders, kings, and noblemen alike, and became early precursors of the northward migra-tion and future blossoming of Buddhism in Tibet. In order to facilitate relations with China and Nepal, and to acquire these most valuable images, King Song-tsen Gam-po decided to initiate familial relations with the kings of these two bordering countries. The King of Nepal14 readily agreed to the marriage of his daughter, and as dowry, Princess Thi-tsun 15 brought with her the prized statue of Sakyamuni, as well as images of Aksobhya Buddha, Maitreya the coming Buddha, and a magnificent sandalwood statue of Green Tara.16 Several years later (641 A.D.), the king initiated a second marriage, this time with the Princess Wang-co, 17 who was the daughter of Emperor Seng-ge-tsen-po, 18 and whose grandfather was the first emperor of the T'ang Dynasty.19 But securing this marriage proved more difficult, so the King sent his Minister Gar to the Imperial Palace with one hundred officers to deliver the King's proposal of marriage."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Song-tsen Gam-po with his two queens, Thi-tsun (left) and Wang-co (right)"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"80 History Concurrent with this, the ruler of the T'u-yu-hun20 had also proposed marriage to the imperial princess. Upon receiving word of this; Song-tsen Gam-po sent his army of over 200,000 troops co the Kokonor region. The ruler of the T'u-yu-hun, frightened by the presence of this enormous army, readily retracted his request. Then, continuing co demonstrate that Tibet possessed a very powerful ~ilitia, the King garrisoned an army in China, which terrified the inhabitants of Sze-ch'uan province by their mere appearance. The army held the city of Sung-chou (Sung-pan) captive until the Emperor would agree to the marriage of his daughter. The Emperor, however, being a man of dignity, let the customs of his country take their course, and insisted instead that his daughter be won by the most talented suitor. Therefore, Minister Gar was forced to undergo a number of trials and: contests of skill before he could claim Princess Wang-co for Song-tsen Gam-po. As a wedding gift, the Emperor presented to the king the highly praised, jewel-bedecked figure of Sakyamuni. Delighted by the news, Song-tsen Gam-po journeyed to the Tibetan border to receive the princess who arrived there escorted by a company of Chinese troops. After the princess and the precious statue ofJo-bo had been placed in the hands of the Tibetan army, the royal procession journeyed to Lhasa. Upon their arrival at the Palace of Mar-po-ri,21 great festivities and rejoicing cli-maxed the marriage celebration. During this period, many Dharma texts had already found their way into Tibet, but unfortunately there was no one who could read them or explain their meaning. Recognizing this, the King invited many great translators (/otsavas) from India, Nepal, China, and even Kashmir to journey to Lhasa, to reside in his Mar-po-ri residence and translate these newly acquired scriptures.22 Also about this time, Thu-mi Sambho!a,23 an incarnation of Manjusrl, was returning from his mission to Kashmir and northern India. The King had ordered him to devise a Tibetan alphabet suitable for translating the Buddhist texts brought from India. With the aid of two Indian scholars,2'1 Thu-mi constructed an alphabet on the model of the Sanskrit alphabet prevalent in the areas he visited. He also supplied Tibet with its first systematic and written grammar. Following the success of Thu-mi Sambho!a's work, King Song-tsen Gam-po went into relative seclusion for four years, pretending to study the texts which Thu-mi provided. 25 However, being an incarna-tion of Avalokitdvara, the King readily understood the meaning of the texts and so spent this time in perpetual Samadhi. Meanwhile, the two"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Buddhism in Tibet: The Early Chronicles 81 princesses, having come from Buddhist countries, greatly revered the Dharma and exerted much influence on the King to assimilate the practice of the Vinaya (disciplinary) texts which Thu-mi had translated into the social mores of the Tibetan people. 26 Following this advice, the King instituted a legal code of sixteen moral virtues27 and established punishments for such transgressions as murder, theft, and adultery. The Chinese princess also convinced the King that the habit of painting one's face red and wearing animal skins during ceremonial occasions was unkingly.28 On their own initiative, the two princesses sought to further the development of the Buddhist religion by building two temples during the period their lord was in semi-sedusion.29 Needless to say, there were many disputes between the two queens. Thi-tsun, since she was the first to pass the lintel of marriage with the King, strove to show her precedence over the beautiful Wang-co. Thi-tsun's influence was further enhanced because she was two years older chan the young King, who at this time was only sixteen. When the King returned from his retreat, he assumed the re-sponsibility of (Protector of the Doctrine''0 and taught his favored ministers and noblemen the meaning of the religious texts.'! He also instructed his people in the practice of the A valokitdvara Sadhana, as well as methods of meditative concentration and even the art of healing. Wishing his dominion to be the citadel of the Buddhadharma, he initiated the construction of 108 temples throughout Tibet. At the advanced age of eighty-two, after ruling for sixty-nine years, the King disappeared, together with his two queens, as they joined together in embrace with the eleven-faced statue of Avalokitdvara.'2 The three of them are said to have vanished-or coalesced-in this embrace, and thus ascended to T~ita heaven, 'The Abode of Joy'. Just before he passed away, the King wrote an inscription on a copper plaque prophesying that in five generations a great-grandson of his would appear: this child will bear the surname of 'De' and usher in the Golden Age of the Dharma. This plaque, which was stored in the King's private treasury to be preserved for future times, marks the end of the first great flourishing of Buddhism in Tibet. King Tri-song De-tsen: Fulfilling a Prophecy In the years following the death of Song-tsen Gam-po, members of the Gar family established a mighty Tibetan army which was commanded by the King's successor, Mang-song Mang-tsen. The Ti-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"82 History betan army became exceedingly powerful and displayed an invincible unity, for its commanders always deliberated with care before engaging in any battle. The Chinese, despite many attempts to secure the ill-defined Sino-Tibetan border regions, were repeatedly repulsed in their offensives against the aggressive Tibetan army, and, needless to say, the Tibetans were both feared and admired by the countries and protec-torates bordering Tibet. After the passing of five generations, a minister discovered an inscribed copper plaque in a rocky ravine. This was the very plaque which Song-tsen Gam-po had hidden away many years ago. Thinking the plaque greatly significant, the minister presented it to his lord, King Thi-de-tsug-ten. Upon close inspection, the King surmised that the plaque, and the surname of De mentioned on it, referred to him and took it upon himself to fulfill the prophecy as detailed on the plaque. Without delay, he constructed many new Viharas (temples) and in-vited scholars from bordering countries to advance the Doctrine in Tibet. However, despite the energy he invested in trying to carry our this prophecy, the King was most unsuccessful in his attempts to propagate the Dharma-the scholars were reluctant to come and made excuses having to do with ordination requirements.33 With the birth of his son, the King was once again heartened, for this new heir to the throne promised to be a likely candidate to marry a daughter of the Emperor of China. 34 To ease the political tensions between China and Tibet, as well as create greater religious affinities between the two countries, both the Emperor and Princess Chin-ch'eng-kung-chu accepted the offer of marriage. But the young Tibetari prince met a most untimely death, murdered by a jealous heretic minister who wished his own son to marry the Chinese princess. The princess had already begun her journey when she learned the tragic news that her would-be spouse was dead. Never-theless, she continued to the Land of Snows, and, upon arriving, so charmed the King by her beauty that he at once proposed marriage. Through this union was born the famous monarch, Tri-song De-tsen.35 When his father died, Tri-song De-csen received the crown, but not all too comfortably, for now a terrible non-Buddhist minister by the name of Ma-zhang36 found this period of interregnum most con-venient for planting seeds of conspiracy against the Buddhist royalty. Being an avowed enemy of the Doctrine, Ma-zhang was already plo.tting to deport Buddhist monks and turn the viharas into butcher shops. Apparently he would attempt anything to seize control of the throne."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"hi-song De-tsen"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"84 History But Ma-zhang's terror did not last, for as soon as the young King came of age, he displayed an extraordinary mind. His presence alone was enough to impede Ma-zhang's attempts to seize control of the domin-ion. With the assistance of his mighty army, the young King soon controlled over one-third of the then-known world, trade and opu-lence spread throughout his dominion, and the bitter disputes among bordering countries ceased. Tri-song De-tsen realized that this period of peace and prosperity would be most beneficial for propagating the Buddhadharma. Far from being regarded as uncultured or barbaric, Tibet was now looked upon with honor and respect. Without delay, he sent envoys of soldiers and stone masons into China, not only to demonstrate to Emperor T'ai-tsung the power of the Tibetan army, but also to ask his assistance in promoting the Dharma. As a gesture that had religious as well as political significance, the King ordered his men to buiid many stone pillars and religious monuments throughout China to signify their mutual spiritual concord. The King could not trust some of his noblemen for fear that heretics might still be secretly present in the council, so he sent two of his ~ost faithful ministers, Sang-si and Sal-nang,37 to the Imperial Court .to ask the Emperor for advice on matters of religious import. When these two noblemen, traveling with a small army, finally arrived at the royal palace, they entered the Imperial Court and were met by a practitioner of the 'meditation of mystic absorption' (dhy'ima). This master was endowed with great prescience of mind and indicated to the ministers that a certain Indian Upadhyaya (professor of spiritual con-cerns) would be capable of establishing the Buddhadharma in Tibet. He went on to say that the oracle expressed great favor and that the Doctrine would surely blossom in Tibet. But, he said, this would only occur by means of a highly gifted and compassionate master. On their return from China, the two ministers brought with them one thousand bam-pos, or doctrinal compositions each of which con-tained 300 metrical verses (similar to kavya). However, they were still uncertain about the safety of Buddhist scriptures, and fearing further agitation by Ma-zhang's underground of non-Buddhists, se-cretly delivered the bam-pos to the King, who read them only in private. After consulting with Tri-song De-tsen, Sal-nang then journeyed to the neighboring land of Nepal and there met the revered Master of Discipline, Abbot San_tarak~ita, who was then eighty-one years old. Santarak~ita consulted with this worthy minister for many hours and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Buddhism in Tibet: The Early Chrrmides 85 heartily confirmed the necessity of establishing the Buddhadharma in Tibet. Returning co Tibet, che royal minister indicated to the King that the Upadhyaya appeared genuinely concerned and that he would most assuredly come to Tibet carrying the Sacred Basket of the Doctrine. The King, however, feared the safety of his loyal minister Sal-nang and began making secret plans to render powerless the deposed but treacherous Ma-zhang. With the assistance of court astrologers, the King tricked Ma-zhang into willfully entering a tomb of the dead, for Ma-zhang, being a Bon-po and hence a believer in omens, was con-vinced that this symbolic act would ·in some way help him to accomplish his aims. Consequen ely, Ma-zhang himself gained the status of the 1living dead' and was forced to live out his existence in a prison-like graveyard with no chance to escape, his only sustenance the food brought to the tomb as offerings to the spirits of the Bon royalty buried there. Tri-song De-tsen then launched a thorough investigation of Santarak~ita and, finding him to be a most honorable teacher free from fault, sent an emissary accompanied by troops to escort the noble Upidhyaya to the Palace at Lhasa. For fear that the non-Buddhist underground might still be active, care was taken not to publicize the Upidhyaya's arrival. Several great scholars and translators were assem-bled at the Palace, and to these Santar~ita first expounded basic Buddhist philosophy and· ethics.38 As this teaching threatened the power of the indigenous Bon spirits who presided over Tibet, they rose up and provoked many catastrophes, such as severe lightning, hail-storms, earth tremors and famine. Thunderbolts struck the stone pillars of the Palace at Mar-po-ri which was carried away in a flood. As a result, certain Bon-pos became increasingly hostile, especially because the Abbot represented a powerful, well-established Indian tradition which could seriously threaten the political, social, and economic position enjoyed by the royalty who used the shamanistic Bon religion as a means to further their own aims. · The Bon-pos were not the principle nemesis to the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet, but rather those unsympathetic families of ministers who saw Dharma as a threat to their power and political ascendancy. The history of the Bon-pos illustrates many virtuous acts on the part of its adherents, and the powers which the Bon priests possessed were often used for such praiseworthy acts as healing or bringing forth rain.39It is said that some of the disciples ofSantara~ita were formerly members of the Bon, as their family roots extend back co"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":",. Santarak~ita"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Buddhism in Tibet: The Early Chronicles 87 the le~endary Bon clan of the Zhang-zhung. The Bon-pos also claimed that Santarak!jita was born in Zhang-zhung, making him their lineal son. From this, it is evident thanhe Bon-pos took every opportunity to use whatever elements of early Bu·ddhism they found useful to nourish their own tradition. Not only did Sancarak!jica rebuke the Bon-po claim, but he exposed the shamanism of the Bon-pos as vastly different from Buddhism, rejecting it as a wasteful and dangerous use of higher forms of energy. The Bon-pos were divided into a number of sects, with the two major distinctions between the 'white Bon' and the 'black Bon'. While the white Bon-pos performed 'virtuous magic' and eventually adopted the ways of Buddhism, the black Bon-pos became increasingly hostile to the Dharma and sided with the non-Buddhists who attempted to overturn the Dharma by means of 'black magic'. Tri-song De-tsen had family connections with the Bon-pos and so was more sympathetic to them than Santarak!jita. After witnessing the hostility caused by his presence, Santarak!jita said to the King, \"Do not be dismayed, I shallgo to Nepal! The Bon spirits are surely displeased at my presence and my powers are not sufficient to subdue them. Some spiritual force of superior capabilities is needed co subjugate the many non-visibles40 and mountain spirits41 who defy the lamp of the Doctrine and who play upon ch~ wrathful nature of men's minds. However, Oh Great King, in the country of Uggiyana42 there resides a great and learned Bodhisattva who is more than human. His name is Padmasambhava, the Locus-born.

Invite chis Master co Tibet, and the Dharma will most certainly succeed.\" The Journey of the Lotus-born Guru. With these words, Santarak~ita departed and Tri-song De-csen did not wish to make pub-lic the invitation he had sent to Padmasambhava. Thus he declared to his ministry that Santarak!jica's final instructions had actually come to him as a revelation in a marvelous dream. Secretly, though, an envoy was dispatched carrying flowers, incense, and many sackfuls of gold-dust co greet the renowned Acarya who was called 'the Lotus Born'. When the envoy presented the offerings, Padmasambhava scoffed at their significance and threw the gold in the Ten Directions as though it were worthless.

But Padmasambhava, who knew full well the value of the gold and how heavily the people were taxed under the King's regime, reached down and rook a handful of earth. After giving each of them a lump, he transformed the earth into gold right before their eyes! Thereafter, chis territory became known as the 'gold country', for it was found to contain rich deposits of gold ore. After leading the King and a few of his noblemen co a large body of water, Padmasambhava then summoned Ma-dros, the great Naga King and ruler of the aquatic underworld.43 As a sign of friendship, the Buddhist King offered the Naga King fourteen kilos of gold which were carried. on the backs of twelve mules. Thereafter, Guru Rinpoche and the King's royal envoy journeyed co Samye44 where a monumental residency would soon be established. As the Great Guru approached' the Tibetan border, the demons and non-visible spirits began to unleash thunderbolts, hailstorms, powerful winds and blinding snow. After much harrassment, these fearful beings finally succeeded in blocking the road through a canyon, making progress impossible. So, Padmasambhava sat down in medita-tion and, through the power of his Samadhi, converted the evil demons into protectors of the Dharma.45 On the Khala Pass near Western Tsang, he encountered twelve earth-like goddesses who began releasing thunderbolts like arrows and who tried co crush him between the boulders, but as soon as the Guru raised his hand, their thunderbolts turned co charcoal and their strength failed them. These female spirits became known as the twelve guardian goddesses46 and, being com-pletely converted, were encrusted with the guardianship of the Doctrine. On his way to Samye, Padma journeyed coward the northern upland and there subdued the spirits of the Thang-lha as well as other non-human formsY Meanwhile, the Adrya Sancara~ita had returned to Lhasa with his crew of scone masons who were already gathering the materials that would be needed for the future temple at Samye.48 However, once these were collected, the masons experienced great difficulty in keeping together the scones for building, for what was humanly acquired by day, non-humans scattered in many directions by night.49 Consequently, Santara~ita knew that he would have to wait for the arrival of the Great Guru to perform the exorcism of these demons before any real progress could be made. When Padmasambhava arrived in the Tamarisk Garden at Red"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Buddhism in Tibet: The Eqrly Chronicles 89 Rocky Pass, several miles from Lhasa, a cortege of welcomers greeted him with flowers, songs, dances and drums. As the young King appeared co be inflated with pride, consumed by the magnificence of the occasion, the Guru brought him to his senses by projecting fire from his fingertips, singeing the King's robe. The King immediately responded by prostrating before the Guru, and the whole assembly followed his example. Padmasambhava then blessed the small temple that was situated there and invited all the statues to join in the celebration. The statues, in turn, became animated and began dancing and feasting. That night, the temple was emptied of both statues and humans, and in the morning the enlivened statues were discovered eating food and voicing their opinions concerning the Doctrine. The Great Guru then an-nounced publicly, \"There is much work co be done if Samye Temple is to be completed soon.\" So, escorted by the King and Santara~ita, the Compassionate Guru set out for Samye. The MaQ.qala ofSamye Temple. Upon arrival, Padmasambhava announced that all of the demons, spirits, and other malignant non-humans (asuras) must _be called forth, for their assistance would be needed in constructing Samye. The King was naturally appalled by such a suggestion, but his doubts were relieved as soon as the Great Guru completed a potent exorcism. When the propitiation 5° rites were over, Padmasambhava indicated that the fearful non-humans were subdued and the demons would assist in the building of Samye monas-tery. After blessing all those in attendance and consecrating the grounds, the Guru initiated the assembly and work began. As humans labored by day and non-humans by night, the great temple at SamyeH carried the epithet of The Eternal Self-Created (svayam-bhu) Temple of Samye. The plan for the temple and its many outlying complexes was so extensive that it cook five years of continuous construction to complete. Padmasambhava chose for the temple a location thirty-five miles outside of Lhasa, some two miles from the north bank of the Y aru River. Its plan was most elaborate, modeled after the design of a ma11t/ala. The central temple represented Mount Sumeru (Ri-rab)52 and surrounding it were four major and eight minor temples, which signi-fied the twelve continents, while two additional temples represented the sun and the moon. A lofty wall, nearly two thousand yards in circum-ference was built to surround these sacred grounds, with gates at the four cardinal points marked by Stupas (mchod-rten) painted in four colors; and on top of this wall were erected 1,080 small Stupas."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"90 History Extending out from the main temple were four smaller temples, which connected the four sides of the main temple with exotic cloisters. Throughout this exquisite structure stood statues and images made of pure gold or other precious metals and richly adorned with jewels and fine silks from China. Envisioned by Guru Rinpoche long before his arrival at Lhasa, this was the design of one of the most monumental temples ever to be constructed. When Samye Temple was complete, Padmasambhava and Santara~ica announced a great celebration and imparted their blessings co everyone. And during this celebration many wondrous things oc-curred. Not only did music come from the sky, but also fruit and beautiful scented flowers fell from the heavens, while shimmering rainbows appeared everywhere. The people joyously began to dance, and the golden statues in the temple became life-like, joining the merriment outside. Even the sun and moon rose conjointly. After the completion of Samye Monastery and its complex of temples, Santar~ita commented to Padmasambhava, \"We now have a number of fine temples, but no sacred relics to place in the Stu pas. What should we do?\" The Guru then replied, \"I will ask King Tri-song De-tsen to send his 'magic army' to India to seize the precious Buddha-relics (mkhan-rgyud) so that they will be preserved for future times.\" It is said that in Bodh Gaya, when the Buddha died, his body was divided four times, producing eight sets of'body-relics' which were subsequently stored in eight different locations in Magadha (northern India) by the King of chis area. When the officers of Tri-song De-tsen's army arrived in Magadha, they were informed that the relics which they had come to acquire were carefully preserved in sealed urns placed within a large Stupa containing a weapon-like mechanical con-trivance designed to prevent anyone from entering the Stupa. This weapon was said to contain very sharp blades that revolved like a windmill, prohibiting anyone from entering the chamber. At this time, the powerful Tib~tan army, containing over seventeen million men, was marching through northern In'dia· and marking its progress by con-structing iron pillars. The Indians, frightened by the appearance of the Tibetan army, fled to East India and elsewhere, leaving the priceless treasures unguarded. For those few who remained, King Tri-song De-tsen left his shoes at the door of a temple, tricking those who gathered there into thinking that he was inside. The Indians, fearful of even entering the temple, remained outside for many hours anxiously"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Buddhism in Tibet: The Early Chronicles 91 awamng the King's appearance. Meanwhile, Tri-song De-tsen was secretly informed that this marvelous bladed weapon was powered by the waters of the Ganges located several miles away. So, after exploring the banks of the river, the army discovered the point of connection between the river and the distant machine and proceeded to obstruct the flow of water at that location. This enabled the officers co enter the Stiipa and seize the many priceless treasures stored there. This historical event brought much merit to King Tri-song De-tsen, for the acquisi-tion of these relics of the Buddha signified that Samye Monastery and, indeed, all of Tibet was now the new citadel of the Holy Doctrine. Concurrent with these events, translations were made of the many Siitras and Sastras that had been brought from India. For this enor-mous task, the King invited a number of Indian lotsavas, including Dharmaloka, Ramasena and others.53 The Acarya DharmakirtiH was also invited to consecrate the newly arrived texts whose content would later form valuable sections in the Tibetan Tripitaka. The basic texts of the very important Guhya-mantra-tantra~~ were also translated. During this period of fruitful translation, many monks, seven of whom were among the first group of Padmasambhava's disciples, were trained and ordained.~6 These ordinations marked the institution of the first Sangha in Tibet. As major emphasis was placed on the disciplinary codes (Vinaya) observed in the monasteries, chis community reflected the Hinayana Sangha as it existed in India. Tri-song De-tsen was very pleased with such a rapid emergence of the Buddhist community and knew that this overwhelming success was due to Guru Rinpoche's blessings. Even many of the King's ministers, especially chose from the honorable Gar family, became rponks, and in a very shore time, the community grew co over three hundred fully ordained monks. The King, desiring the very finest education for his newly-founded com-munity, sent Vairocana to study in India under the great masters of the Mahayana and Vajrayana. After completely mastering the Great Per-fection Doarine,n Nam-gyi-nying-po58 and Yan-cag Heruka practices, Vairocana returned co Tibet as a most accomplished translator and siddha. During the long period of Padmasambhava's stay in the Land of Snows, his mastery over the many forms of mind-energy enabled countless numbers of men co be guided co the enlightenment-path. Wherever he journeyed, he spread the guardian-light of spirituality indicative of a mind totally liberated and free. Those who had the good fortune to receive instruction from Guru Rinpoche not only became"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"92 HiJtory important receptacles of the Oral Transmission, but also found enlightenment in this one lifetime. To lay people and monks alike, Padmasambhava imparted the teachings of the higher Tancras.59 To some he transmitted the precious Vajraklla (Phur-bu) instructions; and to others he explained the meaning of many written doctrines, includ-ing his own treatise, The Garland of Philosophical Views.60 As a result of the great diversity of teachers, scholars, and transla-tors that journeyed to Tibet from other Buddhist countries, many doctrinal approaches emerged. As long as the authenticity of these divergent positions could be substantiated, they were accepted as gen-uine Buddhist ideas and their supporters were allowed to enter the congress of scholars. For example, toward the end of King Tri-song De-tsen's reign-a period when Sino-Tibetan doctrinal cross-currents were active-a Chinese monk, who was a follower of the Hoshang (Hva-shang) Mahayana, arrived in Tibet. Claiming that his doctrine was superior to the King's, the Hoshang began converting a number of monks over to a doctrine of 'instantaneous enlightenment' -a break-through which occurs as a person envisions the experience of 'goal-completion'. The King, curious about the Hoshang's doctrinal approach, invited the Indian Pa.ttc;lita KamalaSila61 to engage in debate with the Chinese monk. After a long controversy that lasted two years (between 792 and 794), Kamalaslla was finally declared the winner. 62 One day, the King said to Padmasambhava, \"You are a great master, and without your assistance establishment of the Buddha-dharma in Tibet would have been most difficult. There is no way we can repay you for all you have accomplished. You have bestowed many wonderful blessings on our country. Many ministers have become successful scholars and monks, and the lay people are materially rich. The rains are plentiful, the harvests healthy, and there is little disease. The people enjoy a stability never before experienced.\" Indeed, Guru Rinpoche's gifts of compassion never ended. With miraculous energy, he transformed the dismal in to dazzling effulgence. Wherever he journeyed, he bathed the soil with the inviolate light of truth. One day, while journeying to the valley of Yar-lung,63 he approached an em-bankment and struck it with his staff. Suddenly as if by magic, water began to spring forth from a crack at the base of a large rock. Eventually there appeared a crystalline lake and a beautiful oasis-like garden con-taining flowers in full bloom and trees bearing fruit.

At .that time, all Tibet prospered under the protective parasol of the King. The territories bordering the four frontiers-China to the west, Urdum-kashgar ('Odon-Kas-dkar) of the Turks to the north, Baltistan (sBal-ti) and Gilgit ('Bru-sha) to the west, and India to the south-were all held under the sway of Tri-song De-tsen. Having proven himself a very powerful King in the eyes of the Tibetans, Tri-song De-tsen was also an exemplary King of the Doctrine (dharma-raja). To signify this, Santarak~ita announced that a special ceremony would be performed and proclaimed, \"In a small lake north of Mount Sumeru (Ri-rab), there is water that possesses very special qualities, 'The Nectar of Long Life'. With this water, the King shall wash his hair. Now, who is present that can seek out this water and bring it here?\" Padmasambhava then replied, \"I can perform the task!\" So, tak-ing out a large silverpiece and attaching it to a long silk rope, he hurled it into the air. After nearly a half-hour, the rope was drawn in and at the end was a small silver urn containing the life-giving water. Pouring the urn over the King's head, Padmasambhava said, \"Wash your hair with this life-giving water, for it has many beneficial qualities, and from this point onwards you will be a very successful Dharma King!\" From time to time, Padmasambhava performed ritual Sadhanas which not only directed the minds of all those present to the quintes-sence of the Holy Dharma, but also enabled many to experience the vitality of a liberated mind. In the presence of the King and his worthy ministers, he uttered many helpful prophecies regarding the future of Tibet and of Buddhism and, together with his disciples, prepared and concealed numerous secret teachings of the Mantrayana. He predicted by what succession great and learned teachers would emerge in future times, and the method by which these hidden teachings (gter-ma) would be uncovered. The Terma were held in secret because they were incomprehensible to those of mediocre intellect, and never divulged to those who were emotionally or cognitively unprepared. Because they were written in a highly abbreviated language indecipherable to all except the Tertons (masters of the gter-ma), these teachings would remain safe until conditions arose suitable to their revelation. Many spiritual lineages64 emerged through Padmasambhava's twenty-five disciples. With generous support from the King, they were instrumental in establishing numerous secluded retreat centers, where the esoteric Mantrayana practices were performed. At that time"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Buddhism in Tibet: The Early Chronicles 95 there were two divisions in the Sangha. The lay practitioners, some-times called the 'long-haired ones', were not celibates and led the life of laymen. This sort of life suited the person of a generally superior intelligence who knew the necessity of self-discipline without a need for the strict regulatory codes of the monastic com,munity. These practitioners were often accomplished yogins who wore white cotton loincloths, ate a diet of lentils and barley, and practiced Tumo.65 The second division was that of the monks, or 'short-haired ones', who followed the letter of the monastic Vinaya code and wore red or brown robes, resembling the ways of the Hinayana Sangha in India. Out of the continuous efforts of these selfless monks, the sacred literature and practices of the Hinayana and Mahayana were carefully transplanted and preserved in Tiber. According to several historical narrative~ it is believed that Padmasambhava stayed in Tibet for 111 months. Howevet, the Great Guru is more than human-he is the incarnation ofSakyamuni Buddha and an emanation of Arya Maitreya (the coming Buddha), and so the beingness of his existence is beyond the matrix of temporality and spa-tiality. The power of his mind is beyond the limited domain of origina-tion and dissolution, and thus far exceeds the concretizing tendencies of the human intellect. Consequently, we as humans find it most difficult to apprehend the magnificent abilities of this great Master. It would not be an error to say that he simultaneously dwelled in caves, jungles, gardens and groves, near rivers and lakes, and on mountains. At these various locations he performed initiations and Sadhanas with his dis-ciples and other followers. According to Indian reckoning, it is said that the Lotus-born Guru lived for 3,000 years, which in sidereal time, would be 1,500 years. During this period he journeyed to Persia, Afghanistan, South India, Ceylon, Indonesia, Burma, China, Russia, and many other distant lands-and even to other worlds. Successors and Suppression: Ral-pa-can and Lang Dar-ma During his reign (755-797 A.D.), Tri-song De-tsen married a total of five wives, for polygamy was not uncommon in these early times. One of his wives, Tshe-pong-za, bore three sons. When Tri-song :pe-tsen retired from his duties as King and journeyed to Zung-Kar,66 his eldest son, Mu-ne Tsen-po acceded to the throne and faithfully continued the projects initiated by his father. He saw to it that the Tripi~aka rranslations67 were carefully completed and presented to the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"96 History great monastery at Samye for safekeeping, and also initiated the obser-vance of four large religious Sadhanas which were performed at Samye Monastery. However, when he tried to set up a system of taxation, he was troubled because all the people could not give equal amounts. Consequently, he made three attempts to equalize the wealth of the rich and poor through redistribution, but each attempt failed. Those who were formerly rich worked industriously and so quickly regained their wealthy status. Likewise, those who were formerly poor demonstrated their inherent laziness, and so fell again into the abyss of poverty. Troubled by failure at economic reform, he consulted Padmasambhava who explained to him that the gap between the rich and the poor, or one's condition in life, is a consequence of meritorious or unmeritor-ious actions in previous lives, and that these consequences must be faced as a learning experience. King Mu-ne Tsen-po showed great compassion for his people and ruled with patience and understanding. He demonstrated his support to Samye Monastery by providing the monks with food, clothing, and many generous gifts. less than two years had passed when, at the age of seventeen, he was poisoned by his mother who, because he had married a younger wife of his father, perpetrated this callous act out of revenge. The second son, Mu-rug Tsen-po68 was banished to the frontier for three years for killing a son of the chief minister during a squabble in the inner-court. Thus, the youngest son, Mu-tig Tsen-po, who was just a lad of four, received the crown.69 Although he was a rather insignificant ruler and a mere instrument in the hands of his ambitious family, he was responsible for a further flourishing of the Doctrine and showed his respect for the Dharma by building the Kar-chung-gya-de70 temple. His sons were Tsang-ma, Ral-pa-can, and Lang Dar-rna by his first wife, and Lha-je and Lhun-du by a queen oflower rank.71 The first son, Tsang-ma, out of a desire to increase the popularity and status of the Sangha, enjoined many to the monastic way of life. He also wrote an important Sastra. As Lang Dar-rna loved to transgress the moral codes of the layman, he was unfit to mount the throne. This decision was further supported by the advice _pf the court astrologers. So, Ral-pa-can (815-841 A.D.), 'the Long-haired One', was next in line for the royal throne. Ral-pa-can wished to follow the example set by Tri-song De-tsen and began by erecting the temple of Gya-phib-gyu-ngon-can.72 Seeing that the earlier translators had created a technical language that was precise but difficult, and finding discrepancies in comparison to trans-lations from the Chinese and Sanskrit, King Ral-pa-can issued an order"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Buddhism in Tibet: The Early CJ;ronicles 97 'that a community of scholars and lotsavas be formed to revise the ·sacred texts of the Hinayana and Mahayana. He decreed that this work was to be done systematically-every technical term was to be indexed,73 the rules of grammar and syntax followed carefully, and most important, the intended meaning of the original text preserved in such a way that all intelligent men could understand. So, this new series of translations began, and the earlier texts were carefully revised and edited. The Tantras wh~ch had been composed or translated by Padmasambhava and his disciples had been written carefully so as to elucidate the sym-bolic and intentional meanings, and so these were preserved in their original form, unedited. He also decreed that each monk or lama was to be supported by seven households. Out of his deep respect for monks, during public assemblies the King would tie white silken streamers to his long locks and extend them over the dais co the right and to the left of his throne. The pillows of each respective member of the two head-communities would then be placed over these two cords. On the frontiers as well as in the central district (dbUs), King Ral-pa-can erected 108 temples so weary travelers, herdsmen, and noblemen alike could stop to perform religious observances. He pro-vided a protective umbrella for those Indian PaQqitas wishing to settle in his dominion and showered flowers of hospitality on visiting scholars and translators. He also saw to it that the arcana of Mantrayana teachings and Tantric texts were properly transmitted to those with mature minds and who were sufficiently prepared to receive them. Ral-pa-can is thus esteemed by the Tibetans as one of the three most important Dharma kings in the history of the Dynasty~ Among King Ral-pa-can's many translators and academic dean~, Vairocana is particularly noteworthy. This noble Acarya mastered over three hundred dialects and extensively studied the works of the mystic philosopher Sri Sirp.ha, a learned scholar of the Chinese and Indian Tantras. The teaching lineage which arose from Sri Sirp.ha pro-vided a significant contribution towards the evolution of the Nyingma teachings-for Padmasambhava himself received many of the highest teachings from him. Under the guidance of many accomplished Siddhas, Vairocana attained many psychic powers, but always used them sparing-ly and in private. One of the most important saints in the history of the Nyingmapa, Vairocana recognized the essential practicality of the Vajray:lna tradition and the urgent necessity to preserve these teach-ings for the last centuries of the Kali Yuga when it would be most dif-ficult for men to live a truly spiritual life. As one of the twenty-five"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"98 History disciples ofPadmasambhava, he also recognized that this deeply inspired tradition would link the future of Buddhism to the rest of the world. During King Ral-pa-can's reign, there were four insidious min-isters who, from the very beginning, remained corrupt and plotted to abolish Buddhism in Tibet. They could no longer tolerate either the King's laws, the many PaQ.c;litas who repeatedly demonstrated to them their superior knowledge, or the proliferation of the Buddhadharma throughout the dominion. Thus they performed shamanistic practices, a carry-over from the indigenous Bon religion, so chat when they died, they would be reborn into the bodies of four demon-possessed rulers who would bring ruin to all those who continued to uphold the teachings of the Buddha. At the instigation of Ral-pa-can's evil older brother, Lang Dar-rna, these evil ministers had Ral-pa-can assassinated by twisting his neck.74 Shortly afterwards, they committed suicide and were reborn as rulers possessed by powerful demons. Together, their siege of terror dethroned the monks appointed by the late RaJ-pa-ean, and afterwards they attempted to throw the precious image of Sakyamuni into the water; but it was too heavy to lift, so they merely covered it with sand.n After this, many bad omens appeared, and corruption began to spread like a plague. Meanwhile, the diabolical Lang Dar-rna ascended the throne. As demons had already taken possession of his mind, he ordered all the Sangha to surrender their distinctive marks of monkhood or be exe-cuted. He had many monasteries sacked or burned, and the doors of Samye and Phrul-nang ('Phrul-snang) monasteries in Lhasa were boarded up and sealed with plaster. These two precious temples escaped the fiery cauldron of Lang Dar-rna's mind, for he received a threat that, if these temples were damaged or pillaged, the guardian goddesses which Padmasambhava installed would cause great calamities. Nevertheless, an edict was written on the plastered doors ordering the monks to substitute their engagement in religious practices with the indulgence of barley beer (chang), which the insane king freely provided. Many monks fled. Those who stayed were either killed or forced into the forest and fields with hunting drums, bows .and arrows, and vicious dogs. Some were forced to be butchers. All the religious customs and obser-vances were thoroughly destroyed. The great river Ma-chu-kyad (rMa-chu-skyad) which runs from Tibet to China, flowed upwards for three consecutive days.

With the lase prostration, the arrow, already fitted to the bow, was ~eleased and found its mark in the breast of the King. Pal-gyi Dorje chen fled on his horse. After bathing in the lake ofMi-nag, he turned his robe inside out, so as to show the white lining. Riding his now white horse, he then met the search party who were at his rear and proclaimed, \"I am the white asura of the skies, Nam-theo Kar-po.\" He then continued his flight and successfully escaped his bewildered pursuers, seeking refuge in his beloved snow mountains of eastern Tibet to spend the rest of his days in the solitude of prayer and meditation. Although the Tantric lineage and formal Sangha was forced to flee to the outlying districts, most of the esoteric teachings were pre-served by those known as <Mantra-holders'. Thus the main body of the teachings transmitted orally, or through gestures (mudra), by Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Vairocana, and Santara~ita, were safe-guarded. And, because Lang Dar-rna feared the guardian goddesses who were watching over the sacred texts at Samye Monastery, the exoteric teachings-the Vinaya, Surra, Abhidharma-and the Jewel-like Tantras were also preserved. Out of these priceless seeds, new religious adherents continued all the essential teachings and practices.

Ocher narratives more acceptable to the Nyingmapa indicate that these articles were brought to the King in a chest by the Indian PaQgica blo-sems-'tsho (Buddhira~ita) and the translator 11-the-se. When ques-tioned as to the origin of the chest, the Pa.Qqita merely pointed his finger to the cerulean sky. This may have been to signify chat the chest was carried down from the mountains.

The formation of a Buddhist monastic community assumes that there are teachers available for instruction who follow a spiritual lineage extending back to the time of the Buddha himself. Monks generally keep a record of their spiritual genealogy as well as pertinent information concerning their various ordinations.

Buddhist monks and lamas inherited much from the social and cultural life of the Bon-pos which predominated at the time of the intro-duction of Buddhism. It has sometimes been remarked that the Nyingmapa appear to be closely linked with the Bon-pos, but throughout the history of the Ancient Ones, there have always been major differences. Culturally, there may be some similarities, but philosophically and spiritually there is actually no comparison between what is Bon and what is Buddhist. The early Nyingmapa, it may be said, adapted themselves co local custom and thereby assimilated the Buddhist religion into the lifescream of the Tibetan people. Rather than reject the world of spirits and mystifying powers, such masters as Santara~ita and Padmasambhava demonstrated that the shaman-like prac-tices of the Bon-pos possessed no ultimate answers and would not lead the individual out of a restricting sense of being. Prior to the time ofThu-mi Sambho!a, there was little in the way of a written language in Tibet. However, as Bon texts have been known ro exist at this time, some form of language was present. The style of script used at this period was U-me (dbu-med), which has headless characters and is wriccen in a running hand. This script was apparently Bhutanese, although differing sectors ofTibet did vary in their character-style. As the Bon-pos began to adopt the Buddhist doctrine, it became increasingly difficult for those except monks and lamas to distinguish between a Buddhist and a Bon monastery. In later times, the Bon-pos had their own equivalent of the Nine Yanas, as well as a comprehensive set of Siitras and Tantras, astrology, medicine and rituals. The Bon monasteries soon became receptacles of a vast repertoire of religious instruction, and a number of Nyingma lamas, not limiting themselves to only one set of orthodox views, studied ac the Bon monasteries in order to gain new insights into the nature of human consciousness. Through their studies, the Nyingma lamas discovered that what the Bon-pos had done was to copy the early Buddhist texts, only to replace certain technical terms or symbols with Bon inventions in order to make the texts appear to be of Bon origin. By the lace nineteenth century, the Bon sect began to dissolve, and, by 1950, there was scarcely a single monastery in existence which operated under the auspices of che Bon faith."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"106 History 40. mi-snag, 'invisibles'. 41. mi-ma-yin, (amanuJa) 'malignant apparitions' (lie.: 'non-humans'). 42. Some scholars wish to place Uqqiyana (Oddiyana, '0-rgyan) in the Swat Valley, however there is no evidence co support this. Moreover, his birthplace must have been a location experiencing rich cultural exchanges, so it is unlikely that such a remote place as Swat is correct. As this was a period of much intellectual activity, Buddhist ideas were assimilated from many places. The ox routes or trade routes chat extended from northwestern India to Central Asia are a more likely candidate. As the origins of Bon-po ideas point to the West (i.e. Persia), and as Padmasambhava was evidently well ac-quainted with Bon 'metaphysics' before his visit co Tibet, it seems likely that both Padmasambhava's place of birth and the spread of Buddhist ideas had extended further West than has previously been assumed. 43.

Propitiation (hsnyen-pa) is not the appeasement of some deity which is supposed to inhabit some unapproachable realm, but a creative act which requires responsiveness, commitment, and intelligence as both a unified value-pattern and integrative action, and is the basis of all ethical behavior (spyod-pa, carya). The practice of hsnyen-pa involves the deeper and more esoteric aspect ofSadhan;a (sgren-pa) practice, wherein the adept requires sufficient training by a gifted master.

In the Kriyatantra, an emphasis is placed upon ritual aces in such a manner chat one's whole life becomes a ritual of perfection. In the Caryacancra, a higher intellectual acumen on the part of the adept is assumed, and so greater emphasis is placed on the contemplative life. However, in the Yogacantra, ritual activity has less significance and a total effort is placed on the harnessing of one's contemplative energies. These three Tancras stress the outer aspect of one's life, whereas the higher Tantras (viz., Maha-, Anu-, and Ati-yoga-tancra), as preserved by the Nyingmapa, stress the inner and mys-t:ic aspects. As a process that elucidates ways of achieving freedom through a growing realization of being, Tan era is as old as Buddhism itself. For instance, the Kriyatantra was explained by the Buddha at Benares (VaraQasi) and the Yogatantra was expounded by him in the Agnijvata (Jvilamukha) hills northeast of Punjab (Panjab). 60.

This 'continuous' and 'continuing' transmission of symbolic, oral and textual instruction thus serves as the source and fountainhead for all the lineages which subse-quently developed from the original esoteric teachings. By the fourteenth cemury, the six principal lineages of the So, Zur, Nub, Nyag, Ma and Rang had already undergone an extensive development, encompassing an enormous terrain of teachings designed for rapid progress along the spiritual path. At this time, the widely divergent trends within the Nyingma reached a point of synthesis in the life and work of one of the most renowned masters of the Nyingma lineage, Kun-mkhyen Klong-chen-rab-'byams-pa (1308-63). Long-chen-pa studied with mariy of the most exemplary Masters of his time, and, in his writings, he ordered the philosophical truths and psychological applications of the rDzogs-chen into a cohesive system. Although he was abbot of Samye monastery early in his life, he later declined his responsibilities In order to live more simply in the moun-tains of Tibet. There he practiced meditation in caves and hermitages and prepared his most profound and enduring treatises, composing many lucid and systematic commentaries on Mahayoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga. Despite the depth and complexity of these subjects, Long-chen-pa's works are exceptionally clear and are considered to be the most brilliant and original treatises in the whole of Tibetan literature. All of his writings are inspired by the Dzog-chen teachings as revealed in his exhaustive mDzong-bdun (\"Seven Treasures\") and the sNying-thig ya-bzhi, which describe the outer, inner and secret meanings ofSadhana practice, oral teaching and initiation. All together, he wrote well over two hundred works, of which twenty-five survive today. Revered as an incarnation of Mafijusri and a manifestation of the Indian master Vimalamitra, Long-chen-pa was honored by the distin-guished tide of 'Kun-khyen', which means 'omniscient'. He spent his last years repairing the Stu pas near Samye and meditating in the cave at Chim-phu which was formerly used by Padmasambhava, and there, through visionary experiences, received personal instructions from Guru Rinpoche who revealed to him some of the Terma which had been concealed for dissemination in his time. When Long-chen-pa was fifty-six yea.l:s old, he gave his students their final instructions and passed away. At that time, according to his biography, it was winter in Tibet and ice and snow covered the entire country, but at the place where Long-chen-pa died, seven earthquakes shook the ground, the air was filled with music, the snows melted and flowers blossomed."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Natural Freedom of Mind 115 Four centuries later, another Nyingma lama, )igs-med-gling-pa (1728-98), received meditative visions (dag-snang) of Long-chen-pa who inspired him to compile the Nying-thig teachings into a collection of thirty-four volumes which are now known as the · rNying-ma'i rgyud-'bum. The Nying-thig is the simplest yet most sophisticated and potent of all Buddhist teachings. While they su,rely elucidate the subtle movements within one's meditative practice and lead to a freedom that is the ultimate expression of enlightenment, they are, at the same time, traditionally considered to be inaccessible to those who might approach them with insufficient preliminary training. Soon, with Dr. Guenther's assistance, we are also planning to publish a translation of Long-chen-pa's Sems-yid ngal7gso, a work in the lam-rim style, which cham one's quest for 'absolute fullness of life' through a poetic and systematic presentation ofNyingma thought.

TARTHANG TULKU Translator's Introduction The Natural Freedom of Mind by Klong-chen rab-'byams-pa is the first work in a trilogy [skor-gsum] that has as one of its major themes the problem of Freedom. Although in its English translation the title appears to be very simple and straightforward, the original Tibetan version [sems-nyid rang-grot] points to a profound philosophical insight. 'Freedom' [rang-grot] is not an evanescent sentiment, but an 'exis-tential' reality and as such not so much a final state or achievement, but rather a beginning and a continual presence, only to be lost the moment it is interfered with. Similarly 'Mind' [sems-nyid] is not conceived of in the manner of an individual mind as a subject or self which perceives, feels, imagines, and reasons, or as a metaphysical substance which is contrasted with matter or material substance. Rather, to borrow a term from science, it is the 'Energy' that suffuses the whole of what we term reality. Thus again, it is 'existential' in a primary sense and, consequently, 'Mind' or, more precisely, 'Mind-as-such' [sems-nyid] is antecedent, while 'mind' [sems] is derivative."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"116 Teachings Therefore, Mind-as-such is not merdy an attribute of something else. To speak of it as self-existent and naturally free does not mean that in its Being it is dependent on its apprehension by a mind. Any apprehensive awareness implies Being, but the implication is neither of an antecedent nor of a consequent. 'Awareness' and 'Being' are like the two sides of a coin, to which a third consideration can be added, namely, that Being remains constant or 'invariant' despite the fact that it may appear at certain times as this or that which in its apparent or seeming existence is variable and relative to everything else. Its invariableness remains unaffected by its changing modes, 'self-same' ( mnyam-nyid] and naturally free. From this follows the logical order of K.long-chen rab\"'byams-pa's trilogy: while every cognition is a mode of consciousness or a mind [semi] as ordinarily understood, the awareness in knowing or Mind-as-such [sems-nyid] is not identical with mind whose existence is a mode of seeming. Hence the first work is specifically entitled 'The Natural Free-dom of Mind-as-such' [sems-nyid rang-grol]. The awareness in knowing or Mind-as-such is also an awareness of the reality of Being [chos-nyid], not merely a cognition of this or that particular existent [chos} which exists only in dependence upon its being C()11ceived. Hence the second work is entitled 'The Natural Freedom of the Absolutely Real' [chos-nyid rang-grot}. Inasmuch as Mind-as-such and the awareness of the reality of Being constitute the 'invariant' in the flux of phenomena, the third work, 'The Natural Freedom of the Self-sameness of Being' [mnyam-nyid rang-grot} is the logical conclusion. This work, 'The Natural Freedom of Mind', is divided into three sections: the foundation, the progress, and the climax. In the first section Klong-chen rab-'byams-pa elucidates the existential reality of Mind-as-such, ever present, but never caught. The second section deals with 'meditation' which is understood as a free performance, not as a mechanical fixation of the mind on some object, which, as a matter of fact, is the abolition of freedom. The last section climaxes in a vision of reality vibrant with life. HERBERT V.

Listen to my explanation of how I have understood the freedom of Mind-as-such [sems-nyid ], this marvelous ruler holding sway over appearance and mind without subjective tendencies and in primeval freedom, from its vantage-point of self-sameness, the unoriginatedness of all that is. The Foundation Pure vision has neither limiting periphery nor fixed center. It cannot be shown as this or that; it is neither wide nor narrow, neither high nor low; it is beyond eternalism and nihilism, and free from the taint of the four extremes of judgments. If one searches for it one does not find it and when one looks for it one does not see it. Free from opposites and restrictions, and beyond all objects of thought, it has nothing to do with philosophical systems, with void or non-void, and has nothing before it that .could be calculated by understanding or non-understanding. Since all that is has been from all beginning in a state of abso-luteness [ byang-chub ], 1 it has never come into existence nor has it ceased to exist and so defies articulation in word and thought. Since this absolute perfection in self-sameness [mnyam-rdzogs]-in which there is no reference whatsoever to something termed impure, pure-impure, and naturally pure-has never been in a state of bondage and in a state of having been freed, there is no coming or going or staying to it."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"118 Teachings In chis state that feels like an appanuon of a subject-object division with its postulates of appearance and openness of being, SaCJlsara and Nirvar:ta, happiness and suffering are like pleasant and unpleasant dreams.

It is from that state that the mutual conditioning of origination and cessation stems which is like a dream, an apparition, an illusion, a phantasma, an echo, a reflection-with no substance to it. Since all that is, and about which one speaks of, origination and so on, has never originated, it never ceases to exist. And throughout the three aspects of time it does not seep out of itself into something ocher nor does it change into something other than itself. Not coming from somewhere, not going somewhere, and not staying somewhere, it is like a dream or an apparition. The belief in an ego or Self as something abiding in this flux of appearance which ignorant people desire to be real, breaks in the same way as the spell of an apparition, were one to touch the young girl in the apparition. Although unreal in view of its deceptiveness, appear-ance is causally effective as long as it appears. The worlds of the six kinds of beings as well as the Buddha-fields are not an agglomeration of acorns, but the mere self-manifestations of Mind in the minds of sentient beings. Just as in a dream Buddhas and ordinary beings seem to be real and immeasurable, when one wakes up they are but a momentary thought1 Know SaCJlsara and Nirvar:ta to be like this. There is no openness of Being apart from the appearance of Being; they are one like fire and its nature, heat. The claim that they are different is made by the intellect. The water and the moon's reflection in it are indivisibly one in the well; so also appearance and openness are one in the absolutely real. This appearance which has never come into existence as some-thing other than itself, i.e., Being, is like a reflection of flawless, naturally pure absoluteness of Being [chos-kyi sku].2 Since the postulates of the intellect about its existence or non-existence are deviations from reality, do not concretize what appears into something ultimately real."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Samantabhadra, the primordial Buddha"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"120 Teachings The apparent object is an image of the mind, like the reflection of the face in a mirror.

It is like the appearance of a reflection in a mirror or in the water of the ocean.

Since everything is but an apparition perfect in being what it is, having nothing to do with good or bad, acceptance or rejection, one may well burst out in laughter. Appearance and subjective mind are darkish, evanescent, unclear, dim and discontinuous, but chat which is wide-open and genuine is unconcerned with whatever appears, be it this or that or may it seem as this or that: it is Dharmakaya independent of an intellect which is moving in the confines of a 'this is it' and 'this it is not'. That which has nothing to show for itself is but a random appearance. When the noetic capacity that is not a subjective phenomenon is free in non-duality, all that appears as the world of appearances and the mind perceiving it, is the greatness of the creative playfulness of mind. In Mind-as-such which is not an entity and has no other ground or root than itself, all qualities are complete in uncreatedness and spontaneity. Since negation and affirmation are free in Dharmakaya, the individual mind finds happiness. All .intentional objectifications are artificial. When there are no intentional objectifications there is pristine awareness. Since acceptance and rejection have lost their coerciveness in freedom, the mind finds happiness; since acceptance and rejection have lost their coerciveness in freedom, one has passed beyond the object of thought. The whole of Buddhahood, naturally pure, is not to be found anywhere else than in one's mind as Mind-as-such. That which is sought is not found apart from the seeker. It is similar to an apparition or the water in a mirage. The belief in the duality of Sarpsara and Nirvat:la, which are not two, ceases in genuine, self-existing intrinsic perception. He who has"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 Teachings seen che existential identity of all chat is and has understood that Mind-as-such is like the unborn sky, goes to the realm of the identity of spontaneity and perfection, which is unborn and is the field where appearance and its possibility, the world and the beings therein, are pure in themselves. Since the mere face of a world of appearance and a mind perceiv-ing it is an open dimension, it is what is meant by Dharmakaya, and since its actual presence is unceasing and thus the manifestation of Sambhogakaya, by knowing its distinct features in their multiplicity as Nirmal).akaya, everything turns out to be the pure field of the three lci.yas and their pristine cognitions. Since there is no more tendency to reject what is artificially contrived, the individual mind is happy. Ah! friends, as long as they reside in Sarpsara which is like a dream or an error, the beings are caught in the net of cause and effect in Sarpsara by the belief in duality. By conditioning themselves to the conceptless substratum awareness, they err into the world of formless-ness; by conditioning themselves to the radiant awareness as an open substratum, into the world of forms; and by conditioning themselves to the six sense-patterns, into the world of desires. Those who desire liberation on the stairs of the world fashioned by the mind, must enter the peace where mind is inactive, the real and uncreated peace. The common noetic capacity, original and not stained, is free in itself as it is not vitiated by the belief in the duality of Sarpsara and Nirv:lr)a. Since it is free in itself, the moment it settles itself, then, in the sphere of Dharmakaya which has no conceptual division in its presence, there is Sambhogakaya as a radiant and open, unceasing starting-ground. If there issue manifestations and one is certain about them as NirmaiJ.akaya free in its rising, one is certain about the idea of Sarpsara becoming Nirval).a.

Nothing else can be shown; the very essence of what has risen as spontaneous intrinsic perception, has settled in itself-do not vitiate it. When all that is has no substance, mind, no longer grasping, like the sky, has neither circumference nor center. Although this peace that cannot be grasped by negations or affirmations, rises in an uncreaced and unceasing way, know it as never stepping out of itself or turning into something other than itself throughout time. The genuine pristine awareness in which the object and the mind are not two, is revealed in understanding, but not as some thing. The real Mind-as-such is beautiful in itself. Steady concentration, scrutiniz-ing discrimination, instructions and teachings are mere objects of understanding. They can never reach the naked pristine awareness. Although one may point co the sky with one's finger and say 'this is it', one's lived space like the sky is not an object one sees, but merely a differentiation. When by the grace of the Guru this experience rises as one's intrinsic understanding, the event is like the sun dispelling darkness. Simultaneously with the vision of reality as Dharmakaya in an instantaneous intrinsic perception, unknowing and the emo-tions become pristine awareness. Blessed by not being swayed by concrete things, one attains in this life the ordinary and supreme accomplishments. Fools hate the world and seek Nirval).a, but never reach it. Having cast away the real jewel, they take up so~e substance that has to be cleaned, and when they have removed the dirt, they have merely found a glass trinket.

The sphere of the actuality of everything remaining what it is in utter perfection is a brilliant light that comes in a flash, and in whatever fashion it may shine forth, it remains the absolutely real. Since emotions and their counterpart are not two entities when the radiant light, as an intrinsic perception that has no limits or a center, is present, rejection and what tends towards it, detachment and attainment, expectation and fear become free by themselves. By not knowing the figure of speech of calling a jewel a lamp, one hankers after the light of the lamp rather than looking for the jewel. If one does not differentiate between the sentiment of freedom and the intellectual concentration on it, one fetters oneself by hankering after what is in itself free-rising. If one does not distinguish between a sentiment and real under-standing, one mistakes the habitual sentiment for understanding. After a real understanding there is no longer any good or evil movement or change. From habituation to this there comes the feeling of value. Just as in space the four elements evolve, yet space is never disturbed but stays like the blue sky, so also in the understanding of Mind-as-such there is no good or evil understanding even if one has the feeling of increase or decrease. If there is good or evil then there is sentimentality, not understanding. Search for the real understanding and stay with what is not disturbed. Attention to this is the real vision and the person of highest intellectual acumen is freed in seeing it. Independent of habitual sentiments the all-encompassing understanding arises.

In its sphere of pristine awareness overcoming the delusive appearances, intrinsic perception coming in the wake of the pristine awareness arises in absolute freedom. Until true understanding becomes the creative center, let your mind be like a jackal's eye, not distinguishing between day and night. When through habitualness and acceptance your realization is like the meeting between a mother and her child, everything will arise in unitary vastness. Intrinsic perception without partiality has neither a periphery nor a center and should be left to itself like the celestial space that cannot be pointed out as tthis is it'. Intrinsic perception with nothing to meditate upon has as its content that which is not artificial. Intrinsic perception that arises by itself rises from its own depth. That which is free from pollution by the emotions is an absolute self-luster, and intrinsic perception which is this luminosity should be left to itself like the ocean.

In this sphere of continuous meditation when no alteration of states of consciousness is observed, diligently exercise the creative power to true understanding. Since there is nothing co accept or reject in dealing with all that is as an apparition, even detrimental conditions as part of the path leading to the spiritual gain of true understanding become the path; and in order to fuse the concentrative and post-concentrative states, dance and sing and indulge in all sorts of thoughts when you have come to places where the mind is agitated by objects such as mountain-peaks, crema-tion grounds, islands, trade-fairs and so on; and, each moment free in itself, vision and attention to it fuse. Afterwards everything has become the way. But in the meantime the world of appearances, the devotion to the Guru, the accumulation of merits, the removal of intellectual and emotional obscurations, the meditation on imper-manence and death-all the realities of the world of appearances are like a dream, an apparition, an echo, a mirage, a reflection, a magic show. Since it is but a mirage or the moon's reflection in water, while nothing as such, do not for a moment concretize whatever appears in this darkness of untruth, When one exercises the fusion of the concentrative and post-concentrative states, undisturbed by day or night, there comes a state of happiness, translucence and undividedness, present as such and free in its emergence. When the medication present by itself is not inter-rupted, the delusive dream that constitutes our world with no truth to it turns into a radiant light and in the fusion of day and night, Sarp-sara and Nirv:iQa lose their coercive hold in freedom. While vision involves duration, meditation-restlessness, enact-ment-conditions, and fruition-fallacy, true understanding stays in undivided pristine awareness, never stepping out of itself nor changing into something other than itself. At that time there is only one reality and one has firmly seated oneself in what is not something to be meditated upon in its primordial state.

The yogi who in his lifetime has won this freedom, will have the experience of the dissolution of the constituting elements of solidity, coherence, temperature, movement and consciousness in a radiant light, and when pristine awareness as.the subjective pole has thus fused with the aesthetic continuum as the objective pole,5 he has seated himself firmly in his primordial place. The two existential patterns6 that are there for others are formu-lations of pristine awareness, and their appearance before the beings like a dream is their necessary value. This is the actuality of intrinsic awareness and the mystery of mind; in a moment it is there as the peak of utter freedom. Its increasing value is like the waxing of the moon from its first day to its fifteenth day. Although there may seem such an increase in this world, actually there is neither increase nor decrease. Similarly, although one may exercise oneself in habitually· seeing true under-standing, true understanding itself does not move, and this absence of movement is the value of habituating oneself to it. The brighter the moon the smaller the shadow or, as others say, the smaller the shadow the brighter the moon; so also true under-standing increases by the waning of the belief in duality or, by the increase in true understanding, the emotions grow less disturbing. Even if one says that the values of renunciation and of true under-standing reach their climax, the fact is that the pure fact of Being remains unchanged, its actual presence never stops, and the absolutely real remains pure in its freedom of conditions assuming many forms. In brief, until the emotions become true understanding there is no other way but to give up these five poisons. If one does not know this mystery of our existence free in itself, one is deceived by the belief in the duality of the emotions and their counterparts. When in the end the subject-object duality does not lose its coercive hold in freedom, however loudly one may speak, it is but the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Natural Freedom of Mind 133 voice of Mara; however po~itive one's concentration may be, it is but the result of a former pleasant feeling; however much one may exert oneself, one merely moves within the confines of cause and effect belonging co Saq1sara. Better it is co broaden the vision, co attend to it in all details and to enact it without coercion and purposiveness. When, in this wide sphere where there is no duality between what arises and its freedom in rising, things are allowed to rise in such a way that they have nothing to show for themselves, this becomes the sign that the yogi has crossed the ocean of worldliness. He is not fettered by the object and he has no attachment to the subject. Everything, perfect in its self-sameness, becomes the blissful center of creativeness as Dharmakaya. He has no fear in crossing a mountain pass, in traversing a valley or passing over an abyss, and having reached his destination-he has left all expectations and appre-hensions behind. In such a practice there are four experiences which come with the intensity of warmth felt in pursuing the path that has nothing to do with subjectivism: a) When all the preconditions for this practice are present due to one's merits acquired through previous positive actions and the Guru's compassion and one's knowledge about the appropriate time and the means, then there comes the visionary experience of the immediately intuited absolutely real [chos-nyid mngon-sum] at the moment when one truly understands the self-existing intrinsic perception unlimited in its scope to be without trends in its free rising. b) When one has found, by the investigation of what appears as the without and the within, that everything is Dharmakaya, there are no longer such contrivances as acceptance or rejection with respect to_ whatever may manifest itself, and when this unique creativeness of truly understanding everything is present and becomes ever more intense, such detrimental conditions as the without and the within, negation and affirmation become the path. There is freedom in its rising and happiness in its presence, and when through its practice various values inherent in intrinsic perception such as the divine eye,"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"134 Teachings the higher cognitions and mystical powers are manifest, one will know this as the visionary experience of intensification of the experience [nyams-snang gong-'phet). c) When this practice growing ever more intensive has become the central force, intrinsic perception-luminous and open and a bare pristine awareness-is ever like a stream, there being neither elation nor depression, neither agitatedness nor non-agitatedness, neither a concentrative nor a post-concentrative state. When its value, the feeling of warmth has reached its highest degree, one has the visionary experience of intrinsic perception having reached its limits [rig-pa tshad-'phebs]. d) When one no longer moves from this state and does not find anything determinate to ding to, one is beyond the object of one's desire that falls within the range of renunciation and of what leads to it. Everything is perfect in its self-sameness and has nothing about it conducive to purposeful clinging. When preoccupation with the things of the without and the within has subsided, one has the visionary experience of what is meant by the end of the absolutely real [chos-nyid zad-pa]. Thereafter intrinsic perception has reached its culmination in the ground (of Being], and the form-patterns of beings pass into Dharma-lciya. In this freedom that is beyond appearance and nothingness one has seated oneself firmly in one's primordial place. When one has become accustomed to these experiences, the path of one's spiritual progress will not fail and can be illustrated by three features of dreaming: 1) When a bad dream is turned into a good one by ones having become accustomed to the free rising of the world of appearances and the mind perceiving it, there is. as its sign the unique flavor of positiveness since the evil katma has been wiped out. This is like smoke rising from a fire or a sprout coming from a seed. 2) As for the simultaneity of the grasping of the dream image and the momentary feeling of freedom, which comes through further ha-bituating oneself to this experience, there is as its sign the freedom"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Natural Freedom of Mind 135 resulting from the counteragent to dreaming having lost its coercive hold. 3) Lastly, when one is fully accustomed to the experience having become the center of the spiritual life, dreaming is stopped and day and night there is present the experience of a radiant light and its sign is the fact that all concepts of Sarpsara have completely disappeared. Since there is a unitary feeling in what is by itself beyond frus-tration, one is now close to seating oneself firmly in one's primordial place. As the three gates to the three world-spheres have found their freedom in the three existential patterns, one passes into a peace that is not restricted to a realm of quietness. In Mind-:1;5-such which from the very beginning has had nothing co do with proof or disproof, its genuine realm, which is not in need of counceragents against artificiality, presents itself spontaneously with-out there being anything to meditate upon or anyone medicating, when it has been freed from all bias. · Thus the noetic capacity in its ordinary self-existing freedom has passed beyond the confines of subject and object, no without or within being discernible. In itself free of negation and affirmation, it presents itself as genuineness and is free in having nothing to show for itself in such a way as to make it possible to say that whatever it may be it will be this or that. This all-encompassing pristine awareness in which there is no need for acceptance or rejection, is spontaneous, unlimited bliss that is nowhere found as something. Absolute freedom resting in its primal freedom cannot be concretized into all and everything or into being and non-being, having nothing to show for itself and not grasping subjectively. Ah! since intrinsic perception, operating effortlessly, is thor-oughly free from any one-sidedness since its very beginning, it remains free in its sphere of self-sameness. Since as the ruler, perfect in sponta-neity, it has never been born nor will ever cease, it stays nowhere, cannot be obj~ctified, and is in itself ineffable, so everything is this sphere of uncontrived genuineness."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"136 Teachings Ah! intrinsic perception comes laughing at the miracle of ap-pearance that has since its beginning been pure in itself.

In this unique state where appropriate means [thabs] and appre-ciative awareness [shes-rab r are perfect in their self-sameness, every-thing is motionless and remains in the self-sameness of reality. In this state no planets and stars are observed, no minutes counted; it is beyond time and the connections with it; the four continents are absent; there is no world-mountain nor are there sun and moon; there are no ma~<;lalas nor is there a recitation of mantras nor a practice of austerities; there are no objects and there is nothing of mystical channels [rtsa], predispositions [khams] and focal points ['khor-lo]. Since the external world is not objectified into something in its appearance, the five objects in the sphere of the world are essentially nothing as such. Nothing has ever come into existence, but all that is is a self-existing divine mansion; its creator is not objectively observed, but he is the real divine force [lha]. The coming and going of thoughts is the great play of pristine awareness; the objects before the mind are the douds of offering; pristine awareness is divine worship; the assembly of divine forces is perfect in spontaneity, words are mantras, the emotions become forms of pristine awareness; the state of fulfillment [rdzogs-rim] being self-existent, need not be reached but is in itself spontaneously present. The state of transcendence [pha-rol-phyin-pa] in which the spiri-tual levels and the spiritual paths are perfect in themselves is a state of pure unity that does not reside in a 'middle' [dbu-ma].

Since that which can be analyzed and that which cannot, black and white, good and evil, actions and their effects are all relative to each other, they are ultimately nothing as such, and without rejecting these images know them to be utter freedom that passes beyond everything."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Natural Freedom of Mind 137 Through good and evil actions the heights and depths of Sarp.sara are established; when one has gone beyond karma one has naturally passed beyond suffering. When one neither accepts nor rejects, one certainly becomes free from evil influences, but even if good should be realized, one should not fetter oneself by hankering after it. Then, instead of searching for the real that has nothing to do with acceptance or rejection, to attempt to establish logical proofs is to engage in meaningless, delusive, foolish things. Rather ·should one always listen to and think about the teaching by competent persons, and should attend to what is the unfailing preparation for true under-standing. In lonely places and mountain solitudes one should control the mind and be concerned with the ultimately real. Instilling the ideas of impermanence and of disgust with the world in one's mind, one should strive and realize the Dharma deep within one's heart. If now in this life one does not travel the path towards liberty, it may be difficult in the future to find again the favorable condition for becoming a human being. Having hoisted the banner of victory in solitude, what else is there to attain if you should die now? And while your bodily existence that is but an apparition may fade when day and night you thus strive for the ultimate, Mind-as-such, without birth and death, remains seated on the throne of unchanging Dharmakaya. This is the highest realization and the real meaning of life. Persons of mediocre and low intelligence may find freedom in the Bardo state or later reach the path leading to freedom from Sarp.sara when each action has its result, and when Mind-as-such remains firmly seated in great bliss; this is the quintessence of certainty. Having set out on a path that leads to error one will never find the essentially and absolutely real because of the many pitfalls on this path. If one succumbs to this life, the future has no meaning. Therefore seek a vision that is unfailing and attend to it unceasingly.

When one busies oneself with a meditation on the without, on concrete entities and on what is in between, there is certainly no chance for a true understanding of non-duality. When one does not bother about renunciation, disgust with the world, and mortality, one is certainly fooled by the demon of desires for this life. When, in spice of medication, the values lying within us are not brought out, there certainly come the feelings of elation and depression reflecting the depth and thickness of pitfalls and obscurations. If insight [lhag-mthong} is not watered by tranquillity [zhi-gnas} it is a mere picture of understanding, but not insight. Although one may calk about non-duality as if it were an intellectual object, one merely associates with the five poisons, unable to deal with unfavorable conditions. And if tranquillity is not tempered with the creativeness of insight there is but a state of mental darkness, but not tranquillity. A concentration in which there is attachment, even if it is of a positive nature, remains a meditation resulting in animal states because the precondition for higher states is saturated with feelings of elation and depression. But when there is never any attachment there is the creativeness of pristine awareness operating through insight. Since this has been pointed out by competent persons, every form of meditation becomes an aid to enlightenment when there is the true understanding of the immaculate. An uncontrived happiness, translucence and undi-videdness rise from the depth of one's being. Anything chat is not this is not the absolutely real and certain.

Even if one brandishes the spear of a glittering and brilliant perception in which all concepts have been suppressed when the posture of the body has been straightened, speech restrained and mind brought under control, simply by having suppressed ideas and feelings in the subjective sphere, this perception moves within the area of the four concentrations, the formless worlds and Sarpsara. Where the apparent object before the senses, the luminous ap-pearance without interfering concepts and the five emotional poisons, is naturally free, there is the sphere of absolute pristine awareness. In this preoccupation with what has to be renounced in the subtle aspect of their perception subject to elation and depression and an intermediate phenomenon, these asses are eager to make renunciation by referring to what is to be renounced as subtle, coarse an~ crude. They inspect a former cognitive situation by a subsequent one and, counting the number of these situations as they come and go, in mere sentimentality declare this to be the vision of the genuine. Such meditation which considers the prolongation of the passage of concepts as the real non-duality, is plain error. However much they may exert themselves, the fact is that when out of this network of concepts a later one emerges, a previous one has faded and the claim to natural freedom remains in the before and after, but is not natural freedom. Indulgence in the pleasures of the senses in following the path of action [thabs-lam] is usually the cause for going into evil forms of life because of the attachment to sensuality. Even if one obtains a happy form of life one is born in a lowly status. To say that yoga is the only possible way, is a mark of having gone astray and of being engulfed in obscurations.

If only all would attain the unerring path and find freedom accordingly! The path that is unerring is the greatness of the openness of Being and compassion united; freedom at every moment, present in itself, is the path of Dharmakaya. The self-sameness of tranquility which is just being present is the 'means' [thabs], and of pure insight which in constantly arising is appreciative discrimination [shes-rab], is, in the unity of the two, self-settled, free from all artifacts. What is disturbing through change is overcome by steadiness. In what way this state, in which there is neither elation nor depression and in which the emotions have been uprooted, may mani-fest itself, it is Dharmakaya, naturally free; in what way it may be present, this state of self-sameness, where no duality obtains, is the peacefulness of Mind-as-such, when there is no need to accept or to reject. Let this practice through which one accustoms oneself to the pristine awareness dealing with the absolutely real, the genuine fact of Being, proceed uninterruptedly.

Freedom throughout the three aspects of time is the completeness of the Tripiraka; purity of the three gates of action in body, speech and mind is the purity of the three trainings in self-discipline, mind-control, and appreciative discrimination; all-liberation is the enactment of real-ity, and true Understanding taking charge of our life is the supreme yoga. The fourfold classification of Tantra distributed over nine grada-tions: Srivakas and Pratyekabuddhas are concerned with their own problems, followers of the Mahayana with those of others (as well); true understanding belongs to the Kriya, familiarization with it to the Upa; enactment to Yoga; appropriate means and appreciative discrim-ination are distributed over the Maha and Anu; and perfection in itself belongs to the Ati, and they have mantras and contemplations sustained by pristine awareness.

Since the ordinary mind with its mental events and host of categorical thoughts makes its appearance out of the playful creativeness of the absolute in 'impure' (i.e., postulational) forms, it is not the byang-chub sems, and since it contradicts the latter in view of the fact that it belongs to Sarpsara, there is a great difference between creativeness as such and the play that seems from creativeness.\" The division into impure, pure-impure and naturally pure is a reference to the Uttaratantrasastra I 47. 2.

This is one of the most important truths we can discover. In the beginning we can only point this out with words. But once we remove all our fixed patterns of perceiving and behaving, our own natural being is already present. When bees extract the nectar from flowers they do not destroy the flower. The flower is there and they leave it there. Similarly, we leave behind our concepts, emotions and ideas -and particularly our ego and self-image-and just use their energy co become meditation. We might think, \"I can concentrate, practice visualization, and develop my awareness. I may stop thoughts or watch thoughts, or tran-scend all my emotions.\" But when we are in the meditative state, tech-niques are not very important. Just remain in that calmness state.

Imaginations, fantasies, confusions, experiences of darkness and dull-ness, and so-called 'problems' arise because we are not in the meditative state. Once we learn to meditate properly, we do not need to worry. Doubts and questions drop away. There are many different ways I can say 'this is meditation' or 'this is not meditation', but this will not necessarily help you. When our body is calm, our senses become quieter. The breath is quiet, the muscles loosen, and our mind naturally becomes meditation. But if we create many inner dialogues, interpretations and qualifications, we only disturb our inner stillness. When you meditate, you do not need to grasp, interpret, or judge anything. Once you properly accept yourself and your situation, you can meditate any place, any time. This is what I am trying to point out to you. Whatever situation you are in, try to learn from it rather than escaping or refusing to deal with it. There is really no way we can ultimately escape facing ourselves and taking responsibility for our actions and the qualiry of our everyday awareness. More important than 'happiness' is balance-balance, between your body and mind, and between you and your world. Certain kinds of intellectual knowledge may require books and extensive preparation before mastery. But meditation does not neces-sarily depend on anything ocher than our own understanding. The person who is very intelligent, very clear and intuitive, may directly penetrate the meditative state. However, to practice sincerely and de-votedly, deep study of the Buddha's teachings will provide much useful knowledge. The more you study, the more you practice, the more you inwardly understand what 'natural being' means without any further preparation. The following short talks were given at the Nyingma Institute during classes and seminars, and after ceremonies at the Tibetan N ying-ma Meditation Center. These talks are not necessarily sophisticated or intended to present specific philosophical viewpoints, but just what I feel is necessary to say at this time in America. Once you have a preliminary understanding and direct experience of the basic teachings, then you can increase your knowledge by studying the Abhidharma, the Yogacara, Vijfianavada, Madhyamika and Prajfiaparamira. Traditionally, certain teachings are presented priva!ely to insure full comprehension, but first it is necessary to learn how to practice meditation properly and to extend the meditation into everything you do.

Otherwise we may become fixed in habitual patterns-frustrated, bored or depressed. If we have some idea of where we are traveling, then the terrain seems more familiar. How does one start to meditate? Someone who is not accustomed to meditation often feels it is something foreign, unusual, unnatural. He may feel that meditation is something outside, an experience to be achieved ... that meditation is somehow separate from the person, another facet of Eastern psychology or philosophy to study and explore. Meditation, though, is not necessarily something foreign, separate or external. Meditation is within your own mind ... your whole mind's nature can be your: meditation. Most human knowledge is expressed in dualistic terms-subject and object. We always need to experience 'out there' conceptually. We want to find out something and internally report it back to ourselves. We need to explain our world. But look at it this way ... to whom do we need to explain it? The explanation immediately separates us from the experience. The more we try to interpret the experience, the more we move away from it. We are left with a fixation, some idea con-cerning the nature of our world, so that our responses and reactions to daily situations do not flow from a natural state of mind. We are always walking outside the wall, just touching the surface, so we do not discover this natural mind. We may spend a long time, years and years, explaining, thinking, analyzing and feeling, but never reach that nat-ural state. By properly meditating, we can find it, because meditation is the natural state of mind. Starting to meditate is very simple ... just let the body and mind become very relaxed. As much as possible, physically relax your muscles and thoughts ... not a tight relaxation, but completely loose. The same with your breath-breathe openly and quietly. Actually, there are many techniques, different ways to breathe or visualize or sit.

So just very naturally, experience your body, your breach and your mind. (Natural' means (unfixed' ... no expectations, no compulsions, no interpretations, no predetermined plans. When meditation deepens, there is no need to fix it or improve it or perfect it. There is no impatience to go forward or somehow progress, yet everything moves on naturally. This has nothing co do with this or chat philosophy, belief or condition, but is the natural state of reality for all of us. This meditation can deeply affect our whole being. Later on, an 'enlightenment-quality', or a spontaneous inner awareness, will arise without any creator or manipulator. But we need to take the first step by simply and quietly meditating. Since mind, in its true nature, is without duality, not separate from the unity of all things, our whole life may become medication. Once we understand this, we won't need co fight or push or struggle. Ego and the emotions, discriminations of good or bad, positive or negative, spiritual path or Samsara-chey all dissolve. Once we have the experience, spontaneous awareness arises by itself, without effort. So medication begins by making everything tranquil ... by al-lowing our body and mind to relax deeply and completely, by giving ourselves warmth and nourishment. If you can be very calm and still, and listen to the silence within your mind ... this becomes your medication. Even if you are not formally meditating, but just dealing with everyday situations, try to remain loose and relaxed. Each day we reinforce a variety of muscular and mental tensions ... we feel unhappy and dissatisfied, trapped and walled in by our problems. As the mind builds up the specific world in which we live, habits, desires and judgments become very solid and real to us. Soon we may find we cannot let go of this solid world: we cannot go back to a natural state of awareness or co simple direct experience. During meditation, we can simply focus on th~ p~esenc moment in itself and keep our attention there. By just being there our awareness becomes sharper, looser and more calm. Giving ourselves warmth and nourishment is much more than just being relaxed. It is a feeling that we can heal all our difficulties by simply letting go, letting everything be just as it is. At first we may feel very calm and peaceful, but then a voice inside us-a speaker, a judge -rises to the surface and creates disturbances, and we lose our inner silence.

We are always interpreting and adjusting our inner feelings, separating ourselves from the immediate moment and holding on to temporary sensations which seem to make things better.

Within this all-pervasive aware-ness, emotional conflicts and problems begin to lose their holding power and become very cloudlike. Once you stop feeding the problems, they just disappear within awareness itself. There is another type of meditation in which you visualize or fix some image before the mind. Then you simply watch the im.age with complete attention. By staying within the immediate moment, it is possible to enter the space between thoughts. Bur this practice is, in a way, very difficult because t~oughts, emotions and fixed concepts always attempt to define, change or control the natural process. Then meditation becomes a struggle. We say, \"I should stay with this one image,\" yet at the same time, we lose ourselves in endless distractions. Then I have another idea of what I should be doing ... so one thought stands on another thought, and the cycle keeps repeating itself, back and forth, until there is no meditation ... just thoughts. In the end, we have only acted out an elaborate internal game, without ever having begun to meditate. We can play these games within our own minds all our lives, but you should know that nothing meaningful will result. First we need to observe and identify the deceptions created by our self-image. Until we can see through the mind's posturings and pretenses-all our explanations and excuses-we are only playing ... we are only trying to satisfy the demands of our self-image without any feeling of real fulfillment. We may often 'talk' about our intrinsic self-nature, but still we cannot see it clearly. We are always playing some game of identifying, separating, acting or posturing. Ideas and explanations generate new ideas and explanations. Our minds go this way and that way ... is this a game or not? Until you can look backwardly at your thoughts, you will not be able to tell. But when you look directly at the patterns of your thoughts and concepts, you may be able to observe the game-player playing the game. From moment to moment-is this our true nature or is this just another game we are playing? This process of observation is very important because as long as thought vibrations continue to play, our consciousness remains frozen in fixed views. For example, as soon as I hit a gong, sound comes ... as soon as I hear a word, an image is immediately projected and concep-tualized. Bur behind the word or the image is an experience with very"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Bringing the Teachings Alive 153 precise and exact feeling-tones. By staying within the immediate moment, it is possible to enter the space between thoughts. Once you go 'behind' or 'within' this experience, without involving words, images or concepts, you may discover a certain type of inner atmo-sphere or environment which has no shape, no form, no specific characteristic, no specific structure. In other words, you do not need to defend or belong to any position. If there is any position-a holding position, an examining position, or any kind of ideal or 'beyond' position ... or even a 'lostness' position-\"Oh, I am lost, my mind is lost, there is nothing but emptiness\"-you are still referring to some-thing which is ultimately related to 'me'. If you think about it, you will find that any position belongs to ego. The famous 19th-century Nyingma master, Pal-trul Rinpoche, once said, \"Completely break, cut up, throw away meditation.\" In other words, as long as you have any concepts of meditation, throw tbem away. If any kind of 'experience' comes, throw it away, don't hold on ... and that is the best way to meditate. Many yogis love deep meditative states, but they can easily become addicted to them: \"I have a powerful meditation,\" or, \"I have many beautifu~, dream-like experiences\" ... they are really only stuck there. On the other hand, Pal-trul said, \"The best water is rocky water.\" Why is rocky water the best?-because when water falls from a great height, it is completely agitated and purified. Moving water takes no positions. So the best meditation is one which is flowing and free: there is nothing to hold on to. Once you have a position, you become fixated, you possess some-thing, you focus on something. When another Nyingma master was asked, \"You are concentrating, but where is your concentration?\" he answered that he has \"no position, no specific fixed place,\" because natural mind has no fixed ideas, no structure, no limitations. Whoever knows meditation well has no fixed position-no goals, no focusing, no subject. We often see and experience the world' and other people with rigid viewpoints, and so we set arbitrary limits and restrictions on ourselves. If we can't describe or label our experience with words or ideas, we feel lost or empty. We think, because this experience is not related to my senses, concepts, or projections, then it has no value. But according to the Madhyamika dialect~c, if we transcend dualism, go beyond objectifying concepts, beyond space and time, what is there to lose? If there is anything to lose, it may only be our fear, our fixed ideas,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"154 Teachings or a tense clinging to an imagined security. Since there is no posicion, the natural state of mind has nothing originally to lose. Even good meditators may spend twelve years in a cave-com-pletely quiet, with all the windows and doors shut-but still, their thoughts are just going back and forth and running on for a long, long period of time. If you don't learn to meditate properly or accurately, you can waste a lot of valuable time. But if you receive precise instructions, you can transmute many kalpas of negative karma in a very short time. For example, if you don't know how to produce atomic power, you might work for hundreds of years with nd result-no explosion. But if you have accurate knowledge, in a certain limited time you may produce a nuclear reaction. The simplest way to discover this secret <formula' or <path' that leads to successful, higher meditation is by not identifying, not taking a position, not holding on to anything within the meditation. If you chink, «I won't think anything,\" this too may cause blockages so that your muscles, nervous system or inner organs become tight and constricted. But someone who knows how to enter medication directly can transcend ordinary labels and concepts very quickly. This <secret' knowledge of proper medication becomes a self-sustaining source of inspiration which is not dependent on words, concepts or specific viewpoints ... there is no <center'. Many English words, such as <center' or <position' or <clarity' or <awareness', are useful but they are too vague to describe the internal process of meditation. For example,if I am <centered', it means I have a position, I belong to some <one'. Just forget about trying to identify or judge this <one'. Become centerless ... with no subject, no object, nothing in between. There is nothing between you and meditation ... the experience is always very new, very fresh, very dear, beautiful and natural .. beyond time ... but at the same time, there is continuity. Everything is just 'as it is'. No <one' is adding or subtracting anything. If you think about these qualities, then while practicing meditation you may un-derstand: not fixed, not projecting, no position, no center ... clarity, newness, naturalness. ~ut as long as words and explanations or doubts and anxiety continue to filter into your meditation, meditation is lost in that very moment.

When you study, or when yoti are just walking or sitting, stay in the spontaneous, present moment. Everything be-comes practice and preparation until you have complete confidence and there are no questions left. There is no need to ask, how is it? what is it? who is it? ... no need to report back to yourself elaborate and lengthy descriptions of your progress. Just meditate completely and directly without any restrictions or 'second thoughts'. Without this kind of inner attitude or character, enlightenment can be a very long process. Each day, moment to moment, expand your inner openness, and awareness will grow freely, naturally. There is no further preparation required. You may meditate back and forth for twenty years, or, in a very short moment of time, completely and accurately meditate with much quality and value. When you meditate with this openness, and when you leave all doubts and hesitation behind, you automatically begin to discover the teachings within through your own spontaneous inner guidance. On the other hand, you might ask, \"Why do we need the six perfections, why preliminary practice, why visualization?\" All these questions arise because we cannot directly penetrate the secret path of inner meditation. But once you understand meditation, once you have the key, you can intuitively remain in that state of awareness no matter what you do. Meditation is not just a technique or a way to escape this world. Meditation is like our parent, the original source of our being. We always live within this consciousness, for it is our intrinsic nature .. our own home and not a separate place. But usually we feel separate and don't realize this. If we learn to use meditation properly, we can touch our innermost being with no walls dividing ... we can come into coritact with our own wholeness.

Student 1: Yes, that was what I was trying to say, but when I did that, it would fed like I would go out of my body into a very more spacious way of being which felt strange to me."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"158 Teachings Rinpoche: All right ... but still, whenever you have feelings, it may be possible that your thoughts are sort of vibrating. If thoughts and concepts do not even exist, how can you have feelings? In other words, as soon as you recognize a feeling, you are already involved with a thought. If there is a recognition, then someone must be having that recognition. Do you understand what that means? Tell me. Student 1: It is the one who is watching the thoughts, or the one who perceives what is happening to oneself. Rinpoche: Right. You need to jump there, chase the face of the watcher. That's all. Do you understand? Directly chase there, not somewhere else ... in the very first moment ... Hke chasing a tiger. When you are chasing his face, there is no second thought. When you chase com-pletely, you become the experience. Both the chaser and the chased meet together and immediately become the experience. No other thought is involved. You are meeting face to face. If you do this with all thoughts, you will not miss anything. More intellectually we may say, \"My awareness recognizes.\" In this sense, your awareness has shape. It's like a shell, a specific form or a characteristic pattern with which you receive that thought. You need to chase that thought into this totality. The looker, seer, receiver, perceiver, recognizer ... just catch it! This immediately becomes the experience. There is no going 'this way' or 'that way'. Nothing is left behind. Every thought is received into this totality. No other thought exists. At that time-at that very moment-your awareness instantly becomes illuminated. There is no division between anything. There is no introducer and no introduced. That very first moment becomes the experience itself. Normally, you think thoughts as if they were coming from somewhere else. Thoughts do not come from some other place. For example, the recognizer catches a thought. But while he is chasing this thought, he is saying \"I am not the one who is chasing you, someone else is chasing you!\" This is very tricky. But actually, the first thought is already gone, and the experiencer is creating another thought. The experiencer himself is the thought. But the experiencer insists, \"I am not the one, I am not the one. You should ask someone else.\" But actually, the one who is giving answers-that's the one you need to catch. That's the one you need to chase and keep face-to-face. When you finally catch the thought, there is no longer any hunter. There is no longer any recognizer. The recognizer, the watcher, has become the experience."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Bringing the Teachings Ali11e 159 Student 2: If I give up trying to catch the thoughts that the recognizer is creating, is that the same thing as catching a thought? I mean, suppose I give up meditating entirely and forget all this. Will I be at the same place if I did this and succeeded? Rinpoche: No. I don't think you understand which thought you need to catch. I am trying to illustrate to you which one you need to bite into with your awareness. If you bite into the right thought, it has meaning and value. What you are saying is that whether you bite into the right thought or the wrong thought, your meditation is the same. It is not the same. let's say, t'I'm trying to watch any thought ... oh, there's a thought. I can see it. There it is. I need to catch it.\" Meanwhile, another thought comes ... because in order to catch it your way, there must be another thought. Otherwise you do not think you have caught it. That is your problem. You must create one thought in order to catch another thought. If there is no hand, how can you grasp? Another thought is there-who catches it? Then another thought-who catches that one? In this way, your thoughts are split every which way. This can go on endlessly and your meditation will never begin. I will try to explain this a little differently. I say I see my thought. But actually, you are not seeing the thought. There isn't any thought there. This is because the seer is self-manifesting. The seer is projecting the thought. The awareness is the awareness of a seer, not a thought. There isn't any thought. The way I see it and the way it is are two different things. Within that moment I can interpret: there is a thought-! can feel it, see it, project it and experience it happening. But the thought itself is actually a projection of the seer. The thought is not separate from the seer. Between the thought and the seer, there are no gaps, no words or concepts, no second thoughts. When you directly face the seer, your awareness and the seer become one. The shell which divides the subject from the object completely breaks open. All that is left is the experience itself, or, you might say, pure energy. Now how do you break that shell? We must think about this very intelligently-who sees? who is experiencing? Just sit very quietly, gently go inside, and watch the thought. When you totally become the seer, the seer no longer exists as a separate entity. Your awareness and the watcher become united. There is no separation or division, no subject or object. When this occurs, you naturally feel a surge of energy. No separate forms exist. You feel a kind of shock ... like a"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"160 Teachings bubble that expands and expands until it pops. When you watch the watcher, there is no longer any thought form. All that is left is meditation ... there is no subject, no object, no dual mind. The thought disappears and the watcher disappears. The mind is totally silent. Literally we are saying, watch the thought, but eventually you will understand that the thought and the watcher are the same. Watching the watcher immediately and directly leads to the experience itself. When you meditate or sit there, there is a kind of light, or energy, or awareness. Just stay there. That is your meditation. If you try to go beyond that, you will create another thought. When I'm calking, do you hear something? Then medicate on the hearer. Do you feel something? Then meditate on the feeler. Do you see something? Then meditate on the seer. As your awareness develops naturally, you will begin to understand there is really no watching and no watcher. When you have pain or unhappiness, or any problems, just stay within the thought. Whatever th0nghts come-good thoughts, bad thoughts, angry thoughts, confusec thoughts, or desires-become the anger, hecome tne confusion, become the attachment. Within the very first thought-moment, keep it alive, feel it. When you are emotionally upset, stay within the emotion. Try to do this. It is not very difficult. You do not need to escape or deny or hide from your feelings. At this time, do not try to research, analyze or figure out the pattern of your thoughts or problems, or try to create new thoughts. Just go into the center of tht. thought without trying to evaluate it. Just be the thought and completely accept it without grasping or holding on to it. Grad-ually a new awareness will develop inside this experience. Mostly we have the concept that meditation should be a certain way ... something calm, relaxed or beautiful. We fail to realize that meditation involves every mental event. When you are working or when you have strong emotions-as lo·1g as there is mind-still you can meditate. There is no specific time or place which necessarily excludes your meditation. · As your meditation deepens, the qualities of openness and clarity extend to whatever you do.

Therefore, whether you are 'officially' meditating or not does not matter. Actually, we are already meditating naturally. Our mind reality, which is like Buddha-mind-uncreated mind-exists totally awakened in the present moment. Since we are always within that true nature, we can always rely on it completely. Our basic 'not-knowing' is due to our conceptual mind, but conceptual mind cannot judge this intrinsic reality. For example, I am dreaming: I have a child and he is dying. I'm crying and screatning. But there is a man over there s~ying, \"Don't worry, you never had a child, the child has never died, don't be so upset!\" And still I say, ''That's not true, I still have a child .... \" Even if someone from another realm talks to me in the dream state, until I wake up, my suffering is still there-even if it is not true! I never had a child, but it doesn't matter. I am still suffering! Even if you are suffering, you don't have a child! You could say, \"If I am already enlightened, why do I need these things?\" But ... you are still suffering. Until you become free, you need to do these things.

What is the best way to develop a positive mind? We can philosophize and try to relate our theories to our direct experience, but basically this involves under-standing our own mind. At first, mind seems so familiar, simple, easy. But the more you investigate, the more mysterious mind becomes. Mind is like a painter or an artist: mind creates Samsara, mind creates Karma, mind creates confusion, delusion, misery and suffering. Mind encompasses every-thing that is happening. Mind is the parent and Samsara and Nirvana are its children. Ifl enjoy, it is through mind. Ifl suffer, it too is through mind. If I hate, my mind hates. If I resent, it is my mind that resents. If I am enlightened, it is my mind that is enlightened. Everything is based on mind. So it is essential that we understand this mind. Our minds are, in a sense, already completely illumined, capable of seeing truth directly, nakedly, but we fail to see this. Instead of seeing our mind for what it is intrinsically, we always have to relate it to something else that we can grasp or hold on to. To describe mind, we often use words which are descriptions for something else: mind is like this or mind is like that. We try to trap the mind through a series of projections or concepts. Rather than experiencing directly, we dissect the experience with our interpretations. We must always figure out what is happening or have some fanciful idea of what we are doing. But as soon as we try to interpret our reality so that it becomes more digestible our immediate experience is no longer nourishing. We all have to have things our way, otherwise we fear we will be lost. If we think we are lost, then we are reilly in trouble. No one is allowed to be lost these days. Everyone is supposed to know where it is that he or she is going. Still, many people seem very dissatisfied and inwardly disturbed.

Silence is not simply the absence of speech. Silence comes from within. It is absolutely calm, without fixation, without preparation. Just pure naturalness. Nothing is required except, simply, to be. If this means something to you, then it is not silence. Silence does not hold on to any thing. But often, if we cannot hold on to some idea, or some fascination, or some stimulation, we suddenly feel lost. We seem to have no identity, and this threatens us very deeply. Within silence we can discover who we really are ... our mind and body becomes transparent. There is no need to guess when we investigate this directly. But often we seek stimulation and excitement. We muse always be doing something. If we have a few moments alone, we may become anxious and nervous because we really don't wane to face ourselves. In that moment we may ask, 'Who is behind what is going on? My eyes move, I hear sound, I discriminate this and that ... but who is doing all of this?' You have co identify this person. On the common physical level, we think happiness is just pleasing the body. We become confident and relaxed on che outside, but internally we are still deeply worried. The body is still feeling unpleasant with certain nervous tensions that disturb our awareness. We do not even fully appreciate pleasant sensations. We are always looking forward to the next mo-ment, the next enjoyment. Or perhaps we are complaining that we never seem to get what we really want. Someone more intellectual is not fooled by the deceptions of emotional attachments. They question and investigate what is the nature of their mind. But still, they are merely doing research because there is no certainty-no one has a specific idea of what mind is or how to go about discovering it. Instead they may project a series of imag-inations-that's mind or that's mind-but they only point somewhere else. They only point at the mind that thinks, the 'maybe-mind', which is really just a projection of the self-image. As long as our self-image is present, we seem to belong to someone else. 'Me' and my 'self-image-mind' are like a married couple who are constantly fighting: there are constant disagreements, read-justments, and clinging. Or, just as a married person might say, \"I have a pretty wife,\" or, \"I have a handsome husband,\" the self-image places labels. on' our meditation experience and judges it in terms of goodness or badness.

Within the mind is a powerful energy that is capable of allowing us to penetrate with insight into the nature of our minds ... or of completely exploding through our confusion. Just as electricity and atomic energy are capable of producing much power in the material world, the mind is potentially very powerful in the psychic sphere. When we encounter tim possible situations', such as depression, anxie-ty, suffering and all sorts of so-called tproblems', this energy becomes too compressed. Mind-problems are a way of compressing this energy, of limiting our field of vision, of squeezing ourselves into an inescap-able mental corner. No matter what our situation in life, our problems are constantly going on at deeper, more subtle levels. The ways in which they choose to surface are through our daily inadequacies and frustrations. But these temporary situations are not the real problem. The real problem is more pervasive, deep within the nervous system. If we constantly try to deal with the problem, then as soon as we think we have it solved, another one takes its place. It's like digging in sand on the beach. As soon as we remove a handful of water, more water seeps in. Trying to control our thoughts, or to think or analyze our way to the root of the deeper problem will not necessarily help. We only get stuck focusing on a bucket of water and do not recognize the ocean. As soon as we think we have just solved one problem or dissatisfaction, another frustration arises. So we just continue to get stuck in an endless progression of projections, solutions and problems. Even screaming and crying only removes the surface tension. At that time our whole body tightens, our muscles compress and almost squeeze out the tears. After the session is over we feel more relaxed or clear. But this is more like shifting weight. Until we wake up, the same problems or patterns continue to arise. For just one hour we can count our thoughts and see how hundreds of thoughts arise. If our minds are especially tight or tense with the forcefulness of some narrow concentration which is trying to control our thoughts, we become heavy and exhausted. But if we can gently reduce the number of events in our mind, we can reduce the degree of tightness that occurs.

The past and future, our memories and our projections, will no longer have such a strong hold on our attention. In the immediate moment of meditation, awareness is allowed to arise\\naturally. We always seek a good guide. But the best guide is ourselves. We want to find self-fulfillment and nourishment within our experience,· right now, not some other time in the vague future. It is now that we are alive and living. We have a physical body which is very precious. We have many possibilities to find deep satisfaction within all our experi-ences and situations. First, however, we must develop full confidence in ourselves. The answers, the really important answers, are already within our consciousness, ready to be discovered. You need to take refuge in nothing else but your own mind. Once you have found yourself completely, you will discover that this inner knowledge, or certainty, has no particular ownership or territory. If a cproblem' arises, you do not necessarily have to identify yourself with that problem. Once you are free, even for a moment, you will find that there is nothing to protect, nothing to hide from.

Until the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"166 Teachings time when the enlightenment-mind becomes part of our inner experi-ence, we need to keep developing our mind. When that time comes, there will be no need for any further descriptions or explanations. What exactly is this enlightenment-mind? Enlightenment is not really something mysterious or other-worldly, but rather the result of an unrestricted and subtle awareness within the activity of our body, speech and mind. It is a subtle energy that is not easily detected because of our own internal blockages. The current is stopped, dammed up within us. Though we speak of these energies on a physical level, they are not necessarily dependent on the laws governing physical sub-stances. This Enlightenment quality is not a (thing': it has no fixed position, no substance we can point to ... its nature is more like (open space'. It is never an awareness of some 'thing', which could just be another projection of our self-image-it is neither a subject-nor object-oriented (looking'. This experience cannot even be interpreted con-ceptually, but is a natural openness that takes place when awareness is left to function freely, on its own, without hindrances, interruptions or distractions. In everyday language, awareness generally means to be 'aware of some thing' ... to look at objects, to recognize, identify, try to under-stand, and to re-experience. This is commonsense awareness. But as a living experience, natural awareness is not like that. Awareness is simple and direct, open and responsive, without concepts, words, images or interpretations. Awareness takes place within the very first moment, not before and-'not after. It is immediate and spontaneous. There is no other (thing' to obscure the moment-neither a subject nor an object, neither time nor space. All that remains is within this open space, which neither words nor concepts can adequately describe. There is complete freedom from our restless attempts to hold on to some-thing, to be secure in some distraction or some other trance-like fixa-tion. There is no fear and no guilt-no desire to escape or be any other way. This awareness becomes complete self-acceptance and generates a fresh new outlook all of its own. The experience of our own inner awareness is definitely not a re-experience. It is not a memory or a projection. It is not like 'this' and not like 'that'. It is not associated with any (thing', but a perfect, beautiful, immediate and spontaneous presence. This natural awareness becomes its own experience, but without a tight clinging to the past moment and without trying to project the next moment-without, we might say, any experience or any experienccr. It is totally free of fear, guilt, worry, expectations, projections, fixations, ideas, concepts, judg-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"menrs, images or taking positions.

At first we may be rigid, unwilling to let go of security, :ifraid of falling into just one more answerless confusion. But the more we persevere, open up and loosely relax our tensions, we begin to discover a new space, a new openness and freedom. In the process of this new exploration, old constrictions gradually evaporate and a fearless com-mitment to our own self-health and growth begins to mature.

This 'feeling-tone' quality of our perceptions and thought processes still retains various residues dependent on sen-sations. Commonly, such occurrences as thinking, feeling happy or sad, believing, wishing, doubting, and such experiences as seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and perceiving, represent particular states of mind. But this is not what Buddhism means by 'mind', for mind itself is not limited by any conceptions we might have about it. Mind itself has no substance. It has no color and no shape. It has no form, no position, no characteristics, no beginning. It is neither within nor without; it cannot be discovered as this or that thing; it is not mixed together with other things, yet is not apart from them. This mind cannot be discovered, invented, destroyed, rejected or accepted. It is beyond reasoning and so-called logical processes. Discriminating awareness and intuition can lead us to the door of this unoriginated awareness, but through the door is a vastness beyond all that can be expressed, and can only be entered nakedly, for it is without beginning and without end, beyond time and beyond all existence-natural, spontaneous openness. This mind, in_ the absence of conditions, is without memory and association, and is like muddy water which becomes pure by itself when it is not interfered with. When there is no mind, no minding, no intellect, no sensation, no perception, no memory and no association, what then is the mind of a sentient being? Sentient being can only be spoken of as long as these function-events are operating. Normally our ideas depend almost entirely on images, on habitual ways of seeing, hearing, sensing and responding. So we merely carry on the same patterns of inadequacy or confusion and continue to, experi-ence these patterns according to an inner network of interpretation. This type of functional knowledge, while helpful when we wish to accumulate information, is useless if it merely reinforces premises which fall apart under investigation. This knowledge is like a stream that eventually dries up if it is not supplied by a fresh undercurrent or natural spring of spontaneous awareness. Discriminating, judging and categorizing our experiences and perceptions into subject and object, seer and seen, only solidifies feelings of separateness, and results in a lifeless trickle of actions that perpetuate frustration.

We begin to accept things as they are, without trying to reconstruct them to fit some idealized or conceptualized pattern, or force things and people to satisfy our self-image. Suddenly, there is no 'one' to defend and no 'thing' to hide. Throughout this inner development, one of the most important things to remember is not to support or maintain a center. A bird can fly almost forever. As long as there is space, the bird can fly on and on. Similarly, as much as you are able, as long as there is free space, keep going on. Keep yourself open. Do not step back or retrace your steps. If you say, \"How's my meditation?\", the meditation experience disappears. In Tibet, people who mine for gold are constantly looking back at what they have just dug up. They continually want to check, \"How much did we get? How good is it?\" ... constantly evaluating. Simi-larly, we continually want to evaluate our meditation. We want to know whether meditation is good or bad. If it's a good meditation, you say, \"Oh, how wonderful my meditation was\" ... or, \"Oh, I'm havigg all sorts of problems.\" Instead, just keep going on. All so~ts of openings are there in the space between the thoughts. And once you open up, you won't be able to find any center, nothing to hold on to, nothing to point to and say, \"That's it!\" Pretend for a moment that a)J the planets, stars, meteorites, black holes, gaseous nebula-all objects in the heavens-completely disappear. What we have left is empty space. No inside, no outside: there is nothing that can be stood upon or pointed at. There is no gravity, no direction ... no position and no judgment. You cannot find any center. Dual-mind constantly finds its support in identifying with exter-nal objects.

When self-reflecting identity vanishes, there is no projector and no projection ... there is no one left to project or to receive it. Our initial reaction to losing our sense of identity is to feel deeply threatened. That fear is really a manifestation of the ego's residues: fear is the ego's greatest protector. But at the same time that we lose everything-we completely surrender and give up-still we are completely and totally functioning. We are 'reborn'. We have a new awareness. But this sustaining awareness is not on the samsaric level. It is without predispositions, without taking a position, without identi-fying anything, without making things solid or fixed. Within this completely open and awakened awareness, everything functions in a new, fresh, open and positive way. It is possible some day that all our perceptions will become transmuted into the nature of Buddha-mind. It is also possible for Mind-itself to disappear. At present, it is only our fixations or beliefs, or need for something solid that tricks us into thinking that mind exists. What we believe to be mind is not really mind, for whenever we say 'mind is this' or 'mind is that', we are immediately lost in some fantasy, conceptualization or description of mind. But if we experience medi-tation properly, we will eventually understand that Mind-itself is to-tally empty, without content. Therefore, there is nothing we can point to and call 'mind'. To say that mind is nothing is still an attempt to describe or define mind according to some conception. But as soon as speech begins, meditation is interrupted. This is why silence is so important. Words and concepts can only point to interpreted frag-ments of our experience, but in silence awareness comes alive. Still there is no way we can directly talk about or illustrate the nature of Mind-itself. Mind is not the product of some summation. Mind is not an abstraction. Mind is absolutely structureless.

After the Buddha was enlightened under the Bodhi tree, he thought to himself, \"No one will be able to understand this supreme knowledge, therefore I will not be able to teach it to anyone. This is the nature of Shunyata.\" So he silently decided to live in the forest ... until all the Rajas in the heaven realms begged him to turn the Wheel of the Dharma so that suffering sentient beings could hear this precious teaching. Then they presented the Buddha with many auspicious offerings-a beautiful golden wheel, an umbrella, a conch shell, cymbals and so on-saying, \"Please turn the wheel of the Dharma. You cannot be silent.\" So at that time, before the first Dharmachakra, the Buddha privately taught a few disciples the teaching of Shunyata. Shunyata has four or five general qualities: zab-pa means 'great depth', zhi-ba means 'great peace', 'od-gsal-ba means 'great clarity' or 'lucency', sprol-pral-which is generally translated as 'voidness'-means 'a freedom which has nothing to do with conceptual ideas, symbols or gestures', and 'dus-ma-byas means 'unconditioned'. These five qualities ofShunyata are like nectar, but, as the Buddha himself said, \"I found this vast knowledge, but if I reveal these teachings, no one will be able to understand them either verbally or symbolically.\" This was the basic problem: Shunyata has no characteristics and no essence, so he could not point it out anywhere. Shunyata cannot be described or explained-it cannot even be experienced, either physically through the senses, or conceptually through images and thoughts. So how can we contact this deep teaching? First, there is no way we can interpret Shunyata-we can't do it this way, and we can't do it that way. All our ideas, concepts, mental activity and intuitions cannot explain it. We can't say any-thing. All we can do is chop down, completely destroy, throw away everything ... unmask everything ... and let our minds become totally silent, peaceful, empty and clear-become the experience, become Shun-yata.

Within this open awareness or lucidity, between the thoughts, before the next concept forms, there is no subject and no object, no experience and no experiencer. When I say, chop down or completely eliminate all preconcep-tions and judgments, it seems like a negative experience-everything is destroyed. Yes, but from the viewpoint of Shunyata there is nothing to destroy, nothing to rear down, nothing to clean up. So the philos-ophers questioned Nagarjuna: \"Why is this?\" And he responded: Because everything is already totally and perfectly the nature of Shunyata. \"When does this occur?\" There is no beginning. \"When does it end?\" There's no end in time, because there is no time. \"Where is it?\" There is no location, and yet, at the same time, Shunyata is every part of everything, but is itself not standing on anything. \"Then who can realize this Shunyata?\" No one. There is no 'you' to experience, and there is no experiencer. You are still making 'realization' the goal of a subject-object relationship. This so-called 'realization' is only your interpretation ... there isn't anything to realize ... there is nothing to point to in the subject, nothing to point to in the object ... nothing inside the subject, and nothing inside the object. \"Well, then, I am completely lost-there is nothing inside and nothing outside.\" Yes, that's true.

Do you have to guess these things?\" No, everything is already perfectly existing within Shunyata. \"But then, you are really contradicting yourself; You are seeing, you are touching, you are talking. How can you say that nothing exists?\" That's only the way you interpret my words. Actually, on the level of absolute r~ality, you are not talking, you are not hearing, you are not understanding, you are not even realizing. You only think you are realizing something. As long as you 'think' in the sqbjecr-object way, you will continue to think there is something to realize. There is really no such activity. In this way, Nagarjuna continues and finally says, If there is anything left there, point it out. Verbally, conceptually, intellectually,"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Bringing the TeachingJ Alive 17 3 there is nothing co reject and nothing co accept. Neither reject it nor accept ic .... as it is is perfect Shunyata. Nagarjuna and Candrakirti were the most important Mahayana Buddhist teachers of the Shunyavadin or Madhyamika doctrine. They were most concerned with what Reality is, what Being is. Other philosophers would say 'chis is' or 'that is' and provide many defini-tions. But is-ness, they simply said, is 'to be'. But to be what? A person is sitting: to be like that? That kind of being? Or is this some special relationship to space? What kind of being is it? But Nagarjuna and Candrakirti do not give any descriptions or characterizations or cate-gorizations or qualifications. The inner nature of every 'thing' is beyond description. As soon as you give descriptions, or interpreta-tions, you are outside looking at it, standing on ic ... you are not inside that state. From the outside you can only make interpretations. Once you make comments, once you predict something, you are only intel-lectualizing from a subjective point of view. Even the most precise analysis and explanation still reflects the human mind's conditioning and obscures its own depth and clarity. In Tibetan, Shunyata is stong-pa-nyid. Stong-pa means 'empty' in the sense of'clear', or 'absolute o.penness'. It has nothing to stand on, either inside or outside: it is completely non-dual, without taking any positions. Therefore, everything past, present or future becomes united. Space, time and matter become inseparable. When we say 'empty-ness', the ness-ness implies some quality or some description: it is distin-guished from something else or implies some negation. But this negation is only verbal. Shunya, or cocal openness, has nothing to do with positive or negative connotations. These are only our human interpretations. Shunya means: I cannot grasp it, I cannot see it, I cannot touch it, I cannot smell, interpret or experience it~ There is no 'me' grasping, seeing, smelling or experiencing. Shunyata has nothing co do with form or formlessness. It does not deny or accept the physicality of material substance, nor does it describe things compara-tively ...as existent or non-existent. It's not chat kind of emptiness. Everything is emptiness. Emptiness is everything. So Nagarjuna explains this by saying: This Emptiness cannot be added to or subtracted from, because ic has no essence-no-'thing'-ness. If you look, you will not find it. Still, there is never any contra-diction whatsoever between distinctions such as existence or non-exis-tence. Everything exists according to certain natural or karmic laws, but at the same time, all form exists within space, within the Shunya"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"174 Teachings realm. Mind itself has no particular form. Mind in its emptiness is like a crystal in which all 'existing' things reflect, but of itself has no substance, and cannot be said co exist in any place. The crystal and the forms of the objects it reflects are inseparably united. \"But it seems like nothing is there, I feel sort of lost, I cannot touch it, I cannot grasp anything ... I have nothing to do .... \" Yes, Shunya says, because you do not realize you do not exist apart from these things. You think you need to touch somewhere else ... but the toucher is already toucning, the seer is already seeing. As soon as we postulate something as being separate, or isolate something in order to try and understand it, we lose sight of the fact of Shunyata. The term 'Buddha' means the 'Enlightened One'. In Tibetan, 'Buddha' is sangs-rgyas, which means 'one who is cleansed', 'one who recovers from not-knowing'. When a person eliminates, burns up and throws away all obstructions, that person is historically called the Buddha, and is symbolically represented, according to the more esoteric teachings, as Nirmanakaya, Sambhogakaya and Dharmakaya-on the practical level, the symbolic level and the absolute realiry level. But even these three Kayas-the outer, the inner and the secret-are only symbolic explanations to communicate non-verbal understandings to human beings who can only touch, or see, or feel. Symbols only bridge the human being's understanding with the outer, inner and secret levels of reality. In the beginning, we use symbols to point to something; as though Shunyata were some 'form' of experience. My meditation becomes higher and lighter, and finally everything disappears, so then I become enlightened ... there is no longer anything left. No. This is only another commentary. But actually, whatever we are involved in is already within Shunyata. We can never get in and we can never ge.t out from Shunyata. What, then, is Enlightenment, or Absolute Reality? That is Buddha. That is Shunyata. \"Then why are we not enlightened?\" From the viewpoint of absolute ,reality, all distinctions vanish. We are already enlightened .. but there is no 'we', no individual characteristics, no possessor or experiencer ... yet everything is already completely enlightened. 'Already' means there is no beginning in time. \"That doesn't make any sense to me. I am still in the samsaric realm. I'm still deluded, I still have suffering and pain. What then is the difference between enlightened ones and sentient beings?\" In the absolute way of speaking, there is very little difference. The only"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Bringing the Teachings Alive 175 difference is whether we realize it or not. The subtlety between reali-zation or non-realization is so small, so difficult to distinguish, that we always miss it. If you cut up one single thought a hundred billion times, one portion is realizing and another portion is not realizing. Cut it up one hundred billion times, and the quantity is almost nothing! One si<:k is Samsara, the other is Enlightenment. Yet if I distinguish this way or that way, then I'm lost. In the absolute sense, there is no difference; in the relative sense, there is a tremendous difference. On one hand, Nirvana, or the enlightened state, has great richness, open-ness, fullness of.being-all positive qualities-and the samsaric state has tremendous pain, suffering, ignorance, stupidity, delusion and confu-sion. At the same time, both are simultaneously coexisting because Shunyata is the root of both Samsara and Nirvana. So then, how do we see the world and yet fail to see it? For example, a person is in deep sleep. As he gradually awakens, his awareness of his own situation increases-ult is morning, I am in bed.\" He selectively senses his surroundings, has his characteristic feelings toward them, remembers his immediate situation concerning the past and his present hopes or plans for the fu tu're. And there he is. This is one description of awakening to the world. But what really goes on in our minds? In this first state of deep sleep, we are very open, but very dull and heavy-there is no awareness, no sharpness, no clarity. Then we gradually awaken, and vague feelings gather around a vague center. Then we have definite feeling-tones-we recognize objects through our senses, and we selectively emphasize certain aspects of this field ... we have a body, we see, we hear, something's uncomfortable ... and then we associate all of this with our customary way of thinking and relating, to our remembered past and co our anticipated future. In a fraction of a second, we construct <my world' or <my self' according to habitual patterns and reactions. Our senses distinguish the objectifiable world and our mind interprets what is received as perceptions, thoughts, words, images, judgments, feelings, concepts and so on. We define our <self' only after we have recognized, catego-rized, and catalogued these various fragments. But these individual aspects are subject to many changing conditions which obscure our original awareness or clarity. So we see the world through a series of filters. Although these fragments or appearances seem to be real, they do not have any separate existence of their own. So the final image or picture is not to be obsessively clung to. If we examine all of these <reflections', or fragments, we may find a broader, more light-hearted"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"176 Teachings and comprehensive way of appreciating them. This is the point of 'Shunyata'. \"But now, why do you say Shunya? Why not choose some other word?\" The reason is that Shunya, or stong-pa, is only a symbolic description. Actually, there is nothing to say, nothing to symbolize, no words to describe or explain it, nothing to intellectualize, nothing to interpret or contact. All concepts, every possibility on the relative level, dissolves, melts away ... and becomes silent, beyond all description. Now you may say, \"If there isn't any description, why do I need to investigate or talk about Shunyata? If there is nothing to explain, what value is there?\" Well, as long as my mind exists, as long as there are suffering human beings, I need to examine and investigate my situation as sharply and clearly as possible. You may say, \"This feeling seems very negative, like a vacuum, a huge, empty tunnel.\" But the Shunyavadin says, Even this you are creating and projecting. You make it like this or like that. Yo1,u description is merely your own relative interpretation which creates separation. It has nothing to do with Shunyata itself. From the viewpoint of the highest realization, everything is already perfect. Not one single imperfect thing exists. No 'thing' needs cleaning or perfecting. Each form, each specific quality is already perfect in being whatever it is ... just as it is. From the very beginning, the very first, everything is part of a total perfect condition which is Shunya. 'Perfect', you may say, implies a description of some quality. But this intrinsic perfection is beyond all relative interpretations. One might say, on the absolute level, 'behind' or 'beyond' all Reality (Enlightenment) is Shunyata. But according to the Shunyavadin doctrine, there is really no fictional beyond. 'Beyond' is already within you. Before you begin, everything exists perfectly within Shunyata. Even when something relatively imperfect is said to exist, its Shunya nature is absolutely perfect. There is nothing else other than Shunyata. Many commentators have written endless volumes trying to explain the meaning ofShunyata. On the absolute level, all appearances and forms-pure or impure, Nirvana or Samsara-are manifestations of perfect being. Practically speaking, Shunyata simply means accepting the world as it is rather than how we would like to make it. This is not mere passivity or just some balance between the extremes of eternalism or nihilism, but seeing the whole of Reality honestly and directly-without playing games and without distortion. At that time, there is nothing to gain, nothing to lose, nothing to realize, nothing to perfect."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Bringing the Teachings Alive 177 We begin to understand this, first, by cutting our all preconcep-tions. If you believe Shunyata explains tremendous vastness, cur it out. If you believe nothing, then cut chat our. If you believe in 'mind',. or that everything is mind-created, or that there is some foundation or substance, throw it away. You might say, \"How can you talk like that? Don't you believe in Karma?\" Yes, bur now I know Shunyata and that in itself is enough. There is nothing left outside. Everything is com-pletely open. Everything 'fits' perfectly, because all conditions and relationships are within Shunyata. So look carefully: Where is your mind coming from? Where does your mind go? Who are the parents of consciousness? Where is your original life coming from? Where is all existence created from? Shun-yata includes every possibility, every philosophical interpretation, every argument. It alone makes itself completely clear. Until you understand the meaning of Shunyata, you will continue to take a posicion and contradict yourself. After you have completely exhausted every logical explanation, everything is still absolutely perfect. So therefore, finally, Nagarjuna says, I do nor accept anything, I do not reject anything ... I am silent. This doesn't mean I have no answer. My answer is 'silent' in the sense that everything is already speaking it-there's nothing more to say. The perfect answer is silence. There is no ocher word: che perfect condition, the perfect realization is totally silent, and that's my answer. That's my meditation."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"178 Teachings Dream Practice Buddhist philosophy involves both theory and practice. General-ly, most Buddhist countries practice the Theravada or the Mahayana. Within the Mahayana are the esoteric teachings of the Vajrayana. Dream Yoga is one of the practices or techniques of Vajrayana Bud-dhism and seems very closely linked to the Vijnanavadin or Y ogacara school of the Mahayana. We usually think of human beings and the world as two separate things. Actually, you cannot separate yourself from your world. Sam-sara is based on this duality of'my world' and 'my self'. Each supports the other: the object supports the subject and the subject depends on the object. Dream Yoga stems from their ultimate inseparability. In early times philosophers asked, \"What is this universe? What is reality? What is this experience? In the fourth century, Asanga and Vasubandhu explained that the world is mind-projection. Our mind projects the universe. They did not use this word' mind' in the ordinary way. For them, 'mind' is a deeper, more basic foundation from which the conventional world and mind develop. likewise, our consciousness or awareness is like a mirror which reflects within itself. This type of awareness is not necessarily 'aware of some thing'. The object does not belong separately to anything other than itself. The object is not somewhere else, but within awareness. All the life experiences we have are included or reflected within awareness. This awareness is not necessarily meditation awareness. Philos-ophers were merely trying to point out that whatever life experience we may have-mental or physical, conscious or unconscious-the ex-perience is within awareness. Then they said, this intrinsic experience is based on 'light'-without any outside sources or forms or ·objects or causes ... self-illuminating. How big, how large, how tall ... there is no way we can measure experience. On the commonsense level, we may have some ideas about how or what we experience. But experientially, feeling has no form; so therefore, it's difficult to measure. Mind itself,_ you may say, is formless."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Bringing the Teachings Alive 179 As human beings we assign various categories or qualities to our feelings, perceptions and cognitions, but these things have no form. Various mental events are specifi~ally explained in the Abhidharma literature; later on, more sophisticated, esoteric teachings explain that awareness and mind are identical. Wherever mind is, there is awareness. This is not a grasping awareness, but an illuminating, lightness quality within the mind realm: the sensitized mind is itself 'light', or we may say, self-lucent. Any mental experience-whether happy, joyful, painful, negative or neutral-is within the mind realm and does not extend beyond it. So now the philosophers ask: \"What is this light? What are its signs, where is it located, how do we. find it?\" And they try to examine this situation closely. But the more they examine it, the more mysteri-ous it becomes. You can almost 'see' it ... yet at the same time it seems unreal. Whether it is real or unreal is very difficult to determine. We can only describe it by saying, \"It seems like a dream.\" What is real is the dream itself. You can say that our daytime experience is another kind of dream. We are born, we seem to have a long life, we have been working many years-we have the same body, same mind, same interests, same job. Our experience goes on and on. Our lives up to now are like the reflection of past memories. Memory seems to be the only way we can verify our past experience. All we have left is memory. All the images and pictures of past experiences are collected within memory. If you look carefully, these memory patterns are very similar to nighttime dreams. Commonly we think that the dream is unreal, untrue, not stable, not permanent. But when we are in the dream, it seems permanent. If the person is not awake within the dream, then the experience of night-dreaming or day-dreaming-or passing through imaginative realms-seems to l;>e a 'real' experience ... the same as now. When you are within the dream, it is very difficult to distinguish whether the dream is real or unreal. The only difference-once you are in the experience-is whether or not you realize it. We may think there is a wall between the two sides-between 'real' and 'unreal', day-dreaming and night-dreaming-but any kind of experience you can get on one side, you can get on the other. -Both have very similar characteristics. Any experience we can humanly have, such as suffering or happiness is equally :~,vailable as 'reality' and as 'dream'. One reflects the other. We can only speak about this from the awakened state. Usu-ally we say, \"This is a 'daydream',\" but the difference lies only in"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"180 Teachings the contrast. When we take away the wall, day-dreaming and night-dreaming, real and unreal, knowing and not-knowing, become one. But underneath, who is projecting all of this? Again we need to research ... is there any projector? The more we look, the more we see a very similar pattern. It's difficult to tell ... whether inwardly is projecting outwardly, or outwardly inwardly. Which is the center? who is inside? who is outside? If you examine this way, you cannot find any center, you cannot find any place. Daydreams and nightdreams do not seem co have any 'place'. If there is a specific functioning place, there must be someonr, something. This, too, we must research, find out. Where is mind located? This is important, because whether something exists or not is determined partly by its location. If I cannot find any specific place where chis experience is hap-pening, then I have to think: where does everything originate? Some philosophers say, \"Well, this is all part of Maya, Illusion.\" Another philosophy says, \"Who cares?\" or, \"There's an Original Mother which is undiscoverable.\" Still others say, \"Whatever ... it is beyond our ability to measure or grasp it.\" Dream philosophers do not comment or explain this way or that way. Simply, they say, this is the same as a dream. From one viewpoint, the dream is real; from another, it is not real. But real or not real only depends on our subjective theories, concepts or labels. If I ask, where do my inner pictures and images come from? Where is mind? Some of you may say, \"I have a background in philosophy or theory,\" and I believe this way,\" or, \"I follow that system.\" But theory alone is not the experience. Normally we say, 'a rose is a rose'-there is no further analysis. I see it, I identify it and I label it-this is a rose. But if someone takes away the color, and one analyzes the chemistry, and one removes the odor, and another the petals, and this and that ... where is the rose? In early times, the yogis would climb up very high mountains, between steep canyons, and they'd sing and talk very loudly ... and then listen. Immediately, to whatever they'd say, would come the reply, the echo. They'd listen and ask, \"Who is giving this answer?\" Some-times they would go to a beautiful lake and watch the reflection of their own image, and concentrate on that: where is this really coming from? You can do the same exercise within the dream. Similarly, the dream philosophers examined, \"Where does my mind come from? Where do my awareness and consciousness go? Is there any place? Do they end in"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Bringing the Teachings Alive 181 space? as matter, form or energy? Where do these things originally come from?\" Dream philosophers say that mind has no 'to' and no 'from' ... yet something seems to be happening ... 'like a dream'. We may dream at night about what we did during the day. We may have a definite experience, but where does it come from? Some philosophers say, \"From within-your collective unconscious.\" Or, \"Images are sym-bols for various experiences and projections.\" Or, \"You are re-experi-encing today within your dream in order to resolve your conflicts.\" There are many possibilities, but these explanations still attempt to describe reality according to a point of view which is itself 'within dream'. Dream Yoga has been practiced for a long time. Why? Because the whole world has problems, and each individual has his or her own particular problems-something is uncomfortable, unbalanced or dissatisfying ... we have internal conflicts, an unhappy or unhealthy mind ... maybe often, or all the time. \"The main reason,\" say the dream philosophers, \"is because you are so serious, because you believe in it and think this reality is true. You seriously believe your subjective viewpoint is real and unchangeable.\" So I take my reality seriously and find that it does not fit my desires and expectations. I have set up my ideas a certain way according to very specific, narrow rules. I have fixed ideas of happiness and so on. If reality does not fit, I struggle and suffer. Once you understand your experience as part of the dream, and that the dream is not a very solid or final reality, then you no longer have to treat your life as a serious problem. If you understand this completely, even painful experiences or mental conflicts become part o( the dream. You may not have to suffer from your own interpretations. You become less tight and more flexible. Once you awaken to this experience, everything seems like a dream ... your mind is dream, your perception is dream, pleasure or happiness is dream. The dream includes everything. So once you completely realize this, you may still have pain, but you no longer identify with psychological pain or conceptual fear, because you yourself are included within the dream. I am not only the subject or the projector watching the images, but I am included within the picture. I am the watcher, but the watcher is also watching me. Subject and object are both included within the dream. Yet we still think the dream belongs to someone else or is some"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"182 Teachings particular experience. This is only another duality, another conceptual inner dialogue: this is a dream experience, and that is a reality experi-ence. My inner awareness-the experience or the judgment-is not necessarily in one place. You can't explain whether this experience is coming from here or there or inside or outside. Both the judger and the judgment are part of the dream. My consciousness, my awareness, my ability to intellectualize-everything is included within the dream. When we understand this, then we realize that the external world and the world of ideas and mental images are both the same. Why do we try to understand dream? When you remove the fear, dualism, attachment, worry, grasping and negativity, you can see that your experience is not as serious as you thought. Your personality changes and your relationships with other' people and the world improve. Most of our human difficulties are created by an insecure identity-craving, escaping, fighting. We become so seriously involved in the dualistic situations we build within our minds that we cannot escape. We have lost flexibility, awareness, responsiveness and positiv-ity. But once we surrender the idea that dream is something unreal, untrue, far away and not part of our world, then nighttime and daytime become equalized and unified. The dream state of consciousness is not separate from the waking state. You and others, love and hate, the projector and the projection, you and your world-all are inseparable. Once we reach this understanding, we cannot lose it. Sometimes we say, 'you can become enlightened'. Enlightenment is also part of the dream state. It has no origin, no beginning, no end: it cannot be lost. Therefore, we do not need to go somewhere else to find it. The reality, the God-nature, the Absolute Truth, or, you may say, a healthy mind is right here. If you practice seeing everything as equally within the dream, you can cultivate a healthy, balanced mind. You may think, \"If I realize that everything's a dream, I might lose my business, or my job ··and equipment!\" But you do not need to hypnotize your mind. Whatever you're already doing is part of that dream. You don't have to travel to some other place to live or radically change your life style. Just watch the dream. The dream is anything we are doing! Any expression, any activity or any experience is already wi_thin that dream. There's nothing we can hide, nothing we can secretly do that is not part of the dream. Since everything is part of the dream, my whole world-my mind, my feelings, my consciousness, my cognitions ... inside, outside, backside, frontside-is also part of the dream. Nagarjuna and other"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"184 Teachings philosophers 'explained that illusion itself is part of the enlightened experience. The Bodhisattvas particularly recognized this. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who are working so hard for all sentient beings have no hardship of any kind, mental or physical. They realize that everything is part of the dream and are working to show us that we are sleeping. Liberation means to wake up to this awareness and realize that every-thing on both sides of the wall is unified. There's no separation. From early times, from the stone age until now, the whole civilized world-the ideas, the cultures, the progress-reflects a devel-opment of human awareness. So now we have to find out, where is awareness itself coming from? Internally we may try to watch the beginning and formation of observable qualities without losing awareness. Try to watch how the images are reflected to your observing awareness. Then watch how the images become something else. Most of the time we do not observe how this happens-'something just happens'. Through meditation, you can understand how awareness itself has various densities, various levels, and how images are projected before the awareness. The awareness is self-stimulating, self-feeding, and itself creates images which 'freeze' and become 'real' when we identify with them. As soon as the image becomes solid, the awareness then begins to reflect past actions, or certain past experiences. So past experience is reflected through the awareness which gives rise to var-ious vivid images which then become frozen and form our own particular view of the real world. In the morning, when we wake up, notice how we lose that image. We don't exactly remember, but between the dream image and the waking reality there is a link. It seems as though something is 'floating' between them. But how this occurs is very illusive. That is why, from ancient times, there are very specific practices to help you to recognize the link and to continue the flow between dreaming and waking. Once you realize that everything is within the dream, do not lose that seeingness quality, or inner awareness. By keeping alive that inner perspective, you can wake up within the dream. The benefit of dream practice is to balance the mind and provide nutrition for the awareness. Like parents feeding their child, every experience nourishes our awareness. So before you sleep, try not to concentrate too tightly ... or you may not sleep. Simply, do not lose your awareness. Only the mind can heal itself, but first we need to teach our mind very gently, as though we were reaching a child. The best"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Bringing the Teachings Alive 185 way to free the mind is to completely relax, breathe very softly, gently and evenly. Make everything comfortable: no worries, no anxiety, no thinking. Let your head, neck and muscles relax. Shut down all past experiences and let everything slow down so that your mind becomes very calm. Then, without making an effort, skillfully watch how the images begin and end. You can enter that dream without losing your 'waking' awareness. Psychologically, dreams may have many symbolic interpretations .. it is even possible to discover all your previous lives. But this is not the purpose of Dream Yoga. We are trying to discover what the dream is, what reality really is. Otherwise we can talk endlessly about the symbols behind the images and so on, but these are not very im-portant. Instead we have to understand: what is the difference between this real~ty and that reality ... they may be the same. From now on, whatever you do, whatever you speak, accept each experience as a dream. Walking, talking, drinking, eating, grasping, craving, thinking, feeling uncomfortable-anything you do-every-thing is within the dream. I am in dream, you are in dream, we all are in dream. Laughing or crying ... everything is a dream. There's nothing else other than dream. The daytime waking state and the nighttime sleeping state-both are equally the dream. Do not try to fix anything, just be loose and relaxed. Whatever you feel, just accept it as a dream. Your personality or self-image, your own inner psychological expres-sions and inner dialogues-whatever is within you-everything is part of the dream.

Questions and Answers Question: If we say, dream itself has no foundation, do gods and goddesses have a foundation? Rinpoche: You are still trying to figure out the dream logically. But dream is like a bubble which pops. The image itself has no seed. First you dream and you have the experience. But where does the experience originally come from? When it's gone, where does it disappear to-? Last night's dream, where is it now? Dream is like a bubble. Nothing is separate. Usually we believe that waking reality is 'real' and dreamtime"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"186 Teachings reality is 'unreal'. But the whole conclusion is that daytime and nighttime-both together-are the dream. That means deities-every-thing-are part of our projection. You can analyze the dreaming and the dreamer separately, but in the absolute sense, they are both part of the same dream. Question: What techniques would you suggest to facilitate the aware-ness that we are dreaming? Rinpoche: One of the most powerful methods is to constantly think: this is a dream. Become completely convinced-the actor himself is a dream. Then awareness develops openly and completely. Once you establish that this is a dream and we are all in it, all your concepts fall away. The dream is not bad or unreal. What happens is that your human relationships become more satisfying. Most human problems are created by our self-identity. We build up a variety of concepts and box ourselves in: this is real, that is not real. There's no way you can escape, and flexibility becomes impossible. Question: Consciousness apparently doesn't require 'energy', as we un-derstand it in the West. Rinpoche: I think that our father, our parent, is consciousness, not energy. Energy is related to space and time, but consciousness is not necessarily limited to space and time. This is a very complex subject, but it seems that Western scientific ideas of matter, energy, time and space are very closely related in Buddhism to Nirmanakaya, Sambhoga-kaya and Dharmakaya. This we need to investigate more. Question: Is there any ultimate value which is outside the dream to which the dream can be contrasted? The thing that comes to my mind is Shunyata. Rinpoche: The dream is possible because of Shunyata. Question: You mean everything that one experiences is a dream, that is, it's insubstantial precisely because the base value is nothingness, beyond all categories? Rinpoche: We are within Shunyata. You can perhaps distinguish this way: Buddhism has the Foundation, the Path, and the Goal or Fruit. If you ask a Buddhist what is existence, or what is the world, first he says: insubstantial, impermanent, transitory. But finally he says: this is Shunyata. So the goal or Enlightenment is realizing Shunyata.

Until the dualistic mind becomes totally aware of its artificial nature, you cannot fully realize Shunyata. There are many different methods, but dream is one of the most suitable for realizing Enlight-enment, because it's very enjoyable. For example, if we follow a spiritual path, during the day we still have certain frustrating situations, such as depression, pain, dissatis-faction or emotional negativity. You can change this through your awareness. During the nighttime, you can become aware within the dream and begin to develop fresh insight, confidence and strength that extends into the daytime and influences everything you do. The dream itself can be your teacher. Question: For some reason, to think that everything is a dream makes me afraid. Rinpoche: That is because we are very seriously involved in our human problems. We have so many responsibilities, obligations and compli-cated situations that we have no choice, no freedom. Life includes many painful experiences. But once you realize everything is a dream, these things do not seem so serious, so fixed, so unchanging. To be afraid is to fear openness. Fear is ego's best friend. When ego is threatened, fear keeps the ego alive. If fear is overcome, ego has no protection. But ego only exists in our heads, not in our heart. That the world is a dream need not make you afraid. It's a dream. Just accept it as dream and relax. Let your meditation be very comfortable. Otherwise you may become very rigid. There are actually eight different similes for dream listed in the Sutras. Dream is like an echo, a mirage, an illusion. Dream practice is also discussed by Candrakirti in some of his Shastras, by Nagarjuna, Naropa, and especially by Long-chen-pa. They say that the world we think we see is only a view, a description of the world. Accepting this is very difficult because we are completely fixed in our own particular view. If you want to understand this dream practice, study the Madhya-mika and Yogacara and exarillne your life logically, philosophically and psychologically. The more you examine and test these things, the more they will contribute to your understanding. But words alone cannot make these ideas clear. Once you understand this, you need to practice and become that understanding. Dream is everything you are and everything you are doing.

Tibet has its roots not only in an historical or cultural past, but within the innermost being of man, and its investigation of the very nature of human consciousness stretches beyond this short life-span, beyond the limitations of a momentary time-conditioned individuality, and beyond the prejudices of so-called cultural differences. In recent times, a deep echo has resounded from Tibet which has been heard throughout the Western world. This description of the Tibetan people, however, only attempts to provide a general panoramic survey of their customs and lifestyles. In the wisdom of Tibet's ancient traditions are contained the creative seeds that may yet give birth to the vast and deep horizons that are already present within the conscious-ness of man, but as yet hidden from sight. The Geography Tibet is often called the 'Roof of the W odd', with mountains towering to 25,000 feet, trails winding over treacherous 15,000-foot · passes, and many year-round settlements situated at heights well over 10,000 feet. While the tallest mountains are perpetually covered with ice and snow, lower altitudes successively reveal bare rock, vegetation; pine trees, stretches of rolling grassy hills, swift-running ice-cold brooks, and sky-mirroring lakes. Many people commonly think of Tibet as a series of unapproach-able mountains with vast quantities of snow, but the Tibetan climate is far from being cold, wild and inhospitable. In Lhasa, for example, situated at a height of 11,000 feet, summers are a few degrees warmer than our Midwest, and winters last for only three months with little snowfall. Even rain, except for occasional southerly monsoons rising over the Himalayas, is scarce, but plenty of melting snow-water pro-vides abundant irrigation to fields, hillside pastures and woodlands. Yet generalizations about Tibet are impractical because the folds of moun-tain ranges, the pockets of various valleys and the particular altitude of any given location expose a variety of fluctuating climates amid a vast diversity of local conditions. Tibet is literally surrounded by mountain ranges which have traditionally formed its rather loosely-defined boundaries. In the north, the Altyn Tagh m~untain ranges, overlooking Mongolia and Russia, rear their lofty heads from the tableland, criss-crossing treeless grassy"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"194 Culture steppes which are liberally scattered with salt lakes. In the east, dividing Tibet from China, several parallel ranges run north and south, while the mighty Himalayas to the south harbor Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan. To the west, the long, winding Karakoram range separates Tibet from the outlying regions of Kashmir, Baltistan and Persia, and are the source of numerous rivers. Mt. Kailas in western Tibet forms the spire of the 'Roof of the World', and, like spokes radiating from the hub of a wheel, a number of mighty rivers take their course towards the east, west, northwest and south. These rivers are the Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Sutlej, and the Karnali. In ancient scriptures these rivers are described as outlets from the Manasarovar Lake at the foot of Mount Kailas, which is called Meru or Sumeru, according to the oldest Sanskrit tradition, and which is regarded by the Indians to be not only the physical but the meta-physical center of the universe. The Tibetans call the Brahmaputra, the source of which is in the east of Mt. Kailas, the river 'flowing out of a horse's mouth', which flows across central Tibet (here called the Tsangpo) and then turns sharply southwards and enters Assam and India. The Sudej, whose source is in the west, is called the river •flowing out an elephant's mouth'; the Indus in the north, the river 'flowing out of a lion's mouth'; and the Karnali in the south, the river •flowing out a peacock's mouth'. The river names indicate that they are regarded as parts of a universal ma1Jc/ala, with Kailas at the center. For the most part, Tibet is situated on an elevated plat6m-the Northern Plain, Chang Thang-which averages some 15,000 feet above sea level. Since the altitude is too high for farming, herdsmen and wandering nomads, who wear rough sheepskin garments and furry hats and live in thick black tents woven from yaks wool, follow the seasons from pasture to pasture, grazing their yaks, dru, goats and sheep, and trading in wool, butter, borax and salt. In the northeastern plains and mountains, which include Amdo, Golok, Sertal, and Gyarong, pastures slope down into extended valleys where woodsmen raise animals, particularly horses and sheep, and grow grain, vegetables and fruit trees. In the fertile valleys to the east is Kham, including Derge. Here, both farming and grazing are extensive, as well as in the central districts of U and Tsang, which include the capital Lhasa, and the larger towns of Shigatse, Gyantse and Hloka. To the southwest and west, known as Ngari Korsum, farming is possible in summer, but in winter the herds are taken to northern pastures. Thus, while the western and northern climates are colder and harsher, the valleys of the eastern and southern regions are warmer and more fertile."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":":····· ........... ~ ••• : LAHUL• .... .... • :......

The Tibetan landscape itself appears like the organic e:J:Cpression of primeval forces. Amidst a wide assortment of natural environments, the Tibetans really only distinguish two types of land: that which is inhabitable, and that which is not (comprising mostly deserts and mountain peaks). According to a ninth-century account, good land-that is, land which is ideal for farming and pasturing-possesses ten virtues: grasslands, with meadows near home and pastures more distant; soil with which to build houses and soil that is fertile; wi'ter good to drink and water abun.dant for cultivation; stones for building and stones for grinding grain; and wood-from trees that turn red in the winter and those that do not-for lumber and fuel. Nowhere, it seems, do these elements combine in the same proportion. Conditions fluc-tuate with the altitude, the slope of the land, and the naturaHenility of the soil-and these determine whether land will be grazed or sown. Tibet's bare mountains, which are among the earth's youngest ranges, possibly contain more gold and precious gems than the rest of the world combined. The Tibetans, however, have never shown much interest in mining, and an abundance of minerals-such as zinc, copper, lead, iron, and rich deposits of coal and oil-have remained almost completely untapped. The Tibetans have never faced a food crisis for even the relatively poor have always been able to choose from a great abundance and variety of foods and dairy products. Farmers in the upper valleys generally grow large quantities of barley, wheat, black peas, maize, beans; buckwheat and mustard. In particular, Tibetans enjoy a very small variety of potato, which tastes sweeter than yams, and a red, chili-like bean which is grown in the spring and autumn and which is either ground for flour or boiled and eaten with butter and cheese. In the lower regions, vegetables such as cabbages, cauliflower, tomatoes, onions, garlic, celery, radishes and turnips are common, as well as a variety offruits (strawberries, grapes, rhubarb) and fruit trees (apricot, peach, pear, apple). In early times, grain was so plentiful that it was customarily used for currency in trade. Because of the favorable climate, surplus barley and wheat can be stored for twenty-five and even fifty years.

The People: Herdsmen, Farmers, Villagers Tibetans are a simple; quiet, cheerful people whocemulate tradi-tional behavior, if only because tested methods of survival and adapta-tion have proven most efficient and practical for centuries. Conditions might be rigorous according to contemporary Western standards, but elements of strain and inconvenience affect everyone alike and evoke a deep sense of social unity and spontaneous friendliness among neigh-bors. Every Tibetan, whether he be a herdsman, village-farmer, trader, soldier, official or monk, is dependent on harmonious communal relations and mutual cooperation. Leaning strongly on their under-standing of Buddhism, they realize that nothing ever really happens in an arbitrary way and that ther~ is a reason for everything. One must only be clever enough to stimulate and develop what is beneficial and advantageous, in family, business, society, and religion. A strong moral sense, dictated by honesty and direct negotiation, is coupled with the conviction that one should never expect something for nothing. This is one of the reasons Tibetans are hard-working, industrious, sympathetic, honest, loyal, open, kind, clever and just. Such has been the opinion of foreign travelers who have spent some time in Tiber, and more recently, by those who have encountered refugee Tibetans in Nepal and India. The common man is herdsman and farmer, carpenter, mason and general craftsman, goldsmith, bootmaker, doctor, trader and business-man. He builds the castles, monasteries, villages, and large tents (va), and lives in accord with the natural cycles of weather and land. His wife looks after the children and aging relatives, milks the family animals, churns the butter, weaves the woolen homespun and fashions clothes. Everything is accomplished by the skill of their hands, from delicate embroidery and wood-carving ro fashioning a new harness for the ploughing yak. Although no accurate census has ever been taken in Tiber, in 1956 the Dalai Lama estimated the total population at eight-ten million. Of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People. and Culture 199 this number, approximately 48 percent were herdsmen and 32 percent village-dwelling farmers and traders. Monks and nuns, drawn from all classes of society, formed about 20 percent (18 percent monks and 2 percent nuns). Thus, herdsmen and farmers comprise 80 percent of the population and provide Tibet with a broad-based agricultural society self-sufficient in its supply of food. As one occupation supplies and supports the other, herdsmen and village-dwelling farmers interrelate harmoniously for commerce and socializing, while their specific life styles remain usefully different in many ways. Herdsmen and Traders. Herdsmen form a society all their own. While their physical appearance and way of life may seem ageless, of another world, bound by neither space nor time, beneath their weath-ered features are concealed the natural virtues of man. Their cheerful-ness and strength of character, their generosity and hospitality, are legendary in Tibet. Most herdsmen live on the Northern Plain, where the four elements of snow, frost, wind and sun, in combination with the undulating desolate plains and the naked rocks and cliffs, create an austere grandeur and subtle beauty unique co Chang Thang. While some provide herding and agricultural services for ~onasteries, private estates of government officials, and families with an abundance of herds, others spend most of the year traveling to central Tibet on trading missions. But generally they own their herds and travel between summer and winter pastures, erecting large trade va (tents) in the center of the plains. Lacking the necessary climate for large-scale agriculture, the herdsman economy depends entirely on breeding herds of yak, sheep, goats and horses in the green but often sparse tableland of the north and northeast. Single families normally graze several hundred sheep and yaks, while wealthier families and clans possess over 10,000, and even up co 50,000 animals which provide abundant wool to support an extensive trading operation with India and other bordering countries. As the entire northern region is common ground, the herdsmen have no fixed dwellings, but follow available grass and water. However, a particular group of herdsmen and their families normally move to the summer or winter pastoral land where they had pitched their vain the previous season. Thus, even the names of'villages' refer only to favorite campsites. Ancient fortresses, built on significant junctions, stand"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"200 Culture unmanned on lofty summits. A few monasteries, nestled into high ridges, overlook gorges and frozen streams, where red and yellow rocks rise like flames against the dark blue curtain of the sky. A couple of huge black va made of woven yak hair, which are warm, strong and waterproof, and pitched on a level green plot of ground, forms the natural palace of the herdsmen. Some of these va are large enough to accommodate one or two hundred persons and are even divided into separate rooms. From a distance, Tibetan encamp-ments are easily recognized, for many colorful prayer flags can be seen flapping in the breeze while the blue smoke of sang (charcoal-incense offerings) rises in front of their va. A few yards from the tent there are always a few gigantic sheepdogs, whose responsible ability to guard the occupants is unquestioned. For fuel, wood of any kind is rare, so herdsmen commonly use small wild azalea bushes, various roots, and yak-droppings which are plentiful and slow-burning. Vegetation, ex-cept for grass and medicinal herbs, is scarce in the uplands, and the northerners live on tsampa (barley roasted whole and ground into flour), meat, butter and cheese. Abundant milk provides various cheese delicacies such as cottage cheese and cheesecake. Hard cheeses are often strung together and sold in the towns, but the main trading products are usually butter and wool. To the Tibetans, the yak is probably their most useful animal. Both a pack and riding animal, the yak is sure-footed on the roughest and steepest paths, lives under difficult conditions, and most often finds its own food. Their meat is savory and can be preserved dried for a year or more: and their wool makes warm cloth and durable rope. Tibetans are always highly amused when they hear a Westerner refer to 'yak's milk', for this is the equivalent to saying 'hull's milk'. The dru (female yak) and the dzo-mo (a cross between a bull and a dru) produce large quantities of milk which is churned for butter in large vats. Villagers often rent yaks and other animals to the herdsmen during the harsh winter months. The herdsmen in turn pasture the animals on the northern plains and make rental payments in butter, usually thirty pounds of butter annually per head of dru. When packed in wet hides, butter becomes well-compressed and can be kept for a year or so. Yak butter, which has a natural, golden color,-is an essential ingredient in the Tibetan diet and makes a nourishing drink mixed with tea. While there are many small towns scattered throughout Tibet, distances between destinations can sometimes require a month or more of travel. For example, northern traders from Amdo, who wish to sell"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Culture 201 horses and mules iff Lhasa, travel nine months of the year. They would leave northern Tibet in April in order to ensure fresh grass for their horses en route, and reach Lhasa in August, arriving back home with supplies in February. Traders and travelers alike either walk or ride the horse or mule, while luggage is carried by horse, yak, mule, dzo, donkey, or sheep. Large bells mounted on their pack animals help to relieve the long silence and strain of a tedious journey, frighten wild animals in jungle regions, and assist travelers in locating their animals during night grazing hours. In western Tibet, sheep are the most common pack animals and each, for instance, carries two ten-pound loads of salt. A dozen traders usually travel together, and each trader has about one hundred sheep. Both the salt and the sheep are then sold when they arrive at the Nepalese or Indian border. High in mountainous country, the traveler constantly faces the unexpected, where all accepted rules of nature change without notice. Even the contrast between sun and shade is extreme. The air is too rarefied to absorb the sun's heat and thus create a medium shadow temperature. Nor is one protected from the fierceness of the sun and its ultra-violet rays. Even Tibetans, except those who live permanently in the open air, often wear face-masks while travelling to protect them-selves from the fierce sun and still fiercer winds, which sweep over the highlands at certain seasons, carrying with them douds of fine stinging sand that penetrate even the heaviest clothing. Crossing a river with a thousand animals is not always simple, easy or smooth. Normally, animals and men are carried across by small yak-skin boats which hold about ten people, or by large wooden ferries which hold thirty. In eastern Tibet, known for its swift currents and treacherous cliffs, an ingenious rope bridge connects cwo sides of a steep hillside at a 60-degree angle. The traveler is strapped onto a small wooden saddle and then slides, feet first, downwards to the opposite side. Even pack animals, lashed upside-down to the ropeway, are sene sliding in this way to the opposite side, sometimes two or three hundred yards above a torrential river. When herdsmen arrive in villages or towns to trade and purchase supplies, they often arrange for local merchants, who are aware of market prices and experienced in ·securing a reasonable profit, co sell their loads of butter, cheese, sale, borax, wool and, their finely hand-crafted leather and woolen goods. In exchange, the traders buy cotton, tea, and large quantities of grain. Some also buy housewares such as religious objects, paintings, books, incense, carpets, silver stands and"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"202 Culture lids for wooden teacups, ornately embroidered garments, and coral, amber, turquoise, sandalwood and elephant-bone beads with which the women string thejr popular jewelry. In addition, they might purchase mineral dyes, medicines, spices, herbs, pearls, precious jewels, Kashmiri silk and brocades, Italian wool, and imports from Europe and America. Such traders from the north are easily recognized in the warmer valleys, for even in the hottest weather they are accustomed to wear their long coats of sheepskin bordered with bright red, blue and green cloth. Their dialect, too, is full of allusions and picturesque metaphors, and they sprinkle many proverbial expressions into their quick and fluent conversation. According to a popular proverb, \"Each district has its way of speaking, as each lama his way of teaching.\" Village-dwelling farmers. Many non-nomadic Tibetans divide their time between farming in the summer and herding in the winter. These live in the small mountainous towns of the northeast (Amdo) and east (Kham) and cultivate wheat, barley, buckwheat and beans. But most agriculturalists live in settled communities in the southern and central portions of Tibet, and, while mobile, do not range very far except to make occasional pilgrimages or extended trading journeys. Like their northern neighbors, the village-farmers maintain herds of yak and sheep, but often rent them to travelers, traders and herdsmen during the winter. Otherwise, they must feed their animals on grain and barley stalks saved from the harvest. Daring stone, cement, mud and wood buildings are typical of Tibet, and architecture does not vary significantly for castles, palaces, temples and private houses. For dwellings they often construct high, almost fortress-like, flat-roofed houses which are dosed to the outside but open into one or more inner courtyards. Such buildings-whose walls slope inwards prefiguring modern skyscrapers-usually rise three or four stories up the side of a hill, with cattle, goats and donkeys on the ground floor, living rooms in the middle (containing furniture, various utensils of gold, silver, copper and iron), and a small chapel on the top, decorated with elaborate wood-carvings, silk, turquoise-embedded statues and painted scrolls (thankas). As in ancient times, the flat roofs sometimes function as a threshing floor for grain and a storehouse for firewood. The land is worked by a pair of dzo drawing wooden ploughs, or in some places by a line of men with long-handled, long-bladed spades."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Tibet: The LAnd, People and Culture 203 Tibetan village with temple The dzo's heads are often decorated with red wool and sometimes with . \\ little mirrors which reflect the sunlight and can be seen from a far distance. Seeds are sown in the spring, or as soon as the earth is sufficiently thawed. By June sprouts appear; in July heavy rains sweep in from the south over the Himalayas; and in late September the harvest begins. Crops are then cut with a shore reaping hook and taken to the threshing ground on the backs of donkeys. Threshing is done with wooden flails or by driving cattle round and round over the sheaves, and the grain is winnowed by the wind as it drops from basket-work scoops. During harvest, all other work stops and everyone concentrates their energy on preparing their food supply for the next year. The Tibetans always accompany their plowing, sowing, reaping and threshing with a variety of songs, causing the distant canyons to echo with their melodies. After the harvest, their stores brimming, they celebrate a week-long holiday, traveling to visit friends and drinking chang, the national beer made from barley which tastes a little like saki. The tempo of village life, although relatively easy, often requires much patience, for all labor seems to follow the natural timetable of the seasons.

Girls might also tend the ani-mals, but normally they help in the fields if there is work to be done there. The father and brothers might leave for weeks with a team of yaks or donkeys, either trading or portering, while the mother milks the three or four family cows or settles down to her weaving, producing clothes and bright-colored blankets from home-spun and home-dyed wool. Objects ofTibetan craft reveal the people's main occupations, for their artifacts are generally practical, efficient tools used in work, colorful clothing which adorns the entire population, and ceremonial implements used in rituals of religious devotion. Tibetans show a predilection for bright primary colors, especially the religious colors of yellow and dark red. Hand-woven carpets and canopies depict various silken floral designs and animal imagery, reflecting perhaps, in their use of the dragon and peacock, cultural influences from Persia and China. In more recent rimes, Nepalese craftsmen brought many skills to Tiber, especially examples of metal work, but the Tibetans were already skilled in manufacturing cooking utensils, weapons, sword-scabbards, horse-saddles and other items, and had developed their own tradition for molding and guilding sacred religious images and ceremonial implements. Work in bronze, silver, copper and gold was done in very early rimes, and the ancient T'ang annals of China refer to many presents-such as elaborate, hand-sculptured vases and bowls-made of gold, which seems to have been abundant in early Tibet. Women in Tibet, as in the West, have a reputation for being conscious of fashionable apparel. On special occasions, they wear wide-sleeved blouses under long gowns and multi-colored aprons with their long black hair augmented by plaits of false hair which rest on a velvet-rolled framework ornamented with pearls, coral and turquoise. Long gold earrings, studded with turquoise, are looped over the ears, and amulet charm-boxes, intricately decorated with gold, turquoise, pearls and diamonds, are worn as necklaces. Amusements in Tibet are few and simple, for work provides plenty of exercise, and, as each day is counted the same, Tibetans do not look forward to the 'weekend'. Everyone generally takes a rest in the afternoons and on certain leisure days after the harvest and during the winter. Visiting travelers carry the local, regional and national news, and during the summer monks and pilgrims pass through the valleys on their way to visit various shrines or monasteries.

Few villagers can read, and butter lamps provide little light when the day's work is done. But Tibetans in general are a very mobile people and frequently visit resident lamas or a nearby monastery ro offer gifts and seek advice on a variety of material, medicinal and religious matters. Their learning is acquired through word of mouth. Bud-dhist teachings are transmitted in this way from childhood and thus, despite the lack of intellect'ual attainment normally associated with. reading and writing, the Tibetans freely discourse on a number of subjects and draw their information from well-disciplined memories and a vast realm of practical, common sense. During the year, festivals, often religious by nature, provide the main source of social entertainment. During Tibetan New Year cele-brations (Losar), for example, monks sing performances of religious drama and, at other festivals throughout the year, present scenes from the life of Milarepa or historical episodes depicting such well-known events as Padmasambhava's conquering of the evil spirits of Tibet. These dramas thus provide entertainment while teaching the basic doctrines of the Buddhist faith. These popular teaching stories and Dharma-dancing are accompanied by comic relief artists who wear brightly painted, papier-mache animal masks and delight the crowds, while other variously costumed troupes dance to the music of the traditional drum, cymbals and flute. With the passage of time, these festivals gained commercial and social importance as well. They are like renaissance fairs, where villagers from the nearby valleys and nomads from distant hills could gather together to make new acquaintances and renew old ones. The farmer dresses up in his best clothes-a black or white woolen chuba, a cotton shirt, and new felt boots-while the women decorate themselves more elaborately. Here too, they barter their agricultural and dairy products. But commerce does not overshadow the original purpose of these festivals, and they remain a sincere demonstration of the Tibetans' inborn faith."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"206 Culture Trade. From early times, a barter system prevailed in Tibet, and barley was commonly used to make purchases ranging from clothes to horses. At the turn of the 20th century, a system of paper currency and silver coins was developed. But the Tibetans have never maintained a central bank, controlled foreign exchange or established a credit card time-payment plan. Markets are controlled solely by local supply and demand-and the fluctuations of weather. The great bulk of trade is drawn southwards to Central Tibet and lhasa, and from there to Nepal, India, and eastwards to China. The chief Tibetan exports are wool, borax and salt, and minor exports include the skins of various animals, such as the snow leopard and marmot, musk, deer horns, incense, skillfully crafted metalwork, such as gold-leafed swords and scabbards, and a variety of herbs and medic-inal goods. Horses, sheep, donkeys, mules and goats are also exported to Nepal, India and China. In return, a variety of imports entered Tibet-cotton cloth, kerosene, hardware, sugar, soap, and even cosmet-ics. From China came tea and, to a lesser extent, porcelain and silk, along with various medicinal remedies and herbs. Only at the turn of the century have Western products made their way into Tibet, such as cameras, watches, ballpoint pens, glazed windows, steel girders for building, concrete and certain styles of Western and Chinese cuisine and clothing design. In addition, a great variety of vegetables, flowers and fruit trees appeared which were spread by roots, seeds and cuttings all over lhasa and beyond. Tibetans do not easily absorb outside customs and influences, but prefer to adopt a few practices in a casual manner and adapt them to their own taste. Culturally, for example, China has influenced Tibet only superficially when compared to the active Indian Buddhist tradi-tion that proliferated in Tibet. Tea was introduced from China as early as the 8th century, but Tibetans brewed it in their own manner, churning it with butter, and serving it as a light but stimulating broth. The only Chinese crafts adopted for general use seem to have been certain stylistic influences in religious painting (e.g. landscapes), the art of papermaking and, especially, printing from carved wooden blocks. Self-governing People. Throughout mos.t of Tibet, the inner law of man and the physical law of nature were generally the only recognized authorities. But life in Lhasa, in south-central Tibet, was somewhat different. Lhasa had not only been the early site of the Tibetan kingship under Song-tsen Gam-po and later under Tri-song"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Culture 207 De-tsen (d. 797), but was fairly accessible to travelers. Situated on an elevated plain just north of the Himalayas, Lhasa thus became the central hub for commercial traffic, linking Tibetan exports and imports with India, Nepal, Turkestan, Russia, China, Japan and, in modern times, Europe and America. When, in the 17th century, the Fifth Dalai Lama built the Potala Palace on a hill overlooking Lhasa, he assumed both civil and spiritual leadership of the central regions, and life in Lhasa accelerated even more. Tibetans possess a strong sense of self-reliance and a firm convic-tion of what is traditionally fair; they are strangers to the concept that the end justifies the means. Ever since the 7th century, Tibet's consti-tution has consisted of only sixteen maxims which were later reduced to thirteen. Unlike the United States, with its governing constitution and vast legal network, Tibetans have never followed any formal codification of laws, but jnstead based their social interactions on the religious principles of Buddhism. Through the centuries, church and state were always combined, but a clear delineation between the re-sponsibilities of government and religion might have proven helpful in regulating many mundane matterS and in formulating policies which were strictly political. Political decisions, however, simultaneously be-came religious decisions, and many governing laws and policies that might have been introduced were left to the responsibility of the people. Long-held customs and traditions; based on commitments rather than commandments, determined the law of the land. The cohesion, strength and harmony required by individual groups supplied all the authority that was necessary. If someone com-mitted a crime, or a question of right or wrong arose, the two parties openly discussed their grievances with the headman and people who decided the matter without delay. S9me areas of the country main-tained a jail, but flogging provided an effective and direct form of punishment. In ancient times, amputations were used as deterrents, but the Tibetans never condoned capital punishment or the taking of life in any way. If someone committed a serious crime, particularly in the northern regions, he might just run away, but by so doing he surren-dered forever his traditional and inherited rights in exchange for the life of a wanderer. Tibetans felt this separation or banishment to be the worst possible punishment. Tibetans have no caste system as in India, but consider all people as equal. Individual differences, seen in the light of Buddhism, derive from the power of each person's self-created Karma. One of the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"208 Culture principle features of Buddhism is that each individual is responsible for his present life, which by its very occurrence, determines his future. It is said that one of Tibet's religious kings, Mu-ne Tsen-po (804 A.D.), the son of Tri-song De-tsen, tried to equalize all the people of Tibet by appointing ministers to redistribute land and property. After some time he asked how the reform was proceeding and learned that the rich were becoming richer, and the poor, poorer. He made two more attempts to reform things, but each time the people drifted back to their original occupations and status of wealth. Rather than use the doctrine of Karma as an excuse or an inducement to passivity, the Tibetans understand that a total effort in this life-whether for material gain or the highest awareness-produces beneficial consequences. They work industriously and diligently, practice sympathetic acceptance of them-selves and others, and show no limits when helping those in need. Among their social groupings, one person's suffering, misfortune or welfare affects them all. Family. Because hereditary possession and family rights were so important, Tibetan fami~ies tended to be loosely structured, extended by and linked with many other clans in marriage relationships. in any one family or group, no distinction was made between one's own children, those of one's brothers, those of a second wife, or even those adopted, for all rights and responsibilities were traditionally bestowed on the eldest son. Up to three centuries ago, in certain regions of Tibet, polygamy was practiced specifically to keep property in one family, but most people today take only one partner. But just as there are many kinds of human beings, Tibetan marriage relationships, like those of all other peoples, contain elements of unpredictability. Tibetans regard marriage as an important social function, and Tibetan wedding ceremonies, whether luxurious or simple, vary only according to the particular customs of the different provinces. In Tibetan society, arranged marriages have proven satisfactory for hundreds of years. Normally the son's family makes extensive inquiries among eligible girls. If the couple's astrological charts are found to be in agreement, and the girl's parents consent to the proposal, the engagement date is fixed by an astrologer. In all events, a satisfactory relationship is considered most important, to ensure harmony not only between husband and wife, but also between other members of the family. Both families, though, ordinarily lavish much attention on the prospective bride and groom, and preparations for the ceremony gen-"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Culture 209 erate in them both a great deal of excitement and positive expectation, and no one marries against their own will. Love relationships have become more common, and the same precautions are taken by the families to arrange a satisfactory marriage. If a marriage should prove to have difficulties, friends and relations consider it an important duty to mediate. Their over-all objective is to maintain the close-knit unity of the family. Families in Tibet are characterized by their respect for the elderly. Even beggars, or those who have been previously outcast, or those with little knowledge are respected, for age carries the wisdom of its own experience. It is commonly said that parents have children so that they will be taken care of in their old age, and Tibetan families fulfill this responsibility with natural gratitude. Two and three generations often live in the same house: the old look after the young, and the young look after the old. Children spend most of the day playing and receive very little discipline, and controversy among children within the family is usually minimal. They soon discover what is and what is not allowed, and learn rules of behavior, like all children, by imitating the grownups around them. In this way, by ten or twelve, children mature very rapidly through continual association with all members of the family and are gradually given more and more responsibility. Astronomy and Astrology. Astronomy, astrology (kar-tsr), and the mathematical calculations (tsi-nag) and casting of horoscopes (na-tsi) play important roles in Tibetans' daily activities. In early times, Babylonian astrological influences probably drifted throughout Central Asia and passed into Tibet via traders and travelers. Thereupon the Tibetans conducted elaborate studies of the position, movements, and size of the planets, listing, according to the 19th-century Lama Mi-pham, ten planets and twenty-eight constellations (kar-ma). He also made an extensive study of the Kalacakra T antra (Wheel of Time) which was originally introduced in 1027 A.D. When a child is born, an astrologer-sage prepares a complete astrological chart, indicating the relative positions o_f the sun, moon and stars, the cosmic influences likely to affect the child's disposition, and a forecast of the child's entire life. Such astrologers are also called upon for advice and predictions in a variety of family situations. A horoscope is cast when a young man or woman chooses a marriage partner, or to determine the auspicious time to depart on a long journey, to build a house, temple or srupa."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"210 Culture The Tibetan calendar system is somewhat variable. Each year certain adjustments are made to adapt the Tibetan lunar calendars to the actual lunar and solar cycles, to omit negative conjunctions and to duplicate positive ones. A new year begins with the rise of the new moon in the Western month of February, and contains twelve months and seven weekdays, which are .(lamed, as in the Western system, for the sun, moon, and the five visible planets (Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn). Each year in a cycle of twelve is named after one of the following animals: mouse, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, serpent, horse, sheep, ape, bird, dog, and hog. And each of these combine with the five elements-wood, fire, earth, iron and water-to form a cycle of sixty years. The animal cycle also marks the months, while each day of the lunar month and each day of the week are influenced by the distinctive patterns and energies of the constellations, and are associated with specific qualities, colors and natural elements. An astrologer carefully observes the degrees of antagonism and affinity in the combinations to determine which years, months, days and hours are positive or neg~tive. The combination of the tiger and monkey, for example, is inauspicious, just as iron is hostile to the fire which melts it. Medicine. Though Tibetan medical practice cannot be com-pared to modern Western techniques, Tibet possesses a fairly advanced medical science of its own. The earliest medical texts came from the Indian Vedic tradition, from China and even Iran, and four lengthy volumes were translated into Tibetan. These translations form the basis of numerous manuals and theses which were later written by Tibetan medical practitioners and lamas, and this knowledge, once assimilated, became uniquely Tibetan. These texts describe the nature of specific illnesses, prescribe medicines, and detail instructions for surgical operations. Tibetan medicine attempts to cure the patient as a whole rather than cure a particular disease in isolation, for it recognizes the inter-dependent relationship between mind and body. As such, its techniques include psychotherapy, astrology and herbal medicines. Tibetan doctors immediately investigate the causes of any illness: that is, when did the sickness appear and what symptoms and changes were experienced. Some of the simpler causes for a disorder might be the result of a change in diet, too much or too little sleep, sadness, or any variety of emotional and mental imbalances. Doctors explore the medical history of the patient to determine the presence of hereditary diseases, check"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Culture 211 the patient's urine and circulation, and examine his eyes, tongue, teeth and skin. Some can even determine a patient's character and predict the general health of the body for the future by feeling the pulse. Tibetan science actually evolved from a practical investigation into medicine, and a doctor was required to learn basic geology, biology, physics, philosophy and general chemistry. The Tibetans thus possess a scholastic theoretical knowledge of medicine in conjunction with their age-old traditional practices. In early times, medical practi-tioners developed complete internal maps of the physical system-knowledge gained in part through meditation-which dearly showed the networks of bones, nerves, muscles, arteries and veins, much like the figures of transparent plastic humans seen commonly in the West. They have even created elaborately descriptive 'trees' of health-oriented and disease-oriented symptoms which detailed and compared physical pathways and structures with the movements, harmonies and disjunc-tions of the planets. Doctors in Tibet practice a form of pressure-point massage which is similar to the Japanese shiatsu. But the practice of surgery is rare, for Tibetans believe that sickness, disease and infection are caused by natural imbalances, and that the body is inseparably united to emo-tional upsets-anger, impatience, frustration, rejection in love, sorrow in death-and that only a change in mental perspective and outlook will effect a lasting cure. Even such diseases as heart trouble and· cancer, common in the West, are caused in large part, the Tibetans feel, by karmically accumulated negative and depressed mental attitudes. Many remedies, therefore, are similar to Western homeopathy or naturopathy, and doctors employ both living and non-living natural elements in a variety of combinations. Experienced doctors might, for example, prescribe the intake of meat, eggs, natural oils, animal parts, and, in rare cases, elephant's liver, lion's milk, or a special compound of mercury. Lama Mi-pham spent some time as a chemist, perfecting potent vitamin tablets which acted to restore the natural balance of minerals and elements in the body of the patient. More commonly, however, the Tibetans employ a large variety of herbal medicines-roots, leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, honey, and sixty-four major minerals-which contain concentrated quantities of vi-tamins and which are combined in over a thousand ways. Herbs might be boiled and the vapors inhaled, drunk as a tea or used as a poultice. Herbal remedies are particularly well-suited for curing delinquent or persistent diseases, but, since they react slowly an~ steadily, they are less"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"212 Culture effective in emergencies. One traveler to Tibet describes having re-ceived comfort from an itinerant lama who prepared a mixture of herbs and spices (including rosehips) which was boiled for ten minutes, then strained and drunk. Mineral steam baths in natural hot springs are recommended for rheumatism and arthritis, as well as to stimulate the circulation, and fasting is recommended for a variety of other disorders. For repair of broken bones, the Tibetans have acquired much skill while caring for their many animals. One disease which perennially threat-ened the life of the. young is small-pox, but Western medicines, especially vaccines and injected serums such as penicillin, have recently controlled this infectious disease. Women practice natural childbirth and are assisted by other women in the family or village. Mothers receive plenty of helpful advice before and after birth, the death rate is very low, and children are commonly healthy and normal. In remote parts of Tibet, where few medical practitioners are available, medical knowledge and training is passed down from father to son, and each family has preserved a variety of traditional household remedies. Doctors, motivated by compassion, are known to travel day and night under difficult conditions to effect their cures, and, when certain medicinal remedies fail to take effect after a period of time, Tibetans assume the disease is a natural outflow of the person's Karma. A lama, who is also often ihe doctor, is called in to perform various ritual ceremonies, mantras and blessings, and the power invested in these spiritual aids is frequently successful where medical remedies are ineffective. Similarly, yogis and meditation prac-titioners often heal themselves through their understanding of natural processes and their use of specific mantras. The Tibetans either bury their.dead in the ground, cremate the bodies, or, in a special ritual, dissect the body and feed the pieces as offerings to vultures. The bones of very important lamas are sometimes preserved as relics for stupas and ritual objects, and at times the entire body is dried, gilded and preserved as a sacred image. A deep under-standing of the transitory nature of all life is thus deeply imbedded in the Tibetan mentality from the earliest_age. The stable Tibetan life style and the inevitable panoramic per-spective that develops through the practice of Buddhism is not con-ducive to mental illness. Although Tibetans have to face the natural human limitations imposed by illness, old age and death, they experi-ence little mental suffering or intellectual confusion. From childhood they are taught to take responsibility for their problems and to view"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, PeopLe and CuLture 213 suffering as a teacher and impermanence as a valuable guide. Their lives are all of one piece, and not disturbed by a variety of sensations and stimulations. Satisfaction comes from an acceptance of their lives as they are, not as the:x: might wish them co be, and so anxiety, resentment and fantasy-filled expectations do not sway their simple, genuine and cheerful natures. Nor do Tibetans suffer from polluted, crowded or noisy conditions. They work steadily during the planting and harvest seasons, and more leisurely during the winter. Clear water and air blend well with their natural, non-artificial diet. The Dharma Prior to the occupation of Tibet, anyone could practice the Dharma. As soon as children were old enough to say their mother's name, they were taught the mantra 0¥ MA~I PADME HD¥. Even if an individual could not read, every Tibetan-herdsman, villager, trader or official-soon became familiar with the basic teachings: that this life is precious, rare and unique; that life is impermanent and death is inevi-table; that the human situation is encircled by frustration and dissatis-faction; and chat one reaps the results of past actions in this and previous lives. The implication of these basic Buddhist teachings affect the life of every Tibetan, for a long heritage of faith and devotion has thoroughly permeated their thinking and behavior. Birth, marriage, joy, sorrow, happiness, pain, sickness, old age and death are all seen as intimately interconnected. This insight, which further recognizes chat each person has within himself a nature identical to the Buddhas, ,has become the basis for the Tibetans' widely acknowledged and all-embracing compass10n. According to the law of Karma, each action and thought leaves its imprint on the character. The present situation, thoughts, habits, emotions and all that is perceived-all existence-is seen as the result of the workings of Karma. Past actions thus establish the potential through which the present is determined, and every action subtly prepares the future. As long as a person is conscious of this continuity, the interrelation of all things, all living beings, and all situations, becomes apparent. This unified view informs the activity and purpose of Tibetan life and underlies a deep trust and faith in their understanding of the attitudes inherent in the practice of Buddhism. There is another reason for this deep spiritual devotion and faith. In Tibet, the great rhythm of nature pervades everything and increases"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"214 Culture one's capacity for concentration and self-observation, spontaneously and without effort. The vastness, solitude and silence of nature acts like a concave mirror which not only enlarges and reflects the innermost feelings and emotions, but concentrates their intensity into the focal point of consciousness. Mind and nature, thus joined, dispel the con-strictions, obstacles and disturbances of daily life to awaken and develop the higher stages of meditation. This heightened sensitivity to the flow and natural rhythm of life seems to emanate a spiritual atmosphere that envelops the whole of Tibet. Where Buddhist theory and practice are concerned, no effort or cost ever seemed too extravagant. Judging by the thousands of volumes that have been translated into Tibetan from Sanskrit and other lan-guages, and from the enormous libraries of Siitras, commentaries, biographies, and other teachings, and judging by the Tibetans' skill in mastering complicated techniques of yoga and their profound knowl-edge of the workings of the human mind, it seems clear that the study and practice of Buddhism became the central occupation of the Tibetan people. Mastering Buddhism in all its varied forms, many teachers were capable of imparting this living tradition to others. The formal introduction of Buddhism in Tibet began in the 8th century with the arrival ofPadmasambhava. By respecting the national feelings and loyalities of the people and without destroying the ancient traditions of the country, he gave a new impetus to Buddhism and succeeded in building the first large monastery in Tibet at Samye. Here the teachings of the Bodhisattva Path (Mahayana) and the Tantras (Vajrayana) were introduced and handed down to Padmasambhava's closest disciples. Later, when Buddhism was suppressed for a brief time, these disciples scattered, transmitting the original teachings of Padmasambhava to their spiritual followers. Some of these yogins married and were known as nag-pa (sngags-pa) or lay followers. Others, called the •silent ones', were solitary wanderers who practiced meditation in caves or remote hermitages. As they traveled, they continued to pro-duce many translations and to spread the Tantric tradition through-out Tibet. These yogins, many of whom were direct disciples of Padmasambhava, believed that the goal of enlightenment, or Buddha-hood, could be gained in a single lifetime, and set themselves whole-heartedly on this path. It is interesting to observe that Indian and Tibetan society have never abandoned those who reject their social norms and conventions."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"216 Culture Since both the yogi and monk traditionally avoid the acttvtty of ordinary human life and its conventional values and devote themselves to the rigorous path of enlightenment, Tibetans recogni~e and respect all ·who dedicate themselves to the Buddhadharma without discrimi-nating between members of various schools. Thus if a religious person, on a pilgrimage to seek teachings or visit a shrine, passes through a village, the people greet him warmly and offer him food and lodging in their homes. At times, ten or fifteen lamas might gather together in this way, and perhaps a hundred villagers might participate in the recitation of prayers, meditation and, at certain holy times, ritual ceremonies. Monastic Life. Buddhism was not introduced into Tibet all at once, but at different times by different teachers. Somewhat later, in the eleventh century, Atisa founded several monasteries in western Tibet where the study and practice of Buddhism became the recognized cen-tral activity of organized groups, the monastic Sangha. Originally, small hermitages were built near the meditation caves of spiritual masters. Not far from Samye, for example, about 500 feet below the summit of a hill, there is a small shrine revered by the Nyingmapas which preserves the site where Padmasambhava practiced meditation. A great number of similar caves served as meditation chambers and as permanent abodes of hermits and monks, so chat the entire area became saturated with a fervor of religious devotion and a life of contemplation in an environment of overwhelming solitude and silence. In hermitages such as these, meditators might remain for one, three, five and even cen years or more, practicing visualization tech-niques and mastering the advanced teachings. Those who lived singly or in small groups often attracted others who were seeking masters qualified and willing to initiate them in spiritual practice. These teachings were often communicated through oral instruction and non-verbal interaction with the teacher and were not given away for the mere asking. To request the teachings required a corresponding com-mitment on the part of the disciple, and all who came into contact with an authentic master soon realized this. These small communities, often constructe~ high in a gorge or far from the norrrial stream of commerce, possessed little or no land, and they depended for their food and other minimal supplies on nearby residents, the ingenuity of the disciples, or on the families of those who resided there. Monasteries thus developed close relationships with nearby villages, each providing essential mutual services to the other."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Culture 219 Monasteries nurtured the religious, educational and cultural climate of the community, and laymen in rum supported the monks with gifts of food and other necessities. Tibetan monasteries-except for the large founding monasteries of each of the schools-were relatively small, housing fifty to two hundred monks, and often only ten or twenty. Monks were distin-guished from the lay Sangha primarily by their observance of a number of disciplinary vows, as well as celibacy. Lamas, on the other hand, might also choose to marry and live as laymen. As many texts became available, and lamas acquired skills in interpretation and commentary, the monasteries evolved into teaching and training colleges and pro-vided formal educational instruction in logic and philosophy as well as the performance of rituals and advanced meditation practices. Within monasteries, the practice of Buddhism embraced an immensely di-verse world of scholastic and religious functions. Comparable to mod-em colleges of arts and letters, they soon became educational centers of encyclopedic knowledge and possessed a rich and subtle philos-ophy with their own dialectics and metaphysics, an advanced depth psychology which employed meditative techniques to control psycho-physiological functions, and countless ceremonial rituals for the attainment of higher states of consciousness. These monasteries were modeled on the renowned Buddhist universities of a thousand years ago, such as Nalanda and Vikramasila, and maintained high standards of scholarship. Following acceptance, a new student was taught co read, write and memorize the Buddha's discourses, and embarked on an intensive and extensive period of study which normally lasted for fourteen years or more. This included the practice of the Vinaya, or virtues of the monk, and instructions in chanting, mudra, painting and sculp-ture; an exploration of the Abhidharma literature (e.g. Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakoia and Asanga's Abhidharmasamuccaya); the meanings of the Siitras and their commentaries; the Prajfiaparamita literature (the study of the doctrine of Siinyata); the philosophy of the Madhyamaka as taught by Nagarjuna, Candrakirti and their successors, and there-upon, initiation into the Tantras, or esoteric teachings. Upon com-pletion of each area of study, students were granted degrees which correspond, variously, to the number of vows taken, scriptures read, and classes attended-all of which required a demonstration of mastery. Should a student, upon examination, prove co be a master of all studies, he was entitled co a variety of scholastic and monastic degrees, accord-"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"220 Culture ing co his particular school and the function for which he was training, and thus became authorized co train others, academically and spiri-tually. Progress coward such degrees might cake many years, until the candidate's mastery was unquestioned. The teachings of the Hinayana and Mahayana were available to everyone, but the Tantric teachings, the Vajrayana, were given only co those who were judged sufficiently prepared to receive and understand them; otherwise these teachings might be misinterpreted or misused, consciously or unconsciously. The practice of the Tantras is likened to atomic energy, which can be used for constructive or destructive purposes. But if these esoteric teachings are pursued diligently, they open up to the practitioner the possibility of attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime. Some monasteries traditionally emphasized 'learning by heart' to such an extent that writing and notetaking were discouraged. Learning to write and compose Tibetan was not necessarily considered essential to the acquisition of true religious knowledge. Only after a student became a master was he encouraged to write, and these works wen~ often commentaries on the scriptures for one's own self-edification. Lama Mi-pham and others, however, wrote many excellent treatises at an early age. During examinations, which often took the form of conventionalized debates-successful candidates were expected to dis-play a theoretical and experiential knowledge of Buddhist doctrines, quoting liberally and precisely from revered texts. Through years of training, they memorized considerable quantities of sacred literature and became, as it were, great repositories of the Dharma, able to produce from their store any text or quotation which served the immediate argument. It was not unusual for a monk trained in this manner to sit for three or four days and chant the Dharma literature from memory. The success of this concentrated effort to absorb texts for oral reproduction was considered supremely more valuable than possessing a vast library, especially in moments of practice when pas-sages could easily be recalled, deepening awareness and understanding. Both the academic and business organization of the monastery were under the central control of the Grand Lama who was always a living Buddha (sprul-sku, pron. tul-ku). Under his guidance, for ex-ample, a variety of regents and administrators presided over religious ceremonies, both within the monastery and in the surrounding vil-lages, managed monastery property and governed its maintenance, conducted affairs of business and trade, oversaw the work of thanka artists, craftsman, carpenters and the cutting of wooden blocks for the"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Culture 221 Illustrated manuscript of the Prajiiaparamita Sutra (Perfection of Wisdom) priming of Dharma texts, and whatever else was necessary to maintain the monastic city. Since the time of Padmasambhava, making translations and pre-serving the handwritten Buddhist texts offered the monks a time-consuming occupation. Books written on palm leaves or other vegeta-tive matter, especially texts brought from India, tended to deteriorate after fifty years, and thus the entire literature required extensive recopy-ing and renewing. One notable craft adopted for general use from China was the art of papermaking and printing from incised wooden blocks called xylographs. To print in this way requires a school of highly trained wood-carvers, for every letter on the page has to be carved with the utmost precision so that it remains standing ready to receive the ink, while the rest of the wood is cut away. A skilled carver might complete an average-sized woodblock (measuring 4\" X 16\" and carrying 300 characters) in seven to ten days. Books were not bound but enclosed between two elaborately carved wooden bookends, or wrapped in silk. From the time of its introduction, this form of priming was a great advance and was taken up eagerly by the Tibetans, for this enabled them to make as many copies of their sacred texts as"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"222 Culture they pleased. The entire Tibetan Buddhist Canon (Tripi{aka), con-sisting of 4,681 texts, was first printed in this manner in Peking (1411 A.D.). Thereafter, each large monastery developed its own printing facility, but Derge in eastern and Narthang in central Tibet became two main printing establishments, along with printing centers in Lhasa, and Ragya (Amdo). These monasteries stored thousands upon thousands of carved woodblocks, ready to reprint co order. Even today, however, many Tibetan books, written within the last century by ad~anced masters, exist only in the original handwritten manuscript. It is a historical fact that when a culture is threatened, the people record their indigenous literature and most important traditions in writing. A few of these texts have_ been preserved outside of Tibet, and their distribution and translation will certainly become a major task in the years ahead. Festivals. Rituals performed in monasteries were not open to the public, but religious festivals, celebrated by lamas dressed in elaborate dance costumes, attracted many lay people. These festivals, which were meant to renew the people's faith, also provided a welcome time of leisure. For example, on New Year's day in Lhasa (or Losar, the first day of the first moon, usually in February), the city's population of 80,000 attended a large prayer meeting which was dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings. After elaborate preparations, 20,000 monks joined the lay people to swell the city streets where the reading of scriptures, religious debates, feasting and colorful folk dances followed consecu-tively from dawn until midnight for several days. In the early morning of the lase day, the stomping boots of dancers punctuate the clash of cymbals and drums, and the deafening drones of shrill horns announce the beginning of the Sacred Masked Dance (Cham). Unlike other festivals which present mime and dance narratives of well-known stories from Tibetan Buddhist history, the Cham is a solemn masked dance performed by trained and agile monk dancers in elaborately designed costumes. Accompanied by music but without words, the dances are masterpieces of choreography and symbolism. Every gesture of the hands and feet is meant to imitate the activity and expression of the deity which is symbolized by each dancer. In mid-summer, monks and villagers gather on the slopi:ng, green mountain sides for another fire ceremony and enjoy dramatic presen-tations of Buddhist legends and tales (a-che lha-mo). Once, for ex-"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Culture 223 ample, there was a· hermit named Milarepa who lived in a cave. One day, a frightened deer, who is being chased vigorously by a wild and savage hound, enters his cave seeking refuge. Seeing the helpless nature of all animated beings, Milarepa explains the all-embracing protection of the Dharma, and saves the deer. When the dog arrives at the cave, he too finds the warmth of compassion and sits down in a friendly fashion next to the deer. Meanwhile, the hunter follows the trail to the cave and is amazed to see the deer anQ hound sitting together. Aware that he is in the presence of an extraordinary hermit, the hunter questions Milarepa who sings him a song: The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha-These three are Mila's refuge. The View, the Practice and the Action-These three Dharmas Mila practices. The snow, the rocks and the clay mountains-These three are where Mila meditates. The sun, the moon and the stars-These three are Mila's expanse. Bliss, Illumination and Non-thought-These three are Mila's companions. Porridge, roots and nettles-These three are Mila's food. Water from snow, spring and brook-These three are Mila's drink. The Nadis, Breaths and Bindus-These three are Mila's clothing. [Chang, p. 147} Upon h~ring this, the huntsman experiences a change of heart and requests from Milarepa the teaching of the Dharma and the Path to liberation. Literature. While there are many regional dialects in Tibet, one printed script unifies the whole of Tibetan literary culture. Of the students King Song-tsen Gam-po sent to India in the middle of the 7th century, Thu-mi Sam-bho-ta returned to devise a written script for the Tibetan language which he derived from languages similar to Sanskrit. The Tibetan alphabet consists of four vowels and thirty con-sonants, several of which are said to have been brought to Tibet by"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"224 Culture Padmasambhava. In addition, the sounds of at least six Tibetan letters are not reproduced in any other language. U-me, the handwritten form of Tibetan, has nine or ten different styles depending on the region, while U-chen, the printed script, has remained unchanged from the earliest times. Just as modern English contains a vast and specific vocabulary of technical terms related to science and industry, the precise nature of the Tibetan language lends itself to the expression of fine shades of meaning and embraces a vast philosophical vocabulary which enables the language to define accurately the nature of mind and consciousness. This is evident from the time of the Golden Age of Padmasambhava in the 8th century when, with the aid of Santarak~ica, Vimalamitra and Vairocana, the scriptural canons of the Kangyur (150 volumes) and the Tangyur (240 volumes) were translated from the Sanskrit. These translations were not simply word-for-word equivalents. The Tibetans have always concerned themselves with the 'meaning in usage' of a term, and their translations reflect the interpreted and refined under-standing of the translators. In this way written Tibetan acquired a unique ability to ~xpress difficult concepts and still preserve the living spirit of Buddhism. Texts which were not translated at that time, but which represent the original works of Padmasambhava and his disciples, or works discovered at a later time (gter-ma), were com-piled in large collections known as the 'Tantras of the Ancient Ones' (rNying-ma'i rgyud-'bum) and the 'Revealed Treasures' (Rin-chen gter-mdzod) of the Nyingmapas. Education in Tibet was primarily the domain and privilege of the monasteries where a strong oral tradition of teaching was faithfully preserved and where indigenous Tibetan literature-epics, biographies, legends and songs-were wri teen down in a permanent form. These lama-authors-unlike scribes of ocher lands and times who could not understand the language they copied-were prolific scholars of ency-clopedic learning and vision. They produced many original works and commentaries on philosophy, logic, religion and ethics; textbooks on grammar, dictionaries and bibliographies; treatises on astrology and medicine; histories, geographies and travelogues; treatises on the art of government and on various skilled crafts such as agriculture, casting, painting and printing; and a vast variety of songs, poems, plays, novella-biographies, collections of tales, and epics.

Contests featuring clever innuendoes and light mockery, as well as folk songs, dancing and the telling of legendary tales, were favorite pastimes and were spread throughout Tibet by wandering bards, traders and pilgrims. In the 11th century, Milarepa, in his Hundred Thousand Songs, popularized Buddhist thought by composing lively lyrical songs containing countless details from real life. The lovdy flowers of turquoise-blue Are destroyed in time by frost-This shows the illusory nature of all beings, This proves the transient nature of all things. First think on these things, Then you will practice Dharma. [Chang, p. 97] This practice of using natural imagery, though ancient, reveals a unifying visionary thread which ties folk realism to religious didacti-cism. In paintings, for example, Milarepa is usually depicted with his right hand up to his ear, a gesture which expresses both poetic and religious inspiration and which characterizes the epic bard who receives revelations from the heavenly muses. At festivals and other times, the bard who chanted portions of the epics-such as the Wondrous Story of Ling Gesar-might enter a meditation-induced 'trance', so that through him the epic hero might chant his startling and amazing adventures in the realms of both gods and men. This kind of 'separate world' is traditionally represented as an inexhaustible repository of inspiration and knowledge available to seers and visionaries in the process of meditation. Other treasures, manuscripts written on rolls of yellow pa-per and hidden caves, within special rocks and at the bottom of pools, have also been discovered. These texts (Terma), which were originally written down and concealed by Padmasambhava, Ye-shey Tso-gyal, and other disciples to await discovery at a future time, have provided a continuous flow of teachings which have preserved the original spirit of Buddhism. Some of these, most notably the Padma Thang Yig, which celebrates Padmasambhava's life and times, and the Bardo Thodol, or Tibetan Book of the Dead-which comprises a small portion of a larger Nyingma work discovered by Karma Ling-pa-have become well-known treasures of Tibetan literature."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"226 Culture Art. The art of thanka painting plays .a major role in this tradi-tion of visionary revelation. Tibetan art does not merely 'hold the mirror up to nature', but reveals, through imagery, color, proportion and symbolic detail, the nature and landscape of the human mind. This the Buddhists term funyata, which in the ultimate sense, is void of all earthly and illusory conceptions. This doctrine points out that man's self, his mind, and the objects of his attention are all expressions of a nameless state of consciousness that can be termed 'intrinsic aware-ness'. The figures of deities and their postures, gestures, colors, orna-ments and spatial relationships each carry a message of complex design, and communicate a depth of experience and subtlety of understanding that represents, through relative forms, human nature in its ultimate manifestation as identical to the qualities and awareness of the Buddha. The Enlightened One, as represented in art, is thus depicted as ultimate perfection and beauty, both to arouse the viewer's appreciation and to spur him to seek the highest qualities inherent in his own nature. The use of symbols in Tibetan art demonstrates a powerful means whereby insights, which cannot be grasped conceptually and which are normally inaccessible to our ordinary human vision, are charged with an illuminating energy. Symbols are meant to embody the innate presence of the Buddha-the self-originated, unborn, unchangeable essence of all beings. Lke a diamond imbedded in a mountain, this primordial nature of Being is illusively concealed by a film of preju-dice, erroneous spiritual conceptions and worldly bewilderments. The various Peaceful and Wrathful Buddhas, both radiant and awesome, at once exemplify man's highest ideals and stimulate in the meditator the dispersal of anxiety, anger, depression, guilt, dullness of feeling, inabil-ity to communicate, frustrated expectations-all the obstacles to free-dom ofbody, speech and mind. The celestial bodies of Buddhas, seen as emanations of primordial energy become visible, embody a wealth of psychological and philosophical understanding of human behavior and human needs in all their variety, complexity and depth. Symbols, in the intensity of their implied intuitive meanings, become subtle catalysts whereby the meditator can break through mental and physical obstades in the actual situations of human life and discover the opportunities and healthy attitudes that lead to a deepening of self-acceptance, light, beauty, and peace. But the primary 'utility' of Tibetan art is not necessarily what it presents or symbolizes, but simply and ultimately that it is-a manifestation of enlightened consciousness which enables"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Siikyamuni Buddha surrounded by Miira's Host (following two pages).lwang Temple (Tsang Province)"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"230 Culture the viewer to see all that ex_ists, including himself, as participating in the ultimate perfection of beauty and truth. The creation of this art is in itself a meditation. Painters and sculptors, known as 'depictors of deities', are regarded as humble craftsmen rather than originators of new forms. The primary function of Buddhist art is not to express an individual vision or to explore new forms, but to awaken and enliven the intuitive awareness of both the artist and viewer. Beyond the mindfulness required of each brush-stroke, the execution of this art is highly stylized. As in the poetic creation of the bard, the artist visualizes the deities in meditation before and during painting, and follows elaborate instructions as to the appropriate time and method of drawing the figures in ink, mixing colors and applying paint. Each deity is associated with a specific spiritual practice, and the execution of a single painting may take weeks and even months as the various visualizations, mantras and rituals are performed. The paintings, seen as guides to perfection and perfection itself, are executed to correspond exactly to ultimate reality so that the painter and viewer might be invested with the deity's qualities and ways of being. This art is therefore considered eminently sacred by the Tibetans, for it has great power to effect profound transformations in one's level of consciousness. In pointing to a 'divine' realm, thanka art clearly indicates the value and significance of human beings, particularly in that moment of appreciation wherein the 'message' of the art and one's own experience merges in the light of a deeply felt comprehension of universal insight. The thankas thus not only depict Bodhisattvas who serve the enlightenment of all beings, but the thankas themselves partake of that enlightening power to open the perception and aware-ness of the viewer, and are thus considered as sacred as the deities they represent. There are five lineages of thanka painting in Tibet. Stylistically, Tibetan art reflects various degrees of Indi(ln, Nepalese, Persian, Mon-golian and Chinese influences. The clouds, the density or brightness of the paint, the number of displayed offerings, the ornamentations of jewelry,. clothing, and landscape all vary according to the time and location of each individual painting. It is sometimes said that, because Tibetan art follows strict guidelines for imagery and proportion, the artist relinquishes the potential freedom of imaginative creativity.

Further, paintings were created as an act of devotion, irrespective of whether they would be seen or not. More than mere decorations, they were prayers and meditations in line and color. For this reason, scroll paintings and frescoes were often lavishly encrusted with gold and minutely executed, but later they might even be placed in the darkest corners of the temples. Despite the minute execution of details, some fresco-figures are three, five, and even ten times larger than life, while others, no larger than a thumbnail, contain figures complete in every detail. Merely to trace these delicate lines accurately demands the most intensive concentration and permits the artist to relinquish his own (samsaric) identity and enter the bodies, personalities, thoughts,"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Tibet: The Land, People and Cultrm 233 feelings, and innermost life of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Lamas, Yidams, I)akas, I)akinis, Raksas, and the forty-two Peaceful and fifty-eight Wrathful Deities, each with different faces, colors, orna-mentations and symbols. The artist thus enters an inexpressible man4ala, whereby the invisible becomes visible and appreciation merges with understanding. The Tibetans' love of nature appears in their bright and joyful depiction of sky, clouds, valleys, rivers and animals which form the customary background to the central figure of the thanka. In particular, those paintings which illustrate the life stories of great teachers and saints-the Buddha, Padmasambhava, Gesar, Milarepa, the Eighty-four Accomplished Ones-often depict extravagant biographical scenes, showing for example, the Buddha's birth, his life in court, his renun-ciation, his enlightenment, his turning the wheel of the Dharma, and his ParinirvaQ.a or passing away. A wandering story teller would often carry numerous rolls of thankas, perhaps those depicting the fable-stories of the Jataka Tales, and point out the scenes on the painting with a stick as he sang or chanted the narrative. This technique of illustrated recitation circulated among monks in India, China and Japan, and long captions were sometimes written under .each scene to identify the figures and episodes. The sculptured images of Tibet, known as ritpas, are variously made from wood, metal, papier-mache and clay. The large temple images are usually constructed from hardened clay, which is sun-dried, gilded and painted. Smaller metal images are cast by the 'lost-wax' method, where the original form is first shaped in wax and then buried in packed earth. When wax is melted out, molten metal is poured into the resultant mold. Bronze and brass are generally used but sometimes a highly-prized silver-gold alloy is substituted. Copper images are hammered into proper shape, and decorated with turquoise and coral inlays. The Tibetan rupas are hollow, and in a ceremony called Rabs-gnas zhu-gi-pa, officiating lamas place mantras, relics, jewels, precious metals, and various consecrated material in the inner cavity which is then sealed with a copper plate and marked with a crossed vajra ( + ). This multiplicity of forms and metaphors thus reveals the Tibetan predilection that, at some time and some place, there must be some path or practice, or some appealing visible manifestation of ultimate and inherent r~lity, which is suited to the consciousness of every sen-tient being."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Tibet: The LAnd, People and Culture 235 Conclusion Only a handful of Westerners-ambassadors, anthropologists, mountain climbers and private adventurers-have ever glimpsed the Tibetan civilization first-hand. And Western scholars, -having little choice but to study Tibetan literature as a classical language, seldom participated in a living, seasoned relationship with the history, legends, religion and iconography of the Tibetan people. Without a compre-hensive knowledge of Tibetan language, culture, philosophy and spir-itual practice, subjective observations and misinterpretations led to the extreme view that Tibet was a country overrun by magicians or that their art displayed a rampant eroticism. Internal symbologies repre-senting an elaborate investigation of human nature require time, ex-planation and participation. Thus, even though many people are now aware that the Tibetans developed a sophisticated culture of vast learning, the depths of their knowledge-demonstrated by their rich oral methods of teaching-have remained unexplored and inaccessible to the West. Many changes have inevitably affected the life and ways of the Tibetan people. Some would even say that Tibet's misfortune is the Western world's unique and unprecedented inheritance. What matters, then, is that the continuity of Tibet's cultural and spiritual heritage, which is based on a living tradition and conscious connection with man's origins, not be severed. Buddhism recognizes change as the nature of all life. The test of its versatility, adaptability and universality lies, perhaps, in the chal-lenges which are offered by communication with the West. Here, may the strength and character of this ancient tradition give new birth to the timeless concern of all men. References and Further Readings An-che, Li. A Lamasery in Outline,].

The Tibetan, who is highly individualistic, therefore recognizes and respects innumerable forms of rdigious practice and devotion, and, in fact, there are many different schools of Buddhism in Tibet-as different from each other as the various Christian Churches and sects -but there is no enmity or sense of competition between them. They live peacefully side by side and recognize each ocher's validity. By accepting a teacher from one school one does not exclude those of other schools. Indeed, very often the teachings or methods of different schools complement and help each other in the most effective way. The individualistic attitude in religious matters is expressed in a well-known Tibetan proverb: Lung-pa re-re ka-lug re, Lama re-re chO-Iug re. Every district has its own dialect, Every Lama his own doctrine. According to this principle, people are free to accept or to reject beliefs or practices according to their conviction and to express their opinions freely and fearlessly. Religious discussions are always welcomed, and people who can give convincing expresl]ion to their ideas are highly respected. The art of public discussion was particularly fostered by the big monastic universities, like Ganden, Drepung and Sera. At the same time the Tibetan is not so naive as to believe that religious truths can be proved by mere logic or settled by arguments. Tibetan teachers always stress the fact that ultimate truth cannot be expressed in words, but only realized within ourselves. It is therefore not important what we believe, but what we experience and practice, and how it affects us and our surroundings.

Under such circumstances ·it will be easy to understand that the story of Christ and his suffering on the cross for the sake of humanity is something that appeals deeply to the religious feelings of the average Tibetan. But if somebody would tell him: \"Now you must abandon all other saints and saviors and only worship this one,\" he would be surprised and shocked at such a demand. Because to him the proof of truth lies in the very fact that at all times and among all peoples enlightened religious leaders and saints have appeared, who brought the message of love and compassion and re-established the knowledge of that ultimate Reality, which Christians identify with God, Hindus with Brahman, and Buddhists with the state of Enlightenment, beyond words and definitions. If Christianity could not make headway in Tibet, in spite of che warm reception which was accorded to early missionaries, then this had its reason not in a rejection of Christ or of his essential teachings but, on the contrary, in the fact that the teachings of Christ coincide with and are amply borne out by the Bodhisattva ideal and have been practiced in Tibet more than anywhere in Europe. The second reason, however, was that those who tried to convey the teachings of Christ to Tibet were unwilling co recognize the great thoughts and saints of that country, and were more concerned with their own parochial outlook and man-made dogmas than with the universal message of Christ. Nothing could illustrate better the Tibetan attitude towards Christianity than the following historical instances which amply bear out my contention. THE FIRST CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY to reach Tibet was the Por-tuguese Padre Antonio de Andrade, who in the year 1625 was re-ceived with great _hospitality at Tsaparang by the King of Guge in Western Tibet.

Was ir nor possible char in the countries of the West many a Bodhisattva had arisen, of whom the people of the Ease had not yet heard?

And the King gave even his own garden to the stranger, a gift which under the conditions of Tibet, where gardens are scarce and a rare luxury, was more chan a mere police gesture. But, alas, the King in his unsuspecting goodness did not know thac; the stranger had come not merely to exchange true and beautiful thoughts with chose who were striving after similar ideals, but to repudiate che t~chings of Buddhism, in order to replace them by what he regarded as the sole truth. The conflict was inevitable: discontent spread in the country, and the political opponents of the Kin·g rose against him. While Padre Andrade, encouraged by his success in Tsaparang, pro-ceeded to Lhasa in order to extend his activities over the whole of Tibet, a revolt broke out in Western Tibet, the King was overthrown, and with him the Guge dynasty and the glory ofTsaparang came co an end. AoouT A CENTURY LATER, in 1716, the Jesuit Padre Desideri arrived in Lhasa. He was given a beautiful house, provided with all the comfort of an honored guest, and was allowed to propagate his religion by preaching as well as through writing. In fact, he wrote a book in order to refute certain Buddhist teachings which created much interest. This is how Desideri recorded the event: \"My house suddenly became the scene of incessant comings and goings by all sorts of people, chiefly learned men and professors, who came from the monasteries and universities, especially those of Sera and Drepung, the principal ones, to apply for permission to read the book.\" Tibet in those days was certainly more civilized than contempor-ary Europe, where heretics and their books were burned and persecuted.

On the one hand, nature presents itself in such enchanting beauty and grandeur that creations of human origin appear to be dwarfed and insignificant in comparison. On the other hand, nature displays its ferocious and destructive forces which challenge the very existence of man. But the more a man has to struggle against the adverse forces of nature, the greater is the intensity of his inner life and of his creative imagination. In order to balance the powerful influences of the external world he has to build up his own inner world. This, however, does not happen in an entirely independent or arbitrary way but according to certain laws, and the deeper a man looked within himself, the more it dawned upon him that these laws were the same which created the rhythm of mountains, the eternal song of streams and waterfalls, the fury of blizzards, and the silent beauty of snow and clouds. And it was this discovery which gave man the strength to accept the twofold challenge of nature and made the Himalayas the abode of saints and sages and the refuge of all those who were seekers of truth and beauty, ofbodily and spiritual health. · The profound parallelism of body and soul, spiritual and natural laws, inner and ourer forces, is nowhere more capable of direct ex-periment than in the mountains, and of all mountains nowhere more than in the Himalayas where thousands of years of human devotion have created an atmosphere and tradition which is unequalled by any other region in the world. It is an atmosphere of devotion, which is older than any organized religion or dogma, though many a religious belief may have grown out of it and many systems of religious inter-pretation may have been superimposed on it. \"In the oldest religion, everything was alive, not supernaturally but naturally alive ....

Like a gigantic temple, rising in regular tiers of horizontal ledges and in perfect symmetry, Kailas marks the center of the \"Roof of the World,\" the heart of the biggest temple, the seat and center of cosmic powers, the axis which connects the earth with the universe, the super-antenna for the influx and outflow of the spiritual energies of our planet. The great rhythm of nature pervades everything, and man is woven into it. His imagination is no more a matter of individual fancy; it becomes an instrument of those forces which govern the movements of suns and planets, of oceans and continents, winds and clouds. Imagination here becomes an adequate expression of reality on the plane of human consciousness. Here the gods that were buried in the subconscious regions of the human mind for thousands of years, until their memory had become mere shadows and phantoms, appear again before the pilgrim, and he hears their voices and sees their radiance and knows that he can never lose them again in all his life, because he has been face to face with the Eternal. Thus, the pilgrim feels himself surrounded by many subtle in-fluences, which in accordance with various religious traditions have been described as the presence of divine powers. Whatever their origin or their definition, there is no doubt that a strange transformation of consciousness takes place in those elevated regions and especially around those time-honored places of pilgrimage. One becomes sensi-tive and open to new realities; in short~ the intuitive faculties of the mind are awakened and stimulated. Thus, many of those who felt the call for a life of religious devotion and meditation took advantage of these ideal conditions: some as hermits in solitary caves and hermitages, others in small groups or in monastic communities. The development of the latter was partic-ularly favored by the highly organized character of Tibetan Bud-dhism which exerts its influence over the greater part of the Himalayas and far beyond the confines of Tibet proper: from Ladakh in the west to Bhutan in the east.

And yet, as already pointed out, they are the fulfillment of nature on ·a higher plane, as they express its spirit more than any other thing. This proves their greatness as architecture. In spite of the primitiveness of the materials used, Tibeto-Hima-layan architecture is most effective and often of monumental dimen-sions, like the palace of the former kings of western Tibet at Leh, or some of the bigger monasteries in Ladakh, Spiti, Lahaul, and other Himalayan countries. In the south-eastern Himalayas, similar archi-tectural forms are combined with· slanting and peaked wooden roofs suitable for the more humid climate. What, however, is common to all of them is their emphasis on solidity, strength, massiveness and monumental greatness. They try to emphasize the substantiality and weightiness of matter. This purpose is achieved aesthetically, not only by the use of slanting lines of walls and windows, but also by accen-tuating the edges of their flat roofs with dark red-brown cornices which form a heavy horizontal line (like the protruding edge of a lid), separating most effectively the white or light-ochre walls from the dark blue of the sky. When buildings rise up in a terrace-like fashion, as is mostly the case with big monasteries, these red-brown cornices are like the punctuation in a rising rhythm, and they set off one building against the other beautifully. The same device is used for the small roof-like cornices over every window and verandah and over the main entrances of monastic buildings for which this decoration is exclu-sively reserved. It certainly can be said that this architecture has created a maxi-mum of effect with a minimum of building material and technical aid."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"252 Culture It has created something so powerful and noble that it appeals to people of all races and times.

LoNG-CHEN-PA, Sems-nyid ngal-gso We are constantly searching for some lasting satisfaction, and today there seems to be more grasping and craving in the world than ever before. But the samsaric condition means that everything is imper-manent. We cannot rely on our feelings or thoughts, on money or any external substance. Even though we have no major war, increasing numbers of people are experiencing poverty and many natural resources are dwindling. There is an energy problem, and something as basic as food is a major concern in many parts of the world. The future is uncertain and unpredictable; and mankind's survival seems threatened. When even life itself is impermanent, where can we find refuge?"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 255 We may have very comfortable lives. Our body may be healthy and our mind clear, but in the future, we may not be so COJllfortable. Perhaps when we are older, we will be lonely and no one will care about us-we may not even be able to care for ourselves. We may be in pain and experience tremendous suffering. At that time, the Dharma be-comes especially important, because no matter how old we are, it teaches us to investigate our life and to look at ourselves honestly. Most of our problems are created by negative mental attitudes and feelings of bewilderment, separateness, hopelessness or meaninglessness which constantly tax our life energies. Emotional attachments and unfulfilled cravings only create further discontent. On the other hand, our own suffering can be our best teacher. It can awaken in us the desire to change our habitual patterns of behavior, to examine our dissatis-factions and frustrations. It is certainly possible to overcome repression and anxiery, to eliminate feelings of isolation and separation, and to develop warm and positive feelings for ourselves and others. Once we can see ourselves clearly, we can begin to see the beauty around us and to appreciate our lives on this earth. The best way to develop ourselves as human beings is through compassion. For the Bodhisattva, the essence of Dharma practice and the whole purpose of being in the world is to enlighten other sentient beings. For him, no hardship or difficulty is too great. Nothing else is important. His compassion is all-inclusive because the teachings of the Dharma exclude no one. Compassion begins with totally accepting yourself, just as you are. Learn to accept any inner agitation or discomfort. Open yourself to all life situations, even though you may have many disappointments, pains and frustrations. If we can feel this compassion for ourselves deeply enough, we can totally reverse and heal our negative karma. But compassion is not feeling sorry for yourself. Self-pity stems from weakness. We are anxious or passionate or grasping or occupied with our ego-something is wrong and we feel guilty. Instead, teach yourself to develop positive feelings. The more you can be kind to your own body and mind, the more you can understand and extend this com-passion to others. According to the Buddha, even one single act of open and unreserved compassion can be more effective in relieving pain and suffering in the world than anything else you might accomplish. Meditation and compassion are like the sun and its rays and are the best method for healing emotional and mental dissatisfaction. Medita-tion-if carefully practiced-can return our body and mind to its natural flexibility and help us to develop trust and openness.

What is so unique abou~ your brand of Tibetan Buddhism and what does it have to offer me or other people here in California? Rinpoche: Buddhism may be summarized into three schools basic to Asian countries. First, there was Theravada, which now flourishes in Ceylon and Southeast Asia. Then in northern India, China, Mongolia, and Japan, Mahayana Buddhism took root, and later on, the esoteric practice, which is called Vajrayana unfolded. These three yanas_ or teachings have all been preserved in Tibetan Buddhism. In my opinion, which may not necessarily be true, there are several things Tibetan Buddhism can contribute that are unique. One of the most important is the range of its psychology. Western psychol-ogy, although it is very practical in certain aspects, is not fully com-prehensive. It has not yet discovered the full potential of the human mind. In this area, Buddhism has much to contribu~e and there is already a very healthy interest in Tibetan Buddhism on the part of some Western psychologists and mental health professionals. In addition, although Western psychology has many techniques and interesting theories, it offers very little which can effectively transmute human problems in a sort of recycling of psychic energy. Usually when problems arise, a person either fights his problem or denies it or tri~s to avoid it. There is no way to deal with it directly or use the energy generated by emotional problems or neuroses. In those areas, particularly, I think Vajrayana, the esoteric part of the Buddha's teachings, can bel p tremendously. The key to most of the problems of human life on earth lies in understanding the human mind. We always fed our problems can be solved in some external way, but almost all of our problems are in reality manifestations of our human mind. So in dealing with these situations, we must directly understand the entire reach of the mind."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"258 Practice Question: I'm a Buddhist and a therapist. I want to know how to be a good Buddhist therapist. Rinpoche: In therapy, the most important thing is compassion-not just treating the person to gain more understanding of his situation, but completely giving yourself, trying to open your mind fully to those with whom you work. Compassion is essential to Buddhist practice and therapy, not only to explain something to a person in a way that he understands, but to provide an atmosphere of openness and loving-kindness towards that person. Compassion is the major focus of Buddhism. Question: What is the relationship between therapist and patient? Rinpoche: In Tibet, there are four major schools; the earliest ohe is called 'Nyingma'. Like all the schools, the Nyingmapa has developed inner practices which are passed on through oral instructions. Also, there are many texts and a vast literature. These texts categorize all human beings under nine classifications. Each person at any given moment manifests a specific level of awareness. The master, teacher, or therapist is a person who can understand each level of human consciousness, through his own experience, as well as through having received oral instructions. He can then easily deal with any problem. He cannot mistreat anyone, and there are no gaps between him and another person. He can put himself totally in the place of the patient. In other words, he is not treating somebody else; in a way, he is treating himself. There is no discrimination. Question: What assumption does the Buddhist therapist have to make about himself and about his patient? Rinpoche: The Buddhist therapist must understand the human intel-lectually, plus he must understand himself and how his own mind works. Through this he is better able to deal with the consciousness, perceptions, cognitions, and behaviors of others. Whatever human behavior he may encounter, he has a deeper understanding. I think this deeper understanding comes from practices which involve spiritual or religious knowledge. Through them, he can understand how the total human mind works, how it reacts and what the consequences are. He can understand the emotional levels, the positive and negative levels. Then, when something internal arises, he understands how this works through his own experience; rather than according to theory. This"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 259 requires a great amount of inward study, inner depth. A really qualified therapist comprehends fully what mind is, but not just on the intel-lectual level. He is &finitely required to have experience. Question: How would you define health and disease and the phenom-enon of healing? Rinpoche: There are many different techniques in healing. One person may have developed the use of visualization, another the chanting of mantras or meditation. There are also various ways of healing through the use of various devotional channels. We tend to believe a healer is someone special, who is indispensable. He can heal me and thus solve my problems. But I think that the essential healing can be done by oneself. For example, if you have a physical or mental problem, breathe deeply and relax completely. You can experience a revitalizing feeling on this first level. This is just the elementary level, but as beginners we need to feel the sensations that accompany real relaxation. Once you are completely relaxed, both physically and mentally, there is a feeling of calmness; and that calm relaxation inwardly increases a very subtle energy, which you yourself can develop and continue to increase. This healing energy can be useful in dealing with our everyday problems or conflietJ.9.g emotions. Once you sense this feeling, you eventually reach a state where you no longer have a restricting self-identity. The tense-ness of the ego is gone, you don't feel you possess a self, and you become a pare of the relaxation. The relaxation feeds you, it transforms you, and you experience the state of what is sometimes called 'Samadhi' or bliss. This healing we can generate from our own mind and physical body, which is different from someone who has particular healing techniques. Question: How does that relate to what you spoke of before-the difference between solving a problem, which is therapy perhaps, and using the energy to transform the problem, which is the aim of Vajrayana? Rinpoche: As beginners, we are all in the process of finding inner truth. We may begin slowly and gradually, step by step, to transcend all negativities. Immediately perhaps, we can't do it. However, we can definitely learn something from our problems and difficulties. At that particular moment, just relax. Energy itself becomes transformed."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"260 Practice Question: How do you treat people diagnosed as schizophrenics? Rinpoche: The best way to treat people is not to make them suspicious of you. I think the best treatment is by not creating extra problems. The more you label the problem, the more it is increased. So the best way is to treat them as normal. In other words, a good psychologist will not act as if there were something wrong or different about the person. Everywhere and with everyone problems exist all of the time. There may be different characteristics, but the basic human problem is the same everywhere. The more I learn of other problems, my problem automatically dissolves. If I can respond compassionately to another person's problem, communitation becomes a sort of healing link that operates in both directions. The more we understand other people, we respond more compassionately. This is the beginning of openness. The more open you become, the less problems you have. You are dedicated to all sentient beings, which is part of the idea of the Bodhisattva. Knowledge of the other increases self-knowledge, and self-knowledge increases compassion. Parents are also very important, and Buddhism asks us to consider how much struggling most of our parents have gone through in order to give us the best they could offer and to see us through childhood. We easily forget this-we only take selfishly, without giving back anything. The more you make similar observations and the less you dwell on your own problems, the more your com passion grows. Buddhism further teaches that you are the parents of all sentient beings countless numbers of times, and they have been your parents. As one realizes this, each relationship becomes based on feelings of love-not calculated love, but a natural friendliness to all beings, a natural openness based on a human understanding of interrelationship. I think this is one of the most important Buddhist activities. Buddha activity means compassion. And what is the purpose? let's say you become enlightened. Does that mean you completely retire? Or that there is nothing left to do? We say that until all sentient beings become enlightened we have a purpose. In fact, the purpose of my becoming enlightened is for the sake of all sentient beings, not for the sake of myself. Gradually, the whole idea of self-motivation dis-appears, and one sees that when you have no 'self'-motivation and 'self'-interest, then all of your problems get solved-there no longer exists any individual problem."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 261 Question: Do you see any difference in various kinds of psychotherapy in terms of which has more compassion? Rinpoche: I chink the person who is the best therapist is one who has gorie beyond therapy himself. He should no longer think in terms of therapy. If the person is no longer a <cherapist', then he is a good therapist. That means he has great compassion. Some schools of thought may place more emphasis on compassion than others, but even though there are different schools and different traditions, it rests finally with the individual-some are more developed and are more actively compassionate than ochers. Question: What advice would you give to someone who came to you saying, «I'm very depressed, life has no meaning for me. I'm thinking ofkilling myself. Why should I live, why should I go on?\" Rinpoche: Well, I can teach you not to chink like that. I can teach you that tomorrow is different chan today, and that in the past you have constantly gone up and down. Therefore, you should not be discour-aged with your life. If you are depressed now, you can be learning something about yourself-you can increase your self-knowledge. And I might also give you some advice about self-observation, and perhaps try to find out exactly who you really are. Maybe I would ask the question, «What is the problem, really? Is it really very serious?\" If so, perhaps we can talk more, but usually the problems are really not chat serious. Most of us just think we have a problem. Question: How did we tie ourselves up? Rinpoche: By not being aware. It's possible we really love our frustra-tion-we don't want to give it up. Maybe it's all we know. Human beings are very contradictory. We don't like co have suffering or pain, but on the ocher hand .we do not want to give it up. Once you give up suffering, you can listen to your own awareness. This will guide you and tell you how to continue. If you try to relax for a short rime every day, then a sort of sensation or feeling will begin to arise which gradually turns into something very wonderful, like a healer. In this way you can heal any negativity or any kind of daily problem or conflicting temperament. When thoughts of resentment or discomfort rise, you yourself can heal them. More and more you can eliminate your internal enemies. For"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"262 Practice example, we call anger or frustration an enemy, but all of our negativ-ities can become part of the relaxation. In other words, genuine relax-ation releases energy which can be used to heal ourselves. Question: What is the cause of rising indignation in relation to an external object and what are the factors that would lead to not ex-pressing that indignation? Rinpoche: My perceptions are automatically recorded through my senses and through my conditioning. My subjective activity reacts, responds and communicates with objects, so there is always an interrelationship in which the reaction is instant, automatic. Ordinarily, people cannot cope with this easily or cannot immediately transcend or change it. However, there is a way you can deal with it directly the moment it comes. If, in that present moment of experience, you can go directly towards the meditative state, then there are no longer any subject-object relationships you need to find out about, for these are all results of intellectual speculation. The important thing here is that you do not need to know very much about causes, either internal or external. These are simply explanations offered by the thinking mind. Very practically, when the situation arises, just sit there and be the way you are, and completely cope with that experience of how you are in the moment. This is a task requiring skill. All samsaric problems, no matter what they are, are very useful. Were there no problems there could be no Nirvana, no Bodhisatrvas. So solving samsaric or human mental problems is a learning process based on accurate knowledge. Whether internal or external, this direct experience is the best source of knowledge. Question: How do you let go of the ego, melt down and dissolve self? Rinpoche: Ego has many diffc;rent interpretations, philosophically as well as psychologically. But it may n6t be necessary to melt down the self if you understand it fully. The self is part of the working process and is, in a way, necessary to enlightenment and to whatever goals you may have. In religious or philosophical terms, what we call the ego is something to be denied or done away with, or ~omething to be transcended, but I think the first-level ego-not the selfish ego, but the self-maintaining or self-nurturing awareness-needs ~o be kept alive, even though Buddhism emphasizes that ego is the root and cause of Samsara. In a way, the ego is our projection. You learn about yourself from it. It's"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"like your own growth. The more you watch the ego, the more you learn ... and through this it becomes transformed. So in the begin-ning, ego should not just be wiped out. Question: Is it karma that is reborn or is it the consciousness? Rinpoche: Karma is the process of developing-sort of the product. It is stimulated, cultivated. But the consciousness, the cause, is reborn. The continuation is the consciousness, which has many flavors, sometimes at an unknown level. It covers a lot of territory. Some Buddhist philosophers explain the whole entire universe as a projection of consciousness. In other words, this is the consciousness. Within ourselves, we perhaps make dialogues-this is subject, this is object. For example, at night in a dream, I may have problems, something I don't like-l see it, I grasp it, I deny it, I discriminate, or whatever. Separate things happen within the dream. In the morning I wake up. The subject was there, but now I am here. Still, this is all one dream. There is no separate subject and object. Our waking conscious-ness is similar: once we gee beyond the human consciousness level, both subject and object become unified. There is no separateness left. This is a theory, but there are practical aspects. You have to gradually develop into that stage-one can't just quickly jump to chat state."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"264 Practice Question: Can you say something about the practice of Vajrayana Buddhism? Rinpoche: The practice ofVajrayana Buddhism is a very big subject. But if you do meditation, develop your concentration as much as you can, and gradually move it within every thought, thought itself is a practice. But our immediate question becomes, \"What do I do with my thoughts?\" You can meditate within thought. Don't beat the thought itself, and don't try to ignore it. Just sit inside the thought. Expand it, and the thought itself becomes meditation. This is more or less the basic foundation of the Vajrayana idea. Any thought, any feeling, any discrimination you may have, expand it. From this, the thought has irs own particular field or space, and you can expand it completely. Question: When I visualize, is the image in the space in front of me? Rinpoche: You don't hold the image outside. Awareness-seeing is not eye-seeing. If you look at your room, your house, or your friend, you see a very dear and colorful visual image. Likewise, when you have a memory, you have a distinct impression of seeing something. These images can be very vivid and alive. By seeing inside, without involving your physical eyes, your visualization becomes three-dimensional .. more colorful, feelingful, sensitive, and light. Gradually, these impres-sions increase in intensity. Keep the visual image and this subtle feeling of awareness balanced. That is the very essence of visualization practice. Question: Could you tell me in your words the feelings you get by Nirvana? Rinpoche: Nirvana is very complicated, because Buddhism is very com-plicated and sophisticated, and it is not easy to make it into something simple. But the idea of Nirvana is the idea of full enlightenment, which means to be completely free from all bandages or any kind of problems on the physical, mental, or emotional levels. Interpretation of the term Nirvana is difficult because we always project our viewpoint. Whatever we say, it is subjective-it is the way we fed it. This is usually the way we philosophize. So according to that, Nirvana is complete freedom from Samsara, which means, free from all bondage. Question: What is your main goal in life? Rinpoche: My main goal, my really deepest main goal, is to help, to be of service to someone. I may not always be successful in my service to others, or I may not know the best way. But if I successfully reach that goal, then I will be of service to everyone."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 265 Question: What are your specific ambitions in the operations of the Nyingma Institute? Rinpoche: First I want to establish the Abhidharma, which is the basis of Buddhist psychology. As much as possible, I want to make Buddhist psychology available to the West. More teachers can offer more train-ing and help with translations, such as the small book we recently published, Mind in Buddhist Psychology. These activities can spread much knowledge about the Buddhist understanding of mind and consciousness. After that, I will emphasize Madhyamika, which is the meditative philosophy. Everyone has vague ideas about enlightenment, so I want to provide a better description of the state of enlightenment. Also, what is Shunyata? What is the Absolute? In this second stage I want to put more emphasis on these questions. The third stage is the Prajnaparamita. This describes more about what 'Buddha' really means, the significance of Buddha's enlightenment. The second one is partial. The third one, Prajnaparamita, is total, as Buddha really saw-what Reality is. Everything is part of Buddha activity, Buddha-nature. So I wish to explain these things using accurate terminology. Then even-tually there will be Vajrayana practices. I do not really want to convince the West how great Buddhism is. My aim is to present certain basic ideas of philosophy, while empha-sizing the practices, and then unify both the philosophy and the practice. I would hope that Buddhist understandings could be inte-grated into your own culture and traditions to give them more strength. For example, I know many priests and psychologists for whom Buddhism has increased understanding and interest in their own culture. The more you know about Buddhism, the more you go back to your own culture. It works better both ways. Question: My fr~end has what our society would call a beautiful life-a comfortable apartment and a well-paying job. The whole ec;onomy is turning downward, so one feels a tendency to hold on to such things. At the same time, there is an urge to pursue the spiritual life and give up this kind oflife, which at this time would seem to be a crazy thing to do. What about this? RJnpoche: It doesn't matter what you have-whether you're wealthy or whether you're poor-you need to appreciate it. Enjoy it. Be completely satisfied. Whatever you have, whether it be a small portion or a big pordon, you must learn to appreciate it. The human mind is very interesting. We think, \"This is my whole hindrance ... if I give this up then I will have no more prob-"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"266 Practice lem.\" Or, \"I can have a wonderful job.\" But when I reach that place, internally all the same activities are still going on. Without grasping or trying to attract attention, just use whatever you have. Enjoy whatever things you have and transform them into meditation. It's possible to expand emotional-physical sensations to the point where you go beyond them. Whatever you have, enjoy it to the fullest. Do not use it selfishly, and don't make guilt feelings, but just live within the meditation. Question: What sort of feelings do you have about sex and sexual morality? Rinpoche: I think the best sexual morality is complete relaxation. Question: Were there any great women spiritual masters in the Tibetan tradition? Rinpoche: Yes, quite a few. In Tibet, there are a number of historical women, such as Padmasambhava's consort, Ye-shey Tso-gyal, \\who concealed many secret, documented teachings in order to preserve them. This is called the Terma tradition-various teachings and trea-sures which are hidden all over the world. There are a number of other very prominent women teachers, or women reincarnations, such as Ma-chig-lag, who developed an important following. Question: In a book I was reading, there's a place in one of the prayers at the very end where you pray that you will be incarnated in the body of a male ... and it says that that is better. I don't know, that doesn't seem like .... the concept of better or worse ... Rinpoche: There is no better or worse. According to the Tantras, male and female are represented symbolically. The Adibuddha is called Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri, both male and female. The male often symbolizes form, all existence, and the female represents Shun-yata. Sometimes Prajna is represented as the female, and skillful means (upaya) as male. Physiologically, the female is more complicated than the male, and undergoes greater biological changes. This is perhaps reflected within consciousness, which means that positive and negative reactions may fluctuate more actively. If you have a comprehensive understand-ing of these energies, you may channel or balance them. Being a female, however, definitely does not limit the potential to become enlightened. Sometimes it seems that being a male is easier, if only because the"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 267 mother's role of taking care of others is time-consuming and socially involving. Buc that is not necessarily a drawback. For example, to the Boohisattvas, Shunyata is a mother principle, represented by the Pra-jnaparamita. According to Mahayana Buddhism, all the Buddhas are born from within this Buddha-mother. The Buddha, in order to be enlightened, arises from Prajna. The Theravada categorizes the female as liquid or water, which implies that emotions are flexible and difficult to control. It character-izes the male as earth, more grounded. In ancient times, Buddhist monks had certain rules. If a woman gave the monk an offering, he could not take it: from a male, he could. Why? Perhaps it was felt that monks would be attracted to the female, through desire and attach-ment. Externally it may seem like a prejudice, but certain rules were intended to protect sila, or morality. On the other hand, Mahayana texts and the more esoteric texts of the Vajrayana do not discriminate between male and female. Tara, for example, is one of the most important female Bodhisattvas. Sometimes Avalokiteshvara, the Com-passionate One, in certain traditions such as the Chinese, is represented in the female form. Also, certain Tantras are known as the Mother Tantras. Male and female each have their own character, and each is symbolically represented at the center of the Mandala. From ancient times many different countries or traditions, such as the Greeks, refer to mother principles and father principles. Buddhism, I think, is more the mother principle. Question: Isn't the desire to be more aware, to be more clear, a way of rejecting what is happening ... ? Rinpoche: Yes, for many beginners, that's true. For example, certain psychologists say, 'this is the way to do it' ... and perhaps the literal teachings say, 'that is the way to start'. BQ.t when you really go into the center of the thought, the thought itself becomes awareness. When you touch these subtle states of mind and then look back, you can see certain differences between this side and that side-you can see how and where your meditation has evolved. As we emerge from the ego's shell, we may have many emotions and problems, and then start to meditate and begin to see them clearly. That much is good. But also understand, the one who sees is still tied up with ego. As long as mental concepts belong to someone, ego develops much strength. We're actually talking on two levels. We say we should not have any grasping, attachment or desires. At the same time we say that we"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"268 Practice should not reject, deny or ignore our attachments-we find it difficult to escape them. Our talking is like one mouth with two tongues, yet without contradicting itself. For example, the Vijnanavadin say that everything •is'. Here is a huge mirror, and everything is reflected in the mirror, and we're seeing the images ... the seer and the seen are both in the same place, within awareness. Perhaps you receive the highest teachings, such as the Nyingma or Absolute Perfection teachings, and they say, you see something, and it seems seen, but the viewing and the object seen, are at the same time inseparable-the seer, the seeing and the seen: there is no difference. The object and the subject are instantly one ... they are not separate. At the very beginning of proper meditation practice, thought itself no longer exists. We can learn to go into the thought, and when the thought itself becomes meditation, it is no longer •thought'. There isn't anything left to hold on to. If I try to grab space, I cannot get anything, because there isn't anything that originally exists. But in the first state, I do grasp. First, there are thoughts and then meditation, and chen you shouldn't lose that thought ... but it's so subtle ... you have to learn. Mind experience is much subtler than any knowledge, because there are no concepts, no thoughts. Once you know this subtle inner path, then meditation becomes much easier, then you understand what we're talking about, what we're trying to understand, what becomes meditation, what the real teaching means. Then the teachings come alive. Whenever we want to grasp something somewhere else we cannot really be fulfilled here and now. So in this way, just sit and become your meditation ... be whoever you are in this present mo-ment ... wi~houc trying, without coo much expecting, but with feel-ing. Then everything just naturally falls into place. In this way we deal with thoughts gently. Thought is actually like a wild elephant. If we deal with thought roughly, it becomes more uncontrollable. But if we deal with our thoughts gently, they become our friends and bring many pleasant feelings. That enjoyable feel-ing-without guilt and without attach~ent-can be our meditation."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 269 Encourage Yourself The Vajrayana or Diamond Path opens up a hidden treasury of self-knowledge within us. It turns every aspect of every situation into a process of training, learning and understanding. The Vajrayana is especially effective because it does not depend on any one technique alone, but includes a rich variety of approaches, methods and exercises. There is not just one way to gain Enlightenment, because the aliveness of the teachings or the meditation practice is not separate from all objectives and all energies-everything works together simultaneously as part of a whole and perfect Mandala. Most of the time however, we deal with situations mentally. Even if we live for a hundred years, we can never exhaust thinking, talking, projecting or imagining things. The mind endlessly reinforces memories, discriminations and countless dualities which govern the responses of our body. When there is too much mental pressure-thinking, studying and inner agitation-we may even experience severe pain, headache and tension. Finally the mind becomes totally exhausted and the rest of the body collapses. While our mind is the source of thoughts, our nervous system embodies our feelings. When our feelings are restricted, our muscles become tight and our heart becomes closed. Once the heart is closed, and once the more subtle life energies are blocked, our feelings become weak and imbalanced. Sometimes we feel this way or that way, but most of the time our mind has alr~dy formed a concept, such as 'this is positive' or 'this is negative', 'this is wrong' or 'this is right', 'this feels good' or 'this does not feel good'. Once thoughts take the initiative to determine our actions, then our feelings and emotions just follow along. Even if our inner feelings, conflict with our thoughts, they cannot fully influence the outcome, because they do not have that much power. So often, our inner voice-our intuitive awareness or positive attitude-is completely subdued and controlled. This process goes on continuously. As soon as an image arises, the mind instantly discriminates, but the emotions are much slower,"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"270 Practice thicker and heavier. By the time an interpretation, judgment or de-cision has been made, the emotions are just beginning to stir. Similarly; some of the stars which are now dead emitted their light a long time ago, but we can still see them. The same with emotions. The emotion is often felt most strongly later on, after the ex~rience has already been processed by the mind. Since the emotions take no specific form or shape, we become confused and cannot express exactly how we 'feel', because the image, the original experience, is already gone. The emo-tions are like water. In one way, water)s very soft and flexible, and in another it is very powerful. It can flood valleys and destroy everything, or slowly wear mountains away. Similarly, emotions use up tremendous energy. When they disagree with our thoughts, concepts and images, they can create dissatisfaction, inner arguments and conflicts, and pro-duce unpredictable physical imbalances. If the emotions and intellect support each other, then life seems meaningful, balanced and healthy. All of this occurs within the thought itself, for the mind is filled with a constant stream of thoughts, day and night, never resting. Perhaps one thought is slow, another fast, and sometimes there may be gaps between the thoughts. Sometimes a single thought develops gradually and then splits into two separate interpretations. One thought may be, 'This is beautiful!', but in the next moment our interpretation may reverse. One thought creates and multiplies other t_houghts endlessly. From within, thoughts seem to be progressing, to be going somewhere, to be reaching or creating something. You imagine you are resolving a problem or 'dealing with' your feelings. ~ut one thought produces another thought, which produces another thought, and on and on. You can see different forms, have different ideas and feelings-each superimposed on the original thought. All of these mental events work together in a very complex way. Our positive attitudes always seem to depend upon the relative strength or weakness of our negative attitudes. If negative influences are very active, the positive side becomes very depressed. There is no light, no awareness, no power or energy. Nothing is interesting. Our feelings are totally withdrawn, completely collapsed. The more positive energy we lose, depression becomes darker and darker, until there are no perceptions and no images, just a sort of numbness. Feelings of deep negativity or d~pression can arise after a death or be caused by a physical condition, by disease, or by too much mental worry and anxiety. Negativity is also self-creating: we may suddenly become withdrawn and wonder why this is happening. Simply, humans"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"have a certain quantity of energy, and each time the mind uses energy to produce a thought, the energy freezes rather than flows. The more thoughts, concepts, ideas and images you have, the less energy is available. So the head and muscles become tighter and tighter, the body cannot relax or get relief, and finally it shuts down. Once everything is tight, depression increases. Because we hold certain negative images in our consciousness, the nervous system responds and reacts according co the intensity of these images. If an image becomes fixed and never changes-for example, a specific memory-we always maintain the same feeling and response to that initial experience, so that finally we have no flexibility. The longer we maintain a certain image pattern, the more difficult it becomes to change its effect upon our personality. From childhood, certain feelings are locked in our hearts, and we repeat the same habit patterns for so many years that they dominate our life style. Everything in our life operates according to these patterns, whether for good or bad, and eventually they become very difficult to change. If we can physically relax, the tension and feelings within our heart can loosen. One method to become calm, positive and balanced is not to be concerned with the future and not to dwell in the past, but to extend the present moment. When we meditate, we can concentrate on sound or on taste and can expand our awareness. We can meditate on thoughts or within emotions or on different external forms. We can"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"272 Practice use any situation, wherever we are. At that time, just be in that present situation-not in the past or future. Otherwise you may tightly hold on co some idea of how meditation should be, how your life should be. You may say, \"Now I should not think.\" But as soon as you create this thought, another thought comes. Or you say, \"I should not try to do anything.\" But you become restless. The same thing happens when you interpret your experience intellectually or when you 'pretend' to be meditating-you may only be feeding the self-image. This pretending and delaying may never end. If you are not aware of what you are doing, you may just waste a lot of valuable time and energy. Here and now, this is your life. Whether you accept it or not, that is up to you. But once it's gone, you can never, never again get it back. That is it. Finished. Yesterday was. Whatever opportunities you have, whatever you own in life-body, mind, energy, awareness-whoever you are at present, whatever you are collecting, you have to use it right now. In the next minute it is lost. You are already another person. The deception is that we 'feel' as though we were the same person. You may say, \"I am 25 years old. I still have 40 or SO years to live.\" But actually, you cannot predict the future and you cannot recapture the past. Even though you have recollections and me~ories, they are only images superimposed onto your present experience. So whether your life is meaningful or not depends on how much you value your present situation. Otherwise all you will have left are your excuses, explanations, reasons, words and weakness-but nothing else. As long .as you create intellectual expla-nations to pretend or to cover up, you are just deceiving yourself and playing games. Ultimately, you have to confront yourself directly and honestly work out-physically and mentally-what you want for your-self. If you want to meditate, for example, you have to do it at this very moment and not 'prepare' for the future. The same is true for changing your negative life patterns. The only way is to do it. We may think, \"I don't want my body to be so tight, but I don't want to work on myself any harder.\" Why? \"Because I'm afraid. Because I don't like to feel pain. I'm afraid of pain and suffering. I'm afraid of confronting something.\" But watch yourself-how long have you been afraid? As long as that fear continues, you can't do anything. Physically and mentally you collapse. Fear only creates more fear, so you tightly hold yourself back until you have no warmth. You need to confront these things in yourself. Ultimately you cannot escape or hide. The weaker you become, the less you will want to confront anything."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 273 Whether you are working or studying or meditating, do it openly, directly, and without excuses. Let's say you are sitting in meditation. You may say, \"There is 'nothing'. I hav~ no explanations. I am fully participating.\" No. You are playing games-whether this way is meditation or that way is awareness, or, \"This is maybe something I'm seeing,\" or, \"I'm getting something, achieving something.\" These inner dialogues of proving this or that just waste long periods of time, without any real openness or strength. On this samsaric level, it makes a big difference whether or not you orient yourself to be healthy-minded. Even though it may be painful to look at yourself, ultimately it will be easier. Whatever difficulty you have, try to confront it directly. Even though you may not like to concentrate for a long period of time, meditate regularly for a short while each day. Then informally, extend your meditation into every moment-into your anger,,pain, desire or grasping. Whenever a difficult mental situation arises, stay within it, listen, sort of chew it and taste it within meditation. Each situation can become more healthy and refined. But if you are afraid before you even begin, you will just delay this entire process. Therefore, it is very important to take the first step. Even though you cannot immediately transmute or transcend the difficulty, just confront it directly rather than holding back or trying to escape. That specific moment of confrontation may not be pleasant or very easy, but once you begin to watch your mental and emotional processes and break down the initial obstacles, you may find your whole life-atmosphere becoming smoother and lighter. The di·fference in your attitude will be like night and day. Each day you can grow, learn something, understand something, and benefit both yourself and others. It's very important to try to change your personality early in life. Mter 40 or SO, it becomes more difficult. So, as much as you can, try to meditate, to practice relaxation exercises, and to concentrate on breathing and visualization. These methods help you to break mental concepts and fixations, especially the concept that you don't really want to be involved. When laziness, weakness, excuses or rationalization are constantly repeated within the mind, they generate a kind of callous-ness or frigidity, and a feeling of avoiding something 'terrible'. It is not terrible. Even fear can be used to awaken, recognize, change and relieve the tension. But you must do something yourself and not expect someone else to do it for you. How much are you learning from this experience? How much can others help you? It's absolutely important"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"274 Practice to risk taking responsibility for yourself. You need to grow and develop for your own sake, so you must deal directly with yourself. We definitely have karma, so we must definitely pass through these things. Someone knowledgeable, who has suffering or pain or depre.ssion, does not run away. Where can he go? There is no place we can go·to escape. The ultimate answer is that we must take responsi-bility right away. Even though the first time is the most difficult, try to make the present situation healthier, and then future conditions will steadily improve. I'm sure that even Lord Buddha-if we interpret his six years of ascetic practice from a human point of view.-did not find it easy. Everyone has to go through cenain difficulties, obstacles and problems. There is no such thing as a person being completely free from karma. There are no exceptions. Everyone has to panicipate in this functioning ofkarma. We cannot avoid it. The practice is hard and life is not easy, so sometimes we may imagine that there is another place where there are no problems. But still, the ultimate solution is that we must face our problems directly, in every given moment. Why do we have problems? Because we believe there is a 'no-problem place'. We have that kind of a concept. Therefore, the contrast between who we are and who we would like to be, we call 'problem'. If we don't imagine there is a 'no-problem place', if we do not have that kind of fixed idea, we may never suffer. But we believe that somewhere something is wonderful, something is beautiful, something ideal and stimulating. What is non-existing is created through artificial images and yearning. \"Oh, I saw it-it was beautiful, happy, wonderful!\" These are only emotional sentiments, lasting for just a short time. Afterwards the feeling or the ideal completely changes. This happens not only in one individual or in one society, but in all societies and all mankind. These projections of 'wonderful things' are secretly permeating our thought patterns and feelings-we believe in them, always yearning, always looking somewhere else ... for some other relationship, some other job, some other place. You cannot find that 'place' anywhere, unless you examine and work on yourself, and find it within. It is also useful to be physically active, so that your cells are energized to live a longer life. If you sleep and stay in one place for a long time, you become weaker and weaker, and life becomes physically stagnant. But if we as human beings strongly believe that we are more advanced than any other form of life on this earth, then we have to discover the real potential, meaning and value for our lives. You can question what you have done in i:he past and what you can do in the"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 275 future. Look, project, plan, think about, and understand how your life will be-how it will look when you are sixty years old, what kind of person you will be. For some, perhaps, life will remain the same as now, but for others, life steadily becomes more interesting. This process of self-growth and health is just like walking. Even though you do not walk very fast, you grow stronger the longer you walk. But it is important to move slowly and genuinely. Gradually your goal seems closer-closer to your life, closer to your work. The more carefully you work to open your feelings, the more you feel alive, balanced and healthy. Your progress will give you strength and confidence, so that whatever happens you won't change your goal, your interest or your wisdom for anyone. You need to be just that kind of dynamic, clear-minded person. You must have confidence in yourself-you need to stimulate your positive attitudes. If you listen to negativity once, twice, three times, it repeats itself endlessly so that you become weak and cannot protect yourself. You seem to be faced by disturbances and conflicts-dangerous animals in all directions. How do you protect yourself? Once you can understand the freedom and health within your own experience, then life becomes very interesting, never boring or dull-life is never wasted. You learn to enjoy everything ... every mouthful of food. It is very important to concentrate on what these things mean. Don't feel like, \"Oh, I can never do those things. I'm not that kind of person. I can't do it.\" This is just fooling, cheating yourself. This is worse than when others cheat you. Others can cheat you several times, but you can cheat yourself a whole lifetime! You only fool yourself when you make excuses and explanations, and are envious, guilty or afraid. You can go on and on like this with no progress. So make up your mind to achieve what you want your life to be, what is important action for you to do. Once you have that goal, try to continue and don't give up. Once you fail, who can help you again the next time? No one will tell you. No one will encourage you unless you yourself are determined. Who else really cares? Therefore, encourage yourself-not because you believe in Bud-dhism or meditation, but because it is so important to take responsibil-ity for your own life: prepare yourself in these essential understandings so that no matter what situation or condition you become involved in, you may easily pass through it. You will have to promise yourself, make a commitment to yourself, be determined, and accept yourself.

It is not too late now to take responsibility for cleaning up negative karma. If you have enough vigor, if you have strength and courage, and if you develop awareness and a positive attitude, you can do it. Otherwise, you will always be casual and numb, always the same-eating the same food, living in the same place, following the same pattern, never changing, never finding anything interesting, always working on the same prob-lems or job. life will continue to be very uninteresting, frustrating and dull, and you will never genuinely enjoy anything. This does not mean that you have to perform great deeds, but that you should just make whatever you are doing meaningful to you and valuable to your growth. Even the simple things you do, like cooking or serving, can be done by living according-co the six perfections. Once there was a small monk called Phags-pa-sgur-chung-pa, who didn't know anything. So his teacher said, \"You do the cleaning in the temple.\" So he spent his whole lifetime cleaning, cleaning, clean-ing. One day he said, \"rDul-spang-sa-ngo, dri-ma-spang-sa-ngo,\" which means 'the dust will go and the smell will go'. \"Dust goes, smell goes.\" And he repeated this constantly as he cleaned the temple. Finally, he thought, \"What does 'dust' really mean?\" And he understood within that the real dust was his own kleshas or obscurations. So he concen-trated on these words more and more until he realized the pattern and became an Arhat, which means that even if a person spends a lifetime working at a simple, lowly job, such as dusting or cleaning-if he has that understanding-his life can be something meaningful. Therefore, it is not the type of work that is important, but h()U) to work-the motivation, the concentration, the mindfulness with which the work is done. If you are not in tune with what you are doing inside, there may be no meaning or value. Maybe you don't like what you are doing now, or you are frustrated, or you do not understand its value and you do not care, or you are uninterested and just passing the time, or you are just playing games for ego purposes.

Everywhere, it seems, there is worry and concern, planning for the uncertain future. Working in the factories is difficult, living with parents is difficult, and living alone is lonely. Whatever and wherever it is, there always seem to be many problems. Now you have a unique opportunity. You can read books, you can learn meditation, and many positive opportunities are open to you-so you should not waste time. If you cannot meditate for a long time each day, then do it informally. I'm sure there are a couple of minutes you can find to sit quietly, to practice, to work on yourself, and to grow in meditation. It is important for you to take care of yourself and to understand and appreciate what a balanced life means-not just for one day, but moment to moment, in each situation."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"278 Practice Compassion and Self-healing We have been talking about warm feelings ... making yourself comfortable, quiet, pea-ceful. You can share these feelings with all beings who have mental or physical pain, with whoever is in samsadc bondage. Feel you are giving to them, helping them, making them happy. This feeling is a kind of gift, first to yourself in the form of complete self-acceptance, and then to your parents, your countrymen, and to all beings in this world. Deeply and genuinely feel this com-passion, especially for those who are ignorant, dissatisfied or deluded. Offer this love and openness unreservedly and without prejudice to all beings in every realm of existence. The more you open your heart with positive feelings, the more you will begin to understand the Buddha's unlimited compassion. Soon we hope to have a country center in the mountains or some quiet place where we can meditate for longer periods of time and further develop both formal and informal meditation practices .. But then, Bodhisattvas also work in cities. Wherever there is suffering, wherever there are people, you can work, share, and help each other. We have a short time together in this century and in this life. Since you supposedly know something about the Dharma and how to develop your own health, it becomes your responsibility to help others. If someone is suffering or not aware, or does not have this knowledge, he cannot help because he does not understand. But whoever has some knowledge or compassion can share this with others. Even if you can't help completely, at least think about your own sufferings: just as you have problems, so do others. Others have the same human situation, the same problems, and you can exchange your own solutions with others. Also, you cannot improve the world if you make enemies with anyone ..... with parents, friends or government. Try to accept ignorance-even if others do wrong or continually make mistakes. They may not even realize their own lack of understanding or the source of their problems. In this world there are very few without suffering, so always remember to be compassionate."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Opening to the Dharma 279 One of the best ways to learn and one of the best teachings, I think, is suffering. Suffering is the best teacher. I'm not encouraging you to create more suffering ... I'm sure you already have enough! So just use whatever suffering is already present. The real suffering, the pain that we feel-physically, emotionally, intellectually, psychologi-cally-this is our raw material. Escaping suffering is only temporary. Sooner or later 'we have to face our own dissatisfaction. Then our understanding becomes more than just a passing idea or some elaborate philosophy. The teachings say many things: this is best, this is not best ... but you can't believe any of these things until you watch and see exactly and precisely just what you are experiencing ... how your life is really going. If you thoroughly understand your own suffering; you can lead yourself out of many uncomfortable situations through your own clarity and awareness. Once you understand, once you have gone through this very basic experience, then it is easier to change your life. Then compassion for yourself and others becomes really possible. Once you have accurate meditation instruction, once you under-stand all the problems, doubts, and fixations, then you need to medi-tate. Meditation is something you do for yourself-for your own balance and health. All I can do is direct, point, and give advice-this is an assumption, or this seems better. I can give suggestions, but the inner quality you need to investigate for yourself ... and then meditate every day. Each time, try to increase or prolong your meditation. Begin by becoming completely silent, beyond thoughts and distractions .. even if you can only get away for thirty minutes each morning and evening. Then be completely silent and physically relax ... breathe openly and slowly and don't pay attention to externals. Motivation is also very important. As you meditate more, moti-vation becomes voluntary, but you can easily become sort of numb or dull, and even though you are sitting there you can become very bored. This is more reason to meditate very loosely, but at the same time very energetically. When you were younger, say lS or 18, you may have had many questions ... what is the meaning of life? who am I? ... and at that time you might have experienced a certain anxiety to find the answers. Later on, you may have become more involved with work and personal relationships, you may have had many experiences, and then the questions return: what are you doing here? for what purpose are you doing these things? Meanwhile, you may have forgotten your original questions. Perhaps you have been involved in business or you"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"280 Practice have attempted to enjoy the many things life offers, or you have had much suffering ... your relationship fell apart, there's no future in your job, and everything seems lifeless and hopeless. Then ask yourself these questions again, because ultimately whatever you do in this life de-pends on you. Your best protector and your best friend is you yourself, your own meditation, your own inner health and growth, your own spiritual path. So now the question comes, what is Buddhist philosophy, what is Buddhist teaching? What does meditation mean? Buddha's teaching is a way of living, a life style ... how to deal with everyday situations and how to live and work in a practical and positive way. Even though you may not necessarily become enlightened in one day, Buddha's teaching is not for later_ hut for right now. Now be comfortable, now be positive, now fully enjoy whatever you are doing. Otherwise our life just goes up and down, and meanwhile we remain confused, engulfed in chaos and endless struggling. The teaching itself is a way of life, a pattern for living on a practical level without going to extremes. The Buddha-dharma challenges us to change our patterns of suffering so we can find just what we need every moment. It seems that meditation is the most effective method to over-come all suffering, agitation, anxiety, worry and inner turmoil. If the mind becomes quieter and less confused by daily situations, then this in itself is something very significant, and you will most likely experience many more positive changes as the weeks, months, and years follow. One of the early teachers in Tibet said that all knowledge is like the stars at night-there are so many that you cannot count them. So it is better for you to count only the important ones-what is your life, what is the healthiest way to live-and then begin developing your insights gradually, day by day. Right now, you may have many insights or ideals that you are not ready to accomplish, but if you progress gradually, step by step, little by little, your motivation will increase. Once you gain this inner confidence and certainty, it will become as indestructible as a diamond, and no one will ever be able to take it away from you. Within your own experience, you will begin to see that first you provide the effort-the effort to investigate, the effort to become more aware, the effort to meditate. Then you will soon find that investigation brings clarity, awareness brings satisfaction, and meditation just nat-urally comes ... like the morning sun. Once you begin with full and complete dedication, everything begins to fall into place. Even dis-"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"282 Practice couragements lose their power to upset you. When you feed yourself this way, you no longer need to depend on anyone. You yourself become your own teacher. I can point out certain things, or push you to examine yourself or point out where the danger lies. Even the Buddha himself said that he can only show you the map, but you yourself need to take the initiative. You should not think that there is an easy or magic way. If it does exist, then you will have to find it on your own. All of Buddha's teaching comes to the conclusion that you are essential, you are responsible. You cannot expect som·eone else to reach enlightenment for you. You cannot delegate that final authority or expect that you will reach enlightenment overnight. The Buddha-dharma teaches you to begin on the basic level of your experience. Wherever you are, whatever situation you are in, this is the appropriate time to begin to make your life more simple, smooth, balanced-not too many extremes ... not too happy and never sad. If you are stim-ulated for great changes, they may occur, but the most steady work is the best. If you practice properly, if you truly become aware, if you follow the basic teachings wholeheartedly, then you need not worry about the results or your progress. There are many things to teach. Buddhism abounds in methods and techniques and advanced philosophical and psychological practices. But these come naturally in the later stages. First of all we must learn to take care of ourselves in the best possible way in every situation ... a healthy body and a healthy mind. What is a healthy mind? No confusions, no disappointment~, no disillusionments. What is a healthy body? Balance, not emotionally stuck, sick, or painful. These are basic. Everything the Buddha taught has its foundation in knowing how to take care of yourself properly. It means that you can teach yourself, you can heal yourself, you can guide yourself. With this confidence, you can become totally independent, self-sufficient and find lasting satisfaction. So right now, at this time, we already have a great opportunity. Use whatever you have. And if you don't have what you need or want, don't worry and don't be too anxious to have more. Just try to appreciate whatever you have-your body, your mind, your material things, your sensations, your feelings, your knowledge ... whatever you are doing. Be kind to yourself. Take the time to reevaluate what a fortunate opportunity you have and look at the tremendous pain and suffering and confusion of others.

In other words, whatever hap-pens, up or down, use your experience to learn, to become more aware. Once everything becomes meditation, you can find this balance, this peace and this contentment.
