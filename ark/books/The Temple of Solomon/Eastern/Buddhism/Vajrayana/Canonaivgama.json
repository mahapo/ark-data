This vast areaof study, so badly neglected in the past, is now slowly beginning to come intoits own. The new interest, accompanied by a greater (although still verylimited) knowledge of the Tantras, has led to a more critical and scholarlyapproach to the study of these sacred texts. Although scholars in the past wereaware that important internal distinctions exist in the Tantric tradition*, 1they were largely glossed over in an attempt to penetrate the 'philosophy of theTantras', 2 or the 'principles of TantraV Important exceptions on the Saiva side(we are not concerned here with Vaisnava Tantra) have been the studies andcritical editions made in recent years of the Siddhantagamas. This importantwork must be largely credited to the French Institute of Indology at Pondicherryand in particular to*Pt. N. R. Bhatt and Dr, Htlbm Brunner-Lachaux, who hascontributed to it immensely by her extensive work on Siddhanta ritual 4 Anotherarea of research has been the Srlvidya tradition. Many of the major Tantras andallied works of this school have been edited and independent studies published.However, apart from these two major fields, hardly any other work has been doneon individual Tantric traditions. The aim of this monograph is to pursue thisline of approach further by presenting a preliminary study of another HinduTantric tradition, namely, the cult of Kubjika, the details of which arerecorded in the Tantras of the Western School: the Pascimamnaya.The Pascimamnaya belongs to a category of Saivagama variously called 'Kulagama','KulaMstra' or 'Kulamnaya', which we shall attempt to delineate in the secondpart of this monograph. Although not as extensive as the Siddhanta or as wellknown and diffused as the Srlvidya, the Pafaimamnaya is an important andsubstantial Tantric tradition. Up to now very little work has been done on thePascimamnaya (see appendix A). Hardly any texts of this school have been edited,although about ahundred independent works, some of considerable length, are preserved inmanuscripts, almost all of which are in Nepal (see appendix D). At thispreliminary stage of research we would do well, first of all, to locate thissacred literature in the vast corpus of the Saivagama. Such is the aim of thismonograph. Thus, although we shall deal with the Tantras and cult of Kubjika, weare here primarily concerned only with the contents of these Tantras that canhelp us to locate them in the Saiva canon and construct their history. We areacutely aware that we are considerably handicapped in this task not only by ourlimited knowledge of the Pascimamnaya but also by our scant understanding of thestructure of the Saiva canon. Even so we feel that, however provisional it mayturn out to be, at least an attempt should be made to plot, even if in the mostgeneral terms, the extent and divisions of the Saivagama. Forced as we are atpresent to work largely with sources in manuscript (many of which are corrupt),and given the vast amount of material that has yet to be studied and the evengreater amount that has been lost, our endeavor is audacious, perhaps foolhardy.Even so, we shall be amply rewarded if this work leads to new insights intopossible future avenues of research not only in the Kubjika Tantras but, moregenerally, into the Saiva canon.The SaivagamasThe earliest known references to sectarian Saivism are found in Patanjali'sGreat Commentary (Mahabhasya) on Panini's grammar probably written in the secondcentury B.C.. Patanjali refers to the Sivabhagavats which he describes asitinerent ascetics who wore animal skins and carried an iron lance.* The Saivasymbols found on the coins of the Greek, Saka and Parthian kings, who ruled inNorthern India between the second century B.C. and the first century A.D.,confirm that Siva was already well established during this period as a sectariangod. 6 Unfortunately, however, no sacred texts of any pre-Agamic Saiva sect havebeen preserved. Possibly none were written during this early period. It is notunlikely that when Saivism developed into a popular movement it relied at firston the Vedas and related literature along with the developing Epic and Puranictraditions as sounding boards for their sectarian views. We might alsojustifiably speculate that there must have existed numerous oral traditions thatultimately contributed to the development of a corpus of sacred Saivaliterature—the Saivagamas—that considered itself to be 1 independent of theauthority of the Vedas and had nothing to do with the Epics or Puranas.The SaivagamasAlthough it is not possible to say exactly when the first Agamas were written,there is no concrete evidence to suggest that any existed much before the sixthcentury. The earliest reference to Tantric manuscripts cannot be dated beforethe first half of the seventh century. It occurs in Bana*s Sanskrit novel,Kadambarim which the author describes a Saiva ascetic from South India who \"hadmade a collection of manuscripts of jugglery, Tantras and Mantras [which werewritten] in letters of red lac on palm leaves [tinged with] smoke.\" Bana alsosays that u he had written down the doctrine of Mahakaia, which is the ancientteaching of the Mahapasupatas,\" 7 thus confirming that oral traditions were infact being committed to writing.If our dates are correct, it seems that the Saivagamas proliferated to anastonishing degree at an extremely rapid rate so that by the time we reachAbhinavagupta and his immediate predecessors who lived in ninth-century Kashmirwe discover in their works references drawn from a vast corpus of Saivagamicliterature. It is this corpus which constituted the source and substance of theSaivism of Kashmir, which Kashrniri^mtes, both monists and dualists, commentedon, systematized and extended in their writings and oral transmissions. Thedualist Siddhantins, supported by the authority of the Siddhantagamas, initiatedthis process by developing the philosophical theology of the Siddhanta.Subsequently, from about the middle of the ninth century, parallel developmentstook place in m<m[stic_ Saiyism which drew inspiration largely, but not 1exclusively, from the Bhairava and other Agamic groups which constituted theremaining part of the Saiva corpus.It was to this part of the Saivagama that the sacred texts of the Pascimamnayabelonged. These Tantras, unlike those of the Siddhanta, advocated in placesextreme forms of Tantricism that actively enjoined such practices as theconsumption of meat and wine as well as sex in the course of their rituals.Agamic Saivites who accepted these practices as valid forms of worshipconstituted a notable feature of religious life throughout India. Although manyof these Saivites were householders, the mainstays of these traditions werelargely single ascetics, many of whom travelled widely and in so doing spreadtheir cults from one part of India to another.An interesting example of this phenomenon is Trika, nowadays virtuallyidentified with monistic Kashmiri Saivism. Abhinavagupta, who was largelyresponsible for developing Trika Saivism into the elevated, sophisticated formin which we find it in his works, was initiated into Trika by Sambhunatha, whocame to Kashmir from neighbouring Jalandhara. Sumati, his teacher and anitinerent ascetic like himself, was said to have travelled to the North of Indiafrom some \"sacred place in the South.'* 8i C-.^The Saiva AgamasThe Jain Somadeva confirms that Trika was known in South India during/ the tenth century. Somadeva identifies the followers of the Trikamata as) Kaulas who worship Siva in the company of their Tantric consorts byoffering him meat and wine.* It is worth noting incidently that Somadeva' was very critical of the Trika Kaulas, \"If liberation,\" he says, \"were theresult of a loose, undisciplined life, then thugs and butchers would surelysooner attain to it than these Kaulas!\"* Although Somadeva was a Jamamonk and so would naturally disapprove of such practices and tend to takeextreme views, it appears nonetheless that Trika was not always as elevatedas it now seems to us to be.Although the Pascimamnaya is entirely confined to Nepal at present, it was,according to one of its most important Tantras, the Kubjikamata, spread by thegoddess to every corner of India, right up to Kanyakuman in the South,identified, by allusion, with Kubjika the goddess of the Pascimamnaya. '» A longlist of initiates into the Pascimamnaya and their places of residence isrecorded in the Kubjikanityahnikatilaka, a work written before the twelfthcentury. It is clear from this list that the cult had spread throughout Indiaalthough it was certainly more popular in the North i2 That the Pakimamnaya wasknown in South India in the thirteenth century is proved by references inMahesvarananda's Maharthamanjari* to the Kubjikamata^ as well as a work called\"pascimam \"* which may or may not be the same work but most probably belongs tothe same tradition. An old, incomplete manuscript of the Kubjikamata is stillpreserved in the manuscript library of the University of Kerala in Trivandrum J6 . . ,Despite relatively early references to the existence of Agamic Saivism in theSouth, it seems that the Saivagamas originally flourished in northern Indiaspreading to the South only later. Madhyadesa (an area covering eastern UtterPradesh and west Bihar) was, according to Abhinavagupta, considered to be the\"repository of all scripture\"\"-hence also of the Saivagama and the KuiasastraJ 8The importance of this part of India is indirectly confirmed by the fact thatBenares, in the centre of this area, is to be visualized as a sacred place(pifha) located in the heart of the body in the course of the Kaula ritualdescribed in Taniraloka™ Similarly Prayaga and Varanasi are projected in thesame way onto the centre of the body during the ritual described in theYoginihrdaya^ a Kaula Tantra of the original Saivagama. The sacred circle(mantfala) shown to the neophyte tn the course of his initiation into the cultof the Brahmayamala is to be drawn in a cremation ground with the ashes of acremated human corpse. In it are worshipped Yaksas, Pisacas and other demonicbeings, including Raksasas M led by Ravana, who surround Bhairava to whom wineis offered with ' oblations of beef and human flesh prepared in a funeral pyre.The name ofThe Saivagamasthis circle is the \"Great Cremation Ground\" {mahasmasana) and is to be drawn inVaranasi. 2l Siddhesvari is a quarter of Benares named after a goddessworshipped there; she was originally called Siddhayoge£vari, 22 an importantgoddess of the Trika.Although the Pascimamnaya was not popular in Kashmir, 23 we must first examinethe monistic Kashmiri sources to understand something of the development of theSaivagama and the relationship between the different groups which constitutedit, including the Kaula group to which the Pascimamnaya belongs. This is becauseAbhinavagupta's Trika encompassed the entire spectrum of Saiva Agamic cultsranging from these of the Saivasiddhanta and the Siddhanta-type ritual of theSvacchanda cult 24 popular in Kashmir, right through to those of theBhairavaiantras and Kutagamas to Trika. There are references to more than fivehundred lost works within this range. Many of these Tantras and related worksmust still have existed in the thirteenth century when Jayaratha commented onthe Tantraloka and quoted extensively from these sources. From the manner inwhich he talks about these Tantras it appears that some at least of the ritualsthey described continued to be performed in his time. 25 However, outside theHimalayan region matters were different. Thus, although the Siddhanta flourishedin the South, we can infer from the numerous references in Mahesvarananda'sMaharihamanjarl, written about this time, that a good number of the primaryTantras familiar to Abhinavagupta were not known in the South. However, thesecondary works associated with them (many still scripture in their own right)as well as Kashmiri works of known authors and texts belonging to the Kramanayahad been carefully preserved and even added to.A great deal of this literature has been lost. There is no denying the fact thata relatively sudden interruption of the traditions associated with these textshas taken place: a break has occurred in the development of the Tantras. Withintwo or three centuries not only had the bulk of the Bhairavaiantras and similarTantric works been lost, but even Abhinavagupta and the monist Kashmiri authorsseem, except in a few isolated cases, to have disappeared. It was only in thebeginning of this century that the works of these authors started to be rescuedfrom oblivion when their works began to be edited by Kashmiri scholars employedin a government research centre at Srinagar which published them as the KashmirSeries of Texts and Studies. The study of these texts made scholars aware of theloss of a large and rich corpus of Tantric literature. Indeed, this loss hasbeen so great that all the developments in monistic Tantra after Abhinavagupta,with the important exception of the cult of Srividya, were fresh beginningswhich had little direct connection with the older corpus, so much so that theyounger scriptures are no longer called \"Saivagamas** but \"Tantras.\"The Saiva AgamasThus the term \"Tantra,\" which has anyway a wide range of connotations, 26 isused at times to denote a Sakta Tantric scripture to distinguish it from a SaivaAgama, whereas we find both words used in the early corpus withoutdistinction. 17The reason for this loss has certainly much to do with the ethos of Hinduismitself and its history as a whole. The secrecy that these types of Tantras havealways imposed on themselves is indicative of the uneasiness which these Tantriccultural elements must have aroused in many. 2 * Thus the Puranas, which arefrom many points of view the bastions and guardians of Hindu orthodoxy,initially tended to reject the authority of the Tantras and so largely avoidedquoting from them. However, insofar as the Puranas aimed to be completecompendiums of Hindu spirituality and practice, they later included longsections from Tantric sources, especially when dealing with ritual, the buildingand consecration of temples, yoga and related matters. 2 * Thus there is muchTantric material to be found everywhere in the Puraoas. TheBrahmavaivartapurarta contains a brilliant theological exposition of the Supremeas the Goddess Nature {Prakrii), which is a theme dear to Tantra in its laterphases. The Devi Devibhagavata, the Kalika and large portions of the NaradaPuraoas are extensively Tantric. The hymns eulogizing the names of the goddess,accounts of her actions, lists of female attendants of male gods, their Mantras,Yantras and much more show how strong the influence of Tantric ideas was on thePuranas. They also demonstrate that such trends were not only clearly apparentin the history of the development of Tantra but applied to them also. Thesedevelopments, in other words, concerned the whole of the literate tradition, andso the Puranas could, without difficulty or self-contradiction, incorporaterelevant material fromthe Tantras.These incorporations were drawn from the entire range of Tantric sourcesavailable at the time in which they were made. It seems likely, in fact, that apossible way in which we can gain some idea of when these Tantric passages wereadded to the Puranic text is to establish the type of Tantric source from whichthey were drawn. No one has yet attempted to apply this method in an extensiveor systematic way. However, the validity of this approach finds the support ofR. C. Hazra, who in his work does attempt to date some Puraoic passages on thisbasis.** The Agni and Garuga Puraoas, for example, deal extensively with Tantrictopics. Their treatment is based largely on the Saivagamas andPancaratrasamhitas which belong to the early Tantric period, i.e., prior to thetenth century. As an example relevant to the study of the Pascimamnaya, we maycite chapters 143-147 of the Agnipurana where the goddess Kubjika is extolledand the manner in which she is to be worshipped is described.^ ■ As KubjikaThe Saivagamasis not worshipped in the way described in the Agnipurana in later Tantricsources, we can conclude that this addition must be relatively early.The changes in the Tantric mate rial found in the Puranas also serve tounderscore the fact that many of the early Tantras were lost and their cultssuperseded by others. Undoubtedly, this is partly due to the effects of thepassage of time with its changing fads and interests. Manuscripts in India havea relatively short lifespan; if they are not copied, the texts they transmitsoon become obsolete. Through the centuries much has been lost in this way fromall the Indian Nostras. In the case of the Tantras, particularly the esotericones such as those belonging to the Bhairava and Kaula groups, this naturalprocess was reinforced by the custom of disposing of the Tantric text once theteacher had explained its meaning to his disciple. 32 Moreover, the regionalcharacter of many of these Tantric cults entailed the scarcity of copies oftheir Tantras. Not infrequently, therefore, the speaker of a Tantra prefaces hisinstruction with an exhortation to hear the Tantra which is \"very hard toacquire {sudurlabhaV*There were, however, other factors at work apart from purely mechanical loss.Let us go back to the Puranas. Although the Puraoas drew from Tantric sources,their attitude to the Tantras varied and was at times far from positive. Theorthodox community, which the Puranas largely represented, was not always infavour of the Tantras, even though they somehow accepted them. The problem wasthat the Tantras often set themselves in opposition to the orthodox line. Forone thing, the Agamas :, as a whole rejected the authority of the Vedas. SomeAgamic schools took a mere tolerant view, others stuck to a harder line; even sothe Agamic tradition as a whole thought of itself as being quite distinct fromthe Vedic. This was particularly true of the Bhairava and the other classes ofTantras that suffered the greatest loss. Thus the Anandabhairava-tantradeclares:The wise man should not elect as his authority the word of the Vedas, which isfull of impurity, produces but scanty and transitory fruits and is limited, [Heshould instead sustain the authority] of the Saiva scriptures,Abhinava remarks:That which according to the Veda is a source of sin, leads, according to thisdoctrine of the left, directly to liberation. In fact, all the Vedic teaching isdominated by Maya. 34The Puranas basically sustain the authority of the Vedas. Under-The Saiva Agamasstandably they therefore reacted against these scriptures which so explicitlyopposed themselves to it. Sometimes these differences were simply ignored; inother cases, however, the Purarias manifested an open hostility towards theSaivagama. The Puranic passages which represented the orthodox standpointstaunchly condemned these scriptures as infenor. TUey agreed that Siva hadrevealed them, but his reason for doing so was to delude the apostate anddistract him from the true path: they are the scriptures of darkness (tamast)^The Kurmapurana is particularly adamant in its opposition to these scripturesand repeatedly stresses that the Vedas are the sole source of right conduct andtrue religion (dharma)* The Kurma, which is a Saiva Purana, wants todisassociate itself completely from Agamic Saivism. It displays an almostobsessive concern to condemn the scriptures of the heretical (pasanda) Saivites,namely those of the Kapalikas, the Bhairava and Varna Tantras, the Yamalas andthose of the Pasupatas.^ Similarly in the Varahapurana, Rudra himself denouncesthe Pasupatas and the other followers of the Saivagamas as given to \"mean andsinful acts\" and as \"addicted to meat, wine and women\". 3 * Their scriptures areoutside the pale of the Vedas (vedabahya) and contrary to them » The stnartaSakta Devibhagavata unambiguously declares that Siva made the scriptures of theVamas, Kapalikas, Kaulas and Bhairavas with the sole intention of deluding them.Even so, it is more tolerant towards these scriptures than the Kurmapurana, andso prescribes that those portions of them that do not go against the Vedas canbe accepted without incurring sin. 40These instances are just a few of many examples that clearly demonstrate that amarked tendency existed within Hinduism to reject these scriptures and condemntheir followers. It is not surprising, therefore, that these Tantric traditionswere at times actively repressed. We readjor example, in hagiographies ofSankara's life of his encounter with the king of the Vidarbhas in easternMaharashtra who asked Sankara to suppress the heretical views of the followersof the Bhairavatantras^ request with which he gladly complied, 41 King Yasaskaraof Kashmir (938-48 A.D.) was concerned to enforce the rules regulating the casteand conditions of life {varnasramadharma) amongst his subjects and was thereforeagainst the Tantric practices of the Saivagamas which had no regard for them. Hewas so opposed to these practices that he did not hesitate to imprison even thenephew of his foreign minister for attending Tantric gatherings {cakramelaka)* 2_This resistance within Hinduism to the Agamas was not, however, the direct causeof their loss, although it must have been a crucial attendent factor Theinterruption that occurred in the Tantric tradition was catastrophic: it tookplace suddenly and was totally devastating. We mustThe Saivagamas11therefore seek a cause which was immediate and directly effective. Nor do wehave to look far. The eleventh century, which marks the beginning of this changein the Tantric tradition, coincides with a sudden reversal in the course ofIndia's history, namely, the advent of Muslim rule. In the beginning of theeleventh century the brief incursions of Muslim raiders into Indian territoriesthat had been going on for centuries turned, under the lead of Mahamud ofGhazni, into a full-scale invasion. The onslaught of Islam forced Hinduism toretreat, challenging its resistance and stability as a whole. The Muslimscholar, Al-BirunI, who came to India with the invading armies noted that \"theHindu Sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conqueredby us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir,Benares and other places.\" 43 Mahamud of Ghazni did not manage to conquerKashmir, although he plundered the Valley in 1014 A. D. and again attacked it,this time without success, in the following year. But even Kashmir, althoughoutside the Muslim's reach for the time being, felt the intense impact of theMuslim presence in India. Ksemendra, the Kashmiri polymath, describes in hisActs of the Incarnations of Visnu (Dasavataracahta) written in 1066 A.D., thedire conditions that will prevail in the world on the eve of the coming ofKalki, Vismi's last incarnation who was to finally herald the dawn of a new ageof freedom. He says:The Dards, Turks, Afghans and Sakas will cause the earth to wither as do theleper his open, oozing sores. Every quarter overrun by the heathen (mleccha),the earth will resound with the sound of swords drawn in combat and her soilwill be drenched with blood. 44The following centuries, during which the Muslims consolidated and extendedtheir rule, witnessed the disappearance of Agamic Saivismin the north of India.The Agamic Siddhanta survived these upheavals by fleeing to the South where theMuslim presence was not as powerful as in the North. Dunuwila writes:After the twelfth century the Siddhanta seems to have been losing popularityover most of India, giving way to more syncretic forms of Hinduism. TheSiddhantins also seem to have lost their posts as Royal Preceptors with thedownfall of the dynasties that patronized them, as did the Kalacuris in theearly thirteenth century. What remained of the Siddhanta was apparentlyannihilated by the ever-increasing Muslim incursions into Central India from themore northern regions of the country already under Muslim dominion. The Hinduwill to resist the Islamic invaders, never very firm, was demoralized byPrthvlraja IITsdefeat at Tarian in 1192. Malwa, the Siddhanta's homeland, was raided by theMamluk Delhi Sultan Iltutmish in 1234-35 by ms successor Balban in 1250, and bythe Khalji Sultan Jalaluddln in 292. The Muslims finally triumphed in 1305, whenAlauddin Khah. overran Malwa, destroying, among other places, the sacred city ofUjjaym. and Bhoja's capital Dhara. The Siddhanta had to take refuge in the Tamilcountry to survive. 45The Tantras of the Pascimamnaya composed during this period are intensely awareof the harmful consequences of these developments According to the M fl«rt*K»ftA«fr«wr/a«/r fl> thedemDn Ravaoa mcarna ed in this Age of Darkness(Kaliyuga) and descended onto the bank of the Indus, thus initiating the tyrannyof the heathens' rule that extended its sway throughout the world.\" AnotherTantra of the Kubuka school describes the dreadful state which prevails in theAge of Darkness as one in which the lower classes are oppressed by the proudHindu amtocracy even though it has been defeated in battle and so must,presumably, accept foreign domination.^ Just as the Siddhanta found refuge m theSouth the cult of Kubjika was similarly protected by the patronage of tteNepalese who eagerly adopted it as their own. Thus, it has survived to this dayalong with the huge royal libraries and many private collections large and smaUwhere virtually all that remains of the early Agamic sources in North India1$ ^ifwat not until the late thirteenth century that Kashmir finally succumbedto the Muslim invader and so we find, as we have already noted that the Agamasexisted intact in the twelfth century when Jayaratha wrote his commentary onAbhinava's Tantraloka. However.in Kashmir, which must have been one of the mostnourishing centres of Agamic Saivism in India, the powerful internal forceswithin the momstic Agamic traditions that led to the further development ofmonistic Saivism in the hands of Kashmiri Saiva theologians and exegetes alsohelped to render obsolete the Agamas, which were their original sources andfoundation. The Kama rituals which were controversial gradually ceased to beperformed, giving way to tamer and milder cults, such as that ofSvacchandabhairava, while the deeper philosophical, psychological and mysticalinsights behind the symbolic actions of the Kaula ritual were transferredentirely into the realms of philosophy and a mysticism of graded innerexperiences. Thus the original scriptures, which were concerned with ritual,ceased to serve a purpose and all that remamed was their philosophical andmystical exegesis. In Nepal on the other hand, where these sorts of developmentsdid not take place, the Nepalese abandoned themselves to the opposite extreme-aformal ritualism which,Major and Secondary Divisions13though charged with meaning, had lost all significance for them beyond theritual act itself. Thus the Nepalese, unlike the Kashmiris, did preserve theoriginal Tantras they made use of in their rituals, but largely failed to seeanything beyond their immediate content.But apart from these extrinsic factors, a highly significant intrinsic factorcontributed to the loss of these scriptures, namely, the internal ^ developmentof the Saivagama itself. The Saivagamas, even those most / Saiva-oriented,accommodated within themselves the concept of Sakti, 48 \\ This trend developedwithin some of the Saivagamas towards such a \\ female-oriented view that at acertain stage, they simply ceased to be Saiva. ,/' The Saktatantras took overand, permeated with the earlier Kaula doctrine and ritual forms, preserved,along with those Tantras which continued to consider themselves to be Kaula(although not directly connected to their predecessors), the presence of thisantinomian element within Hinduism, The old was transformed into something new,which replaced what had gone before so completely that all that remained was adim memory of a glorious past in the form of the names of the ancient Agamas nowgiven to new works. 49 The most hardy survivor of these far-reaching changes wasthe mild Kaula cult of Srlvidya. The Pascimamnaya is another Kaula cult that hasmanaged to survive almost to the present day, although only within the narrowconfines of Nepal.Saivagama—Its Major and Secondary DivisionsAt the outset of our exposition of the extent and divisions of the Saivagamiccanon, with a view to ultimately determining the place of the Pascimamnayawithin it, it is important to note that although each Agama does identify itselfas a member of a cognate group, it is, ideally, complete in itself. 50 Indeed,the standard pattern in many large Agamas of every type is the exposition of theessentials for a complete cult. These include the rites of initiation along withother occasional and obligatory rituals as well as the rules of conduct to beobserved together with some theoretical considerations about the nature ofreality and other matters. Many of the large temple complexes in South India,both Saiva and Vai^nava, affiliate themselves to one or other Vaisnavasamhita orSaivagama on the basis of which (in theory at least) they were built and worshipin them is conducted, Abhinavagupta frequently refers to a Tantra as a teaching(Msana) in its own right. Again, although he accepted all Saiva scripture asauthoritative to a degree, the Siddhayogesvarimata, {A)namakatantra and Matini-The Saiva Agamasvijayottara were singled out as the ultimate authorities for the Tnka Tantricismhe sponsored. He also sustained the Siddhayogesvanmata * claim to being the mostimportant of all the scriptures.The primary textual tradition orders itself into canonical corpuses of sacredliterature, which reflect upon themselves as belonging to a single eroup and sostrive to concretely supplement and extend each other within fhe parameterschosen for themselves. We can observe this happening more commonly with primaltexts belonging to the early formative period of Tantra. This tendency is morenoticeable the more restricted the group becomes. Thus the scriptures of thePascimamnaya, which constitute a subdivision of a much larger category ofscriptures, form a relatively coherent group. The rituals of the individualTantras of the Pascimamnaya do, in fact, share many common details. The basicMantric system, for example, is fairly uniform in the majority of the PascirnaTantras, and matters which one Tantra deals with cursorily are taken up andelaborated in another.In this way the huge body of primary texts consists of a manifold in which eachmember is independent although connected, more or less directly through themediation of common affiliations variously established, to others. It is notsurprising, therefore, if we come across a certain amount of incoherence (not tosay, at times, outright contradiction) even between texts belonging to the samegroup. Indeed, one o! the functions of the Tantric master in the ordering anddevelopment of the Tantric tradition is to sort out these textual problems. ThusAbhinava-gupta explains in his Taniraloka that the Tantric master who teacheshis disciples the meaning of the scriptures must, if necessary, proceed throughthem as a frog does, leaping from place to place within them. He must have aneye for every detail and observe it in its broader context, viewing the text asa whole, as does the lion strolling through the jungle who looks in alldirections as he walks. Paraphrasing the Devyayamala, Abhinava says:The master should explain the statements [of the Tantra, demonstrating and]corroborating their consistency by means of their interconnection^ apply thisprinciple to the various sections of the text its chapters, sentences, words androot meaning (sflw). He should ensure that the preceding and subsequent sectionsof the scripture do not appear to contradict each other and so apply, asrequired, the principles [that one must move from one section to the next] as afrog leaps [omitting what is irrelevant], or as the Hon who looks around [in alldirections as he walks]. In this way he should coalesce the meaning of thescripture into a single coherent expression unconfounded with other teachings.Knowing well the meaning of each phrase as he expounds it, he avails himself ofsound associations (tantra), repetition (avariana),Major and Secondary Divisions15exclusion (badha), extensive application (prasatiga) and reason (iarka), etc,taking care to distinguish one topic from another. S!The manner in which Saivism developed in these early primary texts is analogousto the development of Hinduism as a whole: subsequent developments are viewed asbeing culminations of what has gone before in such a way that what is newappears not only as superior, but also incorporates all that has happened in thepast. In this manner new scriptures can maintain their canonicity within (inthis case, an amazingly rapidly) expanding corpus that encompasses what is oldin a new system of classification in which the newcomers can reckon themselvesto be amongst the members of the highest class.We can observe this process happening in the sections of the Agamas dealing withthe Agamic canon. These sections are an important part of the text because it isby means of them that the text can validate its own canonicity while at the sametime present itself as belonging to a well-defined category of scripture, As newdevelopments take place, these categories are extended, and subdivisions addedor redefined. A particular Tantra may assert itself as a major member of a groupand so institute new categories to make a place for itself or elevate old onesto a new, higher status. In other words, a text that records the structure ofthe canon is free to interfere with it. At times, this leads to a major changein the form of the canon. More often however, these changes are minor, indeed,sometimes none need be made if the text can accommodate itself amongst theothers as a member of an already established group. Even so, the picture we getof the canon is, at times, perplexingly mutable. Moreover, matters are furthercomplicated by the fact that more than one system of classification usuallyoperates at one time. Thus a given text may fall into a number ofclassifications operating at different times, A text may understand itself, andthe extent and nature of the group to which it belongs, in different terms thanit is understood by another text—particularly if the latter is of a differentclass. Another factor which adds to the confusion is that some terms ofreference to groups are broader than others. If all this were not enough, wealso find that seemingly identical paradigms of classification are applied todifferent groups.In order to understand the overall scheme of the Saivagama, we shall now brieflyconsider what different texts have had to say about their own location in it,and from that try to form a picture of its extent and parts. We shall begin byseeing what the Saivasiddhanta has had to say.According to the Kamikagama 51 , spiritual knowledge was originally of twotypes, superior (para) and inferior (apara), according to the level ofThe Saiva Agamasintelligence of those fit to comprehend it. Sivajnana, which illumines thenature of Siva, is superior while inferior is that knowledge which, startingfrom the Veda, illumines the nature of the fettered soul ipasu) and that whichbinds him {paid). These two degrees of knowledge are as different from oneanother as the night vision of a cat and that of a man. 53 Saiva scriptureencompasses both the superior and inferior degrees of knowledge insofar as Sivais considered to be the ultimate source of both. The higher knowledge is dividedinto four groups. These are, in descending order of importance: Saiva, Pasupata,Lakula and Somasiddhanta. Each is again divided into three: Right (daksina),Left (vama) and Siddhanta in such a way that the highest is Saivasiddhanta.*According to a similar classification found in the Siddhanta manuals of SouthIndia, there are two basic categories: Siva and Saiva. These are subdivided asfollows: 55SivaVamasivaDaksinasivaMiSraiiva or YamaiaSivaSiddhantaslvaSaivaPasupataSomasiddhantaLakulaClearly, the basic scheme consisting of four components, namely, Saiva Pasupata,Lakula and Somasiddhanta, has not changed. Ail that has happened is that thefirst of these four has been further analysed. Indeed, this basic scheme recursfrequently in the Siddhantagamas 56 where it is generally integrated (as happensin the Kamikagama) into the larger scheme we shall discuss later. It appears tobe one of the most basic classifications of the Saivagamic schools and so,possibly, one of the oldest. Let us therefore examine it a little more closely.Important sources for us are the commentaries on Brahmasutra 212131 whichstates: \"For the Lord there can be no creatorship for that leads toincongruity.\" Commenting on this aphorism, Sankara simply refers to theMahesvaras as those who worship Siva as the supreme God. Vacaspati Misra (c. 850A.D.) divides the Mahesvaras into four: Saiva, Pasupata, Kapalika and KarunikaSiddhfintins.\" Yamunacarya (c. 1050 A D) in his Agamaprdmanya, lists the samebasic four as Saivas, Pasupatas, Kapalins and Kaltaiukhas « Most latercommentators follow this classification. Ramanuja in his commentary on theBrahmasutra listsMajor and Secondary Divisions17the same four declaring, mistakenly, that they are Pasupata sects because theirfollowers agree that Pasupati is the instrumental cause of the universe. 59Kesava Kasmlrin agrees with this view, 60 while Srlkantha correctly explainsthat they are all believers in the Agamas revealed by Siva, rather than justPasupatas. 61We find the same set of four in the Puranas and other independent sources.Lorenzen has collected a number of references to these groups and lists them inhis book, Although Lorenzen's chart is somewhat lengthy, the material itcontains is sufficiently relevant to our present discussion for us to quote mostof it here. 62 See Table 1.Table 1, Saiva Sects Mentioned in the Puranas and Other Sources.Kurma Purana Kapala 63 Pasupata Also Vama,Bhairava, Purva-pascima and PancaratraThe Saiva AgamasWe can draw the following conclusions from these lists. Firstly, despite thevariant names and entries, they effectively establish the uniformity of thissystem of classification. Secondly, we can identify the groups generally called\"Saiva\" with the Saivasiddhanta in a restricted sense (as the Naradtya and SivaPuranas seem to do) and, more general y, with the Saivagama as a wholeconsidered independently of the Pasupatas etc. This conclusion is supported bythe distinction made between the <Siva< and <Saiva> groups in the South IndianSiddhanta manual we have referred to previously. 7 * Moreover, the absence ofthis entry in the lists drawn from the Yogavasmha, Kurma and Lihga PuranasapparentlyPaSupatas and Lakulisa19coincides with the addition of the Bhairava and Vamatantras, which are majorcomponents of the Saivagamic canon. Thirdly, the entry \"Kapalika\" (variants:Kapala, Soma, Saumya and Kankala) appears regularly in almost all the lists andso must be considered to be an independent group. This is true also of the\"Pasupata 1 * and the \"Lakula\" (variants: Nakula, Vakula, Lanjana, Laguda andLangala), Finally, we notice that \"Kalamukha\" (variants: Kalamukha, Kalanana andKalasya) sometimes appears to take the place of the LakullSa Pasupata entry. TheKalamukhas studied Lakulisa's religion {Lakulasamaya) m and doctrines{Lakulasiddhanta)* 1 Kalamukha teachers are regularly praised in inscriptions byidentifying them with Lakulisa^ 2 There can be no doubt, therefore, that theKalamukhas were Lakulisa Pasupatas. Even so, not all Lakulisa Pasupatas wereKalamukhas; it would therefore be wrong to simply identify the two.Let us now turn to a more detailed discussion of these groups individually. Weshall deal first with the Pasupata sects, then discuss the Kapalikas, and thenfinally turn to the Saivagamas and their major divisions.The Pasupatas and LakulisaThe Mahabharata refers to the Pasupata as one of four doctrinal systems (jnanaf*along with the Veda, Sarpkhya-Yoga and Pancaratra. Although the Puranas notinfrequently condemn the Vaisnava Pancaratra as advocating principles contraryto those of the Veda, it is the Pasupatas who are generally considered to be themost subversive. In a myth often retold in the Epics and Puranas, it is Siva,not Visnu, who destroys Daksa's sacrifice in a fit of rage because he was notinvited to it along with the other gods. In the Epic, one of the many variantsof this important myth portrays this event as symbolic not only of the growingimportance of Saivism which seemed, as it developed, to be ousting the olderVedic religion but, more specifically, as an occasion to assert the growingpower of the Pasupatas, Thus, when Siva in his terrible form of Rudra hasdestroyed Daksa's sacrifice, he declares:1, Rudra, for the first time created the mysterious religion of the Pasupata,beneficent to all, facing in all directions, one that can take years or only tendays to master, one which although censored by the foolish because it is inplaces opposed to the order of the rules of caste and stages of life(varriasramadharma), is nevertheless appreciated by those of perfected wisdom{gatanta) and is in fact superior to it, 84The Saiva AgamasIt is not impossible that the reference in the Mahabharata to the four doctrinalsystems we have noted above was written at a time when the Saivagamas had notyet begun to be compiled and their cults had not yet developed, that is, whenthe major representatives of sectarian Sarvism were the Pasupatas. It seemslikely that these Pasupatas, who considered themselves to be independent of theVedic-Smarta tradition were as such, the immediate precursors of AgamicSaivites, Consequently, the latter reserved a place for them amongst their ownnumerous groups and incorporated the Pasupata into their own canonicalcategories.We know very little about the oldest Pasupata groups. According to theMahabharaia, Snkantha, the Lord of the Elements (bhutapatf) and Uma's husband{umapati\\ started the Pasupati cult « Pathak has tried to establish thatSnkantha is a historical figure « his views however have been hotly contestedand largely rejected. A more commonly accepted opinion is that Lakulisa was theoriginal founder of Pasupata Saivism.* Although scholars generally agree thatLakulisa really existed, not everyone shares the opinion of some scholars thathe lived m, or before, the second century.** There can be no doubt, however,that Lakulisa must have lived before the sixth century because it is from thistime onwards that images of him bearing standard Sonographic features began tobePr0d Anyhow however early Lakullsa's date may be, it is far from certain thatPasupata Saivism starts with him. Indeed, it is far from certain that we canidentify the Sivabhagavats mentioned by Patanjah as pre-Lakuhsa Pasupatas, asBanerjee does » Nor can we affirm without doubt that they are amongst theascetic sects mentioned in Pali and other eariy sources*) Even so there are goodreasons to distinguish between the Lakulisa Pasupata and other Pasupata sectsthat have nothing to do with Lakulisa. We have seen that the Pasupatas andLakullsas are invariably distinguished in the Puranas, Agamas and other sources.Lakulisa had tour disciples: Kusika,Gargya,KurusaandMaitreya,^ Each of thesefounded subsects The ascetics of these orders considered themselves to beLakulisa Pasupatas belonging to one or other of four lineages {gotra). They werenot just Pasupatas. We know also that other Pasupata groups did exist, such asthe Vaimalas and Karukas. Although it is not possible to say whether theypredate Lakulisa, there are concrete indications that he did have predecessors.Thus a number of Puranas declare that Siva had twenty-eight incarnations, whichthey list and portray as a lineage of Yoga masters ending with Lakulisa.Dvivedi, who has collated these lists believes that this tradition records,however imperfectly, the names otearly Pasupatas. 92 t ...Although we have no means at present of assessing how much, if any,Pasupatas and Lakultta21historical basis there is for these names, there appears at least to have been atradition which admits the existence of Pasupata teachers prior to Lakulisa.But, whether Lakulisa was the first Pasupata or not, he is without doubt animportant founder figure whose contribution was so substantial that he came torepresent Pasupata Saivism as a whole. Presumably this is why Abhinavaguptadivides Saivism (Saivasasana) into two main currents (pravaha): one associatedwith Lakulisa and the other with Srlkantha, whose teachings (sdsarta) consist ofthe five major streams (srotas) of the Saivagamas we shall discuss later. 93Unfortunately, no original Pasupata scriptures have been recovered. Moreover weare hard pressed to find evidence to prove that such scriptures ever existed. Wedo come across expressions like \"Pasupata-sastra\"znd even hear of its fabuloussize* 4 but we have managed to trace only one concrete reference to a possiblePasupata scripture. This occurs in Bha^totpala's tenth century commentary onVarahamihira's Brhat-samhita 95 where he says that the Pasupatas worship Sivaaccording to the procedures enjoined by the Vatulat antra. All of the few worksso far recovered belong to Lakulisa's school. The oldest is the Pasupatasutraattributed to Lakulisa himself. We also have a commentary called\"pancarthabha$ya\"by Kaundinya, whose date, although far from certain, isgenerally thought to be sometime between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D. 96Although we cannot be sure that the suiras are, as the commentator says, byLakulisa himself, they do, in fact, appear to be quite old and bear many archaictraits. These are apparent particularly in the figure of Pasupati himself who isidentified with Prajapati and associated with the Vedic Rudra with whom heshares a number of Vedic names such as Aghora, Ghora, Sarva and Sarva. Apartfrom the Pasupatasutra the only other extant Lakulisa Pasupata work is theGanakarika by Hara-dattacarya and a tenth century commentary, the Ratnafika, byBhasarvajna. These works, along with summaries of Lakulisa Pasupata philosophyfound in medieval treatises on the philosophical systems, are the sole sourceswe possess. 97 It is possible that LakulIsVs disciple, Musalendra, wrote a workcalled the Hrdayapramana^ and there are numerous quotes from lost works both inthe Ratnaftka and Kaundinya. Unfortunately, the sources are never named, and itis hard to say whether they are original Agamas or not, or if they arespecifically Pasupata scripture or secondary works.The spiritual discipline these works prescribe does not involve complex rites orrequire extensive intellectual development. It is, however, largely intended forthe renunciate, rather than the householder. Thus lay worshipers have only torecite obeisance to Siva (namah sivaya) with folded hands while the celibateascetic is given much more to do. He can beThe Saiva Agamaseither fully naked or wear a single strip of cloth to cover his privities. Heshould practice austerities, such as the penance of sitting amidst five fires.After his morning ablutions he smears his body with ashes and does the same atnoon and in the evening. After his bath he goes to the temple where he sits tomeditate on Siva. As he does so, he should sometimes laugh loudly, sing anddance. Before leaving and saluting the deity, he repeats the seed-syllable\"huduk\" three times and recites his mantra. When he bathes alone, he should payhomage to the lineage of Pasupata teachers (tirthesa) headed by Lakulisa. Afterhis bath he should select a clean place for meditation and stay there topractice it through the day. In the evening the site is again cleared andpurified with ashes. When he feels sleepy, he again spreads ashes on the groundand lies down to sleep.When the Pasupata yogi has developed a degree of spiritual msight ijffina\\ histeacher permits him to practice antinomian behaviour » At this stage of hisspiritual discipline, he should act like a madman ignorant of right and wrong.Pretending to sleep, he snores loudly or rolls on the ground and talks nonsense.When he sees a beautiful woman, he should make lewd gestures at her. In this wayhe courts abuse in the belief that his disgrace will gain for him the doublebenefit of purifying him of his sins and gaining the merit of those who abusehim.The Lakulisa ascetic is, however, basically a disciplined, continent manMoreover, although he is told to behave in a manner contrary to accepted norms,his conduct falls short of the total abandon extremist Tantrics allowthemselves. He can laugh and sing in the temple but he is not allowed to offerSiva anything else if it is not prescribed joo \\ n fact, his behaviour isregulated by injunctions (vidhi) down to the smallest detail For instance, hemust offer garlands to Siva, but they must not be made of fresh unconsecratedflowers, 10 » He cannot simply abandon himself on his own initiative; he mustwait for his teacher* permission to do so. His lewd gestures are justplay-acting; in reality he must avoid woman's company whenever he can. He isspecifically prohibited from even talking to women 1 ** 2 and must be strictlycelibate.>« Women are a particularly dangerous source of temptation; they arenot embodiments of the goddess and as such potential Tantric consorts throughwhom communion with Siva could be attained. As Kaundinya says:She whom people regard as woman is [in reality deadly] poison [which consumes aman* life like] fire [and is as dangerous as] a sword or an arrow. She is horrorand illusion (maya) incarnate. Fools, not the wise, revel in the body full ofimpurities and worms. Foul smelling and unclean, it is the ephemeral abode ofurine and excreta. It is the sight of a woman, not wine, that maddens a man.Shun therefore woman whosePasupaias and Lakulisa23mere sight, even at a distance, deludes. The world is bitten by the snake whoseform is woman's sexual organ who, with mouth cast downwards, moves between [her]thighs, beyond all control [even that] of the scriptures. I04If the Lakulisa Pasupata works that have been preserved reflect LakuliSa's ownviews, it appears that his path is a peculiar combination of the orthodox andextreme heterodox. As outlined in these works, it is, despite the antinomianelements, as closely linked to the orthodox 'Vedic* patterns as it is to theTantric. If Lakulisa was, in fact, a reformer who revived Pasupata Saivism, assome scholars believe, possibly this reform consisted in a restatement ofPasupata ideals and the rationale behind the Pasupata*s behaviour in such a wayas to make them more acceptable to the Brahmanical literate class.Alternatively, it is possible that Lakulisa brought about a revival of an older,essentially Vedic, form of Saivism that evolved out of the proto-sectarianascetical orders of the Vedic world. These groups were sustained in their idealsby the peculiar figure of Rudra, a Vedic god whose appearance and charactercould serve as the focus of an alternative set of values sustained by theBrahmanical classes. Be that as it may, Lakulisa himself is consistentlyportrayed, both in the Puranas and the Pasupata texts, as a brahmin. TheKarava^amahatmya says that he was an incarnation of Siva born to a Brahmincouple in Ulkapuri and later went to Kayavaroharia where he began to preach. 105Kaundinya says that he was an incarnation of Siva who, taking the form of abrahmin, was born in Kayavatararia. m This place, also called Kayavarohana,Karohana or Kayarohana, is identified with the village of Karvan situated sometwenty miles north of Baroda. Ulkapuri is modern Avakhal in the same region. 107According to the Sivapurana, Siva entered and revived the corpse of a brahminlying in a cremation ground near Kayavaroharia. He did so for the benefit of allbrahmins J 08 According to the Kurmapurana he, \"the Lord of the gods,\" residesin the sanctuary of Kayavatara. m He was the last of Siva's incarnations, all ofwhom come into the world for the welfare of brahmins and to establish the Veda J10 Kaundinya repeatedly stresses that the followers of Lakulisa must bebrahmins. This is because Lakulisa was himself a brahmin and taught his religionto brahmin pupils. 111 The Pasupatasutra itself declares that: \"no brahminreturns to the world,\" Kaunoinya comments: \"no brahmin, be he a householder,student, hermit or ascetic who reads one, two, three or four Vedas or even(merely recites) the Gayatri and who approaches close to Rudra by his conduct,returns to the cycle of rebirth/* 112The Pasupatasutra prescribes that the aspirant should not even talk to a memberof the lowest (sudra) caste, 113 If he happens inadvertently to doThe Saiva Agamasso or-worse-to touch one, he must purify himself by practicing breath controland repeating a Vedic mantra (here called Gayatri) addressed to Rudra 11* Inthis way, his mind is freed from impurity (kalu?a). Several teachers of theKalamukhas who, as we have noted were Lakuhsa Pasupatas, are referred to ininscriptions as brahmins.\"* Their monastic centres were places where thesecelibate ascetics could study every branch of orthodox Sanskrit learning,including the Mtmanisa and the Vedas withtheir auxiliaries^* The P«^^^their Vedic roots. The importance given to the recitation of OJf (a practicenormally forbidden to the lower castes) and the recitation of Vedic Mantras inhonour of Pasupati clearly indicates the Brahmmical character° f ^However, not all Pasupatas had to be brahmins. Dvivedi observes that someof the names of Pasupata teachers listed as preceding Lakuhsa correspond to alist of members of the Ksairiya aristocracy found in the Mahabharata^ TheVamanapurana confirms that Ksatnyas also followed the Pasupata's path.\"*Possibly these references are evidence that Lakullsa did, in fact, introducechanges in this respect into the earlier Pasupata religion. Perhaps also, we canunderstand the specific injunction in the Sutras not to look at urine andexcreta as a reaction against the more extreme practices of the earlierPasupatas that required the handling and even consumption of these and otherobnoxious substances.^In fact we must clearly distinguish between two basic types ot Pasupatatraditions, namely, one that bases itself on the Vedic tradition (or better itsclassical smarta form as it appears in the Puranas, etc.) and one that in theeyes of the former, runs counter to that tradition. We find extensive referencesto the former everywhere in the Puranas, particularly in the Kurma. which can besaid to be the most important Purana for smarta Pasupatas. In this Purana theconsort of the Great Goddess is Pafapati™ and she enjoins that men should followthe ordinances of the Vedas and smflis concerning caste and the stages of life(varnasrama)^ She loves those who do so.'* Pasupati is invoked by reciting theSatarudriya section of the Yajurveda and other Vedic hymns along with theAtharvasirasupanisad™ Indeed, Siva is the embodiment of the Veda and can beknown solely through the Veda, while the Veda* sole object of knowledge is SivaJ\" Prthu's grandson, King Susila, went to the Himalayas and there praised Sivawith Vedic hymns. There appeared before him the sage Svetasvatara, a greatPasupata. He imparted to the king a Vedic mantra and thus initiated him into thePasupata path The king thus entered the last stage of life {sannyasa) and,covering himself with ashes, dedicated himself to the study of the Vedas.'»Everywhere in this Purana, Siva extols the importance of the Pasupata vow:Pasupatas and Lakullsa25Tranquil, with the mind under one's control, the body covered with ashes,devoted to celibacy and naked, one should observe the Pasupata vow. In formerdays I created the supreme Pasupata vow, more secret than secret, subtle and theessence of the Veda, [for man's] liberation. The sage, devoted to the practiceof the Vedas, wearing nothing but a loincloth or single piece of clothing,should meditate upon Siva, the Lord of Beasts (Pasupati). mBut even though Siva enjoins the observance of the Pasupata vow, he goes on tosay that scriptures of the followers of Lakullsa and the Pasupatas are amongstthose that he has created which run counter to the ordinances of the Veda and soshould not be followed. 128 We seem to be faced with a contradiction. TheLakullsa Pasupata path, as outlined in the Pakupatasuira and other extant worksof this school, basically falls in line with the Pasupata path described in theKurmapurana. Yet both the Pasupatas and the Lakullsa Pasupatas are repeatedlycensored in this Purana as heretics and outside the Vedic fold (vedabahya).Similarly, the Devibhagavata stresses that knowledge of the Veda bears fruitonly by applying ashes to the body as a sign of devotion to Siva. It warns,however, that the ashes must not be prepared in the manner described in theTantras nor should they be accepted from the hands of a Sudra, KapaHka or otherheretics including, presumably, non-Vedic Pasupatas. 129The Sivapuraria distinguishes between two types of Saivagama, namely, Vedic(srauta) and non-Vedic (asrauta). The former consists of the essential purportof the Vedas, and is that in which the supreme Pasupata vow is explained. Thelatter is independent and consists of the twenty-eight Siddhantagamas. 13fl Whythen does the Kurma reject some Pasupatas and not others? Again, what should wemake of Abhinava's analysis of the Saiva teachings (Saivasasana) into twocurrents—one associated with Lakullsa and the other with §rikan$ha? 131 Does hemean that LakulIsVs current flows through the Puranas and Smrtis? Probably not,otherwise he would not distinguish between the u Saiva teachings 11 and those ofthe Vedic tradition, which he says are its very opposite, 132 The Saivagamas do,in fact, frequently refer with approval to the Pasupatas and make room for themin their world view.Thus the Svacchandatantra, as Dvivedi indicates in his article, 133 hashomologized the places associated with Siva's incarnations prior to Lakulisawith the worlds located in the metaphysical principles (tattva) which constitutethe cosmic order. The Agamas in general, as we have already noted, accept boththe Pasupata and Lakullsa Pasupata as branches of the Saiva teachings. Moreover,Abhinava associates them particularly with the monistic Tantric traditions whichhave contributed to the formation of Kashmiri Saivism and sees them as beingintimatelyThe Saiva Agamasrelated to the Kauia and Bhairava TantrasJ 34 This association is apparentlyconfirmed by the Puranas which treat the Pasupatas and followers of the Varnaand Bhairava Tantras as groups of equally heretical Saivites. We must thereforedistinguish not only between two types of Pasupatas in general but also, morespecifically, between two types of Lakullsa Pasupatas as well How these Smartaand Agamic Saivites are related to one another is a subject of further research.The KapalikasThe Kapalikas, so-called because they vowed to carry a human skull (kapala\\ areas well known to the common Indian as they are obscure to them. Infamous fortheir extreme antinomian behaviour and for their supposed practice of humansacrifice, they caught the imagination of Sanskrit poets in the past just asthey continue to fascinate the Indian mind to this day. Sometimes hardly morethan an object of ridicule for his superficial hedonism and peculiar beliefs andway of life, the Kapalika is more often portrayed as a villain dedicated to theexercise of his magic powers, which he acquires through his penance, Mantras andawesome, often violent, rites. Krsna Misra (c. 1050-1100) creates a Kapalika inhis play, the Prabodhacandrodaya, who proudly proclaims the essentials of hiscreed as he describes his way of life;\"My charming ornaments are made from garlands of human skulls,\" says theKapalika, \"I dwell in the cremation ground and eat my food from a human skull, Iview the world alternately as separate from God (Uvara) and one with Him,through the eyes that are made clear with the ointment of yoga. . . We(Kapalikas) offer oblations of human flesh mixed with brains, entrails andmarrow. We break our fast by drinking liquor (sura) from the skull of a Brahmin.At that time the god Mahabhairava should be worshipped with offerings ofawe-inspiring human sacrifices from whose severed throats blood flows incurrents/' 135One of the earliest references to a Kapalika is found in Hala's Prakrit poem,the Gathasaptatati (third to fifth century A.D.) in a verse in which the poetdescribes a young female Kapalika who besmears herself with ashes from thefuneral pyre of her lover. 136 Varahamihira (c. 500-575 A.D.) refers more thanonce to the Kapalikas 137 thus clearly establishing their existence in the sixthcentury. Indeed, from this time onwards references to Kapalika ascetics becomefairly commonplace in SanskritKapalikas27literature. However, only half a dozen or so inscriptions which unambiguouslyrefer to the Kapalikas and their ascetic organisations have so far beenrecovered, This is possibly because, unlike the Kalamukhas, Siddhantins andother Saiva groups, the Kapalikas maintained a more strictly itinerant way oflife and did not found durable monastic institutions of any size.The Kapalikas are regularly referred to as \"Somasiddhantins,\" implying that theyhad formulated their own set of beliefs on a rational basis (siddhania).However, they do not appear to have had any scriptures which were peculiarlytheir own, nor written independent works. 138 The Kapalikas seem to have beenascetics who took the vow to live the Kapalika*s way of life; they were adistinct sect in this sense alone. Hindu Kapalikas were invariably Saivites whoimitated in their own way the peculiar behaviour of Siva, their mythicalexemplar. It was possible for members of differing Saiva sects to adopt theKapalika's vow. Even Buddhist ascetics could take similar vows in the context oftheir own Tantric practice. Thus Kanhapada (Skt. Krsnapada) who lived in theeleventh century and is well known as one of the Bengali Siddhas of the BuddhistTantric Sahajlya school calls himself a Kapalin. He is such, he says, because hehas entered into the higher path of Yoga and is sporting in the city of his bodyin non-dual form. 139 His anklets and bells (ghariti) are the two breaths whichrepresent the opposites. His earrings (ktifitfala) are the sun and moon. Theashes he smears on his body are the ashes of passion, aversion and error. Hispearl necklace is the highest liberation. 140 These are the same insignia thatdistinguish the Saivite Kapalika as well, namely, the necklace (kunthika), neckornament (rucaka), earrings (kundala), crest jewel (sikhdmarii), ashes (bhasma)and sacred thread (yajnopavlta). Ui Most important of all is the skull theKapalika carries, which distinguishes him from other ascetics and symbolizes hisantinomian way of life.The Aghori is the Kapalika's modern counterpart. Committed to a spiritualdiscipline which aims at freeing him directly from every contrast between theopposites of prescribed and forbidden conduct, his disregard for theconventional norms of behaviour has earned him, as it did the Kapalika, anambiguous reputation. On the one hand, the conventions of the world do not touchhim and so in India, where the subjective sense of personal freedom isconsidered to be a measure of spiritual development, the Aghori is a saint. Atthe same time, as one would expect, he is considered (especially by the highercastes) to be unclean and vulgar. Nonetheless, he is respected and even fearedfor the powers (siddhis) he acquires by the strangeness of his way of life. Amodern observer who has spent time with these ascetics in IVianikarnika, themain cremation groundat Benares, writes that the Aghori:may go naked orctothe himself in a shroud taken froma corpse,wear a necklace of bones around his neck and his hair in matted curls, his eyesare conventionally described as burning-red, like live coals; his wholedemeanour is awesome, and in speech he is brusque, churlish andfoul mouthed The Aghori sleeps over a model bier (made from theremnants of a real one); smears his body with ashes from the pyres, cooks hisfood on wood pilfered from them and consumes it out of the human skull which ishis constant companion and alms-bowl. . . . The 'true* Aghori is entirelyindifferent to what he consumes, drinks not only liquor but urine and eats notonly meat but excrement, vomit and the putrid flesh of corpses J 42A linga is installed in an open shrine in the cremation ground called,significantly, Kapaleivara—the Lord of the Skull. Kapalesvara is worshipped hereby the resident Aghori, who acts as the officiating priest for his cult. He isjoined at dawn every morning by a small group of householders who are followersof Rama Avadhuta, a well-known Aghori belonging to the Klnaram sect, named afterthe Aghori who founded it in the eighteenth century in Benares. Thesehouseholders call themselves Kapalikas although, technically, they are not so.Travelling back in time we observe that Saiva sects in the past have alsoassociated themselves with the Kapalikas because they resembled them. We shouldstress here that this resemblance did not necessarily imply that they advocatedsuch a shocking life style. In fact, we more often find that the Kapalika isthought to be a man who has shaken off all worldly ties (avadhuta) and hisantinomian behaviour is understood to be a meaningful visible expression of theliberated life (jlvanmukti) he leads. This is how the Kapalika and his code ofconduct are viewed in the Natha tradition that has associated itself in thepast, although somewhat peripherally, with the Kapalikas. Our source is theGoraksasiddhanta-sarngraha, a late medieval Sanskrit work. The anonymous authorquotes from the Sabaraiantra a list of twelve sages to whom the Kapalikadoctrine was revealed, namely: Adinatha, Anadi, Kala, Atikala, Karala, Vikarala,Mahakala, Kalabhairava, Batuka, Bhutanatha, Viranatha and SrikarMha, Thesetwelve each had a disciple who propagated the path. They were: Nagarjuna,Jacjabharata, Hariscandra, Satyanatha, Bhimanatha, Goraksa, Carpa^a, Avadya,Vairagya, Kanthadharl, Jalandhara and Malayarjuna. i4i Several of these namesappear in the Natha lists of eighty-four Siddhas and nine Nathas, notably thatof Gorakhanatha himself, who is also associated with the Sabaraiantra^ andAdinatha, who is generallyKapalikas29accepted by Gorakhanathis to be Matsyendranatha*s teacher who was Gorakhanatha*spreceptor. 145 Although we cannot expect to glean much of real historical valuefrom this list, its existence indicates how easily the Kapalikas are alignedwith other Saiva groups. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Kapalikaswere frequently confused with other Saiva groups, such as the Kaulas whosescriptures we shall discuss in the second part of this book. 146The Kapalikas worshipped Bhairava, the wrathful form of Siva who, because hedecapitated Brahma, was forced to carry a skull as penance, According to theVamanapurarta, H1 it was because Siva was a Kapalin that Daksa did not invitehim to the sacrifice he had prepared for the gods. In this version of the myth,the orthodox tradition represented by Daksa does not appear to be concerned toexclude Siva from the pantheon as much as Bhairava—the Skull Bearer and the godof many Saiva Agamic cults, including those of the Kapalikas.The Kapalikas who, as we have already noted, do not appear to have hadscriptures of their own, looked to the Bhairavagamas as their authority. Madhavain his Sahkaradigvijaya describes a meeting between Sankara and Krakaca \"theforemost of Kapalin teachers.\" Krakaca mocks Sankara for being a half-heartedSaivite who smears his body with ashes but even so prefers to carry an impure'clay bowl rather than a human skull:\"Why,\" he then asks, \"do you not worship Kapalin? If he does not receive yourworship as Bhairava with liquor (madhu) and the blood-smeared lotuses which arehuman heads, how can he be blissful when embraced by Uma, his equal?\"In this way Krakaca is said to \"prattle the essence of the Bhairava-gama$\" m Abattle then ensues between Krakaca's Kapalika followers and Sankara's disciples.Seeing his army routed, Krakaca approaches Sankara and says;\"O devotee of evil doctrines, behold my power, Now you will reap the fruits ofthis action!\" Closing his eyes (Krakaca) placed a skull in the palm of his handand briefly meditated. After that master of the Bhairavagamas had thusmeditated, the skull was immediately filled with liquor (sura). After drinkinghalf of it, he held (the remaining half) and thought of Bhairava J 49Bhairava then appears as Mahakapaiin, the Bhairava of UniversalThe Saiva AgamasDestruction (Samharabhairava). But instead of killing Sankara, as Krakaca ordershim to do, Sankara convinces him to kill Krakaca instead.Krakaca and his disciples are expressly said to be Kapalikas and distinguishedfrom the followers of the Bhairavatantras that Madhava says Sankara vanquishedbefore he met Krakaca. 150 Even so, Krakaca evidently derives his power from theBhairavatantras in which he is well versed, It is not surprising, therefore,that the adepts of the Bhairavatantras and other Tantras like them, such as theVarna and Kaula groups, are similar to the Kapalikas in many respects. ThusBana, the seventh century poet, describes a Bhairavacarya in his Harsacaritawho, as Lorenzen remarks, \"performed a Tantric ritual appropriate for aKapalika.\" 15 ' His Up hung low \"as if overweighted by the whole Saivite canon(Saivasamhita) resting on the tip of his tongue.\" 152 He worshipsMahakalabhairava, the god for whom Tantric rites are performed. TheBhairavacarya is engaged in magically subduing a Vetala by offering black sesameinto a fire burning in the mouth of a corpse upon which he sits in the densedarkness of a moonless night. 153 But, however striking the resemblance may be,he is not a Kapalika,The Bhairavagamas do, in fact, outline many rituals and patterns of behaviourthat can serve as the basis for the Kapalika's practices. We have already notedthe form of the initiation prescribed in the BY. 154 (See pp. 128-133 forabbreviations.) In the same Tantra (which belongs to the Bhairava group) alengthy section is devoted to a ritual known as the \"Sacrifice of the Skull\"(turayaga) in which the deity is invoked and worshipped in a human skuiU 55According to Abhinavagupta, this rite can take the place of the moreconventional worship of Siva's Linga^ 6 which, although more extensively treatedin the Siddhantagamas, is also prescribed in the Bhairavatantras. This rite,which involves ritual sex and the offering of wine and meat (even beef and humanflesh), is clearly based on the power the skull possesses to invoke the awesomepresence of Bhairava and the other gods and goddesses worshipped in it. We arereminded here of Krakaca's skull and the magical powers {siddhis) he possessesby virtue of his penance, that is, the vow he makes to carry a skull(Kapalavrata).Although the Sacrifice of the Skull and the Kapalika's vow are independent ofeach other, they belong to the same world; the culture of the cremation groundwhere death and decay are not just reminders of the transitoriness of life butawesome sources of yogic power and, for those who seek it, liberation. Carryingthe skull of a brahmin, thus imitating Bhairava's penance for having severedBrahma's head, 157 the votary of the Vow of the Skull gains the god's cosmicpower. This vow is one of a number, including that of the Pasupata, that theinitiates of theKapalikas31Bhairavagamas can undertake J 5S Even so, the Agamas distinguish between theKapalikas, as Votaries of the Skull (Kapalavratiri), and other Saivite yogis,ranking them separately in a group of their own along with the Pasupatas. Thisgroup is called the Higher Path (atimarga) f l$<)According to the Svacchandatantra, the Higher Path is so called because it isbeyond all intellectual notions and the knowledge of it transcends the world.The worldly are the fettered who travel the path of creation and destruction,whereas the ones who adhere to the Vow of the Skull and the Pasupatas areestablished on the Higher Path beyond it and so are no longer subject to furtherrebirth. 160 Another reason why this group is called the \"Higher Path\" can beunderstood if we examine how the Agamas in general, and the Siddhanta inparticular, conceive of the relationship between themselves and other technicaland sacred literature (sastra). According to the Kamikagama^ 61 all existingsdstras are divided into five groups which, although ultimately uttered by oneof SadaSiva's five faces, are created through the mediation of a Karanesvara whois one of five deities collectively called the Five Brahmas (pancabrahma). SeeTable 2.Table 2. The Treatises and Scriptures Spoken by Sadasiva's Faces.The LaukikaSastras are the secular arts and sciences, including politics,medicine, dramaturgy and horticulture. The adhyatmikasastras are the Samkhya andYoga while, according to K$emaraja, the knowledge taught on the Higher Path is\"beyond the well-known path of the Veda, Samkhya and Yoga, etc.. It refers hereto the means [to liberation and the acquisition of power] explained throughoutthe Supreme Lord's scripture in general, namely, the many rituals, mana*alas&ndgestures (mudrd). It is not independent of the [other] four.\" 162 It is quiteclear that what K$emaraja is saying here is that the Saiva groups that belong tothe Higher Path draw from the sacred texts and treatises belonging to the othercategories and do not possess a corpus of scripture of their own. We arereminded here of the Pasupata Kalamukha teachers who are praised inThe Saiva AgamasSouth Indian inscriptions as erudite scholars in all the major branches ofSanskrit learning and who, by their knowledge of the Supreme Soul's scripture(paramatmagama), the Lakulagama, contributed to the Lakullsa Pasupata system. mEssentially, therefore, the Saivagamas are the Mantratantrasastra manifested bySadaswa through Is&na, hisupperface. Insofar as each face is supposed to possessall five faces, the Mantratantra group is also divided into five. See Table 3.Table 3* Divisions of the Mantratantra*This system of classification is common to the Siddhantagamas as a whole 164 andappears to have originated with them. Moreover, Jayaratha tells us that allAgamic Saivites generally accept that the Saiva teachings are divided into thesefive major currents of scripture, 165 The Siddhanta-gamas stick closely to thisbasic scheme while many major Agamas of other types modify it in various waysand sometimes also integrate it with other systems of classification for theirown purposes. A good example of how these modifications take place can beobserved in the way Trikatantras prevalent in Kashmir present the Saiva canonfrom their own perspective. Thus the Srikamhiyasamhita, which Abhinava treats ashis major authority in these matters, divides the scriptures into three groupsbelonging to Siva, Rudra and Bhairava respectively. The first two constitute theSiddhantagamas and the third is related to the Bhairava-tantras. This divisioninto three groups suits the SKS purpose which is to establish that the threeaspects of Trika are the source and essence of the scriptures. But although thecurrents of scripture are reduced in number, they are still said to originatefrom Sadasiva's five faces which produce them by combining in various ways. 166Consequently, Abhinava still considered the original five-fold division of thescriptures to be the most basic and fundamentally linked to the very structureof reality as aKapalikas33manifestation of the five powers of universal consciousness. Abhinavawrites:The phenomenal aspect [of reality] born of consciousness shines radiantly andspontaneously through the Five Brahmas in the five individualized powers of itsown nature, the forms of which are consciousness, pulsation, will, knowledge andaction. (Thus) assuming the nature of scripture, it unfolds five-fold. i67The Siddhanta, which universally categorizes itself as the \"upper current\" andhence as the highest class, i68 consists of twenty-eight principal Agamas, ofwhich ten are Sivagamas and eighteen Rudragamas, The list of these twenty-eightAgamas is well known and recurs regularly, not only in the Agamas of theSiddhanta but also in those belonging to other groups, 169 thereby indicatingthe Siddhanta canon's stability and the authority it managed to establish foritself at a relatively early date. The Siddhanta canon is, in this respect atleast, reminiscent of the Puranic canon. Once the number of Puranas had beenfixed at eighteen, they remained eighteen and every major Purana thought ofitself as one of them. The Agamic texts were not, however, generally subject tothe manifold additions, subtractions and other changes that occurred regularlyin Puranic texts, The Agamas simply increased in number. In the case of theSiddhanta, where the number remained fixed, addition took place by the accretionof subsidiary Agamas (called upagamas) which attached themselves to theprincipal Agamas. However, other Agamic groups—particularly the Bhairavatantras—continued to undergo major developments in their structure through the additionnot just of Agamas that submissively tacked themselves on to others, but ofscriptures that asserted themselves as primary, root texts. Thus the way theseAgamas classified the scriptures had to keep changing in order to accommodatethese additions and the altered understanding of their own identity that wasentailed.In order to understand what changes have taken place in the Saiva canon and howthey have occurred, let us see first of all what we can make out of the basicdivision of scripture into five currents. Below is a list of these Tantras. TheSiddhantagamas are sufficiently well known to be excluded from our presentdiscussion. Originally in the Pratisthalaksana-sarasamuccaya, Dvivedi has, inhis Luptagamasamgraha, reproduced this list in alphabetical order. 17 ° Here theoriginal order in which these Agamas are listed has been restored because, as weshall see, it tells us a great deal See Table 4.Table 4. The Tantras Listed in the Prati$thalak$a?asarasamuccaya-Kapalikas35This list is important for several reasons. Firstly, we know that the author ofthe PLSS, Vairocana, was the son of the Bengali Pala king Dharrnapala whoreigned from 794 to 814 A.D.. m Thus this list furnishes an ante quern for theseworks which can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, it is theonly list we know of at present in which the Daksinatantras are related tojhoseof the Siddhanta in the basic five-fold scheme and in which all the Agamas areclearly enumerated. Thirdly, it appears that this was an early standard list (orone of them) and that it does present a faithful picture of these currents ofscripture (stotas) at an early stage of their development, as the followingdiscussion will hopefully establish.In the Mrgendragama we find that the Saivagama is divided into five majorcurrents and eight secondary ones. Unfortunately, the reference is very concise;even so it supplies us with a number of facts. Here it is:The currents [are as follows]: the Upper [current consists of the Agamas]starting with Kamika. [The Agamas] starting with Asitangabelong to the South, those starting with Sammohana are in the North, To the Westis the extensive [group] starting with Trotala. Eastern are those starting withCan^asidhara of Can^anathaJ 72Here, as usual, the Upper Current is that of the Siddhantagamas. Although theKamika normally heads the list of these Agamas, its explicit mention isparticularly relevant here because the Mrgendra is closely related to it J 73The Dakmasrotas— the current of the Southern Face—is characterised by theAsitangagama which, although admittedly not at the head of the PLSS list, doesfigure as a member of this group. Moreover, the Kamika considers Asitanga to beone of the forms of Siva that spoke these Tantras, 174 According to theMrgendra, the Sammohanatantra heads the next group, namely, the Vamatantrasbelonging to the North. The Sammohana probably corresponds to Mohanam, thefourth Tantra in the PLSS list. The Kamika confirms that there are twenty-fourTantras belonging to this group. Moreover, it considers the Nayasutra to be thefirst of the Vamatantras which tallies with Nayatantra, that heads PLSS's list J75 We know from the Brahmayamala that the Sammohana and Nayottara along with theSirascheda belong to the Vamatantras.™ This is supported by the Jayadrathayamala(also known as the Sirascheda) which says: 177Belonging to the Current of the Left are the perfect [Agamas including] thefrightening Sirascheda. The three: Nayottara, Maharaudra and Mahasarrtmohanahave, O goddess, emerged in the Current of the Left.A further important piece of evidence that these Agamas belong together isfurnished by a Cambodian inscription dated Saka era 974 (1052 A.D.). It refersto the introduction of these Agamas into Cambodia during the reign of JayavarmanII, who came to re-occupy the throne in Cambodia in 802 A,D. after a period ofexile in Java. His priest was a brahmin called Hiranyadama who, with the king'sconsent, revealed to Sivakaivalya, a fellow priest, the Four Faces of Tumburu,namely, the Sirascheda, Vina&kha, Sammohana and NayottaraJ n The king alsoinvited Hiranyadama to perform a ceremony meant to bring about the independenceof Cambodia from Java and establish himself as emperor. The ceremony wasperformed according to the Vina&ikha. During the ritual Hiranyadama recited allfour Tantras so that Sivakaivalya could write them down and learn them,According to the Netratantra, Tumburu is the form of Siva thatKapalikas37presides over the Vamasrotas 179 although, like Sadasiva, he has five instead offour faces, 180 Even so, most other independent sources do describe him ashaving four faces. 181 In the NT, as in other sources, Tumburu is accompanied byfour goddesses. These goddesses are commonly found together in a group in bothPuranic and Tantric texts and need not necessarily be associated with Tumburu,although they are usually his chief companions when he is represented along withhis attendants J 82 The names of these goddesses are significant for us, as theycorrespond (in the feminine) to four Vamatantras in the PLSS list, namely, Jaya(Jayam), Vijaya (Vijayam), Ajita (Ajitam) and Aparajita (Aparajitam). These fourTantras appear together directly below the Vinatantra and thus could well be theVinasikha mentioned in the Cambodian inscription,A manuscript of the Vinasikhaiantra is preserved in Nepal and has been edited byGoudriaan, 183 As one would expect, Tumburu is the chief deity of this Tantraand is portrayed along with the four goddesses. m It is, however, surprisinglyshort and the rituals it describes are relatively simple. Even so, there can beno doubt that this VST is closely associated with the Sirascheda, Sammohana andNayottara to which the goddess refers at the beginning of the Tantra whileexpressing the desire to know more. !8S The Nayottara is mentioned as a sourceof basic rituals the votary of the VST should perform. i86 Similarly otherrituals were drawn from the Sarvatobhadra and Mahasammohana Tantras. 187The Agamas regularly characterise the Vamatantras as being concerned with theacquisition of power: SiddhL m According to the Cambodian inscription,Hiranyadama, \"an expert in the science of siddhi$\" m revealed a unique siddhi toKing Jayavarman and taught it to Sivakaivalya, ]9 ° along with the means toacquire it. In fact, the V§T, which Siva proclaims bestows siddhi, m isprimarily concerned with this. Even the worst sinner, one who has killed abrahmin, can attain this siddhi by performing the rituals of the VST. 192 Here\"siddhi\"do$$ not mean success in Yoga or yogic powers, but rather the successfulcompletion of magic rites and the powers acquired thereby. These rites are oftwo types, either cruel (raudrd) or pure {suci). Amongst the former are thosemeant to subjugate others, defeat and kill one's enemies or create discordbetween friends. The latter include those performed for peace and thepacification of malevolent spirits. Even when the Tantra deals with higheresoteric practices that can potentially lead to communion with Siva, 193 itprefers to devote itself to magic and the acquisition of power. For example,according to this Tantra, when Siva, in the form of the vital breath, movesalong the path of the nerve Pingala, his nature is fiery and bestows the powersto perform the cruel acts (raudrakarman). When Siva moves alongThe Saiva AgamasIda's track, he is nectar and gives the power to perform the pure acts(sucikarman). Between these two nerves lies Susumna, which is the way of release(mok$amarga). m The Tantra* however, almost exclusively deals with the first twopaths. Anyway, the rituals and Mantras taught in the VST lead to both worldlysuccess and release. 195 Once the adept has fully enjoyed all the worldlypleasures the Tantra can bestow, he ultimately reaches Siva's abode. 196Other Tantras of the VamasrotasA number of manuscripts of a Tantra called the Jayadrathayamala, whichidentifies itself as the Sirascheda, are preserved in Nepal. Possibly the sameSirakheda to which the Cambodian inscription refers, it is a long and complextext. According to the Jayadratha's colophons, it belongs to the Bhairavasrotas.However, it affiliates itself to a Middle Current of scriptures between those ofthe Right and the Left 197 while affirming that it belongs equally to both. l9SAlthough the JY's association with the Right Current is well established, thereare numerous links that connect it to the Vamataniras of the Left. One is thesage Sukra who, the JY says, received this Tantra (from Bhairava?) andtransmitted it to men. 199 The VST affirms that one of the rituals it describeswas taught by this sage, who extracted it from the Sarvatobhadra and NayottaraTantras, 200 while according to the JY, Sukra, along with Angiras, received theNayottara and brought it into the world101 Apparently the J Y's syncretisticcharacter and complex affiliations with both the Right and Left currents made itpossible for it to be linked with both as well as either of the two.The JY probably postdates the Nayottara and other major Tantras of the Left.This seems likely not only because it refers to them but also because its systemof classifying the Tantras displays a degree of sophistication that presupposesprevious extensive developments (see below). There can be no doubt, however,that the iY precedes Abhinava-gupta (c. 975-1050 A.D.) who refers to it as amajor authority. Known to the Kashmiris as the Tantrarajabhattaraka, the JY wasan important source for the ritual worship of Kali. There can be no doubt aboutthe identity of these works because we know that the Madhavakula was animportant section of the Tantrarajabhaitaraka m and it is indeed a major sectionof the JY.The Anandatantra is a lengthy Tantra 203 known in Kashmir as the Artandasasana,Anandadhikaratesana, Anandesvara and AnandaMstra.Garuda and Bhuta Tantras39It may possibly correspond to the Anandam listed as no. 17 of the Vamataniras inthe PLSS. Abhinava expressly states that the Anandatantra teaches the \"doctrineof the left\" (vamasasana). 204 It is also one of the Tantras Abhinava cites whenhe describes Vamacara ritual, 205 one of the characteristics of which is theoffering of a drop of libation with the left hand to matrcakra in thesacrificial vessel. 20 * According to the Gama-tantra, the fourth finger andthumb are to be joined when making this offering because these two fingersrepresent power and the possessor of power which, as Jayantl and Tumburu, unitetogether. 207 Elsewhere th& deity of this Tantra is referred to as Vama. mOf course, although the Gamaiantra prescribes ritual procedures for those whopractice Vamacara, this does not necessarily mean that it was a Vamatantra. TheLeft-hand Practice, Vamacara, is a pattern of spiritual discipline and theTantras of the Left a category of scripture: they need not have anything to dowith each other. Even so, the Anandatantra, which was probably a Vamatantra,does discuss Vamacara, while the references to Jayantl and Tumburu in theGamaiantra may indicate that it was, at least in this ritual context, influencedby the scriptures of the Left.The Garutfa and Bhuta TantrasNo Garuda or Bhuta Tantras have been found; the list of these Tantras recordedin the PLSS can, however, be established to be authentic by references fromseveral sources. The Srlkanihlyasamhita states that the number of Garudataniraswas traditionally said to be twenty-eight which agrees with the number in ourlist. 209 The Kamika confirms that the number of Bhuiatantras was twenty. 210Again the passage from the Mrgendraiantra quoted above states that the Garudagroup in the East is headed by the Trotatatantra, m The Totalam and Totalottaramare, in fact, at one end of our list, although not at the beginning, Again,these Tantras are found listed together as a pair in a list of sixty-fourTantras found in the Nitya$og*asikarnava. 212While the Vamataniras are traditionally said to be concerned with theacquisition oisiddhU the Garudataniras are supposed to deal with magicalremedies for snakebite and poisons, and the Bhuiatantras with the exorcism ofghosts and malevolent spirits. 213 Unfortunately, we have not recovered any ofthese Tantras; even so it is possible to get an idea of the sort of rites theydescribed from other sources. In the case of the Garuda-tantras, in particular,our scant knowledge can be supplemented by theThe Saiva AgamasGaru4apurana. The Garudia, like the Agnipurana, appears to have drawn itsTantric material from relatively early sources. It is not at all improbable thatGarudatantras were amongst them. Thus, chapter 19 of this Purana deals with asystem of Mantric formulas belonging to Garuda technically called the \"VidyS ofthe Lord of the Vital Breath\" ipranesvaravidya), which is expressly said to havebeen taught by Siva, Could this teaching have been imparted in a GarudatanirdlIn fact, the Garuqtapurana contains many incantations and magical rites designedto counter snakebite and the effects of poison, all of which are connected withGaruo!a. Worth noting in passing is that some of these rites are Vaisnava, inwhich case Garutfa is represented as a form of Visnu, while others are Saivawith Garutfa portrayed as an aspect of Siva. 2 * 4 It is Visnu who originallygranted Garucla the power to overcome snakes and, because of his sinceredevotion, took him as his vehicle, 215 Thus Garuda's Vaisnava associations areobvious. Even so, the Saiva Garuola Mantras and rites are, as a whole, moreextensively treated in the Garutfapurana than are the Vaisnava ones. Could thisbe because these matters were of greater concern to the Saiva Agamas than to theVaisnava Samhitas? 2 * 6The way in which Garu4a Mantras are applied is basically the same in both Saivaand Vaisnava forms. The body of the ailing person is first transformed into acosmic body of Mantric energies by the projection of Mantras and seed-syllablesonto it. The sick man must then think that he is one with Garuda and so becured, Abhinavagupta declares that a man who identifies with Garuda is freedfrom the effects of poison, 217 thus confirming that these, or similar,techniques were known to Agamic Saivites,Sometimes this process of identification involves long and elaboratevisualizations. An interesting example is a practice Garuda himself is said tohave taught to Kasyapa. It is outlined in chapter 197 of the Garuda-purana. Theadept first visualizes the five elements in the form of symbolic figures(mandala) of various shapes and colours. They are then imagined to be located inseparate parts of the body. Letters and syllables are then projected into thesefigures, which thus become charged with their Mantric powers. Finally, thedivine beings they embody are worshipped and the adept's body is fullytransformed into a microcosm in the centre of which is the Lotus of the Heartwherein resides the Self (atman), the adept's authentic nature. This he mustidentify with Garutfa in the folio wing way:Contemplate your own nature that creates and destroys [all things], beautifuland of the form of passion* as pervading [literally'flooding*] the entireuniverse and encircled with garlands of flames burning radiantly from [the abodeof] Brahma up to this world. To be successful in ailGaruda and Bhuta Tantras41[your] undertakings, remember [that you are] Bhairava who is Garuda. 2 JS[Contemplate yourself as Bhairava] who has ten arms and four faces. His eyes area tawny-brown and he carries a lance. His terrible teeth are exposed in afearful grimace. Extremely terrible, he has three eyes and bears the [crescent]moon on his head. To destroy snakes contemplate [yourself as] Garuda, awesomeand frightening. At his feet lie the hells, the quarters are his wings, he bearson his chest the seven heavens and the universe (brahmantfa) on his throat whilehis head contains all space. Garuda, the Lord of the World, is Siva himself whobears Sadasiva with [his] three powers in his topknot. In all your undertakingsthink of Garu<Ja brilliant like the Fire of Time, his body Mantra, his facefrightening, devouring, three-eyed and his form terrible, the destroyer ofsnakes and poison. Having performed the projection in this way, whatever onethinks becomes [easily] attainable and man becomes in truth Garucla, Seeing him,ghosts, spirits, yaksas, snakes, gandharvas, rak$a$as and all the fevers aredestroyed. 210As we can see from this example, rites designed to counter the effects of poisoncan also be effective against malevolent spirits. It is not surprising,therefore, if the Garutfa and Bhuta Tantras, which specialized in these matters,had, like the Varna and Daksina Tantras, much in common. This supposition issupported by the only known extant Tantra which associates itself with these twogroups, namely, the Kriyakala-gunottara, manuscripts of which are deposited inthe National Archives in Nepal. Ksemaraja quotes this work extensively in thecourse of his commentary on chapter 19 of the Netratantra™ which deals with thevarious types of possession by ghosts and spirits including Pisaeas, Matr,Daityas, Yaksas and Rakfasas. It is clear from the introductory verses of thiswork quoted in the Nepalese catalogue that this Tantra subsumes under a singlecategory of concerns the matters treated in both the Garuda and Bhuta Tantrasand deals with them all equally. 221 That there was much common content in theTantras of these two groups is further confirmed by the citations from theTotulagama Ksemaraja quotes, along with the Kriyakalagunottara, in hiscommentary on the Netratantra. 222 Although the Totalatantra is listed in thePLSS in the Garuda group, these passages refer to possession {bhutaveSa andyaksagraha), rather than magical antidotes for poison.The Toiala and Totabttara are the only Garudatantras, and the Canclasidhara theonly Bhutatantra, to which we find references. 223 It seems, therefore, thatmost of these Tantras were lost at quite an early date. The reason for this ispossibly because the matters they dealt with could be accommodated into thewider perspective of other less specialised Tantras. Thus the Netratantra, as wehave seen, contains a long chapterThe Saiva Agamasdealing with possession as does the Sritantrasadbhdva which Ksemaraja quotes inhis commentary on this part of the Netratantra.The DaksinatantrasThe Tantras that issued from Sadasiva's Southern (daksina) Face are the Tantrasof the Right Current of scriptures (daksinasrotas), while those that issued fromthe Northern (vama) Face are those of the Left {vama-srotas). The Tantras of theRight are called \"Bhairavatantras\" 12 * because Bhairava is their supreme godand is, in most cases, the one who teaches them to the goddess, his consort. TheSiddhantagamas belonging to the Upper Current and the Bhairavatantras of theRight became the most important of all the Agamic groups. 225 As we have alreadynoted, the Garuda and Bhutatantras were largely lost at a relatively early date.The Vamatantras must have been valued and studied, as their presence andinfluence in distant Cambodia testifies. Even so their corpus did not grow asdid that of the Daksinatantras which, on the contrary, developed extensively.The Siddhantagamas largely superseded all the other Agamas in the South ofIndia. In the North, in Kashmir and Nepal^the only regions about which we havesufficient source material to make relatively detailed assessments—theVamatantras were mostly ignored (in Nepal) or relegated to a secondary place (inKashmir),The Bhairavatantras neither dwindled in importance nor acquired the stability ofthe Siddhantagamas but kept on growing both in terms of their number andinternal categories. We cannot be absolutely sure that similar extensivedevelopments did not take place in the other currents of the Saivagama withoutexamining their Tantras or discovering further notices of them in other sources;even so this possibility seems remote. The fact of the matter is that, in theregions in which the Agamas have been preserved, we are left with two basiccategories of Agamic text One includes the Siddhantagamas and their numeroussubsidiary Agamas (updgama) which are preserved largely in South India, 226 Theother, preserved in Nepal, includes the Bhairavatantras and numerous groupsclosely affiliated to them, the most important of which are the Kaulatantras weshall discuss in Part Two of this_ study. Let us see now how these developmentsare reflected in the Agamic accounts of the Saiva canon.Before the ninth century, the division into five currents of scripture-gave wayto a new basic three-fold division into Left, Right and Siddhanta, 227 Thisscheme is found in the Netratantra, which presents theDaksinatantras43mantra of Siva, the Conqueror of Death (Mrtyunjaya), as one by which the gods ofeach Current (srotas) can be worshipped and so finds occasion to deal brieflywith these divisions. 228 Here the presiding deity of the Left is Tumburu; ofthe Right, Bhairava; and of the Siddhanta, 229 Sadasiva. They are presented asaspects of Siva, the Lord of Ambrosia (Amrtesa), in chapters 9, 10 and 11respectively. A similar division into three currents is found in theBrahmaydmata. Although it is not the first Tantra to make use of this system ofclassification, 230 it is not as well defined here as it is in the NT,indicating that it probably precedes it. According to the BY, each of thesethree currents is presided over by one of the three powers (saktitraya) thattogether pervade the \"three worlds.\" 231 The Right Current is considered pure(suddha), the Left mixed (misra), while the Middle one is said to be affected byevery form of impurity. 232 The Middle Current is like rice in its husk, theLeft Current is like rice when the husk has been removed, while the RightCurrent is like rice when it has been washed and made ready for cooking- Thesethree together constitute,the Stream of Knowledge (fnanaugha). 2 ^ The RightCurrent is then expressly identified with Bhairava, while the Vamatantras aresaid to belong to the Left Current and the Siddhantagamas to the Middle, Thelatter are of two types, namely, Sivagamas and Rudragamas, both of which aresaid to originate from the Upper Face (urdhvavakira) just as they do accordingto the Siddhanta. The BY identifies a category of scripture belonging to theRight Current which it calls \"the division into eight times eight 1 '(astdsfaka-vibhdga\\ also known as the \"Eight times Eight Bhairavatantras\"(bhairavastasiaka). Moreover, there is a fourth, the Lower Current (adhahsrotas) to which belong the Tantras that deal with the worship of Ndgas andNarasimha as well as those of the Pancaratra together with the Garuda and BhutaTantras and the Tantras dealing with alchemy (rasdyana). In this way the BYeliminates the Eastern and Western currents of scripture to which the Garuda andBhuta Tantras belong. They thus lose much of their identity, barely surviving inthe Lower Current to which are relegated odd classes of scripture that cannot beaccommodated elsewhere.The account of these divisions in the BY tells us a great deal about thedevelopment of the Saivagama, particularly if we compare it with that of theSrikanfhlyasamhitd and our original list of Tantras belonging to the fourcurrents. The SKS's system of classification basically agrees with that of theBY, although there are important differences also. Thus, the §KS also dividesthe scriptures into three groups but these are said to be the ten Siva, eighteenRudra and sixty-four Bhairava Agamas. This division into three allows the SKS toestablish that these groups correspond to three levels of doctrine, namely,dualism (bheda), unity-in-diversityThe Saiva AgamasDaksinatantras45(bhedabheda) and monism (abheda)™ which are represented as the three powers ofuniversal consciousness constituting Trika and worshipped as the threegoddesses: Apara, Parapara and Para. 2 * 5 In this way the Vamatantras have beeneliminated as a major current of scripture. 336 We notice, however, that some ofthese Tantras are found amongst the sixty-four Bhairavatantras, particularly ina group of eight called Sikha-bheda™It appears that the SKS's categories are more compact units than those of theBY, possibly because the SKS postdates the BY. Moreover, the SKS lists thesixty-four Bhairavatantras in full whereas the BY does no more than barely referto their existence collectively as a group. Again, according to the BY thesixty-four Bhairavatantras are just a part of the Vidyapitha, which is itselfonly a part of the Right Current of scripture. The SKS removes the Siddhantafrom the older division into five currents and relegates the remaining fourcurrents to a secondary level equivalent, broadly speaking, to the BY's LowerCurrent. In the process, the sixty-four Bhairavatantras have become an isolatedgroup which assumes a new and particularly important status.The sixty-four Bhairavatantras are also treated as an important group in the JY's system of classification (see appendix C), where it assumes such a markedlyindependent character that it is not attached to any particular current ofscripture. Thus, although described in detail, it is not fully integrated intothe JY's system of classification, but appears there as an addition or anafterthought. The names of the eight groups correspond exactly in the JY and theSKS, and they are enumerated in the same order. However, in the SKS there is adiscrepancy between the order of these groups when stated in brief, at thebeginning of its detailed exposition of their members, and the order in whichthey are listed when the Tantras of each group are named individually. As theorder of enumeration tallies with that in the J Y in the first instance, therecan be no doubt that the order in which these groups are presented has beenaltered when the SKS deals with them in detail Moreover this fact proves thatthis is a well-established and standardized system of classification. Finally, adetailed comparison of these lists (see below p. 121-3) reveals that more thanhalf of the names of these Tantras correspond. It is quite clear, therefore,that this group came to be considered a fully formed corpus in its own rightwith its own subdivisions which was independent of the original classificationinto currents of scripture. Even so, it remained closely related to it as awhole and directly connected to the current of the Right in which it originatedand developed.In order to understand a little better how the sixty-four Bhairavatantras arerelated to the original thirty-two Daksinatantras, we will nowcompare some lists of these Tantras. What interests us here particularly are thefirst eight Bhairavatantras of the Right Current. According to the SKS eachgroup of eight is associated with eight Bhairavas. These eight Bhairavas occuragain in almost the same order as the names of the Tantras of the first group ofeight, namely, the Bhairavastaka. The Tantras belonging to this group are listedbelow along with another group of eight Bhairavatantras found in the BY and thefirst eight Tantras of the Right as recorded in the PLSS. See Table 5.Table 5. The Bhairavastaka.Listed below are the names of the eight groups of the sixty-four Bhairavatantrasaccording to the SKS (see Table 6). In the first column (Al) are listed thenames of each group of eight Tantras in the order in which they are enumeratedin the SKS prior to their detailed exposition. Their corresponding Bhairavas arelisted in the second column (B1). In the third column (A2) these same groups arelisted in the order in which they appear when the Tantras of each group arenamed individually in the SKS. Their corresponding Bhairavas make up the fourthcolumn (B2).Table 6. The Eight Groups of Bhairavatantras.Al Original Order of the Groups Enumerated in the §KSi. Bhairava2, Yamala3.

Once we have done this, wecan go on to compare this group with the eight Tantras that head the list ofDaksinatantras in the PLSS. First of all, we can assume that the order of thesegroups is as we have it in column A1. This is a reasonable assumption insofar asthis order coincides exactly with the one we find in the J Y. Now if we comparethese lists, we find that entries 3} Al-t-BI and 3} A2+B2 as well as 4) Al+Bland 4) A2+B2 correspond exactly. To 8) AI+B1 corresponds 7) A2+B2. It is clearthat Kapallsa has been displaced from his position as no. 8. Again, the emptyspace created by the absence of a Bhairava for the Yamala group 238 seems tohave moved Cantfaand Unmatta of list Bl down one place. If this is so, the orderof the first five Bhairavatantras in the Bhairavastaka of the §KS and JYcorresponds exactly to those of the Daksinasrotas according to the PLSS. Again6) and 7) B2 are Ruru and Kapallsa who follow one another as no. 6 and 7 in thelist of the Daksinatantras. The original order given in the SKS (column B1)places KapalUa in the eighth place with Mahocchusma in the seventh. It seems,however, that the seventh and eighth were originally Ruru and KapalUarespectively because their corresponding divisions, Bahurupa and Vagiia, are theseventh and eighth in list Al. If this is so, then Mahocchusma is dislodged fromits position as no. 7 in column Bl and moved up to the place of no. 6. In thisway this Tantra preserves its place next to Asitanga. The resultant order thenis; Svacehanda, Cauda, Krodha, Unmatta, Asitanga, Mahocchusma, Ruru andKapallsa. If this order is correct, then all that needs to be done to the listof Daksinatantras is to eliminate Samuccayam—which is not the name of aBhairava—and Mahocchusma can then be accommodated in the gap left in position 6.It is clear, therefore, that the Bhairavastaka and the first eight Tantras ofthe Daksinasrotas were originally the same. In other words, what came to beknown as the Bhairavastaka was a standard group in the Bhairavatantras of theDaksinasrotas which, possibly because it headed the list of these Tantras, cameto be considered as the basis of the sixty-four Bhairavatantras, The Kamikagamasays: \"The Bhairavaiantra originated two-fold from the Southern Mouth.\" 339Daksinatantras47Can it be that the two types mentioned here were the first eight Bhairavatantrasas one group and the remaining Daksinatantras as the other? That theBhairavastaka existed as a group in its own right is confirmed by theNityasodasikarnava which refers to it as constituting eight of the sixty-fourTantras that it enumerates (see below). The list of eight Bhairavatantras in theBY is further proof that this is so. Thus, if we identify Ugra with Canda andrestore him to his place as no. 2 in the list, then the first four correspondexactly, while of the three not found in the Bhairavastaka only one is not foundin the list of Tantras belonging to the Daksinasrotas.™ Finally, it is worthnoting that, apart from these eight, not a single Tantra in the SKS*s listcorresponds to any of the Daksinatantras noted in the PLSS. The reason for thisseems to be that the first eight Tantras of the Daksinasrotas have beenextracted from it to serve as the basic model for the astastakabheda, whichalthough originally just a part of the Daksinasrotas assumed an independentstatus in a different sphere from the original Daksinasrotas. This appears to beclearly the case when we consider that the §KS retains the older classificationas subsidiary to its own Trika-based exegesis of the Saivagamic corpus in whichthe Daksinasrotas now figures as consisting of twenty-four Tantras and notthirty-two. Is this not because the Bhairavastaka has been removed from it?*\"The Bhairavastaka is not the only group which has acquired an identity of itsown. Another important group is that of the Yamalas. In the Kamikagama, theYamalas (without specifying their number) figure as a separate category whichwas not even specifically connected with the Saivagama although the possibilitythat Saivas could practice according to them was allowed for. 242 In the BY theyform a group of eight along with the eight Bhairavatantras and other Tantras inthe Vidyapltha to which the BY itself belongs. 243 The Yamalas are representedas forming a group of their own also in the JY; so too in the NS A 244 which isprobably older than the BY, 245 There can be no doubt, however, that there werea good deal more than eight, 246 and judging from the original Yamalas stillpreserved, many were probably of considerable length. Finally, Bahurupa and Mataare two divisions of eight found both in the SKS and the NSA indicating thatthey were also considered to be groups in their own right.Let us consider next the sixty-four Tantras as a whole. A comparison of thelists of sixty-four Tantras found in the NSA and in the §KS proves to be highlyinstructive from many points of view, both because of their similarities as wellas differences. Firstly, it is a striking fact that there are hardly two titlescommon to both lists. This could perhaps be justified by saying that the SKSlists the sixty-four Bhairavatantras while the NSA lists what it calls thesixty-four Matrtantras. In this case, however, theThe Saiva Agamasexpression \"matrtantra\" should not be understood in a technical sense, becausethe Tantras listed are far from forming a uniform group. Despite the widedivergence between these two lists of Tantras, there are also strikingsimilarities between them. Thus, four groups of eight—as groups—coincide,although the members of these groups, as far as we can tell, are not the same.Indeed it seems that the layout in the NSA is a crude form of that found in the§KS. It is as if a neat scheme of eight by eight is what it is tending towards,having got barely half way with its three astaka-s named as such and the MataTantras which, although they do in fact constitute another group of eight, arelisted individually. Moreover, it seems that the SKS's list is more contrived,less natural than that of the NSA which does seem, on the contrary, to be just alist of important Tantras prevalent at the time and place of its compilation,although the number sixty-four is certainly a symbolic figure. Thus in the SKS,titles are apparently added in places merely to fill out the eight by eightscheme; for example, the whole of the Cakrabheda does not appear to be a genuinerecord of Cakraiantras. The names recorded are: 1) Mantra, 2) Varna, 3) Sakti,4) Kala, 5) Bindu, 6) Nada, 7) Guhya said 8) Khacakra. One could very reasonablyargue that we have here not a group of Tantras, but a mystical ascent ofconsciousness in ordered stages (krama) expressed in the typical symboliclanguage of these texts.It seems, therefore, that the NSA list is the older of the two, which iscertainly possible, as the NSA is older than the BY, 247 That the system ofclassification in the BY is cruder than that of the SKS also suggests that theBY precedes it. Moreover, one could argue that the scheme of eight by eightTantras rather than just sixty-four had not yet been formulated at the time ofthe redaction of the NSA but because the cult of Srividya continued to besustained by a living scriptural tradition, the NSA furnished the model for thesubsequent enumeration of the Tantras into sixty-four rather than eight byeight. 248If the NSA is indeed as old as the evidence seems to suggest, then we mustassign a relatively early date to the Pascimamnaya insofar as the Kubjikamatafigures in the NSA's list of Tantras. This means that the Pascimamnaya existedat the time of the redaction of the NSA, which is in all probability the firstTantra dealing with Srividya and the sixteen Nityas. 249 This is not at allimpossible because the Kaula scriptural tradition is certainly quite old^theSiddhantagamas are well aware of it (see below) as are the Tantras of othergroups. The NSA itself lists three Tantras which can be said to be Kulatantras,namely, the Kulasara, Kuto44is°a and Kulacutfamani™ It is difficult to assigndates to these. texts. However, if we accept that they do succeed each otherchronologically in this way, it is not improbable that the Pascimamnayaoriginated atPitha System49least two centuries before Abhinavagupta, that is, in the eighth or ninthcentury and is probably older. This is the most we can say at present. Before weproceed to the next section of our exposition, a few remarks remain to be madeabout some other Tantras listed by the PLSS as belonging to the Daksinasroias.There are three Tantras we notice here in this list that we know to beTrikatantras, namely, the Tristram (called \"Trisirobhairava\"ox \"Tri§iromata ftin Kashmir), the Nisisamcdra and the Siddhayogesvaram (or Siddhayogesvarimata).251 Their presence in this list establishes that these Tantras are old membersof the Saivagama. If we accept that these are amongst the Daksinatantras whichexisted at the time of the compilation of the Siddhantagamas, there are goodgrounds to argue that they are older than some of them, at least. Thus, ittranspires that Tantras teaching Trika doctrine and ritual already existed atthe time of the formation of the Siddhanta as a coherent group of Saivagamas,Moreover, it may also be argued, in broader terms, that the Siddhanta's notionof itself as a group presupposes the existence of an older classification intofour divisions to which it has added itself as an upper fifth. This is astandard pattern of development of the canon as we shall have occasion toobserve again when we come to deal with the amnaya division of the Kulatantrasand the place of the Pascimamnaya in it.The Pitha System of ClassificationThe word \"pitha, \" in a non-technical sense, means a stool, seat or bench and,by extension, the pedestal upon which an idol is installed. In the Tantras itcommonly means a sacred place. In this present context, however, it means a\"collection,\" or \"aggregate\" (samuha) with reference to a group of scriptures252 and so denotes a class of Agamas. It also signifies a range of matters that,taken collectively, concern a single Tantric topic. The two usages of the wordare closely related: sometimes one applies, sometimes the other and,occasionally, both. In order to understand how the pitha system ofclassification works, we should first distinguish these two uses of the word. Inorder to do so, before we attempt to outline the contents of the pfthasunderstood as categories of scriptures, let us see what pitha means as a Tantrictopic.There are four pithas, namely, Vidya, Mantra, Mudraand Mandala-pitha. Accordingto the BY, Tantras that concern themselves with one or other of these topicsbelong to the corresponding p///?^. 253 Abhinavaadds that, insofar as theessential contents of the Tantras are basically the same,The Saiva Agamasthe ascription of a particular Tantra to one or other of the pifhas indicatesthe most dominant feature of its contents. In this sense, therefore, one can saythat each pitha contains all the others. 254 Thus the manclalapifha is a topicconsidered separately in its own right in the SYM, 255 and mudra-pithadhikara isthe name of chapter 52 of the BY, although both Tantras belong to the Vidyapifha256 Similarly, in the Tantraloka, Abhinaya deals with the basic Mantras,Mandates and Mudras of Trika Saivisrn individually in chapters 30, 31 and 32respectively.In this way the pifha division can serve as a device by which a Tantra, althoughformally affiliated to one or other pitha, could say that it contains in itselfthe essential doctrines of all the other Tantras because it deals with all thesematters. So we find that some Tantras, like the Svacchanda, claim that theyconsist of all four pithas and bestow the fruits of them all. 257 We notice thissame claim being made in the Pascimatantras. We are told that another name forthe goddess Kubjika is \"Samaya\" the feminine form of the word \"samaya\" whichmeans rule. As such, she is the Rule that is observed equally in both theTantras of the Left and Right as well as in all four pithas™* As Kuntfalinh sheis the essence of the Kaula tradition and so the same 'rule' which prevails inall the pithas™ We do, in fact, come across references to matter drawn fromvarious pithas in the PaScima-tantras. Thus, for example, the Kularatnoddyotacontains Mantras described as belonging to the Mantrapifha 2 ^ Again, the KMTexplains that the Mudrapifha is characterized by the joining of the two handsflat together. The left hand symbolizes creation (srsfi) and the right,destruction (samhara). The union of the two is the 'Kuntfalini of the Self whichis the Supreme Power, the primordial energy 'Beyond Mind' Qnanonmani). It is theSupreme Gesture (mudra) that brings about universal pervasion, and he who knowsit, knows the entire universe. When the hands are joined, the emissive power ofconsciousness {visarga-sakti) rises up out of the genital region and comes toreside in the foundation of this Gesture by uniting creation and destruction.261The pitha classification served an important function in the formation of theSaivagamic canon. Affiliated through this system of classification, Tantras nototherwise related could belong together in a group which expressed the coherenceof the basic principles they taught. Affiliation to a pitha was a sign of analignment not of schools or traditions, but of practice and application ofmethod. Thus Rupasiva in his commentary called \"Vidhana\" on theManthdnabhairavatantra which is the root collection (muiasangraha) of thedoctrines of the Kubjika school, associates the antinomian behaviour prescribedin Kulacara with the Mudrapifha 262 Parts of the Kaula ritual (kulaprakriya)described by Abhinavagupta in chapter 29 of the Tantraloka are ascribed to twoTantras of the Four Pifhas51traditions (sampradayd), one linked to the Mantra md Mudra pithas and the otherto the Vidya and Mandala pifhas, 26 * The rituals relating to all four pithasare described here because, Jayaratha tells us, the scripture in this context isof these four types, 264 Presumably what Jayaratha means here is that the pithaclassification includes all the Saivaga ma although it refers in a special wayto that part of it which is Kaula-oriented. Accordingly, in a short tractdealing with Kaula yoga called \"Yogapifha, \"of which there are early manuscriptsin Nepal, 265 the Lord of Kula is adored at the beginning as the consort of thegoddess who is the presiding deity of the four pifhas. 266 It appears,therefore, that in some important aspects the pitha classification became thefocus of a new and higher understanding that an important part of the Saivagamahad of itself as Kaula-oriented, At the same time it allowed for the existencewithin this broad system of categorization for the existence of scriptures whichdid not expressly consider themselves to be Kaula as such and so served to linkthe two.The Tantras of the Four PifhasWe turn now to the second aspect of the pitha classification, namely, \"pijha ffunderstood as a category of scripture. The BY makes use of this system ofclassification, integrating it somewhat awkwardly with a division of thescriptures into Left, Right and Middle currents. The BY's account of the pithasis sketchy and unsystematic—a sign that this system of classification is stillat an early stage in its development. In the JY, on the other hand, the pithaclassification is well worked out and the contents of each pifha clearlydefined. Indeed, it has developed to such a degree that it has superseded thedivision into srotas, which is relegated to the level of a secondary, subsidiaryclassification, A detailed account of the JY's description of the contents ofeach pifha is found in appendix C, to which the reader is referred, Here weshall deal with the basic structure of these pifhas and how they are related toeach other and to other systems of classification.It appears that the Vidyapifha was the most extensive and important of the fourpifhas. Abhinava considered this pifha to be the highest, after which comes theMantrapifha sustained by it. 267 Again, the Mudra division follows the path ofMantra 26S and is said to be its reproduced image (pratikfti), 269 while theMandalapitha is the lowest. 270 This is also the order in which they are gradedin the BY. The JY deals with the Mantrapifha first although the contents of theVidyapifha are more extensive.The Saiva AgamasThe plthas are also generally linked together in pairs. The BY treats the Vidyaand Mantra pifhas together and similarly considers the Mudra and Man$alapliha tobe a pair. 271 This agrees with Abhinava's exposition of the division of theplfhas found in the Anandasasira which states:'Pitha' [is a term referring] to a class [of Tantras]. It is of two types: rightand left, called Mantra and Vidya respectively, from which are derived the twoassociated with Mudra and Ma$4ala? nAccordingly, we can represent the four plthas schematically as follows. SeeFigure 1.Figure 1* The Four Plihas.EastMudrapiihaNorth Vidyapitha--Mantrapitha SouthMaijddtepiiha WestThe Mudra and Mandala plihas seem to have been the least well defined of thefour plthas. The BY enumerates the Tantras of the Vidya— and Mantra—piihas asbelonging to the current of the Right but then simply states that the other twopifhas include all the Mudras and Martdalas of the Tantras in all the currentsof scripture. 273 Similarly, the JY refers to only one root Tantra in theMartdalapifha and then simply states that this pitha is part of the contents ofall the pifhas. The Mudrapltha contains only three root Tantras of which one isthe Kubjikamata. 274 The Mantra and Vidya pifhas are thus generally consideredto be the most important pair and we shall therefore limit our discussion tothem.MantrapifhaThe Mantrapitha53We start with the Mantrapitha because it is less extensive than the Vidyapithaand is a more compact category. The BY lists seven Tantras belonging to thispitha: Vira t {Ugra?) Bhairava, Caridabhairava, Gudaka, Bhairavi (?), Mahavireiaand Bhairava. 215 The BY appears to be uncertain of the contents of this pitha.It lists two titles that are virtually the same (i.e., Vlra and Mahavireka\\ andtwo entries— Bhairava and Bhairavi— seem to be incomplete. That theCarttfabhairavalantra is listed here is significant because this Tantra usuallybelongs to the standard group of eight Bhairavatantras, namely, theBhairavasfaka we have already discussed. In fact, it is this group that in theJY comes to constitute the Mantrapitha. According to the Sarvaviraiantra, fourof these Tantras belong to the Mantrapifha, namely the Svacchanda, Carina,Krodha and Unmatta? 16 Ksemaraja thinks that the Svacchandatanira belongs tothis pitha and quotes the Sarvavira as an authority to support this view. 277The Svacchanda itself, incidentally, nowhere aligns itself specifically with anypitha although it knows this system of classification. 278 The JY quotes theSarvavira 2n and appears to take the lead from this Tantra in its exposition ofthis pitha. Thus the J Y takes the four Tantras mentioned above as the mainTantras of this pifha and links them systematically with the remaining fourTantras in the group of eight Bhairavatantras thus;If we place the right-hand column below the left, we have the eightBhairavatantras in the order in which the JY enumerates them. It seems,therefore, that we can trace a line of development here from the BY through theSarvavira to the JY. These Tantras must, therefore, also succeed each otherchronologically.The VidyapithaThe Vidyapifha, as the JY presents it, virtually contains the three■.fvV54The Saiva AgamasVidyapiiha55currents of scripture, viz., Left, Right and Middle. The JY has, however,rearranged their contents. The Siddhaniagamas have been entirely excluded fromthe pitha classification. 280 Therefore, the Middle Current is now vacant and anew category is created to take its place, namely, the Saktitaniras. However,this is just a new name for old familiar Tantras amongst which are theSiddhayogesvarimata, the Sarvavira and the JY itself. It is worth noting thatthe SYM is regularly assigned to this^/Aa. The BY does so and Abhinava tells usthat it is this pitha which dominates in this, the root Trika Tantra, and hencealso in the Malinivijaya, which presents the essentials of the former. 281 Infact, the SYM itself tells us that it belongs to the Vidyapiiha?* 1The BY locates the Vidya and Mantra pitha in the current of the Right 283 whilethe J Y extends the Vidyapiiha to include the Tantras of the Left amongst whichare the Mahasammohana and Nayoiiara^ Although the Vinasikha is not amongst themajor Tantras, it may be the Sikhatantra listed as one of the secondary Tantrasassociated with the Sarnmohana? u The Right Current of the Vidyapiiha consistsof the Yamalas amongst which the BY is considered to be the most important. TheJY thus allots a major category to the Yamalas and they are, as we have alreadyhad occasion to remark, treated at times as a category on their own. The Tamilpoem, the Takkayagapparani by Oitakkuttar written in the twelfth century,frequently refers to the \" Yamata&stra,\" According to this work there areninety-one secondary Yamalas and Tantras associated with the main Yamalas ofwhich one of the most important is the B Y?* s It is indeed an extensive andinteresting work which deserves to be edited and care-fully studied.The Mantra and Vidya pifhas are closely related, so much so that Jayaratha saysthat they stand for Siva and Sakti. 286 Similarly, the JY states that theMantrapUha is associated with masculine words and the Vidyapiiha with feminineones, 287 Perhaps we can understand this to mean that the Tantras in the formergroup are more Siva-oriented than those belonging to the latter. TheSvaechandatanira, which is said to belong to the Mantrapitha, is indeed markedlymore 'Saiva* than the Siddha-yogeivarimata of the Vidyapiiha which is more*Sakta\\ Moreover, Abhinava's statement that the Vidyapiiha sustains andstrengthens the MantrapUha m is exemplified in the context of the Trika exegesisof Saiva scripture by the secondary and yet vitally important place given to theSvacchandatantra which supplies, amongst other things, along with theMalinivijaya, the cosmology of the Trika.In Kashmiri circles the Vidyapiiha was considered to be the most important ofthe pifhas. Abhinava quotes the Kularatnamalatantra to say that Trika, as aKaula school which embodies the essence of the doctrinesof the Tantras of the Left and the Right currents, is superior to them all 289He does this immediately after he has extolled the superiority of theVidyapiiha, implying perhaps in this way that Trika as a whole belongs to thispitha. Thus Abhinava exalts the Vidyapiiha as the ultimate essence of the otherpifhas by stating, on the authority of the Anandasastra, that all the pifhasultimately derive from the Vidyapifha in such a way that, as Jayaratha puts it:\"there is only one pifha which is of the nature of them all.***The Vidyapiiha is also important in Nepal. Most of the Tantras preserved there,which affiliate themselves to a pitha, belong to this one. Amongst them are twotexts which represent themselves as elucidating the essentials of the doctrinesof this pitha. One is called \"Vidyapifha\"and is quite short 291 while the other,the Srividyapifhamatasara, claims to be 12,000 verses long. 292 The Vidyapiihaand its importance in Nepal is particularly relevant to our present studybecause major Tantras of the Kubjika cult affiliate themselves to it. TheManthanabhairavatantra, which is amongst the most important Tantras of thisschool, belongs to this pitha 292 and tells us that the goddess of thistradition resides in it. 294 Certain manuscripts of the KMT bear long colophonsthat are very similar in form and content to those of the MBT and include areference to the affiliation of the KMT to the VidyapUha, As these colophons arenot uniform in all the manuscripts, it is hard to say on the basis of thisevidence alone whether the KMT did, in fact, originally affiliate itself to thispifha. Although, as we have noted above, the KMTdoes consider its doctrines tobe the essential teachings of all these pifhas? 95 it does not expressly saythat it belongs to any pifha, Possibly the JY is right to assign it to theMudra-pUha. If this is so, it appears that later tradition shifted the KMT'saffiliation to the VidyapUha. Anyhow, many later Tantras of the Kubjika cultmost certainly do belong to this pitha. Thus the Srimatottaratantra which isconsidered to be a direct successor of the KMT (which is also called Srimata) isa Vidydpithatantra? 96 and so is a Tantra closely associated with it, namely,the Kadibheda of the Gorakjasamhita? 91To conclude the first part of this monograph, let us recall what K. C Pandeywrote more than three decades ago concerning Saivagamic studies: \"How can anycorrect conclusion be possible unless all of (the Agamas) or at least arespectable number of them be carefully read?\" 298 Indeed, we cannot say muchabout the structure, history and form of the Saiva canon without having accessto, and carefully studying, the extant material in manuscripts which, although atiny fraction of this vast corpus of sacred literature, is vast in itself. Thisis a major area of Indology which has, sadly, not even gone past the stage ofpreliminary assessment.Part TwoThe Kaula TantrasThe Kulagama_ The Kaulatantras belong to such an extensive and important category of Agamicscripture that they can be considered to constitute a corpus in their own rightwhich we can conveniently label \"Kulagama\". But although, as we shall see in thefollowing pages, the Kulagama can be treated as an independent unit with its ownsubdivisions and internal distinctions, its link with the greater Agamic corpusis very close and consistently maintained. Thus, the Kaulatantras considerthemselves to be essentially Saiva and venerate Bhairavaasthe highest God. lMoreover, many Kaulatantras are not only affiliated to their own Kaula groupsbut also have a specific place of their own in the greater Saiva canon, usuallyas members of the Bhairavasrotas, Even so, one of the most striking features ofthese Tantras is their markedly Sakta character. Indeed, Kaula traditions aresometimes distinguished from one another, and their Tantras classified,according to the goddess who is at the focus of their complex Tantric system ofMantras, rituals and yogic practice,Kaula rites are generally private and, ideally, performed in secluded placessuch as lonely forests, mountains, deserts, cremation grounds or sacred centreswhere adepts, male and female \"{siddhas and yoginis), traditionally assemble.The deity worshipped is often (but not always) fearsome and adored withofferings of meat (including at times beef and human flesh) and wine as well asthe male and female sexual fluids (kunclagolaka) produced during ritualintercourse. The deity may be invoked to take possession of the worshipper sothat he can gain its awesome power through which he perceives the deity'spervasive presence (vyapti) in all things. Many practices such as this one aredesigned to be fearful (bhayavaha); others, and these were particularlyimportant for the refined Kashmiri Trika Kaula, are meant to delight the sensesand mind (sukhavaha). The sacrificial offerings and ritual, in this case, inducethe emergence of the innate bliss of consciousness (ananda). This inner,spiritual joy is cultivated as the adept's consciousness unfolds until he laysThe Kaula Tantrashold of his own innate nature (svasvabhava), when consciousness reaches its mostfully expanded state (purnavikasay This process, therefore, entails a change inthe modality of the adept's consciousness which takes place by the actualizationof the latent inner spiritual power technically called \"Kuntfalinl \" WhenKundatini awakens, it rises in the form of the Upward Moving Breath(udanapraria), penetrating, as it does so, through successive levels of thecosmic order homologized to the microcosm of the adept's body. Finally, itmerges, in the form of the vitality of the vital breath (pranasakti) and Mantra(mantravlrya), into the universal breath (pranana) and divine resonance ofconsciousness in the highest state of bliss, to then permeate all the lowerlevels it traversed in its ascent. In this way the delight of the senses becomesa means to liberation: one who is on the Kaula path drinks wine, eats meat andperforms ritual intercourse in order to make the innate bliss of his own naturemanifest—not out of greedor lust. 2The bliss the Kaula experiences is entirely spiritual and not at all worldly.The Kaula savours the objects of the senses not just for his pleasure but to useth£s pleasure to make consciousness more fully manifest and in so doing unite itwith its object. When Kundalini rises, the fettered soul is elevated out of hisstate of bondage (pasutva) in which the experience of sensory objects depriveshim of his authentic subjectivity and so becomes, like a sacrificial beast{pasu\\ a helpless victim of the forces of his own contracted consciousness.Accordingly, some Kaula traditions advocated symbolic substitutes for the meat,wine and sex, declaring that the essential point of Kaula practice is thearousal of Kuna'alin! and the expansion of consciousness. The followers of theseKaula schools were, however, condemned by others such as the Kashmiri TrikaKaulas who, possibly closer to the original spirit of Kaula doctrine, insistedthat these were essential and hence irreplaceable elements of Kaula ritual. 3The flow of Kwdaiini up through the lower levels, reabsorbing them as it goesinto their ultimate source—the Nameless {anamaka) absolute Beyond Mind (unmana),and its return back down, recreating as it does so all the lower levels nowexperienced as one with consciousness, constitute the sequence of absorptionarid emanation (satrihara- and smikrama) which are the two aspects of thedynamic power of consciousness, here called Kula. 4 At the same time, as thepure consciousness which is the innate nature of all things and their universalcause, it is the source of this flow and the abode of rest where it reposes. 5As such, it is said to be the Supreme Bliss of one's own essential nature, 6This authentic Being is Akula—the male principle, while his cosmic outpouring(visarga) is Kula, his divine power—Sakti, the female principle. 7 These two areworshipped as Kulesvarl and Kulesvara. The union of these two principles—KulaandKulagama61Akula^is called the Supreme Kaula (param kaulam) which is both at rest in itself(fanta) as well as rising out of itself (udita) in the form of its cosmicmanifestation. Both these, Kula and Akula, are combined in Kaula doctrine.* Thephilosophical standpoint of the Kaulatantras and that of their exegetes isessentially momst Ultimate reality is Kaula—the fusion of opposites in whichsubject and object are united in the unfolding of consciousness which expandsout into itself to assume the form of its universal manifestation.^ This realitycan be realized by the performance of Kaula ritual without succumbing to doubt(sartka), 10 that is to say, in a state of consciousness free ofthought-constructs (nirvikalpa) in which the opposites, particularly thedichotomy of pure and impure, prohibition and injunction, are transcended.Kaula doctrine and practice is not confined exclusively to those Tantras whichexplicitly consider themselves to be Kaula: it is an important element of otherTantras as well—particularly those of the Varna and Daksinasrotas with which theKaulatantras are closely related. Kula doctrine originates in these two currentsof scripture and so is said to flow from them and extend them at their furthestlimit.» i At the same time, it is present in all the Saiva scriptures, pervadingthem as their finest and most subtle element, like the perfume in flowers, tastein water or the life in the body, 12 In fact, the expression \"Kaula\" can be usedto refer to a typology of practice outlined in the Tantras as a whole, as wellas to an identifiable part of them which is sometimes even specifically said tobe such by the Tantras themselves. Thus the Netraiantra describes the worship ofSadasiva, Tumburu and Bhairava in three separate chapters as representative ofthe three Saivasrotas, while the Kulamnaya is treated separately in a chapter onits own. 13 This chapter, according to Ksemaraja, deals with Kuiamnayadarsana 14which he says is the \"undivided essence of the upper, left and right currents,\"15 Although the NT deals with Kaula ritual separately in a category of its own,this does not mean that the Kaula tradition is a newcomer whose Tantras need tobe somehow accommodated into an older, already well-defined corpus, 16 for wecome across references to Kaula schools already in the Siddhantdgamas asdistinct groups alongside the Saivagama. 17 The Kaula traditions were, in asense, set apart from other Agamic schools due to their strictly esotericcharacter. As a Saivite one could be initiated into Kaula practice, althoughthis was to be kept as secret as was one's own Kaula identity. 18 In fact,Kutaiastra seems to have been developing alongside the Tantric schools of theSaivagama from an early period, influencing them while being influenced by them.It made sense, therefore, in view of this close symbiosis, that Kaula ritesshould find a place in Tantras which did not consider themselves to bespecifically Kaula. We observe this phenomenonThe Kaula Tantrasparticularly in the Varna and Bhairavatantras, while the Siddhanta, on thecontrary, is virtually free of this Kaula element. An instance of theapplication and integration of this important dimension of the Varna, and moreparticularly of the Bhairavatantras, led to the development of Kashmiri Trikawhich, even though it originated in the Daksinasrotas, came to think of itselfas Kaula.Kula schools seem to have proliferated to an astonishing degree.* The number ofKulas were so many that they are referred to in juxtaposition with the Tantrasof the Saivagama as if the Kulas were as numerous as the Tantras themselves. 20In this context, \"Kula\" meant a line of transmission (santati) from master todisciple or a tradition (sampradaya) 2] that was handed down in small monasticcentres (mathika) and so was also called \"mathika.™ The Tantraloka records oneof the basic patterns of classification of these Kaula traditions, namely, theSiddhakrama (or Siddhasantati) originally established by four Kaula masters,each said to have been incarnated in one of the four Ages (yuga). They are, indue order: Khagendranatha, Kurmanatha, Mesanatha and Matsyendranatha. 23 Each ofthese teachers had consorts while the last couple gave birth to (or initiated)twelve 'princes* of whom six were fit to impart Kaula doctrine and founded sixdistinct Kaulatraditions, 24Following another system of classification, Jayaratha distinguishes between fourbasic types: Mahakaula, Kaula, Akula and Kulakula 2 ^ A more common distinctionis that made between Kula and Kaula, which the Ni&sancara and Bhairavakulatantraconsider to be of ascending order of importance, with Trika as superior to both.26 The Pascimamnaya also recognizes the distinction between Kula and Kaula andthinks of itself as separate from both. 27 At the same time, it considers itselfto be a Saiva (sambhava) tradition which combines both Kula and Kaula. 28 Inthis tradition, both the male and female principle are worshipped, and so it isKaula and leads to the blissful experience of both Siva and Sakti. 29 What thismeans, apparently, is that the Pascimamnaya is closely associated with theSaivagama although its roots are in the Kula tradition, emerging as it does asboth Kula and Kaula. 30 Thus this tradition can say, without contradiction, thatit is equally Kula as well as Kaula. 31This Kula/ Kaula school is said to be of six kinds. 32 These six are listed inthe Kularatnoddyota as follows: ananda, avati, prabhu, yaugika t atita and pada,which correspond to the Kaula traditions established by the six princesgenerated from Matsyendranatha. 33 The grouping together of these traditions{santati) is one of the many features the Pascimamnaya shares in common with theTrika (see below). The Kaula schools generally set themselves apart from oneanother 34 but the Pascimamnaya, like theMouth of the Yogini63Trika, prides itself in being higher than other Kaula schools because itincludes them all within itself and does not make unnecesssary distinctionsbetween them, although, of course, it maintains its own independent existence asa sastra to be followed without resorting to others. 35The Mouth of the YoginiA characteristic feature of all Kaula traditions is that they considerthemselves to be originally oral transmissions imparted in secret, 36 and thePascimamnaya is no exception. 37 The master imparted the teaching to thedisciple who proved his worth, for it was felt that only in this way could thetradition be preserved and protected from the insincere. It is certainly true,as Abhinavagupta says, that there is a limit to what can be written and learnedin books; 33 the master is not, however, merely a source of extra informationthat cannot be found in the scriptures or simply a man who knows how to deciphertheir codes or interpret their subtle meanings. He is above all the vehiclethrough which the hidden power of their teachings is transmitted. He is the onewho imparts the initiation which marks his disciple's entry into a newexistential condition in which he is on the path to liberation, training himselfthrough the grace of the deity (embodied in the master) to attain theenlightened state his master reached before him and thus perpetuate thetransmission of the teachings. His constant companions and supports along hisjourney are the Mantras he was taught when, during his initiation, he made thistransition. Full of the vital, living power of consciousness, Mantras can onlybe effective if imparted directly, properly intoned by one who has activatedtheir hidden energy in his own consciousness. Written Mantras are powerless; 39they are as ineffective as lines drawn on water. 40 Equally useless is any otherspiritual practice learned from the dead letter of the written word. Thus thePascimamnaya lays particular stress on the importance of the master. He is thesole essential element 41 of this, the \"Tradition of the Master\" (gurvamnaya) 42, also known as that of the \"Mouth of the Master,\" 43 It is here that spiritualknowledge and Mantra reside, by virtue of which he is the Lord of thePascimamnaya. 44In the Pascimamnaya, as in all Kaula traditions in general, women are thought tohave a special role to play as the transmitters of Kaula doctrine for, as thesaying goes, \"one should place wisdom in the mouth of a woman and take it againfrom her lips.\" 45 She is the master's Tantric consort {duti) who, like themaster, instructs the disciple and so is to be respected as hisThe Kaula Tantraseaualinevery way. 44 Shecanalso be the unattached yoginiencountered by Zl^tl^l)who, in search of yogic accomplishment wanders on pilgrimage to the sacredplaces of the Kaulas where meetings take place «ufLherthatthewisdomofthetraditioniskarnedandhowhentualsshould be performed.

The Siddhakaula is similarly originally derived from Saivadoctrine but is transmitted by Siddhas, the male counterparts of the yoginls. 60These two categories are well known in the Kaulatamras and are vitally connectedwith each other. In the Kaula-jnananimaya, Matsyendranatha figures as thefounder of the Yoginikula tradition which is especially associated with thefabulous land of Kamarupa, 61 although he himself seems to have belonged to theSiddha, or Siddhamrtakaula. 61 That Kaulatamras did, in fact, reflect onthemselves as belonging to one or other of these two broad categories transpiresfrom the characterization of the Urmikaulatantra&s belonging to theSiddhasaniana transmitted through one of its branches. 63 The Yoginikula ismentioned in a work quoted by Jayaratha, 64 The typifying characterization ofthese two classes by the KMT of the Pascimamnaya is essentially the same as thatfound in the Siddhantagama referred to above> 5 The Pascimamnaya, consistentwith its characterization of Kula doctrine as the tradition which expounds theessence of the teachings of the Yogini, 66 considered itself to be the traditionof the yoginis (yoginikramaf 1 and the secret of their oral transmission, 6SEven so, Pascima doctrine is considered to be that of Siddhas of thePascimamnaya 69 and is not to be revealed to those who do not belong to theSiddhakaula school™ There are places, however, where the Yoginikula is made toappear to be a part of the Pascimamnaya J [ Again, Kubjika, the presiding deity,is Kurujatini, which is the essential teaching of the Yoginikula, Thus amongstthe Kaula traditions originating from the sacred places ipifhas), thePascimamnaya presents the most vital doctrine of all the Kaula tradition 72—including the Yoginikaula, At its highest level, however, the PaScimamnayaagrees with the Yoginikula that the ultimate object of devotion is Siva (herecalled Sambhu), He is the abode of the Sambhava state and as such the SupremePlace that, although beyond all characterization, bestows infinite qualities. Itis where all practice ceases and all things appear immediately present directlybefore the yogi. 73The Kaula TantrasThe Amnaya Classification\"Srotas\" is the term generally used to refer to the major groupings of thescriptures of the Saivagamas when fitted into a pattern of directionalcontrasts. Similarly, the term <<amnaya\"is used to denote distinct groups ofscriptures within the Kulagama, each consisting of Tantras that share a commonaffiliation to a single tradition and said to have onginatefrem a fixeddirection. Our best example is the Paiamamnaya itself^the 'Western Tradition'.The amnaya system of classification did not include all the Kaulatantras. We aretold in the texts of the existence of many Kula ^aj;^n the sense of<t^^they belong to any systematic classification. It is in this broad, generic sensethat we occasionally come across this term in the Siddhantagama.\" Indeed«Kulamnaya\"is a common way of referring to the Kulatantrasw a whole; it issynonymous, in other words, with \"Kulasastra or Kula,fasana\" in general 75 , ,The amnaya system of classification is nowhere discussed by Abhinavagupta, Thisfact seems, at first sight, to indicate that the classification of Kulawntras(or at least of a part of them) as groups belonging to fixed directions (on theanalogy of the Siddhanta classification) was a late development Thus Tantrassuch as the^7^\" Nisisamcara which thought of themselves as being Tnka»« dividedthe Saivagama into three main groups: Siddhanta, Varna znd Daksw*Mtdistinguishing these from Kula and Kaula of which Tnka was considered to be theculmination. They do not refer to the amnaya classification and so presumablyfollowing their lead, neither does Abhinavagupta. Perhaps therefore, we shouldnot immediately assume that the amnaya classification postdates Abhinavagupta.Indeed, there is positive evidence which leads one to suppose that it did not.The KMT, which is generally considered to be the oldest recovered work of thePascimamnaya^ postdates the Siddhayogesvarimata to which it refers specificallyas the Tantra where the goddess Siddhayogesvart is exalted ™ Even so, as one ofthe sixty-four Tantras listed in the NSA, it can certainly be claimed to beprior to the ninth century (see above p. 48). Moreover, as noted above,Abhinavagupta himself refers to the KMT™ while it specifically considers itselfto be -the Path of the Pascimamnaya^ and also knows of the Uttarar andDaksina-Smnayas which it respects as teaching valid doctrines* It seems also, inone place at least, to refer to the PurvamnayaV Nor is it justifiable to supposethat this classification is peculiar to the Tantras of the Kubjika school as weshall see in the following exposition of the amnayas.Amnayas of the Kaula tantras 67The Amnayas of the KaulatantrasThe division into amnayas seems to have been originally into four, with eachamnaya symbolically set in one of the four directions. We have seen that the KMTknows only of four. The Yogakhaqdaoi the MBTalso refers to only four amnayaswhere they have a more tangible identity, S3 They are represented ascorresponding to the four Ages (yuga)> with the Pascimamnaya as that which ismost fit for the present Kali Age. 84 In the SatSS the amnayas are said invarious places to be either five, six or even seven. The fivc-amnaya division isequated with the five vital breaths in such a way that the Pascimamnayacorresponds to the Pervasive Breath {vyana\\ the experience of which is theuniversal pervasion of consciousness to which the teaching leads. 85 Thedivision into five amnayas (formed by adding an upper one to the original four)is at times represented as spoken by the five faces of Sadasiva, following thebasic Siddhanta pattern. The six-fold scheme can be formed by adding a sixthupper current \"beyond the upper\" {urdhvordhva), although a division into six isalso possible by adding a lower current, an example of which we have alreadynoted in relation to the five-fold Siddhanta pattern with Kula as the sixth. 86The former alternative is found in Trikatantras like the Bhargasikha where Trikais located above the Upper Face which is that of Isana* 1The four-fold division appears to be the oldest. This supposition is confirmedby the Kularnavatantra which characterizes the secret of the \"secrets moresecret than secret\" (rahasydtirahasya) of its own Kaula doctrines as anuppcr-amnaya^ situated above the four amnayas to which the many Kaula traditionsbelong that are \"known to many.\" 89 These five are here said to be spoken bySiva. The Samketapaddhati, an early Kaula text, 90 refers to just four amnayas,^A four-fold division which, as in the Samketapaddhati, is equated with fourmetaphysical moments in the dynamics of ultimate reality, represented as aspectsof the power Speech (bharatisakti) which issues from the four faces of the\"beginningless Mother\"—Mahavidya, is found in Amrtananda's Saubhagyasudhodayawhich he quotes in his commentary on the YoginihrdayaJ* 1An account of the spirituality and history of the four amnayas, from thePascimamnaya point of view, is recorded in a short but interesting work calledthe Cincinimatasarasamuccaya. All the manuscripts of this text located up to noware found in Nepal.* 3 The CMSS claims that it belongs to the Divyaugha and is acompendium or essence of the Supreme Kaula doctrine of the Siddha tradition.* 4It also implicitly identifies itself with a type of Tantric work common in theearlier period (i.e., prior to theThe Kaula Tantraseleventh century), namely, a Sarasastra, by referring to a number of otherTantras of this type in its introductory section, 95 while affirming that itpresents the essence (sard) of the Kubjikamata. The four amnayas (here variouslycalled vesman grha or ghara)™ are presented as originating from the Pascimamnayawhich is the \"Source Tradition\" (janmamnaya) that possesses them all« Similarly,the MBT also says of it that it clearly manifests the four amnayas, theknowledge of which gives rise to the Divine Tradition (divyamnaya) and so is thehighest of them « The Pascimamnaya is where all the sequences of inner mysticalstates of the other three amnayas, once abandoned and transcended, ultimatelymerge » As such, it is equated with the pure thought-free consciousness of theSambhava state-Siva's inner experience of himself which pervades all the Kaulatraditions. Thus, because it is also essentially Suva, 100 it is their ultimategoal, embracing as it does both Kula and Akula-Sakti and Siva.\"\" So, pure in allrespects, and free of both virtue and vice (dharma and adharma), thePascimamnaya is above all the other amnayas.™Let us see then what the CMSS has to say about the Purva, Daksina and Uttaraamnaya, after which we shall present our analysis of its views, to conclude witha short account of the Pascimamnaya.The Amnaya Classification and the Four Amnayas According to theCincinimatasarasamuccayaPurvamnayaThis amnaya is described as the Yoginimatasara present in both Kula and Kaula.The goddess manifests here in the form of the bliss of one's own consciousness.This tradition teaches the best Kulacara, namely, the manner in which Kulaemerges in the womb of Kula. Thus, the goddess of this amnaya is Kulesvarl who\"devours the Kumarikula.\" This tradition transmits the consciousness whichpervades the Sky of transcendental reality and through it Trika was brought intothis world. Trika doctrine is here embodied as Trika the goddess of three-foldform who is the Mistress of the Three Worlds (Tribhuvanesvart). Trikamathika isdivided into three lines of transmission, each associated with a Kulaguru towhich is added a fourth-Khagendranatha-~who belongs to Vyomardhamathtka. SeeFigure 2.Four Amnayas 69Figure 2. The Transmission of Trikamathika According to the CMSS.Khagendranatha (Vyomardhamathika)The goddess emerges from the centre of reality along with Paramanandabhairava.The whole universe is instructed by this power which is the paramount knowledgeof the Divine Transmission (divyaugha). This maihika is that of the line ofSiddhas known as the Tradition of the Elders (vrddhavalli). It is in thistradition that Siddha-natha incarnated in this world during each of the fourAges (yuga) as a Kaula master, as follows:First Yuga DisciplesSecond Yuga DisciplesThird Yuga DisciplesKhagendranatha and Vijahutl Vimala, SusobhaKurmanatha and MangalajyotI Ajita, VijitaMe§anatha and KamangaKhakula nathaMore than sixty-four KulasFourth YugaTo this Fourth Yuga belongs the Tradition of Orp (Orpvalli) founded byMlnanatha, also called Pingalanatha, who obtained the knowledge of the Kulamstrawhich was thrown into the ocean by Karttikeya, His-*-—-■Four Amnayas71consort was the princess Kumkuma from whom were born twelve princes; six ofthese were: Bhadra, Amarapada, Mahendra, Khagendra, Mahldhara and Gundikanatha.These princes were said to have no authority to teach, while the six others,listed below, did teach and were the founders of six traditions (ovatli). Theyare each associated with a pitha, a town and a forest where they practicedausterities for a varying number of years according to the instructions of amaster. This data is listed schematically opposite page:DaksinamnayaKamesvari descends into this amnaya. She arises from the three pithas andresides in their centre, pleasing to behold as the early morning sun and yetbrilliant like a hundred million lightning flashes. She is the Passionate One,full of the passion (Kama) which devours Kumarlkula desirous of herself,KameSvarl descends into the world in the form of a young virgin {kumari). Shemelts the Circle of Birth of her own nature by her energy, and by the intent ofher own vitality fills it. She is Kulayogini of divine form, peaceful and pureas translucent crystal She has two arms, one face and three eyes and her waistis thin. She resides on the northern side of the Malinl Mountain behind which isa bower (gahvara) called the Place of the Nightingale. It is filled with wildganders, ducks and other birds of all sorts. Khecari, Bhucari, Siddha and SakinIreside there absorbed in meditation.There, in the Divine Circle of the Triangle, is located the cave called the Faceof the Moon in which resides the goddess, the virgin who is the flow of vitality(sukravahim). Siddhas, munis (including Krodhamuni) and ascetics practicedausterities there for thousands of years, until they became aged and emaciated.Their gaze was averted upwards, to the Inner Face until they saw the goddessSukra and thus attained the state of divine inebriation (ghurmyavastha) byvirtue of her divine splendour. Once the goddess had transmitted this divineknowledge to them, Kamadeva appeared before her in divine form and 'melted* bythe power of Kamesvari, Tlius the two became one and gave rise to the RudraCouple. The son born of this union was Kaulesa who taught this divine knowledge.In this amnaya, Kamesvari is described as the twelve-lettered Vidya, surroundedby twelve goddesses. Then come Vage&vari, Tripura, Vagabhava and Bhagamalinl whoare Kamesvarfs powers (prabhava). The Dak$i%amnaya is where all the Nityas comefrom.72 UttaramnayaThb Kaula TantrasThe energy which devours Kallkaulika manifests in this amndya. She is Kalesvanand practices Kaulacara, contains Kaula (kaulagarbha) is the arising of Kaulaand is Trikaula. She resides in the Centre of Birth (janmadharal This is theSupreme Tradition {paramdmndya), Divyaugha transmitted -from ear to ear.\" It isKalikakulakrama and is twelvefold taught by Krodharaja and called ActionlessKnowledge (niskriyajwna). From the centre of the sun (surya) emerges another Sun(ravi) which is the inner light that illumines the entire universe. It issurrounded by the rays of the Sun-goddess, Bhanavikaulim, also known asKaulesvan and Kulagahvarl. She is the rays of the Sun which shines in the centreof the sacrificial hearth of the Great Sky of the Ocean of Siva. The GreatMantra consisting of the sixty-four Bhairava wombs iyoni) arises and dissolveshere In the centre of the Hearth of the Sun (bhdnavikunda) is the Wheel ofDissolution which is one's own true nature {svasvabhavd). Destroying both Beingand Non-being, it is the Fire of Consciousness personified as the goddessKulakrsodarl. All this is the Supreme Brahman which is one s own nature(svasvabhdva).We are then told that Niskriyananda \"made manifest in the world this nectar ofKula spoken by the yogim\" and so revealed the Mahakallkrama, Vat text goes on todescribe its transmission to Vidyananda. Vidyananda practised yoga in the guiseof a Siddhasdbara. His residence was a cremation ground where he practised yogaat night and delighted m Kaula practice in the company of Siddhas and Vtras. Heworshipped the deity m a cave to the north of the Sivaplfha known as Srisaila,wishing to attain Actionless Knowledge (niskriyajnana). His devotion was sointense that Niskriyanandanatha finally transmitted to him by word of mouth thesecret of the Kalikakrama. This is called the Knowledge of the Lett (vamajnana)and the Sequence of Sixty-five Stages. It is the dawning of the Twelve-fold Kaliof Light (Prabhdkalf) in the Sky of Consciousness which arises there in theSequence which Annihilates Destruction (samharasamharakramaX so called becausethe goddess devours all things This, the Kdlikrama, is the flux of Kula and yetis beyond it. It is the Divine Upper Mandate that, fully risen, transcends themind as the emergence of consciousness that penetrates beyond every level ofconsciousness and the cosmic flux which it melts away with its rays. Thus theyogi drinks the incomparable nectar of immortality in the Supreme Sky ofconsciousness which unfolds spontaneously within him. This is the SupremeExuberance (parolldsa), the expansion (vikasa) of consciousness which unfolds asKauUnh the Kali of twelve aspects.Analysis73This is the expansion of the Wheel of Kali (Kallcakra), which is the Sun of Kulaand its Twelve Rays. This, the Sequence of the Sun (bhdnavikrama), is the lifeof every living being and illumines the mind as it rises in the Sky beyond theSky, intensely aflame and burning up the Three Worlds. As this tradition teachesin this way the secret of both immanent Kula and transcendent Akula, it iscalled Kuldkulamnaya. The twelve-fold goddess of this tradition is identifiedwith the powers symbolized by the twelve vowels and is called Malinl of theSequence of Exertion {udyogakramamdlini). The yogi who is truly established inhis own nature contemplates this Great Supreme {mahdkrama\\ the Kalikrama taughtby Niskriyanandanatha.The names of the Twelve Suns which dawn as aspects of the Kali of Light(Prabhdkdli) are said to be the secret of the Kaulikagama. They are: the Kali ofCreation (Srtfikdli), the Kali of Persistence {SihitikalT), the Kali ofDestruction {Sarnhdrakdlt), the Kali of Passion (Raktakdlt), the Good Kali{Sukali\\ the Kali of Control ( Yamakdli), the Kali of Death (Mrtyukali), theAuspicious Kali (Bhadrakali), the Kali of the Supreme Sun (Paramdrkakdli), theKali of the Great Sun {Mahdmdrtan4akdll), the Terrible Kali (Rudrakdli) and theGreat Kali (Mahakalf), Kumarl is worshipped in the centre of the circle of thesetwelve powers.AnalysisThis account of the amndyas is striking both for the richness of its expressionand the heights of the yogic experiences it conveys through the imposingvisionary symbolism of the Kaula traditions it presents. The CMSS is later thanthe KMT and differs from its doctrinal position in many respects due largely tothe development of Pascima doctrine (see below). Even so, this account is ofvalue to the historian of Kaula Tantra and the Pascimdmndya because of what ittells us about the character of these traditions and their relationship to thePascimdmndya. Particularly interesting from the latter point of view is theassignment of Trika to the Purvdmndya because of the close relationship that theTrika has with the Pascimdmndya— a point we shall deal with later whendiscussing how Pascima doctrine is built up and its historical antecedents. Weshall therefore refer to it last after discussing the Dak$ina- and XJtiaraamndyas.DaksinamnayaIt is clear from this account that the CMSS identifies the SrlvidyaThe Kaula Tantrastradition with the Dakjindmnaya, The presiding goddess of this amnayais Kamesvanwho, initially alone, unites with Kamadeva. This broadly corresponds to theunion of Kamesvan and Kamesvara in the centre of Srlcakra locked in the sexualembrace of Kamakala. Kamadeva is the god of the seed-syllable known as'Kamaraja* in the Srividya school. Amrtananda, a major earfy exponent of Snvidyadoctrine, clearly links this seed-syllable with the DaWnamnaya in just the sameway as does the CMSS. In his Saubhdgyasudhodaya, he characterizes the fouramnayas, along with their attendant features, as symbolic aspects of one of themost important Mantras of this school, namely, the Mantraraja. Each amnayacontributes to the construction of this Mantra by supplying one of itsseed-syllables. The seed-syllable 'Kamaraja* belongs to the Daksinamndya and isin the form of Rudra in union with his power, RudraoL Together they form acouple (ydmala). This seed-syllable is also linked to the Pascimdmndya as itsprotector. ™ The CMSS also refers to the other three seed-syllables along withTripura, as energies of the goddess KarnesvarL In the Srividya tradition theyare indeed found together in the innermost triangle of Srlcakra with Tripura inthe centre and Vage^vari, Vagbhava and Bhagamalim in the corners around her J 04Nor can there be any doubt about the Kaula character of the Srividya school. TheNSA describes the form of Srividya and her Mantra as rising in waves out of theinfinite ocean of Kula* 5 as if to express her Kaula origins. Indeed, she isexpressly said to be \"Kulavidya\" which is the Great Vidyaoftheyoginis, 106Accordingly, the Yoginihrdaya enjoins that she should be worshipped only bythose who practice Kulacara.™ The Goddess Tripura is young and comely. Her eyesslightly red with wine— the perfect archetype of the Kaula female partner. \">*Tripura is considered to be the greatest of the goddesses that preside over thephases of the cosmic cycles of time. These are the Nityas which the CMSS saysoriginated in the Daksinamndya. As Nitya, Tripura is Kula, the Supreme deity'ssovereign power. 109The NS A and YHr, the original Tantras of this school, never refer to the amnayasystem of classification. They do, however, talk about their own tradition asdivided into four currents which issue from four sacred centres {mahapiiha\\namely, Kamarupa, Mlandhara> PUrnagiri and 04iyana^ However, the commentators,supported by early sources, equate these with the four amnayas^ They alsoassociate the four Yuganathas with the amnaya* in a manner reminiscent of thePascima characterization of the amnayas as each belonging to one of the fourAges. This connection also brings into the Srividya tradition an essentialelement of all Kaula ritual, namely, the worship of the Yuganathas. Thus,Srividya is said by Vidyananda in his commentary on the NSA to be common to allAnalysis15the amnayas. He also says that it is particularly important in the Dakpndmndya,l]2 thus confirming that the allocation of Srividya to this quarter is notpeculiar to the CMSS. In fact, the presence of Srividya is apparent in theKubjikatantras. Thus, of Kubjika's three forms as a child, young and old woman,her young form is appropriately identified with the young and beautifulTripurasundari. 113UttaramnayaThe way in which this amnaya is described in the CMSS is of interest not only tothe historian of Kaula Tantra but also to the student of Kashmiri Saivism,particularly of that part of it which modern scholars call the Krama system,otherwise known as the Kramasdsana, Krama-dariana or Kramanaya in Kashmirisources as well as in the original Tantras themselves, 114 The focal point ofthe spirituality of the Uttaramnaya is here presented as the experience of theArising of the Sequence of Kalis {Kallkramodaya\\ us The manner of their arising,as well as the order and names of the Kalis in this account, is virtually thesame as we find in the Agamic passages quoted by Jayaratha in his commentary onAbhinava's exposition of the sequence of Kalis (kalfkrama) in Andkhyacakra> mAbhinava considered this to be the central teaching of the Krama system, whichhe syncretizes with the Anuttaratrikakulakrama (generally simply called \"Trika\")of which his Tantrdloka is a comprehensive .manual dealing with the liturgy ofthis Kaula-cum~Tantric school i 17Modern scholars of non-dualist Kashmiri Saivism generally distinguish betweenKula and Krama as if they were two separate schools or, to use the currentexpression 'systems*. In the light of the evidence both from the recentlyrecovered Agamic sources, as well as that afforded by the Kashmiri authorsthemselves and their references from the original scriptures, this distinctioncan be said to be clearly false. The Krama system is a Kaula tradition in everyrespect. The evidence is enormous in support of this view. We will only refer toa small part of it here, just enough to prove our point.In the Kramastotra, the first of the twelve Kalis is described as a wave ofdense bliss which rises from the ocean of Kula 11 * and then merges again in theabyss of Kula. Ultimately, the last Kali in the series merges in Akula, 119which is represented genetically as the Supreme Abode of the Goddess J 20 Inthis way, Sakti as Kula merges into Siva as Akula, having emerged out of herinfinite potentiality and traversed through the entireThe Kaula Tantrascycle of manifestation, which is nothing but the expression of her own nature,121 Thus the two, Kula and Akula, constituting the Supreme Kaula realityiparamakaula), encompass all of manifestation as an inscrutable union ofimmanence leading to transcendence and transcendence to immanence. This is pureKaula doctrine,Similarly Krama ritual, like Krama doctrine, is Kaula. That Krama ritual attimes required the offering and consumption of meat and wine as well as ritualsex is well known to scholars of Kashmiri SaivismJ 22 In Abhinava's expositionof Kaula ritual in chapter 29 of the Tantraloka, he refers to a number of Kramaworks, 123 as does his commentator Jayaratha. These include the Kramapujana^Kramarahasya^ Devipancasatika™ Kalikula™ Madhavakula, m Srikulakrdmodaya™ andTantraraja-bhaiiaraka™ The Madhavakula, which is a part of theTantraraja-bhauaraka that Kashmiris considered to be a major authority on Krama,refers to the type of ritual it expounds as Kulapujana. m Abhinava refers to theKramapujana m as an authoritative Tantra in which the Supreme Lord explains thesecret essentials of Kula ritual, namely, the worship of the Yuganathas andtheir consorts, which is a standard necessary preliminary of all Kaula ritualThus Abhinava refers to a Krama text as his authority right at the beginning ofhis exposition of Kaula ritual Similarly, in the CMSS the Yuganathas and theirconsorts are worshipped in the Purvamnaya which in the course of practice comesfirst, located as it is in the East.* 1 Jnananetranatha (alias Sivananda) isvenerated by Kashmiri Krama authors as the founder of the Krama tradition ofwhich they are direct descendants J 34 He \"brought down to earth\" a Krama workcalled the Yonigahvaratantra™ in which he lists the names of the Yuganathas andtheir associates, proclaiming that they taught the secret of the Kula path(ku!amarga), m It is not surprising, therefore, that Krama is also known as theKalikula^ 1 or Kramakula™ in the Agamic sources to which Kashmiri authors refer.In short, it appears that although Krama is an independent school (with manysubdivisions of its own) it cannot be distinguished from Kula but is, in fact,one of its branches. 139We turn now to the next point, namely, the Kalikula's identity as Uttaramnaya.In Mahesvarananda's time (thirteenth century) the Krama system he adhered to andwhich he traces back to Sivananda (so aligning himself unequivocally to theKashmiri Krama tradition) was considered to be Uttaramnaya. MaheSvaranandarefers to it as \"Auttaramnaya\" twice and as the \"non-dual principle of Uttara\"™wtvidi was originally taught by Bhairava to Bhairavi 14 * and ultimatelytransmitted to him as the Krama doctrine he expounds in his MaharthamanjarV 42By extension he also calls this doctrine that of the \"anuttaramnaya\"^ as \"thephilosophy of absolute {anuttara) non-dual consciousness\" 144 which leads toliberation inAnalysis11this life in which freedom and enjoyment (moksa and bhoga) are united. Although,as we have already had occasion to remark, neither Abhinava nor the Kashmiriauthors before him refer to the Krama system as Uttaramnaya, there is evidenceto suggest that it was known as such to some, at least, of the earlier Tantras,although this may not have been its original identity in the earliest sources.145 Thus the colophons of the Yonigahvara by Jnananetranatha state that thisTantra belongs to the Onkarapliha of the Uttaramnaya 146 and says of itself inthe body of the text that it is \"the tradition of the Great Teaching,\" and \"theessence of the Northern Kula.\" 147 Similarly, the colophons of theDevipancaiatika declare that this Tantra, which deals with the Kalikakrama,belongs to the Northern Tradition. 148It transpires from this evidence that, although we can talk of a \"Kula system\"as a doctrinal standpoint in the context of Kashmiri Saivism as well as HinduTantricism in general, the generic meaning of the term \"Kula,\" when it is usedto refer to the entire Kaula tradition with its many schools, is not to beconfused with the former sense. Similarly, it appears that the term \"Krama,\"like \"Kula,\" also conveys a broad generic meaning. It refers, in one sense, tothe sequence of actions in Kaula ritual, the order of recitation of Mantras,deposition (nyasa) of letters or the seed-syllables of Mantras on the body or ona man4ala> image or other representation of the deity and its surroundingentourage such as a pitcher or the sacrificial firepit 149 \"Krama\" can also meanthe liturgy or ritual itself and so is virtually synonymous with the term\"prakriya.\" 150 Again the term \"Krama,\" variously qualified, can serve as theappellation of a Kaula school Thus the Kashmiri Krajrna system as a whole is attimes called \"Kallkrama\" although the term also refers to the order of thesequence of Kalis worshipped in the course of certain rituals or as a series ofstates of consciousness. Similarly, the Kubjika school or Pascimamnaya is alsosometimes called \"Snkrama.\" 151 \"Krama\"and \"Kula\" are in this sense, to allintents and purposes, virtual synonyms: the expressions \"Kallkula\"and\"Kallkrama\" are interchangeable, as are the terms \"Snkrama\" and \"Srlkula.\" Theterm \"Krama\" lays emphasis on the typical ritual form a particular Kaula schoolexhibits, while the term \"Kula\" stresses its doctrinal affiliations andindividual identity as a specific Kaula tradition. Thus the combination of thetwo terms, as in the expressions \"Kalikula* krama\" or \"Snkulakrama\", althoughhardly different from \"Kalikula\"or \"Kallkrama\", etc., focus primarily on thecharacter of these schools as possessing distinct liturgies of their own. Again,there appears to be a distinction between Kaula schools which were \"Kramakulas\"(or equally one could say \"Kulakramas\") and those that were not, in the sensethat the Tantras of these schools do not align themselves with any Krama, ThisisThe Kaula Tantrastrue generally of independent Kaula traditions which had no place in the amnayasystem of classification.Although the Pakimamnaya is a substantial Tantric tradition with a clearlydefined identity of its own, and its Tantras contain much that is original, itis, at the same time, built up of diverse elements which it draws from varioussources, particularly other Kaula schools. This is a feature common to all theseschools in general.* 52 Thus, a way in which we can better understand thePakimamnaya injhe broader context of the many Tantric schools which constitutethe Agamic tradition as a whole is through a careful analysis of its constituentelements. By pursuing this approach, we can study the Pakimamnaya as a livingtradition whose growth is marked both by the development of its own new ideasand the accretion of others. From this point of view, the integration of Kaliworship into the Kubjika cult is significant. In the CMSS the mysticism of theKalikula is assigned to a high level. Of the Four Doors of Kula (Kuladvara),which constitute Kaulacara, the highest is the experience of the Immaculate(niranjana) attained through the Arising of the Sequence of the Cycle of Kalis(Kalicakrakramodaya), that is, the Wheel of Time. The yogi who contemplates itssuccessive phases assimilates through it into his own consciousness the oneUltimate Reality which is both the multiplicity of diversity and unity ofoneness. 153 This sequence is that of Anakhya (the Inexpressible), which is awell-known feature of the Krama system. 154According to the KMT, Kali (as Kalasarnkarsinl or Guhyesvan) is merely a minormanifestation of Kubjika. * 55 In the KNT, which postdates the KMT, Kubjika isoccasionally considered to be a form of Kali called \"Kakali\", which is probablyan abbreviated form of \"KubjikakahV^ 56 The MBT, which is later than the KMT,but probably earlier than both the CMSS 157 and KNT, identifies Kail withKubjika, the Supreme Goddess. 158 Moreover, the Srlkrama of the Kubjika schooland the Kallkrama are juxtaposed as two Kramas, one belonging to the WesternTradition Pakimamnaya and the other to the Northern— Uttaramnaya. m By the timewe reach the CMSS, the Kallkrama is fully integrated into Pascima doctrine andthey are vitally linked together by their common esoteric Kaula character.Before we conclude this section and proceed to discuss the Purvamnaya and itsrelationship to the Kubjika school, we should take note of an importanthistorical reference in the CMSS's treatment of this amnaya, namely that thecycle of Kalis here described was taught by Niskriyanandanatha to Vidyananda.The CMSS agrees here with other sources, according to which the line oftransmission of the Kallkrama teachings is as follows: Niskriyanandanatha(consort Jhanadiptl) —Analysis79Vidyananda (consort Rakta) — Saktyananda (consort Mahananda) -> Sivananda(consort Samaya). We are told by Jayaratha that these teachers and consorts areworshipped as a standard part of the preliminaries to Kaulapuja in works such asthe Devipaficakiika and the Kalikula. l60 The Yonigahvara refers to this line ofteachers directly after the standard group of Yuganathas and entourage, !61 andso integrates the two groups as those of Kaula masters who are all equallyworthy of veneration. I63 There seems to be little reason to doubt that theNiskriyananda and the Vidyananda of the CMSS are the same as the teachersmentioned in these sources. However, although the fact that Niskriyanandafigures in the CMSS as the revealer of an original transmission is significant,this is not in itself enough evidence to prove that he was the founder of theKrama system as a whole. Perhaps we may attribute to him the distinction ofhaving been the first to have realized this particular sequence of Kalis. m Butbefore^saying anything definite about this, we must first examine the earlierAgamic sources to understand the historical antecedents of the Krama system as adistinct school.The PurvamnayaThe CMSS clearly identifies Trika with the Purvamnaya through which the originalKaula teachings were transmitted by the Yuganathas. Thus the masters which everyKaula, whatever school he may belong to, should venerate as the founders ofKaulism as a whole are here all made to belong to the Trikamafhika. We do notpossess enough of the early sources to be able to compare directly what theoriginal Agamic Trika tradition has had to say about this. Fortunately, however,Abhinavagupta explains in his Tantraloka how Kaula ritual should be performed byKashmiri Trika Saivites. The way in which Abhinava conceives the relationshipbetween the Yuganathas and the Trika principle (and hence, by implication, theirrelationship with Trika Saivism) agrees well enough with the CMSS for us to bereasonably sure that Abhinava must have based his account on Agamic sources.Moreover, although he deals with several Kaula rites described in differentTantras, he is not solely concerned with them alone but seeks, in broader terms,to explain the method (prakriya) that underlies all Kaula ritual In other words,what he has to say is, from his point of view, universally applicable by allKaula Saivites. This is particularly true of the worship of the Yuganathas,which he describes at the beginning of his account, to which we now turn.As a prelude to the rite proper, the officiant must first purify himself.He does so in this case by projecting the Para said Malinl Mantras onto his bodyin the prescribed manner and, once filled with their cosmic power, thenidentifying himself with Bhairava. He now offers libations to Bhairava and thecircles of his energies that surround him, which are identified with theofficiant's own sensory and mental powers. This is done by drinking a mixture ofmale and female sexual fluid (kundagolaka) from a sacrificial jar previouslyfilled for this purpose. According to Abhinava, the officiant attains in thisway a vision of the fullness of his universal nature which has been renderedbrilliantly manifest by the energy of the sacrificial offering. He has,therefore, no need to do anything else unless he wishes to see this samefullness manifest also in the outer world through the outpouring of his sensoryenergies, in which case he proceeds to perform the outer ritual. 1 * 4 Thisbegins, as usual, with the worship of the Kaula teachers in a sacred circle{mandate) drawn on the ground with coloured powders, The form of this mandate,called if $iddhacakra'\\ is basically as we have illustrated it here. See Figure3. The Yuganathas with their consorts and disciples are worshipped in the innersquare. Their names are as shown in Table 7,Table 7.

Moreover the names of theovattis and pffhas associated with the Six Princes, according to the CMSS, agreeexactly with Abhinava's account and the Kulakritfavatara, which Jayaratha quotesin his commentary, 166 Note, incidentally, that the names of the ovallis inthese accounts do not quite agree with the KRU (see above p, 62), Abhinava doesnot record the town (nagara) associated with the Six Princes but lists insteadtheir ghara (literally \"house\") and palll (literally \"Milage\").More interesting than the coincidence of these details is the formation andidentity of the triangle in the centre of the mandate, Abhinava explains theform of this triangle and the way in which it is worshipped in hisPardtrimsikavivaranaJ 67 The triangle represents the divine matrixThe Kaula Tantras(yoni), in the centre of which resides Kulesvarl, in her aroused state, in unionwith Paranandabhairava from whom flows Kula, the blissful power of emission(visargakkti\\ through which the cosmic order is generated. The triangle (whosemicrocosmic equivalent is the female sexual organ) is worshipped bycontemplating this creative flow of bliss in the unity of universalconsciousness. This can be done either directly in elevated states ofconsciousness and/or through the ecstatic experience of physicalorgasm,It seems that the CMSS refers to this distinctly Trika practice when it remarksthat the goddess emerges from the centre of its energies along withParamanandabhairava (see above p. 69). In this way \"Kula emerges in the womb ofKula\" (ibid.) and the worship of the Yuganathas bears fruit. The mandate inwhich the Yuganathas are worshipped is divided into five sections, namely:1) the Mantras of the Trika goddess,2) the Kaula masters,3) the sphere of the flux of the Wheel of MalinI which corresponds to the vitalbreath,4) the sphere of the Wheel of Mdtrka corresponding to the activity ofconsciousness, and5) the outer square representing the senses.These together constitute Kula, the micro- and macro-cosmic Totality. In thecentre resides Kulesvarl who can be worshipped in the form of any of the threeTrika goddesses, either alone or with Kulesvara, her consort. 168 We canconclude, therefore, that the CMSS records, in broad terms, the manner in whichthe Yuganathas are worshipped in the Trikakula. Associated with the Purvamnaya,they are the first to be worshipped in the order of the amnayas and so accordeda peculiarly high status, which at the same time sets them apart from thePakimamnaya and its own line of transmission, while integrating them into it.We move on now to our next object of enquiry, namely, the relationship betweenthese amnayas and Trika. The Kularatnoddyota repeatedly associates thePurvamnaya with the Pakimamnaya. The Kaula tradition with which this Tantra isassociated develops, it says, in these two forms J 69 Thus the KRU at timescombines both together For example, the fire ritual, mandala and initiation issaid to be explained in accord with the ritual procedures of both traditions,'70 At the same time, however, the two traditions are also distinguished. Thus itis clearly stated in places that the rituals and doctrines of this Tantra arebasically those ofAnalysis83the Pakimamnaya, which has incorporated elements of the Purvamnaya. For example,in a sequence of sixty-four energies divided in the usual pattern of eight timeseight (which in this case are eight energies associated with eight sacredplaces), the eight powers (matr) belonging to Prayaga are said to originate fromthe Purva tradition. 17 ' But even though the KRU admits that it has borrowedfrom the Purvamnaya, it maintains that the Purvamnaya as a whole is derived fromthe Pakimamnaya and that this is why they are essentially similar. ThePurvamnaya is a direct offshoot of the Kubjika tradition and is similar to it inevery respect, just as a reflection is a reproduction of the reflected object J72The KRU's account of the origin of the Purvamnaya associates it with Mitranatha,a well-known Pakima master. Mitranatha was a direct disciple of Vrksanatha who,as an incarnation of the goddess Kubjika, brought the Pakima teachings down intothe world during this Era. 173 Accordingly, insofar as the Purvamnaya is derivedfrom Pakimdmnayain this way, the goddess enquires how the Purvamnaya arose fromit. 174 The account of its origin which follows is basically a variant of manysimilar myths which explain how Matsyendranatha received the Kaula teachings.175 Here the story goes that Parvati taught the Purvamnaya to her son, Skanda,secretly from a book. For some unexplained reason Skanda became angry and in afit of rage threw the book into the sea where it was swallowed by a fish(minaka). In the belly of this fish resided a great Siddha who read the book andpracticed the yoga it taught and so grew powerful and full of splendour. Fromthe belly of this fish emerged Adinatha in the form of Matsyendranatha.A connection is here clearly being made between the first Kaula teacher of thisera, Matsyendranatha, and the Purvamnaya, as it is in the CMSS. However, the KRUdoes not equate the Purvamnaya with Trika, although it knows of the Trikatantraas an independent group which it mentions along with the Siddhanta> Varna, Bhutaand Garutfa Tantras as well as the Kapalika Somasiddhanta, amongst others. 176In a long list of Tantras 177 at the beginning of this work, theSiddhddevimahatantra is mentioned which is clearly none other than theSiddhayogesvarimata. We have already noted that both CMSS and KMT refer to this,the root Trikatantra.Indeed, there can be little doubt that Trika is an important element of thePakimamnaya, Thus the worship of the three goddesses, Para, Parapara and Apara,which is a distinguishing characteristic of Trika, is an important feature ofthe Kubjika cult as well.' 78 Their Mantras are the same as those of the Trika,'79 as are those of the male consorts associated with them, namely,Bhairavasadbhava, Ratisekhara and Navatma> m Triads in general are a prominentfeature of the Pakimamnaya; we oftenThe Katjla Tantrasfind groups of three related to one another. 181 The goddess Kubjika herself isthree-fold in the form of a young girl, maiden and old woman J 82 Moreover, sheis explicitly said to be three-fold as the union of the goddesses Para, Paraparaand Apara. An important triad is here Just as it is for the Kashmiri Trika, thatof Sambhava, Sakta and Anava, which are three basic ritual patterns at onelevel, and at the inner level of consciousness correspond—as in the Trika—towill, knowledge and action. Cosmic counterparts are attributed to them in theform of the Three Worlds into which the universe is divided. 183 The whole ofthe teaching is similarly divided into these three types, 184 which is why thereare three types of initiation (devidiksa) through which the Srlkrama becomesmanifest. 1 * 5 Even more vital and fundamental than these similarities are thebasic forms of the Mantric codes adopted by the Kubjika cult, namely, those ofSabdarasi and MalinV™ They are the very backbone of the entire Mantric system ofthis tradition, just as they are of that of Trika, so much so that the god tellsthe goddess in the KRU that:The Trikatanira will be constructed by the conjunction of the parts primary andsecondary, of the three Vidyas along with Malint and SabdarffiwAlthough the use of the future here implies that the god is going to makeTrikatanira after the revelation of the Kubjika cult, there can be little doubtthat Trika precedes the Kubjikatantra and it is the latter which has borrowedfrom the former, not the other way around. Indeed, in places these Tantrasthemselves inform us that they have drawn elements from Trikatantra$. mMoreover, the oldest known Pascimatantra, the Kubjikamaia, must be later thanthe first Trikatanira, the Siddha-yogesvarimata, because it refers to it. Again,the MBT and KRU both know Trika as Trika. This means that they were redactedwhen Agamic Trika had reached an advanced stage of development because theearliest Tantras that taught Trika doctrine and ritual, such as the SYM, did notconsider themselves to be TrikatantrasdiS such. 1 * 9 Thus the KMT, which isearlier than the MBT and KRU, does not refer to Trika as a school, possiblybecause it precedes this phase of Trika's development. Whether this is the caseor not, it it a significant fact that the later Pakimatantras know of Trika'sexistence especially because reference to Trika is rare in the primary sources.Moreover, that the CMSS knows the Trikasara, an extensive Trikatanira frequentlyreferred to by the Kashmiris, shows that the followers of the Kubjika cultcontinued to consult Trika sources throughout its development. 190 It issignificant, from this point of view, that it is in Nepal, where the Kubjikacult flourished, that the Siddha-Kulatantras and Saivagama85yogesvarimata has been recovered. This is probably because it was felt to berelated to the Kubjika cult and so was copied and preserved.The Kulatantras and SaivagamaBefore we move on to discuss the Pascimamnaya, we take this opportunity to sumup what we have said up to now about the development of these Kaula traditions.Firstly, we should emphasue that the essential features of Kaula doctrine andritual are by no means exclusive to Tantric works which call themselves Kaula.Practically all that is generally considered to be the ritual, yogic practiceand life style of a Kaula (whether itinerant ascetic or householder) can befound prescribed in the Bhairava-tantras. The JY, SYM, BY and Bhairavatantras ofthis sort all seem at first sight highly Kaula in character. They themselves,however, do not consider themselves to be such, even though they do sometimesdescribe rituals that they specifically state are Kaula. Indeed, this fact onlyserves to make the contrast between them and the Kaulatantras even morestriking, despite much that they seemingly share in common. How then are we todistinguish a Kaulatantra from other Tantric works? The reply to this questionlies essentially in what a given Tantra says about itself and its relationshipto other Tantras and Tantric traditions. A Kaulatantra will itself tell us thatits dominant concern is with Kaula doctrine which it labels as such in its ownterms. This is a simple principle of general application in trying to assess towhat type a Tantra belongs.As we have already noted, the earliest Tantras which Kashmiri Saivites refer toas original sources of Trika doctrine are not, in this sense, Kaula. It makessense, therefore, that according to Abhinavagupta the Malinivijayottaratantrawhich he considers, along with the S YM, to be the most important Trikatanira,refutes Kaula doctrine. Although he says that it goes beyond Kula doctrine, infact it belongs to the strata of Trikatanira which had not yet become Kaula (ora 'higher' Kaula) in the way that it is for example, in the Bhairavakulatantraor Kularatnamala. The same is true of the Kallkrama. The Tantrarajabhatfaraka(alias Sirateheda or Jayadrathayamala), to which the Kashmiris refer as anauthority for certain points of Krarna doctrine, is a sophisticated Tantra whichtypologically can be said to be highly Kaula in character; it does not, however,define itself as such even though it does deal with Kaula ritual in places. 191Therefore, we cannot say that this Tantra belongs to the Kalikrama in thespecific sense of the term, although it is certainly concerned in parts with theworship of Kali in many forms and is full ofThe Kaula Tantrastypically Kalikrama notions. Other, probably later, Tantras of the Kali cultwere, however, Kaula and conscious of themselves as Kalikrama Tantras, One couldsay that the Kalikrama, like Trika, acquired a specific independent identity asa Tantric tradition when it became conscious of itself as Kaula. Moreover, atthis stage of its development we can begin to identify figures in the line ofthe Agamic Kali cults who brought Tantras 'down to earth* or transmitted theoral tradition of the Kalikrama which finally emerged in Kashmir, fashioned atthe hands of the Kashmiri authors, as a fully fledged system, not just a mass ofritual details or scattered visions in chaotic scriptural sources.We can trace a continuity from the virtually total anonymity of the earliestscriptural sources of the proto-Krama and proto-Trika, namely, the Bhairava andVarna Tantras, to the more distinctly sectarian Kaula-tantras of the Trika andKrama, right up to the extra-canonical exegetical works of monist Kashmiri Saivaauthors. In this way, by ithe middle of the ninth century, they emerged out ofthe world of the Saiva Agamas into that of the sastras. For at least twocenturies these two worlds of discourse remained vitally linked through theTantric adepts who belonged to the line of transmission of the Agamic teachingsand served as living sources of their hidden meaning. Although we have taken aleap outside the ambit of Saiva scripture into a different dimension ofdiscourse, the line of transmission is linked to that of the canonical worksthemselves. In other words, the Trika and Krama schools matured to this levelfollowing the pace of a progressively more refined hermeneutics of theTantras'esoteric meaning, which developed in the oral traditions. It wasSambhunatha^-Abhinavagupta's Trika master—who gave him the basic exegeticalTrika-based model upon which the culminating work of the Trika tradition—theTantraloka-As based. Again it appears that it was largely due to him that Trikawas taken to be the apogee of monist Kashmiri Saivism, for there can be no doubtthat Trika is far from the central focus of monist Kashmiri Saivism beforeAbhinavagupta.To get back to the point; when the Krama emerged as a self-conscious Kaula cult,it seems that it also became conscious of itself as one of a group of amnayas.Whether these two events are concomitant or not, that is, whether the Kalikramaas an independent Kaula tradition knew itself right from its inception as theUttaramnaya or not, it certainly did so at some stage of its development. TheTrikakula on the other hand, it seems, never thought of itself as belonging toan arnnaya even though the CMSS refers to Trika as the purvamnaya. This isprobably why the Kashmiri Saiva authors ignored the amnaya system and preferredto relate the Trika—as a 'higher* Kaula tradition—to the Saivagama as a whole,just as the Agamic Trika itself did.Pascimamnaya87The Tantras of the Kubjika cult were, however, it seems, Kaula right from thestart and thought of themselves as belonging specifically to the Pascimamnaya.We know that the KMT is older than the JY™-a proto-Krama Tantra—- which refersto it (see appendix C) and that it is also older than the NSA. The J Y is wellaware of an independent current of Kaula scripture although it does not sayspecifically that the KMT belongs to it. Are we therefore to assume that theKallkula already existed at the time and that it represented an Uttaramnaya inrelation to the Kubjikatantras? Or is the KMT the oldest extant type ofamnaya-oriented Tantra? We have already noted that it nowhere clearly definesthe amnayas of the other directions, although it refers to them. Could this bebecause they were simply empty categories? In other words, did they have no morethan an ideal existence as mere logical complements to an existentPaicimam-ndyal If we accept this hypothesis, we are led to consider thepossibility that the Kalikrama accommodated itself later to this pattern, as didthe Srividya tradition in a less certain manner. Perhaps, on the other hand, itwould be better to think of them as developing together with their roots firmlyembedded in the Saivagama, drawing life from it and growing out of it, as wellas alongside it.The Pascimamnaya — The Cult of KubjikaSome scholars have assumed that the cult of Kubjika is of Nepalese originlargely because virtually all the manuscripts of the Tantras of this school areNepalese. I92 This assumption is not, however, supported by the textsthemselves. They do say that this school originated in a mountainous region,probably the Himalayas (see below), and make the point that it spread throughoutIndia. Even so, Nepal is hardly mentioned as a place sacred to the goddess, 193while the Nine Nathas, who are said to have propagated the doctrine of Kubjikain our times, although all of North Indian origin, 194 are not Nepalese.However, wherever it may have originated, the cult of Kubjika was known in Nepalby the first half of the twelfth century A.D.—the date of the oldest manuscriptof the KMTJ 95 The great abundance of manuscripts of Tantras and related worksbelonging to this school copied from this time up to the seventeenth centurytestify to its popularity there during this period. Judging from the number ofmanuscripts copied from this period onwards, the Kubjika cult seems to havewaned in importance although it must have continued to command a small followingup to quite recent times because a few manuscripts did continue to be copiedright up to the present century. IThe Kaula Tantraswas informed during a recent visit to Nepal that Kubjika is still worshipped oncertain occasions in the Kathmandu valley although her cult is now hardly knownto anybody,Scholars have pointed out that references to Kubjika and her school are rare, mnor are images of her common whether drawn or sculptured. I97 This is true ofanother goddess associated with her worship and whose cult has similarly beenpopular in Nepal since the inception of the cult of Kubjika, namely, Guhyakali.198 The reason for this seems to be that such cults either disappeared alongwith countless others or else managed to survive only at the regional level. Aprime example of this phenomena is Trika Saivism which, but for its following inKashmir and the genius of those who applied themselves to it there, wouldprobably be unknown. It is not quite right, therefore, to think of the Kubjikacult as a school which \"remained very independent and stood aloof from otherTantrik schools.\" 1 ^ In fact, one of the aims of future research into thisschool could be to identify, as far as the available sources permit, the variouselements of other Tantric traditions which have contributed to its formation andto distinguish them from its own original contributions.Kubjika, the 'Crooked One 9\"Kubjika\" is the feminine form of the Sanskrit word \"Kubja\" which literallymeans \"humped-back\" or \"crooked.\" Even so, although the Tantras of the Kubjikaschool describe many forms in which the goddess can be visualized, she is notcommonly represented as bent over. It has been suggested, in order to accountfor this fact, that \"Kubja\"i$ a word of Muntja origin 200 that does notoriginally mean \"crooked.' 1 The Tantras do not, however, support thiscontention. Thus we find that Kubjika is also called \" Vahreivarl \" Vakrika orVakra because, as the Tantras explain, her limbs are crooked (vakra)™ 1 Of herthree principal forms as a girl (Bala), young woman (Kumar!) and old woman(Vrddha), it is the last which, as one would expect, is associated with hercrooked form. 202 Perhaps this image of her as old and deformed is the reasonwhy she is also called \"Khanjani\" which means literally \"she who walks with alimp.\" 203 A myth recorded in the KRU that explains why she is bent over doesnot, however, relate this to her age. 204 The story goes that Kubjika once satwith devotion to worship the union of the god with the goddess. The god thenappeared to her and took hold of her hand as a prelude to union but she,overcome with apprehension and bashfulness, contracted her body, and so became'Kubjika*. As such, she is equated with Kurtdalirti who, when awakened,Kubjika89becomes bent over with 'shame', 205 Again, Kubjika's crooked form relates to hernature as Kuftdalini who is the matrix (yoni) or Triangle (srgata) from whichcreation pours forth and in which it resides. As such, she is bent over, notwhen awakening but when she is dormant, and the power of consciousness(cicchakti) is contracted, which is as one would expect, and is in fact usuallythe case in representations of Kurttfalinl From this point of view,consciousness is 'straight 1 , i.e., unconditioned when it is free of 'crooked'obscuring thought-constructs. 206 From another point of view, Kubjika is said tobe crooked because she must contract her limbs to reside in the body ofKulesvara just as someone whose body is large must stoop down when moving aboutin a small hut. 207 While according to the Paratantra, she is bent over becauseshe initially 'churns' her navel with her tongue to give birth to the universewithin her womb. 20S This is because, as the CMSS explains, the navel is theGreat Matrix (mahayoni) from which Ku^dalim rises. Thus in this account Kubjikais bent over in order to stimulate her cosmic power which, rising through thebody, leads the yogi to liberation. 209Kubjika is the Supreme Goddess (Para devt) where form is the divine light ofconsciousness that shines in the centre of the brilliant radiance enlightenedyogis perceive. 210 As such, she is the Great Mother they experience withinthemselves. 211 As Kurttfalim she is pure bliss, the power of the Light whichresides in ail the six centres in the body (cakra) and so is of six forms. 2 * 2As the power of consciousness she is the source of all Mantras and as such hasthree aspects: Supreme (Para), Middling (Parapara) and Inferior (Apara), In thisthree-fold form she is, just as in Trika doctrine, MalinP li consisting of thefifty letters of the alphabet in a state of disorder, symbolizing the rising ofKuytfalim and the disruption of the cosmic order that takes place when it isreabsorbed into the Supreme Matrix (parayoni)— the goddess Kubjika—from whenceit was originally emitted. At this level the goddess resides in the state whichis Beyond Mind (unmanabhavaiita) as Siva's divine power (sdmbhavasakti) to will,know and act. She has thus three forms (trirupa) and travels along the threepaths (tripathaga) 214 of the sides of the triangle of the organ of generation(bhaga) which is both the source and ultimate end of all creation. 215 At thecorners of this triangle are located the Mahaplihas: Purnagiri, Jalandhara andKamarupa, In the centre is Oa'iyanapltha where the goddess resides in union withthe divine linga whose nature is bliss itself and whose seed (bindu) is the Skyof Consciousness. 216 In the centre Akula and Kula unite, while the goddess, asRudra*s power {rudrasakti), pervades each part of the triangle and lords over itas the Mistress of Kula (KuleSvari) who is also called Mahakaulika and Bhairavl.217According to the CMSS, the form in which Kubjika resides in theThe Kaula Tantrascentre of this triangle is as a tamarind tree: Cincint Thus it refers to thedoctrine of the Kubjikatantras as CiftcinUastra™ The abode of this doctrine isthe Circle of the Divine Transmission {divyaughamaridala), higher than that ofthe Transmission of the Perfected Ones and of Men {Siddha and Manavaugha).™ Itis under this Tamarind Tree that Cincinmatha (alias Vrksanatha) attained, bydivine command, the highest state. 220 This tree is the tree of the light ofconsciousness {cincinicit-prakasa) brought into this world by Siddhanatha 221who planted it on the Island of the Moon {candradvipa) which is in the GreatOcean of Kula. The roots of this Tree and its branches are extensive and itbears the fruits of the Divine Transmission. It is Kaula rooted in Kula andflourishes in Siva's Circle. The juice of this tree is one's own nature(svasvabhava); its young sprouts are the Vedas and Vedangas; its flowers are thesenses, and the divine fount which waters it is the delight of consciousness,its inner glory. 222 To lie in its shade is to experience the highest state ofrest (visranii) in which one is free of the opposites of pleasure and pain.The Origins of the Kubjika CultThe founder of the Kubjika cult is said to be Siva who is venerated as Adinatha,223 the primordial teacher. It is Adinatha who imparts the doctrine to thegoddess Kubjika in the KRU. He, the first Master, is, according to one myth, thesource of the goddess 224 even though he declares that both he and his consortare beginningless and with no end. It is he, not the goddess, who is the essenceof the Pa&cima tradition which draws its life from him, because he is theauthentic identity of those who worship him and the goddess. 225 His body is thesource of the sacraments offered to him and the goddess with whom he unites toemit the 'sequences* (krama) of the liturgy and the sacred circles {maydlala) inwhich he is worshipped with the sacrificial formulas he himself has taught. 226Adinatha is also called Srlnatha 227 who is identified with Mahabhairava, theLord of Kula and Kubjika's consort, Kubjesvara, 228 He receives the doctrinefrom the goddess but at the same time is praised by her as the source of allKula doctrine. 22 * Srinatha is also identified with Srlkantha, said to be theoriginal propagator of the Saivagama 230 who is worshipped at times even beforeSahkara. 23 \" Although Srlnatha is extolled as the highest God, there arereasons to believe that he was an historical person. He is listed as the last ofeighteen teachers in the line of the Divine Tradition {divyamnayanukrama) andwas said to be the only teacher in the town of Candrapura who belonged to theWestern Tradition. He wasOrigins of the Kubjika Cult91helped at the beginning of the present Age of Darkness to propagate the doctrineby OaTsanatha, Srisasthanatha and Srlcaryendranatha who lived in the land ofKonkona where where Candrapura was situated, 232 As the founder of a line ofteachers, he is called \"Olinatha\". 233 A Siddhanatha is also referred to as theoriginal propagator of this tradition but he may be none other than Srinatha ifwe take \"Siddhanatha\" to be a way of referring to an accomplished adept ratherthan a proper name. 234As we have noted above, Siddhanatha was said to have brought the teachings toearth on the Island of the Moon {candradvipa), also called the \"City of theMoon\" {candrapura), the \"City of the Island of the Moon/' 235 or the \"City ofthe Sacred Place of the Moon\" {candrapiihapura). m It symbolizes the InnateNature {svabhava) of all things where the divine body of the goddess Kubjikaresides in the form of Kurtdalinl It is probable that Candrapura did existalthough the Tantras overlayed it, as they did other places sacred to thegoddess, with a symbolism which interiorized it into an inner sacred geography,thus making it difficult for us to locate the site of this town. The land ofKonkona, where Candrapura was situated, is said to have been in the Himalayas.Schoterman, however, does not believe that this is likely but thinks insteadthat: \"Konkona denotes the whole strip of land between the Western Ghats and theArabian Sea.\" 237 It seems more likely, however, that Candrapura was locatedsomewhere in the Himalayan region in view of the many associations that thegoddess and her place of origin has with mountains. Thus in the KMT the Mountainof the Moon {candraparvata) is said to lie to the west of mount Meru nearGandhamalya 238 which is where the Island of the Moon is located accordingio the$a{SS. 239 Indeed, this is probably one of the reasons (if not the main one) whythe cult of Kubjika is associated with the western quarter.Between the three peaks of Himavat is the site of the Land or Town of theTradition {santanabhuvanajpura) which is equated with the Western Tradition,also called (as is common practice in these Tantras), the Abode of the Moon{candragrha)™ According to the mystical physiology of these Tantras, Himavatsymbolizes the mind {manas) found at the end of the Twelve-fmger Space above thehead {dvadasania) where Kw?g*alini abides in her most risen state. 241 ThusKubjika is said to descend onto the peak of the Snow Mountain {himagiri) in theland of India. This peak is located at the end of the stream of divine sound{nada) 2A2 which resounds throughout the micro/macrocosm until it merges intothe Silence of the Transcendent at the highest level of being at the End ofSound {nadania) in the Twelve-finger Space. The goddess is therefore said toreside on the peak of mount Kailasa and, as such, is the Goddess of the Peak{sikhddevf) and the Mistress of the Wheels of Energy which revolve in the cosmicThe Kaula Tantrasbody. 243 Her body is pure consciousness and bestows the bliss of the 'churning'or arousal of the power of enlightened consciousness. 244 As the power ofconsciousness, she is also Speech and as such is adorned with the fifty lettersof the alphabet and resides in this form within the divine triangle of the ThreePeaks once she descends into it along the Path of Meru. 245 The MET, accordingto the colophons, has also emerged along the Path of Meru in the PrimordialSacred Abode (adyapitha)™ The KRU explains that the Path of Meru means,according to Kula doctrine, the Tradition (santana). The Lord of the Traditionis the Great Meru, the Supreme Sky of Consciousness which knows its own naturecompletely. It is from here that the beginningless sequence of the progressiveunfolding of consciousness and the transmission of the doctrine originates andso is called the Primordial Abode (adipifha) located in the Centre betweenKaiiasa and Malaya. The Lord resides here with his power that pervadesall things. 247Although it is not possible on the basis of the evidence so far available to sayanything definite about where the Kubjika cult originated, if we assume that theTantras of these schools invest with symbolic meaning the environment andlocalities in which the Kubjika cult originally developed, it seems likely thatwe would be right to seek its origins somewhere in the western Himalayas. Thatthis cult was known in the mountains of the North of India during the earliestperiod of its development seems to find support by a reference in the KMT tobirch bark as the material on which a Mantra is to be written, 248 The MBT alsorefers to it as a writing material 24 * and the GS prescribes that a sacreddiagram be drawn on it with sexual fluids mixed with poison. 250The study of the cult of Kubjika and the Tantras of the Western Kaula Traditionis barely in its infancy. We hope that some of the more important of these textswill be edited and studied in the near future. There can be no doubt that thisis an early Kaula tradition which is of great interest not only for the richnessof its doctrines and the beauty of its symbolism but also because it can tell ussomething important about a part, at least, of the history of Hindu Tantra,x ART 1HREEAppendicesAppendix AA History of the Study of the Kubjika CultScholars first heard of the existence of the literature of the Kubjika school atthe turn of the century when Haraprasada Sastrl and C. Bendall published theircatalogue of manuscripts belonging to the Darbar Library in Kathrnandu. 1 In1934, P. C Bagchi published an edition of the Kaulajnananirnaya along with anumber of short tracts attributed to Matsyendranatha, In his introduction hequoted extensively from the Kubjikanityahnikatilaka, which was correctlyidentified by Sastri in the Nepal catalogue as belonging to the Paseimamnaya.Bagchi however failed to grasp the distinctive character of the Pakcimamnaya andso simply identified it wholesale with the Kaula school, 2The next brief reference to the existence of this corpus of literature appearedin an article by Chintaharan Chakravarti published in 1937 in the Yearbook ofthe Asiatic Society of Bengal This brief article dealt with the Nepalesemanuscripts of the works of this school deposited in the library of the Society.3 One manuscript of the KMT, which was thought at that time to have been writtenin late Gupta script (but has since been proved to be an early form of Sarada 4), aroused particular interest due to its presumed antiquity. Chakravarti alsowrote short notices of these manuscripts in his catalogue of Tantra manuscriptsbelonging to the Society which came out in two volumes in 1939 and 1940respectively. 5In 1947 a series of articles written by the Nepalese major-general Dhana SamserJangabahadur Rana came out in the Hindi magazine Cartel They were publishedevery two months and each gave a brief account of the amnayas amongst which wasthe Pa&irnamnaya. 6 In 1963 De Mallmann published a book on the iconography ofthe Agnipurana in which she briefly discussed the form of Kubjika describedthere. 7This was the state of affairs up to the beginning of the 1970s when a group ofscholars at the University of Utrecht in Holland decided to edit the KMT whichresulted in 1972 in a preliminary article by Dr. K. R. Van Kooj on the problemsinvolved.* In 1976, an edition of the Gorak$a-T96Appendix Asamhiia was published by Janardana Pantfeya from Sampurnananda SanskritUniversity, Benares, This edition was prepared on the basis of two manuscripts,one the scholar noticed in 1963 in the manuscript library of the said universityand another he found in the collection of the All* India Kashiraj Trust inRamnagar near Benares. 9 This was the first edition of a Tantra belonging to theKubjika school made, as it happens, without the editor knowing that this was theschool of Tantra to which this text belongs.In 1977, Schoterman pubBshed a short article on the KMT' 0 and in 1980 anarticle on the worship of Kubjika in the Agnipurarta* x { In 1982, he publishedan edition of the first five chapters of the $at$ahasrasawhita along with anEnglish translation and extensive notes. 12 This text is an expanded form of the3500 verse KMT and so Schoterman's work is the first major study of a Tantra ofthis school. At the University of Utrecht an edition of theKularatnamulapaficakavatara has been prepared for a research degree. Dr.Schoterman is also preparing an edition of the Kubjikanityahnikatilaka byMuktaka (alias Manjuka) which is a manual for the worship of Kubjika writtenbefore the twelfth century (the date of the manuscript). Dr. T. Goudriaan andDr. Schoterman have completed the edition of the KMT and will hopefully manageto publish it shortly with an English introduction.Appendix BThe M ant hanabhairav at antraThe Manthanabhairava is a lengthy Tantra belonging to the Pakimamnaya. It alsocalls itself caturvimiatisahasra, x that is, a \"book of 24,000 verses\" and is infact not much short of this size. The oldest dated manuscript traced so far wascopied during the reign of Somesvara and is dated N.S. 300, i.e., 1180 A.D. 2The most recent was copied during the reign of Vlravikrama Saha and is datedSam. 1897, i.e., A.D. 1841. Forty-one manuscripts, many of which are more than150 folios long, are listed in Appendix C. One manuscript of a part of thisTantra is preserved in the Asiatic Society of Bengal. It is in Bengali scriptand was copied from a manuscript belonging to a monk in Bodhagaya dated N.S.761, i.e., 1641 A.D.. It contains chapters 74-89 and is written on 199 folios offoolscap paper. 5 Apart from this one, no manuscript of this Tantra has so farbeen found that is not Nepalese.The MBT is divided into four sections, three of which are called \"khania, \"Although a colophon of one of these sections states that this Tantra is dividedinto three parts, 4 in actual fact it appears, on the basis of the descriptionsin the catalogues, that they are not three but four. These are listed belowalong with their approximate length:Yogakhantfa Kumarikakhantfa Siddhakhantfa NavanityayagadhikaraTotal4,500 verses 6,000 verses 2,900 verses 4,300 verses 17,700 versesIn the Paratanira, the MBT is referred to as the \"mahamanthana-fafkaka\" 5 whichmay be translated to mean the \"Great Manthana (bhairavatantra) consisting of agroup of six [thousand verses]\" or also asAppendix B\"consisting of groups of six [thousand verses].\" If the first meaning isintended, then perhaps the Paratantra is referring to just a part of it.Perhaps, however, the work is conceived to be divided into four parts of sixthousand verses, as is the Jayarathayamala. This is perhaps not the casebecause, as we have already noted, only three out of the four sections refer tothemselves as a \"khanda> \"while the MET describes itself (in the Kumarikakhangaat least) as divided into three parts. Does this mean then that theNavanityahnikadhikara is a later addition? Or is it, in fact, a part of one ofthe three original sections? This is just one of the many preliminary problemsthat need to be solved. Indeed, without carefully examining all the MSs it isnot possible even to make out which parts of the MBT they contain. Certainlythere is no single MS that contains it all Moreover, the order of the sectionsalso needs to be assessed. From the notices we have of these MSs there appearsto be a commentary on this Tantra called \"Vidhana\" written by a certainRupasiva. Again, without examining the MSs it is impossible to say whether thecommentary extends to cover the entire Tantra or just a part and if so, whichpart.The MBT is also called Khanjimmaia indicating its close connection to the KMTfor, as the reader will recall, Khanjinl is another name for Kubjika. It wasbrought down to earth by Kalankanatha (see below) while the Kulalikamata of3,500 verses, i.e., the KMT, which the MBT also calls the \"Ratnasutra, \"wasbrought down to earth by Tumbura. The reference here to the KMT of 3,500 versesproves that the MBTis a later work. 6 This is further confirmed by anotherpassage where the presiding god of this school is described as sitting in themandate of the Vidyaplfha holding in one hand the Srlmata. i.e., the KMT.? Thatthe MBT is probably not the original Tantra of the Kubjika school is alsoindirectly confirmed by the highe regard that the Tantras of this school havefor the KMT, rather than the MBT, and that it is the former, not the latter,which figures as one of the sixty-four Tantras listed in the NSA. TheKumarikakhanda of this Tantra is particularly interesting from this point ofview as it seems to be closely related to the KMT. Perhaps, indeed, it is anexpanded version of it, like the $a$$ahasrasamhita referred to above. Nor can itbe the $atSS because this Tantra is divided into fifty chapters whereas theKumarikakhanda is in sixty-six chapters.It is not possible at present to date the MBT with any degree of accuracy. Itcannot be earlier than the seventh century Buddhist logician, Dharmakirti, towhom it refers. 8 Probably, however, Dharmaklrti much precedes the reduction ofthis portion of this Tantra. A reference to an invasion by foreigners whoconquered the entire country after crossing the Indus 9 is apparently areference to the full-scale invasion of India by Muslims in the early eleventhcentury. It appears, therefore, that the MBTManthanabhairavatantra99cannot be older than this nor is it younger than 1180 A.D. which is the date ofthe oldest Nepalese manuscript.To conclude, we shall say a few words about the traditional accounts of therevelation of the MBT. Up to now, I have managed to trace two. One is found inthe Yogakhanda™ of the MBT, and the other in the concluding portion of theKumarikakhanda. 11 According to the latter account, the original form of thisTantra (here called \"Paramesvaramata**) was a fabulous million, million verseslong (Iak$akofj). The essence of the doctrine of this Tantra was transmitted inanother seventy million verses from which another version was supposed to havebeen derived consisting of one hundred and twenty-five thousand verses. The mostessential doctrines of this Tantra were then recorded in a twenty-four thousandverse version which is the present MBT, This was transmitted by Kujesl toMitranatha in three sections.The Yogakhari$a*$ account is more complex than that of the Kumarikakharttfa anddiffers from it in certain details. Here the Divine Transmission of theKhanjimmaia is said to have passed originally from Adinatha to Mitranatha, whothen transmitted it to $a$tinatha, who gave one half to Caryanatha. Caryanathain his turn passed on half of what he had learned. Unfortunately, a break occursin the text here so we do not know whom Caryanatha taught; possibly this wasOtfiyananatha who is usually associated with the three other teachers. Whoeverthis teacher was, he transmitted half to Brhatkanjha, who gave one half toGanaveksa. The remaining portion of the Khanjimmaia was transmitted byAkulanatha. The text now goes on to explain that the version consisting of onehundred twenty-five thousand verses was brought to earth by Cinca(natha) andthat all the rest of the teaching was transmitted by the community of Siddhas onthe Island Free of Thought-Constructs (nirvikalpadvipa) from whence it spread toIndia. We are also told that the Tantra of twenty-four thousand verses wasbrought to earth by Kalankanatha, These two accounts are illustrated graphicallyin Table 8.Table 8, The Transmission of the Manthanabhairavatantra.1) Parameivaramata of I million, million versesiVersion of 70 million verses Version of 125,000 versesMBT revealed to Mitranatha in three khartdas together consisting of 24,000verses.Appendix B2) Adinatha Mitranatha$a$tfriatha - Caryanatha - ? - Brhatkamha -Ganavek$a - Akulanatha Cificanatha(also called Cincinmatha) revealed the 125,000 verse version. Kalankanatharevealed the 24,000 verse version.Appendix CThe Canon of the JayadrathayamalaAfter completing this monograph, it was my good fortune to have been given acopy of a manuscript of the first §afka of the Jayadrathayamala by Mr. G. S,Sanderson who is at present lecturer in Sanskrit at Oxford University. Severalchapters of this text are dedicated to the Saiva canon J P. C. Bagchi examinedthis section of this Tantrain the 1930s 2 but did not publish an extensivereport of its contents, although he did point out its importance. It does, infact, contain a great deal of interesting information relevant to the study ofthe Saiva canon and its history. We have, therefore, thought it best to presentit as a single unit largely as it stands in the original. The numbers in themargin refer to the folio numbers of the manuscript.Bhairava, prompted by the goddess, sets out to give an account of the sastras.He starts by explaining that a sastra is so-called because it teaches (sasandt)those who are frightened, suffering or wicked the way to salvation (tra%a) fromtheir sins and worldly troubles. 3 Ail sdstras belong to four basic categories:4Common (samanya)Com mon-cum-particular (sadhdra#avi£e$a)Particular (yife$a)Specially particular (vi$e$atara)Once Bhairava has enumerated these categories, he tells the goddess that thisprogressive development from less to more specialized knowledge through thesefour stages is inevitable because it is impossible to teach everything at once.Even so, however broad or focalized the terms of reference may be, all human anddivinely revealed knowledge refers to the same reality. Bhairava also implieshere that there is a temporal as well as a logical progression between thesecategories and, indeed, the last three do follow each other in roughlychronological order. Thus these are:165bAppendix CCanon of Jayadrathayamala103Common (samdnya). The sastras belonging to this category enjoy extensive popularsupport and are not criticized as improper by anyone. Thus, because everyone isfit to study and hear them and because their scope is very extensive, they aresaid to be 'common* as well as \"worldly* {laukika). They include the Puranas,literary works (kavya) and those dealing with history (itihasa), mathematics(ganita), dramaturgy (nafaka), metrics (chandas) and grammar (sabda).Common<um-particular (sadhdranavise$a). Only Brahmins are competent to studythese texts and so they are said to be 'particular*; while because those whostudy them do not need to affiliate themselves to any cult, they are also saidto be common. To this category belongs the SrutK here reckoned to be the threeVedas, namely, gk, Sama and Yajus— not the Atharvaveda. They are the mostimportant in this group. Then comes Smrti, the Upanifads, Mantrasutra, theKalpasutra and logic (anvik$a).Particular (vi£e$a). The texts belonging to this category are said to be'particular' because they belong to specific traditions (swnayal These includethe Saura, Saiva, Paficaratra, Pramana, Vaimala, 5 Atharva, Samkhya, Yoga,Bauddha and Arhata.\"Saiva\" here means specifically the Saivasiddhanta scriptures which are of twotypes according to whether they belong to the Siva or Rudra group.Specially Particular (vise$atara). These texts are more 'particular' than thosebelonging to the previous group because they are meant for the followers ofspecific cults within the various traditions. Amongst them are the scriptures ofthe Vajrayana, including the Guhyasamajatantra? To this category also belong theBhairava, Bhuta and Garuga Tantras.The exposition of the canon which follows is concerned with this last categoryand more particularly with the Tantras of the Bhairava cult which encompass,from the JY's point of view, virtually the entire Saiva canon apart from theSiddhanta. Thus this category of'specially particular* texts is said to bedivided variously into three, four and five currents (srotas) as well as intofour pifhas. 166b Before going into the details of these divisions extensively,thediscussion digresses to deal with the origin of the Saiva scriptures in general.The goddess wants to know how the scriptures originated. She wants to know aboutthe nature of the relationship {sarnbandha) between those who transmitted andreceived the scriptures because unless this relationship is established, thescriptures cannot serve as a source of insight {pratipatti).Bhairava explains that Mahesvara is the sole cause of liberation in thisbeginningless, confined world of transmigratory existence. It is MaheSvara*snature to seek to grace mankind, while the latter is the object of his gracebecause every man is a victim of his own faults. Moreover, in his omniscience,Siva knows how to grace humanity and liberate man from his state of bondage. Themost direct means to this end is scripture which, like a powerful medicine,heals man's suffering and, through the revelation of its meaning, extinguishesthe lamp of pain. It is through scripture that Siva's divine vitality (vtrya) ismade to fall into the wombs of liberation, fertilizing them to issue forth intothe new life of the liberated state. Scripture is ultimately the instrumentalcause (nimitta) of liberation and immediately that through which therelationship {sarnbandha) to the teachers of its purport is established andhence with its original source which is Siva himself.The Lord's body is pure consciousness; thus when he wishes to generate thisrelationship through the production of scripture, a movement (pravftti) ariseswithin him that issues out of his transcendental, unmanifest state. Kuntfalini,the power of consciousness and speech latent within him, is aroused by thefullness of the growing intensity of this movement and so straightens to becomea manifest resonance (svara) within consciousness. 7 Siva is in this way filledwith the energy of speech and so assumes the form of the aggregate of all words(sabdarah), here identified with Sada&va who, eternal, {sada) and endowed withSiva's nature, is ever at the upper level {urdhvasthana). Sadasiva reflects uponthe manifest universe as consisting essentially of two categories, namely, the'listener' and 'speaker'. This is the one relationship {sarnbandha) throughwhich the meaning of scripture is communicated. Therefore, although these aretwo aspects of a single reality and the relationship between them is undivided,it is of various types according to the level of its manifestation, namely:Great {mahat): that between consciousness and its power. Subsequent (ananiara):that between Sadasiva and the Viras, Intermediate {avantara): that between hewho awakens and he who isawakened. Divine {divya)\\ The relationship between Sadasiva as he who awakensand divine beings below him up to the level of Maya. Mixed (misra): that betweendivine beings and sages. Other than divine {adivya): that between sages andordinary men. 8Sadasiva as the source of Saiva scripture is in his supreme {para) form. At theintermediate (pardpara) level he is said to be the vitality of yoga and his bodyconsists of the five Mantras associated with his five facesAppendix Cwhich are the sources of the five currents (srotas) of Saiva scripture.* In hislower (apara) form, Sadasiva is the lord of the Mantrapifha and is here said tohave four faces. Now, although the JY itself belongs to the Vidyaplfha, it alsoconsiders the Mantrapifha to be very important and deals with this classextensively. Accordingly, the Mantrapifha is said to be the divine plfha(divyapifha) of the Mudra- and Manila- pifhas of which Sadasiva is also theLord. From Sadasiva's five faces issues the pure knowledge (suddhavijnana)through which the divine Sound (nada) and Drop (bindu) emerge. When thesecombine with the metres, they generate through their rhythm all the iSstras. Thegods first revealed reality (artha) through the Vedic metres (chandas); even soall the scriptures are forms in which Sadaswa embodies himself. Consciousnesshas no form in itself but is said in this way to possess a body made of Mantras,As such, Sadasiva is full of divine powers and has a form (yigraha). Through thefour instruments (karaw) of mind, ego, intellect and speech, he assumes theidentity of the teacher who instructs; while when the fourthinstrument-speech—is substituted by the power of hearing, he becomes thedisciple who listens. He who knows the four instruments is said to be a\"Mana-karunika'V 0 Within these gross bodies is the subtle body (ativahikalinga)governed by the vital breath which moves through the right and left currents ofvitality. In this way the right and left currents of scripture descend into theworld along with a 'mixed' current formed by their conjunction to which theYamalas belong.1, The Pitha DivisionThe JY deals with Agamic Saivism from two points of view. Firstly it enumeratesthe Tantras which belong to the pifhas; then it enumerates the lines oftransmission of the scriptures from master to disciple (santana) and the schools(mafhika) belonging to the currents (srotas) of the scriptures.■ 1 Thus the JYseeks to present a picture of Agamic Saivism and its many different branchesfrom the point of view of both systems of classification. It reserves, however,pride of place for the plfha system as the most fundamental classification ofscripture while the srotas system is, in a sense, devolved to a classificationof groups of Saiva traditions and lines of transmission of doctrines, eachpeculiar to its own parent current. The ideal Saiva master (here the term \"gurw\"is generally used rather than \"acarya\") is one who is conversant with theteaching of all the currents, 12The relationship between the plfha and srotas classifications is peculiar andsomewhat strained. It appears, as we have already hadCanon of Jayadrathayamala105occasion to remark, that it is a system which developed after the classificationinto five currents, at a time when they were reduced to three (see above p. 42ff), namely into 'right', left' and 'mixed* currents and takes over from it as asystem of classification of scriptures as a whole (and as a set of groups towhich the Tantras affiliated themselves), cutting across the distinctions madewithin it. We have already noted that this is happening in the BY*s account ofthe Saiva canon while the following remark in the JY seems to echo the view ofthe BY which, as we shall see, is considered by the JY to be a particularlyimportant Tantra: \"The four pifhas are together said to reside in the right,left and mixed currents as if they were the principal branch in a subsidiarybranch (of the teachings).'* 13Before dealing with the pifhas extensively, Bhairava talks about them in generaland deals with their contents surnmarially, Bhairava starts by listing a numberof synonyms for the word \"plfha\", all of which mean a \"group'* or \"collection 11. 14 The Mantrapifha is associated with masculine words while the Vidyaplfha isassociated with feminine ones. Perhaps by this is implied that the Tantras ofthe Mantrapifha deal more extensively with male deities while those of theVidyaplfha with female ones, as the Svacchandabhairavatantra and the SYM, whichbelong to these two pifhas respectively, exemplify. The Mudrapifha is of threeforms related to mind, speech and body. It is called \"terrible 11 (ghora). TheMa#4ala~ plfha is where all three unite and is said to be undivided. This doesnot mean that the Tantras of this plfha are monistic but rather that it has,according to the JY 1 s account, no subdivisions. Again, the preference the JYhas for the Mantrapifha is evidenced by the way it characterizes it as therepository of the supreme brilliance (paramarfi tejas) which symbolizes thestate of the enjoying subject (bhoktr)> while the Vidyaplfha is the object ofhis enjoyment (bhogya). Mudra includes both of these while Man<Jala is presentin them alU 5To the Mantrapifha (\"beyond which there is nothing\") are said to belong twelvethousand Mantras. It consists essentially of eight Bhairava-tantras, namely, theSvacchanda, Unmatta, Asitanga, Ruru> Carttfa, Krodha, Jhankara and Kapalisa 16with which secondary Tantras are associated. The JY appears to quote a versefrom the Sarvaviratantra recorded by Ksernaraja in his commentary on the SvTwhich states that the Tantras of this plfha are four, namely, the Svacchanda,Carina* Krodha and Vnmatta-bhairavatantrasP The apparent contradiction isreconciled if we understand that what is meant here is that these are the fourmajor Tantras of the Mantrapifha, each of which is linked with one of the fourremaining Bhairavatantras. Consequently the Mantrapifha is said to be two-fold,18The Vidyaplfha is also extensive, 19 The major Tantras listed asAppendix CCanon of Jayadrathayamala107belonging to this plfha are the following: Sarvavira, Samayoga,Siddhayoge$varimata> Pancamrta, Visvadya, YogimjaMawbara, Vidyabheda>Sirascheda> Mahasammohana, Nayottaramd Maharaudra. Then comes a list of Yamalas(it appears that all the Yamalas belong to the Vidyapilha)\\ these are: Rudra,Brahma, Visnu,Skanda t Auma(i.e., Uma), Rudrabheda, Hari and Gautaml yamalas.Firstly, it is interesting to note that the JY itself does not figure amongstthe Yamalas but is separately listed as the Siraicheda* Although eight Yamalasare listed here, in the detailed exposition which follows (see p. i 14 ff,) onlythe first five of them are discussed, of which the BY is considered to be themost important. Eighteen subsidiary Yamalas are said to be associated with them,namely, seven Matfkayamalas, six Yoginiyamaias (beginning with Jay a) and fiveMatryamalas. According to the detailed account of the five Yamalas, four of themare said to generate four others as follows: Brahma - Vetala, Vi$nu - Bana,Rudra - Atharva and Skanda - SarasvatL 20 The standard complement of eightYamalas is thus complete, although these eight are not the ones listed above.Nor are they quite the same as those listed amongst the sixty-fourBhairavataniras (see p. 121 ff.) which are: Brahma, Rudra, Visnu, Skanda,Gautamiya, Atharva, Vetala and Ruruyamala. However, if we identify theRum-yamala with the Rurubheda, only the Uma and Hari-yamalas are missingin this list.The Mudraplfha consists of eighteen thousand Mantras and one hundred and eightKalpas. It has three principal divisions associated with the following rootTantras (sutra): Hrdbheda> Matfbheda and Kubjikamata,The Man4alapifha has only one division belonging to its root sutra and is saidto be sealed by a hundred (i.e., countless) mandates. It appears from the JY'saccount that the Mantfalapifha had little substance of its own (at least at thetime of the redaction of the JY). Essentially, it is considered to be a part ofthe other pifhas, enjoying little autonomous existence of its own as a separatecategory.Finally, the JY refers to another important classification of the scripture, onewe have already discussed at length (see above p. 43 ff.) namely, that intoeight groups of eight (aslasfaka) which, as we shall see, is essentially thesame as we find in the Srikanihiyasamhita.After this brief exposition Bhairava goes on to give a detailed description ofthe contents of these pifhas along with the lines of their transmission.2, MantraplthaThis is basically divided into the Tantras associated with four root 169bTantras or mulasiitras, namely, Svacchanda-, Canda-, Krodha-> andUnmatta-bhairavasuiras.Svacchandabhairavamtra. This is divided into two branches, namely, those ofSvacchanda and Asitanga. The Svacchanda branch was made manifest at the commandof Svacchandabhairava. It consists of eight sections, each taught by a Bhairavastarting with Kankalabhairava and ending with Sitabhairava. The first to hearthese teachings was Ananta who received it through the power of yoga (yogafakti)operating on the Pure Path. They were then adopted by §rikantha and Lakulisa.Lakulapani expounded the teachings extensively to sages like Gautama who knewthe Veda. His best disciple was Musalendra to whom he transmitted the essence ofthe teachings, 21Asitanga, the second branch, was revealed by eight Bhairavas including Asitangaand Kapala to the Anantaviras manifested through them. The teaching was thentransmitted through the ages in various Tantras considered to be schools orbranches (sakha) of the Asitangon-mattasutra. These include Asitanga, Mahanada,Ekapada, Mahodaya, J 70a Bindukapala> Nadendu, Sekhara, Caryamrta, Kalajala,Kalakuja, Mahamrta, Mahaghanghala, Bhairavaghanghala, Mahanirvanayoga,Vicitrabhairava t Bhima, Mahablja and Parampada. 22Cantfabhairavasutra. This sutra is also divided into two sections, namely thosebelonging to Cantfa- and Ruru-Bhairavas. The Cantfabhairava-sutra, which hastwelve Kalpas, was originally revealed to Vikarala, Sirphakesa and to oneother(?) along with eight Viras by Can<Janatha. These sages founded severalschools. This Great Knowledge (mahajnana) was then transmitted by Canaanatha'swill along the following line of teachers.From Sirphakesara to Manohara - Vi$nu — Kausika — Snvatsa - 170b Srlvinasa —Srigarbha — ViSvavaisrava — Saura -* Midhaswami ~~ Subhadra — Munjakesin -Adhok$aja — Medhasas. It was also given to Agastya's circle of masters byVigrahe^a and, by the will of the Srikantha-suris, was transmitted by Bhairavawho gave it to the gods. It was then transmitted to Sakatayana - Pippalada ^Uddalaka - son of Naciketas who brought it into this world with its manybranches (iakha).The Tantras belonging to this sutra&rs twenty-one in number, namelyDantfatanira, Vlratantra, Mahapifha, Supifha, Cangaplfha, Su&ravana, Purakalpa,Cantfogra, Can$amana*ala> Cantfasidhara, Bhutogra (?),Appendix CBhutanigraha, Vijaya, Tripada, Kama, Amogha, Ardhalocana* Patalavijaya,Trailokyavijaya, Mahatfamara and Ghora4amaratantraPKrodhabhairavasutra. This sutra is divided into two main groups—the superior(para) and inferior (apara\\ taught by Krodhabhairava and Jhankara respectively.The Krodhabhairava group has eight branches. The Tantras of these branches weretaught by eight Bhairavas, including Kantibhairava, Sikhasekhara and Rodhina<?), The branch associated with Sarnghatabhairava is also divided into eightbranches taught by eight Bhairavas starting with SaSankasekhara up to Virupaksa.All these branches again have many subdivisions so that the Krodhatantra groupis said to have been transmitted along innumerable lines. Kantabhairava spoke itto Rudronkara and Mahesa while the Krodhograsamhita belonging to this Tantra wastaught by Krodhabhairava himself to KamaleSvara who transmitted it to Bhima whogave it to Jnanabhrt and Amiumati. Again Vimalabhairava gave the Vimalatantra toCandrapitfa, while Krodhesa gave it to Surapi^a and Tarapitfa. (Sikha?)Sekhara-bhairava gave the Krodhamalinisamhita (said to describe many mudras) toAmalesa, while Mahavlrasikhara transmitted it to his disciples on the lowerlevel. The Krodhanalasamhita of one hundred seventy-five thousand verses wastaught by Mayapino'a and AmaleSa; the hundred thousand verse recension wastaught by Bhairava, while Nandin taught the version of twenty million verses. Athis command Bhairava and the goddess taught it to the Balakhilyas. The onethousand eight hundred verse version was taught by Nandinatha, that of seventeen(hundred?) verses by Krodhin(?) and that of eight (hundred?) by Dattatreya,while the third group of eight Vtras gave it to SltamsuSekhara. TheNanajhankara-malimsamhita was received by Visalaja from Jhankara whileKrura-bhairava taught a section of this Tantra called Krodhakarafikinisamhiid toKandarpa. The Binduvijayatantra was imparted to Sasibhusana. Binduklfiratantra(?) was taught by Kalikahladadeva, Samanta received the Yogamalinisamhita fromKrakaca and Sa&kanti gave the Krodha-samvarttaka to Mahasamantadeva. Tarareceived the Mahanadatantra while the Visamak$odhamaiitantra(!) belongs toMahatarapati. The Krodhatantra was transmitted from Tarapati - Sutarapavana-Dhamalila - Jitalavanyaka - Hatakanatha and was finally received by Kalanala.Bhairava concludes this section by defining the term \"krodha\" (meaning literally\"anger\"): \"Anger is said to be that by virtue of which one becomes genuinelyone-pointedly intent on removing whatever obstacle there may be to liberation.\"24 Unmattasutra. Bhairava starts by saying that this root Tantra and itsCanon of Jayadrathayamala109ramifications are but a drop from the infinite ocean of SadaSiva, TheUnmattapaddhati is divided into two lines, each of which is of eight divisionscorresponding to eight Bhairavas. Unmattabhairava taught the Vnmattatantra towhich belong twentymo ne Samhitas, while Kapalisa presides over the second lineof which there are eight principal Sarnhitas, namely: Anantabhairava,Anantavijaya, Bhairava, Para, Vinaiikha, Acalo44is&, Marian4asamhita andCan4ograbhairava. These Samhitas were brought to earth by eight sages amongstwhich only ViSalalocana, Tarapati and Sutara are named, the latter being therevealer of the Martantfasarnhita* These Samhitas are linked to each other andto other Tantras as follows:SUcha - Amfia, Ananda, Pramoda, Anantavijaya 25 Anacala and Amrtananda - Ananda,Gambhira, Jivananda, Sirottara, Sunanda,Martanda - Manthara, Vijayananda, Surananda Candogra - Sadananda, Airitananda,Maiigalananda, Mangala, (Bhairava) - Lelihana, Mahajvaia, Candamaiinl,Karankini, Karala, Karnamula, Kalevara, MahapheikarabijaEach of the Tantras associated with the Unmattabhairavasamhitd have otherTantras associated with them. These are:Lelihana Nityanitya, Anitya, Nitya*Mahajvata Umadeha t Nilakaniha, YoganidraCandamalini Pujodaya, Kurangakfl, Padaktf, Citrakandhara,Karankini Two extensive Sarnhitas - not named.Karala Nigraha, DhvastavighnaKarnamula Vighna* Sudiptabhava.Kalevara Samaya, K$udrd.Phetkara Vimala, Siva.173aThe Vnmattatantra of the first line was transmitted by Unmattabhairava (?) tothe gods starting with the five Sivas ($ivapancaka). From Suddhavidya it wastransmitted in a version of three hundred and fifty (chapters?) to Dhyanaharawho taught it to Prapanca, then to KunaV bhadra and Sikhesa who gave it to Bhlra(?).Bhairava then explains that he assumed the form of Unmattabhairava when hebecame mad with passion at the sight of Dak§ayantkalL A seed-syllable issuedfrom him in this state from which Bhairava was generated in his terrible (ghora)form. The goddess, his consort (jaya\\ saw him then and after coupling with himasked him for the knowledge whose awesomeAppendix Cpower assumes the Extremely terrible 1 (mahaghora) form of Unmatta-bhairava.Pleased with her, Bhairava spoke the Jayatanira of twelve thousand verses. ThisTantra has five versions (kalpa) of six thousand, three thousand, one thousandeight hundred, eight hundred and seventy-five, and five (or five hundred?)verses.Before concluding this section on the Mantrapifha with the affirmation that itis very extensive, Bhairava states that the Bhairava-tantra was brought down toearth by the eight sages: Durvasas, Sanaka, Jisnu, Kapila, KaSyapa, Kuru,Samvarta and Sankhapala.3, The VidyapithaThe Vidyapitha is said to be closely connected to the MantrapUha, The account ofits contents is basically divided into three sections. Firstly, a brief outlineof these sections and their contents:The Saktitaniras belonging to the Middle Current These are the Sarvavira,Trisula (i.e., the SYM), Sricakra, Visvadya, Yoginijala-karnbara, Vidyabheda andSirohfta (i.e., Sirascheda)™The Tantras belonging to the Left CurrentMahasarnmohana. 21Nayottara, Maharaudra,The Tantras belonging to the Right Current These are basically the Yamalas ofwhich five are the root texts. Of these, four are in a group of 174a their own,namely Raudra-, Auma~, Vaisnava- and Skanda-yamalas,The fifth is the Brahmayamala which is said to expound \"the conduct whichinvolves the use of rotten flesh\" (kravyacara) whereas the others do not. It isalso called \"Picumata, \" \"Dvayak$ara\" or just \"Mata.\" Seven other root Tantras(sutra) are associated with it, namely Ucchu$ma, Niracara> Mahacara,$arvatobhadra, n Dvika, Sarvatmaka and Mahadakma. The last Tantra is dividedinto two sections. Thus there are eight Tantras altogether and as these are allMatatantras they are called the \"Eight Matas\" (matatfaka).After concluding that there are fifteen root Tantras (mulasutra) in theVidyapitha, the JY moves on to a more detailed treatment of each of them.The Sarvavlratantra. This Tantra was revealed by Mahadeva and transmitted alongthe following line: Daksjmi - Mahavlra - Pracantfa -Kankala - Nllakantha -Bhairava - consort - Garutmat - Dasa-khan4ara - Ravana and Vibhlsana - Patanga -Bhavapapin who thenCanon of Jayadrathayamala111transmitted it to men.The basic form of this Tantra (mulasutra) is said to be of three hundred andfifty (chapters?), its concise (samgraha) version is called \"sahasra\" whichpresumably means that it is one thousand verses long. Other versions consist ofsixteen thousand, twelve thousand and twenty-four thousand verses. Altogetherthis Tantra is said to be over one hundred thousand verses long and has beenheard, spoken and transmitted many times.The Siddhayoge&varimata. This Tantra has three (sections/versions?) taught bythree different teachers, namely; Para by Mahendra, Parapara by Bhi$ma and Aparaby Siddhayogin.A number of Tantras, all of which are said to be two hundred and fifty(chapters?) long, are associated with the SYM and transmitted by variousteachers. These are:174bRudrasThe Siddhayogesvarltantra was transmitted along the following line: Srikantha —Ksudra ~~ Amrtabindu (\"Binduparapitr) - Vipra — Bhairava -consort — Kr$oa —Umapati — Vedasiras ~- Ahgiras — Utathya — Ordhvaretas who taught it to men.TheSricahratantra. Eight Cakrasamhitas are associated with this Tantra, namely:Svaracakra, Varnacakra, Nadicakra, Guhyacakra, Kalacakra, Sauracakra,Vahneyacakra and Somajacakra. 29 Siva 'resounds* (svarati) 175a and is manifestin the Svaracakratantra while Varnacakra deals withAppendix CMantra. Nadlcakra (also called Sutara) and the Guhyacakra deal with the natureof Sakti. There are two Kalacakratantras.both are said to deal with the durationof man's life (Syus). One of the two is Saura and said to be auspicious (subha);the other is Buddhist and is considered to be inauspicious (asubha).Vahneyacakra is said to be 4 enflamed' {dipta) by Mantra while the teachings ofSomajacakra (also called \"Candatantra\") destroy death.The Paficamrtatantra. The only information supplied about this root Tantra isthe line of its transmission which is: Sakti - yoginls, ganas, gods and snakes -Prahlada - Ausanasena - Bhargava - Devala -Krsnatreya (\"who knew the Vedas\") -Kusadhvaja - Sitoda -Patadra (?) - Dantya.The Visvadyatantra. This Tantra is named \"ViSvadya\"because it teaches the natureof the group of yoginls (yoginljala) starting with the one named 175b Visva. Theline of transmission is as follows: Sadasiva - Visvatman -Vimaladrsa -Kanticchatra - Saundin - Bhairava - Sakti who hid it. A few of the Mantras ofthis Tantra were known to Kilaheli who learned them from Sakti and transmittedthem to the world of men. Yogimjalasamhara, There are twelve Tantras associatedwith this root Tantra: Mahasamvarttaka, Bhlma, Tilaka, Nakha, Bimba,Candralekha, Candasitaka, Silada, Bhagamala, Bhoginl, Sukesin and Sudhama™ 'Associated with these Tantras are twenty Upasamhttas: Taraka, 176a Akfi,Pasaghni, Nandini, Gamini, Bhrgwl Satya, DakfSyani, Uma, Maya, MahakW, Cavdali,Acalasri, Bhadrakall, Sumedha, Tara, Arkamani, Tarakabhamna, Raudri andJvalamalantika.The line of transmission of the Yoginljalasambara is as follows:Mahasamvartanatha - Bhlma - Tailaka - DIrghanakhin - Bimba -Candavrddha -Candasilataka - Silada - Bhagamahn - Bhagini -Vira - Sukesin - Sudhama -Jvalamukhantika - Bhairava - Sakti -Urdhvaretas — Ananta.The Yoginljalasambaratantra is said to the glory of the Anantasrotas.The Vidyahhedatantra. Seven Samhitas are associated with this Tantra taught byas many teachers; these are:Canon of Jayadrathayamala113Vidyesana AmsaphaiaVidyaprasuii TridantfiSix of these Samhitas have not yet beeji revealed. n Bhairava will give 176bthem to the world in the last age (yuga).The Siraichedatantra* This Tantra is taught by Bhairava himself in the lastaeon. It is the last of the seven root Tantras of this Current to come to earthand also belongs equally to the Right and Left Currents- It is expressly said tobe a Yamalatantra and is also called \"Jayadratha\" or \"$at$ahasra, \" It wastransmitted from Mina(?) — Narasirpha -* Yoginf -Daivavatsyaikacaksus — Sukra, Anumber of Tantras are associated with it;Hie Sairughnatantra was transmitted by Satrumardana — Ekaksa -> Kala and Minawho divided it into two sections {skandha). Bhairava received it in the form ofthe Kalabhedaianira (also called Kala-sarrikar$aria)> He taught it to hisdbnsort and to Yatudhanadhipa and Vrnadarakamuni. It was transmitted through hisdivine power in countless sections (skandha).The Satymohanatantra. Once when the Lord of the Demons, in alliance 177a withthe Heroes and the circle of Mothers, was fighting the gods, he drank the sacrednectar and became drunk. In this state he started to dance while the Mothers,headed by CakrakaralinI, began to devour the circle of the gods along withBhairava who presides over it. Siva, aware of the danger, emitted into the oceanof wine a Lotus of Power of four petals on which sat the goddesses Jaya, Vijaya,Jita and Aparajita with their brother, Tumburu, seated in the centre. Theyplayed upon their virias and the terrible circle of Mothers, attracted by themusic, desisted from their intent. 32 It was the same Tumburu, skilled both inplaying the viria and vocal music, who, along with his four sisters, brought theMaha-sammohanatantra to earth.The line of transmission of this Tantra is as follows: Tumburu — 177bAppendix CMahesana - Sammohana - Ananta - Trimurti - Dundubhi -Nllakaniha, NTlarudra wasanother teacher of this Tantra. He had a large number of disciples who were alsoconversant with the sixty-four Bhairavatantras.^ These all belonged to theBhargava branch of the line of transmission.Associated Tantras.

The sages Sukra and Angiras received this Tantra andbrought it down into the world, transmitting it to Candrasekhara. A number ofrelated Tantras are listed: Trailokyamohana, Bimba, Ddnavdrivimohana,Tarakabhyudaya, Samgrdmavijaya, Nayasdra, Tilaka, Koldhala, Amburdsi, Capamall,Mrgadhvaja, Ndrdyana and Vasatk&ra.The Maharaudratantra. The deity of this Tantra is called Maharaudra or Ruru(bhairava). He taught this Tantra to Sarva - Rudra - Samvarta -Cauda and Saundin- Ardhanarisa who taught a short version to Bhrnga.182b The Vamalas. The term \"yamala\" which literally means \"a couple in union\"and commonly refers to the coupling of the god with his consort, is here given aspecial meaning as the union of Mantra and Vidya. The implication here is thatthese works deal with both the ritual formulas corresponding to and embodyingthe gods (as Mantras) as well as the goddesses (as Vidyas), 35 Again theseoperate in the domain of another couple, namely, knowledge {jnana), which isboth insight into ultimate principles and an understanding of the methodsdescribed in the Tantras, together with action (kriya) which is the applicationof this knowledge. They depend on one another. 36 The goal of spiritualendeavour is achieved by following the teachings of the Yamalas, dealing as theydo with these four topics.1795 The Brahmayamata, The root of all the Yamalas is considered to be theBrahmayamala. it has three principal divisions called Raurava, Andhaka andKanaka. The Visnu, Skanda and Rudmyamalas belong to these three respectively.The four Vedas are said to originate from them along withCanon of Jayadrathayamala115the Vmaydmala? 1 The Brahmayamata has many other secondary divisions and manyTantras are associated with it. It is said to partake of the character of allfive sroias and is also called \"Picumata.\" The word \"Picu\" is said to consist oftwo units, namely, \"Pi\" which means \"body\" 179b (pin<ja) and \"cu\" which means\"seed\" (blja): a true yogin is one who unites these two elements, that is, hisbody with the seed of consciousness. Again, \"Pi\" denotes menstrual flow(kdminipuspa) and \"cu\" the male seed (retas). The repeated union of these two inconjunction with the performance of the appropriate ritual (kriya) andrecitation of Mantra is considered to be Picu. \"Pi\" is also said to denote thefemale organ (yonf) while \"cu\" is the male seed. This seed—called \"vindu\"—is theomniscient knower-™'vid\\ It is the supreme seed of consciousness.The BY is the main Matatantra and has eight Matatantras associated with it.These, along with the teachers who brought them to earth and anutantrasassociated with them, are as follows: 38MatatantraAnutantraTeacherBindusara Rakta° Utpala 0Kapalin Pecika 0 (Hedamata) KaralinlmataHetuyana (?) Mrgalinlmata (Vrkadaya) AitreyaSiva Sambara SarasvataUtphullaka 39 Kaiasara + Muku^aNllakesin Nilakesa LampataBharudI Bharunda KalakhyaKau&kl Pingala * Picusara and NayodayaAssociated with the eight anutantras are eight paritisfatantras. How these i gOaare linked is not always made clear. They are Panedlika (linked with theUtpalaiantra), Manava (associated with the Vdgdvalitantra), Kardlimata and its'sdrasamgraha', Laksmi (associated with the Kalakhya), Vimala (associated withthe Lampafatantra), Kacchapi (associated with the Kampakuhadrutantra) andGarbhaprakarana (associated with the Nayodayatantra).From the parisistatantras originate the upasutras. These are Asvapluta, Sdranga,Gojika (?), Bhedavipluta, Vaibhanga, Mdtanga, Kusumati and Savitraka,All these Tantras are the root ancilliaries (mulaparis'ista) of the BY. Alongwith them are seven misrasutras which are said to belong to all five currents ofscripture. These are Musfi, Kusa, Lava, Kaiasara, Ambika, Tilaka and Avadhuta.Appendix CBhairava now goes on to discuss an interesting matter which concerns both theexegesis of these Tantric texts and how they are conceived to be related to oneanother. Bhairava explains that there are five types of basic Tantras (sutra)which disclose the different levels of meaning of the teachings, 40 These are asfollows:Mulasutra: This is the root Tantra, There are different root Tantras for eachpifha. 41 Each one is supposed to deal extensively with the teachings of a giventradition as a whole. It is the text which indicates (sucaka) the entire extentof the doctrines and ritual procedures of its tradition.Guhyasutra: The Tantras of this type discuss the hidden esoteric meaning of theteachings.Nayasutra: These Tantras deal with how the adept is likely to fall from the pathand lose the attainments he has already acquired (siddhi) and how he can getthem back,Uitarasutra: This discusses and clarifies the intended sense of the teachings asdetermined by these sutras.The Uttarottarasutra: This elucidates and supplements what remains to beunderstood or has, inadvertently, not been dealt with fully in the previous foursutras, It is said to teach the ultimate purport of these scriptures just as itis inherently in itself and beyond all thought-constructs (nirvikalpa).It is the teacher's responsibility to expound the meaning of the scripturesclearly. He does this by connecting their sense into a coherent whole through anumber of correlates (sambandha) he establishes between their contents. He dealswith the root Tantras individually at first in order to bring out the underlyingcoherence between them and their associated Tantras, and to then ideallyestablish it between all the sutras and their teachings. According to the JY,there are five correlates which, by implication, it juxtaposes with the fivetypes of sutras. These are:Indication (sitcana): The teacher summarizes what has been taught before and onthe basis of that indicates what is going to be taught further.Preliminary Exposition (abhidhana)Validation (gamaka): The teacher now gradually unfolds the meaning of the sutra.In order to make it clear, he makes use of examples and refutes possibleobjections.Clarification (prakasaka): This follows from the previous correlate.Canon of Jayadrathayamala117Ordering the Disordered {sankirna): In order to explain the meaning of a Tantra,the teacher must distinguish between the sections of it which deal withparticular matters. As he proceeds from one chapter to the next of the Tantra,he points out where one topic begins and another ends. He deals first with eachsection individually and then indicates how they are related to the others.Other Agamas also deal with these correlations in their own way. Abhinavadevotes a section of his Tantraloka to an explanation of how the teacher shouldtransmit the meaning of the scriptures to his disciples (vyakhyavidhi) 41Abhinava bases himself mostly on the Devyayamala which Jayaratha accordinglyquotes extensively in his commentary. Paraphrasing this Tantra, Abhinava startsby saying that there are five kinds of teachers:Those who know just one Katpa, that is, a version of a given root Tantra or aTantra associated with it.Those who know the entire range of Kalpas associated with a given Tantra.Those who know all scriptures belonging to a given class (sastra).Those who know the meaning of all the Samhitas.Those who know all the classes of scriptures. 43The best teacher is, of course, one that belongs to the fifth group. However, ifa student cannot find a teacher who knows the scriptures in their entirety, heshould seek a teacher who is well conversant with the particular Tantra hewishes to learn and whose teachings he seeks to put into practice.The Devyayamaia, like the JY, says that there are five correlates through whichthe teacher can explain the meaning of a Tantra with reasoned argument in orderto preserve the doctrines of his own tradition (svamnaya). These are:The Sections ipada): Theoretically a Tantra of the Samhita type is divided intofour sections, called pada. The teacher must first explain the overall sense ofthe Tantra. He does this by dealing with each one of these sections, explainingtheir contents in general terms in the order in which they appear in thebeginning, middle and end of each section.The Coherence of Each Section (pddagata): The teacher should explain how eachpart of each section fits with every other in a coherent mannerAppendix Cand without contradictions.The Chapters (pafala): The teacher can now explain the contents of the Tantrachapter by chapter and in so doing connect one to the other.The Meaning of the Words (padartha); The teacher now explains each statement inthe Tantra individually.The Meaning of the Sutra: The teacher can now dea! with the entire root Tantra.He reflects on its overall content, distinguishing it from other sutras, inorder to elucidate its unique character in relation to other sutras 44Although the divisions into grades of sutras is more theoretical than real, itis interesting to observe how the Agamas attempted to find through it coherencein their extensive and diverse literature. Certainly some Tantras were moreclosely linked to each other than were others; even so we can't help feelingthat we have here an ideal scheme. We can compare this scheme with the BuddhistTantras which do, in fact, tend to develop in this way, at least in part.Perhaps we might hazard to suggest that the Saiva Tantras took over this schemeas a theoretical possibility which did, in a partial way reflect an aspect ofthe relationship between the Tantras and their traditions.The Rudrayamala. Eleven Samhitas are associated with the Rudra-yamala:Arthasdra, Suradharma, Daityaghni, Vlrarthina, Virasara, Raudri, Mudrantamalini,Kalottara> Kataghni, Mahdmrtunjaya and Candabhaira va. 4$180a The Vmayamala. The line of transmission of this Yamala is as follows:Sada&va - Kapallsa - Svacchanda - Krodha - Ucchusma -Rum -Carxlabhairava -Unmatta - Virabhairava - Ananta - Bhaskara -* Manthana - Nilakantha - Bhlma -Vamaka - Mahakala - Visnu ™* Munlndra — Sandilya.Associated with this Yamala are the following Samhitas: Trimuntfim, Bahurupa,Ucchusma, Can4a, Pronmatta, Virabhairava, Anantamata, Anantabhdskara, Trnaka (?)and Ananiavijaya. A group of four Samhitas collectively called \"rupa\"are said tobe derived from the Ananiavijaya. These are Bhimd> Varna, Mahakall andGrdhrapatl Along with these scriptures is the Kalavadanasamhitd of twenty-onethousand verses and the Visnupasarnhita of six thousand verses. TheDurdarsanasamhita (also called Sudadana) of three thousand five hundred verseswas brought to earth by Sandilya,181b Skandayamata. This Tantra, also called the \"Sendpatiyamala\", wasCanon of Jayadrathayamala119transmitted along the following lineage: Tejodhaman — Prthusiras ~~ Samadrsa ->Visvabhuk — Visavaiayagola — Bhairava ~~ Consort — Visakha - Kunjaramukha —Sambhadra — Vlrabhadra — Ugracarrcla — Mahendra — Candrarkavayumuni -~ Manugana.The Samhitas associated with this Yamala are Gauhasphanda, Analakaniha,Visacchadd, Saisava, Mayurasikhd, Ramanodbhava, Varada and Liloipatamalikd.Vmayamala. The line of transmission of this Yamala is as follows (Bhagarudra)Bhairava — Asitadrsa (Krsnaksa) ™~ Yamantaka — Pingalesa ~~ Hurnkara —Sarikukarna — Pihgala — Mrtyunjaya.There are eight Samhitas associated with this Yamala and they are said to belongto all four plfhas. These are Uma, Rauravi, Bhlma, Gambhlra, Langala,Matryananda, Surdnanda and Bhairavdnanda.The Vmayamala is supposed to have originated from the Sorna-yamala whilecountless other ydmalas are supposed to be derived from the other ones. Theseinclude four Devatayamalas, four Dutibhavaydmalas, four Kinkiniydmalas, sixYoginiydmalas, eighteen Bhimaydmalas, ten Qdkinlydmalas and a number ofMdtrydmaias.182a4. The MudrapifhaThe Mudrdpitha is also called the Kriyasutra, probably because Mudrd is amanifestation of the power of action (Kriydsakti) just as Mantra is amanifestation of the ppwer of knowledge. The revealer of the Tantras of thispitha is Bhairava who also created the sixty-four Bhairavatantras. The Mudrawhich the Tantras of this pitha are said to disclose is the Gesture or Seal ofEmptiness (vyomamayi mudrd). It is one's own authentic nature (svasvabhdva) thatis self-established and delights in eternal bliss. This seal is 'stamped* ontoall the relationships between the categories of existence and melts away allbodily bondage. When it descends onto the level of the empirical world wheremeditation and its object are distinct, it is variously conceived and so assumescountless forms. Three root Tantras belong to this pitha:Hfdbheda. All the JY tells us about this Tantra is the line of its transmissionwhich is as follows: Phetkarabhairava — Kantichatra — ? — Prapalambha -Niranjana — Vyapin — Vigrahesvara - Bhairava -> goddess who revealed a shortversion to mankind,Matfbheda. Bhairava explains that this Tantra is so-called because it 183bexalts the mother (matr) in whom and by whom all the universe is-T^120Appendix Cmeasured (mapila) and saved {iranita) and of whom there are many diverse forms(bheda), 46 There are five Samhitas associated with the Matrbheda, namelyAparajita, Vastuvidya, Sarvabimba, Karotini, Siddhasarariha, Citrartha (?). 47184a TheKubjikamata* The KMT is said to have originated in the mountains. 48 Itis considered to be the most important Tantra of the Mudrapitha although it islinked with all the pifhas. This is the Tantra of the goddess Kubjika. She isthe power Beyond Mind (manonmam) who, in the bliss of loving union {samplava),withdraws her limbs to form the divine triangle of the Seed (blja). Drop (bindu)and Sound (nada) through which the universe is created. The KMT is said to dealwith the Seal of Speech (vacika mudra). This is of countless forms although itconsists essentially of the fifty letters of the alphabet. It denotes themeaning of countless words and indicates the true nature of things leading thusto its realization. The sections (or associated texts) of this Tantra areEkaksara, Dvyaksara f Padamala, Sabdamata, Sabdamalartha, Mdlinl, Vdkyamdld andVidyamala,5* MandalapitfiaThis ptiha is said to be equally present (samanya) in the other three pifhas.Although it has only one mulasutra, which is not named here, it is divided inmany parts (kalpa). The line of transmission is as follows: Pancasekhara whobrought it to earth transmitted it to Ratisekhara -Samharabhairava - DinoU —Dantfesvara — Ghoreya — Gomati -Trikala — Srlkantha - Bhairava - Brahma whoheard it in each plfha.6, The 'Eight Times Eight' BhairavatantrasAfter the goddess has been told about the contents of the four pifhas associatedwith Bhairava, she then wants to know about the sixty-four Bhairavatantras saidto constitute the Wheel governed by Sadasiva. These Tantras are listed belowalong with the names of their teachers who are considered to be incarnations ofBhairava. The ordering of the eight groups is just as we find it in the §KS (seeabove p. 45 ff.). Moreover, more than half of the Tantras listed in the SKS arethe same as those listed here. We have therefore recorded their names in aseparate column as shown in Table 9.Table 9, The Sixty-Four Bhairavatantras.Table 9.

The Srotas DivisionThe JY knows and accepts the standard classification of the Saivagama into fivecurrents and even explicitly states that this is the original basic form of thecanon. 50 However, it also refers to a sixth Upper Current which we shalldiscuss later, Each of these six Currents is here analysed in terms of thetransmission of the teachings of the Tantras belonging to them. They are, inother words, distinguished from one another on the basis of the teachers (guru)and traditions (santati, santdna) associated with them. 51 Each of Sadasiva'sfive faces (with the sixth Current above them) is accordingly linked with afamily of lineages technically called \"gotra\" to which belong various lines oftransmission (santati). The members of each Current (or gotra) undertake vows(vrata) and practice their own particular disciplines (caryd) which the JYenumerates for each in serial order, Again, each Current has its own monasticcentres called mafhikastIt is not essential to list all these names here; we shall limit ourselvesinstead to making a few observations. Firstly, it is worth noting that theAgamas understand themselves as transmitted doctrine not just as scripture. Itis the living tradition that matters and hence also the teacher who preservesand passes it on to his disciples. Although each Current has its teachers, theideal teacher according to the Bhairavdgamas is one who knows all six Currents,He alone can explain the teachings of each Current along with their esotericmeaning. 55 The personal imparting of the teaching to a small group of disciplesentails the existence of numerous monastic centres, each of which is headed byits own teacher who can bequeath it to his successor. 53 Some of these monasticcentres came to prominence and acquired an importance in their own right. TheKashmiri tradition, for example, associates the dualist, monist and qualifiedmonistic schools of Saivism with three mafhikas named after Tryambaka, Amardakaand Srlnatha respectively, 54 The word \"mathika\" thus comes ultimately to denotea particular school of thought associatedAppendix Cwith the founder of the monastic centre from which it was propagated.The JY, as we have said, accepts the basic Five Current division of theSaivagamas. However, although it does classify them in these terms, it does notconcern itself to do so in detail. The Siva and Rudra division of theSiddhantagamas are said, as usual, to consist of ten and eighteen Agamasrespectively. The Left Current consists of the Tantras which 'delude* 55 whichis clearly an allusion to the Sawrnohanatantra that is regularly considered tocharacterize the scriptures of this Current. The Current of the Right contains,amongst others, the sixty-four Bhairava-tantras and the Yamalas. To this Currentalso belong the SvT and the entire Mantra and Afudrapitha. 56 The Garuda andBhutatantras are characterized in the usual way as concerned with remedies forpoison and with exorcism respectively, 57 They are ascribed, as usual, to theEastern and Western Currents. 58 The Tantras of the Left Current are said todeal with the acquisition of the eight yogic powers (siddhi) and power tocontrol others, 59 while the Right Current is the eternal non-dual abode of allthe pleasures of this world and every type of liberation. 60The Sixth Current is above the others. It belongs particularly to Siva's powerthrough which all the traditions and their teachings are revealed in this world.61 Siva is the root source of all the Agamas; infinite and full of the knowledgeof consciousness he is both omniform and tranquil like a waveless sea. His poweris his vitality (viryd) whose field is the delight of the abode of consciousnessand is beautiful with its blissful pulsation generated through the diversity ofits immanently manifest and transcendentally unmanifest forms. 62 This vitalityis Speech at all levels 63 and pours out of universal consciousness in countlessextensions (prasaro) of its power of which the six Currents of scripture are themain streams. 64 Full of this divine power at its very source the Sixth Currentleads to realization in an instant with great force Qia(hdt) and so the form ofSiva that governs it is Hathakesvara, He is said to know the mysteries of Kulaand Kaula and so all the secret teachings originate from here. Consequently thisCurrent is present in those of the Left and Right. 65 Moreover, although itflows in the upper regions (urdhva) it is also connected with the lower ones aswell,.that is, with those frequently assigned, as we have seen, to the Kulagama.Thus Hathakesvara's domain is said to be \"the abode of the fire of time\" whichburns in the hells below the world-order. The SvT confirms that Hataka is thename of the Lord of Sauvarr^a which is the eighth and lowest hell 66 while theJY tells us that all the lords of the hells (patalanayaka) are born fromHa$hake£vara*s mouth, 67 According to a passage quoted by Abhinavagupta from theRauragama® when Snkartf ha resides in the hell worlds he assumes the form ofHataka because he bestows yogic powers suddenly and with great force (hafhatafy)whileCanon of Jayadraihayamala125the JY expressly states that the Upper Current \"bestows all yogic powers. 1 'The Anandadhikaratantra m declares that Hataka is the lord of the hell wheresouls burn in the \"fire of time.\" This place is destined for those initiates whohave broken their pledges and, more especially, for those who, although votariesof the Left-hand Path, censor it. Here, according to this Tantra, go those whohave been taught higher doctrine but have, nonetheless, resorted to lowerteachings or Mantras of a lower order such as those practised by the devotees ofGaru^a. They can, however, free themselves of their suffering by offeringthemselves to Lord Hataka and so reach the higher divine principles and then,from there, ultimately merge into Siva, 708. ConclusionAccounts such as these not only teach us a great deal about the extent of theAgamic corpus but also about its history and, consequently, about the history ofthe development of Agamic Saivism. We should, however, treat these accounts withcaution. As we have seen, all the major Agamas have their own peculiar view ofthe Saiva canon and, although their accounts are in many ways compatible andeven supplement each other, none of them are either complete or unbiased.Moreover, they give rise to many questions which still remain unsettled. Thus,we cannot help asking ourselves whether all these Tantras did, in fact, exist.For example, although the eight Bhairava Tantras are generally considered toform a standard group, it is by no means certain whether they all existed.Certainly the Svacchandatantra, at least, does and possibly a number of othersbut it is hard to believe that all the Tantras said here to have been associatedwith them did as well Bhairavas are commonly worshipped in groups of eight whilethe group which has given its name to these Tantras is particularly well known.It is hard not to suspect that these lists are not entirely genuine when wenotice that groups of eight are such recurrent features in them. May it not bethe case that some of these titles are purely fictitious additions to fill outideal schemes? We can only be sure that a Tantra existed when we find additionalevidence to corroborate the statements made in accounts such as these. We must,for example, find direct quotations from it, or reference to it in independentsources such as inscriptions. Best of all, of course, would be to find the textitself or fragments of it.Again, how genuine are the names listed in the lines of transmission of theseTantras? Certainly the gods, divine beings and Upani§adic sages who figure inthese accounts cannot be considered to be historical figuresAppendix Cconnected with them. Even so, it is not impossible that the last few members ofthese lines did, in fact, live at some time and propagated these Tantras;perhaps, indeed, they even wrote them. It is worth noting, however, that theaccount of the line of transmission given here of the SYM and its own account aspresented by Abhinavagupta in the Tantraloka do not agree. This fact should putus on our guard to deal cautiously with what these account tell us because ourknowledge of the extent and content of even the extant Tantras is still verysuperficial. Even so, there can be little doubt that future research will reveala vast field of inquiry and that these accounts of the Saivagamic canon willserve as important guidelines by which we may orient ourselves in the course ofwork to help us to locate ourselves in this vast body of literature.Appendix DManuscripts of the KubjikatantrasFor almost twenty years German scholars have been directing a project tophotograph manuscripts in Nepal Amongst the many thousands of manuscripts thathave been photographed so far, there are many of Tantras and related literaturebelonging the the Kubjika school. Unfortunately, no descriptive catalogue of themanuscripts the project has photographed has as yet been prepared and, due tothe amount of material collected, it will probably take a great deal of time toproduce. In the meantime, in order to make part of this new material morereadily accessible, we have listed below some manuscripts relevant to the studyof the Kubjika cult. This list is by no means exhaustive. For one thing, I havehad the opportunity to consult only the index cards of the microfilms made ofmanuscripts belonging to the National Archives in Kathmandu. I have not had thetime to see index cards of the numerous manuscripts in private collections theproject has photographed and so they could not be listed here. Nor have shorttracts with generic titles such as \"Kubjikapuja\"bcen included, both because theyare very many and also because it is impossible to assess their content or valuewithout seeing them. For the same reason I have had to list many manuscripts ofsections of the MBT as \"unidentified.'* I have also not listed manuscripts ofthe KMT (also called Kulatikamnaya) because it has already been edited byGoudriaan and Schoterman. A few entries, such as the important Safsahasra, arelisted without reel numbers. This is because it appears that the project hasfailed to photograph these manuscripts although they are listed in thecatalogues.Scholars who are interested in acquiring further information should contact theNepal Research Centre, New Baneshwar, P.O.

Schoterman. jayarathaquotes an unknown Agama which refers to the Thohakasamata of the Pascimamnaya:madyariktastu ye devi na te siddhyanti pascime | thohakasamate nityamkulabhrastah svayarnbhuvahj(TA, vol. Xlb, p. 13).In the following verse, quoted by Jayaratha in his commentary on theVamakesvarimata from an older commentary by the Kashmiri Aliata, Kubjika, thegoddess of the Pascimamnaya, is mentioned:urmiriti bhoginltyapi kubjeti kulesvarlti jagaduryam | srikalakarsanltyapikun^aiinltyapi ca naumi tarn devlm ||(VMT, p. 28).Another reference is found in the following passage which Jayaratha quoteswithout naming his source: \"The triangle is called the female organ (bhaga), thesecret circle in the Sky. Its corners are will, knowledge and action and in itscentre is the sequence (krama) of CincinL\" (TA, vol II, p. 104).The worship of the absolute viewed as the source of cosmic manifestationsymbolized by the female organ from whence arises the power of Kuntfalini is animportant feature of the Tantras of the Pascimamnaya. Kubjika, the SupremeGoddess, is frequently called Cincini (see below p. 90). In a hymn to Bhagam theCincinimaiasarasamuccaya we find the same verse. Thus, the first line ofJayaratha*s quote reads:trikonam bhagam ityuktam viyatstham guptamano'alam |In the CMSS (fl. 10b; line 1):bhagam trikonavikhyatam dhiyastham guptamandalam |The second line is identical.We cannot be sure that Jayaratha quoted this verse from the CMSS, but there canbe little doubt that he drew it from a Tantra of the same school.Also, in the KNT a sudra named Srasehila, whose initiatory name wasRamanandanatha, is listed as being a follower of the Pascimamnaya who lived inKashmir. Bagchi KJN, p. 69.Notes to Pari One13924. Although the SvT is a Bhairavatamra and not a Siddhani agama, theinitiations and other ritual procedures it describes are similar to those of theSiddhanta, Consequently, Somasambhu (eleventh century) incorporates a great dealof material from the SvT in his compendium of Siddhanta ritual, theKramakandakramavath better known as the Somasambhupaddhati. Composed in SouthIndia, this manual is the oldest one still extant. Although no longer in use,Aghorasivacarya's Kriyakramadyotika (written in 1158 A.D.), which is stillpopular in South India, follows the SSP very closely. Brunner in her notes onthe SSP frequently refers to the SvT without thereby contravening her principlenot to quote from Agamas whose rituals differ radically from these of the SSP.The SvT, which she describes as a revealed text of Kashmiri Saivism (SSP, vol.Ill, intro! p. liv), evidently inspired Somasambhu. Brunner notes that a numberof cosmological concepts and forms of yoga the Siddhanta does not know abouthave passed from the Northern to the Southern Agamic schools through this text(ibid). But even though the SvT adds something new to Siddhanta ritual, it isclearly compatible with it and shares much in common with it, even in matters ofdetail Indeed, old South Indian authorities on Siddhanta ritual refer to itfrequently as does, for example, Nirmalamani in his commentary on Aghorasiva'smanual ViSvanatha in his Siddhaniasekhara and Isanasivagurudeva in hispaddhatigo so far as to prefer, at times, to follow the SvTin matters of detailconcerning ritual and cosmography rather than the Siddhantagamas (S§P, vol III,p. 185).25, Jayaratha more than once refers his reader to a teacher for informationabout matters he feels that he cannot elaborate, particularly the secret detailsof Kaula ritual Thus when dealing with how the sacrificial vessel should befilled in the course of a Kaula rite he says:yasca atra etat pQrane sarnpradayali sa rahasyatvat samayabhanga-bhayac ca naiha asmabhirj pradarsita iti | etad gurumukhad eva boddhavyam |(TA, vol XIb,p.I9).Such passages indicate that differences of opinion prevailed about practice inhis day (see also TA, vol Xlb, pp. 40™1), clearly proving that these ritualswere actively performed in Kashmir at that time. There is ample evidence thatKashmir was a society where Kaula ritual was an active concern of anappreciable, although probably small, part of the populace. This, as one wouldexpect, charmed and pleased sincere Saivites of Abhinavagupta's stamp who wroteenthusiastically about Kaula ritual in Kashmir. Thus, in a poetic vein, hepraises the wine Kaulas drink;"},{"pageContent":"[This is] the wine which imparts boldness to the words of lovers and frees themfrom fear while making love; the wine in which all the deities [ofconsciousness] who reside in the shade of the tree of the Kali age and practicemystic union {cakracarya) gladly abide; the wine which here [in Kashmir] bestowsfirst pleasure then liberation. (TA, 37/44).But not all thought so highly of these practices. We know that bans wereNotesimposed and practising Kauias ostracized. Some, such as the satirist Ksemendra,who lived in Kashmir at the time, considered Kaula ritual and practice to bemerely a source of moral corruption and an excuse for licence. See my Doctrineof Vibration, vol I SUNY Press, Albany, 1987, chapter 1.26. For definitions of the word 'Tantra\" see Tantra in Bengal: A Study in ItsOrigins, Development and Influence by S. C. Banerji, Naya Prakash, Calcutta1978, pp. 1-3.27. Renou remarks that the later Tantric texts Woodroffe studied that \"describethe worship of the great Goddess\" are called \"Tantras\" rather than \"Agamas\"(preface to SSP, vol. I, p. 1), Brunner notes, however, that in the earlySiddhantagamic context the terms \"Agama\" and \"Tantra\"are synonymous (ibid.,intro. p. iv.). Thus we find the following definition of Tantra, which has beenrepeated frequently throughout the centuries in a wide variety of Tantricscriptures, in the Kamikagama also, This must be one of the earliest citationsof this definition:tanoti vipulan arthams tattvamantrasamasritan | tranam ca kurute yasmat tantramityabhidhlyate j(P.M., 1/29),28. Thus, Abhinavagupta, in the course of discussing one of the basic principlesof Kaula doctrine, namely, that purity or impurity is not an inherent quality ofthings but a mentalprojection which must be overcome along with all otherthought-constructs to achieve the pure conscious state of liberation says that:\"such was also (the insight of) the ancient sages (muni) by virtue of theirstate free of thought-constructs but who, in order not to disrupt the order ofthe world, concealed it,\" (TA, 4/243b-4a)>29. R. C. Hazra writes: \"At the time the chapters on vows, worship etc. firstbegan to be included in the Puranas, the Tantric elements were eliminated as faras possible.\" Studies in the Puranic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs, MotilalBanarsidass, 2nd edition, Delhi, 1975, p. 260. According to Hazra the additionsmade to the Puranas prior to the ninth century were largely free of Tantricinfluence. From about the beginning of the ninth century the authority of theTantras came to be gradually recognized by the Puranas and so Tantric ritualswere increasingly incorporated into them (ibid., pp. 260-2).30. See, for example, Hazra p. 119,31. Schoterman has published a study of these chapters in an article entitled: ALink between Puranaand Tantra: Agnipurana 143-147 in ZDMO Supplement IV,Wiesbaden, 1980.32. TA., 28/407a.33. Bhairava addresses the goddess in this way in the Niiisancaratantra. Copiesof this text are indeed rare; I know only of one MS, namely, NA, no. 1/1606(incomplete),34. TA., 37/l(M2a.35.

Thus the Rsis in the Kamikagama were, \"intent on Siva and Sakti desirous ofunderstanding the Supreme Knowledge.\" They praise Siva saying of Him:[You] are of the nature of the flow of innate bliss whose characteristic isone's own consciousness, [You Who are] united with the Supreme Power whosenature is supreme consciousness.(P.Ka., l/7a-8b).49. There are a number of later Tantras whose names are the same as Tantras ofthe older group; examples of these are the Kulacudamani, Kularnava, Tantraraja,Guptatanira, Jayadrathayamata, Sammohanatantra and a medieval work not at allassociated with the Paicimamnaya called Kubjikatantra. Schrader writes: 'Thatoccasionally the same name has bcm given to two or even more different works isnothing unusual in Agamic literature. For instance, among the Sakta Tantrasthere are,.. . three Prapanca tantras, two Harigaurl tantras, three Kubjikatantras, two YoginI tantras and two Mrdani (?) tantras.\" Introduction to thePancaratra and Ahirbudhnya Samhitaby F. Otto Schrader, Adyar Library Series,Adyar, 2nd edition 1973, pp. 14-5.In the later period Saktatantras are distinguished from Saivatantras and called\"Nigama\" and \"Agama\" respectively. The characterizing distinction between themis stated to be that the former are spoken by the goddess and the latter by thegod. Originally the Tantras were generally spoken by the maleNotespartner to his companion, however much they may have been concerned with femaledivinities and their rituals. Thus the NSA, which belongs to the early periodbut was in the later period considered (quite justifiably in terms of itscontent) to be an exemplary Saktatantra, is taught by Uvara to the goddess. Thegoddess herself remarks that the god had taught all the preceding Tantrasincluding those which the goddess defines as the \"Tantras of the Mothers\"although the ones that are listed are of many types including Siddhantagarnas.The passage reads:bhagavan sarvarnantrasca bhavata me praka&tah | catussastisca tantrani matfnamuttamani tu |evam etani sastrani tathanyanyapi kotisari |j bhavatoktani me devasarvajnanamayani tu |(NSA, 1/13).(Ibid., l/21b-22a).The mairtantra figure as a separate group along with the Yamaias in theSiddhantagarnas (see P.Ka., 1/122) while a reference from an unknown source inJayaratha's commentary on the TA shows that a distinction was made between theSankaratantra and the Devhantra (see TA, vol. Xib, p. 12). Even so, we do notfind that a clearcut distinction exists between Sakta and Saiva Tantra in theearly sources, even in the Kulatantras which were in practice Sakta in mostrespects. By the middle of the ninth century, when Somananda wrote the SivadmUthe Saktas figure as a distinct group (see ibid., chapter 3) but in this casethey could arguably be said to be connected to the tradition only indirectly asits commentators and exegetes. The Siddhantins during this period also appliedthis distinction, Narayanabhatta does so in his commentary on the Mrgendragama,although it is not found in the Agama itself. Thus he says:saivanam eva desikadlnam iha laksanam j saktadayastu te anyadrsa evetivijnapayitum saivapadopadanam j(Mr.T. (caryapada), 1/2).50. yena tantrena carabdham karsanadyarcan&ntakam | tena sarvam prakartavyam nakuryad anyatantratah |)(P.Ka., vol. 1/106).

Lorenzen rejects the view that Pasupata orders existed before LakuliSa anddeclares that \"LakullSa was in all likelihood the founder of the Pasupataorder/* (Lorenzen p. 175), This was also R. G. Bhandarkafs view. He remarks:\"Lakula was the genera! name by which the Saiva sects were called. This genera!name has for its basis the historical fact that a person of the name Lakulin orLakulis'a founded a Saiva system corresponding to the Pancaratra system, whichthe Vayu and Linga Puranas consider to be contemporaneous with it. The othergeneral name, Pasupata, arose by dropping the name of the individual Lakulin andsubstituting that of the god Pasupati, whose incarnation he was believed tobe.'* Quoted by Chakraborti in his introduction to the Pasupata Sutram withPancarthabhasya by Kaundinya, Academic Publishers, Calcutta, 1970, p< 9.88. LakulisVs date is uncertain. Much controversy centres on an inscriptionpublished in 1931 by D. R. Bhandarkar found on a pillar near Mathura dated 380A.D. (EI XXI 11-9). It records a donation by the Mahesvara teacher, Uditacarya,of two lingas named after his teacher, Bhagavat Kapila and grand-teacher,Bhagavat Upamita. Uditacarya is described as tenth in descent from Kusika andfourth from Parasara. Bhandarkar identified this Kusika with Kusika the discipleof Lakullsa. Thus he assigned Lakullsa to the first half of the second centuryA.D. (Lorenzen pp. 179-80). We cannot be sure, however, that these Saivites wereindeed Lakullsa Pasupatas. A figure is sculpted on the pillar with a trident;the base shows a pot-bellied standing figure, nude with two hands, leaning on astaff and with a third eye (LakulUa: Saivite Saint by U. P. Shah in Discourseson Siva edited with an introduction by Michael W. Meister, Vakils, Feffer andSimons Ltd., Bombay, 1984, p. 96), There is no mention in the inscription of thePasupatas nor of Lakullsa; nor does the figure on the pillar bear the standardattributes of Lak ultsa. Even so, Kusika is well known as one of LakulisVsdisciples who heads a lineage of Lakullsa Pasupatas, That this name is foundassociated with a Saivite ascetic has seemed to most scholars grounds enough toaccept this identification. But whether this date is correct or not, a fairlyregular iconography of Lakullsa as a Saivite saint begins to emerge by about thesixth century (Shah p. 97) and so must belong to at least the fifth century.89.

Abhinava refers to such practices in his Tantraloka.According to him, consciousness is the one reality and so can never becontaminated. The distinction made between 'pure' and impure' is no more than athought-construct generated by an inner, personal conflict which, like all otherconflicts, is binding and so must be overcome. This is why the Viravalxtantradeclares that \"the ancient rsis ate both beef and human flesh\" (TA, III, p.268). Again (the same) Tantra enjoins that \"Tantric adepts of a higher order(vira) should eat that which the common man detests and, being revolting, iscensorable and prohibited by the scriptures'* (ibid., p. 269). This is done sothat the yogi can see whether his mind isNotesindeed steady or not (ibid,). The Timirodghafatantra says: \"O goddess, by eatingthe body of the beloved, a close friend, relative or benefactor raise up theMaiden of the Sky [and so elevate consciousness].\" (quoted in S.Su., vi., p.33). Ksemaraja explains that this is an injunction to assimilate embodiedsubjectivity into universal consciousness (ibid,).12L Kurma, 1/11/257.122. Ibid., 1/11/265.123.

Abhinava's sources are the BY and the Siddha-yogesvarimata.157. Lorenzen, p. 74 ff. demonstrates that the Kapalika's vow corresponds to thepenance prescribed in Hindu law for killing a brahmin. He makes a mistake,however, when he distinguishes a \"brahmahan\" from a ti bhrwahan' f a$ one whohas killed an ordinary brahmin rather than a learned brahmin. \"Bhrunahan\"Notesactually means \"one who has killed a fetus'* that is, a person who has inducedor consented to an abortion, (See Panic's Asfadhyay'h 3/2/87),158. The Jayadraihayamala (NA, MS no. 5/4650, fl. 186a) says:suddham samsuddha(m) buddhasca tat ha pa^upatavratam | nagnavratam muno!adharamparivrajvratam uttamam |[159.

One such Kalamukha teacher was Somesvara who is praised in severalinscriptions. Thus, for example, in an inscription found at Belgave dated 1103A.D M Somesvara is eulogized as: \"he who is gracious to learned men, he who is avery sun to (open) the great cluster of water-lilies (blooming in the daytime)that is the Nyayasastra, and who is a very autumn moon to bring to full tide theocean of Vaise$ikas; he who is the very ruby ornament of those who are versed inthe Samkhyagama, and who is a very bee on the water-lilies that are the feet ofhis teacher; he who is a very spring to the grove of mango trees that is theSabdasasira and who gave new life to the Lakulasiddhanta by the development ofhis wisdom.\" (Ed. and trans, by Fleet EI V, 220 quoted by Lorenzen, p. 113).Such terms as \"Lakulagama\" or \"Lakulasiddhanta\" recur frequently in Kalamukhaepigraphs (ibid., p. 110). I believe, as does Lorenzen, that these names, oreventheexpression \"Paramatmagama,\" refer equally, according to the context, both tothe doctrines of the Lakulisa Pasupata and the Saivagamas in general.164.

See The Vinasikhatantra: A Saiva Tantra of the Left Current edited with anintroduction and translation by Teun Goudriaan, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi,1985, Goudriaan has made a chart of the forms of Tumburu, his attendants andMantras found in a variety of Puranic and Tantric sources on pp 47-50 of thisbook to which the reader is referred, Tumburu is well known in lexicons andBuddhist works as a Gandharva and musician. (Bagchi, p. 12) He is oftenassociated with Narada as an attendant of the gods (Goudriaan, p. 18). He alsofigures as an authority on music in thu Satngltaloka and the tambura may wellhave got its name from him (Bagchi, p. 13). The god Tumburu described in theVinahkhatantra has nothing to do with music, nor is he associated with the vinadespite the title of the Tantra. He is also devoid of these associations in theNotessources Goudriaan has consulted. However, a description of Tumburu, white incolour with two arms and one face, wearing a tiger's skin sitting on a bullplaying the vina is recorded in the PLSS. (See line drawing on p. 39 in vol 1).A more extensive description of Tumburu is found in the fifth chapter of thefirst satka of the JY (NA, no. 5/4650, fl. 22a if.). Here Tumburu's associationwith music is clearly evident.According to the J Y, Tumburu is the Lord Himself {prabhu) and is called theGreat Fierce One {mahavyala\\ the crest jewel (siroratna) of all the gods astheir Topknot (sikhay-ix term used in these Tantras to refer to Kwrfalinl He hastwo aspects, one without form (asakala) and the other with form (sakala); it isthe latter which is described here. He has four energies (kala) which reside inthe Cave of the Heart of His universal consciousness. These are; Santikaia,Vidyakala, Nirvfti-kala and Prattyhakala. They correspond to the goddesses Jaya,Vijaya, Ajita and Aparajita who generate the phenomenal universe (karya) whileHe Himself is the fifth and highest energy^ Santyaiitakala— which transcends allmanifestation. Thus He resides in the Abode of Tranquility, (saumyadhama) whichis full of the savour of countless Mantras.

Hemakes the gesture of the Saktipitha and His mandate h that of Candradurdanfa Hehas four hands in which he holds a noose, hook, trident and makes the gesture ofbestowing boons. He has four faces which are white, red, yellow and dark blue(krsna). His body is like a blazing tight shining brilliantly like mount Meru.His principal face is like that of a human being whose lotus-like eyes areblooming and is most beautiful. He wears an earring and its rays cover His facein a network of light. His neck is like a precious gem and His hand is adornedwith a ruby ring set in emerald. He wears emeralds and rubies and His broad hipsare covered with Kasmiri cloth. From His mouth comes a deep sound like therumble of a storm cloud. Of His remaining faces one is that of a crocodile whilethe two others are those of swans singing sweetly. The pollen of His lotus feetbestows bliss to the Vtras.

The trident He playfully carries has for its threeprongs persistence, arising and destruction. He bestows all that men desire withHis wish-bestowing gesture.Tumburu resides in the circle of the fourteen powers of the Great Fetters(mahapMa) and is surrounded by a host of female attendants (duti) and servants.His hosts laugh and Shout terribly and their forms are hideously disfiguredwhile He is the Great Hero who can destroy the entire universe by the merethwang of His bow.

Ibid., 2/51-57, The Kasyapasamhita of the Paficaratra (ed, by Sri YathirajaSampathkumaramuni, Madras 1933) ts concerned entirely with the exposition of theGarutfamantra. It is a text on snake bites and cures. It is, however, a uniquework in the Paficaratra corpus so much so that this has led to the suspicionthat it is not canonical even though the worship of Garua!a as a cure for snakebites is counselled in certainly genuine Paficaratra texts (e.g.,Brhadbrahmasamhita II, 3, 36-57). See The Smith Agama Collection: Sanskrit Booksand Manuscripts Relating to Paficaratra Studies by David H. Smith, Syracuse1978, pp. 21-23.217. TA, 37/12b-13.218. This preliminary identification with Bhairavais interesting. The purpose ofit here seems to be to reinforce the efficacy of the adept's identification withGarutfa. Bhairava is also depicted as a powerful being who can counter theeffect of hostile planets, protect fields, defeat ghosts and raksasas as well ascounter the effects of poison (G.P., 20/14).219. G.P., 197/46-54.220. MS no. 3/392; 5/4949; 5/4947; 5/4946 and 5/4948.

Again, if we accept thevariant reading Pancamrtam for Pancabhutam, which is no. 16 in the Garu4a list,it may correspond to no. 48 in the NSA list, although it is more likely to bethe same as the Pancamrtam, which is no. 27 in the list of Daksinatantras. ThereNotes to Part One153are a number of cases where we notice that a text travels from one group toanother or, to put it another way, is appropriated by other groups.224. \"bhairavagamesu daksipasrotah samutthesu svacchandacandatri&ro-bhairavadisubheditam |\" (NTu, vol. I, p. 225), These three Tantras are No, 1, 2 and 24 inthe list of the Daksinatantras. Also SvT, vol, I, p. 8.225. Abhinavagupta exalts the Bhairavatantras which he considered to be thehighest of the five currents of scripture:XXXXXX srotah pahcakarn yat tato'pyalam | utkrstam bhairavabhikhyam XXXXXXXX(TA, 37/17).226. At the Institut Francais D'Indologie in Pondicherry, transcripts have beenmade of all twenty-eight Siddhantagamas. MSs of many of the two hundred-oddupagamas have also been collected.227. So, for example, the Netratantra says:sarvagamavidhanena bhavabhedena siddhidam |vamadaksinasiddhantasauravaisnavavaidikel(NT, 9/2).228. In certain MSs (e.g., NA, 1/285) the colophons describe this tantra as:sarvasrotasamgrahasarah f i.e., \"the essence of the summary of all the currentsof scripture.\"229. NT, 9j\\\\.230. Thus the goddess says:yad uktam daksinam srotam vamam caiva tatha param |madhyamasca tatha srotam coditak pflrvam eva hi ||(BY, MS no, NA 1/296, fl 187b). (Philological note: the word srotas is a neuternoun ending in the consonant \"s.\" Here it is treated as if it were a neuter nounending in \"a,\" Accordingly, the form of the nominative singular is srotam ratherthan srotas.)231. These energies constitute a standard triad of will, knowledge and action.Their iconic forms in the BY are portrayals of the goddess in the three ages oflife, namely, youth, maturity and old age. (See Ghosal Sastri, vol. II, part IVp. 13, Sastri bases his brief account of this triad on a MS of the BY depositedin the library of Visvabharati University, no. ill 16/3, fol 6a). It seems thatwe have a prior parallel here for the Trika identification of the three currentswith Para, Parapara and Apara who are the three goddesses that are the focus ofTrika ritual. This identification is made in the Srikanthlyasawhita althoughthere the three currents are differently defined.232. \"asesamafasamdoharanjitak madhyamaSrayafc I\" (BY, ibid,, fl. I88a). Note:The rules of euphonic combination have not been observed here; ranjitafy shouldbe ranjito*233. Sivajnana is here expressly identified with the Siva and Rudrabheda of theMadhyamasrotas; thus the parajnana of the Siddhanta becomes just a part ofjnanaugha.Notes234. It is certainly not at all clear whether we can, in fact, make suchclear-cut distinctions, although generally speaking the Siddhantagamas do tendto be dualistic, unlike the Bhairavaiantras which are predominantly monist. Evenso, it is certainly not possible to distinguish the Sivagamas from theRudragamas on the basis that the former are dualist while the latter conceivereality to be a unity-in-difference.235. Abhinavagupta goes further by making all the Saivagama ultimately a part ofTrika, The god who utters the scripture is not the five-headed Sadaswa of theSiddhanta. The Supreme Lord who spoke the three types of scripture (of the Left,Right and Siddhanta) is in fact three-headed. He is Trisirobhairava, the Trikaform of Siva:tad vibhavayati bhedavibhagarn tat sphutatvakrd athoktam anantam | samgrahisnuparameSvararuparp vastutas trisira eva nirahub ||(MVV, 1/397).236. This state of affairs is peculiar to the Srikanthi which does anyway, in asense, retain the Vamataniras as a part of the same standard, older divisioninto srotas although it is relegated to the lower level of a secondary,subsidiary classification. Other Trikatantras such as the Bhargaiikha andNisisamcara sustain the continued existence of the Vamataniras although theyintegrate them into Trika. There was, however, certainly a tendency for theVamataniras to lose their identity in the ambiance of Kashmiri Saiva Trika.237. The Sikhabheda in the SKS consists of the following eight Tantras: Bhairavicalled Sikha, Vina, VinamanU Sammohanam, Qamaram, Atharvakam, Kabandha andSirah'heda. In the Vamatantra list Vina is the seventh, Sammohanam maycorrespond to the fourth called Mohanam and Vinamani to the fourteenth calledCmtdmanimahodayam (although this identification is certainly more tenuous thanthe previous one). Also worth noting is that the Sirascheda, which is theJayadrathayamala, finds itself in this, rather than in the Yamala group,possibly indicating its closer affiliation to the Vamataniras,23S. That there was some problem here is confirmed by the fact that thecorrespondent member in the Bhairavasfaka is called simply \"Bhairava,\"239. P.Ka, l/27a.240. Thus Jhankara is no, 31 and Sekhara no. 21,241. daksine daksino margas caturvimsatibhedatari | saivas sarvesu kurvanti yegrhastha dvijottamah ||(TA, vol I, p. 44).242. yamale matrtantre ca kapale parlcaratrake || bauddhe carbamate caiva lakuievaidike'pi ca | anyesvapi ca margesu tat tac chaStraih svasastratal) || saival?kurvanti dik$adyam tal lirigasthapanadikam |(P.FCa, l/122Ma).243. The Yamalas listed here are Rudra°, Kanda°, Brahma 0 , Visnu°, Yama?, Vayu°t Kuvera* and Indra*.244. The names of these Yamalas are listed in the gjuvimarsini (p. 43):Notes to Part One155Brahmayamala t Visnu 0 , Rudra°> Jayadratha 0 , Skanda°> Uma°, LaksmP andGanes'a 0 , A part of the Umayamala appears to be preserved in a collection offragments in a Nepalese MS (NA, MS no. 3/575). The colophon of this fragmentreads:iti sribhairavasrotasi sa rasa nigra he srl umayamale dvadasasahasre umaprabodhesrisiddhilaksmividhanam caturvirnsatitari sapta-daSaksaroddharah samaptah |245. The Brahmayamala knows the Yogimhrdaya which is closely related to the NSA.There can be no doubt that the Yogimhrdaya, which mentions the NSA in manyplaces and has been even considered to be the second part of it, is at leastcontemporaneous with it.246. Amongst the eight Yamalas noted in the §KS the following are not namedabove: Svacchanda*, Ruru 0 , Atharvana 0 and Vetaia 0 . We know of others fromreferences; thus the Devydyamala is an important scripture quoted in theTantraloka and elsewhere (see LAS, vol. II, pp, 84-90). There is also theSamkarsini'yamala (quoted in TA, vol. IX, p. 139).Again, although the Yamalas which have been preserved—namely, the JY, BY andfragments of the Umayamala— belong to the Bhairavasrotas, Yamala was consideredby Trika to be higher than the Daksinasrotas. Thus Abhinava writes in the TA,probably quoting from the SYM:vidyakalantam siddhante vamadaksinasastrayofi | sadasivantarn samanaparyantammatayamale ||(TA, 15/319).247. See above footnote no, 92.248. The lists of sixty-four Tantras in Laksmidhara's commentary on theSaundaryalahari and Bhaskara's setubandha commentary on the NSA as well as theone in the Kufacua'amamtantra are almost the same as that of the NSA. There canbe little doubt that they adopted it wholesale as a standard canonical list.Other later lists of sixty-four Tantras are indeed different and probably dopresent an actual account of the Tantras at the time of their compilation. Evenso, the Tantras were listed as a group of sixty-four on the basis of the older,traditional system of classification to which the NSA subscribed. For theselists see LAS, vol. II, pp, 94-111.249. The Goddess says at the beginning of the NSA:nityafi sodasa devesa sucita na prakasitah || idanlrn s'rotum icchami tasatrinamani sarnkara | ekaikam cakrapujam ca paripurnam samantatah ||(NSA, l/22b-23).250. These are numbers 51, 52 and 53 in the list. The Kulasara is quoted byKsemaraja in the S,Su,, vi., p, 67. It is also named in theCincinimatasara-samuccaya of the Pascimanmaya; see NA, MS no. 1/767, fl. lb. TheKula-cugamani listed here is probably different from the published KulacudamanUNoteswhich appears to belong to a later strata in the development of the Tantras.Another work of the same name which is more likely to be the same as the Tantralisted here is quoted by Ksemaraja in S.Su,, vi., p. 29.251. These are numbers 24, 12 and 26 in the list. The Trisirobhairavatantra isone of the Tantras Abhinavagupta quotes the most. We know from Ksemaraja that itwas considered to be a Daksinasrotatantra: \"bhairavagamesu daksina-srotahsamutthesu svacchandacantfatrisirobhairadisu bheditam |\" {NTu, vol. I, p. 225).There can be no doubt that this is also a Trikatantra because Abhinava refers toit at length in chapter 30 of his Tantraloka where he deals with the Mantras ofthe three goddesses Para, etc, Y and their consorts, which is a characteristicfeature of Trika. Indeed, the exposition is based essentially on the MVT andSYM, which are Trikatantras par excellence. Here the Tri&robhairava is referredto as presenting a number of variant forms of these Mantras. The TrUirobhairavais again referred to at length in TA, 3 1 where the drawing of theTrisulamandala is described, the knowledge of which, according to Abhinava, isthe mark of the true Trika master (TA, 31/50b-52). We know that the Nisisamcara,(also called NUacara and Nisafana) must have been a Trikatantra because itconsidered Trika to be the highest school (see quotations in TA, vol. I, p. 49and PTv f p. 92). A single incomplete and very corrupt MS of a Nisisamcaratamrais deposited in the NA at Kathmandu (MS no, 1 /1606). This is a palm leaf MS andthe text is written in old Newari script probably belonging to the twelfthcentury A.D„ if not earlier. The content and style is certainly of the type onewould expect of a Tantra of the older group. Even so, its esoteric exposition ofi\\it pif has dots, not agree with that found in references from the Nimamcaraquoted in Kashmiri works, although the treatment is conceptually similar.Possibly the fragment in Kathmandu was the original Daksinatantra, although itdoes not affiliate itself to it or any other group anywhere in the text or thecolophons. Three MSs of the SYM have been located, all of them incomplete. Oneis deposited in the NA— MS no. 5/2403 (23 fl.); the other two are in the AsiaticSociety in Calcutta, viz, MS no. 39I7D (2 il)and 5465(7211). The first of thesetwo Calcutta MSs contains only the fifth chapter called \"Karnikapafala\" Thesecond MS contains 31 chapters. Although the fragment preserved in the first MSis a part of this Tantra, it has not been traced in the second MS. Again,although a number of verses have been traced in the second MS which are quotedin Kashmiri works, it seems that this is a shorter recension than the one knownin Kashmir, Perhaps this shorter recension was called \"Bhairavavirasamhitd\"which is the name given to this Tantra in the colophon of chapter 21. The SYM isknown to the NSA (no, 51 in the list) and the BY, clearly indicating that thisis an old and well-established scripture.

We come across the term \"mantrapitha\" in the Siddhanta but here it refersto the seat of the deity (pifha) which is transformed in the course of theritual into Mantra (see Mr.T., Kr. 8/ 196b-197). Vidyapifha in the Siddhantarefers to the Agama in general viewed as an object of veneration. The worship ofthe sacred scripture is a way of worshipping Siva. The Agama the disciplestudies is an object of his veneration; it is therefore, on occasion, worshippedwith flowers and incense, etc., as is the teacher (see SSP, vol. I, p. 226,290). During certain rites of atonement prescribed in the TriMrobhairavatantra,a sacred thread (pavitra) is offered to all the places of worship on the sitewhere the^ ritual is performed, including the Vidyapifha which is presumablywhere the Agama isNotes to Part One159worshipped (TA, 28/156b). Pascima ritual also provides for the worship ofscripture. According to the MBT (Y), the Kulagama is to be worshipped in aspecially prepared mandate called Vidyapltha (fl. 86a). Similarly, at thebeginning of the OS the manner in which the master and then the Agama are to beworshipped is described (p. 5), while the $atSS explains how the Tantra of theKubjika tradition is to be worshipped before the master teaches the disciple itsmeaning (SatSS, 3/98-102),281. vidyaplthapradhanani ca siddhayogesvanmatam || tasyapi paramam saramrnalinlvijayottaram [(TA, 37/24b-5a).The MVT itself states its own close affiliation to the SYM.

Abhinavagupta: An Historical and Philosophical Study by K. C. Pandey,Chowkhamba, Benares, 1963,\" p. 138.PART TWO1. According to the NT (chapter 12), the presiding deity of the Kulamnaya isBhairava. His form differs only in minor details from the Bhairava who,according to chapter 11 of this same Tantra, presides over the Daksinasrotas.The Goraksasamhita, a Fa&cimamnaya Tantra, opens with a hymn to Bhairava (pp.1-3) who is said to be \"born of Kuia and Akula, [although] free of the emergenceof Kula\" (ibid., p. 162). He is, in other words, both transcendent Siva (Akula)and immanent Sakti (Kula) and at the same time free of all cosmic manifestation(Kula). Mahesvarananda says of Kulesvara, the deity every Kaula school veneratesas supreme, that \"in the Kaulikatamras he is generally called Bhairava\" (MM p.172).2. evam etat kulamarganupravistena sarvatha svatmananda-vyanjakatamatraparatayasevyam na tu tad gardhena |(TA, vol. Xlb, p. 67).According to Jayaratha, the Kaula's wife is not the ideal Tantric consort forhim because ritual intercourse with her is attended by the danger of hissuccumbing to lust. Abhinavagupta, however, does not consider this to be aproblem and so, according to him, ritual union (melapa) can be of two kinds,depending on whether it takes place with one*s own wife or with any other womaninitiated into Kaula ritual.3. Jayaratha quotes from an unnamed Tantra:He who is dedicated to Kula practice (kuiacara) but is not touched by wineshould practice penance, be he a brahmin or a ksatrlya,(TA, vol. XIb,p. 11).4. layodayas citsvarupas tena tat kulam ucyate | svabhave bod ham amalam kulamsarvatra karanarn |(TA, vol Xlb, p. 4),5. kulasyaiva sarvavisrantidhamatvam uktam |(quote in TA, vol XII, p. 373),6. \"Kula is the Supreme Bliss \" (TA, vol. Xlb., p. 4).\"It is from whence this [cosmic] picture arises and where the universe comes torest\" (TA, vol. XII, p. 373).7. \"For the emission of the Lord of the Absolute is the Mistress of Kula\"(Ibid,, 5/67).\"The absolute is the Supreme Abode and it is that which is called Akula. Theemission of this Lord is said to be the power Kaulika^ (TA, 3/144). \"His innerintention is called Kauliki, the Supreme\" (TA, 3/137).8. santoditam sati karanarn param kaulam |(TA, 29/U7aff),9. \"Therefore it is free of ail obscuring coverings and so extrovertedconsciousness is awareness in the form of the means of knowledge while theobject of knowledge is the object of awareness such as 'blue* or 'pleasure', atone with it. All this, be it subject or object, etc., is the essence of thisexpansion! The point is that there is nothing apart from that\" (TA, vol. Xlb, p,7),10. In the economy of the Trika of the Tantraloka, the Nisisarncaraiantra isconstantly referred to as the authority for this view. Doubt is the Kaula*sgreatest obstacle; doubt constitutes the firm bars of the prison of samsara andit is this doubt he must overcome (see TA, 12/18b-25).11. ata eva hi naikatyad varnadak$inasastrayofi || dhara praritadharaprantekauliki pravijrmbhate |(MVV, l/394b~5a).12. puspe gandhas tile tailam dene jlvo jaie 'mrtam | yatha tathaiva sastrSnamkulam antalji pratis^hitam ||Abhinava quotes this verse from the Kalikula in TA, 35/34, after he has saidthat; \"The supreme goal of (all the scriptures) is the Abode named Trika'. Thatalone isisaid to be Kula because [only] that which is at one with all things[and unconditioned by time and space] is perpetually manifest. Just as life isone and the same in every individual limb of the body, whether major or minor,similarly Trika is present in all things as scripture itself confirms.\" Abhinavais here clearly equating Trika with Kula in order to establish that it ispresent in all the scriptures as Kula. Jayaratha similarly quotes this verse tosuggest that Trika is Kula. Trika, Jayaratha says, is the sixth current ofscripture that consists of the Siddhanta, Varna and Bhairava Tantras. The threegoddesses, Para, Parapara and Apara, reside in Trika and so it contains all thescripture and \"floods them with the nectar of Supreme Monism (paramadvaya)\" thusrendering them effective (TA, vol. I, p. 45). Mahesvarananda equates KulaNoteswith the Krama absolute {mahartha} and so quotes this verse (MM, p. 170) tosuggest that Mahartha is the highest esoteric doctrine hidden, and everywherepresent, in the scriptures. Mahesvarananda is not, however, really much at oddswith Abhinava because his Krama tradition is that of Anuitara which is theabsolute Abhinava*s Trika treats as Trika, the supreme principle itself.Accordingly, Mahesvarananda does not see much difference between Trika™ darsanaand Mahartha (ibid,, p, 92).13. athataij sampravaksyami kulamnayanidarsanam | yagam homam japam karyam yenasarvam avapnuyat ||(NT, 12/1).14. Ibid., vol. I, p. 253.15. Ibid., p. 252.16. Brunner, in an article on the NT, says in a footnote: \"One could ask oneselfwhy Ksemaraja deems it necessary to explain the characteristics of this schoolinsofar as he has said almost nothing about the others, and why he stresses thefact that it is essentially similar to them. Is it perhaps because it was notpopular in his time? Or described? Or not yet integrated into the great Saivafamily? One defends oneself with difficulty from the impression that thisintegration is achieved at the cost of a certain amount of effort. Onefrequently comes across references in the Netra to the triad Varna DaksinaSiddhdnta which seems to form a solid block: if in these cases reference is madeto Kula, it is because it is not a constant fixed group; it is like an addition,in another movement of discourse.\" Vn Tantra du Nord: Le \"Netra Tantra\"'m BEFEO,Tome LXI, Paris, 1974 pp. 154-5.17. After the Vttarakdmikd has described the five sroias we read:paScimad vamasamjnam tu vamad daksjnam uttamam | daksinat kaulikam srestharnmahakaulam tatah param || purvamnayam tatas ^resjham tasrnat siddhantam uttamam|(U.Ka, 24/92-93a).In the Mrgendrdgama, the Siddha—and YoginI™Kaula which, as we shall see, areimportant divisions in the Kulagama, are referred to as upasroias of the fivesrotas. (Mr carydpdda, 1/37, 1/40-1).18. antah kaulo bahib saivo lokacare tu vaidikafo |(quoted in TA, vol.

I, p. 46).Notes to Part Two 163This is probably a quote from the Srikawhiyasamhita.21. \"Sampraddya\" is defined as follows:sampradayairiti tat tac chastrokta jnanayogarupaih |(NT, vol. II, p. 3).22. tasya ma^hiketi kuiarn iti cabhidhanadvayam |(TA, vol. Ill, p. 296).In a different, more restricted sense, \"Kula\" was the name given to theparticular group or 'family' to which a demon or malevolent spirit belonged. Itwas important to determine the spirit's Kula in order to invoke the Lord of thatKula to free those who were possessed by it:yasmin kule yadamsena mudritah kilitah kvacit | tat kulenaiva ces^enasarvadosaib pramucyate ||(NT, 19/80b-Ia).YaksinI, YoginI, Matrka, Sakim, Pakini and other potentially malevolent spiritsbelonged to these Kulas. Their exorcism and propitiation is a part of Kulapractice, which in some of its phases included a number of exorcistic cults.23. Matsyendranatha (variously \"called Macchanda,\" \"Macchagnapada,\" \"Mmapada,\"\"Mlnanatha,\" \"Macchendra\" and \"Macchagna\") is an important founder figure who ismentioned in various contexts in diverse Kaula works. The Kashmiri Trika Kaulasconsider him to be the originator of the Kulagama. For an extensive treatment ofthe legends concerning this figure, the reader is referred to Bagchi'sintroduction to the Kaulajndrtanirnaya. Also G, Tucci, Animadversiones IndicaeJASB, N.S., XXVI, 1930 p. 131 ff.. Ksemaraja tells us that the worship of thefour Kaula masters, called \" Yugandthas,\" namely, Khagendranatha, Kurmanatha,Mesanatha and Matsyendranatha who taught in the four Ages (yugas) is a necessarypart of all Kaula ritual. Although the Pascimdmndya, like every Kaula school,had its own masters, it advocated the worship of the Yugandthas (Schoterman p.7). Here, however, Matsyendranatha and the others are associated, as we shallsee, with the Purvdmndya with which the Pascimdmndya had close affiliations. Anumber of works are attributed to Matsyendranatha although it seems highlyunlikely that they are in fact his own. Almost all the MSs are in Nepal. Bagchihas edited a number of them and notes others in his KJN. Another work which hehas not noticed is the Kulapancdsikd of which there is only one MS, deposited inthe NA in Kathmandu (no, 1/1076). The last colophon of this short tract on Kaulayoga reads:iti kuIapafkaSikayarn Srimatsandapavatare pahcamal? pat-aiafc samaptarj |Clearly \"sYlmatsandapa\" is a corruption of a homonymn of Matsyendrapada. Thiswork is quoted twice by Ksemaraja. (S.Su. vi. p. 54 and NTu I p. 191; fl. 4a and3b in the MS). There is no indication in the text that it is by Matsyendra.Bagchi notes the existence of MSs of the Srikdmdkhyaguhyasiddhi (also called164Notesjust \"Guhyasiddhi'% A list of eight siddhamatrka found in this work constitutingthe \"Kulasfaka\" also occurs in a number of texts belonging to the Pascimamnaya.Indeed, Bagchi himself notes that he has come across it in the KNT, a Pakimam-nayapaddhati It is possible, therefore, that it is in fact a work of thePascimamnaya, attributed to Matsyendranatha. That these and other works couldwrongly be attributed to Matsyendranatha is not difficult to explain in view ofthe fact that many individuals were given this name as initiates. For example,according to the KNT this name was given to a Bengali brahmin initiated into thePascimamnaya.

If the two words are conjoined and the compound inflected to form\"bhairavihhairavena saha\" the metre would be disturbed. For the same reason theforms \"bhairavena bhairavya saha,\" although grammatically correct, would not fitin this verse. Moreover, it appears that both words are here in the nominativeto indicate that they carry equal weight. The gods can be either with Bhairavaor Bhairavi ,as well as with both together).28. anyatha kulakaule 'smin sambhave na spr^anti te |(Ibid,, fl. 29b),Once the goddess has described the Wheel of Mahabhairava and its sixty-fourenergies she says in the same Tantra:catul?$a$thikala prokta bhairavasya kulesvara | vidyarupati smrtah sarva^ikulakaule tu siddhidah |(Ibid., fl, 8a).Notes to Part Two16529.sampradayam idam kaulam Sambhusaktipadanugam |(GS, 8/164a).30. Sivavlryam (vi)ni$krantam sivas'aktisamanvitam | ubhayanandasandohamparamparyavijrrnbhitam | kulamuianvayam devi kulakaularp vinirgatam ||(CMSS, fl. 3a).31. The Pascimamnaya, in common with other Kaula schools, views itself and othertraditions not just as doctrine, scripture or school but also as an essentialexpression of metaphysical principles. \"Kula\" and \"Kaula\" are in this contextinterchangeable terms reflecting the close interaction between Kula and Kaula asdivisions within the Kulagama as well as expressions of Kula itself as the powerof Speech (vacchakti) incarnate in doctrine. Accordingly, the MBT explains thatthe lower, grosser metaphysical principles merge progressively into the higher,subtler ones in such a way that the entire series ultimately disappears into theNameless (anamaka) absolute beyond all differentiation. The Nameless is Kulaidentified with Kulesvara who is the essence of Kaula, the ocean ofconsciousness in which the god and his consort, the goddess, fuse (MBT(Y), fl.26b). Thus Kula—the goddess—has become the god while he is the essence of boththe god and goddess where both dissolve and disappear. In other words, Kula isKaula at the level of the mysterious Nameless, the supreme reality. At the sametime, Kaula is the source of creation and its power is Kulatakti, the supremegoddess, the 'Neuter' {napumsaka in the feminine!) who is the mother of alldoctrines:kaulam nama mahadeva yena sr$|i caracaram | tasy(ec)cha nirgata saktirahkurakarakaulinl || dar&manam ca mata sa para devi napumsaka |(MBT(Y), fl. 33b).The Supreme Goddess (Paradevt) is Kubjika, the goddess of the Pascimamnayawhich represents itself in this way as higher than Kaula doctrine. It is anindependent system in its own right which both integrates and goes beyond thesecategories.32, kaulam tu sadvidharn satva satkut-apatitam dhruvam | satsamjfia casamudbhutam prasarat pascimanvayam [|(CMSS, fl. 3a).(Read \"srutva\" for \"satva/' \"Samjnatah\" instead of \"samjna ca\" would begrammatically correct. Note also that the word u anvaya\"\\% masculine; here asoften happens in these texts, it is treated as neuter).33. purvapa^cimabhedena sailarajasuta nume | anandavallbhedena prabhu yogikenatu || atitapadasamjna ca satprakaram idam kulam |(Read -\"sute\" for -\"siiia\" and \"avali\" for \"avail\" ** Prabhu\" should be in theinstrumental, i.e., \"prabhuna.\" This is probably a scribal error as the presentform cuts short the metre by one syllable. \"Samjna ca\" should be u Samjnaya\"\\166Notesin that case, however the seventh syllable would be short instead of long as themetre demands),In TA, 29/36 the order is 1) Bodhi, 2) Prabhu, 3) Pada, 4) Ananda, 5) Yogin, 6)Avail, The order in the KMT, <fl. 3a) is the same as the KRU; the latter,however, arranges these six into three groups of two; 4) + 6); 2) + 5) and i) +3), thus allowing the Pateimamnaya to be free, in a sense, to have its own lineof teachers without losing its essential connection to the originalSiddhasantana^ The KRU then links one group to the Purvamnaya and the other tothe Pascimamnaya and so aligns them through their common Kaula heritage andstresses their intimate connection with each other. However, in the KMT, whichis older than the KRU, no such distinction is made. The six Kaula traditions arecollectively called the Siddhakrama which has been transmitted along the Siddhapath {siddhamargakramayatam) (KMT, fl. 3a). The CMSS assigns the Kaulatraditions to the Purvamnaya which it integrates into the Pa&cimamnaya(see below).34. The Kaula schools display a marked tendency to exclusivity (as mdeed do allHindu sects and cults in general). The Urmikaulatantra, for example, expresslyprohibits contact with those who follow other scriptures (TA, 15/573b-4). AKaula does not distinguish himself from other Kaulas on the basis of caste butaccording to the Kaula group to which he belongs. The Kaula tradition prohibitscommensuality outside its circle as a whole and enjoins measures for atoningdefaults in this respect (TA, 15/ 272). Voicing the Kaula view, Abhinava says:\"In order to attain a state of identity (with Siva and one another) one mustfollow one's own spiritual tradition and neither worship nor enjoy the fruits ofa Tantric gathering (cakra) along with those who belong to a different spirituallineage.\" (ibid., 4/268b-9a).Even members of one or other of the six schools (ovalii) affiliated toMatsyendranatha could not worship together and went as far as to devise a systemof signs by which they could recognise members of their own group in order toavoid others (TA, 29/37). Once within a group, however, no distinction betweenits members was admissible. Caste and social status ceased to be operational inthis society; once in the fold the members become one with Siva and soindistinguishable from one another. He who viewed the others or talked of themin terms of former caste distinctions ran contrary to the Rule {samaya) (ibid.,15/576). In this respect, the Kaula traditions were perfectly in agreement withmany other Tantric cults (see for example, SvT 4/414 and 4/545).35. In an important passage in the Tantrdloka (4/221-270) Abhinava comments onpart of chapter 18 of the MVT (18/74-81) which he presents as typifying theTrika view and which he contrasts with that of the Saivasiddhanta, on the onehand, and Kula on the other. Thus, whereas the former enjoins the performance ofrituals and the observance of vows and rules governing outer conduct, the Kulaposition is seen to be one of denying their validity and rejection of theseouter forms in favour of inner spiritual discipline. Kula doctrine isessentially based, from this part of view, on an exclusivist monism (advaya)intolerant of contrasts, which thus rejects all forms of spiritual disciplinethat are 'external; that is, Outside' in the state of duality. The Trika view,however,Notes to Part Two167excels this because it is a supreme monism iparamadvaya) in which nothing needsto be pursued or even abandoned. Even if ritual is performed, it does not breakup the integrity of the absolute consciousness of the subject (TA, vol. Ill, p.288 ff.). Nothing is here prohibited or enjoined insofar as whatever is pleasingis fit to lead to union with Siva:muktikamasya no kincin nisiddharp vihitam ca no ||yad eva hrdyam tad yogyam sivasamvidabhedane |(TA, 15/29ib-2a). One could say that Trika is in this respect more intenselyKaula than the Kula schools and so, in the same spirit, rejects the view thatthe divisions between Kaula traditions are important. According to theTrikaMsana, there is an essential equahty among all these traditions insofar asthey are ail ultimately Saiva (ibid., 4/274-5a). Indeed, according to Abhinava,these distinctions are denied in all the Trika scriptures starting with the SYMbecause they break up the unity of ultimate reality (ibid., 4/269). TrikaMantras are applicable in all circumstances (ibid., 11/38) but, even so, oneshould take care not to be misled by following the teachings of other schools(TA, vol. Ill, p, 279 ff; TA 25/563).36. The god says to the goddess at the beginning of the Yoginihrdayatanira ofthe Srividya school: \"Listen, O goddess, to the great secret, the Supreme Heartof the Yoginl; out of love for you I will tell you today that which is to bekept well concealed, that which has been taught from ear to ear and so reachedthe surface of the earth.\" (YHr, l/2b-3). Similarly in the Kauiajnananiryayawhich was revealed, as tradition would have it, by Matsyendranatha; \"O goddess,it is heard as residing in the ear (not in books) and has come down through theline of teachers; this, O goddess, is Kaulika [doctrine] transmitted from ear toear\" (KJN, 6/8b-9a).37. After explaining in a veiled, cryptic manner how to construct a mantra, theKMT says: 'This method is hard to acquire, it can be obtained only from themouth of a master\" (fl. 37a).38.

He also points put in his commentary to verse 2/ 37 of thisTantra that this mouth is called PicuyonL Picuvaktra is also equated withPdtalavaktra in TA, 15/206 and commentary. The BY (fl. 201a) also confirms thatthose Tantras which deal with Kutacara are said to originate from the LowerCurrent along with others. In the context of describing the content of the LowerCurrent, the BY states that it is Bhairava who teaches here. The SKS's canon isunusual insofar as it equates the Mouth of the Yoginl with the Right Currentfrom which arise the sixty-four Bhairavatantras: \"The scripture called Bhairavaconsisting of eight times eight [Tantras] entered all together into theindependent Saiva [tradition] that is, the [current of the] Right, that of theEmission of the Heart\" (TA, vol. I, p. 41).Jayaratha comments that \"the Bhairava group consisting of sixty-four [Tantras]is predominantly monist and belongs to the Right Face which corresponds to the[single] non-dual inner nature of the union of Siva and Sakti, also called theMouth of the Yoginl\" In other words, the Bhairavatantras are here understood tobe vitally linked with the Kaulatantras through their common source. The BY is agood example of how this works. Its very name— Picumata (the Doctrine ofPicubhairava)—subtly implies its hidden connection with the Kaulatantras.Accordingly, Abhinava quotes it along with other Tantras belonging to theBhairavasrotas in the course of his exposition of Kaula ritual in theTantraloka. One chapter (56) of this work is devoted to Kulacara while another(69) deals with the Picubheda. The overall Kaula character of this work isunmistakable, although it does not consider itself to be such. Certain passages,however, refer directly to the attainment of Kaulasiddhi and union with Kuia(see quote in TA, vol III, p. 64). The Kaula character of other Tantrasbelonging to the Dak$inasrotas is also evident, particularly of those Tantraswhich teach Trika doctrine. Thus, according to the MVT, the SYM teaches themethod by which Kulacakra is to be worshipped (MVT, 19/48). Abhinava quotesTrisiro-bhairava, a Trikatantra belonging to the Daksipasrotas, when definingthe meaning of \"Kaula \"as a metaphysical principle (TA, vol. Xlb, p. 6). He alsorefers to it several times while describing Kaula ritual in the Tantraloka,including one passage which deals with the characteristics of the ideal Tantricconsort (TA, vol. Xlb, pp. 69-70), That not all Tantras of the Bhairava groupare so markedly Kaula-oriented becomes apparent when we consider the characterof the Svacchandabhairavatantra whose ritual programme is in many respectssimilar to that of the Siddhantagama in which Kaula rituals and practice arelargely absent. It seems that the VidyapUhatantras of the Saivagama were, inthis sense, extensively Kaula in character, and it is to this pifha that theTrikatantras generally belong. Moreover, it is to this pifha that most of theTantras of the Pa&imamnayaNotesI ^ill;affiliate themselves and so do many other Kaulatantras, Thus the god says in theYoginihrdaya: \"The Secret Doctrine I have hidden which bestows immediateunderstanding . . . resides in [those Tantras] associated with the Vidyapifha,It bestows divine yogic accomplishments and [is attained] by those dedicated toKulacara \" (see YHr, 2/ 76-80).58.

In the following reference, from the Mat.P, of the Siddhanta, \"svamnaya\"simply means \"one's own tradition\"—it does not refer to the amnaya system ofclassification we are about to discuss:samayacarasadvadasthitib svamnayalaksanar; |(Mat P., 2/13),75. For this generic usage of the term \"Kulamnaya t \"see, e.g., TA 15/533' alsoibid., 15/572.76. The earliest Trikatantras, such as the Trisirobhairava and even theSiddhayogesvarlmata, do not know themselves to be Trika although they expoundTrika doctrine and ritual. The same is true of the Malimvijayottara to whichAbhinava refers as the essence of the SYM which is, to all intents and purposes,the root Tantra of the Trika and indeed, probably, the first Tantra to expoundthe essentials of Trika, namely the worship of the three goddesses™ Para, Parapara and Apara—and their Mantras.77. The PaMmamnayatantras to which I have had access so far, which are but afraction of those extant in Nepalese MSs, all refer to the KMT and soundoubtedly postdate it. Thus the CMSS refers to itself as the essence of theKMT which had been previously expounded extensively:kathitam devadeveSi samksepan na tu vistaram | $rikubjikamatasaro*yam vistaramkathitam maya ||(CMSS, fl. 24a).(The word \"vistara \"is masculine so \"vistaram \"should be \"vistarah.\"Accordingly, \"kathitam\" which agrees with it should be \"kathitafy. \" The thirdquarter of the verse contains an extra syllable. This is probably due to theaddition of the word \"irl\" made as a sign of respect for the KMT. \"Vistaramkathitarn maya\" in the second line should read \"vistarah kathitah maya. tr )The Yogakha$4a of the MBT refers specifically to the KMT of 3500 verses whichcorresponds to the length of the recovered text of this Tantra. TheGoraksasamhita, which postdates the MBT, to which it refers in one place (p.278), also knows the KMT, to which it refers in several places as Srimata (p. 4,24, 49, 116, 158, 208, 277, 375) and once as KuMltantra (p. 152). It is closelyaffiliated to the Srimatottara (perhaps they may be the same work) which, as itsname implies, follows after the KMT. The Kularatnoddyota is also a later work asit affiliates itself to the Kubjikamata. The colophons are generally of thetype:ityadinathaviditam pancasatkotivistlrnasrlmatkubjikamate sri™ kularatnoddyoteAlso the Kubjika paddhati by Muktaka, the KNT, certainly postdates the KMT asdoes the Kularainapancaka. Although all these texts are later than the KMT,there is still room to doubt the originality of this Tantra. Thus in one placein the KMT it seems that there is a reference to an earlier Tantra.On fl. 49a the goddess says: \"now explain clearly what you have alluded to inthe previous Tantra but not clearly elucidated\":XXXXXXXX idanlm kathaya sphutam | purvatantre tvaya deva sucitam na praka&tam ||This reference may, however, be construed to mean that the matters which are tobe discussed are found in older Tantras which do not necessarily belong to thePascimamnaya. We have still to study the extant literature to see whether thereis any more evidence to decide this issue one way or the other. It seems highlyprobable, however, that the KMT is not only the root Tantra of the Pascimamnayabut also the first,78- KMT, fl. 44b. This reference is part of a passage reproduced in the GS,14/195-206a. Other Tantras referred to in this passage are the Sammohana andSvarodaya which is a Tantric astrological work. The Svacchandabhairava isreferred to here as \"the best of Tantras,\" Svacchanda Mantras are in factintegrated into the Pascimamnaya (see, for example, the exposition ofSvacchandastra in GS, p. 155 ff.). C. Chakravarti notices two after worksreferred to in the KMT, namely, the Labdhvitantra (emend to \"Laghvitantra\") andAghorliamaratantra (RASB Tantras, cat. II, p. 874),79, PTv, p, 184, This reference has not been traced in the 3500 verse recensionof the KMT preserved in numerous MSs in Nepal,80, paScimam sarvamarganam tvam tavatt anusllaya |Notes to Part Two 173pascimamnayamargo'yam siddhanam akhilam dada ||(KMT, fl. 6b),(For \"tavatt anusilaya\" read, \"tavad\" and the second person singular imperative\"anusllaya,\" For \"akhilam dada\" read \"akhilah pradah\" which agrees with \"-margo'yam.\"}81, tasya caivottare marge daksinamnayapurvakam | vindate nikhilam jnanamnirahamkari drdhavratah ||(KMT, fl. 54b).(The fifth syllable of the fourth quarter is long whereas it should be short.This syllable is shortened, however, if we form the compound\"nirahamkaridrdha-vratafy\")82. According to the following reference, the KMT presents the doctrines of thePaicimamnaya free of contamination from the Purvamnaya represented in laterTantras as a close associate of the Pascimamnaya:idarri ca pa&imam deva purvabhagavivarjitam |(KMT, fl. 6b).83. They are described as four possible ritual patterns included in thePa&imamnaya in MBT(Y), fl. 36-38.84. The correspondences are Purva-Krtayuga; Daksina-Treta; XJttara-Dvapara andPa&cima as belonging to the Kaliyuga (MBT(Y), fl. 35b). These Tantras frequentlyextol the Pascimamnaya as the best path in the Kali Age, e.g.,paScimam udite vesmam kalikalam tu siddhyati |(Ibid,, fl. 36a).(The nominative singular of the word \"vesman\"i$ \"ve$°ma\"not \"ve&mam. \"Instead of\"kalikalam\" v$sl& \"kalikale\" which agrees with \"udite.\")pascime tu kule siddhilj kalau XXXXXX |(Ibid. fl. 60a. See also $atSS 3/86).85. The correspondences are Drdhva-Prana; Purva-Apana; Vama-Samana;Daksina-Udana and Pascima-Vyana. $atSS, chapter 47, referred to by Schoterman,p. 86.86. In the seven-amnaya scheme mentioned earlier (fn. 58) a lower and *upperabove the upper' are added below and above the basic five amnayas of which thespeakers are the five faces of Sada&va. According to the Paratantra also, thefive amnayas are spoken by Sada&va with a sixth, lower one that is assigned tothe Bauddhas and so is not spoken by Siva.87. Abhinava quotes the Bhargasikhdtanira as saying:urdhvasrotodbhavam jnanam idam tat param priye | paramadhvaninordhvordhvamsamvidrupabhidhaying ||(MVV, 1/162).Following presumably the same Tantra, Abhinava says that the TantrasNotesare in six groups of which the Trikatastras are the \"purvardha,\" To understandwhat is meant here we must first draw the following diagram. See Figure 4.Figure 4, The Spatial Deployment of the Tantras According to the Bhargasikha.Above the Upper TrikaUpper Siddhanta North VamatantraEast GarudatantraWestBhutatantraSouth BhairavatantraThe \"purvardha\" seems to refer not to the \"half on the west side\" but that \"infront\" which is said to be \"half of six\" (sa4ardha\\ that is, the three \"infront\" of Trika, i,e„ the Siddhanta- Varna- and Bhairavatantras of which.

O Beloved, You Who are praised by the Viras, many are they who knowthe four Traditions but few those who know the nature of the Upper One\" (KA,3/7-10).90. For an account of this text, see Dvivedi, intro, to the NSA, pp. 46-7, Alsointro. to LAS, vol. II, p. 73 and Ta.Sa., p. 671.91. They are equated with the cycle of manifestation thus; Purva-Srsti,Daksina-Sthiti, PaScima-Samhara and Uttara-Anakhya. Although we cannot make outmuch here of importance for the historian, these equations are interestinginsofar as only four amnayas are represented. Moreover, the Uttaramnayacorresponds here to Anakhya which is significant insofar as this is the highestprinciple of the Kalikrama. The association of the Kallkrama with theUttaramnaya is well established in other Tantras (see below).92. The YHr> pp. 100-102. The equations made in this passage between the fouramnayas and moments in the cycle of manifestation are described in detail.Basically Patcima is equated with the precosmic seed (bija) state consistingNotes to Part Two175of the couple {yamala), Rudra and His power of action. Purva is the moment ofemanation (sr$?i) which includes also persistence (sr/n//)and withdrawal(samhara) and so is three-fold. Daksina is Kamakala consisting of the union ofthe red Saktibindu with the white Sivabindu and corresponds to persistence(sthiti). The Uttaramnaya corresponds to Anakhya. Thus, these equationsbasically agree with those made in the Samkeiapaddhati. Of interest here is theequation made between the Daksinamnaya and Kamakala, which implies that Srividyais associated with this amnaya t thus agreeing with the CMSS (see below).93. Four MSs of this work are deposited in the NAat Kathmandu; there may beothers listed in the private collections photographed by the NGMPP which I havenot had the opportunity to see. The MSs in the NA are 1/767 (38 folios), 1/199(69 folios), 1/1560 (34 folios) and 1/245 (36 folios). References are to MS no.1/767,94, CMSS, fl. 2a. Divyaugha is also referred to as Divyakaula (ibid.) orDivyaughkrama (ibid., fl. 2b). It is associated with the Picuvaktra (ibid., fl.2a),95. The Tantras referred to are the Tantrasara, Kriyasara, Kauiasara, Trikasaraand Yogasara. The CMSS also refers to the Yogmihrdaya, Kala-cakrodaya andYamala. Other scriptures and groups are the Bhairavasta and the Astasfabheda,the Paficasrotabheda, the Garuda- and Bhutatantras. It then refers to a numberof other groups (bheda) namely Mantra, Tantra, Cakra, Hrdantara, Sara, Kala andNitya- bheda as well as the Svacchanda which it considers to be the highest (fl.lb). Other works referred to in the body of the text are the Siddhayogesvarimata(fl. 14a), Rudrayamala (fl. 18a) and KMT (fl. 24a).96, The CMSS says that grha is the Inner Dwelling. It is the Wheel of Passion(raiicakra) which is in the womb of the goddess, sanctified (bhavita) by Kulaand Kaula. Yogis reside there in that consciousness, mentally discerning thatwhich is free of being and non-being and playing in the Kularnnaya, theimperishable abode of consciousness (fl. 14b). The Pakimagrha is:gadha(m) gambhlragahanam tad anandagrhasmrtah |(Ibid., fl. 4b).(The word \"gadha\" normally means \"shallow.\" The word \"agadha T \\ which is formedfrom it by adding the negative prefix J 'a-\", means \"deep.\" Although \"agadha\" isderived from \"gadha,\" it is more common in use, particularly in figurativeexpressions such as this one. The meaning of \"gadha \"has here, it seems, beenmistaken for that of \"agadha\" \"Anandagrhasmrtah\" is not a valid compound.Moreover, \"grha\" is neuter so the correct form would be \"ananda-grham smrtam.\")97. janmamnayarahasyantu catu(r) gharasamanvitam |(CMSS, fl. 24a).98. atah parataram vaks(y)e caturamnayasamsphutam | yena vijnatamatrenadivyamnayal? pravartate ||(MBT(Y), fl. 35a).99. svasvabhavaparab kascit purvacakrodaye 1 sthitah | daksinottaratam bhedarn 2nityakaiikramodayam ||ir> ■!;'/.:■ :'176 Notessarvam tyaktva svabhavena tal layam pastime grhe ||, (CMSS, a 4b).(*1.

It is Siva who is the ultimate source of thePascimamnaya and is himself its arising and present in it:tatrastham sambhavam natham pascimat paScimodayam |(MBT(Y), fl- 38a).Indeed all four amnayas are represented as belonging to 'Siva's circle' which isidentified with Kuia doctrine itself:athatar^ sampravaksyami yani siddhodayam kule | pascime daksirje vame purve va\"3a , mbhumanQ 1 ale |(Ibid., fl. 40b).(Emend \"siddhodayam\" to \"siddhodaye\")The shift of emphasis from the male to the female principle and vice versa isreflected in the exchange of roles between them as the imparters of Pascimadoctrine. Thus, most of the Pa$cimatantra$> (for example, the KMT, KRU and CMSS)are taught by the god to the goddess who inquires about the doctrine. However,in some cases, such as the Yogakhanda of the MBT, the reverse is true—it is thegoddess who instructs. The Pascimaiantras themselves take note of this andexplain that the teaching is transmitted in this two-fold manner. In the KRU thegod {Adinatha) says: \"I, O goddess, have explained [the doctrine] which wasestablished in the beginning. In this case I, O goddess, am your teacher [thatis], O Supreme Goddess, [in the imparting of the original] terms of reference{samjna}\"\"In the second one of my pervasive eras you will be my [teacher]. So accordingto this order of succession [the Kulakrama] is brought down into this world bythe revelation of it part by part [by me as well as by you].\"maya tu kathitam devi adisiddham yathasthitam [ atraham tvad gurur devi samjnahparamesvarl || dvitiye vyapake kalpe mama tvam ca bhavisyasi | anena kramayogenaam^amatravataranair^ || madiyaisca tvadiyaisca avatarya kulakramam |(KRU, fl. 71b),(Emend \"samjnafy \"to u samjnayah'\\)MNotes to Pari Two 177Also:tvaya mahyam maya tubhyam ivaya mahyam punar maya || kathitam tava susroni tvatsanganyesu moksadam |(GS, 15/299b-300a),In the KMT, which presents the doctrine at its origins, it is indeed Bhairavawho speaks, even so, as the embodiment of the Word held within consciousness(sabdarasf). He is forced to acknowledge his dependence on the goddess who, asMalini, is the power of his speech by virtue of which the Word can becomemanifest. Again, it is by virtue of the goddess travelling and manifestingherself in the sacred places throughout India that the doctrine is spread. She,and not he, is the chief protagonist as, indeed, is generally the case with thenon-dualist Tantras whether they consider themselves to be specifically Kaula ornot.101. sambhavam yatra linam tu vyapakam sarvatomukham | akula ca kulam jnanamvividham pascimam grham ||(MBT(Y), fl. 35b).(Emend \"akula\"to \"akulam\".)102. vimalam pascimam vesma sarvesam uparisthitam | viSesam tena viditamdharmadharmavivarjitam ||(Ibid.).(The word \"vtiesa\" is a masculine noun; even so it is treated here as if it werean adjective governed by the word \"veSman.\" The sixth syllable in the thirdquarter is not long as it should be).103. idam eva daksinanvayarupam srlkamarajamadhyaste | raudratmakastu rudrahkriyamayi saktir asya rudrant || yugalam idam tartlyam bijam palayatipaScimamnayam |(quoted in YHr, p. 101).See chapter 2 of the Saubhagyasudhodaya published with the NSA, pp. 311-313.104.

The Pascimamnaya alsorefers to itself as divided into lines (pit) originating from masters said toreside in these pit has. In the KNT they are the three listed below along withtheir Lords:Pifha Masters LordsO^iyana: Otfcjlsanatha NandesvaraPurnagiri; Srisasthinatha KarttikeyaKamarupa: Sncaryanandanatha - Ganesvara(See Schoterman, p. 36).In the Divyakrama of the Srividya the four pifhas are arranged in a triangle,the corners and centre of which correspond to a seed-syllable (btja) and teacherwho appeared in one of the four Ages. See Figure 5 below.Figure 5. The Triangle of the Divyakrama*Kali Purnagiri BhagamalimMitresanathaDvapara Jalandhara Vagesvarlgasthinathapicture1 [images/picture1.jpg]^Kamarupa^ Treta ^**^s^ VagbhavaUo\\lisanathaAlthough the names of the teachers in the various locations do not correspond,the fact that they are the same in these two schools is striking. According tothe SrividyS tradition, these four teachers belong to the Divyaugha throughwhich the earliest transmission of the teachings took place. The Tripura andKubjika cults share these teachers in common, thus linking them vitallytogether. However neither of the two traditions show overt signs of beingconscious of this connection between them. As the KMT makes no reference tothese teachers, it seems likely that this is a later development in thePascimamnaya. Rather than say that the Kubjika tradition has simply borrowedthis from that of Srfvidya, it may perhaps be more accurate to say that ithappens to find common roots with it in an 'original* transmission of Kauladoctrine conceived to be the same for every Kaula tradition. Again, that theCMSS defines itself as a Tantra belonging to the Divyaugha is a sign that majorKaula schools attempt to appropriate this 'original tradition' in order toappear to be the first, and hence, most genuine recipients of the Kaulateachings.Notes to Part Two179111. Mahesvarananda in his Maharthamanjari takes over the same division intofour lines of doctrine found in the NSA and calls them srotas. His purpose is toidentify Mahartha, the Krama absolute worshipped as Kali, with Tripura. He doesthis by comparing the four srotas to oceans churned by Manthana-bhairava whoalthough associated, from his point of view, particularly with the Kallkrama isconsidered to be the Bhairava of all the Kaulatantra (MM, v. 68 pp. 170-2). ThusMahesvarananda appears to be integrating the four-fold pifha division of theSrlvidya with the four amnayas of the Kulatantras. In the process, he makesManthanabhairava the Lord of them all, thus demonstrating that the highesttradition and the essence of all the scriptures (MM, p. 171) is the Mahartha orKrama which, as he himself says, is the Kaula Uttammnaya (ibid., p. 6, 143,186). Mahesvarananda thus knew and supported the division into four amnayaswhich must therefore have persisted in this form up to his time (mid-thirteenthcent.) along with the original Kaula Tantras which adhered to thisclassification.112 iyam ca vidya caturamnayasadharanyapi daksinapaksapatinlti(NSA, p. 41).113. Schoterman p. 36. In the Paratantra, where the amnayas are six, thegoddesses presiding over the amnayas are fearful in form except Kubjika andTripurasundarl who are both seated on Sada&va's lap and described as young andbeautiful.114. The term \"Kramadarsana\" is not common in the original Tantras. Theygenerally refer to their doctrinal and ritual system as \"Kramanaya,\" \"Atinaya,\"\"Mahartha,\" \"Maharthakrama,\" \"Mahakrama,\" \"Kallkula,\" \"Kalikulakrama,\"\"Kallkrama,\" \"Kalmaya\" or \"Devmaya\" (see Rastogi, pp. 16-30).115. CMSS, fl. 23b.116. Jayaratha refers to a number of authorities in his commentary on TA,4/148-170 where Abhinavagupta expounds the order of the twelve Kalisconstituting Samvkcakra. Amongst them are the Devlpancasatika, Snsardha-satika tand the Kramasadbhava which have been edited from Nepalese MSs by Mr. G. S.Sanderson but, as yet, unfortunately not published. The Kramasadbhava enjoinsthe worship of seventeen Kalis in Anakhyacakra whereas the other sources usuallyspeak of thirteen (apart from the Kramastotra where they are twelve). In theSrisardhasatika (quoted in TA, vol. Ill, p. 161) the thirteen Kalis are listedin the following order:1) Srsti° 2) Sthiti 0 3) Samhara 0 4) Rakta° 5) Svakail 6) Yamakall 7) Mrtyu° 8)Rudra° 9) Paramarka 0 10) Martaotfa 11) (Kalagni) Rudra 12) MaMkall and 13)Mahabhairavacantograghorakall who is in the centre. The Tantraraja-bhauaraka(quoted in TA, vol. HI, p. 189) also lists thirteen Kalis. The eighth Kali iscalled Bhadrakali, as it is in the CMSS> while the name of the thirteenth Kali,Mahabhairavakali, is a variant of Mahabhairavacandograghorakall which is thecommonly accepted form of her name. The order of the Kalis in theDevlpancasatika as quoted by Jayaratha is listed below: 1) Srs|i° 2) Rakta° 3)Sthiti 0 4) Yama° 5) Samhara 0 6) Mrtyu° 7) Rudra°Notes8) Manama 0 9) Paramarka 0 10) Kalagnirudra 0 11) Mahakall 0 12)Maha-bhairavacarujograghorakal! and 13) Sukall.The order of the Kalis Abhinava presents follows the Kramastotra, a work onwhich he wrote a commentary called the Kramakell This is as follows (TA,4/148-170):1) Srsti° 2) Rakta° 3) Sthitinasa 0 4) Yama° 5) Samhara 0 6) Mrtyu° 7) Bhadra 08) MartanoV 9) Parmarka 0 10) Kalagnirudra 0 I!) Mahakaiakall 12)Maha-bhairavacano'ograghorak&tf.Abhinava rejects the sequence of thirteen Kalis and leaves empty the space inthe centre of the rotating circle of Kails, where the thirteenth Kali is usuallylocated. Thus he agrees with the Kramastotra as opposed to the generallyaccepted pattern by the Tantras which take Mahabhairavacantfograghorakall to bethe thirteenth (see TA, vol III, p. 189). He does this, again following the leadof the Kramastotra, by eliminating Sukall who is usually the fifth in thissequence. This, Jayaratha tells us, the Pancaiaiika does not do (ibid,)-Moreover, it seems that Mahabhairava Kali was the thirteenth according to thistext as well It is therefore probable that Jayaratha has altered the originalorder of the Kalis it enumerates to fit with that of the Kramastotra. AnotherTantra Jayaratha quotes arrives at the number twelve by eliminating Sukall. Itappears, therefore, that ParamadevI, who is located in the centre of the twelveKalis according to the CMSS, is Mahabhairavacantfograghorakali. Thus there canbe doubt that the Kalis to which the CMSS refers are those of the Kalikrama aspresented in the majority of the Agamas of the Krama school prevalent inAbhinava's time.117. santi paddhatayas\" citrari srotobhede$u bhuyasa |anuttarasatfardharthakrame tvekapi neksyate ||(TA, 1/14),Gnoli's translation of this verse into Italian reads in English; \"Many are themanuals in use in the different currents. For the school of that of which thereis none higher, for the Trika and for the Krama, there is however not a singleone.\"In a footnote he writes that the \"school of that of which there is none higher\"(anuttara) is probably an allusion to the Kula school. He adds, however, thatthe first part of the compound (viz. \"anuttarasa4ardhartha~\") could also betranslated to mean \"for the method concerning Trika, that is, the school of thatof which there is none higher.\" It seems to us that this translation is moresatisfactory. The original translation implies that Kula is a separate systemwhich differs substantially from Krama and Trika and has an independent identitysimilar to them. It seems, however, that \"Kula\" is, in Abhinavagupta's works, amuch broader term of reference than 'Trika\" or \"Krama,\" as it is in the originalAgamic sources. In one sense, the term \"Kula\" refers to a type of doctrine andliturgical pattern. This use of the term is well exemplified by the contrastposited in the TA between the Kula method or liturgy (kulaprakriya) and theTantric Method (tantraprakriya). The former denotes Trika and Krama Kaula ritualin general; the latter all Tantric ritual that is free of Kaula elements,notably, the use of meat, wine and ritual intercourse. Again, \"Kula\" denotes atype of Tantric tradition; there are, as we have seen, a number of Kula schools.Notes to Part Two181Therefore, the expression \"Anuttarasafardhdrthakrama\" is best not taken to be acopulative compound but read to mean \"the liturgy (krama) of theAnuttaratrikakula school (arthay' Jayaratha also takes the word \"Krama\" here tomean \"liturgy\" (prakriya) and not the Krama school(anuttaratrikartha-prakriyalaksanam TA, vol. I, p. 33). The Anuttaratrika Kulais the highest form of Trika. It is also known as the (i Anuttaramrtakula\" whichAbhinava invokes in the first verse of his Tantraloka and which Jayaratha saysis the supreme principle that contains, and yet is beyond, the Triad (Trika) ofPara, Parapara and Apara (see commentary on TA, 1/1).118. kaularnavanandaghanormirupam unmesame$obhayabhajam antah | niliyatenilakulalaye ya tarn srstikalim satatam namami ||(quoted in TA, vol.

We notice here how, as with other Kaula schools, Siva figures as thesupreme transcendental principle. He is the ultimate end of all the sequences ofstates of consciousness, ritual acts and their macrocosmic counterparts, namely,the stages of manifestation and withdrawal. As in the Pascimamnaya, Siva iscalled Sambhu in the Kramasadbhava where he is identified with Bhasa—theprinciple of pure illumination, equivalent to the \"expanse of the glory of thelight of consciousness\" (prakasavibhavasphitham) referred to in the Kramastotraas Kail's supreme abode (TA, vol. Ill, p, 185), In the Kramasadbhava, Anakhya isSakti who follows after creation, persistence and destruction.jniinam srstim vijamyat sthitir mantra ri prakirtitah | samharam tumahakalamelapam paramam vidub || anakhyam s^ktirupam tu bhasakhyam sambhurupakam|(quoted in MM, p. 94).122. See K. C, Pandey*s Abhinavagupta. He refers to these practices on pp.491-493, in a section entitled: \"the problem of moral turpitude in Kramaritual.\"123. Goudriaan writes: \"Of many texts, the adherence to the Kula standpointappears from the fact that they have been referred to in the twenty-ninthchapter of the Tantraloka which deals with secret (Kula) ritual\" Hindu Tantricand Sakta Literature by Teun Goudriaan and Sanjukta Gupta, A History of HinduLiterature edited by J.

It is standard practice to commence a ritual by worshipping the divinitiesin the east which is the direction the worshipper is facing, and then to proceedclockwise round to worship the deities in the other quarters.134. Jflananetra received the original transmission from the goddess Mangala(also called Makaradevi) in the Uttarapltha, also called \"Cmkarapltha\"identified with Otfdiyana in which the cremation ground called Karavira waslocated (MP, pp. 49-50, 107; also MM, p, 92). (For Sivananda and his works seeRastogi. Page numbers are listed extensively in the index on p. 287. AlsoPandey, index p. 1004). Although Jnananetra is referred to as the master whobrought Krama doctrine to earth {avaiarakanatha, TA, vol III, p. 195) he was notthe original propagator of Krama doctrine but the founder of a branch of theKrama tradition which associated itself with the Uttarapltha.135. A unique MS of this work is deposited in the ASB (MS no, 10000). It hasbeen edited by Mr. G. S, Sanderson, although not published.136. khagendradyadisiddhanam kathita gurusantati | ete vai kulamarge'syarahasyarn sivanirmitam ||(quoted in RASB Tantra, cat.

Goudriaan {Hindu Tantrk and Sakta Literature, p. 50) points out that \"theexact position of the Krama system within the Kashmiri tradition and itsrelationship to Kula are, however, difficult to assess.\" When Goudriaandiscusses the Krama school he, quite rightly, regularly refers his reader to N.Rastogi*s excellent study, The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir, Motilal Banarsidass,Delhi, 1979. He says however that \"Rastogi seems to lay too much emphasis on theKrama school as a separate entity. We are inclined to think of a method ofinitiation or self-realization which could be followed by adherents of the Kulaview point.\" The history of Agamic Krama, its structure and relationship toother Tantric traditions, is another of the many subjects we can hope tounderstand only by carefully studying what remains of the original Agamicsources.140. In the opening benedictory verses of his commentary he says: \"May thatimperishable Auttara non-dual principle which is rooted in A [i.e., theabsolute] unfolding, be victorious!\" (MM, p. 1).141. Ibid., p. 189,142. In the concluding section of his book (p. 180 ft), Mahesvarananda tells usof the tradition, also recorded in Abhinava's commentary on the Kramastotra,that the Mahartha, i.e. Krama, doctrine was taught by Krsna to Arjuna in theBhagavadgita. Mahesvarananda goes on to say that this doctrine is that of theAuttara Krama. For other references see ibid., p, 6 and 176.143. Ibid., p. 170, 176.144. Ibid., p. 129. \"Anutiaramnaya\" could equally well refer to the TrikaNotes to Part Two183tradition as formulated in Kashmir, particularly in the works of Abhinavagupta(see fn. 119 above). The implication, therefore, seems to be that Mahesvarananda(like Abhinava) sees Trika and Krama as intimately connected in a singledoctrinal tradition. Accordingly, he says that he sees little difference betweenthem (MM, p. 92).145, The Paratantra says that the Uttaramnaya originated from the Kallkula(4/10). Perhaps the Ut taramnaya is a part of the Kallkula, (or a development ofit) which, as an independent tradition, precedes it. Apparently we are dealinghere with a later development in the Kalikrama schools. It seems that Krama,like Trika, acquired an identity as a system only gradually.146, ityuttaramnaya srlornkaraplthavinirgate Sricandabhairave soo'asasahasreudite yonigahvararn samaptam |(RASB Tantra, cat., I, p. 109),147, mahasasanasampradayam | kaulottarasarabhutam |(Ibid., p. 108),148, The Devipaficasatika, an important Krama work well-known to the Kashmiris(see fn. 116 above), was copied by a South Indian sannyasin calledVimalaprabodha and is preserved in Nepal, The colophon (NA, MS no. 1/255) readsas follows:iti sripararnhamsasya kule kalikakramapancavimsatyadhikas^tadvayarn srluttaranvayagatam samaptam |149, KRU, 1/399.150, Seefn. 117 above.151, In the Tantras of the Kubjika school, the Pascimamnaya is called a\"Kulakrama.\" We came across expressions such as the following: \"he is a masterbelonging to the Pascimamnaya [a master] in Kula krama\".XXX pascimamnayah sa acaryah kulakrame |(MBT(Y), ft. 26a).Compare also the following expression found in the KMT and recorded in a quotefrom this Tantra in tht BSP, vol. I, p, 60 from NA, MS no. 3/378:XX kramakulasakalam man^alotthanapQrvam |Hie KRU does refer to the school to which it belongs as the Pascimamnaya in afew places but generally prefers to identify itself as belonging to theSrikrama, Kramanvaya or Kulakrama. In the KRU the terms Kula and Krama arefreely interchanged. For example, in one place the Yuvakrama of Kubjika as ayoung maid iyuvati) is said to be worshipped according to the \"Kulapaddhati\"0/63) which a little further on is called \" Kramapaddhati\" (3/67). This is inaccord with the \"Srikulakramamarga \" (3/85), We also come across cognateexpressions such as \"DivyakramapaddhatV (3/174) or fl Srikulapaddhati\" (fl.58a).152. Abhinava*s Tantrdloka can be viewed as an extension of this samephenomenon. One essentia! difference is that this is a work of known authorshipwhich makes no claim to being an original scripture. Even so, however, it is184Notes■ I:'v \"■'■. ';' ! !:IllLin!:;:venerated by Kashmiri Saivites as a sacred text which transmits the doctrines ofthe Trika taught by an enlightened master.153. kalacakrodayam yatra tatra bhaksayate param | evam kramavicarerjadvaitancadvaitalaksanam ||(CMSS, fl. 7b).(The noun \"udaya\" is masculine, not neuter; so read \"-odayo\" in the place of\"-odayam\")154. This process of realization is described in CMSS, fl. 5b-6a.155. KMT, fl. 43b-44a.156. This appellation appears in a verse quoted from the KNT NA, MS no. 1/269 inBSP, vol I, p. 58.157. The Asiatic Society of Bengal preserves possibly unique manuscripts of twoworks by Akulendranatha. We know nothing about the author except that he was afollower of \"Akulamahadarsana\" which in the colophons to one of these works isdefined as a \"bauddhamnaya \" although both works are entirely Saiva. One text iscalled the u Piyusaratnamahodadhi\" (ASB, MS no. 10724 B); the title of the otherhas been lost but is labelled \"sarasawgraha\" (ASB, MS no. 1074 D). The latterwork consists entirely of extracts from sara Tantras amongst which is the CMSS(eighth adhyaya, fl. 24b-6a). The text is written on palm leaf in a form ofNewari script, not younger than the thirteenth century, which thus sets theupper limit for the CMSS's date. The date of the MBT is discussed in appendix C.158. kalasamkarsanl devi kubjika paramesvari |(MBT(Y), fl. 73a).159. sprstasprsti vinirmuktam pascimam kramasasanarn |(MBT(Y), fl. 34a).Following the same form of expression the Kalikrama is called\"uttarakrama-sasana,\" Ibid., fl. 38a.160.

Although we might posit that one source hasborrowed from the other, it seems more probable that this passage was a standardone.162. This proves, incidentally, that Jnananetra alias Sivananda, the revealer ofthe Yonigahvara and founder of the branch of Krama prevalent in Kashmiri, i.e.,that which originated from the Uttarapi|ha, is not to be identified with theSivananda who is worshipped along with his consort Samaya in theDevipaficasatika as some modern scholars maintain (see, for example, Rastogi, p.91).163.

Dr. Goudriaan has delivered a lecture on the Samayamantra of Kubjikadescribed in KMT, chapter 18, in which he has incidentally also demonstratedthat the Para, etc., Mantras of the Kubjika school are those of the Trika asexpounded in chapter 30 of the Tantraloka. Conference on Yantra and Mantra atthe CNRS, Paris, 22/6/84.180. These Mantras are dealt with extensively in the KRU in various places. ForNavaimamantra see KRU, 5/76-78, Bhairavasadbhava and RatUekhara fl. 53-54. Thethree Mantras of Para, etc., are described ibid,, 5/119ff. Not only are theseMantras essentially the same, but the energies associated with them are alsosimilar. There is no need to expect that all the details should coincide asAbhinava himself tells us that there are a number of variants in the form ofthese Mantras and associated principles even in the one Tantra (here he isreferring to the Trisirobhairava TA, 30/27b-28a), However, we find that theeight energies (kala) of the Parapara Mantra are virtually the same as those wefind in the Trmrobhairava, In the KRU (5/121-2a) they are Aghora, Parama-ghora,GhorarOpa, Anana, Bhlma, Bhisana, Vamanl and Pivani. In the passage quoted fromthe TrUirobhairava in TA, vol. V, p, 11 and TA, vol. XII, p. 341 the names andorder are the same, except that Anana of the KRU is called Ghoravaktra. In theMVT, l/I9b-20 these same eight energies are said to create, sustain, destroy andoffer grace. They are associated with the Mantresvaras and Manama ntreSvarasfrom which the seven kofis of Mantras which constitute the cosmic order arecreated,181. So, for exam pie, it is said in the CMSS, (fl. 4b): \"He who knows the threeKulas, that which is beyond the three Kulas, the three states and that which isother than the three states, the three wombs and that which has no womb is thefollower of the tradition\". In the MBT(Y), fl. 72a-b PaScima is described as the\"divine tradition, which removes all impurities and is established in the threeprinciples.\" Groups of three are then listed.182. These three recur persistently in the Pascimatantras as three Kramasthrough which the goddess is worshipped. According to the MBT, in her child(bald) form, Kubjika is called \"Umabhagavatl\" and is described as having sixfaces, five of which are named here: Upper (Malini), East (SiddhayogeSvari),South (Mahalaksmi), North (Mahakail) and West (Kubjika). (MBT(Y) fl. 93a ff.)Malim, which is important in the Trika, is here given pride of place as theupper face, while Siddhayoge^varl is located in the east which reminds us ofTrika *s association with the Purvamnaya, the Eastern Tradition.183. satakotipravistlrnam vyakhyatam khanjinlmatam | evam sa\" sambhavisaktirananta anantatam gata || tasya(h) samprerana yatam sambhavasakt(akta)m anavam |icchajnanakriyasya(s) ca sarpsthtta bhuvanatrayam ||(MBT(Y), fl. 70a).Notes to Part Two187(The last half of the third line reads: \"sambhavasaktam anavam-\" The copyist haswritten \"-akta- \"twice by mistake.

Padoux's standardwork: Recherehes sur La symboliques et L'Energie de la Parole dam certainsTextes Tantriques, Paris 1963. For an account of how these operate as codes inthe Tantras of the Kubjika school, see Schoterman, pp. 182-221.187.

For example, the CMSS acknowledges that it has derived the pithasarnketafrom the Siddhayogeivartmata:samketa esa vikhyatas siddhayogesvarfmate |(fl. 14a).According to this account, there are four pif has, namely, Onkara, Jaiandhara,Purna (girt) and Kamaru. The first is located in the mouth, which represents thecircle of the Sky of Consciousness as the state of withdrawal and suspension ofall extroverted conscious activity. Jalandhara and Purna are in tht right andleft ears respectively while Kamaru resides at the end of the flow of the vitalbreath (pranante).189. The original Trikatantras, such as the SYM and Trisirobhairava, as we havealready had occasion to remark, were Bhairavatantras. Moreover, none of theTrikatantras I have had access to, namely, the published Malini-vijayottara, apart of the SYM and Sritantrasadbhava (NA, MS no. 1/363) ever refer to Trika asa school. The last two simply affiliate themselves to the Vidyapitha of theBhairavasrotas. Another unexpected feature of these Tantras is that they are notKaulatantras although their doctrines, metaphysical presuppositions and ritualsare of a Kaula type. Where Kula is referred to as a ritual pattern, doctrine ortradition, it figures as an element in the broader context of the Tantra as awhole. However, the later Trikatantras, which did think of themselves asbelonging to a Trika tradition, such as the Nisisancara, Kularatnamala,Bhatravakula and Trikasara, define Trika in Kaula terms as the highest Kaulaschool which as such is, in a sense, beyond the Kula tradition. These factsalong with the absorption of Krama doctrine in some form are fundamentalfeatures of the history of the development of Agamic Trika before Abhinavagupta,190. The Paicimatantras, it seems, are so conscious of having absorbed manyTrika elements that at times it becomes necessary for a Tantra in the course ofits exposition of a topic to distinguish what it is going to say about it fromwhat the Trika and others have said. Thus, for example, the MBT proclaims thatit will explain the characteristics of the sacrificial hearth according to thePascima Kula/Kaula tradition (see above p. 62) as explained in the Maharnava-NoteslantraQ) and the common ritual which concerns it, free of Trika and Dak$inaelements:kuntfanam laksanam vaksye kale kaule tu pascime | maharnave laksapade uktam tesarvakarana || olinathas tu samanyam trikadaksinavarjitam |(MBT(V), fl. 8a).(Read \"-karanarn\" for \"-karana\") Similarly the goddess proclaims the purity ofthe Paicima doctrine taught in the KMT by saying that it is free of the Easternportion:idam ca pascimam deva purvabhagavivarjitam |(KMT, fl. 6b).It is quite common in these Tantras, as it is in others, for the speaker to letus know that what he has said or is about to say is new in some respect. The godmay say to the goddess: \"Now I will tell you of a matter I have never revealedbefore/* or \"Hear now the tradition which up to now has been transmitted only byword of mouth,\" or \"Now I will clarify that which has been kept hidden inprevious Tantras\" or \"Know that this form of the deity has never been spoken ofbefore,\" etc. Again, at times, we are told that a topic has been dealt with onlycursorily, in which case the god may say something like \"Now I will explain atlength that which was told to you before concisely.\" Such remarks are clearindications that the tradition is conscious of drawing from external sources(whether these be Tantras which have been set to writing or oral tradition) aswell as contributing something new of its own.191. Judging from the colophons recorded in the BSP, many chapters of the JY arededicated to accounts of the worship of Kali in diverse forms. The names of theKalis mentioned in the colophons are, in the second satka: Kalasankarsani,Yamakali, Gahane^vari, Raktakall, Indivarikalika, Dhanadakalt, Islnakall,Vlryakali, Raktakali and SaptarnakalL In the fourth safka: Mohakall, Amaresvarl,Parantakaii, Meghakall, Priyakall, Stambhakali, Kalaratri, Melapakali,Nityakall, Santikall, Netrakali, Jagatksobhakall, Ghattanakall and Hrdayakali.It is interesting to note in passing that one chapter of this safka is concernedwith the worship of SiddhayogeSvari. Seven chapters in this same section arespecifically labelled as dealing with Kalikulakrama rites (see BSP, Tantra I, p.119 ff,).192. See Goudriaan and Gupta, 1981, p. 52; also Schoterman pp. 5-6.193. Apart from the sacred geography peculiar to these Tantras, we find combinedwith it the general pattern of sacred places referred to in the Kaulatantras andcognate texts as a whole. Representative lists of the latter are found inreferences in the Tantraloka, Nepal hardly ever figures in these lists (anexception to this general rule is YHr, 3/37). The reason for this is probablythat Kaula-oriented Tantra was introduced into Nepal only after the originalredaction of these works. The oldest MSs of these Tantras do not pre-date theeleventh century. Before then the type of Saivism popular in the Kathmanduvalley seems to haveNotes to Part Twombeen of the Siddhanta and Puranic type which prescribed linga worship andconsisted of cults such as that of Umamanesvara described in works like theSivadharma, Sivadharmottara and Sivopanisad. An early tenth century MS of thesetexts (NA, no. 4/ 531) is preserved in Nepal. Similarly early Nepalese MSs ofthe Kiranagama and other Siddhantagamas also exist. Although the earliest Saivacults in Nepal were not Kaula-oriented, a reference to Nepal as one of eightupapi}has occurs in the MBT(Y), fl. 15b. Another reference has been traced in aMS of the NUisancaratantra (NA, MS no. 1/1606) which is written in early Newarlcharacters probably not younger than the twelfth century. Here Pasupati ismentioned as residing in Nepal along with his consort Guhyesvari. Thesereferences suggest that Nepal did not become a centre of Kaula Tantricism muchbefore the eleventh century.194. See Schoterman, p. 6, 37.195. Schoterman, p. 6.196. Practically the only reference to Kubjika apart from in her Tantras is abrief description of her worship in the Agnipurana.

Dr. Kisoranatha iha in his Hindi introduction to the first part of theGuhyakalikhanda of the Afahakalasarnhita (p. 18, fn, 1) informs us that the lateFarmesvara Simha, who was a Maithili Tantric, had a statue of Guhyakall in herten-faced form made and installed in a temple in the village of Madhubam in theBhauragadhi district of Behar. This is the only example he knows of arepresentation of this form of the goddess in India. There is, however, an oldimage of Guhyakall carved in black marble preserved in the Rajputana Museum inAjmer (No. 193, 268), See article by P. K.

Kubjika is also called \"KukaradevP which is not only an abbreviated form ofher name but also the seed-syllable corresponding to the Earth Principle. Theword \"ku\" means \"earth\" and so\"Kuja\" which is one of KubjikS's common namesmeans \"born of the earth\" and \"Kujesvan\"— + 'the goddess born of the earth.\"202. tatha sa kutila vakra madhyamolyam kulesvara | kubjika satprakara cavrddharupena devata ||(MBT(Y), fl. 95a).203. The KMT, fl. 69b says: \"She in whose centre the universe resides and whoresides in the centre of the universe is thus called Khanjika; she who is subtleand present in subtle things.\" These names give rise in their turn to variousnames for the Kubjika school such as \" Khanjinimata.\" \" Khafijinikuta,\"\"Vakrikagama,\" \"Vakrikamata\" as well as \"CincinUa$tra\"oT \"Cincimmata\" and\"Kulalikamnaya\"(for Kubjika as Cincim see below, and as Kulalika the potteress,Notessee Schoterman, pp. 7-9). 204 KRU, 1/72-78.205. prabuddha vritfayakuncya gatram svasthasyati priye |(KRU, n. 77b).206. samsarasagare ghore dus$acaro*tidarune | vikalpakojivakre mahamayamaharnave||(MBT(Y), fl. 69b),(The end of the third quarter is one syllable short.

See also Bagchi pp. 110-11 where this passage is quoted. The JY also acceptsthe standard division of the sastras found in the Agamas into five groups, viz.,Laukika, Vaidika, Adhyatmika, Atimarga and Anava which stands for Mantratantra(see above p. 49). This division of the Mstras into five corresponds to fivefruits they are supposed to yield (JY, fl. 166a).5. The Vaimala along with the Ukula, Mausula and Karuka is one of a standardgroup of four Pasupata sects mentioned in the Agamas and elsewhere. See SvT,11/69-74 and Ksemaraja 1 s commentary. Also Jayaratha on TA, t/33. There areeight Pramanas according to SvT, 10/1134-35. They correspond to eight Rudrasthat have incarnated as Pasupata teachers who founded the following eightPasupata schools; Pancartha, Guhya, RudrahkuSa, Hrdaya, Laksana, Vyuha, Akarsaand AdarSa, (Ibid., 10/1134-5; cf. also TA, 8/328-9).6. The text (fl, 166a) simply reads Guhyadi which I have taken to be a referenceto the Guhyasamajatantra. It is interesting that the JY classifies the Vajrayanasastras as belonging to this group, thus distinguishing them from other Buddhistscriptures which are assigned to the previous one. We should not, however,understand this tomean that the Buddhist Tantras are aligned with the Bhairavaand other similar Saivatantras on an equal footing.7. This account largely agrees with the way the genesis of scripture isgenerally described in the Agamas. According to the Kulamulavatara, out of Siva,who is the supreme cause, tranquil and transcendent, emerges the power of will,followed by those of knowledge and action. Through them, the worlds are created!as is speech in all its expressions (MM, p. 39). Similarly, according to theSvacchandabhairava (quoted in YHr, p, 153) a pure and subtle resonance (dhvani)emerges out of Siva, the cause of all things. This is Speech which is the powerbeyond mind (unmanasakti) that goes on to assume the form of scripture and thespoken word.8. The Agamas regularly refer to the types of relationship that form between theteacher and his disciple through which the meaning of the scripture and therealization it conveys are transmitted. The basic pattern is the same althoughit may vary in individual cases. Abhinava records that according to theKula-mtnamala, there are five relationships: great (mahat\\ intermediate(avantara), divine (divya), divine-cum-nondivine (divyadhya) and mutual{itaretara) (TA, 1/273-4). Bhagavatotpala also refers to five; these are supreme(para), great (mahat\\ divine (divya), other than divine (divyetara) and mutual(itaretarai (Sp.Pra., p, 84). Through these relationships formed between theteacher and disciple and taught at different levels, scripture and its meaningare transmitted from and through the divine consciousness which is its sourceand basis: \"The Lord, Sadasiva, establishing himself on the plane of master anddisciple, brought the Tantra into the world through a series of questions andanswers.\" (SvT quoted in VB, p. 7). There is, as Abhinava explains, an essentialidentity between the disciple who inquires and the teacher who instructs, asboth are embodiments of the one consciousness. The disciple represents theaspect of consciousness whichNotesquestions (prasfrsamvit) and the teacher the aspect which responds (TA, 1 /252-5). Thus as Abhinava says \"relationship {sambandha) is the identity (that isestablished) between the two subjects who question and reply. Its supreme aspectconsists of the revelation of identity in all its fullness. The otherrelationships mentioned in the scriptures must also be considered in the lightof this principle in order that the results one desires etc, may manifest in alltheir fullness\"(TA, 1/275-6).9. Similarly the Svacchandasamgraha says \"this is the Lord Anasrita who has fivefaces each of which bears three eyes and who has one, two, four or ten arms. Heis Sadasiva, the God of the gods who utters the worldly and other scripture. [Itis He who] has spoken the countless Agamas divided into superior and inferior\"(quoted in Y.Hr., p. 271).10. Mahakarunika is probably a Pa^upata sect. The four instruments could alsopossibly be Pure Knowledge, Sound, the Drop and the metres,11. See chapter 45 of this section of the JY.12. We are reminded of Sumati who was Abhinava*s grand teacher of Trika Saivism.He was reputed to have known all five currents of scripture (see commentary onTA, 1/213).13. vamadaksinamisVesu bhinnapHhacatustayam | vyapadisyate mukhyavac cchakhasakhantare sthitam ||(JY, a 168a).(The fifth syllable of the third quarter is long and the sixth short.

(Ibid., fl. 169a).20. Ibid., fl. 182b.21. It is worth noting that the Lakulisapasupata, or at least the branch of itassociated with Musalendra, is linked with the Mantrapifha. Interesting also istheir association with the £si Gautama because in the Puranas he is portrayed asbeing indirectly responsible for the origin of the \"unorthodox* Tantras. Thestory is told in the Kurmapurana (1/15/95 fl.) and the Varaha (chapters 70 and71), Once, the story goes, a long drought devastated the country and afflictedthe inhabitants with severe famine. Amongst the victims was a group of asceticswho, to save themselves, sought Gautama's hospitality in his hermitage inDaruvana. Gautama enjoyed their company and so after the famine was over heinsisted that they continue to stay with him. Although they did not wish to doso, they felt obliged to accept the invitation and so stayed. Once, when Gautamahappened to go away for a few days, they found their opportunity to leave. Theycreated a magic cow which they substituted for a real one in the hermitage. WhenGautama returned, the illusory cow died and the ascetics charged him with itsdeath and so, on the pretext that he had committed a sin, left. After theascetics had gone, Gautama realized that he had been tricked and cursed them tobe outside the Vedic fold (vedabahya). The fallen sages, worried by theconsequences of the curse, invoked Visnu and Siva with hymns in Sanskrit(laukikastotra) entreating them to free them from their sins. Out of compassion,the two gods revealed the heretical (pa?an^a) and deluding scriptures(rnohana-iastra) of the Kapala, Nakula, Varna, Bhairava, Purvapahima* Pancaratraand PMupata.22. Asitanga is fifth in the Dakmatantra list of the PLSS, It is also fifth inthe list of the sixty-four Bhairavatantras in the SKS. Ekapada is thetwenty-fifth Dakmatantra in the PLSS. An Ekapadapurana is listed as the sixthupagama of the Cintyagama. Sekhara is the twenty-first in the Dakmatantra list.A Sivatekhara is the thirteenth upagama of the Cintyagama. Antfta is the name ofthe sixth upagama of the Cintyagama; this may be the Mahamrta. Bhima is thesixteenth Dakmatantra. The Bijabheda which is the twenty-fourth Tantra amongstthe Vamatantras may be the Bijatantra.23. The Viratantra may be the fifth Rudragama or the eleventh upagama of theVlragama. The Can4asidhara is the ninth Bhutatantra. A Bhutatantra is listed asthe fifth upagama of the Atnkumadagama\\ this may be either the Bhutogra orBhutanigraha. Vijaya is the name of the first Rudragama and the eighth upagamaof the Vijaya. The ninth Vamatantra in the PtSS list is called Vijaya while theVijaya is the twenty-ninth Tantra in the §KS list, tyamaratantras are said todeal with magic and are often regarded as a group on their own. Qamara is thesixty-first Tantra listed in the SKS.24. moksavarodhakam yad yat tasya tasya hi vastutalj | nigrahaikaparam yena tenakrodham ud&hrtam ||(JY, fl. 172a).Notes(The word f< krodha\"h a masculine noun; here it is treated as if it wereneuter).25. An Anantatantra is listed as the first upagama of the Vimalagama.Anantavijaya is listed as the twenty-first Vamatantra, Para is the name of theeighteenth Rudragama while Amyta is the sixth upagama of the Cintyagama. Anandais listed as the seventeenth Vamatamra; it is also the name of the sixth upagamaof the Dtptagama.26. For the Sarvavira and SYM see index. A Visvadyamata is the twenty-fourth inthe Bhairavaiantra list of the §KS. Visvavikamha is thirtieth in theDaksinatantra list while the Yoginijalasambara is the twenty-ninth.27. The JY says:savyasrotasi siddhani slra(£)chidrabhayatmakam || nayottaram maharaudrammahasammohanam tatha | trikam etat mahadevi vamasrotasi nirgatam ||We have translated this verse above (p. 36) as follows: u Belonging to theCurrent of the Left are the perfect [Agamas including] the frighteningSirascheda. The three: Nayottara, Maharaudra and Mahasammohana have, O goddess,emerged in the Current of the Left,\" Although this is certainly a possibletranslation of these lines, the JY does not in fact reckon itself to beexclusively amongst the Vamatantras but prefers to classify itself amongst theDaksinatantras. It does, however, also say that it belongs to both Currents (seeabove p. 113), although in the detailed description of the contents of theseCurrents it is amongst those of the Middle Current and so we have listed itthere accordingly.28. The Vcchusmatantra is eighteenth in the Daksinatantralht, thirty-fourth inthe NSA list and seventh in that of the §KS. The Sarvatobhadratantra ismentioned in VST, v. 317 along with the Mahasammohana, It is therefore probablya Vamatamra,29. These are listed further ahead as the eight Tantras which constitute theCakrabheda of the sixty-four Bhairavaiantras.30. A Bhlmasamhita is listed as the fifth upagama of the Karanagama and as thesixteenth Daksinatantra. Tiiaka may be the Tilakodyanabhairava which is thethirty-second Daksinatantra.3L Siddhartha* the first Tantra in this list, may be the Siddhagama which is thesixteenth Rudragama; if so this confirms the JY's statement that the sixremaining Tantras are still ideal rather than actual.32, These gods and goddesses are frequently portrayed as given to orgiasticrevelry or other chaotic behaviour which threatens to disrupt the cosmic,ethical and divine order, Goudriaan (Vinasikhatantra, introduction p. 19) refersus to another example found in the Yogavasisfha (the first half of thenirvanaprakarana 18/24 ff.). Here Tumburu and Bhairava are described asenthroned together and surrounded by eight Mothers {matrka) said to belong tothe Left Current and to be associated with Tumburu. Their appearance andactivity is intense. Their revelry and drunkenness breaks all limits of culturedbehaviour but they are put in their place by Siva.Notes to Appendix C19933. nllarudrodbhavanyadyah sisyas te astastakaSrital? |(JY, H. 177b).34. Trottala is the twenty-seventh Garudatantra in the PLSS list, and theforty-sixth in the NSA list. The Bindusara is the third in the Garudatantra listwhile the Bindutantra is no, 37 in the §KS's list of Bhairavaiantras. Possiblythe Mahodayaiantra corresponds to the Cintamanimahodaya which is the fourthVamatamra in the PLSS list. The Bhutadamara listed here may be the well-knownTantra concerned wth magic of this name. For the Vijayatantra see fn. 23 above.Nitaketu may be the Nilatamra which is the third upagama of the Kiranagama orMlarudraka which is the eighth upagama of the Cintyagama. Mohana is the fourthVamatamra in the PLSS's list. The Sikhatantra may be the Sikhamrta, Sikhayoga orSikhasara which are, respectively, the twelfth, tenth and eleventh in the PLSS'slist of Garudatantras. Karkofa may be the third Bhutatantra. The Daurvasamrtamay correspond to the Daurvasa listed as the twenty-third Vamatamra. Laiita isthe name of the twelfth Rudragama and also that of its first upagama. Bhogineyamay be Bhoga, the first upagama of the Vimalagama.35. The JY defines \"yamaia\"m the worship which takes place through the union ofhusband and wife:dampatyayogatah puja yamaleti nigadyate |(Ibid., fl. 169a).Abhinava refers to a ritual type in the TA which he says is found in a number ofTantras. This involves the projection of Vidya liturgical formulas on the bodyof the Tantric consort and Mantric formulas on the body of the Tantric master asa prelude to ritual intercourse. In this way the female partner becomes theembodiment of the brilliant 'Lunar' energy of the sphere of objectivity and themale, the 'Solar* energy of the sphere,,of cognitive consciousness. These tworepresent the Vidya and Mantra-pifhas respectively which fuse when the coupleunite (TA, 29/I66b-8a), In short \"Mantra\" can also denote the male Tantricpartner and \"Vidya\" the female, while \"yamala\" is the ritual union of the two,36. yamalam yugalam nama mantravidyaikagocaram | jnanakriyatmakam tac caanyonyapeskaya sthitam ||(JY, fl. 182b).37. Ibid., a 174b,38. These Matatantras are virtually those listed below amongst the sixty-fourBhairavaiantras. Note that Lampata which is listed here as an anutantra of theNilakesamata is listed amongst the Matatantras in the SKS.39. Utphullaka is a part of the Sambaramata.40. arthavirbhavabhedena pancasutrojjvalam matam |(JY, fl, 179b), 4L plthabhedavibhinnan tu mulasutram pratisthitam |(Ibid., fl. 169a).42. TA, 28/385b-407.43.

The similarities between this system and that of the modern ascetic orders(particularly those of the Dasanami sannyasins) suggests that they wereinfluenced in their formation by it. Thus each Dasanami order has its owninternal subdivisions called madhis, a word, which is clearly derived from theword \"ma}ha\" of which \"mathika\" is the diminutive. A variant, although notcommon, form of the word mafhika is madhika (see, for example, ibid., fl. 188b)from which we get the word \"madhi.\" Sinha and Sarasvati writing about thecentra! organisation (i.e., the Akhara system) of the Dasanami orders say \"ailthe Dasanami ascetics, excepting the Dandis, admitted that they are divided intofifty-two Madhis—also known as Dhunis , . . Excepting Ashrama and Tirtha allothers in the Ten Names are connected with the Madhi organization.\" This hasalso been noted by Ghurye. The term \"Madhi\" does not signify a recruiting orinitiating centre. Etymologically it is a vernacular diminutive of the Sanskritword \"mafha, \" and in usage it stands for a lineage in spiritual kinship or whatis called \"nada vartsa/'&s the ascetics call it. The names of the Madhisindicate persons. The consideration of Madhi for inheritance also indicates itskinship significance.\" Ascetics of Kashi by Surajit Sinha and BaidyanathNotes to Appendix C201Saraswati, N. K.
