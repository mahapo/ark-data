The thought of Vasubandhu has usually been pre-sented in an overly schematic and perhaps misleading way whichdoes not do justice to this many-sided genius. The writings ofVasubandhu are also very relevant to the present time.In these translations, it has been the goal to avoid the practiseusually followed with Indian philosophical studies, where trans-lated texts are encumbered with the original Sanskrit expressionsin parentheses. This was done tö make the texts as free-flowingas they are in the original, as has been done, for instance, in pre-vious translations of Greek philosophers. Where the originalSanskrit texts exist, these have also been given here, and for keyterms and their translations the reader is referred to the trilingualglossary. Professional Indologists may in fact prefer reading theglossary first, so that they know from the outset the originalSanskrit of technical terms. Logicians, on the other hand, willbe most attracted to the first treatise presented here, and spiritualseekers certainly most to the sixth.The work on this book has taken place over a period of manyyears, and on three different continents. As there is always roomfor critical re-appraisal in such studies, it is true that some fewthings I would do differently at this moment, if I were beginningthese translations now. On the \"prides\", for instance, it is pro-bably better to follow the translation of La Vallee Poussin inKosa V (cf. Discussion of the Five Aggregates, p. 68), though minehas the advantage of avoiding the concepts of \"superior\" and\"inferior\" which Vasubandhu warns us against. It is also well toremember that the ethical categories \"beneficial\" (kusala), \"un-beneficial\" (akusala), and \"indeterminate\" (avyäkrtä) refer notonly to their effect of alleviation or infliction of suffering for others,but also to the \"karmic\" results for the \"agent\" \"himself\". Unlessthis is kept in mind, the statement that beneficial and unbeneficialacts cannot take place without conscious discrimination and voli-tion (p. 62) may be misunderstood, as there may be totally unin-tentional actions harming to others for which the \"agent\" bears"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"( xii )no karmic responsibility according to Vasubandu. As regards thelist of \"motivating dispositions\" (sarfiskära), which have alwaysbeen a source of controversy (even in the third century B.C.!),it is certain that some scholars would translate several of theseitems differently. But my translations are in conformity withVasubandhu's own definitions, and on the whole I am quite happywith them.Like the wandering youth Sudhana in the Gandavyüha-sütra,I can honestly say that I have learned something from everyoneI have ever met.

His name canbe found in any history of Buddhism or of India in the Guptaperiod. However, though many of his numerous works havebeen translated from the original Sanskrit into Chinese andTibetan, and much later at least a few into French, hardly anyhave up to now appeared in English. The seven treatises pre-?sented here, though only a minuscule portion of what he wrote,are complete works with a most varied range of topics, andcan serve at least as an introduction to his thought. Asidefrom the enormous influence he has had on almost the entirerange of subsequent Buddhist writing, Vasubandhu makes parti-cularly interesting reading because of the great scope of hisinterests, the flexibility, originality, and openness of his thought,and his motivation to alleviate suffering, particularly that un-necessary suffering that comes from constricted and constructedmental activity. He has used a great variety of therapeuticmethods for this purpose, and, as a result, his name has a placein the lineages of teachers of practises as diverse as Pure Land1and Zen.2 His works are in intensely diverse literary formats*including religious poetry3, ethical animal fables4, commentarieson sütras5 and treatises, and independent treatises in bothprose and verse. His range of interests is also correspondinglyvast, and his mental consciousness is equally penetrating whendealing with logic6, psychology7, the history of the BuddhistCanon8, medicine9, the most practical instructions for medita-tion10, and the signless melting of all mental borders.11 Hedemonstrates a fertility, flexibility, range, and profundity ofthought that quite overwhelms : by any standards, he is one ofthe greatest of philosophic and therapeutic writers.To Vasubandhu, dogmatic reliance on any one method neverexists, and there may be even within one work multiple and con-stantly unfolding outlooks on a particular range of problems.This is why it is easy to misunderstand the purpose of hiswritings if only some works are considered. There has been a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2   Seven Works of Vasubandhugreat deal of misrepresentation of what Vasubandhu's Mahä-yäna methods are attempting to do, simply because certain fewworks were given a pre-eminent position at the expense of others,and even these weren't always understood. A young man muchinterested in Nägärjuna and the Prajnä-päramitä-sütras oncetermed Vasubandhu a \"reifier\", since it is not generally said,but obvious when one reads widely in his works that anythinghe \"reifies\" he also dissolves. And then there is the standarddiscussion of Vasubandhu as an \"idealist\" philosopher, whichrests mainly on the interpretations of Hsüan-tsang, who seemsto have been most impressed by the preliminary portions ofworks, rather than their* conclusions. Even Vasubandhu'smost conscientious commentators, such as Sthiramati, seemoften to become bogged down in what is least essential—some-times even making distinctions never made by the master him-self.12 Vasubandhu uses such a wide variety of means withsuch skill that it is easy to see how this might happen. TheTibetan historian Bu-ston makes a suggestive statement whenhe says, \"The teacher Sthiramati was even more learned thanhis teacher Vasubandhu in Abhidharma; the venerable Dignägaproved greater than his teacher Vasubandhu in the field of logic,and the saint Vimuktisena excelled his teacher Vasubandhu inthe knowledge of Prajnä-päramitä\"1* Though these gentle-men may have surpassed Vasubandhu in the mastery of oneparticular method, the open-endedness and multiplicity oftherapeutic skills displayed by him is not fully continued byany one of them.More recently, Vasubandhu has been split into two.14 Thosewho assert that there were two great Vasubandhus are put inthe quandary of having to state which works are which Vasu-bandhu's. Neither tradition nor internal evidence supporttheir view. The effect of Vasubandhu's conversion to Mahä-yäna among his former colleagues is well-documented.15 ForVasubandhu is not only a great Mahäyäna philosopher; he isalso a great Abhidharmika, and it is as an Abhiharmika thathe began his writing career. Abhidharma is the ancient Bud-dhist phenomenology of moment-events, and the reductionof psychological processes to such moments. The combina-tion of Abhidharma and Mahäyäna is one of the salient featuresof many of Vasubandhu's treatises* Vasubandhu perhaps"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"General Introduction    3found the wholesale denial of causality in Nägärjuna's stricterworks contrary to the spirit of upäya, \"Skill in means\" takenfor the alleviation of suffering. But ultimately, that is, from thepoint of view of prajfiä, or non-dualistic insight, Vasubandhucannot really assert anything, either. The constructed \"own-being\", that range of events constructed by the mental con-sciousness, is recognized as exactly that, and is observed byVasubandhu to have a constricting suffering-inducing effect ifit is fixedly believed. It is true that present-day Tibetan classi-fications of Buddhist philosophy regard Nägärjuna and Vasu-bandhu as disagreeing. But these are really the disagreementsof sixth-century followers of Nägärjuna and Vasubandhu. Theybelong to a time when Buddhism had become an academicsubject at places such ^as the University of Nälandä. Theymay have disagreed because they were academics fighting forposts and recognition.16Vasubandhu, on the other hand, seems interested in intro-ducing concepts only for the dissolving of previously-held ones,and these new concepts remove themselves later. They areprovisional : once they have had their alleviating effect, theycan be discarded, just as the Diamond Sütra recommends wedo with all Buddhist formulations.17They are makeshift rafts, and once they have taken us acrossa turbulent stream, we do not need to carry them on our backs.It is a \"revolution at the basis\" (äsraya-parävrtti) whichVasubandhu's works point towards—a state of consciousnesswhere all previous modes of thought are abandoned.The seven treatises presented here are arranged in a \"pro-gressive\" fashion. The first work deals with the recognitionof faulty logic in human statements; the second concerns typesof moment-events and their delineations; the third, throughthe scholastic objection-and-reply method, fills up holes in theclassical Abhidharma psychological theory; the fourth andfifth apply the new theory to startling conclusions; the sixthdelineates a path to \"revolution at the basis\", and theseventh points to the deepest insights of a therapeutic methodrooted in meditation (yoga-äcära) and compassion. It is likelythat some people will find certain works more interesting thanothers : the logician will be most attracted to the first, theethical thinker or spiritual seeker most to the sixth, for instance."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4   Seven Works of VasubandhuThe motivating hope behind this work of translation is thatalleviating clarity may be found by those who suffer, that oldcruel and stupid boundaries may vanish, and that the livingworld may find more harmony and bliss.NOTES1. The Pure Land schools of China and Japan strive for the attainmentof the Western Paradise of the Buddha Amitäbha by meditating on his name.There is a treatise dealing with this method ascribed to Vasubandhu. Itis the Sukhävatlvyühopadesa, and is extant in a Chinese translation by Bodhi-ruci. (Taishö no. 1514). It has recently been translated into Englishby Minoru Kiyota (in Mahäyäna Buddhist Meditation : Theory and Prac-tise, University Press of Hawaii, Honolulu, 1978, pp 249-290).2. There is a lot of \"Zen\" in Vasubandhu. Of the treatises presentedhere, the last two are replete with the same kind of insights Zen loves. ButVasubandhu is particularly known in Zen circles for his Commentary onthe Diamond Sütra. (For the later Zen master Han Shan's discussion ofthis work, see Charles Luk, Ctian and Zen Teachings, series one, pp 159-200.)3. The Triratnastotra4.

See the Väda-vidhi, A Method for Argumentation, presented in thisvolume.7. This term would perhaps fit the bulk of Vasubandhu's output.

In fact, the evolving thoughtof a philosopher is rarely seen more strikingly than in the case of Vasu-bandhu. Some of the statements made by Frauwallner reveal a peculiarmisunderstanding of history, as when he says that a person living at thetime of Frederick the Great could easily be confused by someone with thesame name living at the time of Napoleon. Actually, one person couldhave been living in both those times. For instance, my putative ancestor,General QuosdanoviS, when a young man, was defeated by Frederick theGreat; when very old, was defeated by Napoleon.15.

Actually, however, we are comparativelywell informed as regards the great philosopher, and a determina-tion of his date, which will contradict neither what Sanskrit,Chinese, Tibetan, or Arabic sources have to say about his times,is manifestly possible. A brief resume of the problems is how-ever in order.One of Frauwallner's main reasons for assuming two Vasu-bandhus, other than his own distrust of flexibility of thought,is the apparent discrepancies of the Chinese datings of the^master. These had already been resolved by Peri1, and havesubsequently been thoroughly explained by Le Manh That2,as resting on different calculations for the date of the Buddha'sNirvana accepted at various times by Chinese tradition. Byfollowing, all that is contained in Chinese tradition regardingthe matter, both Peri and Le Manh That arrive at the fourthcentury A.D. for Vasubandhu's approximate time. Their con-clusion seems obvious when one considers that Kumärajiva(344-413) knew and translated works by Vasubandhu, whichfact has in turn been the subject of vast and thoroughly sterileinvestigations as to the authenticity of th^se ascriptions, wheth-er the \"K'ai-che Vasu\" given by Kumärajiva as the authorof the Satasästrabhäsya can in fact be taken as \"Vasubandhu\".and so on. Actually, as Peri has already shown, this work inone portion has the complete name, ^nd \"K'ai-che Vasu\"is also the only name given to the great master Vasubandhu inthe colophon of the Mahäyänasangrahabhäsya, as well as else-where in Chinese sources. From the Chinese^side, we alsofind that Kumärajiva is said to have written a biography ofVasubandhu (unfortunately lost today) in the year 4093, andthat Hui-yüan (344-416) quotes a verse of Vasubandhu's Vint-satikä4. It should also be noted that the Bodhisattva-bhümiof Vasubandhu's older brother Asanga was already translatedinto Chinese in the years 414-421.5"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"S   Seven Works of VasubandhuIt has been said that the Indian tradition regarding Vasubandhu,as found in his biographer Paramärtha and several scatteredliterary notes in Sanskrit, contradicts the possibility of thefourth century as Vasubandhu's approximate time. Para-märtha calls Vasubandhu the subject of Kings Vikramädityaand Bäläditya. These have been assumed to be the Guptaemperors Skandagupta Vikramäditya (455-467) and Narasimha-gupta Bäläditya I (467-473), respectively. However, thereis evidence from Vämana that the Bäläditya who became apupil of Vasubandhu was, in fact a son of Candragupta II, themost famous bearer of the biruda \"Vikramäditya\" (375-415).*]No son of Candragupta II is specifically mentioned in inscrip-tions as having the cognomen \"Bäläditya\". Le Manh Thatsuggests that the curious title \"Bäläditya\" (\"Young Sun\") mayhave been used by Gupta princes in their minority.6 Thus\"Bäläditya\" may have been a title of Candragupta's son Kumära-gupta I before ascending the throne. But it is- more likely, inview of the fact that he is known to have functioned as \"YoungKing\" (yuvaräja) during the life-time of his father, that this\"Bäläditya\" was Govindagupta, who seems to have been the oldestson of Candragupta II. However, it is argued, Govindaguptais not known to have ascended the throne, which both Vämanaand Paramärtha claim for Vasubandhu's pupil, and the deathof Candragupta II, in 415, would bring us to too late a datefor Vasubandhu, who is known to have lived eighty years, andto have seen the accession of Bäläditya, but yet influenced Kumä-rajiva with Mahäyäna treatises as early as 360, and must havebeen dead by 409, the date of his earliest biography. Le ManhThat has taken the rather radical course of doubting the verydates of the Gupta kings, which rest on the testimony of the*The passage, in Vämana's Kävyälankärasütravrtti, reads :\"Soyam samprati-Candragupta-nayas candra-prakäso yuvä /jäto bhüpatir äsrayah krta-dhiyäm distyä krtärthasramah'//Äsrayah krta-dhiyäm ity asya Vasubandhu-säcivyopaksepa-paratvät säbhi-präyatvam.\"\"This very son of Candragupta, young, shining like the moon, a patronof eminent men of letters, has now become lord deserving congratulationson the success of his efforts.The words 'patron of eminent men of letters' contains an allusion to thetutorship of Vasubandhu.\" (Vanavilasam Press edition, p 86)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Vasubandhu, His Life and Times   9Arabic writer al-Birimi. But there is another \"way out\" whichis far more satisfying. It rests on what little we know aboutGovindagupta.Govindagupta was the son of Candragupta II, by his firstqueen Dhruvadevi. According to several traditional Indianaccounts7, Dhruvadevi was originally the wife of CandraguptaII's elder brother Rämagupta, who had ascended the throneat the death of his father, the great conqueror Samudragupta.A Saka ruler, most likely the Satrap of Gujarat and Malwa,Rudrasena IV, took a threatening stance against Rämagupta,and was appeased only by Rämagupta's offer to give Dhruva-devi to him. Thereupon, Candragupta and several companionsdisguised themselves as women, entered the Saka satrap's campas Dhruvadevi and her attendants, and killed him. Acclaimedas a hero, Candragupta shortly after overthrew his brother,and Dhruvadevi in gratitude for his protecting heroism tookhim as her husband. If these events occurred at all (and somemodern scholars have tended to doubt it, because there is noepigraphical evidence8), they transpired around 375, initialregnal date for Candragupta II. Now Govindagupta himselfis known in contemporary sources only from a series of clayseals found and issued at Vaisäli (Besarh).9 Some of them heissued jointly with his mother; some of them with ministersunder his charge. They all bear texts along this order : \"Mahä-räjädhiräja-So-Candragupta-patni- mahäräja- Sri-Govindagupta-mätä-mahädevi- Srl-Dhruvas vämini, Sri-yu varäj a-bhattäraka-padlya-kumärämätyädhikaranasya\", \"Mahäräja-Govindaguptayuvaräja-bhattäraka-padlya-balädhikaranasya\", etc.10 (\"Thegreat Queen Sri Dhruva, wife of Sri Candragupta, Emperor,and mother of the great king Govindagupta, (issues this) fromthe office of the prince-minister to His Highness, the YoungKing\", \"The great king Govindagupta (issues this) from theMilitary Office of his Highness the Young King\".) These in-inscriptions were issued while Candragupta II was still alive,yet Govindagupta had \"ascended the throne\", i.e. as Yava-räja,\"Young King\". What we know about Govindagupta thusdispels all controversy. Neither Paramärtha or Vamana sayanything about the death of Vikramäditya or Candragupta;they only say that his son ascended the throne during the life-time of Vasubandhu. As we know from ample other sources,11"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10   Seven Works of Vasubandhuit was common in the Gupta age for Kings to consecrate theirown sons as \"Young Kings\" long before their own death. Thiswas a full-fledged anointing ceremony, in every way comparableto the total ascension to the throne, and usually involved subse-quent administration of given provinces by the newly-conse-crated \"young king\". It was both a method of giving the princetraining in ruling, as well as a more Kautilyan expedient ofassuring the continuance of the dynasty. We find parallel in-stances in the European Middle Ages, such as when the HolyRoman Emperor Frederick II appointed his son Henry Kingin Germany. In classical India, however, these appointmentsof \"Young Kings\" seem to have been the general rule. Thusthe Pallava king defeated by Samudragupta was Visnugopa-varman, second son of the reigning King Skandavarman II»and \"Young King\" of Kärlci. The practice seems to have beenancient in India, for in the Mahäbhärata, Duryodhana is called\"king\" during the life-time of his father Dhrtarästra.The usual age at which the prince acceded as \"Young King\"was sixteen years. In the case of Govindagupta, this seemsto have been c. 391, and the particular province given him wasthe central Gangetic valley, including the towns of Ay odhyä andVaisäli. As c. 390 is the beginning date of Candragupta IFscampaign against the Saka Satrap Rudrasimha III of Gujaratand Malwa, it seems probable that Govindagupta was madeGovernor of the ancestral realm in order to give the people aroyal symbol during Candragupta's extended absences fromhome. It is in fact known that Candragupta II during hiscampaigns for a time had Ujjain as his capital.12 At the end of thesecampaigns, he apparently re-established his capital at Pataliputra,as it is called the capital by Fa-hsien (iri India 399-414).Thus there is no necessity for going against any traditionwhatever. Taking into account the possibility that Vasubandhumay have lived beyond his pupil Govindagupta's consecration as\"Young King\", we may arrive at an arbitrary but plausible date,316-396, for Vasubandhu. This should be taken as no morethan a hypothesis, but it is at least one which will please alllovers of traditional history.13 It also places Vasubandhu in oneof the most brilliant ages in Indian history, and associates himwith one of her most brilliant courts; Among countless othereminent men who may be mentioned as his contemporaries,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Vasubandhu, His JLife and Times   11the great poet Kälidäsa, the lexicographer Amarashpha,.and the Mimämsä philosopher Sabara were in all probabilityat the same court that invited Vasubandhu to his most famousdebates, and to his most famous tutoring position. Whetherhis pupil Govindagupta ever fully ascended the throne is doubt-ful, though there are allusions in Subandhu14 to troublesometimes after the death of Candragupta II, so perhaps a strugglebetween Govindagupta and his brother Kumäragupta I, inwhich the latter emerged victorious, is to be assumed. Onthe other hand, Govindagupta may have pre-deceased his father.At present we have no way of knowing.The details of Vapbandhu's life are known from severalbiographies in Chinese and Tibetan, the earliest of which isthe Chinese rendering of the life of Vasubandhu by Paramärtha(499-569), who composed it while in China.15 There was, asmentioned, apparently a previous account by Kumärajiva, whichhas not survived. The earliest Tibetan biography available tome is a good deal later—it is that of Bu-ston (1290-1364). Inaddition, there are several references to Vasubandhu m the worksof Hsüan-tsang, Bäna-bhatta, Vämana, and other writers. Weshall attempt to reconstruct the main outlines of Vasubandhu'slife, relying most heavily on Paramärtha, and supplying datesfor the main events, so that the dating of Vasubandhu presentedhere can be put to the test. Some of this material is no doubtlegendary, but nonetheless^ interesting as a light on how Vasu-bandliu was viewed by later generations.Vaäubandhu was born in Purusapura, present-day Peshawar»in what was then the Kingdom of Gändhära, around the year316 A.D. According to Paramärtha, his father was a Brähmanaof the Kausika gotra, and his mother was named Virifici. Thecouple already had a previous son, later called Asanga,and a third, nicknamed Virincivatsa, was to follow.16 Vasu-bandhu's father was a court priest, and, according to the laterTibetan historian Täranätha, was very learned in the Vedas.17In all probability, he officiated at the court of the Saka princesof the Silada clan, who at that time ruled from Purusapura.iaAccording to the Tibetan historians, Asanga and Vasubandhuwere half-brothers, Asanga's father being a Ksatriya, and Vasu-bandhu's a Brähmana.19 According to them, the mother ofAsanga and Vasubandhu was named Prasannasllä.20"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12   Seven Works of VasubandhnGändhära was no longer at that time the heart of a great empire,as it had been under the last Kushan Emperors a century before;it had become a border land in the midst of small kingdoms,and perhaps the amazing decline in its population, which Hsüan-tsang was to notice, was already taking place at that time. Itwas, however, a very fertile area, and those who were willingto stay in a backwater country suffered no lack of prosperity.Though its ancient artistic tradition was dead by this time, thisbirthplace of the Sarvästiväda masters Dharmasri and the Bha-danta Dharmaträta, kept up its old tradition of scholastic Bud-dhist learning. It was known as the seat of the \"Western mas-ters\"(Päscatiyas) of Abhidharma. The Sarvästivädins, \"theasserters that everything exists\", believed in the reality of externalobjects of consciousness, and further maintained that futureand past events have existence. The main Sarvästiväda move-ment in force in Gändhära was that of the Vaibhäsikas, thosewho took the Mahä-Vibhäsä^GxzdX Book of Options\") as theirauthoritative text. This Vibhäsä is a great scholastic edificeattempting to systematize everything important n Buddhisttheory and practise, and is the result of a great team effort ofthe noted North Indian Buddhist masters gathered in a con-ference called by the Emperor Kaniska two centuries beforethe time of Vasubandhu. Masters known to have taken partin the debates, and whose views are quoted in the book, are theBhadanta Vasumitra, the Bhadanta Dharmaträta, Ghosaka,and Buddhadeva. This tremendous work often reads like acommittee report, with widely varying opinions being offered,but very often it is the opinion of the Bhadanta Vasumitra whichprevails. FoT instance, on explanations of how events \"in thethree times\" differ, the Vibhäsä accepts the theory of the Bha-danta Vasumitra, which states that the difference between pre-sent, past, and future events lie in the state of their efficacy. Inits full efficacy of engendering a consciousness proper to it, anevent is obviously present and momentary. However, it canbe remembered or anticipated : the only difference lies in thefact that as a past or future event, only a mental consciousnesscan apprehend it.21 Many of the views of the Vibhäsäare quiteadvanced. For instance, it maintains that \"time\", a real cate-gory to the Vaisesikas (and to some people today who still speakof \"time\" as a \"dimension\"), is only a name for the flow of con-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Vasubandhu, His Life and Times   13ditioned events.22 At the time of Vasubandhu's youth, a cer-tain dogmatism, certainly not apparent among the masters ofthe Vibhäsä itself, was becoming evident within the Vaibhäsikaschools.According to Täranätha,23 Vasubandhu was born one yearafter his older brother Asanga became a Buddhist monk. Fromthe internal evidence of his works24, Asanga seems to havestudied mainly with scholars of the Mahisäsaka school, whichdenied the Sarvästiväda existence of the past and future25, andwhich posited a great number of \"uncompounded events\"2*In his youth, Vasubandhu may have received from his fathermuch of the Brähmanical lore so obviously at his command,and it may be from him also that he was introduced to the axi-oms of classical Nyäya and Vaisesika, both of which influencedhis logical thought.The name \"Vasubandhu\", which he never changed even uponentering the Buddhist priesthood, may perhaps tell us some-thing about the character of its bearer. It means \"the Kinsmanof Abundance\", in particular the abundance of the Earth, andhis retention of this name, in view of his genuine concern for thewell-being of others, as well as his love of metaphors from teem-ing plant-life, rushing streams, and rippling lakes, is probablynot entirely coincidental.While learning with the Mahisäsakas, Asanga came intocontact with the Prajhä-päramitä-sütras of Mahäyäna Buddhism,which was completely overturning the older monastic Buddhistideal in favour of a life of active compassion to be crowned bycomplete enlightenment. Not being able to understand them,and not gaining any insight into them from his teachers, heundertook lonely forest-meditations. But after twelve yearsof meditation, he felt he had gained nothing. So he decidedto give up seeking enlightement. Just at that moment, a miser-able dog dragged itself across Asanga's path. Its wounds werefilled with squirming maggots. Asanga, filled with compassion,decided to remove the maggots from the dog with his tongue(as he was afraid his fingers would hurt them), and to cut offa piece of his own flesh for them to live in. At that moment,the dog disappeared, and the Bodhisattva Maitreya stood be-fore him. Maitreya told Asanga to show him to the people,but none could see him in his total form. (One old woman is"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14   Seven Works of Vasubandhusaid to have seen Asanga carrying a puppy, and to have becomevery wealthy thereafter.)Maitreya dictated five works to Asanga, which are usuallyconsidered to be the Abhisamayälankära, the Mahäyänasüträlan-kära, the Madhyäntovibhäga (of which an English translationis included in this volume), the Dharmadharmatävibhäga, andthe Ratnagotravibhäga. He also introduced him to the Dasa-bhürnika-sütra, which details the path of a Mahäyänist.The interpretations of this Maitreya story are varied. Wasthis Maitreya a private vision of Asanga's? Was he a hermit-philosopher whose works Asanga published? Is he a piousfiction? Some modern scholars wish to dismiss the Maitreyastory altogether as a later fabrication.27 But it is interestingthat Vasubandhu himself distinguishes the author of the Madhyä-ntavibhäga, Maitreya(nätha), from its \"expounder to us andothers\", Asanga.28 Furthermore, the style of the works as-cribed to Maitreyanätha and those all admit to be by Asanga,is very different. The first are compact often to a cryptic point;the latter are very wordy but also very clear. In this book, Maitre-yanätha and Asanga will be distinguished from one another onthe basis of the suggestion of these facts. At any rate, Asangabecame the first main disseminator of the Yogäcära method ofpractising Mahäyäna. The name \"Yogäcära\", \"practise ofYoga\", indicates the primary importance of meditation forthis method.In the meantime, Vasubandhu had entered the Sarvästivädaorder, and was studying primarily the scholastic system of theVaibhäsikas. Apparently he remained impressed with thisall-encompassing structure for some time. He in turn amazedhis teachers with the brilliance and quickness of his mind. Hismain teacher seems to have been a certain Buddhamitra.In time, however, grave doubts about the validity and rele-vance of Vaibhäsika metaphysics began to arise in Vasubandhu.At this time, perhaps through the brilliant teacher Manoratha,he came into contact, with the theories of the Sauträntikas, thatgroup of Buddhists who wished to reject everything that wasnot the express word of the Buddha, and who held the elabo-rate constructions of the Vibhäsä up to ridicule. That therewas a strong Sauträntika tradition in Purusapura is likely inview of the fact that it was the birthplace of that maverick"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Vasubandhu, His Life and Times   15philosopher of the second century, the Bhadanta Dharmaträta.In fact, the most orthodox Vaibhäsika seat of learning was notin Gändhära, but in Kashmir, whose masters looked down theirnoses at the Gändhärans as quasi-heretics. According to Hsüan-tsang's pupil P'u-k'uang* Vasubandhu finally decided to go toKashmir to investigate the Vaibhäsika teachings more exactly.29Fearing that the Kashmirian scholars might distrust his inten-tions if they knew he was a Gändhäran> he entered Kashmirunder a false name.30 P'u-k'uang's account does not explain,however, how he could cross the -border. The later Tibetantradition does this by stating that Vasubandhu entered Kashmirunder the guise of a \"lunatic\".31 This story is told by Para-märtha in reference to an earlier Abhidharmika, Vasubhadra,32but it is so suggestive for Vasubandhu's activities that it willbe interesting to tell it here. For unlike nowadays, at least inthe West, where the so-called \"insane\" are quickly incarcerated,in India they were and often still are free to roam about at will.Posing as one would mean that Vasubandhu would have nodoors barred to him. It is very interesting that Vasubandhu,who is so adamant on the point that there is no difference be-tween a so-called hallucination and what is conventionally termed\"reality\", could have convincingly taken on a \"schizophrenic\"manner of relating to his environment. \"He was always inthe great assembly hearing the Dharma, but his manner wasstrange and incongruous, and his speech and laughter were ill-assorted. Now he would discuss in the assembly the princi-ples of the Vibhäsä, then he would inquire about the story ofthe Rämäyana- The people thought lightly of him, and thoughhearing him talk, disregarded him.\"33Bu-ston says that Vasubandhu in Kashmir entered the schoolof Sanghabhadra.34 But it is unlikely that this intellectuallyacute and cantankerous individual assumed the professorshipat that time, for, from what both Paramärtha and Hsüan-tsangtell us35, Vasubandhu and Sanghabhadra seem to have beenabout the same age. It is, however, more than likely that itw^srthe school Sanghabhadra was himself attending as a stu-dent, and this is in fact attested by P'u-k'uang.36 He says thatthe main master there was the teacher of Sanghabhadra, whosename is given in Chinese transcription as Sai-chien-ti-lo or Sai-chien-t'o-lo. This name has been variously interpreted as"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16   Seven Works of Vasubandhu\"Skandhila\" or \"Sugandhara\", though P'u-k'uang's translation*|3| J^ fits neither of these reconstructions. Sai-chien-ti-lo, whatever his Sanskrit name may have been, is known as theauthor of the brief but incisive Abhidharmävatära, an orthodoxVaibhäsika treatise preserved both in Chinese37 and Tibetan38translations.Vasubandhu studied in Kashmir for four years, probably fromabout 342 to 346. He was however no docile student, but ratherin his increasing frustration with the over-intellectual and cate-gory-ridden dogmatics of the Kashmirian masters, frequentlyvoiced his own refutations of many of their points.39 The mas-ter Sai-chien-ti-lo, disturbed by the obstreperous student, wentinto deep meditation, by the powers of which he discoveredVasubandhu's true origin. He then told Vasubandhu privatelythat he should return to Gändhära before his \"uncultured stu-dents\", among whom one can well imagine the sharp-tonguedSanghabhadra, found out and attempted to harm him. Vasu-bandhu, doubly convinced that the Vaibhäsika system did notreflect true Buddhism, decided to go home. But when hereached the border of Kashmir, the guards (who supposedly hadsupernormal insights and hence are called \"yaksas\" in thestory) said that a great scholar of the Abhidharma was aboutto leave the country. The people remembered Vasubandhuas a \"lunatic\", but decided to have him questioned by somescholars, anyway. But Vasubandhu's speech became free-associative, jumping from topic to topic, and the scholarsdid not understand him. They let him go. The guards a secondtime sent him back. He was re-examined, with the same result.Finally, on his fourth attempt, he was allowed to cross the border,the scholars being convinced that he was a \"lunatic\", and henceshould not be disturbed.40Vasubandhu returned to Purusapura. He began to preparefor an enormous project that had been in his mind for sometime. He was at this time unattached to any particular order,and lived in a small private house in the middle of Purusapura.(Hsüan-tsang three centuries later saw this house, which wasmarked with a commemorative tablet.41) According to Para-märtha, Vasubandhu supported himself by lecturing on Bud-dhism before the general public, which presumably remunerated"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Vasubandhu, His Life and Times   17him with gifts. Such was the customary income for Buddhistpublic lecturers even in the days of the Astasähasrikä-prajnä-päramitä^ At the close of each day's lecture on the Vaibhä-sika system, Vasubandhu composed a verse which summed uphis exposition for the day.43 Paramärtha says, \"Each verse wasengraved on a copper plate. This he hung on the head of anintoxicated elephant, and, beating a drum made the followingproclamation : 'Is there anyone who can refute the principlesset forth in this treatise? Let him who is competent todo so come forth !•' \"44 , So in time he composed over six hun-dred verses, which gave an extensive outline of the entire Vai-bhäsika system. These constitute the Abhidharma-kosa* Vasu-bandhu sent it, along with fifty pounds of gold, to his old teach-ers in Kashmir. Though Sai-chien-tf-lo himself cautioned them,all the others at the Kashmir school exulted that Vasubandhuhad come over to their side, and had composed such a brilliantepitome of Vaibhäsika doctrine besides. They were disturbedonly because Vasubandhu in his treatise so often used termssuch as \"kila\" (\"it is claimed\") and \"ity ähuh\" (\"so they say\")*As a matter of foct, during this entire time, Vasubandhu wasworking on his real project, his autocommentary on the Kosaywhich contains a thoroughgoing critique of Vaibhäsika dogma-tics from a Sautrantika viewpoint. He found a chance to pub-lish this Kosa-bhä$ya when several of the Kashmirian scholars,puzzled by the abstruseness of many of the verses in the Kosa,sent his fifty pounds of gold back with an additional fifty, andasked him to write a commentary. Vasubandhu sent themhis Kosa-bhäsya, by this time completed. For the subsequentfurious indignation of the orthodox Vaibhäsikas, we need notrely on traditional accounts only—it is amply attested by therelentless invective employed by contemporary Vaibhäsikawriters such as Sanghabhadra and the Dipakära. Vasubandhuwas to the latter \"that apostate\", \"that subscriber to theoriesthat please only fools\"45, and the sharp-tongued Sanghabhadra•The Pudgala-pratisedha-prakarana, \"A Discussion for the Refutation ofPersonality\", may be the only extant work by Vasubandhu written priorto the Kosa. This seems likely in view of the fact that its arguments andsolutions are less developed. It was originally an independent treatise»but was finally attached by Vasubandhu to the Kosa as its last chapter. Inthis book, it will be referred to as \"Kosa IX\"."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18   Seven Works of Vasubandhucould hardly find words harsh enough to vent his spleen : \"thatman whose theories have the coherence of the cries of a maddeaf-mute in a fever-dream.\"46Vasubandhu had thus at a fairly early age achieved a certainnotoriety. His book was to become the standard Abhidharmawork for the unorthodox in India47, and, due no doubt in partto his subsequent fame as a Mahäyäna master, in China, Japan,Tibet, and Indonesia, as well.In the years directly following the composition of the Kosa,Vasubandhu seems to have spent much time in travelling fromplace to place. It is certain that he stayed for a time at Säkala,the modern Sialkot.48 This town was at this time the capitalof the Mädraka Republic. Around 350, Samudragupta com-pleted his lightning-quick conquest of North India, and the fateof Bhäratavarsa was sealed. The elected executive council ofthe Mädraka Republic, along with so many other frightenedrulers of the frontiers, rendered its personal obeisance to theEmperor.49It was, in all probability, subsequent to that event that Vasu-bandhu, as well as his teachers Buddhamitra and Manoratha,decided to move to Ayodhyä.50 Ayodhyä, the ancient city ofRäma, had become one of the main metropolises oKthe newGupta Empire. Vasubandhu took residence in the old San-ghäräma of the city51, and Hsüan-tsang later saw the hall inAyodhyä where Vasubandhu preached to \"kings and manyeminent men\".62Vasubandhu had, up to this time, but little regard for the Yogä-cära treatises of his elder brother. He had perhaps seen thevoluminous Yogäcärabhümi compiled by Asanga, which mayhave simply repelled him by its bulk. At any rate, he is reportedto have said : \"Alas, Asanga, residing in the forest, has prac-tised meditation for twelve years. Without having attainedanything by this meditation, he has founded a system, so difficultand burdensome, that it can be, carried only by an elephant.\"53Asanga heard about this attitude of his brother, and decidedto attempt to open him up to the Mahäyäna. He sent two ofhis students with Mahäyäna texts to Vasubandhu. The eveningthey arrived, they recited the Aksayamati-nirdesa-sütra. In thissütra, a figure from outer space teaches the terrestrial denizensabout the absence of own-being, the absence of existing and ceas-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Vasubandhu, His Life and Times   19ing, and the absence of any detriment or excellence, in all eventsand \"personalities\".54 This sütra seems to have greatly appeal-ed to the critical mind of Vasubandhu. He told Asanga'sstudents that he thought the logical principles of Mahäyänawere well-founded, but that it seemed to have no practice. Thenext morning, Asanga's students recited the Dasabhümika-sütra,which relates to the path of the Bodhisattva, who remains activein the world for the removal of suffering. Hearing this text,Vasubandhu saw that the Mahäyäna had a well-founded prac-tice, too.55 He so regretted his former disregard for it that hewanted to cut off his own tongue.56 Asanga's students quicklyintervened, urging him instead to visit his brother. So Vasu-bandhu went to visit Asanga in Purusapura. In the discussionson Mahäyäna, which the two brothers held, Vasubandhu graspedthe meanings immediately, whereas Asanga always took sometime to make his replies. Asanga urged Vasubandhu to usehis superior mental consciousness to study, spread, and inter-pret the Mahäyäna.Vasubandhu seems to have been quite overwhelmed by Mahä-yäna literature. His desire to read the enormous Satasähas-rikäprajnä-päramitä-sütra led him to read it all the way throughwithout stopping, which took him fifteen days and nights, whichhe spent in a tub of sesame-oil.57 The study of that huge workhe regarded as of utmost importance. In that immense medi-tation, entities of a most diverse kind are brought up and madedevoid of own-nature and \"empty\".In view of the fact that they were the texts that convertedhim to Mahäyäna, Vasubandhu's commentaries on the Aksaya-matinirdesa-sütra58'and the Dasa-bhümika may59 be his earliestMahäyäna works. These were followed by a series of commen-taries on other Mahäyäna sütras and treatises. According tothe Tibetans, his favorite sütra was either the Satasänasrikä-prajnä-päramitä, or the Astasähasrikä*0 That these texts shouldhave pleased a man who so loved argument, and who in addi-tion had such a great sense of humour, is hardly surprising, asthey reveal the most profound insights through mind-bogglingdialogues that are never far from laughter.Since the output of Vasubandhu's Mahäyäna works is prodi-gious, he was probably writing new treatises every year. Sohe could have been a very famous Mahäyäna master by the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"20   Seven Works of Vasubandhuyear 360, the approximate date in which Kumärajiva took in-struction from Bandhudatta in Kucha. By this time, Vasubandhucould easily, have written those works which Bandhudatta trans-mitted to his brilliant pupil. Actually only one is specificallyknown to have been studied by Kumärajiva in his youth : thiswas a commentary on the Saddharmapundarika-sütra, whichby its very nature is likely to have been an early Mahäyäna workof Vasubandhu.61The year 376 brings Candragupta II, Vikramäditya, tothe throne of the Gupta Empire. As famous for his liberalpatronage of learning and the arts, as for his successful mainte-nance of the Empire, his reign marks one of the high points inthe classical Indian period. And Ayodhyä, where Vasubandhuagain took up his abode, became for a while the Emperor'scapital-in-residence. It may have been shortly after this datethat a great debate occurred, which was to stick in the mindsof the Buddhist biographers.Philosophical debating was in classical India often a spec-tator-sport, much as contests of poetry-improvisation were inGermany in its High Middle Ages, and as they still are in theTelugu country today. The King himself was often the judgeat these debates, and loss to an opponent could have seriousconsequences. To take an atrociously extreme example, whenthe Tamil Saivite Nänasambandar Näyanär defeated the Jainäcäryas in Madurai before the Pändya King Märavarman Ava-nisülämani (620-645) this debate is said to have resulted in theimpalement of 8000 Jains, an event still celebrated in the Mmä-ksl Temple of Madurai today. Usually, the results were notso drastic : they could mean formal recognition by the defeatedside of the superiority of the winning party, forced conversions,or, as in the case of the Council of Lhasa, which was conductedby Indians, banishment of the losers. One of the most stirringdescriptions of such a debate is found in the account of Para-märtha, where he describes how the Sänkhya philosopherVindhyaväsin challenged the Buddhist masters of Ayo-dhyä, in the presence of Emperor Candragupta II himself. Atthat time both Vasubandhu and Manoratha were absent fromAyodhyä, \"travelling to other countries'XVasubaadhu seemsreally to have enjoyed a peripatetic existence), and only the oldBuddhamitra was left to defend the Dharma.

When Vasubandhu laterreturned, he was enraged when he heard of the incident. Hesubsequently succeeded in trouncing the Sänkhyas, both indebate and in a treatise, Paramärthasaptati. Candragupta IIrewarded him with 300,000 pieces of gold for his victory overthe Sänkhyas.62 These Vasubandhu employed for buildingthree monasteries, one for the Mahäyänists, another for hisold colleagues the Sarvästivädins, and a third for the nuns.Refutations of Vaigesika and Sänkhya theories had been pre-sented by Vasubandhu already in the Kosa, but it was perhapsfrom this point onward that Vasubandhu was regarded as aphilosopher whose views bould not be lightly challenged.The meditative career of Vasubandhu is of course less easyto trace than his writing activity. In the Zen lineages63, Vasu-bandhu is called the pupil of a certain Jayata*. Whoever thisJayata was, he seems to have introduced Vasubandhu to themethod of \"meditating without props\". Many of Vasubandhu'sworks, including The Commentary on the Separation of theMiddle from Extremes presented here, show his great interestin the techniques of meditation. Hsüan-tsang says : \"Vasu-bandhu Bodhisattva was attempting to explain that which isbeyond the power of words to convey, and which came to himby the mysterious way of profound meditation.\"64Around the year 383, at his eighth birthday65, the crownprince Govindagupta Bäläditya was placed by the Emperorunder the tutelage of Vasubandhu. The Empress Dhruvadevialso went to Vasubandhu to receive instruction.66 This indi-cates that Candragupta II must have been secure in his imageas a just ruler, for the Yogäcärin is potentially a political activ-ist, if compassion demands it. In Asanga's Bodhisattva-bhwniit is stated that though non-harming is usually to be strictlyobserved, a Bodhisattva may be compelled to kill a king if thisis the only way one can stop him from committing atrocities.67It is tempting to speculate on the effect of Vasubandhu's tutor-ship on his royal students. He may have done much to alle-viate the conditions of the thousands subject to the Guptas.He is known to have founded many hospitals, rest-houses, andschools. That his compassion was not theoretical but practical*This name is also given as Säyanta, for instance in the list of patriarchs of theDharma cited by Bu-ston (II, 109) from a commentary on the Lahkävatära-sütra."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22   Seven Works of Vasubandhucan also be seen by the accounts which tell us of his helpingquench the great fire that broke out in Räjagrha, and his doingthe utmost to help stop an epidemic in Janäntapura.68In some Tibetan accounts, Vasubandhu is associated with theUniversity of Nälandä.69This may or may not be an anachronism.He is known to have passed his technique of no-prop medita-tion on to his old associate Manoratha. His most famous pupil,according to tradition, was Dignäga.70In his old age, Vasubandhu seems to have taken up the wan-dering life again. Some of his last works are known to havebeen written in Säkala and in Kausämbi.71 Kausämbi, forinstance, is the place where he wrote his Twenty and ThirtyVerses, and Hsüan-tsang saw the old brick tower there, nearthe ancient Sanghäräma of Ghosira, where these famous expo-sitions of Yogäcära thought were written.Around the year 391, the consecration of Govindagupta as\"Young King\" took place. He and his mother begged Vasu-bandhu to settle down in Ayodhyä and accept life-long royalsupport. Vasubandhu accepted the offer. The master wascreative even at his advanced age, and more than a match forVasuräta, the Young King's grammarian brother-in-law, inhis favorite sport of debate. With the sums of money he re-ceived as remuneration for his debating victories, he built severalrest-houses, monasteries, and hospitals in Ayodhyä, Gändhära,and Kashmir. But primarily, as Hsüan-tsang tells us, Vasu-bandhu was going farther and farther with his contemplativeexercises.72 Debate was to him mainly upäya : if it could leadto no one's interest in Mahäyäna, he would not engage in it.Thus, when Sanghabhadra, who had written his two great trea-tises, one of which is a furious denunciation of the Kosa Bhä$ya9challenged Vasubandhu to defend the KoscCs statements, andwas invited to come to court and debate by the jealous Vasuräta,Vasubandhu told his pupils that he could see no good reasonfor such a debate, but diplomatically sent the official answerthat Sanghabhadra would indeed be hard to defeat. He prob-ably knew from his student days that Sanghabhadra wouldnot be convinced by anything, and, besides, the Kosa itself wasprobably no longer very important to him at the time.

In theeightieth year of his life, c. 396, he died. Tradition is unani-mous in saying that he died at eighty, but there are various ver-sions as to the place of his death. Paramärtha says that he diedin Ayodhyä75, but Bu-ston may be correct when he says thathe died in the northern frontier countries, which he calls \"Nepal\".70For Hsüan-tsang corroborates the information that Vasubandhuwas in the northern frontier at the time of Sanghabhadra's chal-lenge to debate, which according to all traditions was one ofthe last events in Vasubandhu's life. He says that Vasubandhuwas at that time in Säkala, where the Teaching of the Three Own-Beings, possibly Vasubandhu's last work, was written.77 Bu-ston gives an interesting detail about this last journey of themaster. He says that while Vasubandhu was in the north, hewent to visit a monk named Handu. Handu was inebriated,and carrying an immense pot of wine on his shoulder. Vasu-bandhu upon seeing this cried, \"Alas! The Doctrine will goto ruin\", recited the Usnisa-vijaya-dhärani in reverse order, anddied.78 According to Täranätha, however, Vasubandhu wasprompted to recite the dhäranl in reverse order when he saw amonk ploughing in his monastic robes.79 Such is the accountof his life, filled with prodigious activity, which can be recon-structed from the copious data of his biographers.The \"personality\" of Vasubandhu which emerges from hisworks and his biographies shows him as a man filled with greatcompassion for the mental afflictions of others, and with aconcern for their physical well-being, as well.

Two additional problems which have sometimes been raised to givecredence to the existence of two Vasubandhus rest on textual misinterpre-tation. It has been said that Yasomitra, the famous commentator of Vasu-bandhu's Kosa, himself believes in two Vasubandhus, as there are refer-ences to a \"Vrddhäcärya Vasubandhu\" whose views are combated by theauthor of the Kosa. An investigation of the text does not bear this out.\"Vrddhäcärya Vasubandhu\", or \"Sthavira Vasubandhu\", is named onlythree times in Yasomitra, at Vyäkhyä ad I 13-14 c; ad III 27; and ad IV,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Vasubandhu, His Life and Times   252b-3b. The first of these passages says that it is the Vrddhäcärya Vasu-bandhu's opinion regarding unmanifest action, that it be called \"material\"because it depends on the material elements of the body. (cf. A Discus-sion for the Demonstration of Action, note 3). This is, as a matter of fact,the opinion adopted by the Kosa itself. The second passage was not mistranslatedby La Vallee Poussin, rather it is Law who changed the original text, as theTibetan translation shows. But the passage in no way indicates the presence of\"another Vasubandhu\". The meaning of the phrase could be: (\"This is theopinion of) the Master Vasubandhu, when he was the teacher of Manoratha\". Thepassage would then read: \"The phrase 'an additional theorist says that ignorancecomes from improper mental attention' refers to the Master Vasubandhu, whenhe was the teacher of manoratha, and he spoke of this matter in this way.\" Thisis in fact an opinion of the Kosa as well as the Mahäyäna writings of Vasubandhu.(See, in this book, Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes,ad V 20). Vasubandhu was both the pupil and teacher (ct. p. 22) of Manoratha.The third passage states that the Sthavira Vasubandhu and others believethat a flame is destroyed by an absence of a cause of stability. This isagain clearly the position of the great Vasubandhu, as is amply demonstratedIn Kosa IV and the Discussion for the Demonstration of Action. Theobjection \"An absence cannot be a cause\" belongs to the Vaisesika. In«ach of these cases, the opinion attributed to \"Vrddhäcärya Vasubandhu\"or \"Sthavira Vasubandhu\" is in fact the one adopted by the author of theKosa, and one of them does not refer primarily to the opinion of Vasubandhuat all, but to that of Manoratha. It may seem strange that Yasomitra onlyon these occasions names Vasubandhu, whom he usually calls simply \"theMaster\". But in each of these passages, there are several alternative opin-ions listed, so some ambiguity might have resulted from saying simply \"theMaster\". \"Vrddha\" in \"Vrddhäcärya\" does not necessarily mean \"old\";it may simply mean \"eminent\" (Apte, p 1491). Similarly, much has beenmade of the fact that Yasomitra calls Asariga a pürväcärya, \"ancient mas-ter\". Since Yasomitra lived several centuries after Asanga, this shouldnot be surprising. But, besides, the expression may mean simply \"pre-vious master\", i.e. a master prior to Vasubandhu. La Vallee Poussin hasalso used a passage from the Chinese translation of the Samyuktäbhidhar-masära of Dharmaträta, which speaks of a Vasu who wrote an Abhidharmacommentary in 6000 slokas, to support the idea of an older Vasubandhu.(\"Vasubandhu l'Ancien\", BARB 16, 1930, pp 15-39.) But this passagewas inserted as a kind of foot-note by the translator Sahghavarman in theyear 434, and it may in fact refer to our Vasubandhu, whose Kosa has 600verses, easily exaggerated to 6000. Besides, this \"Vasu\" could be \"Vasu-mitra\" or \"Vasubhadra\", names of known Abhidharmikas preceding Vasu-bandhu.The second problem rests on the manner in which Paramärtha organizeshis data in his life of Vasubandhu. It has been assumed that events aretold in chronologial order. This has given rise to problems, becauseVasubandhu's conversion by Asanga is mentioned only late in the text.But as a matter of fact, Paramärtha does not necessarily mention prior eventsfirst.

Itis the earliest of the treatises known to have been written byhim on the subject.1 This is all the more interesting becausethe Väda-vidhi marks the dawn of Indian formal logic. Thetitle, \"Method for Argumentation\", indicates that Vasubandhu'sconcern with logic was primarily motivated by the wish to mouldformally flawless arguments, and is thus a result of his interestin philosophic debate. Topics previously discussed in works-such as the Nyäya-sütra of Gautama (c. 3rd century B.C. ?),the Nyäya-bhäsya of Vätsyäyana (3rd-4th century A.D.), Asanga's\"Rules of Debate\",* and the Buddhistic Tarka-sästra** arealso discussed here. But what distinguishes the Väda-vidhifrom these works is that its discussions of inference containcomplete criteria for determining the logical validity of an argu-ment.In all of these earlier texts, inferences were formulated in afive-membered schema, which is indicated by the following exam-ple :(topic)1. This mountain is fire-possessing (Demonstrandum)2. because it is smoke-possessing (Justification)3. as a kitchen (Parallel Positive Example) and unlike a lake(Parallel Negative Example)4. and this is so (that the mountain is smoke-possessing)5. therefore that is so (that the mountain is fire-possessing).The redundancy of members 4 and 5 was seen by Vasubandhu,who drops them from his schema.*** But there is also some-thing missing from this formulation, says Vasubandhu.**** For,*, ** See Tucci, \"Buddhist Logic Before Dignäga\", JRAS 1929, 151-88,corrections 870-1.***Väda-vidhil 5. That this is an innovation of Vasubandhu's is almostcertain, since Asanga's work and the Tarka-sästra, which can antedate himonly by a little, still retain the five-membered schema.****Väda-vidhi 5."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32   Seven Works of Vasubandhuin an argument, any event could be interconnected with anyother event, as Vasubandhu's examples of spurious argumentsshow.* In other words, it is not clear what the necessaryrelationship between members 1 and 2 is. The Nyäya-sütraassumes a \"logical pervasion\" (vyäpti): in this case, the logicalpervasion of \"smoke-possessing-ness\" by \"fire-possessing-ness.\"But this \"logical pervasion\" is not precisely defined in the Nyäya-sütra, nor is a statement regarding it introduced into the schemaitself. Vasubandhu says that the only way in which somethingcan be validly demonstrated in an argument is if there is a spe-cific indication of the \"logical pervasion\",** and it is, alsohe who gives the first more exact definition of what this termmight mean.*** Earlier definitions had focused on \"regularco-existence\" (sähacarya), i.e. \"Whenever Y is absent, X mustbe absent\", but this definition is not strong enough to handlethe principle of implication. Vasubandhu, however, definesit as an \"invariable concomitance\" (avinäbhäva) between twoevents, meaning that the known event (e.g. \"smoke-possessing-ness\") can occur only if the deduced event (\"fire-possessing-ness\") occurs.2 He also insists that a statement of the invari-able concomitance between the perceived and deduced eventsis necessary to a valid inference-schema.Using Vasubandhu's methods for formalizing an inference,the \"fire-smoke\" argument can be re-phrased as follows :(topic)1. Thesis : This mountain is fire-possessing (Demonstrandum)2. Justification : because of its state-of-possessing-smokeand wherever there is a state-of-possessing-smoke,a state-of-possessing-fire must occur3. Exemplification : as in a kitchen (Parallel Positive Exam-ple) and unlike in a lake (Parallel Negative Example).From what has been said above, it is clear that Vasubandhu'slogic operates from a different premise than Aristotle's. Thefocus of Indian logic in general is always on individuals, rather*Väda-vidhi 14 ff.**Väda-vidhi 5.***Väda-vidhi 4."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A Method For Argumentation   33than their \"classes\".* Even where \"classes\" are referred to,they must always be made up of existing known particulars.Vasubandhu describes the process of inference as a particularevent's being directly observed, and another invariably con-comitant event's being remembered.** Vasubandhu's logic, asis Indian logic after him, is thus rather \"intensional\" than \"exten-sional\", with an emphasis on the properties of individuals.3This focus explains the insistence on the exemplification, with-out which no inference-schema is held to be valid. It ensuresthat the property discussed in the thesis is non-empty and re-lates to actual particulars. The positive parallel example guaran-tees that there are yet other particulars which follow the sameinvariable concomitance pattern as does the event referred toby the \"topic\", and the negative parallel example makes surethat these are contrasted with others not following the sameinvariable concomitance pattern. The paksa, or topic of dis-cussion, must be either an existing particular, or a property ofan existing particular. \"Fire-possessing-ness\" refers to aproperty of a particular. Vasubandhu adopts these abstractnouns from the Nyäya-sütra, but for him they do not implythe existence of real universals, as they might to a Naiyäyika.4For Vasubandhu especially (even if not for all Indian logiciansfollowing him), logic must be based on particulars, and even,to follow his tentative theory***, particulars which are always-changing moment-events. But there will still be certain moment-events that exist only if others do, thus invariable concomitanceis still a possibility..Another original contribution of Vasubandhu's is the reduc-tion of spurious argument-types, of which no less than twenty-four are mentioned in the Nyäya-sütra****, to three basic flawsin arguments. These spurious arguments are all either \"re-versed\", \"incorrect\", or \"contradictory\". The Schemas calledby Vasubandhu \"reversed\" are those which rest on confusionsof the proper functions of the members of the schema, and always•Aristotle's logic, and Western logic after him, is primarily class-orient-ed; see the method in Prior Analytics I, II-III ff.**Väda-vidhi 10.•••see A Discussion for the Demonstration of Action 8, c.**+*Nyäya*3ütra V, 1, 1 and ff."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34   Seven Works of Vasubandhuinvolve the absence of a true invariable concomitance.* The\"incorrect\" or \"unreal\" are those where the event indicated inthe thesis itself is not observed, or is in conflict with what isdirectly observed. The \"contradictory\" is where events express-ed in the justification cannot co-exist with those adduced inthe thesis.**.Thus, several innovations in Indian logic previously ascribedto Dignäga are found in this treatise of his teacher Vasubandhu.These include the definition of \"logical pervasion\" as \"invariableconcomitance\", the insistence on the necessary inclusionof a statement of invariable concomitance in the inference-schema, the reduction of the earlier five-membered schema toone of three members, and the reduction of pseudo-justifica-tion-types. Vasubandhu's criteria for a valid inference-schemaare concise and precise, and there is nothing essential omitted.Dignäga's \"wheel of justifications' (hetu-cakra), sometimesheld to be the first complete Indian formulation of what con-stitutes the validity and invalidity of an argument5, is in factnothing of the kind : it is a pedagogic device mapping out indetail what Vasubandhu's criteria already presuppose.On first sight, the subject matter of A Met/tod for Argumenta-tion might seem remote to those not specifically interested inlogical forms. But Vasubandhu is possibly even in his logicalwork interested in the alleviation of suffering. Vasubandhutakes his examples of arguments to be rejected because of thelack of a true invariable concomitance primarily from the Mimä-rrisakas.*** This group of philosophers maintained that libera-tion can be reached only by strict observance of the Vedic rit-uals, and they asserted \"the eternality of sounds of speech\"because of their insistence that the Vedic mantras have eternalpower.6 But the beauty of Vasubandhu's criteria is that theycan see through all spurious reasoning, and of suffering-promot-ing spurious reasoning, the human life-streams of the twentiethcentury have certainly had their fill. To give only some exam-ples of current suffering-inducing spurious arguments whichcould be deftly destroyed by Vasubandhu's method, there arethe following :*Väda-vidhi 11, 13-18.**Väda-vidhi 11.***In this, he follows Gautama; see Nyäya-sütra V, 1, 1 ff."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A Method For Argumentation   35\"Nation So-and-So is prosperousbecause of its state-of-having-prosperous-rich-people(meaning : they have more different kinds of stuff)\".\"Nation So-and-So is happybecause of its state-of-having-many-types-of-industry-made-goods.\"Or, we may hear the potentate of a great empire say :\"The poor in this country cannot be helped by the Govern-mentbecause to do so would be monetarily inflationary\"and\"There must be more weapons of destruction produced atall costs, because if the Government cannot reach the poten-tial for destroying all vertebrate life-forms on this planetfifteen times over rather than fourteen, we are in danger.\"Following the criteria of A Method for Argumentation, thefirst argument is flawed on several grounds.

The thirdand fourth, if enunciated together, are grossly contradictory. Sologic is not irrelevant to the alleviation of suffering.In order to understand A Method for Argumentation properly,the equivalence of various terms used in regard to members ofthe inference-schema, and the reasons for there being suchvarious expressions, must be kept in mind. The pair\"demonstrandum/demonstrator\" is essentially the same as thepair \"demonstrandum/justification\". The term \"demonstrator\"emphasizes the purpose of the justification. The terms \"event\"(dharma) and \"event-associate\"(<$zßmw>2) refer to the justifica-tion and demonstrandum, too, or rather to the events whichthey discuss. The \"event\" is always the observed or known\"event\", the \"event-associate\" is that which can be related tothe \"event\" through invariable concomitance. In the inference-schema \"This mountain is fire-possessing, because it is smoke-possessing\", etc., the \"event\" is the directly perceived state-of-possessing-smoke, and the \"event-associate\" is the inferredstate-of-possessing-fire.^JWTiere the terms \"event\" and \"event-associate\" are contrasted in this treatise, the \"event\" alwaysrefers to the event expressed in the justification; the \"event-associate\" always to the inferred object expressed in the demon-strandum.Concerning the Text :A Method for Argumentation has not survived as an integraltext in any language, and the subsequent fame of Dignäga'slogical treatises has made it relatively unknown.

The \"connection\" is the in-variable concomitance of the demonstrandum and the demon-strator, that is, the non-arising of the demonstrator when thedemonstrandum does not exist. That through which the con-nection, i.e. invariable concomitance, of the two is specificallymentioned, is called \"the exemplification\". It must take theform of a specific parallel example, plus the statement of aninvariable concomitance. Thus, in the inference regardingsounds of speech, a specific parallel example would be \"likea pot\" (\"Sounds of speech are non-eternal, because of theirstate-of-arising-due-to-an-effort, like a pot\"), and the statementof the invariable concomitance would be \"Whatever has comeabout through an effort is not eternal.\"6, 7. Among pseudo-justifications, there are (1) those whichare not demonstrated, (2) those which are not sufficientlycertain, and (3) those which incur a self-contradiction. Amongthese, those which are not demonstrated are those where thecharacteristics stated in the exemplification do not exist. Forexample, if it is said, \"Sound is non-eternal, because it is perceiv«ed by the eye\", this is an argument which is not demonstrated;if it is said, \"It is eternal, because it is without a body\", this isan argument which is not sufficiently certain. An example ofone which incurs' self-contradiction for a Vaisesika is : \"It isnot eternal, 'because it is perceived through the senses\"; for aSänkhya : \"The effect is contained in the cause, because it comesto be (through the cause).\"28. There is a flaw in the exemplification if it exists with anundemonstrated object, for instance, if it is stated that \"Soundis eternal, because of its non-tangibility, like a cognition, not"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40   Seven Works of Vasubandhulike a pot.\" The object which is to be demonstrated, and thedemonstrator, is not demonstrated by stating the negative parallelexample \"like a pot\".9. A direct perception is a consciousness through the objectitself only. When a consciousness arises only on account ofthe object-of-sense after which it is designated, and not throughanything else, then this cognition is direct perception, forexample, cognitions of visibles, etc., or cognitions of pleasure,etc. With this definition, false cognitions are rejected, for exafriplethe cognition of mother-of-pearl as silver. For this cogni-tion is designated by \"silver\" as a \"silver-cognition\", but doesnot arise on account of silver, but rather is evoked throughmother-of-pearl. A conventional cognition is also rejected bythis definition. For such a cognition is designated as \"a cogni-tion of pots\" etc., but does not arise on account of pots which arereally existing, but rather only through juxtapositions of visi-bles, etc., which are interpreted as \"pots\",3 Pots themselvescan in no way give rise to this cognition, because of their con-ventionality, and their thus not being in a state-of-being-a-cause.Finally, cognition through inference is also rejected by this de-finition, because such a cognition occurs, for instance, throughthe cognition of smoke and the memory of its invariable con-comitance with fire, but not through the fire itself. That throughwhich exclusively the cognition arises, and does not exist unlessit arises, is regarded as an \"objecf'in this passage.410. Knowledge which arises when an invariably concomitantobject is observed, is inference. \"Invariable concomitance\"means that one object cannot arise unless the other one exists,as for example, fire and smoke. The non-observation of apossibility of one's arising without the other is inference, andit is through this invariable concomitance that something maybe inferred. Accordingly, the cognition of an object which maybe inferred is the result of an inference. By this definition,false cognitions are rejected. Knowledge through inferencecan be specified as an observation coming when the means-of-•evidence is directly observed, and the invariable concomitancebetween it and what can be inferred is remembered. One (theevent in the demonstrandum) does not occur unless somethingelse (the means-of-evidence) is directly known. Otherwise,there is no inference."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"A Method For Argumentation   4111. Flaws exist in a rejoinder when it is reversed, incorrect,or contradictory. A rejoinder is reversed when in the anteriorthesis5, the formulation of the argument is* separate from thecharacteristic of a true justification. An incorrect rejoinderis any that is false, i.e. when the object does not exist in themanner in which the thesis states that it does. A contradictoryrejoinder in one that cannot co-exist with its own thesis.12. Among these, the reversed etc., include spurious repliesbased on identity of the objects, complete unrelatedness of theobjects, various alternatives, non-differentiation, lack of ajustification, excess, reduction, direct apprehension (irrelevantto the inference), doubts, non-utterance, difference of effect,etc., (types of spurious replies as categorized by the Nyäya-sütrci)*.13. Among these, four** are reversed, because there is anuncertain similarity adduced in what is to be inferred througha justification which is certain. Just as the reversed is uncertainas regards that which should be certain, so the contradictoryis impossible because the objects in the argument cannot co-exist. It is possible to show that a rejoinder based on variousalternatives is really one which is incorrect, because somethingis stated to be uncertain through something that is really certainand true.14. (When one argues through unrelatedness where related-ness occurs, this is a case where, to follow the older categori-zation* * *, one is arguing from unrelatedness of objects.) Assum-ing that the thesis is as follows : \"Sound of speech is not eternal,because of its state-of-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort, likea pot\", the maker of such a spurious reply may say the follow-ing : \"Though in this case, the relatedness alleged by you exists,yet of these two, only a pot is fireable and perceptible by theeye, whereas sound is not. Therefore the pot is non-eternalbecause of its perceptibility by the eye, and its fireability,whereas the same is not the case with sounds of speech. On the*Nyäya-sütra V, 1, 1.••Spurious replies based on complete unrelatedness of objects, directapprehension irrelevent to the inference, non-utterance, and non-differen-tiation.***Nyäya-bhäsya, ad V, 1, 2."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42   Seven Works of Vasubandhuother hand, of these two only sound is eternal on account ofnon-perceptibility by the eye, etc., whereas the pot is not.\"Such a rejoinder is reversed. Eor fireability is of insufficientstrength to demonstrate non-eternality. One does not observea staterof-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort without non-eter-nality; thus the inference is demonstrated in the same way asthat relating to fire and smoke. Where fireability does notexist, as in the case of wind produced by a fan, etc., there stilldoes not exist an object without observable non-eternality.Therefore, this reply is reversed. Even with audibility, soundsof speech are observed where a state-of-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort is also observed to occur. Thus this inferencebased on non-audibility is absurd, as it is refuted by the powerof observation. It can be observed that a state-of-arising-im-mediately-upon-an-effort invariably exists with non-eternality,so through what pcpwer is the inference for sound's non-eternality refuted? It simply isn't. Therefore, this reply isreversed.The opponent is arguing with two-fold uncertainty. Thisfollows from our explanation of the occurrence of his justificationtogether with an unrelated topic, though he is arguing from arelatedness of the objects, or, secondly, from our indicationthat if a demonstrandum is refuted because of unrelatednessof objects, the justification adduced by us is without a refuta-tion. If one argues from a relatedness with fireability, whichis certain, towards an uncertainty, though it is true that therelatedness alleged occurs, yet there is no connection in theanterior thesis' rejoinder when it is stated that as without fire-ability, etc., non-eternality is not observed, it does not exist inthe case of sounds of speech. The statement proceeds from arelatedness of objects which does not exist. Because it - hasbeen indicated that the statement of the opponent for the eter-nality of sound because of its non-fireability, etc., is without ajustification, and thus without a true demonstrandum, thisreply is uncertain, as non-fireability is not concurrent with thedemonstrandum eternality, since even where fireability doesnot occur, eternality still does not necessarily exist.

A reply proceeding from excess and reduction** is reversed.For example, when a justification is brought up with its exempli-fication, and one says, for example, \"Sounds of speech arenot eternal, because they have arisen due to an effort\", andthe reply is given, for example, in this manner: \"If the justi-fication demonstrates that the demonstrandum is associatedwith a certain event, then it follows that it is not different fromthe demonstrandum, like the water of a stream which has en-tered the ocean. An association with an event is not possibleif the object associated with it is not obtained. But if the demon-strandum is obtained, what purpose can the justification possiblyhave? On the other hand, if it is not associated with the eventof the demonstrandum, then it is not different from those ob-jects which are not justifications, and thus is not a justificationitself.\"To this anterior thesis, it may be replied as follows : Theopponent is speaking of a cause-as-condition-for-a-cognition.But instead of recognizing this, he speaks of it as if it were amaterial cause, and attempts to refute the inference in this way.6He is thus making a vain assertion, because he is attempting toargue against something other than a cause-as-condition-for-a-cognition. Thus this reply is reversed.16. A justification through a direct apprehension (irrelevantto the inference) * * * in the opponent's demonstrandum, is a spu-rious reply based on direct apprehension. For instance, in the*Nyäya-sütra V, 1, 23; Nyäya-bhäsya ad V, 1, 23; Nyäya-kosa, p 95.Example : \"If sounds of speech are non-eternal because of their state-of-arising-due-to-an-effort, and this non-eternality of sounds of speech isargued through their similarity with non-eternal pots, etc., then, because oftheir inferability, all objects would be non-eternal.\" (Nyäya-kosa's examplefrom the Nilakanthi, 9, 44.)**Nyäya-bhäsya, ad V, 1, 4.***Nyäya-sütra V, 1, 27."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"44   Seven Works of Vasubandhucase already given, where the non-eternality of sounds of speechis inferred through their state-of-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort, the adversary may reply : \"This is no justification fornon-eternality, because in the case of a flash of lightning, etc.,non-eternality is demonstrated through other means-of-cognition,such as direct perception, etc., (and there is no state-of-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort involved). There is no justi-fication where one object exists even where the other (sup-posedly invariably concomitant one) doesn't.\" Others formulatethis in a different manner : \"There is no justification for non-eternality here, because there is no logical pervasion, just asin the case of the necessity of conscious activity for trees becauseof their sleeping at night, which occurs only for sirisa-trees\"1To this it may be replied as follows : In reply to the statementthat non-eternality is demonstrated through a state-of-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort itself only, the opponent is saying :\"There is no justification for non-eternality, and there is nological pervasion, either, so we are made happy.\" But thisreply is reversed. Because it is a vain assertion resting on theassumption that we are claiming that something is non-eternalonly because of a state-of-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort,whereas what we are claiming is that something is non-eternalbecause of a^ state-of-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort itselfonly. Thus this reply is reversed..... (discussion of reversal through doubt, where the means-of-evidence is itself doubtful)*17. When one assumes that since a justification does not existbefore its utterance, the demonstrandum also must not exist,this is a case of a reply based on non-utterance.** For example,the maker of such a spurious reply may say to this same argu-ment that sounds of speech are non-eternal because they arisedue to an effort : \"Since the justification does not exist priorto its apprehension and utterance, it follows that the demon-strandum also does not exist. Thus, since sounds of speechare said to be non-eternal because they have arisen due to an*cf.

Thusit must be eternal prior to the utterance of the justification.But once it is eternal, how can it become non-eternal?\"To this it may be replied as follows. : This reply is reversed.We adduce the justification as something which brings abouta cognition, but not as something which brings about a cessa-tion. This maker of a spurious reply is however attempting torefute us on the grounds that the justification itself is supposedto bring about a cessation. Thus this reply is reversed.18. When one attempts to show that the demonstrandum isnot demonstrated on account of a minimal difference in effect*,this is a reply based on difference of effect. When for examplethe thesis has been set tip as follows ; \"Sounds of speech arenon-eternal, because they are an effect, like a pot\", the adver-sary may reply as follows : \"The pot is non-eternal becauseof being an effect of a different sort, so how does this apply tosounds of speech?\"To this it may be replied as follows : We are claiming thatevery effect in general is non-eternal, so the difference fromthe state-of-effect of a pot is irrelevant. Thus this reply is re-versed.19. The incorrect includes spurious replies based on unwar-ranted overextension of principles** and on mere conjecture.***20. When it is said that sounds of speech are non-eternal be-cause of their state-of-possessing-a-cause-by-obvious-means-of-evidence, just like a pot, a maker of a spurious reply might say,\"What is your justification for stating that the pot itself is non-eternal?\"To this it may be replied as follows : Why is there no justi-fication simply because it has not been related to the demon-strandum, when the object in the parallel example can be directlyobserved to be concomitant with the je vent in the demon-strandum? For it can be directly observed by you yourselves,too, that the arising of a pot occurs with the means-of-evidenceof a cause. Thus this reply is unreal.*Nyäya~sütra9 Nyäya-bhä$yat V, 1, 37.**Ibid V, 1, 9-10.***Ibid V, 1,21."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46   Seven Works of Vasubandhu21. (Spurious replies based on conjecture* may be reducedto unreal replies, also.) For instance, when it is argued thatthe self does not exist, because it cannot be apprehended, justlike the son of a barren woman, the maker of such a spuriousreply may respond as follows : \"Then the self-evident suppositionis incurred, that everything which is directly perceived mustexist. But there are objects which though they are directly per-ceived do not exist, such as the circle which is seen when a torchis hurled in an arc.\"To this it may be replied : It is being assumed that there isexistence for everything that is directly perceived, which is avain assertion. (What is being argued here is that that whichis not directly perceived, and which cannot be inferred, doesnot exist.) Thus this reply is unreal.22. The contradictory includes spurious replies based on not-having-arisen, on eternality, etc.23. A reply made on the grounds of not-having-arisen** occurswhen one assumes that before its coming into existence, thejustification cannot have existed, and consequently the demons-trandum also cannot exist. For example, when it is beingargued that sounds of speech are non-eternal because they havearisen through an effort, the maker of such a spurious replymight say : \"If it is non-jeternal, because it has arisen due to aneffort, then prior to its arising it has not arisen due to an effort,and consequently it is eternal.\"To this it may be replied : Before its arising, the sound doesnot exist. And to maintain that it does not exist and is eternal,is a contradiction, because non-existence and eternality cannotco-exist. Thus this reply is contradictory.The same reply is also reversed on grounds of resting on aconjecture. For the adversary is saying : \"Since before thearising of the sound its state-of-arising-immediately-upon-än-effort does not exist, it follows that it has not arisen due to aneffort, and thus is eternal, because of its state-of-not-arising-immediately-upon-an-effort.\"To this it may be replied as follows : There is no certaintythat something is eternal because of its state-of-not-arising-*Nyäya-sütra, Nyäya-bhäsya V, 1, 21.**Ibid.

For there are three possibilitieshere : Some things are eternal, like space, etc. And somethings are non-eternal, such as flashes of lightning, etc. Andsome other things do not exist, like a sky-flower, etc. Thusthis reply is reversed.24. When one argues from an object's invariable associationwith non-eternality to eternality, then we have a spurious replybased on eternality. * In this case the adversary replies to theassertion that sounds of speech are non-eternal as follows :\"In that case, sounds of speech are eternal, because they areeternally connected with non-eternality, and its unchangingnature is thus eternal.\"To this it may be replied as follows : This is a contradiction.And why is this? Because something non-eternal is being|called \"eternal\". Thus this reply is contradictory.*Nyäya-sütra and Nyäya-bhäsya, V, 1, 32.NOTES1. Throughout this translation, \"object\" means \"an object of senseor understanding\".2. According to the Vaiseiskas, simple entities are eternal, though theymay be perceived by the senses. According to Sänkhya, effects pre-existin their causes, and they are not a new creation, but only an explicit mani-festation of that which is implicitly contained in the material cause. Sothe Sänkhya may assert the first half of the statement given, but not thesecond, since the effect strictly speaking does not come about because ofthe cause. Inconsistency with one's own unstated theses is not an extralogicalground for rejecting an argument in Vasubandhu's method.3. According to the provisional theory most beloved to Vasubandhu,what we normally perceive as entities are in no way really entities; so, forinstance, \"pots\" is a mere conventional expression for an interdependentcomplex with no unifying entity entering in.4. The object is that without which a cognition cannot arise. Thisdefinition does not say anything about the ontological status of the \"object\":it only says that without that which is designated as an \"object\", there isno cognition.5. \"Anterior thesis\" is the usual Indian scholastic term for an oppo-nent's thesis, since this is always presented first."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48   Seven Works of Vasubandhu6.

The method for describing \"per-sonality\" as aggregates of events of five different basic types-goes back to the Buddha himself.* According to this analysis,what is called an \"individual\" or \"personality\" is a complexarray of always-changing interdependent events.^ The analysis(and the meditation in which it is rooted) focuses on complexsuccessions of aggregates of particular momentary phenomena,and, while treating them genetically, refuses to comprise theminto hypothetical wholes. That is, an \"individual\" is reallyall of the changing states \"which make him up\", and there isno central entity underlying the organism. It is only the closeinterdependence of aggregations of moment-events which makesfor their relationship.The basic types of aggregates are : materialities, feelings,cognitions, motivating dispositions, and consciousnesses. Un-like the earlier Upanisadic view**, and the at least somewhatanterior Sänkhya and Jain theories***, the Buddha recognizesthe body as a basic part of \"individuality\", and physiologicaldifferences as \"personality\" differences. But unlike Westernphysiological psychology, which attempts to reduce all per-sonality factors to physiological causes, the Buddha sees otherfactors in \"personality\" which are not identical with physiologicalfunctions. Feelings are the mood-tones of the moment: thesemay have purely \"psychological\" causes apart from physiologicalones. \"Cognitions\" are the mental seizings of characteristics*cf. Majjhima I, 140-141, 145, 185, etc.**cf.

That views should be part of a \"per-sonality\" is also not surprising, since they can totally colorexperience. Consciousnesses, finally, are the complex of senseand mental awarenesses.Beginning about 380 B.C., Buddhist meditators/theorists beganisolating, listing, defining, and treating genetically all those basic;\"personality\" event-aggregate types talked about by the Buddha,in books now collected in the various Abhidharma-PHakas ofthe Canon.* This is a new very stark unadorned way of writ-ing, which admits only those elements which have meditationalprovisional existence. Only successions of particular moment-phenomena are admitted, and their causal connections withsucceeding moments are discussed. Since there are no hypo-thetical wholes, but only streams of constantly-changing inter-related moments, concepts such as \"self\", \"individual\", or\"personality\" have no validity. Neither do expressions suchas \"mind\", since what is so designated is a complex array ofalways changing moment-events.To give some idea of the methodology of early Abhidharmaworks, it may be useful to quote from the beginning of theDhammasangarii, first book of the Theraväda Abhidhamma(c. 380 B.C.). It begins as follows : \"Which events are beneficial?At the time when a beneficial consciousness-moment belongingto the realm of desires f arises, connected with satisfaction, joinedwith knowledge, with a visible as its object-of-consciousnQSS,a sound as its object-of-consciousness, a smell as its object-of-consciousness, a taste as its object-of-consciousness, a tactile•Two survive in their entirety : the Theraväda Abhidhamma, in Pali, whichhas been entirely translated into English, and the Sarvästiväda Abhidharma,now extant only in Chinese translation, from which translations of someportions only have been made into French.

Whatever at that time is a perceived agree-ableness arising from contact from a consciousness, an agree-able perceived pleasure, an agreeable pleasure arising fromcontact with consciousness, that at that time is called feeling.\"**Thus, each of these enumerated events, plus others which occurat the same time, arise in one moment along with a beneficialconsciousness.

LaterAbhidharma lists tend to be closed-ended, and to imply thatthe enumerated events, and those enumerated events only, haveexistence in a moment.

Thus Ghosaka defines\"feelings\" as follows in his Abhidharmämrta : \"What are feel-ings? They are experiences, arising from contact with anyof the six consciousnesses.\"*But throughout its long and varied development, Abhidharmais true to the spirit of the Dhammasangani in admitting onlyparticular moment-events. As such it is markedly differentfr^m Occidental theoretical psychology of the twentieth century,which always seems to deal with hypothetical wholes and cate-gories. Abhidharma is perhaps more akin to twentieth-centuryphysics.

To demonstrate to whatan extent this category-invention can go in Occidental psychology,two sentences from a standard text are given : \"A person witha high degree of cerebropenia might be expected to show delin-quent or manic-depressive tendencies, since he would lack thecontrol and inhibition that normally keep such tendencies incheck. The somatopenic individual, on the other hand, wouldbe susceptible to hebephrenia, because he lacked the drive andenergy necessary to carry on a normal life.\"* These twosentences bristle with hypothetical assumptions and categorieswhich the Dhammasangani would never admit to have any realexistence, i.e. existence as experienced moments, and also sug-gest that Occidental psychology is much interested in straight-jacketing \"individuals\" into set pre-conceived patterns. Froman Abhidharma point of view, they do not even indicate a verygreat familiarity with causal processes. For instance, is therereally a \"lack\" in an \"individual\" categorized as \"hebephrenic\",or are there not rather visions \"lacking\" in others? In India,an \"individual categorized hebephrenic\" by Occidental psycho-logical terminology, might be called a saint.Buddhist psychology, on the other hand, is most interestedin which psychological moments give rise to suffering, whichto the cessation of suffering, and which to neither. Moment-events giving rise to suffering are termed \"unbeneficial\" (aku-said), those giving rise to the cessation of suffering are called\"beneficial\"(/Twio/fl), and those which give rise to neither suffer-ing nor the cessation of suffering are called \"indeterminate\"(avyäkrta). In the quest for the alleviation of suffering, certainextraordinary mental states were recognized as beneficial;thus there is the enumeration of \"right meditational concentra-tion\" in the Dhammasangani passage quoted above. This aswell as \"the faculty for meditational concentration\" and \"one-pointedness of consciousness-moment\", is defined as follows :\"Whatever at that time is a stabilizing of consciousness-moment,a settling, a balance, an absence of distractedness, an*Leona E.

Thus Bud-dhist therapeutic techniques use only categories relating toexperienced moment-events, and antidotes are applied to thoseof them which are seen to be unbeneficial, through meditationalmethods by which previous ways of cognizing are suspendedor entirely discarded.

The secondcentury A.D. saw a great resurgence of Abhidharma writing :It is the time of the Vibhäfä*, and of writers such as the Bha-danta Vasumitra, his uncle Dharmaträta, Ghosaka, the Bha-4anta Dharmaträta, and Buddhadeva—all espousing quitedifferent theories on points left unclear by the old Abhidharmamanuals.

The invoca-tion to the Bodhisattva Manjusri, who with his sword of aware-ness cuts through all mental discriminations, affirms this—sodoes the therapeutic concern for \"antidotes\" that so often marksVasubandhu's Mahäyäna writing, so does the introduction ofthe Yogäcära store-consciousness.The particular Abhidharma scheme adopted and criticizedhere seems to be most kin to that of the Mahisäsakas.** TheMahisäsakas adopted a list of nine uncompounded events (asam-skrta-dharmd)* ** A Discussion of the Five Aggregates hasonly four, which is however more than most Abhidharmikaslist, and includes some of the Mahlsäsaka elements. The reasonfor adopting a Mahisäsaka-like framework for elucidation andcriticism comes from the fact that A Discussion of the Five Aggre-gates is a re-working of Asanga's Abhidharmasamuccaya.Asanga,having been originally trained by the Mahisäsakas,retains many features of their approach to Abhidharma.In Vasubandhu's work, the lists of the Abhidharmasamuccayaare subjected to close scrutiny. The entire list of \"motivatingdispositions disassociated from consciousness\" is called heremere designations for situations in the other aggregates. TheMahisäsaka-like list of \"uncompounded events\" is also reducedto events explainable through the other aggregates. Vasubandhuhad already in his Kosa-bhäsya subjected Vaibhäsika Abhi-dharma to sharp attack, in which many Vaibhäsika \"entities\"were discarded. He is doing a similar thing here with Mahi-säsaka categories. He also reduces the somewhat prolix defini-tions of Asanga, by looking at the fundamental feature of themoment-event-type, and by never wasting a word.In this translation, some terms have been translated differentlythan is usual. One of these is \"rüpa\". It is used both fof thefirst aggregate and for the object of the first consciousness. Asthe object of the first consciousness, \"rw/?a\" is defined as a\"visible\". But when treated as an aggregate the definitions focus-on its dimensionality in a special locus, and its physical•or, more exactly, \"categoriaclastic\".**cf.

Infact, according to the Yamaha, an early book of the TheravädaAbhidhamma, the rwpa-aggregate and the rüpa seen as \"attrac-tive\", etc., are mutually exclusive.*** Presumably this is saidbecause the primary characteristics of the rw/?ö-aggregate areperceived by a tactile consciousness. Good translations of \"rüpa\"as an aggregate are \"matter\", \"materiality\", \"material forms\",whereas as an object of the first consciousness, it must be ren-dered simply as \"visible\". The Chinese often translate \"rüpa\"as the object of the visual consciousness by \"color\", but inthe Vaibhäsika system at least, color is only one aspect of thevisible. The reason for the somewhat clumsy \"materiality\"adopted here for \"rüpa\" as an aggregate, rests on a wish toavoid a radical mind/matter duality. There are in Abhidharmaterminology compounds such as \"näma-rüpa\", which seem todivide the \"individual\" into material and non-material aggre-gates, but, similarly, there is the category \"käyaka\", \"bodily\",which includes all the aggregates except consciousness, f Theresearches of Maryla Falk have revealed that the aggregatessubsumed under \"näma\" also have spatial existence.

Citta is in fact the basic con-sciousness-moment. In order to demonstrate the inadequacyof the translation \"thought\", it may be useful to turn to thediscussion of \"citta\" by two of the foremost second-centuryAbhidharmikas, the Bhadanta Vasumitra and Ghosaka.According to. the Bhadanta Vasumitra, the meditational ex-perience of states where there are neither cognitions nor feelingscan be reduced to cittas* But according to Ghosaka, this isimpossible, as citta always involves certain concomitant events,two of which are invariably cognitions and feelings.** Beingthus according to Ghosaka always imbued with at least a basicintellective and emotive side, and according to the BhadantaVasumitra separable from both, \"citta\" is not rendered verywell by \"thought\" in either case. What the Westerner is mostapt to designate by that term are really streams of those momentssubsumed in this treatise under the general heading \"initialmental application\" and \"subsequent discursive thought\".Both of these types of mental activity are eliminated fairly earlyin meditation, and in fact the second meditational concentra-tion is already free of both of them.*** When meditationmanuals speak of \"watching the flow of cittas\", they meansomething much more fundamental than witnessing an internaldiscursiveness : they are talking about unattached observationof consciousness-moments of whatever sort that may arise.Similarly, when Padmasambhava speaks of \"Eka-Citta\"f,it is One Moment of Consciousness that includes them all, andrenderings like \"One Thought\" or \"One Mind\" may be quitemisleading.Another term which has been' left untranslated is \"manas\".It is employed for any consciousness which serves as a directcondition for a consciousness of the sixth, or \"mental\", variety.As such, it can be used for any occurrence of any of the six varie-ties of consciousness-moments which help give rise to an*cf.

Similarly, a \"latentimpression\" is a constantly changing series of moment-eventswhich will gradually, if conditions allow, give rise to a memory,or a \"reverberation\" in the consciousness-series. In some ways,however, the metaphor is not so good, inasmuch as that seriesof moment-events called \"a plant seed\" only goes through theentire sequence once, whereas that series of moment-eventscalled \"a latent impression\" may give rise to repeated trans-formations in the consciousness-series. The relationship be-tween consciousness-moments and \"seeds\" is symmetrical, sinceeach consciousness-moment leaves an impression in the con-sciousness-series, and this \"seed\"-series colors all future con-sciousnesses.

The domains of the six conscious-nesses are awarenesses with objects-of-consciousness in visibles,etc., and which are dependent on the eye, etc. The domain ofmanas is any of these consciousness-moments which are pastimmediately afterwards, because of the continuity of the sixthconsciousness.31 In this way, the sensory domains have beendetermined as eighteen.Ten of those sense-fields and domains ^the sensory organsand their objects) and that, part of the sense-field of mentallycognizables which may be subsumed under it (unmanifest ac-tion) constitute whatever is the aggregate of materiality.

(Abhidharmakosavyäkhyä,ad 133).1. On the Bodhisattva ManjusrI \"who has become a prince\", see Intro-duction to this text, p 58.2. The great elements.The great material elements accepted by the Vibhäsä are earth, water,fire and wind. It has been held (cf. Jaini, Abhidharma-dipa, Introduction,p 90) that the theory of these elements may have been inspired by the Vai-sesikas, who enumerate earth, water, fire, wind, space, time, place, souland manas as dravyas (Kanada, Vaisesika-sütra I, I, 5). But their adop-tion in Buddhism may actually antedate Kanada, as it is in evidence in theDhamniasangani (648). It is possible that both Buddhist Abhidharmaand Vaisesika may derive their elements via the Upanisads (cf. Prasna-Upa-nisad IV, 8) from the cosmogenic categories of the Brähmanas. The Sata-patha-Brahmana, XI, I, 6, 16-24, states that water, breath (wind), speech,and fire were created at the first full-moon and new-moon rites performedby Prajäpati and Paramesthin; at the second rite, the sky (space), earthand water were created.Already in the Prakaranapäda of Vasumitra (Chinese translations Taisho1541 and 1542), a text held in canonical esteem by the Vibhäsä^ -these ele-ments are not the common things usually designated by the names \"earth'*,etc., but rather represent more abstract principles to be found in materiality.Earth is the solid principle that holds things in place, water the wet prin-ciple which has cohesion as its special quality, fire the hot principle thatcooks and transforms, and wind the mobile principle that expands and dis-places {Prakaranapäda 13 a, quoted La Vallee Poussin, Kosa I, p 22).

A detailed discussion of the Vaibhäsika concept of \"unmanifest ac-tion\" occurs in A Discussion for the Demonstration of Action, 14 and in note 3.4. A discussion of these divisions of the visible (all of which except colorare rejected by Vasubandhu) is given in A Discussion for the Demonstrationof Action, 1-5. On \"configuration\", see note 5 to that text.5. Though an \"unmanifest action\" is a residual force which has as itslocus the material elements of the body, it does not share the usual charac-teristics of materiality, since it is not directly perceptible, and exercises noresistance. This latter phrase means that the locus of one materiality cannot be occupied by another, so that if two instances of materiality collide,one will displace the other.6. A cognition is a particularization of perception, and may accompanyany type of consciousness-moment. Certain \"signs\" or salient featuresare taken hold of : thus there may be \"the cognition of the smell of a jas-mine flower\", \"the cognition of the taste of rice\", or \"the cognition thateverything is impermanent\" accompanying instances of smell-conscious-ness, taste-consciousness, and mental consciousness, respectively.7. On cittas, see introduction to this text, p 59-60.8. \"One-pointedness\" is a metaphor for complete concentration. Anyränge of events may serve as a focus for meditational concentration. Seeintroduction, p 63. A totally formless meditation is still \"one-pointednessof citta towards an examined range of events\", since formless experiencesare still included in a definite range of events.9. This is a Buddhistic definition of \"faith\", which focuses on thosefew \"articles of faith\" accepted by Buddhism : that actions all have retri-butory effects for their \"performers\", that there is a beneficial course ofaction which is not conducive to the arising of suffering, and that the \"Gems\"(the Buddha, the Dharma and the Buddhist community) are worthy ofrespect because they indicate beneficial courses of action.10. On manas, see introduction, pp 60-61. This definition of \"greed\"suggests that greed (or attachment, which is seen to be the same) can ariseonly in regard to mentally constructed events.11. \"The appropriating aggregates\" are those collections of aggregatesthat constitute a definite life-stream : they \"appropriate\" their interrela-tionship.12. The three realms of experience are \"the realm of desires\", \"the realmof simple images\" and \"the imageless realm\". Any state where all thesense-consciousnesses are operative, and where all passions and aversionshave their full opportunity to develop, is subsumed under \"the realm of de-sires\". Thus, all non-meditationally concentrated states are included there.\"The realm of simple images\" comprises the four first meditational stages,where certain senses, such as smell and taste, are not operative. \"The image-less realm\" comprises any state where all senses except the mental conscious-ness are suspended. It is \"imageless\", then, in the sense that the first fiveconsciousnesses no longer perceive their objects. These states are the ex-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"A Discussion of the Five Aggregates   77treme meditational concentrations, the four \"imageless attainments\", whichculminate in the attainment of the cessation of all cognitions and feelings.The conception of these \"realms\" in Buddhism shows an amalgamationof cosmological needs with the result of meditational experimentation.In the earliest Buddhist conception, there were apparently only two \"realms\":a \"realm of images\" and an \"imageless realm\", (cf. Sutta-nipäta 755-756, Itivuttaka 51, 73.) Przyluski noted that the contrast between the'realm of desires\" and the \"realm of images\" was added later (\"Bouddhismeet Upanishad\", Bulletin de VEcole Frangaise de VExtreme Orient, 1932).-Falk supplies an explanation for this when she says that the assumptionof a three-\"realm\" division was made necessary by increasing experimenta-tion with the imageless attainments (Nämarüpa, p 98). Originally, thesemeditations were not very important in Buddhism, though they were prac-tised and held central by several religious orders, including that of Udraka,the second religious teacher of the Buddha. In Digha III, 131, ff, it is statedthat the four simpler meditations are all that are needed to attain the fruitsof sainthood, and it is also significant that directly before his death, theBuddha went into those meditational concentrations only (Digha II, 156)»Increasing experimentation with the sense-suspending attainments madeit necessary to distinguish \"realm-wise\" between them and the simpler medi-tational stages.13. It is primarily doubt as regards the clearly perceived, false views,adherence to any particular view, and adherence to mere rule and ritual,that gives rise to mental constructions—those focuses of mental conscious-ness that have no reality outside of the constructions of that consciousness.Other particular views which have an unbeneficial effect rest on those fourtypes of confusion.14. \"Initial mental application\" and \"subsequent discursive thought\"are two kinds of flows of discrimination—in fact the first of them is to Vasu-bandhu svabhäva-vikalpa, \"basic discrimination\"\", the kind that makes allother kinds possible. Both of these are regarded as existing together withinthe sensory consciousnesses by the Vibhäsä, and by orthodox Vaibhäsikassuch as Sanghabhadra and the Dipakära. But in the face of Vasubandhu'sattacks, which state that these two are not genetically different, but onlydifferent stages in the same \"series\", and thus can't be situated togetherwithin one moment of consciousness, both Sanghabhadra and the Dipakäraare forced to admit that the second of these can be present in the first fivetypes of consciousness only \"in an unmanifest state\", cf. Abhidharmadipaad II, 123, p 83; Yasomitra's citation of Sanghabhadra's Abhidharmanyä-yänusära, ad II 33, Law ed II, p 57. (See also Jaini's discussion, Abhi-dharmadipa, introduction, pp 83-88.) To Vasubandhu, \"initial mental appli-cation\" is not really a separate event, but represents a certain kind of voli-tion and constructing discernment existing, as he says, even in sensory con-sciousnesses, as long as these are not meditationally concentrated, (cf. Ya-somitra's discussion, Vyäkhyä, ad I 33, Law I, p 74) whereas according^ toolder definitions, such as the Vibhäsä's and Asanga's, it and discursivethought rest on volition and discernment, rather than being strictly identifiable"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78   Seven Works of Vasubandhuwith them (Abhidharmasamuccaya, p 10; Yasomitra Vyäkhyä, ad II 33, LawII, p 57). Following Vasubandhu initial mental application is volitionor discernment inasmuch as it does or does not involve deduction (cf. Ya-somitra, ad I 33, Law I, p 74 : \"Anabhyühävasthäyäm cetanä abhyühä-vasthäyäm prajneti vyavasthäpyate)\". The discussion of Schmidthausenin his article \"Sauträntika-Voraussetzungen in Virrisatikä und Triifisikä\"which attempts to uphold some kind of a fundamental distinction betweensensory and non-sensory consciousnesses in Vasubandhu's psychology, isconfused to some extent by a misquotation from Yasomitra in Jaini's edi-tion of the Abhidharmadipa. Initial mental application is certainly not forVasubandhu \"only an impulse\", as Schmidthausen claims. Jaini's quota-tion from Yasomitra is \"Cetanävisesa eva vitarka iti\" (p 19, n 4), \"He saysthat initial mental application is only a certain kind of volition\", but thetext clearly reads \"Cetanä/?ra/7?dvisesa\", *'a certain kind of volition or dis-cernment\" (Yasomitra, ad I 33, Law I, p 74). Vasubandhu does not placetoo much emphasis on the distinctness aspects of these mental streams, ashe considers such descriptions quite relative (cf. Kosa II, ad 33a-b, LaVallee Poussin, pp 173-174). Sthiramati explains that the \"indistinctness\"of initial mental application when compared to subsequent discursivethought consists in the fact that initial mental application considers only theobject of sense or understanding, without further connections being made.These are made by subsequent discursive thought. (Trimsikavijnaptibhäsya,p 32). (See also Dhammasangarii 7-8, and Carolyn Rhys-Davids' com-ments on Buddhaghosa's Atthasälini 114, 115, where \"initial mental appli-cation\" is described as \"a distinctively mental procedure at the inceptionof a train of thought, a deliberate movement of voluntary attention\" and\"subsequent discursive thought\" as \"the movement and maintenance of avoluntary thought-continuum, as distinguished from the initial grapplingwith the subject of reflection.\", Dhammasangani translation, p 10, note 1;p 11, note 2.) .It is interesting that Vasubandhu will characterize these mental flowswhich make for discriminations as being potentially afflictions. Theseflows tend to result in holding fast to views, etc., and thus give rise to afflic-tions. They are both eliminated fairly early in meditational concentrationstreams.15. Vasubandhu is here eliminating the entire category of \"motivatingdispositions disassociated from citta\", and proceeds to explain how eachof these \"moment-events\" thus categorized really represents a particularcondition in materialities, cittas, and events associated with cittas.16. \"Attained\" is here being used in its most bland scientific sense, tomean \"becoming intimately associated for a time\".17. See Introduction, pp 61-62. Here, what the Vaibhäsika and Mahi-säsaka accept as a special entity präpti is equated to residues in conscious-ness, effected by latent impressions.18. When one says, conventionally, that \"X has Y\", the Mahisäsakaand Vaibhäsika explain this as moment-event A subsumed in \"series X\"connected by a präpti to moment-event B subsumed in \"series Y\". A prä-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"A Discussion of the Five Aggregates   79pti is recognized by them as a special kind of entity that links diverse butrelated elements. As such it plays a role not unlike the inherence-cate-gory (samaväya-padärthd) of the Vaisesikas, except that the latter, at leastin the earlier theory, is single, whereas there is a präpti for each connect-ing relationship between two events. Vasubandhu regards the conceptof präpti as bogus. What is thus designated may be a \"seed\", as whenone says \"X has such and such a view\". This means that, within the aggre-gate-series designated as \"X\", there are consciousness-moments accompa-nied by latent impressions from past moments (\"seeds\"), making for a view.It may be a capacity, as when one says, \"X has great bodily strength.\" Thismeans that, within the aggregate-series designated as \"X\", there is the capa-city for doing heavy bodily actions. It may be an \"approachment\", a grow-ing physical proximity of two events, as when one says \"X is eating food\".It may be simply an \"adjustment according to circumstances\", as when onesays, \"X has a feeling of pain\" (explained by the Mahisäsakas and Vaibhä-sikas as a consciousness-series designated \"X\" linked to an aggregate ofsuffering-feeling by a präpti). According to Vasubandhu, this is simplyan alteration from one citta to the next because of a circumstance of painin the feeling-aggregate interrelated to the consciousness-aggregate.19. The attainment of^the cessation of feelings and cognitions, last ofthe \"imageless meditations\", is reached only after the consciousness-serteshas passed through the other four imageless attainments, which are alsodesignated as \"the summits of existence\". These latter are the meditationalattainments focused on infinite space, on infinite consciousness, on nothingwhatever, and the state which is neither cognitional nor non-cognitional.For the attainment of cessation of feelings and cognitions to be reached,even those events present in the stage which is neither cognitional nor non-eognitional must no longer be present. Vasubandhu says that the attain-ment of cessation of feelings and cognitions must be separate from thesubtle attachments present even in the stage of nothing whatever, but actu-ally he \"should\" say in addition that this attainment is separate even fromthe dim cognitions of the stage which is neither cognitional nor non-cogni-tional, as well.20. The factor here translated as \"taking part in an organism\" hasusually been rendered \"generic similarity\". This however is clearly notwhat is involved, as can be seen from Vasubandhu's definition.21. A word may indicate the \"own-being\" or \"nature\" of a moment-event, e.g. \"blue\", but a complete, meaning dealing with particulars of eventscan only be expressed by a phrase.22. Syllables themselves are not the conveyors of meaning, otherwiseeach synonym would consist of the same syllables.23. \"Cittas\" are so called because of their variety (citratva), and all in-stances of \"manas\" are so called becasue of providing a mental basis (manä-ysrayd). The first of these etymological explanations is used by Vasubandhuagain in A Discussion for the Demonstration of Action, 31, and in The Teach-ing of the Three Own-Beings, 7.24. This is the second etymological explanation of \"citta\", by the root"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80   Seven Works of Vasubandhuci, cinotf, \"to accumulate\". This again occurs in KSP 31 and TSN 7. Thesix consciousnesses are variegated, thus fit with the first etymology; the store-consciousness accumulates \"seeds\", thus fits with the second.25. According to Mahisäsaka and Vaibhäsika theory, each conscious-ness must have an object-of-consciousness and also an aspect, that is, somespecial characteristic by which it can be recognized. Since the store-con-sciousness underlies the six discerning consciousnesses which have definiteobjects-of-consciousness and aspects, it cannot be discerned by any of them.Thus its object-of-consciousness and aspect must be undiscerned. It isknown only by inference, asSumatisila says in Karmasiddhitikä, ad 36. Thoughthis may be an embarrassing admission to make in the face of Vaibhä-sika charges that a consciousness should be directly experienced, it at leasthas the value of consistency. Vasubandhu's admission that the object-of-consciousness and aspect of the store-consciousness are undiscernedis better than the approach of Occidental \"depth-psychologists\", who posita \"subconscious\" and then try to fix its contents, which is tantamount tosaying that the \"subconscious\" can be consciously discerned.26. Here, Vasubandhu has compactly given the inferential justificationsfor assuming a store-consciousness within his definition of it. The medi-tational attainment of the cessation of cognitions and feelings must itselfbe accompanied by consciousness-moments, otherwise the consciousness-series could never resume once the attainment ceases. This is one of themain arguments for the existence of the store-consciousness in A Discus-sion for the Demonstration of Action. A consciousness-series changes per-manently after it has been impressed by an object-of-consciousness : againthis is impossible without some substratum. Entry into Samsära, i.e. con-sciousness' becoming linked with an organism, is again impossible withoutsome consciousness preceding temporally the six discerning consciousnesses,as these do not yet exist at the inception of an embryo's existence. Trans-migration in Samsära, or, more properly, the residue of the aggregate-com-plex from one life to the next, is again impossible unless there is a substra-tum where the residue exists. Some of these arguments were already usedby Asanga. (The argument of a consciousness' being necessary in the attain-ment of the cessation of feelings and cognitions is raised by Asanga in Mahä-yänasangraha, I, 31., the change in aspects in consciousness implying asubstratum in I, 32., no possibility of the carry-over of impressions fromone moment to the next without an underlying consciousness, in I, 33-34.,and the impossibility of there being a residue of one consciousness-complexfrom one moment to the next without a store-consciousness in I, 38.)27. The aggregates are first of all so designated because they are notsimple moment-events, but are moment-events \"heaped together\". Forinstance, \"materiality\", though one kind of aggregate, consists in one mo-ment \"in one organism\" of a huge number of moment-events, in fact all theevents which twentieth century physiological chemistry is attempting todefine. Furthermore, they are not only \"aggregated\" in one moment,but the events in one aggregation-moment help give rise to the next. Time,a real category to ancient and modern Vaisesikas, is recognized already inthe Vibhäsä as being only a name for the flow of compounded events (see"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"A Discussion of the Five Aggregates   81Vibhäsä selections translated by La Vallee Poussin, Melanges 1936-37, p. 8).Thus \"time\" exists only because moment-events are followed by subsequentmoment-events. A \"series\", similarly, is only a metaphor for the phenomenonof one aggregate-moment's arising when the other has ceased, and being causallylinked to the previous one. An \"aspect\", defined as a distinguishing characteris-tic for a moment-event, is really not anything of the sort, either, since \"it\" isabstracted from the many events arising in one moment. A \"development\",again, does not really occur, since there is not anything which can undergochange : rather each moment is distinct from the previous one. It is con-ventionally said that \"A visible is a sense-object of an eye\", but this state-ment comes only from the visual consciousness-aggregate arising in a com-pounded and cognitional form.28. \"Space\", recognized as a definite kind of entity in Vaisesika philo-sophy, is also accepted by many Abhidharmika systems, including that ofthe Mahlsäsakas (Bareau, Mahisäsaka thesis no. 19, Les sectes, p. 185),If it is accepted, it must clearly be uncompounded, i.e. not consisting ofconditioned moment-events. Vasubandhu however denies that space isan entity at all. He says that it is simply an interval between materialities,and is thus an absence of impinging materiality.29. \"Cessation not through contemplation\" is the Abhidharmika termfor a cessation of the psychophysical complex which has not come aboutthrough the specifically Buddhist contemplations of the truth of suffering,the truth of the arising of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering,and the truth of a path leading to the cessation of suffering. Passages whichin detail discuss \"cessation not through contemplation\" indicate that anycessation of \"an aggregate-series\" can be designated in this way, as longas the cessation has not come from a contemplation of the Four Noble Tru-ths, nor by the inherent destruction of each moment-event. (This lattertype of cessation, which refers to moment-events rather than to \"series\",is called by the Vibhäsä \"cessation due to non-eternality\" (Vibhäsä, 31,translated by La Vallee Poussin, BEFEO XXX, p. 1 ff). Thus, a non-Buddhistyogi who through^ meditations is able to annihilate factors of suffering, hasachieved this through \"a cessation not through contemplation\", becausethe knowledge of the Noble Truths was not involved. A series of blue vis-ual consciousnesses ceases when the stimulus giving rise to blue visual con-sciousnesses ceases: this would also be, and far more obviously so, \"a ces-sation not through contemplation\". The nature of this cessation washowever the subject of much dispute among Abhidharmikas (cf. Vibhäsä31,32, translated by La Vallee Poussin, BEFEO XXX, pp. 1-28; Vasubandhu,Kosa I, ad 5-6; Sanghabhadra, Nyäyänusära, I, 32, translated by La ValleePoussin, BEFEO XXX, pp 259-60, cf. pp 263-298). \"Cessation throughcontemplation\" is essentially an Abhidharmika synonym for \"Nirvana\"(Vibhäsä 31, synonym no. 1, La Vallee Poussin, p. 10).It is interesting that Vasubandhu here reduces the cause of \"cessationthrough contemplation\" from a realization of the Four Noble Truths toantidotes to afflictions. Presumably, for him, a non-Buddhist not recog-nizing the Four Noble Truths could still give rise to cessation through con*templation, if antidotes to afflictions were applied."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"82   Seven Works of Vasubandhu30. In other words, the only inherent nature in all events is that they ,have none! Suchness is the equivalent of Emptiness, by which all eventshave no graspable nature. Vasubandhu has thus eliminated the entireMahisäsaka list of uncompounded events, for all of them, by his defini-tions, are mere absences.31. The sixth consciousness, or mental consciousness, includes in its\"domain\" residues of consciousnesses of all six varieties. For example,an audial consciousness may arise in one moment, the mental conscious-ness \"That note was flat\", referring to the previous audial consciousness,may arise in the next moment. The domain of manas, i.e. any of the con-sciousnesses preceding a sixth-consciousness-moment, is itself \"past immedia-tely afterwards\", i.e. it is momentary. But a reflection on this manas bya succeeding sixth-consciousness-moment, is possible. Thus, a kind ofcontinuity in succeeding sixth-consciousness-moments is possible, becauseprevious consciousness-moments of all six varieties affect succeeding sixth-consciousness-moments. In the example above, the sound itself is an au-dial consciousness, and lasts for a moment. The mental-consciousness-moment \"That note was flat\", which depended on the previous second-consciousness-moment can itself give rise to a \"series\" of new sixth-con-sciousness-moments, such as \"The singer might have teen under some strainat that moment\", \"This composition requires great skill in executing musi-cal ornaments,\" etc., etc., all of which are continuous upon one anotherand derive in part from the audial consciousness-moment which has longpassed.32. There are only the efficacies of these particular domains, withoutthere being any central \"doer\". This is of course a necessary recognitionin realizing \"the selflessness of personalities\".33. This should seem obvious, but the implications of this statementmay not be. Thus, wherever visual \"models\" are made in regard to thatwhich isn't visible, what is being made is a distortion. It is as futile as at-tempting to explain the visible in terms of smell.34. See A Discussion for the Demonstration of Action, note 43. Theterm \"connected with distress\" (säsravä) has been rendered by \"liable tobe connected with afflictions\", which is what the prior term really means.35. The mental-consciousness-aggregates have the possibility of recog-nizing the arising of afflictions; for instance, when they are meditationallyconcentrated in certain ways. Thus they may be either liable to be con-nected with afflictions, or not.35a. The sensory domain of visibles can be beneficial or unbeneficial onlybecause of manifest action (yijnapti-karma), which is assumed to be part ofthe sense-field of visibles. (See, in this book, A Discussion for the Demon-stration of Action, 1-4). The sensory domain of sounds is beneficial orunbeneficial only if it is verbal action.36. \"Unappropriated\" from the point of view of a particular aggregate\"series\", see note 11.37.

It is in facta frontal assault on Vaibhäsika theories, and answers many ofthe objections-that Vaibhäsika masters had raised towardsearlier formulations by Vasubandhu.It is not a \"Hinayäna\"** treatise. It uses the store-con-sciousness to account for psychic continuity, quotes the Mahä-yäna Sandhinirmocanasütra as authoritative scripture, andends very Mahäyänistically with the transference of all meritgained to all sentient beings. But it is directed at \"Hinayänists\",and, by filling up holes in earlier theories, is attempting to lureVaibhäsikas to become involved with the further implicationsof Yogäcära theory, which are not alluded to here deliberately\"to ease the shock\".\"Action\" is \"karma\", that kind of activity which has an ethi-cal charge, and which must give rise to a retributionary \"rever-beration\" at a later time. If suffering is inflicted, the inflictingaggregate-complex \"series\" will feel future suffering as a retri-bution for it. But the \"time interval\" between the two eventsis a problem for a theory maintaining momentariness. Thistreatise thus becomes absorbed in the problem of psychophysi-cal continuity.In what is probably Vasubandhu's earliest theory, in KosaIX, memory is explained by a sensory or mental impressionremaining latent in the consciousness-\"series\" and subsequently,when the proper conditions are present, emerging to a conscious* Sumatislla, Karmasiddhitikä, Peking/Tokyo ed.

As we have seen, these latent impressions are often giventhe metaphoric designation \"seed\". Thus, volitions of bene-ficial and unbeneficial actions leave such \"seeds\" within \"theseries\", which ripen as retribution. In the case of the experienceof the attainment of the cessation of feelings and cognitions,this explanation runs into difficulties. For in this state all thenormal functions of consciousness are suspended, and yet,after some time, \"the practitioner\" emerges from the medita-tional concentration with memories and retributions that con-tinue exactly where the last moment of full consciousness leftoff. During the time of attainment, where can these \"seeds\"exist ? The theory as stated is inadequate to account for this.The Vaibhäsikas had evolved a solution to this problem.Following the time-theory of the Bhadanta Vasumitra* theycould say that the experience of the attainment of cessationof feelings and cognitions and re-emergence from it could beexplained by the last moment of the consciousness-\"series\"losing its full efficacy, that is, becoming past, and the next futuremoment of the \"series\" becoming fully activated, that is, pre-sent, after a lapse has removed the obstacles to such a develop-ment.Vasubandhu, in Kosa II, ad 44 ff, admits that the Vaibhäsikascan solve the problem of psychic continuity in this way. Butthe entire edifice of purely hypothetical entities which is beingused by the Vaibhäsikas goes completely against his grain. Tospeak of the existence of the past and future is nonsense to him,since the past is that which no longer exists and the future isthat which does not exist yet. At Kosa V, ad 27, and againin this treatise, 16-17, Vasubandhu subjects the Vaibhäsikatheory to a series of sharp attacks. It cannot account for dis-tortion in memories or for disappointments in anticipations.If an existent past entity accounted for every instance of memory,it is difficult to see why memory should become distorted, orwhy \"one\" shouldn't \"have\" all memories of all past eventsat any given moment. The disappointment in anticipationsmakes for an even more potent argument, since events may beanticipated which never become existent as present entities.•See page 12"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  87Orthodox Vaibhäsika masters were not lacking in repliesto these objections. The DIpakära, for instance, defends theexistence of the past and future by stating that it is mentionedin the sütras, that there could be no production of a retribu-tional effect without an abiding past deed, and that each con-sciousness-moment must have an existent object.* A causalrelation is possible, he says in reply to Vasubandhu's distinctionbetween conditions-as-objects-of-consciousness (which need notexist outside of consciousness) and truly generative conditions(which must have real existence outside of the particular con-sciousness-moment), only between two existing entities.** Sono event of purely designatory reality can exist without somereference to an ultimately real event.

According to Vasu-bandhu, in a karmic \"series\", a beneficial action is followedby a series of cittas of which the last (which can itself be unbene-ficial) is supposed to have the force projected by the long pastact to produce an agreeable sensation. The seed metaphorused by Vasubandhu for this process is inadequate, says San-ghabhadra, since in the case of the series flower-fruit, there isalways a constant relationship between the seed and the finalfruit, that is, a certain seed always eventually gives rise to a fruitof the same nature.* On the other hand, each action musthave an effect distinct from cittas following as a result of cittas,otherwise, the sudden arising of an unbeneficial citta after abeneficial one could never exist.Vasubandhu in this treatise addresses himself to the insis-tence of Sanghabhadra and the Dipakära, that an objectivelyreal event must be posited for each object-of-conscionsness.He says that it is really present causes and anticipations thatallow us to think of something in the future, and present effectsand memories which allow us to think of the past.

Several alter-native theories are considered : The first of these says thatthe citta emerging from the attainment of cessation need notrest on the citta preceding that attainment, but can arise fromthe re-awakened body supplied with sense-organs. This is acoherent and parsimonious theory, and it does not appear thatit has been full justice by either Vasubandhu or Sumatisila.Then there is the theory of the Bhadanta Vasumitra, that theattainment of the cessation of feelings and cognitions mustitself be citta. But Ghosaka would object that citta withoutconcomitant feelings and cognitions simply does not exist.Ghosaka himself proposes that the attainment of cessation it-self constitutes an efficacious entity, which can be seen by thefact that it keeps the consciousness-series from renewing itselffor some time. But Vasubandhu can attack Ghosaka's thesisby demonstrating that it is obviously not the attainment ofcessation which has this function, but the consciousness-momentdirectly antecedent to attaining the meditation. The attain-ment of cessation is to Vasubandhu no more than the absenceof full functioning consciousnesses.The solution of this treatise is to introduce the concept ofstore-consciousness. In the attainment of cessation, the sixconsciousnesses are arrested by a powerful volition associatedwith the last conscious moment previous to this state, and allpsychic processes remain latently \"within the store-conscious-ness\", which continues to function in a steady stream duringthe entire time of immersement in the meditation. Continuityis maintained because each moment-seed influences the next.Sanghabhadra's objections are met because the citta-series isno longer one-tiered, but rather involves now a separate seriesunderlying the six consciousnesses. The retribution of a pastact may be explained by the volition of that act influencing thestore-consciousness, and after the maturation of the seed there,its penetrating to a fully conscious level in the form of a pleasur-able or unpleasurable result.

With the reciprocality of therelationship of the store-consciousness and the six conscious-nesses, memory can also be explained. A perception leavesan impression in the store-consciousness, which colors futurecognitions, but, in addition, under special circumstances andin connection with special stimuli, the seed of that perceptionmay suddenly evolve, penetrating the sixth consciousness in theform of a memory.In this treatise, there are also arguments against theories ofthe Ärya-Sämmitfyas, Buddhists not completely dedicated tothe theory of momentariness, who admit a more-or-less unchang-ing personality-entity.* Vasubandhu argues against any en-tity \"self\". He also argues against the Sämmitiya thesis thatmanifest action represents a \"motion\", \"a progression of thesame thing to another locus\". Vasubandhu subjects all of theSämmitiya arguments for the existence of \"motion\" to sharpcriticism. Just because a thing is perceived to be the samefrom one moment to the next does not mean that the thing atmoment 1 and the thing at moment 2, may not be really different,because of subtle differences not directly perceived. The im-plication of Vasubandhu's arguments is that if things are notchanging in every moment, they could never change at all.Vasubandhu in this treatise reduces actions having karmicretribution to volitions. This is a point of ethics in whichVasubandhu is at great odds with the Jains. The Jains wouldsay that any action which causes suffering, whether intentionalor not, must have a retribution of suffering, since to the suffer-ing being, it is irrelevant whether the action was intentionallycommitted or not. The unintentional suffering caused toothers by eating is still the eater's responsibility : thus the Jainway out is sallekhanä, final self-starvation. But Vasubandhumust, to be consistent, focus on the intentions of the \"agent\".The Jain path of absolute non-action, so as to avoid unintendedinfliction of suffering, cannot appeal to Vasubandhu, since as aMahäyänist he is committed to the active alleviation of suffering.Many other problems are incidentally treated in this work>and many Abhidharmika categories subjected to criticism.•See Sämmitiya-nikäya-sästra, cf.

If it is a configuration of the body, how can one call itan act which has been committed by the body ? It is, afterall, said to be an act committed by it.Vaibhäsika : Since such an act (i.e. a bodily act) has refer-ence to one part of the body in general, it is called \"a confi-guration of the body\", (i.e. a configuration of one part of thebody, e.g. \"a gesture of the hand\"), and since it arises dependentupon the great elements7 of the body in general, it is called \"anact committed by the body\".

It could be due to a special aggregation of these colorsthat \"long\", \"short\", etc., arise as cognitions.

Andit would strengthen the doctrine of the school of Kanada, whichstates that composites exist as entities which penetrate theircomponents.114. 12When an aggregation of color appears in one directionin great quantity, it evokes the idea of \"long\". If it appearsthus in only a small quantity, it evokes the idea of \"short\".When it appears equal in each of four sides, it evokes the ideaof \"square\". If there is an equal distance everywhere from itscircumference to its center, it evokes the idea of \"circular\".When a greater quantity of color appears amassed at its cen-tral portion, it evokes the idea of \"convex\", and when a smallerquantity appears there, it evokes the idea of \"concave\". Whenit appears to go along in one direction, it evokes the idea of\"even\", and when it appears to go along in various directions,it evokes the idea of \"uneven\".*Though ideas of various configurations may arise when avariegated quilt appears in such a manner, yet following yourtheory these various kinds of configuration cannot logicallybe situated within one locus, just as, for example, various colorscannot.

This would be like the cases whereanother citta arises from a citta, a different product in dyeingarises from a previous product, curds arise from milk, winearises from the juice of grapes, and vinegar arises from wine.16If this were so, there would be nothing which could be called atrue movement which has the characteristic of a progressionof the same thing to another locus.10. Moreover, when a thing is stable, it has no movement.And if it has no movement, it js constantly stable. (On theother hand, if it is not stable, it also has no movement*.)Ärya-Sämmitiya : If this is really so, what is it that appearsin another locus (in those cases we construe as being movementof the same thing) ?V : The same thing doesn't appear.Ärya-Sämmitiya : Well then what does ?V : It is similar to the case where grass-fires or shadowsappear in each locus as something new and something newagain. The same shadow never appears in another locus. For(1) while that which is connected with it remains stationary,it appears to arise, to be obscured, and to change, because thesunlight is far away, near at hand, or changing; (2) as soonas a bright area is darkened in another place, a shadow appears.Our opponent may well object : \"Though, if someone saysthat there is a progression consisting of the same thing movingto another locus, it may be argued, 'How do you arrive at this ?';if someone says that it is not the same thing moving to anotherlocus, one can equally argue, 'How do you arrive at this ?'\"The basis for this assumption is the very argument alreadygiven : \"Moreover, when a thing is stable, it has no movement\",*cf.

To hold that thesense-field of tactile sensations is either beneficial or unbene-ficial is not the doctrine of the sons of Säkya.*17aSauryodayika : In that case, is the body which arises inanother locus through the special citta itself manifest action ?V : If this were so, manifest action would be purely men-tally constructed, and would not be a true entity, since thereis no constituency as one entity as regards the body. And also,manifest action would become non-informing, because thereis no informing of others of the intentions of living beings throughthe smell, etc., connected with a body.

Citta has two aspects: the first accumulates (cinoti) seeds;the second is manifold (citrd) on account of having variousobjects-of-consciousness, aspects, and special differentiatingcharacteristics.* The state is said to be without citta because thereis a deficiency of the second kind there, just as, for example,one calls a chair that has only one leg, \"legless\".32.

Thus, these effectsseem to arise at a later time by the store consciousness beinginfluenced by certain volitions. But thus it can also be demons-trated that bodily and verbal actions are not possessed of thecharacteristics which have been described for them.41. Opponent : If bodily and verbal actions are not accept-ed in that manner (i.e. in the Vaibhäsika manner, where abodily act is defined as an act committed by the body, etc.), isit possible to deny the statement of the sütra, which states thatthere are three kinds of acts ?V : It is not possible. But it is possible to explain all thisin such a manner that no flaw exists.Opponent : How will there not be a flaw ?V : It is our purpose to explain why it has been taught thatthere are three kinds of acts, what a body is, what an act is, inwhat sense one can speak of \"body\" and \"action\" and \"bodilyaction\". Similarly, it is our purpose to state this also in regardto verbal and mental acts, and as to why only bodily acts, etc.,have been spoken of, and not acts of the eye, etc.42. To begin with, why has this been taught in this manner ?In order to summarise the ten paths of action (the taking oflife, taking what has not been given, offenses of lust, abandon-ment of the taking of life, abandonment of taking what has notbeen given; false speech, slander, harsh speech, idle talk, theabandonment of false speech, the abandonment of slander,the abandonment of harsh speech, and the abandonment ofidle talk; covetousness, malice, wrong views, the abandonmentof covetousness, the abandonment of malice, the abandonmentof wrong views) with three kinds of action for those who wouldbecome frightened by the many things to be done, just as thethree trainings were taught to Vrjiputraka**.65aCertain people (the Tirthankaras)66 say that only the actionscommitted by the body truly exist, and that verbal and mentalacts both do not exist, because they are only discriminations,and it was also to explain to them that those two are also actionthat the three kinds of acts were taught in this manner.*cf. Majjhima I, 138 II, 263 etc, etc.**Anguttara I, 130."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118   Seven Works of Vasubandhu43. The body is a special collection of great material ele-ments and events derived from the great material elements, acorporeal mass associated with sense faculties. Action is aspecial volition. (Thus bodily action is actually a volition direct-ed towards the body.)44. A body exists in the sense that an accumulation exists,for it is an accumulation of atoms of great material elements,and atoms of that which is derived from the great materialelements. Certain people say that it exists only in the sense ofan accumulation of defilements, because the body is a well ofunclear elements. But following the view of these people,there could be, for example, no bodies for gods.45. An act is an intentional impulse in an \"agent's\" manas.46. An act which sets the body into agitation is calleda \"bodily act\". There are three kinds of volitions: those which pre-pare, those which decide, and those which \"set into agitation\".Those that \"set into agitation\" are those which are called\"bodily action\", as it is they through which there is broughtabout the motile element (wind, gaseousness) which is the causefor the arising in another locus on the part of the series whichis associated with it. It is called \"bodily action\" because themiddle phrase has been omitted, just as one speaks of \"medi-cinal balä-oil\"*\"4\\ or of a \"dust wind\" (when what is really meantis \"the medicinal oil prepared from the fcö/ä-plant\" and \"a windwhich raises dust\").Opponent : But as three divisions of the paths of action,namely : the taking of life, the taking of what has not beengiven, and offenses of lust, are admitted to be bodily action,how can this term refer to a volition ?V : Because this killing and taking and offenses take placebecause of it. That which has been committed by a bodilyseries engendered by it is said to be committed by it (i.e.- thatwhich is committed by a bodily series impelled by a volition,is said to be committed by that volition). Just as one says \"avillage burned by thieves\" and \"rice cooked with grass\" (fora village which has been burned by a fire kindled by thieves,and for rice which has been cooked by fire arising from grass).Opponent : How can a volition be called a path of action ?V : Though it is also simply action, it is also a path of actionas it is the path which leads to the two kinds of courses :"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  119favorable and unfavorable. Or, if you will, the path of action isthe agitation of the body, since the three kinds of action we havecalled \"volition\" evolve dependent upon it.47. It is as a favor to worldlings that these are also describedas bodily action. Though there is nothing beneficial or unbene-ficial within them, they are thus designated metaphorically,because by that means the world will undertake resorting to,and abandoning, certain volitions.Opponent: If only volition is beneficial and unbeneficialaction, how is it that it is said in the sütras* : \"There is a three-fold action which when committed by the body after havingbeen intended, is accumulated as unbeneficial, giving rise tosuffering, and having suffering as its retribution.\" ?*V : The intention was to speak of volition's medium, sub-tratum, and object-of-consciousness. The volition which isdifferent from those volitions having a medium, substratum,and object-of-consciousness in the body or voice, is called \"men-tal action\", because it is associated with manas, and because itdoes not incite the body or voice.Opponent : If this is so, how is it that the Exalted One hasspoken of \"volition\" and \"the act which is committed afterhaving willed\" ?**V : Among the three kinds of volition which we haveindicated previously, it is the third which is called \"act com-mitted after having willed\", since the body, etc., is incitedby it after this has been willed by the first two kinds ofvolitions.48. \"Speech\" means \"words\", i.e. those special vocal emis-sions which communicate meanings. Verbal action is that voli-tion which brings forth these utterances.

The rest is to be explained justas before.Opponent : If only volition is bodily action, how can therebe either restraint, or absence of restraint in those who are ofdistracted citta, or without citta, as there is no volition in thesestates ?V : Because the impressions left by special volitions havenot been suppressed, both restraint and the absence ofrestraint may exist in these states. The term \"special\"refers to that special volition which can be examined asoriginating the unmanifest action \"restraint\" and \"absence ofrestraint\".Opponent : What is the suppression of these impressions ?V : As has been acknowledged, this suppression is thebeing of any cause for a volition of either abandonment or non-abandonment of the unbeneficial paths of action.Opponent : Through what does this suppression occur ?V : It occurs through whatever volition can be examinedas originating a manifest action which is the cause for theabandoning of restraint and its non-arising, and through anyother causes of abandoning different from that.50.

See p. 58.2. Action and its threefold divisionThe threefold division of action into bodily, verbal, and mental actoccurs in fully-developed form already in various suttas of the Päli Nikä-yas (notably Digha III, 191, 245, and 279; Majjhima I 415-420; AnguttaraI 32, 104, and 201). The germs for such a division can be seen in some ofthe earliest Buddhist writings, where the monk is implored to guard him-self in body, speech, and mental activity (Sutta-nipäta 330, 365; Dhamma-pada 231-234, 281, 361, 391). Sometimes in the suttas there are mentionedonly two kinds of activity, e.g. at various passages where guarding bodyand speech are referred to only {Majjhima I, 461; Samyutta I, 182). Butthe triple division is taken for granted in both early Theraväda and Sarvästi-väda Abhidharma (Dhammasangani 981; Bareau, Sectes—Sarvästivädathesis no. 117, p. 150) as well as in other Abhidharma traditions (e.g. theMahisäsaka (?) Säriputräbhidharmasästra, Taisho 1548, cf. Bareau, p. 198,thesis no. 42). It is a natural enough division for a school of thought thatholds that intentions themselves determine the ethical nature of an act,though the specific interpretation of what it includes differs radically amongBuddhist ethical theorists.It must be kept in mind that when Vasubandhu, and his Vaibhäsikaopponents, speak of \"action\" (karma), they mean an activity which can besubsumed under one or another of the retributional categories : unbene-ficial (akusala), beneficial (kusala), and indeterminate (avyäkrta)* Thatis, they either have, for the \"agent\", a consequence of suffering, or freedomfrom suffering, or are volitional but devoid of a definite consequence. Byno means all activity (Sumatisila's \"karana\") is action in this technical sense.3. Vijnapti and avijnapti : Manifest and unmanifest actionA \"vijnapti\" (lit. \"an announcement\", \"communication\", \"intima-tion\", but also in Vasubandhu's later usage \"a perception\") is an act whichis manifestly perceptible to others besides the agent. A \"manifest action\"of the body is thus any action which can be seen by another, such as a ges-ture, etc.; a \"manifest action\" of speech is the actual closing and openingof the lips perceptible by the visual consciousness, and the result of whichis perceived by the audial consciousness.\"Avijnapti\", on the other hand, is a peculiarly Vaibhäsika term involv-ing some difficulties. An avijnapti is always preceded by a manifest action(see Kosa I, ad 13-14c), and represents a subtle continuation which the ac-tion proper, the manifest action, has initiated. It may arise even when theagent is not conscious. Initially dependent on a conscious manifest actionor a mental action, it represents a residual force which has as its locus thematerial elements of the agent's organism. It is itself regarded as materialfor this reason {Kosa I, ad 13-14, LVP, p. 20), though it is exempt from theusual characteristics of materiality, inasmuch as it is not directly perceptible,and does not exercise physical resistance.*see page 55."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"122   Seven Works of VasubandhuTo clarify this somewhat difficult concept, one may take recourse to anexample employed by both La Vallee Poussin (Kosa IV, p 3, n. 2, 2) andGokhale (\"What is avijnapti-rupa ?\", New Indian Antiquary I, 1938, p 69)in their explanations of the term : A man orders another man to commita murder, and in so doing commits a manifest verbal action. The assassinin turn, at the time of the murder, commits a manifest bodily action. Whenthe murder is committed, the instigator himself becomes guilty of the crime,though he may not be committing any manifest action at the time, andmay in fact be asleep. To the Vaibhäsika, there must be a real entity pre-sent to account for his acquiring the retribution of a murderer, and this issupplied by positing an \"unmanifest action\", which arises as soon as thecrime is committed, but which can be traced back to the verbal action andvolition which instigated it. Unmanifest actions are divided into threegeneral types : those which can be characterized as \"restraint\"(.yaj?2Vtfra),as \"lack of restraint\" (asarrivar a), and as neither one nor the other {KosaIV, ad 13a-b, LVP, p. 43). Our murder would belong actually to the thirdtype, which is described as any unbeneficial or beneficial act which can becomprised neither within manifest action, mental action, nor within therestraint of disciplinary rules, meditation, and the holy man's path, norwithin their reversal (Kosa IV, ad 37c-d, LVP, pp. 93-94). According tothe Vaibhäsikas, the beneficiality of the higher meditational states, wherethere is no more possibility of manifest action or volition, is due to the avi-jnapti of restraint resulting from the initial act of entering into meditation.A monk's keeping silent at the confession of misdeeds during the recital ofthe Prätimoksa would similarly be an unmanifest action of lack of restraint,if he has committed misdeeds, as again no manifest or mental action maybe present during his silence. \"Avijiiapti\", by the way, is not really analo-gous to the psychoanalytic concept of \"unconscious act\", since a consciousact must always precede its emergence. Nor should it be considered themechanism of any retribution, as this is taken care of in other ways by theVaibhäsika, and avijnapti arises only as a result of certain acts, not all. (Onthis, see the article by Yamada, \"On the idea of avijnapti-karma\", IBK10, 1962, pp. 51-55.)Vasubandhu defined unmanifest action {Kosa I, 11) only to subsequentlyrefute it as a real entity (Ko$a IV, ad 3d). His definition came under theattack of Sahghabhadra in his Abhidharmasamayapradipikä, and resultedin Vasubandhu's revision of his definition in A Discussion of the Five Aggre-gates. (On this, see the notes of La Vallee Poussin and Gokhale.) Argu-ments against unmanifest action are found also in this treatise.4. On manas, see pp. 60-61.5. Sanisthäna, \"configuration\".To the Vaibhäsika, the visible is divided into two aspects : color and\"sanisthäna\". (See Kosa I, ad 10a.) These two are considered distinctsense-impressions, and are thus for the Vaibhäsikas two separate sorts ofreal entities (dravya, see note 5a). \"Sarnsthäna\" is usually divided intoeight general categories : \"long\", \"short\", \"quadrangular\", \"circular\",\"convex\", \"concave\", \"even\" or \"straight\", and \"uneven\" or \"crooked\"."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  123(On the translations of these terms, see note 12.) The omission of trianglesmay rest on the fact that they can be derived from quadrangulars.\"Sarristhäna\" can thus be rendered as \"shape\". The only reason the trans-lation \"configuration\" is employed here is because \"samsthäna\" is eithera shape that appears stable to the visual consciousness, or one which isundergoing changes. It is to this second kind of \"samsthäna\" that the Vai-bhäsika reduces manifest bodily actions. For example, we say that we seea man moving his arm, but what we actually see, the Vaibhäsika says, iscertain combinations of visual shapes undergoing changes. Apparentlymanifest bodily actions, to be truly manifest, have to be seen, since theycan only be inferred by a blind man. Of course, one's own bodily actionsare directly manifest to oneself, but the defining characteristic of manifestaction is that it should be manifest to another. As it is being used here,the word \"configuration\" means both a shape and any combination of sha-pes, changing or unchanging.5a. DravyaThe Vaibhäsika criteria for considering something a real entity, or dravya>are :(1) its characterised must be distinguished as special by at least oneconsciousness {Kosa I, ad lOd) (a characteristic of this sort is called a \"sva-laksana\", \"own-characteristic\");(2) it must not be susceptible to further division (Ibid, and Kosa VI, 4).True entities would thus to the Vaibhäsika be only the moment-atoms ofmateriality and the momentary flashes of feelings, motivating dispositions,cognitions, and consciousness-perceptions. A body, a flame, and, for thatmatter, a consciousness-series, can thus not really be considered a dravya.(cf. Vibhäsä, MCB V, pp 128-129; Sahghabhadra's Abhidharmanyäyänu-sära chapt. 51, tr. LVP, MCBV, p. 106.)A dravya has a specific manner of being, or nature (its \"own-being\", sva-bhävä) which is apprehended by one or another of the consciousnesses, ora combination of several, as an \"own-characteristic\". A change in charac-teristics is always a change in things : there are in fact no underlying enti-ties which have characteristics—there is only whatever is presented to theconsciousnesses themselves.In this connection, the Vibhäsä makes much of its distinction betweentwo levels of reality. First, there is common-sense reality, conventionalreality (sawntisatya), sometimes called \"truth of designation\" {prajnapti-satya), which speaks of \"people\" as people, \"jars\" as jars, and, even moreremotely from any true dravyas, \"nations\" as nations, \"armies\" as armies,etc. Then there is ulimate truth (paramärtha-satya), which has as its objectthe true svalaksanas of true dravyas. Actually, one could very well say*that the Vibhäsä really distinguishes three levels, because it categorizes allevents into 75 basic types of dravyas, constituents which even in the lastanalysis work in a certain way. This is not quite the same as paramärtha-satya, since it subsumes true dravyas, the momentary entities, into variousbroader categories. We might for convenience's sake call this level 'Wra-*Vasubandhu in fact does something of the sort at Kosa II, ad 22."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124   Seven Works of Vasubandhuvyasatya\", though this term is usually used by the Vibhäsä as a synonymfor \"paramärthasatyä*. At least one of the philosophers held in greatesteem by the Vibhäsä, namely the Bhadanta Vasumitra, had come to aninteresting conclusion regarding paramärthasatya. He held that all desig-nations are only prajnaptisat, but that underlying each designation thereis some complex of moments which are paramarthasat but in their true statehopelessly elusive to those who rely on discursive thought alone, and charac-terizable only by the most general of designations (such as \"being in thestate of having causes and conditions\") {Vibhäsä, quoting the BhadantaVasumitra, MCB V, pp 166-167). And the Vibhäsä itself, in one of its\"options\", went so far as to say that it was possible to hold that there isonly one theory reagarding conditioned events which can be ultimatelytrue, i.e. \"All things are empty and devoid of self.\" {Vibhäsä, MCBV, p.164). This is, of course, the opinion of Nägärjuna as well as, ultimately,the opinion of Vasubandhu himself (See the Commentary on the Separationfrom Extremes, and the Teaching of the Three Own-Beings included in thisvolume). Later Vaibhäsikas seem to have lost sight of the Bhadanta Vasu-mitra's word of caution. Evidence for this is to be found not only in Vasu-bandhu's critiques of their theories (which after all may have been hardenedinto more rigid shape by Vasubandhu himself, in order to make his polemicmore convincing*), but also in the treatises of Sanghabhadra and the Dlpa-kära themselves.To return to the question of \"dravyas\", the Vaibhäsikas consider thesense-fields such true entities, though strictly speaking they meet neither ofthe criteria given above. A sense-field is really a collection of dravyas,grouped together because of certain common distinctive general character-istics {sämänyavisesalaksana)—they are thus (in our usage) \"dravyasat\",but not paramarthasat. Vasubandhu attacked the Vaibhäsikas for callingsuch a collection a \"dravya\", and said that their use of the term was incon-sistent and capricious {Kosa II, ad 22). As a matter of fact, for the Vaibhä-sika to remain consistent, a \"sense-field\" can have only \"truth of designa-tion\", since they are collections of atoms (cf. Kosa I, ad 44a-b), and theindividual atoms themselves, according to the Vaibhäsika, are not percep-tible, and thus cannot be sense-fieldsCKafa I, ad 20a-b). Similarly, an aggre-gate making up \"personality\" cannot be a real entity, since it is a series ofmomentary events (Ibid). It had been usual for along time within Abhi-dharma to subsume all the basic constituents of experience under at leastone aggregate, and one of the sense-fields (See the methodology of Dhä-tukathä I). This again cannot be an ultimately real way of looking at things,particularly if atomism is adhered to. On the other hand, an object-of-consciousness has to be a real entity, because what isn't real has no facultyfor producing a cognition, according to the Vaibhäsika. The Vaibhäsikas'atom has no such faculty, and \"aggregations of atoms\", which are said•It is at least the opinion of G. Sasaki that Vasubandhu may have deli-berately made the Vibhäsä sound more dogmatic than it is {A study of Abhi-dharma Philosophy, Introduction, p 3 ff)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  125to have it, have no unity, and thus can't be entities, following, the Vaibhä-sikas' other criterion. Vasubandhu, on this and other grounds (see KosaI ad 10; I ad 13; I ad 44; II ad 22; I ad 43c-d, III ad 100a-b), dispenseswith atomism, and, while maintaining the two criteria, regards as dravyathat which is perceived as one, thus ruling out the Vaibhäsika atom as wellas collections such as \"a body\", \"an army\", etc. (Dignäga, following Vasu-bandhu, also criticized the Vaibhäsika atom on the grounds mentionedabove, cf. Pramänasamuccaya I, II, ad 2c-d, Hattori, pp. 33-34; Älam-banapariksä, and cf. Hattori, n.2,17, p. 118. Similar arguments are tobe found in the Jain logician Mallavädi, cf. Dvädasäranyacakra, ed, MuniJambuvijaya, p. 96).Sanghabhadra himself drops the Vibhäsä's criteria, and the characterof a dravya is for him simply that it can give rise to a citta, when this cittaarises without having to depend on anything but the one thing perceived(Nyäyänusära, chapt. 50, MCB V, pp. 28-29). According to Sanghabhadra,.a dravya may differ in bhävas, specific types, but its general manner of being,its svabhäva, is of one sort. This would seem to be some sort of a distinc-tion between essential and secondary characteristics, which the Vibhäsäitself, in spite of some resulting difficulties, does not make. In fact it con-siders this distinction a major flaw in the theories of the Bhadanta Dharma-träta (Vibhäsä, MCB V, p 24). It is certainly anathema to Vasubandhu,who holds that criteria for the determination of primary, as against secon-dary, characteristics cannot be found (A Discussion for the Demonstrationof Action, 15-17).6. ÄlambanaThis term is here translated as \"object-of-consciousness\" in order to bringout the distinction between it and visaya. The latter is usually defined asthe object of the sense-organ itself, whereas the former is the object of thecorresponding consciousness. The visaya is properly the \"thing out there\"as the organ comes \"into contact\" with it; the älambana is one's impressionof it. (See Kosa I, ad 29b-c.) On \"citta\", see pp. 59-60.7. See A Discussion of the Five Aggregates, p. 65.8. Vipäkahetu, \"Retributory cause\" or \"maturational cause\".A retributory cause is any volitional act with an ethical \"charge\" strongenough to give the result either of suffering or of freedom from sufferingfor the \"series\" which instigated it (cf. Kosa II, 54c-d). Presumably,what is intended here by \"a configuration which has arisen from formeraspiration\" is any change in shape, size, etc. which was longed for in thepast, and which has finally been attained due to beneficial past actions.Sumatisila's example, \"May I have lips as red as a bimba-fruit\" (Kar-masiddhitikä p. 204, 4, 8) is perhaps not completely adequate, as this wouldnot necessarily entail a change of configuration for the Vaibhäsika. Butit is a humorous example of the kinds of rather frivolous motivations whichoften lay behind Buddhist acts of piety. As an example of such an aspira-tion which includes the Vaibhäsikas' \"configuration\", and yet echoes thespirit of Sumatisila's example, there is the following inscription of the Bur-mese Queen Caw, from the 8th-9th centuries, marking the dedication of"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"126   Seven Works of Vasubandhua monastery at Pagan : \"Meantime, before I reach Nirvana, by virtueof the great work of merit I have done, may I prosper as a man and bemore happy than all other men.

The Vaibhasika Atomic TheoryThe atomic theory evolved by the Vaibhasika philosophers is found nei-ther in the Jhänaprasthäna, the ancient work on which the Vibhäsä is osten-sibly a commentary, nor in any of the other \"padas\" of the SarvästivädaAbhidharma (see McGovern, Manual of Buddhist Philosophy, p. 125). Oneof the earliest texts to give the theory is apparently the Abhidharmasäraof Dharmasri, which was translated into Chinese (Taisho 1550) in 250 A.D.McGovern thinks that Dharmasri borrowed the theory from Kanada, andthat the Jain atomic theory may have a similar source. But Dharmasri'satomism is quite different in nature from Kanäda's, and the Jain theory,which may actually antedate Kanada, differs radically from them both,(cf. Schubring, Doctrine of the Jainas, pp. 131 ff). An important differencebetween Dharmasri's and Kanäda's atomism is that for Kanada, atomsare eternal, whereas for Dharmasri, they are momentary, though theymay form \"series\". Another difference lies in the fact that Dharmasrimaintains fourteen different kinds of atoms : Besides the atoms of thefour great elements (see p. 75), each sense-object and sense-organ has withinit a special kind of atom to which its particular qualities are due (Abhi-dharmasära 1, quoted McGovern, p. 126). This is, as McGovern says, simi-lar to the conception of late 19th century chemistry, where each of the ninetyodd elements was held to have a special kind of atom. Though perhapsthe seed for Dharmasri's atomism may be seen in his familiarity with theVaisesika and Jain theories, to speak of outright borrowing, as McGoverndoes, is somewhat strong in the light of the fact that Dharmasri's theory isreally quite unique, and moulded to Buddhist sentiments of impermanence.Dharmasri's theory is considered standard by the Vibhäsä, which .makesfrequent use of it. Through this highly influential text it found its waynot only into the crystallizations of its system in the philosophies of the\"Neo-Vaibhäsikas\" : Sanghabhadra, the Dipakära, and, in fundamentalopposition, Vasubandhu, but even into the Theraväda theories of Buddha-ghosa (in the Atthasälini) and Anuruddha (Compendium, p. 164 ff). (Thequestion of the extent of Vaibhasika influence on 5th century Theraväda hasas yet not been much investigated : There is a possibility that Buddhaghosa"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  127derived many of his specific theories from the Vibhäsä. CertainlyAnuruddha's atomism, at any rate, is identical with the Vibhäsa's. On aprobable influence of Vasubandhu's Yogäcära on 5th century Theraväda,see S. Sarathcandra, \"The Abhidhamma Psychology of Perception andthe Yogäcära Theory of Mind,\" U. of Ceylon Review IV, 1956, pp. 49-57.)There are thus, in standard Vaibhäsika theory these fourteen differentkinds of atoms : atoms of \"earth\", \"fire\", \"water\", and \"wind\", atoms ofcolor, sound, smell, taste, and the tangible, eye-atoms, ear-atoms, nose-atoms, tongue-atoms, and body-atoms, for the specific parts of these organsthat function as sense-fields for the consciousnesses (On the arrangementof these special atoms in the organs, see Kosa I, ad 43c-44d). The atomscorresponding to the sense-fields own their origination and specific quali-ties to transformations and combinations within the elemental atoms—there-fore they are called \" derivative\" (upädäya) or \"secondary\" {bhautika).In the theories of Sanghabhadra and the Vaibhäsika as criticized by Vasu-bandhu, a minimum of eight kinds of atoms must join to form an aggre-gation or molecule (sanghäta), for actual perceptibility in the realm of de-sires, i.e. the normal world outside of meditationCSToia II, ad 22). Theseare the four kinds of elemental atoms and the four atoms of color, odor,taste, and secondary tangibility (i.e. smoothness, roughness, etc. Primarytangibility—liquidity, etc., is a mark of the four great elements themselves).Each atom of derivative materiality needs a set of four elemental atomsfor itself, so that the actual number of atoms in the simplest molecule issixteen. In the case of molecules which resound, there will in additionbe present a sound-atom, so that there will be five derivative and twentyelemental atoms. The molecules of the simplest animate bodies will becomeeven complex, since they must each contain an atom of the tactile sense,touch being in Vaibhäsika biological theory, as in Aristotle's and Darwin'sthe most basic and primordial sense held by living beings. Molecules ofthe other sense-organs must have at least ten kinds of atoms, since eachmust contain not only the four elemental atoms, four sense-object atoms,and the atom of tactile sense, but also an additional kind of atom for theparticular sense-organ in question. It can thus be seen that no matter whatthe namber of atoms in a molecule may be, the four great elements alwaysappear together, and in equal proportion. There is as much of the hotelement, \"fire\", in wood, or in water, as there is in a flame. The differencelies only in the \"intensity\", which is not further explained (at least not inthe Kosa, the Dipa, and the Abhidharmävatära). Vasubandhu says that thepresence of \"water\", the cohesive element, in a flame is proved by the flame'skeeping a shape, and the presence of the solid element, \"earth\", in water,is shown by the fact that water can support a ship {Kosa II, ad 22).Within this theory, an atom should strictly speaking be that portion ofmateriality so small that it cannot be subjected to further division, whetherphysically or by reasoning, just as the moment is the smallest extent of time.This is the manner in which Sanghabhadra defines it (Nyäyänusära 23, 3,cf. La Vallee Poussin, Kosa II, p. 144, note 3). But Vasubandhu notes thatoccasionally there is an inconsistency in the terminology of the Vaibhäsikas,"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"128   Seven Works of Vasubandhui.e. sometimes they say \"atom\" when they should say \"aggregationof atoms\" {Kosa II, ad 22). Sanghabhadra himself is very careful to makethe distinction (La Vallee Poussin, Kosa II, p. 145, note 3), but it seems some-what botched in the discussion of the DIpakäraCDi/w II, 110-111, pp. 65-66).For the DIpakära, the atoms are the ultimate units of materiality whichhave the capacity for appearing in the world, i.e. they would correspondto what Vasubandhu and Sanghabhadra designate as an \"aggregation\".When referring to the different elements making up this \"atom\", the DIpa-kära speaks only of \" entities\" (dravya). Furthermore, his discussion dif-fers from Safighabhadra's and Vasubandhu's on the question of the mini-mum number of kinds of \"entities\" necessary for an atom's appearance inthe realm of desires. He says seven, which presumably would be the fourgreat elements, color, odor, and taste—the tangible being for him entirelyincluded within the properties of the great elements.10. See note 5a.11. The Vaisesika Theory of Composite wholesThis theory, which states that a composite exists as a new entity, a com-posite whole (avayavin) penetrating its component parts, is, as Vasubandhutells us, a speciality of the Vaisesikas. However, it is not found in the süt-ras of Kanada himself, but rather finds its first extant explicit mention inthe Nyäya-sütms of Gautama {Nyäya-sütra II, I 31-37; IV, II 4-16). Itis further elaborated by Prasastapäda and by Vätsyäyana, both of whommay have been older contemporaries of Vasubandhu (cf. Prasastapäda-bhäsyatikäsangraha, Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series No. 255, pp. 169, 173;Vätsyäyana, Nyäyabhäsya, ad II, I, 31-37; ad IV, II 4-16).The reasons for the formulation of this theory are, in brief, the follow-ing : The Vaisesika, like the Vaibhäsika, subscribes to an atomic theory,though his atoms, unlike the moment-atoms of the Vaibhäsika, are eternal.To both, discrete and detached minute entities form the basic stuff of thematerial universe. External reality as it presents itself to us however hasunified realities, and the question emerges as to what the unifying agencyis. To the Vaibhäsika, as to Vasubandhu, and as later to Dignäga, theseunities are constructed subjectively, but the Vaisesika, being a \"realist\"(curiously in both the modern and medieval senses of the term), has to positan objective reality as their basis. There is furthermore a problem becauseVaisesika atoms, like Vaibhäsika ones, are imperceptible, and yet their com-pounds are perceived (cf. Nyäya-sütra IV, II, 13-14). The Vaibhäsikatakes care of this problem by assuming that aggregations of atoms becomeperceptible, though atoms in isolation are imperceptible, just as one hairmay not be visible at a distance, but a mass of hair will be. The Vaisesika,however, assumes atoms to be absolutely imperceptible. Thus it is assum-ed by the Vaisesika that a composite is an entity in itself, having a diffe-rent set of qualities from its parts, though occupying the same locus. Ifthe composite whole did not exist, Vätsyäyana says, one could only infer,and never directly perceive, objects like trees, since at any one time one hasonly a partial perception of parts of the tree. According to Vätsyäyana,the perception of the composite whole \"tree\" takes place simultaneouslyWKh the perception of certain parts of the tree {Nyäyabhäsya, ad II, I, 30-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"A Dscussion For the Demonstration of Action  12937). He adds that unitary conceptions, such as \"tree\", \"jar\", etc. mustarise from something which is really one, and can't emerge from mere aggre-gations {Nyäyabhäsya, ad II, I, 37).The concept of the composite whole also plays a role in Nyäya-Vaisesikacausality. In a cause and effect sequence, a new substance, a compositewhole (cloth) emerges from the material causes (threads), and the parts con-tinue to exist within the composite whole, though, according to Vätsyä-yana, the avayavin together with its parts make up only one entity. It wasnot until Uddyotakara that the parts were regarded as separate entitiespersisting along with the composite-whole entity. (See D.N. Shastri,Critique of Indian Realism, pp 262-271, on the differences between the ear-lier causal theory of Vätsyäyana, where the cause, as an entity, is destroyedbefore the emergence of the effect, and the later theory, hinted at by Uddyo^takara, but not crystallized until Srldhara, where the causes continue toexist as entities within the composite whole.) Even to Vätsyäyana, atomiccausality is an exception : the two atoms making up the composite wholeof a dyad or double-atom {dvyanukd) continue to exist as entities. Thefact that all further combinations of atoms are composite wholes havingdifferent qualities from their parts, will explain why a jar is perceptible,whereas its atoms are not.Vasubandhu does not here bother to refute the composite whole alter-native, since its mere mention would probably be enough to make a trueVaibhäsika flinch. On a previous occasion, however, he has presented arefutation of the avayavin theory, a theory he considers \"infantile\"C&?i#III, ad 100a-b). His arguments there for the most part rest on the samesorts of epistemological reasons that Vätsyäyana raises in favor of the con-cept. They can be outlined as follows :(1) When the organ of the visual or tactile consciousness is in contactwith one thread, the cloth is not perceived. If the composite whole \"cloth\"exists in each thread, it would have to be perceived even if only one of itsthreads is {Kosa III, ad 100a-b, LVP, p 211).(2) If the Vaisesika says that the composite whole does not exist withineach of its parts, how will it be demonstrated that it is anything but the col-lection of these parts ? (Ibid, p 212).(3) If the Vaisesika says that the composite whole does exist within eachof its parts, but that the perception of one thread does not result in the per-ception of cloth because the perception of cloth presumes contact of theorgan with several of the parts, then if one sees the border of a cloth, onewould see the wnole cloth.(4) If the Vaisesika says that the perception of the composite wholedepends upon the perception of its central and other portions, one couldnever see a composite whole, since one can never see its central and end-parts simultaneously.(5) If the Vaisesika says that these parts are perceived in succession,then the perception of \"cloth\" does not differ from the perception of a\"circle\" that results from hurling a torch in a full arc. Objects-of-conscious-ness of such perceptions cannot be real entities in any way."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130   Seven Works of Vasubandhu(6) When threads of different colors come together to form a cloth, howcan this cloth be considered an entity ? (Ibid, pp 212-213). This argumentdepends on the fact that according to Vaisesika metaphysics, qualities likecolor, etc, must pervade their substances wholly. Thus one substance canhave only one quality of a type. So what does one do with a cloth of manycolors ? Clearly it cannot be a substance-entity in the Vaisesika sense.This last argument was quite terrifying to the Vaisesikas, and promptedUddyotakara to assume that \"variegated color\" must in this case be regard-ed as one color. This conclusion was rejected as absurd by the Navya-Naiyäyikas (cf. Shastri, p 256). Even admitting Uddyotakara's ratherfar-fetched solution, the question can be re-phrased in a manner which makesthe problem remain : What does one do about a cloth which is variegatedin color, but has a border of one color only ?Other criticisms, some of which had already disturbed Vätsyäyana :(1) If one thing exists at one place, it can't at the same time exist in an-other. According to Vätsyäyana, the dyad, being a composite whole, residesin its two parts. But its existence in one atom would necessarily excludeits existence in the other.(2) Does the composite whole, which is one, pervade its parts in its en-tirety, or partially ? In the former case, the composite whole will be exhaust-ed in one part, and the remaining parts will be without it. In the lattercase, the composite whole must itself have further parts, by which it per-vades its constituent parts.(3) If the composite whole is a different entity from its parts, it shouldhave a different weight.(4) There seems to be no criterion for which combinations of entitiesgive rise to a composite whole (not all do, e.g. a forest does not).(5) Nor which objects should be regarded as ultimate composite wholes(i.e. those which cannot form further composite wholes).(6) No composite whole can be formed out of parts based on differentmaterial elements, because there is no possibility of generality (sämänya),which must inhere in every particular instance, according to the Vaisesika.Thus neither a human body, which contains blood (water-element), as wellas earth-elements, nor a tree (with its sap) can be a composite whole.12. This passage is close to, but not identical with, Kosa IV, ad 2b-3b.Both the Kosa and the Demonstration of Action passages have been trans-lated into French with some confusion (which cannot, of course, be usuallysaid for translators as eminent as La Vallee Poussin and Lamotte). Actually,there is some confusion in the Tibetan translation of the Kosa passage aswell, since \"vrtta\", which definitely means \"circle\", has been translated as\"lham-pd\\ \"square' (Peking/Tokyo Tibetan Tripitaka, vol. 115, p 193,1,15 ff; cf. the Sanskrit original, ed. Pradhan, p 194). This error isprobably the source of the Mahävyutpattf s confusion where it gives wordswhich unequivocally mean \"circular\" {Vrtta J3 ) and \"quadrangular\"Jf} ) as synonyms {Mahävyutpatti 1878-1886).

This is the term for \"square\" employed by Ärya-bhata in both the senses of an \"equiquadrangular\" and \"the product of twoequal quantities\". (Äryabhatiya, II v. 3 : \" Vargas sama-caturasrah phalanca sadrsa-dvayasya sani^argah:' \"Square' means 'an equiquadrangular';\"the area (of such a quadrangular)', and 'the product of two equalquantities.\" )The terms \"unnata\" and \"avanata\" have been rendered by both translatorsinto French as \"high\" and \"low\", respectively. f^ and \"\"J? arealso the usual translations into Chinese (cf. Mahävyutpatti 1884-1885). How-ever, though \"unnata\" is a common word for \"high\", \"avanata\" does notusually mean \"low\". Besides, the inclusion of \"highland \"low\" in a list thathas already included \"long\" and \"short\", seems somewhat strange. Addto this the fact that Vasubandhu's definitions of the terms \"unnata\" and\"avanata\" make little sense if they are supposed to refer to \"high\" and \"low\".They in fact define the terms \"convex\" and \"concave\". The translation of\"unnata\" by \"convex\", and \"avanata\" by \"concave\", is unproblematicalas far as the Sanskrit is concerned. \"Unnata\" means not only \"raised,elevated\", etc. but also, as Apte's dictionary provocatively puts it, \"pro-jecting, plump, full (as breasts)\" (p. 435). And though we may not wantto translate \"unnata\" as \"convex\" when we are translating Kälidäsa (\"niba-ddnnata-stanam\" : \"full, projecting breasts\", Mälavikägnimitra, Act II, v. 3),this translation fits well with the less passionate and more analytic pointof view of a fellow Gupta.protege, Yasubandhu. Mälavikä's shapely breastsmust certainly be appreciated by Väsubandmi at least as ideal examplesof convex configurations. As for \"avanata\", it never seems to mean \"low\"in classical Sanskrit, but rather \"bent down\", \"stooped\", \"crouched\",\"bowed\". All these are concave configurations.Further light on the terms was provided by \"Sai-chien-ti-lo's\" Abhidhar-mävatära. In its list of the various kinds of configuration, the usual terms\"mthon-po\" and \"dma'-ba\" are omitted, and in their place we have \"sgang\"and \"gshong\"(Joky<x. Peking Tibetan Tripitaka vol. 119, p 44, 1, 1). \"Sgang\"means \"a hill-spur, the ridge or top of a hill\" (Sarat Candra Das, p 320), andseems to be cognate to the verb \"sgang-ba\", \"to grow\" or \"become full\", speci-fically used in the \"becoming full\" of a nubile girl (Jäschke, p 114). \"Gshong\"can also be a \"mountain-ridge\", and it seems to be cognate to theverb shong-ba, \"to have room or space in\" and \"to remove and carryaway.\" A mountain-spur can be either convex or concave, depending onwhat part one is looking at, but the term sgang emphasizes the projection,a convexity, whereas gshong emphasizes the cavity, a concavity. A \"valley\"is indeed \"low\" ^comparison to a mountain, but even more it too is aconcavity."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132   Seven Works of VasubandhuThe terms \"säta\" and \"visäta\", finally, have been translated by both Lamotteand La Vallee Poussin as \"egaV and \"inegal\". But it makes little sense tospeak of a configuration \"equal\", since \"equal\" expresses a relationship.The trouble may lie in the fact that Vasubandhu defines \"säta\" as \"sama-sthäna\"; and \"visäta\" as \"visama-sthäna\" {Kosa lad 10a, Pradhan, p 9).This is the old Vaibhäsika definition, as can be seen by the Abhidharmävatära'sdefinitions \"mnyam-pa\" and \"mi mnyam-pa\" : \"sama\" and \"visama\" (Tib vol.119, p. 44, 1, 2). Now \"sama\" may mean \"equal\", but that is by no meansthe only meaning of the term. It also means \"even, level, straight, plain,easy, pleasant, convenient\". \"Visama\" correspondingly may mean \"uneven,not level, rough, painful, troublesome\". Besides, \"säta\" never means \"equal\",anyway. Its meaning is \"sharpened, whetted, polished, smoothed, madeeven, thin, pleasant\". It is clear that as configurations, \"säta\" and \"visäta\"must mean something like \"even\" and \"uneven\", or \"straight\" and \"crooked\".Vasubandhu's definitions seem to bear this out. {Sama and visama occuragain at Kosa I, ad 10c, Pradhan, p7; La Vallee Poussin, p 18, inreference to smells. Here, La Vallee Poussin's translation \"excessives\" and\"non-excessives\" are very good. This is the \"pleasant\" and \"rough\" aspectof sama and visama.)It is intersesting that Vasubandhu here concentrates solely on the visualaspect of \"configuration\", which becomes reduced to color. And as faras visual configuration is concerned, this reduction seems unassailable,particularly if one remembers that the ancient Indians, unconfined by thedefinitions of modern optics, regarded any shades of light and dark as colors.The Vaibhäsikas in their color-lists included, of the colors recognized byordinary language, only white and the primary colors blue, yellow, andred. Green, etc. were correctly recognized as compound colors, and thusunworthy of entry into a list of elements. Aside from these four, the Vai-bhäsikas listed as colors cloudy (abhram), smoky {dhümah), dusty {rajah),misty (mahikä), shadowy (chäyä), bright or hot light (ätäpa), dimmer or re-flected light ißloka), and darkness (andhakära) (cf. Kosa I, ad 10a,Pradhan, p 6, La Vallee Poussin, p 16), which seem to be differentgradations and mixtures of light and dark.In contrast to his exclusive focus on visual configuration in this treatise,Vasubandhu in the Kosa (IV, ad 3c) had made a powerful argument againstconfiguration's being an entity on the grounds that configuration is equallyan object of the fifth, or tactile consciousness, as of the first or visual. Infact, the convexity of Mälavikä's breasts can perhaps be most fully appre-ciated by means of the fifth, not the first, consciousness! The Vaibhäsikaobjection that the tactile consciousness does not properly apprehend con-figurations, but only construes them on the apprehension of certain arrange-ments of the soft, hard, etc. is brilliantly converted by Vasubandhu into thestatement that the visual consciousness does not apprehend them either,but similarly construes them on the apprehension of certain arrangementsof colors. \"Configuration\" is thus not a distinct object-of-consciousnesswhich could be allotted definitely to one sense-field, and as such is not areal entity, at all.

Perhaps he thought he had enough refuta-tions, already.*The geometry of Vasubandhu and ÄryabhataÄryabhata's geometry is particularly interesting to a student of the Demons-tration of Action, as this great mathematician is not too distant from Vasu-bandhu in both time and place. Äryabhata, who is the earliest extant expo-nent of the mathematics and astronomy of the school of Pätaliputra, giveshis own birth-date as 476, and the date of the composition of his treatiseas 499 {Äryabhatiya III, v. 10). This is assuming that he used the date3102 B.C. for the beginning of the Kali-yuga, which is almost certain, asin fact he may be one of the foremost exponents of this date (cf. Fleet,\"The Kaliyuga Era of B.C. 3102\", JRAS 1911, pp 480 ff). The Sanskritreads :\"Sasty abdänäm sastir yadä vyatitäs trayas ca yugapädäh,try-adhika vimsatir abdäs tadeha mama janmano 'titäh.\"\"Now, when three yugapädas and sixty times sixtyyears have elapsed, twenty-three years of my lifehave passed.\"^ (N.B. The end of the third yugapädamarks the beginning of the Kali-yuga.)He specifies Kusumapura, i.e. Pätaliputra, as the seat of his activity, orat least as the place where his work was appreciated. (II, v. 1 : \"Äryabhatastviha nigadati Kusumapure 'bhyarcitam jnänam.\") He may thus alsohave been a subject of the Guptas, presumably of Budhagupta and hissuccessors.He is most famous for his contributions to astronomy, arithmetic, andalgebra. He was apparently the first Indian astronomer to hold that theearth is a sphere and rotated on an exis (IV 2, 6, 7, 9), for which he wascriticized by Brahmagupta and other later astronomers. His arithmeticand algebra is quite advanced. And though his solid geometry often leavessomething to be desired (cf. II, 6b and 7b), his plane geometry is quite im-pressive. For instance, he arrives at a usable value for 7u, 3. 1416 (II, 10).Unfortunately, the Äryabhatiya is not a complete text of mathematics, andmany definitions are taken for granted.However, there are certain definitions of shapes in Äryabhata, and thesecontrast with Vasubandhu's in several interesting, though to some extentpredictable, ways. Äryabhata defines \"square\" quite rigorously from amathematical point of view : \"Vargas sama-caturasrah\" (II, v. 3) :\"'Square' means 'equiquadrangular' \" i.e. a plane figure which has only fourangles, all of them equal. His term for \"equiquadrilateral\", a quadrila-teral whose sides, but not necessarily whose angles, are equal, would be\"samacaturbhuja\" (cf. II, 11). Following this definition, Vasubandhu's isgeometrically inexact, as he is defining the seeing of an equiquadrilateralonly. (There might be the temptation to accuse Äryabhata's commentatorParamesvara of a similar slip in his gloss on \"equiquadrangular\". Hesays, \"Yasya caturasrasya ksetrasya catväro bähavah.parasparam samäs syukkarnadvayan ca parasparam samam bhavet tat ksetrarn samacaturasram"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134   Seven Works of Vasubandhuity ucyates.\" \"Any quadrangular plane figure of which plane figureall sides are equal to each other, and of which both diagonals are equal toeach other, is called an 'equiquadrangular'.\" But karna, \"diagonal\", isactually a very special sort of diagonal, meaning only one which conjoinswith a right angle. Thus it is used for the hypotenuse of a right triangleand the diagonal of a square or rectangle. Thus Paramesvara's definitionholds.)Äryabhata's definition, on the other hand, is useless for Vasubandhu'spurposes, i.e. as an aid for discovering what is occurring physio-psycholo-gically when we speak of \"seeing a square\". It does not include anythingthat Vasubandhu could recognize as being fundamentally, i.e. psychologi-cally, existent. It must however be noted that what we see as \"square\"is actually not always, as Vasubandhu says, a \"color-aggregation whichappears equal in each of four sides.\" This may be how we geometricallydetermine that it is a square or equiquadrilateral rhombus, but if we takeinto account what the visual consciousness presents to us, whenever wespeak of a \"square\", an equal appearance of each of the four sides is notalways involved. At present there is a \"square\" piece of paper on \"my\"desk—but what the visual consciousness is actually presenting to \"me\"is a kind of rhomboid with unequal sides. Vasubandhu may leave himselfa way out with his verb \"appear\", which could include interpretations imme-diately put on the object of visual consciousness. Thus, while Äryabhata'sis a precise mathematician's definition, Vasubandhu's may be almost asgood a one for telling us what underlies it psychologically. In fact, it isin dealing with plane figures that Vasubandhu's reduction of shape to coloris most convincing.Äryabhata, though he gives us several methods for determining whethera figure is a circle (II, 7; II, 3) unfortunately gives us no complete definition.Vasubandhu's definition is an impeccable one, which even Äryabhata couldhave appreciated.13. The causes and conditions for dyeing an object here enumerated mayrefer to different types of dyeing, any deliberate changing of an object'scolor being referred to in this way. Fire, as Sumatisila's explanations show*,refers perhaps primarily to the firing of pottery. But the other three exam-ples, like Sumatisila's additional example of \"chemical dyes\"**, seem torefer to the dyeing of garments. Fire also being an auxiliary conditionin cloth-dyeing (the boiling of water containing colorific plants and chemi-cal dyestuffs), perhaps all the examples actually refer to the dyeing of gar-ments. Bleaching also being regarded as a dyeing process, the inclusionof \"the sun\" and \"ice\" becomes clear to one who is familiar with the ancientbleaching processes employe^ in Kashmir and Gändhära. Freshly-dyedgarments were often bleached by Jong exposure to the sun, and encasinga garment in ice had a similar effect. On some of the dyeing techniquesemployed in ancient India, see Jätaka no. 38; Asanga, MahäyänasangrahaI, 18, pp 36-37.*Karmasiddhitikä, p 206, 3, 4.**Ibid, p 206, 3,-2?"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action 13514. In reply to a similar Sämmitiya argument in favor of external causes ofdestruction, Vasubandhu had already previously engaged in a rigorous in-vestigation of combustion (Kosa IV, ad 2-3)—an investigation which, likeso many of Vasubandhu's regarding natural phenomena, leaves us with themost un-rigid conclusion (\"Whatever you may say about it may be right,but isn't necessarily so\"). The SämmitJya supposes his argument, that inthe case of combustion, fire is the external cause for the destruction of thewood, to be self-evident, i.e. \"demonstrable through the means-of-cogni-tion of direct perception\". Vasubandhu however counters that actuallythere is nothing like \"a direct perception\" of the destruction of wood, justas there is no direct perception of motion. When we suppose that woodis being destroyed because of its relation with fire, it is simply because weno longer see the wood intact after such a relation. To go from the directperception of the disappearance of the wood to the assumption that fireis the external cause of the wood's destruction, involves an inference, andwhat's more, an inference which is not entirely fool-proof. Actually, Vasu-bandhu says, the fact that we no longer see the wood after its relation withfire is susceptible to two interpretations : either the wood is destroyed onaccount of the relationship, as the Sämmitiyas claim, or the wood is con-stantly changing within itself, and maintaining a certain continuity becauseof other factors within itself, which factors are transformed in proximitywith fire. Vasubandhu accuses the Sämmitiya of inconsistency, for theSämmitiya does admit that flames are destroyed spontaneously, and yeta gust of wind, conventionally speaking, may \"put out a flame\". To theSämmitiya, this means only that the wind has served as a catalyst for hasten-ing a process which would at any rate have come about. Vasubandhu saysthat analogously, the flame may only be a similar catalyst in regard to wood.He thinks that this alternative is not only just as possible as the other, buteven more likely, since the wood is not destroyed immediately when broughtinto contact with fire.Relating the same argumentation to the dyeing example, Vasubandhuwould argue that there is a constant series of modifications in the productsresulting from contact with fire, rather than the fire itself changing the pro-duct. We may symbolize the reactions as follows :WIND AND FLAMEInterpretation :W & F/ W, FX/  W & F/ W & F\"/ F/ F\"— — — — — XThere are an infinite number of conditions that may give rise to F, andXsome of them are clearly not dependent on anything external, but rather tochanges within the fire itself.

The cause of a cannot at the same time be the cause for the destructionof a. This axiom is traceable to the Vaisesika-sütras of Kanada, where itoccurs as fellows : \"A substance is not destroyed either by its effect or byits cause\" (Na dravyam käryarri käranam ca bädhati?\\ VS I, I, 12). Thisaxiom seems to have been accepted at large among Indian philosophic cir-cles. Kanada himself of course restricted it to substances, which are onlyone kind of entity within his system. He in fact supplies an answer to Vasu-bandhu's contention here (8a), thai sounds need no external cause of de-struction, by assuming that attributes like sound are destroyed by their effects,as well as by their causes. The first sound in a series of sounds is destroyedby its effect, i.e. the succeeding sound, but the last is destroyed by its cause,for the last sound but one destroys the last (the axiom \"Ubhayathä gunäh\",VS I, I, 13). Vasubandhu presented a refutation of Vaisesika-sfara I, I, 13at Kosa IV, ad 2-3, LVP, p 6, bottom, and is thus able to extend the axiomof VS I, I, 12 over the whole range of Vaisesika categories. In the casecited in this treatise, the destruction of a characteristic cannot occur on ac-count of the same causes which are responsible for its intensification.16. These are examples of what are termed \"homogeneous causes\" (sabhä-gahetu) in Vaibhäsika philosophy. This type of cause was fully acceptedby Vasubandhu {Kosa II, 52a-c). When a substance gradually gives rise"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  137to another substance, in such a manner that one can speak of a \"transform-ation of the original substance\", and no other external substance can berecruited to serve as an external cause for this transformation, Vasubandhuand the Vibhäsä speak of the original substance's being a \"homogeneouscause\" for the latter substance. The concept of \"homogeneous cause\"served to fill many gaps in causality which we nowadays explain by chemi-cal decomposition, or the intrusion of microbes. As regards the latterexample, Vasubandhu has perhaps the last card, since the growth of anorganism itself is termed by him an instance of homogeneous causation.The advantage of employing the concept of homogeneous causality in thisinstance lies in the fact that the continuity between the event at locus A andthe new event at locus B could be accounted for.17. The element wind being properly the mobile principle which expandsand displaces, its role as the principle of motion is recognized by both Vasu-bandhu and the Sauryodayika. Vasubandhu, who, as regards motion,carries a Heraclitean stand to a Parmenidean conclusion in this treatise,10, must of course modify the traditional viewpoint considerably. Forhim, calling the element wind the mobile principle can mean only that itis responsible for making a new event arise in another locus immediatelysubsequently to a previous event which is related to the new event by beingits homogeneous cause.Again we see that \"mental\" phenomena such as citta, and \"material\"elements such as \"wind\", are genetically related in such a manner as to makea dichotomy untenable. In Kosa IX (LVP, p 294, Pradhan, p 477, 1-2),Vasubandhu enumerates the processes taking place to give rise to a \"mani-fest bodily action\", as follows : A drive or impulse (chandas) is followedby an initial mental application (vitarka) towards an effort, which effort pro-duces a wind-series which in turn sets the body \"into motion *\\17a. \"beneficial\": kusala, \"unbeneficial\": akusala. Sometimes translatedas \"good\" and \"bad\". These are not very good translations, becausethe ultimate good of Buddhism is the eradication of suffering. Kusalaactions are those which have results and retributions conducive tothe eradication of suffering, akusala those which have results andretributions of suffering. Thus, kusala actions are productive of good,i.e. the alleviation of suffering. The caused good itself is always retri-butionally indeterminate. Thus Nirvana itself is so categorized, (cf.Dhammasangani 983, 989; C. Rhys-Davids Buddh. Psych., p 139.) TheKarmaprajnapti-sästra extends this principle even further, stating that thoughvolitions in meditation where one is not fully concentrated are kusala, voli-tions where one is completely collected and tranquil, are indeterminate.{Karmaprajnapti, Peking/Tokyo vol. 115, p 87, 2, 406: \"gzhan yang yongssu zin pa ma yin pas bstam gtan bzhi dang gzugs med pa bzhi bsgom pa'i,sems pa gang yin pa nas sems mngon par du byed pa dang yid kyi las kyibar du sbyar te 'di ni dge ba'i sems pa zhes bya'o—\". p 87, 5, 3-5: \"yongssu zin pa'i sems kyis bsam gtan bzhi dang gzugs med pa bzhi—'di ni lung duma bstan pa'i sems pa zhes bya'o//\" \"Furthermore, any volition—impellingof citta, and mental action of one who is cultivating the four meditations"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138   Seven Works of Vasubandhuand the four imageless attainments with cittas which are not completelycollected, is designated as a beneficial volition. Any volition—impelling,of citta, and mental action, of one who is cultivating the four meditations»,etc. with cittas completely collected, is designated as indeterminate.\")18. Configuration having been refuted as an entity, is manifest action to beaccounted for simply by the remaining visible quality, the \"moving\" colorcombinations which we see when we say \"I see him doing that\" ?Vasubandhu seems to be playing here, and relishing a series of totallyabsurd alternatives. A given color can clearly intrinsically be neitherbeneficial nor unbeneficial, as all meteriality is basically indeterminate (cf.Kosal, ad 29c-d, Kathävatthu V1II, 9).19. On the gradual shift of this term from being the honored epithet of theEmperor Asoka, to meaning something like \"simple fool\", see S. Levi, Jour-nal Asiatique 1891, p 549, and Bull. Ac. Roy. de Belgique, 1923, p 35 ff.The usage is common in Vasubandhu (cf. Kosa II, ad 26a-c), and also inSankara (Brahmasütrahhä$ya ad I, 2, 8; ad II 4, 5).20. The eye proper, i.e. the actual seeing part of the eye, is itself inferred,not seen, since according to the Vaibhäsika theory accepted by Vasubandhuit consists of an invisible sentient materiality covering what is convention-ally called \"the eye\". It is inferred through its force or efficacy of present-ing visibles to our citta-SQUQs (cf. Kosa I, ad 9). On this sentient mate-riality, see also Dhammasangani 616, 628, and Vibhanga 122.21. According to the Vibhäsä, the arising of an unmanifest action is not thesame in the three \"realms\"(see Discussion of the Five Aggregates, note 12).In the realm of desires, restraint or absence of restraint is always originatedby a manifest bodily or verbal action. In the states subsumed under \"therealm of images\", discipline is subordinated directly to citta. This cannotbe true in the realm of desires, since unmanifest action develops even whencittas are absent in sleep. Vasubandhu, in denying the real existence ofmanifest actions, i.e. bodily and verbal actions which themselves carry anethical and retributional nature, must also deny \"unmanifest action\" in therealm of desires. As a matter of fact, Vasubandhu had already lambastedthe entire Vaibhäsika concept of \"unmanifest action\"(Kosa IV, ad 3c).22. A bodily action may have a double ethical charge, which results in itsbeing indeterminate only inasmuch as its beneficiality and unbeneficialityare roughly equal. Because unmanifest action according to the Vaibhä-sikas is always either clearly beneficial or unbeneficial, it could never occurin connection with such a manifest action.According to Vasubandhu unmanifest action is also ruled out as an ex-planation of the unbeneficiality of an impure monk's remaining silent dur-ing the Pmtimoksa confessional, since for the Vaibhäsika to be consistent»he must here also assume a prior manifest action, which simply does notseem to occur in this case. Sanghabhadra attempts to defend the Vaibhä-sika position by noting that the very sitting down in an assembly hall forthe recital constitutes a previous manifest action (cf. Kosa IV, LVP,pp 163-164, n 5). This argumentation is feeble, because, as has been shown,unmanifest action cannot arise from actions which are indeterminate."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  139Vasubandhu would of course explain the unbeneficiality of the monk's silencesimply by the unbeneficiality of his volition to remain silent. If he remainssilent without such a motivation, e.g. if he has suddenly been struck dumb,there can be for Vasubandhu no question of a misdeed. Vasubandhu suc-ceeds here in giving a viable explanation for what determines the ethicalnature of a \"sin of omission\", where Sanghabhadra, in his attempt tobuttress the traditional Vaibhäsika structure, seems to singularly fail.23. The existence of past and future events is the cardinal doctrine of theold Sarvästiväda school, from which the Vaibhäsika is derived. It is criti-cized already by the Kathävatthu (I, 6-7), and defended against these criti-cisms by the snarling polemic of Devasarman, author of the Vijnänakäya{Vijnänakäya. tr. La Vallee Poussin, Etudes Asiatiques 1925, pp 343 ff).The Vibhäsä adopts the theory {Vibhäsä76, p 393b, tr. La Vallee Poussin,MCB V, pp 5 ff), and the genius of the \"Great Four Masters\" of the Vibhäsäwas enlisted to explain it. These philosophers are the Bhadanta Vasumitra,the Bhadanta Dharmaträta, Ghosaka, and Buddhadeva. All their theo-ries are rejected by Vasubandhu (Kosa ad V 25-28). The doctrine was againdefended against Vasubandhu by orthodox Vaibhäsikas such as Sangha-bhadra {Abhidharmanyäyänusära 50-52, MCB V, pp 75 ff) and the Dipakära{Abhidharmadipa V, 289-324, Jaini, pp 245 ff). The whole controversywas finally summarized by Säntaraksita, Tattvasangraha 1793-1806.24. The expression \"pustule arising on top of a boil\" was a common Sans-krit idiom at the time of Vasubandhu. It is found also in Kälidäsa, Säkun-tala Act II, opening speech of the Vidüsaka : \"Tato gandasyöpari pindakaksaipvrttah.\" The idiom is used to express the idea of additional troubleswhere troubles enough already abide. In this case, the troubles are thepoor Vaibhäsika's.25. The process for the retribution of an act can be reduced, Vasubandhusays, either to a special transformation within the series of momentary eventsmaking up the aggregates of the \"personality\", or to a change in the state{avasthä) of the act itself. The Bhadanta Vasumitra had reduced the dif-ferences among events in the three times to differences in their states, or modesof being (cf. Vibhäsä 76, 11: Melanges 5: 1 ff). That is to say, a presentevent has a full efficacy range, and is able to give rise to visual, etc. objects-ofjconsciousness, whereas a past event, though existent, can only be remem-bered, and a future event only anticipated. As the Vibhäsä itself hada clear preference for Vasumitra's explanation of the doctrine, theVaibhäsikas, who took it as their cardinal text, followed suit. Theretribution of an act, following Vasumitra, would be explained byassuming that an act, though it loses its full efficacy-range as soon asit is past, continues to exist, and finally undergoes an additional changein its state, which allows it to give its retributional effect.The Vaibhäsika vocabulary employed here involves some technicalities:An act \"projects\" an effect as long as it is present, but it \"gives\" its retri-butional effect when it is already past. The connection of the act withthe aggregate-series is explained by the Vaibhäsikas through präptis—seeDiscussion of the Five Aggregates, p. 70 note 16."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140   Seven Works of VasubandhuVasubandhu says that the Vaibhäsika explanation, violates Aggregates,note 16. :Vasubandhu says that the Vaibhäsika explanation, alternative 2, violatesthe principle of the momentariness of all events. This principle, is curi-ously enough, accepted by the Vaibhäsika as much as it is by the Sauträn-tika. Vasubandhu's argument is however not a valid criticism of the Vai-bhäsika, given the Vaibhäsika's framework. Vasubandhu is quick to recog-nize this himself, as he has the Vaibhäsika reply with the proper Vaibhä-sika view of momentariness. Though in its \"own-characteristics\" an eventexists in the past as well as the future (since it can be remembered or anti-cipated with all its characteristics), it no longer has the power to \"project\"its full effect, as it cannot be perceived by consciousnesses I-V. And it isthis power, marking the event as a present phenomenon, which is momen-tary. When it ceases, we say that the event ceases, i.e. it has entered uponanother state of being.26. If the act is still around, what is it that keeps it from continuing effectssimilar to the effects it projected in its moment as a present event ? Inwhat sort of \"cold storage\" are we to assume the act to be ?27. The last moment of \"one\" who has eradicated all the root-afflictionsdoes not project an effect. That is, once \"such a person\" dies, her or hisphysio-psychic series is not resumed within another existence : in otherwords, \"she or he goes into Nirvana\".28. See Discussion of the Five Aggregates, note 29.29. \"The obtainment and development of an effect's seed\" is a metaphoricalexpression employed by Vasubandhu for the existence of latent impressionswithin the series which may produce a new effect. The concept of \"seeds\"developing within a physio-psychic series is used to illustrate the continuityof the series. \"PräptV serves much the same function for orthodox Vai-bhäsika philosophers (see Discussion of the Five Aggregates, note 18). Butwhereas Sanghabhadra and the DIpakära insist that präpti is a real entityapart from the series itself, it is recognized 'by Vasubandhu that his \"seed\"is only a metaphor for a force within entities constituting a \"series\" whichallows them to gradually undergo transformations (Kosa II, ad 36c-d). Moreexactly, \"a seed for an event\" means simply the psychophysical complexitself, when it is capable of producing this effect, either immediately or medi-ately, through a transformation in \"its own\" \"series\".By this botanical analogy, Vasubandhu is able to maintain an organic,dynamically changing universe.30. The view that a special event disassociated from citta is responsible foran act's retribution is, as Sumatislla tells us*, a speciality of the Sämmitiyasand Mahäsänghikas. The Kathävatthu, which already discusses and criti-cizes the theory, attributes it to the Sämmitiyas and the Andhakas (theMahäsänghikas of Andhra). There it is stated that according to the Säm-mitiyas and Andhakas, an event must be posited for the continuation ofretributional results even in those cases where the citta*series is interrupted,*Karmasiddhitikä, p 212, 5, 1."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  141Thus the citta-series itself cannot be responsible for retribution. The Kathä-vatthu counters that when mental processes are interrupted, the karmicprocess must by rights be broken off as well {Kathävatthu XV, 11).31. Vasubandhu asks how the,theory of \"the accumulation\" or \"theimperishable\" can explain memory. The problem of the retribution of acts isonly an aspect of the larger problem of the continuity of the psycho-physi-cal series. Thus any theory which explains retributions, but which cannotexplain this continuity in broader terms, must be rejected as inadequate.One of the main problems regarding the continuity of the physio-psychicalseries is the question of memory. As Sumatislla tells us*, the theory of \"theaccumulation\" or \"the imperishable\", cannot serve to account for memory,since an \"accumulation\", or \"the imperishable\", arises only, according tothe Sämmitiyas and Mahäsänghikas, with acts that are clearly beneficialor unbeneficial. The studying of a text, and the intitial perception of anobject-of-sense, which serve as root-causes for future memory regardingthe text or object, are however completely indeterminate acts. Thus, an\"accumulation\" or \"the imperishable\" cannot arise in those cases. Evenif it could, there would still remain the problem as to which moment pro-duces the \"accumulation\". Is it the moment of the initial perception ofthe object, the moment in which the memory arises, or yet some othermoment? Clearly none of these alternatives can explain the phenomenon.It is interesting to note that with all our so-called scientific knowledge,the factors of memory are still not really understood, though they have beenthe subject of psychological research since Hermann Ebbinghaus. Thelargely metaphorical solutions with which modern psychology has emerged,such as \"changes in the synapse taking place with vivid impressions\", \"in-crease in the size of synaptic knobs following such impressions\", thoughsupportable by electro-stimulatory experimentation, are no more adequateor inadequate than Vasubandhu's admittedly metaphorical solution of animpression-storing consciousness-substratum, (cf. Rosvold's \"Memory\",McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 1960, vol. 8,pp 216-223.)32. The question of what goes on in the highest meditation, \"the attainmentof the cessation of feelings and cognitions\", is one of the crucial problemsin the psychology of the Northern Abhidharma theorists. This will becomeapparent later in this treatise. Here the problem more specifically is thatthe theory of \"accumulation\", or \"the imperishable\", cannot account forthe re-emergence of the citta-series, since obviously no particular beneficialor unbeneficial action directly precedes this emergence.33. This is an argument by analogy. The idea seems to be that the conti-nuity of redness from flower to fruit does not depend on a special entity,so similarly the transformation from seed to retribution needs no specialentity either. This sort of Occam's Razor principle is employed often byVasubandhu against the Vaibhäsika categories in the Kosa. In addition,some amount of botanical experimentation seems to have been done in an*Ibid, p 213, 1."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142   Seven Works of Vasubandhuattempt to discover possible principles of continuity. Nonetheless, thisargument against \"accumulation\", or \" the imperishable\", seems to be theweakest of the three.34. The \"(mentally) constructed\" is the,lowest of three kinds of reality inVasubandhu* s later philosophy {Commentary on the Separation of the Mid-dle from Extremes, ad III 3b, Teaching of the Three Own-Beings, 1). Ithas sometimes been rendered as \"the imaginary\", but both its etymologyand its characterizations by Vasubandhu {Commentary on the Separationof the Middle from Extremes, ad III 12a; Teaching of the Three Own-Beings,4-5) do not support such a translation, though the ontological status of \"theimaginary\" in ordinary language may be close to that of the parikalpita.The \"parikalpita\" is literally \"the thoroughly constructed\", which cons-tricts consciousness into ever narrower grooves, and includes most notionsof \"common-sense\" reality. It is thus the result not so much of the \"imagi-nation\" condemned by some Western philosophers (e.g. Hobbes, or theRenaissance philosopher Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola in his Onthe Imagination), but rather on the very mental consciousness so praisedby these gentlemen, i.e. the mental consciousness in its capacity for fabri-cating abstract constructions of its own, which are subsequently taken fartoo seriously. Less abstract categorizations, in fact delimiting anything atall with strict separations, fall also within the scope of the constructed (SeeCommentary of the Separation of the Middle from Extremes, ad III 12a).Mental consciousness in its colorful image-building fantasizing aspect isnot in itself a danger to Vasubandhu, as it is to Gianfrancesco Pico dellaMirandola, otherwise Vasubandhu could hardly have been the great loverof Mahäyäna sütras he apparently was.35. The previous example of the dyed lemon flower's resulting in a dyedlemon-core is here being used to illustrate the theory of the transformation ofthe psycho-physical series without the intervention of an entity external to it.In fact, Vasubandhu uses a vocabulary which completely parallels his ex-ample, but which is difficult to carry over adequately into English. He usesthe verb 'penetrate' {paribhävayati) in order to express the volition's last-ing influence on the psycho-physical series, on the analogy of the liquidlac's penetrating the entire series of the lemon plant. This penetration, orinfluence, of the volition, results in a special force (he could as well havesaid \"seed\"), an alteration in the series which leads eventually to its owntransformation. For Vasubandhu, the only real retribution lies within thepsycho-physical series itself, and this is borne out by his famous argumentsin The Twenty Verses demonstrating the irrationality of assuming externalhells {Twenty Verses ad 3, 4).The transformation of the series theory perhaps does not really explainanything (how many schemata of modern physics, not to speak ofmodern psychology, might be accused of the same thing ?), but it does pre-sent a plausible way to patch the holes in the Buddhist karma theory acu-tely felt by the North Indian scholasticists. In the last analysis, Vasubandhuwill abandon it anyway, since it is obviously a constructed structure {Teachingof the Three Own-Beings, 3-4)."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  14336. A directly antecedent condition {samanantara-pratyaya) is any conditionwhich helps give rise to an event which is similar to it, and which followson it immediately {Kosa II, ad 62a-b). The motivating dispositions whicharise immediately previous to a consciousness are by necessity its directlyantecedent conditions, since they not only help give rise to the conscious-ness, but its very nature, whereas the eye, for a visual consciousness,is only its substratum, since it does not condition the emotional nature ofthe consciousness. As regards a mental consciousness, its substrata arealways directly antecedent conditions, though again there may be directlyantecedent conditions which are not its substrata, namely the immediatelypreceding motivating dispositions {Kosa I, ad 44c-d). The term \"directlyantecedent condition\" is usually reserved for cittas and motivating disposi-tions only, though the Bhadanta Vasumitra was of the opinion that mate-riality-moments could also serve as such conditions {Kosa II, ad 62a-b, LaVallee Poussin, p 301).37. A mental consciousness cannot possibly arise where the material organsexist, but where their function does not give rise to a sensory citta. Hereis a passage which demonstrates just how misleading the translation \"mind\"for \"manas\" is. By \"manas\", Vasubandhu means here primarily a sensoryconsciousness which serves as a directly antecedent condition for a mentalconsciousness. During the attainment of cessation, such sensory con-sciousnesses are by necessity absent, since they are always concomitant withfeelings.38. If in states with both citta and materiality there is a seed for a manasresting on the material organs, and another resting upon the citta-series, thenmanas in these states results from two separate series of seed-moments.Yet two separate series of seed-moments are never found to exist for plantswhich have natural seeds. A given plant always results from one seed,not two.It might be argued that Vasubandhu is here making too much of themetaphor \"seed\". But the positing of a capacity for producing an identicalresult in two different kinds of entities, is actually somewhat puzzling. Theposition might be saved by assuming that the capacity for engendering acitta is relegated to the series of the material organs during the attainmentof cessation and is transferred back to the citta-series once the capacity isactualized. This would be a principle of \"vicarious functioning\", whichis accepted in similar contexts by modern physiological psychology (cf.D. C. Debb, Physiological Psychology, p 210).38a. See Discussion of the Five Aggregates, p 70. The attainment of the ab-sence of cognitions is characterized already by Vasumitra in his Prakarana-päda {Kosa II, La Vallee Poussin, p 200, note 2) as a meditation specialto non-Buddhist schools, and it is in fact mentioned in the Yogasütras ofPatanjali.39. Contrary to what Vasubandhu says, and contrary to Sumatisila's bestefforts to support his assertion*, it seems that this theory can explain there-*Karmasiddhi-tikä, p 214, 1."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"144   Seven Works of Vasubandhuemergence of the citta-series. The position is unacceptable to Vasubandhuas to Sahghabhadra, mainly because of their squeamishness toward accept-ing a basically non-sensate cause for a sensate result (for the materiality-series must certainly be non-sensate when there are no co-existent cittas).This is an example of the axiom discussed by Robinson in connection withconceptions of causality in Isvarakrsna, Nägärjuna, and Sankara : \"Thecause must be like its effects\". (\"Classical Indian Axiomatic\", PhilosophyEast and West XVII, 1967, axiom 6, p 150). But the interrelationship ofmaterial and psychic entities has been recognized in Buddhist psychologysince the Dhammasangani and the Jnänaprasthäna, and is in several in-stances admitted by Vasubandhu himself (see note 17). If a sensate cittawith volition can give rise to a non-sensate wind, as Vasubandhu says inKosa IX, it is difficult to see why the process in reverse should be unaccept-able to him.40. In the Chinese translation of Hsüan-tsang, this citta supposed by theBhadanta Vasumitra to exist within the attainment of cessation is qualifiedas a \"subtle citta\". The theory of a subtle citta existing within this attain-ment is alluded to also by Asanga {Mahäyänasafigraha I, 53). Vasubandhugives the same passage from the Bhadanta Vasumitra's Pariprcchä at KosaII, ad 44d.The Pariprcchä itself is unfortunately lost. As the Great Master Vasu-mitra of the Vibhäsä is most often referred to as \"the Bhadanta Vasumitra\"(cf. Sanghabhadra, Nyäyänusära, MCB V, p 91; Vibhäsä, Ibid, pp 166-167), it is most likely that he is identical with the author of the Pariprcchä.La Vallee Poussin(/foitf Introduction, pp XLIV-XLV) and Lamotte (\"Traitede l'Acte\", n. 11) assume otherwise, but their reasoning does not seem tobe based on certain grounds. On the other hand, Lin Li Kuang's thesisthat there is only one ancient master Vasumitra, and that he was responsiblefor the theory of \"mahäbhümikas\", motivating dispositions accompanyingevery citta, seems insupportable by the internal evidence of the texts involved.{U Aide-Memoir e de la Vraie Lot, pp 48-49).The following texts are attributed to a Vasumitra : the Prakaranapäda(Taisho 1541, 1542), the Dhätukäya (Taisho 1540), both among the six basictexts of Sarvästiväda Abhidharma; the Sangltisästra (Taisho 1549), the Pah-cavastuka (Taisho 1556 and 1557), the lost Pariprcchä, and the Samayabhedo-paracanacakra (Taisho 2031, 2032; Peking-Otani 5639, tr. A. Bareau,Journal Asiatique 1954, pp 229 fif). There is in addition a commentary onVasubandhu's Kosa of an obviously later date. Now it is true that 4hePrakaranapäda and the Dhätukäya contain the earliest-known mention ofthe \"mahäbhümikas\", and the Sangltisästra is apparently also in conso-nance with the theory (cf. La Vallee Poussin, Kosa Introduction, p XLIV).But the motivating disposition list of the Pancavastuka is conspicuous byits absence of any arrangement which would fit the mahäbhümika-pattern.In the first set of motivating dispositions given in the Pancavastuka, thereare listed many of the moment-events which are considered mahäbhümikasby the Prakaranapäda. Yet within this same set there is \"carelessness\"(pramäda) and \"absence of careless ness\" {apramäda), which are difficult to"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  145imagine as being concomitant in any citta, not to speak of every citta (Taisho1556, vol. 28, p 995, 3, 10-11). The term \"mahäbhümika,' itself nowhereoccurs in the Paneavastuka. It occurs only in the Pahcavastuka-vibhäsä,a commentary on the text by Dharmaträta (Taisho 1555, vol. 28, p 994, 2,3-4), who seems to be inspired in his ordering of the motivating dispositionsprimarily by Ghösaka (cf. Abhidharmämrta, p 66, 12). The whole ques-tion of whether there are motivating dispositions separable fromcittas, andthe problem of whether there are mahäbhümikas, were two issues on whichthere was much individual disagreement, as might be expected from thevery nature of sudh an emotional topic ! It is highly unlikely that the pro-bable originator of4 the mahäbhümika-theory in the Prakaranapäda wouldhave so completely ignored the entire concept while discussing the motivat-ing dispositions in the Paneavastuka. The theory of one Vasumitra is alsocontradicted by the fact that the Sangitisästra, though discussing the exis-tence of past and future events, explains it in a manner quite different fromthe Bhadanta Vasumitra's famous theory of \"states\" discussed in the Vi-bhäsä (Sangitisästra, chapt. 13, cf. La Vallee Poussin, Kosa Introduction,p XLIV), and that one Vasumitra quoted in the Vibhäsä (152, 1, Ibid)(not necessarily the Bhadanta Vasumitra as assumed by La Vallee Poussin),clearly denies the existence of cittas in the attainment of cessation, whichroundly contradicts the Pariprcchä. Tradition is also uniform in distin-guishing three Vasumitras: the author of the Prakaranapäda and Dhätu-käya, the Bhadanta Vasumitra of the Vibhäsä, and the author of the Samaya-bhedoparacanacakra, who is identical with the Kosa commentator, andsaid to be a contemporary of Candrakirti (sixth century, Täranätha I, p 68,p 174). Yasomitra also gives some valuable information. He says thatthe Bhadanta Vasumitra wrote not only the Pariprcchä, but also thePaneavastuka and other treatises. (Yasomitra, Vyäkhyä, ad II 44). Thisseems plausible, as the Paneavastuka's ordering of the motivating disposi-tions and the Pariprcchä's theory of a subtle citta both have at least thisin common: they are inimical to the mahäbhümika-theory of the Prakarana-päda, Dhätukäya, and Sangitisästra.The quasi-canonical character of the Prakaranapäda and the Dhätukäyafor the Vibhäsä indicates that these are in all probability works of an ear-lier era. The statements of the Bhadanta Vasumitra, on the other hand,though usually highly respected by the Vibhäsä, have hardly this kind ofstatus there. Following the internal evidence and the traditional accounts,we thus arrive at three Vasumitras: (1) the old Vasumitra, author of thePrakaranapäda, of the Dhätukäya, and, in all probability, of the Sangiti-sästra, the probable originator of the mahäbhümika-theory; (2) the Bha-danta Vasumitra, author of the Pariprcchä and the Paneavastuka, opposedto the mahäbhümika-theory, upholder of a subtle citta, forger of the mostaccepted theory regarding past and future events, cautioner of dogmatists,one of the \"Great Masters\" of the Vibhäsä, and, from all we can tell, a trulygreat'philosopher; (3) the later Vasumitra, author of a commentary onthe Kosa and the Samayabhedoparacanacakra.According to traditional accounts, the four great masters Ghosaka, Bud-"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146   Seven Works of Vasubandhudhadeva, the Bhadanta Vasumitra, and the Bhadanta Dharmaträta werecontemporaries, and all had a hand in the rough draft of that tremendousteam-work compilation, the Vibhäsä, at the council of the Emperor Kani-ska. In spite of their philosophical differences (which become quite appa-rent in this treatise), Ghosaka and the Bhadanta Vasumitra apparentlyremained on good terms, and after the death of Kaniska, went together tolive in the country of Asmäparäntaka, at the invitation of the king of thatcountry {Kosa, La Vallee Poussin, introduction, p XLIV; Abhidhannämrtaintroduction, p 1).By the way, the Dharmaträta who commented on the Pancavastuka wasapparently an uncle of the Bhadanta Vasumitra's. He was a strict Sarväs-tivädin attempting a harmonization between the theories of Ghosaka andhis nephew, and was also responsible for the Samyuktäbhidharmasära (Tai-sho 1552), an elaboration of the work of DharmasrI. He is to be distin-guished from that great maverick, the Bhadanta Dharmaträta, whom in facthe criticizes by name in the Saniyuktäbhidharmasära. (On this point, andon the philosophies of the two Dharmaträtas, Lin Li Kuang is quiteconvincing, cf. L'Aide-Memoire9 pp 315-342.)41. This is identical to the rebuttal to the Bhadanta Vasumitra's thesisgiven in Kosa II, ad 44d, which is there attributed to the great Ghosaka. Thenecessary connection of a mental consciousness with contact, feelings, andcognitions is of course an irreversible axiom to this upholder of the mahä-bhümikas. At Abhidharmämrta p 66, 12, Ghosaka says: \"Feeling, cogni-tion, contact, volition, mental attention, zest, mental application, memory,concentration, and discernment are the ten mahäbhümikas. And for whatreason is this ? Because they arise together with every citta.\" (\"Vedanäsanjnä sparsas cetanä manaskärah chandah adhimuktih smrtih samädhihprajfiä ity ete dasa mahäbhümikä dharmäh. Tat kasya hetoh ? Sarva-citta-sahötpädät\"). For Ghosaka, the attainment of cessation cannot bereduced to a citta of any kind, since the cessation is that of cognitions andfeelings.42. This argument is again attributed to the Bhadanta Vasumitra in theKosa (II, ad 44 d).43. Western translators of Buddhist texts have not usually given muchattention to the various characterizations of mental and physical states tradi-tional in abhidharma. This is unfortunate, for the whole basis of Buddhistethical theory has been misunderstood thereby, and as a result there havebeen many erroneous conceptions of Buddhism: that it is anti-sensual, thatit is necessarily anti-passion, that it basically considers all mundane exis-tence evil, and so forth. Actually, a careful examination of the employ-ment of terms used in Abhidharma ethical theory, as well as attention totheir true etymological meaning, will destroy many of these misconceptions,which have arisen in part due to the incredibly arbitrary translations whichhave become \"standard\" among certain translators. As an example, \"klesa\"has never meant, either in Sanskrit or for any people in direct contact withIndian masters, \"defilemement\", as it is usually translated. The Sanskritroot \"kit's\" means \"to be afflicted, to be tormented, to suffer\", and a klesa"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  147is accordingly \"an affliction, pain, anguish, suffering\". In Tibetan, theterm \"klesa\" has been rendered by \"nyon mongs pa\", which means \"misery,trouble, distress\" as well as \"to be afflicted\", as in the expression \"tsha hasnyon mongs te\\\" \"to be molested by the heat\" (Sarat Candra Das, p 489).In Chinese, it is rendered by both Paramärtha and Hsuan-tsang by twocharacters which mean \"to be troubled, vexed, grieved, irritated, distressed\"(Matthews, characters no. 1789 and 4635), which together regularly mean\"vexed\", \"vexation\". Why therefore introduce into English a basicallymeaningless word such as \"defilement,\" which in conjuring up all sorts ofangry God, original sin, and \"man is defiled\" complexes, is not only etymo-logically indefensible, but also, for the twentieth century, rotten \"means\"(see Introduction to the Commentary on the Separation of the Middle fromExtremes, p 194) ? There is a good word in English which is in consonancewith basic life needs as well as, which goes without saying, the Four NobleTruths. Here \"klesa\" is translated as \"affliction\", and the adjective \"kli-sta\" as \"afflicted\".We have seen Vasubandhu's list of afflictions in the Discussion of the FiveAggregates, p 92, p 94. But there is considerable variation in what mentalstates are included within the afflictions among Abhidharma writers, andVasubandhu himself changes \"his\" \"mind\" on what motivating dispositionsto include there. At Kosa II, ad 26-28, Vasubandhu had accepted the Vi-bhäscts list of klesa-mahäbhümikas, those which make all other afflictionspossible. These are confusion, carelessness, sloth, lack of faith, slackness,and excitedness. In The Commentary on the Separation of the Middle fromExtremes, Vasubandhu lists complacency, aversion, pride, ignorance, views,adherence to mere rules and rituals, doubt, envy, and selfishness as \"obstruc-tions which are afflictions\" (ad II2-3 a). Later he reduces the afflictionsagain to the six he had accepted in A Discussion of the Five Aggre*gates (Thirty Verses, 11). To show the extreme examples of the disagree-ment in Abhidharma concerning the afflictions, Dharmatrata the Sarväs-tivädin in his Samyuktäbhidharmasära has fifteen fundamental afflictions(Lin Li Kuang, p 49), whereas the Bhadanta Dharmatrata says that all afflic-tions are nothing but unbeneficial volitions, and that there are in fact no\"events associated with citta\" apart from feelings, cognitions, and volitions(Lin Li Kuang, p 47).To clarify some often confused concepts : Afflicted states are \"bad\",being suffering, but are not necessarily unbeneficial (i.e. \"bad\" in the senseof ethically reprehensible). There is an entire category of factors whichare categorized as afflicted, but which are ethically beneficial (the kusala-säsravas), and another which is similarly afflicted, but ethically indeterminate(the nivrtävyäkrtas, \"obstructed but indeterminate events\"). For instance,attachment may sometimes be beneficial, and doubts, remorse, and aver«sion, though afflicted, may have good results. Similarly, any afflicted statewhich has come about as a result of retribution is by necessity indetermi-nate (\"obstructed but indeterminate\"), since anything which is retributionitself carries no further retribution. (A very just credo which leaves every-body an opening for escape from suffering.) The term \"afflicted\" is some-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148Seven Works of Vasubandhuwhat broader than that of \"affliction\", since an affliction is that basic kindof mental suffering which involves adjunct sufferings. Thus, the \"obstruct-ed but indeterminate\" events are afflicted, but not afflictions. An afflic-tion itself must always arise from a volition, an impulse, and a discrimina-tion^*^ IX, LVP, p 294; Pradhan, p 477, 1-2). Furthermore, the terms\"obstructed\" and \"afflicted\", synonymous in older Abhidharma (though inMahäyäna there are obstructions which are not afflictions, see Commentaryon the Separation of the Middle from Extremes, ad II 1), are often equatedto \"connected with distress\" (säsrava). However, as Yasomitra says, thelast term is actually used in a much broader sense, to mean any state wherebasic afflictions may attach themselves. (Vyäkhyä ad I, 4b). Further prin-ciples : Whatever arises from a mental construction is never indeterminate,and whatever arises from an impulse is never retribution. Combining the\"ethically good and bad\" (beneficial-unbeneficial) with the \"instrinsicallygood and bad\" (afflicted-unafflicted), we arrive at the following divisions :[entailing retribution]afflicte d[free from retribution] 3.r [entailing retribution] 4.unafflicted* [free from retribution] 5.L  6.unbeneficial (akusala) Ubeneficial but connected with afflic-tions or liable to be so connected(kusalasäsrava) Bobstructed but indeterminate(nivrtävyäkrta) Ifirst states free from affliction(prathamänäsrava) Bunobstructed but indeterminate(anivrtävyäkrta) Ilast states free from afflictions /(antänäsrava or simply anäsrava)B : beneficial; U : unbeneficial; / : indeterminateThe Koia's (II, ad 7-19; II ad 30a-b; II, ad 60-61; IV, ad 8; IV, ad 127) cate-gorization of the twenty-two faculties into these groups will show the subt-lety of the entire ethical structure :the Eye I S r Ithe Ear I S r Ithe Nose I S r Ithe Tongue I S r Ithe Tactile Body I S r Ithe Consciousnesses I E r @ (Masculinity I S r /Femininity I S r /Life-Force S R r IPleasure ( R ISuffering S(-R UCheerfulness ( R @Depression S ( (or X)Equanimity E R @Faith and Vigor E X BMindfulness,1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15-16.17-19.FacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyFacultyofofofofofofofofofofofofofofFaculties ofFaculties>of"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  149Concentration, and Insight E, X B20-22.

The three roots of the beneficial are, as we have seen in A Discussionof the Five Aggregates p 66, lack of greed, lack ofhositility, and lack of con-fusion, (cf. also Kosa II, ad 25-26 c.) They are those motivating dispositionswhich make all other beneficial ones possible. By necessity, they involvecontact with an object-of-consciousness, and consequently involve feelings andcognitions, as motivating dispositions depend on conscious volitions to bebeneficial. In other words, \"lack of greed\" occurring in the attainmentof cessation is hot lack of greed as a root of the beneficial, because no choicecan arise there, due to the absence of contact with a specific object-of-con-sciousness. In the absence of such choice, and in the absence of consciously-.conceived roots of the beneficial, there can be no beneficial citta.This same argument is employed by Vasubandhu in his Mahäyänasan-grahabhäsya (ad I, 54, Peking/Tokyo Tibetan Tnpitaka vol. 112, p 282, 2-4).It is an independent argument there, not found in any developed form inAsanga's Mahäy änasangraha itself. The fact that most of these indepen-dent arguments in the first chapter of this commentary show such closeaffinities to this treatise seems to rule against Frauwallner's \"last-ditch\"effort to save his fabrication of «the two great Vasubandhus\" (i.e. that theKosa, the Demonstration of Action, and the Thirty Verses are indeed by oneVasubandhu, but that only the Mahäyäna commentaries are by Asanga'sbrother).44a. Final cessation is actually indeterminate (since nothing results from it)and is beneficial only in the sense of a beneficial goal. (See notö 17a.)45.

(See Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Ex-tremes, ad I 10 and 11, and note 7 to that text.)  \\46. Afflictions presuppose the existence of feelings, cognitions, and certainother motivating dispositions, as they always arise from an impulse anci adiscrimination (Kosa IX, Pradhan, p 477, 1-2). Thus there can be no afflic-tions without contact with an object-of-consciousness.47. Even the attainment of the absence of cognitions praised byPatanjaliis beneficial, so one would think that the attainment of cessation practisedby Buddhists is even more so.48. Only these four types of citta are traditionally regarded as unobstructed-but-indeterminate by the Vibhäsä-inspired philosophies. Anything bornof retribution, as well as retribution itself, is by necessity indeterminate(cf. note 43), and cittas connected with artistic or professional activity, andwith postures of the body such as sitting, lying, and standing, are of coursealso indeterminate and unafflicted. The last category is somewhat moreproblematical. It seems to refer to any citta which produces pure fantasies,which beholds a magical creation, or which deals with after-images in medi-tation. An artist's preconception of his creation, on the other hand, seemsto belong to the category of \"cittas related to artistic or professional acti-vity\" (cf. Kosa II, ad 71b-72).Vasubandhu gives his argumentation a somewhat different twist in theMahäyänasangrahabhäsya. He dismisses beneficial and unbeneficial cittas,and cittas related to postures, professional activity, and mental creations,in the same manner as here. But he leaves a possibility open for the \"bornof retribution\" category. He says that it would be possible to call the attain-ment of cessation indeterminate qua \"born of retribution\", but that onlythe store-consciousness, of all consciousnesses, can be indeterminate in thissense {Mahäyänasangrahabhäsya ad I, 54, Peking/Tokyo Tibetan Tripitakavol. 112, p 282, 4, 5). The arguments raised in this treatise against aretributional mental consciousness existing directly subsequent to theattainment of cessation would of course still he1!.49. The attainment of cessation is reached only at er one has passed throughthe four basic meditations and the four other imageless attainments (SeeDiscussion of the Five Aggregates, p 56, p 70). One of the objects of medi-tation being to sever afflicted cittas which are retributional, it is held thatall mental retributional consciousness will be severed by the practise ofthese meditations.50. The citta which occurs immediately after the attainment of cessationhas been completed, must; be completely without agitation. \"Utter non-agitation\" is a mark of the fourth meditational state (cf. Kosa III, LVP,px216; Kosa IV, ad 46; Kosa VIII, ad 26).51. The nine attainments of successive stages are the four basic meditationsand the five imageless meditational attainments. The eight deliverancesare preparative stages to the imageless attainments, plus these attainmentsthemselves. The preparatives are listed as :"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  151\"oneself containing visible forms, one sees visibles\" (rüpi rüpänipasyati)\"not being aware of inner visible forms, one focuses on outwardvisibles\" {adhyätman arüpa-samjiii bahirddhä rüpäni pasyati)\"one becomes intent on what is lovely\" (subham ity eva adhimuktobhavati)52. The KarmapräjnaptV s solution is to make these completely concentratedmeditational cittas indeterminate (cf. note 17 a). This is indeed anotherway out, which Vasubandhu, in spite of his apparent sympathies with thetreatise, rejects here.52a. In spite of his own great contributions to Indian logic, which are appa-rent in A Method for Argumentation, people who rely on dialectics only are notfor Vasubandhu in a very exalted category. In his chapter on \"realities'*in the Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes, he re-cognizes arguments based on logical principles as belonging to a specialkind of reality which has validity while playing a certain kind of dialecticians'game (ad III, 12). But here, as well as later in the Twenty Verses, actualinsight into ultimate realities cannot be provided by any amount of reason-ing alone. As a writer of treatises, Vasubandhu wishes his arguments to bebased on logical principles, but he recognizes logic as more than inadequatewhen dealing with ultimate insights. He labels himself as a dialecticianin Twenty Verses, ad 22a, and there clearly states that ultimate reality isnot within the range of dialectics. Here in the Discussion for the Demon-stration of Action, Vasubandhu uses the term \"dialectician\" almost as a jeer.This is reminiscent of the Lankävatära-sütra, where dialecticians are con-stantly being lambasted. A bit of the same spirit can be found also in Asanga{Mahäyänasangraha X, 3 end).53. Some, like the Bhadanta Vasumitra, say the attainment of cessation isendowed with citta; others, like Ghosaka, say it is not. Yet they both appa-rently refer to the same state. Some way must be found to account for thediscrepancy (cf. Abhidharmadipa II, 126, p 149).54. Impression: impregnation: augmentation of the seeds: the initial pointof the transformation of the series, particularly that induced by past voli-tions and other experiences. Yasomitra calls \"impression\" a synonym for\"seed\" (cf. Jaini, Dipa, p 109), but, following Asanga, we may regard itas the process of everything in past experience entering the consciousness-stream to help in its transformation (Asanga, Mahäyänasangraha1, 18).55. This verse is ascribed to Asvaghosa by Sumatisfla, Karmasiddhitikä, p 217,2. So perhaps there is something to the Chinese tradition that Asvaghosawas a proto-Yogäcärin, and responsible for treatises like The Awakening ofthe Mahäyäna Faith !56. The Sanskrit for this verse is given by Sthiramati in his Trimsikäbhäsyayp. 34 :\"Ädäna-vijnäna gambhlra-süksmoogho yathä vartati sarva-bijo/"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152   Seven Works of Vasubandhubäläna eso mayi na prakäsimä haiva ätmä parikalpayeyuh //\"Yasubandhu's citation of the Sandhinümocana-sütra is of great interest forseveral reasons. For one thing, it clearly contradicts Lamotte's thesis thatthe Discussion for the Demonstration of Action was written at a time priorto Yasubandhu's conversion to Mahäyäna (as do also the closing versesof the treatise, with their beautiful Mahäyäna transferral of merit senti-ments). It leaves little doubt that Vasubandhu has been holding back onMahäyäna vocabulary with the intention of leading his old Vaibhäsikaopponents on as far as possible with arguments they more or less have toaccept, in order to finally bombard them with the conclusion that only theYogäcära conception of consciousness can completely fill the holes in thekarma theory. We may regard this entire treatise as a preliminary to themore profound Yogäcära insights, which is directed at the Vaibhäsikas andSauträntikas who could by this means be forced to a recognition of the in-nate worth of Yogäcära, and thus be lured to further writings of the school.In Asanga's Mahäyänasangraha, the consciousness-theory is preliminaryto the teaching of the three natures and their realization, the true heart ofhis and Vasubandhu's Yogäcära. (Mahäyänasangraha I, II, and III, especi-ally III, 9). In Vasubandhu's works, we find the same movement in theTwenty Verses, Thirty Verses, and the Teaching of the Three Own-Beingsincluded here.The Sandhinirmocana is of course not a sütra which is accepted by the^Vaibhäsikas. But if the Vaibhäsika can cry, \"This is not authoritativescripture.\" Vasubandhu can counter that neither should the Vibhäsä andits beloved Abhidharma \"padas\" be regarded as such, since they are clearlynot thewords of the Buddha. Orthodox Vaibhäsikas, such as the Dipakära,retort that the Abhidharma serves only to interpret the sütras, andfurthermore, that these Abhidharma interpretations must be taken as \"higher\"than any sütras which comtradict them, since sütras can be conventional{aupacärika), i.e. conditioned by the exigencies of expedient methods (DipaII, ad 138-139, pp 98-104; IV, ad 185, p 146; VIII, ad 548, p 410). Thethesis that Abhidharma interpretations must be taken above sütras in con-tradiction with them is \"old hat\" in Buddhist schools that evolved Abhi-dharma : already in the Vibhanga, there are interpretations conformableto the sütras (suttabhäjaniya) and interpretations conformable to the Abhi-dhaxm<i{abhidhammabhäjamyä), and the latter always take precedence incase of any conflict between the two. A whole body of Buddhist teachershowever objected : these are the \"Sauträntikas\", \"those who look to thesütras as the final end of the Buddha's teaching.\" Vasubandhu of coursebelongs to this tradition at the inception of his writing career. Thoughhis slashing at Vaibhäsika categories is perhaps the most thoroughgoingone, he had predecessors in this field—certainly the Bhadanta Dharmaträta,and presumably the \"müläcärya\" of the Sauträntikas, Kumäraläta.The question of what is to be considered canonical was raised almost atthe inception of Buddhism. Because of the absence of a sacerdotal hierarchy"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  153and an initial lack of codified collections of texts, and due to the factthat many of the farflung Buddhist communities became quite isolated from oneanother, divergences in doctrine naturally arose. The Buddha himself hadalready given means by which to test the authenticity of scripture. If aman came with something he claimed the Buddha had said, the communitywas to compare it to what stood in the sütras and the Vinaya they had receiv-ed, and if it did not conform to them, it was not to be accepted (Digha II,124). In this analysis, it was the spirit rather than the letter which countedmost. Thus the Nettipakarana says of this passage: \"With which sütrashould one confront these texts or untterances ? With the Four NobleTruths. With which Vinaya should one compare them ? With any Vinayawhich leads one away from greed, hostility, and confusion. With whichDharma should one test them ? With dependent origination.\"(\"Katamas-mih sutte oiäretabbäni ? Catüsu ariyasattesu. Katamasmin vinaye samdas-sayitabbäni ? Rägavinaye dosavinaye mohavinaye.

Thus therecame to be admitted into several ancient Canons sütras which were recog-nized as being post-Buddha (e.g. Majjhima II, 83 ff; Majjhima II, 57;Majjhima III, 7, and Anguttara III, 57 ff, composed under King Munda).Collections of scriptures were accepted as sütras in certain schools whichnever had this status in others (such as the Dhammapada and the Jätakas,challenged as late as the fifth century by teachers such as Sudinna Thera, cf.Buddhaghosa's Sumangalaviläsini II, p 566, and Manoräthapürani III,P 159).The case for the Vaibhäsikas is somewhat weakened by the fact that theVibhäsä itself admits that there are many valid sütras which are not includ-ed in its Canon, \"because they have been lost\" (Vibhäsä 16, p 79 b, quotedLamotte, \"La critique d'authenticite dans le Bouddhisme\", India Antiqua,p 218). It also says that many \"false sütras\", \"false Vinayas\" and \"falseAbhidharmas\" have been incorporated into many Canon collections (185,p 925c. Ibid). The problem is further compounded by the Vibhäsä's recog-nition that certain sütras are to be taken literally (nitärtha), whereas othersmust be further interpreted (neyärtha) (cf. Lamotte, \"La critique d'inter-pretation dans le Bouddhisme\", Ammaire de VInstitut de philologie et d'his-toire Orientales et slaves, IX, 1949, p 349 ff). According to traditional ac-counts, the Second Buddhist Council, at Vaisäli, had already upheld such adistinction in 383 B.C. (Ibid, p 351).From the Mahäyäna side, reasons for accepting the Mahäyäna sütraswere given by several authors. A cardinal text supporting giving theirrevelations, or if you will their forgeries, the status of authoritative scripturewas the Adhyäsrayasarneodana-sütra, which said that everything which iswell-spoken can be said to be the word of the Buddha (cf. Snellgrove,BSOAS ^XI, 1958, pp 620-623, on this sütra's re-interpretation of the famoussaying of Asoka : \"E keci bharnte bhagavatä Buddhena bhäsite save sesubhäsite vä.\") A defense of the Mahäyäna sütras is given by Säntideva{Siksäsamuccaya, B, p 15, V, p 12) and Prajnäkaramati (Bodhicaryävatära-pafijikä IX, 43-44, V, p 205) on the perhaps not unassailable grounds that"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154   Seven Works of Vasubandhutheir inspiration and root-purpose is the same as those of other sütras. Pra-jnäkaramati further says that in the face of so many dissensions even amongthe \"HInayänists\", it is difficult to see how any one transmission of sütrascan be regarded as Ägama. Haribhadra in his Abhisamayälankärälokagoes one further, saying that anyone who attempts to do so must be regard-ed as a fool. (Tucci ed, pp 260-261; Wogihara ed, pp 400-401; Vaidyaed., p 402).57. The residues (anusaya) are traces left by past afflictions, and thus also\"proclivities\" towards further unbeneficial action. The Vaibhäsika, withhis theory of the existence of the past and future, regards \"anusaya\" and\"Klesa\" as synonymous, a view Vasubandhu had combatted already atKosa V, ad 1 ff. (See also Jaini, \"The Sauträntika Theory of Bija\", andDipa introduction, pp 103-107, and Kathävatlhu XIV, 5.)58. Any saint not liable to return to Samsära, who may however, incontrast to the Arhat, be re-born into god-realms.59. The Tämraparniyas are the Theravädins of Ceylon. They are onlysporadically mentioned in Vaibhäsika and Mahäyäna works. \"The islandTämraparni\" is a name for Ceylon at least since the days of King Iksväku.Virapurusadatta, whose Nägärjunikonda inscription mentions it by thatname (c. 200 A.D.). \"The Tämraparna\" is however properly the Tinne-velly region of the Pändya Kingdom, which is incidentally also mentionedin the same inscription. However, at this time, Theraväda seems to havebeen one of the dominant sects of this area as well, as both Buddhaghosaand Buddhadatta claim it as their home (see Law, Buddhaghosa).60. The bhavägravijnäna, \"consciousness which is the requisite of exis-tence\", is indeed a particularly Theraväda conception, which goes back tothe Patthäna (1, 1, 3, B I, p 138; 6, 7, 81, 4, B, II, p 54; 7, 7, 23, B II;p. 121). It is a substratum underlying the six consciousnesses, which, thoughit is also a series of moment-events, does not undergo much change. Itis not entirely subconscious, as it consists of cittas which may at timespenetrate to the sixth consciousness. However, it may exist entirelywithout initial mental application and subsequent discursive thought, andexists in the highest meditational attainments, as well as in dreamlesssleep. It may be said to be nothing but the six consciousnesses in anunactive state.This substratum is accepted by Buddhaghosa, who assumes for it a material1base (the \"hadayavatthu\", Visuddhimagga XIV, 458). Such a material base\\ may itself be deduced from certain passages in the Patthäna, though it ,doesnot mention the term \"hadayavatthu\" itself. Yasomitra (Vyäkhyä ad I, 17)\\alludes to the full-blown theory of a substratum with a material basis, andalso identifies it as a Tamraparniya doctrine.61. A similar argument, that it was the subtlety of the store-conscious-ness which prohibited the Buddha from teaching it to his early disciples,,is found also in Asanga, Mahäyänasangraha I, 10. As Sumatisila inter-prets it, the import of Vasubandhu's argument is however somewhat different.It is rather that the grouping together of events with such dissimilar charac-teristics would only serve to confuse the student of Buddhism. It was better"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"A Discussion For the Demonstration of Action  155to leave the store-consciousness out of the scheme for beginners (Karmasid-dhitikä, p 219, 1).62. This is a typically Mahäyäna argument, which must however havesome force for the followers of the Vibhäsä, which also admits that manysütras have been lost. Vasubandhu is here conceding that the Vaibhäsikasneed not recognize the Sandhinirmocana as an authentic sutra. His intel-lectual honesty here stands in some contrast to the approach of Asanga,who attempts to make the Vaibhäsikas admit the existence of the store-consciousness by claiming that it is mentioned in the Sarvästiväda Canon.This he does by wringing a meaning out of an Ekottarägama passage in amost arbitrary way (Mahäyänasangraha I, 13). This procedure seems tohave somewhat embarrassed Sthiramati, for though he mentions this argu-ment of Asanga's, he doesn't go into any details, and refuses to identifythe sütra (Trirnsikavijiiaptibhäsya, p 13, bottom).The Vyäkhyäyukti is a work of Vasubandhu's dealing with the historyof the formation of the Buddhist Canon.63. The store-consciousness conditions the evolving consciousnessesI-VI by coloring all their perceptions through its seeds; the evolving con-sciousnesses in turn alter'the store-consciousness through the process of\"impression\". Asanga says that, this mutual conditioning is not only reci-procal, but simultaneous, just as in the case of the arising of a flame andthe combustion of a wick (Mahäyänasangraha, I, 17).64. I do not understand how this statement of Vasubandhu's is veryapposite, unless an identity \"root\" and \"seed\" is urged on the grounds thatthe incipient roots are the locus of the developing seeds. The Vaibhäsikaargument, which is Sahghabhadra's, rests on the charge that \"seed\" is nota very good metaphor, since the original seed no longer exists when thefruit has developed. A seed, or even a seed-series, is not adequate to ex-plain the sudden retribution occurring for beneficial and unbeneficial actions.The cittas which are present at the time of the moment of retribution maythemselves be beneficial, where the retribution is one for an unbeneficialact. Thus the constant relation that exists in natural seeds, that such andsuch a seed results in such and such a fruit, does not seem to be in evidenceeither (Abhidharmanyäyänusära, chapt. 51, tr. LVP, MCB 4-5).65. The theory of self criticized here is probably that of the Vaisesikas,against which Vasubandhu had already directed his supplement to the Kosa(Kosa IX). It is nonetheless interesting to compare his critique here withSankara's argumentation in favor of an unchanging self, which is directedagainst the Yogäcärins (Brahmasütrabhäsya II, II 31). Sankara says thatthe Yogäcärins' store-consciousness cannot serve as a substratum for impres-sions, because it lacks fixity of nature, as it consists only of a series of momen-tary events. The store-consciousness is \"stable\", as Asanga tells us, onlyin the sense that it forms a continuous, never greatly altered series (Mahä-yänasafigraha I, 23). Thus it cannot be an abiding locus for these impre-ssions. Unless an abiding entity pervading the three times is assumed (orelse some conditioning agent which is immutable and omniscient), the pro-cesses of impression and memory cannot be explained."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156   Seven Works of VasubandhuHere is an instance where it is difficult to say who has the better \"argument.Sankara says that the lack of stability of the store-consciousness makes itinadequate as an explanation for our \"sense of continuity\". On the otherhand, Vasubandhu's argument touches on one of the fundamental difficultiesof Advaita-Vedänta: that it is impossible to relate an immutable entity to aworld of phenomena constantly changing.65a. Sumatisila tells the story as follows : \"There was a man namedVrjiputraka who, upon hearing the 251 rules*, abandoned them, not beingable to accede to them. (The Exalted One addressed him as follows) :'Vrjiputraka, would you be able, Vrjiputraka, could you exert yourself, totrain yourself well in three trainings ?' He replied, *I could exert myself,Exalted One, in three, Sugata. I could guard myself with three,' and theExalted One replied, 'Then, Vrjiputraka, discipline yourself from time to timein the training of higher ethics (adhisila), the training of higher cittas {adhi-citta), and the training of higher insight {adhiprajhaf. With this teachingof the three trainings of higher ethics, etc. he summarized the 251 rulesof discipline with these three trainings.\"**66. \"TIrthankaras\" is the name given by the Jains to their completelyenlightened saints. Some of the Jain sütras actually do state that mentalacts and intentions are only \"half-acts\", and do not carry as great a retri-bution as actual physical acts (Uväsakadasao, pp. 83, 165, 179). The Sütra-krtänga however clearly states that even an unfulfilled evil intention hasits bad retribution (I, I, 2, 23-30). But it clearly mocks the ancient Buddhistfocus on volition (which is again taken up by Vasubandhu after the Vaibhä-sikas had let the emphasis somewhat drop). For the Jains, any physicalaction, whether intentional or not, carries the same kind of retribution,and it is chiefly physical action which receives their full attention. TheSütrakrtänga has a Buddhist say : \"If one thrusts a spear through the side ofa granary, mistaking it for a man, or through a gourd, mistaking it for ababy, and roasts it, one will be guilty of murder according to our views. If oneputs a man on a spit and roasts him, mistaking him for a fragment of thegranary, or a baby, mistaking him for a gourd, he will not be guilty of murderaccording to our views. If anybody thrusts a spear through a man or a baby,mistaking him for a fragment of the granary, puts him on the fire, and roastshim, that will be a meal fit for the Buddhas to breakfast upon\" (II, VI, 26-29,Jacobi's translation).67. Bald was a plant commonly used in ancient Indian medicine in thepreparation of oil-baths. Avinash Chunder Kaviratna, Ayurvedic physicianand translator of Caraka, identifies it with Sida cordifolia (p. 281).68. Obviously these simple acts of performance (Sumatisila's \"activitywhich is not action\") cannot be action in the Buddhist sense, i,e. actioncarrying retribution. As we have seen in note 43, the activity of the physicalorgans themselves must be completely indeterminate.*of the Prätimoksa.

It, The Thirty Verses, and The Teaching of theThree Own-Beings seem to belong together : the implicationsof one lead to the revelations of the next.Perhaps no work of Vasubandhu's has been more consis-tently misunderstood than The Twenty Verses. It has frequentlybeen used as an authoritative source for opinions that are infact not even there. The main point here is not that conscious-ness unilaterally creates all forms in the universe, as has beensupposed by Dharmapäla and Hsüan-tsang, but rather that anobject-of-consciousness is \"internal\", ,and the \"external\" sti-muli are only inferrable.* What is observed directly are alwaysonly perceptions, colored by particular consciousness-\"seeds\".The very fact that these \"seeds\" are spoken of at all indicatesa double influence. On one hand, every consciousness-momentdeposits a \"seed\"; on the other, each \"seed\" influences everysubsequent consciousness-moment, until a \"revolution at thebasis\" of consciousness is achieved.In its entirety, this work is very free-wheeling, and directedat a wide variety of philosophical and generally human problems.Its ingenious refutation of atomism could stop even a twen-tieth-century particle physicist thinking.Most interesting is the approach in this work towards \"re-alities\". Since experienced realities are all equally without aperceptible externally existing reference point, the differencebetween illusion and reality falls away. That is, all \"realities\"involve an amount of \"illusion\". Even where there is a un-animous concensus among aggregate-'^series\" regarding expe-rienced events, this does not mean that their view is illusion-freereality.

For, even with placing down a foot once, onewould go everywhere. There could be no apprehension of anearer \"part of something\" and a non-apprehension of a moreremoved \"part\", simultaneously. For a concurrent apprehen-sion and non-apprehension of the same thing isn't logical. Therewould be no special development for species that are separate,such as elephants, horses, etc. and since they would all be onein that case, how could their separation be accepted ?

And therewould be no reason for the non-seeing of subtle water-beings,since they would be visible in common with the more apparent.An otherness in entities is constructed if there is a division ofcharacteristics, and not otherwise, so when speaking from theatomic point of view, one must by necessity con struct divisions,and it cannot be demonstrated that they (the atoms) arein any way of one kind.

Of course Vasubandhu will deny that the latter is trueat all, since there are always various ways of perceiving \"the same sequence.\"And the restriction as to place and time for objects of sense and understand-ing does not depend on a definite external object, as it is a principle operat-ing even in the perceptions taking place in dreams.3. The pretas are \"the hungry ghosts\" of traditional Buddhist lore,who undergo special sufferings because of past unbeneficial actions. Allof them will see the same pus-rivers, etc. even though others won't : anotherindication that experienced reality may be totally mentally created.4a. The objector is saying that an external object of consciousness isproved by \"action's being performed\". This means, for instance, that foodwhich is tasted while awake has the activity of nourishing, while \"food\"that is tasted in a dream is not really food, as it does not nourish the organism.Vasubandhu says that this argument is not fool-proof, because when a manhas a sexual dream, the biological function of releasing semen is performedin this case.4b. The hell-states will be reduced by Vasubandhu to afflicted eventsexisting only in the consciousness-streams of those experiencing them.5. Hallucinations exist as much as anything else does, since they areperceptions."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"176   Seven Works of Vasubandhu6. Residual impressions take place in consciousness. Retribution isa fruition or maturation of impressions, and thus should take place in theconsciousness-series only.7,8. \"Spontaneously generated beings\" are those that arise all atonce, with all their organs neither lacking nor deficient. They do not haveto undergo embryonic stages or any other development. Traditionally,gods, hell-beings, and the intermediate existences between one full life-\"series\" and the next (the bardo of the Bardo-ThödoU or Tibetan Book ofthe Dead) are considered tobe \"spontaneously generated beings\" (cf.Kosa III 9 b-c). We have seen that Vasubandhu in The Twenty Versesdenies the existence of special hell-beings, and \"god-states\" are for him againonly special transformations of consciousness. As regards \"intermediateexistences\" between lives, he says that they aren't really born yet, but onlyin the process of being born {Kosa III, ad 10, end). In the deeper perspectiveof Vasubandhu's Explanation of Dependent Origination and The TibetanBook of the Dead, every life-stream consists of an alternating series of \"life\"and \"death\", i.e. there is a dying and being again in every moment. In thatsense, every \"dying moment\" is an intermediate existence. But then it alsono longer really had the traditional characteristic of a \"spontaneously gene-rated being\". Vasubandhu here assumes that the category of \"spontaneouslygenerated beings\" really doesn't exist, and that the Buddha spoke of them,and in particular of spontaneously generated intermediate existences, onlyto demonstrate the non-discontinuity of the citta-series. Without the assump-tion of a spontaneously generated intermediate existence, people mightassume that there is a discontinuity in citta between one life and thenext, including the one life, next one, next one, next one, next one, etc. thatis going on in each successive moment.9. As far as what we directly experience is concerned, a \"seed\" andperception become manifest in what we term \"seeing a visible.\" \"The visibleseen\" is really a reflection of the \"seed\", i.e. an impression in consciousness,the visual consciousness is a special transformation in the consciousness-series affected by that \"seed\".10. The completely signless perception of Buddhas is here seen to beequivalent with the Universal Self of the Upanisads. The recognition oftheir fundamental oneness is rare in Buddhist writing. The selflessnessof events and personalities does not of course refer to this Universal Self,which Vasubandhu might more usually call \"Emptiness\" or \"the Ground ofall events\". It refers rather to any fixed particular individualizing force inparticulars.11. \"One\" sees the selflessness of perception-only when \"one\" has seenthat the \"self\" previously constructed by another perception is void. Actually,the use of the pronoun \"one\" is inaccurate, and does not occur in Sanskrit,where verbs need have no subjects. It has been adopted here as the leastpernicious pronoun, but should not be taken too literally. In other words,the phrase \"one sees\" really stands for \"there is a new consciousness-moment of seeing in a psychophysical complex\". \"One\", as used hereand subsequently in these rtanslations, is not numerically \"one\"."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Twenty Verses and Their Commentary  11112. This is an important difference. It is not that anything is beingdenied. It is just that any particular unchanging characters by whichwe could delimit events and personalities, don't exist.13. If perception-only is not self-dissolving, \"perception-only\" wouldbe an object of perception, and perception-only wouldn't be demonstrated.Obviously, \"perception-only\" is itself perception-only, and not a fixed object.14. In Vaisesika, atoms are absolutely imperceptible.15. Any collision of one atom with another, any atom's being in a posi-tional relation to another, implies that the atom has parts, and thus is notreally an atom.16. Since the atom is imperceptible, if the locus for an aggregation ofatoms is common for all of them, then this aggregation, as taking up only theplace of one atom, would only be one atom itself, and hence imperceptible.17. The arising of shade is explainable only if there is blockage of onematerial complex by another. Now this becomes atomically impossible,since the mutual resistance of materialities is possible according to anatomic theory only where atoms collide. And the collision of atoms impliesparts to atoms, cf. note 15.18. A mental consciousness which becomes aware of a visible dependson a previous visual consciousness. But since all events are momentary,and the mental consciousness registers the visible after the visual consciousnesshas arisen, the visual consciousness is already past by that time, thus\"cognizing a visible\" is not strictly speaking \"direct perception\"19. \"A supermundane knowledge\" is a perception free from mentalmarks and dualities, \"pure perception\". It is followed by \"a clear worldlysubsequently attained knowledge\", where \"objects\" are again seen plurally,but are no longer conceptually clung to, since characteristics which wouldwarrant dividing them off from one another are seen to be constructed.20. If everything perceived is equally a transformation of consciousness»then what are the criteria by which one cajn distinguish the beneficial, unbene-ficial, the existent ancj the non-existent ?21. Here it is seen that each perception influences the next, and the onlybasis for certainty of perception is the consistency of these influences.22. If all perception is without a clear external object, then why is it thatbeneficial and unbeneficial acts committed in a dream don't have the sameretributory effect as those committed while awake ?23. The objector is saying that if everything is perception-only, then onlymental actions exist, and bodily and verbal actions have no reality. In thatcase, he says, when a shepherd kills a sheep, we can't really call him respon-sible for a death, because that bodily action wasn't real. Vasubandhu hasalready evolved an answer to this objection in A Discussion for the Demons-tration of Action, where the ethical nature of an act is traced to the benefi-ciality or unbeneficiality of the \"agent's\" volition. The shepherd faces retri-bution for unbeneficial action as soon as the volition to kill arises. But thenanother volition, that \"which sets into agitation\", which puts the materiality-aggregate into action, must occur for there to be what is conventionallycalled \"a bodily act\" \"A bodily act\" is thus really, according to Vasu-"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"178   Seven Works of Vasubandhubandhu, \"an act of volition affecting the body\", and the killing of the sheepis strictly speaking a result of this volition. (See A Discussion for the Demon-stration of Action 46, 47.)Instead of reiterating this argument, Yasubandhu here focuses uponanother point: that death may come about through special mental forces(i.e. perceptions) of \"another\". However, this does not seem to be an answerto the objector's question. The objector is asking how one can call theshepherd responsible for a bodily act if there is no bodily act; Vasubandhuis replying that death can result from a mental act, which seems besides thepoint. However, Vasubandhu's reply does emphasize again the organicinterrelationship of the consciousness- and materiality- aggregates. (It isby the way not inconsistent to continue to speak of a materiality-aggregatein the context of \"perception-only\", since the materiality-aggregate arethose events which are perceived primarily by the tactile consciousness.Here, one consciousness-aggregate is stated to have a radical effect on anotherpsychophysical complex. Vasubandhu cites two canonical stories to backup his assertion. Särana, the son of King Udayana of Vatsa, became a pupilof Mahä-Kätyäyana, one of the Buddha's chief disciples. Mahä-Käktyä-yana and Särana together journeyed to Ujjain, in the Kingdom of Avanti.There, King Pradyota of Avanti suspected Särana of having relations withhis wives. Though the charge was unfounded, Pradyota had Särana beatenuntil he was streaming with blood. When released, Särana asked Mahä-Kätyäyana to absolve him from his monastic vows. He wanted to go to hisfather and levy an army against Pradyota. (The hostility between the King-doms of Avanti and Vatsa under Pradyota and Udayana had some historybehind it by that time. Udayana had already spent some time as a prisonerof Pradyota, and had only been released because of the love betweenUdayana and Väsavadattä, the daughter of Pradyota. This is the theme ofBhäsa's famous drama, Pratijnäyaugandharäyana. However, Särana appa-rently felt that his father's forces were equal to those of Pradyota in a fairfight, since on that previous occasion, Pradyota had captured Udayana bymeans of a ruse.) Mahä-Kätyäyana refused to release Särana from hisvows, and instead preached to him about the unbeneficiality of violent action.When Särana remained obdurate, Mahä-Kätyäyana waited until he wasasleep, and then affected his dreams by his own mental powers. He madeSärana see in a dream a huge battle, in which Pradyota was victorious.Särana himself was led away for execution. On the way to death, he metMahä-Kätyäyana, and begged him for forgiveness. In order to show himthat this was only a dream, Mahä-Kätyäyana made rays of light come outof his right arm. This story is told in detail in Kumäraläta's Kalpanä-mandatikä, XII, story no. 65. (This text used tobe known as Asvaghosa'sSüträlankära, cf. Sylvain Levi, \"Asvaghosa, le Süträlankära et ses sources\",Journal Asiatique, 1908, II, pp 149 ff.) In the second story alluded to byVasubandhu, Vemacitra, King of the Asuras, decided to pay no respect toa group of virtuous seers who were living together in leaf-huts in a greatforest. He came to them with his shoes on, his sword hanging at one side,and his canopy of state held over him. After he left, the seers decided that"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Twenty Versesand Their Commentary  179danger might come to them from him, unless he was led to see the limita-tion of his powers in comparison with theirs. Using their special powers,those seers, \"as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, orbend his arm stretched out, vanished from their leaf-huts and appearedbefore Sambara\".* They asked him for a safety-pledge, Vemacitra arro-gantly refused, telling them, \"Terror is all that I do give.\"** The seers thenreplied :\"And dost thou only peril giveto us who ask for safety-pledge ?Lo ! Then, accepting this from thee,May never-ending fear be thine !According to the seed that's sown,So is the fruit ye reap therefrom.\"***Then they disappeared from his presence, and re-appeared in their foresthuts. That night, Vemacitra was tormented by terrible nightmares threetimes. These came directly from the forest seers' mental powers. Accord-ing to Buddhaghosa, he was afflicted by 'terrible dreams thereafter, andfinally became constantly terrified even when awake._ This story is toldin the Sarriyutta-Nikäya (I, XI, 225-227), and expanded in Buddhaghosa'sSärathappakäsini (Comment on I, XI).24. A violent mental act towards another's mental series carries moreweight than a physical or verbal violence. For physical or verbal violencecan be borne with forbearance, but a deliberate alteration of the conscious-ness-series of another may make even equanimity impossible.25. The non-dual awareness of enlightened ones, and the empatheticinsight into another's citta, are not knowledges in the sense of apprehending\"an object\", but rather represent the free flow of consciousness. The appre-hension of an \"object\" always implies the presence of an appearance whichis abandoned in these two kinds of awareness. Thus, these \"knowledges\"are really non-knowledges, because a specific object is not known withinthem.*i.e. Vemacitra.

It is stated that the store-consciousness, even in its subliminal state, has certain thresh-old-of-consciousness experiences which indicate the presenceof contact, mental attention, feelings, cognitions, and voli-tions.But it is possible to free consciousness from latent impres-sions. This is why Vasubandhu speaks of the de-volvment ofthe store-consciousness.In the very first verse, Vasubandhu speaks of the \"metaphorsof 'self and 'events'\". The \"self\" has been regarded as a meta-phor throughout Buddhism. But here the concept of \"event\",accepted in Abhidharma circles, is also called a metaphor.Just as the \"self\" is a metaphor for the constantly changingaggregate-series, just so, to follow the reasoning of the TwentyVerses, an \"event\" is a metaphor for a transformation in a con-sciousness-series. But it is well to remember, and in fact Vasu-bandhu reminds us of this in several other passages*, that theexpressions \"store-consciousness\", \"series\" and \"seeds\" arethemselves metaphorical, also.The term \"manas\" is here^used in Asanga's new sense of aseventh consciousness-type, that projects a sense of ego.** Suchprojections are erroneous in the sense that there is no entityunderlying them, and they can be totally removed from theconsciousness-aggregate.*** The very sense of ego can be* Thirty Verses, IS; A Discussion for the Demonstration of Action, 32,on the \"store-consciousness'\" being only a metaphor for the \"seeds\";on \"seed's\" being a metaphor for \"a special force within the \"consciousness-series\" as a result of an impression, see Mahäyänasangrahabhäsya Tokyo/Peking Tibetan Tripitaka, vol. 112, p 277, 5, 1, on \"series\" being a meta-phor for the genetic relation between aggregate-moments, see Discussionof the Five Aggregates, p 71**Asanga, Mahäyänasangraha I, 7.***Thirty Verses, 7."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"184   Seven Works of Vasubandhudiscarded. And so can the idea of psychic continuity, once it isseen that every event is unique. And so can the concept of adefined \"event\", once it is seen that it is a perception withoutgraspable or repeatable characteristics. This means in turnthat there are no \"own-beings\" or \"natures\" which would war-rant the positing of different \"types\" of \"events\". \"The absenceof own-beings\" is equivalent to \"Emptiness\" as this term isused by Nägärjuna.*But unless consciousness undergoes \"a revolution at thebasis\" in which Emptiness is realized, consciousness-momentswill continue to present what are construed as \"objects\". Thisleads Vasubandhu to the conclusion that all non-meditationalstates (in the very broad sense as defined in A Discussion of theFive Aggregates) are constructed. That is, the consciousness-aggregate may statisize experience through the influence oflatent impressions. Here we are introduced to the three stateswhich are the heart of Yogäcära therapeutic theory.** Theseare called \"own-beings\", but are not ultimately accepted assuch, inasmuch as \"the fulfilled own-being\" is really \"the ab-sence of any own-beings\". These are rather provisional toolswhich show the possibility in consciousness-moments to dis-continue latent impressions. These three are the \"constructed\",the \"interdependent\", and the \"fulfilled\". Actually, two ofthese, the \"constructed\" and the \"fulfilled\", are states of thatbasic interdependent reality, \"which is without cessation, with-out arising, without discontinuity, without eternality, neitherone object nor many, neither coming or going\", as it has beenstated by Nägärjuna.*** The interdependent without the con-structed is the fulfilled, i.e. continuance m perception-only ispossible. This makes possible the removal of all afflictions,which have arisen only on account of the constructions of con-sciousness. This state is equated to \"the Ground of all Events\".It is also equated to the Dharma-body, which is a metaphorfor the essence of the Buddha's teachings. As this state iswithout mental constructions (and as verbal activity is all men-tal construction), and as it is the \"basic\" state of consciousness(since all constructions arise only after the cycle of consciousness-•Nagärjuna, Vigrahavyävartani.**Thirty Verses, 20-25.***Nägärjuna, Müla-madhyarnaka-kärikä, I 1-2."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Thirty Verses    185latent impression has taken place), the \"fulfilled\" is ineffable.This is the fundamental point of contact between the philos-ophies of Nägärjuna and Vasubandhu. Vasubandhu may be saidto retain the Abhidharmika's interest in the moments ofpsychological processes, as he in general uses a greater numberof provisional therapeutic tools. And here he indicates conscious-ness ability to utterly remove previously-occurring constructionsand constrictions.Concerning the Text :The Thirty Verses are extant in the original Sanskrit.

That is, any instance of the mental consciousness involves discrimi-nation, and speaking of a \"mental consciousness\" rests on discrimination.From the point of view (or non-point of view) of \"revolution at the basis\",all discriminations are voided. Hence this transformation of conscious-ness ceases on two grounds : (1) since there are no more discriminations,\"'mental consciousness\" isn't discriminated, (2) since there are no more dis-criminations, discriminating mental consciousness doesn't occur. Sincethis transformation really doesn't exist, then, from the point of view or non-point of view of \"revolution at the basis\", everything that exists is pure undis-criminated perception-only.10. It is only the presence of seeds, or the absence of seeds, that makesfor states of discrimination, or states of non-discrimination. Again it issaid, as at Discussion for the Demonstration of Action, 32, that conscious-ness is really only aggregations of latent impressions or \"seeds\".11. Impermanence is neither exactly the interdependent (which lookedat \"as a whole\" may not be impermament), nor does it exist anywhere exceptin the interdependent. Actually, neither the constructed nor the fulfilledare exactly different or non-different from the interdependent, since the con-structed is basically the interdependent constructed and constricted, and thefulfilled is basically the interdependent unconstructed and unconstricted.12. The interdependent is \"discrimination which arises from conditions\"in the sense that though, for instance, the concept of the aggregate of con-sciousnesses is a construction, inasmuch as this discrimination rests on realinterdependent conditions, it is of the interdependent nature, (cf. Com-mentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes ad, III, 16.) Nowas long as even these interdependent discriminations persist, the fulfilled,revolution at the basis, has not yet occurred. When the fulfilled occurs,even those discriminations vanish. Of course, in a fulfilled state, there willnot be any discrimination of \"fulfilled\", either.13. As long as consciousness isn't flowing with perception-only, therewill be residues of dualistic and constructing apprehension. But the con-sciousness \"All this is perception-only\" is also not to be indulged in, sinceit itself involves a dualistic apprehension. Any grasping at the flow is itselfnot immersement in the flow. Really being in perception-only means being in\"this-only\", whatever the present perception presents, without the tunicationsof past impressions, expectations, or the desire to make something stop still.14. \"Revolution at the basis\" is where all constructions are shed, allmental borders are shattered, all past \"habit-energies\" re-directed. It isthe same as the realization of Emptiness, where all boundaries between\"one\" and \"the other\" cease.15. The two kinds of susceptibility to harm are susceptibility to harmthrough the afflictions themselves, and susceptibility to harm through theobstructions of the knowable.

It is a gradual peeling-away of \"illusions\", a concreteindication of alleviating practises, and the dissolving of thesealso as discriminations not to be clung to : It is a most con-scientious series of expedients for afflictions human beings areprone to fall into—and in this it is ever-widening, and directedat ever-widening levels of insight. So it is not surprising thatsome statements in this work seem on first sight inconsistentwith one another, since they are expedients directed at differentproblems, at different stages of insight. For instance, at I. 4 b,it is said that the facts of affliction and alleviation cannot bedenied; in the last chapter, these terms lose all true meaning*The title of the treatise itself is interesting. The Buddha inhis first sermon* said that his was a Middle Path, steering clearof the extremes of desire for life and desire for death. Sixcenturies later Nägärjuna called his philosophy \"that of theMiddle\" (Madhyamaka), as in it there is neither desire for Sam-sära nor desire for Nirvana, since both are indistinguishable.**And, here, two centuries later, in this work of Maitreyanäthaand Vasubandhu, there is *'the separation of the Middle fromextremes\". As Vasubandhu interprets Maitreyanätha's list of\"extremes\"***, an extreme turns out to beany rigid assertion.So Vasubandhu's \"Middle\" is not so different from Nägärjuna'ssince both wish to rid consciousness of fixed views, which in-variably lead to suffering. Nägärjuna's method for doing thisis to reduce all the possible alternatives regarding causality,etc. to absurdities, so that finally nothing can be asserted atall. Vasubandhu's method is much more gradual, since layersof therapeutic theories are expounded, each one dissolving thenext, none of which retains a literal significance once they haveattained their aim. Both Nägärjuna's Müla-madhyamaka-känkä* Samyutta V. 421-3.** Müla-madhyamaka-kärikä, XXV, 19.*•* Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes, ad V 23-26."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"194   Seven Works of Vasubandhuand Vasubandhu's Madhyänta-vibhäga-bhäsya can be called\"Sünyaväda\", for both finally assert nothing. But Vasubandhu'swork is also \"Yogäcära\", in its fundamental sense of delineat-ing a therapeutic course of action (äcära) rooted in meditation(yoga). In this capacity, it is extremely succinct, telescopingmethods for psychological transformation. It has been regard-ed in the Tibetan tradition as one of the chief sources for thedescription of a meditational practise.* It has thus also aphenomenological, or Abhidharmika, side, in wishing to pre-sent a therapeutic course in terms of moment-events. So thereis a delicate balance here of the two main \"ingredients\" in Mahä-yäna enlightenment : npäya (skill in expedient methods : \"skillin means\") and prajnä (fundamental insight in which all duali-ties vanish, and only ineffable \"Suchness\" remains). There isan intense interest here in realizing the ideal of the Bodhisattva,and also in being grounded nowhere**, in explaining theprocesses by which human beings become ensnared and themethods by which they can be alleviated, only to deny that suchdualities fundamentally exist, and in outlining a spiritual pathonly to shatter the last dualities that lie behind the assumptionof the possibility of one. Given Vasubandhu's relegation ofall verbal formulations to the constructed \"own-being\", beingsuch a series of therapeutic aids is the best thing a theory canbe, since no theory is ultimately true, and all are finally aban-doned. The state of realizing the Emptiness of all events is toVasubandhu, as well as to Nägärjuna, a state where all mentalconstructions dividing reality into discrete entities are absent,and there is a seeing of everything \"as it really is\". But thisstate by definition allows for no more statements.Nägärjuna posits only two kinds of truth, conventional andultimate. It is here where Vasubandhu may argue. For adual truth-scheme perhaps does not make the existence of con-fusion and suffering \"real\" enough. Vasubandhu's expedientof dividing reality into three, rather than two, fulfils this pur-pose. The constructed is that which is seemingly fixed, ordered,* Nag-dban-dar-rgyas, Lam-rim-man-nag (transmitted and transcribedby Sherpa Tulku and Khamlung Tulku, translated by Alexander Berzin),typescript, p. 16.** According to the Astasähasrikä-prajnä-päramitä, the two are the same."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 195and static. It exists only because of a propensity in the inter-dependent to become \"a construction of that which was not\"(abhüta-parikalpa). This term could also be rendered \"a con-struction of the unreal\", since the Sanskrit word \"abhüta\" comesto mean \"unreal\", and it is in fact so rendered by the Chineseand Tibetan translators.* But this translation ignores thepeculiar manner in which this term is used in this treatise, andmakes impossible puns which Vasubandhu himself makes on\"bhüta\" and \"abhüta\"** In fact, for Vasubandhu any du-ality \"real/unreal\" cannot exist. It would be \"an extreme re-lating to being and non-being\".*** What the construction ofthat which was not constructs is something which \"was not\"before it was mentally constructed, which \"is\" as long as it isbelieved, and which \"isn't\" as soon as it is dropped from con-sciousness. Reliance on these mentally constructed events, orany attempt to force experience to fit them, is bound to leadto all kinds of anguish. A state where their constricting holdis no longer felt is however possible, and so it is said that \"thefulfilled is the interdependent without the constructed\".****The entire moment-event framework of such works as ADiscussion of the Five Aggregates and A Discussion for the De-monstration of Action is employed here as a theoretical sub-stratum for what is initially an art of mental alleviation. Sup-pose Vasubandhu meets an \"individual\" who is filled with allkinds of anxieties. Whatever they are, it is certain that theyare linked with some sort of self-view. Occidental psychiatricpractise would perhaps look for origins, and would attempt tocategorize the \"individual's\" reactions symptomatically. \"Youare doing this, therefore you are in such-and-such a category,and this is what you should do\"—n,o doubt take a drug—behindall such expressed and unexpressed notions, the roots of the\"\"individual's\" sufferings remain unchallenged.

Andfor the suffering to be alleviated, the entire outlook must bechanged.

In the theorywhich Vasubandhu finds provisionally most therapeuticallyfruitful, what are called \"individuals\" are streams of psycho-physical moment-aggregations, and nothing is fixed or static.The anxieties caused by \"self-categorization\" rest on a colossaldistortion, and it is the commonness of such distortions thatmakes Vasubandhu say, at least temporarily, that there is aforce inherent in the world which accounts for them.But it is not only the notion of \"self\", but the distinction bet-ween the perceiver and what is perceived, which gives rise tothe constructed. So this text begins by saying that this distinc-tion is itself constructed. None of the dualities frqm which itgrows are anything more than \"a construction of that which wasnot\", and they can be removed completely from consciousness.From here on it is already quite impossible to talk. A men-tal attention towards talk is always suffused with an implicitgrasped/grasper dichotomy.** The emptiness of whatever objectof consciousness a Bodhisattva might resort to is included inVasubandhu's \"emptiness of ultimate truth\".

The mere removal of sufferings due toconstructions may be enough for the anxiety-ridden \"individual\"who has visited Vasubandhu earlier.

Vasubandhu wants to see as close an adher-ence to the Bodhisattva-ideal as is possible. The second chapterof this treatise, which deals with obstructions to the realizationof this ideal, then naturally follows upon the first, where \"men-tal constructions, fears, inactivity, and doubts have been broughtto complete rest\".From a certain point of view, the new chapter may containmore constructed dichotomies than the first. Nonetheless, itis clear that a progression is intended, in fact the step from a\"Path of Seeing\", where the blatant confusions of the mentalconsciousness are removed, to a \"Path of Cultivation\", whereafflictions are eliminated. Now concepts are brought up notbecause they are believed in, but because they correspond topractises effective in removing the obstructions of the know-able.In the fulfilled life-stream, there is neither agitation nor com-placency. Agitation does not allow for the calm necessaryin face of the disagreeable and hostile, and complacency is clear-ly an obstacle to passion, compassion, and energy. The an-cient list of \"fetters\" makes its appearance as kinds of obstruc-tions, but with some changes. Significantly, excitedness, lustfor sensuous pleasures, desire for experiences in the realm ofimages, and desire for experiences in the imageless sphere, havebeen dropped, and a much more explicit break-down of whatwas earlier simply called \"i\\\\-W\\\\V\\vyäpäda) is given, in theform of envy, selfish greed, and basic aversion. The additionalobstructions enumerated by Maitreyanätha, verses II 4-8, andfurther elucidated by Vasubandhu, show by their contrasts manyof the characteristics of the ideal desired. But it is significantthat Vasubandhu does not delimit a goal with strings of \"should's\"—this would be too much construction, and too much con-struction of dubious upäya value. Rather, he concentrateson a delimitation of obstructions, which are all given as moti-vating disposition-type events. In a Mahäyäna life-stream,there is confidence, satisfaction with very little, lack of concernwith any type of gain, there is tremendous compassion, thereis no lack of activity, there is the full taking up of Samsära,sense-fields are used to an ultimate extent, there is enormouscapacity to evolve, and skill in the Mahäyäna upäyas andmeditations."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"198   Seven Works of VasubandhuBut what is the relation between this ideal and the fulfilledown-being ?

But this path ispresented only in relation to the removal of obstructionsto the fulfilled : that is, the path is again a constructiontentatively acted upon in order to effect the removal ofconstructions.There is a hint of a further reason for the necessity of thecultivation of such attitudes in chapter three. Each of thethree own-beings is connected with the Truth of Suffering. Suf-fering exists in the constructed, because of the clinging that comesthrough adherence to views of \"personalities\" and \"events\"Suffering exists in the interdependent, because of the basiccharacteristics of the world itself. But suffering exists also inthe fulfilled, \"because of connection with suffering\".* Thislast phrase would seem to indicate a voluntary connection withthe sufferings of Samsära, even after the natures of the cons-tructed and interdependent have been realized.

One-pointedness of conscious-ness is at first most disturbed by slackness and excitedness.Concentration must be maintained, but on the other hand, anyagitation or tenseness must be avoided.* When the appli-cations of mindfuiness, which stand at the basis of all furthermeditations here, have been practised, the four right effortscan be pursued for the arising of beneficial mental events andthe removal of unbeneficial ones.

Their delimitations, and their antidotes, are given byVasubandhu with medical precision. Not everyone will haveall the agitations he enumerates, as many of them depend onspecific attitudes towards the meditational course itself. Thus\"agitation due to mental marks\" rests on a deliberate intentionin \"one's\" meditation, which is a flaw. Vasubandhu simplyenumerates different possibilities. And constructions to shat-ter constructions of this subtler kind are built, and immediatelydismantled.* The Vajra Words, and the delimitation of\"extremes\" to be avoided, culminate this ever-widening shed-ding of prior ways of looking, until finally the very last dualitiesof ali, such as those of \"affliction\" and \"alleviation\", \"right-ness\" and \"wrongness\", \"practise\" and \"non-practise\" aretotally discarded.The factors conducive to penetration constitute a \"Path of(Initial) Application\" : it is preceded by \"A Path of Prepara-tion\", which includes the \"factors conducive to liberation\" :faith in the validity of the basic direction of Buddhist practise,vigor, mindfulness, meditational concentration and insight intheir first conscious occurrences. The factors conducive topenetration can be applied to the applications of mindfulness,those basic meditations on body, feelings, consciousness-mo-ments, and all moment-events together. \"The Path of InitialApplication\" is followed by \"A Path of Seeing\", involving thespecifically Mahäyäna way of looking at phenomena. \"ThePath of Seeing\", in turn, is followed by \"The Path of Cultiva-tion\", where all afflictions are gradually removed.

It shouldbe noted, however, that in, this treatise itself, these \"paths\"and \"stages\" are discussed, though in an extremely compressedform.The Mahäyäna path begins with the arising of an ehlighten-ment-citta, the first consciousness-moment directed at enlighten-ment.

The Mahäyänistic Bodhi-sattva is \"one\" who \"does not go into Nirvana\", but rather\"stays in Samsära for the alleviation of the sufferings of others\",motivated by a great compassion. Asanga describes the arisingof the enlightenment-citta as occurring after four conditionshave arisen. The first he describes as follows : \"Here a sonof the community or a daughter of the community sees theunthinkable and marvellous power of a Buddha or a Bodhi-sattva in drawing out (afflictions), or hears about it in the pre-sence of one who has experienced it... .He or she then becomesconfident in regard to the possibility of becoming enlightened,and gives rise to a citta directed at the great enlightenment.\"**This citta is the first resolve of the Bodhisattva, to attain en-lightenment no longer how difficult it may be, or how long itwill take. The second condition is the arising of a citta whereone has seen or heard of the depth of the Mahäyäna writings,a citta which is confident in, and resolves to attain, a Buddha'sknowledge. Just as \"enlightenment\" is linked with \"insight\",\"knowledge\" can be linked with \"skill in means\", because whatis meant here by \"knowledge\" are all the worldly expedientsfor alleviation, many of which are included in Mahäyäna litera-ture. This citta is thus the second resolve of a Bodhisattva,to learn all Mahäyäna texts and expedient methods, no matterhow innumerable they are. The \"third condition\" is the arisingof a citta which considers that staying in the path of a Bodhi-sattva for a long time would help sentient beings remove theircountless sufferings. This citta is the third resolve of a Bodhi-sattva, to help remove the sufferings of all sentient beings, how-ever immeasurable they may be. The \"fourth condition\" isagain a citta directed at the sufferings of sentient beings, whereit is considered how they are tormented by the afflictions.

Reverencing both this Treatise's author, the son of Sugata*—,and its expounder to us and others**, I will attempt to ex-plain its meaning.Here, at first, a framework for the Treatise has been arrangedas follows :\"Characteristics, obstructions, realities, the cultivationof antidotes, situations there, the attainment of fruition,and the supremacy of the Vehicle\" I. laThat is to say that tKe following seven topics are dealt with inthe Treatise : tHe main characteristics (of beings and the world),their obstructions, realities, the cultivation of antidotes to theobstructions, situations which may arise in this cultivation ofantidotes, the attainment of fruition there, and a path to theattainment of fruition, a path having no superior.Referring to the characteristics, the author says :(\"he\")\"There is the construction of that which was not;duality is not found there;(\"She\")But emptiness is found there;And \"he\" is found in \"Her\", as well.\" LI.In this passage, \"the construction of that which was not\" is thediscrimination of object apprehended and subject apprehendor(rather than \"discrimination between the object apprehendedand subject apprehendor\"). And \"Emptiness\" is the separation ofthe construction of that which was not from the being of objectapprehended and subject apprehendor. \"And 'he' is found•Maitreyanätha, author of The Separation of the Middle from Extremes^to which this work by \\ asubandhu is a commentary.••Asanga, pupil of Maitreyanätha, and elder brother of Vasubandhu,through whom Vasubandhu was converted to the Great Vehicle."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"212   Seven Works of Vasubandhuin 'Her', as well\" : i.e. the construction ofthat which was not(is found in Emptiness, as well). And if it (duality) is not therein that way, then, as a result, one sees \"as it is\", namely, thatit is empty. Furthermore, one knows that that which remains(after duality vanishes) is what is (really) existent here, and theemptiness-characteristic is made to arise in an unreversed man-ner.1\"Therefore, everything is taught as neither empty nornon-empty,because of its existence, its non-existence, and its exis-tence,and this is the Middle Path.\" 1.2.It is not empty, either because of emptiness or the constructionof that which was not. Neither is it non-empty, because of theduality, object apprehended and subject apprehendor, and thusit has been taught, that \"Everything compounded is called 'theconstruction of that which was not'; everything uncompoundedis called 'Emptiness' \", because of the existence of the cons-truction of that which was not, because of the non-existence ofduality, and the existence of emptiness in the construction ofthat which was not, and the existence of the construction of thatwhich was not in emptiness.

The ObstructionsConcerning obstructions, the author says :\"The pervading and the limited ones,the excessive and the equal,accepting and abandoning,are called obstructions of the two.\" II. 1.In this passage, \"the pervading\" is the obstructions consistingsimply of afflictions, and the obstructions of the knowable, be-cause both are obstuctions to those of the Bodhisattva-lineage.\"The limited\" is the obstruction to the üSrävaka-lineages, whichis affliction only (i.e. the sole goal of the Srävakas, that isthe followers of the \"Hinayäna\", is the eradication of their ownafflictions). The \"excessive\" is the obstruction in those whoact with attachment (hostility or confusion). The \"equal\" isthat in those who make everything alike.15 The obstructionof accepting or abandoning Samsära is an obstruction to thoseof the Bodhisattva-lineage, because of being an obstructionto Nirvana without a basis.16 Thus, the obstructions of thoseof the Bodhisattva-lineage, those of the &ravaka-vehicle, andthose of others, have been made known.\"The characteristics of the obstructions that are simplyaffliction are nine-fold, being the fetters.\" II. lb.The nine fetters are the obstructions that are simply afflictions.To what are they obstructions ?\"to excitement and to equanimity,and to the seeing of reality.\" II. 2a."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 223The fetter of complacency is an obstruction to excitement, andthe fetter of aversion is an obstruction to equanimity.

The rest of the fetters are obstructions tothe seeing of reality.

This is be-cause this view has not been cast off through proper practisein a time of clear understanding, working against the pride ofthinking that \"I exist\" in what is internal or external. Thefetter of ignorance is an obstacle to knowledge about theelements that make for a view of the self. This is because it isa lack of knowledge concerning the appropriating aggre-gates. The fetter of holding fast to views is an obstruction tothe knowledge of the truth of the cessation of suffering. Thisis because such holding fast goes against the possibility of thecessation of suffering, because of the various anxieties causedby the view of a self in the body, and views regarding the per-manence or impermanence of the elements constituting person-ality. The fetter of adherence to mere rules and rituals is anobstruction to the knowledge of the truth of the Path, becauseof its adherence to the view that the highest clarity lies else-where than it really does. The fetter of doubt is an obstruc-tion to the knowledge of the Three Gems (Buddha, Dharma,Sangha), because it involves a lack of faith in the good qua-lities of these three. The fetter of envy is an obstruction tosatisfaction in others' attainment, because one wishes to seeonly others' flaws.

Inthis passage, \"stupid people\" are fools, and \"depraved people\"are frustrated, harmed people. To lack of confusion, arisesusceptibility to harm through reversals, lack of potency becauseof the three kinds of obstructions : afflictions, etc. and lack ofmaturation in insight which matures \"liberation\"!

To fearlessness,arise lack of confidence in the \"personality\", lack of trust inDharma, and deliberations according to words.

Empti-ness is triple : the emptiness of non-being, the emptiness of"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 235non-being of this or that, and the emptiness of own-being. Thusselflessness is triple : the non-being of self of having nocharacteristics, the non-being of self of having a characteristicother than this or that, and the non-being of self through own-characteristic.The reality of fruition and its causes is the truths of suffering,the origination of suffering, cessation of suffering, and a Pathto the cessation of suffering, which exist in basic reality. Howis this threefold basic reality to be considered \"the truth of suf-fering\", etc. ? Because of its having the characteristics of imper-manence, suffering, emptiness, and absence of self (the last twobeing both the causes and the antidotes to the second. Causeswhen unrealized, antidotes when realized.).\"The truth of suffering is considered (to arise) from,these (characteristics)\" III. 8b.The truth of the origination of suffering is to be known in re-spect to a threefold origination, which threefold origination is\"residual impressions, increase, and lack of separation.\"III. 8c.There is the origination of suffering by means of the residualimpressions that cause intentness on the constructed nature.The afflictions of action are the origination by means of in-crease, and the non-separation of Suchness from obstructionsis the origination occurring \"through lack of separation\". (Con-nect this with the connection with suffering that marks a ful-filled nature.)The truth of the cessation of suffering is to be known in re-spect to a threefold cessation, which cessation is\"Non-arising by own-being, non-arising of duality,and the two : flaws and peace.\" III. 9a.There is that which is non-arising by own-being, there is thenon-arising of object apprehended and subject apprehendorand there is the process from being flawed to peace,which process is called cessation through contemplation**See Discussion of the Five Aggregates, p 73 and note 29."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"236   Seven Works of Vasubandhuand Suchness.

Thesemay be known as the three-fold Truth of the Path, through fullknowledge, abandonment, and realization.Furthermore, \"conventional\" and \"ultimate\" truths are, re-spectively, more gross and more subtle realities. How are theyto be known in basic reality ?\"The gross exists in the form of designations,determinations, and words used in practise.\" III. 10b.The conventional is here divided into three basic kinds : theconventionality of designations, the conventionality of deter-minations (as strained through various constricting caittas),and the conventionality of all words used in religious practise.(Designations belong to the constructed nature; perceptions ofsenses and understanding properly to the interdependent nature,but an interdependent nature often determined by constrictions,and practise, though this practise leads to the fulfilled nature,yet represents only conventional truth.)\"Whereas the ultimate exists only in relation to theone\".

It is ultimate as an attainment because its attain-ment is equal to Nirvana, which is the ultimate aim. It is ulti-mate as practise, because it is the Path, which has the ultimateaim.How can the fulfilled nature be called both compounded anduncompounded ?\"It is both, inasmuch as it consummatesa lack of transformation,and consummates a feck of reversal.\" III. lib.The fulfilled is uncompounded in the sense of consummatinga lack of further transformation back into what was before, andit is compounded as those things that are comprised in the Truthof the Path, which are \"fulfilled\" in the sense that they con-summate a lack of the reversed, and in all those things that areto be known, which are \"fulfilled\" because of their basic non-reversal. (The stages comprised in the Truth of the Path, andall those things that are to be known, are, of course, com-pounded.)How is \"accepted reality\" determined in basic reality ?

In such a way that theaggregates are included in the three own-beings,\"as constructions, as objects of discrimination, andas objects of Dharmatä\". III. 16b.Inasmuch as the concept of the aggregate of materiality is aconstruction, it belongs to the constructed own-being. Inas-much as this construction rests on an object of discrimination,the discrimination of materiality is effected, which rests uponthe interdependent own-being. Inasmuch as materiality inthis sense takes part in the realization of Dharmatä, it belongsto the fulfilled own-being. The same holds for the other aggre-gates : feelings, cognitions, motivating dispositions, and con-sciousnesses, and the domains, sense-fields, etc. This ten-foldskill in means regarding the view of a self becomes part of basicreality with the inclusion of the aggregates within the threeown-beings.

A superimposition regarding effectwould be to construct the development of motivating disposi-tions, with ignorance, etc. as conditions, with selves enteringin.

Interdependence in regardto what isn't wanted can be explained as taking place througharrival in an unhappy state at which one arrives because ofactions, undesirable to others, and interdependence in a desir-able state can be explained as taking place through arrival ata happy state occurring because of beneficial actions. Thenthere is an interdependence regarding what is called completeclearing, since this cannot be attained without abandoning thefive obstructions* and without practising the seven limbs ofenlightenment putting an ond to suffering (mindfulness, in-vestigation of events, vigor, zest, tranquility, meditational con-centration, and even-mindedness). Interdependence in regardto simultaneous arising means the impossibility of two Tathä-gatas, or two world-emperors, arising at the same time in thesame world-realm.40 Interdependence regarding right practisemeans that those perceiving reality have little trouble in rightpractise, and naturally do not commit actions harming livingbeings. But people separate from Dharma may do so. Fordetails in these matters, one should consult the Bahudhätuka-sütra.**The twenty-two faculties are sovereign in six ways :\"Apprehension, continuity, continuation, experience,and the two kinds of clearing.\" III.20a.*Majjhima CXV**SeeII, 1, ad II. 1."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"'Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 243The twenty-two faculties are thus ascertained according to theirsovereignty regarding six functions.

The Cultivation of Antidotes, Situations There, andThe Attainment of Fruition.The cultivation of antidotes is the cultivation of the alliesof enlightenment. This is to be discussed just now. First ofall,\"The cultivation of the applications x>f mindfulnesscomes about through susceptibility to harm,the cause of craving, the state of being the sensory domain,and lack of confusion, in relation to the Four Truths.'*IV. LSusceptibility to harm is displayed by the body. Because ithas the characteristic of compounded events susceptible toharm, one enters into the Truth of Suffering by an examinationof it. Susceptibility to harm is the suffering state of compound-ed events, through which those who know see that all is liableto afflictions because of suffering. The cause of cravings isfeelings, and one enters into the Truth of the Origination ofSuffering by an examination of them. But attachment to theidea of \"self\" is only citta, and one enters into the Truth of theCessation of Suffering by an examination of it, because thereis the disappearance of any fear of the cessation of self (whenone has understood that the \"continuity of self\" is only cittas).Through an examination of moment-events, one enters into theTruth of the Path, through a lack of confusion as regards eventswhich serve to afflict, and those which serve to alleviate. So,at first, the cultivation of the applications of mindfulness isdetermined in relation to entry into the Four Truths.After these, there is the cultivation of the right exertions.Because\"The adverse factors and antidotes being known inevery Way,there develops a four-fold vigor,for their removal and approach.\" IV. 2."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 247From the cultivation of the applications of mindfulness, whereadverse factors and antidotes have been completely known inall their aspects, a four-fold vigor for the removal of adversefactors, and for the arising of antidotes, develops. For theabandoning of malignant and unbeneficial events which havearisen, and so forth (i.e. for the arising of beneficial events whichhave not yet arisen, for the non-arising of unbeneficial eventswhich have not yet arisen, and for the maintenance, furtherdevelopment, and complete fulfillment of beneficial eventswhich have arisen).\"Skill in steadiness for the increase of all aims,following upon eight motivating factors of abandoningfive flaws.\" IV. 3.In this cultivation of vigor for the removal and approach ofthese factors, a skill in steadiness of citta is the four bases ofpsychic power, because they are the cause of an increase in allpsychic aims. \"Steadiness\" here is to be known as steadinessin citta, i.e. meditational concentration. \"Thus the bases ofpsychic power follow immediately upon the right exertions\".This skill can be known as being associated with the cultivationof eight motivating factors for the abandonment of five flaws.To tell us what five flaws these are, he says :\"Sloth, forgetting instructions, slackness, excitedness,lack of motivating factors, and motivating factors :these are considered to be the five flaws.\" IV.4.Here, slackness and excitedness are made into a single flaw.A lack of motivating factors is a flaw at a time when slacknessand excitedness are being put to rest. Motivating factors area flaw when they have been put to rest.And how are the eight motivating factors of abandonment,which work towards their abandonment, to be determined ?The four which are conducive to the abandonment of sloth arezest, effort, faith, and tranquility.

The remaining four motivating factors of aban-donment : mindfulness, the state of knowing, volition, and equani-mity, are to be known as antidotes to the four flaws as theyare enumerated.Furthermore this mindfulness, etc. are to be known, re-spectively, as being\"A lack of loss in the meditational object,a recognition of slackness and excitedness,motivating factors in their removal,and continuance in tranquiiity in a state of rest.\" IV. 5b.Mindfulness is a lack of loss of image, etc. in the meditationalobject.

The situation of having nothing left todo is that of the accomplished one (i.e. the one who has passedbeyond having to learn specifics or practise anything specific).A distinctive situation is that of one who is endowed with thespecial qualities of the super-knovyledges, etc. A \"highersituation\" is that of a Bodhisattva, who does not enter the stagesof a Sravaka, etc. A \"situation having no higher\" is that of•See note 16."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 253a Buddha, because there is no other situation beyond it.

The situationof being predicted for full enlightenment occurs in the eighthstage. The situation of being able to relate totally occurs inthe ninth stage. The situation of gaining full potency occursin the tenth stage. The situation of attaining enlightenment isthe dharma-body of the Buddhas.48 The situation of beingof good effect (to others) is the enjoyment-body. The situationof completing (beneficial) actions is the formation-body of theBuddhas. All of these various situations which occur in manydifferent ways, are here made known in brief only.\"Further, in the ground of all events, they are three-fold :unclear, unclear and clear, and completely clear.\" IV. 15In this passage, \"the unclear situation\" starts with the causalsituation, and goes up through the entire Path of Application.49\"The unclear and clear situation\" is that of the learners, and\"the completely clear situation\" is that of the accomplishedones.\"And from this the situations of persons (on the Path)is known as is fitting.\" IV. 16.And from this division of situations the situation of persons(on the Path) is known as is fitting.

Delight is that delight in the beneficial which comesfrom previous continued practise. Growing is the nourishingof the roots of the beneficial which comes through the continuedpractise of beneficial events, once they have become present.Becoming completely cleared is the eradication of obstructions.This is the five-fold fruition, which can be known as occurringin this order : the fruition of maturation, the fruition of capa-city, the fruition which flows out from that, the fruition whichmakes one a full person, and the fruition of disjunction (fromobstructions).\"Ever increasing, the beginning, that throughcontinuous practise,through their attainment all together,through being favorable,through disjunction from adverse factors,through distinction,through becoming higher,and through having no higher,another set of fruitions is given in conciseness.\" IV. 18.The ever-increasing fruition is to be known by the succession(of beneficial events) coming about through the lineage, beginningwith the arising of the enlightenment-citta. The beginningfruition is the first attainment of supermundane events (whereemptiness is first realized). The fruition of continual practiseis going beyond that, in the situation of a learner. The fruitionof their attainment all together is all the events occurring to-gether in the situation of an accomplished one. The fruitionof favorability can be known as the ever-increasing fruitionas it is the cause of all further fruitions.51 The beginning frui-tion is the path of disjunction from adverse factors, and canbe considered to be the antidotes. The fruition of disjunctionis the fruition which comes through continuous practise and thefruition of completing it, which is the path of the learners, andaccomplished ones where one is disjoined from afflictions.

Thus, these other fruitions are indicated in brief,for in their full extent they are immeasurable.Now, the compact meaning of the cultivation of antidotes :the cultivation that awakens, the cultivation of restraint, thecultivation of applications, the cultivation of necessary pre-requisites one after the other, the cultivation of sticking to it,which comes by sticking to the Path of Seeing,52 the cultivationof becoming involved,53 elevated cultivation, beginning cul-tivation, intermediate cultivation, concluding cultivation (thesethree referring to the Path of Cultivation, where afflictions areeradicated), the cultivation having a higher (referring to entryinto the Bodhisattva-stages and the full enfoldment of the pära-mitäs), and the cultivation having no higher, where the objectof consciousness, mental attention & attainment is (always)distinctive.54The compact meaning of the situations (in the cultivation ofantidotes) : the situation which is the chance for becomingsituated in a lineage, the situation of beginning undertakingswhich begins with the arising of the enlightenment-cittaand lasts through (the path of) Application, which is begunwith the arising of the enlightenment-citta, (in which the factorsconducive to penetration are cultivated), situations which arenot yet clear, situations that are both unclear and clear, situa-tions that are completely clear, situations that are adorned(with special qualities), the situation of pervading all, whichcomes through the pervasive power of the ten Stages, and thesituation which has no higher.The compact meaning of fruition : the fruition which comesfrom favoring others, the fruition which comes through specialqualities, the fruition which comes through former continualpractise, the fruition which comes through gradual drawingout (of all afflictions), the fruition through suggestion and mu-tual investigation (directed towards the afflictions \"of others\"),and the fruition through unfailing ascertainment and advice.The fruition that comes from favoring others are the five frui-tions (becoming a receptacle, gaining strength, gaining delight,growing, becoming completely clear).

That which comes about through formercontinual practise is the fruition of maturation.

The fruitions whichcome about through suggestion and mutual investigation arethe four fruitions beginning with the ever-increasing one (ever-increasing fruition, beginning fruition, fruition from continualpractise as a learner, and the fruition of attaining all beneficialfactors together). The fruition through unfailing ascertainmentand advice are the six fruitions beginning with the fruition offavorability (the fruition of favorability, the beginning fruition,the fruition of disjunction from afflictions, the fruition ofdistinction, the higher fruition, and the fruition having nohigher), which come because these four have been clearlyascertained and taught (to others).V.

The practise of mental atten-tion has been explained.What is practise \"after-Dharma\" ?\"Practise 'after-Dharma' is development of lack ofdistractedness,and lack of reversal.\" V. 11.This practise 'after-Dharma' is twofold, being the developmentof lack of distractedness, and lack of reversal59 Lack of dis-tractedness comes through six-fold absence of distractedness,corresponding to the following six-fold distractedness : dis-tractedness in the nature of things, distractedness towards the\"external\", distractedness towards the \"internal\", distractedness"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 261due to signs, distractedness due to susceptibility to harm,and distractedness due to mental attention.

This lack of reversal is avoidance of theidea of an object of a sense or understanding's existence, becauseof the non-being of object apprehended and subject appre-hendor, and avoidance of the idea of its non-being, because ofthe existing being of the confusion in its appearances, (ad V, 15.)A lack of reversal in regard to mental attention is the cogni-tion that a mental attention towards talk, being suffused withtalk which leads to the notion of object apprehended and sub-ject apprehendor, is a basis for the discrimination of object appre-hended and subject apprehendor. As regards mental attention whichis the cause of the semblance of object apprehended and subjectapprehendor, this mental attention towards talk is itself to be knownas a basis for the distinction of object apprehended 'and subjectapprehendor, because it is suffused with cognitions of verbal speci-fication, (ad V, 16.)Immediately subsequently, the existence and non-existenceof the \"object\" is discussed (i.e. in what way it can be said tohave existence, and in what way it can be said to have no"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 263existence). It is to be regarded like a magical creation, etc. asfollows : A magical creation does not exist with the true appear-ance of an elephant, etc. (being produced in spectators' visionin a magical show), and yet it doesn't not exist, because of theexistence of the illusion itself only. In the same way, an \"object'*does not exist as it appears, with the state of having objectapprehended and subject apprehendor aspects, but yet it doesn'tnot exist, because of the existence of the illusion itself. Be-cause of looking at the \"object\" like a magical creation, etc.(and by the word \"etc.\", mirages, dreams, the moon in the water,and other examples are to be known), mental factors observewithout gliding, and there is lack of reversal in this lack of glid-ing, and, on this account, also a lack of gliding of citta to thevery/conceptions of \"being\" and \"non-being\".61 (ad V, 17.)\"Lack of reversal in the own-characteristic is everything's.being only a name,with all discriminations' non-evolving.\" V.18b-c.\"All this, from visibles seen by the eye, to mentally cogniz-ables grasped by the manas, is only names\" : this knowledgeis lack of reversal in the own-characteristic, because of beingan antidote to all discriminations.

Sothere is no afflictions4ogether or thorough clearing for anyoneor anything at all. So there is no detriment on the part ofaffliction, and no excellence on the part of alleviation. So howcan there be fear ? How can there be pride ? This is thenon-reversal relating to lack of fear and pride.These ten lacks of reversal may be connected to the ten Vajra-Words, in this order. The ten Vajra-Words : existing, non-existing, the non-reversed substrata, their likeness to a magicalcreation, lack of discrimination, luminousness of nature, afflic-tion and alleviation, their likeness to space, lack of detriment,and lack of excellence.

And if they doexist, luminousness of nature is not logical.\" This objection isrefuted by the likeness of magical creations, for that which ismagically created is not to be found, and yet is apprehended.(The second objection) : \"If there is luminousness of nature,how can there be affliction in events, and only subsequentlyalleviation ?\" The refutation of this objection can be knownas coming through the likeness of affliction and alleviation tospace. For space, which is perfectly pure by nature, may yetbe disturbed, and alleviated from disturbance. (The thirdobjection) : \"If the afflictions of limitless beings have goneto rest with the arising of limitless Buddhas, how is it that therehas not been an eradication of Samsära, and an increase ofNirvana ?\" The refutation to this comes through the lackof detriment and lack of excellence (in Samsära and Nirvana).And because of the immeasurability of the realm of a sentient beings,and because of the immeasurability of the means of alleviation\" (i.e.there are innumerable sentient beings, but also innumerable means ofalleviation).The second setting-up of the essence of the Vajra-Words;Where, which, and from which confusion;where and which lack of confusion;the two fruitions of confusion and Tack of confusion;the termination of them both;lack of reversal in \"existence\" and \"non-existence\";likeness of the substrata to magical creations;lack of discriminations; luminousness by nature itself eternally;affliction and alleviation; their likeness to space;thus an absence of detriment and excellence:these are the ten Vajra-Words.Practise \"after-Dharma\" has been spoken of.

The extreme of assumingadverse factors is to say that unbeneficial events, etc. are afflic-tion-together; the extreme of assuming antidotes is to say thatbeneficial events are alleviation. In order to avoid these ex-tremes, there is the middle path, which does not admit these twoextremes, does not speak of them, and has nothing to do withthem.

The afflictions-together of action are unafflictedand afflfcted motivating dispositions, of which the antidote isthe lack of motivating dispositions in knowledge.

Soif there is the discrimination that something is being afflicted-together or thoroughly cleared, this is an extreme, becauseof the non-being of afflictions-together and thorough clearingin that which is unafflicted by nature. In order to avoid thisextreme, there is a middle path, which does not make eventsempty because of an \"emptiness\", but yet sees all events as empty.Furthermore, there may be seven kinds of discriminationwhich involve an extreme of duality. Discrimination evenin regard to being is an extreme.

In order to avoid this extreme of discriminatinga duality, there is the example of the painter.67 The formerexample of space is employed by Srävakas also, but this exam-ple only by Bodhisattvas.A discrimination as to \"an object apprehended\" is an ex-treme; a discrimination as to \"a subject apprehendor\" is alsoan extreme. For avoiding these extremes discriminating aduality, there is the example of the magician.68 Though thereis no being of an object because of the knowledge of percep-tion-only, through this knowledge that there is no object, \"per-ception-only\" is also refuted. When there is no being (of anobject), perception is not possible, so these are alike in thisway.A discrimination as to \"rightness\" is also an extreme. Adiscrimination as to \"wrongness\" is also an extreme, becauseone discriminates from an investigation of what already was,as regards either \"rightness\" or \"wrongness\". For avoidingthese extremes involving a duality, thefe is the example of twosticks of wood. Just as, from the friction of two sticks of wood,where there is no characteristic of fire present, a'fire suddenlyarises, and once arisen, burns up the sticks of wood, just so, itis in an examination of how events were which has a characteri-stic which does not partake of rightness, that the aim whichhas a characteristic of rightness, i.e. the faculty of insight, ari-ses. And when it has arisen, it causes the same investigationof what was to disappear. So these are alike in this way. Forthere is no favoring of rightness except through a characteristicof non-rightness, i.e. an investigation of what already was,which has the characteristic of wrongness.69A discrimination as to \"practise\" is also an extreme anddiscrimination as to \"non-practise\" is also an extreme, by whichone discriminates either an activity which precedes enlight-enment, or a lack of capacity. For avoiding these extremesdiscriminating a duality, there is the example of the oil-lamp.70A discrimination as to a \"state of non-arising\" is an extreme.A discrimination as to simultaneity is also an extreme.

Indis-tinct practise is that which springs up everywhere (without anydistinctions).And what is the supremacy of its support ?\"Determination, from that the Ground, what is to bebrought about,bringing it about, sustension, reflection, preserverence,penetration, extensiveness, going forth (to meet others),remaining in a tranquil state, and its support in itspre-eminence.\" V. 27b-28.the author says, referring to twelve kinds of support, whichare : its support in determining designations for events, itssuppo.rt in the Ground of all Events, its support in what is to bebrought about, its support in bringing it about, its support insustension, its support in its reflection, its support in its pre-serverence, its support in its penetration, its support in its ex-tensiveness, its support in its going forth (to meet others), itssupport in its remaining in a tranquil state, and its supportin its pre-eminence.

In this beginning passage of the Commentary on the Separation ofthe Middle from Extremes, we have an illustration of the striking differencebetween the methodologies of Nägärjuna and Vasubandhu. WhereasNägärjuna emphasizes \"the lack of own-being in events\" to such a degreethat he wishes to dialectically invalidate any statement that could be made,Vasubandhu is interested in the psychological processes which allow us toreach a state where \"the lack of own-beings in events\" is realized. Nägär-juna has little to say on this, and in fact in upholding a radical distinctionbetween conventional and ultimate truths, does not give us any path for brid-ging the two. Vasubandhu, however, as we have seen in The Thirty Verses,regards both affliction (the constructed) and alleviation (the fulfilled) asaspects of one constantly changing interdependent stream of events. His\"fulfilled\", being the\" absence of own-beings in any event, is the same asNägärjuna's \"ultimate truth\".. But whereas Nägärjuna wishes to demons-trate the inadequacy of all conventional statements (and all statements are,by necessity, conventional), Vasubandhu is interested in showing a path,conceived in conventional terms, which leads to the abandonment of allmental constructions. The provisional constructions used by Vasubandhufor this purpose are however self-dissolving, since, finally, for Vasubandhuas for Nägärjuna, there can be only ineffable Emptiness.In emphasizing the existence of the construction of that which was not,Maitreyanätha and Vasubandhu affirm that there is a force in interdepen-dent events which gives rise to constructions and afflictions. Thus thereis a reality given to suffering which does not arise with Nägärjuna's dialecti-cal denials of any existent contrasts or causalities.To Vasubandhu, what is necessary in getting rid of all dualities, i.e. inrealizing Emptiness, is the removal of the discrimination of objects"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"274   Seven Works of Vasubandhuapprehended and subjects apprehendors. Once this duality vanishes, itis assumed that all others do, too. There is a force which gives rise to theduality of object and subject, but when it is investigated, it is seen that theduality is untenable. Once the duality is no longer seen, Emptiness is seen,for \"Emptiness is the separation of the construction of that which was not\"i.e. the interdependent \"from the being of object apprehended and subjectapprehendor.\" So Emptiness can be realized in the construction of thatwhich was not, and the construction of that which was not is found in Empti-ness, as well, for it has no''own-being\", either. The sentence \"That whichremains (after duality vanishes) is what is really existent here\" indicatesthat after the dualities of constructions cease, whatever remains is what isreally existent, and is Emptiness. What all this is must of course remainineffable, because words are constructed on dualistic lines. (See the articleby Nagao, \"What remains in Sünyatä\", in Mahay ana Buddhist Meditation :Theory and Practise, pp 66-82.)2. There is a playing with words here which implies that \"Emptiness\"could equally well be called \"Fullness\". Because Emptiness and the con-struction of that which was not may both render everything non-empty—Emptiness because it is \"itself\" the flow of all events; the construction ofthat which was not because it constructs the flow into discrete entities. Buteverything is empty because there is the appearance of objects apprehendedin the latter case, which constructions are seen to be empty. And the cons-truction of that which was not itself is empty. Thus it is stated that \"Every-thing is neither empty nor non-empty.\" If one simply said, \"It is empty\",this would be characterizing everything by a single characteristic (whichwould be a construction of that which was not); if one simply says, \"Itis non-empty\", this would be denying the possibility of emptying out allconstructions from the flow.3. Here, Maitreyanätha and Vasubandhu address themselves to thephenomenology of the construction of that which was not. That is, howdo those dualities, which may be utterly discarded, first arise ? Vasubandhusays that the appearance of objects of sense and understanding arises be-cause there is the experience of visibles, etc. In other words, the experienceof visibles in consciousness makes the belief in visible objects separate fromconsciousness, arise. Similarly the appearance of sentient beings arisesbecause of sense-faculties directly experienced in \"one's own\" life-stream,and inferred in \"others'\" life-streams. The appearance of \"self\", an ego-sense, arises only with an afflicted manas, that term here being used in Asanga'snew sense of a witness consciousness projecting the view of self. Finally,the appearance of perceptions is just the six consciousnesses themselves,constantly transforming. Maitreyanätha can say, \"There is no real objectfor it\", just as Vasubandhu is to say in The Twenty Verses. Vasubandhuhere explains how this can be said. There is no fixed aspect in the appear-ances of objects of sense and understanding, and sentient beings, becausethese are constantly changing, and a so-called \"object\" will appear differ-ently to one consciousness-stream than to another. The appearances of selfand perceptions, on the other hand, are \"false\", because' such a self doesnot exist, and because the perceptions usually appear with divisions. Thus,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 275there is non-being of visibles, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations (as objectseparate from consciousness), there is non-being of the five sense-faculties (becausethey are not characterizable), there is non-being of manas (which projects a false senseof ego), and there is non-being for six consciousness (since their divisions do notexist). If all these have no own-being, then consciousness itself cannot exist, either.4. As long as objects of sense or understanding are discriminated, itis the constructed \"own-being\". But the capacity for this constructionlies in the interdependent. The annihilation of any duality between objectapprehended and subject apprehendor is the fulfilled.5. The caittas are the motivating dispositions associated with citta.(See Discussion of the Five Aggregates, p 66.) On the three \"realms of exis-tence\", see Discussion of the Five Aggregates, note 12.6. \"Being again\" is usually rendered as \"re-birth\". But since everynew arising moment is a new birth according to Vasubandhu's Explanationof Dependent Origination, this term has reference mainly to what is happen-ing \"in one life-stream\". It is craving which sets the series going in a cer-tain \"habit-energy\" way of \"being again\".7. The traditional formulation of dependent origination is : ignorancesmotivating dispositions->consciousness->psychophysical complex-^six sense-fields—>contact-> feelings and cognitionsscraving->clinging->(rigid) being->decrepitude->dying. Ever since the Patthäna, this formulation has beeninterpreted both embryologically up to six sense-fields, after/birth up todying, as well as \"taking place in a single moment\".All of the limbs of dependent origination working together are called\"the afflictions-together\" in this work. But only three are simple afflictionsby themselves. These are ignorance, craving, and clinging. The limbsof dependent origination which are action, i.e. retributive action, are motivat-ing dispositions (quite naturally for Vasubandhu since he regards actionwhich carries retribution as volitions, a kind of motivating disposition., inA Discussion for the Demonstration of Action) and \"being\" (which rigidifi-cation itself depends on volitions). The afflictions-together of birth, i.e.those suffering-linked events which come about simply by being born, areconsciousness, the psychophysical complex, the six sense-fields, contact, feel-ings and cognitions, decrepitude, and dying, since these will occur simply bybeing born.3. Bhävaviveka in his Madhyamakahrdaya disagrees with Vasubandhu'scharacterization of emptiness as \"being of non-being\", and states that \"empti-ness\" has reference only to non-being {Madhyamakahrdaya, V, 10-16,Peking/Tokyo Tibetan Tripitaka, volume 96, p 11). Sthiramati in his Madhyä-ntavibhägatikä in turn attacked Bhävaviveka's criticism by stating that empti-ness is not merely the non-being of duality, but has a characteristic of being(bhava-iaksana) as well {Madhyäntavibhägatikä, Yamaguchi ed, p 47, 1-12).It may be that both Bhävaviveka and Sthiramati are missing Vasubandhu'spoint, which is that Emptiness is neither being nor non-being. If one saysthat it is only non-being, this is a dogmatic limitation on the Ineffable througha-mental construction. If one says that it is being, the same is true. ButVasubandhu wishes to expel both notions of \"being\" and \"non-being\". LaterIn this treatise, he makes the point that it cannot be said of anything thatit has \"being\" or \"non-being\" (ad V, 17)."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"276   Seven Works of VasubandhuHarping on the \"being\" or \"non-being\" of Emptiness must be considereda mistake from the perspective of earlier Mahäyäna. In the first of the manyamusing and profound discussions in the Astasähasrikä-prajnä-päramitä,the worried Säriputra is made to ask: \"That citta which is no citta, is thatsomething which is ?\", and Subhüti replies, \"Does there then exist, or canone apprehend, in this state of absence of citta either a 'there is' or 'thereis not' ?\" Säriputra has to reply, \"No, not that.\" Subhüti then says,\"Was it a suitable question when the venerable Säriputra asked whetherthat citta which is no citta is something that is ?\" {Astasähasrikä-prajnä-päramitä, I, Rajendralal Mitra ed. pp 5-6, Vaidya ed., p 3). In anotherearly Mahäyäna sütra, the Samädhi-räja, there is the statement, \"Neitherdoes everything exist, nor, again, does it not exist\" (Samädhi-räja-sütra,XXVII, 17). In the Vitnalakirti-nirdesa-sütra, the heavenly girl tells Säri-putra that \"everything is fundamentally neither existing nor non-existing\"(Vimalakirti-nirdesa-sütra, VII). So Vasubandhu is here totally in thespirit of earlier Mahäyäna. This can be seen more clearly later in this work,where he speaks of the seeing of a false superimposition and denial involvedin assuming the \"being\" and \"non-being\" of anything (ad III, 4). Bhävavi-veka's interpretation of Emptiness was certainly not followed by the laterSahajiyaväda Buddhist writers, who are in agreement with Vasubandhu.Thus Saraha writes: \"The own-being of the Natural is neither being nornon-being\" (Saraha, Dohakosa, v. 22: \"Sahaja-sahäba na bhäbäbhäba\").9. \"Signs\" : those discriminated characteristics from which discernmentsare made seized by. cognitions (See Discussion of the Five Aggregates^p 66, and note 6). They all involve a large measure of arbitrary confusion,and are eliminated in the realization of Emptiness.10. \"Adventitious flaws\": Flaws that come to Emptiness that are not of itsfundamental nature. The removal of these, which were only secondarily thereanyway, does not mean that Emptiness has in any way really been altered.11. \"Belonging to a lineage\" means the capacity in a life-stream to-wards the goal of the Srävakas (Hinayäna saint), the Private Buddhas (whoare enlightened but do not teach others), and that of the Mahäyäriistic Bodhi-sattva. There may also be those of \"indeterminate lineage\", and thosewhich have no spiritual lineage at all. (See the discussion in Dutt's Aspectsof Mahäyäna and its Relation with Hinayäna, pp 84-87, and in Har Dayal'sThe Bodhisattva Doctrine, pp 51-53.) A \"lineage\" is thus properly a life-stream's spiritual capacities or predispositions. Though Vasubandhu herecalls it a special state of \"own-being\", in light of the fact that he rejects\"own-being\" from the fulfilled point of view, it might have been better tocharacterize it in a different way. Yasomitra does this by equating thesepredispositions to \"seeds\". According to him, when the Buddha recog-nized innate capacities in life-streams, as he did in the case of Säriputra,(Vinaya I, p 55), this rested on his recognition of \"seeds\" within the con-sciousness-stream {Abhidharmakosavyäkhyä, quoted Jaini, Abhidharma-dipa, introduction, p 116).12. \"The special Buddha-events\" are : (1) unspecified unparticularizedboundaryless giving, (2) unspecified unparticularized boundaryless goodconduct to others, (3) boundaryless forbearance, (4) boundaryless energy,"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 277(5) boundaryless meditation, (6) boundaryless insight, (7) being favor-able to others through special ways of favoring them, (8) knowledge oftransformations, (9) being able to show forth all upäyas, (10) not fallingfrom Mahäyäna, (11) knowing the doors to the identity of Sarnsära andNirvana, and being able to show them forth, (12) skill in both restraintand adjustment \"to others\" in order to draw them out, (13) developmentof being able to face all knowledges without any deficiencies becauseof being unaffected by the motivating dispositions of previous knowledges,(14) being engaged in beneficial bodily, verbal, and mental actions, (15) notabandoning the realms where sentient beings are suffering, (16) takingdelight in all situations, (17) being of undistracted citta in knowledge ofskills needed to help others, (18) continuance in being able to show forthand investigate all events needed for a holy life.These are at least \"the eighteen special events of the Bodhisattva\" listedin Mahävyutpatti 786 ff. \"The eighteen special events of a Buddha\" aremore properly : (1) one never trips up, (2) one is not rash or noisy in speech,(3) one is never distracted from mindfulness, (4) one has no perception ofdifficulties, (5) one's cittas are never unconcentrated, (6) one's equanimityis not due to lack of consideration, (7) one's zest never fails, (8) one'svigor never fails, (9) one's memory never fails, (10) one's meditational con-centration never fails, (11) one's insight never fails, (12) one's deliverancenever fails, (13) all one's bodily actions are preceded by knowledge, andcontinue to conform to knowledge, (14) all one's verbal actions are precededby knowledge, and continue to conform to knowledge, (15) all one's men-tal actions are preceded by knowledge, and continue to conform to know-ledge, (16) one's cognition and vision proceed unobstructed and freely withregard to the past, (17) with regard to the future, and (18) with regard tothe present, see Mahävyutpatti 135 ff.The ten powers of a Buddha are : (1) one knows with insight, as it is, whatcan be as what can be, and what can't be as what can't be, (2) one knowswith insight as they really are, the karmic results of past, future, and presentactions, (3) one knows with insight, as they really are, the various elementsin the world, (4) one knows with insight, as they are, the various disposi-tions of other beings, (5) one knows with insight, as they are, practises and theprocesses of afflictions and alleviation, (6) one knows with insight as theyare, the faculties of sentient beings, (7) one knows with insight, as it is, thePath that leads everywhere, (8) one recollects one's various previous lives,(9) one sees the decrease and rebirth of beings as it is, (10) one realizes theend of the all distress (cf. Mahävyutpatti, 120-129).The four confidences of a Buddha are : (1) confidence in knowing allevents as they happen, (2) confidence in knowing the destruction of alldistress, (3) confidence in having correctly described the impediments toliberation, and (4) confidence in having shown how one must enter on thePath that leads to liberation (cf. Mahävyutpatti 131-134).13. It would be an extreme to say that emptiness is being; it wouldequally be an extreme to say that emptiness is only non-being. So theemptiness of emptiness as non-being, and the emptiness of the own-being ofthat non-being, serve as antidotes to these extremes (see note 8)."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"278   Seven Works of Vasubandhu14. Emptiness is just so, all the time, so it is free from any othernessin reality. It is a kind of being because it is free from any being-again whichwould involve an evolvement into something \"other\".15. Sthiramati explains this term in a somewhat different manner,,assuming that the \"equalness\" refers to those afflictions which are equalto Bodhisattvas and Srävakas, which means that afflictions arise for themin regard to sense-objects, but not to an excessive degree {Madhyänta-vibhäga-tikä, Yamaguchi, p 67). In light of what follows in Vasubandhu'sdelimitation of \"obstructions\", it seems more.likely that the \"equal'' arethose who are governed by complacency and apathy, and who areindifferent to the sufferings of others.16. .\"A Nirvana without a basis\" is the Bodhisattva's taking a standnowhere, being grounded nowhere fixedly, (cf. Asiasähasrikä-prajnä-pära-mitä, II, first dialogue with Säriputra : \"Nowhere did the Tathägata stand.\")It is clear that both abandoning Samsära, or becoming completely involvedin it, would be an obstruction to such a free-flowing attitude.17. Here is Vasubandhu's famous new look at the fetters, see Intr, p 199.18. On the enlightenment-citta, see Intr, pp 202-204.19. On the Paths of Seeing and Cultivation, see Intr, pp 205-210.20. \"The allies of enlightenment\" are the applications of mindfulness.(those basic pre-meditations on the body feelings, consciousness-moments, andall mentally cognizables or all those events together), the right exertions (see note22), the bases of psychic power (see note 23), the faculties (see note 24), thepowers (see note 26), the limbs of enlightenment (see note 27), and the limbs ofthe Path (see note 28). The mentally cognizables which are contemplated are themotivating dispositions.21. The applications of mindfulness are meditations on the flow of\"one's own\" and (in Vasubandhu's expansion of the term) \"others'\" bodies,feelings, consciousness-moments, and cognizables.22. The right exertions are : zest in making unbeneficial events whichhave not yet arisen not arise, zest in abandoning unbeneficial factors thathave already arisen, zest in making those beneficial factors which have notyet arisen arise, -and zest in maintaining those beneficial factors which havealready arisen.23.

This is what this sentence seems to mean. Sthiramati says alsothat these are not obstructions to the päramitäs themselves, but to theirresults (Madhyänta-vibhäga-fikä, Yamaguchi, p 94). Accordingly, thephrases \"the effect of\" have been added in this translation.30. A Buddha-field is that area-^which has been chosen by a Bodhi-sattva for her or his special attention in the removal of afflictions. Obvi-ously, a single Bodhisattva cannot be attentive to the afflictions of every-body everywhere, and must focus upon those to which she or he has actualaccess.31. The worst obstruction to attainment of psychic mastery comeswith the complacency that \"makes everything alike\". Obviously, if \"one\"is completely complacent, there is no motivation for undertaking those prac-tises which would result in attainments.32. Full accepting or total rejecting of Samsära is an obstruction to thefurther development of consciousness wh'ch makes \"one\" an effective Bodhi-sattva.33. The twenty-two faculties are : (1) the faculty of the eye, (2) thefaculty of the ear, (3) the faculty of the nose, (4) the faculty of the tongue,(5) the faculty of the sensate body, (6) the faculty of manas, meaning thecollection of all the consciousnesses, (7) the faculty of masculinity, (8) thefaculty of femininity, (9) the faculty of suffering, (10) the faculty of bliss,(11) the faculty of cheerfulness, (12) the faculty of depression, (13) thefaculty of equanimity, (14) the faculty of faith, (15) the faculty of vigor,(16) the faculty of mindfulness, (17) the faculty of meditational concentra-tion, (18) the faculty of insight, (19) the faculty of coming to know whathas not been known, (20) the faculty of knowing, (21) the faculty of havingcome to know, and (22) the faculty of life-force.34. That is, it does not change (because it is non-existent), so it can-not be \"reversed\". But this very feature indicates a reality. The non-exis-tent has a reality, if it is so constructed. The constructed has an effect,though it is ultimately non-existent, i.e. it is removable. But as long as ithas a reality, \"there is the construction of that which was not\". Vasubandhuhere playfully takes the constructed's state of unreversedness, and says thatthis shows its \"reality\".34a. \"The interdependent exists, but not in a real way\"—this impliesthat the interdependent, as long as the transformation to \"fulfilled\" hasnot been made, arises with appearing dualities, thus \"a state of confusion\".And this very state of confusion indicates a reality.35. The fulfilled is existent as it is the removal of the \"non-existent'*constructed, but by the same token it is non-existent, since it is simply thenon-existence of the constructed. When the fulfilled is realized, \"the ful-filled\" is non-existent, since the notion of \"fulfilled\" is constructed.36.

The fulfilled means \"revolution at the basis\", where the construc-ted, and hence false superimposition and denial, is completely removed.So it has the characteristic of reality, since the bases of erroneous views,including the clinging to notions of anything's being or non-being, havebeen discarded.37. States are not fully known until their contrasts are. Thus the fullrealization of affliction comes in the fulfilled nature, which has the characterof alleviation.38. There will be \"connection with suffering\" even in the fulfilled state,since that state is still a life-state, and thus susceptible to suffering (See note7). Even in a state of non-constructed consciousness, there may be a feel-ing of pain, if the body is suffering in some way. There may also be an allu-sion here to the Bodhisattva's voluntary connection with suffering, in orderto help sentient beings.38a. The three means of cognition accepted by Vasubandhu are : (1)direct perception, (2) inference, and (3) reliance on reliable authority. Dig-näga eliminates the last of these in his logical works, and it is significantthat Vasubandhu too uses it only when arguing with those who would acceptthe same sources as being reliable authority. Thus he uses it frequently byappealing to ancient Tripitaka sütras when he argues with Vaibhäsikas inA Discussion for the Demonstration of Action, but only sparingly in a workof this kind, where commonly accepted authority has not yet been estab-lished.39. The status of this sentence is somewhat in doubt as it exists neitherin the Chinese nor the Tibetan translation, but does exist in the Sanskritmanuscript. But in any case it is consistent with this work, and in fact statesbeautifully two of its main points : the existence of suffering even in anenlightened citta, and the absence of any \"lower\" and \"higher\".39a. Though the term \"aggregate of materiality\" is used in referenceto past, future, or present events, only a present moment of materiality hasthe characteristics given for the aggregate. Every present materiality-moment is distinct from each past and future one, and each simultaneouslyoccurring materiality-moment is different from all the rest. \"Their totalsingleness\" means that inasmuch as the aggregates are constantly interreact-ing, it is impossible to clearly divide them from one another. (This wasalready admitted by Säriputra, where he says that feelings, cognitions, andconsciousnesses are really the same, \"an4 it is impossible to point out anydifference among these events even after analyzing them again and again.\"Majjhima I, 293.) In distinguishing them, however, one looks at theirdistinctness, their distinct characteristics of materiality on one hand, feel-ings on the other, etc. There is a certain range of efficacy which howevermuch the individual moments may differ, all moments of one aggregate-type have \"in common\" when present. Though Vasubandhu uses the con-cept of \"aggregates\", he is careful not to fall into xhe trap of the Vaibhäs-ikas, who assume that they are true entities. The Vaibhäsikas put theirseventy-five types of Entities into fixed lists because they assume that eachtype is distinct from the others by clearly-definable efficacies, and that theseefficacies can be observed for past and future events so categorized as well"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 281as for present ones. Vasubandhu denies that it is strictly possible to dothis at all, because past and future events do not have the efficacy of presentevents (and in fact do not exist at all), because different aggregates mayhave a single efficacy in a moment, and because each moment-event isdifferent from each other one.40. The passage dealing with \"interdependence regarding sovereignty\"and \"interdependence regarding attainment\" has been deliberately deletedfrom the main body of this translation as being poor skill in means for thepost-Laksmlnkarä age. (Laksminkarä, one of the founders of the Buddhistsahajlyaväda movement, authoress of the Advayasiddhi, is a woman whoseenlightenment can hardly be doubted. And there have been many more.)It was already not strictly true in the later days of Vasubandhu's life,where we find a woman, Prabhävatiguptä, exercising all functions (ifofficially only as regent) of a \"world-emperor\" in the fourth century con-ception ofthat title (cf. Majumdar and Altekar, The Väkätaka-Gupta Age,p 106, p 111). The passage reads as follows : \"Interdependence regardingsovereignty means the impossibility of women functioning as world-empe-rors, and 'interdependence regarding attainment' means the impossibilityof their attaining either the Private Buddhas' or fully enlightened Buddhas'types of enlightenment.\" In spite of the statement's harshness to feminists(and its actual inaccuracy), there is a \"democratic\" element to it, for it statesthat the only interdependence regarding functioning as a world-emperoror becoming a Buddha is that one be male. With the emendations sugges-ted by h toncal events as connected with names such as Laksminkarä andMakhatä, on one hand and Prabhävatiguptä and Indira Gandhi, on theother, any female can, \"do it\" too. Royal birth is not necessary for a future* 'world-emperor\", nor is caste a factor in Enlightenment. This leaves noroom for categorizing human beings into the \"worthy\" and \"unworthy\",or any variations thereof.In the Virnalakirti-nirdesa-sütra, the heavenly girl lectures the sexist Säri-putra about non-dualistic enlightenment, and even has the power to turnhim into a woman, so that he can see that it isn't so bad. Fundamentally,as she says, \"All things are neither male nor female.\" {Vimalakirti-nirdesa, VII).41. These then are the \"faculties\" that lead to non-dual clearing ofconsciousness, see faculties (19), (20), and (21) in the list in note 33.42. It is interesting that Vasubandhu regards the basic Buddhist ana-lysis of \"personality\" as being only a provisional expedient against the viewof individual self. Similarly, he regards the concepts of dependent origina-tion, so-called good and bad states, the times, the Four Noble Truths, thecompounded and uncompounded, as being such provisional expedientsagainst views that would cause suffering, also. They are not to be takenliterally : they are only temporary antidotes to suffering-inducing concep-tions, and must ultimately be abandoned themselves.43. See Introduction, pp 201-202, 204-205.44. \"A supermundane seeing\" is a total non-dual awareness. \"A world-ly supermundane subsequently attained seeing\" is awareness which againmakes use of the cognitions abandoned in \"a supermundane seeing\", forthe purpose of being effective in the world, in such a way that cognitions"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"282   Seven Works of Vasubandhuwill not be clung to, but used only as long as they are effective in removing;afflictions.45. On the enlightenment-citta, see Introduction, pp 202-204.46. See Introduction, pp 204 ff.47. This stage corresponds to the last moment on the Path of Seeing,Introduction, p 207, 208. On the stages, see pp 208-210.48. The Dharma-body represents the essence of the Buddha's teachings.According to Maitreyanätha, Abhisamayälankära, VIII (XXIX) 2-6, it con-sists of the allies of enlightenment (see note 20, discussed in this work at IV,1 9-10a), the four unlimited (compassion, loving kindness, rejoicing at thejoy of others, and equanimity), the eight deliverances (see Discussion forthe Demonstration of Action, note 51), the ten kasina meditations (on blue,yellow, red, white, earth, water, fire, wind, space, consciousness, unlimitedearth in all directions, unlimited water, fire, wind, blue, yellow, red, andwhite in all directions), the eight stages for overcoming obstructions (medi-tations on the golden visibles \"within\" and \"without\", blue visibles, yellowvisibles, red visibles, white visibles, infinite space, and infinite consciousness),the meditational concentration bringing to rest afflictions in others, thegreat resolves, (See Introduction, pp. 202-204), the super-knowledges, theconventional knowledges needed for effectiveness in removing sufferings,freedom from obstructions, the confidences (See note 12), the uprooting oflatent impressions leading to suffering, the great compassion, the specialBuddha-events (see note 12), and the knowledge of everything in all aspects.According to this interpretation, \"the Dharma-body\" is the entire \"body\"of events that make for enlightenment.The \"enjoyment-body\" is the vision of a Buddha that appears to medi-tators : it is fitted out with thirty-two special marks and eighty secondarycharacteristics, which are explained by Haribhadra (Abhisamayälankärälokarad VIII (XXIX) 12-20), as each having a relationship to the Buddha's bene-ficient activity. Here Vasubandhu explains it being solely \"the situationof being of good effect.\"The \"formation-body\" is the material body of a teaching Buddha whilepresent on earth. Maitreyanätha, Abhisämayälankära VIII (XXIX), 33-40rexplains it in terms of the actual techniques used for teaching others, inclu-ding the päramitäs. Again, Vasubandhu greatly compresses these explana-tions by speaking of the formation-body's being \"the situation of complet-ing (beneficial) actions\".49. On the Path of (Initial) Application, see Introduction, pp 204-205.50. \"Becoming a receptacle\" means that \"one\" is open to everybodyand their sufferings.51. It is the capacity to favor others compassionately which stands atthe basis of all further developments towards enlightenment.52. On the Path of Seeing, see Introduction, pp 205-207.53. Without involvement in the sufferings of others there is no Mahä-yäna.54. Distinctive by being either \"supermundane seeing\" or \"worldlysupermundane subsequently attained seeing\", see note 44.55. The alleviation of others' sufferings can be achieved only with inti-"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 283macy with sentient beings and their aims. The type of giving, etc. whichwill be specifically needed depends on the need of the sentient being that isbeing faced : If someone is hungry, give them food; if someone is suffer-ing because of confusions, get at the heart of these confusions, etc.56. The Great Enlightenment results in a great transformation andintensification of energies.\"The Tibetan translators interpret this \"transformation\" as the \"turningover\" of all merits gained to other sentient beings (yons-su~bsnos-pa). Thisis indeed another technical meaning for the term \"parinämanä\"', andmakes some sense in this context, since transferring merit to all sentientbeings would make this practise \"inexhaustible.\" It is not clear, however,,that Vasubandhu had this particular \"transformation\" in \"mind\".57. This \"power\" comes from the realization of limitlessness, whichcan be gained by meditating on the sky, i.e. space. In the Mahäyäna sütraGagana-ganja-pariprcchä (Tokyo/Peking Tripitaka, vol. 33, pp 1-36), con-centration on space is used in a great variety of ways : to see the essentialpurity and non-affliction of everything (p 2, 1*; 3-4), the basic samenessof all events (p 3, 3, 6), the selflessness of sentient beings (p 5, 3,4), the limit-lessness of sentient beings, the limitlessness of forbearance (p 6, 4), andthe lack of characteristics for all events (p 28, 3). The sütra thuß links \"medi-tational concentration on the Treasury of the Sky\" with the true practiseof the päramitä of giving, which is to be done without any concept of a de-finite sentient being; with the true practise of the päramitä of ethics, becauseeverything is pervaded by loving kindness just as space pervades the sky,and with the true practise of the päramitä of forbearance, which must belimitless like space. Vasubandhu says that the practise of all päramitäsbecomes effective only with this meditational concentration on the Trea-sury of the Sky.58. The päramitä of resolve is the fulfilling to an utmost point the re-solves of the Bodhisattva, (see Intr, pp 202-204).59. Practise \"after-Dharma\" is all those actions which must be take»to avoid subtle afflictions which may arise immediately after coming outof meditational concentration.60. Here is an interesting indication that \"the pride of thinking 'I am\"*comes primarily from the force of susceptibility to harm. If the aggregate-complex had no susceptibility to harm, \"it\" would cognize \"itself\" as pro-perly plural. It is susceptibility to harm that is the most impelling forceresulting in a sense of \"I am\". For the injury of a materiality-aggregate canbecome suffering for all the aggregates in the organism, and can even resultin their collective \"deaths\". So a unity is posited where there is only anintense interdependence of events. The implication is that if there wereonly pleasures, they would all be perceived plurally, but since there is sus-ceptibility to harm, there is a false superimposition of unity.61. An illusion itself exists. So this is not the kind of arrogant \"the-rapy\" which dictates to others what is to be real and what is to be unreal.For finally, everything is equally real, or equally unreal. Objects of senseand understanding are like the magical creation in an Indian magician'sshow : It does not exist as it appears, and yet does not not exist, because"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"284   Seven Works of Vasubandhuthe apparition itself exists. There is then no more gliding of citta on thevery terms \"being\" and \"non-being\".62. The Jain philosopher Kundakunda says souls, pudgala (matter),dharma (medium of motion for souls and matter), adharma (medium ofrest for souls and matter), and space, are all eternal (Pancästikäya-sama-yasära, v. 4). The later Jain philosopher Umäsvämi also says all five dra-vyas are eternal. (Tattvärthasütra, V, 4).63. In the earlier Buddhist view, all the aggregates are impermanentto the point of being momentary (See Majjhima I 140-141, I 185, etc).This is the viewpoint which Vasubandhu himself upholds against Sämmi-tlya \"quasi-eternalism\" in his Discussion for the Demonstration of Action,7-10. Here Vasubandhu says that adherence to any fixed view can becomea problem, and so \"eternalism\" and \"non-eternalism\" are both rejected.64. To say that an individual self doesn't exist is finally as much of a\"hang up\" as saying that it does. All clinging to opinion must be abandoned.65. Only the present moment exists, hence there is no \"previous\" or\"subsequent\". But the present moment itself is empty and ineffable. Itis interesting that some post-quantum mechanics physicists have also cometo the view that linear time is non-existent, cf. John A. Wheeler's Geome-trodynamics.66. The \"Hinayäna\" Buddhist idea that there is \"something to beabandoned or shunned\" is here discarded because it only gives rise to fearsand anxieties.67. The example is that of a painter, who himself paints a picture ofa demon, and then becomes afraid of what he has himself created. The dis-crimination of \"something which is to be shunned\" works in the same way:it is totally mentally constructed, and yet has the power to make fear risein the \"one\" who has constructed it. This example is from the Käsyapa-parivarta-sütra, 67, as are all the others in this section.68. The magician creates apparitional ticphants which will vanish ut-terly as soon as he wants them to. In the same way, the discrimination bet-ween \"an object apprehended\" and \"a subject apprehendor\" has existenceas long as the constructed is operative, but <?s soon as the constructed is cle-ared away, vanishes utterly, just like the magical creation (cf. Käsyapa-parivarta, 68).69. Whatever is being investigated is past by the time it is being obser-ved by the mental consciousness, and hence does not really exist. This istrue by the principle enunciated in The Twenty Verses, ad 16b, pp 172-173.But in a certain kind of wrongness, an investigation of what was, there sud-denly arises a Tightness : an insight which shatters all conceptions. It ofcourse also dissolves the previous investigation. So the simile is most apt.It occurs at Käsyapa-parivarta-sütra, 69.70. There is no practise leading to enlightenment or non-practise notleading to enlightenment. The simile of the lamp explains it as follows(Käsyapa-parivarta 70, quoted by Sthiramati, Madhyänta-vibhäga-tikä,Yamaguchi ed., p 249) : Just as an oil-lamp, as soon as it is lit, causes dark-ness to disappear, just so knowledge may suddenly arise in a consciousness-stream, and cause all non-knowledge to disappear. Because this knowledge"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from Extremes 285is non-discriminatory {nirvikalpaka), it has nothing to do with any effort.So there is not really anything to be done, any practise. The knowledgewill arise suddenly of itself, and adverse factors will just as suddenlyvanish.71. The second simile of the oil-lamp is given at Käsyapa-parivarta,71 (quoted by Sthiramati, Madhyänta-vibhäga-tikä, Y., p 249 ff). The dis-crimination which is to be avoided is one where it is considered, \"The anti-dotes aren't arising in the way that they should be\", or \"The afflictions-together have surely been going on for a long time.\" The simile goes asfollows : There may be a house where none has lit an oil-lamp for a thou-sand years. And then suddenly, someone comes and lights one. In the sameway, there may be afflictions of actions lasting a thousand years which disap-pear in one moment of investigation with careful mental attention.72. This refers to the reflection on what has been heard, discussed atV, 8a. After that which has been reflected on is understood, there is thepossibility of sustaining this understanding, hence the use of the expression\"sustension\".73. Preserverence is possible only with cultivation of careful mentalattention done by each \"series\" \"individually\". Yet this does not implyany special set of actions which could be recommended for every \"series\".(cf. note 70).74. On Path of Seeing, see Intr, pp 205-207. For the first stage, seeIntr, p 207, 208.75. On the Path of Cultivation, see Intr, p 208-210.76. Going forth to meet others in a true Mahäyäna fashion is possibleonly where there is an understanding of the moment-events that go intoboth worldly (discriminated, anxiety-filled, etc.) and supermundane (undis-criminated, tranquil, etc.) ways of living. Without understanding and empa-thising with the mundane problems of those stuck in discriminations, thereis no effectiveness in relieving these problems; without knowledge of a \"path\"free from discriminations, the best antidote of all cannot be offered. The\"Bodhisattva's\" path is thus by necessity both mundane and supermundane,since \"she\" or \"he\" will take part in the joys and sufferings of those stuckin discriminations, without setting \"herself\" or \"himself\" apart and aloof,and yet \"she\" or \"he\" will offer those antidotes that are realized only uponnon-discriminated awareness.77. On the eighth stage, see Intr, p 210.78. On the ninth and tenth stages, see Intr, p 210.79. Remaining tranquil in a state of complete non-dual awarenesswould be egotistical, for the sufferings of others are not thereby reduced.So there is a re-entry into the mundane world, for the sake of showing thatfull enlightenment is possible.Since there may still be some doubts as to what is involved in the typeof path suggested by Maitreyanätha/Vasubandhu, the following passageshave been taken from their Ornament to the Mahäyäna Sütras (Mahäyäna-süträlahkära of Maitreyanätha, Mahäyänasüträlankärabhäsya of Vasubandhu):Engaged in saving all sentient beings,joined with skills in a knowledge path going everywhere,"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"286   Seven Works of Vasubandhuwith the same delight in going forth and staying calm,the one of understanding can be known as going everywhere.

It is a startling one,playfully undermining the distinctions between the three \"own-beings\" which are such a part of Yogäcära therapeutic theory,-and at the same time demonstrating their successive unfold-ment. The absence of any dualities in consciousness, the com-plete abandonment of the constructed, is the apprehension ofthe \"Ground of all events\", enlightenment. So all constructionsincluding the raft just built, will be abandoned.In spite of the fact that this little book contains the mostprofound self-dissolving revelations,* it has remained fairlyobscure, and there are no commentaries on it by any subse-quent writer. This neglect has done much towards the mis-representation of Vasubandhu'-s thought which is so often en-countered.The central simile used in The Teaching of the Three Own-Beings is that of a magical creation. To those unfamiliar withthe dazzling feats of Indian magicians, it may need explanation.Some kinds of magicians in India operate with what might bedescribed as a form of mass hypnosis. For instance, they maysit in front of a pot, and make a huge flower grow very rapidlyfrom it. Anyone who walks into the middle of the performancewill see the same thing all the other spectators are seeing. Butif a photograph of the event is taken, all that appears is themagician sitting in front of an empty pot. In Vasubandhu'sexample, a magician of this type is sitting in front of piecesof wood. Suddenly, an elephant appears where the wood hasbeen, and all the spectators can see it. But just as suddenly,the magician can make \"this elephant\" disappear. Vasubandhu'smagician uses a mantra to make everyone see \"the elephant\".So the mantra is compared to the store-consciousness, Such-ness or underlying non-dual Emptiness to the wood, discrimi-nating discrete entities to the elephant's appearance, and dual-ity to the elephant itself.

Since any moment of investiga-tion into that which appears can give rise to the fulfilled, the fulfilled is \"theconstant state-of-not-being-found of 'how it appears' in that which appears.\"2. The \"evolving consciousnesses\" are the first seven consciousnesses:the visual, audial, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental consciousnesses,and the manas, or ego-consciousness. They evolve with cognitions of \"seen\"and \"seeing\" in the case of the visual consciousness, \"heard\" and \"hearing\"in the case of the audial, \"smelled\" and \"smelling\" in the case of the olfac-tory, \"felt tactilely\" and \"feeling tactilely\" in the case of the tactile, \"thought\"and \"thinking\" in the case of the mental consciousness, and \"I\" and \"I amexisting\" in the case of the manas. That is, they usually have within themthe cognitions of \"object\" and \"subject\". Because of these cognitions,they are called \"having signs\".3. Though there is no essential difference between these so-called \"own-beings\", they are taught as three because of their respective relations to\"conventional practise\", and because they are \"entered\" serially. Conven-tional practise, i.e. any dealings from the point of view of conventional \"real-ity\", is based totally on the constructed. That which engages itself in suchconventional practise is the interdependent, and the disappearance of con-ventional practise is the fulfilled. This leads us to the second reason forspeaking of three own-beings: the fact that they arise at different times.The interdependent is prior, as it is the play of the phenomenal world itself.But at some point the constructing of dualities may begin, which results inthe purely constructed. Once the constructed is present, the non-existentcharacter of its dualities can be realized, and thus the fulfilled is attained.So there must be the interdependent before there can be the constructed,and there must have been the constructed before there can be the fulfilled,4. The fulfilled exists inasmuch as it is the interdependent withoutthe constructed; it does not exist inasmuch as it is only the non-being ofany duality. This ties in with Vasubandhu's previous characterization ofemptiness as being \"neither being nor non-being\". {Commentary on theSeparation of the Middle from Extremes, ad I, 13).5. The store-consciousness or \"seeds\" of residual impressions is likethe mantra which sets the magical creation going, for it is only by powerof latent impressions that dualities appear to arise. Discriminating, i.e. theconstructing of dualities, is like the appearance of an apparitional elephant"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"The Teaching of the Three Own-Beings  297in the magical show. The dualities which are held to are like the elephant,or, to put this another way, the belief in the elephant's existence. Whatunderlies it, non-dual Suchness or Emptiness, is like the sticks of wood themagician has before him, which are transformed into the apparition in thespectators' eyes.6. The same moment will be perceived in different ways by differentconsciousness-streams. This is one of the main points of The TwentyVerses.7. The intellect can conceive of something without there being an objectto correspond to it: another one of the main points of The Twenty Verses.8. \"The three kinds of knowledge\" are interdependent knowledge,constructed knowledge, and fulfilled knowledge. On their \"different develop-ment\", see this treatise, 22-25.9. Without the processes of the construction of that which was not,there could be no bondage or act of freedom for anyone. See Commentaryon the Separation of the Middle from Extremes, ad I 4b.10. Without the apprehension of a knowable \"object\", there is no citta,either.
