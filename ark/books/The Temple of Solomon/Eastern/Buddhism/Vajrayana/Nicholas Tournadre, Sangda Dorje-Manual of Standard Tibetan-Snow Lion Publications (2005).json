At first I located a tattered copy of the Rev. Bruce Hannah's ancient Tibetan grammar in a used book stand, and found to my dismay that the good pastor's illustrations of the language were entirely drawn from missionary translations of Bible stories. Not exactly the thing for a late-sixties dharma bum! A local shopkeeper, no doubt very much amused by my efforts to communicate on this basis, took pity and provided me with a small textbook published in the Punjab, that taught me how to order tea using a level of speech suitable only for small children, household domestics, and Khampa hillbillies. This proved to be quite adequate for the chang-stalls of Bodh Nath, but little more. Finally, I had the good fortune to borrow a copy of George Roerich's Textbook of Colloquial Tibetan and, given the general absence of technology in Kathmandu at the time, eagerly set about transcribing the entire book by hand. Though by no means ideal, the exercise proved to be a useful apprenticeship. It was only after I returned to the United States the following year that I was able to avail myself of the texts by Chang and Shefts, and by Goldstein and Nomang, works that marked the first efforts to adapt modem methods of language pedagogy to the requirements of Tibetan language instruction. In the three decades that have passed since, a substantial number of contributions both to Tibetan linguistics and to Tibetan language teaching have thoroughly transformed the lay of the land, and the would-be learner of Tibetan, far from having to struggle to gain access to the merest crumb, is now more likely to suffer from an embarrassment of riches. For those who are finding it difficult to make up their minds about which course to use, I do not hesitate to recommend Nicolas Toumadre and Sangda Dorje's excellent Manual of Standard Tibetan. Their collaboration represents the confluence of linguistic analysis of the first order with the stylistic sensibilities of a leading contemporary master of Tibetan composition. Both share a keen appreciation of an approach in which the learning of language and of culture must inform one another, with the result that this is one of those rare language textbooks that is a pleasure to read. l;r The Manual of Standard Tibetan emphasizes Modem colloquial Tibetan as spoken in and around Lhasa, but adhering to a register that is widely used and understood. The student who masters it should have little difficulty communicating in most communities where Tibetan is spoken. The rudiments of the literary language are also thoroughly introduced, making it possible to make rapid progress in either Classical Tibetan or Modem Literary Tibetan during the second year of study.

The actual writing of the Manual, with its detailed linguistic commentaries and its cultural annota-tions, was undertaken by Nicolas Toumadre and Sangda Dorje, whose scholarship in Modem and Classical Tibetan are internationally recognized. These two authors have achieved the remarkable feat of producing the first manual of Tibetan in which the structures and idioms of the vernacular language are analyzed and placed within the living context of Tibet today.

The indispensable key to the study and research of Tibetan culture is the spoken and written language. For some time now it has been possible to find students of Tibetan on all five continents, and the need for manuals of language ins-truction has therefore become all the more urgent. The present work is our contribution to meeting this demand. Literary Tibetan is significantly different from the spoken lan-guage, and there are marked variations in dialect from east to west and north to south. In this Manual we have therefore concen-trated on presenting the standard spoken language, which is based on the dialect of Lhasa. It is our hope that this book will be a close companion to students of the Tibetan language.

Over the years both nomads and settled peoples of the high plateau have developed a culture that in many respects has a universal appeal. Apart from Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, the medicine, astrology, iconography, architecture, poetry, grammar and music of the Land of the Snows have all gained a reputation which extends far beyond the Himalayas. The impact of Tibetan Civilization has for centuries been felt in Central Asia. It has been influential in China, Mongolia, Buryatia, Nepal, northern India, and even in the European part of Russia, particularly in Kalmykia. It is worth drawing attention to several little-known facts about Tibetan language and literature. Many Buddhist texts have survived only in Tibetan, while their Chinese and Indian versions have been lost. Tibetan language offers a route to Buddhism and an entry point to under-standing this religious philosophy. Tibetan literature is extremely rich in this area, whether it be indigenous to Tibet, or coming from translations from Sanskrit or Chinese. Lamas, the keepers of a living tradition, continue to explain and elaborate these texts. Whether lay or religious, the body of Tibetan literature is vast and the majority of texts have not yet been translated. It also manifests striking originality, a world rich in symbolism, and a poetic tradition of remarkable beauty. The Epic of Gesar, celebrated throughout Central Asia and rivalling Gilgamesh as one of the greatest epics of the world, is written in Tibetan. Modem Tibetan literature, although barely known, is very much alive. Contemporary texts, particularly poems and short stories, abound. Finally, Tibet is at a crossroads between the Indian, Chinese and Mongol cultures. At the same time, besides Buddhism, it has seen the development of a religion unique to the area, Bon. To sample these literary treasures or even just to address a monk, a yogin perched in a cave at 5,000 meters altitude or a Tibetan trader, or to talk to a nomad letting fly his sling over the turquoise lakes, you have to be able to speak the language of Milarapa and Gesar, the vehicle of this culture.

Moreover, the ubiquity of agentive (or constructions in which it is the agent, not the object, that is marked, sometimes creates impression that it is an entirely \"passive\" language. For example, the sentence drank the tea\" would be translated into Tibetan as lopsang-ki' ch9: tung-song, which \"By Lobzang .drank tea\". Generally speaking, Tibetan syntax is very different from that of European languages, does bear certain resemblances to the syntax of Hindi, Mongol, Japanese and Korean. order \"subject-object-verb\", which pertains also in subordinate clauses, often means 'understand a sentence we have to turn it \"inside-out\", and work backwards from the end. said, Tibetan syntax is completely logical and accessible once a certain number of new novel ideas have been taken on board.2 This entails making a certain terminological which will be quickly recouped in the form of easier progress and more thorough LIJHiU\\;iJlli:H'uu.

Regarding pronunciation, the Manual uses a very readable transcription that employs no signs, and which can be used without any knowledge of IPA (the International Phonetic The problems presented by Tibetan (other than syntax) fall into two main categories: those to the oral and to the literary language. As far as oral Tibetan is concerned, the phonetic and the system of auxiliary verbs are relatively complicated, but the main obstacles can be by working through the exercises provided in each lesson, and by means of regular For written Tibetan, the absence of any separation between words, as well as a very spelling (comparable to that of English or French) make reading hard going at the begin-the difficulties are relatively minor and by no means insurmountable. · 'And finally, the good news: Tibetan verbs involve no agreement in gender, number or per-(except the first person in certain cases).

We well imagine the confusion of unprepared readers on being presented with a dozen or so subordinate clauses in a or, even worse, \"nested\" inside one another like Russian dolls. familiar concepts of subject, object, transitivity, conjugation, declension and so on are not always very relevant and don't always help us to grasp the peculiarity and genius of the language.

The Tibetan language Tibetan belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family of languages. This group encompasses about hlll1lrtr••rt and fifty languages, spoken mainly in the Himalayas, on the Tibetan plateau and in vicinity of the Mekong and the Salween. Within this linguistic family there are only two literary languages: Burmese (12th century) and Tibetan (7th century).

The Tibeto-Burman group of languages is part of the Sino-Tibetan superfamily, which in size and diversity with the Indo-European family.3 Apart from Tibeto-Burman, the family includes the ~aren and Chinese languages (comprising most importantly the of Wu, Xiang, Hakka, Mandarin, and Min). These groups of languages are however distantly related. ··With the exception of Burmese, Tibetan, both in terms of syntax and vocabulary, is entirely from the other major languages of the region: Chinese, Hindi, Nepali, the Turkish lan-(Uigur, Kazakh, Tatar, etc.) and Mongolian. Tibetan in its various dialects is spoken over an area the size of Western Europe, stretching Baltistan (Pakistan) in the west, to Sichuan (China) in the east. To the north, the linguistic Tibetan extends beyond Lake Kokonor (in the province of Qinghai, China). Its southern are the southern slopes of the Himalaya, encompassing the independent state of Bhutan, (India), the high valleys of Mustang and Dolpo, and Solukhumbu (Nepal), the region of inhabited by the Sherpas of Nepal. umuur1uopresented in this Manual The language presented here is \"Standard Tibetan\" ~·)l:j~\\' spyi-skad /cTka't It corresponds language spoken in Central Tibet in the region of Lhasa, as well as among the diaspora · .

The language spoken in Tibet's capital includes peculiarities not found in villages just outside. Conversely, a knowledge of Central or Standard Tibetan allows a clear understanding of the dialect ~;:St:::'}'ij~' gtsang-skad /tsangka'/ spoken in the province of Tsang, of which the main town is Zhikatse. On the basis of this similarity, the term ~~~·~;:St:::·}'ij~' dbus-gtsang skad, /Utsang ka'/,is sometimes used to refer to this group of dialects. It is possible to write Standard Spoken Tibetan and preserve the orthography inherited from Literary Tibetan. For the rare words not found in the literary language a new orthography is adopted. This is the written language presented in the Manual. Literary Tibetan There is however another form of Tibetan used by educated people: Literary Tibetan, 5:1~· }'ij~' yig-skad /ylkka'/ or Ul~·~Ol·i::i'~·UI~· yig-rtsom bod-yig /ylktsom phgyi'/. This is considered more prestigious and is common to scholars of all regions of Tibet, as well as the countries where Vajrayana Buddhism is established. Literary and Standard (or Central) Tibetan share the same basic grammar and are very similar lexically, to the extent that with a knowledge of one it is possible to read the other without too much difficulty.8 6. It should be noted that some intellectuals from Amdo and even from Kham are reluctant to learn the current \"Standard Tibetan\", based on Central Tibetan. They would prefer a common language not entirely derived from the latter. Unfortunately such a language does not exist. When Amdowas or Khampas meet natives of Tsang or Central Tibet they have no other option, if they don't know \"Standard Spoken Tibetan\", but to converse in Chinese or English (depending on the country in which they find themselves), or indeed to write in Literary Tibetan, which is common to all Tibet but is not a spoken language. At Tibetology conferences throughout the world (in China, Europe, India and the United States), speakers normally use Standard Tibetan whatever their dialect of origin. ,, 7. This usage has the disadvantage of being used also to describe the other dialects. 8. Many Tibetans, as well as some non-Tibetans consider that only Literary Tibetan has a true grammar. Educated Tibetans are mildly disparaging of their spoken language, which they consider ·~vulgar\" or \"ordinary\" (Tib. phal-skad). Only classical Literary Tibetan is well regarded enough to be \"blessed\" with a grammar. Linguists oppose such claims as false, and for non-specialists, it is worth stressing that Standard Spoken Tibetan does indeed possess a grammar. While fundamentally similar to that of literature, the grammar of the spoken language contains certain peculiarities. Examples include the working of auxiliaries and the way in which they are used with different connectives, or evidentials (or \"mediatory moods\", see the Glossary) which are one of the characteristics unique to the oral language. The literary and oral registers are better regarded as two poles. Some works in Literary Tibetan reveal the influence of the spoken language, while the reverse is also true: letters written in the vernacular contain literary features. The differ-ence between the two registers is greater than in the case of spoken and literary English."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 27 contrast to Standard or Central Tibetan, Literary Tibetan is not normally used for con-However, some lamas or lay intellectuals use a form of expression which is virtually Tibetan, referred to as the \"speech of the learned\" o.lf~·q~·r·~l· mkhas-pa 'i kha-skad khaka'/.

Finally, one occasionally hears the term choka' used to refer to the common language spoken in large monasteries that house monks of diverse regional provenance. Levels of language As in Literary Tibetan, there are several registers of politeness in Spoken Tibetan. The basic difference is between a form of polite speech ~·~· zhe-sa /sh~sa/ and ordinary speech, ~~; l~'0-1' skad dkyus-ma Mi' kyuma/. The polite form means using honorific (H) expressions for the 2nd and 3rd persons and humili:fic (h) expressions for the 1st person. ~·~· /sh~sa/ is expressed mainly through personal pronouns, nouns, verbs and their auxiliaries. In this Manual, the hono-rific is identified with a capital H and the humili:fic term with a small h. The honorific forms are only specified when they are used in everyday speech. 12 Slang and \"secret languages\" In Tibet, as in most other parts of the world, there are cryptic language codes correspond-ing to \"argots\", slang usages or languages of guilds, known as ~t!]~'}ljl' logs skad /lgkka'/. In Lhasa, certain artisanal associations, such as carpenters, use special argots. In cities, too, some youth sub-cultures have also developed their own sociolects. The term /lgkka'/ has a secondary meaning of \"isolated\" language, usually a Tibeto-Burman language that is close to, but mutually incomprehensible with, Tibetan.

Pronunciation and transcription Phonological transcription18 of Tibetan words will be provided up to Lesson 20. Before tackling the alphabet, it would be a good idea to get to grips with the Tibetan phonological sys-tem, and we shall therefore begin with a brief presentation of the pronunciation of sounds. For further details, refer to the basics of phonology given in Appendix 2. The 28 consonants in Tibetan are: k, ky, ', p, t, tr, ts, c, s, r, sh, I, m, n , ng, ny, w, y and the aspirates kh, khy, ph, th, thr, tsh, ch, rh, lh, h. The eight vowels are: a, a, e, o, o, u, 0, i. Each of these sounds will now be presented. The consonants We suggest that you make use of the CD when reading the explanations given here. All the sounds presented here are illustrated in Appendix 2 with corresponding recordings. • /k/ with a high tone19 is pronounced like the k of poker or skull; with a low tone like the g of gasp and, in other cases, somewhere between a k and a g. Thus /ka/ is pronounced ka, while /k9;/ is pronounced ga, and /ka/ falls somewhere between ka and ga. At the end of a word (and sometimes within a word), the pronunciation ~f · the k is very weak, corresponding to a barely audible glottal stop.20 • /kh/ corresponds to an aspirated k, rather like the c of cull or curb. Aspiration involves breathing out sharply while uttering the consonant. 17. The inhabitants of both Gyarong and Minyak consider themselves as Tibetans and they usually speak Tibetan. However, in neither case is the native language a Tibetan dialect, although Tibetan is used by both as the literary language. -18. Phonetic transcription of Tibetan words would be very complex and unreadable for non-specialists. The system used in this Manual is therefore both a simple and largely phonological one that will enable readers to know the · pronunciation of words and to predict their contextual variations by means of standard keyboard signs. 19. High and low tones are indicated by a line above and below the vowel respectively. Further information on tones is provided below. 20. The glottal stop will be indicated by an apostrophe."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 33 The apostrophe21 corresponds to a glottal stop. The sound is produced by starting to say a k but stopping abruptly before expelling the air. Sometimes this is heard just as a tone or a lengthening of the preceding vowel. The effect is similar to the ending of the word what spoken in a South London accent [wo'], or in the middle of the American exclamation \"uh-oh!\" with a high tone corresponds to a slightly \"moist\" k, i.e., as if it were followed by a short i.

It is equivalent to the Chinese sound xi in pinyin transcription. • /r/ can be pronounced in two different ways. The first corresponds to a rolled r, similar to that in the Spanish cara or Russian gora or the British rolled r. The second is quite close to the English r in raw, but pronounced with the lips drawn back (and not rounded). It is virtually the same as the Chinese pinyin r in rou. At the end of a word or syllable, the ra is barely audible and most of the time becomes a lengthen-ing of the preceding vowel, similar to the r of better. • /rhl is approximately like the s in sugar, but lightly aspirated, with the point of the tongue curled back, touching the alveolar ridge (upper gums) and the lips retracted. This sound is noted in the transcription as /rhl for two reasons: first, because it is written in Tibetan as an h with an r subjoined. Secondly, because at the beginning of the second syllable, the sound is normally pronounced as an /r/. • Is/ is similar to the s of sit. • Ill is similar to the l of lap or low. At the end of a word or syllable, the lis barely pro-nounced and normally becomes a lengthening of the preceding vowel. • /lhl corresponds to a heavily-aspirated l. • /hi corresponds to the h in holy or hello. • lml corresponds to the m of me. • In! corresponds to the n of nut. At the end of a word, the sound is lightly pronounced and generally becomes a nasalization of the preceding voewel, similar, though a little more pronounced, than the n in the French main or sain. • /ny/ is equivalent to the neu of neutral. • /ng/ is equivalent to the ng of king or song.

Vowels The eight Tibetan vowels /a, e, a, o, 6, u, 0, i/ are relatively straightforward, the vowel system being similar to that in French and German. • Ia! is an open central vowel, similar to the a in am or ram. Apart from when it is stressed, it tends to be pronounced like a central vowel a, similar to the English article a. • Ia! corresponds to the vowel sound in share, or the e of the French pere. • lei corresponds to e of the French he or the ee of the German See. When the vowel is followed by a consonant (closed syllable), it is pronounced like an /a/. • 161 corresponds to the sound eu in French or the Germano. • lol corresponds to the sound o in the word so. When the syllable is closed, the sound is normally pronouced more openly, as in sock. • lui corresponds to the sound oo in the word cool or the u in rune. • lUI corresponds to the sound u in the French word rue, or the ii in the German Bucher. • Iii corresponds to the ee in see. . Phonologically, standard Tibetan has only two tones: high and low. The tone is only impor-tant for the first syllable of a word. Thus, for polysyllabic words, the tone will be marked only for the first syllable, while the following syllables are atonal. To the extent that there is only one tone per word, and it falls on the first syllable, tones can be a good criterion for distinguishing words in Standard Tibetan. '\" It is important to be able to hear the tones, since this makes it possible to distinguish between a large number of words. In the transcription, the high and low tones are marked by a bar respectively above and below the vowel. /ng~/ \"I\", /nga/ \"five\" or \"drum\", /l~ng/ \"to get up\", /lang/ \"to lift up\", /s~'/ \"to eat\", /sa'/ \"to kill\" (past tense), /sh§:mo/ \"hat\", /shamo/ \"mushroom\", etc."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"-~~ f 3 rwm ~ m ns -,;·· ~qew;;:rr\"·~·~--36 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Tone contour In monosyllabic words, high and low tones are pronounced with different \"contours\" or \"shapes\" (flat or modulated), depending on the final consonant of the syllable. We can distinguish four types: high flat, high falling, low flat (rising) and low rising-falling. While the level of tones (high or low) is essential for understanding and producing sounds, the contours are secondary and can be ignored without hindering communication. Thus, the fol-lowing paragraphs are for information only, and can be skipped by readers without impeding the process of learning the language. The high tone is flat or slightly falling if the syllable ends with a vowel or with the nasals (n, m, ng). For example: /sa/ \"earth\", /chang/ \"beer\", /chu/ \"water\", /sang/ \"scales (for weighing)\", /kham/ \"piece\". • The high tone is falling22 if the syllable ends with the consonant p, a glottal stop ', or the nasals n', m', ng'. For example: /sa.'/ \"to kill\", /shu'/ \"strength\", /thap/ \"hearth, stove\", /kham'/ \"Kham\" (a region of Tibet), /sang'/ \"to become enlightened\". • The low tone is flat (slightly rising)23 if the syllable ends in a vowel or with the nasals (n, m, ng). For example: /ng9:/ \"I\", /s9:/ \"to eat\", /l9:ng/ \"to get up\", /kh'§:ng/ \"full, one\". • The low tone is rising followed by a short fall24 if the syllable ends with the consonants p or 'or with the nasals (n', m', ng').25 For example: /sh~'/ \"to sit down\" /s~'/ \"to eat\"(past tense), /l'§:ng'/ \"to get up (past tense)\", /kh'§:ng'/ \"snow\". Note: After the final nasals n, m, ng, the apostrophe is used to indicate a modulated tone rather than a glottal stop. This comes from an i6 (yang-'jug) which was formerly pronounced, but which is now only written. Thus /kham'/ \"Kham, Eastern Tibet\" /sang'/ \"fumigation\", /sung'/ \"to say\"(H) are pronounced with a sharply falling high tone. Aspiration Aspiration can only occur at the beginning of a word, on a high or a low tone. It never occurs in the middle of a word. It is nevertheless possible to distinguish many words according to aspiration, by comparing the following two series: /p, t, tr, ky, k, ts, c, I, r/ and /ph, th, thr, khy, kh, tsh, ch, lh, fh/. 22. The fall is very abrupt: 52. 23. Slightly rising: 12. 24. The configuration is 132. 25. After nasals, the apostrophe denotes a tone: see above. 26. Less frequently, it can be ada drag, or adjoined d: see the following section."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction 37 The relationship between tone, aspiration and voicing It is important to note the following rule: aspirated consonants are always voiceless while non-aspirated consonants are voiceless when they carry a high tone but voiced with a low tone. Aspiration is strong with a high tone and weaker with a low tone. In the case of a low tone, a difference in voicing goes with the difference between aspirated and non-aspirated sounds: aspi-rated voiceless versus non-aspirated voiced. Finally, it should be noted that a non-aspirated high tone is pronounced higher than an aspirated high tone. Ex.: (high tone): Mingpa/\"leg, foot\", /khangpa/\"house\", /ta/\"horse\", /tha/\"end\", /tsokpa/ \"dirty\", /tshokpa/ \"group, association\", /pakpa/ \"skin\", /phakpa/ \"pig\", (low tone): /t9:/ \"arrow\", /th9:,/ \"now\", /p!J./ \"insect\", /ph!J./ \"son\", /cf}.'/ \"to forget\", /ch~'/ \"to do\", /q/ \"rainbow\", /ch9:,/ \"bird\", /kg/ \"head\", /khg/ \"to hear\". The combined oppositions of aspiration and tone allow the following series to be identified; it is important to be able to hear the differences and to train yourself to reproduce them: Ex.: nonaspirated high tone (voiceless) versus aspirated high tone (voiceless). nonaspirated low tone (voiced) versus aspirated low tone (voiceless). /ta/ \"horse\"· /tha/ \"end\"· /tha/ \"now\"· /ta/ \"arrow\" ' ' -' -/tang/ \"to send\"; /thang/ \"plain\"; /th9:_ng/ \"and\"; /t9:,ng/ \"tune\" /pu/ \"hair\"; /phu/ \"bottom\"; /ph!J./ \"son\"; /p!J./ \"insect\" /cal \"letter ca\"; /cha/ \"pair\"; /ch9:,/ \"bird\"; /c9:,/ \"rainbow\" /par/ \"photo\"; /phar/ \"over there\"; /ph9:,r/ \"between\"; /p9:,r/ \"to be lit\" /ko/ \"yak hide\"; /kho/ \"he\"; /khg/ \"to understand\"; /kg/ \"head\" Geminates There are sometimes double letters in phonological notation. These are not pronounced as double or long. Double letters in Tibetan only change the length of the preceding vowels (com-pare English .fiber and fibber) and the tone contour, both of which can be overlooked in the early stages of learning Tibetan. Thus the words /lappa/ \"instruction\"; /lapa/ \"employee\" are pronounced identically, except for lengthening of the vowel and a lightly falling tone on the first syllable of /lappa/."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"38 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Stress In Tibetan, the stress normally falls on the first syllable of polysyllabic words,27 but the accentuation is weak and not very noticeable (by contrast with English, Italian or Russian). Accentuation therefore poses little problem in Tibetan. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that gram-matical suffixes (plural, case, conjunctions, nominalization, etc.) are generally atonal and attached to the preceding word. This has implications for the segmentation of phrases, rhythm and into-nation. Tibetan poetry relies entirely on metre and doesn't rhyme, and in this context stress is therefore essential. Summary of the essential rules of pronunciation • 1. Tones are only distinctive for the first syllable of words. • 2.With a low tone, nonaspirated initial consonants are voiced (or are partially voiced): p =[b], k = [g], t = [d] tr = [dr], ts = [dz]. • 3. Aspirated consonants are always voiceless. • 4. There is no aspiration in the second syllable. • 5. The consonants /k, p, r, 1/ \"weaken\" at the end of a syllable or word, and are sometimes barely pronounced. • 6. The final nasals /ng, n/ are weakly pronounced and cause a nasalization of the preceding vowel.

For the first four series (ka, ca, ta, pa), the order follows the progress of articulation from the back of the mouth ( velars) to the edge of the lips (labials), via the palate (palatals) and teeth (dentals), after which there is the series of affricates (sounds consisting of an plosive followed by a fricative). 1) IT] ka velars 2) ;o ca palatals 3) ry ta dentals 4) z:.J pa labials 5) ~ tsa affricates (dentals). The remaining letters do not correspond to a clear phonological order.Regarding the first five series, we note that the first letter of each series is voiced with a high tone, the second is also a high tone but aspirated, the third is a low tone lightly aspirated,30 and the fourth is a nasal cor-responding to the place of articulation of the three preceding letters. The vowel markers are written above and below the consonants. The I, theE and the 0 are written above the letter, while the U is written below. The A is not marked, but is implicit. When the Tibetan language was first written as this alphabet of thirty letters, there were no tones.31 Over time, the convergence of voiced and voiceless consonants has created tonal oppositions. As we have seen, Standard Tibetan has two tones important enough to ii:lentify and distinguish. However, tones are not marked with special signs, and must be de-duced from the radical letter. Most radicals are associated with a distinct high or low tone. The nine original voiced consonants ~·kh~, ~·ch~, l'th~, z::::l'pht, !('tsh~, ~· ~3\\ \"'\\' sh~, ='!' s~, 1£:1' w~, are \"~lways pronounced with a low tone, whereas fourteen sounds, the voiceless 'Tj'ka, F'kha, ;o·ca, a;· ~ha, ?'ta, El'tha, z:.J' pa, Z<l' pha, ~·tsa, aS'tsha, 4' sha, ~·sa, \"?' ha and the vowel \"'1' a, always carry a high However, seven letters that usually carry a low tone shift to a high tone when they figure in .. certain combinations (when they are prefixed or superscribed): these are the four nasals C:::'ng~, '<~' · a-· a.r <J:~' ~: Cl.l' 1 ny~, \\ n~, m~, and the letters y~, r~, 1~.

See the table on the following page. 31. The dialects of Ladakh, Baltistan and Amdo have never developed a tonal system. 132. This consonant is an exception to the general rule insofar as it carries a high tone when it appears with certain com-1binations involving a prefixed letter. 33. The letter 'a chung yields a low tone but also generates a labialization in front of back vowels a, o. Thus /gma/ \"milk\" is usually pronounced [ wgma]."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"44 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Transliteration and phonological transcription Table 2 The thirty consonants: transliteration and pronunciation ~ ka ka F kha kha , ga kh§; r::: nga nga '5 ca ca 00 cha cha ~ ja cha '? nya nya ry ta ta !::1 tha tha l da th§; ~ na na q pa pa r.:l pha ph a t:::l ba ph a ~ rna ma '!i tsa tsa ~ tsha tsha E( dza tsh§; rr:l wa wa ~ zha Sh§; El za sa (.\\ 'a a Ul ya ya '\\ ra ra \"-1 Ia Ia 4 sha sha ~ sa sa ~ ha ha IJ1 a a The four vowels i T u 0 e 0 6 Transliteration In European, Japanese, and Chinese works that deal with Tibetan culture, or whenever (for typographical reasons) the Tibetan script can't be used, a system ofromanized transliteration may be employed. The principle of transliteration is that each letter of the Tibetan alphabet corresponds to one or more Roman letters. While transliteration enables the reader to recognize the Tibetan spelling of a word and, to a certain extent, its archaic pronunciation, it gives no straightforward indication of how it is pronounced in Modem Central Tibetan. 34 It may be noted that while spelling is stan-dard throughout the Tibetan-speaking world (0, Tsang, To Ngari, Ladakh, Amdo, Kham, Bhutan, etc.), texts are read with different pronunciation according to the regional provenance of the reader. 34. There are numerous differences between Central Tibetan and Old Tibetan (which provided the basis for the current system of spelling), especially in the case of consonant clusters. As far as the pronunciation of individual letters is con-cerned, however, the only difference lies in the fact that the voiced plosives of Old Tibetan have produced low while voiceless plosives have produced high tones. It is interesting to note that the spelling of Modem Tibetan is least as archaic as that of modem French and in some cases, English. Tibetan spelling represents the way in which language was pronounced around the eighth century, whereas that of English corresponds to its pronunciation the fifteenth. Certain archaic dialects of Baltistan, Ladakh and Amdo have retained a pronunciation close to the form."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Introduction 45 This Manual will make use of the Wylie system of transliteration (the simplest and most commonly used), presented in Table 2. Transliterated renderings will be presented in italics. 1lransliteration of polysyllabic words will use the following conventions: • Syllables within a word will be linked by a hyphen. Grammatical morphemes (case markers and connectives) attached to words will be preceded by the sign+. For example: dge-rgan+ gyis \"by the teacher\". • The letter y preceded by a prefix will be distinguished from the subscript y by a full stop after the prefix. For example:,().;!,. g.yag \"yak\" and ~::1\\.'gyar \"to be separated\". Phonological transcription The transcription that figures in this Manual in roman letters (and sometimes between oblique strokes) reproduces the pronunciation of Standard Tibetan or Central Tibetan.35 This is the transcription that was presented in the last chapter. Although it gives no indication of the 'spelling of words, it is all the more useful insofar as spelling is often very far removed from pro-nunciation. However, by applying a few simple rules, you will be able to deduce the pronun-ciation from the orthographic presentation. Note that there are certain exceptions (see Appen-dix 1, section 2.1). Moreover, there are a few rare words in the spoken language with no written form.36 The literary pronunciation of words will be indicated by the sign (L). Note: When there is a slight disparity between current and literary pronunciation, in the ~bsence of a written Standard form, the word will be written in Literary Tibetan, but the transcrip-'tion will reproduce the colloquial form.37 • The following convention will be used for the transcription of polysyllabic words: syl-lables of the same word will be joined without any hyphen, while grammatical morphemes (case markers and connectives) attached to the word will be preceded by a hyphen. For example: k~kan­ki' \"by the teacher\". '35. It also makes it possible to grasp the pronunciation of Tibetan in the province of Tsang, which is very close to that 'oiCentral Tibet, and certain basic rules of correspondence make it possible to shift from one to the other. By contrast, the phonological systems that obtain in Ladakh, Zangskar, Ngari, Amdo, Kham and Bhutan (in the case of Dzongkha) are different from the one presented here. For example, in Amdo and Kham, there are sounds such as [x] (the Spanish jota) and [1{], the French or German r, [3] (the Frenchj) and [z] (the English z). These sounds are all absent in Stftndard .Tibetan (ST). In Dzongkha there are also sounds such as [pte;;] (pch in English) and [bd3] (bj), which are also absent in ST. Since all these dialects share the same literary language, the way in which texts are read varies considerably according to the regional provenance of the speaker. The fact that the same letter can be pronounced in several different \\Vays is not a unique feature of Tibetan. The same is true of Latin and the Romance languages derived from it. For example, chis pronounced as [J] in French (as in Chine) but [k] in Italian (as in chiuso) and [tf] chin spanish (as in China); g is pronounced [3] in French (as in gens), [x] in Spanish (as in gente) and [d3] in Italian (as in giorno). The same phenomenon may be observed in Chinese, where the pronunciation of a single character varies from one dialect to another. 36. By contrast, a number of words from Literary Tibetan are not used in the colloquial language. 37. The literary pronunciation can always be deduced from the spelling."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"46 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Orthography of Tibetan words within the English text When presenting Tibetan words in scientific publications in English (or other \"\"'·e .. \"\"e\"'~'' most authors use Wylie transliteration which renders the Tibetan orthography but does not vide the actual pronunciation in Standard Tibetan. For non-specialists, a transcription system the pronunciation is more appropriate. However, until now there is a considerable variation tween the various authors. For the sake of standardization, we propose in this Manual a system phonetic transcription that is simple and directly derived from the Wylie transliteration. It is sented in Appendix 7. It will be used to transcribe the Tibetan words that occur in the lessons 38 well as on the maps . The syllable The thirty basic letters of the alphabet may be combined to produce other sounds. letters may be \"stacked up\" within a syllable, which is the main unit when reading. Syllables~~·~· /tshTngtrur are easy to identify in written Tibetan: each syllable is off from its neighbours by an intersyllabic dot · called ;$~· /tsha.'/. Thus the syllables, which connected to one another by these dots, are strung together like beads on a thread without spaces between words or even, in many cases, between clauses. A syllable may contain from one to seven letters The simplest syllable consists of a single radical letter, while the most complex cmnpnse seven letters in the following combination: a prefix, a superscript, a radical, a subscript, a accent, a first suffix and a second suffix.40 Even if there is theoretically a very large set of bilities, the actual number of complex syllables is relatively limited.41 A full list of possible combinations is provided in Appendix 6. 38. The problem of multiple renderings is due not only to constant variation (sometimes even on the part of the author) but often to a lack of consistency. For example, these renderings rarely distinguish the pronunciation of the g words such as dga '-!dan and gangs-ljongs; in fact the first is a low-toned voiced velar whereas the second is a aspirated low-toned voiceless velar. In this Manual they will be presented respectively as gandiin and ghangjong. letter k represents high-toned velars (always voiceless) that appear for example in the words khang-bdag and gling, which will be rendered respectively as khangdak and kangling. 39. The term tshig 'bru literally means \"word grain or unit\". Other expressions are also sometimes used, such as bar which literally means \"[that which is] between the dots\", and tsheg-khyim \"household [of letters between] dots\", as well as yig-'bru \"seed letter\". The latter is also used in tantric rituals: the \"seed syllable\" enables the tioner to produce the divinity in the course ofthe \"generation\" phase of meditation. 40. This Manual will use the usual terminology of \"first suffix\" and \"second suffix\". These should, however, be ed as syllable-finals, and not as suffixes in the usual sense of the term. 41. For example, of the radicals that can take superscripts and subscripts (that is, all except 'a, ya, Ia, a) only ka, ga, ba, rna and tsa can have both at once. And even among these, only certain combinations of superscripts and are possible. The consonant k takes three superscripts: rk, sk and lk, and all four subscripts: kr, ky, kl and kw, but combinations lky, rkr and lkr are never encountered. Certain prefixes and subscripts are also incompatible; for although k may be prefixed by the letter ba, the combination blka does not exist."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Introduction 47 Syllabic structure in detail A syllable consists of: o a radical letter 3lr:::::·Zlj~' (ming-gzhi), corresponding to one of the thirty consonants.

The principles of spelling The traditional Tibetan procedure for learning to read involves spelling out loud (sbyor klog) over the course of weeks or even months before coming to the stage of word pronunciation (bsdus klog). Young Tibetans spell entire texts aloud, and only begin to read directly when they have thoroughly mastered the technique of spelling. As a general rule, when a syllable contains several letters, they are spelled out in the fol-lowing order: prefix, superscript, radical, subscript, vowel, first suffix, second suffix.42 In other words, the letters are spelled out horizontally from left to right and vertically from top to bottom (except in the case of superscribed vowels, which are pronounced after the subscribed consonant). The simple radical In many cases, the simple radical, with or without a vowel, is sufficient to constt~ute a word, as the following examples illustrate: ~' sa /sa/ \"earth\", \"place\", ~ 'ra I r9:_! \"goat\", lll'la /l9:./ \"pass\", ~' ja /ch9:./ \"tea\", as· cha /cha/ \"pair\", ~· na /n9:./ \"to be ill\",~· rna /m9:./ \"negation\", :::J' za /s9:./ \"to eat\", 4' sha /sha/ \"meat\", r:::::·nga /ng9:_/ \"I\",'?' nya /ny9:_/ \"fish\", F'kha /kha/ \"mouth\". 42.

This alteration is often accompanied by partial or complete voicing, that is, the consonants become closer to the corresponding voiced sounds:[g~, d~~. d~, b~, dz~.] Note: Even though the letters may be partly or wholly voiced, this will not be indicated in the transcription, which will be as follows: k~, q, t~, p~, ts~, since it is only the low tone and the lack of aspiration that are relevant. As a general rule, speakers of European languages at first have difficulty in picking up the tones and hear them instead as the corresponding voiced sounds:[g~, d~~. d~, b~, dz~]. By contrast, speakers of Standard Tibetan perceive a low tone and a lack of aspiration. The fact that the sound is more or less voiced (between k~ and g~, t~ and d~, p~ and b~), or even completely voiced, is not a determining factor. Indeed, Tibetan speakers have difficulty in distinguishing between \"brick\" and \"prig\", \"gut\" and \"cut\", \"battle\" and \"paddle\", and so forth. Historically, the superscribed letters were pronounced in Central Tibet, and their dis-appearance resulted in the emergence of tones. In some Amdo dialects, and especially in those of Baltistan and Ladakh, the superscripts are still pronounced, or else have left phonetic traces. These dialects have never developed tones. To spell combinations involving superscribed consonants, begin with the top letter and then go on to the one below followed by z:::17~~·/ta'/ (meaning \"attached\"), and finally the result of the combination. • The 12 consonants with a superscript ra: In Central Tibetan, while the superscribed ra has no effect on the actual pronunciation of the radical, it does modify tone and aspiration.47 i1i' ka F' iii' ka ~· nga ;o• a;· ~· ca ~· nya i?' ta ~· E\\' ta 51' na t:.l' t:4' Ej' p~ ~· ma ~· tsa ~· ~ tsa ii:J' ~· =:J' a.,· u.:r .,·., '\\' '\"-1' 4' ~· ~· u<:l' Ex. of spellings: i1i' r~ kata' ka, ~· r~ ng~ta' nga.

The task may be made easier by picking out grammatical particles such as plurals, conjunctions and case markers, which always follow the words with which they are associated, and therefore indicate where they end. At the beginning, when reading and trying to recognize words, you may encounter certain ambiguities: a syllable could be identified as the second syllable of a previous word or as the first syllable of the word that follows. These problems are solved to a large extent by context and with experience. The interpretation you choose has certain obvious consequences for meaning and pro-nunciation: the existence of tone (and perhaps aspiration) when the syllable is the first in a word, or their absence when the syllable occurs later. (For more details see Appendix 8.) Summary of rules concerning the pronunciation of letters In the pronunciation of Modem Central Tibetan, the radicals, subscripts, first suffixes and vowels play a crucial part, whereas the prefixes and superscripts have only a minimal influence. In other words, everything that precedes the radical is generally of secondary importance from the point of view of pronunciation. • With the exception of the w a, the subscript consonants alter the pronunciation of the radical: The subscript ra produces the series ofretrofiexes: /tra/ (etc.). The subscriptya produces the series of palatal plosives: /kya/ (etc.) /cal (etc.) and /nya/. Combinations involving the letter la are pronounced /la/ at the expense of the radical (except in the case ofzl). • The three superscript consonants ra, sa and la, as well as the prefixed consonants ga, ba, ma and 'a (i.e., all but da) affect only the tone and aspiration of the radical. • Tones are not marked by special signs, but must be deduced from the radicals and affixes.

Using the dictionary Dictionary entries follow the alphabetical order of the thirty letters of the alphabet and five vowels a, i, u, e, o. To find a word in the dictionary, begin by locating the radical letter of the first syllabi~ according to alphabetical order. Then, if relevant, look for the initial consonant cluster (subscript, superscript and prefix), according to the procedure outlined below, then the vowel and finally the suffixes. To summarize: 1) Radical letter or initial consonant cluster (see below) 2) Vowel 3) Suffixed letter(s) Note: The subscript wa is to be found in dictionaries after the vowels: a, i, u, e, o, w. If the word is polysyllabic, the order of appearance of the second and following syllables follows the same principles. As for the initial consonants in a syllable, entries in the dictionary are classified under each , radical according to the following system: 1) Radicals without superscripts or prefixes a) without subscripts, b) with subscripts. The following sequence illustrates the order of appearance in the dictionary. zn·~· Ex.: 1 2) Radicals with prefixes (but without superscripts) a) without subscripts, b) with subscripts.

The different styles of writing The many styles of writing Tibetan may be grouped into two main categories: \"capital ~El''5~' udin (lit. \"with a head\"),62 used mainly for the purposes of printing, and ~E:1·~~1 ' (lit. \"without a head\"), which includes the various cursive and ornamental styles. The first of these -which is the one we shall use in this Manual -is standard throughout various countries and regions of Tibetan culture, from Amdo to Bhutan, Ladakh to Kham and the liturgical texts of the Mongols, Buryats and Kalmyks. The cursive script, by contrast, varies 1\\Jlli>1U'-'1.av•Y from one region to another. Central Tibetan cursive is slightly different from that of or Bhutan. In Amdo it is very little used at all, and people tend to write in ucan. Among the most important cursive styles are ~,~·mz:r tshu'yi', !:\\~·a)· tr~tsa, the usual style ~1·(ij~· khyu'yi', and the decorative~~· l~ntsa, which is used for Sanskrit.

This applies to the verb not only in the main clause but also in subordinate clauses (relative, causal, comple-mentary, etc.). The simple sentence may be broken down into three components: a subject noun phrase, an object noun phrase and the verb compiex (or predicate). 64 Usual word order is \"subject-object-verb\" (SOV). However, the object may precede the subject (OSV) in order to give special emphasis to the latter, or in the case of certain ques-tions. The emphasis is accompanied by a particular stress on the element that is being empha-sized, and by a rising intonation. tJ. this Compare: th~p book \"This is a book\" r~· to be th~p book ti this \"It's this book.\" r~· to be The only indispensable element in the sentence is the verb; the subject and object may be implied or omitted. The verb exhibits no agreement in terms of: -gender -number -person 63. This variant represents the way in which the people of Lhasa themselves pronounce the word. 64. Even though the notions of \"subject\" and \"object\" are not really appropriate in the case of languages such as Tibetan, these terms have been retained in this book for the sake of convenience."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"80 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN There is no distinction between the active and the passive voice. The neutrality of the verb and its lack of orientation mean that passive transformations are impossible. It is only the case particles that make it possible to distinguish between the agent and the person or thing that is acted upon· 65 1.3.2 The auxiliary verb ~l r~· and its negation 0-l'~l' m~re' The auxiliary r~' is similar to the verb \"to be\" in English. It can function either as an auto-nomous linking verb (or \"copula\"), or as the auxiliary of another verb. This is comparable to the English \"to be\" or the French \"etre\", which are both copulas (e.g., \"he~ mad\", \"il est fou\") and auxiliaries (e.g., \"he~ working\", \"il est arrive\"). Likewise, in the following Tibetan sentences r~'is a copula in the first and an auxiliary (associated with nominalizer pa) in the second: khong nyonpa r~· khong phep-pare' \"he is mad\" \"he came\" (literally, \"he is come\") As a copula, r~· .. expresses the nature or the essential quality of the subject. Note that r~· «to be» is used to express people's age (see also 6.4), just as in English. The verb~~: r~' is generally pronounced r~' (with a more open vowel) in sentences that have an interrogative pronoun. However, the Tibetan spelling remains unaffected. Questions are constructed by using the final interrogative particle t:.l~' pa (see Lesson 2): ~l·t:.l~] r~'-pa' \"is it?\", 0-l'~l·t:.l~] m~re'-pa' \"isn't it?\" Like other auxiliaries, the verb r~· and its negation m~re' are used to signify \"yes\" and \"no\". They may be preceded by the polite marker~~~· Ia'. 1.3.3 The demonstratives~~· tJ., ~· th~, 1:\"4'~· phaki The· demonstratives function both as adjectives and as pronouns. As adjectives, they always come after the noun (or after the noun phrase), and carry a case or plural marker as appropriate. tJ. kh~re r~' \"What is this?\" (\"This is what?\") shukku tJ. kh~re r~' \"What is this paper?\" shukku tJ.ntso kh~re ~· \"What are these papers?\" The demonstratives~~· tl (proximal), ~· th~ (medial) and 1:\"4'~' phaki (distal) denote three degrees of removal: nearby, distant and far-off, corresponding to the English expressions \"here\", \"there\" and \"over there\". 65. The neutrality of Tibetan verbs can be illustrated by comparison with nouns, which are intrinsically neither active nor passive. Thus the sentences \"Lobzang corrected the book\" or \"The book was corrected by Lobzang\" might be rendered as \"(there was) a correction (of) the book by Lobzang\"."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"81 The demonstratives tJ., th~ and phaki function as pronouns and adjectives. When used as adjectives, demonstratives always come after the noun (or after the noun phrase); they are given a case particle and, where appropriate, a plural particle. The demonstratives tj_ and th~ are employed not only to draw attention to something/ point out/ show something (deictic function), but also to refer to elements previously mentioned (ana-photic function) in a text or conversation. The expression phaki, however, is used only to indicate spatial distance. The demonstrative tj_ is linked to the present moment; th~, on the other hand, is associated with the past or the future, and with the notions of \"the beyond\" and the invisible.

Final interrogative particles are not used with the copulas and auxiliaries mentioned above when a sentence already contains an interrogative pronoun (such as kh~re \"what\", su \"who\", etc.). 67. Tibetan names often consist of two juxtaposed names. In Central and Western Tibet and in Khams names usually consist of four syllables, whereas in Amdo they tend to have three. People of aristocratic origin may also use a family name, and nomads too often make use of clan names. Among farming communities, there seems to be a historical trend whereby clan names are disappearing and individuals are identified instead by the name of the household in wJ;lich they were born. In the vast majority of cases, Tibetan personal names have an obvious meaning. Thus Lobzang means \"Excellent Mind\", Tshering means \"Long Life\", Nyima means \"Sun\", Dawa \"Moon\" and Lhagpa \"Mercury\"; the last three also denote the days of the week Sunday, Monday and Wednesday respectively, and are applied to people as appropriate to the day on which they were born. Dorje means \"Vajra\" or \"Diamond\", ThubtiiJ;J.. \"Buddhist Doctrine\", Rinchen Kyi \"Precious-Joyous\", Dh6ndrup Gyiil \"Victorious One Who Achieves His Aims\", and so forth. While the majority of names are gender-neutral, there are a few that are either specifically masculine (e.g., Dorje) or feminine (e.g., Drolkar). 68. Tibetan final interrogative particles may be compared to Burmese /'la/ and Chinese /mal. 69. From a historical point of view, the interrogative particles ngas and gas probably correspond to variants of the particle pas. The phonological assimilation rule is explained in Appendix 1, section 1."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"'5 •.. 86 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN However, with the verb yl_n, a final interrogative particle pa is sometimes used. If there is no interrogative pronoun in the question, the sentence ends with yln-pa', the interrogative form of the verb yln; if the question does contain an interrogative pronoun, the sentence ends in yln-pa or yln. Ex.: ~l''\\t::::'l%i'J'9~·tll~·l:.l~' khyerang k~kan yln-pa' ~·Ul~'l:.l' sO yl_n-pa = ~·til~· sO yln \"Are you a teacher?\" \"Who are you?\" Interrogative pronouns are usually placed directly before the verb. The pronoun kh!!re means both \"what\" and \"which\", and corresponds to the literary forms~· cT and 9r:::'kh!!ng (it is in fact derived from the latter). The interrogative pronouns kh!!re \"what\" and sO \"who\" may be doubled (9·~·9·~· kh~re kh9-re, ~·~· susu) to elicit an enumeration in the reply or to mean \"what types of ... ?\" or \"what kinds of ... ?\" 2.3.2 Number and the plural marker ~· tsh6 /-tso Number is never marked on verbs, adjectives or the majority of nouns. Plurality is usually implied either by context, or by quantifiers such as 31r:::·t.!· m9-ngpo \"many\", i£r:::·31• tshangma \"all\", F'4~· khasha' \"some, certain\", 9~~· nyT' \"two\", etc. However, there is a plural marker ~'-tso,70 which appears with demonstratives and personal pronouns: \"'~·~· tJ.tso \"these\",~·~· th~tso \"those\", t<l'~' phatso \"those, those over there\", rr:::·~· kh6ngtso \"they\", etc. The marker -tso by itself is used with nouns denoting people only when the people in question are specified/defined: ~·31·~· ama-tso \"the mothers\", l9'9~·~· k~kan-tso \"the teachers\", 8jCJ·~·CJ·~· 16ptrawa-tso \"the students\", etc. (but not *mothers, *teachers, etc.). The non-specific plural is not marked with the plural particle: ~'31' ama \"mothers\", l9·9~·k~kan \"teachers\". This suffix is not used with animals or inanimate objects: * e:l9'~' 1!,!'-tso \"[the] sheep\", * ~9·~·~· c6ktse-tso \"[the] tables\",* ~r:::·1lj·~· thangka-tso \"[the] thangkas\". Consequently, unambiguous renderings of the plural I indications of plurality require the use of demonstratives: e:i9'~·~· 1!,!' th~tso \"those sheep\", ~9:~-·~·~· c6ktse th~tso \"those tables\". Number is only marked once per noun or noun phrase; the marker, which is placed at the end of the group, is therefore never redundant.

In Literary Tibetan, as well as in some dialects (Tsang), a humilific form (bdag) is used for the first person. This form is not used in Standard Spoken Tibetan. In Literary Tibetan and in certain dialects (including Kham and Mustang), there are distinct forms for the exclusive (\"us, not including you\") and inclusive (\"us, including you\") first person plural. This opposition, too, is absent in Standard Tibetan. For the second person, it is safest to use the honorific form ~l· :!\\~' khyerang I ~l· :!\\~· ~· khyerangtso and r~· I r~· ~· kh6ng/kh6ngtso. The ordinary forms :!\\~' re:ng ''you\"' F' kh6 \"he\"' F' :!\\~' khorang \"he\" and 3r· mg or a:i·::t;~· mgrang \"she\" ip1ply familiarity.

In Standard Tibetan and many other dialects, as well as in Literary Tibetan, there is a special dual form for both personal pronouns and demonstratives: r::::·9~~· ngg,nyi' \"we two\", ~z:;.: :r:.,r::::·9~~· khyerangnyi' \"you two\", F'9~~· khunyi' \"the two of them\" ~·9~~· th~nyi' \"those two\". 3.3.2 \"Egophoric\" (rang ngos) auxiliary verbs Certain auxiliary verbs are associated only with the first person (singular or plural), irres-pective of the function of that person in the sentence, i.e., as subject, object or complement. The use of an \"egophoric\"71 auxiliary expresses the speaker's knowledge or personal intention, often directly implied in the event that is being described. Whereas this type of auxiliary does not occur in Classical Literary Tibetan, it plays an important role in the spoken language. The egophoric auxiliaries (and copulas) are: Olo' · $z:;· .. , -~ Y.!.n, 1 YQ' ~r::::·-nyong, l,-~· ko'. In contrast, all the remaining auxiliaries are neutral with respect to person: ~l·r~·, ~~9't~', tfj'l·~l'yg:re', ~r::::·-song, c:J~9'-sha' ng~ tgrce yln ng~ k~po ch~ng \"I am D01je.\" \"I was happy.\" ng~r th~p mgngpo yg' \"I have many books.\" ngg n~kcurtrg-nyong \"I have been (lit. gone) to Nagchu.\" ylke m~ngpo tang-payin \"[I] sent many letters.\" In all the above sentences, it is possible to dispense with the pronoun ng~, \"I\", in view of the fact that the first person is indicated by the auxiliary (or the copula). In the following sentences, the egophorics do not agree with the subject but with a com-plement: t~mi' tl ng~: Yln \"This key is mine!\" ifir::::·r::::s::. ·or:::· \"1' ~c:J~' ~· $z:;] ,.

Etymologically, \"egophoric\" signifies \"bearer of 'I' or '<ego\"'."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"94 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN ~E:·ii:!E:;·:rr::.:·fihn~~·c:·8)o-1 -., \\ fl' 1 ' ·1 1 '\"' 1 ti. khyerang-ki so:ca yln \"This is your tea (the tea that I made for you or that I intend you should drink).\" When the first person appears as an oblique complement (other than as a subject or object), the use of an egophoric auxiliary usually stresses the personal intention or the certainty of the speaker. Where there is no such emphasis, egophoric auxiliaries may always be replaced by neutral auxiliaries. For example, some of the above sentences may be rephrased as follows: t~mi' ti. ng~: r~' \"This key is mine.\" r::.:S:. 'SJ.'5i'·i6'c::rl:f1'~·~ AA'·~·trl£:;'~£:;1 ' '\"' ~ aJ <! \"':.1 ·1 , \"~ 11 ng~: ph\\,!mO laptra-la trg-kiyo:re \"My daughter goes to school.\" ~E:·ii:!E:;·:rr::.:·~·c:·~E:;'l ·-..~ \\ fl' 1 ' ·1 '\"' \"~ 1 ti. khyerang-ki chi! re' \"This is your tea (this is the tea that's yours).\" Whereas egophoric auxiliaries need not always be used with the first person, it is incorrect to use egophorics in statements that neither contain the first person nor express the speaker's per-sonal involvement. Finally, it should be noted that egophoric forms are used only when an auxiliary verb occurs in the main clause, but usually not in subordinate clauses. For the time being, the important thing to remember is that the auxiliary Ol<=>i' yin is used mainly for the first person, whereas the auxiliary ~~: r~' is used for the second and third persons. 3.3.3 The existential verb ~~Zl'j' t\\,!' and its negation 5l·~~·m.Lntu' The verb t\\,!', which depending on context may mean \"to have\" or \"there is\" or \"to be\", implies that the speaker is or has been a direct witness to whatever he or she is asserting. The verb will be described in detail in Lesson 6. 3. 3. 4 The rule of anticipation In the case of interrogative sentences that directly concern the person being addressed (that is, sentences containing second-person pronouns), the questioner must anticipate an answer containing an \"I\" or a \"we\" by making advance use of an egophoric auxiliary in the question itself. Ex... -ii:!E:;·:rr::.:·~?·c:l·8lo-·t.J~1 F\" 1 ·' · \\ · 1 khyerang t~po yln-pa -r::.:·:rr::.:·~?·:r:,f:>o-·j £>o1 I ' \\ '-l \"\" 1 c>< 1 ngi'!rang t~po yl.n mJ.n \"Are you well?\" \"I'm well I not well.\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Lesson 3-~c:ras~·,~3l'CJ] (16ptsan sOmpa) 95 This exchange might be rendered literally in English as \"Am you well?\", since the antici-reply, whether positive or negative, is \"I am well/ not well\". The rule of anticipation operates in a similar way, but with a reverse result, when the is asking a question about him-or herself. In this case, since the reply will of course con-a \"you\", the rule requires that the first person be represented by a neutral, not egophoric, -r:::·~~'CJ'~Ei;CJ~~ \"Am I mad?\" -~l· ~r:::·~~'CJ' (3l')~l1 ng~ nyonpa r~'-pa' khyerang nyonpa (ma) r~· \"You are (not) mad!\" A more literal English rendering of this exchange would be: -\"Are I mad?\" -\"You are(n't) mad.\" This \"anticipatory mood\" is a distinctive feature of Tibetan. It appears not only in Standard but in all other Tibetan dialects too, though not in the classical literary language. 3.3.4 The place of adjectives In the spoken language, adjectives always come after the nouns they describe, and may be followed by determinants such as articles and quantifiers: N. +Adj.+ Art. Although adjectives are invariable they have a long and a short form, a subject which will addressed in Lesson 17. Constructions involving an attributive adjective bear a superficial resemblance to construc-tions with a predicate adjective. nyuku n~kpo r~· \"The pen is black\", or \"(This) is a black pen\" The ambiguity may be avoided by using a demonstrative.

In English, these cases are represented by prepositions such as \"to\", \"of', \"in\", \"by\", or \"for\", or else are not translated at all. The system of cases in Tibetan is quite distinct from that of European languages such as Latin, Greek, German and Russian, for a number of reasons: • First of all, contrary to the case of these languages, the form of the noun itself remains invariable.73 Instead, it makes use of particles or suffixes that vary in form. For example, some Tibetan case suffixes vary according to the final letter (or sound) of the preceding word. • Literary Tibetan and to a lesser extent the spoken language show some features of agglu-tinative morphology. That is, the case suffixes and the other grammatical suffixes are added on in a series. For example, the plural is marked by a suffix distinct from case (unlike Latin or Russian, where they are blended together with each other and often with the noun stem). In the following 73. There are no exceptions to this rule in the written language, and very few in Spoken Tibetan."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"I I ,[ II il 100 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN sentences in Literary Tibetan, the head nouns Ius \"body\" and mkhas-pa \"learned\" are followed by three suffixes including a plural marker and then a case marker (genitive or agentive ): 01f~'t.l'~Ol~'~~·~c::· 01.,~,~· khapa-nam-kyi'-kyang m~ s.L' leamed-plural-agentive-additive negation see (H) \"Even the learned ones have not seen (it).\" lu '-can-ta'-ki Ia' body-possession suffix-plural-genitive karma \"The karma of those who have a body ... \" • Cases markers in Tibetan have a range of functions that are not confined to the noun, but also relate to the verb. Thus all case markers have two basic functions: a case-related function and a connective function74 (See the discussion on the ablative case in Lesson 9, and Appendix 1, section 3.3). When they follow a noun or noun phrase, they mark case, indicating the role of that noun or noun phrase in the clause or sentence. When the same forms are used after a verb or a clause, they serve as a connective function, indicating how two clauses are related (e.g., co-ordination, subordination, etc.). The following are the main case-related and connective functions: ,~ -ki ', the agentive case, traditionally referred to as 5z:;,· ~· /ch~tra/, literally \"agent-sound\", indicates the agent of the action (\"by\"), the instrument (\"with\"), the cause (\"because of', \"by\"), and the manner (\"with\"); this form also marks causal subordi-nate clauses, in which case it may be translated by \"since\", \"because\", etc. ,. -ki, the genitive case, traditionally referred to as ~12.1·~· /tr~:tra/, literally \"link-sound\", designates the complement of the noun, and is translated by \"of'; this form may also correspond to the conjunction \"but\" (L ), when it is used to link clauses. 74. Our presentation of case does not reflect the Tibetan grammatical tradition-which is based on Sanskrit, a sacred language for Tibetans (Sanskrit is an Indo-European language entirely different in its structures from the Tibeto-Burman languages). The Tibetan tradition usually mentions eight cases corresponding to the eight Sanskrit cases in the following order: 1'1 case: ngo-bo-tsam 'absolutive' (0), 2nd case: las-su bya-ba 'accusative' (la or its variants), 3'd case: byed-sgra 'agentive' or 'instrumental' (gis and its variants), 41h case: dgos-ched 'dative' (la or its variants), 51h case: 'byung-khungs 'ablative' (nas or las), 6th case: 'brel-sgra 'genitive' (gi or its variants), 7th case: gnas-gzhi 'locative' (la or its variants), gth case: 'bod-sgra 'vocative' (0)."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Lesson 4-M'c:ras~·q~·q1 (loptsan shjpa) 101 ~· -Ia, the oblique (or dative-locative) case, traditionally referred to as ~·~~· /l~ton/ lite-rally \"meaning of 'to\"', indicates the person or goal to which an action is directed, as well as place· and direction, and corresponds to the English prepositions \"to\", \"at\" or \"in\"; this form may also mark a subordinate purpose clause, where it is translated as \"to\" or \"in order to\". 0 the absolutive case, traditionally referred to as ~·q•;3o.J' /nggwotsam/, literally \"just the essence\", or \"the meaning in essence\", is the unmarked case. It denotes the patient, i.e., the person or thing that undergoes the action (in the case of transitive verbs), and the single participant (in the case of intransitive verbs). ~~· -na', the ablative case, traditionally referred to as (.:\\.§C::'fSr::::~·~·~· lc!::Jngkung-ki tr~, literally \"sound of the source\", indicates provenance (\"from\"); this form also marks causal or temporal subordinate clauses, where it may be translated by \"because\" or \"after\", or simply by \"and\". Another ablative marker ll.l~' -Ia' is also used in Literary Tibetan. However, this form is restricted to the use as a comparative marker in the spoken language. lr::::· -tang, the associative case, traditionally referred to as lr::::·~· /th~ngtra/75, literally \"sound of 'with\"', has the sense of \"with\", \"against\" or \"from\"; when it links clauses, this form may also mean simply \"and\", and may function as a temporal connective meaning \"as soon as\" (literary). • There is no agreement on the basis of function within the elements of a noun group or noun phrase: the case marker appears just once, at the end of the noun phrase, and there is consequently no redundancy. For example, if the noun is not followed by any qualification such as adjectives, demonstra-tives and so forth, the case particle is suffixed directly: lq~·C!~· ponpo' \"by the leader\" (agentive) lq~·C!·Il.l· ponpo-la \"to the leader\" (dative) But if the noun is qualified, the final element of the noun group is followed by a case particle: lt:l~·C!·~~·q·(.:\\~·~~~·~~· ponpo chenpo tJ.nyi'-ki' \"by these two great leaders\" lq~·C!·~~·q·(.:\\~'~~~·ll.l· ponpo chenpo tJ. nyT'-Ia \"to these two great leaders\" The case may be omitted in the literary language (mainly in order to preserve the metre in poetic writing) as well as in the spoken language, in circumstances that will be discussed below. 75. In traditional grammars, dang is not considered to be a case (rnam-dbye) but a particle (tshig-phrad). See Lesson 9.3.3 and Appendix 1, section 3.3 for an explanation of why it is treated as a case in this Manual."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"J 02 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN 4. 3. 2 The genitive ,. Traditional grammars refer to this marker as 'brel-sgra (lit. link sound, relation sound), and it is commonly translated in English as \"of'. The genitive has several variant forms depending on the final letter of the preceding word. These variants are: ,. gi, ~· gyi, ~· kyi, i'...· 'i: • after a vowel and a..

In Classical Tibetan, vowels and the letter 'a may be followed by the variant U)· yi /yi/; this is especially true in poetry, to suit the requirements of the metre. The three particles ,./khjj, ~· /kyT/, ~· /khyjj are pronounced in exactly the same way in conversation, as an unstressed syllable: /-ki/. The addition of the variant 'i to the vowel produces a lengthening of the latter in speech; in the case of /a, u, o/, the result is equivalent to the addition of an umlaut: a+'i >/a:/, u+'i > /0:/, o+'i /6/, e+ 'i > /e:/, i+'i > /i:/. Ex.: ~·0-1· /nylma/ \"sun\" > ~·o.1i'...· /nylma:/ ~·31· frlmo/ \"water\" > ~·a:ii'...· /rlmb:/ ~· /chu/ \"water\" > ~i'...· /chu:/ 3l· /mjf \"man, person\" > 3li'...· /ml:/ ~· /m~/ \"fire\" > ~i'...· /m~:/ 0-l~a.,· /tg,/ \"arrow\" > 0-l~i'...· /t~:/ ~,·f!io;· /k~kan/ \"teacher\" > ~,·f!io;·~· /k~kan-ki/ f!io;·~,~· /k~nla'/ \"teacher (H)\" > fli~·~,~·~·/k~nla'-ki/ ~r::_·U),· /thrl,!ngyi'/ \"secretary\" > ~r::_·U),.,. /thrl,!ngyi'-ki/ The genitive is used not only to form noun complements, possessive pronouns and adjec-tives, but also relative clauses. In this case, it may be translated by a relative pronoun such as \"that\", ''who\", ''where\", etc. The complement that is marked by the genitive always precedes the noun to which it refers. ng~: thrgkpo khong-ki cha'nyu' trashi'-la'-ki ph!,! lama: lopma \"my friend\" (lit. \"the friend of me\") \"his pen\" (lit.: the pen of him) \"Tashi's son\" \"the lama's disciple\" 76.

Remember that a case marker is always to be found at the end of any noun group (or phrase). The absolutive indicates the grammatical role of patient. This role typically refers to the animate or inanimate participant that undergoes or suffers a given action performed by an agent (in the case of transitive verbs),78 or a single participant in a process (in the case of intransitive verbs). In syntactic or relational terms, it designates both the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. Ex.: E;.'c':\\&r::::~r chg, thung' \"Drink the tea\", e;.·~·~·c':\\~,. chg, tshapo t~' \"The tea is hot\" In both these examples, the \"tea\" (chg,) is in the absolutive case. However, in the first sentence it is a direct object, while in the second it is the subject of the verb. By contrast, the sub-ject of a transitive verb is marked by the agentive case (see Lesson 8). 4.3.4 The imperative with the verb alone The imperative mood may be formed by means of a verb without an auxiliary. In most cases, as we shall see (Lesson 9), verbs in the imperative mood are followed by \"jussive\" parti-cles (see Lesson 19). Moreover, some verbs have a special form (an inflection) to mark the im-perative. 111-·'·;r·ilj· Ill 4.4 Exercises ~r::::·~<=>i1 4.4. 1 Translate into Tibetan: 1. There are some old books. 2.

These markers are: (.l-1' la, -~· -r: • After vowels or a, 'a • After all endings (consonants or vowels) 81. In Literary Tibetan, there are seven forms.

Note also that the variant -r is rarely used with monosyllabic words for the dative (except in the case of personal pronouns, as well as demonstrative and interrogative adjectives). Thus ~'\"'l'rl-la \"to the mountain\" is used in preference to~~· rl-r, and ~'\"'!' ph\\::1-la \"to the boy\" in preference to ~~· ph \\:J-r. • The locative is used to mark complements of place (with or without movement) or time (date, time), and is generally translated by English \"at\", \"to\", \"in\" or \"on\".

There are basically four moods:83 egophoric, testimonial, assertive and inferential. These four moods are used with any statement that conveys an information. The assertive auxiliary verbs r~· and yg:re' specify that the information being transmitted may be a general truth or a specific fact, and is something that is considered by the speaker to be certain. In general, the assertive implies that the speaker is letting it be known that while the assertion is certain, he or she has not personally witnessed it. Typically, the information has been obtained second-hand from some other source (reported speech, a book, the radio, etc.) or else forms a part of the speaker's general knowledge. However, it may happen that even though the speaker can personally testify to the validity of the assertion, he or she may use the assertive in order to present the statement as an objective or well-known fact. N.B.: The assertive mood should not be confused with the marker of reported speech, which may be used in combination with any of the four moods (see Lesson 15) and implies a measure of uncertainty (cf. \"it would seem that ... \"). Testimonial or \"sensorial\" auxiliaries such as t~' signify that the speaker has personally observed the fact or event he or she is reporting. The evidence is usually derived from the senses, most commonly sight or hearing, but occasionally also from the other three, as in the case of a pain suffered by the speaker. 84 In other words, the speaker is, or has been, a direct witness to what he or she is describing. Thus in Lesson 5, the use of the testimonial t~' suggests that Drolkar has actually been to Ladakh and witnessed the things she is talking about. The assertive and testimo-nial moods could be described as respectively objective and subjective, but as far as the speaker is concerned they are equally certain. The egophoric mood is linked to personal knowledge or intention on the speaker's part, and has been described above (see 3.4). Finally, the inferential mood (see 10.4) indicates that the basis of the speaker's assertion is an inference or a conclusion that is being drawn from the traces or the present results of a past action. NB.: Auxiliary verbs almost always come after the main clause, at the end of the sentence. On rare occasions they may be placed after subordinate clauses. ' 83. These moods are essential in Central Tibetan, and appear in different forms in several other Tibetan dialects (Dzongkha, Ladakhi, Kham, Amdo, Sherpa, etc.).

Ex.: According to the context or the situation, ll'~·O:S~·t.1~1 nyuku yg'-pa' may mean \"Have you got a/ the/ any pen(s)?\" However, this statement ought to be slightly modified: first, as we saw earlier, the use of the plural marker -tso implies that the (human) noun so qualified is definite, and that it should be preceded in the English translation by the use of the (plural) definite article 'the'. Secondly, Tibetan does indeed have a singular indefinite article cT' that is placed after the noun, but this is used only when the noun is specific: Ex.: ~~·~~·~9· k~kan cT' \"a (certain) teacher\", gj'r:::1·~·q·~9· loptrawa cT' \"a (certain) student\" but not when the noun is generic: Ex.: f'c::·~~·~~·'i:\\l khong k~kan re' \"he is a teacher\", but f'c::·~~·~~·~9·'i:\\~1 khong k~kan cT' r~· \"He's one (of the) teacher(s)\" The form of the indefinite article ~9· cT' \"a\" should not be confused with that of the cardinal number \"one\" 9~' cT', although the pronunciation of the two is the same. In Literary Tibetan, the indefinite article has three variants -~9·, ~9·, 49'-depending on the final letter of the preceding word. • after 9 g, ~ d, r:::1 b, and the da-drag • after vowels and r.l., 'a, c:: ng ~ n, ~ m, ~ r, ~ l • after~ s In the spoken language, only the form ~9· cT' is used. > ~9'cig leT'/ > ~9· zhig /shl'/ > 49' shig /shT'/ Finally, the demonstrative ~'th~ is often used in much the same way as a (specific) definite article in the European languages. Ex.: ~q·9~~'t.1'~'9't.l~'r.l.,~9 th~p sarpa th~ kh§par to' \"Where is that/ the new book?\" ~ ·q:::~c::·~·~~;~r~rc::·'i:\\~1 losang-ki pTnkya' th~ khong r~· \"He's the brother ofLobzang.\" 6.3.2 The importance of situation and context In languages in general, statements are rooted in a given situation or context. Tibetan is particularly sensitive to situation and environment, as well as the sources of information on which a speaker's assertions are based. It would be therefore appropriate to speak of a \"situational gram-mar\". For example, we have seen the use of evidential or \"mediatory\" auxiliaries (see 5.4) which reveal whether or not the speaker directly witnessed whatever he or she is stating to be the case."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Lesson 6-~z::ro5~·~,·~1 (16ptsan thrukpa) 119 When a statement cannot be immediately associated with a concrete situation of communication, Tibetans tend not to accept it or to find it strange. One consequence of this attitude is a reluctance to present verbs in a series of conjugations. For example, when the verb \"to be\" is \"mechanically\" conjugated -\"I am a student\", \"you are a student\", etc., Tibetan speakers will accept the first person without any trouble but often stop short at the second, since the absence of a marked into-nation makes it difficult for them to imagine a situation in which they would be telling someone, \"You're a student!\" since the addressee is obviously in a better position than they are to know this. 6.3.3 Essential and existential verbs Tibetan has several stative verbs or copulas corresponding to the verbs \"to be\" and \"to have\" in European languages. Two main categories may be distinguished: essential copulas, which denote an essential quality of the person or thing; and existential copulas, which express the existence of a phenomenon or a characteristic with the implication of an evaluation by the speaker.86 Furthermore, these \"essential\" and \"existential\" stative verbs are associated with various evidential moods, as we shall see presently. Note that they may be used for both the present and the past. 87 A) The essential copulas:~~,' r~', Ul~ yin, ~l·q~,·r~'-sha' These express the nature or essence of the subject ( equative meaning), or else an inherent quality of it (attributive meaning). They differ only in terms of the evidential mood that they convey (assertive, egophoric, testimonial, etc.). • The \"assertive\" copula ~l' r~· and its negation ~·~l· m9;re'. The copula r~' is usually translated by the verb \"to be\", and corresponds to an objective assertion or affirmation (see 5.4). The attribute of the subject, which immediately precedes the verb, may be a substantive (equative meaning) or an adjective (attributive meaning). Age is also expressed with the use of r~'. (.\\~'€j,z::::J'z::::J~~·~l1 rr:::·~,·~·~·~ll ~·~:~·q~~·~l1 ~·~r:::·~r:::·~·~·~ll r·~r:::·~~·~· ~·~l1 rr:::·~~~·q:;:Jr:::'~'~l1 tJ. thuptan r~· khong trgkpa m9:re' nyJ.ma IQ tQn r~' mgrang nyTngcepo r~' khorang nyonpa m9;re' khong sem' s9;ngpo r~· \"This is Thubtiin.\" \"He isn't a nomad.\" \"Nyima is seven.\" \"She's pretty.\" \"He isn't mad.\" \"He's kind.\" In rare cases, r~' may also be used to express an essential property or an inalienable pos-session of the subject, in which case it corresponds to the English \"to have\". 86. The distinction between existential and essential is similar to the difference between the verbs ser and estar in Spanish. 87. The present and the past have the same form, with the meaning depending on the context. However, as we shall see in Lesson 10.4, this applies only to the past imperfective: for the perfective past, there are specific forms."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"120 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Ex.: f'r=::·US~·ry~·ffi~·t:l·~l] khong ygntan chenpo re' \"He has great qualities.\" ~·~r:::·~,·~r:::·~r:::·~l1 rr:::·~·Olffi,·ffi~·t:l·~l1 mgrang mT'88 chungcung re' \"She has small eyes.\" khong amco' chenpo r~· \"He has big ears.\" • The \"egophoric\" copula: 8:1~ yln and its negation~~· m~n. The copula yln functions as an essential stative verb, normally associated with the first person (see 3.4), and is generally translated by \"I am\". The attribute of the subject may be a sub-stantive (equative sense) or an adjective (attributive sense). Ex.: t:::'&z::J'z::J~~·8:l~] ng~ thuptan yin \"I am Thubtiin.\" r:::·~,·Z:.J'OJ~] '\"ffi ng~ trgkpa yln \"I am a nomad.\" t:::'z::J~·t:]·BJ~1 ng~ t~po yln \"I am fine.\" In rare cases, they may express an intention or an insistence on the part of the speaker. khyerang ch~ yln th~ ng~: t~mi' yln \"It's your tea [that I'm intending to give you].\" \"That's my key.\" • The \"revelatory\" copula ~l'z::l~tlj r~'-sha' and its negation ~l·~·a_~tlj r~'-mlntu'. ~ The copula re' -sha' functions like an essential stative verb, implying that the speaker has just discovered or become aware of whatever he or she is asserting. It may often be translated by the verb \"to be\" preceded by some exclamation such as \"Why!\" or \"Hey!\" Ex... ~z::J'z::J~o·-:;.z::;,z::J<O.z:n \"l 7 , \"\" , 1 1 thuptan r~· -sha' ,., ;.:;' z:n·z:..r ':;>z::;·~·r:l z::;z:n ''\\::::/ 1 \"\" , ''\\..1 1 trgkpa r~'-mlntu' ~o;·z:.r-:;.z::;,z::J<O.z:n -~-, \"\" , 1 1 ny6npa r~'-sha' \"Hey! It's Thubtiin.\" \"No, he isn't a nomad.\" \"Why, he's mad! [I've just realized it]\" B) The existential copulas \"\"~tlj't!:!', USl·~l'yg:re' U5l'yg' These verbs express existence, location, or a circumstantial feature of the subject, often implying an evaluation on the speaker's part. These various stative verbs differ only in terms of the evidential mood that they convey (assertive, testimonial, egophoric, etc.). • The \"assertive\" copula USl·~l· yg:re' and its negation U5l'Ol'~l· yg:mare'. There are two other ways of writing USl·~l· yg:re', but the pronunciation is the same in each case: UStlj·~l· or US(.(·~l·, as well as a literary form U5l'!:..l'~l· ygpare'.89 The negative form of the auxiliary is U5l'01'~l· yg:mare', for which there are also two other written forms: tf5tlj'Ol'~l·and $(.(· Ol'~l' yg:mare', as well as a literary form usl'!:..l'Ol'~l· ygpa m~re'. 88. Note that mig is pronounced with a high tone. It is an exceptional case since the radical m does not have any prefixed or subscribed letter. 89. The variant yod-red has been retained here because it is the one most commonly used in contemporary writing. Moreover, the spelling is based on the etymology of the expression: yod-red is in fact derived from yod-pa-red, whereas the forms yog-red and yo 'o-red are purely phonetic."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Lesson 6-~z::ra:;~·~Zlj'~j (16ptsan thrukpa) 121 The copula yg:re'implies a definite assertion or affirmation by the speaker. According to the context, it may be translated as \"there is/are\" (existential sense) or \"to be at (a certain location)\" (situational sense), or by the verb \"to have\" (possessive sense). tions. phg'-la namtru yg:re' \"There are aeroplanes in Tibet.\" thuptan t~: yg:re' \"Thubtan is here.\" khong-la th~p m§:ngpo yg:re' \"He has many books.\" tshering-la mgtra yg:re' \"Tshering has a car.\" ngama phg'-la namtru yg:mare' \"In the past, there were no aeroplanes in Tibet.\" th~tu' tshering-la mgtra yg:re' \"At that time, Tshering had a car.\" Remember that constructions expressing possession are identical to existential construe-The copula yg:re' may also be translated by some form of the verb \"to be\" (attributive sense). This requires that the attribute of the subject that precedes the verb should be a qualifying adjective. Ex.: ~~·~~·~·c:J·(fll~~~ ~~·Zlj~r.Q'q'(fl~·~~~ ~~ffi·q·(fl~·~~~ tJ. nyTngcepo yg: re' tJ. sa:po yg:re' \"This is pretty.\" \"This is clear.\" \"This is hot.\" tJ. tshapo yg:re' It may not, however, be used with a noun: * f~·~·3:\\·il3\\~~~ khong ky§:mi yg:re' \"He is Chinese\". • The testimonial copula: ~~Zlj t!:,!' and its negation ~·~~Zlj mlntu' This copula indicates a past or present testimony on the speaker's part. In English, it is tnmslated by the same expressions as for yg:re', i.e., according to context as \"there is/are\" (exis-tential sense), \"to be at\" (situational sense), \"to have\" (possessive sense), or by the verb \"to be\" (attributive sense). The latter applies only when the verb is preceded by a qualifying adjective. Thus the only difference between t!:,!' and yg:re' lies in the different evidential moods they express (these moods have been described above). The translation of the following phrases would therefore be exactly the same as those given above: Ex.: C5~·r.Q·llj~ar~r~~Zlj &c:rq'if~·~~~·(~~'\\') ~~tlj r~·r.Q·~z::rO-l~·c:J·~~Zlj ~~·~~·~·q·~~Zlj phg'-la namtru t!:,!' \"There are aeroplanes in Tibet.\" thuptan ~: t!:,!' \"Thubtan is here.\" khong-la th~p m§:ngpo t!:,!' \"He has many books.\" tl nyTngcepo tu' \"This is pretty.\" r"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"122 ~~.,~(l.l·q·~~, ~~·$·r:l·~, MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN tj_ sa:po t\\,!' tj_ tshapo t\\:!' \"This is clear.\" \"This is hot.\" However, exactly as in the case of the assertive copula, it is impossible to say: * f'r::::·~·5)· ~, kh6ng ky9:mi t\\,!' \"He is Chinese\".

As is often the in languages with this SOV word order, there are no prepositions but postpositions. The head of relative clauses are usually placed after the relative clause. Moreover, the main clause, goes at the end of the statement, is always placed after the subordinate clause (object, etc.). The main information is therefore almost always deferred to the end of the sentence. Word order within a noun phrase is as follows: the substantive head comes first, followed the qualifying adjective, the article (or demonstrative adjective), the plural marker and the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"128 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN case. The case particle takes last place in the the noun phrase {although it may happen that the case marker is followed by the topicaliser ni). E ~·3l· x.: \"-> I ph!:Jmo girl ~~·~·q· nyTngcepo pretty I Noun+ [Adj.+ Det.+ Pl.]+ Case ~~;:;;· thetso+r those+ Dative \"to those pretty girls\" In Tibetan, then, there are no prepositions but only postpositions: the equivalents of \"in\", \"on\", \"with\", and so on all follow the noun to which they relate. We don't say \"in the water\" but \"water in\"; not \"on the table\" but \"table on\". Postpositions are always followed by a case particle, usually the locative case (but also sometimes other cases such as the genitive or the ablative). They also command the genitive, which is inserted between the noun group and the postposition. The structure of the prepositional phrase is therefore: I Noun90 +[Gen.:,.]+ Postposition+ Loc. ill' E.g., \"water of inside-in\", which would correspond to the English word order \"in [the inside of] the water\". Note: The postpositions are all clearly derived from substantives. They generally require that the preceding noun (or noun group) be followed by a genitive particle. While the genitive is always used when the preceding word ends in a vowel, its use is optional with certain post-positions when the preceding word ends in a consonant. This is particularly the case with: <>i~· ni!ng \"in\", ~~· ki!ng \"on\", ~c:r kYi!P \"behind\", o.!~<>i' tQn \"in front of'.

The past tense The past tense91 is formed by placing after the verb the expressions t:l' ~c;: pare' (assertive), t'.l'Ul~· payin (intentional egophoric) or ~Z::::'song (testimonial). In English these forms can be translated by the past or sometimes by the present perfect. The forms ~~~· payin/ t:l'~t:;; pare' are composed of the suffix t:l' pa followed by the essen-tial copula ~l· re' or ~~·yin. The intentional form payin may only be used with volitional92 verbs in In interrogative sentences which contain no interrogative pronoun (where, who, why, what, etc.), the egophoric form t:l'~~· payin is replaced by t:l~' pa'; in sentences where there is an interro-gative pronoun, t:l'~~· payin is replaced by t:l' pa . The auxiliary t:l'~l'pare' is used in narratives and stories, which is why it is sometimes described as the \"narrative past\".

For the per-fective93 past however, there are special forms. The following full verbs are used in the construc-tion of the (perfective) past: a:itlj~' cha' \"to become\", s~: ch~' \"to do\", z::::l~l· t~' \"to stay\", ~r:::::·chldng \"to happen, to obtain\". All these verbs correspond to the (perfective) past tense of the verbs Bl~· \"to be\" and (fj'l· \"to have\". For the sake of convenience, we may distinguish between essential and existential statements. A) Essential statements • When the complement of the subject is a substantive ( equative meaning), Tibetan uses the verb: Sl'ch~' \"to do\" (in the past stem94: s.~· ch~') or the verb a:itlj~'cha' followed by past auxilia-ries (in association with the various evidential moods: assertive, testimonial, egophoric ). Ex.: f'r:::::·g~·q·a:;tlj~·q·~l1 rr:::::·g~·q·a:;,~·~r:::::·1 rr:::::·~O-J·ffi·s~·qo~l1 r:::::·~O-J·ffi·s.~·q·Ul~1 khong nyonpa cha'-pare' \"He became crazy.\" (assertive) khong nyonpa cha'-song \"He became crazy.\" (testimonial) khong amci ch~'-pare' \"He became a doctor.\" ng9: amci ch~'-payin \"I became a doctor.\" Note: In the case of the imperfective past, the same form as the present is used: th~tu' khong amci re' B) Existential statements \"He was a doctor\" (lit. \"at that time he is a doctor\"). • Possession and existence are constructed with the use of the verb ~r:::::· chldng in the (per-fective) past tense (in association with the various evidential moods: assertive, testimonial, ego-phone). 93. The notions of perfective and imperfective aspects are explained in 10.4. Here we need only bear in mind that the imperfective past forms are equivalent to the present. 94.

The group are concerned with controllable actions, and are compatible with intentional auxiliaries as -payin (see 10.4) and \"jussive\" suffixes that convey an order or a suggestion (such as -ta or Moreover, these verbs sometimes have a special inflected form for the imperative. The verbs in the second class imply non-controllable processes which do not depend on the ect's volition, and are compatible with neither intentional auxiliaries nor imperative markers. non-volitional verbs, non-intentional auxiliaries such as -cung or -song must be used. In this .u ... '\"\"'\"'\"• volitional verbs are marked as \"[vol.]\", while non-volitional verbs are identified as ofvolitional verbs: z::J~~·q·Ul~Jta'-payin \"I looked.\" '?~·qUl~J ny~:-payin \"I went to bed.\" of non-volitional verbs: Ol~r:::~r:::·1 thong-cung \"I saw.\" ~~·4, to'-sh \"Look!\" ~~·4, nyg:-sh \"Go to bed!

The grammar of European languages does not make the opposition volitional/ non-volitio-pal. However in their vocabulary, they do differentiate between hear, see (non-volitional) and listen, look (volitional). As in other languages, a distinction is made between transitive verbs (or polyvalent verbs)99 and intransitive verbs (or monovalent verbs). Transitive verbs require an object, where-~· ta \"to look\" and Ol~r:::· thong \"to see\" are transitive whereas '?~· ny~: \"to go to bed, to lie down\" and 5,. /thra'/\"to recover (from an illness)\" are intransitive. In this Manual, whether a verb is transitive or intransitive will be indicated indirectly: for each verb, the case required for the subject and, where relevant, for the direct or indirect object 98. With some. non-volitional verbs which imply a certain degree of control, such as \"lose\" or \"fall asleep\", the imperative forms are also possible . . 99. In order to avoid the linguistically problematic notion of \"subject\" in Tibetan, verbs may be defined according to their valency, e.g., the number of participants they require. See the Glossary of linguistic terms."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"142 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN will be specified. Thus if an object is required, the verb must be a transitive one (see 8.3.2 below, \"The ergative construction\", as well as section 9.3). There are, then,3ltogether four basic classes of verbs: non-volitional intransitive, volitional intransitive, non-volitional transitive and volitional transitive. In the case of transitive verbs, a distinction may be made between those which require two participants (bivalent verbs) and those which require three (trivalent verbs).

The agentive is formed by adding an 's' to the genitive. The variants follow the same pattern as in the case of the genitive: ,~. gis, ~~· gyis, ~~· kyis, ~· s. • after vowels and r.l., 'a • after , g, t::: ng • after ~ d, z::J b, ~ s and the da-drag •after0n3lm ~r \"'11 -, ' ' > ~· s > ,~. gis > ~~· kyis > ~~· gyis /-'/ /khl'/ll /kyT'/ll In Classical Tibetan, vowels may also be followed by the variant 8l~· yis /yi '/, or even by the more archaic form ~~ 'is /-'/. I . In conversation, the three particles ,~ /khl'/, ~~/kyT'/, ~~·/khyl'/ are pronounced in exactly the same way, as an unstressed syllable: /-ki'/. Remember that adding the variant 's' produces a glottal stop (or a modulated tone) in the pronunciation, and that in the case of /a, u, o/, an umlaut 100. Pronunciations followed by the symbol!:!. correspond to a literary register or an accentuated reading of the particle.

In transitive clauses, this role typically matches the semantic agent or causer who performs an action on a patient, but also includes the agent of \"mental\" and \"verbal\" actions and the perceiver of a sensation. However, it does not refer to the experiencer of an emotion, which is marked as the patient (the absolutive or zero case). In syntactic or relational terms, the agentive particle generally marks the subject of transitive verbs governing an ergative construction. Most transitive verbs require an ergative construction but some non-volitional transitive verbs require other constructions (affective or pos-sessive, see Lesson 9.3). Ergative constructions may seem strange at first, to the extent that they work in the oppo-site way to accusative constructions in European languages (except Basque). However, even though ergative constructions are not familiar to speakers of European languages, they are as logi-cal as accusative constructions. As discussed in Chapter 4, the main point is that all languages need a mechanism or device to distinguish \"who does what to whom\", or, in other words, to dis-tinguish between the subject and the object of a transitive verb. In accusative European lan-guages, as well as in Chinese, it is not the subject that is marked, but the object, either by using a distinct accusative case marker (as in Latin and Russian), or by opposition in the sentence, i.e., being placed after the verb (as in French, English and Chinese)102• In English, for example, word 101. In traditional grammars, the first is referred to as the particle of \"the main agent\" (byed-pa-po gtso-bo), while the second is ref~rred to as the particle of\"the secondary agent\" (byed-pa-po phal-ba). 102. We may compare the same transitive statement in five different languages, which all operate according to an accusative model. Latin: ego Russian: ja I+Nomin.

Tibetan chooses to mark not the object, but subject of the transitive verb, by using a distinct case marker -the ergative. It is called sc;;~·~~·t:J· byed sgra gtso bo \"main ergative\" in the traditional grammars. A subject that is marked by the ergative is almost always a human or other animate. The object lacks an overt formal marker (0); in linguistic terminology this is known as the \"abso-lutive\", and in traditional Tibetan grammars as ~:t:l·~CN· ngo-bo-tsam, \"just (the word) in the ab-solute\".

In view of the importance of aspect in Tibetan, it may be good to have a work-definition of the term, following a reminder of what we mean by \"tense\". Tense is defined most immediately with respect to the moment of speech utterance. \"h\"·~\"'\"''\" precedes this moment is the past; everything that coincides with it is the present; and follows it is the future. Aspect is concerned primarily with whether the action has or has not been completed with to a given point of reference (past, present or future). According to the chosen pers-the process is regarded as perfective, that is completed, or else as imperfective, meaning it is still going on or is a habitual event. (In either case the point of reference need not be the . This is an adjectival suffix. The category is dealt with in Lesson 17. ::r 'il ' :li"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"162 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN present.) This explains why, in many languages, the imperfective bears a strong resemblance to the present: both the present and the imperfective past are non-completed.108 The action is regard-ed as still going on, and is seen as being incomplete from a given point of reference (respectively, the present and the future). In Tibetan, the present and the imperfective past are identical, whereas the perfective past is entirely different (see Lesson 6.4). Only context makes it possible to distinguish between the present and the past imper-fective. For example, the sentences below convey a present meaning. ky~ntsan-la' emci r~· \"Gyantshiin is a doctor.\" khong ny9;mlen m9;ngpo ch~'-kiyo:re' \"He practices a lot. \"109 khong lhasar yg:re' \"He is in Lhasa.\" tshering pentsokang n9;ng-la l~ka ch~'-ki yo:re' \"Tshering works in the library.\" However, if each of these sentences were preceded by ~·~~·th~tu' (\"at that time\") or ~~'OJ' ngama, they would correspond to the past imperfective (without any transformation of the verb). Ex.: ~·~~·~~·Olei)~·~,~·i!.lOJ·a5·~l1 th~tU' ky~ntsan emci r~' \"At that time, Gyiintshiin was a doctor.\" (same as: Gyiintshiin is a doctor) ~·~~·rt:.:·~·~~·url~l1 th~tu' khong lhasar yg:re' \"At that time he was in Lhasa.\" (same as: is in Lhasa) ~~~·f't:.:''?Ol~·il)~·Olt:.:·aJ·sl·~·trrl·~l1 th~tU' khong ny~mlen m~ngpo ch~'-kiyore' \"At that time, he used to practice a lot.\" (same as: He practices a lot) ~~·Ol· ffi·~t:.:·l2l·Ol~lT~t:.:·~t:.:· ~· ~~·'1·sl·~·trrl· ~l1 ngama tshering pentsokang n9:ng-la l~ka ch~'-ki yg:re' \"Before, Tshering worked I used to work in the library.\" \"Perfective\" means that an action is regarded as being finished (from a present, past or even future point of reference ).no 108. In English for example, the progressive formed with the present participle \"ing\" and the auxiliary \"be\" corres-ponds to an imperfective aspect. The progressive past, present and future are all formed with the same present parti-ciple. I.e.: was practic-ing, is practic-ing and will be practic-ing. 109. In the present and the future, the mark for the agent is often left out. See the \"remarks\" section in Lesson 12. 110. More precisely, with the imperfective aspect, no limit of the process is overstepped or reached, while with the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The last two examples become in the perfective past: khong-ki' ny9,mlen m9,ngpo ch~'-pare' \"He practiced a lot.\" 163 tshering-ki' pentsokang n9,ng-la l~ka ch~'-pare' \"Tshering worked in the library.\" • The perfective aspect may be subdivided into perfect and aorist (or non-perfect). The signifies that the effects of an action performed in the past are still relevant at the moment statement is made, while in the case of the aorist, the past action being referred to bears no . h 111 ''\"~\"•vu'\"·uv to t e present moment. In Tibetan, as in English, there is a grammatical opposition between aorist and perfect. In English, the aorist is marked by the preterite while the perfect is marked by the \"present F'~9·q~~ru:f~J khala' sg'-yo' \"I've prepared the meal.\" (it's ready, we can eat) F·~rn·q::.::~·z: . .rB.lo-1 1 ::::! -1 khala' sg'-payin \"I prepared the meal.\" (last time, some time ago, etc.) The perfect aspect will be described in detail below in 10.3.3. 10.3.2 Verb inflection In Classical Tibetan many verbs have up to four different root forms (see Appendix 1). Spoken Tibetan makes indiscriminate use of verb stem forms that correspond to the \"future\" and the \"present\" in Literary Tibetan, and at the most only distinguishes between two tenses: the past and the present-future. While some verbs also have a distinctive imperative stem, in most cases this stem resembles either the present-future or the past. Very often, the verb is quite simply inva-riable (see Appendix 1, section 3.6). perfective the final limit (or sometimes the initial limit) has been reached. The above definition is based on D. Cohen's theory in !'Aspect verbal (1989). Let us quote here also Comrie's definition of these aspects: \"The imperfective pays essential attention to the internal structure of the situation\". \"Perfectivity indicates the view of a situation as a single whole: Comrie (1987: 16). The French imparfait, Spanish imperfecto, Russian imperfective (ne s overS enny j vi d), the English progressive all bear the basic features of the imperfective, while the French passe compose, the Russian perfective (s ove denny j vi d), the Spanish preterito all bear the basic features of the perfective. The English preterite however is neutral and may be translated depending on the context either by perfective or imperfective forms in other languages. 111. The opposition between the perfect and the aorist in Tibetan corresponds to the oppostion we find in literary French between the passe compose and the passe simple; in English between the present perfect and the preterite, and in Spanish between the preterite and the passado compuesto \"composed past\". 112. In Tibetan, however, this opposition is not as pervasive as in English. The simple past perfective may convey both perfect and aorist meanings in the absence of specific perfect form."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"164 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN The large number of invariable verbs means that inflection is practically obsolete in the spoken language. Tenses are formed by using a system of auxiliaries. In this Manual, the present-future stem form will be marked by the number (1), the past by (2) and the imperative by (3). 10.3.3 The perfect auxiliaries or~:~~: yg:re', q\"'\\~ sh~' (or t\":\\~~·t\\;!') and or~: yg' are directly connected to the past tense form of the main verb. These auxiliaries respectively represent the three evidential moods: asser-tive, inferential and egophoric. khangpa sarpa m~ngpo ky~p yg:re' \"Many new houses have been built.\" khangpa sarpa m~ngpo ky~p-sha' \"Look! Many new houses have been built.\" ng~' ch~ sg'-yg' \"I've made the tea.\" The range of the perfect forms is presented in the following table: The perfect tense auxiliaries affirmative interrogative interrogative negative negative (without pronouns) (with pronouns) interrogative 01l 01~·q~· 01~· ~~· ~~·q~· yg' yg'-pa' yg' me' m~'-pa' q\"'\\~' jt:\\~~· t\":\\~~·~~· t\":\\~~· &l·~~· &l·~~·~~· sh~'/t\\;!' tu'-ka' to' mintu' mintu'-ka' 01~·~~· or~·~~·q~· 01l~~· 01lOJ'~l 01~'0J' ~lq~· yg:re' yg:re'-pa' yg:ra' yg:mare' yg:mare'-pa' • The inferential perfect. The auxiliary q\"'\\~ bzhag /sh~'/ is sometimes spelled shag 4~· /sha'/, but here we shall use the former spelling for etymological reasons: the word is derived from the verb bzhag, which means \"to put, leave\". As a general rule, the use of the form -sha' (or its variant t\\;! ') implies that the speaker is making an \"inference\" or a deduction in discovering the result or the enduring traces of a past action. Most of the time, the inferential mode may be translated into English by adding \"Look!\", \"My!\" or \"Why!\" to the beginning of a statement in the past tense. In the example given above, it's upon discovering a construction site in a sector of Lhasa that the speaker says \"Why, they've"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Lesson 10-~z::ra)~·t::~~'l:.l1 165 built a lot of new houses!\" In certain contexts, the form -sha' may have another, purely resultative connotation: the speaker may use it to emphasize the enduring presence of a past action, even if he or she has been able to see not just these traces but the entirety of the action that is being described. \"Lobzang is here (lit. has stayed here).\" In this statement, the speaker has just discovered Lobzang's presence either by seeing him directly or from various clues (his hat, for example). Alternatively, he might have been aware of his presence for some time but is emphasizing the fact that he is still around. • The assertive perfect The assertive perfect refers to a past action or event with current relevance. Its evidential function is to convey certainty though the speaker does not claim to have personally witnessed the event. rz:IC::'I:.l' l:!l~:r''I:.J' 0-lC:::'t:i'' t::lffit::l' tl:lc::· ~E:;'l 1 1 . ' ~ \\ \"'\\ \\ khangpa sarpa m9:ngpo ky9:p yg:re' \"Many new houses have been built.\" • The egophoric perfect Unlike the inferential perfect (and to a certain extent the assertive perfect), the egophoric perfect auxiliary is not widely used. The use of this auxiliary is a complex matter, and it is res-tricted to a small class of volitional verbs. For example, with the non-volitional verbs ~· na \"to be sick\" or 0-l~c:::· thong \"to see\", the egophoric perfect aspect may not be used. Even some volitional verbs such as =:!' \"eat\", 'fi'\"look\" are not compatible with the egophoric perfect. In this case, one must instead use the perfective forms. c::·~·~c::·1 ng9: n9:-cung \"I fell ill, I have fallen ill.\" and not* c::·~·tl:ll1 c::~·Ol~c::·~c::·1 ng~' thong-cung \"I saw, I have seen.\" and not * c::~·Ol~c::·tl:ll1 c::~·r·~,·t::~=:J~'I:.l'Ul~1 ng~' khala' s~'-payin \"I ate, I have eaten the food.\" and not* c::~·r·~,'t::l=:J~'u:rl1 c::·S~'I:.l'Ul~1ng9: chTn-payin \"I have gone (there).\" and not* c::·s~·u:rl1 However with some volitional verbs113 such as t::l~'\"prepare\", ~· \"write\", ~l'\"stay\", etc. the egophoric aspect frequently occurs. \\\\Ex.: c::~·r·~,·t::~gg ~·u:rl1 c::~·U)·,·s~·u:rl1 ng~' khala' sg' yo' \"I have prepared the food.\" (the food is here, ready) ng~' ylke thrl'-yo' \"I have written the letter.\" (the letter is here) 113. In most cases, the compatibility of the perfect depends on whether the object of the transitive verb (or the subject of an intransitive verb) exists objectively after the completion of the action and is still present."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"166 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN ng9; n9;ng-la t~'-yo' \"I have stayed at home.\" (I am still there) Note: The negative forms of the egophoric and assertive perfect auxiliaries are more widely used than the affirmative forms. They are often even preferred to the simple perfective, and may occur with non-volitional verbs. Thus, negation in the past tense blurs the distinction between the perfect and perfective aspects. For example, r::::·~~·~~1 \"I haven't gone\" is more commonly heard than r::::·ar~~1, and simi-larly, f'r:::::·~z::~~·~~·0-1·~~1 \"He hasn't gone\" rather than f'r::::'a.l'~z::J~'z:.J'~~1-Nevertheless, perfective forms may be used to emphasize the subject's refusal to perform the action: r:::::·cr:::::~')0-1'~~1 \"I didn't go (even though I was supposed to).\"114.[deontic modality] 10.3.4 Auxiliary verbs and the system of tenses Tense-aspects are formed by combining two kinds of marker: verb inflection, as described above, and the use of a system of final auxiliaries. In view of the large number of invariable verbs, oral Tibetan makes extensive use of these auxiliaries. The latter indicate both the tense-aspect and the evidential nature of a given statement, which thereby reveals the source of infor-mation from which its authority is derived. As far as tense-aspect is concerned, Tibetan distinguishes: future, present (similar to the imperfective past), perfective past and perfect. Reminder: auxiliaries usually go after the main verb, i.e., at the end of the sentence and only rarely within subordinate clauses. The system of auxiliary verbs is summarized in Table 3 of Appendix 6. 10.3.5 Auxiliary verbs and evidential modalities Auxiliaries have the same evidential categories as copulas (see 5.3 and 6.3): testimonial, assertive, egophoric and inferential. A) The assertive The assertive corresponds to a definite item of information, or else a historical or general truth (see Lesson 5.3). This mood may be used in all the tenses: future~·~~·, present ~·~~·~l· and past z:.J'~l·· Note that the present includes forms similar to the future that denote a habitual state of affairs or a general truth (see Lesson 24.3). kh9;ng' tang-kire' \"It's going to snow.\" 114.

The authority is usually visual, but may also be aural or derived from any of the senses (touch, smell or taste). This mood appears only in the present with~·~.~...~,. and in the with ~c:::·. It does not appear in future constructions because of the impossibility of witnessing hasn't already happened! kh9;ng' tang-song kh9;ng' tang-kitu' \"It snowed.\" (I saw it snowing) \"It's snowing.\" (I can see it snowing) ~t::::~'t:li)C:::'~t::::'1 ~z:;~·t:Jryc:::·~·~.~...~, ~·a:r·~c:::·~·r:r·~,·s~·~c:::·1 rlmo nyTng c~po cT' thrl'-song \"He drew a pretty picture.\" (I saw him drawing it) With volitional verbs and most non-volitional verbs, the testimonial mood is used essen-for the second and third persons (singular and plural), except in special instances of self-(looking in the mirror, dreaming, watching a video recording of oneself, etc.) or per-z:;·* .:r''S)''hlt::::•z:n.:r·\"' ~.f:n.,., z:;z:n -'1 ' ~ aJ 1 '.,~ 'I '''-..1 1 ng9: ngrpu lingkar trg-kitu' \"I'm going to the Norbu lingka.\" (I see myself going there in a dream, in a film, etc.) z:;~'4't:J=:J~·~c:::·1 ng~' sha s~'-song \"(Dammit) I've eaten meat.\" z:;~'\"'8't:J~z:;·~c:::·1 -''~ 1 ng~' p~ sa'-song \"I've killed an insect.\" (accidentally) These sentences are usually constructed with intentional auxiliaries. On the other hand, when the testimonial mood is associated with certain non-volitional verb forms, particularly of perception (such as ~· khg to hear, 0-l~t::::· thong to see, o;· n§; to be ill, etc.) and affect (such as l,l.l...k§; love, ~l'sh~' fear), it appears naturally with the first person, and more rarely with the second and third (in which case reported or inferential speech is preferred).

C) The inferential The inferential mood z:::l~~· implies that the authority for what is said is derived from the enduring traces or results of a past action. Even if the speaker has not taken part in the event being described, he or she considers it to be definitely factual. kh~ng' tang-sha' \"Look, it's snowed!\" (I can see the traces) rlmo nyTng c~po cT' thrl'-sha' \"He's drawn a pretty picture.\" (I've just come across it) th~rco' sarpa m~ngpo tsu'-sha' \"They've put up a lot of prayer-flags.\" po' m~ngpo par-sha' \"(Look!) they've burned a lot of incense.\" (we can smell it, and see the ash) The inferential is rarely used with the first person.

The final auxiliaries include several kinds of egophorics: intentional, receptive, habitual, experiential (see Lesson 15) and allocentric (see Lesson 23). o Intentional egophoric These imply that the subject-speaker is performing an action deliberately and may be used only with volitional (or controllable) verbs. The intentional auxiliaries are: ~·b:l~· -kiyin(future ), ~· tG'~; -kiyo' (present), c_rb:l~· -payin (perfective), ur~:-yo' (perfect). t::::~· l:lrc:>l'c.J'<::i'·E'l·b:jo-1 \"I'll buy some tsampa.\" \"' 1 ·1 1 ng~· tsampa nyg-kiyin t::::~· l:lr\"•·q·a'~·urt::::l h -o~ 1 1 ng~· tsampa nyg'-yo' \"I've boug t some tsampa.\" (perfect) t::::~· l:lrc:>l'CJ'c::i'~·qob:jo-1 b -o 1 1 ng~· tsampa nyg'-payin \"I ought some tsampa.\" (perfective) t::::·~ :r''8_''frtt::::•rz:J:r'f'l ;;:;'·E'l·i:fl~::;] -~, \\ ~ ii.1 1 · \\ '\"\"\"~ ·1 1 ng9: ngrpu lingkar trg-kiyo' \"I go (or I am going) to the Norbu t::::~· fj'r::l::J~·q·b:j~1 t::::~'f.\\E:r'r::J~l·q·b:j~·1 o The receptive egophoric ng~· sha s~'-payin ng~· P\\d sa'-payin lingkha palace.\" (now or habitually) \"I ate some meat.\" \"I've killed an insect.\" (intentionally) The \"receptive\" (non-intentional) auxiliary ~t::::· ch\\:jng, which is used only in the perfective past, implies that the subject-speaker has undergone the action, perceived it (involuntarily) or has been the recipient of it. This auxiliary is associated with the first person pronoun, whether as a subject (\"I\"), direct object (\"me\"), indirect object (\"to me\") or adverbial (\"at my place\", etc.). It may also signify that the action is directed (actually or metaphorically) towards the speaker. Thus we can't say: * t::::~·q~,~·~t::::'1 \"I've lost (it)\" but rather t::::~·q~,~·~t::::'1 since the verb \"to lose\" im-plies a \"distancing\" from the speaker. t::::·~·~t::::'1 r~·t::::·~·r·q:t:;'r::J ryt::::· ~t::::'1 t::::~'f.\\~f.\\',~C>l'o.J~t::::·~t::::'1 rt::::·~~·t::::·~~·rt::::·~·~l·~t::::'1 ng9: n9:-cung \"I fell ill.\" kho' ng9:-la khapar tang-cung \"He phoned me.\" ng~· c9: sum thong-cung \"I saw three rainbows.\" khong-ki' ng9: mankang-la thrT'-cung \"He took me to the hospital.\" It is sometimes possible to replace the receptive egophoric auxiliary by the testimonial as shown below, with a subtle distinction in their meaning. ng~ ha khg-cung ng~ ha khg-song \"I understood.\" or \"I have understood.\" \"I have understood.\" Gust right now) The use of cung indicates that the verbal action (or process) may have happened some time before the moment of speech, while the use of the testimonial song suggests that it has just hap-pened just now."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"170 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN • The habitual egophoric The auxiliary ,.U!l kiyo' is used with reference to habitual facts that involve the \"IJ\"'\"\"';a ng~ n~-kime' \"I'm never ill.\" ngama ng~ y~kpo thong-kiyo' \"Previously, I used to see well.\" ng~: ph~mo laptrar trg-kiyo' \"My daughter goes to school.\" khong ng~: n~ng-la y~ngse phe '-kiyo' \"He often comes to my place.\" 10.3.6 Questions with alternative interrogative Questions involving alternatives, such as \"Would you like this or that?\", are formed by cing the final interrogative particle~ -ka (for the future) and 1:.1 -pa (for the past) after each of alternative sentences. so:ca kya'-ka khopi kya'-ka \"Shall I bring you tea or coffee?\" chamcam-la phep-ka n~ng-la sh~'-ka \"Will you go for a stroll or will you stay in?\" This formulation is sometimes referred to as a consultative construction.

A) Epistemic copulas Tibetan contains an important set of epistemic stative verbs (or copulas). These do not vary according to tense-aspect. As in the case of declarative stative verbs, a distinction is drawn be-tween existential and essential epistemic copulas. The former are derived from the verb yg' and the latter from the verb yJ.n. • The existential copulas: ffi~il:.l'l.l...S: ygpatra and the negatives: ~l'l:.l'I.J...5' m~patra • The essential copulas: ~~'l:.l'l.l...5'yjppatra and the negatives: ~~'l:.l'I.J...5'm~npatra These copulas express a high degree of probability and according to the context may be translated by the use of adverbs such as \"surely\", \"probably\" or the modal verb \"must\". ml m9,ngpo ygpatra \"There must be a lot of people.\" trgkpa ygkire' \"There must be some nomads.\" khong ky9:mi ylnkire' \"He must be Chinese.\" There is a slight difference between the auxiliaries formed with \"'5' tr9: and those formed with ~l· r~·.

Other auxiliaries such as ffil·l.l...~' · ygtro, z:rtril· payo', c.wtril· ayo' are presented in Lessons 18, 28 and 29. B) The epistemic auxiliaries These auxiliaries are effectively similar to copulas and may also be translated by the same devices. How they are used depends on the tense of the verb.

Nominal-converts a verb or even an entire clause into a noun (or rather a noun phrase). It is an im-and complex feature of Tibetan grammar. The commonest suffixes are: z::r pa; ~· ky!:!;, 0-lf~· khan, ~· sa, ~z:::::~· tang, ~\"-1' tshu:, ~ \"-1' so:, '(*L) and~,. nkyg' (*L)117• \"·''···'nv,,.ofthese suffixes are used for three main purposes: • They form nominal clauses118 functioning like any noun phrase as subject, object, complement, etc. The nominalized verb (or the proposition) becomes the head of the noun phrase: i.e., it operates as a noun and may be followed by a demonstrative and a case marker (see 11.3.3 below and Lessons 18, 20, 25, 40). · • They form relative clauses119 functioning as modifiers of noun phrases like an adjective (see Lesson 26). • Finally, it may be noted that most of these nominalizers may combine with final auxiliary verbs to form inflectional endings: z:.r8l~ pa+yln (see Lesson 7.3.2), 1!-lf~·U)~· khan+yln (see Lesson 20.3.1), ~·U)~ ky!:! +yin and Ul,·U)~ y~'+yln (see Lesson 28.3.1), etc. 11.3.3 The nominalizers Ul,. ya' and~· kyu The suffixes ya' and kyu are associated only with the present-future form of the verb. ~·Ul,. sh!:!-ya' but not* ~~·Ul,'sh!:!'-ya' El'Ul,'s~-ya' but not* z:::J::J~'Ul,. s~'-ya' z:::J~'Ul,. ta-ya' but not* z:::J~~·Ul,. ta'ya' The suffix Ul,. -ya', which is sometimes spelled Ul~' -ya', does not occur in Literary Tibetan, instead uses the nominalizer z:.r pa. The form~· -kyu, on the other hand, is used both in Tibetan and in the literary language. •The functions ofUl,. ya' Verbs followed by the nominalizer ya' indicate the present, future or imperfective past epetl<1Irtg on the context. Furthermore, they often convey a sense of obligation ( deontic sense). The nominalizer ya' is used to form nominal and relative clauses. A distinction needs to be between two functions: All these nominalizers are used in Literary Tibetan with the exception of ya' and nkyo'. The latter is used · in a familiar register, and despite the frequency of its occurrence doesn't figure in grammars. The spelling here is purely phonetic. All the other suffixes are clearly derived from nouns and have kept a grammatical role with their original meaning. In English, nominal clauses correspond to that-clauses, ing-clauses and infinitive clauses. See 11.3.3. In English, relative clauses are introduced by wh-pronouns or that (including zero-that). See 26. 3.1."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"178 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN The nominalizer indicates the grammatical patient of the verbal action (the object of a transitive verb or the subject of an intransitive verb) in the present and future.120 ~·tl.l~' \"that (which) needs to be written, that (which) one writes\", 1':\\~ll.l'tl.l~' (L.: 1':\\~ll.l'tl.l~') \"that (which) is to be offered, that (which) one offers\", OlE~P-l'tl.l~' \"that (which) is to be visited, that one visits\", q~·tl.l~' \"that (which) is to be built, that (which) one builds\".

In this case, the suffix is not oriented towards any grammatical role and nominalizes the entire clause. From a syntactic point of view, the nominalized verb functions as a head noun and may be translated in English by a verb in the infinitive, by an ing-clause, a that-clause or even by a noun: ~·tl.l~· \"(the fact of) writing\", ~ll.l'tl.l~(L.: 1':\\~ll.l'tl.l~) \"(the fact of) offering\", Olr=;:ll.l'tl.l,. \"(the fact of) visiting\", q~·tl.l~' \"(the fact of) constructing, construction\". ?q·iiJ :r· tl.lzn' 1::1~~· q~zn Ex.: \\ !\"\"' 1 =;: 1 1 1 \"I've forgotten to bring the book.\" 1G'q·~c;::·?!~·tl.lzn·?·znll.l·~o;·q·-:..~.] ~ ~ ~ 1 1 · \\ 1 · 1 \" 1 \"Studying is very important.\" ~ffi'o;· q· ;;;c;::· ;;;c;::'Olt::::' q' 'Ol='ll.l'tl.lZll'\"' ~zn 1 ·1 1 '<:5 '<:5 \"\" 1 '\"'\\1 1 \"There are many small monasteries to visit.\" Only the syntactic context allows one to distinguish between the neutral nominalizer and the patient-centered nominalizer. • The functions of~· kyu Verbs followed by the nominalizer -kyu correspond to the future or the imperfective, often with a sense of obligation. The functions of the nominalizer -kyu are analogous to those of -ya', though it has more formal, and rather literary, overtones.

The conditional is formed by adding the particle ~· -na \"if' to the verb in the subordinate clause or to its auxiliary. The particle -na is combined with auxiliaries in the following cases: url·~'yg'-na, ~~,·~· t!,!'-na, ~~·~·yln-na, but the following combinations are incorrect: *~l·~·r~'-na and *tfj'l·~l·~· yg:re'-na. The protasis (the \"if' clause) may be preceded by the expression ,(.I,J.~l· kh~:si'. There are basically three types of constructions, corresponding respectively to the present, past and \"future\" conditional. • The present conditional expresses a situation that has not occurred, but that remains a possibility at the time the statement is made; or else a pure hypothesis, about the likelihood of which the statement has nothing to say. In this case the verb in the subordinate clause appears in the past tense optionally followed by the past auxiliary z:.r~~·125 and the main clause verb is in th~ future tense. The structure may be represented as follows: ,(.I,J.~l· [ ... ] V (past)+ ~· [ ... ], V + AUX (future) tn(.I,J'~z:;· z::r~o·o· 1 1 [ ... ] V (past)+ \\ \\ [ ... ], V + AUX (future) These constructions, which translate both the conditional and indicative moods of English, !re by far the most commonly used in Tibetan to formulate conditionals. They are also sometimes used to express past and future conditionals. Ex.: s·~(.I,J·a:)r:.::·orCl::J~'~·~l·F,.~.,.~ll chJ.ri: tshangma s~'-na thrgko' n~-kire' \"If he ate all the sweets, he would have a stomach ache.\" s·~(.I,J·a:)r:.::·OJ·Cl::J~·I:.l·~~·~·~l·F,.~.,.~ll chJ.ri: tshangma s~·-payin-na thrgko' n~-kire· \"If he ate all the sweets, he would have a stomach ache.\" ~OJ'(.I,J'~'~,~·Cl~Cl'~''5'(.1,1,'Clal,.,.OJ'~ll k~m-la kgca' ky~p-na cala' la'-kimare' \"If you close the box with a padlock, the things won't be lost.\" ~l~r:.::·,~·~·~·Cl~r:.::·~·r:.::~·~·,·~~~ \"If you were to sell your car, I'd buy it.\" 125. The auxiliary pa-yin may be used with any verb class (volitional or non-volitional), although sometimes auxiliaries such as byung-na or song-na may also be used. There is a slight difference between the two when the verb is followed by the auxiliary pa-yin, it can indicate a mere hypothesis, a general statement which is linked to the ongoing situation.

The verb in the subordinate clause is usually in the past tense-(perfect or perfective); the main verb is usually in the past and is followed by the perfect ·-···---· J or auxiliaries of probability. 126 ,~·§:l~· [ ... ] V (past)+ q·U)~·~· [ ... ] V + Ul~·~~· I q·Ul~i ~·~~·al\"c::'OJ'z::J=:l~·Ul~·~·~~·f',·~·Ul~·~~1 chj_ri: tshangma s~'-yo'-na thrgko' n9;-yo:re' \"If (he) had eaten all the sweets, he would have had a stomach ache.\" perfective is also sometimes used: ~·~~·a)c::'OJ'z::J=:l~·qo(i)~·~·~l'F,.~·Ull~~1 chlri: tshangma s~'-payin-na thrgko' n~-yo:re' idem. ~o-l'\"-r~·~,~·z::J~z::J'Ul~·~·;o·~,·z::J~,·Ul~·Ol·~~1 k9;m-la kgca' ky~p-na cala' la'-yo:mare' \"If the box had been padlocked, the things wouldn't have been lost.\" ~Ol·~·~·~,~·z::J~z:::ral~·~·;o·~,·z::J~,·q·~~1 k9;m-la kgca' ky9;p-na cala' la'-pame' idem. ~l~c::·fi1~·3:j'·~·z::J~c::·Ul~·~·c::~·~~·Ull~~1 \"If you'd sold your car, I'd have bought it.\" ~~i~c::·fi1~·3:l·~·z::J~c::·Ull~·c::~·~~·q·Ul~1 idem. • The future conditional expresses a future possibility.

(idiom.) all right, fine (idiom.) thank you Michel Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn In Spoken Tibetan, compound verbs are more common than simple verbs (verbs compris-ing only one syllable). For the most part, these consist of a noun and a \"verbalizer\": Verbalizers (Tibetan: bya-tshig stong-pa) are verbs that do not convey a specific meaning or else mean \"to do\" in a general sense. Compound verbs of this sort generally comprise two or three syllables, but s~ome contain up to five. The three basic verbalizers are: ~l'ch~' I ,~r::::·nang (H) \"to do, act\", ~,. ky~· I l:l~~· kyon (H) \"to make\" and z::Jryr::::·tang I z::Jryr::::·,~r::::·tang-nang (H) \"to send, do\".127 Other verbalizers-some of them used only rarely-include: l:l~\\g \"to make\", ~· sh~ (h) \"to say, to take\",l:l~~· sh~' \"to take\", l:l~r::::~· lang' \"to lift\", !llC:: l§.ng \"to get up\",/:\\~' trg \"to go\", fj~· shor \"to let go\",~l:l~' thep \"to be caught or hit\", r.f'~· khor \"to circulate\", etc. • The choice of verbalizer is determined partly by whether the verb is volitional or non-volitional. The verbalizers shor, trg, l§.ng and thep are used in the formation of non-volitional verbs. \"to deceive\" \"to make angry\" \"to be deceived\" \"to get angry\" 127. Losang Thonden, Modern Tibetan Language (1986), volume 2, provides a substantial list of compound verbs involving these three verbalizers."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Lesson 14 -ij z::::r ffi~· ?~ 205 ~:1\\·~~'z::::li]Z::::' \"to improve\" ~:~\\·~~·~~· \"to be improved\" 3l·~l~·~,. \"to shoot\" 3l·~l~'~z::::l~' \"to be hit (by a bullet)\" 3l9'~'z::::l1]Z:::' \"to shed tears\" 3l9'~'4:!:i' \"to burst into tears\" -fi9'~'z::::l1]Z:::' \"to fart (intentionally)\" ,fj 9'~' 4:1\\' \"to fart (accidentally)\" 9~s;;'t:.l'z::::li]Z:::' \"to urinate (intentionally)\" 9~s;;·q4:!:i' \"to wet oneself\" z:::J~~·~'z::::li]Z:::' \"to ponder\" z::::l~~·~·~:l\\' \"to have an idea\" ~,'t:J'~,. \"to (make oneself) vomit\" ~,'t:J'4:1\\' \"to vomit\" • The honorifics of compound verbs are formed by putting both the verbalizer and the rece:am,g noun in the honorific. a;z:::·~·~9' 1'-l~'ilj'~l· \"to marry\" \"to work\" f§Z:::'~'z::::l~s;;· ~,·l'-1~'9~z:::· \"to marry\" (H) \"to work\" (H) • Compound verbs retain a certain syntactic flexibility: the noun can be separated from the ..,.v.~ .. ~--· by an adverb or a negation, and may also be marked by a complement: z::::l~~·~'OlZ:::'~'z::::l1]Z:::'l,~·~l1 ~·3j'~·9'1~·~~·~·~,·z::::lryz:::·~z:::·1 9:::~z::::1·9:::~z::::l·Ol· 3~·~· ~s;;·F· ~~ 9 \"(We) have to give it a lot of thought.\" \"The girl sang a lovely song.\" \"If you're not careful, it's risky.\" • The semantics of a verb offer no clue as to the verbalizer that should be used. As a rule, compound verbs take only one verbalizer. 1'-l~'ilj'~l· \"to work\" a;z:::·~·~9· \"to marry\" but not but not *1'-l~'ilj'z::::li]Z::::' or *1'-l~'ilj'~,. *ooz:::·~·~~: or *ooz:::·~·z::::Jryz:::· In certain cases, however, there is a choice of which verbalizer may be used: In some exceptional instances, different verbalizers may be used, yielding a different mean-Sill'z::::li]Z:::' \"to call\" 3)·~,. \"to set fire\" 1'-1~'~9' \"to reply\" but but but Sill'~,. \"to shout\" 3l·z::::1ryz:::· \"to light, make a fire\" 1'-ls;;'z::::li]Z::::' \"to send a message\" • Like all verbs, verbalizers must be followed by auxiliaries. Here is a list of the \"conju-gations\" (in all the tense-aspects and moods) with the auxiliaries we have encountered so far. Knowing all these forms will enable you to conjugate most verbs in Standard Tibetan."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"206 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Verbalizer qryr:::: Verbalizer ~~r verbalizer s~: qryr::::·c~f7r::::·)~·~~1 ~~·~·~~1 s~;~·~~1 qryr::::·c~f7r::::·)~·~l1 ~~·~·~ll sl·~·~ll qryr::::· (~ryr::::')~·u:ll1 ~~·~·u:ll1 sl·~·u:ll1 qryr::::· (~ryr::::·)~'r.l._~, ~,·~·~~ sl·~·~~ qryr::::· (~ryr::::·)~·wl·~l1 ~~·~·wl·~ll sl·~·wl~ll qryr::::·c,r~~J q~q·z:.r~~l s~·c.r~~~ qryr::::'.§C:::'J t::l~t::l'.§C:::'J s~·.§r::::'1 qryr::::·~r::::·l q~q·~r::::·1 s~·~r::::·1 qryr::::·q·~l1 q~q·q·~l1 s~·q·~l1 qryr::::·u:ll1 q~q·u:Jll s~·wl1 qryr::::·q'i~ q~q·q'i~ s~·q'i~ qryr::::·wl·~l1 q~qu:Jl·~l1 s~·wl·~l1 Note: The egophoric auxiliaries and the perfect auxiliaries are not compatible with all verbs.

Tibetans often prefer to mention their natal sign rather than their year of birth according to the international calendar, and traditional festivals are situated in terms of the lunar calendar. Astrologers are still frequently consulted for weddings and for the appropriate form of funerals (see Lesson 35.5). Almanacs, or lata (lo-tho ), containing correspondences between the international and native calendars, are regularly used."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Lesson 14-~z:::ra5~· .?~ Tibetan astrology128 involves five elements and twelve animals: ~z:::::· shTng \"wood\" 3J· me \"fire\" ~·sa \"earth\" ~z:n~· ca' \"iron\" ~· chu \"water\" 'I ' -' ' I ' • 209 Each of these elements may be associated with a masculine ~ · pho or feminine a:i' · mg gen-.

Reported speech is indicated by the marker ~· /s/ which corresponds to closing quotation marks. This marker /s/, derived from the verb ~:~\\,' /s~r/ \"to say\", is used for both direct and in-direct speech.129 There is a special form :::!'/sa/ to convey hearsay. The distinguishing feature of reported speech in Tibetan is that it is inserted between the author of the quotation and the verb of speech. When Tibetans read or quote a text, they often conclude the citation with an /s/ to make it clear that these were not their own words. • Direct speech Reported speech begins by first mentioning the source (the speaker) and then, where applicable, the intended recipient (the addressee), respectively in the ergative and dative cases. The quotation is concluded by the sound /-s/, which corresponds to closing quotation marks, followed immediately by a verb of speech. Direct speech reproduces a statement in the original words. Note that quotation marks are actually used in certain modem writings, whereas traditional Tibetan literature uses no punctuation at all. source+,~.

These categories are not always relevant. For certain statements there is only one type of discourse, and they therefore be translated into European languages by either direct or reported speech.

Tshering replied, \"I sent the letter.\" • \"Hybrid\" reported speech. 215 If it happens that the source of a quotation is the same person as someone who is men-in it, or else is the actual speaker, Tibetans prefer to substitute \"hybrid\" reported speech for speech. For example, in the statement \"He said 'I'm a doctor\"', the two pronouns \"he\" and refer to the same person (and are therefore \"coreferential\"). The same is true of the statement said to me, 'You're not a doctor!\"' in which the pronouns \"me\" and \"you\" are coreferential. such cases, Tibetan generally uses a particular form of reported speech that has the following A. The pronouns 131 of the original quotation and the register (honorific, humilific or ordinary) are reformulated to suit the speaker's current situation. This is similar to the reported speech of European languages. B. By contrast, when the first person pronoun \"I\", \"me\", etc. appears in the original citation, the egophoric auxiliary (yin, byung, etc.) that is associated with it is preserved in the \"hybrid\" reported speech. C. Once a sentence has been transformed into reported speech, if it contains coreferen-tial nouns or pronouns one of the two forms is dropped. \"quotation + AUX (ego)\" + E!· + verb of speech For example, the sentence \"He said, 'I'm a doctor\"' is transformed into the hypothetical stage A): * rr:::·;~·rr:::·~arffi·~~·Ej·~~·~r:::·1 khong-ki' khong amci yln-s l!!p-song. Following the rule out in B), the sentence preserves the egophoric auxiliary yln; and as a result of eliminating the first pronoun, we end up with: fC::'~arffi·~~·Ej·~~·~r:::·1 khong amci yln-s l!!p-song \"He said he was a Here are some other examples of indirect reported speech: rr:::·;~·r:::·~~·ffi·~·~l·Ej·,~r:::·~r:::·1 khong-ki' ng!! amci mi!re'-s sOng-cung \"He told me I wasn't a doctor.\" 131. The pronouns \"I\" and \"you\" and, more generally, the \"deictics\", that is, words connected to the statement like the adverbs \"here\" and \"now\", as well as demonstratives such as \"that\" which can only be interpreted in relation to the context of the dialogue."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"216 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN ~~·~z::r~~r~·,·~;z:;·~·~z:::·~·~t::~·q·~l1 thgntrup-ki' ng£1:-la yike CQr-macung-s I£J:p-pare' \"Dhondrup said he hadn't received a letter.\" Note: In this case, the subject could also be in the dative.

As shown above, the verb may occur alone without auxiliary ~,-~·kg' ~·~,-~·mu-kg'133 and may then be best translated as \"I (do not) want\", while with the auxiliary it may be translated as \"need\". The subject of~,-~· kg' used as a main verb must be in the dative and the object in absolutive. 134 132. The various tenses (future, present, past) have to be deduced from the context. 133.

Adjectives usually consist of a radical and a suffix, or else a reduplicated radical. There are a number of suffixes that specify the degree of the adjective: r:i· -po positive, 1:..1' pa comparative, ff~· -sh6' superlative (see Lessons 21 and 22) and intensive, 1:..1'\"-l' -pala admirative, 5.~~· -tra' excessive, ~OJ' -tsam attenuative, !::!~' ffil· thakc6' or ~~· -sa: intensives, as well as inter-rogative suffixes: ~~·-16' and expressive suffixes (see Lesson 31)."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Lesson 17-~z:::ra:)~· '}W 229 • The long or \"positive\" form of adjectives The positive form of adjectives is formed by using c:l· po, q·pa, 3:1· mo, ar ma or by doubling up the radical, which represents a long form of the adjective. The short form is the monosyllabic root of the adjective. In the case of double forms, the short form is the first, unrepeated, syllable, while in the case of adjectives consisting of a radical and a suffix, the latter is simply dropped. An important exception to this rule is the adjective ffi~· r:J· chen+po \"big\", of which the short form is ffi· che and not chen. ~c;.:c:l· kyTppo \"pleasant\", ~(11~·c:l· karpo \"white\", ~~arc:l· sa:po \"clear\", o.1z:::::·c:l· m9:ngpo \"many\", ~z:::::·q· tongpa \"empty\", q;g'~·q·tsokpa \"dirty\" ~;3Z:::::'o.1' tsangma \"clean\", ~~~·q· sarpa \"new\", ~z:::::·q·nyTngpa \"old\", o.1z:::::~·a:l· ngarmo \"sweet\", ~z:::::·a:l· thr§:ngmo \"cold\", ~z:::::·~z:::::· thOngtung \"short\", ~z:::::·~z:::::·chOngcung \"small\", ~q·~q· l~plep \"flat\", ~~·~~· kgrkor \"round, circular\", ~~·~~· rl:ri: \"spherical, cylindrical\", E:lZ:::::'s:JZ:::::' thangtang \"healthy\", ~z:::::·~z:::::· ny~ngnyung \"few\", ~q·~q· sopsop \"soft\",~~;~~; lholo' \"relaxed\", etc. Certain adjectives are formed by means of an expression comprising a substantive followed by an adjective such as a:J·c:l· tshapo \"hot\" (often pejorative), ffi~·c:l· chenpo \"big\", q~q'· t~po \"well\", ~~:q'· thgpo \"shape, appearance\", etc. ~o.1~'t::li:lZ:::::'q' sem S§:ngpo \"kind\", ~~·q·lo.1•q• l§:kpa th§:mpo \"greedy\", ~~·~ry~~·a:)•q• chQto' tshapo \"curious\", ~tll·~~·a:J·c:l· yokyO' tshapo \"hypocritical\", Z<j61'qoa:J·c:l· hampa tshapo \"arro-gant, brutal\", ~l·~z:::::·a:J·c:l· sh~nang tshapo \"scary, terrible\", E:l~·~·c:]· tha' ny~po \"close, near\", 61~~·~~~·~l·c:]· ngonsa: thgpo \"manifest, obvious\", ~·q~·~l·c:l· terso thgpo \"superb\", ~;3z:::::· ~·~l·c:l· tsangtra thgpo \"impeccable\", §]·f~·ffi~·c:l· IiSko' chenpo \"brave\", ~q~·q~·c:l· tap t~po \"convenient\". • Short forms of adjectives All adjectival suffixes are attached to the short form of the adjective, which hardly ever appears alone.

Like other nominalizers, this one can form nominal clauses as well as relative clauses (see Lesson 26). The verb to which the suffix -sa is attached appears in the present-future stem form, but it may be used in the context of the past, present or future. Ex.: ~·~· sh\\:!-sa but not* ~~·~·shQ'-sa ::3·~· S§:-sa but not* t:l:3~·~· s~'-sa t:l<ff·~· ta-sa but not* t:l<ff~·~· ta'-sa The nominalizer -sa relates to the location or the goal of the verbal action.137 Ex.: ~·~· \"the place where one writes, or upon which one writes\", ~~·~'(t:l.,~~·~') \"the place where one makes an offering, the person to whom one makes an offering\",~·~· \"the person to whom one speaks, the place where one speaks\", '?~·~· the place where one sleeps\", t:l.,~' ~· \"the place towards which one goes, the trail\". 137. In other words, the suffix indicates locative adverbials and indirect objects."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"236 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Formulations with -sa are very common in Tibetan, and may sometimes be translated by nouns in European languages.

The nominalizer -sa provides no clues about the tense-aspect of the event, which has to be deduced from the context. 18.3.2 Auxiliaries of probability We have already met some epistemic auxiliaries in Lesson 11. They imply that the speaker regards his or her assertion as a probability, not a certainty. The auxiliaries tllo;,·~~ ylntro, <11t:;,·~~ ygtro, are based on the verbs tllo;,·yln and alt:;,'yg', which correspond respectively to essential and existential formulations. They are used either as copulas (linking verbs) or as auxiliaries and occur in the same position as tllo;,·yln and alt:;,'yg', (see Table 6 ~n Appendix 6). They may be translated in English by the adverb \"probably\".

Bed carpets, called F',l~· khabdiin, cover the beds where Tibetans sleep or sit (often cross-legged) during the day .140 Usually there is also a carpet-covered cushion as a back-rest.141 Floor rugs called ~· ,l~· sabdiin, though rarer, may still be found. Besides the ubiquitous bed-carpets, Tibetans traditionally weave specially shaped saddle-carpets; pillar carpets (very good examples in some palaces of the Norbulingkha, in Samding Monastery, Nagartse, Lhokha); monastery assembly-hall carpets called ~,~. ,l~· tshogdiin, long and narrow to accommodate a row of monks; and ~·,l~· thridiin, throne-fitting seat-and-back carpets for the highest lamas. The history of Tibetan rugs is very patchy, because very few antique items have made it to modem times. During the period of the Empire, between the eighth and ninth centuries, Tibetans controlled the Silk Road and were thus exposed to Turkish, Persian, and Chinese cultures. Despite these influences, Tibetan carpets have retained their distinctive features. First the Tibetan knot (referred to as the Senna loop), is different from the two most widely-used knots, the Turkish and Persian. Patterns and colours are also very different and have a characteristic and un-mistakable Tibetan personality. There is usually no border on Tibetan carpets, and the central design is simple compared to the complex motifs of Persian carpets. Patterns are much less 140. The commonest size is 175 em x 85 em (approximately 6 x 3ft.). 141.

Tibetan carpet weaving has undergone several innovations since the 1960's, when it became one of the main occupations for Tibetan refugees in Nepal. Tibetans had never woven carpets for export markets, and they had now to adapt to Western tastes. In the mid-1980s, the authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and Prefectures started to promote carpet weaving as one of the rare industries that did not require energy or major investment, and for which raw material was locally available. The main production centers are in Lhasa, Gyantse, and Zhikatse. Tibetan wool is valued as one of the best in the world for its high lanoline content. Weaving was primarily an activity of women and a cottage industry, but large factories of more than twenty looms now occupy a major share of the market. Don't step on a carpet depicting a religious character, or even the Potala, a very common motif on tourist souvenirs -Tibetans would not appreciate it!

We have already seen (in Lesson 10) that some volitional verbs have an imperative form.

However, there are many verbs that have no special form to denote the imperative. In such cases, the verb may be used by itself. ~~~·~·31~t:;,J so:ca cho' \"Have some tea\", Z<l~'~Cl~J phar phe' \"Go over there\". In most cases, the imperative (command) and optative (wish) moods are formed by using particles. The main particles are: ~· -to,lz::::· -ta, ~· -a, 4~· -shi, 4~· -sho' and the construction ~~~· ,~z::::· ro'nang."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"244 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN • The particle ~· -to This particle is used to form the first person plural imperative: the exhortative. Ex.: ?4z:::J~· ~1 phep-to \"Let's go.\", z::::1~9~·~1 sh~J'-to \"Let's sit down.\" Apart from -to, which is used to form the first person imperative, the other markers all indicate the second person singular or plural imperative, and differ from one another only in terms of nuance or register. ( • The expression ~,~.,~z:::· ro'nang This is the most polite form in which to phrase a command or a request. It is used only with honorifics, and takes the present-future (not the imperative) form of the verb. Ex.: ?4z:::J~·l¢z:n ~·z:no:t:::.'1 '\\ 1 1-1 phep-ro'nang l:ll~t:::.~·l¢z:n~·z:no:t:::.'1 I~ '\\ 1 1 \\ sung-ro'nang z::::l(O.I:ll~·l¢z:n~·z:no:t:::.'1 '-.! 1 \" 1 1· 1 sh~J'-ro'nang ,,=c~,l¢z:n~·z:no:z:::·1 -\"\"00 1\" 1 1 1 cho'-ro'nang \"Please go\" or \"Please come\" \"Please say\" \"Please stay\" \"Please eat\" z::::l'lll:ll'l¢z:n~·z:no:z:::·1 d 1 1\" 1 1 1 ka'-ro'nang \"Please stop\" (the car, the og, etc.) ~·~9~·9~z:::·1 sh~J-ro'nang \"Please ask.\" Note: There is also the non-honorific version ~,~·~l ro'ce'. • The particles ~t:::.· -tang and ~9· -shi' These very common particles have exactly the same meaning as the expressions described above, but are less formal. In conversation they are pronounced respectively -ta and -sh. They may be used with both honorific and non-honorific forms. Ex.: 9~z:::~·~z:::·1 sCing-ta \"Say it\", ?4z:::J~·~z:::·1 phe'-ta \"Go\", ?4z:::J~'~9 phe'-sh \"Go\", z::::1~9~·49 sh~J'-sh \"Sit down\", z::::1~9~·~z:::·1 sh~J'-ta \"Sit down\", ~·~z:::·1 sg-ta \"Eat\", ~~·~z:::·1 nygn-ta \"Listen\", il.1z::::l'lr::::·1 l~p-ta \"Speak\", ~~·49 to'-sh \"Look\". • The particle ~· -a This particle, too, is very common, and may also be used with both honorific and ordinary forms. It conveys a sense of urgency or danger, or implies a greater degree of coercion. Ex.: ~~~·~il.1·~·~l·~1 semtra: m~ ch~'-a \"Don't worry!\" 9Elz::::l'9Elz::::l'9~z:::·~1 sapsap nang-a \"Be careful!\" ~'il.1z::::l'~1 m~ l~p-a \"Just don't talk!\""},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Lesson 19-~z:::rffi~· 'Jf? 245 • The particle 4~· - sho' This form, which is less common, is also used with both honorific and non-honorific for-uu.u.au~'u\".

In the former case, the tense-aspect of the verb is unspecified, and must be deduced from the context. Thus the sentence \"Who is the person who is smoking (or who smokes)\" could just as well be translated by the imperfective past as \"Who is the person who was smoking? (or who used to smoke?)\" or the past perfective, \"Who is the person who (has) smoked.\" By contrast, when the nominalizer is used with an intransitive verb, it indicates the present or the future (or else the imperfective past). To indicate the past (perfective) corresponding to the English perfect or preterite, Tibetan uses another nominalizer: CJ' -pa. trg-ngan t~'-ngan chTn-pa t~'-pa \"the person who is going, goes, will go, was going\" \"the person who is staying, who stays, will stay, was staying\" \"the person who went, has gone\" \"the person who stayed, has stayed\""},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Lesson 20-~z:::ra)'a;· qo 251 111-·r·,p~· Ill 20.4 Exercises gc:::·a5a;1 20.4. 1 Translate into English: ?) i!ia;'~t!j~'Z:::P\\'~ =z·a;c:::·~·~~·~·~~·a;~·~l·~~1 -~c:::i~l1 ~~·a;~·l<l=:;'c:r~~·a;~· alt!j' ~~a;·Fc:::·t!!l·~·~~·a;~·t!]tl!a;·~~·~·?4~~·a;·~~~·~·~l1 q) ~. \"% t!]. ~ t!] ~ 1 ~a;·~~·Fc:::·t!]·~=z·t!!l·~l1 t!]~t!]·~t!]·Fc:::·ff)·01~a;·a;~·01=z·~01·?4~~·a;·~· ~·lft!]·~~a;·Fc:::·t!!l· ~l1 ~·~·lft!]·~~·Fc:::·~a;·~~·Fc:::·F·~ l·~·t!!l·~l1 ~) ~c:::·~c:::·Ulc:::·~·~s~·5l·01Fa;·tl!l·~l·~~1 ~) F·~=z·iila;·OlFa;·3l·~~t!] ~) <;~~·s·~t!]·01Fa;·~~·~=z·~=z·5l·~·tl!l·~l1 20.4.2 Translate into Tibetan: 1.

We ought to hurry or it will be closed . • 21.5 Civilization ~,·,~r:::·1 Tibetan tea The first step in making Tibetan tea (also called butter tea or churned tea) is to prepare plain green tea. There are two ways of doing this. In towns, people usually boil the tea-leaves three times. After each occasion the tea is strained and stored in a container. The concentrate may be kept for several days, and when required a ladleful of it is poured into boiling water. The other method, which is more typical of rural areas, consists of making a fresh brew on each occasion. In either case, the next step consists of pouring the tea into a chum, adding some salt, a large quantity of butter and perhaps some milk. The mix-ture is churned briskly and the final product served hot. Contrary to common supposition, Tibetans prefer not to use rancid butter to make the tea, and will only use it in the absence of fresh butter. For anyone who is unfamiliar with it, this beverage is more like soup than tea. The drink is ideal on the high Tibetan plateau and in the Himalaya, because it is both very warming and has a high nutritional content. Other kinds of tea are also to be found in Tibet: sweet milk tea, of Indian provenance, is drunk mainly in cities, while salted milk tea is drunk principally by herders in Amdo. Finally, it may be noted that Tibetans don't drink only tea! They also appreciate chang, a mildly (and sometimes very) alcoholic barley-based beer. The commonest variety is mild, whitish-coloured and quite thick, with a taste and alcohol content somewhat reminis-cent of cider. Fermented barley is also sometimes distilled to make the stronger arak. 257 Tibetan churn"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"2!?lll.M{2!?.M{lll.M{ _.1il Li li _.1il li Li li .a l! lll .a lJJ l! lJJ 0~ -4' l! oo l! _1p l! __...ji}-oo oo~ oo ll ll 2 2 ~ ~ .q .q lq ~ 2PJ! ---a ll ~ 2!{ l! lll ~ 8i$. _E7 l! 00 J1 _Di 00 ~ n a 2 __9.1 ~ . .q 2:!? .am 2:!? _.1iln_ii! .a lll .a . l! . -'*n ~--'! --'! fl. ~ ~ ---{L l! ~ ~ {!~ ~ ~ ---11 --'!

He would always ask, \"On these grasslands, is there anybody stronger than me?''. One day, an ant told him, \"Oh, big boy, there is an animal called the yak who is stronger than you.\" The beetle then asked, \"Where is the one called the yak? I am going to fight a little with him!\". So he went with the ant to the place where the yak was staying. The ant said, \"The yak is over there. That big black thing is the yak.\" The beetle raised his head and asked, \"isn't it a mountain?\". A little while later, the yak came toward them and slightly crushed the beetle.

Note that the position of the item being compared is not fixed; it may also come first: ~·~tlj' ill~·asr:::·~a.J'CJ1 \"Compared with beer, chang is better.\" When the adjective is an attribute of the subject, another construction is also commonly used: the short form of the adjective is followed by the auxiliary ,.~l1-kire'.

For example, to translate the expression \"He is less poor than I am\", Tibetan would say: r:::·f3r:::·~~·~·,·~l1 \"I'm poorer than him.\" or or according to the context f'r:::·r:::·~~·~~q·tllla.J'~l· \"He isn't poorer than me.\""},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"264 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives Positive Comparative Superlative ~~~·q· \"new\" ~~~·~· ~~~'t::l'(L)!43 ~~~·4~· ~~·:o~· \"bad\" ~~·~· ~~·q· (L) ~~·4~· 0-lr:::::·r:J· \"many\" 0-lt:::'t:::' 0-lt:::'l:::l' (L) O-lt:::'4~· 'jt:::''jt:::' \"few\" 'jt:::'t:::' 'jt:::'t::l' (L) 'jt:::'4~· ~r:::::·q· \"long\" ~r:::::·r:::::· ~r:::::·q (L) ~r:::::·4~· ~r:::::·~r:::::· \"small\" ~r:::::·r:::::· ~t:::'t::l'(L) ~r:::::·4~· ~~·q· \"big\" ~'z::)' ~·4~· ~l·q· \"pleasant\" ~l·q· ~z::]'4~· ~l·4~'(L) ~~~·q· \"clear\" ~~~·~· ~~~'t::l' (L) ~~~·4~· 9~·of'~~· \"elderly\" 9~'1:.1' 9~'4~· 0-lr:::::~·a:l· \"sweet\" 0-lr:::::~·~· 0-lt:::~'l:::l'(L) O-lt:::~·4~· z::]~~·r:r· \"cool\" z::]~~·~· t::l~~·t::l'(L) z::]~~·4~· • The .construction ~~·Ia' + V: \"more than\" The marker Ia' may also precede a verb, in which case it is translated as \"more than\".

In the conversational register, the suffix ~OJ'-tsam is usually pronounced <f'-ts. Its meaning varies according to context: • After an adjective, it means \"a little\", or \"a little more\". 'Ex.: o.Tt:::'<fo.T' \"a little more\", 9t:::'ft'<fo.T' \"a little cheaper\", o.T~,~·<fo.T' \"a little faster\", lo.T'\\' <fo.T' \"a little red\", ~,. <fo.T' \"a few more\", ~· <fo.T' \"a little earlier (or early)\". • After a number, it means \"about\".

The form cho' is used in a rather more formal register. • With this type of future, the verb stem must be in the past tense.

Then he remembered a way and returned to the cell. He asked the master: is a vase an object [an impermanent compound form] or is it permanent? The master answered: it is an object.

It doesn't matter, no problem (idiom.) It doesn't matter, no problem 281 Historically speaking, of the nominalizing suffixes (see 11.4, 18.4 and 20.4), the suffix -pa occupies an essential place to the extent that it is the basic marker of nominalization in Literary Tibetan. In Standard Spoken Tibetan, however, it has far fewer functions. In Literary Tibetan, the suffix z:r -pa sometime appears in the variant form:144 q· -wa. • After the consonants ~·l· ~· q· ~· ~·l5~· z:.r > ~:r • After vowels and the consonants r:::· r.l..,' ~· ~· > q· In the spoken language, this rule is not followed, and the form -pa is used in all contexts. 145 In colloquial speech, the suffix *~9' -nkyo' sometimes replaces -pa, but this suffix is never written, and has no known spelling. The suffix -pa is associated only with the past tense form of the verb, and refers to a past ~~·z:r but not * ~·~.r, q=:1~·~· but not * =:1·~·. A nominalized verb may be followed by a demonstrative, an indefinite article or other ......... \", ...... ., such as any substantive. 9~r:::~·z:r~·~1 \"Those that [you] mentioned.\" The suffix -z:r pa has two essential functions 146: • It denotes prototypically the grammatical patient of the verbal action in the perfective past. That is, it refers to the direct object when it is used with a transitive verb or the subject when it is used with an intransitive verb. 147 It may be translated in English by using a relative clause or a past participle (for more details about the relative clause, see Lesson 26). 144. But be careful! This modification applies only to verb suffixes, and not to suffixes with other functions such as or adjective suffixes. Thus Standard Tibetan says khang-pa \"house\" and stong-pa \"empty\", not khang-ba and stong-ba. 145. Some speakers do, however, follow the rule. In this case, they apply the phonological rule of omitting the bilabial /w/ described in section 1.1 of Appendix 1: nang-wa > nang-nga, phul-wa > phul-la, tshar-wa > tshar-ra. 146. In the same way as the nominalizer Ulll]'ya', see Lesson 11. 147. From a syntactic point of view, the nomina1ized verb functions here as a head noun or as a modifier of the head"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"282 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Ex.: t::l~~·z:r~· \"that which has been built\" ~~~·z::r \"that which has been washed\" U!r::::·CJ· \"[the person] who came\" S~'CJ' \"that which has been written\" t::l~~'CJ' \"[the person] who lived, sat\" ~~·CJ· \"[the person] who cried\" '?~'CJ' \"[the person] who went to bed\" However, it also extends to the subject of transitive benefactive verbs: UJ~'CJ' \"[the person] who has\", ~z:::rCJ' \"[the person] who has obtained\". • The suffix -pa may also be neutral and nominalize the entire clause. In this case, the suffix is not oriented towards any grammatical role and nominalizes the entire clause. From a syntactic point of view, the nominalized verb functions as a head noun and may be translated in English by a verb in the infinitive, an -ing clause, a that clause or even by a noun. Ex.: tJ-1Z::::'~r::::·c:l· ~t::l' CJ'~.:s;,·r::::·~Zl\"]C\":\\'c:l· ~r::::· \"The fact that she took first place made me happy.\" Z5'l~~·4~'C,]'~Zl\"j~·ffi~·c:J·~l \"It's very important to know Tibetan.\" or \"Knowledge of Tibetan is very important.\" 0-l~·~·~·C\":\\~Zl\"j'&z:::rCJ'~q·:t:;r::::-~~1 \"To be able to plant hair on the head is incredible!\" It is only from the context that we can distinguish between the two functions described above, as the following examples show: Ex.: ~·~~·U!r::::·CJ·~·~·~~1 \"Who's the person who came a short while ago?\" ~·~r::::·C\":\\~.:s;,·U!r::::·CJ'(.I,JZl\"j'c:l·~r::::·t::l<;Zl\"] \"It was a good thing/ idea [for us] to come here today!\" What is being nominalized in the first case is the verb \"to come\" modifying the head noun \"this one\", and in the second the clause \"we came here today\". 25.3.2 The topica/izer ~· -ni This particle is very common in Literary Tibetan, but less so in the spoken language. It is used to emphasize a group of words preceding it, or else it \"thematizes\" something - that is, it introduces the topic that is about to be developed. In English, when the thematization concerns the object, the marker ~· -ni may be rendered by moving the object to the beginning of the sen-tence and emphasizing it with some expression such as \"as for\" or \"regarding\". Sometimes it may even be left untranslated.

Tibetan forms relative clauses by nominalizing the verb. Thus, instead of relative pronouns such as we use in English, Tibetan uses nominalizers (see Lessons 11, 18, 20 and 25) that follow the verb of the relative clause. Relative clauses are formed by using the following nominalizers: t.l' pa;149 Ul,. ya'; ~· kyu; 3.1f~' kan; ~·sa. 148. According to Tibetan, Bon was the pre-Buddhist religion of the country. In Western writings it is still sometimes ~uuu\"'v'\"\"iY identified with shamanism. Remember that the marker nkyo' is also used instead of pa in colloquial language."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"288 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN The construction of relative clauses is a rather complicated matter in Standard Tibetan grammar, insofar as the nominalizer that is used depends not only on the function of the head noun with respect to the verb of the relative clause (subject, object, indirect object, instrument, etc.), but also on the tense150 and, in some cases, even the class of the verb. The following table offers a summary of the uses of nominalizers that operate as \"relative pronouns.\" \"Relative pronouns\" Functions of the head noun Nominalizers (\"relative pronouns\") OJF~· -ngan (present, future) Subject of an intransitive verb: \"who, which\" q-pa (past) ~· !::,.

In Standard Tibetan, relative clauses usually go before the head noun. Thus the nominalizer is generally (though not always) followed by the genitive, which connects the relative clause to its head noun. This being said, it does sometimes happen that relative clauses go after the head noun, as in the case of European languages, and in such cases the genitive is not used. The demonstra-tive adjective~· th~ often follows the noun phrase, consisting of the head noun plus the relative. Structure of preceding relative clause: [ SN + SV + nominalizer + genitive] + \"head noun\" + dem. 150. That is, both tense and aspect. Remember that the term \"present\" actually refers to the imperfective present and past, and that the term \"past\" denotes the perfective past (see Lesson 10). 151. This nominalizer, which is used only in the future, is often also used to indicate a necessity or an obligation. 152. For this function, the nominalizer is used only with benefactive verbs (see Lesson 10) in the past tense. 153. This nominalizer is used only with the perfective past when it denotes an adverb of place."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Lesson 26-~z:::rct~·% Structure of following relative clause: [ SN] + \"head noun\" + [ SV + nominalizer] + dem.

If the verb comes after the head noun (in the example cited above, ~~ nyg', \"to buy\", comes after the head noun ~l'&Z:::'totung \"shirt\"), the latter can precede the subject of the relative clause, and the head noun is embedded within the relative clause (as in the example ~l·;::;;z:::·fij~·~l·&z:::·,~;::;;·t:J·~~·t:J·~·,·t:J;::;;'r.l..~, where ~l'&t::::' totung \"shirt\" is preceded by the subject ~l·;::;;z:::·fij~· khyerang-ki' \"you\", which belongs to the relative, not the main, clause, \"where is the new shirt?\"). It should be noted that in most cases the verb in the relative clause stands by itself, without an auxiliary, followed by the nominalizer. In certain rare instances, however, auxiliaries may be used to indicate the tense-aspect of the relative clause, in which case they must be followed by the nominalizer pa. Ex.: V+t:J~~'t:J' shin-pa present progressive, V+ fij~·t:J~l't:J' kin t~'-pa present progressive, V+~l·q yg'-pa perfect. Below are some illustrations of the different functions of the head noun. The nominalizers have been selected in accordance with the rules laid out above in the table. • Subject (intransitive): \"who, which\" In this case the nominalizer depends on the tense-aspect. For the present, the future and the imperfective past, the nominalizer 0-lf~' -ngan is used, whereas for the perfective, it is the form t:J' -pa that is used.

According to the Bon tradition, Mt. Tise (gangs-ti-se), called Kailash in the Hindu tradi-tion, is regarded as the center of the world or the \"navel of the earth\" (sa 'i lte-ba). This sacred mountain is situated in western Tibet, in the region of Ngari (mnga '-ris). The kingdom of Zhang-zhung (zhang-zhung), which was annexed at the beginning of the seventh century by the emperor Songtsan Gampo (srong-btsan sgam-po ), had its main center in the area of Tise, like the mythical land of Olmo Lungring ( 'ol-mo lung-ring). This was the birthplace of Tonpa Shenrap Miwo (ston-pa gshen-rab mi-bo), \"the Excellent Shen, the Teacher, the Leader of Men\", the founder of the Bon religion. It remains an open question whether this figure is historical or mythic, but in any event his name appears in numerous hagiographical texts and recitations, the oldest of which date back to the eleventh century. Bonpo teachings are concerned mainly with the origin of the world, as well as the appearance of living beings. They also deal with rituals of everyday life and the transition to the next life. The Bonpo teachings offer a vision of a purely Tibetan world and genui-nely indigenous concepts, and are in this respect distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, which is of Indian origin. In the course of its evolution, the Bon religion adopted the concepts of karma and rebirth, which it borrowed from Buddhism, and organized its teachings according to a model known as \"the nine ways of Bon\" (bon theg pa rim dgu). From the time of its introduction into Tibet in the middle of the eighth century, Buddhism took pains to suppress Bonpo beliefs. Gradually but inexorably, the Tibetan people were converted to Buddhism. However, the process of conversion was not complete. In many parts of the country, including Central Tibee55, there are still Bonpo temples and monasteries. Most of these were destroyed before and during the Cultural Revolution, but some have been restored since 1980. In the Bonpo communities that are scattered throughout Tibet, particular importance is accorded to rituals for mountain gods, whose origins go back to the myth of the first king, the founder of the Tibetan nation. The Bon religion has undergone many influences, and has adopted numerous ideas from Tibetan Buddhism, to the extent that the great Gelugpa scholar Thuukan Chokyi Nyima (thu 'u bkwan chos-kyi nyi-ma, 1723-1802) declared that it was not possible to make a clear distinction between the two religions. By contrast, the eminent British scholar David Snellgrove maintains that the Bon religion is the true religion of Tibet, since it has rejected nothing but has enriched itself through the acquisition of new elements. •Buddhism In its tantric form (\"Vajrayana\"), Buddhism is a non-theistic religious philosophy (denying the existence of a creator God) that stresses the impermanence of the world and advocates belief in the law of cause and effect (karma) as well as reincarnation or rebirth.

The methods used include reflection, introspection, meditation, prayer, the use of mantra (sacred for-mulae), ritual objects and mudra (symbolic gestures), as well as the practice of various yogas and psycho-physiological exercises. There are four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism: the Nyingmapa (rnying-ma-pa), the Kagyiipa (bka '-brgyud-pa), the Sakyapa (sa-skya-pa) and the Gelugpa (dge-lugs-pa). These four differ from one another largely with respect to the rituals they perform and the emphasis they place on certain practices, but they all subscribe to the same fundamental tenets. The Tibetan form of the Dharma has certainly been influenced by Bonpo thought and ritual, something that explains its originality and uniqueness. The monasteries of these different schools are populated by monks and nuns who have taken a range of vows, including those of chastity and abstinence from alcohol and other intoxi-cants. All the schools with the exception of the Gelugpa have a tradition of married priests. Revered teachers, whether married or celibate, who teach the Dharma are classified as lamas. The successive lives of a great master constitute a lineage of the transmission of teachings. All the sects of Tibetan Buddhism have such lineages. Traditionally, following the death of such a teacher, qualified lamas search for the reincarnation of the master in the form of a young child. These reincarnations are known as triilku (sprul-sku), \"emanation body\". Venerated high masters of a lineage are given the title of rinpoche, which literally means \"precious\". Daily religious practices, pilgrimages, circumambulation of sacred mountains and religious festivals constantly illustrate the remarkable religious conviction of ordinary Tibetans. Some practitioners even go so far as to prostrate themselves over the course of thousands of kilometers to visit the statue ofthe Buddha Sakyamuni located in the great temple of Lhasa. Most of the six thousand monasteries and temples that existed before 1959 were destroyed either before or during the Cultural Revolution. However, since the beginning of the 1980s, many of the ruined buildings have been restored. Apart from Buddhists and Bonpo, mention should be made of a small minority of Tibetan Muslims, comprising two quite distinct communities: the Khache (kha-che), originally from Kashmir, and the Horpaling (hor-pa-ling), who are of Chinese origin. The introduction of Islam dates to the eighteenth century, and there are two mosques in the old sector of Lhasa."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"\"The car has broken down\" • The future modal auxiliaries: ~·~~· ky!,!yin, ~·~~i ky!,!re', \"-ltl'j'~~· -y~yin, \"-ltl'j'~~~ y~re'. • The auxiliaries of probability: l:.l'~tlj' patu', l:.l'tlll'payo'. • The factitive construction: V +(S' +t:l...~tlj'. • The construction: Adj (short form) +(S't:l...~' -ru trg I ~·qryr:::::· -ru tang \\B.g11 rr:::::·~· ~· E:i~· ~tlj·l::l~lll·~l1 z::]~l·1:.1· ~· E:i~·q~ q· ~ln \"There is no suffering like anger, no happiness like patience.\" (proverb) A'~ CD I • Tr. 63 28. 1 a Dialogue s·q·s~·lll~1 ~·~· g ~'l::lEJr:::::' g ~·~· g ~·q::~r:::::· g ~·~· g ~·q::~r:::::· g ~·~· g ~·q::~r:::::· g ~·~·g ~·q::~r:::::· g ~·~· g ~·q::~r:::::· g t!]·~·s~·~r:::::·1 3!·~·~~·4~·~r:::::·1 l't!]·~·~l·l,~·~l1 ~~'lll'tlj~tlj'~'~'~~1 ~~'tlj'l:.1~'4~'~tlj l<J',·~·~·t:l...~tlj ~~·~~·l:.l·~~·t:l...~ (~~·t:l...~) ~·~l1 ~~·(a\\5t!]~'t:l...~tlj l'z::]~'&l::l'~'~l·l:.1~1 ~~·~·q~l'~'z::]~'&l::l'~·~·~l1 l't!]r:::::':St!] tlj~' (t!jr:::::'U-lr:::::') ~l·~·~·~l1 q~·~·&q·~·~l,r:::::~·~ tlj'l:.l~·~~·lll'tlj~~· a5r:::::'t!]U-1~' ~· ~l1"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"304 Translation Dorje Lobzang Dorje Lobzang Dorje Lobzang Dorje Lobzang Dorje Lobzang Dorje Lobzang ~ MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN What's happening?

These variants give some idea of the reality of communication in the Tibetan region, which comprises many dialects and varieties. However, these dialectal expressions don't hamper communication, because the nomad woman otherwise uses Standard Tibetan to express herself.

Are you tired? Yes, fairly. This time it took you several days. What happened? The car broke down. Were you worried? Of course I was. And so? One night we had to stay with some nomads. In a tent? Of course! The tent was really big! As we went in there was a churn, with hoops of brass, tied to the tentpole. In the middle of the tent there was a big stove, with a nice fire blazing inside. As soon as we arrived inside the tent, there was a pleasant warmth. Inside the rim of the tent there were metal trunks and piled-up sacks of grain. At the far end of the tent there was an altar. At the foot of the altar were two pairs of mattresses, and on top they'd put a couple of rugs with designs of birds and dragons. That's where they put Dorje and me (for the night). The nomad woman looked really impressive. From head to foot she was covered in silver, turquoise, coral and that sort of thing. When she walked, she went jingle jingle. The hems of her sheepskin chuba and her sleeves were edged with green and red silk borders-as lovely as a rainbow. So, it looks as if you've fallen in love with a nomad! And it looks as if you're jealous!

We've already seen the very common construction Bla;·~r:::::·Bla;· yln-ta yln. Sometimes a verb other than yln may be used in the same construction: V+ ta +V. The same idea may be conveyed by using kgcung in association with a verb in the present-future.

Nomadic herders or drogpa traditionally live in big, black yak-hair tents called \"ba\". Although they are transhumant, they usually remain within a well-defined territory. Every drogpa family has a fixed abode, corresponding to a winter camp. This camp, usually situated at the lower end of a valley, is usually home to the older family members who no longer follow the young people on the annual circuit. In spring, the nomads move up to higher altitudes and set up summer camps. The main activity consists of rearing yaks, sheep and goats. Wealthier nomads may also have several horses. They produce butter, cream, cheese and yogurt, and sell hides and wool.

These are common in both Standard and Literary Tibetan. Some go at the beginning of a sentence and some at the end, after the verb. Of those that go at the beginning, the commonest are: 111'· 6 \"Oh!\" ~·\"'1(.1.: ala: \"Well, well\", ~·~· atsi \"Rats! Dam! Bugger!\"~·~· aro \"Ow!\", ~·~· acu \"Oo, that's cold!\", ~·a:)· atsa \"Ouch, that's hot!\", ~·F· akha \"What a shame!\", ~'OJ' ama \"Oh Lordy (lit. 0 mother)!\" The particles that appear most frequently at the end of a sentence are: l'-ta and t:.l'pa (and their variants t~1'-ka, t:::'-nga). •l'-ta often implies that the speaker is not in agreement with the person to whom he's speaking, or is·emphasizing the surprising or threatening nature of the situation in question. \"It's pretty amazing, huh?\" \"But you'll be robbed!\" \"But there is some danger!\" \"Watch out, the horse has escaped!\" .z:.J'pa and its variants ~l'-ka, t:::'-nga are subject to the same modifications163 as the interrogative particles t:.1~-pa', ,~·-ka', r::::~· -nga' (see Lesson 2). Using these implies that the speaker is trying to elicit agreement with what he is saying, and they correspond to tag questions. The may therefore be translated in English by \"isn't that so?\" or \"don't you think?\" or conveyed by the intonation. Ex.: ~l· ~r::::·finr~I ;$~·a:f· as,~·~~,., l'?i'~·a:f·~l't:.l1 ~l·a:f·~r::::·~r::::·r::::·1 r::::~·~l·~t:::'\"'l\\~~·~r::::·r::::·1 ~l·~r::::·~z::r~r::::·::i~·~~·~·s,~·5l·~·~~,., \"My God, how your child has grown!\" \"It's late now, isn't it?'' \"It was very pleasant!

Apart from these, there are so-called \"self-corrective\" auxiliaries (or copulas) that are used much more rarely. They imply that the speaker has just realized that he was mistaken or that he was hitherto unaware of what he is asserting. Statements using these auxiliaries often begin with ~·\"'la: ala: \"Well, well! Oh, I see!\" As in the case of other mediatory auxiliaries and copulas, a distinction may be made be-tween \"essential\" and \"existential\". • The \"self-corrective\" essential verb ~~·q·~l· ylnpare'. 163.

There is a subtle difference between the two.

Traditionally, there are a number of festivals in the course of the Tibetan year. Their dates are fixed according to the lunar calendar. Some of these occasions are purely local, and may be specific to a particular monastery, valley or region. Broadly speaking, there are two main types of celebration: folk-festivals, that follow the rhythm of the agricultural or nomadic cycle, and Buddhist or Bonpo religious ceremonies. In actual fact the distinction between the two is not always very clear, to the extent that popular celebrations often have a religious component. Folk festivals include the New Year ill'·9~~· lgsar.

This is a traditional medical system based on plants, minerals and certain animal products. Diagnosis is performed by examining the patient's pulse and, less commonly, his or her urine. Before and during the examination the doctor asks the patient questions that reveal aspects of temperament, daily habits, and living conditions. Medicinal herbs (tsamiin ~p:!~') are gathered at specific times of year, and are subjected to meticulous processing. The compound treatments are in the form of pills, decoctions and powders. Tibetan doctors also practice moxibustion (metsa ~· t:::la'r.l._'), a form of acupuncture (serkhap ~~:1\\'ft::l'), as well as massage. The essentials of Tibetan medicine are contained in a treatise entitled \"Gyiizhi\" (~~· t::l~') and its numerous commentaries.

It is extraordinary to be able to plant hair. Well that is great!\" Then, he asked: \"Akhu, please could you plant hair on my head too?'' Akhu answered, \"Sure I will! I'll come the day after tomorow.\" Two days later, Akhu went to their house and the family served him an excellent meal. After he had eaten, Akhu told the father, \"Father, please wash your head while I sharpen the awl.\" Then he pulled out a big awl and began to grind it. The father asked Akhu, \"Why are you sharpening the awl?\" \"I plant one hair in each of the spots where I stick the awl in,\" he replied. The father got terribly frightened and asked, \"If you stick the awl in like that, don't people die?'' \"Well some die, some recover and some abandon the idea and offer me (as compensation) a pat of butter.\" The father of this family said, \"I am also going to offer you a pat of butter.\" He gave a pat of butter to Akhu, who took it back home with him.

[inv., A] to get used to, to endure (idiom.) to show signs of getting better Tsethang (town) Akhu Tonpa (folktale character) There is an ancient morphogical verb opposition in Tibetan which corresponds to a cau-sative derivation. This morphological opposition has generated verb pairs: a causative verb, both transitive and volitional, is derived166 from a basic verb which is usually both intransitive and non-volitional. This basic verb stem is referred to here as the resultative form. The two verbs that comprise each pair are phonetically very close, and in most cases their pronunciation differs only in terms of tone or aspiration. The causative derivation is essential in many Tibet-Burman languages as well as in Clas-sical Tibetan (with over 200 verb pairs) and in some archaic dialects of Amdo, but in Central Tibetan and in the Standard Spoken language, it applies only to a few dozen verbs. Ex.: t::l<i~' ca' \"to break\" (caus.), cx;~· cha' \"to break\" (res.); ~!'l.l' nya' \"to lay\" (caus.), '?!'l.l'ny~: \"to lie\" (res.); t::l'1~' ka' \"to stop\" (caus.), !.\\~~· k~' \"to stop\" (res.); t::ls:JZ::::~· lang' \"to raise\" (caus.), !'l.lZ::::' l~ng \"to rise\" (res.); ~ry'~'tor \"to scatter\" (caus.), !.\\~~·thor, \"to scatter, be scattered\" (res.); ~!'l.l' ko: \"to boil\" (caus.), ~!'l.l'kho: \"to boil\" (res.);~~· kor \"to stir, 166. Many of the causative verbs were formed by a morpheme \"s\" attached to the verb. This is still visible in the Tibetan orthography: 'khol (resultative) > skol (causative), nyal (res.) > snyal (caus.), lang (res.)> slang (caus.), 'khor (res.)> skor (caus.), etc."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Lesson 35-ijr::::rcb\"~· ~\"\\ 353 tum\" (caus.), 12..f~' khor \"to stir, tum\" (res.); z::Jry~· ton \"to take out\" (caus.), ~~· thgn \"to go out\" (res.); Z'.:lz::J' phap \"to bring down, take down\" (caus.), 12..z::Jz::J' Pi!P \"to descend, get down\" (res.); 'ffi ~· trg: \"to free\" (caus.), §f ~· thrg: \"to be freed\" (res.); lS~'d3:: \"to tear\" (caus.), ~~· r~: \"to tear\" (res.); z::J'3l' di' \"to cut\" (caus.), 05l'cha' \"to be cut\" (res.), etc. Compared to the basic resultative stem, the causative always has an additional argument corresponding to an intentional agent performing the action. If the resultative is intransitive, the causative is transitive. If the resultative is transitive, the causative is ditransitive (see the examples below) It emerges from the above that all the causative verbs are transitive and volitional since they imply an agent is intentionally performing an action on an object or a patient. Resultative verbs are usually intransitive and non-volitional. Ex.: E:l'\"1'1:.l'a5l'~Z:::::'1 resultative: \"The rope broke.\" [the rope got cut by itself, without any intentional cause] fZ:::::',~'E:!'\"1'1:.l'z::J'3l'~Z:::::'1causative: \"He cut the rope.\" [an agent cut the rope intentionally] f1~·~·as'\"1'z::J~'\"1 resultative: \"The pane broke.\" [ the pane broke by itself, without any intentional cause] ~·~·€€~·f1~·~'z::J'3'\"1'~Z:::::'1causative: \"The children broke the pane.\" [ the children intentionally broke the pane] 3.1'~·a.f~·z::J~l'z::J~'\"1 resultative: \"The prayer wheel is still spinning.\" [Nobody is now making it spin, it spins by itself] ~·a:~'\"1~·~~·3.1·~·z::J~~·~z:::::· resultative: \"The old lady has turned the prayer wheel.\" [ An agent has intentionally turned the wheel] 8l·~·~~·z::J~'\"1 resultative: \"The letter is tom.\" rc::::·,~·8l·~·~~·l:.l·~l1 causative: \"He tore the letter (intentionally).\" Certain resultative intransitive verbs may, in some cases, allow the use of an unintentional agent. Ex.: [flz:::::·,~·8l·~·~a:t·z::J~'\"1 \"He tore [res.] the letter (unintentionally).\" ~·~·€€~·fia:~·~·a;'\"1'z::J~'\"1 \"The children broke [res.] the pane (unintentionally).\" However, this construction is rather rare in Standard Spoken Tibetan. Some speakers prefer to use other constructions such as the sentence below which has a similar meaning:"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"354 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN \"Because the children were not careful, the pane broke.\" The resultative verbs include a few intransitive volitional and transitive volitional forms. In such cases, the corresponding causative verbs have a supplementary actant that itself acts on another agent. Ex.: ~p~:rr·~~·,~·~·z~rirf~·~·~l1 \"The child herself put on [res.] her chuba.\" \"\"l'OJ~··~r~·~· ~·~·~~·~·~l1 \"The mother put the chuba on [caus.] the child.\"167 (ditransitive) ~·~,~·~~·&z::r~·~·\"'~, \"The old lady can't get up [res.].\" ~~·~·~,~·l::l~~~·~·t!l~1 \"I helped the old lady to get up [caus.].\" Causative and resultative verbs can appear in the same sentence. The causative puts empha-sis on the cause of the process and the effort of the agent in performing the action, while the resultative verb is concerned only with the result or the consequence of that action. Such con-structions may therefore be translated by using the verbs \"to succeed\", \"to manage\", \"can\" or other modal expressions. These constructions which frequently occur in the literary language also appear in the spoken language. Ex.: 1::1~,~·~~· a;~·~'r<JI::l'~~·liE~·~~·I::ll::l~·~ ~·~·1 \"After the ngagpa had (performed a ritual to) make rain fall, rain did indeed fall!\" \"This cloth is very strong, I can't tear it!\" (lit. however much I [try to] tear it it won't tear) The following examples are taken from literary texts: OJ'9~·~0J~~·~·a1·~1::l·~~·~q~·~·\"'~, \"Even if one rubs, one cannot rub out the undrawn lines on the heart.\" [caus.: ~1::1· res.: ~1::1'] ~~·~~·~OJ~'I::l~~·l::l~'OJ'~~·~·~·,~~·~~·I::l~~·l::l~~·~·?4~ \"If you try to control your own mind inside and you don't succeed, then what's the use of catching somebody else's body outside.\" [caus.: t::'l~~·res.: ~~·] 167.

The preservation of remains (mardung lo.:~;:z;;· tlj~C::') was traditionally practiced in the case of kings and high lamas. A thousand years ago interment seems to have been quite widespread, and archaeological research in various parts of Tibet has indeed revealed many burial sites and stone tombs. In modem times, burial is still performed in certain rare cases, especially if the cause of death is a contagious disease, or in the case of possession by \"demonic powers\" before death, or in the case of infants. Dead bodies may even sometimes be cast into rivers (chusham ~'t!]4o.:l~') and \"offered\" to the fish. Cremation (jinsek ~Oi;· ~,~·) is practiced in areas where wood is abundant. When it is not the case, cremation is practiced only for high lamas and officials. The type of funeral that is selected frequently depends on astrological calculations. The commonest form of funeral throughout Central Tibet, however, is sky burial or jhator (~'ttj\"i]::Z::.'), literally \"scattering to the birds\". The dead body is hacked up by a corpse-cutter or tomdiin (~z:::l~'~Oi;') who summons the vultures to feast on the remains when he has done his work. The dismemberment is usually attended by a lama or monk, who recites prayers for the deceased. Close relatives generally do not attend the occasion, since the process can obviously be quite an ordeal to watch. Sky burial is well adapted to both the environment and culture of Tibet. The dearth of wood and the fact that the ground is frozen hard for much of the year present difficulties for cremation and interment. Another advantage of dismemberment is that the body disappears quickly-in about half an hour-into the Tibetan sky, whereas burial involves slow decompo-sition and being eaten by worms and insects. Traditionally, bodies should be disposed of as soon as possible after death to prevent the namshe (~o.:~·~~'), the consciousness, of the deceased from returning and trying to reinvest its mortal remains.

The destruction of the torma was aimed at neutralizing the negative karma and the obstacles of the old year. Within families [on the occasion of the Gutor], people always drink \"soup of nine ingredients\". In the soup, they put [inside the dumplings] peas, pebbles, wool, peaches and chili, among other things. It is tradi-tionally said that if you find a chili in the soup, it's a sign that you have a sharp tongue. If you find a peach, it shows that you will enjoy good health in the coming year. In the past, early in the morning on the first day of the year, the character called driikar would come to the doors of houses and say things about his mask and staff. This was considered to be auspicious. Driikar is a feature of Tibetan dramatic art.

It is celebrated each year from the fourth to the eighteenth of the first month. Until 1959, more than twenty thousand monks used to assemble. During this period, not only did the government offer soup and tea, but many well-to-do devotees also offered the monks soup, tea or money. In the course of the Great Prayer Festival, all the judicial powers of the City of Lhasa were handed over to the proctor who presided over the general assembly of Ddipung monastery. It was during the Great Prayer Festival that the monks who had studied the five basic subjects [in Lhasa] at [one of the] three monastic seats, Drapung, Sera or Gandan, would take their doctorates in Buddhist sciences. This was an exam that assessed the study of texts. After their defence, they would obtain the title of geshe lharampa. This was instituted by the Fifth Dalai Lama. In the past, at the full moon of the first Tibetan month, \"offerings of the fifteenth\" day were presented on the Bharkor. These offerings were made entirely of colored butter. They represented the buddhas, bodhisattvas, the eight auspicious signs, the \"four harmonious siblings\" [the bird, the hare, the monkey and the elephant], the seven emblems of royalty, etc. These various effigies all had different expressions. Some could be controlled by means of hidden threads, and thus made to move. So it was really a particularly refined art that caused general surprise and amazement.

The purpose was to commemorate the death of the (Great) Fifth Dalai Lama. Its founder was the regent Sanggya Gyatsho. When was the Great Offering created? It was instituted after the regent Sanggya Gyatsho had rebuilt the Potala Palace. This ceremony was broadly similar to that of the Great Prayer Festival, but the most important thing was the great procession. During the latter, [one could see] people lining up, dressed in precious robes as well as many monks carrying a variety of offerings, the eight auspicious signs, the royal emblems and so forth. Then came the wish-fulfilling cow and the character of the monk Nyima Ringpo [who moves extremely slowly]. ChOmphel Dekyi Chomphel Dekyi Chomphel Dekyi Have you ever taken part in the Great Offering? I've never taken part. What is there to see apart from the procession? The immolation of torma, for which the scapegoat (lugong) appears. Oh yes, what's he like? Very strange.

It is located at the foot of a hill to the north of Lhasa. If you travel by car from the Bharkor to Sera, it will take you about fifteen minutes. The founder of this monastery was called Jamchen Choje Shakya Yeshe. It's generally said that the number of monks was five thousand five hundred, but in the 1950s there were up to seven thousand. The monastery of Gandan, to the east of Lhasa, stands on the side of a hill called Wangpori, which belongs to Tagtse. It is one of the largest Gelugpa monasteries. It was founded in 1409 by Tsongkhapa Lobzang Dhragpa. Although it is only thirty-odd kilometers from Lhasa, since the road is in poor condition it takes about an hour and a half. According to oral tradition, there used to be three thousand three hundred monks at Gandan, but in the 1950s there were more than five thousand. Drapung Monastery is also one of the principal Gelugpa monasteries, and it is moreover the largest monastery in Tibet. It was founded in 1416 by Jamyang Choje Trashi Pandan. It is located on the slopes of Gemphel Utse hill to the west of Lhasa. From the Bharkor to Drapung takes no more than twenty minutes by car. It is said that this monastery had seven thousand seven hundred monks, but in the 1950s it actually had around ten thousand. 111~·r·,·~·111 39.2 Vocabulary ~,.,~\"1 'l]l~·~· t~nsa ~· tsgng ~q~· t~p F':!l~~· khatrang ~~·:!]~~· sh~:trang (H) :!]~~·~· thr9;ngka &· '\\1::1~' mJ.rap ~~·--;q~· thQrap §·il.l· die ~~· tshu: ~~·so: :!1~' thr~' ~~·~~· n9;ngna' ~'lj·qryq· + 'lj~~· chaktap nang (H) rs~~·,ry-,~· khongto' :!]~~·~· + ~'lj' thr9;ngka ky9;' Proper nouns 'o/'l]'~' taktse l,.~~~·l~·~· k~pe: utse So..J~·~~·ffi~·~·4,~·ill·4~· ch9:mcen chace shakya y~she' (n.) monastic seat ( n.) fortress, district (n.) side, flank (n.) number (of people) (n.) number (n.) generation ( n.) century (n.) kilometer (n.) way, manner (n.) tradition, custom (n.) kind, sort, class (n.) among (v.)

The nominalizer ~~·tshu:, and its literary homologue ~~~·I!:J' \"manner\", has a second meaning when used with reported speech. It indicates that the speaker is not necessarily sub-scribing to what he or she is reporting. It may be translated by \"they say that\" or \"apparently\".

They may be translated by \"seem\" or \"claim\". In certain contexts, kha'+ch~' also means \"to do some-thing beyond one's capability\". The constructions kha'+ch~' and ntg'(nto')+ch~' go directly after the verb, whereas khu: +ch~' requires a nominalized verb (V+ pa) followed by the genitive.

On that day, Tibetans go to the monasteries of their respective regions to pray. They perform circumambulations around temples and stupas. Many Tibetans abstain from eating meat until the fifteenth day of the month. On the morning of the fifteenth, the inhabitants of Lhasa go to the great temple of the Jhokang and then set off on the Lingkor (the circumambulatory route around Lhasa). Eventually, in the evening, in the Lukhang park, behind the Potala, they spend a nice time playing the piwang (the two-stringed Tibetan viola) and the drapnyan (Tibetan lute), as well as dancing and singing, and taking coracle trips on the Lukhang lake. The world fumigation On the fifteenth day of the fifth month, the inhabitants of Lhasa perform the ceremony for the propitiation of the gods known as the \"general world fumigation\". On that day, people dress in their finest clothing and perform fumigations (by burning juniper). After pitching their tents in the parks, they drink chang, eat heartily and sing operatic songs. The fourth day of the sixth month Because the fourth day of the sixth month is the day on which the Buddha turned the wheel of the Dharma ofthe Four [Noble] Truths, in all parts of Tibet people put on their finest clothing and go to monasteries, sanctuaries, holy mountains and so forth to make offerings and perform circumambulations. For example, the people of Lhasa go to the Great Temple as well as to the monasteries of Sera, Gandan and Drapung to make offerings and perform circumambulations.

The main verb, which is followed by t:l~l· t~', must take the past tense. The connective~~· n~' may optionally be placed between the main verb and the secondary verb: V + ( ~~) t:l~l· +AUX. The secondary verb t:l~l· t~' indicates that an action that was begun in the past is in the process of happening either in the present or from a past point of reference, or that the state of affairs resulting from this action is still present. The secondary verb may be followed by: a) perfective auxiliaries t:l~l·q·fil~· t~'-payin (egophoric), t:l~l·q·~l· t~'-pare' (assertive), t:l~l·~c::.:· t~'-song (testimonial). b) perfect auxiliaries: t:l~l·Ui\\ t~'-yo' (egophoric), t:l~l·Ui'l·~l· t~'-yo:re' (assertive), t:l~l· z:::!~, t~'-sha' (inferential).

This goes on from the first to the fourth of the seventh month in the Norbu lingkha gardens, where opera troupes every day take turns to present an item from the Tibetan opera for a full day. In the past, in the evening when the operatic excerpt was over, the battalions of certain army regiments would hold a parade, and for several days beginning on the fifth, the opera troupes would perform in the houses of certain high noble families. The Zhoton Festival was first cerebrated at Drapung, where there used to be a yogurt banquet. During the festival, the majority of Lhasa's inhabitants would dress in their finest and go to watch the operatic per-formances, taking with them food, tea and chang. At sunset, they would return home singing operatic songs. The Ceremony ofPandan Lhamo In the past, at the time of the full moon (the fifteenth) of the tenth Tibetan month, there was the ceremony of the goddess Pandan Lhamo. On that day in Lhasa, the goddess was brought (lit. invited) to the passage of Rabsal, south of the Bharkor, and from there, facing south, she went to meet the tsiin (a local divinity) of Dhribdzong. On that day, the inhabitants of the center of Lhasa would prepare an elaborate meal and host the inhabitants of the ZhOl area [at the foot of the Potala] who came to see Pandan Lhamo. Similarly, on the evening of the [ceremony of] Gandan N gamcho, the inhabitants of the ZhOl sector would hold a lavish reception for the inhabitants of the central quarter. It is because of this [association between an area and a ceremony] that there are the customary sayings, \"Lhasa and Palharitro (name of the ceremony of Pandan Lhamo )\" and \"Zhol inhabitants and Gandan Ngamcho\". From the beginning of the tenth month up to the fifteenth day, children are tradition-ally given money for buying sweets by their relatives and others close to them. This is why chil-dren eagerly look forward to this day.

The auxiliary ygng is used with the :first person (singular or plural), whereas trg is used with the second and third persons (singular or plural).

For this purpose the nominalizers l:.l'-pa, u.ltfj'-ya' and ~·-kyu are used (see Lessons 11, 25) . They may be followed by the genitive or oblique case (when the function of the clause requires it). The syn-tactic position of the nominal clause in the sentence depends on its function as subject, object or complement.

Literary Tibetan has been around for over a thousand years. The earliest texts go back to the seventh century. In terms of its quality, originality, diversity and sheer volume, the classical literature of the Land of Snows ranks among the great literary traditions of Asia. The Sayings of Sakya Pandita (thirteenth century), the songs of Milariipa (twelfth century) the poems of the Sixth Dalai Lama and the Epic of Gesar of Ling are already a part of the world's literary heritage. Whether written in prose or verse, traditional Tibetan literature covers a wide range of domains, including Buddhism, history, medicine, astrology, grammar and poetry. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, Tibet has seen the gradual development of a modem literature that follows on directly from this tradition. The landmark figure of Gendiin Chompel, who died in 1950, provides the link between the classical style and the emergence of modem genres. However, it was only at the beginning of the 1980s that Tibet witnessed a real explosion of this new literature. Innovative genres, such as the short story, free verse and even the novel began to appear, while some thirty new literary magazines made a significant contribution to the development of the field. Contemporary Tibetan writing has been influenced by several currents: classics in Chinese and in European languages, as well as canonical and Classical Tibetan literature, not to mention the oral traditions of the nomads. Tibetan authors write in Modem Literary Tibetan, a superb language that has remained very close to the classical style, even though it has evolved gradually and been enriched by the adoption of many neologisms. The last thirty years have seen the publication, in this modem style, of numerous works covering an extraordinary diversity of subjects such as science, politics, economics, astrology, history, Buddhism, medicine, education and literary criticism. The preferred literary genres are, understandably enough, poetry and short stories, which give the authors an opportunity to deal with Tibetan thought and culture. Fiction is the ideal medium through which to describe the people and the landscape of the high plateau, and to evoke both ancient traditions as well as the upheavals that the society has experienced. The perspectives of these writers on the Tibetan world are entirely new and original. It will be evident, from a comparison of the following four poems, that Modem Literary Tibetan doesn't represent a break from the classical language. The first poem was written by Sakya Pandita in the thirteenth century; the second and third are attributed to the Sixth Dalai Lama (early seventeenth century), while the last was written in the late twentieth century by Sangda Dorje, one of the authors of this Manual."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"~·l~lq·~~·~~·~t:l'z:.l1 ~r:::·tl.lr:::·~~r:::~·q'\\·~·~,.t:l~1 ~~·~~·l,.,~.~~·q~·~~1 ~· ,\". ~r:::· tl.lr:::· fil,·~F~· &~~11 ~·~f§C:::f§C:::'l~::l\\'351 r:::·~·,4,·~~·,tl.l~'lt:::'1 E:l,·~r:::·~r:::·~·&l·~~ a,•E:lt:::'t:l~ '\\'~~· ~t:l~'Ult:::'11 s~·q~·~·,.~,·~r:::·1 ~·lr:::·~,·q~'t:l4,~·~r:::·1 ~·s~·~~~·~·~·as1 t:l~t:l~·~r:::·~t:l'~'3:1'~~,1 Lesson 41 -~ z:::r ffi~· <t? \"Those who achieve something Without reflecting on it cannot be deemed wise; Though woodworms may leave traces like letters, They aren't scribes. \" \"0 white crane, Lend me your wings!

This poem, for example, has to be read along both diagonals and then across, as one would normally read."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 Outlines of the Differences between Literary and Spoken Tibetan The differences between Literary (Modem and Classical) and Spoken Tibetan lie in the lexicon (vocabulary), grammatical words and, to a lesser extent, syntax and pronunciation. The classical language is characterized by its conciseness and by the corresponding impor-tance of context and cultural background. A text in the classical style would be shorter than a Standard Tibetan rendering of the same material. The classical, literary language owes its concentrated, terse character to a number of factors: -Nouns, adjectives and verbs tend to be monosyllabic, whereas the oral language tends to use polysyllabic forms. -Verbs can function autonomously, whereas oral Tibetan requires the systematic use of auxiliaries. -Case markers, nominalizers and conjunctions may be left out when the semantic context is clear enough for them to be redundant. Ellipses of this sort are especially common in poetry, to satisfy the demands of the metre. -Literary Tibetan often foreshortens compound words by omitting syllables. -Coreferential pronouns and nouns are generally avoided. When there is no ambiguity, the \"subject\" is introduced only once, and may not reappear in a given passage. And finally, from a syntactic point of view, the written language is often more flexible than the oral. For example, adjectives and relative constructions may be placed either before or after the noun, whereas in oral Tibetan they almost always follow and precede them respectively."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"396 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Anyone who knows colloquial Tibetan can quite easily learn the literary language, and vice versa. The following pages, containing a systematic survey of the main points of difference, are intended to serve as a bridge between the two registers. The lists presented here are by no means exhaustive, but at least they illustrate some of the fundamental differences. For further details about the literary language we would highly recommend The Classical Tibetan Language (Beyer, 1992) and, in French, le Clair Miroir (Kesang Gyurme, 1994). 1. Current and literary pronunciation Literary Tibetan is used by Tibetans of all regions, however different their spoken dialects may be, as well as in Bhutan, Ladakh and the dozen or so ethnically Tibetan enclaves of Nepal such as Khumbu (the Sherpas), Mustang and Dolpo, as well as by speakers of languages other than Tibetan such as the Mongols, Kalmyks, Buryats and, more recently, Western practitioners of V ajrayana Buddhism. Obviously, the pronunciation of Literary Tibetan will vary according to the reader's regional provenance, so that a native of Kham or Amdo, for example, will read a text in very different accent from a Central Tibetan. In the following pages, examples of Literary Tibetan will be presented in a transcription that corresponds to the reading pronunciation by a speaker of Standard (or Central) Tibetan. As a general rule, conversational pronunciation of Standard Tibetan is identical with that of Literary Tibetan170, and follows the conventions for spelling and pronunciation (see Table 10 in Appendix 6). Certain words, however, are pronounced differently in colloquial usage (this pro-nunciation will be unmarked) and according to literary convention (marked with an L below), as when someone is reading aloud or quoting. For example, ctQ 'bri, \"the yak cow\", is pronounced /trjj in literary language and /pjj in colloquial usage. Similarly, in the case of the following words: ~·~~·sbra-nag \"nomad tent\" · /tr~na'/(L), /p~na'/; 'CJ.~\"'~'bZhengs \"to get up\" (H), \"to construct\" /sh~ng'/(L), /sh~ng'/; t:\\E{~~· 'dzegs \"to climb\" /ts~'/(L), Its~'/; ry~·~3.1 tog-tsam \"a little\" /toktsam/ (L), /te(t)s/; §~· brin \"to be sellable, to be sold\" /thrln/ (L), /phlm/; 4~·~·c.l!~\\ shes+ kyi-yod \"I know\" /she'+kiyo'/ (L), /shen+kiyo'/; ~·ar\"'· rnga-mong \"camel\" /ngamong/ (L), /among/; ~\"'·z:r· sprang-po \"beggar\" /trangpo/(L), /pangko/; 3:l·l,-~· mi dgos \"I don't need\" /mj_kg'/ (L), 1m!:! kg'/. These differences may be explained in terms of the simple rules that will be set out below. The rules will make it possible to account for the majority of cases in which colloquial pronun-ciation differs markedly from the literary form. Colloquial pronunciation is not accommodated by special spelling, except in the case of certain modem writings that try to reproduce vernacular speech. 170. There are some minor discrepancies that occur in a very careful literary or reading pronunciation (and in some cases of hypercorrection): The final suffixed letters g, l, r are then respectively pronounced as /k, I, r/ (while in normal reading k yields a glottal stop; I and r a lengthening of the preceding vowel.). Initial aspirate consonants in second syllables usually keep their aspiration in careful reading while the aspiration is lost otherwise."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 397 Features of colloquial pronunciation • \"Floating nasals\". • The disappearance of the subscript r of a labial. Thus a labial /p/ is pronounced instead of the usual retroflex affricate /tr/. • The disappearance of the semi-vowel /w/ in the nominal suffixes /wa/ and /wo/. • The transformation of the labial /p/ into a /k/ when it is preceded by a velar in the nominal and adjectival suffixes /po/, /pa/, /pu/. The following unusual phenomena may be added to these basic rules: • The transformation of vowels within certain words. • The pronunciation of certain consonants that are usually silent. 1. 1 The appearance of \"floating nasals\" within a word \"Floating nasals\" do exist in the literary register, but are more characteristic of the spoken language. They are produced when the following letters (and groups of letters) appear at the beginning of the second syllable: The prefixes 'a r.l.... (a chung) and mOl and the majority of combinations involving an l: zl ~·, ld ~·, lt lft', lj ~·. Furthermore, when the letter l ~· appears at the end of the first syllable it may also produce a nasal. The prefixes 'a and m, as well as the combinations that can produce a nasal, are called \"nasalizers\" (marked as N in the transcription). The resulting nasal is the dental n, the labial m or the velar ng, depending on the case. It is generally articulated in the same place (homorganic arti-culation) as the final consonant of the first syllable (S 1) or the first consonant of the second (S2). The following configurations may be encountered: • /p/ before the nasalizer is pronounced as /m/. Ex.: ~q~·r.l....~,~'zhabs 'degs > sh~p+Nt~' > sh~mte' \"service\" ~r:::l'r.l....~,. zhib 'jug> shTp+Nc~· > shJ.mcu' \"research\" • /k/ before the nasalizer is pronounced as /ng/. Ex.: 3:1,·~~· mig-'khrul > mTk+Ntru: > mTngtru: \"illusion\" • a nasal consonant before the nasalizer remains unchanged. Ex.: ~~·r.l....~'sngon 'gro > ngontro, ~~·r.l....~~· smon 'dun> montun"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"398 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN • If the nasalizer is preceded by a vowel or a lengthening (due to an r or an l), a nasal consonant is produced in the place of articulation of the following consonant, that is, the first consonant of the second syllable (S2).

These nasals are described as \"floating\" inasmuch as they are not entirely obligatory, espe-cially during \"precise\" reading. By contrast, they are almost always used in the spoken language. Thus ~·0-1~ rgya-mtsho \"ocean\" is pronounced /ky9:_mtso/ as well as /ky9:_tso/, ~·a.lffi21-i' rgyu-mtshan \"reason\" as either /ky'=!mtsan/ or /ky'=!tsan/. But !!j'.¥!' sku-zla \"spouse\" (H) is always pro-\"' nounced /kunta/ and not */kuta/.

Fortunately, the number of words that have this double pronunciation is rather limited. The colloquial pronunciation can be deduced by dropping the subscript r of the labial. There is no systematic rule for dropping the subscript r, and the optional pronunciation will there-fore be flagged on each occasion.

They are determined by the last phoneme of the preceding syllable. -The /w/ of the suffix /wa/ disappears after the consonants /r/, /1/ and /ng/ which are then doubled:171 Ex.: 0-l,~'z::J' mgar-ba \"blacksmith\" k9,rwa (L), k9,rra ~.:r:;·r:1· skor-ba \"circuit\", \"to go around\" korwa (L), korra £:lil,l'r:J' thal-ba \"dust\" thiiwa (L), thalia ~il,l'r:J' brel-ba \"to be busy\" thr~:wa (L), thr~lla ,~il,l'z:;J' gsal-ba \"clearer\" sa:wa (L), Sarra ';ljil,l'r:J' skal-ba \"fortune, lot\" ka:wa (L), kalla l~il,l'r:J' dmyal-ba \"hell\" nya:wa (L), nyalla 0-lt:::'z::J' mang-ba \"majority\" m9,ngwa (L), m9,ngnga ~r::::·q· yong-ba \"all right\" ygngwa (L), ygngnga ~ll,l·q· sol-ba \"charcoal\" so:wa (L), solla Colloquial pronunciation is sometimes reproduced by the spellings used in letter-writing (though never in literary texts): ~.:r:;·q·, 0-lt:::'z::J' and ~r::::·q· are accordingly written: ~.:r:;·.:r:;· skor-ra, 0-lt:::'t:::' mang-nga and ~r::::·r:::: yong-nga. -The suffixes /wa/ and /wo/ take the form of a lengthening after /a/ and /o/: Ex.: %f~·q lha-sa-ba \"inhabitant of Lhasa\" lhasawa (L), lhasa: ~q·~·q· slob-grwa-ba \"student\" loptrawa (L), laptra: ~·q· lta-ba \"vision, theory\" tawa (L), ta: ~·i:j'· ngo-bo \"essence\" nggwo (L), ngg: ,~·t:l· gtso-bo \"principal, main\" tsowo (L), tso: -The suffixes /pal, /po/, /pu/ are pronounced respectively172 /ka/, /ko/, ku/: Ex.: 4,'E:l' shog-bu \"paper\" shokpu (L), shukku173 i:i'r::::·E:l· bong-bu \"donkey\" phgngpu (L), ph\\:jngku st:::'E:l' sbrang-bu \"bee\" tr9,ngpu (L), p9,ngku tll,.q-. yag-po \"good\" y9,kpo (L), y9,kko tll,'CJ' yag-pa \"better\" y9,kpa (L), y9,kka ~r::::·q'· kong-po \"Kongpo\" (a region in Tibet) kongpo (L), kongko ~r::::·q'· sprang-po \"beggar\" trangpo (L), pangko 31~,~·q· mgyogs-po \"rapid\" kygkpo (L), kygkko 171. From a strictly phonetic point of view, these doubled consonants are pronounced like simple consonants (like the ll in \"wallow\"). 172. This may be seen as a case of assimilation: when the labial is preceded by a velar (plosive k or nasal ng), the locus of its articulation changes and it becomes a velar. 173. Remember that geminate consonants (kk, pp, etc.) are pronounced as if there were only one consonant. Only the tone is affected."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 401 Colloquial pronunciation may be reflected in informal spelling: thus 4~·~· and ~~·q· are sometimes written as 4~·~· shog-gu and ~~·~ yag-ga. ....,_ Note: This pronunciation is not systematic: thus ~Sl~·r:::r 'brei ba \"relationship\" is pro-nounced /tr~:wa/ and never *tr~lla. Furthermore, it applies only in the case of the suffixes pa, po, pu and not the combinations of /k+p/ in general. For example, l3l~''Elr::::~· /makpung/ \"army\" never becomes *makkung, and likewise l3l~·lq' ~'/makpon/ \"general\" is never pronounced *makon. Similarly, El~'J:.J' /thakpa/ \"rope\" never becomes *thakka. 1.4 Modification of the pronunciation of vowels in certain words In most cases, vowel changes occur in polysyllabic words, and are caused by the influence of other vowels in the same word. There is a sort of vowel harmony at work.174 The variations are generally restricted to closely-related vowels: e I i, o I u, Ci I i. Changes may also occur within monosyllabic words, in which case it is no longer a question of vowel harmony. There is no way of predicting this sort of pronunciation, but fortu-nately there are very few examples. Remember that the examples given here do not apply to lite-rary pronunciation. -The vowel e is sometimes pronounced /a/. Ex.: ~~~~· 'dzegs \"to climb\" ts~· (L), tsi!', ffi~· tsheg \"intersyllabic mark\" tshe' (L), tsha', l::l~r::::· bzheng \"to build\" (H), sh~ng (L), shi!ng, l::l4~~· bshegs \"to die\" (H) she' (L), sha' -The vowel u (normally pronounced /u/ in the combinations ud, un, us) becomes /i/ in certain words. Ex.: ~~·~· skyag-rdzun \"lie\" kyaktsun (L), kyaktsin, ~l· phud \"to take off' phu' (L), phT', ~~·~~· sdug-rus \"resistance\" t~kru' (L), t~kri'. -The vowel o is sometimes pronounced /u/ in certain words: Ex.: 4t::::'l::l~' shing-bzo \"carpentry\" shTngsu, 4~·~· shog-gu \"paper\" shOkku,qr::::·~· bong-bu \"donkey\" ph~ngku On the other hand, it sometimes happens that the vowel u is pronounced /o/. Very excep-tionally, the variations that are caused by vowel harmony are formalized in the spelling. Thus l::l~' bcu \"ten\" is usually pronounced /cO/ both when it stands alone as well as in the compounds l::l~' ~~· bcu-gcig \"eleven\" /cOci'/, l::l~·~~~· bcu-gnyis \"twelve\" /cunyi'/, l::l~·~~3l' bcu-gsum \"thirteen\" /cOksum/, but is pronounced /co/ or /co/ and is actually written with an o in the compounds l::l~·~· bco-lnga \"fifteen\" /conga/ and l::l~'z:::!~l· bco-brgyad \"eighteen\" /copkya'/, since the vowel of the second syllable is more open (a, a). 174. This phenomenon can also be described as an assimilation ofthe vowel aperture."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"402 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN -the vowel e is pronounced as /i/ in certain words: Ex.: 4~·~~1' shes-rig \"culture\" shTri' And finally, there are occasional exceptions such as: ~·q· Iei-ba \"dung\" dwa (L), cowa. 1.5 Special pronunciation of the rhyme 'ab(s)' In certain colloquial words, the suffixes ab and abs are pronounced /o/ (sometimes follow-ed by a lengthening). Here are some examples: lt!]~'.::t:;t:l' dga '-rab k9;rap (L), k9;ro \"quite a few\", ~f<iq~· sku-zhabs kushap (L), kusho \"sir\", ~q~· grabs thr§;p (L), trg: \"to be about to\" 1. 6 Special pronunciation of certain consonants In certain rare cases, the consonant /p/ figures in a word even when its presence isn't justi-fied by the spelling. Ex.: c:J§§'''ft' bzo-lta sgpta: \"shape\", F':::J~' kha-zas /khapsa'/ \"fried pastry\", ~·~· rma-bya /mapca/ \"peacock\",~·~~· sgra-snyan /tr§;pnyan/ \"Tibetan lute\", etc. On the other hand, the consonants /ng/ and /n/ are sometimes pronounced /m/ at the end of certain words: ~t:::'sgrung tr!:!ng (L), tr!:!m \"story, tale\", ~~'zin sJ.n (L), slm \"to seize, grasp\", .9~· brin trln (L), phlm \"to be sold\", ~~t::::· mchong chong (L), cham \"to jump\", 4t::::shong shong (L), shum \"to fit\", ~~~·mnan nan (L), nam (or even lam) \"to press down\". 2. The lexicon 2. 1 Differences in the vocabulary The lexicon is one of the fields in which there are major discernable differences between Literary and Spoken Tibetan, even if the basic vocabulary is the same in both registers. It should not be supposed, however, that there is a clear distinction between the two: some literate Tibetans may use in their daily language words that are more characteristic of the literary register, while certain journals and texts may use colloquial terminology. In the lists of examples, the words marked with an (L) appear only in literary language. In the subsequent examples, words to the left of the \"equals\" sign (=) correspond to Literary Tibetan, while those to the right belong to the colloquial register. The few words that are not used in the literary language are marked with the sign (*L). -Verbs: Ex.: ~~· = ?4q~· \"to arrive\" (H), ~t!]'= ~~t::::· \"to see\", ~~l'/ t:l~l· = t!j~t::::· \"to do\" (H), ~~·; t:l~l· = ~q· \"to speak\", ~q·= ~~t::::~· \"to jump\"/ .::t:;t::::'4't:l$t:l' \"to commit suicide\","},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 403 ~z:;il ~~·= ~:\\~' \"to go\", ~~·= Z<j~z::::· \"to give\" (H), ~~·= z::J~~· \"to think\", ~Z::::t:\\'1 ~~~· = arl· \"to be, to exist\", z::]~~·= ~l'fZ<j'~,~· \"to be hungry\", ~~:= 1:\\~l·~·rz::::~· \"to be satis:fied\"flZ<jt:\\ \"to be happy, to rejoice\", 1:\\~Z<j'l ~Z<j'= ~l· \"to be afraid\", z::J~~·= 1:\\~l· \"to desire\", f!i' = f!i~'t:\\fZ<j'a:iZ<j~'\"to age, grow old\", z::117~~·= ~z::::~· \"to be born\" (H), Z<j~ ~·z::1· z::1ryz::J' =~~·~~·~,.\"to pray\", etc. -Nouns: z::J~~·~~·= ~~·~~· \"face\" (H) I Z<j~z::::·~·; s~·~· Iff~' = ~·~· (*L) \"child\", ~·z::1· = ~~· ~ffiZ<j'(*L) \"ear\", z::14~·Z<j~~· = l,.f!i~· \"teacher\" or~,~·~· \"friend\", ~·1 ~l· = ~~~· \"mind\", ~·~·= ~· \"age\", m·q·= ~· \"human being\", ~~·~· = ~,~·~· \"idiot\", '?~·= ~·~· \"day\", ~Z<j~·ffi~· = 4t:::'~Z<j~' \"forest\", ~~· = Z<j~Z<j~·r:J· \"body\", a:.t·~z::::·= 4~·~· \"mirror\", :::!~'= F'~Z<j' \"food\",~~·= ~Z<j'~Z<j'(*L) \"clothing\", ~l'= ~·c£· \"illness\", etc. -Adjectives: ~,~. = UJZ<j'~· \"good\", ~~·= ~~,~·r:J· \"quick\", ~l·~·~t:::'z::J' = ~~~· ~· t:\\~·r:J·1 ~~~·r:J· \"beautiful\", 3ll·~·~t:::'z::J'I ~ffiZ<j' =~':!]'\"excellent, extraordinary\" -Adverbs: 4~·~· = ~'5Z<j~' \"very\", ~'E],' = ~t:::'z::J~~· \"like, as\", ~~·1 ~~~·~l'l ~·~~·1 ~·~l· = ffiz::::·~·l Z<jZ::::'Z<j' \"all\", ~·~· = ~z::::·~· \"many\", ~·~·1 1:\\Z<jt:\\'~Z<j'l F'~Z<j' = F'4~' \"some\", 1:\\z::lt:\\'~Z<j'l f' ~· = ~z::::·~z::::·1 ,~,·~· \"only, solely\", ~·~·~Z<j·= ~~·~z::::· \"immediately\", ~~'E:l.'l ~t:::'E3l' = ryZ<j·;3~· \"a little\", ~z::::~·~~· = ~z::::·~~· \"tomorrow\" 2.2 Verbalizers In the spoken language, many verbs consist of a noun followed by a verbalizer (see Les-son 14.). The most frequently encountered verbalizers are ~Z<j' rgyag \"to make\", 5l· byed \"to do\", z::1ryz::::· btang \"to send\". The noun that precedes the verbalizer is often disyllabic, and is sometimes made up of verb roots that function as autonomous verbs in the written language. In the spoken language, verbs can be monosyllabic, disyllabic or trisyllabic. In Literary Tibetan, verbalizers are not used and verbs are usually monosyllabic or some-times disyllabic: Ex.: ~z::J' \"to learn\" (L), ~z::::· \"to study\" (L) = ~z::1·~z::::·5l· \"to study\" t:lf)Z<j' \"to examine\" (L), l~l· \"to research\" (L) = t:lf)Z<j'l~l·5l· \"to examine\" z::::~·,~~· \"to rest\" (L) = z::::~·,~·~Z<j' \"to rest\" ~~·~~·\"to trick\" (L) = ~~·~~·z::1ryz::::· \"to trick\" ~~·~~·\"to be tricked\" (L) = ~~·~~·~z::J~' \"to be tricked\" ~·\"to get angry\" (L) = fi'z::::·~·~z::::· \"to get angry\""},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"404 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN 2.3 Nominal and adjectival suffixes In Literary Tibetan, substantives and adjectives are usually made up of a monosyllabic root without a suffix, whereas the spoken language uses suffixes such as pa, po, ma, etc. But the reverse is also true: in a few cases literary words have a suffix that is absent in the spoken lan-guage. -Nouns: Ex.: ~· = ~·~tlj' (*L) \"nose\", ~0-1·= ~0-l'ftl]'(*L) \"road, way\", ~~· = ~~·r.r \"cloud\", ~,. = ~,·r.r \"hand\",~·= ~·0-1· \"smell\", l,-~·= l,-~·r.r \"monastery\", ~·CS·= ~· \"mountain\", ~·CS·=o= ~· (~~· c:l') \"river\". -Adjectives: Ex.: ~tlj' = ~t~j·c:l· \"black\", l'1~· = l'1~·c:l· \"white\", 0-1~~· = 0-l~~·q· \"beautiful\", ~0-1· = ~0-1·c:l· \"delicious\", ffi·= ~~·c:l·\"big\", ~~· = ~~·r.r I~~·~,. \"old\",~·= ~~·~·c:l· \"easy\". 2.4 Semantic evolution There are some words that have the same form in Literary and Spoken Tibetan, but have acquired a different meaning. Many of the words listed below are derived from the vocabulary of the Dharma, but have lost their meaning in the spoken language. -Verbs: Ex.: l::l~z:::J~' tr\\dp \"to realize, achieve (L), to sell\", for example ~·q~q~·lha tr!::!p: \"to realize or invoke a god\" (L), ~·~tlj'l::l~l::l~' cala' tr\\dp \"to sell things\". -Adjectives: Ex.: ~}:::::·~q· ch9,ngcup \"bodhi= enlightenment (L)\", ~r:::::·~q'I::.J' changcuppa \"expert\". -Nouns: Ex.: lo.l'~tlj' th§:mtsi' \"samaya, initiatic bond\" (L), \"happy coincidence\". z::J~l·q~· sota \"merit and happiness derived from virtue\" (L), \"luck\". ~0-1~·~~· semdi.n \"sentient being (human or animal)\" (L), \"animal\".

They are of two kinds: phonic and graphic. The former usually occur only in the case of quadrisyllabic expressions, and consist of omitting the second and fourth syllables. Ex.: ~r:::::·~0-1~' Ch§:ngsem = ~r:::::·~q·~Cl.l~'ll::..ll-\\' Ch§:ngcup sempa \"bodhisattva\", ~·,4,~· th~she' = ~·q~~'tl]4tl]~'l::..l'th~shin shekpa \"Tathagata\", ~,·~~· thekcen= ~tlj'l::..l'~~·c:l· thekpa chenpo \"Mahayana\", ~tlj·~~· chaktor Chakdor= ~tlj·~·~·~· chakna tgrce \"the bodhisattva Vajrapani (or Chaknadorje)\", l,·~q· k~lop = l,.~~·lr:::::'~l::l'0-1' k~kan-tang lopma \"master"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 405 and disciple(s)\", ~::::·~~· shlngtrok = ~::::·q·l::::·~§'~·z::r shlngpa-tang trgkpa \"farmers and nomads\". The same principle applies in the spoken language for abridging personal names of four syllables: Ex.: ~·~~· tshetor Tshedor = ~·~::::·~·~· tshering tgrce Tshering Dorje, z::::J~'lt:.l'\"'l' trapa: Trapal = q~·4~'lt:.J'\"'l'~~· trashi' pantan Trashi Pandan, ffi~·~0-1· • chokyam Chogyam = ffi~· ~· ~· 0-1~· cho-kyi kya(m)tsho Chokyi Gyatsho (or Gyamtsho), z::::J~l·~~· sotron Sodron = z::::J~l· ~0-1~'~'\"'1'0-l' sonam tro:ma Sonam Drolma. Note: In some cases, a resyllabification occurs whereby the prefixed or the superscribed letter of the following syllable is interpreted as the final of the preceding syllable. The written orthography records this phenomenon. For example, the last letter in Chogyam, or Tshedor be-longs in fact to the fourth syllable (that has been omitted), respectively mtsho and rje. Graphic abbreviations consist of using special signs to replace a group of letters. The fol-lowing are the commonest: Ex.: -The circle 0, written above a letter, replaces the suffix m. tl.1 = '\"'10-l' -The~· Ta (reversed t) substitutes for the suffix~~· gs. Ex.: '\"'l~ = '\"'1~~·; ~~· = ~~~· -There are also abbreviations in which two syllables are graphically compacted into a single syllable, Ex.: El = ~·a:f· \"girl\"; ~l· = ~·~l \"hour\"; z::::J~~·q~·~~· = q~·4~·q~·~~~· \"best wishes\". 2. 6 Punctuation Literary Tibetan has no punctuation in the European sense of the term: there are no syn-tactic signs to mark off groups of words, clauses, enumerations, etc. However, there are a number of signs to indicate breathers and pauses in the text, although their use is neither systematic or obligatory. Of all the symbols used in Tibetan, the closest to the European notion of punctuation is the simple bar 1 called ~::::· 4l' rkyang-shad or ~~·~::::· tsheg-ring. It goes directly after the last letter of a word, in the place of the intersyllabic dot. There are two exceptions to this rule: the simple bar is not used after the letter ~· g, when the latter carries no subscript or superscript: ~; and after"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"406 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN the letter r::;'nga, an intersyllabic dot is placed before the rkyang-shad to avoid confusion with the letter t:l1: r:;·rs This punctuation bar may be used to mark the end of a clause, to make it easier to break up a sentence and to emphasize the rhythm of the statements by marking pauses. It may also occur after individual words, especially in the case of lists. It may also go after case markers (0, gis, nas, Ia, du, las, etc.), conjunctions (zhing, dang, nas, ste, Ia, etc.) and verbs, as well as after the final particle(.(· ('o). The rkyang-shad may be represented in European languages by a comma, a semicolon, a colon, a question mark or a period. Note that the simple bar is used at the end of each line in poetic verse. In Literary Tibetan, many of the tasks that European languages assign to punctuation are fulfilled by grammatical particles. Thus (.(· 'o (and its variants) signify a period or the end of reported speech, t:l~~· bcas concludes a list and ~~· ces closes reported speech. One meaning of the particle ~· ste is comparable to the function of the semicolon. And finally, depending on the context, the particle t:\\o-1' 'am may correspond to a question mark, a colon or a comma. Apart from the single bar 1 (rkyang-shad), Tibetan literature also uses the following symbols: The sign~ called ~tl]'Ol~' yig-mgo or l~·~l· dbu-'khyud, which marks the beginning of a text or of a page. However, other indicators of new chapters may appear on the top left-hand corner of a page. The swasti precedes texts concerned with ethics, the stem and the lotus denote official correspondence, while the jewel introduces chapters that deal with religion. -The double bar 11 called ~~· 4l' nyis-shad usually marks the end of a section, and may be rendered by a full stop. In verse texts, the double bar is always written at the end of each verse. -Two double bars 1111 calledt:l~'4l' bzhi-shad mark the end of a chapter or an entire work. -The \"serpentine\" i called ~~·4l' sbrul-shad marks a separation between two chapters. -The barf called ~~·~~·E:ir:;' 4l' rin-chen spungs-shad which is surmounted by one, two or three small dots, appears on the left of a folio when the line begins with a single syllable, to signify the end of the preceding sentence. -The sign ~ called Zl]i]~· 4l' gter-shad takes the form of two circles placed one on top of the other, and separated by a horizontal line.

For examples, see the poems quoted in Lesson 41, section 5)."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 407 A few other punctuation marks may be added to this list: -The ~·~·r· ku-ru-kha or X (cross), which stands for omitted material that is frequently repeated within the text (in the case of prayers, for example). -A little circle written beneath a syllable, which is intended to attract the reader's attention to the word in question. It corresponds to underlining in European languages. -Sentences written in letters smaller than those of the main text, corresponding to notes on the original work that have been added by the author or a later commentator. Inverted commas and, more rarely, question marks, which are sometimes used in mod-em writings. 3. Grammatical words and syntax Certain grammatical words have a completely different form in oral and written Tibetan, although they perform identical functions. In certain cases, however, there are significant syntac-tic differences. The main differences are summarized below, in relation to the following: nouns, particles, cases, syntax of adjectives, the noun clause, verbal inflection, auxiliaries, reported speech markers and nominalizers. 3. 1 Pronouns Classical Tibetan contains numerous pronominal forms that are not used in the spoken language. In the following lists, the forms that are followed by \"L\" are literary, whereas the un-marked forms are used in both the spoken and literary registers. • Personal pronouns The plural of these pronouns is formed by adding one of the following markers: l€· -tso, ~Ol~' nam, <>~· -ca', <>~'~Ol~' -ca'nam. In some cases, the reflexive ~z::::· r~ng, \"same\", may be added to the pronoun without changing its meaning. -First person singular (I): z::::· ng~, r:::Jl~· t~' (L), ~l· ng~· (L, el.), a:~·ngg' (L, el.), :g~· thran (L, h), \\l~'t.l khQpa (L, h, masc.), \\1~·3l· khQmo (L, h, fern.), f·~· khowo (L, masc.), f1·3l· khomo (L, fern.), ~z::::·~l· r~ngnyi', 8,'z:rl \"\"\\J ~ku.

Instead, we find the morpheme ~Ol'-am and its variants (see Table 9, in Appendix 6), or the mor-pheme ~· -e. Note that the interrogative particle (l;j· is placed before the verb, unlike the other interrogative particles, which go afterwards. In the spoken language, 111' a which is related to U;j· e has a distinct meaning indicating doubt (not a question). • Articles and number markers The marker of the definite plural ~· tsho is used in both Spoken and Literary Tibetan. There are, however, two other markers, l~· th9;' and ~0-1~· nam', that occur in the Literary language (and in some dialects) are hardly ever used in Standard Spoken Tibetan. The indefinite singular marker ~~'d', is used in both registers, but is spelled in three ways in the literary language:~~· shl', 4~· shT', ~~· d', depending on the last letter of the preceding word (see Lesson 6)."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"410 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN • The postpositions While some postpositions are specific to the literary language, most occur in both registers. ~c::·; ~~'(L) = ~c::· \"on, on top of', OJ~~· (L) = ~~· \"after\", ~~·I ~~t::l'(L) = ~~ll,l'j ~El~' \"among, in the middle\", Ol~il,l' (L) = ~El~' \"in the centre\", etc. Postpositions are used in the same way in both registers: I Noun+ (gen.)+ Post+ (obl./abl.) I The syntax ofpostpositions is more varied in literary than in Spoken Tibetan. For example, the use of the genitive before the proposition and the case marker after it are both optional in Lite-rary Tibetan. Thus there are four possible structures, as the following examples illustrate. cs ~·~·~c::·~·8l·,·~·'ttc::~·q~·05~·CJ· ~~1 cs ~·~c::·~·8l·,·~·'ttc::~·q~·05~·CJ· ~~1 CS~·~·~c::·8l·,·~·'ttc::~·q~·05~·CJ·~~1 CS~·~c::·8l·,·~·'ttc::~·q~·05~·CJ·~~1 s~·~r~~·~'Ol'f'~1 s~·~~·~·Ol·f·~1 s~·~,.~~'o.J'f'~1 s~·~~·o.J'f'~1 • Connectives \"There are four styles of writing in Tibet.\" idem idem idem \"to carve a mani on a rock\" idem idem idem Connectives (coordinating and subordinating conjunctions) constitute a category in which there are major divergences from the spoken language.

All the cases used in Spoken Tibetan also occur in the literary register, but their forms and functions"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Appendix I 411 are more numerous in the latter. The aim here is not to provide a detailed description of cases in Literary Tibetan, only to set out the main differences from the case system of the spoken lan-guage. Apart from their case functions when they are associated with nouns, all case markers176 have a connective function when they are linked to verbs. Literary Tibetan has the following six cases (see Lesson 4): ,~ khl' 177: agentive I ._l ___ ,_._k_h __ i: _g_en_i_tiv_e __ ___.ll '\"'!' 19, I~· th!:J, I~· n9,: oblique ~~·n~· 1'\"-1~'1~': ablative II lc:::· th9,ng: associative II 0: absolutive •Agentive: The form that this case takes depends on the last letter of the preceding syllable: ~ ~ (gis) khl', ~~ (gyis) khyl', ~~ (kyis) kyT', ~ (s) -', tij~ (yis) yl' and the archaic form a,~ ('i) -' (see Les-son 8.4). The case functions of this marker are practically identical in the two registers. The agen-tive indicates the agent, the instrument, the cause and the manner, and forms adverbs. The applications listed below are limited to the literary language. The marker khl' is sometimes used as a connective by being directly appended to a verb. The translation will vary according to context: \"and\", \"after\", \"because\" ... Ex.: [Zfc:::·,~~·~~·af,·~~·~·~l·,%,·~c:::·~~·u.Jc:::'c:J~~·tlj'c:;:·1 khong nyT' chTr lg'-ki' chutso' cT' song c~· y9,ngkyar ygng \"The two of them went back and returned an hour later.\" In Literary Tibetan, the agentive marker is often associated with the nominalizer q· pa (or its variant -w9,): q~·-pa'. This marker also operates as a connective, and depending on the context may be translated as \"and\", \"after\", \"because, since\". It generally introduces comparative clauses (rather like the ablative las). Ex.: ~,·fi)·lqc:::·c:J ''?OJ~' r.J~'Eiltl]'~c:::·lc:::· ~c:::·qa.,·tl]~tl]~·~·OJ~c:::·1 mT'-ki wangpo ny9,m'-pa' tha' ring-tang chungwa: S!:J' mJ. thong \"Because the sense of sight has been impaired, far -off and small shapes are not seen.\" c:J~OJ·~~'c\":\\l~·~·~c:::·~·~~·q~·~l·~~·~·~'\"-J'OJ~C:::'C:::Ol'tl]~C:::~1 176. Most case markers have the same spelling and pronunciation as certain nouns and verbs, a fact that beginners especially may find confusing. Here is a list of homonyms that that the reader would do well to be aware of: gyis: ergative-instrumental case or imperative of the classical verb \"to do\", Ia: oblique case and also \"mountain pass\", su: oblique case (L) and \"who?\", ru: oblique case (L) and \"brigade, section\", du: oblique case (L) and contracted form of du-ma \"many\" (L), las: ablative case and \"karma, action\", nas: ablative case (variant) and \"barley\", na: locative case (L) and conjunction \"if' and \"to be ill\". 177. When they are unstressed, these case markers are pronounced respectively: ki ', -ki, -Ia, -tu, -na, -nii', -Iii', -tang. Remember that when the case markers are unstressed, they carry no tone and are unaspirated. !'I"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"412 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN \"He went before the Bhagavana and (the latter) said (to him), 'Have you seen the divine realm?\"' Ol~~~.rz::Ja_' -fl'Cll' a;~~·crtll~''?'~Ol~~·r~Ol'!i<l~·~·~~ l1 \"Because of their desire for bait, fish are immediately killed.\" ~c::·~·~~·~~·~~·~~·~·~~·~·~Cll'CJ'tll~'CJ~·~~~·CJ~'Ol'~~~1 \"Because your body is a bag of pus, blood and lymph, don't become attached to it.\" ~t:l'Ol~ ~· ~c::·~~· t:l~~· ~c::· ~~· t:l~' Ol~~1 \"Whether you see her from behind or from in front, she is lovelier than anyone.\" m~· CJ't:l~· ~c::·-ryc::·~· ~~~· t:l~ Ol' CJ1 \"Rather than reading, (it would be better to) practice samadhi meditation.\" • The genitive The form of this case, too, varies according to the last letter of the preceding syllable: ~ (gi) khl., ~ (gyi) khyl., ~ (kyi) kyT, til (yi) yl., ~'i) (see Lesson 5.4). The case functions of this marker are the same in both registers. The genitive marks the complement of the noun, and forms relative and nominal clauses. In Literary Tibetan, however, the marker gi may also serve as a connective meaning \"but\", \"while\" or \"whereas\" when it comes directly after a verb. Ex.: Olf~'CJ' ~c::·~~·l~l· 4~·~1 l§~·q ':!]~~·t:Ja_·~~·~·AE]t:::'1 khapa ri!;ng-ki' ca' she'-ki lunpo thri!;kpa: c~'-su tri!;ng \"The wise know (the truth) by examining themselves, while fools follow rumour.\" ~~~·Cll·~~·t:J~·~~'t:J'tll1 ~·t:l·~~~'Cll'~~l'CJ'~l1 ~·t:l· 4~·~·~·~· 7'1 F'~l·~~·~·t:Jl'Ol'~Ol1 \"An action that is beneficial for one person may be harmful for another; when the moon rises the water lily opens, whereas the lotus closes.\" • The oblique Of the various cases, it is the oblique that exhibits the greatest differences across the two registers. It has more forms in Literary Tibetan, and the way in which it functions is more com-plex than in the spoken language. Traditionally referred to as fa-don \"meaning of la\"178, the 178. There are three major problems with the way in which the !a-don is traditionally presented in the Tibetan grammars: the three particles la, du and na are equivalent in the case of only one function (the locative without movement), but they differ in all other respects. Secondly, the grammatical analysis is based on the Sanskrit case models: accusative (las-su bya ba), dative (dgos ched) and locative (gnas gzhi). The gnas gzhi is subdivided into dngos po 'i bdag po stan pa, the possessive case, dngos po 'i gnas gzhi stan pa, the case of object location (the locative proper), tshe skabs la 'jug pa, the case of temporal location, and de nyid la 'jug pa, the case of object incorporation. And finally, of the seven forms, some are actually variants of the same particle (for example su, ru, du, tu), whereas others correspond to quite different particles (for example na and la). This Manual will not adopt the traditional pre-sentation, since it is too complex and is based on Sanskrit syntax, which is quite unrelated to that of Tibetan. Mention may be made of one highly unusual feature of the oblique case in Literary Tibetan: it may follow other cases,"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 413 oblique actually subsumes three distinct markers: the markers 1'.1' 19, (and its variant ~· -r), ~· th~ (and its variants~· r~, .2'tu, ~·sO) and finally ~·n9,; a total of seven forms that are used as follows: • after any ending (vowel or consonant): > l'.l'fa Ia • after any ending (vowel or consonant): > ~·na ne, > ~· r 179 r • after vowels and 1.\\ 'a: > ~·ru ru • after r:::: nga, l da, ~ na, 01 ma, ~ ra, 1'.1 Ia: > ~· du thu • after~ sa: > ~· su su • after~ sa t::l ba (and after the second suffix da): > .2'tu tO All these particles may function as the locative (without movement). Thus any word that ends in a consonant may be followed by one of three possible particles signifying the locative. Ex.: ~l·~· phg'-tu = ~l'l'.l' phg'-la = ~l·~· phg'-na = \"in Tibet\", ~13.1~·~· sem'-su = ~13.1~·~· sem'-na = ~01~'1'.1' sem'-la \"in the mind\", 4~'.2' = 4~·~· = 4~'1'.1' \"in the (monastic) cell\". When a word ends in a vowel, there is the additional possibility of using the marker r instead of Ia. Ex.: %5'~·~· = %5·~·~· = %5'~~·= %5'~'1'.1' \"in Lhasa\" ~Ol'Olfl.\\'~· = ~Ol'Olfl.\\'~·= ~Ol'OlF~= ~Ol'Olfl.\\'1'.1' \"in the sky\" However, each of the three markers has other specific functions that may be summarized briefly: The marker 19, (and its variant -r) take on the case functions of the locative (with or without movement) and dative. It also functions as adverbial suffix and marker of object incorporation. The latter serves to express the outcome or the effect of a transformation produced by the verbal action180• All these different meanings may be translated into English by \"to\", \"in\" or \"at\", or may remain untranslated as the examples below illustrate. Ex. of locative: ~·~~'1'.1'1.\\~' ky9,kar-la trg \"to go to India\" ~·~·~r::::'l'.l'~l' \"to live in Darjeeling\" notably the agentive and the ablative, in formulations such as: de-ba+s+na and nas+su. 179. In the case of a final 'a, the latter is replaced by the case marker r. 180. From a syntactic point of view, the case marker usually integrates or incorporates the object into the verb and thus creates a compound verb.

Ex.: ~,·~· 1~'-na \"in the hand\", ~·OlffiOl~·~· santsam'-na \"at the border\" And finally, apart from its meaning of \"if'181 (as in Spoken Tibetan), it may also mean \"when\".

The difference between the two is so subtle as to be nonexistent in certain cases. At an abstract level, -Ia' may be said to signify a consubstantial origin whereas na' implies that an object and its source are ontologically different. Another way of expressing the difference would be to say that for -na' the original space is closed or delimited, whereas for -Ia' the space is conceived as open and unbounded.182 Concretely, -Ia' is used in principle to denote the material that something is made of, or consubstantial provenance, or the source of a quotation, whereas -na' refers to spatial or temporal origin. 181. The marker na is almost always associated with the past form of the verb (when there is such a form) or the auxiliary. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule, especially in the case of negation. 182.

It also acts as an imperative marker (see 19.3). In Literary Tibetan, it is also used to introduce temporal clauses: \"as soon as, when\". Ex.: ~·~'4.:1\\,'z:::l'lr::::·~~·q1 \"They set off as soon as the sun rose.\" 183. S. Beyer (1992) has proposed that dang be treated as a case, but he provides no arguments for his analysis, which is not supported by Tibetan grammars. However, the suggestion is a good one, and a number of arguments may be cited in support. Dang cannot be preceded or followed by any other case markers. In other dialects, such as Ladakhi, dang marks the instrumental and the associative. In Central Tibetan, dang may be replaced by other cases such as the oblique or the absolutive. Like all the other case markers, the absolutive, the genitive, the agentive, the ablative and the oblique, the associative marker has two kinds of functions: case-related and connective. It should also be noted that in Amdo, the usual marker that corresponds to the Central Tibetan dang is Ia, which is also a case marker. This being said, there are two features that give the associative a special character: first, contrary to other case markers, dang usually goes before the main verb, with which it has a close relation; and secondly, there are relatively few verbs that can take this marker, so that the case function of dang is rather rare."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 417 3.4 The predicative function of adjectives In Spoken Tibetan, when adjectives take on a \"verbal\" (or predicative) function and appear at the end of the sentence, they must be followed by a copula or an auxiliary (except in certain comparative constructions, see Lesson 17.3). In Literary Tibetan, however, adjectives that func-tion as predicates are often treated autonomously, with neither copula nor auxiliary. Ex.: J.\\~'4~'.5j'Ol~~1\"fishTntu ts~· \"This is really lovely!\" l~·~~·~~·ffi~·r.:t._~·~z:::rl'1'\"'1 th~ncor rlncen 1i thop ka \"This precious human body is hard to get.\" tfi'~· ry~· ~r:::·~Ol~·r:::· ~~· ffi1 \"Those with few qualities are full of pride.\" ,~l·~~·~~·~~·~q·l:_l~'gj1 \"Anyone can easily take revenge.\" 3.5 Nominal sentences and the concluding particle. In Literary Tibetan we sometimes find nominal sentences, that is, sentences with no verb (and no adjective with a verb function). These sentences usually end in a noun, but they may also end in some formulation other than a verb (such as a pronoun or an adverb). In most cases, these nominal sentences end in the concluding particle 'o or one of its variants (see Table 9 in Ap-pendix 6). Ex.: aJ'Ol'~Ol~·~~·~11ama-nam-kyi'-so \"(It was) by the lamas.\" ~·~·~Ol~·q~r.(1 kyo kyo sempa kyo: \"Sad, sad, my heart (is so) sad.\" r.:t._~·~·~,·q~~·~1\"fi-ni t!:J'nga:-lo \"This (is) suffering.\" 3. 6 Verb inflection In Literary Tibetan, verb stems are often inflected according to the three tenses and the imperative mood: a maximum offour forms. These are traditionally referred to as ~~·l·~·q· dus da-lta-ba \"present\", ~~·Ol·r.(r:::~·l:_l'dus rna-'ongs-pa \"future\", ~~·r:t._l~·qdus 'das-pa \"past\" and~~· ,$,· skul-tshig \"imperative\". In Literary Tibetan, not all verbs have four forms; some are either invariable or have only two or three forms. This Manual has retained the traditional terminology for the three tenses: past, present and future. However it is more accurate to speak of aspects (or tense-aspect). The present \"tense\" is an imperfective aspect, since it may in fact be used not only in the present but also in the im-perfective past. For example, in the following sentence: ,~r:::·l,r.:t._·~·~q·~r:::·~r:::·qgjq~·l:_l·~·~·~q1\"Though Nanda became a monk, he wouldn't learn the precepts.\" [literally: he does not learn the precepts] Although the verb stem ~q is in the \"present\" (and not the past l::lgjl::l~'), it conveys the meaning of the imperfective past. Note also the use of the imperfective negation~· (and not the \"past\" Ol')."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"418 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN The traditional designation \"past\" is technically speaking as inappropriate as \"present\". What we are actually dealing with is the perfective aspect: this \"past\" tense is in fact also used for the perfective future. For example in the sentence: t!]~r:::·lti]i.\\' ~ ·~·~~·~·~~·~~·r::J~·c:r~ r:::~·IJ1l,·~~·=ll'I:.J'lr:::·i.\\~'\"\\·~·r::J·Ul~1 \"N anda will be born in paradise and will enjoy happiness, [then] when his merit runs out, he will be reborn here.\" [literally: once he has been born in the divine realms and has enjoyed happiness] In the first clause, the verb ~~ is in the \"past\" (and not the future ~· ) but it denotes a per-fective foture. It should be remembered that the number of distinct verb sterns has been considerably re-duced in the spoken language, and the role of inflection has been largely supplanted by auxiliary verbs. Furthermore, the majority of verbs in the spoken language consist of an invariable noun and a verbalizer. There are two main reasons for the reduction in the number of inflections in Spoken Tibetan: a) Certain forms have either become outmoded or completely obsolete. b) There is a high degree of homophony. In the course of the phonological evolution of Central Tibetan, many verbs with different prefixes (or suffixes, etc.) have come to be pronounced identically. The distinctions that have been retained in writing have disappeared in the spoken language. The table below provides several examples of comparisons between written and colloquial forms. The first line (in italics) below the Tibetan presents the spelling (and therefore the archaic pronunciation), while the second shows the Standard Tibetan pronunciation. There are also some examples (in brackets) of the literary pronunciation, but these have generally lost their currency in the spoken language. present-future past imperative ~'\"\\'/r::l~'\"\\ r::J~.-:;· ~.-:;· skor I bskor bskor skor \"to turn\" kor kor kor tljryr:::·; tljryr:::· r::Jryr:::· ~r:::~· gtong /gtang btang thongs \"to send\" (tong)/ tang tang (thong) tang i.\\~t!j'/ ltljtlj' r::liljtlj' ftlj' 'gog/dgag bkag khog \"to stop\" (kg'/k~') ka' ka' (kho') ka' i.\\~.-:;· 4-\"'' 'char shor 0 \"to escape\" (chor)shor shor"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 419 ~·jq~· q~~· q~~· zo I bzo bzos bzos \"to make\" so so' so' ~~:;~· ~~ ~~ byedlbya by as byos \"to do\" ch~ 'I ( ch9:) cha' (chg') ch~' ~~·jq~~· q~q· ~q· rgyag I brgyag brgyab rgyob \"to construct\" ky9;' ky9;p kyop/ ky9;p ~·jq~· q~~· ~~· lta I blta bltas ltos \"to look\" ta ta' to' s:j r:::J=:JI.\\' r:::J;::J~' ~· za I bza' bzas zo \"to eat\" sa sa' so ~~·; lE3~' [j~' [j~' 'bul I dbul phul phul \"to offer\" (h) (pQ:/ u:)phu: phu: phu: The disappearance of certain verb forms in the oral register and the fact that there are so many homophones present certain problems when writing in a converstional or vernacular -rather than a literary - style. The tense of a given form may be radically different in oral and Literary Tibetan. Verb stems corresponding to the literary past tense are used for the present-future in the oral register (since this is the only form that is used in speech, e.g., bkag \"to stop\"). Correspondence between literary and oral forms is a complex matter. In the case of modem texts of this kind, readers should take care to identify the tense of the verb from the auxiliaries and not from the inflection of the main verb. On the other hand, Literary Tibetan contains a large number of \"causative/resultative\" verb pairs. Compared to the basic resultative stem, the causative has always an additional argument corresponding to an intentional agent performing the action. All the causative verbs are transitive and volitional, while resultative verbs are usually intransitive and non-volitional. When occuring in the same sentence, the causative form points to the effort of the agent, whereas the resultative form essentially shows the result ofthe action (see Lesson 35.3). In written Tibetan, the causative verb often carries a superscript s. In the spoken language, causatives are often distinguishable from their resultative form by tone and aspiration, but in many cases this opposition, too, has dis-appeared."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"420 Ex.: causative ~'\\' bskor /kor/ t::l<itlj' beag /ca'/ t::l~tlj~' bsgrigs /trl'/ z::::]~(l.l' ~ bsgul /kQ:/ MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN \"to turn\" \"to break\" \"to arrange\" resultative ~'\\' 'khor /khor/ ffitlj' chag /cha'/ ~§Jtlj' 'grig /trl'/ \"to cause to move\" ~~!l.l' 'gul /kQ:/ 3. 7 Forms and functions of copulas and auxiliaries \"to circulate\" \"to be broken\" \"to be arranged, be enough\" \"to move, be moved\" In the literary register, copulas are not indispensable (as they are in Spoken Tibetan), but they do occur quite frequently. For the verb \"to be\" we find the forms: til~· yln, !l.ltlj~'l9;', and ~l r~' (especially in Modem Literary Tibetan), and for the verbs \"to have\" or \"to exist\" we find ~~tlj' t~', U1~; yg', tljl~'t9;, ~t::::· nang, 3.1~~· chT', and U1l·q·~l· ygpare' (especially in Modem Literary Tibetan). The copulas til~· yln and U1l· yg', which are also used in Spoken Tibetan, are not restricted to the first person (they are not egophoric). Ex.: tlj~3.l·~·~q·tlj~~·~·~tlj·til~1 sum-kyi t9;p nyT' thr~· yln \"Two threes are six.\" ~3.1'3.1f'\\'~·~r~'\\'tlj~3.l·U1l1 n9;mkar nyl t9; kar sum yg' \"In the sky there are three [celestial bodies], the sun, the moon and the stars.\" Final auxiliary verbs184 represent another area in which there are major differences between the two registers. It should be noted that final auxiliaries are not essential in Literary Tibetan, whereas they are in the spoken language. In the latter (as we have seen above), the auxiliaries pro-vide supplementary information about tense, aspect and mood, but in Literary Tibetan they are also combined with inflection of the main verb. While verbs may figure as autonomous entities in Classical Tibetan, auxiliaries are some-times used - even in the most ancient texts, such as the Dunhuang manuscripts. Some auxiliaries are in fact composed of a suffix followed by the auxiliary verb proper, whereas others are directly attached to the verb. Suffixes include mainly the following particles and nominalizers: q· pa, t.l'\\,' par, ,. khl, ,~. khln, t::l~~· shln, ~t::::· shJ.ng (and its two variants ~t::::· dng, 4t::::' shTng), ~· ky~, 3.lf~· khan. All auxiliary verbs may also operate autonomously. Here is a list of the main auxiliaries, with the meanings they have as autonomous verbs: Sl' ch~' \"to do\", 3.1E(l' ts~' \"to do\"(H), t::l~l kyl' \"to do\"(H), ~~'\\' ky~r \"to change\",~t::::· song \"to go\", ~t::::· ch~ng \"to happen\", t::l~l· t~' \"to stay\", U1l· yg' \"to exist, to have\", ~~tlj' t~' \"to be [seated], to have\", tljl~'t9; \"to exist\", ~t::::· nang \"to appear\", til~· yln \"to be\", !l.ltlj~' l9;' \"to be\", ~~· sln \"to finish\". 184. These auxiliaries appear only at the end of main clauses, and never after the verbs of subsidiary clauses."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 421 The choice of auxiliary depends on the historical period of the literature in question, and varies also from one region and author to another, but they are of basically two kinds: those that are used in classical literature, and appear frequently in canonical texts translated from Sanskrit, and those that appear particularly in certain namthar (hagiographies). However, the two styles often occur together within a text. • Classical style: tense causative auxiliaries resultative auxiliaries past V (past)+ c_,;z;;·s~· -parch~' V (past)+ c_,;z;;·~;x;;·-par ky!:,!r present v (pres.)+ c_,;z;;·s~: -parch~' V (pres.)+ c_,;z;;·~;x;;· -par ky!:,!r (imperfective) future V (pres./ fut.) + c_,;z;;·s· -parch~ V (pres./ fut.) + c_,;z;;·~;x;;· -par ky!:,!r These auxiliaries, which occur frequently in Classical Tibetan, mark the tense and aspect of the verb; this feature is particularly useful in cases where the verb is invariable. They also specify whether we are dealing with a causative or resultative act (or process). The causative auxiliaries generally emphasize the agent's effort to perform an action (with-out anticipating the result). They may be used either with volitional (or \"controllable\") or non-volitional (\"non-controllable\") verbs. • When they are associated with volitional verbs, causative auxiliaries indicate that the action is intentionally performed by the agent, and emphasize the process or, when they are com-bined with the future tense, the volition or obligation of the agent. Ex.: ~~·q~·~~·~~·~~·q;z;;'Sl1 \"The king rules with compassion.\" ~,·c_,·~~·q;z;;'S1 \"One should make an effort to desist from sinful acts.\" '?·q~·=:~~·~~·r·sl·~~·'?·~3.l~.,~l·c_,;z;;·sl1 \"The fisherman kills fish by attracting them with bait.\" • In association with non-volitional verbs, auxiliaries acquire a factitive or causative mean-ing. The agent is then the cause of, or the party responsible for, the transformation that something or someone undergoes. It may accordingly be translated by \"to see to it that\" or \"to make sure that\". Ex.: s~·q·~·ijq·,~·E)q~·c_,;z;;'Sl'l,-~1 \"One ought to see to it that children receive an education.\" ;x;;~·~·~~·s~·~·~~·~~·§i~·q-4~·c_,;z;;·s~·~~·q~l·q~~·q~t:~il,-~1 \"We should make sure that we are aware of the negative karma of past deeds and endure (their consequences).\""},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"422 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Resultative auxiliaries generally emphasize the result of the action. They are usually used in connection with non-volitional verbs, but may also figure with volitional verbs. • In association with non-volitional verbs, the resultative auxiliary confirms that the action or process is unintentional. Resultative auxiliaries are also useful to indicate the tense of the verb when it is invariable. Ex.: ~·~~·~ll.l·t:ra_·?4·sc:::·o.J~c:::·c:J~·~~1 Ooll::!~·~as·c:J~·~~·~1 ~·t:la_·~·ll.l·~l·q~·GJ Ool·~·~~{·t:l·~·t:l~·~~1 \"I saw the king's palace from there.\" \"[We ]'ll die in the end.\" \"A mother is especially saddened for a sick son.\" • When they are associated with volitional verbs, they specify that only the object or the result of the action, independent of the agent's volition, are to be taken into account (the agent may be absent). In European languages, these formulations are often translated by the passive.185 Ex.: o.Jffilq~·~~·t:la_·~~·q·3:Jl1 \"It's not certain that offerings will be made.\" t:l~~~·qa_·~ ~·~·~c:::·~·'ff~'~Ool·~~·~~~·~~·~ l·q~·~~1 \"The wealth we have accumulated will one day be enjoyed by others, like honey.\" • The namthar style and Modem Literary Tibetan both use auxiliaries that are formally identical to those of the spoken language, but they function differently from their oral homo-logues. Namthar style tense auxiliaries past V (past)+ ~c:::·song (distancing), V (past)+ ~c:::·ch!:,!ng (nearing) V (past)+ 1:.1'~~· -pa yln, V (past)+ all· yg', V (past)+ ~~~·t!:!'

It should, however, be pointed out that, unlike their homologues in the 185. In canonical literature, these auxiliaries translate the Sanskrit passive voice."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Appendix 1 423 spoken language, these auxiliaries do not convey evidential moods186 (or \"mediatory\" moods): they provide only information relating to tense and aspect. Even in Modem Literary Tibetan, with the exception of writings that reproduce the spoken language, the distinction between the first per-son ( egophoric) and the others is generally not relevant, nor is that between intentional and unin-tentional, as the following sentence shows: Ex.: lc:::~·,~~·~a.J~·~·3l·~c:::·,<ic:::·a.J·~1 ~~·ql,·~~·c:ra._·r·~c:::~·?4,·z:.r~~1 th§;ngsa: sem'-kyi m~long tsangma-la chTta' ky~:po khalang pho'-pa yin \"The pure mirror of the clear mind is touched by the breath of the Lord of the Dead.\" In this example, the auxiliary payin is used with a non-volitional verb phok \"to be touched\" in the third person. In Spoken Tibetan, this auxiliary is always used in association with the first person of a volitional verb. Finally, it should be noted that there is a difference with regard to negation. In Literary Tibetan, the use of the particles of negation m9, and ml depends on tense-aspect and mood: ml is used with the present (or the imperfective past, which is similar to the present), whereas m9, is used with the past (perfective) and the imperative (the negative form of the imperative is similar to the present). The rule may be summarized as follows: > present or future a.l'ma > past or imperative trg m9: thup \"(He) could not go.\" trg ml thup \"(He) can not go.\" ~~'t:.l'lc:::·a:l'·a.l'~a.l~'~~·~~f'3:l'~~·q~·~c:::·q~~·~c:::·z:l~1 manpa-tang mgma-nam '-kyi' kyang ml tsho-war l!:Jng tan-shing phgr \"The physicians and the diviners prophesied that he would not survive, and abandoned him.\" Here the use of the negation ml reveals that we are dealing with the future (from the point of view of the past). This rule doesn't apply in the spoken language, since a.l' m9: and 3:1· ml don't depend on tense but on the type of auxiliary that is used (cf. ~~, t!:J' > 3:1·~~, mlntu' and D:ll'~l· yg:re' > D:i'l'a.l'~l· yg:mare'). 186. It should be remembered that the originality of the system of final auxiliary verbs in Spoken Tibetan lies not only in the indications of tense and aspect that they provide, but also in various \"mediatory\" moods (see Lesson 5.4) that specify the source of information used by the speaker to characterize a statement: egophoric, assertive, testimonial and inferential."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"424 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN 3. 8 Reported speech In the classical language and in modem literary texts, reported speech is usually marked by the syllable~~· sh~' at the end of a quotation, or by its variant form ~~·ce' (the variant 4~'she' is archaic ).187 It functions like its oral homologue ~· -s and comes immediately before the verb of speech. Although this marker is usually used for direct speech, it may also be used to introduce reported speech. There is no structural (or syntactic) difference between the two types of speech.

In either case, relative clauses are formed with the use of nominalizers, but the markers for nominal-izing verbs have different forms and functions (for oral Tibetan, see Lesson 26). The universal marker of nominalization in Tibetan is z:r pa I 1::1 W§;. However, the following markers are also found: 5~· ch~', ~: ch9;, ~· ky!:!, ~Ill' yQI, ~·sa, 0-!f~' khan, &l·ml. Apart from these common nominalizers, there are also markers that convey a complete meaning: ~Ill' so: \"custom, usage\",~~~· tang' \"way, manner\",~~· thr6 \"sequel, continuation\" and?.(·~,. gcok, ~~1' k!:!, ffi\\ tsha' which mean \"all, altogether\".189 The markers '5~' can and 'e\\~' t~n are also used to form relative clauses, but they differ from the others insofar as they function, by themselves, as nomi-nalized possessive verbs. As in the case of their oral homologues, all the nominalizers with the exception of -pa depend on the function of the head noun (antecedent) and, in certain cases, on the tense of the relative clause. Relative clauses usually go before the head noun, but occasionally appear after. In the former case, they are usually (though not always) linked to the noun that they modify by means of a genitive. Finally, in Classical Tibetan, we sometimes find (associated with the nomi-189.

It is much more widely used in Literary than in Spoken Tibetan. The function of the head noun must be determined by default.

At the end of a word, k almost always takes the form of a glottal stop."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Appendix 2 431 The relatively small number of final consonants relative to initial consonants is a common feature of the languages of this region. We may also note that, in Standard Spoken Tibetan, consonant clusters such as spr, skr, sk, It, bsk, etc. do not occur, contrary to the case of Old Tibetan. However, these clusters are pre-served in modem spelling. The description of sounds in polysyllabic words needs to be further refined by taking into consideration not only the initial consonants (Ci) and final consonants (Cf) of the word, but also the final consonant of the first syllable and the first consonant of the second syllable. Table 1.2 Consonant distribution within a word Initial consonant Final consonant Initial consonant Final consonant of word of interior sy Hable of interior syllable of word k, kh, c, ch, k, p, m, n, ng,(r), (1) k, ky, c, t, tr, ts, p, m, k, ', p, m, n, ng, ky, khy, t, th n, ng, ny, r, 1, sh, s, y, (r), ( 1) tr, thr, p, ph w m, n, ng, ny, r, 1, s, sh, y, w It will be seen from this table that the distribution of consonants isn't the same in the four positions. The main difference is that whereas there are no aspirated consonants at the beginning ofthe internal syllable(s) of a word, they do occur at the beginning ofthe word itself. However, in order to explain the significant phonetic variations that are found in Tibetan, we also need to exa-mine the intrasyllabic positions, i.e., the beginning and end of the internal syllable (see below for the various pronunciations of the phoneme k). Table 1.3 The vowels Front Central Back unrounded rounded Close (or high) i u [y] u Half-close e 0 [0] 0 Half-open a[£] Open (or low) a There are eight vowel phonemes: /a, a, e, o, 6, u, u, i/."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"432 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN In addition to the five alphabetical vowels, there are three others /a, 6, 0/ (umlaut) that are produced by the addition, in the written language, of the consonants l, s, d and n192 which are themselves no longer pronounced. The three new vowels are a result of the evolution of the 193 system. One of the problems with Tibetan phonology is the number of variants for each sound according to the context. To produce the right sound it is therefore important to know if it occurs at the beginning, the interior or the end of a word. In addition to the transcription used in this book, presented between oblique strokes, the pronunciation will also be given, in square brackets, in International Phonetic Alphabet (IP A). One of the phonological features of Standard Tibetan is the absence of a clear opposition between voiced and voiceless consonants. In a high tone, all consonants are voiceless, whereas in a low tone we find slightly aspirated voiced consonants as well as partial or complete voicing. Sounds that are midway between being voiced and voiceless are rare in European languages, and therefore require special attention. '~''h . . .r 194 .1., e pronunc~atwn oJ consonants Certain phonemes are pronounced differently according to context. Phonetic variations depend not only on preceding and following consonants, but also on vowels. The variants and the different contexts in which they occur need not be memorized, since the differences in pronun-ciation are minimal, and not distinctive. Moreover, they are most easily learned by progressive usage.195 We do, however, recommend that you make use of the CD, where all the following 196 examples are recorded. 192. That is, the coronals. Then and the l are still partially pronounced. 193. Phonetically, there are actually twelve oral (i.e., non-nasal) vowels with their respective nasal forms, but only the phonemes of the eight vowels listed above play a distinctive role. The vowels are dependent on the context in which they appear, and may not be used in creating oppositions. 194. The order in which these will be presented is as follows: -Plosives (unaspirated and aspirated): velars, palatals, retroflexes, dentals and labials. -Affricates (unaspirated and aspirated): palatals, dentals. -Palatal fricatives, retroflexes and dentals. -Laterals (unaspirated and aspirated). -Glides y and w. 195. Ignoring the variants may result in a slight accent, but doesn't impair communication. For example, the phoneme k (see below) may be pronounced (k] wherever it may appear within a word as long as tonal differences are observed. 196. In the recording, the examples often reflect a reading pronunciation.

In a case of a more literary pronunciation, the l reappears. In this book the posi-tion is marked with a lengthening [:] rather than an /1/ to remind beginners not to pronounce a true l.

The labial consonant [m] appears before the labial consonant [p ], the velar nasal ng [IJ] appears before the velar consonant /k/, and the nasal palatal ny [fi] appears before the palatal consonant /ky/. These fluctuations between nasals are similar to the negative prefix which is pro-nounced in before t and im before p (as in \"interminable\", \"impossible\", etc.). Contrary to the case of Tibetan, however, this difference is now represented in spelling. Ex.: f~'!:.l'jtonpa/ \"teacher, guide\" is often pronounced: tampa, ~~·r:l·~·/rlnpo che/: rlmpo che \"precious one, term of address for high-ranking incarnate lamas\", ~~·z:.r~l'/chTn-pare'/: chTm-pare'201 \"(he) went\" ~~·~· /pTnkya'/: pTnkya' \"sibling, relative\", l~~'F'/kQnka/: kQngka \"winter\" -[-] corresponds to a nasalization of the preceding vowel, and appears only with an n at the end of a word, although this often remains barely audible.

The pronunciation of the phoneme n as [m] before a labial is very common, and may be illustrated by the following anecdote: /k6npa/ is almost always pronounced [gompa], to the extent that certain Tibetans who are not particularly adept at spelling tend to write it as sgompa (sgom means \"meditation\"). The popular variant [gompa] is now so widely used that the word has come to acquire two pronunciations, a more \"correct\" /kgnpa/ and a vernacular /kgmpa/ (with a loss of the umlaut on the 6 ). This phenomenon also applies to nasals in the case of conjugated verbs. For example, /chin-pare'/ is often pronounced chimpare' . In this case, too, the dental nasal reappears in more \"refined\" speech."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Appendix 2 443 -The velar nasal [ IJ] corresponding to the sound ng in \"king\", appears at the beginning of a word or of an internal syllable, or at the end of a word or syllable /ng/.

The pronunciation of vowels The 8 Tibetan vowels /a, e, a, o, 6, u, u, i/ do not pose any special problems for speakers of French or German. For English speakers, however, the oppositions /e, a/, /o, 6/, /u, u/ require careful attention . The only rather surprising feature is the variability of certain vowels depending on the context in which they appear. The nasal consonants /n, ng/ produce nasal vowels, but these are not distinctive. Thus Tibetan is ill-equipped to distinguish between pairs such as the French \"main\" and \"mime\". • /a/ is pronounced as an open central vowel [a] and sometimes as a schwa [ ;;1]. -[a] usually appears in all positions except atonal suffixes: Ex.: F'/kha/ \"mouth\", aJ'Ol'flama/ \"lama, guru\", W.'Ol'fama/ \"mother\", ~Ol't:.l'ftsampa/ \"milled roasted barley\" In an atonal position or as a closed syllable (before p ), /a/ is pronounced [A) or [ ;;1).

As a gene-ral rule, consonants are very clearly pronounced at the beginning of a word, but less so in other positions, especially at the end. Thus /k/ is pronounced [k] at the beginning of a syllable, but in a final internal position within a word it is often weakened to [ y ], similar to the French pronunciation of r, and at the very end of a word it may even disappear altogether or be transformed into a simple glottal stop [?]. The same observations apply to /p/, which is pronounced [p] at the beginning of a word but often as [_13] between vowels, and sometimes may become a glottal stop[?] at the end of a word. Finally, the phonemes /1/ are /r/ pronounced respectively [I] and [r] at the beginning of a syllable, whereas at the end they are transformed into a lengthening[:] of the vowel. Remarks on stress Stress is not particularly marked in Tibetan (see Introduction). It should be noted, however, that in the case of a certain number of words comprising suffixes, nouns and verbs may be distin-guished by stress (and tone). Thus in the following examples, each of the two syllables carries equal stress, whereas in the case of the verb - whether in the infinitive or the past participle - the accent falls on the first syllable while the second syllable pa is an unstressed suffix. This feature is analogous to the distinction between nominal and verbal forms of homonyms that is made in English: contract (verb), contract (noun); record (verb), record (noun); conflict (verb), conflict (noun). ~~·z:.r/tsTpa/ \"astrologer, accountant\" t::l~O-J·z:.r: /sampa/ \"thought\" ~~·z:.r lrlkpa/ \"knowledge\" £Jt::l'z:.:I' /lappa/ \"teaching\" l~l·z:.r /kopa/ \"arrangement, disposition\" a;l·q· /chapa/ \"punishment\" ~~·z:.r /tokpa/ \"awareness, realization\" ~~·z:.r /clnpa/ \"offering\" ~~·q· /kyukpa/ \"vomit\" CD II • Tr. 19 ~~·z:.r /tsT' -pa/ \"to count\" z:::J~O-J~'z:.:I' /sam' -pa/ \"to think\" ~~·z:.r lrl'-pa/ \"to see, know\" £Jt::l'z:.r /lap-pa/ \"to teach, learn\" l~l·z:.r /ko'-pa/ \"to arrange, dispose\" a;l·q· /cha'-pa/ \"to punish\" ~~·z:.r /t6'-pa/ \"to understand, realize\" ~~·z:.r /cln-pa/ \"to offer\" ~~·q· /kyu'-pa/ \"to vomit\""},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Appendix 3 The Honorific Register As in other Asian languages such as Japanese and Korean, Tibetan has developed an ho-norific register that make it possible to express social relations through linguistic usage. The honorific should be understood as a sophisticated form of politeness expressed through personal pronouns, names, verbs, auxiliaries and even adjectives and adverbs. The honorific register, called ~·~·sh~sa:, is used for people of superior and equal social standing, and even between friends and married couples. The ordinary register, ';;j~:l~~·0-1· ka kyuma, is used for all others, that is, those younger than oneself (although the honorific is sometimes used with certain juniors) and social inferiors. Students of Tibetan should certainly learn both registers, but if you were to learn only one, the ordinary register would be better for two reasons: some people without much education hardly use the honorific register; and secondly, even if you use honorifics to another person you should always use ordinary terms (in the absence ofhumilifics) for yourself. And finally the good news: quite a number of words have only one form. Most nouns, adjectives and adverbs have only one type of honorific. noun ordinary honorific tea ~· cha ~~\"'l·~·so:ca water ~· chu a;z:::r chap book ~z:::r thep ~Z1r~z:::r cha'tep For verbs, however, as well as for pronouns, there are several types of honorific. -~::1\\.'z::::Jryc:::·~·~·drtang sh~sa the \"general honorific\" (H), -~·~·0-l~·r:l·sh~sa thopo the \"high honorific\" (HH), -lo.l~'~'z:::J€§,t::::z:::J~.'~'~' masa S!:,!ngwa: sh~sa the \"humilific\" (h), -~~~·~~~·~·~·~· cho' nyT'-ki sh~sa the \"double honorific\" (hH)."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Appendix3 447 The general and high honorifics correspond to forms of politeness that indicate a respectful attitude towards the subject of an action. The high honorific conveys an even more polite and reverential attitude than the general honorific, and is used especially in the case of high lamas and State dignitaries. The humilific202 is systematically used for the first person as the subject, but more generally to indicate a respectful attitude on the part of the speaker towards the person to whom that action is directed (which, from a syntactic perspective, may comprise various comple-ments: object, indirect object, etc.). It should be emphasized that the honorific is never used with reference to oneself, and for the first person the humilific is consequently needed. Finally, the double honorific denotes that both the subject of the action and the person to whom it is directed are considered by the speaker to merit equal respect. Note that there are only a few high and double honorifics, and they are not often used.

The use of honorific registers may entail true linguistic virtuosity, to the extent that not only pronouns, but also adjectives, adverbs, verbs and auxiliaries should be in honorific form, while the speaker should also diminish himself or herself by using the appropriate humilifics."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"448 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN ifics\" (zhe-sa rkang-chag), to signify the fact that some terms in a sentence are honorific whereas others belong to the ordinary level. The misuse of honorifics is a common source of amusement for Tibetans. The basis for a mastery of the honorific language is a sound knowledge of the pronouns and a few of the main nouns, verbs (especially the main verbs of movement, speech and action) and auxiliaries. The sh~sa vocabulary will gradually increase with usage. The honorific language is especially used in Standard Tibetan and the dialects of Central Tibet and Tsang, as well as certain outlying regions such as Mustang, in Nepal. It is also very important in Tibetan literature, where it may even play a grammatical role since it can substitute for the subject and other markers of person by establishing the relationship between characters, and hence identify them. Contrary to a widespread belief, the honorific is not altogether absent in the dialects of Kham and Amdo, even though it is much less frequently used than in Central Tibet. Most honorifics are derivatives of ordinary terms, and relatively few are original. For the most part, nouns are formed by the use of honorific prefixes. There are perhaps just a dozen or so such prefixes, corresponding to honorific terms for body parts: ~· ku \"body\", ~,. cha' \"hand\",~~· iJ \"head\", ~o;· can \"eyes\", ~~· sh~: \"mouth\", ~q~· sh~p \"leg\", ~,~. c~· \"tongue\", &,~. thu' \"mind\", r::::l~!:\\' ka \"speech\", as well as a few prefixes derived from verbs: ,~~·so: \"to pray\", r::::l~~· sh~' \"to take\", ,~0-1' slm \"to sleep\", etc. Each prefix is associated with a very wide semantic field related to its original meaning. Thus the prefix ku often appears in words denoting not only body parts but also physical acti-vities, bodily representations, kinship ties, clothing, belongings, social ranks, certain illnesses and so on. For example: ~·f-l,. kutra' \"blood\",~·~~· kut6' \"shirt\", ~·a;~·kudi' \"possessions\", ~·q~o;· kunyan \"statue\", ~·0-1~o;· kuntron \"guest\", etc. Verbs fall into two categories: -a) verbs consisting of a noun and a verbalizer (these constitute the majority). -b) simple verbs. In the first case, the honorific is obtained by putting the noun that precedes the verb in the honorific (according to the principle outlined above) and then replacing the verbalizer by its ho-norific (or humilific) homologue. Here are some verbs with common honorific verbalizers: ,o;t::::· nang honorific for s~· ch~' \"to do\" (verbalizer) and ~~'tra' \"to give\" r::::l~o;·kyon honorific for r::::l~r::::l'ky~p \"to do, to make\" (verbalizer) z::::Jryt::::·,o;t::::·tang nang honorific for qryc;:·tang \"to send\" (verbalizer) r::::l~~·sh~' honorific for ~o;·1~n to take, =:l's~ \"to eat\", 1:\\&t::::'thung \"to drink\" ~~·shQ' humilific for =:l's~ \"to eat\", 1:\\&t::::'thung \"to drink\",~o;·1~n \"to take\", r::::l4~'sha' \"to say\""},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Appendix 3 449 E1~· phu: humilific for ~l'td3:' \"to give\" t:l,C:::~'sh§:ng' honorific for ~c:::~·l9;ng' \"to rise\" (verbalizer) Ex.: ~~·,·~l·l~ka ch~' \"to work\" > ~ZlT~~·~~c:::·cha'la' nang(H) e;:·a._&C:::'ch§: thiJng \"to drink tea\" > ~~~·e;:·0-1~~so:ca cho' (H) or ~~~·e;:·~~·so:ca shQ' (h) 3l·t:Jryc:::· m~ tang \"to set fire\" > ~~~·3l·t:Jryc:::·~~c:::· sh~kme tang nang (H) lz:..J~'t:l$t:l' par ky9;p \"to photograph\"> ~fll:..l~'t:l~~· kiJpar kyon In the case of certain simple verbs, the honorific entails a different lexical root.

He always receives the choicest food, served with deferential gestures in a quiet voice, and so on."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Appendix 4 Loans from Other Languages For a long period of their history (from the 8th to the 13th centuries) the Tibetans were assi-duously engaged in translation, mainly from Sanskrit, with the primary aim of acquiring and spreading Buddhist teachings. The skill and precision of the Tibetan translators, or lotsawa, were such that Tibetan texts may reliably be used to retranslate into Sanskrit works that were lost at the time of the Muslim invasions of India. For several years now, a team of translators in Varanasi (Benares) has been working on the reproduction of Sanskrit works from Tibetan versions. Over the course of time, Tibetan, like any other language, has enriched its vocabulary through lexical borrowings. The main sources have been Sanskrit, Mongolian, Uighur and An-cient Chinese, with more recent recourse to English, Hindi and Modem Chinese (putonghua).204 It is likely that other languages such as Zhangzhung (part of which later became the kingdom of Guge), Tangut (mi-nyag) and other Himalayan languages such as Kinnauri also contributed to Tibetan vocabulary. Whatever the case, it is a striking fact that Tibetan actually contains very few pure loans (also called \"transfers\"),205 and has tended to prefer calques (loan translations). This process con-sists of coining neologisms using Tibetan roots conveying the semantic content of compound 204. For further details see Beyer (1992:138 -145) 205. Here is Beyer's definition of \"transfer\" (1992: 139): \"One type of borrowing is the process we will call transfer, whereby a foreign word or phrase is simply incorporated wholesale into the lexicon, with more or less adaptation to native phonology and orthography.\" Transfers are rare in Tibetan, except in technical domains such as medicine, which contain a relatively larger proportion of Sanskrit and Chinese words."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Appendix 4 451 words from other languages, such as Sanskrit, Chinese and so on. The vocabulary that has been borrowed extends almost exclusively to nouns, and includes almost no verbs or adjectives. Unlike the majority of other literary Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Burmese, etc.), Tibetan has calqued or translated, rather than borrowed, the essential vocabulary of Bud-dhism. Ex.: Buddha = ~c::::~·~~· sangkya'; bodhisattva= ~c::::·~z::r~OJ~'C\\,z:.Ja.,· ch~ngcup sempa; karma = ~~· Ia', etc. Even the names of Hindu divinities have been \"translated\": Ex.: \"Indra\" = q~·~~·ky~cin; \"Brahma\" = ai'c::::~·q· tshangpa; \"Siva\"= lqc::::·~~· wangcu', etc. The Tibetan lotsawa sometimes preferred to calque glosses or definitions of certain words, rather than the words themselves (see below).

Dictionaries of university-level mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as a large number of popular works have also been published. Unfortunately, since these books are not very widely distributed, the majority of Tibetans use loanwords (from Chinese or English) ac-cording to where they live. In the case of certain neologisms, it may happen that there are three different terms for the same object: one Literary Tibetan term and two in the spoken language. Of the latter, one is likely to be a Chinese loanword used in the T .A.R. or the Tibetan-speaking Chinese provinces, and the other an English loan used in the diaspora.

This phenomenon has increased in the past two decades. There is also a tendency to switch from Tibetan to Chinese, back and forth within the same conversation.

The following pages will set out the main rules for the construction of words that are valuable for both the spoken and the written languages. 1. Nominal compounds There are a number of processes relating to the formation of compound nouns, and these apply also to adjectives and verbs. There are basically four types of formation: synonym com-pounds, polar compounds, compounds with a determinant, and cumulative or sequential com-212 pounds. 1. 1 Synonym compounds • Compounds made up of two synonymous nouns: ~~·z;,;qz:;r dus-skabs \"period\" (time-moment), ~,~·~il.l' lugs-srol \"tradition\" (tradition-custom),~·~~~ re-'dun \"hope\" (hope-wish), ~·,~~· glu-gzhas \"song\" (song-song). • Compounds consisting of two synonymous verbs: ~~~·q~r::::· 'dzin-bzung \"capture\" (seize - hold), 0-l~il.l';::).l' mjal-phrad \"encounter\" (meet (H) - meet), ,~r::::·q4l' gsung-bshad \"speech, discourse\" (say (H) - say), ~~il.l' ~~· 'phel-rgyas \"development\" (increase - spread), Clllj,.~~,. bkag-'gog \"obstruction\" (stop [past] -stop [present]), ~~,·~~· 'dzug-skrun \"construction\" (establish-construct). 1. 2 Polar compounds A common principle is to combine polar opposites, especially of adjectives. • Polar compounds comprising adjectives: Structure: adj.

Verb composition Compound verbs are essentially of three types: compounds that are difficult to analyse in synchrony; verbs with internal objects, and verbs involving the use of a verbalizer."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"458 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN 2. 1 Compounds that are difficult to analyse without a historical perspective The construction of these verbs is difficult to understand at the present time.

They are similar to certain English expressions such as \"to live life\", \"to dream a dream\", etc. These verbs, which are mainly trisyllabic, are relatively uncommon. ~t:;,·3i·~· rtsed-mo rtse \"to play\", ,t:;,·3i·t:;,,t:;,' gad mo dgad \"to laugh\", ~~·3j'·~· ltas mo tla \"to watch a show\", ~·31·~· rku-ma rku \"to steal\", ~'\\'z:::l'~'\\' skor ba skor \"to circle, circumam-bulate\", ~'z:::l'l.\\~' dri ba 'dri \"to ask questions\", ~·~31·~· rmi-lam rmi \"to dream\" (dial. or L), :::J'31':::J' za rna za \"to eat\" (dial. or L) 2.3 Compounds using verbalizers These verbs, consisting of a \"verbalizer\" and a noun constitute the majority of verbs in Standard Spoken Tibetan. The noun may be replaced by an adjective, an adverb or an onoma-topoeia. Remember that the three main verbalizers are: St:;,'byed \"to do, to act\", ~,. rgyag \"to make, to do\" and z:::ll]r::::' btang \"to send, to do\" (and their honorific equivalents, see Lesson 11).

Thus the organization of the table makes it possible to be read in two ways. It will tell you the pronunciation of a syllable from its spelling, and also provides the range of possible spellings for an identical pronunciation. The latter feature is particularly useful in view of the large number of homophonic syllables, which are spelled dif-ferently but pronounced the same. On the basis of this list, it will be possible to know the pronunciation of a syllable in both Standard Spoken as well as Literary Tibetan in nearly all cases. However, as in the case of Euro-pean languages, it is not always possible to predict the pronunciation of certain words. With these exceptions there is no exact correspondence between the written and phonetic forms. Remember also that ~ertain words exist only in the spoken language and have no corresponding written form. Phonological transcription is therefore indispensable in these cases. The following table presents first the Tibetan, then the transliteration in italics, and finally the pronunciation in roman font. The first part of the table presents the initial consonants of syllables and the second part the codas, that is, the vowels and final consonants of syllables. The initials of syllables often have two pronunciations. The first, which carries a tone, corresponds to the first syllable of a word. The second denotes the pronunciation of syllables within or at the end of a word, and is preceded by a dash. Certain other combinations involve an N, which corresponds to a nasal: m, ng or n. This nasal does not always manifest in speech, although it may do so commonly (see Appendix 1, section 1.1 ). The particular nasal involved, m, ng or n, is not always predictable, and depends on the words. Ex.: a-mdo > amto \"Amdo province\", rgya-mtsho > ky9,tso I ky~mtso \"ocean\", sku-mdun > kuntun \"(in) the presence, the Dalai Lama\" The table does not include certain regular variations in pronunciation that occur in the spoken language with respect to the literary pronunciation (see Appendix 1, section 1 ). The \"sharp\" symbol denotes combinations used in words borrowed from foreign languages. For certain combinations in syllabic rhyme, a second pronunciation, corresponding to a phoneme variant, is presented in parentheses. This variant may be used to reproduce actual pro-nunciation more closely and to make it easier to learn the proper sound."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"470 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Ex.: dmag-mi > ma'mi \"soldier\" (instead of makmi), gsar-'gyur > sa:ngkyur \"news\" (instead of sarngkyur), stag> ta' \"tiger\" (instead oftak) The dash after certain combinations means that this pronunciation is used only after an-other syllable. Ex.: khams-pa > khampa \"inhabitant of.Kham·, khrims-dpon > thnmpon \"judge\" Finally, remember that the apostrophe after a nasal represents a modulation as opposed to a flat tone, which carries no apostrophe.

(Remember that pronunciation is very different from spelling.) This Manual has been using a system of phonological transcription that was devised for teaching Tibetan and for use in scholarly works on the language and culture of the country. Its technical character makes it less than ideal for a wider readership, for example in magazine articles, popular books and maps. There is still no standard system of transcription for publications of this sort. In collected volumes of articles authors often use different ways of transcribing even the same word. Authors often come up with their own conventions without following any explicit principles. For example, the personal name that is spelled don-grub is rendered variously as Dondup, Dondrup, Dhondup, Dhundup, Tondup, Tondub, Thondup, etc. The same is true of the name of Tibet's second city, gzhis-ka-rtse, for which the following renderings are in current use: Shigatse, Shikatse, Rigaze, Xigaze, Zhigatse, etc. What is urgently needed is a system for standardising the transcription of Tibetan pronunciation, and this appendix suggests a simplified convention that would enable Tibetan names and most terms to be spelled consistently. The simplified notation presented here differs from the phonological transcription of the Manual in two main respects: The absence of special signs for marking tones; It can be easily and directly deduced from Wylie transliteration. The convention has been used in this work for presenting Tibetan names in English pas-sages. Although the simplified transcription doesn't use any diacritics, it gives a fairly clear indi-cation of how words are pronounced in Standard Tibetan, and where tonal distinctions should be made. In most cases there is only one possible unambiguous transcription for a given word if the rules are observed."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"476 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN The convention is relatively close to English pronunciation: Thus <ch> corresponds to the 'ch' of chair, <j> to the 'j' ofjazz, and <w> to the 'w' of win. Above all, the system suggested below has the advantage of being consistent and based on a simple principle, and hence avoids the idiosyncrasies to be found in much of the secondary literature on Tibet. a) The general principle The simplified transcription uses the same correspondences between the Tibetan script and the roman alphabet as the Wylie system of transliteration presented in Table 2 of the Introduction.

This concerns mainly the superscribed consonants r, l and s, the prefixes g, d, b, m and ', and the suffixes sand d. However, as the examples below will show, some affixed consonants are pronounced. Although the letters l and r are generally replaced by a lengthening of the preceding vowel, they will be retained here because they are still audible if a reader is enunciating carefully. The elimination of these sounds results in the remaining vowels and consonants being pronounced as they would be in Standard Tibetan. In the following examples, the letters that are actually pronounced are presented in bold type. Ex.: lha-sa> Lhasa, sa-skya-pa > Sakyapa, blo-bzang > Lobzang, rnying-ma-pa > Nyingrnapa, rdo-rje > Dorje, dge-lugs-pa > Gelugpa, gzhis-ka-rtse > Zhikatse, mar-me > marme."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Appendix 7 477 b) Special rules 1) The letters c and ch as used in the Wylie system are both marked as ch. Ex.: bcu > chu, lee > che, rin-chen bzang-po > Rinchen Zangpo, nag-chu > Nagchu. 2) When the vowels a, o, u are followed by the consonants d, n, l, s they acquire an umlaut and become, respectively, a, 6, ii. al ~ al, ol ~ 61, ul ~ iil. 6 corresponds to the sound 6 in German Gotter, or the eu in the French word feu. ii corresponds to the sound ii in German Riicke, or the u of the French word rue. a corresponds to the sound a in German Kiise, or the ai in French aime. Ex.: thub-bstan > Thubtan, 'jam-dpal-dbyangs > Jampiilyang, bka'-rgyud-pa > Kagyiipa, srong-btsan sgam-po > Songtsan Gampo, bsod-nams > S6nam, bstan-'dzin > Tandzin, mi-la-ras-pa > Milariipa. 3) The suffixes g and b on the end of a word are devoiced and marked ask and p. Ex.: dge-legs > Gelek, kha-btags > khatak, bka'-shag > kashak, thabs > thap. 4) When the simple consonants (that is, without affixes) ba and bo appear as the second syllable of a word, they are pronounced wa and wo. Ex.: lha-sa-ba > Lhasawa, jo-bo > Jhowo, dpa'-bo > pawo. 5) The initial consonant clusters py, phy and by are pronounced respectively ch, ch and j. Ex.: spyan-ras-gzig > Chanriizik, sbyin-bdag> Jindak 6) The initial consonant clusters kr, khr, gr, pr, phr, br, tr, thr, dr kr, pr, tr are all pronounced as tr. khr, phr, thr are all pronounced thr. gr, br, dr are all pronounced dr. Ex.: sgrol-ma > Dr6lma, rten-'brel > tendrel, 'bras-spungs > Drapung, 'phrin-las > thrinla 7) When a voiced radical such as g, j, d, b or dz or a cluster such as gy and by appears with no prefix, it is voiceless and slightly aspirated, a feature that will be marked by the addition of an h: gh, jh, dh, bh, dzh, ghy, jh."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"478 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN Ex.: bar-skor > Bharkor, ding-ri > Dhingri, jo-mo glang-ma > Jhomo Langma, jo-khang > Jhokhang, don-grub > Dhondrup, bag-gro > Bhagdro, byams-pa > jhampa, byang-thang > Jhangthang. dra-ba > dhrawa. 8) The consonant clusters dbr, dby and db dbr is pronounced r. dby is pronounced y, db is pronounced w.

There is no rule that can predict whether a word has one, two or more syllables, but there are important conventions concerning the phrase and clause prosody. It should be empha-sized that prosody and accentuation are extremely important for reading Literary Tibetan, whether verse or prose. Even from a grammatical point of view it is essential to make the right pauses and these follow some prosodic rules. If those rules are not applied, the text becomes incomprehensible for the hearer. The traditional Tibetan treaties of grammar and poetry do not provide these rules, probably because there were entirely different from those which applied to Sanskrit. However, when Tibetan scholars read a text,214 they naturally apply the prosodic and accentuation rules. • The main rule is that grammatical particles should normally be read together with the preceding word. There should not be any pause between the word and the following particle, but a pause after the particle. When there is a succession of particles (two or more), they should normally be read without an intervening pause. In most cases, grammatical particles are not stressed, but when there is a focus, a topical-ization or for metric reasons, it is possible to stress the particle. Here is the list of the main particles affected by the prosodic rule mentioned above: • the case particles: ~~· gis (or its variants), ~·du (or its variants), rl.l' la (or its variants), \"i~· nas, rl.l~' las, lr:::· dang, ~· gi (or its variants) • the quantifiers: ltlj' dag, it tsho, ~0-1~· rnams, rytl]'~tlj' to-cog (or its variants), ::5'3.1' tsam, ~tlj' zhig • the topicalizer ~· ni • the statement particle ~· 'o (or its variants) 214.

(see Lesson 4) affective (verb): With an affective verb, the subject is in the absolutive case (unmarked case) and the object is in the dative. (see Lesson 9) agentive: The agentive denotes the agent of an action (the ergative function) as well as the instrument, the cause of an action and manner in which it is produced (instrumental functions). The agentive may also be designated by the term \"ergative-instrumental\". (see Lesson 8) allocentric future: The allocentric future implies that the speaker intends to perform the action on behalf of an interlocutor. It can be used only in the first person singular (and occasionally plural) with voli-tional verbs. (see Lesson 23) anticipatory mood: In the case of interrogative sentences that directly concern the person being addressed, the ques-tioner must anticipate an answer containing an \"I\" or a \"we\" by making advance use of an ego-phoric auxiliary in the question itself. This \"anticipatory mood\" is a distinctive feature of Tibetan. It appears not only in Standard Tibetan but in all other Tibetan dialects too, though not in the classical literary language. aorist (aspect): The aorist is a perfective aspect of the verb that denotes that an action performed in the past has no bearing on the present. (see Lesson 10) aspect: Together with tense, verb aspect is an essential notion for understanding the system of verb \"tenses\" in the majority of the world's languages. Verb aspect specifies whether an action is completed (perfective) or non-completed (imperfective) with respect to a given reference-point (past, present or future). In Tibetan, the present and the imperfective past are formally identical, whereas the perfective past (the aorist and the perfect) have a completely different form. (see Lesson 10)"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"490 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN assertive (mood): The assertive mood corresponds to a historical or general truth, or a piece of information that the speaker regards as certain even if he or she may not have verified it directly. The mood is marked by appropriate verb auxiliaries. (see Lessons 5 and 10) associative: The associative case conveys the meaning of \"with\", \"against\" or \"from\", but it may also function as the conjunction \"and\". (see Lesson 9) causative/resultative verbs: Causative and resultative verbs are phonetically closely-related pairs. Causative verbs emphasize the cause of a process and the role of the agent in performing an action. Resultative verbs stress the result obtained and the state of the patient or object. All causative verbs are transitive and volitional. Resultative verbs are generally non-volitional and intransitive. (see Lesson 35) connective: The connective is a grammatical morpheme that makes it possible to turn two basic sentences into one. It corresponds to both coordinating and subordinating conjunctions of traditional grammar. directional (auxiliary): Directional auxiliaries are used with verbs of movement to indicate whether an action is taking place towards or away from the speaker or the point of reference. (see Lesson 41) egophoric (mood): The egophoric mood translates a personal knowledge on the part of the speaker, or else an intention on his or her part that is often directly implied in the event that he or she is describing. Egophoric auxiliaries are therefore always associated with an \"I\" (whether explicit or implicit) in the statement, whatever the function of that \"I\" may be (subject, object, indirect object or complement). (see Lessons 3 and 10) ergative: The ergative and the instrumental cases together provide the two functions of the agentive case. The ergative denotes the agent of the action. In syntactic terms, it denotes the subject of most transitive verbs. (see Lesson 8) ergative (verb): With an ergative verb, the subject is in the ergative case and the object is in the absolutive. (see Lesson 8) essential (stative verb): Stative verbs or essential copulas denote an essential quality inherent in the person or the thing. The difference between essential and existential verbs is similar to that between the Spanish verbs ser and estar. (see Lesson 6) evidential mood: See mediatory mood existential ( stative verb): Stative verbs or existential copulas express the existence of a phenomenon or a circumstantial characteristic that may often imply a value-judgment on the speaker's part. (see Lesson 6)"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Glossary 491 experiential (auxiliary): The use of this auxiliary signifies that the subject has experienced the action at least once in the past. (see Lesson 15) genitive: The genitive case denotes the noun complement (see Lesson 4). inferential (mood): The inferential mood implies that the speaker is basing what he or she is saying on an inference or a deduction drawn from the traces or results of a past action. The mood is expressed through the appropriate verb auxiliaries. (see Lesson 10) intentional (auxiliary): Intentional auxiliaries are compatible only with volitional verbs. They imply that the agent-speaker has voluntarily performed the action. (see Lessons 8 and 10) mediatory (mood): Mediatory moods are conveyed by auxiliary verbs (or copulas) and have the role of specifying the source of information that provides the authority for the speaker's statement. There are basically four moods: egophoric, testimonial, assertive and inferential. The information that all these moods convey is certain. (see Lessons 5 and 10) mnemic (auxiliary): The use of this type of auxiliary implies that the speaker has only a vague memory of what he or she is saying. (see Lesson 33) nominalizer: Nominalizers are suffixes that make it possible to transform a verb or clause into a noun (or a noun phrase). Verbs that have been nominalized in this way operate as nouns or participles, depending on the context. (see Lesson 11) oblique: The oblique case indicates the goal (dative function), place or direction (locative function). Thus, the oblique may be referred to as the \"dative-locative\". (see Lesson 5) participant: A participant is a person or thing that is involved in a process to some degree. It is generally a noun, which is directly governed by the verb. Different verbs may have one, two or three parti-cipants. Thus the verb \"to walk\", for example, has just one participant (the one who is walking), the verb \"to see\" has two (the seer and the seen), and the verb \"to give\" has three (the giver, the thing given, and the recipient). The same verb may have a different number of participants ac-cording to its particular meaning in a given context. perfect (aspect): The perfect is a perfective aspect of verbs that specifies that the result of an action performed in the past is still present at the time of utterance. (see Lesson10) possessive (verb): With a possessive verb (also called benefactive verb), the subject is in the dative case and the object is in the absolutive (see Lesson 9)"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"492 MANUAL OF STANDARD TIBETAN postposition: postposition: Postpositions are \"prepositions\" that go after the noun with which they are asso-ciated. They have the same function as prepositions (in, on, below, etc.) in European languages. (see Lesson 7) receptive (auxiliary): The receptive egophoric auxiliary, which is used only in the past, implies that the subject-speaker of a sentence has undergone the action, has perceived it (involuntarily) or has been its goal. (see Lesson 10) resultative verb: See causative verb secondary verb: \"Secondary\" verbs are for the most part modal verbs that go between the main verb and the final auxiliary. (see Lesson 11) self-corrective (auxiliary): \"Self-corrective\" auxiliaries imply that the speaker has just realized that he was mistaken or else that he has just discovered something. (see Lesson 33) situational grammar: Tibetan is particularly sensitive to situation and environment, as well as the sources of informa-tion on which a speaker's assertions are based. When a statement cannot be immediately associa-ted with a concrete situation of communication, Tibetans tend not to accept it or find it strange. One consequence of this attitude is a reluctance to present verbs in a series of conjugations. The existence of an anticipatory mood and evidential auxiliaries is a manifestation of this situational grammar. The specific function of auxiliaries in dreams or in reported speech also illustrates the importance of pragmatics in this language. (see Lessons 6 and 10) testimonial (mood): The testimonial mood specifies that the speaker was himself witness to what he is stating. The testimony is usually visual, but may also be based on hearing or any of the other senses (touch, smell or taste). This mood is marked by appropriate verb auxiliaries. (see Lessons 5 and 10) topicalizer: A topicalizer in Tibetan is a particle that makes it possible to emphasize or \"topicalize\" the group of words that precedes it. (see Lesson 25) valency (verb): The verb valency corresponds to the number of participants (or valents) with which a verb is combined. There are basically monovalent (valency of 1), bivalent (valency of 2) and trivalent (valency of 3) verbs. (Tibetan does not have any verb with zero valency). Thus the verb \"to walk\" is monovalent (the one who is walking), the verb \"to see\" is bivalent (the seer and the seen), and the verb \"to give\" is trivalent (the giver, the thing given, and the recipient). verb types: From a syntactic perspective, the Tibetan verbs may be divided into the following types: ergative verb, possessive verb (or benefactive verb) and affective verb, according to the various cases the verb governs. (see Lesson 9)."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Glossary 493 verbalizer: Verbalizers are verbs that are either intrinsically meaningless or have a general meaning such as \"to do\" or \"to send\". A great many verbs in Standard Spoken Tibetan consist of a noun followed by a verbalizer. Thus Tibetan doesn't say \"to study\" but \"to do study\". Similarly, for \"work\", \"telephone\" and \"photograph\", the literal translation of the Tibetan constructions would be \"to do work\", \"to send telephone\" and \"to make photograph\".(see Lesson 14) volitional/non-volitional verb: Tibetan verbs fall into two basic categories: volitional and non-volitional. The former relate to controllable actions, and are compatible with intentional (and any other) auxiliaries. The latter imply non-controllable processes that do not depend on the subject's volition and cannot be com-bined with intentional auxiliaries or imperative markers.
