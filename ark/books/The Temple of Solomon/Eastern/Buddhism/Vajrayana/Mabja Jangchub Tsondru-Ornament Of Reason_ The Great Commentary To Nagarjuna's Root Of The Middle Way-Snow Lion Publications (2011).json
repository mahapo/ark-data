Throughtheir persistent efforts, working in small teams, they made books available toTibetans that allowed a deep understanding of the Buddha’s teachings to takeroot in Tibet. It was this understanding that later found expression in the manybooks composed by Tibetan authors. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to knowthat there are groups of experienced translators today, similar to those of thepast, such as the Dharmachakra Translation Committee, who are working steadilyto translate Buddhist books from Tibetan into English and other Westernlanguages. Undoubtedly these will make an invaluable contribution to a deep andlasting understanding of the Buddhist tradition.The revered Indian master Nāgārjuna was extremely kind, like a second Buddha. Hewas a scholar of high distinction, who was renowned for his spiritualrealization. The Buddha made a prophecy in the Lankavatara Sutra about hiscoming and what he would do to preserve and propagate Buddhism. He restored thedeclining Mahayana tradition and his six works on the Madhyamika view laid thebasis for the Madhyamika School. Even to this day we regard Arya Nāgārjuna asthe final authority concerning the Madhyamika point of view.Nāgārjuna’s Root of the Middle Way presents a clear, firm philosophical thesiswith respect to things’ lacking true existence. It argues that just as sentientbeings are devoid of innate existence, so are all Buddhas, the cycle ofexistence, and the tranquility of nirvana. Such assertions are a great source ofinspiration, for they suggest that each of us has the opportunity to scale thegreatest spiritual heights, provided we tread the right path.I am pleased to know that great care has been taken in preparing thistranslation along with the early Tibetan commentator Mabja Jangchub Tsöndrü’sexplanation of the Root of the Middle Way. I have no doubt that readersinterested in the development of the Madhyamika view will derive great benefitfrom this work. I congratulate all who have participated in this translation andoffer my prayers that the good you have done will make a far-reachingcontribution to peace and enlightenment in the world.Image [images/00004.jpg]11 September 2008"},{"pageContent":"TRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTIONIN THE Root of the Middle Way, Nāgārjuna presents a magical method of reasoning,inviting everyone who encounters these lucid and fearless contemplations tofollow him on a journey to the heart of transcendent insight. Inspired by theBuddha’s teachings on profound emptiness in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras, Nāgārjunasets out to probe what appears to be the most fundamental facts of the world,challenging us to question even our most deeply ingrained ideas and what seem tobe self-evident facts.In a series of unassuming and penetrating investigations, he asks basicquestions. What does it mean for something to occur, for something to takeplace? What is meant by “going” or by “coming”? What is an “action” and who orwhat might perform such an act? Does the eye see? Does fire burn fuel? What isan example of being right? What does it mean to be wrong? What is confinement?What is freedom? Nāgārjuna extends an invitation to open-minded and unprejudicedinquiry, and from his reader he asks for nothing more and nothing less thansincere and honest answers. Yet where are our answers? Once we begin to followNāgārjuna’s clear and direct steps, the gateway to the inconceivable emerges.Perhaps unexpectedly.In the nearly two thousand years since these verses first appeared,1 the Root ofthe Middle Way (or M ūlamadhyamaka-kārikās as they are known in their originalSanskrit) has continued to provoke and inspire, and its place among our world’sgreat literary treasures cannot be questioned. First in Asia, and more recentlythroughout the world, these verses have continued to serve as a vexing nexus ofphilosophical inquiry, just as they have emerged as a timeless source ofliberating insights.The present work contains Nāgārjuna’s verses on the Middle Way (Skt. Madhyamaka,Tib. dBu ma), accompanied by Mabja Jangchub Tsöndrü’s famed commentary, theOrnament of Reason. 2 Active in the twelfth century, Mabja was among the firstTibetans to rely on the works of the Indian master Candrakīrti,3 and his accountof the Middle Way exercised a deep and lasting influence on the development ofMadhyamaka philosophy in all four schools of Buddhism in Tibet.4 Sharp, concise,and yet comprehensive, the Ornament of Reason has been cherished by generationsof scholar-practitioners. The late Khunu Lama Tenzin Gyaltsen Rinpoche,5 arenowned authority on the subject, often referred to this commentary as “thebest there is.”6 We are delighted to present here an English translation ofNāgārjuna’s classic treatise in the company of Mabja’s dynamic explanations.Technical Notes and AcknowledgmentsOur translation of the Root of the Middle Way is based on the Tibetan versioncontained in the Derge (sDe dge) edition of the Tibetan Tripitaka, and for theOrnament of Reason we have relied on the woodblock prints prepared under theauspices of the sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa.7 In working with Nāgārjuna’s verses,we have benefited greatly from the scholarly works of others, and we wish inparticular to thank professors Shoryu Katsura and Mark Siderits for making adraft of their lucid translation and commentary on the Root of the Middle Wayavailable to us.8 It has likewise been a great advantage to have access to thecomprehensive work of Jay Garfield and Ngawang Samten.9 Particularly challengingpoints were discussed with the kind and expert help of Khenpo Sherab Sangpo,Khenpo Jampa Donden, professor Tom Tillemans, professor John Dunne, and Dr.Mattia Salvini. We are most grateful to them all. The entire production of themanuscript for this book was sponsored by a grant from the Tsadra Foundation. Wesincerely thank the Foundation for their generous and inspiring support.Personally, I wish to express my gratitude to Tulku Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche,himself known as an emanation of Nāgārjuna, for his clear and profoundMadhyamaka teaching, and to Khenpo Chöga, Lobpön Yeshe Trinley, Khenpo SherabÖser, Tulku Sang-ngag Tendzin, and Khenpo Sherab Sangpo (here mentioned in theorder that I was able to learn from them at Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling Monastery)with whom I have had the fortune of studying a few Indian Madhyamaka treatises,including the Root of the Middle Way.Tulku Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche conceived the present translation of Nāgārjuna’sverses and Mabja’s commentary, and the Dharmachakra Translation Committeeproduced it under Rinpoche’s guidance and supervision. I prepared thetranslation, and Cortland Dahl subsequently edited and compared it against theTibetan. Rafael Ortet created the reproductions of Mabja’s multilayered “topicaloutline” (sa bcad) that appear in the appendix. Michael Wakoff copyedited thebook and prepared the index. The responsibility for any errors and shortcomingsof this book is my own.For those wishing to read the Ornament of Reason back to back with the original,we have made a cross-referenced version of the Tibetan text, prepared by KarmaÖser, available for download on the Web site of the Dharmachakra TranslationCommittee, www.dharmachakra.net. [http://www.dharmachakra.net]10We are all deeply thankful to His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama forblessing this book with a foreword.May whatever goodness there may be in producing this book become a perfectcircumstance for happiness and awakening throughout the world. In particular,may it serve to ensure the auspicious and continuous presence of our lord ofrefuge, Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche, and of all other masters who flawlessly upholdthe sacred Dharma—scripture and realization.On behalf of the team,Thomas H.

[I.1]There are four conditions:Causal, objective, immediately preceding,And, likewise, the ruling.There is no fifth condition. [I.2]The nature of things is notIn conditions and so forth.If there is no thing itself,How could there be anything other? [I.3]Actions do not have conditions,Yet there are no actions without conditions.Without an action there are no conditions,Yet no conditions are involved in an action. [I.4]They are known as conditionsBecause things arise in dependence on them.Yet as long as nothing arises,Why would they not be nonconditions? [I.5]Neither for the nonexistent, nor for the existent,Could there possibly be conditions.For the nonexistent, what would be conditioned?For the existent, what role could conditions play? [I.6]If no existent, nonexistent, or both existent and nonexistentPhenomenon comes into being,How can we speak of “effectuating conditions”?When this is the case, they do not make sense. [I.7]It is explained that, with existent phenomena,There are no observations whatsoever.How could a phenomenon for which there is no observationEver relate to an observation? [I.8]If phenomena have not arisen,Cessation makes no sense.Hence, an immediately preceding condition is untenable.If it has ceased, how could it be a condition? [I.9]Since there is no existenceOf things that have no nature,Saying, “this occurs because of that”Would not make any sense. [I.10]In separate conditions and their gathering,The effect is entirely absent.How could something that does not exist in the conditionsEver arise from them? [I.11]If, without being present there,It were still to arise from conditions,Why would it not also ariseFrom that which is not a condition? [I.12]The effect may be of its conditions’ nature,But these conditions have no nature of their own.How could the effect of that which is not an entity itselfBe of the nature of that which conditions it? [I.13]Hence, it is not of the nature of its conditions,Nor of the nature of that which are not its conditions.As there is no effect, how could there beConditions as well as nonconditions?

[II.1]Where there is movement, there is going,And movement is found where walking takes place,Not where going has been, nor where it has yet to occur.Hence, going is found where walking takes place. [II.2]Going where walking takes place,How could that make sense,When, without going, there cannot reasonably beAny place where walking takes place? [II.3]For whomever there is going where walking takes place,It then followsThat there is no going where walking takes placeBecause “going is found where walking takes place.” [II.4]If going took place where walking takes place,It would follow that there are two acts of going:One due to which tshere is a place with walkingAnd another that is the going that happens there. [II.5]When it follows that there are two acts of going,It follows that there are two agents of going,Because without something that goes,It makes no sense for there to be going. [II.6]If there is nothing that goes,Going makes no sense.In the absence of any going,How could there be one who goes? [II.7]One who goes does not go,Nor does one who does not go.Other than goers and nongoers,What third party could be going? [II.8]When, in the absence of going,A goer does not make sense,The statement “going is engaged in by the one who goes”—How could that possibly make sense? [II.9]For those who hold that going is engaged in by one who goesIt would then follow that there isOne who goes in the absence of going,For it is asserted that going is performed by one who goes. [II.10]If going is engaged in by the one who goes,It follows that there are two acts of going:One that characterizes the one who goes,And another going in that capacity. [II.11]Going does not begin where it has been,Nor does it begin where it has yet to occur.Going does not begin where walking takes place,So where does going begin? [II.12]Before going has been initiated,There is no place where walking occurs or has taken placeUpon which going could begin.And how could there be going where there is none yet? [II.13]Since we never witness a beginning of goingHow can we conceive of the traversed,Of what is being traversed,And what has yet to be traversed? [II.14]The one who goes does not stand still,Nor does one who does not go.Aside from those that do and do not go,What third party could stand still? [II.15]In the absence of going,There cannot reasonably be anyone who goes.How, then, could it reasonably be saidThat it is the one who goes who stands still? [II.16]Stopping does not occur where walking takes place,Where going has been, or where it has yet to occur.With going, beginning, and stopping,The case is the same as with going. [II.17]The act of going and the one who goesCannot rightly be said to be the same.The act of going and the one who goesCannot rightly be said to be different. [II.18]If that which is the goingWere also the one who goes,It would follow that agent and actWould be one and the same. [II.19]Yet if the going and goerAre thought to be different,There could be going without something that goesAnd someone who goes in the absence of going. [II.20]When two things cannot beEstablished as identical,Yet not as different things either,How can they be established at all?

THE DHARMA The first of these topics includes three further topics: (1) the various uses ofthe word “dharma,” (2) an explanation of this term, and (3) an identification ofthe dharma that is relevant in the present context. USES OF THE TERM “DHARMA” Regarding the first topic, it is taught:> Dharma can mean object of cognition, path,> Transcendence of suffering, object of the mind,> Merit, life, excellent discourse, what will happen,> That which is certain, and spiritual tradition.12 As indicated here, each occurrence of the word “dharma” found in the sūtras andthe treatises should be understood with reference to this set of ten meanings.EXPLANATION OF THE TERM “DHARMA” Second, the term “dharma” derives from the Sanskrit word dharaṅa, which means tohold. This can be understood to mean the holding of specific characteristics andalso holding in the sense of protecting from a fall. In the first case, the word“dharma” is used to denote that all defiling and undefiling objects of cognitionhold their own characteristics. An example of this usage would be the sentence“all dharmas are devoid of self.” In the second case, holding has the specific meaning of protecting one fromfalling into the lower realms, and, more generally, of keeping one from fallinginto the cyclic existence of the five classes of wandering beings. An example ofthe first usage is found in the following verses:> The one who practices Dharma rests at ease,> Both in this world and beyond. As indicated here, the word “dharma” may refer to the practice of the ten formsof virtue. Such virtuous activity may be instigated by the faith of convictionin karmic action and its effects, or based on the authentic views of worldlybeings (which may also be found among certain non-Buddhists). This usage canalso refer to mundane forms of concentration, such as the cultivation of themeditative absorptions associated with the formless realms.The second sense of holding can be illustrated by statements such as, “I go forrefuge in the Dharma, supreme among all that is free from attachment.” Here, thereference is to the unique Dharma in which Buddhists take refuge. This refers tothe Dharma of realization (the two truths of complete purification) and theDharma of scripture that applies to this realization. As is taught:> The sacred Dharma of the Teacher is twofold:> It is of the nature of scripture and realization.13 THE DHARMA BEING TAUGHT IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT Third, in this particular context we are concerned with the Dharma of theexcellent discourses, the Dharma of scripture. On this topic, it is taught: > The entire Dharma is contained in the words of the Buddha and the treatises,> The excellent statements and the commentaries on their intent.14 As stated here, there are two divisions: (1) the words of the Buddha, theexcellent statements made by the truly and completely enlightened one, and (2)the treatises that definitively explain their meaning. The first category, thewords of the Buddha, can be understood with reference to (1) its definingcharacteristics, (2) the meaning of the defined term, and (3) a classificationof that which bears these characteristics. The Words of the Buddha The Defining Characteristics of the Words of the BuddhaFirst, regarding the defining characteristics of the words of the Buddha, it istaught:> That which holds meaning, closely connected with the Dharma,> And which is a speech that eliminates the afflictions of the three realms,> While revealing the benefits of peace—> That is the speech of the Sage, and anything else is not.15 As indicated here, the words of the Buddha are stainless words and syllables.Their subject matter is the three precious trainings. In terms of function, theycompletely eliminate the afflictions of the three realms. As their result, theyreveal, or bring about, the attainment of the three forms of the transcendenceof suffering. Thus, the defining characteristics of the words of the Buddha liein their being endowed with these four aspects of confident speech. Thisformulation simply goes to show how the teachings found in the sūtras andtreatises are distinguished from those of non-Buddhist scriptures. Hence, fromthe point of view of excluding that which does not fall into this category, thewords of the Buddha can also be defined as Dharma that arises directly from theBuddha as its ruling condition.The Defined TermSecond, the Buddha’s “words” are referred to as such because they are verbalexpressions.Classifications of the Words of the BuddhaThird, of the various ways to classify the words of the Buddha, one popularthreefold division distinguishes them with reference to their ruling conditions.Here, the three divisions are those that were actually spoken, those ofblessings, and those of acceptance.The words of the Buddha can also be divided in terms of when they were spoken.In order to tame individuals inclined to the Lesser Vehicle, such as theexcellent retinue of five, the Buddha turned the Dharma wheel of the initialteachings of the four truths. He turned this wheel of Dharma using a twelvefoldsequence at the Deer Park of the Forest of the Falling Sages in Varanasi. Thecontent of these teachings covers both conduct and view. Conduct, here, involvesnot harming sentient beings. In terms of the view, he simply taught the sixteenaspects of the four noble truths or, in other words, that the aggregates aremerely impermanent phenomena, empty of any personal self in the form of an agentor consumer.To tame individuals with a potential for the Great Vehicle, the Buddha turnedthe intermediate wheel of Dharma on the absence of characteristics, thusteaching the extensive, middling, and concise sūtras [on Transcendent Insight].The setting for these teachings was Vulture Peak Mountain. In terms of content,the vast conduct presented in these teachings consists of working for thewelfare of others with great compassion, while the profound view is taught to beemptiness free from all the constructs associated with persons and phenomena.For those individuals with a potential to be inclined toward a diversity ofvehicles, the Buddha turned the final wheel of Dharma on the definitive meaningat locations such as Laṅkapūri. In terms of content, these teachings explain theconduct as consisting in working for the welfare of others on vast scale, andwith respect to the view, they address a qualm that is based on a perceivedcontradiction between the initial and intermediate teachings. The initialteachings explain that, while there is no person, the mere phenomena of the fiveaggregates, or those associated with the four truths, do exist. The intermediateteachings, meanwhile, claim that these phenomena are nonexistent as well.Addressing this problem, the followers of the Yogic Practice School consider theintent of the third set of teachings to be the mind only [position]. Whenstating that these phenomena are nonexistent, they explain, the second set ofteachings intends to show the nonexistence of the imaginary object-subjectduality. This does not, however, mean that the dependent, nondual cognition thatis the support for the afflictions and their purification is also nonexistent.Therefore, they say, these two do not contradict one another.The learned followers of noble Nāgārjuna, however, employ scripture andreasoning to explain the intent of the sūtras without error. They resolve themessage of the first and second sets of teachings in the following way: In theinitial set of teachings, the aggregates, elements, and sense sources (or themere phenomena associated with the four truths, the dependently originatedphenomena that are devoid of a person and subsumed by affliction andpurification) are said to exist. This statement is made in consideration of therelative, deluded perspective. On the other hand, in the second set of teachingsthese are all said to be nonexistent. This statement accords with the ultimate,rational perspective that is free from delusion. Hence, they say, there is nocontradiction. Together, these are the three stages of the words of the Buddha.With respect to their content, one may make a twofold distinction between thesūtras of expedient meaning, which explain the vast relative truth, and thesūtras of definitive meaning, which teach the ultimate truth of profoundemptiness. With reference to the expressions that convey this content, one maydistinguish Sūtra from the other categories that make up the twelve aspects ofmelodious speech. In terms of their respective focus, the teachings can bedivided into the Three Precious Collections with regard to which of the threeprecious trainings they emphasize. Alternatively, Sūtra can be seen to conciselyteach the nature of all three precious trainings, while the Vinaya sets forththe training of discipline in detail, and the Abhidharma gives an elaboratepresentation of the training of insight.In terms of inferiority and superiority, the words of the Buddha can also bedivided into the Lesser Vehicle and Great Vehicle. The Great Vehicle can befurther divided into the Causal Vehicle of Characteristics and the ResultantVehicle of Secret Mantra.The TreatisesTo ascertain the general nature of the treatises, we shall consider (1) theirdefining characteristics, (2) the meaning of the defined term, and (3) aclassification of the bearers of the characteristics.Defining Characteristics of the TreatisesRegarding the first topic, a treatise is written by a fully qualified individualbased on the teachings of the truly and completely enlightened one. Thefollowing passage explains further:> That which assumes the perspective of the Victor’s teachings alone,> Was written by one with an undistracted mind,> And accords with the path through which liberation is achieved> Should be venerated with the crown of one’s head, just like the Sage’s> teachings.16 The Defined TermSecond, the term “treatise” derives from the Sanskrit word śāsana, 17 meaningconquering, dispelling, or healing. Hence, a śāstra, or treatise, is somethingthat thoroughly conquers the enemy of the afflictions, dispels concepts, or,through these two, heals the mind of the student. Alternatively, [the term“treatise” is also associated with the Sanskrit] word trā﻿ṇa,18 meaningprotection. Hence, a treatise can also be taken to refer to something thatprotects one from both the lower realms and existence. Thus, it is taught:> It is śāstra since it dispels concepts,> And because it heals grasping And:> Conquering all the enemies, the afflictions, without exception,> While protecting from the lower realms and existence,> The treatises possess the qualities of being able to protect and heal,> Two qualities that are absent in the traditions of others.19 These qualities are also found in the words of the Buddha. This does not pose aproblem, however, because this explanation of the term is meant to show thedecisive superiority of Buddhist treatises over non-Buddhist ones, rather thantheir defining characteristics. Classification of the TreatisesThird, of the various ways to classify the treatises, one popular approach is todistinguish the treatises with respect to the words of the Buddha they explain,in which case there are two divisions. The first group of treatises presentsgeneral comments on the common meaning of the words of the Buddha, while thesecond explains the intent of particular teachings. The first category containstreatises that clarify the words and meanings that relate to the words of theBuddha in general, such as those on linguistics and reliable means of cognition.The second category can be further classified with reference to the three wheelsof Dharma. First we have the treatises that clarify the view and conductassociated with the wheel of Dharma of the four truths. This includes theVinaya-sūtra and the Treasury of Abhidharma. Second are the treatises thatclarify the meaning of the sūtras on the absence of characteristics, withinwhich there are two categories. One is constituted by the master Nāgārjuna’s SixCollections of Reasoning and the treatises that adhere to them. These are worksthat use reasoning to explain what is taught explicitly by the Sūtras [ofTranscendent Insight], namely, the natural emptiness of all phenomena that isobserved by insight, or the view. The second category contains the nobleMaitreya’s Ornament of Manifest Realization and the treatises that adhere to it.Distinguishing between eight manifest realizations, these works clarify theimplicit teaching of the sūtras. They are thus concerned with the subject andthe stages of manifest realization that comprise the path and fruition.The treatises associated with the third wheel of Dharma explain the intent ofthe final teachings of definitive meaning. Among these treatises, some rely uponthe view of the Mind Only School to explain numerous principles associated withthe view and conduct. In this category we find the noble Maitreya’sDistinguishing the Middle from Extremes, Ornament of the Sūtras, andDistinguishing Phenomena from Their Intrinsic Nature. This also includes thetreatises that adhere to these three, such as the master Asaṅga’s fivefoldGrounds of Yogic Practice and his two compendia, as well as the masterVasubandhu’s eightfold prakara﻿ṇa. There are also treatises that explain theintent of the final set of teachings to be the Middle Way. These include thenoble Maitreya’s Supreme Continuity and the master Candrakīrti’s Entering theMiddle Way.In terms of function, treatises can be divided into three categories: those thatdiscern the profound, those that summarize the vast, and those that systematizethe scattered. With respect to their particular focus, there are theaforementioned three categories of treatises that clarify the meaning of thethree collections. In terms of content, treatises can be categorized as thosethat explain the sūtras of expedient meaning and those that explain the sūtrasof definitive meaning. A distinction may also be made between those that clarifythe nature of the Lesser Vehicle and those that pertain to the Great Vehicle.With regard to quality, treatises can also be divided into nine categories, asexplained in the following passage:> Meaningless, mistaken, and meaningful;> Deceitful, unkind, and relinquishing suffering;> In pursuit of learning, argument, and practice—> Treatises are held to be threefold and free from six.20 The Significance of the Present TreatiseIn this way, the Dharma of scripture consists of the words of the Buddha andtreatises. Here it is the latter that will be explained. The meaning of thisparticular treatise will be ascertained under three headings: (1) the uniquenessof the author, (2) his literary corpus, and (3) the nature of his treatise [onthe Middle Way].The AuthorThis treatise was composed by the master Nāgārjuna. According to some scholars,there are five features that distinguish Nāgārjuna: (1) He took birth as theLicchavī youth, Sarvalokapriyadarśana, (2) as the monk Matidhara, and (3) as themaster Nāgārjuna; (4) he attained the first ground of the Truly Joyous; and (5)he was prophesied in various sūtras and tantras taught by the Bliss-Gone One.The first three of these are held to be circumstantial distinctions, whereas thelast two distinguish his nature. Other scholars mention three distinctions: thequalities Nāgārjuna attained, the enlightened activities he performed, and thepraises he received.Nāgārjuna’s QualitiesThe qualities achieved by this master relate to his extraordinary abandonmentand realization. A member of the Brahmin caste, Nāgārjuna left home withouttaking even a needle; he was completely unattached to the pleasures of householdlife. Having become a fully ordained monk and completing the preliminary processof training, he underwent fifty-three trials without becoming tainted by eventhe slightest evil deed. He then beheld the intrinsic nature, which is empty ofboth the self of the person and of phenomena, and thereby eliminated therelevant afflictive and cognitive obscurations that are to be overcome. This washis extraordinary abandonment.In terms of realization, Nāgārjuna had a universal insight into the five fieldsof learning, yet his particular achievement was an illuminated realization ofthe inner science, the full range of the Bliss-Gone One’s teachings. Morespecifically, he internalized the Dharma of scripture by flawlessly realizingthe definitive meaning of the Great Vehicle’s sūtras and tantras. He likewisedirectly perceived and realized the omnipresence of the basic field of phenomenaon the first ground and achieved its twelve hundred qualities, which includesbeing able to simultaneously behold the face of one hundred Buddhas. With this,he internalized the Dharma of realization. This was Nāgārjuna’s extraordinaryrealization.Nāgārjuna’s ActivitiesAs for Nāgārjuna’s extraordinary activities, let us recall the following verses:> At this time, for such an individual generosity is predominant> As the initial cause of complete Buddhahood.21 As outlined here, Nāgārjuna trained specifically in transcendent generosity,which is the main activity of the first ground. He also established supports forthe three jewels, the perfect cause of accomplishing the welfare of both oneselfand others. Concerning the first of these, Nāgārjuna was generous with materialthings. He used his abilities as an alchemist, for example, to gain mastery overouter, material necessities, which he then distributed without attachment. Withrespect to internal things, he even gave away his own head to someone who wantedit. In healing the sick and protecting others from nāgas and other malevolentforces, he also generously gave the gift of fearlessness and protection.Finally, Nāgārjuna generously gave the undefiled gift of Dharma. He retrievedthe scriptures on transcendent insight, such as the One Hundred Thousand VerseSūtra, from the realm of nāgas, while from the land of Oḍḍiyāna he revealednumerous tantras of secret mantra that he had received from the hands of theḍākinīs. All of these teachings he then propagated extensively, in addition tocomposing treatises that flawlessly clarify their meaning.As shown above, Nāgārjuna also established supports for the three jewels. Heconstructed ten million temples, for example, in accord with the instructions ofthe preceptor Rāhulabhadra, thus erecting supports of the Buddha’s body, speech,and mind. In this way, he established supports for the jewel of the Buddha. Asjust mentioned, Nāgārjuna also revealed many classes of sūtra and tantra andwrote treatises to clarify their meaning. Moreover, he also achieved the firstground and the path of seeing. In this way, he established supports for thejewel of the Dharma in terms of both scripture and realization. As a monk whohad completed the preparatory steps, and as a bodhisattva abiding on the firstground, Nāgārjuna was himself a member of the Sangha. In this capacity, heserved to establish others in these positions, thus establishing supports forthe jewel of Sangha.Praises of NāgārjunaWe shall consider the extraordinary praise that Nāgārjuna received in terms of(1) the name for which he was naturally qualified, (2) his renown throughout theworld, and (3) his being praised by the Buddha in many sūtras and tantras.Concerning the first, the syllable ga in the name Nāgārjuna contains a longsyllable a as the result of the joining of nāga and arjuna. Thus, nāga-arjunaliterally means “nāga-existence-accomplisher.” Although “existence” is notexplicit, it is nevertheless implicitly contained in the name. His name beginswith the word “nāga” because he has five qualities in common with the nāgas: (1)He does not adhere to extreme inferior views; (2) he lives in the ocean ofwakefulness pertaining to the first ground; (3) he is the master of the jewelsof profound dependent origination free from arising and cessation, which is thesubject matter expressed in the treasury of the Bliss-Gone One’s excellentdiscourses; (4) with the fire of reason arising from the view of selflessness,he completely incinerates the firewood of mistaken philosophies that arepoisonous to perception, those constructed by non-Buddhists and Buddhists alike;and (5) he dispels the darkness in the mind of ordinary mundane individuals whoare not spoiled by philosophy.[“Arjuna,” which literally means] “existence-accomplisher,” is also part ofNāgārjuna’s name. This is due to the two qualities that he shares with Arjuna:First, his speech of nondual wakefulness is straight and piercing, as if it werethe arrow of King Arjuna. Second, for the sake of his disciples throughout theworld, including the gods, he uses [this weapon of non-dual wakefulness] tovanquish any enemy within the three realms of existence, and so he establishesthe reign of the great King of Dharma.Concerning the second point, we may note that Nāgārjuna became renownedthroughout the world as a second Buddha.Third are the many prophecies about Nāgārjuna. The Sūtra of the Great Cloud, forexample, states:> Ānanda, four hundred years after I have completely transcended suffering this> Licchavī youth, Sarvalokapriyadarśana, will become a monk by the name of Nāga.> He will teach my doctrine thoroughly and completely, before finally departing> to a realm known as Perfectly Clear Light. There he will become fully and> completely enlightened as a thus-gone one, a foe destroyer, a truly and> completely enlightened one known as Light of the Source of Wakefulness. In the Journey to Laṅkā, Mahāmati asks: > Once the Bliss-Gone One has transcended suffering,> Who will uphold the teachings? And in reply:> Once the Bliss-Gone One has transcended suffering,> The one who will uphold the teachings> Will appear after some time has passed.> Know this, Mahāmati.> In the southern land of Bheta,> There will be a glorious monk of great renown> Known by the name Nāga.> Concerning my teachings in this world,> He will destroy positions of existence and nonexistence,> Thoroughly teaching the unsurpassable Great Vehicle.> Having reached the ground of the Truly Joyous,> He will depart for the Realm of Bliss. The Root Tantra of Mañjusrī states:> Once I have transcended suffering> Four hundred years will pass,> Then one who works to benefit my teachings,> A monk known as Nāgārjuna, will appear.> Accomplishing the insight of “the peacock,”> [He will compose] numerous treatises on the meaning of the element.> Aware of thatness, the nature devoid of entity,> He will live for six hundred years.> Once he has left this body behind,> He will leave for the Realm of Bliss.> Immediately thereafter, he is sure> To accomplish Buddhahood itself. While in the Sūtra of the Great Drum, it is taught:> Ānanda, eighty years after I have gone completely beyond suffering, this> Licchavī youth, Sarvalokapriyadarśana, will become a monk named Matidhara, a> holder of this Sūtra of the Great Drum. And:> Then, four hundred years after I have gone beyond suffering, he will become a> monk known as He Who Sustains and will spread my teachings. Nāgārjuna’s Literary CorpusSecond, we shall consider the character of Nāgārjuna’s literary corpus. In ageneral sense, the treatises composed by this master can be grouped into (1)those that explain the Causal Vehicle of Characteristics, (2) those that explainthe Resultant Vehicle of Secret Mantra, and (3) those that show these twovehicles to be identical in meaning. The first category contains the followingworks: The Sixfold Collection of Middle Way Reasoning, which is composed oftreatises that primarily explain the view; the extensive Accumulations ofEnlightenment, the moderate-length Compendium on the Sūtras, and the conciseLetter from a Friend, which are treatises that primarily explain conduct; andthe Jewel Garland, which places equal emphasis on view and conduct in the formof advice to a king.The Sixfold Collection of ReasoningThe first group contains a definitively numbered body of six treatises. Thiscollection resolves flawlessly what is observed through the view, or insight,namely, the natural emptiness of all phenomena, or the two truths. Of these six,there are two primary treatises that teach all aspects of this content, andwhich thus resemble a complete body. The remaining four were written to dispelmistaken ideas with regard to isolated aspects of this content. These subsidiarytreatises, therefore, resemble limbs.The first of these two groups is definitively composed of two treatises: theFundamental Insight22 and the Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning. Some explain theFundamental Insight to be a teaching on dependent origination free from arising,cessation, and the rest of the eight constructed extremes and the Sixty Stanzasto be a teaching on the absence of the four constructed extremes of arising,cessation, existence, and non-existence. Nevertheless, what appears to besupported by the texts themselves is that the former teaches natural emptinessby means of eliminative negation, while the latter also teaches naturalemptiness, yet by way of determinative affirmation in terms of mere convention.The four subsidiary treatises are likewise definitively numbered at four. TheRebuttal of Objections is an appendix that addresses a perceived contradictionin the refutation of origination from other that is found the Root of the MiddleWay’s analysis of conditions. On this topic, the Root of the Middle Way teaches:> The nature of things is not> In conditions and so forth.> If there is no thing itself,> How could there be anything other?23Here, it is argued that external and internal effects cannot be present in theirindividual causes and conditions, in a conglomeration of such causes andconditions, or in anything else before they themselves arise. If they were, theywould appear to us, and yet we do not observe them. Such an arising would alsobe meaningless. For this reason, if one thing is absent in something else, thelatter cannot be the basis for the arising of the former, just as oil cannot beproduced from sand. Therefore, since things do not arise from something otherthan themselves, they are emptiness and devoid of nature.Others may object to this, saying: “Well, if things could not arise fromsomething other than themselves, as you proponents of the Middle Way suggest,this very line of reasoning would also affect your thesis that negates thenature of things. Since this would also prove that your own argument does notarise, it would itself end up being emptiness devoid of nature. As such, itwould be incapable of refuting the positions of others. If, on other hand, yourwords do have their own nature, your previous thesis concerning the absence ofnature would be undermined. Moreover, you would also have to state the specificreason that shows why words alone possess a nature.” Hence, we find theobjection:> If all of these things> Did not have a nature,> Your words would also lack nature,> And thus be incapable of refuting nature. > If, on the other hand, things do have nature,> Your previous thesis will be undermined.> If there is, indeed, a difference,> Then present an argument for this distinction.24 In response, it is taught: “Since my words do not have any nature, there is nocontradiction in teaching the emptiness of all phenomena. For the same reason,there is no need to account for a difference either. Because they lack nature,my words cannot, in reality, refute the position of others. Hence, since boththe object and the agent of negation are not established in reality, I do notclaim that a negation of the positions of others takes place either.Nevertheless, although no nature exists, this does not mean that another’sposition cannot be refuted in terms of mere convention, just as an illusoryperson may defeat another illusory person, and the water in a dream may seem toextinguish fire.” Addressing this issue, the Rebuttal of Objections states:> As there is nothing whatsoever to negate,> I myself negate nothing at all.> Therefore, when accusing me of negation,> It is you who are guilty of denigration.25 And:> An emanation may refute an emanation;> An illusory being may refute an illusion.> Just like these forms of refutation> Do I assert this negation to be.26 Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness addresses an objection to the Fundamental Insight’sanalysis of the conditioned. In this analysis, the natural establishment of thecharacteristics of the conditioned, that is, arising, abidance, and cessation,is refuted. Some, however, object that this refutation conflicts with thefollowing statement from the Sūtra of the Great Cloud:> Monks, these three are the characteristics of the conditioned.> Conditionality, disintegration, and the transformation of what abides are all> evident. In reply, it is said: “This statement takes into account the deluded perspectiveof conventional cognition. From this perspective, arising, abiding, andcessation seem to take place, though these do not possess any nature. Rather,they are dreamlike and illusory. Therefore, since this passage is not statingthat these are established by nature, it does not contradict our refutation ofnatural existence.” Thus the Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness states:> Abiding, arising and cessation; existence and nonexistence;> The inferior, mediocre, and exceptional—> The Buddha spoke of these from the perspective of mundane convention,> Not from that of ultimate reality.27 Detailed Examination is likewise a reply to an objection. Some may object thatif things have no nature of their own, it would contradict the establishment ofsuch natures by reliable means of cognition. In reply, it is said: “To establishthat things possess their own natures using reliable means of cognition, we mustbe able to examine these reliable means of cognition themselves and find nocontradiction, yet we are not able to. Instead, what we find is that thereliable means of cognition, the object of evaluation, and the rest of thesixteen topics that logicians conceive of are themselves unreasonable.” Hence,we find the statement:> So that those intent on dispute,> Priding themselves in their expertise in logic,> May give up this pride,> I shall explain this detailed examination.28 The treatise then proceeds to examine in detail, and consequently refute,reliable means of cognition, objects of evaluation, and the other principlesthat are appealed to in order to prove that things have their own nature.Establishing Conventions replies to the objection that, in the absence ofnature, the categories of the conventional would be as unreasonable as donkeyhorns and the like. In response it is taught: “While devoid of nature, it isfeasible for fabrications to arise interdependently. For this reason, thecategories of convention are indeed totally reasonable.”Some scholars of times past considered the Jewel Garland part of this sixfoldcollection. Others claim that there is no definitive sixfold enumeration andthat instead we should simply speak of the “collection” or “compilation” ofreasoning. Still more assert that five treatises constitute the Collection ofReasoning that demonstrates the absence of nature. The presentation given hereshould serve to dispense with all of these claims. Furthermore, this approach isaddressed in the Commentary on the Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning. 29 Explaining whyan initial homage is included in the Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning but not intreatises such as the Rebuttal of Objections, this text states that the formeris a primary treatise, as is the Fundamental Insight, whereas the remaining[four texts] are appendices. Thus, the Commentary on the Sixty Stanzas ofReasoning clearly demonstrates the relationships between the treatises explainedhere.Works on Secret MantraThe second group includes the Five Stages and other works that explain theVehicle of Secret Mantra.Demonstration of Single MeaningThird we have the Commentary on the Enlightened Mind, a work that shows theCausal and Resultant Vehicles to be identical in meaning. This can be understoodfrom the fact that this commentary explains a portion of the Guhyasamāja RootTantra in which Vairocana proclaims the greatness of the ultimate mind ofenlightenment in terms of the Vehicle of Characteristics.The Root of the Middle WayThird, we shall discuss the nature of the treatise. This section identifies: (1)the meaning of the treatise’s title, (2) the categories to which it belongs, and(3) the body of the treatise itself.The TitleThe treatise bears the title:Insight—The Stanzas of the Root of the Middle Way.The first topic includes the following divisions: (1) an explanation of thewords in the title, (2) the reasons for giving the treatise this title, and (3)the purpose that it serves. Concerning the first of these, the term “middle way”is derived from the Sanskrit word madhyama, signifying that which is beyond allextremes. “Root” is a translation of the word mūla. This indicates that the fullsignificance of the Middle Way, the topic under discussion, is contained in thistreatise. “Insight” is a translation of the term prajñā. This indicates that bystudying and reflecting on this treatise one will develop a flawless insightinto the two truths, free from the extremes of one-sided existence andnonexistence. “Stanzas” derives from the word kārikā, showing that the treatiseis written in verse. The dash in the title renders the word nāma, which showsthat the preceding word is a name.Concerning the second topic, the title is given in consideration of thetreatise’s subject matter, the expressions it employs, and its function.Third, we have the purpose of the title, which is fourfold: (1) Generallyspeaking, the significance of a text can be seen to be essentially contained inits title, and so the title can make one aware of the way one should relate tothe text. (2) More specifically, a title concerns a text’s subject matter,expressions, and function. That is to say, for those of the sharpest faculties,simply hearing the title will engender knowledge of the text’s content, theexpressions it employs, as well as its function. (3) Stating the title at theoutset serves to minimize hardship for the reader. (4) Finally, rendering thetitle in Sanskrit serves to create a karmic affinity with this language andestablish the pure origins of the Buddha’s teachings. It also serves todemonstrate the lotsāwas’ and paṇḍitas’ expertise in accurate translation.Furthermore, one will come to understand what it was that these lotsāwas andpaṇḍitas did, thus inspiring one to repay their kindness. Of these fourpurposes, the first two concern what was written by the author and the lattertwo what was written by the lotsā was and paṇḍitas.CategorizationThis second section addresses the various categories to which the treatisebelongs. As explained earlier, in terms of scripture, of the words of the Buddhaand treatises, the Root of the Middle Way is categorized as a treatise.Furthermore, among treatises this work clarifies the explicit statements of thesūtras that belong to the intermediate teachings, those on the absence ofcharacteristics. It thus explains the focal point of the view. In terms ofimport, of the Great and Lesser Vehicles, it pertains to the former. Within theGreat Vehicle, moreover, it relates to the Causal Vehicle of Characteristics andTranscendent Insight. In terms of genre, of the Three Collections, it is part ofthe Abhidharma Collection, which primarily explains the training in superiorinsight.Aware of this, the lotsāwas and paṇḍitas who translated this work began theirtranslation by paying homage, in accordance with royal edict, to pacifyobstacles. Since the Root of the Middle Way reveals the essential reality thatis the final, core meaning of all the collections, homage is paid in a generalmanner to the three jewels. More specifically, because the Root of the MiddleWay conveys the insight that all phenomena are ultimately free from allconceptually constructed extremes, homage is paid to the deity of insight, nobleMañjuśrī. Further, because he is superior to others, homage is also paid to theauthor himself.The Body of the TreatiseThis third section addresses the body of the treatise. As has been taught: “Thebody, divided in chapters, has two aspects: word and meaning.” As shown here,the body of this treatise consists of both subject matter and the expressionsused to convey this subject matter. The subject matter of this work is dependentorigination free from the eight conceptually constructed extremes or, in otherwords, the two truths. The expressions used to communicate this subject matterare embodied in 449 stanzas that are divided into twenty-seven chapters.This completes the identification of the Dharma that is to be taught andlistened to.TEACHING AND STUDYING THE DHARMA The second section addresses how the Dharma should be taught and listened to.This includes two topics: (1) how the teacher should explain the Dharma and (2)how the student should listen.THE TEACHER The first of these concerns (1) the type of individual who is a suitable supportto offer Dharma teachings, (2) the various methods through which the teachingsmay be imparted, and (3) how to use these methods when giving a teaching.Regarding the first topic, it is said that for a teaching to be meaningful:> One must rely on a spiritual friend who is completely peaceful, at peace, and> gentle;> Who has superior qualities, diligence, and wealth of scriptural transmission;> Who has a thorough realization of reality and is eloquent;> Whose nature is loving and who has given up weariness.30 While it is taught that a spiritual friend must possess ten unique qualities, asmentioned above, there are three indispensable qualities one must have as aminimum. First, a spiritual friend must be learned, both in terms of the natureof the subject matter as well as the expressions used to communicate. Concerningthe former, a teacher must have a general knowledge of all the subjectsaddressed in the five fields and [Three] Collections. In particular, a teachermust be knowledgeable concerning the specific teaching he or she is giving. Onemust also be a skilled communicator. He or she must speak with a pleasant voiceand make the meaning clear and accessible. The explanation must also berelevant, reasonable, and of appropriate length. Second, in terms of conduct, aspiritual friend must avoid doing anything evil, and thus be capable ofeliciting faith in the listener. Self-reliant, he or she must in this way be fitto be taken as a guru. Third, teachers should be unconcerned with materialwealth and possess a loving heart. Without concern for fame, wealth, and honor,they must not lose heart when faced with the blatant ingratitude of those aroundthem.Second, there are three methods that can be used to teach: First, the subjectmatter is set forth by identifying the background of the teaching, its intendedpurpose, and its contents. Second, the means used to express this subject matterare explained by setting forth the topic through a gradual presentation of thebasic issues, by clarifying the words with reference to their distinctivefeatures, and by showing what is directly or indirectly implied by the words andsentence structures in their particular context. Third, one resolves the natureof the subject matter by means of objections and replies. Thus, one first setsforth objections, claiming that the meaning and the explanation of the text isflawed. Subsequently, one replies to these objections by showing how there is nosuch flaw and presenting arguments to this end.These methods are to be used during the teaching in three ways: In terms ofpurpose, they can be used to ascertain defining characteristics or explain theprocess of gaining experience in practice. With respect to those in need ofguidance, one may offer concise, moderate, or detailed explanations, dependingon whether the student is of sharp, mediocre, or dull faculties. In terms ofone’s own teaching process, explanations should be presented within theframework of a preparation, main part, and conclusion.THE STUDENTSecond we have the student. This discussion addresses (1) the type of individualwho is a [suitable] support for listening to the Dharma and (2) how such astudent should listen. Concerning the first, a great deal is taught in both thesūtras and treatises. However, for the process of listening to the Dharma to bemeaningful, the student must possess a minimum of three indispensable qualities:intelligence that facilitates realization, faith that engenders the wish topractice, and diligence in the form of untiring commitment. On this topic, it istaught:> To summarize their practice,> In brief, it is faith and insight.> With faith one follows the Dharma> And with insight one recognizes reality.31 Likewise:> When sincere, bright, and committed,> A listener is taught to be “a vessel.”32 Second, when receiving a teaching, the listener should think of himself orherself as a patient stricken with the disease of the afflictions. The teachershould be regarded as the doctor who is treating the disease, and the Dharma asthe medical treatment. Finally, one’s practice of the path should be viewed asthe process of recovery. Furthermore, having given rise to the mind ofenlightenment of the Great Vehicle as a preliminary step, in the main part ofthe session the student should listen carefully with an undistracted mind,regarding the Dharma and the teacher with respect. To conclude the session, heor she should dedicate the virtue that has been gathered to great enlightenment,yet without maintaining a reference point. In summary, the master Asaṛgaexplains:> There are five factors that cause the instructions to be internalized:> listening with the attitude of universal understanding, listening attentively,> concentrating on what is heard, summoning the mind back when distracted, and> listening with an attitude of veneration for the Dharma and teacher.33 THE RESULTS OF TEACHING AND LISTENING Third, regarding the results of these activities, generally speaking, the resultof listening and teaching the Dharma is that the insight of realizing thesubject matter will arise in the listener’s mind-stream. In particular, when theDharma is taught and listened to in the manner outlined above, this subjectmatter will be realized flawlessly and with ease.This completes the survey of how one should teach and listen to the Dharma.12.

This section contains three divisions: (1) the meaning of the openinglines, (2) the meaning of the main body of the treatise, and (3) the meaning ofthe postscript.THE MEANING OF THE OPENING LINESThe treatise opens with two stanzas of homage:> That which originates dependently> Does not cease and does not arise,> Does not come and does not go,> Is not annihilated and is not permanent, > Is not different and not the same.> To the true teacher who reveals this peace,> The complete pacification of constructs,> To the perfect Buddha I bow down. These verses can be explained in two ways: either in terms of their explicit orimplicit meaning. Here, we will take the first approach and explain theirexplicit meaning. Since this statement pays homage to the precious teacher, wewill (1) consider the purpose of paying homage to the teacher at the outset ofthe treatise, (2) provide a summary of the text, and (3) elaborate on themeaning of its words.THE PURPOSE OF THE HOMAGE The rational purpose of paying homage is threefold. One general aspect concernshomage to something extraordinary; another relates to beginning the compositionof a treatise; and a third relates to the homage being entered into the text. Asfor the first, when one feels inspired and pays homage to the Teacher, one takeshold of the cause of enlightenment because this brings an end to negativity andobscurations and allows one to gain merit. Regarding the second purpose, bypaying homage the author will obtain merit and pacify conflicting factors.Through this, any outer or inner obstacles that may hinder the composition’scompletion will be thoroughly pacified and the author will abide by the conductof holy beings. The third purpose relates to the welfare of others, and here again there arethree aspects: First, judging by the way he or she engages in the conduct of aholy being, the author can be seen to be a holy person himself or herself.Understanding this, others will take an interest in the treatise that iscomposed. Secondly, the fact that the author begins by paying homage to his orher chosen deity makes it apparent that the treatise itself has a sublimepurpose. Again, understanding this will cause others to take an interest in hisor her text. Finally, when those who teach or study the treatise first engagethe homage, they will be able to bring the process [of teaching or study] tocompletion. The homage also provides a valuable example to others, such thatthey will first pay homage to the Jewels before writing a treatise or commencingany other work or project. Furthermore, those who see, chant, or otherwiseconcern themselves with the homage will thereby acquire merit. Thus, the homageis a way of caring for disciples.These points are identical with the Master’s34 own teaching on the purpose ofthe focal points. In his tīka on the great dependent origination, he writes:> When the author of a treatise pays homage> To the Teacher, it is not in vain.> It arouses respect for the treatise and the Teacher;> It is not for any other purpose. SUMMARY The summary concerns who pays homage to what, and in which way. The one who payshomage is the author of the present work. For Buddhists, the objects of homageare generally the Three Jewels. The Three Jewels are worthy of both homage andof being taken as a source of refuge. Here, homage is paid to the foremost ofall that are suited to be taken as a source of refuge—the perfect Buddha. Thehomage is made through praise and prostration; it is an offering of venerationwithout any hope for material acquisitions, reverence, and the like.THE WORDS OF THE HOMAGE Taking the word “prostration” as a basis for making distinctions, we can againconsider the words of the homage in terms of (1) who prostrates, (2) to what,and (3) how. The one who is prostrating we can understand from the line thatreads “I,” that is, the master N﻿āg﻿ārjuna, “bow down.” The second issue weshall explore with reference to the Buddha’s essence, superiority, and thereasons for this superiority. Concerning the first, as explained above, herehomage is being paid to the “perfect Buddha,” foremost among the Jewels that aresuitable to be taken as sources of refuge. The word “buddha” denotes anawakening from the sleep of ignorance, as well as an opening of the eye ofwisdom with respect to the objects of cognition. Hence, it refers to thepossession of the qualities of abandonment and realization. The word “perfect”indicates that the Buddha dwells on the eleventh ground of UniversalIllumination and is superior to the listeners, self-realized buddhas, and allothers who have not yet perfected the qualities of abandonment and realization.In terms of the second topic, the Buddha’s distinct superiority is referred towith the words “the true teacher … the perfect Buddha.” The Buddha is referredto as a “teacher” because he reveals to others what he himself has realized.Moreover, he is also the “true teacher,” insofar as his teachings possess sevensuperior features that distinguish them from those of mundane, non-Buddhist, andother Buddhist teachers. These seven are as follows: (1) they are motivated bycompassion; (2) they are melodious and gentle in essence; (3) the meaning theyexpress is the truth; (4) they propel one to the fruition; (5) they are in tunewith those in need of guidance; (6) they are timely; and (7) they are able todecisively answer everyone’s questions. Therefore, some also explain this tomean that the Buddha is a “Lion among Teachers,” “Moon among Teachers,” “Leaderof Teachers,” and “King of Teachers.”Concerning the third topic, it is the teaching of dependent origination thatmakes the Buddha the true teacher. To ascertain the meaning of this statement,we shall consider (1) the nature of this teaching, that is, dependentorigination, (2) how this teaching makes him the true teacher, and (3) thepurpose of this teaching.The first of these contains three further divisions: (1) the basis fordistinctions, (2) the distinctive qualities of dependent origination, and (3) aconsideration of the difference between the basis and its qualities.Basis for DistinctionsAs for the first, the basis for distinctions is what we refer to as “dependentorigination.” This can be ascertained by considering (1) the literal meaning ofthe term “dependent origination” and (2) what this term refers to.Pratītyasamutp﻿ādaThe term “dependent origination” is a translation of the Sanskrit wordPratītyasamutp﻿āda. Let us consider each of the five elements contained in thisword. Prati has the sense of contact, dependence, and reliance, while i or i﻿ṇdenotes going, departure, or destruction. Generally, the connective ya syllablecarries the meaning of an indeclinable or the absolutive, “having.” In thisparticular case iti, which has the sense of the verbal root, or the so-calleddh﻿ātu, is governed by the prepositional affix prati, yielding pratītya, Hence,what is implied is an encounter with causes and conditions, or a dependence andreliance on causes and conditions.Sam can be seen to provide the affix for samyak, and so mean “authentically.”Others, however, hold that this syllable supplies the affix for sambandha, thusexpressing the idea of relation. This latter explanation is the better of thetwo.There is no difference in meaning with respect to ud. P﻿āda generally means“stage” or “foot,” yet because of the prefix samud, it comes to mean“origination.” Hence, samutp﻿āda becomes “origination in relation.” Together,Pratītyasamutp﻿āda then means “origination that has encountered, and is relatedto, causes and conditions” or “origination that is related to, and dependent on,causes and conditions.” In this way, the term can be seen to exclude that whichnever occurs, that which occurs without causes and conditions, and that whichoccurs with an indefinite causal relationship.What Does “Dependent Origination” Refer To?Second, regarding the referent of the term “dependent origination,” we shallidentify (1) its defining characteristic and (2) the bearers of thatcharacteristic. “Dependent origination” is a term that is explicable to the sameextent that it is applied. Therefore, the defining characteristic of dependentorigination is, as discussed above, “that which originates in dependence oncauses and conditions.” Some understand this in terms of causes and conditionsgiving rise to particularly characterized entities. Thus, they teach that thoseentities that are grouped into the five aggregates are the bearers of thecharacteristic of dependent origination. Here, however, origination independence on causes and conditions is held to be a mere appearance. Therefore,the bases that possess this characteristic include all cognizable phenomena. Asūtra teaches:> Aside from the dependently originated, a bodhisattva does not see any> phenomena whatsoever. And:> The wise realize that phenomena are dependently originated,> And so do not adhere to extreme views in any way.> The cognized are phenomena with causes and conditions;> There is no cognition of any phenomenon without causes and conditions.35 While this treatise states:> Apart from what originates dependently,> There are no phenomena at all.36 Similarly, it is taught:> Nowhere does there ever exist> Anything at all that is not dependent. The Qualities of Dependent OriginationSecond, the distinctive qualities of dependent origination are not positiveproperties. Instead, there are eight distinctive negative qualities, such as theabsence of cessation. We shall examine these by (1) identifying the essence ofeach of these eight, (2) contemplating the way in which these qualities aredefinitively numbered, and (3) deflecting any critique that their sequence isunreasonable.The Essence of the Eight Distinctive QualitiesAll negative qualities depend on an identification of that which is negated.Thus, in the present context, the negated quality of cessation is notestablished as an agent or object. Rather, here cessation means “to cease,” thatis, the action that is the momentary cessation of a substance. Likewise, arisingmeans “to arise,” that is, the coming into being of something that previouslywas not. Annihilation means “to be annihilated,” that is, the annihilation of anentity’s continuity.Permanence is as stated in the verses:> That which has a nature that never ceases> Is what the wise refer to as permanent.37 Hence, something permanent remains immutable; it is a substance that neitherdisintegrates momentarily nor does so in terms of having a continuity [thatcomes to an end]. Coming means “to come,” the approach of something from adistant location, while going is the departure of something nearby to a locationfarther away. Difference does not imply different conceptual distinctions or themere negation of sameness. Instead, it means difference in terms of essence orthe difference between [distinct] entities. Sameness does not refer to thesameness of conceptual distinctions, but again, to sameness in terms of essenceor entities that are the same and not different.Are the eight conceptually constructed extremes, which are negated in relationto the basis of negation (that is dependent origination), ultimatelynonexistent, or are they nonexistent even conventionally? Some explainpermanence and annihilation to be nonexistent even conventionally, whereas therest are ultimately nonexistent. Nevertheless, arising, cessation, and so forthare dreamlike and illusory. They are merely apparent from the perspective of thedeluded mind. Particular characteristics, such as those that the Middle WayAutonomists believe in, do not even exist conventionally. The appearance ofarising, cessation, and so forth, meanwhile, should be understood to beultimately nonexistent.It could then be argued: “It may indeed be the case that no negandum, in theform of true arising, cessation, and so forth, is established, but is there, oris there not, a presence of the qualities of their mere negation? If there is,it follows that these negative conceptual constructs are ultimately established.Yet if not, dependent origination will be established to have qualities such astrue arising and cessation.”Let us examine and reply to this concern: First, it is taught:> Here the intent is to negate existence,> Not to prove nonexistence.38 And:> Since there is nothing to negate,> It is clear that in reality nothing is negated.39 Thus, not only are there ultimately no conceptual constructs to be negated, eventhe qualities of their negation are not established. Since, moreover, thequalities that negate true arising, cessation, and so forth are presentrelatively, we are free from both of the aforementioned inconsistencies. Theultimate freedom from all negative and positive constructs is termed “thenatural absence of arising” and “the uncategorized ultimate.” The mere negationof true arising, cessation, and so forth that is relevant in the context of therelative is conventionally termed “absence of arising qua negation” and “thecategorized ultimate.” Concerning the latter, it is taught:> Since the negation of arising and so on> Accords with reality, it too is accepted.40 The Enumeration of Distinctive QualitiesSecond, the eight negative distinctive qualities presented here are merelyrepresentative; they are not an exhaustive enumeration. Thus, the Commentary41explains, “These alone are the primary bases of dispute.” Some take this to meanthat because the features of these eight objects of negation are readilyapparent, the fixation toward them is intense. That, then, is why these eightnegated qualities are the bases of dispute. Others claim that the first two aremisconceptions held by our own tradition and the second two by other traditions,while the final four are commonly held worldly notions. This, they say, is whythese eight negative distinctive qualities are specifically mentioned.Is the Sequence of the Qualities Unreasonable?Third, it may be thought that since cessation follows arising, it would makemore sense to mention arising first. However, although arising does indeedprecede cessation, the arising of an effect must be preceded by the cessation ofits cause. Hence, the point here is that there is no definite sequence withrespect to arising and cessation and, therefore, this presentation is notproblematic. As is explained:> If birth came first> And aging and death followed later,> There would be birth without aging and death,> As well as birth without anyone having died.42 Distinguishing between the Basis and Its QualitiesThird, the natural absence of arising, or the uncategorized ultimate, which wasmentioned earlier, and the subject, dependent origination, cannot be said to bethe same or different in essence. The absence of arising as a negation, or thecategorized ultimate, is in essence the same [as dependent origination], yet adifferent conceptual distinction.How This Teaching Makes the Buddha the True TeacherSecond, dependent origination free from the eight conceptually constructedextremes is the structure that permeates all objects of cognition. Therefore,this teaching is an expression of the truth. Just as a lion’s roar overwhelmsdeer, the Buddha’s teaching dispels the notions of permanence, annihilation, andother inferior views, and so vanquishes those in need of guidance who harbormisguided ideas. Likewise, as this teaching serves as a remedy for the stuporthat lies at the root of all shortcomings, he provides for those in need ofguidance who lack realization. Finally, this dependent origination is taughtexclusively by the Thus-Gone One, who realizes it in all its aspects withindividual self-awareness. As is taught:> The Knower of the World, without having heard this from others,> Teaches by means of these very two truths. And:> Who could teach me, one with peerless great wisdom?> Because without any teacher he teaches Dharmas in the best way,> The Thus-Gone is the teacher of gods and humans. The Purpose of the TeachingThird, dependent origination is taught for the sake of “peace, the completepacification of constructs.” Hence, the direct purpose of this teaching is toelicit a precise realization in those in need of guidance through the insightthat arises from study. Having applied the insight born of reflection toascertain the meaning of what one has studied, one can then familiarize oneselfwith that meaning over an extended period. The following passage highlights theeffects of this process:> Therefore, whether real or unreal,> Whatever is an object of intense meditation> Will, once the meditation has been perfected,> Be cognized clearly and nonconceptually.43 Hence, while resting in equipoise, insight without appearance allows one todirectly perceive, by way of not seeing anything at all, the intrinsic nature ofdependent origination—an existential negation that is ultimate freedom from theeight constructed extremes. Likewise, by means of the pure, subsequentlyattained wakefulness that involves appearance, one perceives the subject,illusion-like dependent origination, directly and precisely. This is apredicative negation, which is again free from the eight conceptuallyconstructed extremes. Through this, the apprehension of true marks with respectto consciousness and its objects, expressions and their meanings, and so forthis completely pacified and the causal wakefulness of the ten grounds isattained. This is the temporary purpose of teaching dependent origination.From the perspective of such a mind, dependent origination is, by nature,present as the complete pacification of mentally constructed reality. Therefore,dependent origination is itself referred to as “the complete pacification ofmental constructs.”By continuing this process of familiarization through the tenth ground, causalignorance, along with the habitual tendencies, will eventually be eliminated.This results in the attainment of the ground of Buddhahood, where even theconsciousness that is deluded with respect to the appearing object withdraws.Hence, even the activity of the supportive mind and its mental states vanishes.The withdrawal of all activity associated with consciousness and its objectscompletely pacifies birth, aging, sickness, death, and all other such resultantfactors. Thus, the Buddha body of qualities is attained. This is the ultimatepurpose of the teaching on dependent origination.From the perspective of such a mind, dependent origination itself remains thenatural pacification of even the marks of appearance. Thus, dependentorigination is itself also referred to as “peace.” This has, for example, beentaught as follows:> These are deluded appearances,> Like those experienced in a dream.> When awoken from the dark sleep of ignorance,> None of the features of cyclic existence are observed.> Hence, when the mind does not arise> In regard to anything at all, that is Buddhahood. Thus, the fact that the Buddha has actively taught dependent origination impliesa compassionate motivation, a compassionate intent. These two factors, intentand action, explain the perfect benefit for others. The abandonments andrealizations described above explain the perfect benefit for oneself.How Homage Is PaidThe third topic concerns how homage is paid. The expression “I bow down” impliesan act of physical, verbal, and mental veneration. Another way of explaining thehomage is to say that the energy, or force, of the words encapsulates thetreatise’s four related elements. This can be appreciated by considering (1) thepurpose of stating the four related elements at the beginning of the treatise,(2) a summary of the four, and (3) the words and their meaning.The Purpose of the Four ElementsAs for the first, some say that the four elements play a rhetorical role, inthat they enhance the aesthetic value of a treatise. Others claim that statingthe four aspects is a means for countering the mistaken idea that, like anexamination of crow teeth, the given treatise serves no purpose and should nothave been composed. These explanations are not reasonable because both fail toexplain why these related elements are definitively numbered at four. Likewise,discerning individuals are not interested in superficially attractiveappearances. On the other hand, when it is said that “this treatise is endowedwith the four related elements,” discerning and faithful followers of the Dharmawill respond. Those who readily trust will think that the treatise is,therefore, definitely endowed with the four aspects, while those who do not willthink that this is likely to be the case. The latter will thus engage thetreatise based on the arising of meaningful doubt. As is said:> The related and the appropriate methods,> The words that express what is meaningful for humanity,> Are taken possession of by those who thoroughly discern;> They are not the possession of anyone else.44 Likewise:> So that hearing a sūtra’s magnificent meaning> Can lead to its being comprehended and upheld> Through the listeners’ veneration> The purpose should be explained in the beginning.45 In order to show that this account is above reproach, we may consider thefollowing objections. First, it may be argued that these statements concerningthe related elements are unable to produce any certainty about their meaningbecause the words and their meaning are unrelated, as is the case with the wordsof a liar. Second, it may likewise be objected that words are not necessary toproduce doubt since it is through the receding of a reliable means of cognitionof an examined meaning that one comes to doubt. To this, we reply that althoughthe words are not able to engender the certainty of reliable means of cognition,this does not mean that certainty as such cannot arise. Moreover, while wordsare not necessary for the production of doubt, the author’s speech is requiredfor the arising of this particular doubt, which takes the form of thinking “thefour aspects of the related purpose are quite likely to be present.” Hence,there are no such flaws at all.Summary of the Four Related ElementsThis summary includes (1) an identification of the four related elements ascontained in the meaning of the opening statement, (2) a consideration of themanner in which this statement presents these four, and (3) a contemplation ofthe reasons why the elements are definitively numbered at four.First, a treatise’s four related elements are its (1) subject matter, (2)purpose, (3) inner purpose, and (4) relationship. In general, these four referrespectively to (1) that which the text is primarily meant to resolve, (2) therealization of that through reading and listening to the text, (3) the essentialpurpose that eventually ensues from this realization, and (4) how realizationrelies and depends on the treatise. In terms of this particular treatise, thesefour are (1) dependent origination free from the eight constructed extremes, (2)realization of that by means of this scripture alone, (3) the temporaryattainment of the ten grounds and the final attainment of Buddhahood that comeabout through cultivating this realization, and (4) how the purpose,realization, depends on this treatise.The Presentation of the Four Related ElementsSecond, the subject matter is covered in the lines that end with the words “andnot the same.” The phrase “who reveals” indicates the purpose, meaning therealization that results from the teaching, while the words “this peace, thecomplete pacification of constructs” present the essential purpose. Therelationship is as taught in the following verses:> There may indeed not be any words> That directly show the relationship.> Nevertheless, by discerning … Hence, the relationship between this treatise and its purpose is implicit in itswords. Moreover, all four of these elements are implicitly stated in the praiseto the Teacher.Some say that the phrase “the complete pacification of constructs” is meant toexplain the specific subject matter, whereas the phrase “who reveals this peace”shows how this subject matter is presented. The phrase “to the perfect Buddha,”they assert, is a presentation of the essential purpose.Definitive EnumerationThird, since this treatise possesses countless positive qualities, why is thisfourfold purpose and relationship alone presented as the definitive enumeration?The reason is that only these four are suited to serve the purpose of the statedhomage. As already explained, the purpose of this statement is to provide themeans whereby discerning individuals can access this treatise, and there are,moreover, four thoughts that are sure to prevent discerning individuals fromaccessing it. Any fifth such thought is impossible. Hence, to avert theseobstructive ideas anything less than the four aspects would be insufficient, andanything more would be superfluous.It is possible for one of the following four thoughts to manifest: First,reasonable individuals may think that there is no special purpose to access thistreatise, just as though the topic of the treatise were an investigation of crowteeth. Second, they may think that although there may indeed be such a purpose,it may not be a desirable one, as would be the case with a teaching on how toget married. Third, it may be thought that although there is a special purposethat is also desirable, it might not be achievable by relying on the treatise inquestion, as in the example of the jewel ornament instructions.46 Finally,although this purpose may be achievable, one may think that perhaps there is aneasier way to accomplish it without any connection to this particular treatise.Respectively, these four thoughts are averted by stating the purpose’s essence,the essential purpose, the subject matter, and the relationship. Thereby, itwill be understood that the treatise does have a special purpose, that thispurpose is desirable, that it can be achieved by means of this particulartreatise, and that this achievement is strongly related to it. Thus, since adiscerning individual will engage this treatise through these factors alone,there is no fifth obstructive thought that is sure to hinder access to a giventreatise.The meaning of the words of the homage was already explained above.THE MEANING OF THE MAIN PART OF THE TREATISE We shall now turn to the significance of the composition that concerns us here.To explain the meaning of this profound teaching, we must (1) ascertain themeaning of the chapters and (2) explain the progression of the text.ASCERTAINING THE MEANING OF THE CHAPTERS The first of these involves (1) contextualizing the chapters and (2)ascertaining their subject matter, the nature of the two truths. The firstincludes (1) explanations of the general context of the chapters and (2) theirspecific contexts.The General Context of the ChaptersFirst, one may wonder what particular meaning is conveyed by the twenty-sevenchapters in this text. What is taught here is the two truths, or alternatively,dependent origination empty of all mental constructions of ultimate truth, alongwith the results of realization. Hence, the chapters explain what was presentedin the homage, as well as the subject matter of all the precious sūtras.There are three issues here: (1) the distinctive qualities of dependentorigination, (2) the basis for these qualities—dependent origination itself, and(3) the result of realizing [the nature of] dependent origination, that whichpossesses these distinctive qualities. The first topic is subdivided into (1)the primary distinctive qualities of dependent origination, (2) its subsidiarydistinct qualities, and (3) immunity to the charge of absurdity.The Distinctive Qualities of Dependent OriginationAs for the first, the primary distinctive qualities of dependent origination arethe absence of cessation and the rest of the eight factors mentioned above.These eight serve to remedy the primary misconceptions commonly held in thetreatises and worldly life. Hence, when arising, going, and coming areexplicitly negated, cessation and the remaining five will be implicitly negatedas well. This is what takes place in the analysis of conditions and analysis ofgoing and coming.The subsidiary distinctive qualities are treated in five sections. The firstgroup of six chapters shows dependent origination to be devoid of the nature ofthe aggregates, elements, and sense sources, and thus empty of the self ofphenomena. The analysis of the sense sources, analysis of the aggregates, andanalysis of the elements refute the natural establishment of the essence ofthese factors, while the analysis of desire and the desirous one, analysis ofthe characteristics of the conditioned, and analysis of action and agent refutethe arguments advanced to prove this natural establishment. To elaborate, theanalysis of desire and the desirous one refutes the natural establishment of theafflicted subject; the analysis of the characteristics of the conditionedrefutes the arising, remaining, and destruction that characterize theaggregates, elements, and sense sources as conditioned; and the analysis ofaction and agent refutes action and its agent being the cause of these factors.The second group consists of four chapters. These show that dependentorigination is empty of a self in the form of a person that appropriates theaggregates. Analysis of prior existence refutes the natural establishment of theessence of an individual, whereas the analysis of fire and fuel, analysis ofbeginnings and ends, and analysis of suffering refute the arguments advanced toprove the natural existence of such a personal self. The analysis of fire andfuel refutes the example of fire and fuel, the analysis of beginnings and endsrefutes the notion that the cyclic existence of birth, aging, and death is theactivity of the person, and the analysis of suffering refutes the idea thatnaturally existent suffering is supported by the person.Without differentiating the person and phenomena, the third group of sixchapters explains how dependent origination is empty of the nature of merethings. The analysis of the conditioned refutes any natural establishment of theessence of things as such, without differentiating between the person andphenomena. The analysis of contact, analysis of nature, analysis of bondage andliberation, and analysis of action and its results disprove the argumentsadvanced to prove this natural establishment. In other words, the naturalestablishment of contact, of the causes and conditions of appropriation, and soforth of cyclic existence, and of action and its results (as that which provesthe latter) are all refuted. Finally, the analysis of self and phenomenapresents, as a mere convention, the Middle Way’s own account of the real natureof things.The fourth group of three chapters shows dependent origination to be empty ofthe nature of time. The analysis of time refutes the natural existence of theessence of the three times, whereas the analysis of the assembly and theanalysis of arising and disintegration refute the arguments advanced to provethis form of existence. More specifically, the analysis of the assembly refutesthe notion that time is a cooperating condition in the production of externaland internal effects, while the analysis of arising and disintegration disprovesthe idea that time is the cause of these two events.The fifth group of two chapters demonstrates how dependent origination is emptyof the nature of the continuum of existence. The analysis of the Thus-Gonedisproves that the Thus-Gone is naturally established as the result of thecontinuum of existence, whereas the analysis of error disproves that afflictionis naturally established as its cause.This presentation of the distinctive qualities of dependent origination asnatural emptiness may be taken to involve absurd consequences. Hence, there aretwo chapters that dispense with such charges. First, it may be argued: “If allphenomena are emptiness, it would render all the topics that are presented inthe scriptures nonexistent. This would include the four noble truths, the fourtypes of subjective wakefulness, the resultant Three Jewels, the causes andeffects of actions, and so forth. Moreover, it would also turn all mundaneconventions into nothing.”In response, the analysis of the noble truths states: “We do indeed accept theconsequence that all of these have no nature. However, dependent origination isstill feasible as a conventional principle in light of this position on theabsence of nature. Hence, all of these are perfectly feasible as conventionalprinciples.” Thus, this reply is given in terms of the relative.Second, it may be objected: “If all phenomena were emptiness, it would not bepossible to eliminate the causal afflictions by means of the path that remediesthem, nor would it be possible to thereby bring an end to the continuum of theresultant aggregates and achieve the transcendence of suffering with or withoutremainder.”In response, the analysis of the transcendence of suffering states: “For us, thetranscendence of suffering refers to the absence of the nature of suffering andits causes within the real condition of things. We do indeed accept theconsequence that there is no transcendence of suffering to be attained by usingremedies to eliminate previously existing causal afflictions and resultantaggregates.” Hence, this reply is given in terms of the ultimate.These twenty-five chapters show how the distinctive qualities of dependentorigination are, in fact, natural emptiness. These chapters are followed by theanalysis of dependent origination, which presents the basis for thesedistinctions, namely, the dependent origination of affliction and purification.Finally, the analysis of views explains how one will relinquish all views andultimately achieve the nonabiding transcendence of suffering as the result ofrealizing this distinctive dependent origination.The particular contexts of the chapters are discussed elsewhere.47The Two TruthsThis second section deals with the subject matter of these chapters, the natureof the two truths. Ascertaining this nature involves (1) setting forth thecharacteristics of each of the two truths, (2) identifying the bearers of thesecharacteristics, and (3) presenting the means for validly cognizing the presenceof the characteristics upon their bearers.Concerning the first, it is taught:> The object of genuine seeing is the ultimate.> False perception is taught to be relative truth.48 As stated here, the relative truth is characterized by being true as the objectof conventional, deluded consciousness. Regarding the ultimate truth, any mentalexamination of its nature will fail to find any established characteristics andso on. We may, however, employ superimpositions as mere conventions to explainthe defining characteristic of the ultimate truth to be that which is true inbeing the object of a mind free from delusion. In other words, it is that whichis true from the perspective of either the nonconceptual wakefulness of thenoble ones’ equipoise or the final consciousness that has employed reasoning toexamine the nature of reality using the three modes as proof.The Bearers of the Relative Truth’s Defining CharacteristicConcerning the second issue, it is taught:> The ultimate is not an object of the mind;> Mind is held to be relative.49 As mentioned here, all objects of a mind that involves appearance, the entirerange of cognizable phenomena, are bearers of the defining characteristics ofthe relative truth. There are two kinds of relative truth: the mundane relativetruth and the relative truth of noble beings. The first includes all delusionscreated by afflictive ignorance, whatever is established as an object of thedeluded mind of an ordinary immature individual. The second consists of all thedelusions created by nonafflictive ignorance. This refers to all that isestablished as a deluded object to the appearance-based minds of the noblebeings of the three classes during their subsequent attainments.The mundane relative truth can itself be divided into two categories: theauthentic and mistaken. The authentic relative truth consists of that which istrue in the sense of being accepted by the world as an object of a mind that isnot deluded about the object it apprehends. Mistaken relative truth, on theother hand, consists of that which is true in the sense of being accepted as theobject of a mind that is deluded about its apprehended object.The distinction between a mundane consciousness that is deluded and one that isnot is as follows. Mundane nondelusion includes both self-awareness, theinward-directed consciousness that experiences its own essence, as well as theoutward-directed consciousness that is aware of other. With the latter,consciousness must be mediated by unimpaired faculties, which is to say that anyfactors that cause the six sense faculties to misapprehend their respectiveobjects must be absent. Such factors may be associated with the internalfaculties and immediately [preceding conditions], with the external objects, orotherwise. An example of that which is classified as an undeluded consciousnesswould be the perception of a single moon in the sky. Whenever the mind isinfluenced by factors that cause the sense consciousnesses to engage theirobjects in a distorted manner, as when two moons are perceived, thatconsciousness is considered mistaken. On this point, it is taught:> False perception, moreover, is of two kinds:> Some have keen faculties while those of others are impaired.> The consciousness of one with impaired faculties is considered mistaken> Relative to the consciousness of one whose faculties are sound.50 Therefore, the authentic relative truth includes two types of entity. The firstcategory consists of inner mental entities, the primary minds and subsidiarymental states that are the objects of inward-directed self-awareness. The secondincludes external objective entities, the forms and other objects that arecognized by the outward-directed six sense consciousnesses when unimpaired.The mistaken relative is also of two types. Nonconceptual deluded observationsare objects of the six sense consciousnesses when the latter are in a deludedstate. An example of this is the appearance of a double moon. The second typeincludes conceptually apprehended features of object universals, such as thoseassociated with the self or the primary principle. Hence, it is taught:> That which the world realizes by apprehending it> Through the six sense faculties when unimpaired> Is true from the perspective of the world itself.> The rest is classified, according to the world itself, as mistaken.51 Moreover, according to this twofold division of the mistaken relative, it istaught:> That which the extremists conceive of,> Heavily disturbed in their sleep of ignorance,> And that which is thought of as illusion, visual distortion, and so forth,> Do not even exist from the perspective of the world.52 Therefore, the mind that involves appearance may be divided in terms of thepresence and absence of delusion, while its objects may be classified as eithertrue or false. Yet, since these divisions are known among worldly, childish,ordinary individuals, they belong to the relative truth of such individuals.There is also the so-called relative truth of the noble ones. This includeswhatever may appear during the subsequent [attainment] of the three types ofnoble beings, their appearance-based minds’ perception of the way the relativetruly is. In the subsequent attainment, the noble ones see everything to befalse, like a dream or illusion, and experience it all as one taste, appearing,yet devoid of nature. Since there is no distinction between true and false, orauthentic and mistaken, this is also referred to as the “mere relative.”Furthermore, the followers of the Middle Way hold that, in terms of the realnature of things, all objects of a mind that involves appearance are false andall minds are deluded. For this reason, this is also spoken of as the “relativefor followers of the Middle Way.” As is taught:> In being bewilderment, an obscuration of the natural, it is relative.> That which is made to appear real thereby> The Able One has termed “relative truth.”> Thus, fabricated entities belong to the relative.53 This completes the explanation of the bearers of the characteristic of therelative and their respective divisions.The Bearers of the Ultimate Truth’s Defining CharacteristicSecond, as for the bearers of the defining characteristic of the ultimate truth,it is taught:> When these apparent entities> Are analyzed by reasoning, nothing is found.> That lack of finding is itself the ultimate,> The intrinsic nature that is primordially present.54 As stated here, all that appears is unestablished, both from the perspective ofthe nonconceptual wakefulness of a noble one’s equipoise, as well as from theviewpoint of a consciousness that has employed reason to analyze andinvestigate. The appearances themselves are neither existent nor nonexistent,neither true nor false. They entirely lack any essential establishment, such asbeing an object of cognition, expression, or evaluation. They are, hence, beyondall conceptual constructs. The conventional term “ultimate truth” is applied inconsideration of this alone. Therefore, the explanation of the ultimate issimilar to saying that the real condition of the visual distortions experiencedby a person suffering from a phlegm disorder is simply the way such distortionsare from the perspective of somebody with healthy eyesight, someone to whosemind the distortions would not in any way be established as objects. As istaught:> A person may imagine hair tufts and other such things due to a visual> disorder,> Though, in essence, they are errors. > As their nature would be seen by one with healthy sight,> Here, that is how reality should be known.55 How the Two Truths Are KnownThird is the reliable means of cognizing the characteristics of the two truths.One may argue: “It may be the case that mere objects of cognition are thebearers of the aforementioned characteristics of the relative truth. Likewise,it may be the case that the characteristics of the ultimate truth that werediscussed earlier pertain to bearers that are free from mental construction andbeyond being cognizable phenomena. But what reliable means of cognition, or whattype of mind, would then be able to ascertain that this is the case?”In response, we shall (1) identify the mind, or reliable means of cognition,that ascertains the characteristics of the two truths and (2) show how this mindascertains them. The first of these involves (1) refuting the positions ofothers and (2) setting forth our own position.Refuting the Positions of OthersFirst, the Middle Way Autonomists say that the defining characteristics of thetwo truths are ascertained by a reliable means of cognition brought aboutthrough the power of facts agreed upon by both parties in a debate. In otherwords, they claim that the ascertaining reliable means of cognition apprehendsin a way that is not deluded. This account, however, is untenable. Generallyspeaking, reliable means of cognition by the power of fact can be refuted byshowing its untenability in terms of the meaning of the term “reliable means ofcognition,” the defining characteristics of reliable means of cognition, and theprocess of ascertainment. In particular, the principle of reliable means ofcognition by the power of fact is disproved because direct perception,inference, scripture, and analogy become untenable when conceived of in terms ofthat paradigm. These refutations are discussed at length in The EssentialReality of the Middle Way. 56Others take a different position, basing their view on the following statement:> If I were to have a thesis,> Then that would be my flaw.> Yet since I have no thesis,> I am flawless in all regards.57 This is interpreted to mean that, since followers of the Middle Way do notaccept any views, there is, for them, no reliable means of cognition wherebyviews can be proven either. Instead, the follower of the Middle Way refutes allextreme beliefs as held by others by showing the consequences of the internalcontradictions in their claims.This account is also untenable. From the rational perspective based on havingexamined the ultimate, no claim can be established. It is, therefore, also truethat no probative reliable means of cognition can exist from such a perspectiveeither. However, from the merely relative perspective of a mind that has notengaged in such analysis, the Middle Way means dependent origination; there arefollowers of the Middle Way; and such people advance Middle Way arguments. Itcould, therefore, not reasonably be the case that a follower of the Middle Waydoes not have any view.If even reliable means of cognitions that are acknowledged by the world oragreed upon by others cannot be accepted, our own position cannot be set forth.We cannot, then, maintain that although things lack any nature, they appearmerely relatively as illusion-like dependent origination. Nor will there be anyway to induce the understanding that the positions of others, the extremebeliefs in conventional nonexistence or actual existence, are false. Hence, thewish to refute the positions of others would not arise. Likewise, there would beno way to ascertain whether or not the property of the position, entailment, andexclusion have been claimed. Hence, the object of attack through consequentialargumentation would remain unestablished. Finally, since there would be no wayto see the contradictions between the various elements of an opponent’sstatement, the consequential argument would itself remain unestablished. Thus,using consequences to refute another’s position would be unreasonable. All ofthis is discussed in the aforementioned work.Our Own PositionSecond, in presenting our own position it must first be acknowledged that areliable means of cognition by the power of facts is not tenable evenconventionally. Next, if even reliable means of cognition that are acknowledgedby the opponent, or by the world, cannot be accepted, all principles that arenegated and affirmed in terms of the mere relative will lack establishment aswell. Therefore, it is held that in terms of mere convention, both parties ofthe debate realize the negated or affirmed points through four reliable means ofcognition (perception, inference, scripture, and analogy) that are acknowledgedby the world.As a reliable means of cognition, perception is the experiential realization ofthat which has not been realized before. Through this, one sees the meredependent origination that is unexamined, manifest, and subsumed under theexternal and the internal. Thus, it primarily serves to rule out the extremeview of conventional nonexistence.In the case of inference, a proof that displays the three features brings abouta realization of that which is not evident.58 One type of inference providesconventional affirmations. Based on the three kinds of proof, one may realizethat, for example, there are minds other than one’s own, that conditioned thingsare impermanent, or that there are phenomena devoid of self. Hence, it excludesthe extreme belief that such things do not exist even conventionally.Another kind of inference performs negations in terms of reality. Througharguments, such as the absence of one and many, one may realize, for example,that there is no real establishment for any of the conceptually constructedmarks. This form of inference eliminates the extreme superimposition thatphenomena exist in reality. For the most part, the inferences explained in thescriptures of the Middle Way are seen to be primarily refutations that concernreality.As explained above, the three features of a proof involved in such inferencescannot reasonably be due to the power of facts that are established for bothparties. There is no such proof that can establish autonomously the truth of theposition that one seeks to prove. Therefore, the proofs, here, areconsequential, and the three features are accepted, either explicitly orimplicitly, by the other party [alone]. Likewise, the type of mind that ensuesfrom such proofs is inferential insofar as it is acknowledged as such by theopposing party. (As for implicit acceptance, this is the case when the otherside has not explicitly accepted [the elements one employs in the argument], yetwould still have to be committed [to them].) When unexamined, these argumentsmay appear to be established by reliable means of cognition, yet uponinvestigation, [it is seen that] that [only] in dependence on the claims of theother side [can] the mind grasping the evidence [be said to produce] a reliablemeans of cognition that apprehends in way that is free from delusion.There are four types of consequential argument. In an inference acknowledged byothers, the property of the position and the entailment are established for theopponent. Based on that, the thesis is then proven definitively from theperspective of the opposing side, thereby causing them to reject their ownposition. In a consequential argument that expresses contradiction, anopponent’s position is dispensed with by letting the opponent come to theconclusion that the way the property of the position, the entailment, and theexclusion are established to him or her makes him or her implicitly committed tothe opposite of his or her own position. Equivalence of identical reasons isused against someone who applies the same reason to reach two differentconclusions. This consequence serves to show that since the reason he or sheapplies is the same in both cases, the conclusions one draws cannot bedifferentiated and must, hence, be identical as well. Finally, lack ofestablishment due to [the proof ] being equal to the proven is applied to showthat the realist’s proof lacks establishment because it takes for granted thatwhich has yet to be proven. Moreover, it also reveals that the flaws perceivedby the realist in the Middle Way position are just as devoid of establishment asthe realist’s own probandum. Hence, it shows that an element applied in thedebate lacks establishment in the object of the debate.In the context of the relative, definitive proofs and refutations are used fromthe perspective of the Middle Way follower. However, such proofs and refutationsare established merely through the reliable means of cognition acknowledged bythe other side. Unequivocal and definitive ascertainments by the power of facts,including consequential reversals, do not occur even relatively. It must,therefore, be understood that these consequences are not autonomous argumentsand that they do not entail affirmative proof.Scriptural reliable means of cognition refers to the realization of extremelyhidden objects by means of trustworthy statements. This includes both the wordsof the Buddha and treatises by noble masters. In both cases, the statements arefound to be pure when subjected to the threefold analysis of perception,inference, and scripture. That is, when examined by means of these three, whichrespectively reveal the three fields of objects of evaluation, such statementsare seen to be both flawless and established. The scriptures of expedientmeaning, which teach the vast relative, eliminate the extreme of conventionalnonexistence. The scriptures of definitive meaning, on the other hand, teach theultimate profound emptiness, thereby dispensing with the extreme superimpositionthat phenomena exist in reality.Analogical reliable means of cognition considers the resemblance between anexample that can be observed and something else that cannot, using the former toget at the latter. Since illusions and other such examples appear, while at thesame time they are devoid of nature, they exclude the belief that phenomenaexist in reality. Since they also exemplify that which has no nature yet stillappears conventionally, they also exclude the extreme of denigration, whichholds that things do not even exist in terms of convention.The Presence of the Defining Characteristics of the Two TruthsSecond, how do these minds ascertain the presence of the definingcharacteristics in the aforementioned bearers of the characteristics of the twotruths? Once all outer and inner entities have been dismantled by the rationalcognitions described above, no truly existent entities, nonentities, or othersuch mental constructions will be found at all. Thus, it is impossible for thereto be a bearer of the characteristic of the ultimate that resists examination.In the absence of their support, there can be no characteristics either, so itis established that the ultimate truth is free from all mental constructions inthe form of defining characteristics, definienda, and bearers ofcharacteristics. Moreover, true existence is refuted when examined from theperspective of reasoning, yet from an unexamined perspective appearance may beestablished by, for example, mundane perception. All objects of a mind thatinvolves appearance are, therefore, false and illusory. From the perspective ofa mind that is established to be delusional, the bearer, that is, the mereobject of cognition, therefore definitely bears the defining characteristic,being true as the deluded object of conventional cognition.This concludes the general survey of the treatise.34.

Nāgārjuna, Rebuttal of Objections, 29.58. According to Buddhist logicians such as Dharmakīrti (seventh century), agenuine proof must display three features known as 1) the property of theposition, 2) the forward entailment, or just the entailment, and 3) the reverseentailment, which is also called the exclusion. These three features aredetermined in terms of the relation between the argument’s three basic elements:the subject, the evidence, and the property of the probandum. In Tibet thetextbook example of an argument that displays the three features is oft en thisone: “There is fire on the hill because there is smoke.” In this example, thesubject of the argument is the hill, while the fact that there is smoke is theevidence. Finally, the inferred presence of fire is the property of theprobandum. First of all, the argument displays the property of the positionbecause the evidence relates to the subject: Smoke is indeed seen on the hill.Second, it also displays the forward entailment because the evidence entails theproperty of the probandum: Wherever there is smoke, there is also fire. Finally,it likewise displays the reverse entailment because the negation of the propertyof the probandum entails the negation of the evidence: Wherever fire is absent,there is no smoke. Hence, we can conclude that the argument is genuine.

Each of these chaptersshould be understood in terms of (1) their context, (2) the explanation of theircontent, and (3) a summary of their general significance.59THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 1 Chapter 1 presents an analysis of conditions. This chapter can be contextualizedin terms of its connection to the profound sūtras and its relationship to theother chapters in the treatise. Concerning the first issue, the TranscendentConqueror himself prophesied the master Nāgārjuna as one who would clarify theGreat Vehicle’s principle of transcendent insight. Accordingly, each of thechapters in his text employs reasoning to resolve the essential meaning of theextensive, medium-length, and concise Mother Scriptures. In this way, theirconcern is with the natural emptiness of all phenomena, which is observed byinsight. In particular, this first chapter is concerned with the meaning of thestatement that no phenomena arise by nature. It proves that this is the casethrough a rational refutation of the beliefs in real arising in any one of thefour extreme ways. In doing so, it proves that teachings on the absence ofarising are of definitive meaning, showing how this is a teaching that revealsthe ultimate intrinsic nature as supported by reason. It also proves that theteachings on arising and other such principles are of expedient meaning andconcerned with what is false and relative.Second is this section’s relationship to the other chapters in the treatise.Something that knows no arising, such as the horn of a donkey, cannot reasonablybe said to cease, or to possess any other distinctive properties. Therefore,once the mental construct of arising has been refuted from the perspective ofreasoning, cessation and every other construction will be implicitly refuted aswell. It is with this in mind that the refutation of arising is taught first.The present chapter engenders two types of insight, one that is beyondappearance and one that is not. The former is the realization of the ultimateintrinsic nature that is similar to space. This realization is produced byinvalidating all mental constructs from the perspective of reason. The latter isthe realization of the relative and illusory subjects. This is elicited byshowing that, while all phenomena that appear to arise, cease, and so forth donot make sense when examined, their relative appearance is established. This isapplicable to the other chapters as well.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 1 Second, explaining the meaning of the content of chapter one will involve (1) ageneral refutation of the four extreme modes of arising and (2) a specificrefutation of arising from other. The first of these will be discussed by (1)presenting the thesis, (2) proving it with reasoning, and (3) showing how therefutation is immune to criticism.The ThesisConcerning the first issue, the treatise states:> Not from itself, not from another,> Not from both, and not uncaused—> Nowhere does anything> Ever arise. [I.1] Others consider the second half of the stanza to be a probandum and the firsthalf to be its proof. In this way, they see the reference to the absence ofarising in the manner of the four extremes as providing an agentive sense.60This, however, is not appropriate. No one imputes any fifth form of arising,aside from the four extremes. Hence, when it is established that nothing arisesin any of these four extreme ways, it will automatically be established thatarising as such does not occur at all. Therefore, it does not make sense toposit the absence of arising in these four extreme ways as evidence to provethat there is no arising as such. Furthermore, since the stanza does not containany words that indicate an agentive sense, this cannot be the meaning of thestatement.Therefore, what is being said here is that “Nowhere is it ever the case thatanything arises from itself” and so forth. In other words, this establishment ofan object is a stated claim. For this reason, the stanza should be read as it isrendered in certain scriptures:> Anything that could be held to exist> At any place and at any time> Would not be due to itself, to another,> To both, nor would it be uncaused. This may be ascertained by (1) explaining the words of the four theses, (2)contemplating how the theses that negate arising are definitively numbered atfour, and (3) dispensing with the criticism that this contradicts the MiddleWay’s lack of a thesis.The Words of the Four ThesesIn the first stanza, “anything” refers to supported outer and inner entities andis synonymous with “whatever thing.” “Nowhere” is [the negation] of a supportivelocation or philosophical system, while “ever” denotes any possible time.Definitive EnumerationSecond, the Enumerators, the realists within our own tradition, the proponentsof a primary principle that involves an almighty, and the Far-Throwers andRitualists, each profess one of the four extreme positions on arising. Since noone actually professes a fifth misconception with respect to arising, there areonly four refutations of the misconceptions that are actually maintained. Thus,there are four theses that negate them. Alternatively, we may say that thesefour theses are employed because refuting the extreme imputation of arisinginvolves exactly four elements. Arising as such may be either dependent on acause or not. If there is such dependence, the cause as such61 must be eitheridentical in substance with its effect or different. Because these two optionsare directly contradictory, there is no third option. The effect may then bethought to arise from a cause that is of the exact same substance as itself,from one that is of an entirely different substance, or, finally, from a causethat is both. Any other imputation would be impossible.How the Middle Way Has No ThesisThird, some may propose: “When it is said that the Middle Way has no thesis, itmeans that there is no thesis that takes the form of a determinativeaffirmation. This does not, however, necessitate the absence of a thesis that isa mere eliminative negation.” Others claim: “Even a thesis that is aneliminative negation would be set forth merely with the wish to dispel themisconceptions of the opposition, and in consideration of their perspectivealone. Representatives of the Middle Way have no thesis of their own, not evenan eliminative negation.”Neither of these explanations is reasonable. They are not the intent of theMaster either, who states:> Since there is nothing at all to negate,> I do not negate anything.62 Hence, since ultimately there is nothing to be negated and nothing that negates,it does not make sense for there to be a thesis in the form of an eliminativenegation either. However, concerning the relative he teaches:> From ignorance up to the culmination of aging,> The dependent workings> Of these twelve links I hold> To be like dreams and illusions.63 Thus, it is necessary to accept illusion-like dependent origination, which eveninvolves a thesis in the form of determinative affirmation. Moreover, whenrepresentatives of the Middle Way wish to reverse the misconceptions of theiropponents and so speak in a way that considers their perspective, the statementsthat they make express theses that are eliminative negations in terms of therelative.Therefore, the intent of the Master, and the real reply [to the question ofwhether or not the Middle Way has a thesis], is as follows: For a follower ofthe Middle Way, there are ultimately no positive or negative theses at all. Interms of the ultimate, therefore, we do not create any affirmative or negativetheses whatsoever either. As for the mere relative, however, in the presentcontext we present a thesis that is a mere eliminative negation, whereas ingeneral we also set forth theses that are determinative affirmations. On thispoint, it is taught:> We do not explain> Without accepting conventions.64 Hence, we do not accept that the representatives of the Middle Way have neitherpositive nor negative theses in terms of the relative.Furthermore, relative theses may concern relative issues (as when it is said,for example, that relatively phenomena are like an illusion, apparent yet devoidof nature), as well as ultimate issues (such as the statements, “Ultimatelyphenomena do not arise” or “They are beyond mental constructions and transcendall claims”). In the first case, a genuine thesis is sincerely asserted. In thesecond, however, the thesis is a superimposition. One is concerned with themistaken beliefs in the existence of things, such as arising with respect tothat which remains devoid of any essential establishment and is beyond allconstructions of negation and affirmation. Wishing to dispel thesemisconceptions, one then makes use of terms such as “absence of arising” and soteaches through superimposition. There is no sincere belief in even the meremarks that negate ultimate arising, constructs, claims, and so forth. Therefore,such negations are not genuine theses. Hence, it should be understood that [thepresence of theses concerning ultimate issues] does not contradict theexplanation that there are neither positive nor negative theses in terms of theultimate.Proving the ThesisSecond, proving the theses includes four discussions. The first of thesepresents a refutation of the Enumerators’ assertion that things such as soundarise as transformations of the primary principle and that these transformationsare, therefore, of the same identity as the primary principle.Production from SelfThis assertion will be refuted from (1) the perspective of reasoning based onexamination and analysis as well as from (2) the unanalyzed worldly perspective.The first of these two refutations involves (1) demonstrating that the arisingof something out of itself is meaningless and (2) that it is absurd. On thefirst point, it is taught:> When it has not arisen itself,> How could arising produce its own nature?> If it does so having already arisen,> Having arisen, what is it that is produced?65 Therefore, when something is not established itself, it has no essence, justlike the utpala flower of the sky. Hence, neither will it be able to produceitself. Something that is established, on the other hand, already has its ownessence, so its arising would be meaningless. It might be argued: “Even ifsomething’s essence is already established, it may still subsequently becomeactually manifest. Hence, its arising does make sense.” Yet this is not thecase. The arising of something that is already established in essence ismeaningless. If, on the other hand, there is arising in the sense of aconceptually distinguishable manifestation, then it would contradict theposition on arising that effects are already present as the identity of thecauses.The second issue has four subdivisions. The first concerns this position’scommitment to something contrary to what is widely recognized. If an effect,such as a sprout, were to arise through its identity being established withinits cause, it would then also follow that its cause, the seed, would perpetuallyarise with that identity out of its own identity because that also would existby its own identity. One cannot argue, at this point, that that there is noestablished entailment because the reason just given is identical to the onegiven in the context of the result, the sprout. It may then be argued: “Thesereasons are not identical. Because the effect, the sprout, exists in the seed ina latent form, it can arise in a manifest form. The seed that causes the sprout,on the other hand, is already fully manifest, so its reproduction would bemeaningless.” If that is so, however, then we may just as well ask how thearising of an effect with a preestablished essence could possibly serve anypurpose. If the effect is not established as manifest from the outset, and thensubsequently arises with this manifest nature, then why would it not be the casethat what arises is an essence that did not previously exist?Second, this position is in conflict with what is widely recognized. Due to thereasons outlined above, effects such as sprouts could never take place becausethey are not preceded by the cessation of seeds and other such causes. It cannotbe objected that this argument lacks entailment. First, philosophical systemsteach that the arising of an effect requires an immediately preceding condition,namely, the cessation of its cause. Second, this would not make sense. If aneffect were to occur while its cause is still present, cause and effect would besimultaneous. If this were the case, one could not affect the other, and theeffect would end up uncaused.Third, in this account cause and effect become essentially mixed up. Accordingto those who adhere to this form of causality, the seed that functions as causeand the sprout that results are directly perceived to be different in terms ofshape, color, taste, capacity, maturation, and so forth. All of these factorswill, however, become indistinguishable because they are essentially the same,as is the case with a conch and its white color. Once again, it cannot be saidthat no entailment is established since two things that possess differentcharacteristics and conflicting qualities, such as a white garlic seed and abanana palm sprout, cannot possibly be of the same substance.It might, however, be argued: “Seed and sprout possess conflicting qualities interms of their shape, and so forth. Yet, although they differ temporarily inthis way, their nature is not one of conflicting qualities. Hence, they sharethe same nature.” This, however, is not the case. If these two possessed anature that was essentially different from their shape and other temporaryqualities, we would be able to observe it. Since we cannot observe any suchnature, we can conclude that there isn’t one. Also, if they are inseparable inessence, their nature must still possess the same conflicting qualities that arepresent temporarily. Therefore, they cannot feasibly be of one nature. With thisreply, we can also reject the position of those who propose that while seed andsprout differ in terms of their color and other qualities, the substance thatpossesses these qualities is one and the same.Fourth, it would follow from this position that cause and effect are equivalentin terms of how they appear to the mind. From the perspective of a given mind,neither the seed nor the sprout could appear without the other because they areessentially inseparable, just like the roundness and whiteness of a conch. Sincethis is invalidated by perception, however, it is untenable. In a granary, forexample, seeds may be observed, but not sprouts, while in fields just theopposite occurs. Therefore, cause and effect cannot be essentially the samebecause they possess conflicting qualities in terms of appearing or notappearing to the perspective of a given mind.Refutation from the Perspective of the WorldSecond, the notion that things arise from themselves has no place among theunanalyzed conventions of the world either. The mind of a mundane person who hasnot engaged in any analysis will notice that, while a cause may have ceased andnot be seen any more, its effect is seen. On this basis, such a person will notbelieve these two to be of the same substance. This very line of reasoning ispresented in the following verses:> If something were to arise from itself, no qualitative difference would be> achieved at all;> It does not make sense for something that has already arisen to arise again.> The idea that what has arisen can do so again> Entails that the seed would go on arising to the end of existence.> The arising of sprouts and other such factors would not be found.> For you, the sprout can have no shape, color, taste, capacity, and maturation> That are different from those of its agentive cause, the seed.> If the sprout is nothing other than your seed> Then either the so-called sprout would go unperceived, just like the seed,> Or, the seed would be perceived along with its sprout> Since these two are the same. Therefore, this we do not accept.66 Along with:> Because they see the effect though its cause has disappeared,> Neither does the world claim, “These two are the same.”67 This completes the refutation of the notion that things arise from themselves.Production from AnotherSecond, the realists within our own tradition hold that, in terms of theultimate, all entities— whether they are associated with the apprehended, theapprehender, or are nondual—arise from four conditions that are other thanthemselves. The Middle Way Autonomists, in contrast, assert that theapprehended, apprehender, and nondual cognition arise from causes that aredifferent from themselves at the level of the authentic relative.Here, all such assertions will be refuted from the perspectives of reasoning andthe world. The first involves refuting the notions that (1) cause and effect areestablished as different substances and that (2) things arise from a substanceother than their own.Cause and Effect Are Not Different SubstancesConcerning the first, it is taught:> That which is different differs in dependence on something else.> It does not differ without that different thing from which it differs.68 Hence, Maitreya and Upagupta are labeled as different in dependence on eachother, not because they are different in essence. Therefore, the resultantentity has not arisen at the time of the cause and is, thus, absent. In theabsence of that entity upon which its otherness depends, the cause cannot thenbe established as other. Thus, it is explained:> The nature of things is not> In conditions and so forth.> If there is no thing itself,> How could there be anything other?69 As well as:> Sprout and seed are not present at the same time,> So how could the seed be different when there is nothing to be different> from?70 It might then be thought: “While an effect does not exist at the time of itscause, a cause can still be classified as different in dependence on an effectthat will occur later.”Yet, if an effect exists now, it cannot occur later. If, on the other hand, itdoes not exist now, then we lack the reference point needed to establish thecause as different in the present. Despite the absence of an effect, we maycreate one that will occur later as a mental object, and then, on that basis,classify its cause as something different. In that case, however, the basis forthe classification is merely nominal. “Otherness,” therefore, is just a labeland cannot be established within the entity itself.Things Do Not Arise from Another SubstanceThe second section refutes this notion (1) by demonstrating its completeabsurdity and (2) by means of analysis. The absurd consequence will beascertained by (1) presenting it and (2) refuting some possible objections. Asfor the first, if this effect, the sprout, had arisen from a seed that weresomething other than itself, then a sprout could also arise from what are notits causes, such as fire or charcoal. The reason for this is that [both causesand noncauses] would all be on a par in being different from the sprout. Thiscannot be asserted because if things could arise in this manner it would beperceivable. Since no such arising can be observed, however, we can exclude itbased on perception. The notion that things can arise from what are not theircauses, furthermore, entails either the flaw that they do not arise from whatare their causes, or, since this would be a negation of causality as such, thatthey are uncaused.Second, some may think: “This argument is not conclusive, for while cause andnoncause are alike in being something other than the effect, the effect arisesbased only on the former and not the latter.”Nonetheless, this argument is indeed conclusive. We will show this (1) by meansof an argument that turns on the equivalence of identical reasons and (2) byconsidering the way that the entailment of a single conceptual distinction isequally relevant in the case of “other.” As for the first, we shall here (1)inquire into the specific reasons [underlying the notion that cause and noncauseare different], (2) refute these reasons, and (3) show how this same critiquecannot be leveled at our own presentation of the relative.In the context of the first, we may recall the following:> If there is, indeed, a difference,> Then present an argument for this distinction.71 Hence, since cause and noncause are the same in being other, why should theeffect, in reality, arise from the former and not from the latter? This is thequestion under consideration.Concerning the second issue, we shall demonstrate the inadequacy of replies thatappeal to (1) appearance, (2) capacity, and (3) the intrinsic nature.The Reply by Appeal to AppearanceFirst, it may be thought: “The reason we can say that cause and noncause differis that we directly perceive this to be the case.”Indeed, this is how things appear from the perspective of a deluded mind thathas not engaged in analysis. Yet once we examine this notion, what is thespecific reason that one thing gives rise to the effect whereas the other doesnot, while both are particularly characterized as “other”? A reply by appealingto perception does not work because something may appear to arise withoutobjectively doing so. You, the objector, yourself accept this to be the casewhen it comes to dreams, illusions, and so on. There are also times when arisingis not observed, yet its actual occurrence is undeniable. Again, this is whatyou hold with respect to karmic action and its effects.It may then be said that the examples of dreams and illusions are not equivalentsince production from other is witnessed by undeluded minds. This notion,however, is untenable. All these objects that appear to the mind are the same inthat they appear to a mind that has not examined, while upon examination we findthem to be nonexistent. Therefore, it is not possible to find any objectivedemarcation between real and unreal. Hence, there are no grounds fordistinguishing deluded minds from those that are not. This completes theexplanation of why the first reply is untenable.The Reply by Appeal to CapacitySecond, it may be thought: “Whether or not something is a cause depends on thepresence or absence of capacity.”If this were the case, how could one determine whether or not something has thiscapacity? As we have already seen, replying that we know this based on whetheror not we perceive an effect will not do. This is the very point that the Mastermakes when he argues:> It functions as if there were an object;> Is this not like a problem in a dream?> When awakening from sleep there is no difference> In terms of the function being performed.72 The Reply by Appeal to the Intrinsic NatureThird, it may be thought: “Although cause and noncause are alike in being otherthan the effect, it is [due to] the intrinsic nature, or the greatness ofdependent origination, that something either arises or does not.”Now, for something to be the intrinsic nature there cannot be anything thatinvalidates its status as such. Furthermore, we must also be able to prove thatit is, indeed, the intrinsic nature. However, our perception of arising and lackof arising does not prove that these are the intrinsic nature of things, for thesame reasons that were stated above. Therefore, there are no reliable means ofcognition whatsoever that could establish, as the intrinsic nature of things,that while cause and noncause are equally different from the effect, the lattertruly arises based only on its cause. Thus, according to the opponent, cause andnoncause, while being equally other, can nevertheless differ in terms of whetheror not they are able to produce in reality, or as per their particularcharacteristics. When we examine why this should be so, however, no one willfind any reason.The Middle Way’s Relative Truth and This ProblemThird, we shall now show how this problem does not apply to our version of therelative. It may be argued: “You followers of the Middle Way accept yourselvesthat, for example, factors that are the same in being actions can neverthelesshave definite forms of ripening. In this way, there are many things that youhold to be certain in terms of the relative. Nevertheless, as a consequence ofwhat you have been saying, this is no longer reasonable.”For us, under examination nothing is ascertainable in terms of its particularcharacteristics, even relatively. From the perspective of a deluded mind thathas not engaged in examination, however, matters such as the effects of actionappear in a way that is not random. It is from this perspective alone that wespeak of, for example, a definite correlation between an action and its effectin terms of the relative.“Well then,” the objector may reply, “while things are the same in being other,this certainty in terms of what arises and what does not is not even relativelysupported by any particular characteristics. However, we assert that from theunexamined deluded perspective, there is, in terms of the mere appearance ofarising, or lack thereof, nevertheless a certainty that occurs in relativeterms.”With this account, however, it is no longer asserted that, in terms of therelative, things arise from what is other than themselves and by virtue of theirparticular characteristics. In contrast, it is now held that all relativecausality involves nothing more than merely apparent arising that occurs to adeluded mind, just like dreams and so on. In other words, this validates our ownposition. Therefore, whatever phenomena appear relatively may be classified incorrespondence with how they appear as certain from the perspective of a deludedmind. For you, on the other hand, analysis leads to certainty in terms ofparticular characteristics, which we do not accept even in terms of therelative. How, then, could any of the flaws that we have stated ever apply toour own position as well? On this point, it is taught:> The entities of the dependent nature that you assert> I do not accept even in the relative.> Since it is fruitful, I say all this exists though it does not;> I say what I say from the perspective of the world.73 The Entailment of a Single Conceptual DistinctionSecond, we will consider the way that the entailment of a single conceptualdistinction is equally relevant in the case of “other.” It may be thought thatthe absurd consequence demonstrated earlier lacks entailment because though asprout is equally different than all three, it will grow only from a seed, notout of fire or charcoal. When this is the case, we may then remind the objectorsthat all their autonomous arguments will be irrelevant without evidence thatfeatures entailment. Hence, we may ask them whether they are in possession ofsuch evidence, and if so, request that it be specified.In reply, they may say that such evidence is found in statements such as thefollowing: “Wherever we find smoke as such,74 there is also fire, as is the casewith a hearth. Likewise do we find smoke as such on the mountain over there.”Yet why would such an argument not be inconclusive? Why could it not be the casethat although the two are the same in being smoke as such, only the smoke foundat the hearth entails fire, and not the one on the mountain? It may be answeredthat, because it is established that the smoke as such at the hearth entailsfire, it is likewise established that the smoke as such on the mountain entailsfire as well since the two, in being smoke as such, are the same conceptualdistinction. However, since the otherness as such that is associated with theseed entails the arising of the sprout, its arising would then also be entailedby the otherness as such that is found in fire or charcoal. The conceptualdistinction of otherness as such is the same in the two cases. Alternatively, itmay be that the otherness as such that is associated with fire and charcoalentails the sprout’s not arising. In that case, why would the otherness as suchthat is associated with the seed not also entail the sprout’s not arising sinceit is the same conceptual distinction, otherness as such? Therefore, it istaught:> If cause and effect were different,> Cause and noncause would be equal.75 As well as:> If one thing were to occur based on something else,> The flames of a fire could give rise to dense darkness.76 In the context of a refutation based on this type of examination, it sufficesmerely to notice the pervasion of the evidence in the concordant factors. It is,therefore, easy to establish entailment with respect to the evidence thatappears in this scripture.In response, it may be thought: “Take a living being as such, a cow, forinstance. Since being a cow entails having a hump and dewlap, according to yourposition, it would then follow that being any living being as such, like ahuman, would also entail having a hump and dewlap since these would be the samein terms of the conceptual distinction of being living beings as such. Thiswould render all principles of convention impossible. If you reply that this isnot entailed, the same would be the case with the argument you yourselfadvanced.”On this point, it is taught:> There are no conceptual distinctions of a substance other than the substance> itself,> So how could there be an identical conceptual distinction?> If there were different substances with the same conceptual distinction,> Then why should we not accept> That there is a single universal that is different from its instances?77 In this way, we do not maintain that a given unqualified conceptual distinctionmay exist in the exact same form throughout multiple substances. Even if weassumed that there could be such a single conceptual distinction, we would stillnot accept that the unqualified conceptual distinction that is associated withthe example has the same extension as the unqualified conceptual distinctionthat is associated with the basis for dispute. Our position, therefore, is notproblematic in the ways you describe. You yourselves do not hold that theunqualified conceptual distinctions that are associated with the example and thebasis for dispute are one and the same. However, unless one accepts that theunqualified conceptual distinction of the evidence associated with the exampleentails the property of the probandum, and that this is entailed by theunqualified evidence associated with the basis for dispute, all autonomousevidence will come to an end. Therefore, our position is established.Refutation through AnalysisSecond, the arising of things from other things will be refuted using analysis.The argument here is as follows: If one thing were to arise based on anotherthing that has ceased, it would imply that the former is uncaused. Yet if theeffect were to arise without the cause having ceased, it would mean that the twoare simultaneous. It might then be thought: “One cannot claim that an effectarises without its cause having ceased. Instead, one must say that it arises bymeans of a cause that has not ceased. Moreover, since the effect is not presentat the time of its arising, cause and effect are not simultaneous.”This, however, is untenable. If an effect is absent, there can be no act ofarising because the support of that action would be missing. Hence, it would notmake sense for an effect to arise. Thus, it is taught:> Since this arising lacks its agent, it makes no sense.78 In the same way, cause and effect would end up being simultaneous if the latterwere to arise through contact with the former. If there were no contact, on theother hand, there would be no cause when the effect arises, and it would thenarise uncaused. It may be thought: “Neither of these two problems is entailedbecause effects arise due to a partial contact with their causes.”However, these faults are unavoidable. Ultimately, the notion that cause andeffect have parts that respectively do and do not meet makes no sense. In termsof the relative, the notion of contact would imply simultaneity, while that oflack of contact would mean absence of cause.It may then be asked: “Well, in that case, how can you account for the arisingof things in terms of the relative?”On this point, it is taught:> The sprout grows neither from a seed that has ceased> Nor from one that has not.> Hence, all arising is said> To be like an illusion.79 Thus, once we analyze in terms of whether or not a cause has ceased, or whetheror not there is contact between cause and effect, it becomes clear that evenrelatively things do not arise in terms of particular characteristics. As is thecase with dreams and illusions, things merely seem to arise based on causes andconditions from the perspective of a deluded mind that has not engaged inanalysis. This is what we assert.Refutation from the Perspective of the WorldSecond, from the perspective of the world as well, things do not arise from whatis other than themselves. The mundane mind simply sees effects arising fromcauses. It does not perceive these causes to be different in substance fromtheir effects. If this were not the case and cause and effect were perceived tobe different, worldly people would not think, “I produced this child,” althoughthey only supplied a seed, or, “I planted this tree,” when they only planted theseed. In such cases, the child and the tree are not conceived of as differentfrom the seeds that cause them, and ordinary worldly minds do think this way.Therefore, the world does not see cause and effect as being different insubstance.It might then be thought: “The mundane mind does, in fact, perceive cause andeffect to be different in substance, but of the same continuum. Thus, whenpeople think in the ways you describe, it is in acknowledgment of thiscontinuum.”That account, however, is untenable. As with jujube fruits associated withmultiple containers, one single continuum cannot essentially be inseparable frommultiple substances. For these very reasons, it is taught:> People of the world, having supplied only a seed,> May say, “I produced this child,”> Or think, “I planted that tree.”> Hence, arising from other is not the world’s opinion either.80 Therefore, what we observe is that the mundane mind does not distinguish betweenself, other, and other such factors. Instead, it simply thinks that effects aredue to causes. The Master treats the relative in this way as well:> That which arises in dependence on something else> Is not identical with it,> Nor is it something other.> Hence, it is neither annihilated nor permanent.81This concludes the explanation of the refutation of the idea that things arisefrom what is other than themselves.Things Do Not Arise from Both Themselves and Other ThingsNext, the notion that things come about due to both themselves and other thingsis refuted. This position is taken by those among the Enumerators, who assert aprimary principle as well as the Almighty. They explain that resultant thingsarise from both themselves and something else. Hence, they neither assert thatthings are exclusively the product of themselves nor that they are dueexclusively to something other than themselves. In this way, they believe theirposition to be free from the problems explained earlier. This position isrefuted by means of (1) the arguments that were explained earlier and (2)further arguments not previously supplied. Concerning the first, it is taught:> Arising due to both is not reasonable either> Because the flaws just explained would ensue.82 Hence, because this account involves both the idea that things arise fromthemselves and that they arise from something else, all the problems that werepresented in the respective contexts of these two positions will ensue here aswell, without exception.Regarding the second issue, it is explained:> If suffering were produced by each of these,> Then suffering would be the product of both.83 Let us imagine that the power to produce were present in both the thing itselfas well as something else. If this were the case, then their coming togethercould also be productive. Yet, as was explained above, neither of these has thiscapacity. Therefore, just as sesame oil cannot be derived from sand, the comingtogether of these two will yield nothing.It may then be objected: “This argument is inconclusive because, for example,the eyes, visual forms, and the other factors that engender visual cognition donot have the power to do so in isolation, yet they do once they assemble.”This, however, is not so. On this point, it is taught:> So-called continua and assemblies> Are, like garlands and armies, false.84 Hence, since assemblies have no substantial existence, in reality, they lack thecapacity to produce. We might then allow that they have this powerconventionally, yet, as is the case with the assembly, the eye and each of theother contributing factors would then also be in possession of the mere capacityto produce visual cognition. According to the opponent, however, each of theseis powerless, and so this counterargument is not valid.Causeless ArisingThe refutation of causeless arising concerns the Proponents of the Beauty ofThis Side and the Ritualists. The former believe that mere awareness and theexperience of pleasure and pain in the present are not caused by mere awarenessand virtuous and nonvirtuous action in previous lives. Rather, they hold thesesimply to be the effects of aggregations of the material elements of this worldand the various constellations of favorable and unfavorable conditions. Thus,they do not accept imperceptible causes.The Ritualists assert the following:> The sun rising and water falling,> The pea being round and the thorn long and sharp,> The color and shape of the peacock—> All of this is not anyone’s design; it occurs by itself. In this way, they assert that the various forms of sentient life manifest oftheir own accord, without any causal dependence. Thus, they do not even acceptperceptible causes.To refute these ideas, we will demonstrate the absurd consequences of thesepositions, namely, that (1) things would no longer occur occasionally, (2) allefforts to cause an effect to occur would be futile, and (3) no apprehendedobjects could appear to the mind.The Absurd Consequence That Things Could No Longer Be OccasionalConcerning the first topic, it is taught:> Since the uncaused does not depend on anything,> It would be permanently present or absent.85 If things were uncaused, they would be entirely independent of all thevariations in terms of time, place, and so forth. This would mean that once sucha thing had come into being, it would continue to exist everywhere and for alleternity. The rationale, here, is that there could never be a place or time atwhich something required for the existence of this thing would be lacking. Allplaces and times, therefore, would be indistinguishable from what is held to bethe place and time of its manifestation.On the other hand, if such thing were ever absent at some point, it would followthat it could never manifest anywhere else either because there could never beany place or time at which the factors upon which its existence depends wouldcome together. All places and times would, therefore, be identical with what isheld to be the place and time of its absence.This, however, is untenable. It is invalidated by the perception of the world,which sees things only at particular times and places. Therefore, because thingsare seen only occasionally, it follows that they depend on variations in timeand place. Because their features are seen to differ, moreover, it follows thatthey depend on causes that are responsible for such specific features. In termsof the relative, therefore, it is established that things have causes.The Absurd Consequence That All Effort Would Be FutileSecond, given that things are uncaused, it would follow that engaging a cause tobring about a particular result, such as doing farm work to create a harvest,would be as futile as trying to grow a sky flower. Perception, however, tells usthat such efforts do serve a purpose. This as well establishes that things dohave causes. On this point, it is taught:> If what happens is entirely uncaused,> Anything can occur anywhere and always.> The worldly would not, then, for the sake of the fruition,> Apply hundreds of efforts to things such as seeds.86 The Absurd Consequence That Objects Could Not Appear to the MindThird, things being uncaused would entail that all objects apprehended by themind would be as nonappearing as the sky flower. It is taught:> If the world had no causes, it could not be apprehended,> Just like the scent and color of the utpala of space,> Yet the world is apprehended in all its vivid variations.> Therefore, as is the case with your consciousness, know that the world is due> to causes.87 It may be objected: “Though not the product of causes, object universals,reflections, the appearance of a double moon, and other such things still appearas apprehended objects to those suffering from delusion. There-fore, the absurdconsequence as well as its reversal are both not valid.”However, the aforementioned factors appear only when certain conditions arepresent. Respectively, the mind has to be directed in a certain way, there hasto be a mirror and a face, the sense faculty that is involved must be defective,and so forth in order for such things to appear. If these conditions are notmet, however, they will not appear. In terms of convention, therefore, all ofthese have causes.It may then be thought: “Those conditions simply form the basis for theoccurrence of such deluded forms of perception. The features of the objects thatappear only manifest to a deluded mind. No entity is actually present. Hence,the examples given above are not the products of causes and conditions.”Yet this will not do either. These are not the objects of a mind that is freefrom delusion, and they are not apprehended as arising due to causes andconditions by virtue of their own particular characteristics. They are, however,present as objects apprehended by the deluded mind and, thus, merely appear toarise in dependence on causes and conditions. Thus, it is explained:> A mind that relies on a defective sense faculty> May see hair tufts due to a visual impairment.> For that mind, the two are both true,> And false for one with clear sight.88 It is with this in mind that the Master says:> Apart from what originates dependently,> There are no phenomena at all.89 A sūtra likewise states:> All known phenomena have causes and conditions;> None are known that have no causes and conditions.90 This completes the explanation of the way uncaused things are refuted.As explained earlier, any fifth version of arising is impossible. Therefore,once these four extremes associated with arising have been refuted, it will alsohave been established that that which originates dependently does not arise bynature. Something unarisen that possesses distinctive properties, such ascessation, is as unintelligible as the notion of a garland of sky flowers. Thus,it has now been perfectly established that, as was argued above, dependentorigination is free from the eight mentally constructed extremes.This Refutation’s Immunity to CritiqueThird, to show how this approach is immune to critique, we will explain (1) howit does not conflict with scripture and (2) how refuting the four extremepositions on arising does not invalidate arising in terms of the relative.How the Refutation Does Not Conflict with ScriptureConcerning the first, we may find the following objection: “The position thatdependent origination is free from the eight mentally constructed extremesconflicts with the sūtras. They explain that the condition of ignorance givesrise to formation and so on. Thus, they teach that, when it comes to dependentorigination, arising and the other factors that you deny do indeed exist.”While it is true that such explanations are given in the sūtras, one also findsstatements such as these:> What arises due to conditions does not arise;> It lacks the nature of arising.91 And:> All phenomena do not arise and do not cease; by nature, they are peace. One must, therefore, seek out the intent of the sūtras. On this topic, the SūtraTaught by Akṣayamati explains:> When a sūtra shows how to practice the ultimate, it is of “definitive> meaning.” When it shows how to practice the relative, it is of “expedient> meaning.” In this way, the teachings of the Able One are of both expedient and definitivemeaning. Moreover, the meaning of a teaching that expounds arising and othersuch principles cannot be established as definitive because rational analysisshows that such principles cannot be true in reality. Therefore, when sūtras ofexpedient meaning teach, for example, the existence of relative arising, in noway does it harm the message of our sūtras of definitive meaning, which teachthat dependent origination is ultimately free from arising, ceasing, and allother mental constructs. The Sūtra of the King of Meditative Absorptions states:> The Bliss-Gone One’s teaching of emptiness> Is what distinguishes the sūtras of definitive meaning.> Teachings about sentient beings, individuals, and persons—> All such Dharmas are known to be of expedient meaning. And Candrakīrti explains:> Those sūtras that explain something other than reality are taught> To be of expedient meaning and should be relied upon as such.> Those with the meaning of emptiness are then to be known as definitive.92 How the Refutation Does Not Deny Relative ArisingSecond, it may be argued: “The refutation of arising in the manner of the fourextremes is made with respect to both truths. Since no fifth type of arising ispossible, even relative arising would be untenable.”As explained before, an analysis of the four extremes will indeed invalidatearising, even in terms of the relative. Therefore, contrary to what theAutonomists believe, there is nothing that arises by virtue of its particularcharacteristics. However, when the mind’s eye suffers from ignorance, its visionbecomes distorted, and it then merely appears as though things arise due tocauses and conditions. Therefore, so that the flow of conventions will not beinterrupted, we refer to that mere appearance using the term “dependentorigination.” In the words of the noble master Nāgārjuna:> That suffering is created by itself,> By something other, by both, or that it is uncaused—> This is what logicians assert.> You speak of dependent origination.93 SPECIFIC REFUTATION OF ARISING FROM OTHER Having offered a general presentation of the refutation of arising in terms ofthe four extremes, the focus turns specifically to a refutation of arising fromother. At this point, the Master does not explain the refutation of the otherthree positions further because their untenability is quite clear and becauserefuting them as an aside in another context is sufficient. The idea that thingsarise from other things, however, is somewhat tenable and difficult to refute.This notion, therefore, will now be refuted with respect to both (1) the way itis accepted in treatises and (2) the way it is accepted in the world.Arising from Other as Accepted in the TreatisesOn the first issue, the treatise states:> There are four conditions:> Causal, objective, immediately preceding,> And, likewise, the ruling.> There is no fifth condition. [I.2] Here, the opposing view is presented first. Members of our own tradition state:“It is indeed reasonable to refute arising in terms of the other three extremes.To refute arising from other, however, is extremely unjustified. In theAbhidharma sūtras, the Transcendent Conqueror himself taught that resultantentities are produced by four conditions and that these four are something otherthan their effects. In the context of philosophical tenets, moreover, it isexplained that there are six causes and four conditions, although these are nottwo separate sets. As it is taught:> The causal condition consists of five causes.> The mind and mental states that have arisen> Are the equal and immediately preceding, except for the last.> The observed are all phenomena,> And the ‘agentive cause’ is explained to be the ruling.94 Hence, the six causes are included in the four conditions. The causal conditionincludes the five causes that establish the essence of the effect. Theoccurrence of a sprout or an eye cognition, for example, is due to a causalcondition. With the former, this condition is a seed, while with the latter itis the seminal element located in the all-ground that is responsible for thattype of cognition. Next, the observed condition is an object that makes the mindand mental states take on its own features when observed. Immediately precedingconditions, on the other hand, are moments of awareness that arise within amental continuum. Specifically, this refers to a previous moment of awarenessthat, in having just ceased to be, accommodates for and produces a subsequentmoment of awareness. Finally, anything that makes the arising of an effectpossible when present, yet does not belong to these three categories, is knownas a ruling condition or agentive cause. As with the previous conditions, thisfactor facilitates an effect.Thus, every factor that facilitates an effect, even if only slightly, isincluded in these four categories. Since whatever lies outside of these four,such as the Almighty, is not a condition, there is no fifth condition. Hence,all outer and inner entities arise due to these four conditions, which aredifferent from what they produce.”Now, while this has indeed been taught, if we examine this teaching withreasoning, it does not make sense. The meaning it expresses, therefore, is of anexpedient nature; it is not definitive. This will be explained by (1) offering ageneral refutation of the notion that arising is due to conditions that aresomething other than their effects, (2) refuting the notion that arising iscaused by actions that are other than their effects, (3) refuting the generalrationale for conditions, and (4) specifically refuting the characteristics ofeach of the four conditions.Conditions as Something Other Than Their EffectsOn the first issue, the treatise states:> The nature of things is not> In conditions and so forth.> If there is no thing itself,> How could there be anything other? [I.3] Here, the preposition “in” is applied in the construction of the seventh case,the locative. In the present context, the locative can be understood in atemporal sense, as well as being indicative of a supportive basis. Thus,reflective of the locative’s dual significance, this passage refutes the notionsthat cause and effect are different in substance and that effects arise based oncauses.The first argument goes as follows: As the subject, let us take the nature ofsprouts and other such resultant entities. These are not present when the causalseed and conditions such as water and fertilizer remain unchanged, regardless ofwhether we consider these causal factors individually or collectively. Thereason, here, is that such effects will not yet have arisen. If this were notthe case, cause and effect would be simultaneous, and the conditions could not,then, have any influence on their effects. Thus, effects would be uncaused. If,when its conditions are present, the resultant entity is not present itself witha nature of its own, how could these conditions ever be something other thantheir effects? Since there is no point of reference, classifying conditions asdifferent under these circumstances would be similar to having short withoutlong, or a “this side” without any “that side.” This point was explainedextensively above.According to the second interpretation, the nature of sprouts and other thingsis not present in such factors as conditions. Whether we consider causes andconditions individually, as a collection, or in some other way, there is nothingthat supports an effect before it has arisen, as if it were a jujube fruitsitting on a plate. If an effect were present in such a way, we would be able toperceive it, yet we do not. Moreover, its arising would then be meaningless.Therefore, if an effect is not itself present in causes and conditions, howcould it arise from causal factors that are other than itself. As the sayinggoes, this would be as impossible “as getting sesame oil from sand.” Theentailment of this argument is explained in the following stanza:> If, without being present there,> It were still to arise from conditions,> Why would it not also arise> From that which is not a condition? [I.12] The Sanskrit term bhava [that in the third stanza is translated as “thing”]means both “thing” and “element.” The first explanation of the argument buildson the former sense of the word, whereas the second employs the latter. Themaster Bhavya treats the first half of the third stanza as a refutation ofarising from self and the second half as a refutation of arising from other.Arising Caused by Actions That Are Other Than Their EffectsOn the second issue, the treatise reads:> Actions do not have conditions,> Yet there are no actions without conditions.> Without an action there are no conditions,> Yet no conditions are involved in an action. [I.4] The Proponents of Differences of the Listener Vehicle believe that differentconditions do not themselves produce effects. Rather, they believe thatconditions engender an ontologically separate factor, the action of arising, andit is this that produces an effect. We may then ask whether or not such anaction itself has conditions. Let us begin by considering the first option. Ifan effect has already arisen, an action that produces that effect would bepointless. If the effect has not arisen, however, no action of arising couldpossibly relate to it, for the effect would, at that point, be as nonexistent asthe sky flower. Finally, there is nothing that is “currently arising” apart fromwhat either has or has not arisen, and so we do not find the action of arisingin any present process either. Thus, since we will fail to find such an actionin any of the three times upon examination, we can conclude that actions do nothave conditions.Now let us consider the alternative. If it were the case that actions had noconditions, actions would be uncaused. Therefore, even from the uncriticalperspective that considers merely what seems to be the case, we must agree thatthere are no actions without conditions. It might then be thought that it is theconditions themselves that produce effects. Yet unless an act of producing isinvolved, there are no grounds to classify conditions as such, just as one wouldnot apply this term to the sky flower. Hence, it is not the conditionsthemselves [that produce]. It might then be thought that what determines whethersomething is produced is the presence of conditions that become involved in agiven action. Yet, as explained above, the act of production is nonsensical inrelation to what has arisen, what has not arisen, and what is in the process ofarising.The General Rationale for ConditionsOn the third topic, the treatise states:> They are known as conditions> Because things arise in dependence on them.> Yet as long as nothing arises,> Why would they not be nonconditions? [I.5] > Neither for the nonexistent, nor for the existent,> Could there possibly be conditions.> For the nonexistent, what would be conditioned?> For the existent, what role could conditions play? [I.6] It may be thought: “What is the point of all this analysis? Consciousness,sprouts, and other such things arise based on the eye, form, and so forth. Inother words, they arise based on the four conditions, as is taught. Indeed, itis because this is the case that the latter are known as “conditions” of theformer and referred to as such.”Be that as it may, it has still not been established that effects arise based onthese conditions. Think of the time when all the factors conducive to an effecthave not yet come together, or when an adverse factor prevents the manifestationof an effect. Thus, so long as an effect has yet to arise, we have no groundsfor classifying anything as conditions because our reason for doing so, the actof arising, is absent. How could the four conditions be anything butnonconditions under these circumstances, in the same way that the ear and soundare nonconditions for the production of visual consciousness? Indeed, that isprecisely what they are. Moreover, when something is a noncondition for thearising of a certain effect, it cannot reasonably start producing that effect atsome point in the future either, just as sand will not suddenly begin to yieldsesame oil.It may then be replied: “Something that is not a condition for the arising of acertain effect to begin with may, due to the influence of another condition,later become a condition that is actually capable of producing it.”However, this additional condition does not start out as the condition for thefirst condition’s becoming actually capable of producing the effect, so it couldnot reasonably become so later. If one believes that, in order to become acondition, a third condition is required, then that third condition wouldrequire a fourth and so on. As the Commentary explains, this would entail aninfinite regress.Some95 may think: “When an effect arises, a certain act, that of production, ispresent in the condition. It is, therefore, a condition.”Yet, if the act of production is found in the condition at that time, then theact of arising will be present in the effect. If the effect does possess such anact, however, it will be established as an entity, and therefore not require anyconditions.We may examine this same issue in reference to effects. If such conditions wereto produce an effect, what they produce must either be something that did notexist before or something that did. In consideration of these two alternatives,the Master presents his own genuine thesis with the statement, “Neither for thenonexistent, nor for the existent, could there possibly be conditions.”To prove this statement, he shows first that the very classification ofsomething as a cause depends on there being an effect. If there is no effect,calling something a cause would be similar to speaking of a son in the absenceof a father. In such a case, what would the conditions be the conditions for?The same point is made in the following lines:> Without the existence of an effect,> The cause lacks what makes it a cause. If, on the other hand, an effect were present, like a jujube fruit in a bowl, itwould already be established. Since it would not need to be created, what rolewould conditions have to play?The Characteristics of the Four ConditionsFourth, it may be argued: “In any case, the Transcendent Conqueror has taught,for example, that ‘the cause is that which effectuates.’ In this way, heexplained the characteristics of each of the four conditions. Hence, they areexistent by nature.”In reply, we may point out that since the given characteristics do not stand toreason, such teachings are not of definitive meaning. Next, to show how theircharacteristics are unreasonable, we shall consider them individually.First, the following verses highlight the untenability of the causal condition:> If no existent, nonexistent, or both existent and nonexistent> Phenomenon comes into being,> How can we speak of “effectuating conditions”?> When this is the case, they do not make sense. [I.7] If an effect were to come into being, there would also be causal conditionsresponsible for its occurrence. However, an existent effect does not need to beeffectuated, a nonexistent effect cannot be effectuated, and an effect bothexistent and nonexistent would not only be a contradiction, it would also entailboth of the flaws identified in the previous two cases. Hence, without anyeffectuated effect, how can we speak of “conditions that effectuate the essenceof their results”? If there is no such thing as an effectuating condition, itwould be unreasonable to insist that causal conditions exist by virtue of theircharacteristics.Second, refuting the characteristic of the observed condition, the treatisestates:> It is explained that, with existent phenomena,> There are no observations whatsoever.> How could a phenomenon for which there is no observation> Ever relate to an observation? [I.8] It is also taught:> What phenomena possess observations? All phenomena subsumed under mind and> mental states.96 It may be thought that subjective primary minds and subsidiary mental statesarise due to conditions in the form of observed objects. Yet, if this were thecase, would we conceive of the observed condition in reference to an observerthat exists or one that does not? The first idea is refuted by reversing thesequence of the stanza’s two halves. Thus, the words “a phenomenon” in the thirdline present the subject, a resultant mind or mental state that exists. Howcould such a phenomenon depend upon an observed condition? Without any relationto something observed, it already exists prior to any such condition. Hence, itis explained that this preexistent, observing phenomenon cannot be conditionedby anything that is observed. Therefore, the opponent’s teaching that suchphenomena have their own observed conditions is nothing but an empty claim.For the refutation of a nonexistent observer, we follow the actual sequence ofthe stanza’s two halves, yet change the phrase “existent phenomena” in the firstline to “nonexistent phenomena.” Thus, contrary to what the opponent declares,if a resultant observing phenomenon does not exist, it cannot possibly beconditioned by a given object of observation. In the case of a phenomenon forwhich there is nothing observed, the observer as such is nonexistent, just likethe sky flower. How, then, could it possibly relate to something observed?The master Bhavya explains this stanza as follows: A phenomenon that alreadyexists as an observer to begin with cannot depend on an observation in any way.Such dependence would be nothing but mere verbiage. Moreover, if thisphenomenon, an observer, did not exist, how could there possibly be anythingthat it observes? Thus, according to this reading, the refutation of observedconditions for existent and nonexistent observers is found in the first and thesecond halves of the stanza, respectively.Third, refuting the characteristics of the immediately preceding condition, thetreatise states:> If phenomena have not arisen,> Cessation makes no sense.> Hence, an immediately preceding condition is untenable.> If it has ceased, how could it be a condition? [I.9] Indeed, the immediately preceding condition for a given effect is a cause thatceases immediately before the effect manifests. However, so long as no resultantphenomenon, a sprout, for instance, has arisen, any cessation of a phenomenonthat is its cause, such as a seed, would not make sense. Since a cause will nothave ceased when its effect has yet to arise, the effect’s arising cannot bepreceded by the cessation of the cause. Hence, it does not make sense to speakof an immediately preceding condition.If a cause were to cease before its effect had arisen, in having ceased it wouldhave become nonexistent. What kind of condition for the production of asubsequent effect does that then leave us with? Also, since it is by the powerof the manifestation of a subsequent effect that a preceding cause comes to anend, what would the condition be for the cause’s cessation?This stanza can be alternatively read as a follow-up to the previousrefutations: Since it has been shown that no phenomena arise, there cannotreasonably be any cessation. Hence, the idea of an immediately precedingcondition is nonsensical. Even if there were cessation without arising, whatconditions could there be for the arising of an effect or the ceasing of acause?Fourth, refuting the characteristics of the ruling condition, the treatisestates:> Since there is no existence> Of things that have no nature,> Saying, “this occurs because of that”> Would not make any sense. [I.10] The ruling condition is defined as that which is not any of the other threeconditions and yet whose existence contributes to the occurrence of a giveneffect. This definition, however, is unsound because being itself is notestablished; there is no existence as such. We are justified in saying thisbecause, since all things originate dependently, they have no nature, likereflections in a mirror.At this point, one might object: “For an opponent who does not accept thisabsence of nature, such as a realist, your argument will remain unfounded. Forthose who do, however, merely invalidating nature itself will suffice since thiswill also serve to invalidate the nature of ruling conditions. In the lattercase, offering evidence to support such a claim would be pointless.”As explained earlier, to an opponent for whom the absence of nature is notestablished, this absence will be proven by presenting dependent origination asevidence. Indeed, when nature as such has been invalidated by this evidence, theidea that being produced by ruling conditions is the nature of things will havebeen invalidated as well. However, just as one may negate the presence of anaāoka tree by referring to the absence of any tree, using the absence of natureas evidence to refute this convention does not pose a problem.The unproblematic character of the argument is clarified further by consideringhow, in this particular context, this functions to disprove the argumentadvanced by the opposition. Our opponents may say that because thecharacteristics of ruling conditions do exist, things arise from something otherthan themselves. In reply, we may say that, for those of us who assert thatthings have no nature, such characteristics are not established.The Worldly Notion of Arising from OtherWhat now follows is a refutation of the worldly notion that things arise fromwhat is other than themselves. Worldly people, as well as certain logicians,form their opinions without basing their views on any philosophical system.“Sprouts, woolen garments, and other such things,” they say, “come about due toseeds, earth, yarn, and so on. We can see this for ourselves, just as we seethat these causes are something other than what they produce. Therefore, thingsarise from other things!”Nevertheless, as is the case with dreams, while this may be the perception of aconventional deluded mind, when we investigate we will find that things do notarise based on other things. To explain further, we shall (1) consider howeffects cannot reasonably arise, regardless of whether or not they are presentor absent in their conditions, and (2) regardless of whether they are of thenature of their conditions or not. This will then be followed by (3) aconclusion.On the first issue, the treatise states:> In separate conditions and their gathering,> The effect is entirely absent.> How could something that does not exist in the conditions> Ever arise from them? [I.11] Let us consider whether effects arise due to their presence or absence inconditions. The first option involves an effect manifesting while having alreadybeen present in its conditions. Concerning this view, it may be held that aneffect is present in each of its individual conditions. There is, however, nosuch presence at all. If there were, there would be just as many effects asthere are conditions. Moreover, such a presence would have to be observable, yetit is not. Effects are also entirely absent from their conditions en masse. Ifthey do not exist in any of their individual conditions, they cannot exist intheir assembly either. Furthermore, if effects were indeed present in acollection of multiple conditions, each of them would individually need to havetwo aspects, one in which the effect is present and another in which it is not.The effect would then emerge only from those aspects in which it is present, andso a single effect would be the product of a fraction of each condition.Alternatively, if effects did not exist within their conditions, how couldsprouts, woolen garments, and other such effects arise from seeds, yarn, andother conditions? Our position is that they could not, and we prove it by takingas evidence the fact that they do not exist within those conditions, in whichcase their arising would be as likely as getting sesame oil from sand.The objection that there is no entailment will be to no avail. If sprouts andwoolen garments were to result from conditions, such as seeds and yarn, withinwhich they do not exist, why would they not also arise based on factors that arenot conditions, such as fire and grass? Indeed, nonconditions would then producethese effects as well, for they would be the same as conditions in beingcompletely devoid of the effect. This, then, shows the significance of theevidence that we have advanced.Therefore, the probandum that is entailed by the evidence is established by anequivalence of identical reasons. Should the opponent again call that intoquestion, he or she will be asked to explain why effects truly arise only fromtheir conditions, although these same effects are equally nonexistent in bothconditions and nonconditions. Any reply that refers to appearance, capacity, orintrinsic nature will, as explained earlier, be insufficient.On the second issue, the treatise states:> The effect may be of its conditions’ nature,> But these conditions have no nature of their own.> How could the effect of that which is not an entity itself> Be of the nature of that which conditions it? [I.13] > Hence, it is not of the nature of its conditions,> Nor of the nature of that which are not its conditions. [I.14a–b] Next we shall consider whether or not the effect is of the nature of itsconditions. In this context, it may be thought: “The Enumerators hold thatsprouts and woolen garments are identical in nature with the seeds and yarn thatproduce them. The issue of whether or not the effect is present in itsconditions is, therefore, irrelevant.”Now, if conditions such as seeds and yarn themselves had their own nature, thentheir effects could certainly be of that same nature. Conditions, however, donot have any essence or nature of their own. On this point, it is taught:> Apart from what is composite,> The mind does not encounter any entity.97 Hence, whatever dwells in the center of the ten directions, or in the interimbetween the past and future, must have multiple parts that face in eachdirection and that relate to the past and future, respectively. Its nature,then, is compartmentalized; it is a mere imputation based on constituent parts.With this in mind, how might the effect of our subject, that is, conditions, beof the nature of these very same conditions? Indeed, it could not. To provethis, we may present as evidence the fact that conditions are themselves notentities; they lack any established nature. In this sense, they are similar tothe son of a barren woman.Again, members of our own tradition may think: “Effects arise from conditionsthat are of a different nature than their own.”Nonetheless, no effect is of the nature of factors that are not its conditions.That is to say, if sprouts and woolen garments were not of the nature of theirconditions, seeds and yarn, these conditions would be of a nature that iscontrary [to their effects, as is the case with] fire, grass, and other suchfactors that are not conditions. Moreover, it would be meaningless for thatwhich is established as having a different nature than its conditions to stilldepend on them. Hence, effects would end up causeless.On the third issue, the treatise states:> As there is no effect, how could there be> Conditions as well as nonconditions. [I.14c–d] At this point, it may be thought: “You just claimed that if an effect arisesfrom conditions within which it is absent, it would also have to arise from whatare not its conditions. In other words, you do acknowledge that there arecertain things that are conditions and others that are not. It then follows thateffects, as counterparts to these conditions, exist as well.”Now, while we do express ourselves in this way, we do so only in considerationof what you yourself accept, or what is agreed upon in the world. Whethereffects are believed to be present or absent in their conditions, or whether ornot they are believed to be of the nature of their conditions, ourinvestigations have refuted the notion of arising. Therefore, as there is noeffect, how could the conditions and nonconditions that it relates to possiblyexist?SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE Having offered this explanation of the scripture, this third section presents asummary of its significance. This first chapter refutes the notion that effectsarise from something other than themselves. It does so by refuting the ideasthat effects arise based on conditions that are other than themselves, that theessence of the effect does or does not exist, that effects are present or absentin their conditions, and that effects are or are not of the nature of theirconditions. In emphasizing the refutation of arising from other, this chapteralso functions to present a general refutation of all four extreme notions thatconcern arising.Thus, explicitly, the present chapter demonstrates how the principle of absenceof arising is immune to critique. It performs an existential negation of theconstructs of real arising, and establishes that the appearance of dependentorigination is of a relative nature. Moreover, since there cannot reasonably bephenomena that do not arise, this chapter also presents an implicit existentialnegation of the constructs related to the true existence of any phenomenon,establishing their appearance to be relative and illusory. Hence, it serves toengender the insight that is the realization of the two truths exactly as theyare.The same teaching is found in the sūtras. As the Noble Śālu Sprout Sūtra states:> When a seed causes a sprout to manifest, it is not created by itself or by> something else. It does not come from both, yet neither is it uncaused. It is> not produced by an almighty or by time. It arises, rather, in dependence. This concludes the explanation of the first chapter, the analysis of conditions,in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.59. Mabja refers to this framework of context, explanation, and summary at thebeginning of each of the chapters in the Root of the Middle Way. Despite thiscontinuous reference, however, his treatment of certain chapters does notcontain a separate summary at the end.60. With this sense, the absence of arising in the four ways becomes a reasonthat is set forth to prove that nothing arises.61. “The cause as such” (Tib. rgyu tsam), or perhaps more literally, “the merecause,” is the cause not qualified or specified in any particular way. The samegoes for “arising as such” in the preceding sentence; the reference is to theunspecified, bare phenomenon of arising.62. Nāgārjuna, Rebuttal of Objections, 63.63.

From the Journey to Laṅkā."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF GOING AND COMINGTHE ANALYSIS of going and coming will be treated under the same three headingsthat were used in the previous chapter.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 2 First we will discuss the chapter’s context. Concerning its relation to theprofound sūtras, we may consider the following passages. The Mother of theVictorious Ones states:> Form does not come from anywhere or go anywhere, nor does it remain anywhere. While the Noble Jewel Mound states:> The venerable ones do not proceed anywhere, nor have they arrived from> anywhere. The monk Subhūti does not go somewhere, and he has not come from> anywhere. For this reason, the Transcendent Conqueror has taught the Dharma. The present chapter employs reasoning to ascertain the meaning of such passages.As for the chapter’s relation to the other chapters, we may see it as a responseto the following idea: “By demonstrating that dependent origination does notoccur, the analysis of conditions has also implicitly established that there isno going or otherwise. Nevertheless, the nonexistence of going and coming shouldbe proven explicitly using a form of reasoning that is thoroughly accepted bythe opposition.”Hence, this chapter explicitly refutes this concept by undermining the verynotion of going and coming.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 2 Second, the explanation of the content will include (1) an elaborate explanationof the reasoning that refutes the act of going and (2) the conclusion that thisrefutation leads to. The first of these topics covers (1) a refutation of theact of going by analyzing it in terms of the three times, (2) a refutationthrough a threefold examination of the agent, (3) a refutation of the argumentsused to substantiate the act of going, (4) a refutation through examiningwhether the act of going and its support, that is, the one who goes, are thesame or different from one another, and (5) a refutation of the act of going byexamining whether it is singular or multiple. The first refutation involves (1)a general refutation of the act of going on the paths of the three times and (2)a specific refutation with respect to going in the present.Going and the Paths of the Three TimesOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Where there has been going, there is none;> Where it has yet to occur, there is no going either.> Aside from what has been traversed and what has not,> No place where walking occurs can be identified. [II.1] The act of going is brought about by an agent in relation to an object. Goingmust, therefore, entail these two. The term “object” refers here to the basisfor engaging in the act of going, that is, the path that is traversed. Such apath, moreover, can be one of only three types: It can be one that has alreadybeen traversed, one that has yet to be travelled, and one upon which going hasmanifested and is still occurring.Now, if going occurs, it must take place on one of these three paths. Yet itcannot occur on a path that has already been traversed because the act hasceased and is absent there. Likewise, going does not take place on a path thathas yet to be traversed since the act, having not yet occurred, is also absentthere. Finally, going does not occur on a path that is presently being walkedupon either. Consider a single walker proceeding along a path. Because havingand not having been traversed are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, we willfail to identify, or observe, any path that is presently being traversed asidefrom where the walker has already gone or has yet to go. Hence, there is no pathbeing traversed in the present aside from these two.It may be thought, “Indeed, going is over where the walker has already gone, andwhere he has not yet gone, it is still to come. Nevertheless, we will find thepresent act of going on the exact location where the individuals feet arecurrently stepping.”The walker’s feet, however, can be broken down into most subtle particles. Theparticles that lie behind the particles constituting the tip of the toes on theback foot relate to the path that has already been traversed, while theparticles located ahead of the particles that make up the heel of the front footrelate to the path that has yet to be covered.Moreover, even the most subtle particles that make up the feet must themselvesbe composed of numerous parts. Therefore, as explained before, in a particlethat touches the ground, all that lies behind the front of the particle isincluded in the path that has already been traversed, while what is ahead of theback part of the particle will belong to the path that has yet to come.The nonexistence of any path upon which walking presently occurs and which isneither that which has already been traversed nor that which has yet to bewalked upon is also established in the verses that begin, “Since what is takingbirth is already partly born.…” In other words, the path that is currently beingtraversed cannot reasonably be anything other than a part that has already beencovered and a part that has yet to come.Going in the PresentOur discussion of the second issue begins with a presentation of the opposingview:> Where there is movement, there is going,> And movement is found where walking takes place,> Not where going has been, nor where it has yet to occur.> Hence, going is found where walking takes place. [II.2] Here, the opponent may argue, “Certainly, going does not take place on a paththat has already been traversed, nor on one that has yet to come. Nevertheless,going is indeed found where walking presently takes place because that is wheremovement occurs. What evidence do we have? And to what does this evidencepertain? By ‘movement’ we understand the action of the legs as they step.‘Going,’ on the other hand, refers to the act of leaving behind one location andproceeding to another. Defined in this way, movement entails going, as can beseen when noticing that wherever a walker is in this type of motion, we alsoobserve going.“The property of the position is established as follows. Generally, meremovement is observed in direct perception. Moreover, such movement is notpresent on a path that has already been traversed, or on a path that has yet totravelled. In these two cases, movement has already ceased and not yet occurred,respectively. We must, therefore, conclude that it is found exclusively wherewalking takes place in the present.”It has already been explained that there is no path presently being walked uponother than what was already traversed and what has yet to be travelled. Sincethe location where walking occurs in the present itself lacks establishment, thesubject that is the basis [for this argument] is not established. Nevertheless,let us imagine that there is such a thing as a path where walking takes place inthe present. We may then consider the sentence: “Going is found in the part ofthe path that is presently being traversed, that is the location where walkingtakes place.” What we will notice is that neither the verbal phrase, [“going,”]nor the object phrase, [“where walking takes place,”] can be related to the actof going. This will be shown by demonstrating (1) that if the object phraserefers to the act of going, the verbal phrase is devoid of meaning, (2) if theverbal phrase refers to the act of going, the object phrase is devoid ofmeaning, and (3) if it is referred to by both, there will be absurdconsequences.The Object Phrase Referring to the Act of GoingOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Going where walking takes place,> How could that make sense,> When, without going, there cannot reasonably be> Any place where walking takes place? [II.3] When an agent of going, such as Devadatta, goes somewhere, there is but a singleact of going. The singular nature of the act is shown by the fact that theresult, having gone somewhere, is exclusively singular as well. There-fore,though it is meaningful to link this singular act with the object phrase “wherewalking takes place” and use this expression accordingly, since the act of goingis not twofold, the verbal phrase “going” will have become divorced from itsreferent, the act of going, and so will be rendered meaningless. How, then,could we make sense of the expression, “going is found where walking takesplace”? This statement would make as little sense as the statement, “sound ispermanent.”“Why,” one may wonder, “does the object phrase ‘where walking takes place’ haveto refer to the act of going?”To explain, consider how one cannot rightly speak of somebody as ‘rich’ if thatperson does not possess any wealth. In the same way, speaking of a place wherewalking takes place does not make sense if it is not thereby implied that theact of going is present there. To avoid this nonsensical position, the objectphrase “where walking takes place” must, therefore, necessarily refer to the actof going. The necessity of this relationship is evident from the fact that ifthe expression “where walking takes place” is disconnected from the act ofgoing, it will carry no meaning.The present stanza can also be seen to anticipate the following explanation. Letus consider that the singular act of going is referred to, and expressed by, theverbal phrase “going.” When this is the case, the object phrase “where walkingtakes place” loses its referential connection to the action. Moreover, speakingof a place where walking occurs does not make sense if it does not include areference to the act of going. Thus, this stanza can also be read as [anexplanation of the way] the object phrase is rendered meaningless.The Verbal Phrase Referring to the Act of GoingOn the second issue, the treatise states:> For whomever there is going where walking takes place,> It then follows> That there is no going where walking takes place> Because “going is found where walking takes place.” [II.4] It may be thought: “The aforementioned flaw does not occur when the verbalphrase ‘going’ refers to the act of going.” However, as explained before, thereare not two acts of going. For this reason, the object phrase “where walkingtakes place” will lose the meaning it is meant to convey and the statement“going is found where walking takes place” will then no longer make sense.The opponent holds that because the statement “where walking takes place” doesnot imply the act of going, it should be understood purely as a noun phrase.Instead, it is the verbal phrase “going” that refers to the act of walking. Forthose who take this position, however, it follows that there is no act of goingin relation to the object phrase “where walking takes place.” How so? Because a)there is only a single act of going and b) it was explained that while thephrase “where walking takes place” should be understood purely as a noun phrase,it is the verbal phrase “going” that refers to the act of going.This stanza can also be read in accordance with the explanation above,98 inwhich case the position under critique claims that the act of going pertains tothe place where walking occurs. With this position, the opponent thus holds thatthe phrase “where walking takes place” indicates the existence of going. Forthose who take this position, the assertion that the phrase “where walking takesplace” refers to the act of going leads to the conclusion that the verbal phrase“going” does not refer to the existence of the act of going. Again, this followsbecause here it is held that the phrase “where walking takes place” is linkedwith the act of going. We thus arrive at this interpretation by reading thestatement “where walking takes place” in the third line as another way ofspeaking about going. Seen in this way, this stanza also shows how the verbalphrase ends up being rendered meaningless.Both Phrases Referring to the Act of GoingOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If going took place where walking takes place,> It would follow that there are two acts of going:> One due to which there is a place with walking> And another that is the going that happens there. [II.5] > When it follows that there are two acts of going,> It follows that there are two agents of going,> Because without something that goes,> It makes no sense for there to be going. [II.6] One may then object further, “Neither of these problems occurs because bothobject- and verbal phrase involve the act of going.”If this were the case, both the object phrase “where walking takes place” andthe verbal phrase “going” would have a referent. Nevertheless it would,therefore, follow that a single agent of going performs two acts of going. Oneact qualifies the path that is walked upon, justifying the use of the phrase“where walking takes place” to refer to it. The second is the act of going overthat place and proceeding to somewhere else. Thus, we end up with two acts ofgoing. Yet this is unacceptable because if there were two acts of going, therewould also be two agents.We cannot argue that having two actions with a single agent presents noproblems. Generally, whenever an action is performed, it is done by an agent andin relation to some object. Hence, there cannot reasonably be any act of goingwithout an agent, that is, without something that goes.To this, one may respond, “Indeed, if nothing goes, there cannot reasonably bean act of going. However, a single agent performing two actions at the same timeis not a contradiction. Take the case of Devadatta, for example. Though he is asingle agent, we still observe him performing different actions at the sametime, such as looking, speaking, and sitting.”Nevertheless, while a substantially singular agent may simultaneously performseveral different actions, we will never observe the simultaneous performance oftwo actions of the same kind (such as two acts of going). Alternatively, we maysay that a substantially singular agent never performs two actions at the sametime since there is never more than a single effect, such as having gone toanother place. Both of these arguments are excellent.The Commentary99 explains that the agent is a capacity, not a substance. Hence,when a substantially singular person is engaged in numerous actions, such asspeaking and sitting, there are an equal number of capacities involved.Therefore, the example of a single agent that simultaneously performs multipleactions is not established. However, on such an explanation, the singlesubstance of the person may well include two capacities for going, and it willthen not be contradictory for there to be two acts of going as well. In thisway, the point of contention—a single substance of a person that performs twoacts of going at the same time—cannot be refuted. The earlier replies,therefore, seem preferable.Refutation through a Threefold Examination of the AgentThird is the refutation of going by means of a threefold examination of theagent. This section includes (1) an explanation that going and the agent ofgoing are coextensive, (2) a general refutation of the idea that a third-partyperson performs the act of going, and (3) a specific refutation of the notionthat the agent of going goes.Going and the Agent of Going Are CoextensiveOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If there is nothing that goes,> Going makes no sense.> In the absence of any going,> How could there be one who goes? [II.7] As explained before, all acts are performed by agents. Without an agent ofgoing,—something that goes—it makes no sense for there to be an act of going.Likewise, agents are universally classified as such in consideration of theparticular acts they perform. Hence, how could there be any agent of going ifthe act of going to which it owes its very existence is absent? [The agent ofgoing would then be as nonexistent] as space.The Commentary100 here anticipates the idea that the existence of going is dueto the existence of its support, the agent of going. Thus, this stanza is seenas a refutation of the notion that an agent of going can be used to prove theact of going.A Third Party Does Not Perform the Act of GoingOn the second issue, the treatise states:> One who goes does not go,> Nor does one who does not go.> Other than goers and nongoers,> What third party could be going? [II.8] Going is entailed by the agent of going. Who, then, is it that goes? Is it onewho goes, someone with the activity of going? Or is it one who does not go,someone with no such activity? Or, perhaps, is it a third party that ensues fromthe negation of the former two? Someone who is already one who goes does not go,for there would then have to be two actions, and there are not two acts ofgoing. Neither does someone who does not go, for such an agent would lack theact of going in the same way that space lacks it. What third party—someone whois not one who goes, and yet not someone who does not go either—could be going?One who goes and one who does not are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so nothird category can be derived from the negation of both.Those Who Go Do Not GoOne may then respond, “A nongoer does not go, and it is likewise true that nogoing is performed by some party that is neither someone who goes nor someonewho does not. Nevertheless, the one who goes does indeed go.”The refutation of this idea parallels the reasoning demonstrated above. A singleagent of going cannot, at a given point in time, perform more than a single actof going. Hence, if the verbal phrase refers to the single act of going, theagent phrase will be rendered meaningless. On the other hand, if the agentphrase refers to it, the verbal phrase loses meaning, and if linked with both,the result is absurdity. In the next section, these three consequences will beexamined individually.Linking Going to the Verbal PhraseOn the first issue, the treatise states:> When, in the absence of going,> A goer does not make sense,> The statement “going is engaged in by the one who goes”—> How could that possibly make sense? [II.9] These lines raise the question of how it could possibly make sense to say that“going is engaged in by the one who goes,” indicating that this phrase isentirely nonsensical. Why is it nonsensical? Well, someone who goes, such asDevadatta, does not perform more than a single act of going. If the verbalphrase “going is engaged in” refers to that action, then that phrase ismeaningful. However, there are not two actions, and “the one who goes” does notmake sense unless it carries a reference to going. The problem, here, is thenthat the agent phrase ends up losing its meaning. In other words, although theverbal phrase is meaningful in this case, the agent phrase is not. We will,therefore, fail to make sense of the sentence “going is engaged in by the onewho goes.”The present stanza can also be seen to indicate what is explained below,101arguing that since the term “the one who goes” does not make any sense withoutan act of going, this part of the sentence must refer to such an act. Yet, as aconsequence of making this link, there is no act of going left to be designatedby the verbal phrase “going is engaged in.” This term ends up being devoid ofmeaning.Linking Going to the Agent PhraseOn the second issue, the treatise states:> For those who hold that going is engaged in by one who goes> It would then follow that there is> One who goes in the absence of going,> For it is asserted that going is performed by one who goes. [II.10] It may be thought that such inconsistencies can be avoided by asserting that theagent phrase refers to the act of going. However, in that case the verbal phrase“going is engaged in” cannot express the meaning it should, that is, the actionof going. The phrase “going is engaged in by one who goes” could not, then,reasonably be said to make sense.This explanation is given to an opponent who holds that the agent of going islinked with the act of going. Thus, in the sentence “going is engaged in by onewho goes,” the term “one who goes” applies to the act of going. For this reason,it follows that the word “going” cannot serve to designate the act of goingbecause it is held that the agent phrase “one who goes” is linked with thesingle act of going, insofar as it expresses that meaning.Alternatively, this stanza can be seen to indicate the explanation above.According to this reading, the opponent holds that the verbal phrase “going isengaged in” refers to the single act of going. For this position, it followsthat the one who goes is unrelated to the act of going because there are not twoactions. In this case, “one who goes” is mere verbiage. The assertion, here, isthat the verbal phrase “going is engaged in” contains the sense of going. Theconsequence of this position is that the one who goes has no association withgoing. Thus, this stanza can also be interpreted to mean that the agent phraseis rendered meaningless.Linking Going to Both the Agent Phrase and the Verbal PhraseOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If going is engaged in by the one who goes,> It follows that there are two acts of going:> One that characterizes the one who goes,> And another going in that capacity. [II.11] In response, one may say, “Both of these flaws will be avoided by holding that‘the one who goes’ and ‘going is engaged in’ refer to the act of going.”However, when it is held that both of these elements in the sentence are linkedto the act of going, it follows that there are two acts of going. One act ofgoing qualifies Devadatta for the label “the one who goes,” and so makes him theagent of that action. The second is the going that he, in that capacity,subsequently performs. Hence, there are two actions here: the going [thatcharacterizes the agent] plus the going that the agent is to perform. This,however, is untenable because if there are two acts of going, there must, as wasexplained before, also be two individuals that engage in those acts of going.Refuting the Arguments for the Act of GoingThird, refuting the arguments that are advanced to prove the act of goinginvolves five separate refutations. We will begin by refuting the “initiation”that causes going to occur.Refuting the Initiation of the Act of GoingHere an idea such as the following is anticipated: “It is certainly in thenature of things that there are acts of going. We can know this from the factthat such acts are initiated. When in this way the initiation of going is usedas evidence to prove the existence of going, it is not the case that theproperty of the position and the entailment are not established. We directlyperceive that standing still comes to an end and that is precisely theinitiation of going. If going were as nonexistent as a robe made of tortoisehair, it would not make sense for it to be initiated.”Once examined and investigated, however, this argument can be shown to beunestablished. This involves demonstrating that the initiation of going is notestablished, (1) even if it is accepted that there is an object to which itrelates, and (2) that the initiation of going is not established because theobject to which it relates is not established.On the first issue, the treatise states:> Going does not begin where it has been,> Nor does it begin where it has yet to occur.> Going does not begin where walking takes place,> So where does going begin? [II.12] Let us assume that such a thing as ceasing to stand still and stepping onto thefirst part of a path, thus initiating the act of going, existed naturally. Interms of where it would take place, the beginning of such an act can beconceived of in only three ways. Going would have to be initiated on a path thathas already been tread, on one that has yet to be traversed, or on a path wherewalking is ongoing in the present.A path that has already been traversed is not where going begins because it hasceased there. Neither is going initiated on a path that has yet to be traversed,for there, the act of going has not been initiated and is still absent. It isalso contradictory for an act of going to commence where walking has yet tooccur. Going does not begin on a path where walking takes place in the presenteither because, as explained before, there is no path upon which there may bewalking in the present apart from what has already, or not yet, been tread. Ifthis is where going were initiated, it would also follow that there are two actsof going.If going does not begin on any of these three paths, where does it start?The answer that is implied here is, “nowhere.”On the second issue, the treatise states:> Before going has been initiated,> There is no place where walking occurs or has taken place> Upon which going could begin.> And how could there be going where there is none yet? [II.13] For going to begin, there must first be a place for it to occur. Before goingbegins, however, the path that has already been traversed, the one where the actof going has ceased, does not exist. Similarly, there is no path where goingtakes place in the present either. Since these paths do not exist, going cannotbe initiated on them.“Before going has been initiated,” one may object, “there is still a path thathas yet to be traversed. That is where going is initiated.”Nevertheless, the initiation of going requires the act of going, and no such acthas been initiated on a path that has yet to be traversed. Hence, as going isnot occurring there, how could that possibly be the place where it is initiated?Refuting the Object to Which Going RelatesSecond is a refutation of the object that going relates to. On this topic, thetreatise states:> Since we never witness a beginning of going> How can we conceive of the traversed,> Of what is being traversed,> And what has yet to be traversed? [II.14] This stanza anticipates the following objection: “You have not explicitlyrefuted the existence of the object to which going relates, namely, the pathsthat are covered in the past, future, and present. Therefore, going by naturedoes indeed exist because these three paths exist. This argument, moreover, doesnot lack entailment because the act of going is the cause for the designation ofthese three paths.”In response, it is shown how the evidence presented in this argument, that is,the natural existence of the three paths, is itself not established. As wasexplained earlier, the initiation of going can never be witnessed or perceivedfrom the perspective of reason. How, then, can we conceive of a path where theact of going has ceased, that is, a path that has already been traversed?Likewise, how should we conceive of a path where the act of going has not beeninitiated and which has yet to be traveled? Finally, how may we imagine a pathupon which going has occurred and not yet ceased, a path that is being walkedupon in the present? Indeed, the implication here is that there is nothing toconceive of in any way at all.Refutation of the Result, StoppingThird is a refutation of the result of going, stopping. On this topic, thetreatise states:> Stopping does not occur where walking takes place,> Where going has been, or where it has yet to occur. [II.17a–b] “The act of going exists by nature,” one may think, “because its result,stopping, exists. Moreover, it is not the case that the property of the positionand the entailment are not established. The commencement of standing still isdirectly perceived, and that commencement is itself the cessation of going.Moreover, the stopping that results cannot occur without its cause, namely,going, just as one who has not observed a pure lifestyle cannot later stop doingso.”Two stanzas below, it is shown how the evidence presented in this argument isnot established since once we subject it to analysis we will find that there isno stopping. Stopping does not occur on a path that has already been traversed,or on one that has yet to be traveled. On the first, the act of going hasceased, while on the second it has yet to occur. Stopping does not occur on apath where walking is presently taking place either. Such a path does not existbecause we will fail to observe any path where walking occurs in the presentapart from what has and has not been traversed. Locating stopping on a pathwhere walking is presently taking place, moreover, would also entail that thereare two acts of going: one that is the act of walking along the path and anotherthat is stopping.Refutation of That Which Counters GoingFourth, refuting that which counters going, the treatise states:> The one who goes does not stand still,> Nor does one who does not go.> Aside from those that do and do not go,> What third party could stand still? [II.15] > In the absence of going,> There cannot reasonably be anyone who goes.> How, then, could it reasonably be said> That it is the one who goes who stands still? [II.16] “Standing still counters going,” it may be thought, “yet this has not yet beenexplicitly refuted. Therefore, because something that makes it stop exists,going has a natural existence as well, for something that does not exist cannotbe countered, just as the son of the barren woman cannot have an enemy.”In response, it is explained that this evidence is not established. The reason,here, is that when the act of standing still is examined with reference to thethree possible types of agent, as was done in an earlier section, the act ofstanding still will be seen to be nonexistent. The one who goes cannot also bestanding still because going and standing still are incompatible. Moreover,someone who is not going cannot not stand still either because there would haveto be two acts of standing still were this to take place, and this is not thecase. Finally, apart from those who go and those who do not, what third partycould stand still? Since being and not being someone who goes are directlycontradictory, the existence of a third party that ensues from the negation ofthe former two is impossible.One may then object, “While nongoers and third parties do not get to standstill, those who are involved in going do.”Let us explain the contradictory nature of this notion. A sentence such as “xstands here” indicates the presence of the act of standing still. Moreover, italso affirms the absence of going, for the act of going is incompatible withstanding still. Therefore, in a situation where the act of going is absent, itwould be meaningless to say that there is someone who goes. In such a situation,to speak only of standing still would be meaningful, but the words “the one whogoes” would be meaningless. How, then, would we make sense of the sentence, “Itis the one who goes who stands still”? Indeed, this statement is nonsensical.Refuting the Arguments for That Which Counters GoingFifth is a refutation of the arguments for that which counters going. Thetreatise states:> With going, beginning, and stopping,> The case is the same as with going. [II.17c–d] There are three parts here. First, it may be thought that standing still, thatwhich counters going, has a natural existence since its counterpart, going,exists. This idea is shown to be untenable by refuting the argument advanced tosupport it. In other words, going, as that which counters standing still, isrefuted in the same manner as before, in which standing still, as the contraryto going, was refuted. Hence, whereas before it was argued that, “The one whogoes does not stand still,” the argument now becomes, “The one who stands stilldoes not go, nor does one who does not stand still.” In this way, stanzasfifteen and sixteen turn into a refutation of the natural existence of standingstill.Second, these lines also anticipate the notion that standing still, the contraryto going, exists because there is something that causes it, namely, theinitiation of standing still. The refutation of this cause, the initiation ofstanding still, is equivalent to the one applied to the initiation of going.Whereas before it was, “Going does not begin where it has been,” we may nowread, “Standing still does not begin where it has been.” Thus, stanzas twelvethrough fourteen turn into a refutation of the initiation of standing still,which is what counters going.Third, one may seek to prove the existence of standing still by arguing: “Thatwhich counters going, standing still, has a natural existence because standingstill eventually stops.”The refutation of this argument parallels the one explained in relation to thestopping of going. The natural existence of stopping going was refuted byarguing, “Stopping does not occur where walking takes place, where going hasbeen, or where it has yet to occur.” Hence, the refutation of what countersstanding still now becomes, “Going does not occur where there is standing still,where standing still has been, or where it has yet to occur.”In this way, the very refutations of that which counters going, the initiationthat causes going, and the stopping that results also serve as refutations ofthe same factors in relation to standing still, which is what counters going.Hence, these verses can be read as saying, “With the contrary, beginning, andstopping, the case is the same as with going.”Is Going Identical to or Different from Its Support?In this fourth section, the refutation of going involves examining whether agentand action are identical or different. The treatise states:> The act of going and the one who goes> Cannot rightly be said to be the same.> The act of going and the one who goes> Cannot rightly be said to be different. [II.18] > If that which is the going> Were also the one who goes,> It would follow that agent and act> Would be one and the same. [II.19] > Yet if the going and goer> Are thought to be different,> There could be going without something that goes> And someone who goes in the absence of going. [II.20] > When two things cannot be> Established as identical,> Yet not as different things either,> How can they be established at all? [II.21] In the preceding verses, the thesis is presented first. The act of going and itssupport, the one who goes, cannot rightly be claimed to be identical in essence,yet they cannot rightly be considered essentially different either. Why not?Well, if that which is the act of going were identical with the one who goes, itwould universally follow that all agents are essentially the same as theiractivities. In other words, they would be the same as the actions they perform.The entailment of this argument is ensured by an equivalence of identicalreasons. This notion is untenable because, to give one example, a woodcutterwould end up being essentially the same as the act of cutting wood. This,however, stands in direct opposition to what we see.If, on the other hand, the act of going and the one who goes are thought to beessentially different, these two would have to be independent of one another. Itwould then follow that there can be an act of going without there being anysupport for it, that is, anyone who goes. Likewise, there could also be someonewho goes in the absence of going. However, we do not observe anything of thissort. Thus, since action and agent are mutually dependent, they cannot beestablished as essentially different.It might be thought that while the one who goes and the act of going cannot besaid to be either identical or different, they nevertheless are existent bynature. Yet that will not do either. As was already explained, when two things,such as the act of going and the one who goes, cannot be established as eitherthe same or different, how can they be existent by nature? The negation of twodirectly contradictory notions cannot possibly lead to the establishment of athird category.Is Going Singular or Multiple?Fifth is a refutation of the act of going by examining whether it is singular ormultiple. The treatise states:> The one who goes does not engage in the going> That characterizes him as someone who goes,> Because there is no one who goes before going.> Someone goes somewhere. [II.22] > The one who goes does not engage in going other than> The going that characterizes him as someone who goes,> The reason being that for a single agent of going,> It does not make sense for there to be two acts. [II.23] > Someone who goes does not engage> In any of the three kinds of going.> Someone who does not go does not engage> In any of the three kinds of going. [II.24] > Someone who does and does not go does not engage> In any of the three kinds of going either. [II.25a–b] One may then respond, “We may say that ‘a speaker utters an expression’ or ‘anagent performs an action.’ Just so, going as well exists as an act that isperformed by an agent.”Now, when someone who goes performs the act of going, is this act then the sameas the one that characterizes him or her as someone who goes or is it different?First, Devadatta does not engage in the act of going that characterizes him assomeone who goes, that is, the going that qualifies him for the label “someonewho goes.” A potter can make pots because he exists prior to the pot he makes.Likewise, if a given agent of going were to exist prior to the act of going thatcharacterizes him or her as such, then that previously existent individual couldperform the act of going to a given location, such as a town or a city. Thus,the fourth line in the stanza shows the argument’s reverse entailment. The thirdline presents the evidence: The agent of going does not exist as an agent ofgoing prior to the act of going that qualifies him or her as such an agent. Theimplication here is that there cannot be someone who goes independent of the actof going. This way of reversing the last two lines, and so reading them asrespectively the reverse entailment and the evidence, is the approach of theCommentary.Secondly, apart from the act of going that characterizes and qualifies Devadattaas someone who goes, that is, the one that shows that he is the agent of thataction, there is no other act of going being performed. It does not make sensefor there to be two acts of going: one that qualifies a goer such as Devadattaas someone who goes and another going that this goer engages in.Furthermore, neither does it make sense for someone who goes to engage in theact of going. The reasoning, here, is as follows: Someone who is a goer byvirtue of his or her being engaged in the act of going does not engage in any ofthe three types of going. In other words, this person does not engage in an actof going that is already an action, one that is not yet an action, or one thatboth is and is not an action. The same is true when we consider someone who doesnot go, someone not engaged in the act of going. Such a nongoer does not engagein any of these three types of going. Finally, someone who both does and doesnot go, someone who both is and is not engaged in going, does not engage in anyof these three kinds of going either.In the chapter that analyzes actions and agents, the notions that the act ofgoing is performed by someone who is already someone who goes, by someone who isnot, and by someone who both is and is not someone who goes are likewise allrefuted. In that chapter, it is argued:> That which is an agent would have no activity.> There would also be action without an agent.102 Likewise:> If one that is not an agent performs,> The agent will lack its cause.103 And:> Since being and not being are incompatible in one thing,> How could this ever be the case?104 The ideas that something that is already an act, something that is not an act,and something that both is and is not an act can be performed are alsoaddressed. Dispensing with these ideas, the text states:And:> That which is an action is not performed,> So the agent would be lacking its action.105and:> If something that is not an action is performed> The action will lack its cause.106 and:> Since being and not being are incompatible in one thing,> How could this ever be the case?107 CONCLUSIONThis second section relates to the chapter’s conclusion. The treatise states:> There is, therefore, no going,> No one who goes, and nothing traversed. [II.25c–d] Thus, as explained above, once we have investigated the matter with reasoning,we find no act of going, no agent engaging in such an act, and no foundation forthe activity (that is, no path that is traversed).SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE Having explained the progression of the text, we may now offer a summary of thethird topic: the significance of this chapter. Here, we have seen explicitrefutations of the objects of the act of going and coming as they pertain to thethree times, of the three categories that pertain to the agent, of the act andits agent being either the same or different, and of the act itself beingsingular or multiple. As a result, any going and coming that occurs withindependent origination in reality has been existentially negated. Similarly, ithas also been affirmed that the appearance of going and coming pertains to therelative and resembles an illusion. Implicitly, this also serves as an excellentanalysis of all active phenomena by considering the objects to which thesephenomena relate in terms of the three times.Moreover, a phenomenon without a function is impossible. Thus, we findstatements such as the following:> That which does not act is equal to the nonexistent.108 As well as:> Apart from what originates dependently,> There are no phenomena at all.109 In terms of reality, the present chapter therefore existentially negates allconstructs associated with the full range of outer and inner phenomena, whilewith respect to the relative it establishes illusion-like dependent origination.Thus, as was the case with the previous chapter, it serves to engender anunmistaken insight into the two truths. In the process, it reveals the fullsignificance of the following passage from the Sūtra Taught by Akṣayamati:> Venerable Śāriputra, “coming” means assembling, “going” means separating. That> which cannot be described as either “assembling” or “separating” knows neither> coming nor going. Indeed, this absence of coming and going is the going of the> noble ones. This concludes the explanation of the second chapter, the analysis of going andcoming, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.98.

Of these three, the sense sources are analyzed first, and the notionthat they have naturally established essences is refuted.THE CONTEXT OF THE CHAPTER The treatment of this chapter is also threefold. First, we will consider thechapter’s context. With respect to the profound sūtras, this chapter relates toa teaching from the Mother of the Victorious Ones, which states, “There is noeye, no ear.…” Similarly, the Noble Sūtra Requested by Upāli states:> The eye sees no forms> And the mind knows no phenomena.> The supreme truth resides> Where the world has no access. And:> In dependence on light, the eye sees all sorts> Of attractive and unattractive forms.> As its seeing is thus dependent,> The eye never sees any form. This chapter employs reasoning to ascertain the meaning of such statements.In terms of its relationship to the other chapters, this analysis can be seen asa response to the following objection: “You may have refuted going, the one whogoes, and the path traversed. Nevertheless, the Abhidharma teaches the naturalexistence of sight, the one who sees, seen objects, and other such factors.”Thus, this chapter serves to refute the natural existence of these factors.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 3 The explanation of the content of this chapter includes (1) a presentation ofthe opposition’s view and (2) a refutation of this view.THE VIEW OF THE OPPOSITION The schools of the listeners believe in the natural existence of the externaland internal sense sources, such as sight and the seen object. They support thisclaim by referring to sūtras of Abhidharma that teach:> Sight, hearing, smell,> Taste, touch, and cognition—> The experiential domain of these six faculties> Are the objects that are seen and so forth. [III.1] Sight refers to the eye faculty, that which sees forms. Some schools hold thatthe physical faculty is the [actual] observer, while others consider it acontributor to sight The same difference of opinion pertains to the remaininginner sense sources as well.REFUTATION OF THE OPPOSITION’S VIEW Second, it will be proven that the aforementioned is an expedient teaching sincesight and the rest of the outer and inner sense sources lack naturalestablishment. This involves (1) a refutation of the natural establishment ofsight and (2) an extension of this analysis to other topics. The first of theseentails refuting the beliefs that the eye is (1) the one that sees or (2) theproducer of sight. The first of these includes (1) a refutation by means of theevidence that the eye does not see itself and (2) a refutation through examiningwhether the eye is of the nature of sight. The first refutation involves (1)presenting the evidence in a way that establishes the property of the position,(2) demonstrating that this evidence is not inconclusive, and (3) drawing theconclusion.The Eye’s Failure to See ItselfOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Sight does indeed not see> Its own identity.> How can something that does not see itself> See anything else either? [III.2] As indicated in the following verses, the Proponents of Differences believe thatthe eye faculty with its support, consciousness, is the agent in the seeing offorms:> The sense faculties with support> Are the perceivers of visual forms,> Not the supported consciousness,> Because no form is seen where there is an obstruction.110 The eye faculty that sees, however, does not see its own identity. The reasonsfor this are that it would be contradictory for something to take itself as anobject, and we do not observe any such seeing.How, then, could the eye faculty see a form or anything else? Indeed, it cannot.The evidence presented here is the fact that the eye does not see itself, as isthe case with a vase. The entailment is established by pointing out that sincethe vase and the eye are the same in not seeing themselves, there is no soundreason why one of them should, in reality, see and the other not. Thus, theentailment is in terms of the previously explained sameness of reason and theentailment of a single conceptual distinction being equally relevant in the caseof “other.” Some111 teach that this equals the mind’s failure to know anythingelse unless it knows itself.The Evidence Is Not InconclusiveOn the second issue, the treatise states:> A solid establishment of sight cannot> Be provided through the example of fire.> With what was, has yet to be, and is being traversed> We have replied to that along with sight. [III.3] “That something does not see itself does not preclude it from seeing otherthings,” one may object. “Fire, for example, does not burn itself, yet we cansee that it burns firewood.”However, the example of fire burning other things without burning itself doesnot fully establish the idea that sight sees other things without seeing itself.Earlier we refuted the notions of acts of going that occur on paths that havealready been traversed, that have yet to be traversed, or that are beingtraversed in the present. This reasoning has already responded to and refutedthe example presented here, namely, fire burning a fuel that is something otherthan itself.How about examining the object that the burning relates to, that is, firewood,in terms of the three times? We would then say, “Where there has been burning,there is none.” We could also undertake a threefold examination of the fire, theagent of burning, in which case we would say, “One that burns does not burn.”These analyses show that fire does not burn something else, that is, firewood.In fact, these analyses do not only respond to and refute this example but alsowhat it represents—the case of sight. We may just as well say, “Where there hasbeen sight, there is none” and “One that sees does not see,” thereby examiningthe place where seeing occurs with reference to the three times and the threetypes of agent of seeing, respectively. These examinations demonstrate theuntenability of the idea that the eye sees forms that are different from itself.Drawing the ConclusionOn the third issue, the treatise states:> When nothing at all is seen,> Neither is there one that sees.> “Sight is what performs seeing,”> How could this be right? [III.4] In reading the conclusion, we may reverse the two halves of this stanza. Thus,some might say that since the eye sees forms, it is the one that sees. Yet howcould that be right, for when nothing at all is seen, neither is there one thatsees.Is the Eye of the Nature of Seeing?On the second issue, the treatise states:> Sight does not see,> Yet nonsight does not see either. [III.5a–b] Furthermore, if the eye is thought to see forms, does it do so by virtue ofbeing intrinsically involved in, and so of the nature of, the act of seeing? Oris the eye something that is related to seeing, yet not itself intrinsically ofthe nature of sight? That which sees a given form is not an eye with the natureof sight because there are not two acts of seeing. Neither is that which sees aneye that is not of the nature of seeing because such an eye is just asuninvolved in seeing as the fingers are. This stanza should be linked with theconclusion stated above.Does the Eye Create Seeing?Second is the refutation of the view that the eye creates seeing. The Followersof Sūtra and others argue that the eye is indeed not that which sees. Rather,they hold that the eye produces seeing and, in that capacity, allowsconsciousness or the self to become that which sees forms. Here, however, it isshown that, since there is nothing that sees, it does not make sense to speak ofthe eye as something that creates seeing. This includes (1) a refutation of theproposed agents of seeing by means of the previously explained reasoning, (2) arefutation of these agents through a reasoning not explained before, and (3) aconclusion to the refutation of that which sees.The Previously Explained ReasoningOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Know that sight itself> Also explains the one that sees. [III.5c–d] Earlier, the notion that the eye faculty sees form was refuted. It should beunderstood that the same reasoning also explains the refutation of other agentsof seeing, such as consciousness or the self. For example, we may change thewording of the second stanza to the following: “The one that sees does indeednot see its own identity. How can something that does not see itself …” In thisway, it becomes a refutation of the positions that hold consciousness or theself to be that which sees forms.A Reasoning Not Explained BeforeOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Whether seeing is involved or not,> There is nothing that sees.> Without the one that sees,> How could there be something seen and seeing? [III.6] If there is something that sees, such as consciousness, does it depend onseeing, or is it independent of it? Something that sees, which involves seeing(that is, depends on seeing), does not exist. The reason for this is as follows:> How could an entity that is established in dependence> Depend on something when it is not established?> If it is said that it depends while established,> Its dependence does not make any sense.112 As will be explained below, either nothing is established, as is the case withthe sky flower, or any sense of dependence is lost. Therefore, we may concludethat neither an unestablished nor an established observer can reasonably dependon seeing.On the other hand, something that sees does not exist without seeing, that is,independently of seeing, because without that we lack the reason for classifyingit as such, just as we lack the same reason in the case of a vase.Conclusion to the Refutation of That Which SeesOn the third issue, the treatise states:> As there is nothing to see and no sight,> The four, such as consciousness, do not exist.> How could appropriation and other> Such factors come into existence? [III.7] “This project of invalidating all phenomena associated with sight has,” it maybe objected, “included a refutation of that which sees, but the object and theproducer of seeing have not been negated. These do exist.”However, if, as explained before, that which sees does not exist, how couldthere possibly be any natural establishment of those things that depend on thatwhich sees, such as the seen object and the eye faculty that produces sight?These three are established in mutual dependence. Nevertheless, it may still bethought: “Well, those two have been invalidated. Nevertheless, the Sūtra on [theDiscernment of] Dependent Origination teaches that consciousness manifests basedon the eye and form, just as a child is produced based on its father and mother.Therefore, would not the seen object and the faculty of sight also exist, giventhat the four effects of these two—consciousness, contact, sensation, andcraving—all exist.”As was explained before, neither the form that is the object of sight nor theeye that produces sight exist. It has, therefore, also been established that thestated four effects of these two have no natural existence. However, one maystill think, “Be that as it may, factors such as appropriation, becoming, andaging and death are all caused by the aforementioned four factors, and thoseeffects do indeed exist.”Nevertheless, previously we certainly did not say that there is any existence ofconsciousness and the other factors that are said to cause these effects. Whenthere are no causes, how could something, such as appropriation, possiblymanifest as an effect? Indeed, such things are utterly nonexistent!Extending the Analysis to Other TopicsExtending this analysis to other topics, the treatise states:> Hearing, smell,> Taste, touch, and cognition;> The hearer, the heard, and so forth—> Know that all are explained through sight. [III.8] Thus, this refutation can be applied equally to all of these elements. We may,for example, just as well say, “Hearing does indeed not hear its own identity.”SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE To summarize, in refuting sight, the seen object, and so forth, the presentchapter has presented an explicit existential negation of the mental constructsassociated with the true reality of the outer and inner sense sources. Likewise,it has affirmed that the appearance of the sense sources is relative andillusion-like. Implicitly, it has presented an existential negation, in terms ofthe ultimate, of the constructs associated with the full range of activephenomena, as was previously explained. In so doing, it has also affirmedillusion-like dependent origination in terms of the mere relative. The Sūtra ofthe King of Meditative Absorptions discusses this point in the passage thatbegins:> Based on the eye and form,> Visual consciousness arises. And continuing to the lines:> Emptiness without any coming and going,> Like an illusion, this is what the yogin sees. This concludes the explanation of the third chapter, the analysis of faculties,in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.110. Vasubandhu, Treasury of Abhidharma, I.40.111.

Root of the Middle Way, X.11."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE AGGREGATESTHE ANALYSIS of the aggregates will also be treated in three sections, the firstof which concerns the context of the chapter.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 4 The analysis of the aggregates relates to teachings of the profound sūtras, suchas the following line from the Mother of the Victorious Ones:> Subhūti, form is empty by nature. And this passage in the King of Meditative Absorptions:> The aggregates are devoid of nature; they are emptiness.> Enlightenment is devoid of nature; it is emptiness.> That which experiences is empty of nature as well.> This is known by the wakeful, not by the immature. It is the significance of such statements that will here be established throughreasoning.As for this chapter’s relationship to the other chapters in the text, theanalysis of the aggregates can be seen as a reply to an objection such as thefollowing, “Well, you have refuted the outer and inner sense sources, yet thesūtras of Abhidharma still state, ‘What are conditioned phenomena? They are thefive aggregates.’ Hence, this sūtra teaches that the five aggregates exist bynature. Moreover, since the aggregates are included in the sense sources, thismeans that the sense sources also exist by nature.”This present chapter shows that since the aggregates themselves cannot beestablished to be existent by nature, the meaning of the aforementionedscripture is expedient.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 4 Second, the explanation of the chapter’s content involves (1) refuting thenature of form, (2) extending this analysis to other topics, and (3) subsidiaryinstructions on superior debate methods.THE NATURE OF FORM The first of these includes (1) a refutation of the notion that causal andresultant forms are different from one another by generally acknowledging thatsince the aggregates are included in the conditioned, they are both cause andeffect, (2) a refutation of existent and nonexistent causes and effects, and (3)a refutation of similar and dissimilar causes and effects.Causal and Resultant Forms Do Not Have Distinct NaturesThe first issue has two subdivisions. We begin with the refutation of the notionthat resultant forms are something other than causal forms. On this topic, thetreatise states:> Apart from the cause of form,> Form is not observed. [IV.1a–b]> If there were form apart from its causes,> It would follow that form has no cause.> Yet there are no objects at all> That do not have causes. [IV.2] The genuine thesis presented here is as follows. Apart from the causes of form(that is, the causal forms of the four elements), no essentially distinctresultant forms can be observed. Resultant forms, here, are either the tenelemental transformations (the five objects and the five faculties) or,alternately, the same ten elemental transformations plus the category ofnonassociated formations posited by certain schools.To establish the rationale of this thesis, let us consider the view thatresultant forms are in fact established as something other than causal forms. Ifthat were the case, they would be independent of causal forms. Being establishedas something other than causal forms, these resultant forms would be asdifferent from them as a vase is from a woolen blanket.“Resultant forms are different than causal forms,” it may then be argued, “butthat does not contradict the fact that the former depends on the latter.Likewise, sprouts are different than seeds, and yet they depend on them.”Even if we accept that sprouts depend on seeds in a conventional sense, the twowould still not be established as verily different from one another. Thisconclusion is based on our previous refutation of the belief that effects aredifferent from their causes, a refutation that was undertaken in terms of bothof the two truths. Moreover, if cause and effect were established as differentfrom one another, they would also be independent of each other, and if resultantforms were independent of their causes, they would be uncaused. Nevertheless,nowhere, throughout all space and time, does any such thing as an uncausedvisual form, or some other uncaused sense object, exist. This we know from thefact that both spatial and temporal restrictions on the occurrence of things canbe observed. Hence, the reversal [of this consequence] can be established asfollows: Because resultant forms depend on their causes, causal forms, theycannot be established as something other than those causes.Second is the refutation of causal form being established as something otherthan resultant form. The treatise states:> Likewise, aside from so-called form,> No cause of form can be observed either. [IV.1c–d] > If, aside from form,> There were a cause of form,> There would be a cause with no effect,> Yet there are no causes without effects. [IV.3] The genuine thesis presented here is as follows: Aside from so-called resultantforms, we do not perceive any essentially different causes of form, meaning anyessentially different causal forms of the four major elements, from theperspective of thorough analysis. The rationale for this thesis becomes evidentby considering the belief that there are causes of form that are not themselvesresultant forms. If this were the case, these causes would be independent oftheir effects. The entailment, here, is the same as in the previous section. Itis unacceptable for there to be a cause of form independent of form because anyidentification of something’s being a “cause” requires and depends on thepresence of an effect. Similarly, any use of the term “father” necessitates arelationship to a child. For this reason, it is concluded that causes that areindependent of effects are as nonexistent as the sky flower.Simply refuting the notion that cause and effect are substantially differentfrom one another is generally insufficient to show that cause and effect are notestablished by nature. To do that, one would also have to refute the notion thatthey are substantially identical. In the present context, however, no suchrefutation is found. This may be because the latter refutation is consideredsimple or, alternatively, because in this context the tenets of our owntradition are being refuted, and these tenets do not include the misconceptionthat cause and effect are substantially identical.Existent and Nonexistent Causes and EffectsThe second section includes (1) a refutation of the causes of existent andnonexistent effects, (2) a refutation of uncaused effects, and (3) a conclusion.On the first issue, the treatise states:> When form exists,> A cause of form does not make sense,> Yet when form does not exist,> A cause of form does not make sense either. [IV.4] If there were such a thing as the cause of form, would it then produce anexistent or nonexistent resultant form? If the resultant form exists, it wouldmake no sense for it to have a cause. Causes serve to bring their effects intobeing, so if a given effect is existent, it would be meaningless for it to havea cause. On the other hand, if a given resultant form does not exist, it wouldnot make sense for it to have a cause either. The act of producing cannot berelated to something like a sky flower, which does not provide any basis for it.Hence, the nonexistent cannot be created. Moreover, as was explained before, ifthere is no effect there cannot be any cause either.On the second issue, the treatise states:> A form without a cause is impossible,> Utterly impossible. [IV.5a–b] In a similar manner, here it is asked whether resultant forms are held to haveexistent or nonexistent causes. The first cannot be the case, however, given theprevious explanation that there are definitely no causes at the time of theirrespective effects. How about the second idea? Well, a form that does not havecauses makes no sense when examined, yet it does not make sense from anunexamined perspective either because what we see, we see only occasionally.On the third issue, the treatise states:> Therefore, do not give rise> To any thoughts about form at all. [IV.5c–d] When we investigate causal and resultant forms, it becomes clear that there arenone. The yogin who wishes to recognize reality should, therefore, not give riseto any thought whatsoever about form being a particular way, that it isdelightful or repulsive, obstructive or not obstructive, demonstrable or notdemonstrable, past or future, blue or yellow, and so on. There is no basis forsuch distinctions. Hence, thoughts of this kind are similar to concerns aboutwhether a donkey’s horn is sharp or blunt. This stanza can also suitably betaken as conclusion to the chapter as a whole.Similar and Dissimilar Causes and EffectsOn the third issue, the treatise states:> It is not right to say> That effects resemble their causes.> It is not right to say> That effects do not resemble their causes. [IV.6] Here it is asked whether the causes of form produce effects that resemble them.It would not be right to say that effects resemble their causes because thecharacteristics of the causal forms of the four elements differ from those ofthe resultant forms of the five faculties and five objects. Thus, [the earelement], for example, is characterized by solidity, whereas the [eye faculty]is a buoyant form that supports eye consciousness. Moreover, the five objectsare the objects of distinct faculties. The characteristics of the causal andresultant forms are, thus, as different from each other as existence is frompeace. Moreover, we never witness causes and effects that resemble each other inthe way that, for example, śālu seeds do when they are present at the same time.Finally, neither is it right to say that resultant forms are produced by causalforms that they do not resemble. With no resemblance, such a situation would bethe same as with existence and peace.EXTENDING THIS ANALYSIS TO OTHER TOPICS The second issue concerns how we may extend this analysis to other topics. Thetreatise states:> With feeling, identification, formation,> Mind, and all things> The steps are, in all regards,> The same as in the case of form. [IV.7] Feeling and the contact that causes it, identification and the consciousnessthat accompanies it, formation and ignorance, the consciousness of the primarymind versus formation—all of these we may examine to see if they are the same ordifferent. If we do, we will find that neither of these options makes sense. Thesteps involved in this process will be exactly the same as they were in the caseof form. In fact, we may investigate anything, including characteristics and thebearers of characteristics, or wholes and parts, in terms of whether they arethe same, different, or otherwise, just as we have done here with the refutationof form. By following the same steps in the same way, we will come to see thatnone of these options are correct.SUPERIOR DEBATE METHOD Third, as an instruction in superior debate method, the treatise states:> When a critique is made using emptiness,> Whatever may be replied> Will not be a reply,> But the same as what is still to be proven. [IV.8] > When an explanation is given using emptiness> Whatever flaws one may find> Will not be found to be flaws,> But the same as what is still to be proven. [IV.9] The special method for countering the positions of others is to point out thatthe realist’s argument is identical to what has yet to be proven. Espousingemptiness, the representative of the Middle Way may criticize the realistposition by asking for the reason that things exist by nature. The realist maythen respond that this is because they originate dependently. Yet whatever replyis given will not be a proper one. The reason, here, is that the property of therealist’s position (something that is real and dependently originated, orwhatever else the attempted argument may have been) as well as the entailment ofthe evidence (that what appears as dependent origination exists by nature)amounts to what would still need to be proven, namely, that things exist bynature. This necessarily follows because all phenomena are emptiness inprecisely the same way that the Middle Way has shown with respect to a givenphenomenon.The superior method for demonstrating the flawlessness of our own position is toshow that the flaws found in the Middle Way are inaccurate because they take forgranted that which still needs to be proven. When the representative of theMiddle Way explains that all phenomena are emptiness, a realist may find flawwith this and object that this would render karmic causality nonexistent. Inperceiving such a flaw, however, a genuine problem is not identified. Therepresentative of the Middle Way clearly accepts the consequence that karmiccausality lacks nature. The realist then argues that this implies that therecannot be any consequences of karmic acts at the level of the relative either.At this point, however, this argument begs the question by taking for grantedthat which has yet to be proven. The inconclusive nature of this argument ismade explicit by bringing in an example such as illusion.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE The third section presents a summary of the chapter. This chapter explicitlyprovides an existential negation of the constructions of ultimate reality thatare associated with the five aggregates, while it has affirmed that theaggregates originate dependently in an illusion-like manner in terms of therelative. This has been done by demonstrating that the aggregates are notestablished when examined, for example, in terms of whether they are the same asor different from their causes.Implicitly, this chapter presents a refutation of all dependent phenomenabecause it has been shown that, for example, they are neither identical to, nordifferent from, that which they depend on. Hence, this chapter has shown thatultimately all phenomena are not established in any way that would accord withthe marks of mental constructions. It has likewise been affirmed that relativelyphenomena appear in an illusion-like way. This message also accords with theSūtra of Instruction to the Listeners:> Form is like drifting foam> And feeling like bubbles in water.> Identification can be likened to a mirage,> While formation resembles the plantain,> And consciousness is like an illusion.> Thus the Kinsman of the Sun has taught. This concludes the explanation of the fourth chapter, the analysis of theaggregates, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the MiddleWay."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTSTHE ANALYSIS of the elements will also be covered in three sections, of whichthe first concerns the chapter’s context.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 5 In terms of the profound sūtras, this chapter relates to the following passagesfrom the Mother of the Victorious Ones:> The element of earth does not exist. And:> How, you may ask, is one to understand earth and the other elements. They> should be perfectly understood to be exactly like space. Likewise, it also relates to this teaching from the King of MeditativeAbsorptions:> Able One, you have seen that the aggregates are empty,> Just as you have seen that the elements and sense sources are as well.> That the city of the faculties is devoid of marks,> That, Able One, you have likewise seen in full. Thus, this chapter employs reasoning to prove the significance of suchstatements, showing how the elements are just as empty of nature as the sourcesand aggregates.As for this chapter’s relationship to the other chapters in the text, theanalysis of the elements can be seen as a response to the following concern:“The sense sources and aggregates have indeed been negated. Nevertheless, inscripture we find the statement, ‘Great king, the individual, or person, comesdown to six elements.’113 Thus, the six elements are taught to be the basis forthe designation of the person. As these six have not been explicitly refuted,they must have natural existence. Moreover, given that the sense sources andaggregates are contained in the elements, they must exist by nature as well.”To dispel such doubts, this chapter shows that, upon examination, the elementscan be seen to be devoid of nature.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 5 Second, the explanation of the content of this chapter involves (1) a refutationof the element of space, (2) extending this analysis to the other elements, and(3) a concluding rebuke of views. The first includes (1) a refutation of thecharacteristic of space and the bearers of it, (2) a refutation of space as anestablished entity or nonentity, and (3) a conclusion. Among these threesections, the first presents (1) a refutation of the bearers of thecharacteristic, (2) a refutation of the characteristic, and (3) a conclusion.The first of these issues includes (1) showing how the characteristic has noreasonable application and (2) that if the characteristic has no application,there cannot be any bearers of it. The first of these two sections refutes theapplicability of the characteristic by (1) demonstrating that there is nocharacteristic prior to its bearer and (2) showing that the characteristiccannot apply to what bears it, to what does not bear it, or to some thirdcategory.There Are No Characteristics Prior to InstancesOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Before the characteristics of space,> There is no space whatsoever.> If it existed before its characteristics,> It would follow that it has no characteristics. [V.1]> Something without characteristics> Does not exist anywhere at all.> Since there is no thing without characteristics,> To what do the characteristics apply? [V.2] It is taught that “space is nonresistance.” In this way, the characteristics ofunconditioned space are its not being produced by causes and conditions and itsnot being tangible as something resistant or obstructive. A characteristic canapply to a bearer if the bearer is there before the characteristic. Yet beforethe presence of this characteristic, there is no space to be characterized bynonresistance. There is no such thing as a bearer of the characteristic of spacethat exists prior to its nonresistance. Given that, therefore, there is nothingthat can bear it, what then does this characteristic apply to? Similarly, itwould not make sense to say of jujubes that they are contained in a jar if thereis no such container to begin with.It may then be thought: “A characteristic and its bearer are not two differentsubstances but essentially the same; they are not a support and somethingsupported in the same way that a container and jujubes are. Therefore, thebearer does not need to precede its characteristics.”Yet this will not do because when two things are essentially the same, onecannot be the support of the other, nor can one take the other as its object.One may then object that it has not been established that the bearer does notprecede its characteristics. Yet if a given space existed as the bearer of itsown characteristics prior to the characteristics themselves, then that spacewould have no characteristics.This, however, is untenable. Nowhere throughout space and time does there exista phenomenon or thing that lacks its own characteristics. It is impossible forthere to be a phenomenon that lacks the very essence that is the special reasonfor its being given its name.Characteristics Do Not Apply to AnythingOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Characteristics do not apply to what has them,> Nor do they apply to what does not.> Neither do characteristics apply to something> Other than what does or does not have them. [V.3] Furthermore, if a given characteristic applies to something, does it apply tosomething that already has this characteristic, to something that lacks it, orto something other than these two? Characteristics do not apply where they arelacking because, like a donkey horn, that which has no characteristics could nothave any characteristics applying to it. Neither do they apply to things thathave had them from the beginning because their application would then be bothmeaningless and endless. Finally, characteristics do not apply to things thatneither possess nor lack them. Since possession and lack of possession directlycontradict one another, no third category is possible.If the Characteristic Does Not Apply, There Cannot Be Any Bearers of ItOne the second issue, the treatise states:> If characteristics have no application,> It makes no sense that there should be bearers of them. [V.4a–b] It may be thought: “Although characteristics have no application, space— thebearer of the characteristic—does indeed exist.”Yet if characteristics have no application, as explained before, their bearersdo not make sense either because it is the characteristic of the bearers tofunction as the support for characteristics.The Refutation of CharacteristicsOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If the bearers of characteristics are unreasonable,> Their characteristics cannot exist either. [V.4c–d] One may then object: “While you may have refuted the notion that characteristicsapply to their bearers, you have yet to refute the characteristics themselves.Therefore, they do indeed exist.” As explained before, the fact that thecharacteristics do not apply to anything means that space itself—as the bearer,support, or object of these characteristics—cannot reasonably exist either. Forthat very reason, the characteristics that it bears, supports, or receivescannot exist either, as is the case with the sky flower.ConclusionIn conclusion to the refutations of the bearer and the characteristic, thetreatise states:> Therefore, the bearers of characteristics do not exist,> And characteristics themselves have no existence either. [V.5a–b] As characteristics do not apply to anything, the bearer of the characteristicsof space does not exist. Since nothing bears them, these characteristicsthemselves do not exist either.Refuting the Notion That Space Can Be Established to Be an Entity or NonentityThis second section concerns the refutation of space being an established entityor nonentity. This involves refuting (1) the notion that space is an establishedentity, (2) the notion that space is an established nonentity, and (3) thesubjective apprehension of space.Refuting Space as an Established EntityOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Yet aside from bearers and characteristics> There are no entities. [V.5c–d] The Proponents of Differences assert that space is an unconditioned, permanententity. Space, however, cannot be an entity. As it has no characteristics orbearers of characteristics, space is equal to a sky flower. The property of thisposition has already been established. The entailment can be seen to beestablished from the fact that no entity exists aside from bearers and theircharacteristics. The implicit reason for this is that it is impossible for thereto be a phenomenon that has no instances and lacks the very essence that is thereason for its being given its unique name.Refuting Space as an Established NonentityOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If there is no entity,> Of what would there be no entity? [V.6a–b] The Followers of Sūtra teach that space is by nature a nonentity devoid ofefficacy. Arguing against this position, it is said: “In reality, the subject,space, is not established as nonentity either. As was just explained, it doesnot exist as an entity, and is, therefore, equal to a rabbit horn. It may thenbe objected that this argument lacks entailment because the very fact that it isnot established as an entity establishes it to be a nonentity. Yet thisobjection is not reasonable either. That which is to be negated and the negativeproperty that ensues from the negation depend upon one another, as do long andshort. Therefore, given that there is no entity to be negated, what would thenegative property, nonentity, be a negation of? Similarly, the child in a dreamis not real, and, therefore, its death is not real either.The Subjective Apprehension of SpaceOn the third issue, the treatise states:> What entity, nonentity, or otherwise> Would be the knower of entity and nonentity? [V6c–d] It may be thought: “There is a person who examines entities and nonentities, sothere must also be entities and nonentities that are examined.”Yet the subject that examines these two does not exist either. If it did, therewould have to be an entity, nonentity, or something other than an entity ornonentity that knew of and examined entities and nonentities. Entity andnonentity have, as such, already been universally refuted, and the third optionhas also been dismissed because it is impossible to derive any third categorythrough the negation of two qualities that are directly contradictory. As asūtra instructs:> See the nature of the inner as empty,> And see that which is outside as empty too.> As for the one who meditates on emptiness—> There is no such meditator at all. And:> A mind aware of the qualities> Of peace, utter peace, never occurs.> All constructs are the mind’s thinking,> So realize that the qualities defy thought. ConclusionIn conclusion, the treatise states:> Space, therefore, is not an entity, not a nonentity,> Not a bearer of characteristics, not a characteristic. [V.7a–c] Because no characteristics apply to it, space is not a bearer ofcharacteristics. Since there is no bearer of characteristics, thecharacteristics of space do not exist either. In the absence of bearer andcharacteristic, space could not be an entity, and because nothing is negated,space is not a nonentity either.EXTENDING THIS ANALYSIS TO OTHER TOPICS Extending this analysis to other topics, the treatise states:> As for the other five elements,> The case is the same as with space. [V.7c–d] All of the above holds for earth and the rest of the remaining five elements aswell. Thus, we may just as well say, “Before the characteristics of earth, thereis no earth whatsoever.”A CONCLUDING REBUKE OF VIEWS Third, in a concluding rebuke of views, the treatise states:> The feebleminded who see> Things in terms of existence and nonexistence> Fail to see what is to be seen—> The peace of complete pacification. [V.8] The present line of reasoning has established that all outer and inner phenomenaare, in reality, devoid of the constructions of characteristics and theirbearers and of existent and nonexistent things. Nevertheless, the feebleminded,whose eye of cognition is damaged by ignorance, view the inner and outerentities that constitute the relative in terms of either real existence orcomplete nonexistence. They thereby fail to see what is to be seen—the ultimateand the natural transcendence of suffering, the peace that is the completepacification of verbal and mental constructs—just as the blind are unable to seethe sun. Therefore, in terms of the relative, they have no chance to achieveeither the mere peace of having relinquished the extreme of existence or thenonabiding transcendence of suffering that comes with the relinquishment of boththe extremes of existence and peace. Hence, those who pursue the transcendenceof suffering should train in the complete separation from existence andnonexistence and all other such extremes, as was previously explained. This isalso taught in the Sūtra of the King of Meditative Absorptions:> So-called existence and nonexistence are extremes,> Just as clean and unclean are dual extremes.> “Existence” and “nonexistence” are argumentation.> Clean and unclean are argumentation as well.> Arguments do not pacify suffering,> But when arguments disappear, suffering ends. SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE The summary of this chapter’s significance can be understood by following thesame approach that was used in the previous chapters.This concludes the explanation of the fifth chapter, the analysis of theelements, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.113. From the Sūtra of the Meeting of Father and Son."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF DESIRE AND THE DESIROUS ONETHE SELF of phenomena has now been negated by refuting the essences of theaggregates, elements, and sense sources. The next three analyses are concernedwith refuting counterarguments. The first of these, the analysis of desire andthe desirous one, serves as a refutation of the nature of the subject associatedwith these factors or as a refutation of the nature of the resultant affliction.This chapter will also be discussed in three sections.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 6 The present chapter relates to the profound sūtras by using reasoning toascertain the meaning of certain teachings, such as the following passage fromthe King of Meditative Absorptions:> Desire, the object of desire, and the desirous one—these phenomena are not> seen or observed in accordance with reality. The same scripture also teaches:> Understanding that the essences of desire, anger, conceit, and stupor> Are produced by thought and mistaken engagements,> They do not conceive of them and do not separate from desire. Such meditators> are all things. As for its relation to the other analyses, the present chapter can be seen as areply to opinions such as the following: “You have negated the sense sources,aggregates, and elements. Nevertheless, all of these do indeed exist, for withinthese factors we find subjects that suffer from desire and the other causes ofthe affliction of action and birth. A sūtra teaches:> Monks, immature ordinary individuals who are not learned suffer from a> continuous fall. As their eyes see forms, they fixate on what they see as a> source of pleasure for the mind, thereby creating desire. This, in turn, forms> the physical, verbal, and mental actions that arise out of desire. If objects were as nonexistent as the child of a barren woman, the occurrence ofthe afflictions would make no sense.”This chapter was composed to show that when the afflictions are themselvessubjected to examination, they are seen to be unestablished.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 6 The explanation of this chapter’s content includes (1) a refutation of desireand the desirous one and (2) an extension of this analysis to other topics. Thefirst topic contains two further divisions: a refutation of the notion thatdesire and the desirous one occur (1) in sequence and (2) that they coexist.The Sequential Manifestation of Desire and the Desirous OneOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If, before the presence of desire,> The desirous one exists without desire,> Based on that, there would be desire.> When the desirous one exists, so does desire. [VI.1] > Yet if the desirous one does not exist,> How could there possibly be desire?> Given the presence or absence of desire,> This follows also in the case of the desirous one. [VI.2] Let us assume that desire, the mental state that takes delight in qualities thatare not genuine, has a nature of its own. We may then ask whether its support,the desirous one (that is, the primary consciousness that desires), exists priorto desire or subsequent to it.With the first alternative, the desirous one would be present in a desire-lessstate prior to the desire. If this were the case, the supportive primaryconsciousness that is the desirous one would be preestablished, and thesupported mental state of desire would then come to exist based on that. Hence,the idea here is that desire is preceded by the desirous one.Nevertheless, someone without desire cannot possibly be desirous. If this werepossible, even a noble foe destroyer could be desirous. Therefore, in the end,the presence of the desirous one entails the presence of desire.Second, how could there possibly be desire if the one that desires, that is theone that supports this emotion, does not precede it? Likewise, if there is nofruit to support it, there can be no ripening. The idea that the desirous onecan exist in the absence of desire is untenable.In this way, we have noticed that, given either the presence or absence of thedesirous one, there can be no desire. Yet the same problems follow if weconsider the support, the one that desires, in light of either a precedingpresence or absence of the supported desire. Given the preceding presence orabsence of desire, it does not make sense that there is something that desires.It may be held that before the presence of the desirous one, desire existswithout a desirous one. In that case there could, on that basis, be somethingthat is desirous. Thus, it might be reasonable to claim that desire precedes thedesirous one. However, there cannot possibly be any prior existence of desirebecause without someone who desires there would be no basis for desire. Therecan likewise be no ripening if there is no fruit that can function as the basisfor ripening to begin with.If the opposite is the case, and there is no desire to begin with, how couldthere possibly be someone that desires? If it were possible for the desirous oneto exist even in the absence of desire, then a noble foe-destroyer could bedesirous as well.The Coexistence of Desire and the Desirous OneAs for the second issue, some hold that desire and the desirous one do not occurin sequence. Instead they see them as an instance of the type of causalityreferred to in this statement:> Those that arise together are the effect of each other.114 According to this position, the mind produces a coexistent mental state ofdesire, which, in turn, by its presence is responsible for the mind beingdesirous.The refutation of this position relates to (1) the consequence that these twowill then lack mutual dependence and (2) the untenability of identical anddifferent things occurring in coexistence.The Lack of Mutual DependenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Desire and the desirous one> Cannot reasonably arise together.> In this case, desire and the desirous one> Would not depend on one another. [VI.3] Desire and the desirous one cannot reasonably coexist. If they did, desire andthe desirous one would be as independent of one another as the right and lefthorns of a cow. Desire and the desirous one are, however, seen to be mutuallydependent by nonanalytical direct perception. Therefore, it does not make senseto say that they coexist.Neither Identical nor Different Things Can CoexistThe second issue involves (1) a general refutation of the coexistence ofidentical and different things and (2) a specific refutation of the coexistenceof different things.The Coexistence of Identical and Different ThingsOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Identical things are not coexistent,> As nothing is coexistent with itself.> Yet if they are different,> How could they be coexistent? [VI.4] > If a single thing were coexistent,> This would occur in isolation as well.> If the different were coexistent,> This would occur in isolation as well. [VI.5] Now, are desire and the desirous one coexistent by virtue of being essentiallythe same or different? In the first case, these two cannot be coexistent,precisely because they would then be essentially the same. The entailment ofthis argument holds because coexistence implies that something is present alongwith something else, yet it is not feasible for something to be together withitself. It may be thought that simultaneity would be feasible in the case ofessential sameness and different conceptual distinctions. Yet this will not dobecause the difference between conceptual distinctions is a conceptualimputation that does not have any bearing on the object.How about the alternative? Well, if these two were indeed essentially different,how could they possibly be coexistent? The entailment of this argument can beunderstood from the following: Two things being different precludes theiroccurrence at the same place and time. No material or mental entity can occupythe same location, or the same continuum, as a second different entity, and timeis not something that can be observed apart from the given entities themselves.These two options can also be refuted by showing the absurd consequences of bothpositions. If it is held that simultaneity applies to what is essentially oneand the same, it would follow that when Devadatta is unaccompanied and allalone, he is nevertheless present together with himself. On the other hand, ifthe position is that coexistence applies to things that are essentiallydifferent, then two different things that have nothing to do with eachother—like a horse on a mountain in the east and a cow on a mountain in thewest—will still be present together, despite their respective isolation.The Coexistence of Different ThingsThe second section shows that (1) desire and the desirous one are notestablished as different and are, therefore, not coexistent; (2) that if theywere different, it would be meaningless to prove their natural existence byreferring to coexistence; and (3) if their difference depends on theircoexistence, difference and coexistence become mutually dependent.NondifferenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If they are different and coexistent,> How could desire and the desirous one> Be established as two different things> That would then be present together? [VI.6] It may be held that desire and the desirous one are essentially different, yetcoexistent, and that, in this way, they are established as different without anymutual dependence. Yet if these two are coexistent, how could desire and thedesirous one be established as different from one another in the absence ofmutual dependence? Indeed, they cannot. Therefore, they are not coexistent.The Reference to Coexistence Is MeaninglessOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If desire and the desirous one> Are established as different,> Then why would you think of them> As being coexistent? [VI.7] The opponent might take the position that there cannot be coexistence unlessthere is difference, and that, therefore, desire and the desirous one are indeedestablished as distinct without being mutually dependent. But if this were thecase, then their nature would be established as such. Why, then, would you thinkof them as being coexistent in an attempt to prove their natural existence?It was previously explained that because these two do not occur in sequence,they have no nature. You115 objected to that explanation, arguing that they dohave such natural existence because they are coexistent. You also asserted thatthese two must be established as independent and different and that they couldnot be coexistent if this were not the case. Now, given that they areestablished as distinct, it will also have been established that they exist bynature. Yet you also stated that because they are established as distinct, theyare coexistent, and because they are coexistent, they exist by nature. This partof your argument, in which you again refer to simultaneity, serves no purpose inproving their natural establishment.116Mutual Dependence of Difference and SimultaneityOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If they are asserted to be coexistent> Because their difference lacks establishment,> Would you also assert their difference> To prove their coexistence? [VI.8] > When things are not established as different,> Neither are they established as coexistent.> When there is a thing that is different,> It may be claimed that it is coexistent. [VI.9] A further reply might then be given: “It is not meaningless to speak ofcoexistence because without it their difference will not be established. Hence,we hold that the coexistence of desire and the desirous one is proof that theyare different.”Now, since it is explained that “identical things are not coexistent,” therecannot be any coexistence if things are not different. Would you then alsoassert that their difference proves their coexistence? You would have to, andthen the arguments for difference and coexistence would end up being circular.Therefore, when there is a thing that is different, it may be claimed that it iscoexistent, yet coexistence cannot be established by recourse to differencebecause the argument for difference, presupposes, as explained before, the verything that it is meant to prove, that is, coexistence. In this way, the formeris never established prior to the latter. Reference to the essential differenceof things can, therefore, not be used to prove that things are coexistent.Likewise, recourse to coexistence cannot prove difference either. To demonstratethis point, we may restructure the ninth stanza as follows:> When there is a thing that is coexistent,> It may be claimed that it is different.> When things are not established as coexistent,> Neither are they established as different. SUMMARY On the third issue,117 the treatise states:> Therefore, desire and the desirous one> Are not established as coexistent or otherwise. [VI.10a–b] As demonstrated above, desire and the desirous one can be shown to be neithercoexistent nor otherwise when subjected to examination. We can, therefore,conclude that they have no nature.EXTENDING THIS ANALYSIS TO OTHER TOPICS Concerning the second issue, the treatise extends this analysis to other topics:> As is the case with desire and the desirous one,> No phenomena are established as coexistent or otherwise. [VI.10c–d] Desire cannot coexist with its support, the desirous one. Nor can these two beseparate. The same holds for the affliction of anger, or any other phenomenonthat relates to something else. Anger, for instance, is not established ascoexistent with its support, the one who is angry, nor is it otherwise. Hence,all dependently originated phenomena are emptiness by nature, for we can arguethe same about all of them. This is demonstrated about anger in the followingline: “If, before the presence of anger, the angry exists without anger, …”This concludes the explanation of the sixth chapter, the analysis of desire andthe desirous one, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of theMiddle Way.114. Vasubandhu, Treasury of Abhidharma, II.50b.115. Even if the opponent is nobody in particular, one may, according to Tibetandebate rhetoric, still use the second person pronoun when addressing acounterposition. Here and elsewhere, we have let this convention be reflected inthe translation as well.116. That is, the opponent might as well just say, “Because they are distinct,they are established by nature.”117. Perhaps Mabja takes these verses as a summary (don bsdu ba) of the“Refutation of desire and the desirous one.” In that case, it would appear thata reference to this section is missing on p. 222, where the primary subsectionsof the “Refutation of desire and the desirous one” are enumerated.Alternatively, it could be that Mabja reads these lines as the concludingsummary of chapter 6 as a whole."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONDITIONEDTHE ANALYSIS of the characteristics of the conditioned will be covered in threesections, of which the first concerns the chapter’s context.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 7 The present chapter relates to the profound sūtras in that it uses reasoning toascertain the intent of statements such as the following passage from the Motherof the Victorious Ones:> When the conditioned and the unconditioned, and the qualities of good and> evil,> Have all been demolished through insight, so that not even a particle is> observed,> Within the worlds, they then come to belong to transcendent insight,> In the same way that space does not abide anywhere at all. And this excerpt from the Sūtra of the King of Meditative Absorptions:> Phenomena do not arise nor do they cease.> They do not abide, they are nonabiding, beyond all abiding.> By nature they are illusory, and always devoid of essence. As for its relationship to the other chapters in the text, this present chaptercan be seen as a response to the following objection: “The aggregates, elements,and sense sources—those phenomena that are of a conditioned nature—do indeedexist, for the Sūtra of the Great Cloud teaches:> Monks, these three are the characteristics of the conditioned. Conditioned> phenomena can be observed to arise, cease, and change from their present> state. These, then, are the characteristics whereby we may know a thing to beconditioned. Thus, arising, abiding, and cessation exist by nature.”The seventh chapter explains that the purport of such statements is notdefinitive. This is done by showing how arising, abiding, and cessation are notfeasible from the perspective of reasoning.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 7 The content of this chapter includes (1) a refutation of the reality of thecharacteristics of the conditioned, (2) an explanation of that which isestablished thereby, and (3) a rejection of the criticism that this refutationcontradicts scripture.THE REALITY OF THECHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONDITIONED The first of these includes two further topics: (1) a general refutation ofarising, abiding, and cessation and (2) an individual refutation of each.A General Refutation of Arising, Abiding, and CessationThe first refutation involves examining (1) whether or not these three areconditioned, (2) whether they are separate or united, and (3) whether or notthey themselves have other characteristics.Are Arising, Abiding, and Cessation Conditioned?On the first issue, the treatise states:> If arising were conditioned,> It would possess these three characteristics.> If arising were unconditioned,> How could it be a characteristic of the conditioned? [VII.1] Among the listeners, the Proponents of Differences teach that arising, abiding,and cessation are what characterize a given thing as conditioned and that thesecharacteristics exist separately from that which they characterize. When it isheld that the characteristic of arising is essentially different from the thingthat bears it and that this characteristic indicates that a thing isconditioned, we may ask whether that characteristic is itself conditioned orunconditioned. If it were conditioned, it would have to itself possess arisingand the other two characteristics, just as a vase does. The entailment ispresent because the opposition itself claims that no conditioned phenomenonfails to arise, abide, and cease. Yet it cannot be accepted that arising itselfhas these three characteristics because arising would then be a bearer of thecharacteristics of the conditioned, just as a form is, and it could then nolonger be its characteristic. If, on the other hand, arising were unconditionedlike space, then how could it be a characteristic of that which is conditioned?The entailment holds here as well because something that remains animpossibility with respect to a given definiendum and a set of bearers cannotpossibly be the characteristic of that definiendum and those bearers.The refutation of the remaining two characteristics becomes explicit bysubstituting “abiding” and “cessation” for “arising,” respectively.Are the Three Characteristics Separate or United?On the second issue, the treatise states:> Arising and the other two are each> Incapable of characterizing the conditioned.> But how could they simultaneously> Come together anywhere? [VII.2] Are these the characteristics of the conditioned individually or as a group? Thefirst cannot be the case because none of these characteristics can characterizethe conditioned on its own. The presence of any one characteristic,unaccompanied by the other two qualities that characterize the conditioned,would make the thing that is characterized unconditioned, unarisen, not presentat its own particular time, permanent, and unfit to be an entity. Yet, in thecase of the alternative, how could all three be simultaneously present in thesame thing? Each functions in a way that is as incompatible with the others, asis the case with light and darkness.Do the Three Characteristics Themselves Have Characteristics?The third issue has two elements, the first of which involves two absurdconsequences. The treatise states:> If arising, abiding, and cessation themselves> Bear further characteristics of the conditioned,> There will be an infinite regress.> Yet if they do not, they are not conditioned. [VII.3] What if arising, abiding, and cessation are themselves characterized by arising,abiding and cessation? In that case, these additional characteristics must alsohave these three characteristics, and there is then an infinite regress. Sinceno end to the sequence can be established, none of the initial links areestablished either. However, if arising, abiding, and cessation do not each havetheir own arising, abiding, and cessation, then they are not conditioned. Notbeing conditioned, they cannot be the characteristics of the conditioned.The First CounterargumentThe following verses address two different replies to these consequences. Thetreatise presents the first reply as follows:> Due to the arising of arising,> There arises only fundamental arising,> Yet fundamental arising is responsible> For the arising of arising as well. [VII.4] Faced with the first consequence, some Sammitīyas respond with the followingobjection: “The characteristics of arising, abiding, and cessation do have theirown characteristic arising, abiding, and cessation. Therefore, the second flawdoes not apply. There is no infinite regress either because the characteristicsand their subsidiary characteristics characterize and establish each other.Seven phenomena are involved here, namely the bearer of characteristics, thethree characteristics, and the three subsidiary characteristics. The arising ofarising produces only the fundamental arising. Yet the fundamental arisingproduces the arising of arising and all the other phenomena except itself. Thus,the arising of arising performs the function of producing arising itself,whereas the fundamental arising is responsible for the production of all theinvolved phenomena with the exception of arising. Similarly, the abiding ofabiding makes the fundamental abiding abide, while the latter provides for theabiding of the other six phenomena. Finally, the cessation of cessation makesfundamental cessation cease, while the latter causes the other six phenomena tocease. Thus, all seven phenomena—the three characteristics, the three subsidiarycharacteristics, and the bearer of these characteristics—first arise, thenabide, and finally cease. This shows that they are conditioned.”In this way, it is held that characteristics and their bearers are differentsubstances that perform independently.In the Abhidharma, we find the following explanation:> It is discerned that by including aging there are four character istics. As> these are accompanied by the arising of arising, and so forth, eight phenomena> in all apply to one.118 Nevertheless, here aging refers to the degeneration of abiding. It is,therefore, included in the latter. The Commentary119 enumerates fifteenphenomena by specifying seven characteristics, seven subsidiary characteristics,plus their bearer, thereby explaining that fourteen phenomena are held to applyto one. This is not explicit in the root text.Response to the First CounterargumentNext, the objection raised above will be dispensed with by showing that it is acircular argument. This involves (1) explaining how the arising of arisingcannot reasonably produce fundamental arising, (2) explaining why fundamentalarising cannot reasonably produce the arising of arising, and (3) refuting afurther reply to the first two explanations.The Arising of Arising Cannot Reasonably Produce Fundamental ArisingOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If your “arising of arising”> Produces fundamental arising,> How could it do so when not produced> By this “fundamental arising?” [VII.5] According to your account, the arising of arising produces fundamental arising.Yet how could the subject, your “arising of arising,” produce fundamentalarising, as it is not present before the latter? The implicit argument is thatsince the arising of arising depends on fundamental arising, the former cannotbe produced prior to the latter.Fundamental Arising Cannot Reasonably Produce the Arising of ArisingOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If the product of this “fundamental arising”> Itself produces fundamental arising,> Then how could fundamental arising produce it,> When it has not been produced by that? [VII.6] It may be argued: “The flaw presented above is irrelevant because the arising ofarising that is produced by fundamental arising in turn produces fundamentalarising.”However, how could the subject, your “fundamental arising,” produce the arisingof arising, given that it is not present before the latter? Fundamental arisingitself depends on the arising of arising. Therefore, fundamental arising cannotbe produced prior to the arising of arising.Refutation of a Further ReplyOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If that which has not yet arisen> Were capable of production,> Your assertion of production by the currently arising> Would have been acceptable. [VII.7] It may be replied: “We assert the substantial existence of the three times.Hence, while fundamental arising is not produced by the arising of arising priorto the arising of arising, the future holds a currently arising fundamentalarising, and that is what produces the arising of arising. This arising ofarising, in turn, makes the fundamental arising that is contained in the futurearise in the present.”As was explained above, “That which is currently arising is approaching arisingand is, hence, not existent.”120 Thus, that which is currently arising has notyet arisen and, therefore, does not exist. If, generally speaking, somethingthat has not itself arisen, and so does not yet exist, were capable of producingsomething else, then your “fundamental arising,” a not-yet existent thing of thefuture that nevertheless produces the arising of arising, would be acceptable.Yet just as a barren woman’s daughter cannot have any offspring, something thatitself has yet to arise and come into existence is incapable of producingsomething else. It is, therefore, untenable that a currently arising fundamentalarising produces the arising of arising.The same can be said with respect to an arising of arising that is currentlyarising and contained in the future, thereby giving rise to fundamental arising.The refutation of the remaining two factors is made explicit in the followingways:> If your “abiding of abiding”> Causes fundamental abiding to abide,> How could it do so when it has not> Been made to abide by this “fundamental abiding?” And:> If your “cessation of cessation”> Causes fundamental cessation to cease …121 The Second CounterargumentNext follows the treatment of a second objection to the consequences that werestated in the third stanza. First, the counterargument itself is presented:> Just as a light illumines> Both itself and other things,> Birth produces both itself> As well as other things. [VII.8] This objection goes as follows: “There are no further arising, abiding, andcessation apart from those that are the characteristics of the conditioned.Hence, there is no infinite regress. Moreover, the absurdity of thecharacteristics becoming unconditioned does not apply either. Consider how alight, being illuminating by nature, can illumine both itself and other things.Performing the act of arising is, similarly, the nature of arising, and so itgives rise to both itself and other conditioned things. The same is the casewith abiding, which makes both itself and other things abide, and cessation,which is responsible for the cessation of both itself and other entities.”Response to the Second ObjectionRefuting the second objection involves showing that (1) the example is notestablished and (2) its meaning is unreasonable. The first of these includesrefutations by presenting (1) evidence that the entailed is unobservable and (2)an absurd consequence of this position.Lack of Observation of the EntailedOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Light itself and the place where it is—> Neither of these have any darkness.> What does light illuminate?> Illumination occurs by dispelling darkness. [VII.9] > When light that is currently arising> Does not encounter darkness,> How could the currently arising light> Illuminate the darkness? [VII.10] > If light were to dispel darkness,> Even without encountering it,> Then the one right here would dispel> All the darkness in the world. [VII.11] Upon investigation, we find that the example, the light that illumines bothitself and other things, is not established. How could the subject, theaforementioned light, illumine both itself and other things since it does notdispel darkness in either itself or something else? This evidence, furthermore,is not established because it is impossible to bring light and darkness togetherin the same place. Therefore, whether we think of the light itself or the placearound it, neither of them contains darkness that can be dispelled. It may thenbe asked why this lack of darkness being dispelled should rule out that thelight illuminates. The reason is that the world holds that illumination occursby the dispelling of darkness.It may be thought that a light that has already arisen does not dispel darkness,but a light that is currently arising does. Yet this will not do. As was alreadymentioned, light and darkness cannot be present at the same location and time.The currently arising light, therefore, never encounters the dark. How, then,could it illuminate darkness? Just as light does not dispel darkness in placesthat are entirely unrelated to it, light does not dispel darkness anywhere.Someone might then think: “Even if light and darkness do not encounter oneanother, why would it not still follow that light dispels darkness?”If this were the case, the subject, the light right here, must then also be ableto dispel, for example, the darkness between the continents. In fact, it shouldbe able to dispel all the darkness in the entire world! Just as the light heredoes not encounter darkness where we are now, it does not encounter darkness inthe rest of the world either.It might then be argued: “How so? Although there is no difference insofar as noencounter takes place, light only dispels darkness in places where thecircumstances are right for that to happen. It they are not, darkness will notbe dispelled. Hence, there is no problem. The same principle is at work invisual perception. In a suitable location, seeing will occur without the eyefaculty actually touching the object that is seen, yet in an unsuitablelocation, perception will not take place.”Here, neither the example nor the intended meaning is appropriate. Given that noencounter ever takes place, it does not makes sense for there to be differencesin terms of certain places being fit for perception and certain instances ofdarkness being able to be dispelled. When an encounter does not take place dueto distance or material obstruction, no perception or illumination can takeplace. The reason is that the distance or obstruction will have rendered anencounter impossible. If, then, no encounter ever were to take place, therecould not be any perception or illumination, even if the place is close by andobstructions are absent.We have already discussed why objections that appeal to the way things appearwill not be sufficient here.An Absurd ConsequenceSecond, pointing out the absurd consequence of this position, the treatisestates:> If light could illumine> Both itself and other things,> Darkness would undoubtedly conceal> Both itself and other things as well. [VII.12] If it were the case that, since light illuminates, it could illumine both itselfand other things, then darkness, since it conceals, would undoubtedly concealboth itself and other things as well. This position would then imply thatdarkness would conceal itself and that it would, therefore, be invisible.However, mundane direct perception does see most subtle particles of darkness.It is, therefore, not self-obscuring. Similarly, light does not illuminate bothitself and other things. As the Noble Jewel Mound teaches:> If some people light a lamp> In a house after a very long time,> The darkness there will not be thinking:> “I have been here so long, so I won’t go away!”> Once the lamp is lit, even the darkest darkness> Cannot but disappear.> Due to the lamp, the dark disappears.> Both are empty; there is no conceit at all. The Meaning of the Second Reply Is UnreasonableSecond, it will be shown that the meaning of the example is also untenable. Thisincludes (1) refuting that arising produces itself and (2) refuting that itproduces something else.Arising Does Not Produce ItselfConcerning the first issue, the treatise states:> When it has not arisen itself,> How could arising produce its own nature?> If it does so having already arisen,> Having arisen, what is it that is produced? [VII.13] If arising gives rise to itself, does it do so before or after it has arisen? Ifthe first, we may ask how the subject, arising, could give rise to its ownnature, given that it has not yet arisen. That which has not arisen is just asdevoid of essence as the sky flower. Therefore, it lacks any power to produceitself. Alternatively, if arising produces itself after it has already arisen,then what is it that the subject, arising, produces if it itself has alreadyarisen? That which already exists does not need to be established.Arising Does Not Produce Anything ElseThe second issue refutes this notion by (1) examining the object of arising interms of the three times and (2) examining whether arising itself has a furtherarising. The first examination involves (1) a general refutation of arising withrespect to the objects of the three times, (2) a specific refutation of arisingin the present, and (3) dispensing with the criticism that this isirreconcilable with dependent origination.General Refutation of Arising in the Three TimesWhen the act of arising, as a distinct entity, produces a vase or anotherconditioned phenomenon, does it produce something that has already arisen,something that has yet to arise, or something that is currently arising? Inresponse, the treatise states:> The arisen, unarisen, and arising> Is not produced in any way.> This was explained before> By what was, will be, and is being traversed. [VII.14] As was the case with the earlier refutation of the object that going relates towith reference to the three times, here we may follow the same steps withrespect to arising. In the first case, the act of arising is already over, andin the second, it has not yet begun. Similarly, no current arising can beobserved to be taking place in the present apart from these two. Thus, all threereplies are untenable.Particular Refutation of Current ArisingThe second issue involves (1) showing the nonexistence of current arising bypointing out the lack of a support for the act of arising and (2) refuting anobjection to this refutation.On the first issue, the treatise states:> When there is arising,> Current arising occurs,> Yet, when there is none, how can you claim> That this current arising is based on arising? [VII.15] It may be argued: “What arises is not that which has already arisen or what hasyet to arise. The current arising arises. It is not that there is no such thingas that which currently arises apart from the former two. The vase is explainedto be the object to which the activity of arising relates. Thus, the objectpossesses the activity of arising and is, thereby, produced by an arising thatis an entity other than itself.”If the act of arising existed, it would, as here suggested, make sense to speakof a “currently arising vase,” when a vase would possess that act of arising.However, as it is taught, “When there is nothing that arises, arising does notmake sense.”122 In other words, when the vase is currently arising, the vasethat should be the support of that activity has not yet arisen. It is, thus,nonexistent. Without any support, there cannot be any supported activity, thatis, the arising of a vase. As this is the case, how can a so-called currentlyarising vase be based on the presence of the act of arising? As the currentlyarising vase is itself not established, it does not make sense to say that it isproduced by an arising that is a different entity.Refutation of the ObjectionOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If an unarisen entity were to exist somewhere,> Then that could arise.> But, when it does not exist,> What sort of thing could then arise? [VII.17] Some may think: “The three times exist substantially. Hence, the arising vaseexists as a future entity. As such, it supports the activity of arising, andthus comes to arise as a present entity.”A reply to this notion is provided one stanza later: If an entity, such as avase, could somehow exist as a future entity without having arisen, then itcould serve as the support for the act of arising, and so that thing could cometo arise. Yet, since future entities are just as unborn and devoid of identityas the sky flower, what sort of thing could then arise? Indeed, since there isno support for it, the activity of arising cannot apply to anything.One may then object: “When a vase is currently arising, no vase exists yet.Nevertheless, there is something else that the act of the vase’s arising appliesto, and on that basis the vase then comes into being.”Yet this is not the case. If the activity of arising is supported by somethingother than the vase, that which arises could not be the vase.This Does Not Exclude Dependent OriginationOn the third issue, the treatise states:> That which originates dependently> Is peace by its very essence.> Arising and the currently arising as well> Are, therefore, peace itself. [VII.16] Members of our own tradition may argue: “The Transcendent Conqueror taught:> Here, there is no self or sentient being;> These are phenomena that have causes. Thus, he has taught that reality consists of mere phenomena; phenomena that areempty of any permanent, singular, and independent self, as otherwise imputed bythe extremists; phenomena that originate dependently and are of an impermanentnature. Now, with the pretence of teaching the sublime words of the Buddha, yousay things like, ‘The arisen, unarisen, and arising do not produce in any way.’Denying dependent origination, the great Mother from whom all the Thus-Gone Onesare born, your teaching is utterly nihilistic.”The reply is as follows: We do indeed refute dependent origination as you thinkof it, namely, as established by nature. In refuting the natural establishmentof dependent origination, we show it to be compelling only so long as one doesnot examine it. Thus, our explanation clarifies the intent of the sūtras. Bymaking certain statements, such as “Nature cannot reasonably occur due to causesand conditions,”123 we show that fabrication through causes and conditions ispossible where nothing exists by nature, whereas if things existed by naturethat would be impossible. Therefore, that which originates dependently is thevery essence of peace; it is emptiness. A sūtra teaches:> What arises due to conditions does not arise;> It lacks the nature of arising.> What depends on conditions is taught to be empty.124 Likewise:> Mahāmati, it is with their natural nonarising in mind that I explain all> phenomena to be empty.125 Therefore, both the product, that which arises in the present, and the producer,arising, are by nature peace itself.Does Arising Itself Arise?Second follows a refutation by means of examining whether arising itself has afurther arising. The treatise states:> If arising gives rise> To the currently arising,> Then what, in turn,> Gives rise to arising? [VII.18] > If arising is due to a separate arising> There will be an infinite regress.> If it arises without arising,> Then so does everything else. [VII. 19] According to the objector’s position, the currently arising vase is produced bya separate entity, the activity of arising. If this is the case, does thisseparate entity of arising arise by itself or is it produced by something else?If it is held that arising is produced by another arising, then that arising aswell will require its own separate arising. Hence, there will be an infiniteregress. If, alternatively, arising arises without any separate arisinginvolved, then the case will be the same with all those things that arereportedly produced by arising. They will also arise without there being anyseparate entity of arising involved because they too are entities, as isarising.This refutation of arising by examining whether it is produced by itself orsomething else can, by replacing terms in the way that was shown earlier, beturned into a refutation of abiding and cessation, in which case one examineswhether they abide and cease by themselves or due to the agency of somethingother than themselves.Individual Refutations of Arising, Abiding, and CessationHaving offered a general refutation of the three characteristics of theconditioned, we shall now refute each individually.Refutation of ArisingFirst is the refutation of arising, which involves (1) recalling what waspreviously explained and (2) a reasoning that has not been explained before.On the first issue, the treatise states:> The existent and nonexistent cannot reasonably arise.> Something that is both> Cannot do so either.> Indeed, this has already been explained. [VII.20] Here, the message of the sixth and seventh stanzas in the analysis of conditionsis to be recalled.On the second issue, the treatise states:> A thing that is currently ceasing> Cannot reasonably arise.> A thing that is not currently ceasing> Cannot reasonably be a thing. [VII.21] Is that which arises something that is ceasing from one moment to the next? Toanswer yes would not make sense because a thing that is currently ceasing cannotalso be arising, for these two are incompatible with one another. In addition,something that is currently ceasing is still present and has not yet ceased.The alternative is not acceptable either. As has been taught:> That which by nature does not cease> Is referred to by the wise as “permanent.”126 Thus, something that is not in the process of ceasing, and therefore remains fora second moment, would be permanent and unconditioned. Hence, it could not be a[conditioned] thing.It might be objected: “That does not follow because the thing is not in theprocess of ceasing from the very beginning. Rather, its cessation only occursonce its continuum comes to an end.”That, however, cannot be maintained. On this point, it is taught:> Abiding is impossible and what does not change> To begin with does not cease in the end.127 Thus, if the thing would not be gone in the next moment, its remaining at asecond point in time would make its presence endless. This could not bereconciled with a cessation at the end of a continuum.Refutation of AbidingThe second issue, the refutation of abiding, covers four points. The first is arefutation of abiding with reference to the refutation of arising.Given the Absence of Arising, There Is No AbidingConcerning this first issue, the treatise states:> What thing abides that does not arise? [VII.22d] Since the arising of conditioned phenomena has already been refuted, below it isasked what could possibly abide. Nothing at all abides, just as in the case ofthe sky flower.Refutation of Abiding with Reference to the Three TimesThe second refutation examines abiding in terms of the three times. The treatisestates:> A thing that has abided does not abide,> A thing that has yet to abide does not abide,> And no currently abiding thing abides either. [VII.22a–c] Let us assume that the activity of abiding is responsible, as a distinct entity,for the abiding of a given conditioned thing. Is that which it makes abide thensomething that has already abided, something that has yet to abide, or somethingthat is currently abiding? Abiding does not make something that has alreadyabided abide because in such a thing the activity of abiding has ceased. Neitherdoes it relate to something that does not yet abide because in such a thingabiding has not yet arisen. Finally, it does not make something that iscurrently abiding abide either because there are no things that currently abideapart from the two that were just mentioned. Moreover, if the latter were thecase, it would also follow that there would be two activities of abiding.Is What Abides Currently Ceasing?The third section offers a refutation by examining whether what abides iscurrently ceasing or not. The treatise states:> A thing that is currently ceasing> Cannot reasonably abide.> A thing that is not currently ceasing> Cannot reasonably be a thing. [VII.23] > All things, at all times,> Are subject to aging and death.> What thing then remains> Free from aging and death? [VII.24] Is that which abides something that is currently ceasing or something else? Itdoes not make sense for something that is currently ceasing to abide becauseabiding and ceasing are mutually incompatible. On the other hand, were thatwhich abides not currently ceasing but remaining for a second instant, it would,as explained before, never cease. Therefore, it could not be a functional thing.Thus, the twenty-fourth stanza implies the absolute impossibility of something’sremaining for a second instant upon its arising.One may then object that although substantial things are momentary and,therefore, do not abide, abiding is found in their continua. This, however, isnot tenable either. It is not possible to observe any continuum that isessentially different from a momentary substance. And if the two are essentiallyinseparable, the continuum would be incompatible with abiding, just as thesubstance is.Does Abiding Itself Have a Further Abiding?The fourth refutation examines whether abiding itself has a further abiding. Thetreatise states:> Abiding cannot reasonably abide> Due to itself, nor due to another.> The case was the same with arising,> Which arises neither by itself nor through another. [VII.25] If conditioned things are made to abide by a separate entity of abiding, doesthat abiding then make itself abide, or is there yet another abiding that isresponsible? Neither alternative makes sense. In the second case, there would bean infinite regress. Given the first option, it is impossible for something toact on itself. Here the case is the same as that of arising, which, as we haveseen, neither arises by itself, nor due to anything else. The first two lines ofthe nineteenth stanza, the first two lines of the thirteenth stanza, and thelast two lines of the nineteenth stanza can, thus, easily be turned intorefutations of abiding by saying, “If abiding is due to a separate abiding,there will be an infinite regress,” and so on. For these reasons, the King ofMeditative Absorptions teaches:> These phenomena do not abide;> They have no abiding.> That which does not abide may be spoken of as if it did,> Yet it has no essence. Refutation of CessationThird is the refutation of impermanence. This has six subsections, the first ofwhich is a refutation with reference to causal arising, which has already beenrefuted.Given the Absence of Arising, There Is No AbidingThe treatise states:> What thing ceases that did not arise? [VII.26d] Below, it is asked what sort of thing could be ceasing, when no thing hasarisen. The notion that things arise has already been refuted.The Refutation of Cessation with Reference to the Three TimesNext is a refutation by examining cessation in terms of the three times. Thetreatise states:> A thing that has ceased does not cease,> A thing that has yet to cease does not cease,> And no currently ceasing thing ceases either. [VII.26a–c] A thing that has ceased does not cease, for its act of ceasing is over and,hence, absent. Something that has yet to cease does not cease either. In such athing, the act of cessation has not yet begun, and a cessation of it would be inconflict with its having yet to cease. Finally, that which is currently ceasingdoes not cease any more than the previous two, for apart from what has alreadyceased and what has yet to do so, there cannot possibly be anything thatcurrently ceases. The existence of such a thing would, moreover, also result inthere being two activities of cessation.Is What Ceases Currently Abiding?The third section presents a refutation by examining whether or not what ceasesis currently abiding. The treatise states:> A thing that abides> Cannot reasonably cease,> Yet a thing that does not abide> Cannot reasonably cease either. [VII.27] It does not make sense for a thing that currently abides to cease, for itsabiding is incompatible with ceasing. However, a thing that does not currentlyabide, a thing without any abiding, cannot cease either because such a thingwould be unconditioned. Moreover, a phenomenon that does not abide at its ownspecific time is impossible.Is Cessation Due to the Initial State Itself or to Another State?The fourth subsection is a refutation that considers whether cessation isbrought about by the initial state itself or by some other state. The treatiseexplains:> The same state does not> Bring an end to itself,> Nor is it that a different state> Makes the initial one cease. [VII.28] > When no phenomenon’s arising> Makes any sense,> No phenomenon’s cessation,> Makes any sense either. [VII.29] If it is held that an effect follows the cessation of its cause, is thecessation of the causal state then due to that state itself, or is it insteadbrought about by a different resultant state? The first could not be the case.The causal states of, say, milk or being young, do not bring an end tothemselves because nothing can act upon itself. Yet the alternative is notfeasible either. It is not the case that a different resultant state, such ascurd or being old, brings an end to the causal state of milk and being young.There is no contact between these different states, just as there is no contactbetween the heat of a kitchen stove and the cold of a snow ball.It may be argued: “Nevertheless, the causal milk and youth do indeed ceasebecause we observe the arising of the curd and aging that result.”Yet we have already shown how the arising of curd, or any other resultantphenomenon, makes no sense. Thereby, we have also made it clear that milk, orany other causal phenomenon, cannot reasonably cease.Is That Which Ceases a Thing?The fifth refutation examines whether or not that which ceases is a thing. Thetreatise states:> A thing that exists> Cannot have a cessation,> Because the same thing cannot> Be both thing and no thing. [VII.30] > A thing that does not exist> Cannot have a cessation,> Just as it is impossible> To cut offa second head. [VII.31] Is that which ceases a thing? This would not make sense. If the support, theexistent thing, is essentially the same as its cessation, which is itself theabsence of a thing, the former could not exist as a thing. Likewise, if theproperty, the nonentity of cessation, is essentially the same as the existentthing that supports it, the former could not be the absence of that thing. Anyidea of these two being the same will always be contradictory. Just as somethingcannot be both light and darkness, it does not make sense for something to beboth a thing and no thing.There cannot be any cessation where no thing exists either. In the absence of asupport for it, the cessation would be similar to a painting on space. It wouldbe just as impossible as it is to cut offthe second head of a living being thatonly has one.Does Cessation Itself Have a Further Cessation?The sixth refutation examines whether or not cessation itself has a furthercessation:> Cessation is neither brought about> By itself nor by anything else,> Just as arising is not produced> By itself or something else. [VII.32] Let us assume that for each conditioned phenomenon there is a separate entity ofcessation that makes the phenomenon cease. Would that cessation then cease byits own nature, or because of some other cessation? Cessation is brought aboutneither by itself nor by anything else because nothing can act on itself, and ifsomething else were to be involved, there would be an infinite regress. It wasexplained earlier how arising cannot arise by itself or because of somethingelse. We can, therefore, simply substitute cessation for arising and draw asimilar conclusion.At this point, the Commentary explains why the above criticism does not applyequally to cessation as we teach it in terms of the relative. It also presents arefutation of the view that cessation is uncaused and explains why the positionthat cessation involves a cause is flawless. These explanations are presentedlucidly in the Commentary itself.THE ESTABLISHED MEANING Having refuted the notion that the characteristics of the conditioned are real,the second issue involves presenting the meaning that is established thereby.The treatise states:> As arising, abiding, and cessation are not established,> There is nothing that is conditioned.> Since the conditioned lacks any establishment,> How could the unconditioned be established? [VII.33] It may be thought: “The three characteristics of the conditioned have indeedbeen negated, but their bearers, such as forms, sensations, and all other outerand inner entities, do exist.”Yet this is not the case. It was shown earlier how the characteristics in termsof arising, abiding, and ceasing are not established by nature. This also provesthat the bearers of these characteristics of the conditioned, such as the thingsthat belong to the aggregate of form, have no nature.It might then be thought that the unconditioned must exist since it has not beenrefuted. However, once we examine things in the way described above, we findnothing conditioned. How, then, could the negation of that, the unconditioned,be established? Without anything to be negated, there cannot be any negation.The King of Meditative Absorptions explains:> As neither the conditioned nor the unconditioned have any bearing,> The sage does not conceive of either of these.> Since in every realm the unconditioned is achieved> He is always entirely beyond views> Of the wanderers who [strive to] achieve the unconditioned. HOW THE ABOVE REFUTATION DOES NOT CONTRADICT SCRIPTURE Third, explaining how these negations do not conflict with scripture, thetreatise states:> Like a dream, like an illusion,> Like a city of scent-eaters—> This is how arising, abiding,> And cessation are taught to be. [VI.34] It may be argued: “If, in this way, there were no nature of arising, abiding,and cessation, it would conflict with the following teaching from the Sūtra ofthe Great Cloud in Twelve Thousand Stanzas:> Monks, the conditioned obviously arises. It likewise obviously ceases, and> changes from the way it is into something else.” This is indeed taught, but it is not an explanation of the ultimate, definitivemeaning. In dreams, things do not arise although they appear to; in an illusion,there is nothing that abides, although there seems to be; and a city ofscent-eaters contains no things that cease, despite giving that appearance. Thearising, abiding, and cessation of conditioned things is taught to be similar tothese. There is, therefore, no contradiction.Alternatively, each of these three examples is equally applicable to arising,abiding, and cessation: A dream, an illusion, or a city of scent-eaters does notcontain any actual arising, abiding, and cessation, and yet it still appears to.In the very same way, conditioned things do not have any objective arising,abiding, or cessation, yet they seem to from the perspective of a mind indelusion.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE The present chapter has explicitly refuted the ultimate [reality of ] both theconditioned and the unconditioned and has shown that with respect to therelative, such things are like dreams and illusions. Since there cannot possiblybe any phenomenon that is not included in either the conditioned or theunconditioned, this chapter has thus affirmed that, in reality, all phenomenaare of the nature of emptiness, while in terms of the relative, their appearanceis illusion-like. This is also taught in the King of Meditative Absorptions:> No phenomenon arises or disintegrates;> There is no death, no transference, and no aging.> This is what the Lion of Men has taught,> And in this he has established hundreds of beings. Likewise:> The Protector of the World has not taught> That anything abides or arises.> Aware of this Protector of the World,> Recognize the meditative absorption. This concludes the explanation of the seventh chapter, the analysis of theconditioned, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the MiddleWay.118.

As for its relationship to the other chapters of the text, the present analysisis a response to the following notion, “Consciousness, and all other conditionedphenomena that comprise the aggregates, elements, and sense sources, do indeedexist. A sūtra teaches:> A person who is subject to ignorance creates meritorious, nonmeritorious, and> undisturbed formations.128 Thus, this statement affirms the existence of actions that function as causes,as well as the agents of such actions. Now, the nonexistent could not be theobject of any action or agent, just as a garment made of turtle hair cannotinvolve an action or agent.”This chapter shows that, when subjected to examination, action and agent will beseen to be devoid of establishment.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 8 Explaining the content of this chapter involves (1) refuting the naturalestablishment of action and agent, (2) explaining their merely conventional,mutually dependent establishment, and (3) extending this analysis to othertopics.REFUTING THE NATURAL ESTABLISHMENT OF ACTION AND AGENT As for the first issue, an agent is something that performs an action. In thisregard, only three alternatives are possible: something may be involved in theperformance of an action, not involved in it, or both involved and not involved.In the first case, we have an agent, in the second we do not, and in the thirdcase, the thing in question both is and is not an agent.Similarly, an action is something that is performed; it is what an agent carriesout. Here, there are also only three alternatives: Something may be performed byan agent, not performed, or both performed and not performed. In the first case,we have an action, in the second we do not, and in the third case, what we areconcerned with both is and is not an action.The refutation of action and agent will be carried out within the framework ofthese six alternatives. Thus, we will refute (1) actions and agents that are ofthe same ontological status and (2) actions and agents that are of a differentontological status.Refuting Agent and Action with the Same Ontological StatusThe first includes refutations of (1) the notion that an agent performs anaction, (2) the notion that what is not an agent performs what is not an action,and (3) the notion that something that both is and is not an agent performs whatboth is and is not an action.An Agent Does Not Perform an ActionOn the first issue, the treatise states:> That which is an agent does not> Perform something that is an action. [VIII.1a–b] Here a genuine thesis is presented as follows: Something that is an agent byvirtue of being involved in a given activity does not perform something thatqualifies as an action. Presenting the rationale for this statement, thetreatise explains:> That which is an agent would have no activity.> There would also be action without an agent.> That which is an action is not performed,> So the agent would be lacking its action. [VIII.2] If one that is already an agent were to perform an action, as explained earlier,that would require that there are two performances. There will have to be oneperformance that justifies the agent being referred to as such and, once it isqualified as an agent, there must then be another performance that the agentsubsequently carries out. Hence, we may argue: The subject, that which is anactual agent, does not have any activity because there is no performance otherthan the one that justifies the agent being referred to as such. Thus, since asingle agent does not perform two activities, the action ends up having noagent. In other words, the act would be independent of, and not performed by,any agent. Such an act is as impossible as a vase made by the son of a barrenwoman.Likewise, if an agent performs something that is already an action, there willhave to be two performances, as explained earlier. First, one performance mustjustify the action’s being referred to as such and then, once it has become anaction in this way, there must be a second performance that the agentsubsequently effectuates. Thus, we may argue: The subject, an action, is notperformed by any agent because there is no performance other than the one thatjustifies its classification as an action. Hence, as there are not twoperformances, something that is already an action is not performed. This meansthat the performing agent would end up lacking an action, and an agent that doesnot depend on or perform an action is impossible, just as it is impossible tohave an agent of a deed with immediate consequences if no such deed has beencommitted.A Nonagent Does Not Perform a NonactionThe second issue likewise includes both (1) the thesis and (2) its rationale.The ThesisOn the first issue, the treatise states:> A nonagent does not> Perform a nonaction. [VIII.1c–d] A nonagent, that is someone not engaged in any activity, does not perform anyaction that, in not being performed, is not an action.The RationaleThe justification of the thesis will be addressed by (1) stating the absurdconsequence that action and agent would have no causes and (2) pointing out whythis cannot be accepted.The Absurd ConsequenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If a nonagent were to perform> That which is not an action,> The action would have no cause> And the agent would have no cause either. [VIII.3] If something that is not yet involved in performing an action, and thus is notyet an agent, were to engage in an activity, there would be no cause forclassifying it as an agent. Likewise, if something that is not yet performed byan agent, and therefore is not yet an action, were to be performed, we wouldhave no cause for classifying it as an action. This absence of cause forspeaking of both agent and action is entailed because it is the presence ofactivity that justifies agent and action being classified as such.Why This Consequence Is UnacceptablePointing out the unacceptability of this consequence has two parts.129 First itwill be shown how this consequence entails the nonexistence of cause and effect.The treatise states:> If there is no cause,> Cause and effect become untenable.> Without these, action, agent, and activity> Will all be nonsensical as well. [VIII.4] > If action and so forth are unreasonable,> There can be no Dharma and non-Dharma,> And without Dharma and non-Dharma,> Their effects do not exist either. [VIII.5] > Without such effects, paths to liberation> And to the higher realms do not make sense. [VIII.6a–b] If one were to accept that conventions have no causes, it would, by the samerationale, become generally unreasonable to think in terms of effects that areproduced by causes and causes that generate effects. Accepting that suchthinking is unreasonable would entail a universal disappearance of all theconventions associated with action and agent. Without effects and the causesthat bring them about, there could not reasonably be any action in the form ofthe arising of an effect; there could not be an agent that is in control of suchan action; and there could not be any object that such an agent relates to, soas to give rise to the manifestation of a result.To accept that would lead to the collapse of all the conventions that arediscussed in the treatises. If action, agent, object, and activity have allbecome untenable, there could be no Dharma associated with the truly elevatedand the definitive good because there would not be any engagement in the tenvirtues or any meditation on the absence of self.Non-Dharma, which is the opposite of these activities, could not exist either.Without Dharma and non-Dharma, it also follows that the effects of these twowould be nonexistent. Hence, neither the happiness of the higher realms andliberation, nor the suffering of cyclic existence and the lower realms couldexist.If we were to accept that, it would be meaningless to train on either thetranscendent path to liberation or the mundane path to the higher realms, forthe effects of Dharma training would be nonexistent. Any such training would,therefore, make no sense.Second, the treatise points out that this would also entail the disappearance ofall worldly conventions:> All activities would indeed> End up entirely meaningless. [VIII.6c–d] If there were no such things as cause and effect, farming and other mundaneactivities, which are undertaken with the expectation of a certain result, wouldbe entirely meaningless. Such activities are, however, not entirely futile.Thus, causality is not completely nonexistent.One That Both Is and Is Not an Agent Does Not Perform Something That Both Is andIs Not an ActionThe third issue includes (1) the thesis and (2) its rationale. The treatisestates:> That which both is and is not an agent> Does not perform something that both is and is not.> Since being and not being are incompatible in one thing,> How could this ever be the case? [VIII.7] Something that both is and is not an agent and that, hence, both does and doesnot perform a given activity does not perform something that both is and is notan action. The reason, here, is that being and not being are mutuallyincompatible. How, then, could a single thing both be and not be an agent oraction? How could the same thing both perform and not perform, or be performedand also not performed?Refutation of Agent and Action Where the Ontological Status DiffersHaving thus refuted agents and actions in pairs with the same ontologicalstatus, we will next refute them in pairs where that status differs. Doing soincludes (1) pairing a single agent with a single action of different status and(2) treating the agent in relation to two actions that are of a differentstatus.Single Agent versus Single ActionOn the first, the treatise states:> One that is an agent does not perform> Something that is not an action,> Nor does one that is not perform something that is> Because the same flaws would ensue. [VIII.8] Something that is an agent does not perform a nonaction. Likewise, a nonagentdoes not perform an action either. Were either of these options to be asserted,the same flaws as we saw above would ensue. If a real agent is asserted, we havethe problem shown in the first two verses of the second stanza:> That which is an agent would have no activity.> There would also be action without an agent. The notion of a nonaction is addressed in the third stanza, where it isexplained that such an action has no cause. In the case of a nonagent, the samestanza pointed out that such an agent would be causeless. Finally, it does notmake sense for there to be an action that is performed because, as stated in thelast line of the second stanza, the agent would be lacking its action.Single Agent versus Two ActionsThe second section is divided into three parts. First, an agent that performs anonaction, or something that both is and is not an actual action, is refuted.The treatise states:> The agent involved does not> Perform any nonaction,> Or something that both is and is not an action.> The arguments have already been given. [VIII.9] An agent does not perform any nonaction, or something that both is and is not anaction. The arguments that explain this have already been given. The notion ofan agent was refuted in the first two lines of the second stanza; theperformance of a nonaction was disproved in the third stanza; and something’sboth being and not being an action was refuted in the last two lines of theseventh stanza by pointing out that it is contradictory to claim that one singlething can be both.Second, the notion of a nonagent performing an action, or something that both isand is not an action, is refuted. The treatise states:> That which is not an agent> Does not perform any action,> Or something that both is and is not an action.> The arguments have already been given. [VIII.10] A nonagent does not perform an action or something that both is and is not anaction. The reasons for this have already been stated. The third stanzaexplained that a nonagent will be lacking its cause; the last two verses of thesecond stanza have made it clear that the performance of an action would resultin the agent’s lacking its action; and the last two verses of the seventh stanzahave called attention to the incompatible natures of being and not being.Finally, the following stanza negates the notion that something that both is andis not an agent performs an action or a nonaction:> One that both is and is not an agent> Does not perform an action or a nonaction.> Here as well it should be understood> That the arguments have already been given. [VIII.11] One that both is and is not an agent is not involved in the performance of anyaction or nonaction. Here as well the reasons that explain this have alreadybeen given. The last two verses of the seventh stanza have shown theimpossibility of any such agent; the last two verses of the second stanza havestated that the performance of an action would render the agent actionless; andthe third stanza has shown that a nonaction has no cause.With the refutation of these eleven alternatives that relate to action andagent, it should be understood that neither action nor agent is established inthe sense of particular characteristics.AS MERE CONVENTIONS, ACTION AND AGENT ARE ESTABLISHED IN MUTUAL DEPENDENCE On the second issue, the treatise states:> Agent comes about in dependence on action,> And action, in turn, in dependence on agent.> Apart from that we do not see> Any cause of their establishment. [VIII.12] It may be objected: “The Able One taught:> The [consequences of ] an individual’s actions> Will each be experienced by that same individual. Now, your arguments go against all such teachings. You have, therefore, fallenprey to a distorted view, a type of nihilism that holds things such as actionsand their consequences to be nonexistent.”This, however, is not the case. Let us recall the following statement:> When no thing can be observed,> How could there be a nonthing?130 In other words, in reality we do not find any established existence of anythingthat could be negated, such as actions and their effects. For that reason, wewould not even claim that the negative property of mere nonexistence, whichdepends on the negation of things, has any establishment. From the perspectiveof a relative, deluded consciousness, however, actions and agents areestablished in mere mutual dependence. Hence, what we assert is the occurrenceof the illusion-like, mere conditionality that constitutes dependentorigination.We may consider the statement, “This is the agent of that action.” Thedesignation “agent” depends on there being an action, and since that action isprecisely that which the agent is performing, the action, in turn, depends onthe agent itself as well. Apart from this dependent occurrence of agent andaction, upon examination, we see no other cause of their establishment. They arenot established by virtue of any particular characteristics. Below, thefollowing question is raised:> If an entity is established in dependence,> And is itself depended on> By that upon which it depends,> What is established in dependence on what?131 Thus, it will be explained that things that are established in mutual dependencedo not have any nature.Extending This Analysis to Other TopicsThird, extending this analysis to other topics, the treatise states:> Appropriation should be understood in the same way,> As here action and agent have been excluded.> Agent and action will provide> Understanding of the remaining issues. [VIII.13] It has been explained that while action and agent are established in mutualdependence as mere conventions, they are not naturally established. In the samemanner, appropriation should be understood to be established as mere conventiondue to mutual dependencies, and thus not as established by nature (although onlythe activity of appropriation is explicitly mentioned, this implies the factorsthat constitute appropriation, that is, the appropriated aggregates and theappropriating self ). That this is the status of the appropriated aggregates andthe appropriating self follows from the way that we have excluded any naturalestablishment of action and agent.Yet the present reasoning can be extended beyond these two factors. Allremaining things—cause and effect, characteristics and their bearers, signifiedand signifier, cognition and objects of cognition, reliable means of cognitionand the objects evaluated thereby, and so forth—all such topics taught in thetreatises can be understood in the same way. As conventions, they areestablished in mutual dependence, yet none of them are established by nature.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE Third, to sum up, in terms of the ultimate, the present chapter has provided anexistential negation of the constructs associated with all phenomena. Withrespect to the relative, it has also established a dependent origination that isa mere illusion. This is precisely the intent of the following teaching from theNoble Sūtra Requested by Upāli:> I have taught about the horrors of hell,> And so saddened many thousands of sentient beings.> Yet beings that die and transfer to terrifying realms of misery,> Such wandering beings never existed.> The torturers, brandishing their great swords and arrows,> Have never had any existence either.> It is the power of thought that creates the experience> Of a body within such realms of misery.> There are no weapons. This concludes the explanation of the eighth chapter, the analysis of action andagent, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.128. From the Sālu Sprout.129.

Root of the Middle Way, X.10."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF PRIOR EXISTENCEHAVING SHOWN that dependent origination is empty of any self in the form ofphenomena, it will next be explained how it contains no self in the form of aperson. First, the analysis of prior existence refutes the naturally establishedessence of the person. This chapter will be treated in three sections, the firstof which addresses the chapter’s context.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 9 The present chapter relates to the teachings of the profound sūtras. The Motherof the Victorious Ones, for example, states, “Form is empty of I and mine.”While the Journey to Laṅkā, explains:> This so-called self is a demonic idea;> From this, views issue forth.> These conditioned aggregates are empty;> Here, there is no self and no sentient being. Thus, all the sūtras teach the complete nonexistence of any subject that isinvolved in doing or feeling. It is the meaning of that very teaching that thepresent chapter employs reasoning to ascertain.As for its relationship to the other chapters of the text, the analysis of priorexistence serves as a refutation of an idea such as the following: “It wasearlier taught that the appropriated and the one who appropriates have nonature. Yet that is not tenable because the appropriator exists before theappropriated and appropriates in that capacity. Hence, both the appropriator andappropriated exist by nature.”THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 9 Second, explaining the content of this chapter includes (1) a refutation of theappropriating self, (2) a refutation of what the self appropriates, and (3) theresulting conclusion.THE APPROPRIATING SELF The first issue is twofold. The view of the opposition is presented first.The View of the OppositionThe treatise states:> Some assert that sight, hearing, and the rest,> As well as sensation and so forth,> Are in the possession of, and belong to,> Something that precedes them. [IX.1] > If there were no thing,> How could there be sight and so forth?> Hence, prior to these factors,> There is an abiding entity. [IX.2] Some of the Sammitīyas within our own tradition will object when it is saidthat:> Appropriation should be understood in the same way,> As here action and agent have been excluded.132 Thus, they will argue: “That statement is unreasonable. The appropriatedincludes sight, hearing, and the rest of the six inner sense sources, as well assensation, contact, volition, and so forth. All of these factors are in thepossession of, and appropriated by, something, namely, the person. Moreover,this person, this self that appropriates and possesses all of these, existsprior to them.”Explaining their rationale for this position, they will explain: “If the entityof the appropriating self did not exist before that which it appropriates, howcould it engage in the causal accumulation of action that is necessary for theresultant appropriation of sight, and so on? Any appropriation would be asimpossible as it is to take possession of the wealth that has been gathered bythe child of a barren woman. Therefore, prior to the appropriated sight, and soforth, the abiding entity of a self, which is the one that takes possession,must exist.”RefutationTo disprove this view, the following notions are refuted: (1) the appropriator’sexistence prior to the totality of appropriated factors, (2) its existence priorto each individually, and (3) that there is an appropriator of the causes ofsight, and so on.The Appropriator’s Existence Prior to the Totality of the Appropriated FactorsThe first section addresses two points. We begin with a refutation that callsattention to the absence of any reason for speaking of a “self.”No Grounds for Speaking of a SelfThe treatise states:> Before sight, hearing, and the rest,> And before sensation and so on,> What are your grounds for speaking> Of that abiding entity’s existence? [IX.3] A sūtra teaches:> Based on the assembly of its parts> We can speak of “a chariot.”> Likewise, based on the aggregates> We speak relatively of “a sentient being.” In general, “the self” is an imputation based on the aggregates. Morespecifically, the self that sees, for instance, is labeled as such based onthere being sight. Now, think of that appropriator, the abiding entity of self,which is held to exist prior to sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, andcognition; which is held to precede the consciousness of sensation, etc., and bepresent before contact, sensation, and so forth. When none of these factors yetexist, what grounds are there for speaking of a person? What seeing, or anyother phenomenon, is there that could make us conceive of “a seeing subject,”etc? Indeed, since there is no seeing, nor any other reason for thinking interms of a person, we can conclude that a self, such as “someone who sees,” isas nonexistent as the child of a barren woman.Refutation of a Self That Is Independent of the Bases for ImputationSecond, the refutation of a self that is independent of the bases for imputationincludes (1) stating an absurd consequence of this position and (2) showing thatthis consequence is unacceptable.An Absurd ConsequenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If this remains in the absence> Of sight and these other factors,> Then they will undoubtedly be present> Even in the absence of that. [IX.4] Why should the self of the appropriator not exist even in the absence ofsomething to appropriate, such as sight? Well, by the same token, sight andwhatever else is included in the appropriated aggregates would then undoubtedlybe present even if there were no appropriating self.Why This Consequence Is UnacceptableSecond, a reply is given to the opponent, who at this point accepts theconsequence presented above. The treatise states:> Something manifests somebody,> And somebody manifests something.> How could somebody exist in the absence of anything?> How could something exist in the absence of anybody? [IX.5] In the world, people say things such as, “This is the cause of that, and that isthe effect of this.” Thus, the cause and effect that they talk about aremutually dependent. One cannot be without the other. Likewise, when it is saidthat, “This is the appropriator of that,” the appropriator is manifested andlabeled as such because there is something that is appropriated, such as sight.Likewise, when something is classified as “the appropriation of such and such,”it is the presence of the self that appropriates that manifests sight andprovides the grounds for it to be labeled as appropriation.Hence, how could there possibly be somebody, that is, the self of anappropriator, in the complete absence of sight or another factor that isappropriated? The point of reference would be missing. Again, if the point ofreference is missing, if there is no appropriating self at all, how could therethen be sight or another factor that is appropriated? In either case, it isimpossible to have one without the other.The Appropriator’s Existence Prior to the Individual Appropriated FactorsAs for the second issue, the treatise states:> This is not present before> The totality of sight and so forth.> Yet each factor among sight and the rest> Individually makes it manifest. [IX.6] It may be thought: “The self cannot be asserted to exist prior to the totalityof appropriated factors, such as sight, because that would lead to the flawsjust mentioned. As this is the case, the self cannot exist in such a manner.Nevertheless, as separate instances of sight, hearing, and so forth occur intemporal succession, they each individually serve to make the appropriatormanifest and classifiable as such. The flaw of there being no basis for speakingof a self is, therefore, not applicable.”RefutationThe refutation of this account is twofold. First we will show that unless theself is present before all of the factors in their totality, it cannotreasonably exist prior to each of them individually. On this point, the treatisestates:> Unless it precedes the totality> Of sight and the rest,> How could it possibly precede> Each of them individually? [IX.7] If the self is always present before any of the individual occurrences ofappropriated factors, it follows that in the end it must be present before theirtotality. Hence, given that it does not exist before all of these factorscollectively, how could it possibly be present before each and every one of themindividually? There cannot be any “totality” apart from the full collection ofthe individual factors, so if the self is present before each single factor,this also means that it exists earlier than them.The second section refutes this notion by pointing out that neither identicalnor distinct appropriators can reasonably exist prior to the individualappropriated factors. The treatise states:> If that which sees were that which hears,> And what hears were that which senses,> This would exist before every one of them,> Yet that does not make sense. [IX.8] > If the seer, the hearer and the one that senses> Were all different from each other,> The hearer could be present at the time of the seer> And there would be multiple selves. [IX.9] Let us assume that it were possible for a mere self to precede sight and everyother appropriated factor, yet without existing prior to their totality. If thiswere the case, it would still not make sense for the appropriator of, forexample, an instance of sight to exist prior to the sight that it appropriates.The appropriator of sight is held to be the self that is involved in sight, andthat self is, moreover, identical with the self that engages in hearing andsensation. Thus, a hearer may be present before the presence of sight, but thathearer would be the same as the seer. Therefore, it follows that a givenappropriator, such as the seer, would be present before the sight that itappropriates. Such a scenario of a single agent performing a series of distinctactions is, therefore, untenable. The hearer may exist before there is sight,but the seer cannot. It does not make sense that a given appropriator existsbefore that which it appropriates.Wishing to avoid the contradictory idea of a single agent performing differentsuccessive actions, the opponent may argue that there are differentappropriators involved in seeing, hearing, sensing, and so forth. Yet, sincethese appropriators differ from each other, they will be independent of eachother as well. Hence, in the same way that a horse and a cow can be present atthe same time because they do not depend on each other, a hearer and any and allof the other agents can then be present at the same time that a seer is present.This conflicts with the opponent’s own denial of the six collections beingsimultaneous. Moreover, accepting such an idea would make one committed to theseer, hearer, and so on all being different selves. This would also conflictwith the scriptural statement: “When the world is born, it is one single personthat is born.”Refuting the Appropriator of the Causes of Sight, and so ForthOn the third issue, the treatise states:> Sight, hearing, and the rest,> As well as sensation and so forth—> Among the causes from which these emerge,> There is no existence of that. [IX.10] It may be thought: “The self exists before the entirety of factors such assight. It is not the case that we have no basis for designating the self as suchbecause it is taught, ‘Due to the conditions of name and form, the six sensesources arise.’ Thus, given the causal presence of the forms of the fourelements that join with the four names in the subtle embryo, there will also bea presence of the self that appropriates these effects.”Yet we cannot find any appropriating self among the causes from which sight,hearing, and the other internal sense sources, as well as sensation and soforth, emerge. No appropriator exists among the material elements that cometogether with four names and make up the subtle embryo. As we have seen, theappropriating self cannot be present before the material elements that itappropriates. Hence, given the absence of the appropriator, it does not makesense for there to be any appropriation taking place either.THE APPROPRIATED Some groups, including the Followers of Sūtra, claim that although there is noself that appropriates, there is still the mere process of the appropriation ofsight and so forth. Hence, in the second section, the text offers a refutationof the appropriated. The treatise states:> Sight, hearing, and the rest,> As well as sensation and so forth—> If there is no one to whom these belong,> Then they do not exist either. [IX.11] If there were someone who appropriates, there would also be appropriations. Yetit was already shown that there is no such self that appropriates; there isnobody that takes possession of factors such as sight and hearing, or ofsensation and so forth. There is no one to whom all these factors belong. Thismeans that there is nobody to accumulate the karmic actions that establish thesefactors. It also means that the counterpart necessary to designate sight and soforth as appropriations will be absent. None of the appropriated factors can,therefore, have any natural existence either.CONCLUSION Third, in conclusion, the treatise states:> That which does not exist> Before, together with, or after sight and the rest> Will no longer be thought about> As existent or nonexistent. [IX.12] The appropriated and the appropriator are, as we have seen, mutually dependent.Therefore, the self of the appropriator does not exist prior to sight and othersuch factors, for when these do not exist, all reasons for designating a selfwill be missing as well. Neither does the appropriator coexist with thesefactors because it has no establishment separate from them. Moreover, ifappropriator and appropriated were simultaneous, they would be independent ofeach other. Finally, the appropriating self does not exist subsequent to factorssuch as sight either. If the appropriated preceded the appropriator, it would,in the absence of the latter, lack its cause. The same goes for theappropriated: it is not established before, together with, or after theappropriator. Given that the appropriating self and appropriated factors, suchas sight, do not exist simultaneously or in succession, what intelligent personwould then think that they are established by nature?Given the above, someone may then ask whether or not we hold the appropriatorand appropriated to be nonexistent. Well, as has been taught:> Here the intent is to negate existence,> Not to prove nonexistence.133 Hence, this has simply been a refutation of the imputations made by others thatthese things exist by nature. What intelligent person would take this as groundsfor believing in the negative formula, “In reality, these have no nature”? Whenthe nature of something is as unobservable as the child of a barren woman, allthoughts of its existence or nonexistence will come to an end.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE Third, to summarize, the present chapter has explicitly shown that the self andthe aggregates are, in reality, free from all mental constructs of existence andnonexistence. It has likewise explained explicitly how, in terms of therelative, they are illusion-like and established in mutual dependence. Hence,the implicit message is that all dependently originated phenomena transcend theextremes of existence and nonexistence in reality and that relatively they areillusion-like. This is also the intent of the Noble Jewel Mound, which states:> “Kāśyapa, “existence” is one extreme and “nonexistence” another. The middle> that lies between these two cannot be shown or cognized. It does not appear> and does not remain. Kāśyapa, on the path of the Middle Way, this is referred> to as “discernment.” This concludes the explanation of the ninth chapter, the analysis of priorexistence, from the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the MiddleWay.132.

The present chapter employs reasoning to ascertain the intent of such teachings.As for its relation to the other chapters in the text, the present discussionoffers a reply to the following objection: “The appropriated aggregates and theappropriating self are mutually dependent, but that does not conflict with theirnatural existence, just as fire and fuel are mutually dependent, but still existby nature as the object and agent in burning.”Thus, here it will be shown that fire and fuel are not naturally established.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 10 Second, the content of chapter 10 (1) refutes the notion that fire and fuel areestablished by nature, (2) extends this reasoning to other topics, and (3)offers a concluding rebuke of views.ARE FIRE AND FUEL ESTABLISHED BY NATURE? The first issue involves (1) refuting the essences of fire and fuel by examiningwhether they are the same or different, (2) refuting the arguments that areadvanced to support these views, and (3) providing a summary of the meaning ofthese refutations.Are Fire and Fuel the Same or Different?If fire and fuel exist by nature, are they identical or different from eachother?Fire and Fuel Are Not the SameRefuting the first option, the treatise states:> If fuel were the same as fire,> Then agent and object would be the same. [X.1a–b] If the fuel that is burned were the same as the fire that burns it, all agentsand objects would, by the same token, be identical as well. This, however,cannot be accepted because it is impossible for something to act on itself. Ifthis were the case, it would follow that the potter and his pots, or thewoodcutter and his wood, could be essentially the same.Fire and Fuel Are Not DifferentThe second option, that fire and fuel are different, will be refuted by pointingout how, as a consequence, (1) fire would be independent of fuel and (2) therewould be no contact between the two.Fire Is Not Independent of FuelThe first issue involves showing that (1) fire would be observable independentof fuel, (2) fire would be causeless, and so forth, and (3) that neither ofthese two consequences can be questioned.Fire Would Be Observable Independent of FuelOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If fire were different from fuel,> Then it would burn even without it. [X.1c–d] If fire were essentially different than fuel, it would occur independent of it.This entailment is valid because when the essential difference of two things,such as a vase and woolen garment, is established, there is no reason for themto depend on each other. This has already been decisively explained.The consequence of fire being independent of fuel is unacceptable because theobservation of fire that is independent of fuel would be the observation of aburner where nothing is burnt. Because this is not the case, fire depends onfuel, and because of this dependence, fire cannot be established as somethingother than fuel.Fire Would Be Causeless, and so ForthOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Fire would burn forever,> It would not arise from what causes it to burn,> Trying to light it would be pointless,> And it would not relate to any object. [X.2] > Because it would not depend on anything else,> It would not arise from what causes it to burn.> Because it would burn eternally,> Lighting it would be pointless. [X.3] Furthermore, if fire were something other than fuel, it would not arise fromwhat causes it to burn, that is, fuel. Moreover, it will not be possible toobject to this by stating that this is not entailed because if fire is somethingother than fuel, then it will be as independent of fuel as a pot is of ablanket. Hence, if fire is not dependent on fuel, it follows that its burningcannot arise from that fuel, which is what causes it to burn. Alternatively,this can also be read as an elaborate explanation of the consequence [that wasstated in the last two lines of the first stanza].Were one to accept the consequence that fire does not arise from what causes itto burn, it would also follow that fire burns forever. As is taught:> Since the uncaused does not depend on anything,> It would be permanently present or absent.135 As stated here, if there were a time when fire did not burn, there could neverbe any burning later on either because a coming together of factors that firedepends on would be precluded. Likewise, if it burns just once, it would go onburning forever because there would, in the same way, never be any lack of thefactors necessary for fire.Moreover, if this consequence is accepted, a third consequence will follow: anyactivity that uses fuel to start a fire would then be pointless. Given that fireburns forever, it would be impossible to start or maintain a fire by doingcertain things to fuel, such as arranging and igniting it.Accepting this consequence will lead to a fourth: If doing things to fuel forthe sake of fire is futile in this way, there may also be fire in the absence ofthat object to which fire relates, namely, fuel (the word “either” in the fourthverse of the second stanza indicates the relation [between these fourconsequences]). This consequence is unacceptable because it is contradictory forthere to be something that performs an act of burning without anything beingburned, just as there can be no fire that burns the body of the child of abarren woman.Here, one should also understand the implicit presence of the reversals of thesefour consequences: There is no fire that does not relate to its object, the fuelthat it burns. It is, therefore, meaningful to gather fuel if one wishes tostart or maintain a fire. Since such activity does serve a purpose, fire issomething that emerges from the cause of burning, that is, fuel. Finally, sinceit does emerge from its causes, fire is not different than fuel.Neither of the Consequences Can Be QuestionedThird, showing how neither of these consequences can be questioned, the treatisestates:> It may be thought that the fuel> Is that which is burning,> But if that is all that it is,> What is it that burns the fuel? [X.4] It was argued that if fire were different from fuel, it would be independent ofit. This would mean that a) fire could be observed in the absence of fuel and b)fire would not arise from the fuel that causes it to burn. Faced with these twoconsequences, someone may object in the following way: “Although fire issomething other than fuel, that does not mean that it cannot depend on it. Fuelis precisely that which is in the process of being burned by fire, so fueldepends on fire. Fire, in turn, is precisely that which performs the act ofburning the fuel, so it is dependent on fuel as well. Hence, fire and fuel aredifferent from one another, as well as mutually dependent. In this way, they areunlike a vase and a blanket, which are distinct but also independent. For thesereasons, neither of the above consequences are applicable.”Such a line of thought would make sense if fire could burn fuel, but this is notfeasible. Given the subject, fuel, what fire is it that burns it? Indeed, thereis no fire that does so. We argue this by pointing out how fuel was identifiedas simply that which is in the process of burning. This entails that no fire canburn the fuel because it is impossible to observe any fire that performs the actof burning apart from that which is in the process of burning. The fuel can,therefore, not be burnt because it is impossible for something to act uponitself. For these reasons, it does not work to say that fuel is that which fireis in the process of burning, whereas fire is that which is in the process ofburning fuel. The position that these two are both dependent and different thenbecomes untenable, and so the attempt at blocking these consequences has failed.There Could Be No Contact between Fire and FuelIf fire and fuel were distinct, but also dependent, they could not meet at anyplace or time. Since there could not be any contact between them, fuel could notbe burned by fire, and, therefore, it could not be that which fire is in theprocess of burning. In this way, the Commentary considers the followingdiscussion a refutation of the notion that fuel is that which is in the processof burning.Alternatively, the arguments below can also be understood as a refutation offire and fuel being different. Having already refuted that fire and fuel aredistinct by pointing to the consequence that they then would be independent ofeach other, the text can be seen to further refute their distinctness by showingthat fire could then not come into contact with fuel.The discussion of this issue is divided into two sections. First, theconsequences are presented. The treatise states:> If they are distinct, they do not touch;> If they do not touch, nothing is burned;> If nothing is burned, nothing dies out;> If nothing dies out, it will remain with its mark. [X.5] Since fire and fuel are different substances, they cannot meet anywhere in spaceor time, like light and darkness. Since these two do not come into contact, firecannot burn fuel, just as we know will be the case when fire and fuel areseparated in terms of space or time. Since fire can then not burn any fuel, itis independent of burning fuel. Hence, it will not die out if there is no longerany fuel. Finally, if this is the case, then fire will continue to display itsunique marks and characteristics even in the absence of fuel. This, however, isuntenable because once its fuel has run out, we no longer observe the heat andburning that are the defining characteristics of fire.This line of consequences also implies four reversals. Fire does go out when itsfuel is gone. Therefore, fuel is burnt by fire, and because fuel is burnt byfire, fire comes into contact with fuel. As this is the case, fire is notdifferent than fuel.These Consequences Cannot Be QuestionedSecond, showing how these consequences are unquestionable, the treatise states:> Just as a woman touches a man> And a man touches a woman,> Fire can be different from fuel,> And yet still touch it. [X.6] > If fire and fuel,> Would exclude each other,> Fire would be different from fuel,> And so fire could touch fuel. [X.7] It may be thought: “Fire and fuel are different things, but just as a man and awoman can touch each other, the two can still come into contact with oneanother.”When a man and a woman come together, their contact is between two things thatare mutually different and independent. If fire and fuel were two different andindependent things, this type of contact would be possible, but they are not.There is, therefore, no contact between them.To elaborate, if fire and fuel were mutually exclusive and independent of eachother in the same way that a man and a woman are, then there could also be atime when they came together. Fire could then be something other than fuel andyet still touch it. But since fire and fuel are not established as different andindependent things like a man and woman, their meeting is altogether impossible.Refutation of ArgumentsSecond, the refutation of the [advanced] arguments is divided into two sections,the first of which is a refutation of dependence.Are Fuel and Fire Mutually Dependent?It may be thought: “It may be the case that fire and fuel are not both differentand independent. Nevertheless, because they are dependent, they exist by nature.Something nonexistent, like the child of a barren woman, could not possiblydepend on something else.”From the unexamined perspective of a deluded mind, there does indeed seem to bedependence. Nevertheless, as in the case of a reflection, such mere appearancesdo not imply any natural establishment. Moreover, upon examination, we will findthat dependence itself is not established. This discussion involves (1) showingwhy neither sequential nor simultaneous fire and fuel can be dependent, (2)showing why neither established nor unestablished fire and fuel can bedependent, and (3) drawing the conclusion.Why neither Sequential nor Simultaneous Fire and Fuel Can Be DependentFirst, refuting the dependence between fire and fuel that occurs in sequence,the treatise states:> If fire depends on fuel> And fuel depends on fire,> Of fire and fuel, the two dependents,> Which is established first? [X.8] > If fire depended on fuel,> An established fire would be reestablished,> And fuel would end up> Existing without fire. [X.9] We may state that “fire is that which burns fuel,” positing fire in dependenceon fuel. Having done that, we may in turn present fuel in dependence on fire bysaying, “Fuel is that which fire burns.” Since fuel, then, is responsible forthe establishment of fire, it follows that it will itself have to be establishedbefore fire. Yet what fuel could exist prior to fire? If it is not in theprocess of being consumed by fire, then it is not fuel.If, alternatively, fuel is established in dependence on fire, then it followsthat fire is established first. Yet what kind of fire would that be? Such a firewould have no cause. Therefore, neither fire nor fuel can be established beforethe other, and this means that neither of them can be established in dependenceon the other.Moreover, if fire depended on fuel, an already established fire would have to bereestablished. This entailment is valid since it does not make sense for fire todepend on something if it is not established, as is the case with the child of abarren woman. This position, moreover, is also unacceptable because fire that isalready established does not need to be established by fuel. Hence, since it isalready there, its reestablishment by fuel would be pointless.The position that fire depends on fuel and that an unestablished fire thenbecomes established is also untenable. The unestablished cannot be established.All of these points are implicit in the first two lines of the ninth stanza.Also, if fire were established in dependence on fuel, fuel would end up existingwithout fire. That this is entailed can be seen from the fact that if no fuel isestablished, fire clearly cannot depend on it, and if fire is established, thenit does not need to depend on anything.Showing why dependence between simultaneous fire and fuel is untenable, thetreatise states:> If an entity is established in dependence,> And is itself depended on> By that upon which it depends,> What is established in dependence on what? [X.10] It may be thought: “Fire and fuel are not established sequentially. Rather, theyare strictly simultaneous and are established in mutual dependence as such. Theaforementioned flaw, therefore, does not apply.”This, however, is not acceptable. If the entity of fire is established independence on fuel, and if that fuel upon which fire depends in turn depends onfire for its own establishment, then what fire is it that depends, and on whatfuel? If fire is established, it does not need to depend on fuel. Alternatively,if fire is not established, it cannot become so by depending on fuel because thefuel itself requires [the establishment of ] fire [as a condition for its ownestablishment].Likewise, if the entity of fuel is established in dependence on fire, and if thefire that is depended on itself depends on fuel, then what fuel is it thatdepends, and on what fire? An established fuel does not need to depend onanything else, and if fuel is not established, it cannot be established independence on fire because the latter itself requires fuel for its ownestablishment.Why neither Established nor Unestablished Fire and Fuel Can Be DependentOn the second issue, the treatise states:> How could an entity that is established in dependence> Depend on something when it is not established?> If it is said that it depends while established,> Its dependence does not make any sense. [X.11] If is held that the entity of fire is established in dependence on fuel, we mayask whether that which depends on fuel is established or not. If it is notestablished, how could it depend on anything? Similarly, the horn of a rabbitcannot depend on anything either. Any form of dependence must always involve twothings, that which is dependent and that which is depended upon. Unless there issomething that depends, it does not make sense to speak of something beingdepended on.On the other hand, to claim that an established fire depends on fuel is alsountenable, precisely because the fire is already established. This entailment isvalid because if something is already established, it follows that it cannotdepend on anything because that which is already established cannot beinfluenced by anything at all.The same problems ensue if we consider whether an established or unestablishedfuel depends on fire.Drawing the ConclusionThird, drawing the conclusion, the treatise states:> There is no fire that depends on fuel,> There is no fire that does not depend on fuel.> There is no fuel that depends on fire,> There is no fuel that does not depend on fire. [X.12] Upon examination, it will be seen that dependence itself is untenable. There is,therefore, no fire that depends on fuel. Is fire then independent of fuel? No,for even in terms of the unexamined conventional perspective there is no firethat does not depend on fuel. Such fire would lack any cause. Likewise, once weinvestigate, we will find no fuel that depends on fire. Meanwhile, because fuelis precisely that which is burned by fire, there is no fuel that is independentof fire either, even in terms of the unexamined conventional perspective.Fire and Fuel Cannot Be Established by PerceptionSecond, refuting the use of perception as proof, the treatise states:> Fire does not come from anything else,> Nor is there any fire in the fuel.> The rest about fuel has been explained> By what was, will be, and is being traversed. [X.13] It may be thought: “Why should we ponder whether fire and fuel are essentiallythe same or different? We can directly perceive that fire burns fuel, so thesethings do exist by nature.”However, this observation is not made by perception that is free from delusionbecause once we examine, we find that fire is not fit to burn fuel. If fireburns fuel, does it do so having come from something other than the fuel? Or wasit already present in the fuel before it began to burn? The first cannot be thecase because we cannot observe any fire that emerges from anything other thanfuel. Moreover, since there is no fire in the absence of its cause, namely,fuel, fire is not something that somehow comes to fuel. As fire alwaysaccompanies fuel, it does not need to be added to fuel, for this would serve nopurpose.The alternative is not acceptable either. Fire is not present in fuel before itstarts burning because we do not observe any such presence.It might then be thought, “Fire is indeed present in fuel from the beginning,but it takes certain conditions, such as a match, to manifest.”This notion is not acceptable either. If the fire’s own essence is alreadyestablished, it need not be made [manifest by conditions], and if it is mademanifest, this shows that it did not exist earlier. The position that the resultis present in the cause is, therefore, indefensible.The remaining arguments that disprove fire’s burning fuel were explainedearlier, when it was shown that going cannot be present where it has alreadytaken place, where it has yet to occur, or where it is currently taking place.Thus, it is now easy to alter the previous verse, so that it states, “Whereburning has been there is none …,” and so on.As we have now seen, there is no such thing as fire that burns fuel. Anyperception to the contrary will, hence, be as false as that of fire burning fuelin a dream. In this way, the Commentary treats the present stanza as arefutation of the use of perception to prove that fire and fuel are establishedby nature.Some hold that the first half of the stanza is a refutation of fire’s beingbased on fuel, and that the latter half is a refutation of the activity ofburning fuel.A Summary of the Meaning of the RefutationsThird, offering a summary, the treatise states:> Fuel is not the same as fire,> Nor is there fire apart from fuel.> Fire does not possess fuel.> Fuel is not in fire, nor is fire in fuel. [X.14] The preceding reasoning has shown that while fuel is not the same as fire, thereis no fire apart from fuel either. This same reasoning also makes it clear thatfire cannot possess fuel, regardless of whether such a possession is thought ofin terms of fire and fuel being identical or distinct from one another.Moreover, when one thing is supported by another, it follows that the two aredistinct. We may, therefore, also conclude that fire does not support fuel, justa fuel does not support fire. Therefore, since fire and fuel are not establishedin any of these five ways, it has been established that they have no nature.EXTENDING THE REASONING TO OTHER TOPICS Second, extending this analysis to other topics, the treatise states:> Through the treatment of fire and fuel,> The self and its appropriation,> Along with vases, woolen garments, and so forth,> Have all been explained without exception. [X.15] Once we examine fire and fuel with respect to the five positions that arereferred to in the fourteenth stanza, we end up not finding anything. The samefivefold analysis can be applied in precisely the same way to the self and whatit appropriates, such as the aggregates. We will then notice that the selfcannot be identical with the aggregates since this would make object and agentone. Neither can the self be different from the aggregates. If it were, it wouldhave to be observable as such. Moreover, since it would be independent of thecausal aggregates, there would be no reason to conceive of any self based onthem.Having refuted the notions that the self and the aggregates are the same ordifferent in this way, we have also excluded the possibilities of the self’spossessing the aggregates (either by being identical to or different from them),the self’s being the support of the aggregates, and the self ’s being supportedby the aggregates. Yet the fivefold treatment of fire and fuel is applicable notonly to the self and the aggregates. It can just as well be applied to vases,garments, and all other such things, for it applies to, and explains, everythingthat is contained within parts and wholes, causes and effects, orcharacteristics and the bearers of characteristics.Therefore, our insight that fire and fuel cannot be established in terms of anyof the five positions referred to in the fourteenth stanza is applicable to alldependently originated phenomena. Independent phenomena are, moreover,impossible. Hence, in these five steps, we may examine the relationship betweenany dependent phenomenon and the things upon which it depends. In the process,the conceptually constructed reality of all dependently originated phenomenawill be existentially negated. Likewise, such an examination will, in terms ofthe relative, also affirm that while these phenomena cannot be said to be eitherthe same or different from each other, they resemble an illusion. This verymessage is taught in the following passage from a sūtra:> When the drilling stick, its support,> And the manual efforts all coincide,> Fire will occur due to these conditions.> Having arisen, fire functions and quickly ceases. > “Where did it come from?” or “Where did it go to?”> What wise person would make such enquiries?> We may search in all the cardinal and intermediate directions,> Yet never will we succeed in finding its going or coming. > The aggregates, elements, and sense sources> Are all empty, without and within.> All are devoid of self and without support;> Their reality and characteristics are of the nature of space.136 A REBUKE OF VIEWS Third, in a concluding rebuke of views, the treatise states:> Those who teach that self and entities> Are the same or different> I do not consider knowledgeable> About the meaning of the teachings. [X.16] While the meaning of dependent origination is established in this manner, somemembers of our own tradition lack understanding of this most profound principle.In their ignorance, they teach that mutually dependent phenomena–such as theappropriating self and the appropriated aggregates, causes and their effects,wholes and parts, and characteristics and their bearers– are either essentiallyindistinguishable or essentially distinct. Concerning such individuals, theMaster states, “I, Nāgārjuna, do not consider such people knowledgeable aboutthe meaning of the Able One’s most profound teaching of dependent origination.The dependent origination that the Buddha teaches cannot be described in termsof identity or difference; it lies beyond both permanence and annihilation.” Inone of his praises, the Master thus proclaims:> Wandering beings are like an echo,> Beyond all sameness and difference,> They are free from transmigration and destruction.> This is what you, the irreproachable, comprehended in full.137 This concludes the explanation of the tenth chapter, the analysis of fire andfuel, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.134. In this chapter the summary appears to be contained in the section on“Extending the Reasoning to Other Topics.”135. Dharmakīrti, Commentary on Reliable Means of Cognition, I.35a–b.136.

The current chapter employs reasoning to ascertain the meaning of such passages,which state that cyclic existence has no nature.As for its relationship to the other chapters of the text, the present analysisconstitutes a reply to the following idea: “The essence of the personal self andits metaphor, fire and fuel, may have been refuted, yet a sūtra teaches:> Monks, this cycle of birth, aging, and death has no beginning and it has no> end. Thus, since this passage teaches the existence of cyclic existence, we may alsoinfer the existence of the self that cycles through these phases.”As a reply to this view, the present chapter will show that since cyclicexistence, when examined, can be seen to be not established, the self that issupposed to cycle through it cannot be established either.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 11 Second, the explanation of the content involves (1) refuting the naturalexistence of cyclic existence and (2) applying this refutation to other topics.IS CYCLIC EXISTENCE NATURALLY EXISTENT? The first section includes demonstrations that (1) cyclic existence has nobeginning, end, and middle and that (2) birth, on the one hand, and aging anddeath, on the other, can be neither sequential nor simultaneous.Cyclic Existence Has No Beginning, End, or MiddleOn the first issue, the treatise states:> When asked whether any beginning can be seen,> The Able One answered in the negative.> Cyclic existence has no beginning or end;> There is no before and there is no after. [XI.1] > When something has neither beginning nor end,> How could it possibly have a middle? [XI.2a–b] If cyclic existence existed by nature, it would need to have a beginning,middle, and end, just like a vase. Yet since cyclic existence does not have abeginning, middle, or end, as is the case with space, it has no naturalexistence. That is the implicit message of the preceding stanza.As for the property of this position, it is indeed possible to use reasoningthat is accepted by others to prove that cyclic existence has neither of thesethree. However, first the position will be established for members of our owntradition by means of the Able One’s scriptural authority. Hence, when askedwhether any beginning of cyclic existence can be seen, the Great Able One, theBuddha, the Transcendent Conqueror, replied in the negative with the followingwords:> Those who are obscured by ignorance and bound by craving race around in a> circle, bound by the infinite chain of craving. No beginning to this process> can be seen. Likewise, he also said:> Monks, this cycle of birth, aging, and death has no beginning and no end. Thus, cyclic existence has no beginning and no end. In other words, there is nobefore and no after in cyclic existence.It might be thought that since it has not been refuted, the middle of cyclicexistence must still have natural existence. Yet when cyclic existence does nothave any beginning or end, as was just explained, how could it possibly have amiddle? When those two are not there to begin with, there cannot be anythingthat lies between them.Refutation of Sequence and SimultaneityThe second topic is divided into three sections: (1) presentation, (2)explanation, and (3) conclusion.PresentationOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Therefore, cyclic existence cannot> Be either sequential or simultaneous. [XI.2c–d] Cyclic existence does not have beginning, end, or middle. Therefore, birth,aging, and death, which constitute the nature of cyclic existence, cannotreasonably occur in sequence or simultaneously. This, in turn, means that cyclicexistence has no natural existence.ExplanationOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If birth came first> And aging and death followed later,> There would be birth without aging and death,> As well as birth without anyone having died. [XI.3] > If birth occurred later,> And aging and death before,> How could this causeless aging and death> Happen to someone who was never born? [XI.4] > Birth, aging, and death> Cannot occur simultaneously,> For the one being born would then be dying,> And both would be lacking their cause. [XI.5] To refute the sequential occurrence of birth, aging, and death, let us firstconsider the notion of a birth that occurs before aging and death. Thus, thetarget here is the idea that birth is prior to an aging and death that may beeither identical with, or distinct from, the entity of birth. Thus, given thesubject, birth, it follows that it can occur without there being any aging anddeath. Moreover, if birth preceded aging and death, the one who is born wouldnot be someone who has died. These propositions, however, are untenable becausethey imply that birth is, respectively, permanent and causeless—two qualitiesthat are incompatible with being an entity.Next is a refutation of the notion that aging and death precede birth. If birthoccurred later, preceded by aging and death, then how could aging and death behappening to someone who never was born? Indeed, like a sky flower, aging anddeath would have no cause.Finally, it is refuted that birth occurs simultaneously with aging and death. Itis impossible for birth to occur at the same time as aging and death in the sametime in one thing. As a consequence, if these events occurred simultaneously,the one who is being born would also be dying, and it is impossible to have thetwo incompatible activities of manifesting and disintegrating occur at the sametime in the same thing. Furthermore, if they were simultaneous, birth would beindependent of aging and dying, which again would mean that both of these eventswould be lacking their cause.ConclusionThird, in conclusion, the treatise states:> As it is impossible for them to occur> In sequence or simultaneously,> Why would anyone think> In terms of birth, aging, and death? [XI.6] For the reasons explained above, birth cannot occur sequentially in relation toaging and death, yet neither can the two be simultaneous. Hence, they cannot beobserved at all. Why would anyone, then, whether a noble or a childishindividual, ever think or speak in terms of there really being, or there reallynot being, any such things as birth, aging, and death? Indeed, they would not.If they did, they would not make sense.EXTENDING THIS ANALYSIS TO OTHER TOPICS Third, extending this insight to other topics, the treatise states:> Not only does cyclic existence> Have no beginning,> But also cause and effect,> Characteristics and their bearers, [XI.7] > Feelings and those that feel—> Whatever there may be.> The same applies to all things;> None have a beginning. [XI.8] We have examined the birth and the aging and death that pervade cyclic existenceand found that they have no beginning and do not coincide. But this is the casenot only with this pair. When we examine cause and effect, characteristics andtheir bearers, feelings and those that feel, cognition and its object ofcognition, and so on—whatever there may be—we will find precisely the same.Indeed, all mutually dependent things do not have a beginning (as would be thecase if one were established before the other), and yet they do not coexist.This shows us that, in terms of the ultimate, all dependently establishedphenomena are emptiness, whereas relatively it is established that they are likean illusion. If cause preceded effect, the basis for designating the cause assuch would be missing. If, on the other hand, effects were present before theircauses, the essence of the effect would be uncaused. And if cause and effectwere simultaneous, they would both be causeless. This [insight] can be appliedto all [dependent phenomena]. In the Sūtra of the King of MeditativeAbsorptions, it is taught:> Phenomena are primordially empty, they have not arrived.> Not departing or remaining, they know no abiding.> Their nature is that of illusion, never is there any core.> Everything is pure, utterly pure, like space. > No end of cyclic existence can be found> And the beginnings of time are devoid of characteristics. This concludes the explanation of the eleventh chapter, the analysis ofbeginnings and ends, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of theMiddle Way.138. In this chapter there is no separate, final summary. Instead, the summaryappears to be included in the explanation of stanza XI.6."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF SUFFERINGTHE THREE ISSUES also pertain to the analysis of suffering. First, regarding itscontext, this chapter relates to the profound sūtras, such as a statement fromthe Mother of the Victorious Ones that proclaims, “There is no suffering!” andthe following passage from the Noble Sūtra on the Ten Grounds:> Children of the Victorious Ones, when it is understood that the painful> conditioning, with its myriad of problems, is devoid of any essence and has> neither arising nor cessation … It is the meaning of such statements that will here be proven through reasoning.As for its place among the other chapters of the text, the present chapterpresents a reply to the following objection: “The personal self may have beenrefuted. However, in the sūtras it is taught, ‘Birth is painful. Sickness,aging, and death are painful.’ Likewise, there is mention of ‘the aggregatesinvolved in the appropriation of suffering.’ Thus, the sūtras teach theexistence of the defiling aggregates, the constituents of suffering in its threeaspects. Given the existence of suffering, it follows that the person exists aswell, for the person is the support of suffering.”Hence, the present analysis will show that, since suffering itself does notarise in any of the four ways, there is no personal self that could serve as thesupport of suffering.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 12 Second, the explanation of the content of chapter 12 involves (1) stating theassertions of the logicians, (2) refuting these assertions, and (3) extendingthis analysis to other topics.THE ASSERTION OF THE LOGICIANS On the first issue, the treatise states:> Some say that suffering is produced by itself,> By something other, by both,> Or that it arises without a cause. [XII.1a–c] If suffering exists by nature, it must arise in one of the four extreme ways.Thus, some of the Enumerators claim that suffering is self-produced, whilecertain members of our own tradition assert that suffering is produced bysomething that is other. Those who believe in a primary principle that involvesan almighty God hold suffering to be created partly by itself and partly bysomething else. Finally, the Far Throwers and the Ritualists respectively teachthat there are no imperceptible causes of suffering and that suffering hasneither imperceptible nor perceptible causes.REFUTATION OF THE ASSERTIONS Second, to refute these assertions, a concise thesis is formed in the followingline:> Such production is not possible. [XII.1d] Suffering cannot feasibly arise, or be produced, in any of the four extreme waysproposed here.The Reasoning That Refutes the Arising of SufferingThe explanation of the refuting reasoning will cover (1) a refutation ofsuffering as arising either due to self or other, (2) a refutation of the notionthat suffering is created by both self and other, and (3) a refutation of theidea that suffering has no cause.Suffering Does Not Arise Due to Self or OtherThe first includes (1) a refutation of production by self and other withreference to suffering, (2) a refutation of production by self and other withreference to the person, and (3) a refutation of production by something otherfor the reason that nothing is produced by itself.Production By Self and Other with Reference to SufferingThe first section is divided into two discussions. We begin by looking atsuffering so as to refute that it produces itself. The treatise states:> If suffering were produced by itself,> It could not arise in dependence,> Because, based on these aggregates,> Those aggregates arise. [XII.2] If these appropriated aggregates of suffering were produced by themselves, theycould not arise in dependence on other causes and conditions. This is entailedbecause if the aggregates are already established, their arising due to causesand conditions would be meaningless. On the other hand, if they are notestablished, it would follow that there is nothing that can produce them. Yet weperceive that the subsequent aggregates associated with the quality of arisingcome about based on the earlier aggregates associated with the quality ofceasing. Therefore, it is impossible to accept that suffering arisesindependently of causes and conditions.Second, the treatise considers the process of appropriation so as to refute thenotion that suffering is produced by something other than itself:> If those were something other than these,> And these were something other than those,> Suffering would be produced by something other,> And they would produce something other. [XII.3] If the resultant aggregates associated with the quality of arising weresubstantially different from the causal aggregates associated with the qualityof cessation, then the product, suffering, would be produced by something otherthan itself. Likewise, if the causal aggregates associated with the quality ofcessation were substantially different from the resultant aggregates associatedwith the quality of arising, then the suffering that the causal aggregatesproduce would be something other than themselves. Yet cause and effect cannot besubstantially different because they are not simultaneously present. Also, iftwo things are established as substantially different, it would be meaninglessfor one to depend on the other. Hence, these two things could not be cause andeffect. Therefore, even if we allow that the causal aggregates associated withcessation produce the resultant aggregates associated with arising, it couldstill not be the case that the productive cause is different from its effect andthat the produced effect is different from its cause. The aggregates ofsuffering are, therefore, not produced by something other than themselves.Production by Self and Other with Reference to the PersonThe refutation of production by self and other with reference to the person hastwo parts. First is a refutation of the idea that suffering is produced by aperson who is identical with it. The treatise states:> If the person itself> Produces suffering,> Then what, apart from suffering,> Is this person who produces suffering? [XII.4] It may be thought: “Suffering is not passed from one person to another. Rather,that very person who is designated as such due to the presence of sufferingproduces the suffering himself or herself. Thus, suffering is self-produced.”This position in unacceptable as well. It may be thought that persons producetheir own suffering and that this is the reason for them being designated aspersons, but consider the human person who would then be held to be the producerof human suffering. What is that human person, apart from human suffering?Indeed, we will not observe any distinction between that suffering and theperson associated with it, and it is impossible for something to act on itself.Therefore, that suffering is not produced by the person.It may then be thought that the suffering experienced by a god has been createdby the person of its previous life as a human, for example. Thus, according tothis position, object and agent are distinct. Yet given such a scenario, whywould suffering not be produced by a different person? It cannot be argued thatwhile the sufferings of the god and the human in consecutive lifetimes aredistinct, the appropriating person is not because it is impossible to show anyperson that is essentially different than his or her suffering.The second refutation concerns suffering being produced by a different person.It may be thought: “The human of a past life and the god of a future life areindeed not the same. They are substantially different.Hence, the human person of the past life accumulates the formations that willproduce the suffering of the future god. Having done so, he passes it on to thedivine person and this serves as the grounds for designating that person. Thus,suffering is created by a different person.”The refutation of this idea contains two parts, the first of which is concernedwith the absence of an appropriator. The treatise states:> If suffering comes from a different person,> Then how, when produced by another person,> Could it be given to somebody> Who is something other than suffering? [XII.5] It may be believed that the suffering of the god in a future life is produced bya different human person in a previous life. If this is the case, how could thegod’s suffering, once it has been produced by this other person, be passed on toa divine person who is something other than suffering? We cannot observe anyappropriator of suffering apart from the suffering itself. Therefore, sufferingdoes not come from a different person.Second, considering the absence of a donor, the treatise states:> If suffering occurs because of another person,> Then who is this producer,> This other who gives suffering to another,> Yet who is not that very suffering? [XII.6] If the suffering of the future god is held to be produced by a different humanperson, we may ask who this producer is. Who, apart from human suffering, isthis other human person who gives suffering to a different divine person? As wecannot observe any human person who is different from human suffering, sufferingis not produced by a different person.Since Suffering Is Not Produced by a Self, It Is Not Produced by Anything OtherNext we will refute the notion that suffering is produced by anything otherbecause it is not self-produced. There are two parts to this, of which the firstis a refutation where self and other are understood in terms of the person. Thetreatise states:> As it cannot be established to be produced by a self,> How could suffering be the product of another?> The suffering produced by the other> Is the product of that other itself. [XII.7] How could suffering possibly be the product of an “other”? Consider the humanbeing that is substantially identical with [human suffering]. How could itpossibly produce the nature of suffering that is associated with someone else,[such as] a god? Indeed, it could not, for since there is no human being thatexists as something other than suffering, we cannot establish human suffering asthe product of the human person itself. The entailment here is as follows: Ifone person produces the suffering associated with another individual, thesuffering associated with the first person would have to be produced by thatperson himself or herself. If instead that suffering further depends on yetanother person, it turns out to be an illusion-like construction. It is taught:> When the seed of something is false,> How could its arising be true?139 Thus, a different person is incapable of producing the nature of suffering. Thesituation is just as described here:> The vase is established by causes,> And those causes are themselves established by other causes.> How could that which does not establish itself> Succeed in establishing something else?140 The second part of the refutation of the notion that suffering is produced byanother because suffering is not self-produced considers self and other in termsof the appropriated. The treatise states:> Suffering is not self-produced;> It is not its own product.> If the other is not the product of itself,> How could suffering be produced by another? [XII.8] The human aggregates of suffering that are [held to be] the producer of asuffering that is different from them are not produced by themselves, for it iscontradictory for something to relate to itself as an object. Given that theythus are not the products of themselves, we may once more ask how sufferingcould be produced by something that is other. Consider that which issubstantially identical with human suffering. How could that possibly producethe nature of another suffering associated with a god? It could not because theformer suffering is not produced by itself. The entailment here can beunderstood from the one given in the previous section.Suffering Is Not Produced by Both Self and OtherHaving thus refuted the notions that suffering is self-produced or produced byanother, it will now be shown how it cannot be produced by both self and other.The treatise states:> If suffering were produced by each of these,> Then suffering would be the product of both. [XII.9a–b] If suffering were produced by self and other individually, that suffering wouldbe produced by both. Yet it has already been shown that neither self nor othercan produce suffering. Therefore, combining these two will not deliver theproducer of suffering either, just as it is impossible to extract sesame oilfrom sand, no matter how much sand you gather.Suffering Is Not UncausedThird, refuting the belief that suffering is uncaused, the treatise states:> Neither produced by self nor other,> How could suffering be uncaused? [XII.9c–d] Suffering is not produced by self, other, or by both of these combined. How,then, could suffering be uncaused, like the sky flower? If something has nocauses, it follows that it cannot appear as an object apprehended by the mind,and it cannot be present only at certain times.If suffering exists by nature, its arising cannot be conceived of in any otherway than these four extremes. Therefore, since it follows that suffering mustarise in one of these ways, and because it has now been shown that it does notarise in any of these four ways, it has been established that suffering has nonature. By extension, we can also conclude that there is no person who functionsas the support for suffering.EXTENDING THE REASONING TO OTHER TOPICS Extending this analysis to other topics, the treatise states:> Not only does suffering> Not exist in any of these four ways,> External entities as well> Do not exist in any of the four ways. [XII.10] The suffering that consists of the internal aggregates imbued with consciousnessdoes not exist in any of these four ways. In the same manner, vases and everyother external entity do not arise in any of the four ways outlined aboveeither. The preceding discussion applies to all things.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE Third, as for the summary, the present chapter has existentially negated themental construction of real arising in relation to all phenomena. Likewise, ithas affirmed that the appearance of dependent arising is relative andillusion-like. As the Master himself taught:> That suffering is created by itself,> By something other, by both, or that it is uncaused—> This is what logicians assert.> You speak of dependent origination.141 Similarly, the King of Meditative Absorptions explains:> In terms of the relative, the Victorious One teaches the Dharma, Speaking of> the conditioned and the unconditioned in dependence.

This concludes the twelfth chapter, the analysis of suffering, in the Ornamentof Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.139. Nāgārjuna, Jewel Garland, I.29.140.

Next it will be shown how dependent origination is empty ofthe nature of mere things, undifferentiated in terms of phenomena and persons.First is the analysis of the conditioned, which refutes the belief that thingshave a nature. The three issues pertain to this analysis as well.142THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 13 First, concerning the context of chapter thirteen, the present analysis relatesto the profound sūtras, such as the following statement from the King ofMeditative Absorptions:> In rocky caves, mountains, ravines, and gorges,> Conditions come together and an echo occurs.> Understand all conditioned things to be like this.> Wandering beings are like an illusion, like a mirage. Similarly:> Monks, the sacred truth is one; it is the subject that does not deceive, the> transcendence of suffering. All conditioned things are deceptive and false> subjects. This chapter employs reasoning to ascertain the meaning of such statements.As for its relation to the other chapters in the text, the analysis of theconditioned is a follow-up to the analysis of suffering, in which it was refutedthat outer and inner phenomena may arise in the manner of one of the fourextremes. Thus, while it was established that all phenomena do not arise inreality, arising and other such things appear to those whose perception isdistorted by ignorance. It is, therefore, established that conditioned thingsare deceptive phenomena. Scripture as well teaches that such phenomena arenecessarily false. The present chapter was written to demonstrate that veryfalsity.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 13 Second, the explanation of the content involves (1) using scripture to establishthat there is no nature and (2) refuting a different exegesis.SCRIPTURE TEACHES THE ABSENCE OF NATURE On the first issue, the treatise states:> The Transcendent Conqueror has taught> That all deceptive phenomena are false.> All conditioned phenomena are deceptive,> And, therefore, they are false. [XIII.1] > If a phenomenon that is deceptive is also false,> Then what is it that deceives?> With this, the Transcendent Conqueror> Has fully revealed emptiness. [XIII.2] In a sūtra, the Transcendent Conqueror states:> Monks, any subject that is deceptive and conditioned is also a false. And elsewhere:> Likewise, here there is no suchness, no unmistaken suchness. Rather, these> subjects are deceptive. Illusory and false, these subjects fool the immature. With these words, he teaches that a deceptive phenomenon is also necessarily afalse phenomenon.When we examine all conditioned outer and inner phenomena with the reasoningspresented above, true arising and true entities will be invalidated. Still, tothose whose vision is distorted by ignorance, these phenomena neverthelessmistakenly appear to be arising and existent things. Hence, it is establishedthat these phenomena are deceptive subjects and that all external and internalconditioned things are, therefore, just as false and essenceless as a person inan illusion.Secondly, the scriptures do not teach nothingness. Someone might object to theabove reading, saying that this is a nihilistic view that denies the existenceof all conditioned things. Yet this is not the case. If any subject that isconditioned and deceptive is also false and devoid of nature, then what could bedeceptive? What could become nothing or annihilated, given that no object ofnegation or annihilation can be observed? Hence, it is explained:> If entity is not established,> Then neither is nonentity.143 And likewise:> As for that which by nature has no arising,> How could it possibly last or end?144 One may then wonder: “Well, if it is not nothingness, what do these passagesteach?”The Transcendent Conqueror states that all conditioned, deceptive phenomena arealso false phenomena. Thereby, he fully reveals that natural emptiness in whichall constructed marks, such as negation and affirmation, are entirely absent. Onthis point, it is taught:> Recognize that all things> Are empty of their very essence.> “Empty” also is empty.> Thus, there is nothing that is not empty. And similarly:> The Dharma has no syllables and yet is taught using syllables. REFUTATION OF A DIFFERENT EXEGESIS Second, it will be shown that impermanence is not the intent of these scripturalstatements.The View of the OppositionPresenting the view of the opposition, the treatise states:> Things are devoid of essence> Because they are perceived to change.> There are no entities without essence> Because entities possess emptiness. [XIII.3] > If there is no essence,> To what does change pertain? [XIII.4a–b] Some members of our own tradition do not understand the intent of theseteachings to be an existential negation of nature. Instead, they perceive apredicative negation of nature. They explain that, while these passages donegate the permanent entities that are imputed by non-Buddhist schools andchildish individuals, they also affirm the presence of mere phenomena that areconditioned and impermanent, in the sense that their substance is momentary andtheir continua come to an end. This affirmation is implied, they argue, becausethe presence of such mere phenomena is supported by reasoning.Contrary to what is imagined by the non-Buddhists, no conditioned outer or innerentity features any essence that is indestructible or that lasts for more than amoment. This is evident, they hold, from the fact that we perceive theseentities undergoing change and coming to an end.Nor is it the case that these things are absolutely devoid of any essence, asthe Followers of the Middle Way claim, because it is accepted that they areentities that are qualified by emptiness. Without any essence, they would be nodifferent than a sky flower. If this were the case, what could change pertainto? It could not be located anywhere. Therefore, they claim, things are notdevoid of essence.Disproving the View of the OppositionDisproving the view of the opposition will include showing that (1) changecannot be used as an argument for the natural existence of mere phenomena and(2) emptiness is not established.Change Cannot Be Used as an Argument for the Natural Existence of Mere PhenomenaThe first section explains that (1) nature and change are contradictory and (2)in reality, change as such has no establishment.Nature and Change Are ContradictoryOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If there were essences,> How could there be change? [XIII.4c–d] If things had a nature or essence, how would they be able to change? Indeed, itfollows that it would not be possible for them to turn into something else. Thisis entailed because when the world speaks of the “nature” of something, thenwhat is meant is something that a given phenomenon unmistakenly has, such as theheat of fire. A given heat or extent of water is essentially produced by causesand conditions; if a fire is “five-tongued,” it is classified as such independence on other phenomena; and if gold is stained, it is gold that hasundergone alteration. Hence, in none of these cases are [we referring to]something that is unmistakably [intrinsic to the thing in question]. Therefore,none of these qualities can be their nature. This, in turn, shows that if thingswere to exist by nature, that would preclude their undergoing change. Therefore,be aware that since things do appear to change, they are as devoid of nature asan illusory person.In Reality, Change as Such Has No EstablishmentOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Change is not in that itself,> Nor is it in something else,> Because the young do not age,> And because the aged do not age. [XIII.5] > If that itself changes,> Then milk itself is yogurt.> What, other than milk,> Would turn into yogurt? [XIII.6] Change is something that, without analysis, is merely apparent to what theopponent accepts as being direct perception. When the reality of the situationis investigated, however, change is seen to be impossible. That is to say, aninitial situation does not itself contain change because change is not possibleunless the initial situation is dispensed with. Neither does something otherthan the original condition contain change. In a situation that is differentfrom the initial one, the change has already taken place. Doing so once morewould, therefore, be meaningless.To give an example, nobody is aged while still being young because these two aremutually incompatible. One may then think that aging occurs once the situationof being young is over. Yet this is not the case either because being aged isprecisely what is the case when youth is over. Hence, the aged person does notage either, for such an aging of the one who has already aged would bemeaningless.Similarly, if the earlier situation were itself what changed, it would mean thatmilk could become yogurt while still remaining milk. On the other hand, if itwere something other than the initial situation that undergoes change, it wouldbe something other than milk, such as water, that turns into yoghurt. This,however, is impossible. Discussing this point, the Noble Sūtra of the Source ofJewels states:> No phenomenon arises or disintegrates;> There is no death, no transference, and no aging.> This is what the Lion of Men has taught,> And in this he has established hundreds of beings. Emptiness Is Not EstablishedSecond, showing that emptiness is not established includes (1) refuting thebelief that emptiness can withstand analysis and (2) showing how this refutationdoes not contradict scripture.Emptiness Cannot Withstand AnalysisOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If there were a bit of something that is not empty,> There could be a bit something that is empty.> As there is not a bit that is not empty,> How could there be anything that is empty? [XIII.7] It is not possible to prove that things truly possess the property of emptinessbecause there is nothing that is not empty. This argument features entailmentbecause, as was explained above, negative properties and objects of negation aremutually dependent. Therefore, let us imagine that there is some object ofnegation—a person or phenomenon—that is not empty of real entity. If this werethe case, a bit of emptiness, the absence of a true entity in the form of aperson or phenomenon, could be present as well.Earlier refutations, however, have shown that there is nothing whatsoever thatwithout being empty exists as a true entity in the form of a person orphenomenon. How, then, could there be an emptiness, an absence of persons andphenomena that are real entities, since such emptiness is a property thatdepends on the former objects of negation? Indeed, this is similar to a man in adream. Since the dream man is not real himself, neither is his death.The Refutation of Emptiness Does Not Contradict ScriptureOn the second issue, the treatise states:> The Victorious Ones have taught emptiness> As a deliverance from all views.> For those whose view is emptiness, they teach,> Nothing can be accomplished. [XIII.8] Some may argue: “Unlike the teachings of the extremists, the Able One’s sūtrasreveal the three gateways to liberation. Your words are a dismissal of histeaching, a distorted view that denigrates that intrinsic nature of emptiness,which is established by both scripture and reasoning.”This is not the case. As stated in the Mother of the Victorious Ones:> The bodhisattva may think, “These aggregates are empty,”> Yet he still engages with marks and has no faith in the abode of the unborn. Hence, the meaning of emptiness as taught in the profound sūtras transcendsempty, not empty, and all other constructs of negandum and negation; it liesbeyond all claims. What you understand is the mere property of the negation ofthe self of the person and phenomena. This is the absence of arising as anegative property, or emptiness as an indicative negation. That I do refute, forit is not the intent of the sūtras.The Victorious Ones have conquered the enemy, the discards, and have vanquishedthose factors that cover and conceal sublime qualities. Having uprooted the twoobscurations, along with the habitual tendencies, they are Buddhas, TranscendentConquerors. What they teach is an emptiness that delivers from all views, allbeliefs in properties such as existence, nonexistence, and so forth. The NobleJewel Mound states:> Kāśyapa, emptiness alone is the deliverance from all views. And in the Mother of the Victorious Ones:> Engagement with the idea that form is empty, or that it is not empty, is still> engagement with marks. It is not engagement with transcendent insight. When> there is no engagement with anything at all, it is the engagement with> transcendent insight. People who lack wisdom develop a view that seizes on the marks associated withthe negative property “emptiness,” or view it as a positive determination. Thus,they cannot free themselves from the fundamental root of all problems, thebeliefs in existence, nonexistence, and other such views. Unable to give upthese views, they fail to accomplish both liberation from cyclic existence, aswell as the nonabiding transcendence of suffering that is confined to neitherexistence nor peace. This is taught in the sūtras, such as the following passagefrom the Noble Jewel Mound:> Kāśyapa, I say that the one who observes emptiness, and thus conceives of> emptiness, has failed, failed entirely, with respect to these teachings.> Having a belief in personal existence that is as solid as the King of> Mountains is a minor problem compared to the arrogant view of emptiness. Why> is that? Because emptiness is a deliverance from all views. Hence, I say that> if the view is exclusively emptiness, then there is no cure. Subsequently, the Buddha gives the example of the man who is unable to digestthe medicine that would otherwise heal him, and therefore does not recover fromhis disease. In the same manner, while holding the view of emptiness one will beunable to sever the root of all problems by eliminating all views. So long asthis is the case, one will be unable to attain mere liberation or accomplish thenonabiding transcendence of suffering because one continues to perceive marks inthe very emptiness that is the remedy against all views.This can also be illustrated as follows. Imagine that someone says, “I have nomerchandise,” and someone else answers, “Well, then give me that merchandisecalled ‘no’!” Here, the second person takes the word that negates the object ofnegation, merchandise, to be an affirmation of merchandise. It is, therefore,impossible to make him understand that there is, in fact, no merchandise. Thisis what the Master has in mind when he states:> To conquer all thoughts,> You taught the elixir of emptiness.> For those who grasp even at that,> You show your contempt.145 This concludes the explanation of the thirteenth chapter, the analysis of theconditioned, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the MiddleWay.142.

Nāgārjuna, Praise to the Supramundane, 23."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF CONTACTTHE THREE ISSUES pertain to the analysis of contact as well.146 First is thechapter’s context.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 14 The present chapter relates to the profound sūtras, such as the followingteachings from the King of Meditative Absorptions:> Based on the eye and form,> Visual consciousness arises.> Yet the eye is not based on the form,> Nor has the eye gone out to the form. > These selfless and repulsive phenomena> Are still spoken of as “self” and “delightful.”> This misconception where there is nothing,> Is that from which visual consciousness occurs. Thus, the sūtras teach that the contact between factors like a faculty, object,and consciousness is devoid of nature. It is the meaning of such teachings thatthe present chapter employs reasoning to ascertain.Concerning its relationship to the other chapters, the analysis of contact formsa reply to the following objection: “The analysis of the conditioned contained arefutation of the nature of things, but things do indeed exist by nature. In thesūtras, we find statements such as:> The visual consciousness arises based on the eye and form. And:> Contact comes about due to the coming together of three factors. Contact is> accompanied by sensation. As well as:> The two phenomena, sensation and identification, involve contact. It is not> the case that there is no contact. Thus, it is taught that conditioned phenomena are in contact.There cannot be any contact between things that are nonexistent, just as thesons and daughters of barren women cannot meet.” The present chapterdemonstrates that the meaning of such scriptural statements is expedient andthat there is no nature of contact.EXPLANATION OF THE CONTENT Second, the explanation of the content of this chapter includes (1) apresentation of the thesis that there is no contact between conditionedphenomena, (2) an explanation of the rationale for this thesis, and (3) aconclusion.THE THESIS OF NO CONTACT On the first issue, the treatise states:> The seen, sight, and the seer> Do not, either in pairs> Or as a group,> Ever come into contact. [XIV.1] > The same goes for desire, the desirous one,> And the object of desire, the other afflictions,> The remaining sense sources,> And for all such triads. [XIV.2] The seen form, the eye that is the faculty of sight, and the visualconsciousness that sees do not meet in pairs. That is to say, there is nocontact between eye and form, eye and consciousness, or consciousness and form.Yet neither do all three of them contact each other simultaneously. The samegoes for desire, the desirous primary consciousness that is the support fordesire, and the attractive object of desire. They do not meet in pairs, or alltogether at once. The same also holds for the other afflictions—anger andstupor—as well as the ear and the rest of the six sense sources. None of thefactors in these triads that we may thus distinguish, such as anger, the angryconsciousness, and the object of anger, or the heard, hearing, and hearer, evercome into contact, neither in pairs nor in groups of three.THE RATIONALE The second issue will be covered by showing (1) the absence of contact due tolack of difference and (2) the infeasibility of contact whether things are thesame or distinct.The Absence of Contact Due to a Lack of DifferenceThe first of these includes (1) a presentation of the evidence by demonstratinga reverse entailment, (2) the application of the evidence to all phenomena, and(3) the establishment of the evidence.Presentation of the EvidenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Contact occurs between different things,> So because the seen and so forth> Do not exist as different things,> They do not come into contact. [XIV.3] If different things were to come into contact with each other, their contactwould entail their being of different substance. In the case of things such asthe seen object, sight, and the seer, there are, however, no such substantialdifferences present that would otherwise have been entailed by their contact,and so the entailing contact can be precluded.Application of the Evidence to All PhenomenaOn the second issue, the treatise states:> It is not only the seen and the rest> That do not differ from each other;> Wherever there is coexistence> There cannot reasonably be difference. [XIV.4] Lack of difference does not preclude contact only in cases where things arecausally related or mutually dependent, as is the case with seen objects andsight. Upon investigation, it becomes clear that wherever there iscoexistence—as there may be, for example, with a vase and a blanket—there cannotreasonably be any substantial difference. Hence, things that coexist can nevercontact one another.Establishment of the EvidenceThe third issue includes (1) explaining that things that are mutually dependentcannot reasonably be different, (2) showing that the universal “difference” hasno establishment, and (3) drawing the conclusion.Things That Are Mutually Dependent Cannot Reasonably Be DifferentOn the first issue, the treatise states:> That which is different differs in dependence on something else.> It does not differ without that different thing from which it differs.> Where something depends on something else,> The two cannot reasonably be different. [XIV.5] > If the different differed from something different,> It would be different even without anything different.> But nothing differs without something different,> And, hence, this is not the case. [XIV.6] In the world, vases and other such things are labeled “different” in dependenceon something else, such as a blanket, from which it differs. Without a referentfrom which it differs, there is no basis for applying the term “different” to avase. This is how things are perceived and accepted in the world.Therefore, a vase that is held to be different in relation to a blanket cannotreasonably be different from the blanket because it is dependent on it. That isthe implicit argument here. The entailment of this argument can be stated asfollows: When something is different in dependence on something else, then theformer cannot in reality, or by nature, be different from the latter. As is thecase with seeds and sprouts, and long and short, the position that these two aredifferent is untenable.It may be thought: “The difference of the vase is not independent of theblanket. But what is the problem with saying that the vase really, or by nature,differs from the blanket while depending on it?”If the vase and the blanket were established as different by nature, theirmutual dependence would be meaningless. Take the subject, the vase that isdifferent. Because the vase is different by its own nature, it would follow thatit is different also in the absence of anything different from it, such as theblanket. Just as the vase can be present in the absence of the blanket becauseits essence does not depend on the it, [the vase would, if it were different byits own nature, be different even in the absence of anything else].That cannot be accepted, however, because from a worldly point of view, we cansee that unless there is something from which it differs, such as the blanket,the vase cannot exist as, or be established as, different. Hence, there is nosuch thing as natural difference.The Universal “Difference” Has No EstablishmentOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Difference does not exist in the different,> Nor does it exist in what is not different. [XIV.7a–b] It may be argued: “For other groups, the convention ‘different’ is not appliedin dependence on other things. Rather, it is applied in relation to theuniversal ‘difference.’”This account might work if there were such a thing as the universal“difference,” but no such universal is established. The universal cannot applyto instances that are already established as different because the universal“difference” is conceived of to provide establishment for the convention ofdifference. Hence, it would be meaningless for the universal difference to applyto such instances. On the other hand, it cannot be present anywhere other thanin those instances either because the universal “sameness,” with which it isincompatible, would be present in such other places. Finally, being and notbeing an instance of difference are directly contradictory qualities. Therefore,there cannot be any third category of things apart from these two. Hence, as itcannot be found anywhere else either, the universal quality of difference is animpossibility.Drawing the ConclusionOn the third issue, the treatise states:> As difference as such does not exist,> Nothing is different and nothing is the same. [XIV.7c–d] It has been shown that the universal quality of difference, the reason forclassifying things as instances of difference, does not exist. Hence, there areno instances of difference, and no instances of sameness either.Whether They Are Different or the Same, Things Cannot Be in ContactHaving thus refuted contact with reference to the lack of difference, next asecond refutation is presented that refutes contact between things that may bedifferent or the same. The treatise states:> Nothing comes into contact with itself,> Nor do different things come into contact. [XIV.8a–b] If contact between phenomena is something that exists by it is own nature, wemay ask whether such contact occurs between things that are essentially the sameor things that are different? In the first case, there cannot be any contact forthere would not be two things that could contact one another. Nor is contactpossible in the second case because, as was already explained, things that aredifferent cannot exist at the same place and time.CONCLUSION TO THE CHAPTER Third, in conclusion, the treatise states:> Contacting, contacted, and contactor> Do not exist either. [XIV.8c–d] Given the above, there is no act of contacting currently being carried out, noact of contact that is already finished, and there is no contactor, no agent whois in charge of such an activity.This concludes the explanation of the fourteenth chapter, the analysis ofcontact, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.146. In this chapter the concluding summary is not explicit as a separatesection of the text."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF NATURETHE THREE ISSUES pertain to the analysis of nature as well.147THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 15 First, concerning its context, the present chapter relates to the profoundsūtras, including the following passage from the Journey to Laṅkā:> Those who suffer from distorted vision> May erroneously perceive hairs.> Similarly, this thought of a thing> Is an erroneous imputation of the childish.> There is no nature, no awareness,> No all-ground, and no nonthing.> These are the imputations> Of childish, unwholesome, corpselike logicians. The present chapter employs reasoning to ascertain the meaning of teachings suchas the one found here, as well as the fourfold summary of emptiness—theemptiness of entity, emptiness of nonentity, emptiness of nature, and emptinessof other-nature—that appears in the Mother of the Victorious Ones.As for its relationship to the other chapters of the text, the analysis ofnature replies to this objection: “The notion that things have an essentialnature has been negated. Likewise, the idea that contact can be used as proofthat there are essential natures has also been refuted. Still, outer entitiessuch as sprouts and inner entities such as karmic formations do indeed exist bynature because they arise in dependence on causes and conditions, such as seeds,ignorance, and so forth.”The present chapter will argue that while the evidence advanced in thatobjection is not established in reality, the very fact that conventionallythings arise in dependence on causes and conditions itself shows that theyresemble an illusion and have no nature.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 15 Second, the explanation of the content of this chapter covers (1) a refutationof the mental constructs of the four extremes, (2) a concluding rebuke of views,and (3) instructions on applying one’s mind to the Middle Way.THE FOUR EXTREMES The first includes refutations of (1) nature and other-nature148 and (2) entityand nonentity.The first of these issues will be treated sequentially, beginning with therefutation of nature. This refutation involves negating the notions that nature(1) originates dependently and (2) undergoes change.Does Nature Originate Dependently?The first of these issues will take the form of a demonstration of theentailment found in the argument: “outer and inner things have no nature becausethey originate dependently, just like an illusion.” This will be done in twosections. First, we will show that it is pointless for nature to arise due tocauses and conditions.It Is Pointless for Nature to Arise Due to Causes and ConditionsThe treatise states:> Nature cannot reasonably occur> Due to causes and conditions. [XV.1a–b] According to the Proponents of Differences, a nature that exists in the futurecomes about in the present based on causes and conditions. Yet a nature thatexists in the future cannot reasonably arise due to causes and conditionsbecause such a nature would already exist, just like things that exist in thepresent.Nature and Dependent Origination Are IncompatibleSecond, it will be shown that nature and arising due to causes and conditionsare incompatible. It may be thought that no fault is incurred by the Followersof Sūtra and Mind Only Proponents who assert that nature does not exist beforeit arises due to causes and conditions. The refutation of this idea involves (1)stating an absurd consequence, (2) showing why the consequence cannot beaccepted, and (3) presenting our own approach in terms of the conventional.An Absurd ConsequenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> A nature that arises due to causes and conditions> Would be a nature that is produced. [XV.1c–d] It follows from the opponent’s idea that nature is a product because it isproduced by causes and conditions, just as a vase is.Why This Consequence Cannot Be AcceptedOn the second issue, the treatise states:> “A nature that is produced,”> How could that be right? [XV.2a–b] If one believes this to be the case, we may ask the following: How could thisso-called produced nature be possible? In the world, people speak of a thing’s“nature” with reference to something that is essential to the thing in question,as when heat is considered to be the nature of fire. This nature or essencecannot be removed and, by being intrinsic, ensures that the entity thatpossesses it is not mistaken for anything else.Thus, nature must be something such as the heat of fire or the fluidity ofwater, something that does not arise due to contact with other causes andconditions, and which is, thus, not fabricated. For example, if water is hot, orearth is moist, then that is the result of its contact with other causes andconditions. Such qualities can be removed, they are not intrinsic, and willhence not ensure that the entity in question is not mistaken for something else.Such qualities cannot, hence, be natural for the given thing.Now, as this is the case, heat cannot be the nature of fire either because justlike the heat of water it is the product of causes and conditions. Thisargument, moreover, does not lack establishment because fire is produced bytinder and other such factors, and there is no fire that is essentiallydifferent from heat.It may be argued: “While fire and heat are produced by causes and conditions,the heat of fire is not, as is the case with the heat of water, the result ofcauses and conditions other than itself.”Yet this idea is untenable because it is precisely such things as tinder thatproduce the heat of fire. The fact that it is accepted in the world that heat isthe nature of fire does not show any flaw in our argument because we do not denythat this is what the world accepts. Rather, we state that this cannotreasonably be the nature of fire in reality, and the world is no authority whenit comes to the issue of reality.Conventional Presentation of Our Own ApproachOn the third issue, the treatise states:> The natural is not fabricated,> And does not depend on anything else. [XV.2c–d] Some may wonder: “Heat appears to be the nature of fire, but the apparent natureof things is not their real nature. Like reflections and other such phenomena,that which appears to be natural from the perspective of a deluded mind isessentially false. What, then, might the real nature of things be?”A sūtra declares:> What can be heard and taught> About phenomena that are letterless?> Aside from superimposition, there are no letters.> That, however, is still heard and taught. Thus, since the real nature of phenomena is not established as an object ofspeech and mind, it cannot be shown in terms of any essence of its own. Yetthose who are to be influenced can still realize the unmistaken nature ofthings, within which none of the constructed marks remain in any way at all. Tofacilitate this realization, there is a teaching that uses conventionalsuperimposition to explain the characteristics of the true nature of phenomena,the object of undefiled wakefulness. The true nature of things possesses threequalities: a) It is not produced by causes and conditions, b) it is independentof any other phenomena in the form of conventional designators, and c) it doesnot change into anything else. Throughout the three times, this is theunmistakable innate essence.Concerning the bearer of these characteristics, it is taught:> Whether or not the Thus-Gone Ones appear, this intrinsic nature of phenomena> thoroughly remains. Thus, the bearer of the characteristic of the true nature is phenomena’s naturalemptiness, which is not established in the manner of any of the marks of mentalconstruction, such as negation and affirmation, and which is the object of thenoble ones’ nonconceptual wakefulness during equipoise. It is taught:> Phenomena’s nature is not produced and not created. Thus, it is not created by> the listeners. In other words, all phenomena are primordially emptiness. It is not that theyare made emptiness by something else. Thus:> Recognize that all things> Are empty of their very essence.> “Empty” also is empty.> Thus, there is nothing that is not empty. Hence, each and every phenomenon is even empty of its own nature. If phenomenacould be said to be empty of p, but not of q, their emptiness would be dependenton extrinsic designators. Yet emptiness cannot be qualified in this way.Emptiness, moreover, does not turn into anything else, neither in a next momentnor at the end of a continuum. [The emptiness that is the real nature of things]thus possesses the three characteristics that were outlined above. It is inconsideration of this that the Mother of the Victorious Ones teaches:> Form is empty of form. Why? Because that is its nature. While the Master himself explains:> Just as heat is the nature of fire> And sweetness the nature of molasses> Emptiness is held to be> The nature of all phenomena. This explanation does not conflict with the earlier statement that phenomena areempty of their own nature. In reality, all phenomena are without any establishednature whatsoever. When it is said that “their nature is emptiness,” it simplydemonstrates this using a superimposition. It is not meant as a claim that thereare cognizable qualities such as existence or nonexistence.Can the Natural Change?The refutation of a nature that changes involves (1) presenting an absurdconsequence, (2) demonstrating its entailment, and (3) showing that therefutation of nature is indisputable.An Absurd ConsequenceOn the first issue, the treatise states the following some verses below:> If something is existent by nature,> It would never become nonexistent. [XV.8a–b] If things such as the heat of fire existed by nature, they would never becomenonexistent.The Entailment of the ConsequenceOn the second issue, the treatise states:> A nature that undergoes change> Would never make any sense. [XV.8c–d] It cannot be argued that the stated consequence lacks entailment. Just as in thecase of the nonresistance of space, a nature that changes would never make anysense. As explained above, the nature of a given entity cannot be removed and,by being intrinsic, ensures that the entity in question is not mistaken foranything else. Hence, if a quality undergoes change, as is the case with theheat of water or the five-tongued design of a fire, then it cannot constitutethe nature of the entity in question.Yet it cannot be asserted [that things do not change] because, from theunexamined perspective of the inference and direct perception that is acceptedby the opponent, it is observed that continua come to an end and that substanceschange from one moment to the next. It must, hence, be understood that thingsare subject to change, like illusory people, and that, therefore, they do nothave any nature.The Refutation of Nature Is IndisputableOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If no nature exists,> To what does change pertain?> Even if nature exists,> To what could change pertain? [XV.9] It may be argued: “If things did not have any nature, they would be like skyflowers. If this were the case, to what would change pertain? It follows thatthere would be nothing that changes. Hence, because there is change, natureexists.”Since change has already been refuted, it is not something that is establishedby nature. Absence of nature, moreover, does not exclude the appearance ofchange, as in the case of illusory people. Let us nevertheless assume that thisis not so and that instead, as the opponent wants it, things exist by nature. Towhat, we may ask, could change then pertain? Indeed, as in the case of thenonresistant quality of space, change would not be feasible. Whatever appears tochange is devoid of nature, and the appearance of change, hence, cannot serve asevidence when arguing that nature exists.Other-NatureSecond, refuting other-nature, the treatise states:> If nature does not exist,> How could there be other-nature?> It is the nature of other-nature> That is identified as “other-nature.” [XV.3] It may be thought: “Since things do not possess any nature, what they do possessis other-nature.”The notion that all outer and inner entities possess nature has already beenrefuted. Hence, how could they possibly have an other-nature? The entailment ofthis argument is as follows. A nature such as heat may be considered another-nature in relation to another nature, such as fluidity. In this way,“other-nature” is identified as a particular type of nature that isdistinguished from another type of nature. Hence, other-nature entails nature.Entity and NonentitySecond, the refutation of entity and nonentity involves (1) a refutation usingreasoning and (2) a refutation based on scripture. First, entity will be refutedbased on reasoning.Refutation by Means of ReasoningThe treatise states:> Apart from nature and other-nature,> What entity could there possibly be?> If there were nature and other-nature,> Entities would be established. [XV.4] It may be thought: “Nature and other-nature may have been refuted, yet mereentities have not. Therefore, they exist.”Since nature and other-nature entail [the presence of an entity], if theyexisted, the entailed entity as such would also be established. The notion thatphenomena have a nature or other-nature, however, has already been refuted.Given that both of these are not established, it follows that mere entities areas nonexistent as the sky flower. This is the argument that the present stanzaimplies.Its entailment is made explicit in the verses, “Apart from nature andother-nature, what entity could there possibly be?” This question points to thefact that, with respect to the basis, an entity, nature and other-nature aredirectly contradictory notions.Second, refuting nonentity, the treatise states:> If entity is not established,> Then neither is nonentity.> It is the transformation of entity> That people call nonentity. [XV.5] It may be thought: “Indeed, entities do not exist. Yet nonentities do, for theyhave not been refuted.”It was shown above that, having been refuted with respect to all outer and innerphenomena, entities are not established. As this is the case, it follows thatnonentities are not established either. It cannot be maintained that thisargument lacks entailment because in the world it is with reference to thetransformation of an entity, meaning the disintegration or negation of thatentity, that people speak of “nonentity.” In other words, negation depends onthere being an object of negation.Refutation by Means of ScriptureSecond is a refutation by means of a scriptural statement of definitive meaning.The treatise states:> The Transcendent Conqueror,> With knowledge of both entities and nonentities,> Refuted, in his Instructions to Kātāyana,> Both existence and nonexistence. [XV.7] As we have seen, the views of nature and other-nature, and of entity andnonentity, are in conflict with reason. Such views, therefore, do not genuinelyapply to reality. The Transcendent Conqueror, as a trustworthy and authoritativeindividual who knows the nature of entities and nonentities precisely andwithout error, has also refuted the views of both existence and nonexistence forthe sake of his disciples who desire liberation. In his Instructions toKātāyana, a scripture that is accepted by all Buddhist schools, he states thefollowing:> Kātāyana, in this world, beings are, for the most part, attached to existence> and nonexistence. Therefore, they are born, grow old, fall sick, and die; they> are tormented, cry out in lamentation, and suffer; they are distressed,> disturbed, and do not achieve complete liberation. A CONCLUDING REBUKE OF VIEWS Having thus refuted the mental constructs of the four extremes, what follows isa rebuke of the views associated with these four. The treatise states:> Those who believe in nature or other-nature,> In entity or nonentity,> Fail to see reality> Within the teachings of the Buddha. [XV.6] Reasoning and scripture have established that, in reality, phenomena are devoidof nature, other-nature, entity, and nonentity. Yet for the realists in our owntradition, the mind’s eye is impaired by the distortions of ignorance. Thiscauses them to mistakenly believe that nature pertains to form that is fit to beform, feeling in the sense of sensation, consciousness that is the cognition ofindividual objects, and so on. They then subscribe to other-nature by holdingthat, “form, mind, and mental states are different.” Some hold that presentform, mind, and mental states are all entities, whereas others claim that thisis only the case with respect to the latter two categories. Some assert theinsubstantiality of the past and the future, imperceptible forms, andnonassociated formations. Others maintain that the apprehended and that whichapprehends are both nonentities. Holding such views, they fail to accurately andunerringly see the previously explained reality of dependent origination withinthe teaching of the Buddha.INSTRUCTIONS ON APPLYING THE MIND TO THE MIDDLE WAY Third, as instructions for giving up extreme views and applying one’s mind tothe Middle Way, the treatise states:> “Existence” is apprehension of permanence,> “Nonexistence” a view of annihilation.> The wise, therefore, ought not to adhere> To either existence or nonexistence. [XV.10] > That which exists by nature> Is not nonexistent—this is permanence.> “It existed before, but now it does not”—> That implies annihilation. [XV.11] The wise ought not adhere to the views of existence and nonexistence that areheld by the members of our own tradition, the reason being that neitherexistence nor nonexistence has any bearing on the nature of objects ofcognition. Believing in “existence” is an apprehension of permanence, whereasapprehending “nonexistence” is a view of annihilation. Both of these views goagainst the teachings of the Able One; they are the cause of cyclic existenceand the lower realms. For this reason, they are extremely unreasonable.To explain further, mere existence does not entail permanence, but you [Buddhistrealists] claim that certain outer and inner things exist by nature. Such thingscould not ever become nonexistent and would have to be permanent. Likewise, merenonexistence does not entail annihilation, but you say that suffering and itscauses exist naturally before, meaning at the time of cyclic existence, and thenlater, upon the transcendence of suffering, they become nonexistent. Thatimplies annihilation. A sūtra proclaims:> If phenomena had any nature,> Then the Victors and the listeners would know it.> Solid phenomena do not attain the transcendence of suffering.> The wise would never become free of mental construction.149 Likewise:> Transcendent Conqueror, the one who teaches that desire, anger, and stupor are> initially fully present and then later become nonentities is indeed a> nihilist.150 Those who wish for true liberation must, therefore, realize that so long as theviews of existence and nonexistence go on manifesting, cyclic existence willcontinue. With this realization, they should dispel those two views and traingenuinely upon the path of the Middle Way.This concludes the explanation of the fifteenth chapter, the analysis of nature,in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.147. In this chapter the concluding summary is not explicit as a separatesection of the text.148. According to Abhidharma thought, things that can be analyzed intoconstituent parts do not possess a nature of their own. Rather, since theirbeing is due to the nature of their constituents, the constructed nature of suchcomposites is termed “other-nature” (Skt. parabhāva, Tib. gzhan gyi dngos po).149. From the Sūtra of the Elephant’s Strength.150. From the Journey to Laṅkā."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF BONDAGE AND LIBERATIONTHE THREE ISSUES pertain to the analysis of bondage and liberation as well.151THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 16 First, regarding its context, the present chapter’s relationship to the profoundsūtras can be seen in the following statement from the Mother of the VictoriousOnes:> Cyclic existence is like a dream and an illusion, passing beyond suffering is> like a dream and an illusion. The King of Meditative Absorptions likewise explains:> The nonexistence of the transcendence of suffering> Is what the Protector of the World has taught as the transcendence of> suffering.> Knots tied on space> Are untied by space itself. Thus, the sūtras teach the natural emptiness of existence and peace. It is themeaning of this teaching that is here established by means of reasoning.As for its relationship to the other chapters in the text, the presentdiscussion presents a reply to the following objection: “The nature of thingshas been refuted, but things do indeed exist because cyclic existence exists.Something that does not exist cannot be cyclic existence, just like the son of abarren woman.”In response to such an objection, the present chapter shows that cyclicexistence is itself devoid of nature.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 16 Second, the explanation of this chapter’s content includes: (1) a refutation ofthe nature of cyclic existence and transcendence, (2) a refutation of bondageand liberation, and (3) a rebuttal of the criticism that such refutations renderaspiring to the fruition and applying oneself to the causal path meaningless.The first issue has two subdivisions, of which the first is the refutation ofcyclic existence. This topic contains, in turn, a refutation of the cycling of(1) appropriated aggregates and (2) an appropriating person.The Cycling of the AggregatesThe treatise states:> If it is claimed that formations cycle,> They cannot do so if permanent,> Nor can they if impermanent. [XVI.1a–c] If cyclic existence is held to exist by nature, we may ask whether it is theappropriated aggregates or the appropriating person that cycles. To such aquestion the members of our own tradition may reply that what cycles are theappropriated formations of the aggregates. In that case, we may further enquirewhether these aggregates are permanent, in the sense of remaining from oneinstant to another, or whether they are impermanent and disintegrate moment bymoment.If permanent, they could not cycle because that which is permanent andunchanging cannot participate in the act of cycling, which involves a temporaltransition. Moreover, one cannot object that, while the stages in this processmay differ, their nature remains permanent because no nature can be observedthat is essentially distinct from these various stages. In addition, if they areessentially inseparable, the nature would be impermanent and composite, just asthe stages are.In the case of the second option, impermanence in the sense of momentarydisintegration, there could be no cycling either. In such a scenario, everythingwould disintegrate for there would not be anything that could remain from onestage into another. Neither can it be maintained that while the impermanentsubstances that are the formations do not themselves cycle, the unbrokencontinuum of sequential instants of causality does. First, there can be nocycling even if one asserts a continuum. Second, continua themselves are notestablished.Let us consider the first of these two points. The instants in which a causeceases and an effect arises do, as was already explained, cease without therebeing any coming and going. Hence, they cannot accommodate any cycling.Moreover, no continuum can be observed that is essentially different than thecausal and resultant instants. Thus, given their essential inseparability, acontinuum cannot involve any coming or going, in exactly the same way that thisis not possible with substances.A continuum, furthermore, is composed of the three times, but since past andfuture formations have, respectively, ceased and not yet arisen, they cannot beinvolved in any cycling. Since the present instant remains in between past andfuture instants, it must have parts that are related to the past and future.Thus, since those parts then end up being past and future, we are unable to findany moment that is present upon examination. Hence, no cycling is possible in apresent instant either.It may be thought that the very arising of a subsequent instant of formationitself implies the cycling of a previous formation. Now, that could be the caseif the previous and subsequent instants of formation were the same. Yet thesetwo are not the same because (1) they are cause and effect, (2) they are relatedto multiple moments of time, and (3) their qualities are incompatible, in thesense that, respectively, they have and have not disintegrated and have and havenot arisen. Therefore, just as the cycling of an ordinary person cannot preventa noble individual from transcending suffering, how could the arising of oneinstant of formation imply the cycling of another distinct instant of formation?Second, upon examination, continua themselves are not established and,therefore, cannot reasonably cycle. There are no established continua because nosubsequent resultant instant can arise from a previous causal instant that hasalready ceased, one that has not yet ceased, or one that is in the process ofceasing. In the first case, the arising of the subsequent instant of formationhas already occurred. In the second case, it has not yet occurred. Finally,there is nothing that is “in the process of ceasing” that is different from bothhaving and not having ceased.The Cycling of the PersonSecond, the refutation of the cycling of an appropriating person involvesrefuting (1) the cycling of a person that is independent of the aggregates andsubstantially existent and (2) the cycling of a person who is dependent on theaggregates and whose existence is an imputation.The Cycling of an Independent and Substantial PersonOn the first issue, the treatise states:> In the case of sentient beings, the steps are the same. [XVI.1d] Members of other traditions hold that what cycles is a self, or a sentientbeing, which is independent of the aggregates and substantially existent. Thesteps that show such a position to be untenable are the very same as those thatpointed out the flaws in the belief that permanent or impermanent formationscycle. Hence, there cannot be any cyclic existence for this kind of sentientbeing either.The Cycling of a Dependent and Imputed PersonThe second issue involves showing that cyclic existence is untenable since (1)the one that cycles is itself not established and (2) there is no appropriation.The Establishment of the One That CyclesOn the first issue, the treatise states:> It might be said that the person cycles,> But when we search the aggregates, elements, and sense sources,> Using the five steps and there is nothing,> What is it, then, that cycles? [XVI.2] Certain members of our own tradition may say: “The above critique applies onlyif the nature of the person can be stated. Yet the one that cycles is ineffable.Such a person cannot be said to be one with or separate from the aggregates, orpermanent or impermanent. Thus, the inconsistencies stated above are notrelevant.”Yet when we search for the person among the aggregates, elements, and sensesources that form the basis for imputation in five steps, we will come up withnothing. These five steps involve inquiring whether this self is 1) identicalwith these factors, 2) distinct from them, 3) in possession of them, 4) thesupport for them, or 5) supported by them. As we will find no person, who is it,then, that cycles? When the one that is supposed to cycle is as nonexistent asthe child of a barren woman, there can be no cyclic existence at all.AppropriationOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If there is cycling from appropriation to appropriation,> Then there cannot be any becoming.> Without becoming there can be no appropriation,> So what kind of cycling is this? [XVI.3] Even if we assume the existence of the self, we may still ask, for example,whether the cycling from human appropriation to the appropriation of a godoccurs with or without the former appropriation having been relinquished. If theprior appropriation has not been relinquished, the appropriation of a god wouldthen take place while human appropriation is still occurring. This would meanthat there could be two appropriations for a single person at a single point intime. Since there would be two appropriations, there would also have to be twoimputed selves, one for each appropriation. Hence, the problems that result fromthis position are that cyclic existence would end up having a beginning andbeing uncaused.In the second scenario, the relinquishment of human appropriation would takeplace prior to the appropriation of the god. If this were the case, there couldnot be any aggregates of becoming in the gap between the human and the divinestates. Given the absence of both becoming and the appropriated aggregates,there would then be no basis for the imputation of the self. What kind of selfcould there then be? As there would not be any self that cycles, what would bedoing the cycling? Alternatively, since the self would not exist, what act ofcycling would it engage in? Indeed, there could be no such activity. Theexpression “what kind of cycling” can thus be seen to criticize the notions ofboth the self that cycles and the activity of cycling.One may then object: “In the gap between a human and divine existence, there isan appropriation associated with the intermediate state. Hence, these problemsare not relevant.”Yet this idea is also untenable for the same problem will be found once we askwhether or not the appropriation of the intermediate state occurs after theappropriation of the human state has ended.The Transcendence of SufferingOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Formations that transcend suffering> Do not make sense in any way.> Sentient beings that transcend suffering> Do not make sense in any way either. [XVI.4] Some may think: “While cyclic existence may have been refuted in this way, thetranscendence of suffering exists because it has not been explicitly refuted andbecause scripture speaks of it.”Whether we associate it with the appropriations or that which appropriates, thetranscendence of suffering is also an untenable principle. If there is such athing as the transcendence of suffering, does it then pertain to theappropriated aggregates or to the appropriating self?In the first case, the transcendence of suffering would not make any sense,regardless of whether we associate it with something permanent or something thatis impermanent. The permanent does not change and could not, therefore, berelated to any process of eliminating flaws or acquiring positive qualities. Theimpermanent, on the other hand, ceases from one moment to the next. Therefore,it too is incapable of participating in any such activities.The transcendence of suffering does not make any sense in relation to sentientbeings either, regardless of whether they are held to be permanent orimpermanent. Finally, an ineffable person could not achieve any transcendence ofsuffering. To begin with, the existence of such a person is itself untenable.Moreover, if it continued to exist once suffering has been transcended, it wouldbe permanent, while if it did not, it would be impermanent. This idea,therefore, has the same flaws that were stated above. For this reason, theMother of the Victorious Ones teaches:> Venerable Subhūti, the transcendence of suffering is also like a dream and an> illusion. While the King of Meditative Absorptions proclaims:> An ultimate truth that is like a dream,> The transcendence of suffering with its dreamlike nature—> The wise one who engages them as such> Is taught to possess the supreme mental vow. BONDAGE AND LIBERATION Second, bondage and liberation are refuted (1) in general and (2) individually.General RefutationOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Formations that are subject to arising and ceasing> Are not bound and will not be freed.> As before, sentient beings as well> Are not bound and will not be freed. [XVI.5] One may object: “Cyclic existence and the transcendence of suffering may havebeen refuted, yet being bound by the chains of affliction and being liberationfrom them does indeed occur. Hence, the nature of things exists.”Nevertheless, we can analyze bondage and liberation in the same manner as beforewith respect to the appropriated and that which appropriates. Neither of theseoptions makes sense. The appropriated formations cannot be bound by action andaffliction, and they cannot be freed from them either because these formationsare subject to arising and ceasing from one moment to the next. The entailmenthere is as follows: Simultaneous factors cannot relate to each other as objectand agent. Hence, formations cannot be bound or released when they arise, whilein the second moment, they cannot be bound or freed either since they willalready have ceased.As was the case before with the formations, the appropriating self, or sentientbeing, cannot be bound or freed either. If such a self were impermanent, thesame flaws as before would apply, and if the self were permanent, it would notmake sense for it to be involved in the activity of being bound or freed.Individual RefutationsThe second issue is twofold. First, the refutation of bondage involves showingthat (1) bondage cannot occur whether appropriation is present or absent, (2)there is no bondage prior to that which is bound, and (3) the activity ofbinding is refuted through an examination of the three times.Bondage Cannot Occur Whether Appropriation Is Present or AbsentOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If bondage is due to appropriation,> Since nothing is bound in the presence of appropriation,> And there is no bondage in the absence of appropriation,> When, then, is it that bondage occurs? [XVI.6] Let us assume that appropriations, such as desire, bind either the appropriatedformations or the appropriating person. Would something then be bound in thepresence of appropriation, or rather in its absence? Something for which thereis already appropriation cannot be bound because such binding would bemeaningless. Neither can something for which appropriation is absent be boundsince bondage and the absence of appropriation are mutually incompatible. TheThus-Gone, for example, cannot be bound. When, then, could there be any bondage?Since the presence and absence of appropriation are mutually contradictory, nothird option is open.There Is No Bondage Prior to That Which Is BoundOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If the bond existed prior to the bound,> There could be bondage, yet it does not. [XVI.7a–b] Furthermore, if there are iron chains to begin with, they can be used to bindDevadatta. Similarly, bondage could occur if desire and other such bonds werepresent prior to that which is bound, whether it be the formations or a person.Yet these bonds do not exist prior to what they bind because in the absence ofsomething bound, there is no basis for them. Moreover, if bondage were alreadyestablished before that which is bound, its subsequent relation to the boundwould serve no purpose.The Act of Binding in Terms of the Three TimesOn the third issue, the treatise states:> The rest has already been explained> By what was, will be, and is being traversed. [XVI.7c–d] It should be understood that the remaining elements in the critique of bondagehave already been addressed in the refutation of the act of going with referenceto what was, will be, and is currently being traversed. Thus, with the properchanges, we easily arrive at the statement, “Where there has been bondage, thereis none.”LiberationSecond, refuting liberation, the treatise states:> That which is bound is not freed,> Yet the unbound is not freed either.> If the bound were being liberated,> Bondage and liberation would be simultaneous. [XVI.8] It may be thought: “Since the sūtras teach the means for liberation, liberationmust exist. Given the existence of liberation, bondage must exist as well.”Once one examines this issue, it will be seen that there is no liberation. Ifliberation takes place, does it occur to that which is bound or to somethingthat is not bound? That which is bound is not freed because the act of bindingis incompatible with that of freeing.One may think: “It is precisely that which is bound that is subsequentlyliberated through skillful means.”Yet, while it is contradictory to claim that liberation occurs in a situationwhere there is still bondage, it would be meaningless for liberation to occuronce that situation is over. The latter also implies that liberation would stillhave to be achieved even if the state of bondage has ended. Hence, these two aremutually dependent.The unbound is not freed either. Since the unbound has already been freed, itsbeing freed again would be meaningless.Finally, it may be thought that, while the bound is not liberated, it issomething that is in the process of being freed that is liberated. In this case,bondage and liberation would be simultaneous, so this does not make senseeither. Since binding and freeing are incompatible activities, their occurringat the same time is as impossible as having light and darkness at the same placeand time. For this very reason, the Mother of the Victorious Ones proclaims:> Form is not bound and not liberated. REBUTTAL OF CRITICISM The third section contains a rebuttal of the criticism that the refutation ofexistence and eace renders aspiring to the fruition and applying oneself to thecausal path meaningless. The treatise states:> “Without appropriation, I shall transcend suffering;> The transcendence of suffering, that shall be mine!”> Those who grasp in this way> Are engaged in severe appropriation. [XVI.9] > Where the transcendence of suffering is not produced> And cyclic existence is not dispelled,> How to conceive of cyclic existence,> And how of the transcendence of suffering? [XVI.10] The members of the schools of the listeners may object: “Perceiving cyclicexistence as a wasteland plagued by hundreds of sufferings, we yearninglywonder, ‘When will I cross over that which can barely be traversed, and succeedin transcending suffering? When shall the transcendence of suffering be mine?’Hence, with a tremendous aspiration to relinquish existence and cultivatetranscendence, we follow spiritual teachers, practice generosity and discipline,and engage in study, reflection, and meditation, thereby applying ourselves tothe task of relinquishing existence and achieving peace. Yet, if there were nocyclic existence and no transcendence of suffering, this entire pursuit would befutile!”Indeed, this is futile. In reality, there is nothing to relinquish or cultivatewith respect to all phenomena, nor is there anything that can be established as“I” or “mine.” Hence, one might mistakenly think, “Without appropriation, Ishall transcend suffering; the transcendence of suffering, that shall be mine!”Yet this type of grasping is the view of the transitory collection and, hence,severe engagement in appropriation. All the various disputes motivated by such aview will do nothing but prevent the transcendence of suffering that takes placein terms of the relative. On this point, it is taught:> Affliction is explained to be concomitant with grasping. Thus, it is taught that as long as a focal point is maintained, there will beno liberation from relative cyclic existence.One may wonder: “How, then, can I transcend suffering?”In ultimate reality, the basic space of phenomena, there are no new qualitiesassociated with a “transcendence of suffering” to produce, nor are there any oldflaws related to a so-called cyclic existence to be dispelled. Existence andpeace are equality, primordially beyond arising. How, then, could we conceive ofa cyclic existence to be relinquished or a transcendence of suffering to beadopted, given that both the objects of relinquishment and of cultivation lackestablishment? With this insight, one will be liberated from relative cyclicexistence. The Master himself teaches:> Here there is nothing whatsoever to exclude,> And not a bit to maintain.> Look, genuinely into the genuine—> When the genuine is seen, there is total liberation.152 While the Noble Sūtra on the Taming of the Demons explains:> Likewise, those who are liberated are simply those who completely understand> inauthentic identifications. Apart from that, there is no liberation from> anything at all. It is the complete understanding of this that is referred to> as “liberation.” This concludes the explanation of the sixteenth chapter, the analysis of bondageand liberation, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of theMiddle Way.151. In this chapter the concluding summary is not explicit as a separatesection of the text.152. Nāgārjuna, Heart of Dependent Origination, 7."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF ACTION AND ITS RESULTSALSO THE ANALYSIS of action and its results is treated in terms of three issues.First, regarding its context, the present chapter is related to the profoundsūtras that teach that action and its results are devoid of nature. The Sūtra onTransference of Existence, for example, proclaims:> Great king, death and transference are empty of death and transference, birth> is empty of birth, action is empty of action, and the result of action is> empty of the result of action. Here, the meaning of such statements is established by means of reasoning.As for its relationship to the other chapters of the text, the present analysisresponds to the following notion: “Even though cyclic existence may have beenrefuted, it does indeed exist. A sūtra teaches:> I myself will experience> The results of my own actions. Thus, the relationship between action and its consequences is a fact. Let usimagine that there is no cyclic existence, in the sense of either the formationsor the person coming into this life, and from here passing on to a future life.If this were the case, the results of actions committed in the past could not beexperienced in this life, and the results of what was done in this life couldnot be experienced in the future. Moreover, we do not observe the ripening of adelightful or unpleasant result at the time when the virtuous or nonvirtuouskarmic action is carried out.”The present chapter is presented to explain that actions and their results arethemselves devoid of nature.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 17 Explaining the content will address (1) objections to this presentation and (2)replies to these objections.OBJECTIONS The first includes (1) setting forth the nature of action and its result and (2)showing that the presentations are not flawed by permanence and annihilation.The Nature of Action and Its ResultThe first section includes (1) the divisions of action and (2) the effects ofaction.The Divisions of ActionThe first of these issues is again divided in three sections, of which the firstpresents a concise classification.Concise ClassificationThe treatise states:> Restraining oneself properly,> Helping others, and a loving mind—> These are Dharma, seeds that bear fruit> Both here and hereafter. [XVII.1] Actions are classified as either virtuous or nonvirtuous based on whether or nottheir ripening will be pleasant. Virtuous actions can be divided further withreference to the following three mental states: 1) Proper restraint from killingand the other misdeeds of body, speech, and mind with respect to oneself (thatis, the identity that is imputed based on the aggregates); 2) training in thefour means of magnetizing, the means for protecting against fear, and other suchfactors in order to actively help others; and 3) a loving mind that is intent onfreeing others from suffering and wanting them to be happy. These three types ofmind are Dharma, in the sense that they keep and protect one from falling intothe lower realms. As such, they constitute seeds that will bear the fruits ofpleasant karmic ripening in both this life and in lives hereafter.“Seeds” are distinguished from cooperating conditions in that the former arefactors that facilitate a specific effect or serve to produce their effect’sessence. Cooperating conditions, on the other hand, are those factors thatfacilitate a general effect or serve to produce distinct properties.Nonvirtuous actions are the opposite of the above. Hence, a mind that isinclined toward flawed conduct of body, speech, or mind, and a mind that isactively engaged in such conduct, is classified as non-Dharma. These types ofmind result in seeds that will produce unpleasant fruits in both this life andlives hereafter.Expanded ClassificationElaborating on this classification, the treatise states:> The Supreme Sage has taught> That action is volition and the willed.> The subdivisions of these actions> Are set forth in great detail. [XVII.2] > That which is taught as “actions of volition”> Is asserted to be mental,> While the so-called intended actions> Are physical and verbal. [XVII.3] The Buddha is supreme among those noble sages who have realized the ultimate. Hetaught that the aforementioned virtuous and nonvirtuous actions can be furtherdivided into actions that are volition and those that are willed. Thesubdivisions of these two actions have been set forth in great detail. Thosethat are taught to be “actions of volition” are asserted to be mental in thesense that they are completed simply by arising in, or occurring to, the mind.So-called willed actions, on the other hand, are classified as physical andverbal. They occur in body and speech and are completed by being physically orverbally performed subsequent to the mind’s willing. Thus, actions as well areclassified in terms of body, speech, and mind.The Classification Expanded FurtherThird, further expanding this classification, the treatise states:> Speech and movement;> Imperceptible nonabstinence> And imperceptible abstinence—> These are similarly asserted. [XVII.4] > The merit that arises from enjoyment> And the demerit, in a similar manner,> Along with volition—> These seven principles are held to be action. [XVII.5] When the classification is further expanded, we arrive at seven principles.First, there are the two perceptible actions that take the form of virtuous ornonvirtuous verbal actions and movements of the body. Next is the so-calledimperceptible nonabstinence that is associated with not giving up nonvirtuessuch as killing. Whether or not one was born into a community where nonvirtuousactions, such as killing, theft, and robbery, are the norm, nonabstinence willoccur whenever one is capable of performing a negative act and then accepts itas part of one’s general conduct. Once it has arisen, this nonabstinence willcontinuously engender evil, even when one no longer actively pursues theparticular nonvirtuous course of action due to, for example, insanity. A vow, onthe other hand, is the imperceptible abstinence from flawed conduct, such askilling. A vow arises when, in the presence of a preceptor, disciples, and soforth, one completes the perceptible verbal and physical acts that areassociated with pledging to refrain from killing and the like. Once arisen, avow will continue to bring forth virtue, even if there is a lack of the causesfor remaining fully committed to it, as may be the case with insanity, forinstance. As is the case with perceptible actions, imperceptible actions areasserted to be either virtuous or nonvirtuous. These two types of action aretermed “imperceptible” because, although they pertain to the aggregate of formand create a continuous stream of either virtue or nonvirtue, they cannot beperceived by others.When enjoyments are offered to the Sangha, for example, their partaking of theofferings will engender merit in the donor’s stream of being. Alternatively,building a temple where living beings are killed will mean that demerit iscreated in the builder’s stream of being for as long as the devotees thereengage in killing. Thus, there are two further types of action: meritoriousactions that arise from enjoyments and demeritorious actions that arise fromenjoyments. By finally adding the aforementioned action of volition to these sixwilled actions, we arrive at an enumeration of seven principles. These areasserted to be bearers of the characteristics of action.The Effects of ActionSecond, on the effects of action, the treatise states below:> The ten avenues of wholesome action> Are the means for performing Dharma.> Here and hereafter, the fruits of Dharma> Are the five sense pleasures. [XVII.11] The seven types of action mentioned above include the ten avenues of wholesomeaction. These avenues are the means for performing Dharma through the completionof the actions associated with the three virtuous mind-sets that were explainedabove, or with these ten virtues. The fruits of the Dharma that are accomplishedin this way will manifest both in this and other lives as beautiful visual formsand the like, that is, as the five sense pleasures. The effects of non-Dharma,on the other hand, are just the opposite.How This Account Is Not Flawed by Permanence or AnnihilationThe second issue relates to the criticism that actions would end up permanent orannihilated. This section includes (1) stating the criticism and (2) presentingreplies to this criticism.The CriticismOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If an action would remain until ripening,> Then it would be permanent.> If it ceases, then having ceased,> How could it produce an effect? [XVII.6] If these karmic actions remain until the time of their ripening, they would bepermanent. Yet if they do not remain but instead cease, then having ceased, howcould they give rise to effects? The effects of such actions would be asunfeasible as sprouts emerging from burnt seeds. These actions would have ceasedto be.Replies to the CriticismThe second issue includes (1) a reply by appealing to a concordance betweencause and effect, (2) a refutation of that reply, and (3) a reply by assertingthe substance of nondissipation. The first section contains an account of howthe Followers of Sūtra, a school of the listener tradition, show examples todemonstrate the irrelevance of the aforementioned criticism. This will includetheir explanation of (1) how causes produce their effects and (2) how this doesnot imply either permanence or annihilation.The Sūtra Followers’ Account of Karmic CausalityOn the first issue, the treatise states:> The continuum of the sprout and so forth> Manifests from the seed,> Due to which the fruit comes about;> Without the seed, it would not arise. [XVII.7] In the external world, the continuum that consists of sprout, leaf, stem, andother such factors manifests from a seed. It is because of this resultantcontinuum based on the seed that finally a harvest of fruit manifests. Withoutthe prior existence of the seed, the sprout and other aspects of the continuumwould not arise, and there would then not be any harvest of fruit as a resulteither. Thus, this concomitance shows that these things are causally related.How Permanence and Annihilation Are AvoidedOn the second issue, the treatise states:> The continuum arises from the seed,> And from the continuum comes the fruit.> Therefore, the seed precedes the fruit.> Hence, there is no annihilation or permanence. [XVII.8] > That which is the continuum of mind> Manifests from the mind,> And from that emerges the effect.> Without this mind, it would not occur. [XVII.9] > The continuum arises from the mind,> And from the continuum comes the effect.> Therefore, the action precedes the effect> And there is no annihilation or permanence. [XVII.10] If the seed did not cease, there would be the flaw of permanence. On the otherhand, if it were to cease without having caused the production of a continuum,the consequence would be annihilation. Yet the seed precedes the fruit andceases before it. Therefore, there is no permanence. Moreover, as explainedbefore, the seed becomes the cause for the production of the sprout and otheraspects of the continuum before ceasing. The resultant harvest emerges from thatcontinuum. There is, therefore, no annihilation either.The understanding derived from this example can then be applied to show howkarmic actions produce their effect, and how the presence of the effect dependsentirely on the prior presence of an action. The mental continuum that isconjoined with the formation of virtuous or nonvirtuous volitions manifests fromthe initial mind that is conjoined with virtue or nonvirtue. From thatcontinuum, the effects of pleasant or unpleasant ripening emerge. Were it notfor the initial mind conjoined with virtue or nonvirtue, neither the continuumnor the effect would occur.This, then, is how permanence and annihilation are avoided. Permanence would bethe case if the volition that forms the action would not cease, whileannihilation would occur if it were to cease without having caused thecontinuum’s production. Nevertheless, as explained before, the virtuous ornonvirtuous volitions that form actions precede their effects and cease beforethem. Hence, there is no permanence. Moreover, as they cease, the volitionsbecome the causes for the arising of a continuum. Thus, as the initial mindconjoined with virtuous or nonvirtuous volition gives rise to its continuum, andas the pleasant and unpleasant effects emerge from that continuum, there is noannihilation either.How the Proponents of Differences Refute ThisSecond, showing how this account is refuted by the Proponents of Differences,the treatise states:> When it comes to this account,> There are numerous and significant flaws.> Hence, this account> Is untenable here. [XVII.12] The account that was presented above holds that a mind infused with eithervirtue or nonvirtue gives rise to a continuum that is of the same character asitself, which, in turn, subsequently leads to the manifestation of the effect,likening this process to the development of a sprout and so on. This account,however, involves numerous and significant flaws. Consider the virtuous,nonvirtuous, and neutral mind-sets; those associated with the desire realm, theform realm, and the formless realm; with defilement and nondefilement; and withbeing a god and being human. These minds would then all produce exclusively themental continuum of whatever is characteristic of themselves, whether that bevirtue, non-virtue, and so on. If this were the case, a virtuous continuum couldnot, for example, be replaced by a nonvirtuous mind-set. Hence, this accountseriously contradicts what we see to be the case. Accordingly, here in thecontext of karmic causality, it is not reasonable to argue that since theessence of an action has ceased, there is no permanence and that because acontinuum that is of a similar kind has been produced, there is no annihilation.The Account of the Proponents of DifferencesWell, what response is given to the argument that action ends up eitherpermanent or annihilated? The Proponents of Differences respond by asserting thesubstance of nondissipation. Their account includes (1) a presentation, (2) anexplanation, and (3) a conclusion.PresentationFor the first, the treatise states:> The account given by the Buddhas,> The self-realized buddhas, and the listeners> Is the one that is tenable here.> That, then, shall be set forth. [XVII.13] The scriptures of the Buddhas, self-realized buddhas, and listeners present anaccount that is supported by reasoning and that is tenable here in the contextof karmic causality. Hence, it shall be set forth.ExplanationSecond, the elaborate explanation of the position of the Proponents ofDifferences has nine subdivisions. The first is a presentation of the essence ofnondissipation using an example.The Essence of Nondissipation Shown through an ExampleThe treatise states:> Nondissipation resembles a promissory note.> The action then is the debt. [XVII.14a–b] Though a loan may have been spent, because of the promissory note, the capitalthat was loaned must be returned with interest to the creditor at some point.Thus, the creditor’s capital will not be lost. Likewise, when a virtuous ornonvirtuous action occurs, a phenomenon referred to as the “nondissipation” ofthat action will be present in the agent’s stream of being. This nonassociatedformation pertains to the category of attainment and is a different phenomenonthan the action itself. Resembling the loan, the action ceases as soon as it hasoccurred and is, for that reason, not permanent. Yet, in the same way that aspent loan must be paid back with interest at some point because of thepromissory note, the nondissipation of the action will ensure that its expandedeffect will follow at some point, although it has itself ceased. Therefore, theaction is not annihilated either.The Divisions of NondissipationSecond, presenting the divisions of nondissipation, the treatise states:> It is fourfold with reference to the realms [XVII.14c] Nondissipation is fourfold, for there is a particular type associated with thedesire realm, the form realm, the formless realm, and the undefiling realm.The Nature of NondissipationThird, on the nature of nondissipation, the treatise states:> And its nature is neutral. [XVII.14d] Nondissipation cannot be understood to be either virtuous or nonvirtuous. It is,therefore, of a neutral nature. If the nondissipation of a virtuous action werealso virtuous, this would mean that for someone whose fundamental virtues havebeen severed, all the nondissipation of virtue would be gone as well. This, inturn, would mean that that person would not experience the pleasant effects ofwhatever virtuous acts he or she committed in the past. Likewise, if thenondissipation of a nonvirtuous action were itself nonvirtuous, all thenondissipation of nonvirtue would have disappeared in the case of someone whohas achieved freedom from the desire that characterizes the desire realm. Such aperson would, then, not have to experience the effects of nonvirtuous actionsdone in the past.The Relinquishment of NondissipationThe fourth issue concerns the classification of nondissipation as a discard. Thetreatise states:> It is not eliminated by elimination,> Yet it is eliminated through cultivation. [XVII.15a–b] It is taught that:> For those who have seen the truth, there is no impelling.153 Hence, reaching the path of seeing means that there will be no engagement in anyof the actions that impel ordinary individuals to a rebirth in the three realms.Nevertheless, such impelling actions were accumulated while the individual wasan ordinary being and, generally speaking, the nondissipations associated withvirtuous and nonvirtuous actions are not eliminated by the attainment of thepath of seeing. Hence, nondissipation is not eliminated through the eliminationof discards that takes place when the intrinsic nature is seen.It is, however, eliminated through the path of cultivation. From the lesser ofthe lesser stages through the greater of the greater stages of the path ofcultivation, the nondissipation that is responsible for the experience of actionripening within the three realms is gradually eliminated. The process beginswith the elimination of the greater of the greater non-dissipations andculminates in the disappearance of the lesser of the lesser ones. The word “yet”in the beginning of the second line makes the message similar to the following:> For them there are no afflictions,> Yet they perceive the force of action.154 In other words, noble foe-destroyers have eliminated all the afflictions thatare associated with the three realms and that are to be discarded on the path ofcultivation. Yet until they have gone beyond the three realms, they will possessthe supportive aggregates and will experience the effects of the virtuous andnonvirtuous actions they engaged in the past. Therefore, they also possess thenondissipation associated with those actions. This nondissipation will beeliminated once they transcend the three realms.The RationaleFifth, on the rationale for the above classification, the treatise states below:> If it were eliminated by elimination> Or destroyed by a transference of action,> Various flaws would ensue,> Such as the destruction of action. [XVII.16] What if the nondissipation of actions were eliminated along with the actionsthemselves, or if nondissipation were eliminated by eliminating the factors thatare discarded through seeing? What if the continuity of nondissipationassociated with an action were destroyed by the transference of action thattakes place when shifting from one type of action to another? Such scenarioswould mean the destruction of the effects of the actions of both noble andordinary beings because the causes of such effects would be missing. Moreover,it would then be possible to encounter the effects of actions that one had notperformed, while the effects of what one has, in fact, done would be lost. Allsuch flaws would ensue from these positions.The Qualities of NondissipationSixth, on the qualities of nondissipation, the treatise states:> Therefore, it is due to nondissipation> That the effects of action are produced. [XVII.15c–d] The discards through seeing are, hence, eliminated without nondissipation beingeliminated. Although an action ceases, the continuity of its nondissipation willnot be destroyed. In this way, it is due to the nondissipation of past virtuousand nonvirtuous actions that noble and ordinary individuals experience thepleasant and unpleasant effects of their actions.The Arising of NondissipationThe seventh issue is the arising of nondissipation. First, its arising in thislife will be addressed. The treatise states:> During the present life it arises> Separately with each instance> Of the two types of action,> Remaining even after the ripening. [XVII.18] During the present life, a separate nondissipation arises with every instance ofdefiling or undefiling action. The action and its nondissipation aresubstantially different from one another. Nondissipation will, moreover, remaineven after it has effectuated a karmic ripening. Yet, just like a promissorynote that has been annulled subsequent to the return of a relevant loan, it willno longer be capable of engendering ripening.The Arising of Nondissipation at the Time of LinkingNext, on the arising of nondissipation at the time of the linking between twolives, the treatise states:> All those associated with realm-specific actions,> Whether congruent or incongruent,> Manifest as only one> When linking takes place. [XVII.17] Actions that are realm specific (in the sense that their ripening will beexperienced in the same realm as the one in which they are performed) may becongruent or an incongruent blend of virtue and nonvirtue. The substantialnondissipation associated with each such action will remain assembled as amultiplicity during the present life. Yet, when one life is linked with anotherlife within the desire, form, or formless realm, all such realm-specific actionswill no longer be multiple and instead manifest as a single substance ofnondissipation only.Although the actions may be congruent, actions that are not realm specific, andso are to be experienced in a different realm, will nevertheless not turn intothe same single nondissipation.155The Cessation of NondissipationEighth, on the cessation of nondissipation, the treatise states:> It ceases at transference> To the fruition or at death. [XVII.19a–b] Nondissipation ceases during the gradual process of transference into the fourfruitions of virtuous training. How this takes place was explained earlier inthe context of the second verse of the fifteenth stanza. Nondissipation alsoceases at the point of death. This is to be understood in terms of the cessationof the multiplicity of substances at the time of linking with another life andthe subsequent arising of one great nondissipation, as was explained in theseventeenth stanza.Concise Classification of NondissipationNinth, classifying nondissipation concisely, the treatise states:> It should be understood that it is divided> In terms of the defiling and undefiling. [XVII.19c–d] It should be understood that the defiling and the undefiling constitute aconcise classification of nondissipation.ConclusionThird, in conclusion the treatise states:> Emptiness and absence of annihilation,> Cyclic existence and absence of permanence—> The phenomenon of nondissipation> Is the teaching of the Buddha. [XVII.20] Action ceases as soon as it has arisen. Hence, it is empty of any permanententity and is, thus, not permanent. Nevertheless, it is not annihilated either,because, as it is taught:> The action of corporeal beings does not dissipate,> Even in a hundred eons.156 Thus, it is explained that although an action itself ceases, its nondissipationbrings about a karmic effect, making all these myriad forms of cyclic existencepossible.This concludes the presentation of the opponents’ objections.REPLIES TO THE OBJECTIONS In reply to the above, it will be explained that since action and its effecthave no nature, the cyclic existence that supports them has no existence either.This includes explaining (1) why there are no flaws in terms of permanence andannihilation, given that action has no nature, (2) the refutation of nature, and(3) how action and its results can be set forth conventionally using examples,although they have no nature.Without Nature, There Are No Flaws of Permanence and AnnihilationOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Why does action not arise?> Because it has no nature.> Because it does not arise,> Action does not dissipate. [XVII.21] All these attempts at explaining action as beyond permanence and annihilationare like working to restore a city of scent-eaters, or a dream city. They arepointless endeavors. If action were to arise by nature, it would have to eitherremain or perish, thus resulting in the flaws of permanence and annihilation.Yet given that action does not, in reality, arise, it is neither permanent norannihilated, like the child of a barren woman. And why would this be the case?Since action has no nature, it does not arise in reality.At this point, one may then wonder: “If this is the case, why do the sūtrasteach:> The action of corporeal beings does not dissipate,> Even in a hundred eons.> When the right time and conditions come together,> It ripens into its result.157 Indeed, what you say contradicts this teaching.”This, however, is not the case. What this sūtra points out is that, since actiondoes not arise in reality, there is nothing that could dissipate. On this point,it has been taught:> Because it does not cease by nature,> The capacity is still present, without any all-ground.158 Thus, because action does not arise by nature, it does not cease by natureeither. Moreover, since this does not conflict with the conventionalmanifestation of the effects of action, it is taught that action does notdissipate.The Nature of ActionThe second section includes (1) a criticism and (2) a refutation of arguments.The first of these includes two further sections: (1) setting forth theconsequence of action’s becoming permanent and (2) showing how accepting thisconsequence cannot be accepted.The Consequence of Action’s Becoming PermanentOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If action had a nature,> It would, undoubtedly, be permanent. [XVII.22a–b] It was objected that the evidence, action’s having no nature, lacksestablishment. Yet if action had a nature, it would, undoubtedly, be permanent.Its permanence would be entailed because, as has already been explained, “Anature that undergoes change would never make any sense.”159How the Consequence Is UnacceptableThe second involves demonstrating (1) the consequence that action would beuncreated and (2) the consequence that ripening would occur ad infinitum.The Consequence That Action Would Be UncreatedOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Action would not be created> Because the permanent cannot be active. [XVII.22c–d] For those who believe action to be permanent, action would be as uncreated asspace. This is entailed because something permanent cannot participate in anyactivity. If actions were permanent, they could not change from their previousstate of existence or nonexistence. The position that action is uncreatedconflicts with both (1) scripture and (2) worldly consensus. On the first issue,the treatise states:> If action were uncreated, there would be fear> Of encountering that which had not been done.> A lack of pure conduct> Would follow as a flaw as well. [XVII.23] > The distinction between virtuous persons and sinners> Would no longer make sense. [XVII.24c–d] Given that their effects would still have to be experienced, if actions werebelieved to be uncreated, one would have to fear encountering the effects ofactions that one did not commit, such as those with immediate effects. Moreover,spiritual practitioners who do not engage in impure conduct could still bestained by lack of pure conduct. Thus, the lack of pure conduct also follows asa flaw of the assertion that action is not created.Likewise, as pointed out in the next stanza, people who engage exclusively ineither virtue or evil could not reasonably be spoken of as “virtuous” or“sinners.” Indeed, they could not be distinguished at all because each would besubject to either the virtue or sin that they themselves did not commit.On the second issue, the treatise states:> Undoubtedly, this would> Contradict all conventions. [XVII.24a–b] Any activity that is done with the expectation of a certain result, such astilling a field, would be pointless if this were the case. In the end, thiswould undoubtedly contradict all the world’s conventions as well. For example,since effects would be present without having been created, telling someone,“make a vase,” would be pointless.The Consequence That Ripening Would Occur ad InfinitumOn the second consequence, the treatise states:> The ripening that has already ripened> Would go on ripening again and again.> For if it possessed a nature,> Action would remain present. [XVII.25] As explained above, if action had a nature, it would remain continuouslypresent. If we accept that, even actions that have already ripened wouldcontinue to ripen as if they had not yet done so, due to the fact that pastactions would still be present. Indeed, they would go on ripening again andagain.Refutation of ArgumentsSecond, the refutation of the arguments in favor of naturally existent actionshas three subdivisions. First is the refutation of the causal Afflictions.The Causal afflictionsThe treatise states:> Action is constituted by the afflictions,> But the afflictions are not real.> If afflictions are not real,> How could action be so? [XVII.26] It may be thought: “Action exists by nature. It is taught that ‘ignorance servesas the circumstance for formation, grasping serves as the circumstance forbecoming,’ and so on. Hence, since the afflictions that cause it exist, actionexists as well.”The afflictions, however, are not real because they originate dependently andthey disintegrate and come to an end. If the afflictions are not real, how couldaction be real? Its lack of reality is entailed because if, as stated, action isconstituted by the afflictions, that is, if it arises in dependence on theafflictions, we may conclude:> When the seed of something is false,> How could its arising be true?160 The Resultant BodySecond is a refutation of the resultant body. The treatise states:> Action and affliction are taught> To be conditions for the body.> If action and affliction are empty,> Then what can be said of the body? [XVII.27] It might be argued: “Action and affliction exist by nature because we observetheir effect, namely, the body.”If this were the case, what kind of nature could we ascribe to this subject, thebody? Since they have already been refuted, action and affliction are devoid ofnature. The entailment of this argument becomes evident by considering that thesūtras teach action and affliction to be the conditions for the body.The Resultant ConsumerThird is a refutation of the consumer that results from action. The treatisestates:> The consumer is that being> Who is obscured by ignorance and has craving.> This being is not different from the agent,> Yet neither are these two identical. [XVII.28] > Because action does not arise> Based on conditions> Or based on nonconditions,> There is no agent either. [XVII.29] > If there is no action and no agent,> How could there be a result produced by action?> If there is no result,> How could there be a consumer? [XVII.30] It might be argued: “Action exists by nature because its effect, the consumer,exists. A sūtra teaches:> Sentient beings obscured by ignorance> Are tied by the bonds of existence. Thus, the consumer is the being in whom ignorance obscures the eye of genuineinsight, thereby preventing the vision of the path to peace, and who hascraving. As is taught:> I myself will experience> The results of my own actions. Hence, the consumer is not substantially different from the agent that engagedin actions in the past. Yet it is not identical with the agent either, becauseif this were the case, it would be permanent and, thus, incapable of performinga function. Therefore, the consumer defies description, and by that token actionexists as well.”Yet the consumer itself lacks natural establishment. As this has already beenrefuted in the analysis of conditions and the analysis of action and agent,neither conditions nor nonconditions can produce actions. There is, therefore,no agent of action either. If neither action nor agent exist, how could therepossibly be any result produced by action? And when there is no result, howcould there possibly be any consumer of that? In other words, how could there besomeone who experiences the result?How Action Can Be Set Forth Conventionally Although It Has No NatureThird, showing how action can be set forth conventionally although it has nonature, the treatise states:> The Teacher, in a perfect miracle,> Creates emanations,> And these emanations again> Create further emanations. [XVII.31] > Likewise, the act performed by the agent> Resembles an emanation,> Just as when one emanation> Gives rise to another. [XVII.32] > Affliction, action, the body,> The agent, and the result> Are all like a city of scent-eaters,> Like an illusion, and like a dream. [XVII.33] It may be thought: “The sūtras explain the relationship between action and itseffects, teaching that ‘I myself will experience the results of my own actions.’Yet all of this has been refuted here. Hence, this view is a mistaken denial ofthe consequences of our actions; it is nihilism.”This is not the case. Indeed, we have refuted that any of this possesses anature, but we have not proved that it is nonexistent in a conventional sense.Neither is it the case that if something lacks nature, it cannot reasonablyfunction at the level of convention. Let us use an example that is accepted bythe treatises. The Teacher, the Buddha, the Transcendent Conqueror, createsemanations. These emanations are created in a perfect miracle where oneemanation gives rise to a second, the second creates a third, and so forth.Likewise, although the agent has no nature, it is still able to act in terms ofconvention. Thus, the agent resembles an emanation. Although the act has nonature, it can still be carried out conventionally, just as when one emanationgives rise to another. The same point can be made by means of an example that isin line with worldly consensus. Afflictions such as desire; the virtuous,nonvirtuous, or immovable actions that are motivated by affliction; theirresulting physical support (that is, the body); the ineffable self that is theagent of the karmic act; and the ripened, ruled, and concordant effects that arethe results of affliction and action—none of this has any nature, and yetconventionally it originates in dependence. It all appears in the same way as acity of scent-eaters, like an illusion and like a dream.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE In this way, the present chapter offers an existential refutation of the beliefthat such things as actions and their results have an ultimate nature. Likewise,it has established that, in terms of the relative, they originate in dependence,resembling emanations, and so on. The King of Meditative Absorptions explains:> When the Bliss-Gone One offers advice,> Then, he, the Protector and Victor,> Out of love for the wayfaring people, produces emanations,> And they too teach the excellent Dharma of the Buddha. > As this is heard by thousands of living beings,> They come to aspire to the Buddha’s supreme wakefulness,> Wondering, “When shall I attain such wakefulness?”> Knowing their wishes, the Victor thus grants his prophesy Furthermore:> A city of scent-eaters may appear,> Yet without existing anywhere in the ten directions, nor anywhere else.> There is nothing to it but a name.> It is, in this way, that the Thus-Gone sees this world. This concludes the explanation of the seventeenth chapter, the analysis ofactions and their results, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Rootof the Middle Way.153.

The Journey to Laṅkā similarly states:> This so-called self is a demonic idea;> From this, views issue forth.> These conditioned aggregates are empty;> Here, there is no self and no sentient being. Thus, the sūtras teach that the aggregates are devoid of any nature in terms ofboth the self and that which belongs to the self. This chapter employs reasoningto ascertain the meaning of such teachings.As for its relationship to the other analyses in the text, the present chapterpresents a reply to the following question: “Nothing is as it appears. Hence,the afflictions, actions, the body, and so forth are not real. They are similarto, for example, a city of scent-eaters. While they do not exist in reality,they mistakenly appear to exist from the perspective of the childish. What,then, is the real condition of phenomena? How is it realized? What are the meansfor gaining access to it? And what are the results of realization?”In response to these questions, the analysis of self and phenomena will explainhow outer and inner things are not genuinely established. For this reason, theobjects of the apprehension of a self and something that belongs it, that is,the aggregates associated with “I” and “mine,” are pacified from the beginning.When, through genuine insight, one observes neither the self nor something thatbelongs to it, all apprehensions of persons and phenomena with respect to outerand inner phenomena will be exhausted.When one inquires, “What are these aggregates associated with ‘I’ and ‘mine’?”and unerringly uses reason to examine this issue, what happens is as describedhere:> Once the object of examination is examined thoroughly,> Examination itself is found to be baseless.> Being baseless, it does not occur.> This as well is taught to be the transcendence of suffering.162 What this passage points out is that, from the perspective of rationalexamination, the aggregates associated with “I” and “mine” are not observed, andthere is no apprehension of a self or something that belongs to it. When suchapprehension is exhausted, affliction and action cease, the result of which isthe complete pacification of the cycle of birth and death, thereby bringing theattainment of the transcendence of suffering.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 18 The meaning of this chapter’s content will be explained in terms of (1) how toaccess reality, (2) the nature of reality, and (3) the results of realization.The first of these involves (1) refuting the notions of “I” and “mine,” (2) theeffect of this refutation, and (3) showing that this refutation does notcontradict scripture. The first topic includes (1) a refutation of theappropriating self by showing that it is neither identical to, nor differentfrom, the appropriated aggregates and (2) explaining how the appropriatedaggregates that belong to the self are refuted thereby.The Self Is neither Identical to nor Different from the AggregatesOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If the self were the aggregates,> It would arise and cease.> If it were different from the aggregates,> It would have none of their characteristics. [XVIII.1] Is the appropriating self essentially the same as, or different from, theappropriated aggregates? If identical with the aggregates, the self would ariseand cease, and it would be a composite of multiple factors. This followsbecause, if this were the case, the self would be essentially inseparable fromthe impermanent and multiple aggregates. The self being impermanent and multipleis unacceptable to non-Buddhist schools because it contradicts their claim thatthe self is permanent and singular. It cannot be accepted by the Buddhistschools either because something momentary cannot provide the common foundationfor both the agent of karmic actions and the one that experiences their results.This would render the principle of karmic causality untenable.A multiplicity of selves would also contradict Buddhist scripture, which states,“When the world is born, it is one single person that is born.” Similarly,Entering the Middle Way presents an elaborate refutation of those Buddhistschools that hold the self to be essentially the same as the aggregates:> If the self were the aggregates, it would be many> Because the aggregates are multiple.> The self would be substantial, and as the view of self> Would then apply to substance, it would not be mistaken. > At the transcendence of suffering, the self would certainly be annihilated,> And before that, the momentary arising and ceasing> Could not involve any agent, so consequences would be utterly nonexistent;> What was accumulated by one would be consumed by another.163 Our present treatise further explains:> The appropriated is not the self,> For it arises and disintegrates.> How could the appropriated> Ever be the appropriator?164 Yet, what if the self were essentially distinct from the aggregates? On thistopic, scripture states:> What is the conditioned? It is the five aggregates. Hence, if the self were essentially different from the aggregates, it would bedevoid of the arising, remaining, and ceasing that characterizes theconditioned. It would then not be feasible for the self to be a functionalthing.Alternatively, it may be explained that since the self would lack all of theindividual characteristics of the aggregates, such as being suited to be form,it would have to be observable via different characteristics and with adifferent essence. A self that has a different essence than the aggregates is,however, unobservable. Hence, it does not exist.In this context, it should be understood that the refutation of a self that isidentical to or distinct from the aggregates implicitly refutes also the beliefsin a self that supports the aggregates, that is supported by them, or thatpossesses them.The Entailed Refutation of the Appropriated AggregatesOn the second issue, the treatise states:> When the self does not exist,> How could that which belongs to it? [XVIII.2a–b] When the self that is the agent of causal karmic actions and the appropriator ofthe resultant aggregates does not exist, how could the effect of karmic actions,the appropriated aggregates that belong to the self, possibly have any naturalexistence? Without an agent there cannot be any action, and if there is noappropriator, there cannot be anything appropriated.The Effect of These RefutationsSecond, the effect of these refutations involves (1) explaining how subjectivegrasping is renounced, (2) dispensing with objections to this refutation, and(3) showing how the cessation of grasping brings about liberation.How Subjective Grasping Is RenouncedOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Due to the pacification of self and that which belongs to it,> The belief in an “I” and a “mine” will cease. [XVIII.2c–d] The yogin observes neither an appropriating self nor any appropriatedaggregates, being aware of their natural pacification. The belief in an “I” andof aggregates that are “mine” is, therefore, absent and does not occur, just asknowing a mirage to be devoid of water will make the mind stop thinking thatthere is water.The Renunciation of Grasping Is IndisputableOn the second issue, the treatise states:> The one who does not grasp at “I” or “mine”> Does not exist either.> The one who sees what lacks the grasping of “I” and “mine,”> That one does not see. [XVIII.3] It may be thought: “Since the yogin who does not grasp at “I” and “mine” exists,the self and that which belongs to it must exist as well.”The yogin for whom there is no apprehension of “I” and “mine” does not have anynatural existence either. The mere notions of self and aggregates have alreadybeen refuted, and there cannot possibly be any yogin who is not included ineither of these two principles. The yogin who is free from these two types ofgrasping is, hence, not established. Therefore, it must be understood that ifsomeone sees, or perceives there to be, an entity that is the yogin for whomgrasping “I” and “mine” are absent, then that person is not seeing reality. Asthe Sūtra on the King of Meditative Absorptions instructs:> See that the identity of the inner is empty.> See that the external is empty as well.> The one that meditates on emptiness —> No such thing exists either. The Cessation of Grasping Brings LiberationOn the third issue, the treatise states:> When the sense of “I” and “mine” that is based> On the inner and outer is exhausted,> Appropriation comes to an end.> As that is exhausted, so is birth. [XVIII.4] > Liberation follows from the exhaustion of action and affliction.> Action and affliction are due to thought,> And thoughts proliferate due to mental construction.> They are brought to an end by emptiness. [XVIII.5] The grasping sense of “I” and “mine” is based on the inner aggregates that areimbued with consciousness and the outer aggregates that are not. The exhaustionof this fixation brings an end to the fourfold grasping: grasping in terms ofdesire, view, the supremacy of view and discipline, and the doctrine of self.The exhaustion of these four causal graspings brings an end to becoming, which,in turn, brings an end to future rebirths as well. Hence, it should beunderstood that the attainment of liberation and the transcendence of sufferingfollow from the exhaustion of action and affliction.What is it, then, that brings an end to action and affliction? Well, action andaffliction cease once their causes cease. As was already explained, action andaffliction are caused by incorrect thinking, apprehending a self and somethingthat belongs to it, and so on. These thoughts, in turn, are due to mentalconstruction.The term “mental construction” translates the Sanskrit prapañca. This term hasseveral meanings, but in the present context it refers to the mental constructsthat are associated with the apprehension of marks. Thus, it implies the mentalconstruction of something that cognizes and something that is cognized; thatwhich is signified and that which signifies; and so forth. All suchproliferating constructs stem from a construction of marks to which the mind hasbeen accustomed since beginningless time. By familiarizing oneself with the viewthat sees the natural emptiness of all the constructed phenomena related to mindand cognized objects, all this is brought to an end. When mental constructscease, the incorrect thinking that they produce is brought to an end; whenincorrect thinking ceases, affliction ends; when afflictions cease, action ends;and the cessation of action means the end of birth.The Refutation of I and Mine Does Not Contradict ScriptureOn the third issue, the treatise states:> “Self” is stated> And also “no self” is taught.> The Buddhas even teach that there is neither> Self nor absence of self. [XVIII.6] Some may wonder why the absence of self and that which belongs to it would notcontradict certain teachings, such as the following:> The self is its own protector.> Who else could provide protection?> It is by taming the self that the wise> Attain the higher realms.165 And this:> Black and white deeds are not destroyed;> The self must experience what it itself brought about.166 Nevertheless, while there are indeed such statements, it is also taught that:> Here, there is no self and no sentient being;> These phenomena have causes.167 And can it be denied that scripture also states:> All phenomena are empty of self. Therefore, we must seek the underlying intent of such teachings. When exploringthem, we notice that the Buddhas have stated that there is a “self.” Yet suchstatements are generally directed toward inferior individuals that are to beinfluenced, such as the Far-Throwers. Such people deny karmic causality, arguingthat this is impossible given the absence of a self. Cyclic existence is alsoimpossible, they claim, because there is nobody who enters this life from a pastexistence, and no one who leaves it to proceed to a future life. Given therelative existence of the self that is imputed based on mere phenomena, theBuddhas have said that the self exists to care for such people, who as a resultof their denial are prone to fall into the lower realms.Those to be influenced who are of moderate capacity hold a rigid view of theself. Based on that view, they believe that actions lead to karmic consequences,and for that reason, they avoid doing what is nonvirtuous. Given the merelyrelative presence of the property that is the negation of truth, the Buddhasalso teach that there is no true self, so as to help these people loosen theirview of the transitory collection and connect them with the transcendence ofsuffering.Among those to be influenced there are also some who are of the highestcapacity. These individuals trust in the relative existence of karmic causalityand hold the view of the absence of true self. To enable such individuals togive up apprehending the marks associated with negative properties, the Buddhasteach that, in reality, there is neither a self that is to be negated, nor anytype of negation or absence of such a self either.Our position, therefore, is not contradicted by scripture, nor does it implythat the scriptures contradict each other. Indeed, there are no such flaws. TheNoble Jewel Mound Sūtra explains:> Kāśyapa, “self” is one extreme. “No self” is another extreme. The middle that> lies between these two extremes cannot be taught. Alternatively, the sixth stanza of this chapter can be read as follows. TheEnumerators and other groups posit the existence of the self because theybelieve that karmic causality would not be feasible based on momentaryformations. The Far-Throwers teach that there is no self because they do notobserve a self that participates in cyclic existence. The Buddhas, who seereality without error, teach that there is no self or absence of self asimagined by these groups.Of these two readings, the former is better.THE NATURE OF REALITY The second issue concerns the nature of reality. This will be treated withrespect to (1) the ultimate and (2) the relative. The first issue will includeexplaining (1) how the ultimate cannot be taught in terms of an essence of itsown, (2) how the ultimate is taught by means of superimposition, and (3) thecharacteristics of that teaching.How the Ultimate Cannot Be Taught in Terms of an Essence of Its OwnOn the first issue, the treatise states:> The expressible is annulled> Because the domain of the mind is annulled.> The intrinsic nature, unarisen and unceasing,> Equals the transcendence of suffering. [XVIII.7] It may be thought: “If neither self nor absence of self can be taught withrespect to reality, then what can be taught?”If anything could be said about ultimate reality, then that would be taught. Butsince all that can be expressed concerning the ultimate using linguisticconcepts has been annulled, nothing whatsoever is taught. What does this mean?Well, if the ultimate were accessible to the mind, there would be reasons basedon which one could refer to it through superimposition. But the entire domain ofthe mind, all the mind’s observations, are annulled when it comes to theultimate. Applying names to it by means of superimposition is, therefore,impossible.Why is it that the domain of the mind is annulled? The suchness of phenomena’sintrinsic nature is primordially unborn and unceasing. It is, therefore, equalto the transcendence of suffering, free from all adventitious stains.Essentially, it is primordial peace in all regards. Hence, there is nothingthere that could possibly present itself to the mind.The present stanza can also be seen as a reply to a question regarding the waythat mental constructs are “brought to an end by emptiness,” as was statedabove. One may wonder: “How does seeing them as emptiness make mental constructscease?” Emptiness transcends all that can be expressed and conceived of. Allverbal and conceptual constructs, therefore, cease by the very understandingthat this is its nature.The stanza can also be seen as a response to the following question: “It wastaught that reality is, with respect to all inner and outer things, theprimordial pacification of the self and that which belongs to it. If so, is itthen possible to express or conceive of reality in some way or another?”The reply to this query proceeds in a similar manner to the previous response,by stating that reality transcends that which is expressible and so forth. Forthese reasons, the Master explains:> Complete pacification of all observations,> The complete pacification of constructs, peace —> Nowhere did the Buddha teach> Any Dharma to anyone at all.168 How the Ultimate Is Taught by Means of SuperimpositionOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Everything is real and unreal,> Real and indeed not real,> Not unreal and not real—> That is the thorough teaching of the Buddha. [XVIII.8] It may be argued: “The ultimate truth transcends the objects of word andthought. Nevertheless, unless a teaching is given by means of superimposition interms of the relative, those who are to be influenced will not be able torealize its nature. Moreover, unless they gain this realization, they will notbe able to attain any of the three types of transcendence of suffering. Such ateaching by means of superimposition is, therefore, necessary.”Thus, the present stanza addresses the issue of using superimposition as askillful way to teach. Generally, to instill faith in novice disciples, theBuddhas first take the mundane and childish perspective into account, teachingthat the inner and outer entities that make up the world and its inhabitants areall real. Later, to help those to be influenced give up attachment to suchentities, the Buddhas consider the perspective of the mind of a noble one thatinvolves appearance, teaching that such things are unreal. To ensure that thesetwo perspectives are not seen as contradictory, and to avoid the one-sidedextremes of existence and nonexistence, they also teach their conventionalreality in combination with their ultimate lack of reality. Thus, they teachboth reality and the lack of reality. Finally, the most gifted among those to beinfluenced must succeed in eliminating the subtle obscuration as well, which isnothing but the view that the negative property, lack of reality, is ultimate.To ensure that these disciples eliminate this obscuration, the Buddhas teach ina way that considers the equipoise of the noble ones, explaining that, while allof these things are not real, they are not unreal either. Thus, they teachfreedom from all the constructs associated with an affirmed or negated self.Hence, the teaching of the Buddhas accords with those who are to be influenced.As it gradually guides disciples along the path to the nonabiding transcendenceof suffering, this teaching is thorough. For this reason, the master Āryadevastates:> Existence, nonexistence, existence and nonexistence,> And neither existence nor nonexistence—all this is taught.> Does it not always depend on the character of the disease> What will be spoken of as “medicine”? 169 The Characteristics of the Ultimate TeachingOn the third issue, the treatise states:> Not known by anything else, peace,> Not constructed through constructs,> Absence of concepts, and absence of a different meaning—> These are the characteristics of reality. [XVIII.9] One may ask: “What are the characteristics of ultimate reality?”It has already been explained that, if examined with respect to its nature, theessence of the ultimate, or the bearer of its characteristics, transcends therealm of speech and mind. It is, therefore, also taught that since there isnothing to support the characteristics of ultimate reality, there are nocharacteristics either. Still, just as its essence is taught by means ofsuperimposition, the characteristics of ultimate reality must be explained byway of superimposition as well. Above, the characteristics of reality were,therefore, taught in terms of the exclusion of that which does not accord withreality. What follows here is a presentation of characteristics that is meant todispel misunderstanding.Awareness of the ultimate occurs through individual self-awareness within theequipoise of the noble ones, by way of nothing being seen at all. Anythingelse—such as language, argumentation, examples, and the other factors that serveas means for realization among the childish individuals obscured byignorance—cannot make it known exactly as it is, by way of nothing being seen atall. Next, reality is peace because from the beginning it has no essentialestablishment whatsoever. It is not a construct of language for reality is not alinguistically constructed meaning, nor is it something that can be conceived ofand expressed. Likewise, concepts cannot capture reality in any way for ittranscends the domain of the mind. Finally, reality does not constitute anydifferent meaning because dissimilar instances have no place within the basicfield of phenomena to which all phenomena belong. These five properties areexplained to be the characteristics of reality. As can be seen from thefollowing citations, they are also taught in the sūtras:> The suchness of all phenomena is to be realized by means of the wakefulness of> individual self-awareness by wise and intelligent noble beings. It is not the> domain of logicians. > Turning the wheel of Dharma,> You teach primordial peace and nonarising,> The natural transcendence of suffering;> Protector, these are the qualities you reveal.170 > Within the ultimate truth there are no movements of the mind, much less> syllables.171 > Son of gods, the ultimate must not be taken to be absolutely unarisen and> treated as something different from all phenomena. The present stanza can also be read as a sequence of explanations. The ultimatecannot be known by any other means, such as language and argumentation, becauseit is not constructed by means of verbal or mental constructs. In other words,it is not an object of word and thought because thought cannot conceive of it byway of any name or category. The reason for this is that, in essence, theultimate has been peace from the very beginning. It is not established asanything whatsoever. There is, therefore, nothing that could present itself tothe mind. Hence, we may recall the following statement:> Within the intrinsic nature that is not established as anything at all, How> could there be two, three, and so forth?172 Therefore, as there are no separate divisions, the ultimate is not any differentmeaning.The Nature of the RelativeSecond, concerning the nature, or characteristics, of relative reality, thetreatise states:> That which arises in dependence on something else> Is not identical with it,> Nor is it something other.> Hence, it is neither annihilated nor permanent. [XVIII.10] > The Buddhas, protectors of the world,> Grant the elixir of teaching> Without sameness or difference of meaning,> Without annihilation and without permanence. [XVIII.11] As was explained earlier, the relative is characterized by being true as theobject of a conventional, deluded cognition that has not engaged in examination.The bearers of this characteristic, that is, the relative essences, consist ofall dependently originated phenomena. Thus, this as well is the path of theMiddle Way that is free from the two extremes.When an effect arises in dependence on a cause in this way, the effect is notsubstantially identical with its cause because nothing can act on itself. Thecause is, therefore, not permanent, as it would be if it were still present atthe time of its effect. Nor is the effect substantially distinct from its causebecause in that case it would not be dependent on it. Therefore, the cause hasnot been annihilated either, in the sense of having become nonexistent at thetime of its effect.The Buddhas are the protectors of the world, saving it from the myriads ofmiserable states that comprise existence and peace. Their teaching of dependentorigination and natural nonarising is an elixir that forever eliminates birth,aging, sickness, and death. As was just explained, this teaching of the Buddhasdoes not consider cause and effect to be either the same or different, and so itdoes not imply either permanence or annihilation.It has also been argued that the first stanza explains how relative dependentorigination avoids permanence and annihilation, whereas the second stanza showsthe ultimate’s natural emptiness to be free from permanence and annihilation.THE RESULTS OF REALIZATION On the third issue, the treatise states:> Where a perfect Buddha has not appeared> And the listeners have disappeared,> The wakefulness of self-realized buddhas> Will, in the absence of a teacher, arise in full. [XVIII.12] One may ask: “What are the results of the exact realization of these twotruths?”Those who possess the potential of a listener will, through study, reflection,and meditation, gradually apply them themselves to the ultimate existentialnegation of all phenomena and to relative illusion-like dependent origination.As they partake of the elixir of the three accumulations of discipline,meditative absorption, and insight in this way, they bring an end to the causalafflictions of the three realms. Either in that life, or otherwise in asubsequent one, they will effortlessly achieve the transcendence of sufferingthat is the exhaustion of birth, aging, and death. As Āryadeva explains:> Even if insight into reality does not> Bring the transcendence of suffering in that very life,> One will definitely achieve it without effort in future lives> In accordance with karmic action.173 Those who possess the potential for self-realized buddhahood can be of sharp,moderate, or dull faculties. By means of such faculties, they progressivelyengage in study, reflection, and meditation, giving rise to wakefulness as aresult. The latter occurs in a realm that is empty, devoid of perfect Buddhas,and in which the listeners are absent. The time when their wakefulness arisesdiffers depending on the capacity of the practitioner. For those of sharpfaculties, it occurs on the stage of heat; in the case of medium levelfaculties, it takes place on the stage of acceptance; and for those of dullfaculties, it happens on the path of cultivation. Whichever happens to be thecase, the arising of this wakefulness occurs without any condition in the formof a spiritual teacher being present and relied on in that life. Rather, ittakes place by the power of having become accustomed to virtue in the past, aswell as having made aspirations. As a result of this wakefulness, they actualizethe knowledge of exhaustion and of nonarising. In the end, both the listenersand self-realized buddhas must achieve the nonabiding transcendence ofsuffering, just like the offspring of the victors. The following account is,therefore, applicable to the listeners and self-realized buddhas as well.Those who have the potential for the Great Vehicle gather the accumulation ofwakefulness by familiarizing themselves, ultimately, with phenomena’sexistential negation. Relatively, they gather the accumulation of merit byembracing [their virtuous acts] with the relative enlightened mind, relying onillusion-like dependent origination. As they gather these two accumulations,they achieve a transcendence of suffering in which there is, respectively, noabidance in existence or peace.Becoming accustomed to the unerring realization of the meaning of the twotruths, the three classes thus temporarily arrive at their individual levels ofenlightenment. In the end, however, they all accomplish unsurpassedenlightenment. Therefore, as it is so deeply meaningful, it is appropriate forintelligent individuals to pursue this realization without any concern for lifeand limb, just like the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita.This concludes the explanation of the eighteenth chapter, the analysis of selfand phenomena, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the MiddleWay.161.

Doing soinvolves refuting (1) the essence of time and (2) the arguments in favor oftime. The first topic is contained in the analysis of time, which, like theother analyses, is treated in terms of the three issues.174THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 19 First, regarding the chapter’s context, the analysis of time is related to theprofound sūtras, such as the following teachings from the Mother of theVictorious Ones:> Form should not be qualified as past, future, or present, because the past,> future, and present do not exist themselves. This chapter employs reasoning to ascertain such claims that the three timeshave no nature.As for its relation to the other analyses, the present chapter presents a replyto an argument such as this: “The nature of things may have been negated, but sofar time has not. Time is mentioned in the sūtras, so it must exist. Given theexistence of time, entities must exist as well because they are the reason thattime is posited. The three times are posited with reference to things that haveceased, not yet arisen, and arisen but not ceased, respectively.”The present analysis will show that, since time itself does not exist, theentities that are the cause for time being posited do not exist either.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 19 The explanation of the meaning of this chapter’s content includes (1) showingthe natural existence of time to be flawed and (2) refuting the arguments fortime’s natural existence. The first issue further includes (1) a refutation ofpresent and future time and (2) extending the refutation to other topics. Thefirst of these will be treated by (1) refuting dependence on the past, (2)refuting the absence of such dependence, and (3) drawing a conclusion.Refutation of Dependence on the PastOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If the present and the future> Depend on the past,> The present and the future> Exist in the past. [XIX.1] > If the present and the future> Do not exist in the past,> How can the present and future> Be dependent on it? [XIX.2] If the present and future exist by nature, do they depend on the past or not? Ifthis question is answered in the affirmative, it will be argued that they mustalso exist in the past. Let us consider this argument’s reverse entailment: Ifsomething is nonexistent in something else, then the former cannot depend on thelatter, as is the case with sesame oil and sand. It might be objected that thisargument is inconclusive because two incompatible qualities can be absent fromeach other, yet still be established in mutual dependence, as is the case withlight and darkness. This objection does not hold, however, because two suchqualities are not, in reality, established as incompatible in dependence on eachother. If they were, nobody could avoid the consequence that they would thenalso exist in each other. If the consequence of the present’s and future’sexisting in the past is accepted, these two must also be accepted as past, andthen there would be no present and no future. If this were the case, the pastwould itself end up being nonexistent because it owes its establishment to thepresent and future.Wishing to avoid these flaws, one might say that present and future do not existin the past. But, in that case, they cannot depend on it. When that whichdepends is present, that upon which it depends would be absent, and when thebasis for dependence exists, the dependent would be nonexistent. Indeed, suchdependence is not feasible.Lack of Dependence on the PastOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If the two do not depend on the past,> Then they are not established. [XIX.3a–b] Certain followers of non-Buddhist schools teach:> Time matures the elements.> Time brings people together.> Time puts to sleep and wakens.> Escaping time is extremely difficult. According to these schools, time is a permanent substance. Thus, both thepresent and the future exist independently of the past. Yet present and futureare not established independently of the past because the two are explained,directly and indirectly, in terms of being subsequent to the past.Drawing a ConclusionOn the third issue, the treatise states:> The present and future> Therefore, do not exist. [XIX.3c–d] Because they can be established neither in dependence on, nor independently of,the past, the present and future do not possess any natural existence.Extending the Reasoning to Other TopicsSecond, extending this analysis to other topics, the treatise states:> By these very same steps, the other two,> The supreme, the middling, and the inferior, and so forth;> As well as singularity and so on> Can also be understood. [XIX.4] The very same steps that have here shown that the present and future are notestablished, whether or not they depend on the past, can just as well be appliedto the other two combinations. In other words, with the appropriate changes,they can be used to show that there is no establishment for the past and thefuture, whether or not they depend on the present, and that the present and thepast lack establishment, whether or not they are dependent on the future. Thus,we easily arrive at the statement, “If the past and the future depend on thepresent, the past and the future exist in the present,” as well as, “If the pastand the present depend on the future, the past and the present exist in thefuture.”Upon examination, we find that the three times do not exist, whether they areconsidered mutually dependent or independent of each other. The same insight canbe gained with respect to any other set of three mutually dependent things, suchas the supreme, the middling, and the inferior; birth, remaining, and ceasing;the desire, form, and formless realms; training, nontraining, and neither ofthese; the old, the young, and the middle-aged. As indicated by the words“singularity, and so on,” the same holds when we examine the singular, pairs,triads, groups, and so forth. All combinations are seen to be unestablished,whether the individual factors are treated as interdependent or self-sufficient.It should, therefore, be understood that they are all devoid of nature.Hence, the present chapter has explained that, while there cannot possibly beany phenomenon that does not originate dependently, we may test any dependentorigination with respect to the presence or absence of dependence. Doing so, wewill never find anything established. Ultimately, this chapter has thus offeredan existential negation of the mental constructs associated with all phenomena,while relatively, it has established that phenomena resemble illusions.THE ARGUMENTS FOR TIMESecond, refuting the arguments for time involves refuting time with reference to(1) extent and (2) entities.With Reference to ExtentOn the first issue, the treatise states:> A time that does not endure is not apprehended.> Since a time apprehended as enduring> Does not exist, how can one speak> Of a time that is not apprehended? [XIX.5] It may be argued: “Time does indeed exist by nature because it has extent. Timeis taught to extend from instants and moments up to eons. Something nonexistent,like the horn of a rabbit, could not have extent.”Nevertheless, temporal extent throughout instants and so forth is not naturallyestablished. Does time extend from one moment to another or not? If it does notendure in the next moment, time cannot be apprehended as an extent of instantsand so on precisely because it does not last. This is entailed because in thepresent instant itself there is no basis for measurement, and it was claimedthat time does not endure into any subsequent instant. Measuring an extent has,therefore, become impossible.Alternatively, it may be argued that time endures. If there were time thatendures, it could be measured as the extent of instants and so on. Yet since atime apprehended as an enduring extent does not exist, how can it be measuredand referred to as an extent of instants and so forth? Indeed, it is asimpossible as measuring the child of a barren woman.Why does enduring time not exist? Well, if time were distinct from entities, itwould be observable as such from the perspective of mundane direct perception.The very fact that such a separate time is not observed, therefore, disprovesits existence. Moreover, momentary entities are established by conventionalinference. [From the perspective of such an inference,] in the end, entitiesthat are of a momentary nature are all that is apprehended and observed. Hence,there is no enduring time.With Reference to EntitiesOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If time is based on entities,> And there are none, how could there be time?> When there are no entities at all,> How could there be any time? [XIX.6] Members of our own tradition may argue: “There is no time that enduresseparately from momentary entities. Still, because of those entities, there isalso time. Time is conceived of based on entities, and because of them we speakof it being naturally existent. Otherwise, how could there possibly be timewithout entities? Indeed, there is no such thing.”The bases, entities, have already been negated. Hence, there are no entities atall. How, then, could there possibly be any natural existence of time, which isconceived of based on them? This is no different than conceiving of thesharpness of a donkey horn. For this reason, the sūtras teach that time is notnaturally established. With respect to the present, they teach:> If phenomena had any nature,> Then the victors and the listeners would know it.> Solid phenomena do not attain the transcendence of suffering.> The wise would never become free of mental construction.175 And on the past:> Hundreds of thousands of teachings may be given,> And hundreds of thousands of Buddhas may convene;> Yet phenomena and syllables still do not end.> Since they never arose, they do not end.176 And concerning the future:> At a time when the Thus-Gone Ones appear,> A victor known as Maitreya will come,> And the ground will be spread with gold.> How could there be any time for such events?177 This concludes the explanation of the nineteenth chapter, the analysis of time,in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.174. In this chapter, the concluding summary appears to be included in theexplanation of the fourth stanza.175. From the Sūtra of the Elephant’s Strength.176. From the King of Meditative Absorptions.177. From the Jewel Mound."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE ASSEMBLYTHE REFUTATION of the arguments for time is contained in two chapters, the firstof which is the analysis of the assembly. This chapter, which refutes theassertion that time is a cooperating condition in the production of effects, istreated in terms of the three issues as well.178THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 20 In terms of context, the relationship between the analysis of the assembly andthe profound sūtras can be appreciated from the following passage from the Noble[Sūtra of] the Great Display:> Based on the lips, the throat, and the palate,> The sounds of syllables emerge from movements of the tongue.> Yet this is not done by the throat and not by the palate;> The syllables are not observed in any of these alone. > Based on their assembly, speech emerges> Due to the mental consciousness.> Yet mind and speech are invisible and intangible,> Observable neither within nor without. > When the arising and cessation of speech, voice, language, and tone> Are examined by the wise,> All speech is seen to be like an echo,> Momentary and devoid of essence. Here, reasoning is used to ascertain the meaning of such accounts of the lack ofnatural existence with respect to that which arises due to an assembly.As for its relation to the other analyses, members of our own tradition mayargue: “Time was refuted, but it still exists by nature. Sprouts and otherexternal things arise only at particular times. For example, in the spring, theinner ripening of karmic results also depends on time. On this point, it istaught:> The action of corporeal beings does not dissipate,> Even in a hundred eons.> When the right time and conditions come together,> It ripens into its result.179 Hence, time exists because it is a cooperating condition in the production ofouter and inner effects. Something nonexistent, like a sky flower, cannot be acondition.”In response to this objection, the present chapter will explain how time cannotreasonably be a condition for effects because, upon examination, they themselvesare found not to arise.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 20 Second, the explanation of the content includes (1) a refutation of the notionthat production occurs due to an assembly of causes and conditions, (2) arefutation of the belief that production occurs due to a cause, and (3) aconclusion to the refutations. The first issue includes a refutation of arisingeffects by considering (1) the effect and (2) the cause. The first of these isagain divided into refutations that pertain to effects that arise based onassemblies that (1) precede their effects, (2) are simultaneous with them, and(3) are subsequent to them.Effects That Arise Based on a Previous Causal AssemblyOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If effects are produced by an assembly> Of causes and conditions> And are present in those assemblies,> How could they be produced by those assemblies? [XX.1] > If effects are produced by the very assembly> Of causes and conditions,> And are not present in those assemblies,> How could they be produced by those assemblies? [XX.2] > If effects are present in the assemblies> Of their causes and conditions,> They should be perceptible in those assemblies,> And yet they are not perceptible in those assemblies. [XX.3] > If effects are not present in the assemblies> Of their causes and conditions,> Then the causes and conditions> Equal what are not causes and conditions. [XX.4] If a previous assembly of causes and conditions produces an effect, we may askwhether that effect is something that was itself present or absent within thatprior assembly. If the first is the case, how could the effect be produced bythe assembly, given that it already exists? The argument’s entailment can beseen from the fact that it is meaningless for something that is already presentto arise.In the case of the alternative, how could an assembly of causes and conditionsproduce an effect that is absent within it? Since the effect is nonexistentwithin the assembly, its production would be similar to sesame oil being derivedfrom an assembly of sand grains. This argument’s entailment can be seen byconsidering how the production of something nonexistent is impossible. Indeed,this would be utterly absurd.Moreover, if, along the lines of the first option, an effect were present in theassembly that causes it, then we would be able to apprehend it there. It followsthat the effect would be observable in the assembly, and since it cannot beobserved there, we can conclude that it is not present there. If, on the otherhand, an effect is not present in the assembly of its causes and conditions, itfollows that this set of causes and conditions is equal to those factors thatare not its causes or conditions since the effect is equally absent within them.Therefore, such an assembly cannot produce an effect. Here, the entailment canbe appreciated from the explanations of the argument from identical reasons andthe way that the entailment of a single conceptual distinction is equallyrelevant in the case of “other.” These were supplied [in the commentary onchapter one].Effects Arising Based on a Simultaneous Causal AssemblyOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If effects arise together> With their assemblies,> The producer and produced> Will then be simultaneous. [XX.7] It may be argued: “An effect arises from the assembly of its causes andconditions that is simultaneous with it, as when a lamp produces light.”Hence, two stanzas below, it is explained that if an effect arises together withthe assembly of its causes and conditions in this way, this implies that theproducer and the produced are present at the same time. Such a simultaneitycannot be established, however, because the establishment of the producerexcludes the establishment of the produced, and vice versa.Effects Arising Based on a Subsequent Causal AssemblyOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If effects arise> Before their assemblies,> The absence of causes and conditions> Implies that effects are uncaused. [XX.8] Certain Proponents of Differences may say: “Prior to the assembly of the causesand conditions, the effect is something that exists in the future. The assemblyfunctions to make this future effect arise in the present.”If the essence of the effect has arisen before the assembly of its causes andconditions in this way, however, the effect that exists in the future would becauseless because it would exist independently of its causes and conditions.In Consideration of the Causal AssemblyThe second section refutes production by an assembly by considering the causesof production. Further below, the treatise states:> If the assembly of causes and conditions> Does not itself> Produce its own identity,> How could it produce an effect? [XX.23] How could the subject, the assembly of causes and conditions, produce the effectin reality? Nothing can be an agent for itself. Therefore, the assembly does notproduce its own identity. It is, thus, similar to space. The argument’sentailment is as follows: Since the assembly is not produced by itself but,rather, in dependence on other things, it cannot have a nature of its own.Lacking a nature of its own it will, as was shown in the analysis of suffering,be unable to produce the nature of its effect.PRODUCTION BY A CAUSE Second is the refutation of production by a cause. Some may argue: “An effect isactually not produced by the assembly of its causes and conditions. The produceris the cause, and the role of the assembly of conditions is to contribute toit.”The refutation of this idea is divided into ten sections. First, it will beshown that, whether or not it is supplied to the effect, a cause cannot produceanything.Whether or Not It Is Supplied to the Effect, a Cause Cannot Produce AnythingThe treatise states:> If the cause ceases to be> Having been supplied to its effect,> It follows that the cause has two identities,> One supplied and another that ceases. [XX.5] > If a cause ceases to be> Without having been supplied to its effect,> The effects that arise when it has ceased> Do not have any cause. [XX.6] It is taught:> As a cause transforms,> It becomes the cause of something else.180 Hence, for the arising of an effect to take place, its cause must have ceased.We may then ask if a cause ceases, having supplied the agentive cause, which isthe quality that enables the effect’s arising, to its effect or without havingsupplied the effect with this quality? If the first is the case, and the causeceases, having passed the agentive cause on to its effect, it follows that thecause possesses two identities because one causal identity ceases whereasanother one is supplied. In other words, the cause is half permanent and halfimpermanent, and it is impossible for the same substance to be both. This ideais, therefore, untenable.If the second option were the case, the full identity of the cause would thencease without the agentive cause having been supplied to its effect. This, inturn, would mean that the effect is causeless because it arises after its causehas ceased.Effects Are Not Produced by Identical CausesSecond, refuting the notion that effects are produced by causes that are notdifferent from them, the treatise states:> If a cause ceases,> Yet is transferred to its effect,> It follows that a cause already arisen> Would arise once more. [XX.9] It may be argued: “The aforementioned criticism would be relevant if cause andeffect were substantially different, but they are not. As the causal stateceases, it is the cause itself that abides as the identity of the effect.”If, in this way, that which is the nature of the causal state becomes theresultant state by ceasing, it would be as though we were dealing with one actorwho keeps putting on different costumes. In this way, the nature of a cause isfully transferred into all other contexts. It follows from this assertion thatcauses are permanent, in which case they could not be functional things. It isalso a consequence of this position that arising as such would becomemeaningless because it would mean that the same cause that had already arisenonce would later arise again.It may be objected: “Arising is not meaningless because that which arises is notthe identity of the previously arisen cause. Rather, it is the identity of thesubsequently arisen effect.”This objection, however, is not valid either. First, according to the opponent’sassertion, cause and effect are of the same nature. Their difference, therefore,is purely nominal. Second, even if there are different situations, the nature ofthat which participates in such situations cannot differ throughout them.Causes Can Produce neither a Present nor an Absent EffectThird, showing that causes can produce neither effects that have arisen, northose that have not, the treatise states:> How could that which has ceased and disappeared> Be the producer of an arisen effect?> An enduring cause that is connected to its effect,> How could that produce it? [XX.10] > If cause and effect are not connected,> What effect would then be produced? [XX.11a–b] Do causes produce effects that have already arisen, or those that have yet toarise? If the first is proposed, we may then ask whether or not an effect’scause has already ceased. If it has, if the cause has disappeared and becomenothing, how could it then be the producer of the arisen effect? A cause thathas ceased and become nonexistent does not have the power to produce an effect.Moreover, the arising of an arisen effect would also be meaningless.If, alternatively, the cause has not ceased but remains in a state of beingconnected to the presently arisen effect, how could it be the effect’s producer?Having undergone no change, it lacks the quality of being a contributor to aneffect, which is what characterizes causes. Furthermore, the arising of analready arisen effect is also meaningless.If, on the other hand, the cause is thought of as producing an effect that hasnot yet arisen, there cannot be any connection between cause and effect. Whatsort of effect could then be produced? It would be nothing at all. Otherwise,since all things would then be equally unrelated, any given cause could giverise to anything.Causes Do Not Produce Seen or Unseen EffectsFourth, showing that causes cannot produce effects that are seen or unseen, thetreatise states:> Whether seen or unseen by the cause,> No effect is produced. [XX.11c–d] Would an effect be produced by a cause that sees it, or a cause that does notsee it? The first cannot be because a nonexistent cause could not see, and if acause already exists, its arising would be meaningless. On the other hand, itwould be absurd for a produced effect to be unseen. The cause’s product wouldthen be whatever it does not see.Causes Cannot Contact or Fail to Contact Their EffectsFifth, regardless of whether or not the two come into contact, causes cannotproduce effects. The treatise states:> A past effect is never in contact> With a cause that has passed,> Nor with one that has not arisen,> Or one that has already arisen. [XX.12] > An effect that has arisen> Is never in contact> With a cause that has not arisen,> That has passed, or that has arisen. [XX.13] > An effect that has not arisen> Is never in contact> With a cause that has arisen,> Has not arisen, or that has passed. [XX.14] > If there is no contact,> How could a cause produce its effect?> Even if there is contact,> How could a cause produce its effect? [XX.15] Moreover, do causes produce their effects while being in contact with them, ornot? The first option is not possible because a) contact as such is impossibleand b) even if there were contact, there could not be any production. Let usconsider the first of these two problems. If there were contact between causeand effect, there might be something produced and something that produces, butno such contact exists. Whether we consider a past, future, or present effect,there cannot be any contact with a cause that is either past, future, orpresent.This will be shown in three steps. First, a past effect cannot be in contactwith a past, future, or present cause. Any such relationship between a pasteffect and a cause that has passed, not yet arisen, or already arisen isimpossible. In the first case, both cause and effect have passed and ceased tobe. In the second, both are nonexistent, with one having ceased and the othernot yet arisen, in addition to being separated in time. In the third case, thetwo are not present at the same time, and the effect is nonexistent.Second, a present effect cannot be in contact with a future, past, or presentcause. There is never any meeting between a presently arisen effect and a causethat has yet to arise, that has passed, or that is arising in the present. Inthe first case, the two are separated in time, and the cause is nonexistent,having not yet arisen. In the second, they are again temporally separated, whilethe cause has passed and is, therefore, nonexistent. In the third case, the twoare simultaneous. They could not, therefore, be cause and effect, and any senseof contact and dependence would be lost as well.Third, a future effect cannot come into contact with a cause that belongs to anyof the three times either. A future effect never comes into contact with a causethat has arisen, has not yet arisen, or has passed. In the first case, cause andeffect are separated in time, and the effect, not having arisen, is nonexistent.In the second, both have yet to occur and are, for that reason, nonexistent. Inthe third case, the two occur at different times and are nonexistent.Although this enquiry enables us to see that there is no such contact, let usnevertheless assume that contact is indeed possible, as in the second half ofstanza fifteen. In other words, even if there were contact, how could a causeproduce an effect? It would not make sense for it to do so because when twothings are simultaneous, one cannot produce the other.Finally, what if we then say, as in the first half of stanza fifteen, thatcauses produce effects without being in contact with them? Well, if this werethe case, how would a cause produce its effect? Any given thing could thenproduce whatever it is not in contact with. Also, based on such a theory,effects would end up causeless.Causes Cannot Produce Anything, Whether Empty or Not Empty of Their EffectsSixth, causes cannot produce anything, whether they are empty or not empty oftheir effects. The treatise states:> If empty of an effect,> How can a cause produce its effect?> If not empty of an effect,> How can a cause produce its effect? [XX.16] Do causes produce their effects while being empty of them? If this were thecase, how could they possibly do so? Just as those factors that are not causes,a cause would, in this way, be devoid of its effect. It could, therefore, notproduce it. On the other hand, how could a cause produce an effect if it werenot empty of it? Like jujubes in a jar, the effect would already be presentwithin it, in which case its production would be meaningless.Neither Empty nor Nonempty Effects Can AriseSeventh, whether or not they themselves are empty, effects cannot arise. Thetreatise states:> An effect that is not empty does not arise.> An effect that is not empty does not cease.> It follows that what is not empty> Has not ceased and has not arisen. [XX.17] > How can the empty arise?> How can the empty cease?> It follows that the empty> Has not ceased and not arisen. [XX.18] We may also ask whether the arising effect is itself something that is empty ofnature. If it is, then how can such an effect, being devoid of nature, actuallyarise? Moreover, how can this empty effect actually cease? Arising and ceasingwould be as impossible as the sky flower because there would be no basis forthem. Moreover, effects that are empty of nature themselves have no support inthe first place. Hence, it also follows that, in reality, they neither cease norarise. As is taught:> In short, only that which is empty> Arises from empty phenomena.181 And:> Everything is possible> For those for whom emptiness is possible.182 Thus, here it is explained that conventional arising and ceasing are feasiblegiven their empty nature. Hence, these scriptural statements do not contradictthe above.If it is held that the arising effect is not empty, we may recall the previousstatement that, “Nature cannot reasonably occur due to causes andconditions.”183 Likewise, it was also shown that “a nature that undergoes changewould never make any sense.”184 Thus, effects that are not empty but naturallyexistent do not arise, just as that which is not empty, and hence existent bynature, does not cease. Why is that? Because it follows that such a thing hasnot ceased and that nothing has caused it to arise.Effects Are Not Produced by Identical or Different CausesEighth, effects are produced neither by causes that are identical to them, norby those that are different. The treatise states:> Cause and effect being identical> Will never make sense.> Cause and effect being different> Will never make sense. [XX.19] > If cause and effect were identical,> Produced and producer would be the same.> If cause and effect were different,> Cause and noncause would be equal. [XX.20] Are effects produced by causes that are essentially distinct from them, or arecause and effect indistinguishable? The cause and the effect’s being essentiallythe same will never make sense; nor will it ever make sense to say that causeand effect are essentially different. This is the Master’s genuine thesis.The reasoning, here, is as follows. If the conventions of cause and effect werethe very same substance, this would mean that the produced and that whichproduces it are the same identical substance. This, however, is unacceptablebecause nothing can be its own object. This account of cause and effect wouldalso make father and son, the eye and eye consciousness, and other such pairsessentially the same. Alternatively, if cause and effect were differentsubstances, noncauses would be able to produce the same effects that causes do.Similarly, if noncauses were not able to produce them, these effects could notbe produced by their causes either. This follows from the fact that this ideaputs cause and noncause on an equal footing. It has already been explained how,with respect to the unqualified single conceptual distinction of otherness, itis impossible to make any distinction in terms of what is and is not produced inreality.Neither Existent nor Nonexistent Results Are ProducedNinth, neither existent nor nonexistent results are produced. The treatisestates:> If an effect is existent by nature,> Then what could its cause produce?> If an effect is nonexistent by nature,> Then what could its cause produce? [XX.21] If it is in the nature of things that causes produce effects, are the producedeffects essentially existent or nonexistent? If they exist by nature, what wouldit be that causes produce? Indeed, production would be meaningless; as hasalready been explained, something created by a cause cannot be natural.Next, if results are nonexistent by nature, what, really, could causes produce?The basis for production would be absent. Hence, the product would be similar tothe sky flower.Some might call the latter argument into question, stating that a reflection,which is devoid of nature, can still be causally produced. Yet this objectiondoes not hold because such an example shows precisely the absence of realproduction; it has not been refuted that, conventionally speaking, somethingdevoid of nature can be causally produced.Causality Is Not NaturalTenth, subsequent to these refutations follows a conclusion regardingcausality’s proven lack of nature. The treatise states:> If it does not produce any effect,> The cause does not make sense.> If the cause does not make sense,> Of what, then, is the effect? [XX.22] Now, if they do not produce any effects, causes do not make any sense becausethey are classified as such precisely because they produce effects. At thispoint, it would also be unreasonable to think that while causes are nonexistent,effects still exist. As explained above, if a cause does not exist, of whatcause is the effect the effect? Both its essence and the positing of the termdepend on there being a cause. Hence, if there is no cause, there cannotpossibly be any effect.CONCLUSION Third, concluding the discussion, the treatise states:> Therefore, nothing is produced by an assembly,> And yet there is no effect made by anything else.> When no effect exists,> How can there be an assembly of conditions? [XX.24] It has been shown that an assembly cannot produce an effect that precedes,follows, or is simultaneous with it. It was also pointed out that since anassembly cannot engender itself, it cannot produce an effect. Therefore, thereis no effect that is produced by an assembly.Nevertheless, the notion that effects can be the product of a mere cause that isnot an assembly of causes and conditions has been refuted as well. Hence, nosuch effect can be established.Finally, it cannot be maintained that causes exist despite there not being anyeffects. In the absence of effects, how could there be an assembly ofconditions, or any cause at all? Indeed, the rationale for positing them wouldbe absent.This concludes the explanation of the twentieth chapter, the analysis of theassembly, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.178. In this chapter the traditional concluding summary appears to be identicalwith the “Conclusion” that ends the section on “The Content of Chapter 20.”179. From the Minor Precepts of the Vinaya.180.

Ibid., XV.8c–d."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF ARISING AND DISINTEGRATIONTHE SECOND CHAPTER devoted to the refutation of the arguments for time is theanalysis of arising and disintegration. This chapter, which refutes the ideathat time is the cause of arising and disintegration, is likewise treated interms of the three issues.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 21 First, in terms of context, this chapter relates to the profound sūtras, asindicated by the following passage from the Mother of the Victorious Ones:> Arising and disintegration cannot be seen to accord with reality. And this quotation from the King of Meditative Absorption:> No phenomenon arises or disintegrates;> There is no death, no transference, and no aging.> This is what the Lion of Men has taught,> And in this he has established hundreds of beings. Here, reasoning will be used to ascertain the meaning of such teachings on theabsence of arising and disintegration.As for its place among the other analyses, the present chapter can be seen as aresponse to the following objection from a non-Buddhist: “Although time wasindeed refuted here, it does exist by nature because time is what causes thearising and disintegration of external and internal things. There may be anassembly of other conditions, but unless certain temporal changes take place, noarising or disintegration will be observed. Something nonexistent, like the hornof a rabbit, could not be the cause of arising and disintegration.”Thus, it is held that time is a distinct, permanent, and substantially existentfactor that causes the arising and disintegration of things. In reply, it willbe shown that because arising and disintegration are themselves nonexistent,time cannot be established as their cause.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 21 Second, the explanation of this chapter’s content is divided into two sections:(1) a statement of flaws and (2) a refutation of arguments. The first issuepresents refutations that involve (1) testing for coexistence and absence ofcoexistence, (2) considering that which has ceased and that which has notceased, (3) considering the absence of support, (4) considering the empty andnot empty, and (5) testing for sameness and difference. The first topic includes(1) a statement of the thesis, (2) an account of its rationale, and (3) asummary.The ThesisOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Disintegration occurs neither apart from> Nor together with arising.> Arising occurs neither apart from> Nor together with disintegration. [XXI.1] If arising and disintegration were to exist by nature, each would have to bepresent either separately or together with the other. Yet, upon examination, itwill be seen that disintegration does not occur apart from or together witharising, nor does arising occur apart from or together with disintegration.The Rationale of the ThesisAs for the second issue, the treatise states:> Disintegration without arising,> How could this occur?> There would be dying without birth.> Without arising, there is no disintegration. [XXI.2] > Disintegration together with arising> How could this occur?> Death does not take place> At the very same time as birth. [XXI.3] > Arising without disintegration,> How could this occur?> It is not that things> Ever lack impermanence. [XXI.4] > Arising together with disintegration,> How could this occur?> Birth does not occur> At the very same time as death. [XXI.5] First, the belief that disintegration can occur without arising is refuted.Disintegration without arising, how could this occur? If this were to happen, itshould be possible for something to disintegrate without having arisen, and viceversa. Or, if we think of particular instances of arising and disintegration,there should be sentient beings that die without having been born. Suchconsequences cannot be accepted, however, because this is not how we see thingsand because it renders disintegration uncaused. Therefore, the conclusion, byway reversing the consequential argument, is stated in the words, “Withoutarising, there is no disintegration.”Next is the refutation of the notion that disintegration occurs together witharising. Disintegration together with arising, how could this occur? If thiswere to happen, a single entity could die at the same time that it is born. Yetthat is not how it is because the functions of death and birth are asincompatible as light and darkness.Following this is a refutation of the idea that arising occurs withoutdisintegration. How could the subject, arising, exist without disintegration,given that it is an entity and, as such, is similar to a stroke of lightning?The entailment of this argument can be seen from the fact that there will neverbe an entity that is not impermanent. If something were, by its nature, capableof remaining from one moment to another, rather than disintegrating, [itsself-perpetuation] could never be stopped. Thus, it would never come to an end.This, however, runs counter to what we see. Also, something permanent andunchanging would not be capable of performing a function, neither gradually norinstantaneously.Finally, the assertion of the coexistence of arising and disintegration isrefuted. How could arising and disintegration occur together? If they did, asingle person’s birth and death would happen at the same time. This is not thecase, however, for birth and death function in ways that are as incompatible aslight and darkness.SummaryThird, as a summary, the treatise states:> When two things are neither> Established as coexistent,> Nor as not coexistent,> How can they be established? [XXI.6] When arising and disintegration are neither established as coexistent nor as notcoexistent, how can they be established? Indeed, they would then be similar tothe right and left horns of a rabbit. [Their complete lack of establishment]follows from the fact that coexistent and not coexistent are directlycontradictory.It might then be thought: “Arising and disintegration still exist, but in such away that they cannot be said to be identical or distinct.”However, precisely because arising and disintegration do not exist as either ofthese two directly contradictory qualities, it has already been established thatthey are completely devoid of nature.The Ceased and Not CeasedOn the second issue, the treatise states:> There is no arising of the ceased,> Nor is there arising of the not ceased.> There is no disintegration of the ceased,> Nor is there disintegration of the not ceased. [XXI.7] If arising and disintegration exist, do they pertain to something that hasceased or to something that has not? There is no arising of that which waspreviously present, but which has now ceased because arising and cessation areincompatible qualities and also because that which has ceased cannot provide anysupport for arising. Neither is there any arising of that which has not ceased,whether we think of the latter as an existential or a predicative negation ofcessation. In the first case, “the not ceased” is essentially nonexistence, justlike the horn of a donkey. If “the not ceased” is taken as a predicativenegation, then that which has not ceased is something that already exists.Likewise, there is no disintegration of that which previously existed but whichhas now ceased because such a thing has already disintegrated, and there is anabsence of a support for arising. And again, whether “the not ceased” isunderstood as an existential or a predicative negation of cessation, it cannotinvolve any arising. In the former case, the not ceased equals essentialnonexistence and in the latter, it is something that is incompatible withdisintegration.The Absence of SupportOn the third issue, the treatise states:> Where there is no thing,> There is no arising and no disintegration.> Without arising and disintegration,> There is no thing. [XXI.8] When things themselves do not exist, their supported properties of arising anddisintegration are as nonexistent as the braided hair of a frog. And why wouldthings be nonexistent? Because arising and disintegration have already beenrefuted. Without arising and disintegration, there cannot be any things. Inother words, there cannot be any bearers of these characteristics. Given thenonexistence of these properties, that which is entailed by arising anddisintegration must be equally nonexistent.The Commentary treats this stanza as a reply to an objection that claims thatarising and disintegration must exist, given the existence of their support,things. It thus explains that this evidence, [existent things,] is notestablished.The Empty and Not EmptyOn the fourth issue, the treatise states:> With respect to the empty,> Arising and disintegration make no sense.> With respect to the not empty,> Arising and disintegration make no sense either. [XXI.9] Are arising and disintegration empty of nature? If they are, real arising anddisintegration do not make sense, for arising and disintegration would then haveno support, and thus be similar to the sky flower. Alternatively, if they arenot empty of nature, arising and disintegration do not make sense either. As wasexplained earlier, that which is not empty of nature cannot be altered orundergo any change due to causes and conditions.Sameness and DifferenceOn the fifth issue, the treatise states:> Arising and disintegration> Do not make sense if the same.> Arising and disintegration> Do not make sense if different. [XXI.10] If there is arising and disintegration, are they essentially the same ordifferent? Arising and disintegration do not make sense if they are essentiallyidentical because they are as incompatible as light and darkness. Nor do theymake sense if they are essentially distinct because arising would then end uppermanent, and disintegration would have no cause. As neither of these can bemistaken for the other, the two are mutually dependent.REFUTATION OF ARGUMENTS Second is a refutation of the arguments [advanced to prove the existence ofarising and disintegration]. First, the notion that arising and cessation areestablished by perception will be refuted.Arising and Disintegration Are Not Established by PerceptionOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If you think,> “I see arising and disintegration,”> Then know that what you see> Is due to ignorance. [XXI.11] It may be thought: “Why all this detailed analysis? Arising and disintegrationare directly perceived by everyone, including cowherds, so they exist bynature.”Those who think this should understand that what everyone, the cowherd included,sees is similar to a city of scent-eaters and other such examples. While thereare no truly existent things, our ignorance makes it seem as if there are. This,however, does not prove their true existence.Arising and Disintegration Are Not Established by InferenceSecond, it will be explained that arising and disintegration cannot beestablished by inference. Some may argue: “Arising and disintegration existbecause the thing that functions as their support exists.”In reply, it will be shown that the evidence in this argument, a thing, istantamount to what has yet to be established. This reply will take the form of arefutation (1) with reference to the absence of production and (2) by means ofan absurd consequence. The first topic begins with a refutation of the notionsthat production is due to either things or nonthings.Neither Things nor Nonthings Are ProductiveThe treatise states:> Things do not arise from things.> Things do not arise from nonthings.> Nonthings do not arise from nonthings.> Nonthings do not arise from things. [XXI.12] If things exist by nature, are they produced by things or nonthings? One thingis not produced by another thing because [the resultant thing would then] besimultaneous with a cause that has not yet transformed, in which case the effectcould not be influenced by it. Also, since the effect is an existent thing inthis scenario, its production would be meaningless. Things are not produced bynonthings either because a nonthing possesses no productive capacity.Likewise, if we assume that certain nonthings exist, we may then ask whethersuch nonthings are produced by things or nonthings. A non-thing cannot be theproduct of a nonthing because the resultant nonthing would be indistinguishablefrom the causal one. Moreover, a cause that is a nonthing would also bepowerless. Finally, a nonthing cannot be the product of a thing because nonthingand thing are incompatible. If effects could arise out of something with whichthey are incompatible, a lamp would also be able to emit darkness.The Sanskrit term bhava, [which is here translated as “thing,”] can also meanarising. With this in mind, the stanza can also be read as a denial of arisingand disintegration by arguing that neither of these factors is produced bythings or nonthings.Neither Self nor Other Is ProductiveNext is a refutation of the idea that production is due to self or other. Thetreatise states:> Things do not arise from themselves> Nor from something other than themselves.> When nothing arises from either self or other,> How could there be arising? [XXI.13] A thing cannot be produced by itself because its absence would then entail theabsence of that which produces it as well. Its presence, on the other hand,would contradict its being a product. A thing cannot be produced by somethingother than itself either because, whether or not that other thing has ceased,production will remain impossible. Finally, when both of these two options havebeen dismissed individually, it is clear that a thing cannot be produced bytheir combination either. When this is the case, how could there be anyproduction, given that uncaused production is an extremely unreasonable idea?An Absurd ConsequenceThe second issue includes (1) a statement of the absurd consequence and (2) arefutation of the defense.The ConsequenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If the existence of things is claimed,> Views of permanence and annihilation follow> Because these things must then> Be permanent or annihilated. [XXI.14] When members of our own tradition claim that things exist, they contradict thewords of the Able One. Moreover, this will lead to the views of permanence andannihilation, the sources of all flaws. The reason here is that these thingsmust be permanent if they are not destroyed from one point in time to the next,while if they are destroyed, and thus impermanent, it follows that they areannihilated.Refutation of the Defense of Existent ThingsSecond is the refutation of the defense of this position. First the defenseitself is presented.The DefenseThe treatise states:> Although the existence of things is claimed,> Permanence and annihilation do not follow> Because existence is the continuum of effects and causes> That arise and disintegrate. [XXI.15] It may be argued: “Although we claim that things exist, this does not entailpermanence and annihilation. As past causes disintegrate, future effects arisein the unbroken continuum that constitutes cyclic existence. Since causes ceasewhile effects arise in such a continuum, there is, respectively, no sense ofeither permanence or annihilation.”Refutation of the DefenseThe refutation of this defense includes demonstrating (1) the consequences ofpermanence and annihilation even if a continuum is claimed and (2) theinescapable flaws of permanence and annihilation since the continuum itself isnot established. The first issue is divided into two sections. First we willconsider the consequence of permanence.Permanence as a ConsequenceBelow, the treatise states:> If things have an essential nature,> They cannot reasonably become nonexistent. [XXI.17a–b] If causal things exist by their essential nature, they cannot reasonablydisintegrate and become nonthings. Hence, they would be permanent.Annihilation as a ConsequenceAnnihilation also follows from this belief. Here, it will be shown that (1) thecausal substance is annihilated in the context of existence, whereas (2) theresultant continuum is annihilated in the context of peace.The Causal Substance Is AnnihilatedOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If a continuum of arising and ceasing> Causes and effects constitutes existence,> That which is destroyed does not arise again> And so causes are annihilated. [XXI.16] If existence is an unbroken continuum of causes and effects that arise andcease, it follows that the substances that make up these causes are annihilatedbecause, once they have disintegrated, they do not arise again.The Resultant Continuum Is AnnihilatedOn the second issue, the treatise states:> When suffering is transcended there is annihilation,> For the continuum of existence is then entirely pacified. [XXI. 17c–d] When suffering is transcended, things would definitely be annihilated becausethe continuum that, as was claimed before, is the reason that things are notannihilated would be entirely pacified at that point.It might then be asked: “Why would you followers of the Middle Way not face thesame flaws?”Indeed, we do not because arising does not ultimately take place; because, interms of the relative, cause and effect are not said to be either identical ordistinct; and because, in terms of the relative fabrication through causes andconditions, the word “annihilation” does not apply to a pacification in thesense of an annulment of the cause. Therefore, know that there are no flaws ofpermanence and annihilation with respect to either of the two truths.The Continuum Itself Is Not EstablishedOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If the last ceases,> The first existence does not make sense.> When the last does not cease,> The first existence does not make sense. [XXI.18] > If the last is in the process of ceasing> While the first arises,> There is one that is ceasing> And another that arises. [XXI.19] > Hence, it does not make sense either> For ceasing and arising to occur together.> Could the aggregates with which one dies> Be the ones with which one is born as well? [XXI.20] > Therefore, nowhere in the three times,> Could there reasonably be any continuum of existence.> How could something outside of the three times> Be the continuum of existence? [XXI.21] Given that the continuum of existence exists by nature, we may look closer atthe connecting point between the present and future lives. At this point, doesthe first moment of existence of the future life arise after, before, or at thesame time as the cessation of the last moment of existence in the present life?If it arises after the last existence (that is the cause) has ceased, thearising of the first moment of existence in the next life (that is the result)does not makes sense because this would be like a sprout growing from a burntseed, or something arising without a cause.If the resultant first existence arises without the causal last existence havingceased, its arising does not make sense either, for this would mean that therewere two existences for the same one person. That, in turn, would imply thearising of an extra sentient being that did not exist before, and so theoriginal person would be permanent while the new one would be uncaused.Finally, if the resultant first existence arises while the causal last existenceis in the process of ceasing, then there is one existence that performs theactivity of arising while another performs that of ceasing. Thus, there would betwo existences for a single person. It might be thought that this flaw can beavoided by considering the existence that is ceasing and the existence that isarising to be essentially the same. But having both the ceasing and the arisingexistence take place at the same time in this way does not make sense either.Could the very substance of the dying aggregates also be that which is born?This would be an extreme contradiction. The word “either” [in the first line ofthe twentieth verse] recalls that it is not reasonable for arising and ceasingto take place separately.Therefore, nowhere in the three times—as they relate to the causal lastexistence’s having ceased, not having ceased, and being in the process ofceasing—could there be any arising of a resultant first moment of existence.Therefore, the continuum of existence does not make sense because how couldsomething that, when examined, is seen not to exist anywhere in the three timespossibly be the continuum of existence? When investigated, the continuum ofexistence is, thus, itself devoid of establishment.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE With respect to the ultimate, the present chapter has offered an existentialnegation of the constructs associated with dependently originated phenomena asentailed by the presence of arising and disintegration. With respect to therelative, it has proven that these phenomena are false and resemble illusions.As taught in the Sūtra of the King of Meditative Absorptions:> The three realms are like a dream, they have no core.> Rapidly disintegrating and impermanent, they resemble an illusion.> There is no coming, nor any going away from here.> The continua are always empty and devoid of marks. And likewise:> Being born and dying,> And yet not being born or dying—> The one who comprehends this> Has no difficulty in discovering this meditative absorption. This concludes the explanation of the twenty-first chapter, the analysis ofarising and disintegration, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Rootof the Middle Way."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE THUS-GONEIN THIS SECTION, it will be explained that dependent origination is empty of thecontinuum of existence. This will be done in two chapters, the first of which isthe analysis of the Thus-Gone, the result of this continuum. This chapter, whichrefutes the natural establishment of the Thus-Gone, is treated in terms of thethree issues as well.185THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 22 First, in terms of context, the present chapter’s relationship to the profoundsūtras is evident from the following citations. The Mother of the VictoriousOnes proclaims:> Even the truly and completely Enlightened One is like a dream, like an> illusion. And in the King of Meditative Absorptions:> When the Thus-Gone cannot even be observed as the body of qualities,> Why mention that he cannot be observed as the body of form.> Phenomena, always unarisen, are the Thus-Gone.> All phenomena are like the Bliss-Gone-One.> Those of childish intellect grasp at marks,> And thus, within the worlds, relate to phenomena that do not exist. Here, the meaning of such statements that describe the final fruition, theThus-Gone One, as being devoid of nature will be proven through reasoning.As for its relation to the other chapters, the present analysis replies to anobjection such as this: “Though the continuum of existence was refuted, it stillexists. Having gathered the accumulations over three incalculable eons, forexample, the Thus-Gone achieves omniscient wakefulness and so realizes the realnature of all phenomena, just as it is. The Thus-Gone is the effect of thecontinuum of existence. Therefore, given his existence, the continuum exists aswell.”In response, it is stated that, contrary to what the opponent believes, theThus-Gone is himself not established by nature. Thus, his cause, the continuumof existence, is not established in this way either.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 22 Second, the explanation of this chapter’s content involves (1) refuting thenotion that the Thus-Gone is established by nature, (2) establishing that he is,therefore, beyond all beliefs, and (3) extending this analysis to other topics.The first issue includes (1) showing that the appropriating person who is theThus-Gone lacks establishment, (2) showing that the aggregates that areappropriated by him lack establishment, and (3) drawing a conclusion. The firstof these will include refuting (1) the substantial existence and (2) the nominalexistence of the person by pointing out that the person does not exist inrelation to the appropriated in any of the five ways.The Thus-Gone Is Not Substantially ExistentOn the first issue, the treatise states:> He is not the aggregates, nor is he different from them.> He is not in them, nor are they in him.> Neither does the Thus-Gone possess the aggregates.> Who, then, is the Thus-Gone? [XXII.1] If the appropriating person who is the Thus-Gone exists by nature, we may askwhether he is identical with or different from that which is appropriated(whether that be the five aggregates of discipline and so forth that constitutethe ground of Buddhahood, or the five aggregates of form and so on). We maylikewise ask whether this appropriator is the support for the appropriated orthe appropriated supports him. Finally, we may also enquire as to whether theappropriator possesses that which is appropriated. Indeed, one of these fiveoptions would have to be the case.The Thus-Gone is not of the essence of the aggregates because he would thenarise and disintegrate, he would be multiple, and the object and agent in theact of appropriation would be the same. Neither is the Thus-Gone essentiallydifferent from the aggregates because no Thus-Gone can be observed separate fromthem. Moreover, if they were distinct in this manner, he would be independent ofthe aggregates, and there would then be no reason to associate him with them.Likewise, the Thus-Gone does not support the aggregates, nor are they present asa support for him. Indeed, this is impossible, given that these two are notdifferent from each other. Finally, the Thus-Gone does not possess theaggregates because he is not established as identical with or distinct fromthem. When we undertake this fivefold analysis with respect to the appropriated,which is the basis for the designation of the Thus-Gone, we fail to find him.Who then is the Thus-Gone? He lacks all natural establishment.The Thus-Gone Is Not Nominally ExistentConcerning the second issue, the Sammitīyas may now argue: “Indeed, neither ofthese five options are applicable, for they entail the aforementioned flaws.Yet, in dependence on the aggregates, a Thus-Gone who can neither be describedas identical with nor different from these aggregates does exist in reality as adesignation.”The refutation of this idea will be carried out by showing that no suchnominally designated Thus-Gone is established because (1) there is no basis forthis designation, (2) he cannot be established as either a self-entity or as anentity that is of another nature, and (3) there is no appropriation.There Is No Basis for the DesignationThe first issue is treated further below. The treatise states:> When examined in the five ways,> He exists neither as identical nor different.> How, then, could a Thus-Gone who does not exist like that> Be spoken of by virtue of appropriation? [XXII.8] As explained above, the Thus-Gone is neither identical with nor different fromthe aggregates. This further implies that he cannot support, be supported by, orbe in possession of the aggregates. How could one, upon this fivefoldexamination, speak of a Thus-Gone who does not exist in any of these ways asbeing involved in appropriation in reality? Indeed, there is as little basis forsuch a proposition as there is for saying that a donkey’s horn is sharp.The Thus-Gone Is neither a Self-Entity nor of the Nature of OtherThe second issue is divided into three parts: (1) a presentation, (2) anexplanation, and (3) a conclusion.PresentationOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If the Buddha exists dependent on the aggregates,> And thus not by his own nature,> How could that which does not exist in terms of its own nature> Exist through the nature of another? [XXII.2] If the Buddha is designated as such in dependence on the aggregates, he does notexist by his own nature, and so resembles a reflection. How could such aThus-Gone, who in terms of his own nature is as nonexistent as the child of abarren woman, possibly obtain any natural existence in reliance on the nature ofsomething else, that is, the aggregates? As was explained earlier, that which isfabricated by causes and conditions cannot be natural.ExplanationIn the second section, first the notion of self-entity will be refuted.The Thus-Gone Is Not a Self-Sufficient EntityThe treatise states:> That which depends on the nature of another> Cannot reasonably have an identity of its own.> How could something lacking an identity> Turn out to be the Thus-Gone? [XXII.3] That which is spoken of in dependence on the nature of something else cannotreasonably possess any natural identity of its own, as is the case with areflection. How could something that lacks a natural identity be, in reality,the Thus-Gone? Something like that could not be the Thus-Gone, the one who hastraversed the unmistaken path.The Thus-Gone Is Not an Entity in Dependence on OtherSecond, refuting the belief in an entity that is established as the nature ofother, the treatise states:> If he does not exist by his own nature,> How could there be the nature of something else? [XXII.4a–b] If the Thus-Gone himself does not exist by nature, how could there be anyaggregates that, in dependence on him, could be considered to be of the natureof something else? As there are no “other” entities, there cannot be a Thus-Gonewho exists in relation to such things either.ConclusionOn the third issue, the treatise states:> Apart from what is of the nature of self and other,> What sort of Thus-Gone could there be? [XXII.4c–d] Since he is not established on his own or with respect to other things, whatsort of Thus-Gone could possibly exist? It would have to be someone who isneither related to himself nor to anything other than himself. Indeed, there isno such Thus-Gone.There Is No AppropriationThe third issue includes showing that (1) prior to the appropriated, theappropriator does not exist, (2) there could be no appropriation by anappropriator who has no prior existence, (3) without an appropriation therecannot be something appropriated, and (4) there is no appropriator withoutappropriation.There Is No Appropriator Prior to the AppropriatedOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If, independent of the aggregates,> There were a Thus-Gone,> Then he could now rely on the aggregates> And, based on them, become that. [XXII.5] > Yet, independent of the aggregates,> There is no Thus-Gone at all. [XXII.6a–b] When Devadatta exists before his wealth, he can subsequently take possession ofit. Likewise, if there were some sort of appropriator, a Thus-Gone, prior to andindependent of the aggregates that are composed of the ground of enlightenment,then he could subsequently rely on those aggregates and become theirappropriator. Thus, based on his having appropriated those aggregates, he wouldhave become qualified for the title “Thus-Gone.” Yet, upon examination, we findthat, independent of and prior to the aggregates of the ground of Buddhahood,there is no Thus-Gone at all. Since there is no thing that could receive thattitle, he is no different than the child of a barren woman.Without a Preceding Appropriator There Cannot Be Appropriation.On the second issue, the treatise states:> When there is no one who exists independently,> How could there be any appropriation? [XXII.6c–d] Hence, when there is no Thus-Gone whose presence precedes and is independent ofthe aggregates, how could any appropriation of the aggregates be undertaken byhim? Similarly, if Devadatta does not exist before his relation to wealth, hecannot take possession of it.Without Appropriation There Cannot Be Something AppropriatedOn the third issue, the treatise states:> Without any appropriation,> There cannot be something appropriated. [XXII.7a–b] Since the appropriator has no prior existence, no appropriation takes place. Asthis is the case, the aggregates cannot be something that is appropriated.Without Something Appropriated There Cannot Be an AppropriatorOn the fourth issue, the treatise states:> Not involved in appropriation—> Such a Thus-Gone does not exist at all. [XXII.7c–d] There is no Thus-Gone who is not involved in the appropriation of aggregates.The Aggregates Appropriated by the Thus-Gone Are Not Established> That which is appropriated> Does not exist by its own nature.> That which does not exist by itself,> Can definitely not exist due to other things. [XXII.9] Not only is the Thus-Gone, the person who is the appropriator, nonexistent, thatwhich is appropriated by him, the aggregates of Buddhahood, do not exist eitherbecause they occur due to causes and conditions, and because they are dependenton their appropriator. It might be thought that the aggregates do exist, but asa result of other things, such as the causes and conditions from which they aredifferent, or a distinct appropriator. Yet that which is nonexistent in and ofitself can definitely not obtain any natural existence in reliance on somethingelse, such as causes and conditions or an appropriator. As was alreadyexplained, that which is fabricated and partakes of a relationship of mutualdependence cannot exist by nature.ConclusionThird, as a common conclusion to the refutations of the appropriator and theappropriated, the treatise states:> Thus, the appropriated and the appropriator> Are empty in all regards.> Given their emptiness, how to speak> Of an empty Thus-Gone? [XXII.10] The appropriated and the appropriator are, in this way, empty in all regards.How can we then speak of any reality with respect to a Thus-Gone, who thus isempty and depends on empty appropriations?THE TRANSCENDENCE OF ALL BELIEFS The second section discusses how the Thus-Gone transcends all beliefs. One mayobject: “Giving up other teachers, we go for refuge in the Thus-Gone, and sopursue liberation. You, on the other hand, negate this, the foremost among allsources of refuge. Destroying all hope for liberation, you develop a distortedview of denial.”In response, it will be shown that (1) the reality of the Thus-Gone is beyondall mental and verbal constructs and (2) it is a flaw to apprehend it asconfined to such constructs.The Reality of the Thus-Gone Is Beyond All ConstructsOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Do not say “empty,”> And do not say “not empty” either.> Do not say “both” and do not say “neither.”> These are to be stated for the sake of designation. [XXII.11] > Permanence, impermanence, and the other two—> How could they pertain to this peace?> Limited, limitless, and the other two—> How could they pertain to this peace? [XXII.12] > One seized by the dense fixation> That the Thus-Gone exists> Will think that, upon his transcendence,> The Thus-Gone no longer exists. [XXII.13] > As for a Buddha empty of nature,> To declare that, upon transcendence,> He exists or does not exist> Would not make any sense. [XXII.14] The one who made the aforementioned objection may have gone to the Able One forrefuge and be in pursuit of liberation. Nevertheless, this individual is unableto accept the unmistaken path to liberation, the path that is revealed by theteaching that no self exists, neither in the form of a person nor as aphenomenon. On this point, it is taught:> Venerable Subhūti, the Buddha is also like a dream, like an illusion. The> qualities of the Buddha are like a dream and like an illusion as well. Thus, the sūtras teach the existential negation of all constructs associatedwith the body of qualities, the field free from all adventitious stains.Likewise, they explain the appearance of form bodies that are delusions;illusory objects that are experienced by disciples with pure karma andaccomplish their welfare. What we have done here is to duly acknowledge themeaning of that teaching. There is, therefore, nothing reproachable in theabove. This is not a denigration.We have, however, pointed out that the self and the aggregates, as conceived ofby the opponent, are devoid of any nature. Therefore, one should not say thatthe Thus-Gone is, in reality, empty, nor should one claim that he is not. Oneought not say that he is both empty and not empty, nor hold that he is neither.And yet, all of these four statements are still to be applied in terms of theexpedient meaning, as conventional superimpositions that can guide those to beinfluenced toward reality. The purpose and intent with respect to that type ofteaching has already been explained in the analysis of self and phenomena.The analysis of the person and the aggregates associated with the Thus-Gone alsoserves as a refutation of persons and aggregates in relation to sentient beings.The present examination, therefore, equally shows the untenability of allfourteen indeterminate views. It might be believed that the self or theaggregates existed in the past, that they did not exist in the past, that theyboth did and did not, or that neither of these was the case. Or it may bethought that they are somehow permanent, impermanent, and so on. Yet how couldthis be the case within this natural peace? In other words, how could this bethe case with respect to a Thus-Gone in whom both self and aggregates areprimordially pacified, in whom there are no such things? Indeed, it cannot.It might likewise be thought that the self or the aggregates will be presentagain in the future, that they will not, that they both will and will not, orthat neither is the case. Self and aggregates may thus be thought to be limited,limitless, both, or neither. Yet, how could any of these pertain to this naturalpacification of self and aggregates? How could this be the case with respect toa Thus-Gone in whom both have been pacified from the beginning, in whom there isneither self nor aggregates? Indeed, it cannot.The same goes for the third tetralemma, the four beliefs that concern whetherthe Thus-Gone exists subsequent to his passing. These four are also irrelevant.When he appears, one might mistakenly think that the Thus-Gone exists. Yet theone who apprehends in this way has been overcome by a vast and dense darknessthat obscures the path of transcendence, the witnessing of reality. Such aperson will also develop the mistaken thought that, upon his transcendence, thecontinuum of the Thus-Gone who was present before has now come to an end and nolonger exists.Alternatively, the meaning of the twelfth stanza can be appreciated byreformulating it like this: “One seized by the dense fixation that the Thus-Goneexists will think that, upon his transcendence, the Thus-Gone exists or does notexist.”As explained above, the Buddha is empty of nature from the very moment heappears. It would not make sense to think that, upon transcendence, this Buddhaexists as an entity, that he has disintegrated and become nothing, that he bothdoes and does not exist, or that he neither exists nor does not exist. None ofthese notions would be entertained, just as one does not conceive of the form ofa design made of space. Moreover, none of these ideas could pertain or beestablished with respect to a Thus-Gone who is natural pacification. Theseissues are, therefore, not determined, as is the case with questions concerningthe complexion of the child of a barren woman.The Flaws of ConstructionOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Those who create constructs about the Buddha,> Who is beyond construction and without exhaustion,> Are thereby damaged by their constructs;> They fail to see the Thus-Gone. [XXII.15] The Buddha is beyond all objects of verbal and conceptual construction. He isnot even established as something other than these; the Buddha is not theexhaustion, or cessation, of constructs that were there before and that have nowcome to an end. People may mistakenly think of the Buddha as empty or not empty,permanent or impermanent, omniscient or not omniscient, and so on, yet themental eye of those who create such verbal and mental constructs is damaged bytheir own constructions. Therefore, they all fail to see and attain that whichthey talk of—the Thus-Gone’s profound, vast, and perfect qualities. The NobleVajra Cutter teaches:> Those who see me as form,> Or know me as sound,> Have entered mistaken abandonment.> Such beings do not see me. > Behold the Buddhas as the intrinsic nature;> All the guides are the body of qualities.> The intrinsic nature is not an object of the mind;> It cannot be cognized. EXTENDING THIS ANALYSIS TO OTHER TOPICS Third, extending this analysis to other topics, the treatise states:> That which is the nature of the Thus-Gone> Is also the nature of this world.> There is no nature of the Thus-Gone.> There is no nature of the world. [XXII.16] It has been explained that all persons and phenomena associated with theThus-Gone are empty of nature. Thereby, it has also been shown that persons andphenomena as related to sentient beings are void. The same holds for the worldthat is their environment. Therefore, that which is the ultimate nature of theThus-Gone is also the nature of this world, meaning both beings and theirenvironment. Ultimately, the Thus-Gone has no natural establishment whatsoever,and that which, in perfect accordance with their wishes, appears to the deludedperception of disciples with pure karmic backgrounds is indeed established to befalse and like an illusion. Ultimately, this world of sentient beings and theirenvironment has no established nature at all. Its appearing, as it does to adeluded perspective, is established to be false and resembling an illusion. TheSūtra of the Ornament of Wisdom Light teaches:> Phenomena, always unarisen, are the Thus-Gone.> All phenomena are like the Thus-Gone.> Those of childish intellect grasp at marks,> And thus, within the worlds, perpetually relate to nonexistent phenomena. While Āryadeva explains:> While the Buddha is not born,> Aspirations that are causally linked> Make his magical appearances manifest. And:> The emptiness of one> Is the emptiness of all.186 This concludes the explanation of the twenty-second chapter, the analysis of theThus-Gone, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the MiddleWay.185. In this chapter the concluding summary is not explicit as a separatesection of the text.186. Āryadeva, Four Hundred Stanzas, VIII.16c–d."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF ERRORSECOND, THE NOTION that affliction is what causes the continuum of existencewill be refuted through the analysis of error. The three issues pertain to thischapter as well.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 23 First, we will discuss the chapter’s context. Its relation to the profoundsūtras can be found here, in the Mother of the Victorious Ones:> Desire, anger, and stupor are pure by nature. And in the King of Meditative Absorptions:> Those knowing the essence of desire, anger, stupor, and pride> To be the product of thought and mistaken engagement,> Do not relate to marks and do not become free from attachment.> Everything is the support of such meditators. The meaning of the sūtra’s teaching that there is no nature of affliction willhere be established through reasoning.Next, as for the chapter’s relation to the other analyses, the presentdiscussion can be seen as a reply to the following objection: “The Thus-Gone, asthe result of the continuum of existence, may have been refuted. Nevertheless,there is such a continuum, for it is taught:> As a condition, ignorance creates formation. This, in turn is the condition> for consciousness. As well as:> The condition of craving engenders becoming, and that condition leads to> birth. Thus, the continuum exists because affliction, its primary cause, exists.”This chapter was composed to explain that affliction as such lacksestablishment.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 23 Second, the explanation of the chapter’s content includes refutations of (1)affliction itself and (2) its proof, the pursuit of the method that eliminatesaffliction. The first section covers (1) a general refutation of the threepoisonous afflictions and (2) individual refutations of these three. The firstrefutation presents the following evidence: (1) dependent origination, (2)absence of support, (3) lack of cause, and (4) nonobservation.The Afflictions Originate DependentlyOn the first issue, the treatise states:> It is taught that desire, anger, and stupor> Originate in dependence on thought.> Their arising depends> On the attractive, unattractive, and mistaken. [XXIII.1] > That which originates in dependence> On the attractive, unattractive, and mistaken> Cannot be due to its own nature.> Hence, the afflictions are not real. [XXIII.2] The evidence, [that the three afflictions arise in dependence on thought,] canindeed be established through numerous types of conventional perception andinference. Nevertheless, in the present context, it is established for those ofour own tradition by referring to the Able One’s statements. The TranscendentConqueror taught that the primary afflictions—desire, anger, and stupor—alloriginate in dependence on thought, the mind’s apprehension of things. Thus, hestates:> Desire, I know your root;> You arise from thought.> I do not conceive of you,> So, for me, you do not arise. It is also specified that these three afflictions arise in dependence on objectswith features that are, respectively, attractive, unattractive, and mistaken (inthe sense of being contrary to fact). In other words, it is explained that thethree afflictions originate in dependence on a subject that apprehends things inthese three ways. Moreover, the features of the objects are also set forth bythought. For this reason, their origination is, in the end, established as beingdue to thought as well.Now, because they arise in dependence on features of objects that areattractive, unattractive, or mistaken—or because they arise in dependence on asubject that apprehends in these three ways—the three afflictions cannot be dueto their own nature. Hence, because they do not exist by their own nature, theseafflictions are not real. They are not natural. The entailment of this argumenthas already been elaborately explained in the analysis of nature and theanalysis of fire and fuel. While the former showed that the natural cannot bealtered and originate in dependence, the latter explained that what originatesin dependence cannot be natural.The Absence of SupportWe begin the treatment of the second issue with a general presentation.General PresentationOne stanza below, the treatise states:> The one to which the afflictions belong> Is not in any way established.> When they do not pertain to anything at all,> The afflictions cannot exist in any way either. [XXIII.4] As is the case with a painting on a wall or the ripening of a fruit, theafflictions must relate to some support. Yet no supportive basis to which theafflictions belong can be established in any way. There is no support other thanthe self or the mind, and both of these have no natural establishment.Therefore, when there is no support at all to which they could pertain, then thesupported, the afflictions, cannot exist by nature either, like the afflictionsof the child of a barren woman.One may then wonder: “Why would these two supports not be established?”What follows is a proof through reasoning. First is a refutation of the selfbeing the support.Refutation of the Self as SupportThe treatise states:> The existence or nonexistence of the self> Is not established in any way.> How can the existence or nonexistence> Of the afflictions be established without it? [XXIII.3] Upon examination, we find that both the existence of a self in the form of aperson, as well as the nonexistence, or negation, of such a self, cannot beestablished in any way. Both have already been refuted. It was, for example,explained:> That which does not exist> Before, together with, or after sight and the rest> Will no longer be thought about> As existent or nonexistent.187 Thus, given that their support is absent, how could the existence, or thenegation of the existence, of the supported afflictions be established in anyway?Refutation of the Mind as SupportSecond follows a refutation of the notion that the mind is the support of theafflictions. Sūtra Followers and Proponents of Mind Only will argue: “While itis indeed true that there is no support in the form of a self, the arising ofafflictions is supported by the afflicted mind. Moreover, the mind arisestogether with the afflictions, for it is said, ‘Those that arise together arethe effect of each other.’”188The refutation of this idea will be explained by showing (1) how a support inthe form of the afflicted mind cannot be established since it does not relate tothe afflictions in any of the five ways and (2) how, as an aside, theafflictions are not established either since they do not relate to the afflictedin any of the five ways.The Mind Does Not Relate to the AfflictionsOn the first issue, the treatise states:> As in the case of the view of one’s body,> The afflicted is absent in the afflictions in five ways. [XXIII.5c–d] The view of self can be based on the aggregates of one’s body, yet the self thatis believed in does not exist in relation to the physical aggregates in any ofthe five ways. The same holds for the mind that is afflicted and the afflictionsthat afflict it: The afflicted mind (1) is not identical with the afflictions,(2) is not different from them, (3) does not support them, (4) is not supportedby them, and (5) does not possess the afflictions. If they were identical,object and agent would be the same, and if they were different, the afflictedmind could be present in the absence of afflictions. If this were the case, afoe-destroyer’s mind could be afflicted. Moreover, since they are notestablished as essentially different, they cannot reasonably relate to eachother as support and something supported. Finally, because they are neitheridentical nor different, it does not make sense to speak of possession, eitherin the sense of identity or as a relationship between different things.The Afflictions Do Not Relate to the MindOn the second issue, the treatise states:> As in the case of the view regarding one’s body,> The afflictions are absent in the afflicted in five ways. [XXIII.5a–b] The view of the self may be based on the physical aggregates, yet no such selfexists with respect to the aggregates in any of the five ways. In the same way,the afflictions that afflict the mind do not exist in relation to the afflictedmind in any of these five ways either—not by being identical with it, differentfrom it, possessing it, supporting it, or being supported by it. In the firstcase, object and agent would be the same, and in the second there could beafflictions without something that is afflicted, in which case there would beaffliction without any support. The third option is impossible given thatafflictions and mind are neither identical nor different, and the fourth andfifth must be excluded because the two are not essentially different.The Lack of CauseOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If the attractive, unattractive, and mistaken> Are not due to their own nature,> Then what are those afflictions that depend> On the attractive, unattractive, and mistaken? [XXIII.6] As explained above, these afflictions originate in dependence on the attractive,unattractive, and mistaken. Yet because they originate dependently, and becausethey cease and become nothing, the attractive, unattractive, and mistaken do notexist by their own nature. What, then, are those afflictions that depend on theattractive, unattractive, and mistaken as their causes? As it is taught:> When the seed of something is false,> How could its arising be true?189 Hence, as they arise from false causes, the afflictions do not exist by nature.Nonobservation as EvidenceOn the fourth issue, the treatise states:> Form, sound, taste, tactility, smell,> And phenomena—these six> Are believed to be the bases> For desire, anger, and stupor. [XXIII.7] > Form, sound, taste, tactility, smell,> And phenomena are all without exception> Like a city of scent-eaters,> Like an optical illusion, like a dream. [XXIII.8] It might be argued that the afflictions can be established by virtue of theexistence of their bases, or foci. Indeed, some may believe that form, sound,taste, tactility, smell, and phenomena are the bases for desire, anger, andstupor. Nevertheless, form, sound, taste, tactility, smell, and phenomena areall, without exception, merely imaginary and devoid of reality. The afflictionsthat have such focal points are, therefore, also without any nature, likeafflictions that focus on the child of a barren woman.One may then wonder: “How can they appear if they have no nature?”Like a city of scent-eaters, an optical illusion, or a dream, they appear theway they do to the deluded mind. They are, therefore, false and have no nature.Individual Refutations of the Three Poisonous afflictionsNext, the refutations of the individual afflictions include (1) a refutation ofdesire and anger and (2) a refutation of stupor. The first of these includes (1)a refutation of the cause, the attractive and the unattractive and (2) aninvalidation of the result. The first of these sections is again divided intorefutations with reference to (1) the false character of the support and (2)their mutual dependence.The False Character of the SupportOn the first issue, the treatise states:> They resemble an illusory person> And are similar to reflections.> How could there be any real element> Of the attractive or unattractive in them? [XXIII.9] Form and the other [purported] supports [for the arising of affliction] arefalse and have no nature. In this way, they resemble an illusory person or areflection. How could they contain any actual element, any real thing (sinceboth “element” and “thing” are among the meanings of the Sanskrit bhava), thathas attractive or unattractive features? Indeed, there are no real attractive orunattractive entities.Mutual DependenceAs for the second issue, first the attractive will be refuted.Refutation of the AttractiveThe treatise states:> The unattractive upon which> The designation “attractive” depends> Does not exist independently of the attractive.> Hence, the attractive does not make sense. [XXIII.10] Let us assume that there are things, such as a silver vase, that are attractivein every way. Would this vase then be attractive independent of things that areunattractive? This could not be because it would then remain attractive whencompared to a vase of gold. If the alternative is the case, its being attractiveis dependent on there being something unattractive, perhaps a copper vase. Yetthe unattractive copper vase, upon which the silver vase’s designation, orclassification, as “attractive” depends, does not exist independently of theattractive silver vase itself. If the copper vase were by nature unattractive,it would also be unattractive in comparison to a clay vase. Hence, because thatupon which it depends is not established prior to itself, a dependentattractiveness does not make any sense either.Refutation of the UnattractiveSecond, refuting the unattractive, the treatise states:> The attractive upon which> The designation “unattractive” depends> Does not exist independently of the unattractive.> Hence, the unattractive does not make sense. [XXIII.11] If there are unattractive things, such as a copper vase, is the existence ofthese things independent of things that are attractive or dependent on them?Unattractive things are not independently unattractive, for then the copper vasewould still be unattractive when compared to a clay vase. If, however, theopposite is the case, then the attractive silver vase, for example, upon whichthe copper vase’s designation and classification as “unattractive” depends, doesitself not exist independently of the unattractive copper vase either. If itwere attractive by its very essence, its being compared to a gold vase wouldmake no difference. Hence, because the attractiveness upon which it depends isnot established prior to itself, a dependent unattractiveness does not make anysense either.Invalidation of the ResultOn the second issue, the treatise states:> When there is nothing attractive,> How could there possibly be desire?> When there is nothing unattractive,> How could there possibly be anger? [XXIII.12] When, in this way, there are no attractive objects, how could there possibly beany natural existence of desire, which is a result of such objects? Likewise,when its cause, the unattractive, does not exist, how could there possibly beany real occurrence of the resultant anger?Refutation of StuporNext, stupor will be refuted by showing that its cause, error, lacksestablishment. This includes (1) a refutation of the mistaken and (2) the resultof this refutation. The first section itself includes (1) a refutation of thedistinction between the mistaken and the unmistaken and (2) a refutation of theperson involved in the apprehension of these. The first of these will show that(1) the mistaken and the unmistaken are equally devoid of objectiveestablishment, (2) whether objective or not, the mistaken and the unmistaken areequal, and (3) even mere apprehension is not established. The first of theseissues will explain that (1) if error occurs when apprehending in a way that iscontrary to the way things are, apprehending things to be permanent cannot be inerror and (2) if error occurs when the apprehension does not accord with fact,apprehending things to be impermanent cannot be correct.Apprehending Permanence Would Not Be in ErrorOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If thinking the impermanent> To be permanent is an error,> Then why, since the empty is not impermanent,> Would that thought be in error? [XXIII.13] Generally, the five aggregates may be seen to be impermanent since theydisintegrate from one moment to the next; painful, as they are injured by thatvery impermanence; unclean, since the body is full of the thirty-two uncleansubstances; and selfless, because the aggregates are empty of a self, whethersuch a self is thought to be identical with or different from them. One might,therefore, argue that thinking these aggregates to be permanent, delightful,clean, and associated with a self is in error.On that argument, would the term “error,” then be applicable because theaggregates are apprehended to be permanent and so forth, while in fact they areimpermanent, painful, and so on? Or, alternatively, would it be an error tothink of them as permanent and so on because they are in fact not permanent andso on? If our criterion for classifying the thought of permanence as error is ofthe first kind, that is, if the error is in terms of thinking the impermanent tobe permanent, we may consider the reverse entailment, and so ask whyapprehending the subject, the aggregates, as permanent would be an error.Indeed, it would not be an error because the aggregates that are empty by naturedo not feature any actual impermanence. By substitution, we can make the sameargument with respect to the remaining three thoughts. Thus, for example, weget:> If thinking the painful> To be delightful is in error,> Then why, since the empty is not painful,> Would that thought be in error? Apprehending Impermanence Is Not CorrectOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If thinking that which is not permanent> To be permanent is an error,> Then why would thinking the empty> To be impermanent not also be in error? [XXIII.14] If the criterion for error is of the second kind, apprehending permanence wouldthen be wrong because the object of our concern does not contain anythingpermanent. With this understanding of error, we may then consider the genuinepervasion, and so ask why thinking the subject, the aggregates, to beimpermanent would not also be a mistake. Indeed, it would be a mistake becausethe naturally empty aggregates do not feature any of the impermanence that isascribed to them either. Again, the same is applicable to the remaining threethoughts. Thus, for example, we get:> If thinking that which is not delightful> To be delightful is in error,> Then why would thinking the empty> To be painful not also be in error? If these arguments are accepted, nothing is correct. Since error is dependent onthe correct, there can then not be any error either.Whether Objective or Not, the Mistaken and Unmistaken Are EqualFurther below, the treatise discusses the second issue:> If there is a self, something clean,> Something permanent, and something delightful,> The apprehending of self, clean, permanent, and delightful> Are not mistakes. [XXIII.21] > If there is no self, nothing clean,> Nothing permanent, and nothing delightful,> There cannot be any absence of self, anything unclean,> impermanent, and painful. [XXIII.22] If, in relation to the aggregates, there is a self, something clean, somethingpermanent, and something delightful, then neither the objects that areapprehended as having these features, nor the mind that apprehends the objectsaccordingly, can be considered mistaken and counterfactual.The alternative to this is that there is no self, nothing clean, nothingpermanent, and nothing delightful with respect to the aggregates, or thecognized objects. Yet not only would there then be an absence of these four, thenegative qualities of their negation—absence of self, unclean, impermanent, andpainful—would then also be nonexistent. Thus, the full set of eight qualitieswill be mistaken. If this is accepted, there is nothing that is correct, andsince the mistaken depends on the correct, there is then nothing that ismistaken either. Hence, it is established that there can be neither any featuresof mistaken objects, nor any thoughts of a subject that is mistaken.Even Mere Apprehension Is Not EstablishedOn the third issue, the treatise states:> The means for apprehending, the apprehension,> That which apprehends, and what is apprehended> Are all completely pacified.> Hence, there is no apprehending. [XXIII.15] It may be objected: “Mistaken and unmistaken apprehension may have been refuted,but the mere act of apprehending has not. Therefore, apprehension exists. This,in turn, means that those factors that establish the existence ofapprehension—agent, action, and object—exist as well. Our position is,therefore, established.”This is not so. The means for apprehending, such as mistaken judgments; the actof apprehending; the self, or the mind, that apprehends; and the objects thatare apprehended thereby, such as form—all of these have been proven to be falsethrough the general refutation of arising in the analysis of conditions. Theyhave also been refuted individually. Thus, we may recall the thirteenth, third,fifth, and eighth stanzas of the present chapter, respectively. Hence, since allof these are completely pacified, there is no such thing as mere apprehensioneither. In turn, it is then established that there are no mistaken or unmistakenways of apprehending.Refutation of the Apprehending PersonThe second issue will include (1) a general refutation of the person as amistaken or unmistaken apprehender and (2) a specific refutation of the personwhose apprehension is mistaken.General RefutationOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Given that there is neither mistaken> Nor unmistaken apprehension,> Who could be in error?> Who could be correct? [XXIII.16] It may be thought: “The mistaken and the unmistaken do exist because there is aperson who has these qualities, or who may apprehend in such ways.”Yet this objection does not hold either. The nonexistence of mere apprehensionprecludes the existence of mistaken and unmistaken ways of apprehending.Therefore, what person could be in error, and who is the person that is correct?There cannot be anyone to whom such qualities pertain.Specific Refutation of the Person Whose Apprehension Is MistakenThe second issue will be covered by showing (1) the impossibility of a mistakenperson with reference to the three types of support and (2) its lack of arisingin any of the three ways.The Three Types of SupportOn the first issue, the treatise states:> The mistaken cannot> Become mistaken,> Nor can the unmistaken> Become mistaken. [XXIII.17] > That which is becoming mistaken> Cannot become mistaken either.> Where is error possible?> Investigate that. [XXIII.18] Moreover, becoming mistaken is not possible with respect to an object, or for asupport, that is mistaken because becoming mistaken has already been completedthere, and because such mistakenness would be nonsensical. Nor are mistakespossible where there is no error because mistakes have yet to occur there, andbeing and not being mistaken are, moreover, contradictory. Finally, mistakes arealso impossible with respect to that which is becoming mistaken because there isno “that which is becoming mistaken” apart from that which either is or is notmistaken. Such a thing could not involve two actions either. Therefore, withrespect to which object, or for what support (that is, for what person) is errorpossible? Let us investigate that with an honest mind. We shall then see thatthere is nothing that could be in error.The Absence of Arising in Any of the Three WaysOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Since they have not arisen,> How could there be errors?> Given that no error has occurred,> How could there be one that is mistaken? [XXIII.19] > Things do not arise from themselves,> Nor do they arise from anything else.> As things do not arise from self and other either,> How could there be one that is mistaken? [XXIII.20] Also, how could there be errors, when none have arisen? Given that there are noerrors because no error has occurred, how could there be one that is in error?It may be objected that the absence of arising of error has not been proven.Yet, as it is taught:> Things do not arise from themselves> Nor do they arise from anything else.> As things do not arise from self and other either,> How could there be one that is mistaken? The meaning of this statement has already been explained.The Results of RefutationIn this way, error has been refuted. Third follows a treatment of the results ofthis refutation, this examination of error. The treatise states:> As error in this way ceases,> Ignorance comes to an end.> As ignorance ceases,> Formations and so forth end. [XXIII.23] When examined in this way, error cannot be found. Hence, the relative erroneousapprehension ceases. Thereby, its result, ignorance, comes to an end relativelyas well. As causal ignorance ceases, its results end as well. Hence, all thatpertains to the relative accumulation of suffering that we have been immersed insince beginningless time—from formation up to and including aging and death—isbrought to an end without exception. This, therefore, is deeply significant.REFUTATION OF AN ARGUMENT Subsequent to the refutation of the afflictions, it is refuted that the remedy,the pursuit of the means for eliminating the afflictions, can serve as a prooffor the existence of afflictions. The treatise states:> If someone’s afflictions> Are existent by nature,> How can they be eliminated?> Who can eliminate the existent? [XXIII.24] > If someone’s afflictions> Are nonexistent by nature,> How can they be eliminated?> Who can eliminate the nonexistent? [XXIII.25] It may be argued: “The remedy that eliminates ignorance and other such factorsdoes exist. Therefore, the afflictions exist as well. Something like the sproutof a sky mango cannot be eliminated by a remedy.”Nevertheless, upon examination we will see that there is no such thing aselimination by means of a remedy either. If this were to take place, would itrelate to something existent or to something nonexistent? If a person’s desireand other afflictions were existent by nature, how could they be eliminated? Itis entailed that they could not because who can eliminate something that existsby nature? That is just as impossible as the elimination of the nonresistantquality of space.Next, if somebody’s desire and other afflictions were nonexistent by nature, howcould they be eliminated in reality? It is entailed that they could not beeliminated because who can eliminate that which by nature is nonexistent? Likethe coolness of fire, what by nature is nonexistent does not need to beeliminated.It might then be argued: “The aforementioned examination leads to the statement,‘As error in this way ceases, ignorance comes to an end.’ If the afflictionscannot be eliminated, as just argued, why would this statement not now have beencontradicted?”Although they have no nature, adventitious stains that resemble a tarnish ongold can, from the unexamined perspective, be eliminated by a remedy. Therefore,there is no such contradiction. If one is imprisoned in a dream, one will befreed by understanding that it is not true. Similarly, understanding that bothdiscard and remedy have no existence is itself the remedy that eliminates therelative afflictions. A sūtra explains:> Ignorance and all that arises by this condition> Never know any existence.> Ignorance and the world of ignorance do not exist;> For this reason, have I spoken of ignorance. And likewise:> Mañjuśrī, stupor is perfect freedom. Therefore, it is termed “stupor.” Also the Master himself teaches:> Here there is nothing whatsoever to exclude,> And not a bit to maintain.> Look, genuinely into the genuine—> When the genuine is seen, there is total liberation.190 This concludes the explanation of the twenty-third chapter, the analysis oferror, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.187. Root of the Middle Way, IX.12.188. Vasubandhu, Treasury of Abhidharma, II.50b.189. Nāgārjuna, Jewel Garland, I.29.190. Nāgārjuna, Heart of Dependent Origination, 7."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE NOBLE TRUTHSSHOWING THE NATURE of dependent origination to be emptiness includes twochapters, of which the first is the analysis of the noble truths. The threeissues pertain to this chapter as well.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 24 First, as for the chapter’s context, its relation to the teaching of theprofound sūtras can be seen from the following statement from the Mother of theVictorious Ones:> There is no suffering, origin, cessation, or path. Elsewhere, a sūtra teaches:> Monks, the sacred truth is one; it is the subject that does not deceive, the> transcendence of suffering. Thus, the sūtras teach that the four truths have no nature. The meaning of suchteachings will here be established through reasoning.As for its relation to the other analyses in the text, the present chapter wascomposed to avert the following criticism: “If all phenomena are emptiness, itfollows that the four noble truths and other such principles are nonexistent aswell.”THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 24 Second, the explanation of this chapter’s content includes (1) an objection and(2) a reply. The objection is presented in five sections, of which the firstsets forth the consequence that the topics to be understood, the four nobletruths, would become untrue.The Four Truths Would Become UntrueThe treatise states:> If all of this were empty,> Nothing would arise or be destroyed.> For you it follows that> There are no four noble truths. [XXIV.1] Here the opponent argues: “If all outer and inner things were the essence ofemptiness, everything would be just like space. Nothing could then arise anddevelop, just as nothing could be destroyed. Given this complete nonexistence,it would follow that, for the proponent of emptiness, there are no four nobletruths either.“The aggregates produced by past actions and afflictions are constantly injuredby the three forms of suffering associated with suffering, change, andformation, and so they do not befit the noble. For this reason, and because thispainful nature of the aggregates is a truth from the perspective of the nobleones who have abandoned error, the aggregates are referred to as ‘the nobletruth of suffering.’“Thus,” the opponent argues, “the truth of suffering is something that by naturearises and disintegrates. There could not, therefore, be any such thingaccording to your position. Moreover, if there is no resultant suffering therecould not be any causal action and affliction either, and so there could not beany origin of suffering. In turn, this means that there could not be anycessation of suffering and its causes, nor could there be a path that leads tothis cessation. In other words, the eightfold noble path and so forth would benonexistent as well.”The Four Types of Wakefulness Would Become NonexistentThe second section sets forth the consequence that the four types of pathwakefulness, as associated with the subject, would become nonexistent. Thetreatise states:> Since there are no four noble truths,> Complete understanding and elimination,> As well as familiarization and actualization,> Do not make any sense. [XXIV.2] If, in this way, there are no four noble truths, the complete understanding ofsuffering through its qualities of impermanence, and so forth, the eliminationof the origin of suffering, familiarization with the path, and the actualizationof the cessation will not make any sense either.The Three Jewels Would Become NonexistentThe third issue is the consequence that the resultant three jewels would becomenonexistent. First it is argued that there would be no Sangha.There Would Be No SanghaThe treatise states:> Without these,> The four fruitions do not exist either.> Without fruition, there is no one abiding in that,> Nor anyone who has gained entry. [XXIV.3] > If the eight persons do not exist,> Then there is no Sangha. [XXIV.4a–b] Since there is no understanding of suffering and so forth, there cannot be anycultivation of the path, nor any attainment that results from this cultivation.The subtle developers that are to be eliminated through seeing can then not beovercome. Likewise, there could be no elimination of the sets of nine greater,middling, and lesser subtle developers that pertain to each of the nine levelsof the three realms and that are eliminated through cultivation. Thus, the fourfruitions associated with the stream-enterer, once-returner, nonreturner, andfoe-destroyer cannot exist either. None of these four fruitions would bepossible because they ensue from the elimination of those subtle developers. Thefruition of the stream-enterer involves the elimination of subtle developers [upto] the lesser of the middling factors associated with the experience of therealm of desire. The fruition of the foe-destroyer’s stage ensues finally fromthe elimination of the lesser of the lesser afflictions that are associated withthe summit of existence.If none of these fruitions exist, there cannot be anyone who, on the paths ofliberation, abides within the fruitions of having eliminated that which is to beeliminated. Nor can there be anyone who has gained entry into any of these fourfruitions. In other words, there cannot be anyone who abides in their causes,the paths of no impediment and the preparatory stages.We may here elaborate slightly on the meaning of the above. The Abhidharmateaches:> Fifteen instants are the seeing of that which was not seen.> Hence, these are the path of seeing.> The sixteenth is the abidance within its fruition.191 Thus, according to the approach of the Lesser Vehicle, sixteen instants arise insuccession. These instants are related to the understanding of the properties ofthe four truths. They are, thus, enumerated as instants of the acceptance ofunderstanding, understanding, the acceptance of subsequent understanding, andsubsequent understanding with respect to the properties of each of the fourtruths. The first fifteen instants constitute the entry into the first fruition,and the sixteenth is the abidance within that.Let us consider each of them individually. The first is acceptance of theunderstanding of the properties of suffering. Here, one observes the truth ofsuffering as it pertains to the realm of desire. Doing so, one sees it ascharacterized by impermanence, since [the aggregates] disintegrate from onemoment to the next; suffering, because of the injuries that are sustained;emptiness, since no extraneous self is involved; and absence of self, becausethe essence [of the aggregates] does not constitute a self. This understandingeliminates a set of ten subtle developers that are associated with realm ofdesire.These are referred to as “discards through seeing suffering.” There is one suchdiscard for each of the following ten afflictions: the view of the transitorycollection, extreme views, distorted views, belief in the supremacy of one’sview, belief in the supremacy of one’s discipline and ritual, desire, anger,pride, ignorance, and doubt. Thus, the acceptance of the understanding of theproperties of suffering is the path without impediment that pertains to theelimination of these ten.Next, the understanding of the properties of sufferingis the path of liberationupon which the aforementioned ten subtle developers have been eliminated bythese very observations. Among these ten, there are five that are directmistaken engagements with the truth of suffering, four that are mistakenengagements with error, and one that is a mistaken engagement due to error. Thefirst category includes ignorance, doubt, view of the transient collection,extreme view, and distorted view. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of thecharacteristic impermanence and other features that pertain to the fiveaggregates of the truth of suffering. Doubt is to harbor uncertainty about thesecharacteristics. The view of the transitory collection is to regard theaggregates as if they included a self and something that belongs to it, while infact they are devoid of these two. Extreme view is to regard the identity of theaggregates as construed by the view of the transitory collection, and so believethat the self is either permanent or annihilated. Distorted view is to denigratethe truth of suffering, denying the existence of karmic consequences and soforth even in terms of the relative. Respectively, these afflictions are directmistaken engagements by virtue of not realizing, harboring doubts about, andmisunderstanding the characteristics of the truth of suffering. Each of theseafflictions is caused by the previous factor.The category of mistaken engagement with error includes belief in the supremacyof view, belief in the supremacy of discipline and ritual, desire, and pride.All of these are mistaken engagements with the previous three views. Thus,belief in the supremacy of view is when, contrary to what is the case, thesethree are seen as the foremost and supreme teachings that are in accord with theactual nature of things. Likewise, whereas the causes of purification andliberation cannot be found in these three views, belief in the supremacy ofdiscipline and ritual is when it is thought that, in fact, those three viewscontain such causes. As for desire and pride, the attachment to objects and thepride that ensues from that are both mistaken engagements that relate directlyto the aggregates, yet such desire and pride is to be eliminated through thepath of cultivation. In the present context, attachment refers to difficulty inrenouncing these views, whereas pride is the arrogance that ensues from them.Thus, these two afflictions are mistaken engagement with error.Finally, anger is mistaken engagement that is due to error. Though anger at anobject is direct mistaken engagement, such anger is eliminated on the path ofcultivation. In the present context, anger is of the type that specificallyarises due to the three views mentioned above. It is the particular aggressionthat arises with respect to other views, once the above views have been assumedto be supreme or the cause of purification and liberation.Taking into account the enmity that is directed toward the Dharma, there may aswell be anger as a mistaken engagement that relates directly to the path andcessation. While in the two higher realms there is no anger, the otherafflictions can be present in the same way as already described.Acceptance of the subsequent understanding of suffering is the path withoutimpediment upon which the eighteen subtle developers that are associated withthe two higher realms are eliminated. On this path, one observes the truth ofsuffering of the two higher realms in terms of the features of impermanence andso forth. There is a set of nine subtle developers for each of these two realms.With the exception that anger, which is absent in the higher realms, is notamong them, the eliminated afflictions are otherwise the same as before.Subsequent understanding of suffering is then the path of liberation upon whichthe aforementioned observations have eliminated these eighteen subtledevelopers.Next are the four types of wakefulness that relate to the truth of the origin.Acceptance of the understanding of the properties of the origin is when oneobserves the truth of the origin that pertains to the realm of desire, and sosees that it displays the following features: cause, since what one perceivesare the seeds that produce suffering; origination, because this production ismanifold; full arising, as the production is intense; and condition, since theproduction is continuous. It is taught that as for suffering and the others:> There are respectively ten, seven, seven, and eight.192 Thus, there are seven subtle developers that are eliminated through seeing theintrinsic nature of the origin in the context of the realm of desire. Theseseven afflictions are the above set of ten, minus the view of the transitorycollection, extreme views, and the belief in the supremacy of discipline andritual. Acceptance of the understanding of the properties of the originconstitutes the path without impediment upon which these seven are eliminated.Understanding of the properties of the origin is the path of liberation uponwhich the seven have been eliminated by means of the described observations.Acceptance of the subsequent understanding of the origin is when the sameobservations are made with respect to the truth of the origin as it pertains tothe form and formless realms. This a path without impediment upon which oneeliminates six subtle developers for each of the two higher realms. These sixare the same as the seven referred to above, with the exception that there is noanger associated with the higher realms. In sum, there are, thus, twelve subtledevelopers associated with the higher realms that are eliminated through seeingthe intrinsic nature of the origin.Subsequent understanding of the origin is then the path of liberation upon whichthese twelve have been eliminated by means of the aforementioned observations.What follows are the four types of wakefulness related to cessation. Acceptanceof the understanding of the properties of cessation observes the cessation ofsuffering in the context of the realm of desire in terms of the followingfeatures: cessation, as afflictions cease; peace, as the fire of the afflictionsis extinguished; excellence, since the blemish of the origin is absent; anddefinitive emergence, since this emerges as the source of permanent benefit.Acceptance of the understanding of the properties of cessation is a path withoutimpediment that eliminates seven subtle developers associated with the realm ofdesire. These seven afflictions discarded through seeing the intrinsic nature ofcessation are of the same kind as those eliminated through seeing the origin ofsuffering in the desire realm.Understanding of the properties of cessation is the path of liberation uponwhich these seven have been eliminated by the above observations.Acceptance of the subsequent understanding of cessation is when the cessation ofsuffering in the two higher realms is observed in terms of the aforementionedfeatures. Thus, this constitutes the path without impediment that eliminatestwelve subtle developers—six for each of the realms—that are associated with theexperience of the form and formless realms. Except for the absence of anger, theeliminated afflictions are here the same as before.Subsequent understanding of cessation is the path of liberation upon which thedescribed observations have eliminated these twelve.Finally, four types of wakefulness that are associated with the path willmanifest. Acceptance of the understanding of the properties of the path occursby observing the path that ends suffering within the desire realm in terms ofthe following features: path, since this leads to the city of liberation;practice, because through it the mind is freed from error; reason, since thisremedies affliction; and the granting of definitive emergence, because it grantsthe definitive emergence of the source of lasting benefit. The observation ofthese features constitutes a path without impediment upon which eight subtledevelopers are eliminated. These eight afflictions—the ones that are eliminatedthrough seeing the intrinsic nature of the path in relation to the desirerealm—consist of the same as before, with the addition of the belief in thesupremacy of discipline and ritual.Understanding of the properties of the path is then the path of liberation uponwhich these eight have been eliminated by means of the aforementionedobservations.Acceptance of the subsequent understanding of the path is the path withoutimpediment upon which the path that ends suffering within the two higher realmsis observed in terms of the aforementioned features. This perception of theintrinsic nature of the path causes the elimination of fourteen subtledevelopers, seven for each of the realms. These afflictions are of the same typeas before, with the exception that in the higher realms there is no anger to beeliminated. These fifteen instants193 of wakefulness are known as “the path ofseeing,” and because one enters in order to actualize the fruition of a noblestream-enterer, this is also referred to as the stage of “entry” into that.The sixteenth instant is the subsequent understanding of the path, thewakefulness that is the path of liberation upon which the previous observationshave eliminated the aforementioned fourteen subtle developers. Abidance withinthe fruition of a stream-enterer begins with this moment, and it continuesthrough the elimination of the fifth discard by means of cultivation that isassociated with the realm of desire. This is the stage of the attainment of theeightfold cognition within the elimination of the complete set of theaforementioned eighty-eight subtle developers that are to be discarded throughseeing. These eighty-eight discards are all ways of relating to the truths bymeans of imputation. This is why they are eliminated, independent of any processof familiarization, precisely through the perception of the intrinsic nature ofthe truths. This, in turn, is the reason that they are classified as “discardsthrough seeing.” These do not just consist of temporary thought patterns thatare due to the influence of negative company and destructive philosophicalsystems. They also include mental states that are associated with such thoughtpatterns, as well as some that are their seeds.According to the Abhidharma of the Great Vehicle, there are, as is the case inthe context of seeing the truth of suffering, also twenty-eight subtledevelopers to be eliminated through seeing each of the remaining three truths.Thus, a total of 112 discards through seeing are identified. The truths of theorigin, cessation, and path are, respectively, seen to be the causal fiveaggregates, the intrinsic nature free from any number of stains, and the insightthat realizes the intrinsic nature, including the aggregates that belong to thesame collection. Each one of the four truths is, hence, mistakenly engaged withby means of the ten afflictions associated with the experience of the desirerealm, as well as nine further afflictions for each of the two higher realms.Here, in the context of the Lesser Vehicle, the truth of the origin isconsidered action and affliction, cessation is the cessation of the continuum ofthe aggregates, and the paths of seeing and cultivation are the path. Thesetruths, therefore, cannot be mistakenly engaged through the view of thetransitory collection or through extreme views. They cannot be so engagedbecause, while the view of the transitory collection consists of apprehendingthe aggregates to be a self and something that belongs to it, none of these[three truths] are exactly the characteristics of the five aggregates, andextreme views will follow [only] where there is a presence of the view of thetransient collection. It is also explained that since the perception of theempty and selfless features of the truth of suffering are incompatible with theaforementioned two views and the belief in the supremacy of discipline andritual, these three afflictions are eliminated through the perception of thattruth. But since cause and the other features that pertain to the remainingthree truths are not incompatible with these three afflictions, the perceptionof these truths does not eliminate them. As for the specific belief in thesupremacy of discipline and ritual, this affliction is incompatible with theperception of the path and the other features that pertain to the truth of thepath. Hence, it is classified as a discard through seeing the truth of the path.The Great Vehicle, on the other hand, explains that cause and the other featuresof the truths of the origin, cessation, and path are all seen to resemble anillusion. The perception of the intrinsic nature of these truths is, therefore,equally incompatible with the view of the transitory collection, extreme views,and belief in the supremacy of discipline and ritual. Hence, these threeafflictions are eliminated by the perception of those three truths as well.Further afflictions are eliminated through cultivation. According to the LesserVehicle, there are four such discards through cultivation that are associatedwith the experience of the realm of desire. These are innate desire, anger,pride, and ignorance. With the exception of anger being absent, a similar set ofemotions is associated with the experience of both the form and formless realms.Thus, there are ten subtle developers in all that are discarded throughcultivation.These ten are then further understood in relation to nine levels: (1) theunsettled mind of the desire realm, (2–5) the four levels of concentration, and(6–9) the four levels of the formless realm. For each of these nine levels, ninestages are further distinguished with reference to nine levels of affliction,beginning with the greater of the greater afflictions, and continuing through tothe lesser of the lesser ones. Thus, by multiplication, we arrive at eighty-one[levels of affliction that are to be eliminated in the context of the path ofcultivation].Entry into the fruition of a once-returner is when the first five [of the ninelevels of ] affliction that are associated with the desire realm have beenexhausted, and one thus abides on the preparatory stage and the path withoutimpediment that are associated with the elimination of the sixth such discard.Abidance within the fruition of a once-returner begins when abiding within thewakefulness that is the path of liberation upon which all six have beeneliminated. This stage continues through the elimination of the eighth suchaffliction associated with the desire realm. The once-returner is so calledbecause of not having to return again to the world of humans or gods within thedesire realm. Having been born there, the once-returner will then either attainthe transcendence of suffering in that same life, or otherwise in a futureexistence. Thus, it is taught:> The one who has conquered through the fifth> Has entered into the second.194 As well as:> The one who has exhausted the sixth> Has become a once-returner.195 Moreover:> The exhaustion of eight flaws> Is entry into the third fruition,> The path without impediment that relates to the ninth.> The exhaustion of nine is the nonreturner.196 Thus, one who is entering into [the fruition of] a nonreturner abides on thepreparatory stage, or on the path without impediment, upon which the ninthaffliction of the desire realm is being relinquished, the first eight havingalready been exhausted. The nonreturner’s abiding in the fruition begins withthe path of liberation, where this ninth affliction has been eliminated, andcontinues through the elimination of the eighth affliction associated with thesummit of existence. A nonreturner does not return to the realm of desire butwill attain the transcendence of suffering either in the [last existence withinthat realm] or in a future life. Further, it is taught:> The exhaustion of eight obstacles related to the summit of existence> Is entry into the foe-destroyer.> The one who has exhausted nine is a foe-destroyer.197 Hence, entry into the [fruition of] a foe-destroyer takes place when the eighthaffliction related to the summit of existence has been exhausted and one abideson the preparatory stage and the path without impediment as associated with theelimination of the ninth. Abidance within the fruition of a foe-destroyer is theabidance within the wakefulness of the path of liberation upon which that ninthaffliction has been eliminated. The Sanskrit arhat means “destroyer of theenemy” as well as “worthy.” Hence, the foe-destroyer is the one for whom theafflictions of the three realms, the enemies that rob the bliss of transcendenceaway, have been conquered or, alternately, one who is a true object of offering,worthy of the worship of gods, humans, and so forth.The eight persons described here have all actualized the Dharma of realization.They are, therefore, unswerving in the face of demons, as well as suited to beobjects of veneration. They constitute the Sangha. Hence, it is argued, withoutthese eight persons, there would not be any Sangha. A sūtra, for example,teaches:> They are revered by Indra,> Royal ruler of the gods,> And by successful beings involved in agriculture,> The faithful who wish for merit and happiness,> All those who continuously engender> The merit that arises from substance.> They are explained to be, for them,> A field that when offered to> Yields vast and most excellent results.> They possess awareness and its supports,> And are the objects of worship, the great Sangha> Of the four that have gained entry> And the four that abide in fruition. According to the Great Vehicle, the afflictions eliminated through cultivationconsist of innate ignorance, the view of the transitory collection, extremeviews, desire, pride, and anger. The last of these is found only in theunsettled mind of the desire realm. It is, thus, absent from all eight levels ofequipoise. Anger is, therefore, not distinguishable with reference to thelevels, and so only a single ninefold set of greater, middling, and lesserafflictions obtains for that affliction. Each of the other five afflictions hasa distinct type for each of the nine levels (the unsettled mind of the desirerealm, the four levels of concentration, and the four levels of the formlessrealm). Each of these nine is again divided into nine by enumerating the greaterof the greater afflictions, and so forth, through to the lesser of the lesserones. Thus, there are eighty-one types for each of these five afflictions,leading to a total of number of 414 discards through cultivation.Nevertheless, in the present context of the Lesser Vehicle, the view of thetransitory collection and extreme views are not held to be included among thediscards through cultivation. The reason for this is that the Lesser Vehicledoes not accept any all-ground. Without the all-ground, there is no defiledmental cognition that observes it. This, in turn, means that there are no innateviews—neither the view of the transitory collection that accompanies the defiledmental cognition, nor the extreme views that follow from the view of thetransitory collection.There Would Be No DharmaThe next consequence is the absence of the Dharma. The treatise states:> Because there are no noble truths,> There is no sacred Dharma. [XXIV.4c–d] The nonexistence of the noble truths also entails the nonexistence of the sacredDharma, that is, the Dharma that sacred and noble individuals engage in, orwhich is sacred and supreme among all that is Dharma. The Dharma of realizationis freedom from attachment and that which leads to this freedom, that is, thecause and effect of complete purification. The Dharma of scripture, in turn,consists of the excellent discourses that reveal the former. Yet neither ofthese two aspects of the sacred Dharma can exist if there are no noble truths.There Would Be No BuddhaThere would be no Buddha either. The treatise states:> If there is no Dharma and no Sangha,> How could there be any Buddha? [XXIV.5a–b] In this way, if there is no Dharma in the form of a path to be practiced, and noSangha in the form of individuals who practice it, how could there be a resultof these two? How could there be a Buddha? Generally, if the Dharma exists, onecan pursue it in the correct way and eventually comprehend it fully andcompletely. Likewise, with the presence of the Sangha, one can accumulate meritby making offerings to its members, venerating them, and taking refuge in them,whereas by following their teachings one can accumulate wakefulness. In thisway, the presence of the Dharma and Sangha makes the gradual transformation intoa Buddha possible.Alternatively, the verses can be seen to be stating that Buddhahood follows fromthe correct pursuit of the Dharma by those members of the Sangha that werereferred to above. If the verses are understood in accordance with theintermediate teachings of the Common Vehicle, the term “Sangha” will refer tothe bodhisattvas that abide on the ten grounds. In that case, it becomesextremely clear that the absence of Buddhas would follow as a consequence.SummarySummarizing these three consequences, the treatise states:> This teaching of emptiness> Invalidates the three jewels. [XXIV.5c–d] The three jewels are held to display five qualities that resemble a jewel. Thus,it is explained:> Because they are rare, faultless,> Powerful, ornaments of the world,> And because they are supreme …198 It is also taught that they resemble a jewel in being rare and greatlybeneficial. The verses above argue that teaching all phenomena to be emptyinvalidates the three jewels since they are included under “all phenomena.”Thus, the teaching of emptiness renders these three jewels nonexistent.Actions Would Have No ConsequencesFourth, showing how actions would not have any consequences, the treatisestates:> Likewise, the existence of results,> Non-Dharma and Dharma, [XXIV.6a–b] The teaching that “everything is emptiness” also invalidates non-Dharma, such asthe ten nonvirtues, and the Dharma associated with the higher realms, such asthe ten virtues. Because they are also included in “everything,” the teaching ofuniversal emptiness invalidates these principles, as well as the existence oftheir painful and pleasant results.There Would Be No Mundane ConventionFifth, setting forth the consequence that mundane conventions would benonexistent, the treatise states:> And all the conventions of the world> Would likewise be invalidated thereby. [XXIV.6c–d] When it is said that that “everything is empty,” this also includes form,sensation, and so forth, as well as other conventions of the world, such as“make this,” “stay there,” and so forth. Hence, all mundane conventions areinvalidated as well. The claim that all phenomena are emptiness is, therefore,unreasonable.THE REPLY Subsequent to these objections follows the reply. This takes the form of adescription of (1) the reasons for the opponent’s objections, (2) the way theposition of the Middle Way does not incur the perceived flaws, and (3) thesupremacy of Middle Way realization.The Reasons for the Opponent’s ObjectionsOn the first issue, the treatise states:> To explain, you have not understood> The purpose of emptiness,> Emptiness itself, or its meaning.> Therefore this is damaging to you. [XXIV.7] The opponent has not understood what the approach of the Middle Way really is,which is why this criticism is presented. The stated flaws, therefore, are notdamaging to the Middle Way.How, then, is it that these flaws do not apply? If all phenomena are empty ofnature, it follows that none of them exists ultimately. Yet it does not followthat they do not exist even relatively. As has been stated:> We do not explain> Without accepting convention.199 Thus, the meaning of emptiness is not that nothing exists at all, evenconventionally. The opponent, however, apprehends marks of a negation inrelation to the meaning of emptiness, or understands it to imply that there isnothing at all, even in terms of convention.The purpose of the teaching and realization of emptiness is the attainment ofthe transcendence of suffering through the exhaustion of all mental constructs.The characteristics, or essence, of emptiness is the freedom, in reality, fromall constructions of existence and nonexistence, while its meaning, that is,that which the term “emptiness” explains and applies to, is dependentorigination. Failing to understand all of this, the opponent proclaims that theteaching of emptiness is flawed, in that it renders everything nonexistent evenat the level of convention. The perception of such flaws and damages, however,is the result of the opponent’s own mistaken concepts.Why These Flaws Are Not Applicable to the Middle WayThe second section (1) sets forth the approach of the Middle Way, (2) shows howit is free from flaws thereby, and (3) explains why denying the Middle Way wouldbe a mistake. The first of these points will address (1) the topics to beunderstood as taught by the Victorious One, (2) the flaws that occur when onefails to comprehend these, and (3) the conclusion.The Topics to Be Understood as Taught by the Victorious OneOn the first issue, the treatise states:> The Dharma taught by the Buddhas> Is genuinely based on the two truths:> The relative truth of the world> And the truth of the ultimate meaning. [XXIV.8] All of the teachings given by the Buddhas are genuinely, or definitively, basedon the two truths: the relative truth and ultimate truth. As implied by theSanskrit term, samvātisatya, the relative truth of the world is characterized bybeing something that obscures the perception of reality, and so is true as theobject of a conventional, deluded mind. All cognizable, expressible, andmeasurable phenomena are, thus, the bearers of this characteristic of therelative truth. The ultimate truth is characterized by being true as the objectof an ultimate mind and rational cognition. That which bears this characteristicis, thus, all phenomena, which, as the object of such a mind, do not abide asper any of the marks of constructed negation or affirmation.The Flaws of Failing to Comprehend the Two TruthsThe second issue as well is divided into three sections, the first of whichexplains the general flaw that follows from a lack of insight into the divisionof the two truths.The General Flaw of Not Understanding This DivisionOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Those who do not understand> The distinction between these two truths,> Fail to comprehend the profound reality> Of the Buddha’s teaching. [XXIV.9] From the perspective of the two minds referred to above, there is, respectively,appearance and the complete lack of any established nature. The division intotwo truths, thus, depends on these two mental perspectives. Those who do notunderstand this classification will harbor one-sided beliefs about existence andnonexistence. Hence, they will fail to comprehend the profound reality that isrevealed by the Buddha, the natural emptiness of dependent origination, freefrom all one-sided extremes of existence and nonexistence.Without Realization of the Ultimate, There Is No LiberationOn the particular flaw of failing to gain liberation because of not realizingthe ultimate, the treatise states:> Without relying on convention,> The ultimate cannot be shown.> Without realizing the ultimate,> Suffering cannot be transcended. [XXIV.10] It might be objected: “If, in this way, the ultimate is beyond all that can bespoken and conceived of, then the relative, deluded appearances of theaggregates and other such factors are all to be abandoned. Yet the Buddha hasnevertheless taught the existence of such things. Why would he do that?”Indeed, this objection is correct, but unless one relies on convention, it willnot be possible to realize the ultimate. And unless that is realized, there willbe no attainment of peace. Thus, just as one who wishes for water needs avessel, it is indeed necessary to teach the relative for there to be arealization of the ultimate. Without relying on convention, moreover, theultimate cannot be taught by any means, such as language and signs, because theessence of the ultimate itself lies beyond the sphere of language and mind.Moreover, unless the ultimate is taught through language and signs, theattachment to some sort of ultimate properties cannot be stopped, and so onewill not be able to realize it through an existential negation of all mentalconstructs. Finally, unless one realizes the ultimate truth, as it pertains toall phenomena, by means of an existential negation of mental constructs,suffering cannot be transcended with the elimination of all adventitious stains.Misunderstanding Emptiness Has Disastrous ConsequencesThe treatise states:> When viewing emptiness incorrectly,> Those with little insight will be ruined,> As when a snake is caught in the wrong way,> Or a knowledge mantra is used incorrectly. [XXIV.11] Feebleminded individuals who misunderstand emptiness will be ruined withincyclic existence and the lower realms. Unless the principles of these two truthsare acknowledged, the teaching of emptiness will make those with little insightbelieve either that emptiness means even conventional nonexistence, or otherwisethat nonexistence is the real condition. When emptiness is viewed incorrectly ineither of these ways, they will be ruined within cyclic existence and the lowerrealms.Those whose misunderstanding is of the first kind will adhere either to aliteral understanding of emptiness or abandon the teaching. When emptiness istaken in a literal sense, one develops a distorted view that depreciates karmicconsequences even at the level of the relative. Hence, one will go to the lowerrealms. As the Master himself explains:> As they misunderstand this Dharma,> Those who lack learning will let it go to waste.> Thus, they sink into the filth> Of the view of nonexistence.200 For others, the same misunderstanding will not lead to a denial [of karmiccausality], but rather to thoughts of the following kind: “I can observe allthese phenomena, so how could they be emptiness? Emptiness is not the Dharma; itis not the teaching of our Teacher.”In abandoning this principle, such people commit the act of discarding theDharma and will go to the lower realms as a result. Hence, we find the followingstatement:> Otherwise, misunderstanding this Dharma,> Fools who pride themselves on learning> Will abandon it and so, corrupted,> Fall head first into the hell of incessant pain.201 With the second type of misunderstanding, one believes that the real conditionis one of nonexistence. This is similar to taking medicine that, because onecannot digest it, turns into a poison. Emptiness is the remedy of all views, andyet here one develops a view about it, taking it to be a mark. Hence, it becomesimpossible to separate from all views, and so attain peace. This was explainedearlier in the treatise:> The Victorious Ones have taught emptiness> As a deliverance from all views.> For those whose view is emptiness, they say,> Nothing can be accomplished.202 It might then be thought: “That which is beneficial when understood correctlymay indeed not be beneficial when misunderstood, but why would suchmisunderstanding bring ruin and destruction?”For example, if one catches a snake or a nāga in the prescribed way, one canthereby acquire great wealth. But if, lacking the instructions, one catches itthe wrong way, one will not only miss out on the riches but also contractleprosy. Likewise, if one uses black magic or knowledge mantras in accordancewith certain instructions, one’s enemies will be crushed and one will oneself begranted attainments. But if one does not know these instructions and uses thespell incorrectly, it is oneself who will be crushed. Hence, misunderstandingcan be disastrous.ConclusionThird, in conclusion, the treatise states:> Hence, knowing that the depth of this Dharma> Would be hard for the feebleminded to understand,> The realized mind of the Able One> Turned entirely away from teaching the Dharma. [XXIV.12] The meaning of emptiness is profound and hard to realize. Disciples of inferiorcapacity will misunderstand it, and when they do, the negative consequences aresevere. Hence, knowing that the depth of the Dharma of emptiness would be hardto understand for the feebleminded, the realized mind of the Able One turnedentirely away from teaching the Dharma. Thus, he spoke:> Profound, peaceful, stainless, luminous, and unconditioned> Is this nectarlike Dharma I have found.> Since if I teach it, no one will understand,> I shall remain silent in the forest.203 How the Middle Way Is Free of FlawsHaving set forth the approach of the Middle Way, it will next be shown that theMiddle Way does not incur any flaw. This will include (1) showing that the basisfor the flaws is not accepted, (2) presenting the bases for flaws and benefits,and (3) showing how the criticism is, therefore, unreasonable.The Basis for the Flaws Is Not Accepted by the Middle WayOn the first issue, the treatise states:> The flaws that ensue in consequence> Are not reasonable with respect to emptiness.> Hence, your discarding emptiness> Is not reasonable to me. [XXIV.13] The opponent presented flaws in the form of the conventional nonexistence of thefour noble truths and so on, which were supposed to follow as consequences ofthe teaching of emptiness. None of these flaws, however, are reasonable, orapplicable, with respect to the natural emptiness that is taught by proponentsof the Middle Way. The opponent, on the other hand, discards this emptiness, forhe thinks of emptiness as implying either that nonexistence is real, orotherwise that nothing exists, even conventionally. That, the Master says, “isnot reasonable to me,” because that sort of emptiness is not what he accepts.The Bases for Flaws and BenefitsOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Everything is possible> For those for whom emptiness is possible.> Nothing is possible> For those for whom emptiness is impossible. [XXIV.14] > That which originates in dependence> Is taught to be emptiness.> This itself is dependent imputation> And so the path of the Middle Way. [XXIV.18] > Apart from what originates dependently,> There are no phenomena at all.> Therefore, apart from emptiness,> There are no phenomena at all. [XXIV.19] For the one for whom emptiness is possible, all conventional principles, such asthose pertaining to the four noble truths, will be possible as well. Below it isthen explained how that which originates in dependence is devoid of nature and,therefore, emptiness. A sūtra teaches:> All phenomena are empty, in the sense that they have no nature. And likewise:> What arises due to conditions does not arise;> It lacks the nature of arising.> What depends on conditions is taught to be empty;> Mindful is the one who knows emptiness.204 Natural emptiness is itself a conventional imputation based on causes andconditions. Hence, this illusion-like dependent origination, or the absence ofnature that is its intrinsic nature, is itself the path of the Middle Way beyondall extremes. Therefore, upon examination, one will see that there is nothingthat is not the path of the Middle Way, the reason being that conventionallythere are no phenomena at all that are not dependent origination. This, in turn,entails that, in reality, there are no phenomena whatsoever that are notemptiness.As this is the case, conventional dependent origination is possible for thosefor whom natural emptiness is possible. All the [principles] mentioned above,from the noble truths to mundane conventions, will then be just as feasiblesince they are included within dependent origination. Yet for the one for whomemptiness is not possible, that is, the one for whom there is a nature,dependent origination is not possible either. Hence, everything that falls underthe category of dependent origination, such as the noble truths and mundaneconvention, becomes impossible as well.The Unreasonable Nature of the CriticismOn the third issue, the treatise states:> All your own faults> You project onto me,> As if, while riding your horse,> You had forgotten all about it. [XXIV.15] Here, the Master explains, “You proponents of nature project all your ownproblems with the four noble truths onto me, the advocate of the completelyflawless position of natureless dependent origination. This is comparable to asituation where a distracted person forgets the very horse he or she is riding,and so accuses someone else of having stolen it. While you yourselves ride thehorses of error, you argue in distraction that they belong to others, and whileyou yourselves assert dependent origination—that is the nature of, or that thatwhich is entailed by, emptiness—you distractedly object that emptiness does notmake sense.Why Denying the Middle Way Would Be a MistakeThird, it is explained why denying the Middle Way is a mistake. One may wonder:“What are the flaws of others that are wrongly attributed to the Middle Wayproponents?”The reply to this question will be given in six sections, of which the firstconcerns the consequence that causality becomes nonexistent.The Consequence That Causality Becomes NonexistentThe treatise states:> If you view things> As existent by nature,> Then for you there are> No causes and conditions. [XXIV.16] > Effect and cause;> Agent, means, and action;> Arising, cessation, and result—> These are invalidated as well. [XXIV.17] If you deny that all phenomena are empty and instead view things as existent bynature, this means that for you outer and inner things do not have any causesand conditions. This is entailed because it has already been explained thatnature could not meaningfully arise based on causes and conditions and thatbeing produced is incompatible with being existent by nature. If you accept thatthere are no causes and conditions, it follows that vases and other such things,which are effects produced by causes and conditions, cannot exist either. Causalobjects such as clay, the potter who is the agent capable of undertaking theaction [of producing the vase], the means employed by the potter, such as hiswheel, the action that is the arising of the resultant vase, and the phenomenathat are associated with this result—all such things would then be nonexistenttoo. There could be no arising of the vase, no end to its existence, and nocontaining of water as the result of there being a vase. All of this isinvalidated as well.The Four Truths Would Be UntrueSecond, showing that the topics to be understood would become untrue, thetreatise states:> If all of this were not empty,> Nothing would arise or be destroyed.> For you it follows that> There are no four noble truths. [XXIV.20] > As it would not originate dependently,> How could there be suffering?> The teaching that the impermanent is suffering> Cannot be relevant where nature exists. [XXIV.21] > Given natural existence,> What could originate?> Hence, for those who deny emptiness,> There cannot be any origin. [XXIV.22] > If suffering exists by nature,> There can be no cessation.> As it would remain completely,> Cessation would be invalidated. [XXIV.23] > If there were a nature of the path,> It could not reasonably be cultivated.> If the path is to be cultivated,> Then this nature of yours does not exist. [XXIV.24] > If there is neither suffering> Nor its origin and cessation,> What cessation of suffering> Do you assert is achieved by the path? [XXIV.25] If all these outer and inner things were not empty and instead possessed anature, they could neither be produced nor undergo change. Hence, nothing wouldarise and nothing would be destroyed. The four noble truths entail arising anddestruction. Therefore, for you who assert that things are not empty of nature,it follows that none of the aforementioned four noble truths have any existence.To elaborate, where there is nature, there cannot be production and dependentorigination. Hence, since it could not originate dependently, how could therepossibly be any suffering, how could there be any aggregates produced by pastactions and afflictions? A sūtra teaches:> That which is impermanent is suffering. Yet this would be impossible for that which exists by nature because nature isincompatible with change, just like nonresistant space.Moreover, given the natural existence of suffering, what causally conditionedsuffering could possibly originate? There could not be any arising of sufferingbased on causes. Therefore, for those who assert natural existence and denyemptiness, there cannot be any origin, any cause of suffering.Moreover, if suffering existed by nature, there could be no cessation either.This is entailed because that which is truly natural must remain completely,just like the nonresistance of space. A denial of emptiness is, therefore, alsoa denial of cessation.Finally, if there were a nature of the path from the beginning, the path couldnot reasonably be cultivated and developed in a sequential manner. Hence, sinceit is taught that the path is to be cultivated, the notion that the path has anature can be dismissed. If you accept that the path is something to becultivated, then the nature that you talk about does not exist becauseproduction is incompatible with nature.Likewise, if nature exists there can be no suffering, no origin, and nocessation. What path is it, then, that you assert to be the means foreliminating suffering and its origin, and for achieving cessation? Since thereis no cessation of suffering, there cannot be a path that allows one to achieveit either.The Subject of the Path Would Be NonexistentThird, showing that there would be no subject of the path, the treatise states:> If complete understanding> Were absent by nature,> How could complete understanding occur?> Does nature not remain? [XXIV.26] > The same with your elimination,> Actualization, familiarization,> Cultivation, and four fruitions—> They are as impossible as complete understanding. [XXIV.27] > Since they retain their own nature,> How could fruitions that are> By nature unachieved> Ever be achieved? [XXIV.28] The nature of the complete understanding of suffering would not need to beunderstood. If complete understanding were absent by nature, how could it occurat a later point in time? The impossibility of complete understanding takingplace would be entailed, for would the natural not remain? Indeed, it must.The same goes for the opponent’s positions on the elimination of the origin, theactualization of the cessation, the familiarization with the path, and the fourfruitions of the cultivation—they too are as impossible as completeunderstanding. Since elimination and these other factors would not exist tobegin with, they could not reasonably come to exist at some subsequent timeeither because the natural cannot be changed.If the nature of something is not there to begin with, it is utterly impossiblefor it to come about later. Moreover, how could the nature of the fourfruitions, which to begin with are unachieved by nature, ever be achieved? Theirremaining unachieved would be entailed, as is shown with the words, “Since theyretain their own nature.”The Three Jewels Would Become NonexistentFourth, showing how the resultant three jewels would be nonexistent, thetreatise states:> Without fruition, there is no one abiding in it,> Nor anyone who has gained entry.> If the eight persons do not exist,> Then there is no Sangha. [XXIV.29] > Because there are no noble truths,> There is no Dharma either.> If there are no Dharma and Sangha,> How could there be any Buddha? [XXIV.30] > For you it follows that the Buddha> Does not depend on enlightenment.> For you it follows that enlightenment> Does not depend on the Buddha. [XXIV.31] > For you, the one who by nature is no Buddha> May pursue the conduct of enlightenment> In order to attain enlightenment,> Yet all such efforts will be in vain. [XXIV.32] The verses in the twenty-ninth and thirtieth stanzas show, respectively, how theSangha, Dharma, and Buddha would end up being nonexistent. These threeconsequences are to be understood in the same way as explained above [inXXIV.3c–5b].Furthermore, for the opponent, the Buddha, understood as the person thatsupports enlightenment, exists by nature. Therefore, it follows that this Buddhadoes not depend on that which is the cause of him being designated as such, thatis, the enlightenment of omniscient wakefulness. For the opponent, it equallyfollows that enlightenment, the omniscient wakefulness that is supported by theBuddha and the cause of him being designated as such, does not depend on theBuddha, that is, the supportive person or that which is defined byenlightenment.Moreover, it would be unnecessary for someone who is a Buddha by nature to makeany efforts on the path. Hence, that person who, according to the opponent, bynature is not a Buddha may diligently apply himself or herself to the conduct ofenlightenment in pursuit of enlightenment, yet no enlightenment will ever beachieved. Why? Because nothing can annul this person’s not being a Buddha bynature.No Cause and Effect of ActionsFifth, showing how it would not make sense for actions to have consequences, thetreatise states:> Nobody would ever perform> Dharma or non-Dharma.> What can be done to the not empty?> There can be no action in relation to nature. [XXIV.33] > In the absence of Dharma and non-Dharma,> For you, there are still effects.> Effects caused by Dharma and non-Dharma> For you, do not exist. [XXIV.34] > If, for you, there are effects> That arise from Dharma and non-Dharma,> Why, then, would these effects> Of Dharma and non-Dharma not be empty? [XXIV.35] No one would ever engage in Dharmic or non-Dharmic causes if they existed bynature. This is entailed because what can be done in relation to that which isnot empty? Indeed, nature and fabrication are irreconcilable. Hence, there canbe no action in relation to nature.Take also the subject, the pleasant and unpleasant effects of Dharma andnon-Dharma. It follows that, for the opponent, these effects may be present evenwithout there being any Dharma and non-Dharma because they exist by nature.Should the opponents accept this consequence, they will be reminded that forthem such a consequence is unacceptable. If the effects of Dharma and non-Dharmacould arise without there being any Dharma and non-Dharma, the latter two wouldhave become meaningless. These effects, moreover, could not manifest only atcertain times.It may then be argued: “The results, pleasure and pain, exist by nature. Yetthis does not mean that there is no Dharma or non-Dharma because these factorsare the causes that produce pleasure and pain.”Yet if the opponent asserts that there are effects caused by Dharma andnon-Dharma, why would such effects, since they arise based on Dharma andnon-Dharma, not then be of an empty nature? That their emptiness is entailed hasalready been explained more than once.Conventions Would Not Make Any SenseSixth, showing how neither mundane nor transcendent conventions would make anysense, the treatise states:> The one who denies> The emptiness of dependent origination> Will, likewise, be denying> All conventions of the world. [XXIV.36] > A denial of emptiness> Will preclude all action.> There will be actions without initiation,> As well as agents without anything done. [XXIV.37] > If beings had any nature,> They would not be born or die.> Indeed, they would remain immutable> And would not know a variety of states. [XXIV.38] > Were it not for emptiness,> The unattained could not be attained,> There would be no liberation from suffering,> And no elimination of action and affliction. [XXIV.39] First, it is shown how mundane conventions would become untenable. For those whodeny emptiness by asserting natural existence, there cannot reasonably be anyfabrication and dependent origination. Moreover, since worldly conventions like“go!” and “stay!” are included in dependent origination, these would be renderednonsensical. Indeed, the denial of emptiness is also the denial of all mundaneconventions.If emptiness is denied and one asserts the existence of nature, it will alsofollow that no agent could ever perform any action. Since actions would exist bynature, they would not depend on being initiated by agents, and they could thentake place without there being anything that performs them. Likewise, if theagents existed by nature, they would not depend on actions and there could thenbe agents that perform no action at all. We do not observe any such action oragent, however. Therefore, we can conclude that these two are mutually dependentand, hence, similar to reflections. If they possessed a nature, neither actionnor agent would make any sense.Furthermore, if there were a nature of wandering beings, they would not ariseand cease from one moment to the next. Instead, they would remain immutable byvirtue of their nature. If this is accepted, however, it will follow that thesebeings would not know different states, and yet we see that they do indeedparticipate in different situations. Hence, since they do not remain immutable,but arise and cease, we can conclude that wandering beings have no nature. Asūtra teaches:> If there were a bit that is not empty,> The Victorious One would not declare or teach anything.> Everything would remain immutable as it is,> Without developing or decaying.205 Second, it is explained how transcendent conventions would not make any senseeither. If there were no emptiness and things existed by their own natures, allfruitions, from that of the stream-enterer up to a Buddha’s, could not first beunattained and then later attained. Similarly, the resultant liberation fromsuffering without any remainder of the aggregates could not be something thatgoes from not having to having occurred. Since the causal action and afflictioncould not first exist and then later be eliminated, there could not be anytranscendence of suffering with remainder either.The Supremacy of Middle Way RealizationThird, expressing the supremacy of Middle Way realization, the treatise states:> The one who sees> Dependent origination> Sees suffering, its origin,> Cessation, and the path. [XXIV.40] The existence of nature would render everything impossible. The one who sees themeaning of emptiness, free from all mental constructions of truth, to beconventionally dependent origination is, therefore, also the one who sees theessential reality of the truths of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and thepath.SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER’S SIGNIFICANCE In terms of the ultimate, the present chapter has existentially negated allconstructions of truth with respect to all phenomena, including the four truths.As for the relative, it has established that these all appear dependently, justlike an illusion. The Noble Sūtra That Shows the Nonarising of All Phenomenateaches:> The one who sees the nonarising of all phenomena has complete understanding of> suffering. The one who sees the nonexistence of all phenomena has eliminated> the origin. The one who sees all phenomena as total transcendence of suffering> has actualized the cessation. The one who sees all phenomena as not being> things has cultivated the path. This concludes the explanation of the twenty-fourth chapter, the analysis of thenoble truths, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the MiddleWay.191.

And in the King of Meditative Absorptions:> The nonexistence of the transcendence of suffering> Is what the Protector of the World has taught as the transcendence of> suffering.> Knots tied on space> Are untied by space itself. Here, the meaning of such teachings that declare the transcendence of sufferingto be nonexistent will be ascertained through reasoning.As for its relation to the other analyses, the present chapter can be seen as areply to the following objection: “If all phenomena are emptiness in this way,there cannot be any elimination of suffering or cessation of the aggregates’continuity. Transcendence of suffering with or without remainder will then havebecome impossible.”Thus, the present analysis was composed to explain that the term “transcendenceof suffering” refers to the natural purity that, in reality, pertains to allphenomena. There is no transcendence of suffering in the sense of an eliminationof certain discards by means of a remedy.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 25 Second, the explanation of the chapter’s content contains (1) an objection and(2) a reply.OBJECTION Expressing the objection, the treatise states:> If all of this were empty,> Nothing would arise or be destroyed.> Which elimination and cessation is it> That you assert leads to the transcendence of suffering? [XXV.1] Here it is objected: “If all these outer and inner things were essentiallyempty, their distinctive arising and cessation would be nonexistent as well.Since both the afflictions and their remedy necessarily entail arising andcessation, what afflictions would it be that are eliminated by the remedy,undefiling wakefulness? Furthermore, how would the cessation of the continuityof the aggregates that results from this elimination take place? Indeed, to saythat the transcendence of suffering with and without remainder ensues from thiselimination and cessation, respectively, would make no sense.”REPLY The subsequent reply goes to show that while this problem (1) is relevant forthe opponent, it (2) does not pertain to the follower of the Middle Way.The Flaw Is Incurred by the OpponentMaking the first of these two points, the treatise states:> If all of this were not empty,> Nothing would arise or be destroyed.> Which elimination and cessation is it> That you assert leads to the transcendence of suffering? [XXV.2] If all these things were not empty and instead possessed a nature, they couldneither arise nor disintegrate because nature is incompatible with fabricationand change. How could you then assert the elimination of afflictions andcessation of aggregates that bring about, respectively, the transcendence ofsuffering with and without remainder? Indeed, any such assertion would beentirely inappropriate. As explained in the Noble Sūtra of the Elephant’sStrength:> If phenomena had any nature,> Then the victors and the listeners would know it.> Solid phenomena do not attain the transcendence of suffering.> The wise would never become free of mental construction. The Critique Does Not Pertain to the Follower of the Middle WayThe second issue involves (1) stating that the transcendence of suffering is theintrinsic nature, primordially free from extremes, (2) proving that this is so,and (3) deflecting the objection that it would then be meaningless to teach theDharma.Transcendence of Suffering Is the Intrinsic NatureOn the first issue, the treatise states:> No elimination and no attainment,> No annihilation and no permanence,> No cessation and no arising—> This is termed the transcendence of suffering. [XXV.3] Some may ask: “Why would you adherents of the Middle Way not incur the sameflaw?”Well, we do not assert that, in reality, there is a transcendence of sufferingin the sense of an elimination of certain discards by means of a remedy. What weterm “the transcendence of suffering” is the absence of the things that youimagine. For us, the transcendence of suffering is the absence of anyelimination of phenomena pertaining to thorough affliction, as well as theabsence of any attainment that is the result of complete purification. Itinvolves no annihilation of a previously existing continuum of the self or theaggregates, nor any permanence in the sense of a future existence of such acontinuum. There is no momentary cessation of an essence that existed before,nor any arising of something that did not exist earlier. That which is free fromthese six mentally constructed extremes is what is termed “the transcendence ofsuffering.”It might here be objected: “Various other distinctions in the form of negativeproperties are equally possible with respect to the transcendence of suffering.Yet if the properties above are then just examples, the full set would beunnecessary.”This criticism, however, is unfounded. The set of precisely these sixdistinctive, negative properties is presented to counter the mistaken ideas thatBuddhists and non-Buddhists have developed with respect to the transcendence ofsuffering. Notions of an elimination of flaws and the attainment of goodqualities are common to both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Far Throwers andFollowers of Sūtra believe in the annihilation of a previously existentcontinuum of the self and the aggregates, respectively. Enumerators andProponents of Differences conceive of permanence in the sense of a subsequentexistence of, respectively, the self and the entity of separation. Finally, MindOnly proponents believe that once all the deluded appearances and conceptsassociated with dualistic perception have been exhausted, the substance ofself-awareness exists as an essence that momentarily arises and ceases. Thesemisconceptions are thus perfectly countered by the six distinctions mentionedabove.It might also be argued: “Indeed, the transcendence of suffering does not itselfcontain any causal afflictions or resultant aggregates. Yet such factors arestill naturally existent during the preceding time of cyclic existence. Thetranscendence of suffering is thus to be understood as the peace that ensuesfrom their exhaustion.”Yet this will not do because what exists by nature to begin with cannot later bemade nonexistent. As the Master himself states:> The Great Vehicle teaches the absence of arising,> While for others emptiness is exhaustion.> Exhaustion and nonarising are actually the same;> Hence, do be patient.207 While a sūtra teaches:> Within the transcendence of suffering, there are no existent phenomena.> In it, there are no phenomena; they never existed.> When conceiving and experiencing in terms of “existence” and “nonexistence”> Suffering will not be thoroughly pacified.208 Proving That the Transcendence of Suffering Is the Intrinsic NatureThe treatment of the second issue involves (1) refuting the four extremes withrespect to the transcendence of suffering, (2) showing that a Buddha who hasrealized this is not established in the manner of the four extremes, and (3) theensuing conclusion. The first of these contains refutations of the notions that(1) the transcendence of suffering is an established entity or nonentity, (2) itis both, and (3) it is neither of these two. The first section (1) refutes thesetwo options one by one and (2) refutes them simultaneously.The Transcendence of Suffering Is Not an Established EntityThe Proponents of Differences assert the transcendence of suffering to be anunconditioned permanent entity that brings about the definitive cessation ofaffliction and suffering as if it were a dam that blocks a stream. There arethree steps to the refutation of this idea. First, showing how such anunderstanding would mean that the transcendence of suffering would involve agingand death, the treatise states:> Now, the transcendence of suffering is not an entity,> For it would then be characterized by aging and death.> There is no entity that is free> From aging and death. [XXV.4] In the first line, the Master presents his genuine thesis, stating that thetranscendence of suffering is not, as the opponent imagines, an entity. It couldnot be so, for if it were, it would have to be characterized by aging and death,and then it could not be the transcendence of suffering, nor could it beunconditioned. It will not be possible to here object that this is not entailedbecause there is no functional entity that, while free from aging and death, isunconditioned and permanent like space.The Transcendence of Suffering Would Be ConditionedShowing that the transcendence of suffering would end up conditioned, thetreatise states:> If the transcendence of suffering were an entity,> The transcendence of suffering would be conditioned.> An entity that is not conditioned> Does not exist anywhere at all. [XXV.5] If the transcendence of suffering were an entity, it would be, in essence, theproduct of causes and conditions, which would contradict the claim that it isunconditioned and permanent. Its being conditioned is entailed because nowherein space or time is there an entity that is not conditioned. This can beconcluded from our perception of entities as being confined to particular timesand locations.The Transcendence of Suffering Would Be Dependently OriginatedShowing that the transcendence of suffering would originate dependently, thetreatise states:> If the transcendence of suffering were an entity,> Why would it not be dependent?> An entity that is not dependent> Does not exist at all. [XXV.6] Moreover, if the transcendence of suffering were an entity, why would it not besomething that is dependent on other designators? Indeed, just as long dependson short, the transcendence of suffering would be dependent on otherdesignators. It could not, therefore, be established by nature. This is indeedentailed. Since entity and nonentity must be set forth in mutual dependence,there is no entity at all that does not depend on other designators.The Transcendence of Suffering Is Not a NonentitySecondly, the Followers of Sūtra assert a transcendence of suffering that is theexhaustion of previously existent entities and which, as such, is a nonentity.The refutation of this idea begins by showing how, given the nonexistence of thenegated, there can be no nonentity. The treatise states:> If the transcendence of suffering is not an entity,> How could it be a nonentity?> When the transcendence of suffering is not an entity,> Neither is it a nonentity. [XXV.7] Given that the transcendence of suffering is not an entity, since this hasalready been refuted, how could it feasibly be a nonentity? That it could not isentailed because negations depend on there being something negated. Hence, forthose who take the position that the transcendence of suffering is not anentity, it cannot be a nonentity either.The Transcendence of Suffering Would Be Dependently OriginatedShowing how the transcendence of suffering would originate dependently, thetreatise states:> If the transcendence of suffering is not an entity,> Why would it not be dependent?> Indeed, there is no nonentity at all> That is not dependent. [XXV.8] Likewise, if the transcendence of suffering is not an entity, but a nonentity,why would it not be dependently originated, either in the sense of beingessentially a product of causes and conditions, or in terms of being dependenton other designators? Indeed, it is entailed that the transcendence of sufferingwould be dependently originated. First, it is taught that “the condition ofbirth gives rise to aging and death.” Therefore, the nonentity that is theimpermanence of an entity’s disintegration arises based on that entity.Moreover, the convention of “nonentity” is dependent on that which is negated,that is, entity. Hence, there is no nonentity at all that is neither essentiallydependent on causes and conditions, nor dependent on other designators.Simultaneous RefutationThe second section consists of refutations that simultaneously negate [both thetranscendence of suffering as an entity and as a nonentity]. Setting forth sucha refutation by means of reasoning, the treatise states:> Entities that come and go> Are dependent and caused.> Their being independent and not caused> Is taught to be the transcendence of suffering. [XXV.9] It may be asked: “Well then, what is the transcendence of suffering?”The entities of self and the aggregates that come into this life from a pastone, and go from here to a future life, do so in terms of a dependence onprevious designators (just as long depends on short and vice versa) and beingcaused by previous essences (just as the light that emerges from a lamp). Whenthose entities are independent of previous designators and are no longer beingcaused by previous essences at some point in the future, they will not come andgo. It is this that the Able One has taught to be the transcendence ofsuffering. Hence, it is explained that this mere absence of a further migrationof the person and the aggregates cannot feasibly be an entity or a nonentity.Thus, while this stanza can be read as an explanation that the conventionaltranscendence of suffering is the exhaustion of adventitious stains, theCommentary explains it along the following lines: The transcendence of sufferingis taught to be the nonmigration that is independent of past designators and notcaused by past essences. Hence, this natural non-migration of self and theaggregates cannot reasonably be an entity or a nonentity.The stanza can also be understood as follows: It may be thought that it is theaggregates that undergo cyclic existence, coming and going in dependence on thesuccession of previous aggregates, or it may be held that it is the person whocycles, being caused to come and go by the aggregates. In the first case, thetranscendence of suffering is taught to be a nonmigration, where there is nolonger any dependence on previous aggregates. In the second case, thetranscendence of suffering is when the person no longer migrates, not beingcaused to do so by the aggregates. Therefore, such a nonmigration cannot be anentity or a nonentity. This interpretation is also found in the Commentary, withthe exception that the nonmigration is there seen as primordial.Refutation by Means of ScripturePresenting a simultaneous refutation by means of scripture, the treatise states:> The Teacher has declared> The abandonment of arising and disintegration.> Thus, it makes sense that the transcendence of suffering> Is not an entity or a nonentity. [XXV.10] Let us assume that the transcendence of suffering were either an entity or anonentity. The views that there are, respectively, either the arising of anentity or the nonentity of disintegration would then be views that accord withthe way the transcendence of suffering actually is. If this were the case, suchviews would not need to be abandoned.The Teacher has, however, declared:> Monks, some strive to definitively emerge from existence through entry or> disintegration. Such people suffer from a great lack of understanding. Thus, he has stated that those views that see the transcendence of suffering interms of arising and entity, or disintegration and nonentity, must be abandoned.Accordingly, since these views are not in harmony with the transcendence ofsuffering, it makes sense that the latter is not an entity or a nonentity.Transcendence of Suffering Is Not Both Entity and NonentitySome believe the transcendence of suffering to be the absence of affliction andarising, which is intrinsically and essentially existent. Hence, they hold it tobe both entity and nonentity. The refutation of this view begins with ademonstration of the absurdity of this position:> If the transcendence of suffering> Were both entity and nonentity,> Entity and nonentity would be liberation,> Yet this does not make sense. [XXV.11] What if the transcendence of suffering were both entity and nonentity by nature?By the same token, it would then have to be the case that entities andnonentities, whatever they may be, were all liberation. Sentient beings wouldthen all be effortlessly liberated. Yet since it does not make sense for entityand nonentity to be liberation, the transcendence of suffering is not of thenature of entity and nonentity.The Transcendence of Suffering Would Be Dependently OriginatedShowing how the transcendence of suffering would turn out to be dependentlyoriginated, the treatise states:> If the transcendence of suffering> Were both entity and nonentity,> The transcendence of suffering would not be independent,> Because these two are dependent. [XXV.12] Also, if the transcendence of suffering were both entity and nonentity, it wouldnot be independent of other designators. Instead, it would be reliant on otherphenomena. That this is entailed can be seen from the way that entity andnonentity are mutually dependent.Refutation by Reference to the Transcendence of Suffering Being UnconditionedRefuting that the transcendence of suffering is both entity and nonentity byreferring to its being unconditioned, the treatise states:> How could the transcendence of suffering> Be both entity and nonentity?> The transcendence of suffering is unconditioned,> Entity and nonentity are conditioned. [XXV.13] > How could the transcendence of suffering> Possess both entity and nonentity?> These two cannot coexist,> Just like light and darkness. [XXV.14] How could the transcendence of suffering be both entity and nonentity, giventhat the transcendence of suffering is unconditioned? While an entity is theproduct of causes and conditions, the nonentity of disintegration is a conditionfor arising. Thus, they are both conditioned. This, then, shows the argument’sreverse entailment.It may then be argued: “Entity and nonentity do not constitute the nature of thetranscendence of suffering. The latter, however, possesses the former two.” Yethow could the transcendence of suffering possess both entity and nonentity? Justlike light and darkness, these two are mutually incompatible and, therefore,could not coexist in a single substance, which in this case would be thetranscendence of suffering.The Transcendence of Suffering Is Not neither Entity nor NonentityThird, the refutation of the assertion that the transcendence of suffering isneither an entity nor a nonentity includes: (1) presenting the criticism and (2)refuting the arguments.The CriticismAs for the first, the treatise states:> The teaching that the transcendence of suffering> Is neither entity nor nonentity> Would be established> If entity and nonentity were established. [XXV.15] The negative property “neither entity nor nonentity” would be established if thenegated properties, entity and nonentity, were themselves established. Giventheir establishment, the teaching that the transcendence of suffering is neitherentity nor nonentity would then be established as well. Nevertheless, since bothof these objects of negation, entity and nonentity, have already been refuted,the negative property that is the negation of these two is not establishedeither.Refutation of the ArgumentOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If the transcendence of suffering> Were neither entity nor nonentity,> Who would perceive that> “It is neither entity nor nonentity”? [XXV.16] If the transcendence of suffering were, by nature, neither entity nor nonentity,what person would perceive that “the transcendence of suffering has a naturethat is neither entity nor nonentity”? Is it someone within cyclic existence, oris it rather a person who abides in the transcendence of suffering? At the stageof peace, there is no one to conduct such an examination. Moreover, thetranscendence of suffering is not an object of the relative, subjectiveconsciousness of cyclic existence. Wakefulness, on the other hand, which is theultimate subject, does not observe any of the marks of mental construction. Itwould not, therefore, apprehend the transcendence of suffering to be neitherentity nor nonentity.The Buddha Is Not Established in the Way of the Four ExtremesNow it will be shown that the one who flawlessly realizes the transcendence ofsuffering is not established in the manner of the four extremes. Doing so willinclude demonstrating the lack of establishment at (1) the time of transcendenceand (2) the time of abidance.The Lack of Establishment at the Time of TranscendenceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> When the Transcendent Conqueror has gone beyond,> He is not perceived as “existent,”> Nor as “nonexistent,”> As “both,” or as “neither.” [XXV.17] Once the Transcendent Conqueror has passed beyond suffering, he is not perceivedto be “existent” or “nonexistent,” nor is he manifest as “both existent andnonexistent” or “neither existent nor nonexistent.” It has already beenexplained that, from the very moment he appears, the Buddha is peace by nature.The Lack of Establishment at the Time of AbidanceOn the second issue, the treatise states:> Even as the Transcendent Conqueror remains,> He is not perceived as “existent,”> Nor as “nonexistent,”> As “both” or as “neither.” [XXV.18] It is not only upon his passing that the Transcendent Conqueror is beyond thefour extremes. Indeed, he is not perceived to exist while he remains eitherbecause, as was explained above, the appropriated and appropriator are devoid ofnature. He is not seen as nonexistent either, for there cannot be any negativeproperty in the absence of something negated. Moreover, because existence andnonexistence are incompatible, he is not seen to be both, and since the negatedproperties have no establishment, he is not perceived as neither existent nornonexistent.ConclusionThird, the conclusion includes (1) establishing that there is no differencebetween existence and peace and (2) refuting the indeterminate views.No Difference between Existence and PeaceOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Cyclic existence is not the slightest bit> Different from the transcendence of suffering> Transcendence of suffering is not the slightest bit> Different from cyclic existence. [XXV.19] > That which is the condition of transcendence> Is the condition of cyclic existence as well.> Between these two there is not> The slightest bit of difference. [XXV.20] Neither appearance nor absence of appearance are established in the manner ofthe four extremes. In reality, the cyclic existence of the initial time ofappearance is, therefore, not even the slightest bit different from thesubsequent nonabiding transcendence of suffering. Neither is the nature of thesubsequent transcendence of suffering the slightest bit different from the priorcyclic existence. How so? Because the real condition of the transcendence ofsuffering, that is, the freedom from the four extremes that was explained above,is also the real condition of cyclic existence. Between these two there is noteven the most subtle difference. Upon examination, they are seen to be the samein not being established with any nature at all.Indeterminate ViewsThe refutation of the fourteen indeterminate views begins with an identificationof these views. The treatise states:> Views of what follows the passing, of the finite and so on,> Along with those on permanence and so forth,> Are based on the transcendence of suffering,> The limit of the future, and the limit of the past. [XXV.21] Among the fourteen views, there are four that concern what follows the passingof the Thus-Gone. Respectively, they are the beliefs that he then exists, doesnot exist, both exists and does not exist, and neither exists nor does notexist. These four are based on and supported by [the idea of] the transcendenceof suffering. Another set of four views concerns the finite and so on.Respectively, they are the beliefs that the self or the world are finite,infinite, both finite and infinite, and neither finite nor infinite. Since theseviews involve holding future events to occur, not occur, both occur and notoccur, and neither occur nor not occur, they are based on the limit of thefuture. Four further views concern permanence and so forth, in the sense thatthese are views that the self or the world are permanent, impermanent, bothpermanent and impermanent, or neither permanent nor impermanent. As these arebeliefs in prior existence, prior nonexistence, combined prior existence andnonexistence, and neither prior nonexistence nor prior nonexistence, they arebased on the limit of the past. Finally, there are the two views that concernsameness and difference. These two views relate to the body and the life-forcebeing identical and different, respectively. Hence, they are based on, or aremade in reference to, [the concepts of ] body and life-force.Why These Indeterminate Views Are UntenableSecond, showing these indeterminate views to be untenable, the treatise states:> When all things are empty,> What is finite and what is infinite?> What is both finite and infinite?> What is neither finite nor infinite? [XXV.22] > What is identical and what is different?> What is permanent, what is impermanent?> What is both permanent and impermanent?> What is neither permanent nor impermanent? [XXV.23] When all things are empty in essence, what then to say of views that concerndistinct qualities? What to say of the view that the self or the world will, atsome point, come to an end, and that these two are, thus, finite? What of theview that they will not end and, hence, are infinite? What does it mean for themto both end and not end, to be both finite and infinite? And what would it meanthat they neither end nor do not end, that they are neither finite nor infinite?What does it mean for body and life-force to be the same? What does it mean forthem to be different? What does it mean that the world and the self arepermanent and existed throughout the past or that they did not and areimpermanent? What would it mean that they both exist and do not, that they areboth permanent and impermanent? Or that they neither existed nor did not exist,being neither? The refutation of the four views that are based on thetranscendence of suffering have already been refuted above [in the analysis ofthe Thus-Gone]. Therefore, since the bases for such distinctions have noestablishment in reality, these views that ascribe distinctions to them are alluntenable. Know, then, that this is why they are indeterminate.Teaching the Dharma Is Not MeaninglessOn the third topic, the treatise states:> Complete pacification of all observations,> The complete pacification of constructs, peace—> Nowhere did the Buddha teach> Any Dharma to anyone at all. [XXV.24] It may be argued. “If, upon examination, one finds that there is notranscendence of suffering, it would be meaningless to teach the Dharma that isassociated with the remedies employed for the purpose of attaining thetranscendence of suffering.”If there were Dharma, students, and a teacher in reality, there would also be ateaching. Ultimately, however, all observations are universally and completelypacified. The mental constructs associated with language are completelypacified, and there is peace with the pacification of all of the mind’sobservations. Therefore, nowhere, neither in a divine realm nor at any otherplace, did the Buddha ever teach any Dharma concerned with affliction and itspurification to any god, human, or otherwise—not to anyone at all. Hence, thisis not meaningless. As taught in the Sūtra on the Secret of the Thus-Gone:> From the night of enlightenment,> And until my passing utterly beyond,> I do not teach any Dharma> To anyone at all. One might wonder: “Well, if this is the case, how did the great diversity ofconventions found in the Buddha’s excellent discourses manifest?”These are not stated in terms of reality, but in terms of convention. Evenconventionally they are not taught in terms of any essence of the ultimate. Theyare conveyed by superimposition through and through. Moreover, since for theBuddha all verbal and mental engagements are completely pacified, they are notstated by the Buddha himself. Rather, they appear as the objects of a deludedmind due to the combined power of past aspirations and the purity of the actionof those to be influenced. Hence, it is taught:> Here there is no suchness and no Thus-Gone.> Wandering beings all see reflections.> This is, as it were, a reflection of the Thus-Gone’s> Undefiling qualities of virtue.209 Thus, this chapter has ultimately shown the primordial and existential negationof mental constructs concerning the transcendence of suffering, while in termsof convention it has explained freedom from adventitious stains to be similar toan illusion. Implicitly, the chapter has shown that this holds for all otherphenomena as well. The Sūtra of the King of Meditative Absorptions teaches:> The ultimate truth is like a dream> And the transcendence of suffering is of the nature of a dream.> The wise one who acts accordingly> Is declared to possess the vow of speech. This concludes the explanation of the twenty-fifth chapter, the analysis ofnirvana, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way.206. In this chapter, the concluding summary is included in the explanation ofstanza 24.207. Nāgārjuna, Jewel Garland, IV.86.208. From the King of Meditative Absorptions.209. From the Ornament of Wisdom Light."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATIONHAVING THUS EXPLAINED that its distinctive qualities are natural emptiness, wewill now turn to the dependent origination that is the basis for suchdistinction. Three issues pertain to this chapter as well.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 26 First, regarding the context of this chapter, the present analysis relates tocertain teachings found in the sūtras, such as the following:> Aside from the dependently originated, a bodhisattva does not see any> phenomena whatsoever. Thus, the sūtras teach relative dependent origination along with its divisions.Here, it is the meaning of such teachings that will be ascertained.Concerning this chapter’s relation to the other analyses, it was explained abovethat:> That which originates in dependence> Is taught to be emptiness.210 And:> The one who sees> Dependent origination> Sees suffering, its origin,> Cessation, and the path.211 It may, therefore, be asked, “How is dependent origination itself to beunderstood ?”The present chapter presents a reply to this question in two parts: (1) anexplanation of the content and (2) a contemplation of the meaning.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 26 The literal meaning of the term “dependent origination” has already beenexplained above. With respect to the objects that this term applies to, we haveidentified both their characteristics and the bearers of these characteristics.As for the way the bearers are divided, we may distinguish between the dependentorigination of the external environment and the dependent origination of thebeings that inhabit it. Here, the latter is our primary concern. Therefore, itis the impure dependent origination of the twelve links of existence, fromignorance to aging and death, that the treatise treats here. The explanationwill cover (1) the forward arising of the links, (2) the person who isassociated with their arising and reversal, and (3) the reversal of the links.THE ARISING OF THE LINKS OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION On the first topic, the treatise states:> Due to the obscuration of ignorance, there occurs, directed at rebirth,> The conditioning of the action> Of the three types of formation.> Thus, there is migration between the realms. [XXVI.1] > Consciousness, conditioned by formation,> Enters the realms.> Once consciousness has entered,> Name and form will manifest. [XXVI.2] > When name and form have manifested,> The six sense sources will develop.> Dependent on the six sense sources,> Contact comes into being. [XXVI.3] > It arises exclusively in dependence> On eye, form, and consciousness.> Thus, dependent on eye and form,> Consciousness will occur. [XXVI.4] > Contact is the meeting> Of eye, form, and consciousness.> Out of this meeting> Arises sensation. [XXVI.5] > Conditioned by sensation, there is craving,> Craving with respect to sensation.> When there is craving, there will be grasping,> Grasping in the fourfold way. [XXVI.6] > Grasping will initiate> The becoming of the grasper.> Absence of grasping will result> In liberation free from becoming. [XXVI.7] > Becoming is the five aggregates.> From becoming follows birth.> Aging and death, grief,> Lamentation, pain, [XXVI.8] > Mental unrest, disturbance—> All of this occurs due to birth.> Thus arises this mass> Of nothing but suffering. [XXVI.9] The bond of ignorance, or of existence, is to be understood neither as anexistential negation of awareness, nor as a mistaken cognition in the sense of apredicative negation of awareness. Rather, this is a type of cognition thatconflicts with a precise understanding of the way things are. In this context,the Śālu Sprout speaks of “the belief in permanence and singularity in relationto the composite of the six elements.” However, this is simply meant toillustrate the lack of insight into the absence of self that is entailed by suchignorance.In terms of its divisions, ignorance includes delusion with respect to therelative cause and effect of action and the ultimate absence of self in relationto persons and phenomena. Both of these delusions are discards that are to beeliminated by seeing things exactly as they are, for these modes of apprehendingconflict with that observation. As for the extremely subtle delusion thatconcerns the consequences of action, it is only discarded at the level ofBuddhahood.Now, such ignorance obscures the path of peace in that it hinders seeing therelative causality of actions and the ultimate absence of the two selves. This,in turn, leads to a future rebirth, insofar as the defiling actions that propelone into existence, and which are of three types of conditioning (understood asthose of either body, speech, and mind, or meritorious, unmeritorious, andunshakable), are formed, thus causing migration from one realm to another.As for the consciousness that is conditioned by formation, this is aconsciousness that, due to formation, has been infused with the habitualtendencies of the aforementioned actions. As a result, this consciousnessbecomes capable of producing name and form. The Sūtra on the Discernment ofDependent Origination, in this context, identifies the link of consciousnesswith the six collections. The Master Vasubandhu, however, has argued that if thesūtra’s statements were to be taken literally, three problems would occur.First, apart from the [resultant consciousness], there would be no separate[consciousness] to perform the infusion of habitual tendencies. Second, as thesix collections become virtuous and nonvirtuous, they could not serve as therecipient of infusion. Finally, that which is infused would dissipate because itwould lack a support. Vasubandhu, therefore, sees this sūtra to be using thename of the supported as a way of referring to its support, just as when thereis mention of “clear faculties.” He thus identifies the link of consciousnesswith the all-ground consciousness that is indeterminate and active together withthat which performs the infusion. In accordance with its action, thisconsciousness then enters the various realms.Once consciousness has entered the mother’s womb, name and form will manifest.“Name” here refers to sensation, identification, formation, and consciousness,which have not yet fully developed. “Form” includes the first six of the eightstages in the development of the fetus: the oval shape, the oblong, the lumpy,the hardened, the development of legs and arms, and the development of hair onthe head and body.When name and form have manifested in this manner, the eye and the otherfaculties that make up the six sense sources, and which are capable ofdetermining inner and outer objects, will develop on the seventh stage.Dependent on the six sense sources, contact will come into being.What, then, is contact? How does it arise? To answer these questions, let usconsider how the eye consciousness arises exclusively in dependence on threefactors: the ruling condition of the eye, the observed condition of form, andthe immediately preceding condition of attentive mental activity. Thus, theconsciousness associated with the eye arises in dependence on the attention ofthe four factors subsumed by name and on form, its sense object.In essence, the contact associated with eye consciousness is the determinationof attractive, unattractive, and neutral objects based on the meeting of eye,form, and consciousness. Contact as such includes the contact associated withthe eye up to the contact associated with the mental faculty.Sensations that are pleasurable, painful, and neutral arise from thisdetermination of attractive, unattractive, and neutral objects.Sensation serves as the condition for craving. This craving expresses itself asthe wish to either keep or separate from these sensations. Once craving occurs,intention and desire arise in relation to that which is sensed, and so cravingdevelops into grasping. This grasping is fourfold in the sense that it involvesgrasping in relation to pleasures, views, belief in the supremacy of view anddiscipline, and the doctrine of self. Craving associated with the realm ofdesire produces grasping for pleasures, while the craving associated with theform and formless realms may engender any of the other three forms of grasping.The presence of these four graspings allows action to gain impetus, leading tothe grasper’s becoming. When discerning insight prevents the craving in relationto the sensations, grasping will be absent. This, in turn, will result inliberation, and there will then not be any becoming.Becoming is composed of physical, verbal, and mental actions. In this sense, itis of the nature of the five aggregates as subsumed under mind and matter.Because of this factor, there will also be the becoming of the future fiveaggregates. Hence, that this link of dependent origination is called “becoming”can also be understood as an instance of a causal factor’s being named after itseffect. Based on this link of becoming, there will be rebirth in a future lifeand aging and death as the aggregates of that life respectively age and come toan end. At the time of death, there will be grief as the mind is pained byhaving to separate from that which it cherishes. This grief, in turn, will bevocalized with lamentations. There will be pain and mental unrest as body andmind experience what is not desired. Such sufferings then create disturbances inthe psychophysical continuum. Read differently, there will be disturbance as oneis exhausted by the efforts of searching and securing. All of this is due tobirth. Thus, this mass, or accumulation, of suffering is nothing but sufferingin that it involves no happiness and is entirely devoid of a self and anythingthat belongs to a self.The latter elements are mentioned in certain sūtras to elicit a sense ofdisillusionment by considering the results of the evolving of the links.Nevertheless, because they are not certain to occur, they are not counted amongthe links of dependent origination.THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO ENGENDERS AND DISSOLVES THIS PROCESS On the second topic, the treatise states:> Formation is the root of cyclic existence,> Therefore, the wise do not form.> The agents of that are the unwise;> Not the wise, for they see reality. [XXVI.10] Karmic formations are the root of cyclic existence in the sense that they arethe primary cause for consciousness and the other elements that constitute theengagement in cyclic existence. For this reason, the noble ones, who possesswisdom regarding the means for ending cyclic existence, or about karmiccausality and the real nature of things, do not form any action, and so do notgive rise to the roots of cyclic existence.It might then be thought that those who have seen the truths will not takefuture rebirths because they do not accumulate formations. It is, however,taught that:> For the one who has seen the truth, there is no impelling.212 Thus, once the truth has been seen, there will be no further accumulation ofaction that impels one toward cyclic existence. Yet the old action that wasimpelled by ignorance in the past will be nourished by the craving and graspingof the noble one who is on the path of training. This will bring about furtherrebirth. Finally, for those beyond training, there is neither craving norgrasping so there will not be any rebirth either. Hence, it is taught:> Once free of grasping, there is no rebirth.213 Therefore, it is ordinary individuals—those who are unwise with respect to themeans for ending cyclic existence, or with regard to karmic causality and thereal condition of things—who are the agents that create the three types offormation. As is taught:> The being, or person, who is associated with ignorance forms meritorious,> unmeritorious, or unshakable formations. Why are the wise not agents of karmic formations? The wise do not engage in anykarmic action, for they see reality and that sight is incompatible with thecause of karmic formation.THE REVERSAL OF THE LINKS On the third topic, the treatise states:> When ignorance has ceased,> Formation does not arise either.> The cessation of ignorance is accomplished> By meditating on reality through insight. [XXVI.11] > As each of them ceases,> None of them will occur.> Thus, this mass of nothing but suffering> Will actually come to an end. [XXVI.12] When ignorance is present, there will be formation. Therefore, when ignorancehas ceased, no formation will arise either because its cause will be missing.Thus, as each preceding cause, from formation to birth, ceases, none of theirsubsequent effects, from consciousness to aging and death, will occur either.One may then wonder: “That may be so, but what makes ignorance cease?”Ignorance is the cause that establishes existence. Its cessation is accomplishedby meditating, through the insight that the reality of dependent origination isempty of both the person and phenomena. This meditation begins on the levels ofinspired conduct. Through that, one will witness reality, just as it is. Thisentire mass of suffering, which does not contain any happiness and is empty of aself and anything that belongs to a self, will without exception (“actually”renders the Sanskrit samyak and “without exception” the Sanskrit samanta) cometo an end.CONTEMPLATION OF THE MEANING Second follows a few words of explanation in relation to the above. Thisinvolves (1) ascertaining the nature of dependent origination, (2) its profounddistinctions, and (3) the supremacy of the realization of dependent origination.THE NATURE OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION First, it has already been explained that “arising in dependence on variousphenomena” is the defining characteristic of dependent origination, while thebearers of that characteristic are all outer and inner phenomena. What we willconsider here is, therefore, the teaching on (1) the outer dependent originationof the environment and (2) the inner dependent origination of sentient beings.Outer Dependent OriginationFirst, as an illustration of outer dependent origination, we may take theexample of a crop. Its dependent origination should be understood by considering1) its related causes, 2) its related conditions, and 3) the absence ofvolition. In our example, the series of developing causes is as follows: seed,sprout, shoot, stem, stalk, bud, flower, and fruit. Its conditions are earth,water, fire, wind, space, and time. Respectively, these create adhesion,moisture, maturation, unfolding, openness, and change. There is no freedom ofvolition in terms of causes, conditions, or effects. As it is explained:> Without thinking, “this shall be produced,”> Production, nevertheless, takes place.> Likewise, there is no intention “I shall produce.”214 Thus, the production simply takes place according to the capacity of the causes.Inner Dependent OriginationSecond, the teaching of the inner dependent origination of sentient beingscovers (1) the evolution of impure dependent origination, (2) the evolution ofpure dependent origination, and (3) the means for bringing about their reversal.The Evolution of Impure Dependent OriginationThe evolution of the first type of dependent origination concerns the twelvelinks of existence, from ignorance through aging and death. Thus, we shallconsider these links in terms of (1) their individual essences, (2) the causaland conditional relationships between them, (3) how they do not involvevolition, and (4) the definitive nature of their enumeration and sequence. Theirindividual essences and causal relationships have already been covered throughthe treatise’s account of the way the previous links serve as the basis for thearising of subsequent links.Concerning the related conditions, these are explained as follows:> From a composition of six elements,> The body is born.215 Thus, the elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousnessrespectively provide the body with solidity, cohesion, maturation, breathing,openness in its cavities, and preservation without rotting. These are theconditions for the establishment and remaining of the aggregates.As for the way these causes, conditions, and results do not do not involve anyfreedom of volition, this is easily understood from statements such as:> It is held that these do not involve> The arising of any thought of “I” or “mine.”216 Fourth, in various sūtras, the Transcendent Conqueror repeatedly treats thesetwelve links of dependent origination as definitive in terms of their sequenceand number. As for the mutual causal relationships between the links, theListeners’ collection of the words of the Buddha, as well as the treatiseentitled Entry into Wakefulness, teach that the links are divided in threeparts, encompassing three lives. Thus, two sequences of cause and effect areidentified. This is as well reflected in the Treasury of Abhidharma:> As for the past and the future, there are two times two,> While in between there are eight, when all is complete.217 This explanation employs the example of the present life positioned between apast and a future life. The affliction of ignorance and the action of formationassociated with the past life thus serve as the cause for their effect, whichconsists of the consciousness, name and form, six sense sources, contact, andsensation found in the present life. This, then, is one sequence of cause andeffect. In addition, in the present life, the afflictions of craving andgrasping and the action of becoming together bring about the effect of birthplus aging and dying in the future life. That is the second causal sequence. Inthis way, we arrive at two links that are exclusively causes pertaining to thepast life and two links that are effects that belong to the future life alone.In between, the present life then spans eight links, that is, five that are theeffects of the past life and three that are cause of the future life.Accepting the above explanation at face value will, however, lead to a number ofproblems. For one, this would conflict with the way the Transcendent Conquerorhas characterized the functions of ignorance, craving, formation, and becoming.He treats the first two as those factors that, respectively, produce and nourishthe accumulation of action, whereas the latter two are seen to be karmicaccumulation and its gaining impetus. The explanation is also called intoquestion by the fact that simple formations engendered by ignorance may bepresent even for a foe-destroyer. The notion of craving and grasping serving ascauses in isolation is not reasonable either, for unless action is accumulated,craving and grasping cannot function. Nor does it make sense to seeconsciousness and the next four links in isolation from birth, aging, and death.These causes and effects cannot reasonably be a definitive sequence of distinctelements. The explicit meaning of the above account is, thus, subject tocritique.It is, however, also taught that the sequential causes and effects are mutuallyinclusive. Thus, we find the following passage:> The past and future causes and effects, in summary,> Can be inferred from the intermediate ones.218 Here, we are given two accounts of causality: summarized causes and elaboratedeffects versus elaborated causes and summarized effects. When both the causaland resultant factors included in the present life are elaborated, we may, withrespect to their causes and effects, infer their past causes and future effectsand so enumerate sixteen links. When an alternate concise causal sequence isapplied with respect to this life, the number of relevant links becomes eight.The explanation is given with the following considerations in mind. The causes(craving, grasping, and becoming) and effects (consciousness, name and form, thesix sense sources, contact, and sensation) included in this life may bementioned individually because they are manifest and each performs its function.The causes found in the past life have, on the other hand, ceased, while theeffects in the future life are not yet clearly established. Hence, ignorance andformation can be referred to under the general label of action and affliction,while [birth, aging, and death] may simply be spoken of as arising anddisintegrating. What emerges is a picture where each of the three lives itself,in dependence, includes a previous, subsequent, and intermediary element. Hence,this is seen to be a way of showing each of the lives in terms of a sequence ofthree factors of cause and effect.The master Asaṅga, on the other hand, operates with a system of six causal andsix resultant links. He explains that the experience of emerging from one’smother’s womb and living a life through to its final end is the effect ofdefiling action that requires a set of primary causes and effects that unfoldover the course of two lives. Identifying the six causal and six resultant linkswith reference to these two lives, he sees this enumeration to be definitive.The six causes are, moreover, divided into distant impelling causes and closeestablishing causes. The first set of causes includes the basis for, the meansfor, and the mode of impulsion. In other words, this concerns the process ofignorance becoming the basis for formation, and formation then impelling thecreation of imprints of action in the consciousness. The second type of cause issimilarly to be understood in terms of the basis for, the means for, and themode of establishment. Craving in relation to sensation is the basis forgrasping in pursuit of objects, and that grasping is the means for theestablishment of [becoming, that is] powerful, or unimpeded action that is ableto produce the sprouts of name and form.Also, the six effects contain distant impelled effects and close establishedeffects. The first type includes four effects associated with the consciousnessthat has received the impelling energy. These are name and form, the sixsources, contact, and sensation. The first two are, respectively, the initiallyobtained and fully developed body, and the second two constitute the characterand experience of encounter. The second type consists of birth, meaningestablishment, and aging and death, which are the continuum of establishmentundergoing change and disintegration.The Compendium, the master Nāgārjuna, and the ṭīka on Distinguishing the Middlefrom Extremes, alternatively, treat consciousness in terms of the resultantentry into the womb, elaborating five causes and seven effects. The Collectionof the Mind and the Secret Meaning present ten causes and two effects byconsidering the four links that begin with consciousness as seminal factors thatmanifest their result in birth and aging and death. The Discernment of DiscretePhenomena explains that the twelve links are included in seven topics. Ignoranceand formation are, thus, 1) that which impels; consciousness infused with karmichabitual tendencies is 2) the way the impulsion takes place; name and form plusthe next three links constitute 3) that which is impelled; craving and graspingmake up 4) the factors that establish the manifestation of the impelled;becoming is 5) the way the establishment takes place; birth is 6) that which ismanifestly established; and aging and death are 7) the negative consequences ofthe established.The master Vasubandhu summarizes this doctrine as follows:> The impeller, how impulsion takes place, and the impelled,> The process of establishment,> As well as its flaws,> Are taught by means of the twelve links. > Through two links, one link,> Four links, two links,> One link, one link, and one link,> The seven topics are clearly explained. > Because the truth is not known as it is> The mind is infused with action,> And so four links are gradually impelled> As their seeds solidify. > Having arisen as impelled,> Sensation produces craving,> Which again gives rise to grasping.> Its action manifests the establishment of the infused. > The established is birth,> While aging and the like are its negative consequences.> There is, therefore, no impulsion for the one who sees the truth,> And for the one free from craving there is no recurrence.219 These five stanzas contain a presentation, an explanation, and an argument. Thepresentation is found in the first stanza. The explanation is twofold, coveringboth the classification and function of the links. Of these, the classificationis explained in the second stanza. The way the links function as impulsion,establishment, and negative consequences is, explained in the third stanza, thefourth stanza plus the first line of the fifth, and the second line of the fifthstanza, respectively. The argument that the links function to infuse andestablish in this way is delivered in the second half of the fifth stanza. Theargument emerges by considering how, for those who see the truth, there is nokarmic impulsion toward rebirth, while for the foe-destroyer there is an absenceof the afflictions that take control of the impelled. Since becoming is treatedhere as a further development of the original effect of impulsion due to theinfluence of the establishing factors, this account sees the links as a singlecausal sequence.In fact, [from Asaṅga’s explanation onward,] these different presentations ofcausality all agree on the following. The habitual tendencies of the karmicactions that are motivated by ignorance become nourished by craving andgrasping. This, in turn, leads to becoming. Thereby, name and form and otherfactors arise. It is with respect to the manifest establishment of these thatone speaks of birth, aging, and death. Thus, they all concur in treating thelinks as one single instance of cause and effect. This sequence is explained interms of the karmic effects that will be experienced in the subsequent life.Hence, this single causal sequence unfolds over the course of two lives.One may then wonder: “Well, is that which is directly established by theconsciousness or becoming of this life not birth into the intermediate state?How are the causes and effects of karmic accumulation to be classified withrespect to that state?”It is inappropriate to reply here that since [in the intermediate state one] isa corporeal being associated with the next life, [that state] should beconsidered included in the next life. Instead, it is taught that since [theintermediate state] is not matured, as is the case with a dream, it is not to beclassified in terms of [past and future lives] at all.One may likewise wonder: “Well, when the linking between two lives in their owndistinct realm occurs, which of those two realms do these causes and effectsthen pertain to?”Apart from ignorance, all the other links belong to the realm that one is beingborn into. Nine types of linking are possible with respect to the three realms,three of which involve birth in the realm of desire. In all the latter threecases, ignorance will pertain to the level of the resultant desire realm itself,regardless of where one is being born from. The reason is that the two higherrealms are free from the desire that is characteristic of the lower realm.Therefore, no accumulation of the action that leads to rebirth in the realm ofdesire occurs in the higher realms. When being born from the realm of desireinto one of the higher realms, the ignorance that is involved is still that ofthe desire realm because, since the higher realms have not yet been achieved,there is no presence of the ignorance that accumulates the action associatedwith those realms. Moreover, when one’s rebirth involves a passage between theformless and the form realm, or when a descent occurs in relation to theconcentrations and formless states, that which impels is seen to pertain to adifferent level than [the one one emerges from].Turning Back CriticismTurning back criticism involves the objections that (1) the enumeration of thelinks cannot be definitive, (2) their sequence is untenable, and (3) they cannotreasonably be the same or different.The Objection That the Enumeration Is Not DefinitiveAs for the first, it may be argued: “Unless ignorance has a cause and aging anddeath have a result, cyclic existence will end up having a beginning and an end.If, on the other hand, those links themselves have causes and effects, thenumber of links ends up higher than stated. Moreover, why are grief and the fourother negative consequences of cyclic existence not counted? And why is theabidance that is a characteristic of the conditioned not enumerated?”Ignorance per se is the cause of delusion with respect to self and mereentities. From the beginning, it has never been absent. Hence, the cause ofignorance is precisely the previous manifestation of the continuity of this typeof delusion. For this reason, the cause of ignorance is not counted separately.Thus, it is taught:> The view of self does not need to be produced;> It is a habit without beginning.220 Some sūtras explain incorrect [mental activity] to be the cause of ignorance,but such accounts consider this factor to be what develops the particularitiesof ignorance and causes them to increase. In the context of the causalitybetween the links, incorrect mental activity is not taught to be the cause ofignorance. As Asaṅga and his brother explain, the reason for this is that therelationship between ignorance and incorrect mental activity is similar to thatbetween ignorance and formation. That is to say, it is not the end of incorrectmental activity that stops ignorance, but the end of ignorance that stopsincorrect mental activity.It is, moreover, not aging and death as such that produce rebirth. Rather, onetakes rebirth because of the present life’s action of becoming. Cyclic existenceis, thus, not interrupted because until defiling cognitions have been exhausted,the effects of actions will be continuous, just like ripples on water.Also, the statement that “from seven arise three,” as well as the account ofmutual causality, is simply meant to show that there will be ignorance in thesubsequent life. If sensation and so on, along with aging and death, couldthemselves produce ignorance on their own, this would absurdly have to be thecase for the noble ones too. If the statement is taken to concern the continuityof mere objects of observation, it will follow that each of the causes of thelinks would be the causes of the other ones as well. Therefore, in a singlecausal sequence, ignorance is the cause, while aging and death are the effect.This is why the scriptures explain that two of the twelve links are definitivelycause and effect, while the other ten are not. Grief and the other factors arenot certain to occur and abidance is not a cause of sadness. Hence, theseelements are not treated as links.The Objection That the Sequence Is UntenableIt may be objected: “If the definitive nature of the enumeration of the links isaccounted for by seeing them as a single sequence of cause and effect, where sixlinks are causes and six are results, then the sequence that appears in thesūtras cannot be definitive because there the links occur in a threefold causalsequence.”Indeed, this may be so, but if craving and so forth were taught to be subsequentto their causes, ignorance and formation, they would be lacking causes. Hence,it is explained that formation energizes consciousness, thus impelling name andform and the next three links. Therefore, while no such stages occur once theimpelling power is present, the enumeration of the links explains the stages inthe manifestation of the effect.It might then be argued: “But since the power [to produce] birth, aging, anddeath [would also be present by the force of impulsion], why are those two linksnot taught [to be directly after sensation]?”They are not taught for three reasons. First, the existence of birth, aging, anddeath is nominal. Secondly, craving and so on would become disconnected if thoselinks were taught to be subsequent to birth, aging, and death. Finally, tosummarize the limits of cyclic existence under negative consequences, themanifestation of birth, aging, and death is taught to be last.The Objection That the Links Can Reasonably Be neither the Same nor DistinctLikewise, it may be objected: “Are these twelve links that are definitive interms of both number and sequence substantially the same or substantiallydifferent? If they are the same, they cannot be cause and effect, yet if thesecond is the case, it follows that there may be a stream of being that does notpossess any ignorance and action.”Just as the cause of mind is mind itself, the actual causal factors are eachsubstantially different, yet, in terms of their general classification, thelinks are distinct differentiations of the same essence. Hence, the impliedproblem is entirely irrelevant.As for the link between two lives, this is explained by means of the example ofcrops growing from planted seeds. Concerning the six causal links, it is said:> Action, craving, and ignorance> Are field, moisture, and planting—> Consciousness sows seeds. As for the six effects, they are explained in terms of the arising,transformation, and protection of the sprouts of name and form and so on. In theSūtra on Transference of Existence, the same issue is explained by means ofeight examples. The master Nāgārjuna puts that teaching into verse:> Like a recitation, a candlelight, a mirror, a mold,> A magnifying glass, a seed, sourness, or a sound—> Thus, the wise should see that the linking of the aggregates> Takes place without any transference.221 This can be understood by considering the illustrative properties of theexamples in general, the illustrative properties of each of them individually,and the way that the examples serve to settle dispute. As for the first issue,all of these examples serve to illustrate the way that this life is followed bya future life. A recitation comes into being because of the causes andconditions associated with the teacher and his student all being complete; acandlelight arises based on the wick and fire; a reflection occurs because ofthe face and a mirror; from a mold and some clay comes a cast; because of theglass, light, and some straw, there will be fire; from soil and seed comes asprout; when one has drunk wine and the word “sour” is spoken, saliva willemerge; and because of a sound and the presence of a rock wall, an echo willoccur. All of these are examples of arising due to an assembly of causes andconditions, an arising where the causes are not transferred into their effects,and yet where the effects arise without interruption. This is alsocharacteristic of the way the aggregates of the next life arise due to thecausal complex of action and affliction in this life.Second, the examples can also be seen as illustrations of particular aspects ofthis arising. Thus, the teacher’s teaching a recitation to his studentillustrates the link between the consciousness of this life and the next. Next,just as the prior presence of candlelight makes the subsequent burning ofanother one possible, the causes that are included in this life are notpermanent, and yet the future life is not uncaused. The mirror illustrates howthe existence of this life is the reason that there is another life beyond, andyet without there being any transference between the two lives. The mold showsthe way action shapes the future rebirth. The example of the magnifying glassillustrates the way cause and effect belong to the same class. The seed explainsthat the cessation of this life does not mean nonexistence. Sourness shows thatrebirth occurs because of previously experienced karmic actions. The example ofthe echo shows that rebirth takes place when conducive factors have assembledand obstacles are absent, and that cause and effect are neither identical nordifferent.As for the third issue mentioned above, this concerns the way that thesubsequent examples serve to eliminate errors about the meaning of the previousones. Yet fearing an excess of words, I shall not elaborate on that here.In the Śālu Sprout, moreover, there are four examples: eye consciousness, areflection, the moon, and fire. According to the master Kamalaśīla, theseillustrate how effects ensue from actions that are to be experienced in thislife, upon birth, in other lives, and without certainty, respectively. Thus, heexplains that these examples show the way karmic effects will be experienced inone’s current life, in one’s next life, in some life after that, and at someundetermined point in the future. Thus, impure dependent origination is composedof the three types of thorough affliction and the two truths. From the sixfoldcausal complex of action and affliction arises the sixfold effect associatedwith aging and death. Hence, it is taught:> When the conditions are complete, the machinery of suffering emerges.> This is the machinery of ignorance; it is not exhausted and it does not> increase. As a particular instance of impure dependent origination, it should beunderstood how ignorance with respect to the consequences of actions, theformations of nonvirtue, and the rest of the six causes produces name and formand the five other effects as associated with the lower realms.Pure Dependent OriginationSecond, as for pure dependent origination, this refers to the way thatfoe-destroyers who have exhausted defilements, self-realized buddhas, andbodhisattvas who have gained mastery take birth. For them, the process ofdependent links does not occur as outlined above. Nevertheless, it is taughtthat the habitual tendencies of ignorance serve as a condition that cooperateswith aspirations and causal nondefiling action. These factors lead to theirtaking birth by assuming a body that is of a mental nature, and this body isexplained as disintegrating in inconceivable death and transference. Theimplications of this can be learned from the Lion’s Roar of Śrī Mālā, theJourney to Laṅkā, and the Sūtra Requested by Sāgaramati. Thus, dependentorigination evolves in three ways: as existence in the lower realms, as cyclicexistence, and as pure dependent origination.The Means for Reversing the LinksThe third issue concerns the way to reverse the evolution of the links. Thesupport for this process is a person who possesses any of the three types ofpotential. Following an excellent spiritual friend, such a person must begin byfollowing an exact and complete course of study. Having gone for refuge anddeveloped the wish to achieve his or her particular goal, the student must thenpersist in the process of eliminating ignorance. Ignorance in the form ofdelusion regarding the consequences of actions causes the first of the threeprocesses of dependent origination mentioned above. Ignorance in the form ofdelusion about reality is the cause of the second process. Finally, theignorance associated with the ground of habitual tendencies is the cause of thethird process. The total elimination of all such ignorance brings about theattainment of Buddhahood and the perfection of all excellent qualities.THE PROFUNDITY OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION Second, it is taught that there are five profound distinctions of dependentorigination: Unless a cause has ceased, its effect will not occur. Hence, thereis no permanence. The arising of an effect follows without interruption from thecessation of its cause. Thus, there is no annihilation. Different classes ofexistence manifest one after the other. Therefore, there is no transference.Since great effects arise from small causes, cause and effect are not equal.Virtuous actions unfailingly cause pleasure while nonvirtuous actions bringpain. Thus, the effects that occur resemble their causes. Because these issuesare difficult to comprehend, they are referred to as “profound distinctions.”REALIZATION OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION The third issue concerns the magnificent qualities associated with therealization of dependent origination. While the sūtras and treatises explainnumerous such qualities, they can be summarized into the following three. As onecomes to see everything as workable, understanding how causality does notdeviate or deceive, one gains confidence in the teachings and faith in theTeacher. Secondly, with the realization that, conventionally, things originatein dependence, while their nature is devoid of arising, one will abandon theextremes of permanence and annihilation, as well as onesided views of existenceand nonexistence. Thus, one will gain access to the relative and ultimatetruths. Finally, knowing the means for reversing the process by which the linksunfold, one will eliminate the three types of causal ignorance by practicing therelevant remedy. This will accomplish the aims of the three individuals.This concludes the explanation of the twenty-sixth chapter, the analysis of thelinks of existence, in from the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root ofthe Middle Way.210.

Heart of Dependent Origination, 5."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN"},{"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF VIEWSThe analysis of views also addresses three issues.THE CONTEXT OF CHAPTER 27 First, regarding the context, the chapter’s relation to the profound sūtras canbe seen by considering the following passage from the Śālu Sprout Sūtra:> The one who truly sees dependent origination as it is does not depend on the> extremes of past and future, or on the present. Thus, this chapter replies to the query: “What is dependence on the extremes ofpast and future, and how does one not depend on those?”As for the chapter’s relation to the other analyses, at this point we may hearthe author inform us: In this manner, I have accurately explained that while itsdistinctive properties are, ultimately, emptiness beyond all mental constructs,dependent origination occurs in terms of the relative. The present chapterteaches the fruition of this realization, the attainment of the nonabidingtranscendence of suffering through the relinquishment of all views.THE CONTENT OF CHAPTER 27 The explanation of the chapter’s content includes (1) identifying the objects ofnegation, the sixteen views that are based on the extremes of past and future,and (2) showing how the person who has realized dependent origination does notrely on such views.THE SIXTEEN VIEWS On the first issue, the treatise states:> Past existence and nonexistence,> A permanent world, and so forth—> These views depend> On the extreme of the past. [XXVII.1] > The views of existence and nonexistence> At a different time in the future,> Of the end of the world, and so forth> Depend on the extreme of the future. [XXVII.2] One may believe that the self existed in the past, that it did not, that it bothdid and did not, or that neither were the case. Likewise, one may believe thatthe world of the self and the aggregates is permanent, impermanent, bothpermanent and impermanent, or that it is neither. All of the views included inthese two sets of four depend on the extreme of the past because, based on theobservation of the self alone and the self along with the aggregates,respectively, they take the form of beliefs in past existence, nonexistence,both, and neither.Moreover, one may believe that, at a different time in the future, the self willexist, not exist, both exist and not exist, or that neither will be the case.Likewise, it may be held that the world of the self and the aggregates isfinite, infinite, both, or neither. These two sets of four views are dependenton the extreme of the future because, based on the observation of the self aloneand both the self and the aggregates, respectively, they manifest as beliefs infuture existence, nonexistence, both, and neither.HOW THE REALIZATION OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION PRECLUDES SUCH VIEWS The second issue includes showing how (1) although dependent origination isaccepted in terms of the relative, one will not rely on such views and (2) therewill be no such reliance because, in reality, the appropriated, theappropriator, and so forth are all entirely devoid of establishment. The firstsection contains (1) a refutation of the views based on the self and (2) arefutation of the views based on the self and aggregates in general. The firstof these two issues will include (1) refuting the views that pertain to the fouroptions, such as past existence, and (2) showing how this also invalidates thefour options in terms of future existence and so forth. The treatment of thefirst of these two issues begins with a refutation of the view that the selfexisted in the past. This refutation involves (1) stating the argument and (2)proving it.Stating the ArgumentOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Saying “It existed in the past”> Indeed, does not make sense.> Whatever occurred in past lives> Is not the same as this. [XXVII.3] The idea that “the self existed in the past” does not make sense because theself that was in hell in previous lives is not the same as the present humanself. In scripture we do find statements such as, “At that time, I was theuniversal monarch by the name of Mahāsammata.” Yet, such statements are simplydenials of difference. They are not affirmations of sameness. Hence, there is noconflict, for what is implied is that “he was not someone else.”Proving the ArgumentOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If you think, “That itself is the self,”> The appropriated would be different.> Apart from appropriated,> What is this self of yours? [XXVII.4] > It does not make sense for there to be> A self that is different from the appropriated.> If different, it could reasonably be perceived> In the absence of appropriation, yet it cannot. [XXVII.7] > When it is held that there is no self> Apart from the appropriated,> If the appropriated is itself the self,> Your self does not exist. [XXVII.5] > The appropriated is not the self,> For it arises and disintegrates.> How could the appropriated> Ever be the appropriator? [XXVII.6] > Thus, it is not other than appropriation,> Nor are these two the same.> The self does not exist without appropriation,> Yet neither can it be ascertained as nonexistent. [XXVII.8] It may be objected: “Your argument is not established because it is preciselythe self of the past that has now become the self of this human being in thepresent.”If this were the case, there would not be any difference between the aggregatesthat in the past were appropriated in hell and those presently beingappropriated as a human being. Yet those two appropriations are different interms of what caused them, the time at which they occur, and their features.Hence, they are essentially different, so it does not make sense for there to bea single self that appropriates them both.It might then be argued: “These appropriations occur at different times, but whyshould that contradict the notion that the appropriating self is one and thesame?”If there were a self that is distinct from what it appropriates, then what,apart from the appropriations, is this self of yours? If the self is differentfrom the appropriated aggregates, it follows that it would be independent ofthem, and the causes for the designation of self would then be absent.Below, it is further explained how it would not make sense for the self to bedifferent from what it appropriates. If there were such a difference, it wouldbe perceptible, and we could then reasonably expect to apprehend the self in theabsence of the appropriated aggregates, just as we may apprehend a blanket wherethere is no vase. Therefore, because no such self can be apprehended, it doesnot exist apart from the appropriated, and so there cannot be a single self thatis involved in a series of appropriations.As a supplementary topic, it is explained that when it is said that there is noself apart from the appropriated, certain members of our own tradition may arguethat the appropriated is indeed the self. Yet the characteristics that theyascribe to the self do not then have any existence. Why? Because the aggregates,which they believe to entail the self, are characterized by arising anddisintegration, while the self is thought to be permanent and singular. Thus,since their characteristics are incompatible, the aggregates cannot be identicalto the self.Moreover, how could the appropriated ever be the appropriator? This would meanthat object and agent were one, and nothing can take itself as an object. Thecutter would, for example, then be identical with what it cuts, and this isabsurd.To conclude, the self is not different from what it appropriates because theself cannot be observed separate from the aggregates and because it would thenhave no cause. Yet the self is not the same as what it appropriates eitherbecause, according to such a view, the self would end up impermanent andmultiple, and object and agent would become one and the same. The self does notexist independent of what it appropriates because it cannot be observed as such.Consequently, it might be thought that the self is completely nonexistent, justlike the son of a barren woman. Yet since, in terms of the relative, the self isimputed based on the aggregates, it cannot be ascertained to be nonexistenteither.The View That the Self Did Not Exist in the PastSecond, the refutation of the view that the self did not exist in the pastinvolves (1) stating the argument and (2) proving it.Stating the ArgumentOn the first issue, the treatise states:> Saying “It did not exist in the past,”> Does not make sense either.> Whatever was there in past lives> Is not different from this. [XXVII.9] Neither does it make sense to say that the self did not exist in the pastbecause the self that was in hell in past lives is not different in essence fromthe self of the present human life.Proving the ArgumentOn the second issue, the treatise states:> If it were something other,> It could arise even in its absence.> Likewise, that would remain> And there could be birth without death there. [XXVII.10] > There would be annihilation, action would be wasted,> The action done by one> Would be experienced by another—> These and other flaws would ensue. [XXVII.11] > Something previously nonexistent does not arise> Because flaws would follow:> The self would be a product> And its arising would lack a cause. [XXVII.12] If the argument’s establishment is questioned, it will be explained that werethe present human self something other than the past self in hell, it would bepointless for these two to be dependent on one another, just like a vase and ablanket are not mutually dependent. The present self could then arise even inthe absence of a past self. Likewise, just as a vase may arise without itsoccurrence necessitating the destruction of the blanket, the present human selfcould arise while the past self in hell continued to remain. Just as the blanketmay arise without the vase having ceased, there could be birth in this lifewithout the past self having died in a past life.Moreover, if the past and present selves were different, this would mean thatwhen the human self exists in the present, the past self of hell has beenannihilated. If this is accepted, it will follow that action would go to wastebecause, at the time of the impelling action, the ripened effect is not present,and when the effect is experienced, the self of the agent would have beenannihilated. If it is then held that pleasant and painful effects of virtuousand nonvirtuous actions performed by the former self will be experienced by thesubsequent self, this means that the action created by one person will beexperienced by another. If that is accepted, more flaws will ensue. Actionswould be performed in vain because their effects would not be experienced by theagent that performs them. On the other hand, people would have to fear theconsequences of actions that they never engaged in, including those withimmediate effects.It might then be thought: “The selves are different in substance, yet of thesame continuum. Hence, these flaws are irrelevant.”Yet that is not correct either. As was explained before, there is no continuumthat is essentially different from the substances of which it is composed.If the present self were different from the past self, it would, furthermore, bea previously nonexistent self that is born into this life. Yet that cannot beargued because various flaws would ensue. How so? The self would then be a newlyproduced product. If the self were such a product, then the self that is bornhere will not have been preceded by the self of the agent and will be lackingits cause. The arising of an uncaused self is similar to the notion of therebeing a child of a barren woman. Since such an assertion is nonsensical, itshould not be accepted that the self arises without having existed before.Summarizing Refutation of Both and NeitherThe third section presents a summarizing refutation of the remainingalternatives, both and neither. The treatise states:> Thus, that the self existed, did not exist,> That it both existed and did not,> Or neither existed nor did not exist—> These views on the past are untenable. [XXVII.13] Thus, that the self existed, that it did not exist, that it both existed and didnot, or that it neither existed nor did not exist—these views regarding the pastare untenable. Combined existence and nonexistence is not feasible given thateach of these options is itself impossible. Meanwhile, the negation of both isnot correct either, given that the objects of negation are not established.The Implicit Invalidation of the Views with Respect to Future Existence and soForthSecond, showing the implicit invalidation of the four views that pertain tofuture existence and so on, the treatise states:> The views that “it will exist> At a different time in the future,”> Or that, “it will not exist in the future,”> Are equal to those about the past. [XXVII.14] The views that the self will exist at some different time in the future, that itwill not exist, that it both will and will not, and that neither is the case canbe refuted in the same way as the views that concern the self’s past existenceand so forth. Thus, with the appropriate changes we get:> Saying “It will exist in the future,”> Indeed, does not make sense.> Whatever will be in future lives> Is not the same as this. This can also be applied to the remaining arguments.Refutation of Views Based on Self and Aggregates in GeneralThe second issue is the refutation of the views that are based on [the self andaggregates] in general. This includes a refutation of beliefs in the fouralternatives associated with (1) permanence and so forth and (2) finitude and soon. The first section includes (1) specific refutations and (2) a generalrefutation. Concerning the first, there are four specific refutations.Refutation of a Permanent Self and AggregatesFirst, refuting the notion of permanence, the treatise states:> If the god were the human,> It would be permanent.> The god would be unborn,> For the permanent has no birth. [XXVII.15] If the self and aggregates associated with the future birth of a god wereidentical with the present self and aggregates of a human being, then thefactors associated with the god would be permanent, in the sense that they alsoexisted before. The self and aggregates associated with the god and human are,however, not identical. Hence, it does not make sense for them to be permanent.Furthermore, if the god were permanent in this way, it would also be unborn.This is entailed because the permanent has prior existence and cannot beconsidered previously nonexistent. Hence, it knows no birth.Refutation of ImpermanenceSecond, refuting impermanence, the treatise states:> If the god were different from the human,> It would be impermanent.> If god and human were different,> There could not reasonably be one stream of being. [XXVII.16] If the future divine self and aggregates were different from the present humanself and aggregates, the factors associated with the god would be impermanentfactors without any prior existence. Yet since the two sets of factors are notdifferent, there could not reasonably be any such impermanence or absence ofpast existence. The self and aggregates that are associated with the god and thehuman are not established as different in substance because if they were, theycould not reasonably make up one single stream of being, in the same way thatMaitreya and Upagupta do not constitute the same continuum. Hence, since it isasserted that they do form a single stream of being, they cannot be different insubstance.Refutation of Both Permanence and ImpermanenceThird, refuting the combination of permanence and impermanence, the treatisestates:> If one part were divine> And another part human,> It would be permanent and impermanent.> That is not reasonable either. [XXVII.17] Let us then assume that one part of the god’s self and aggregates is divine, inthe sense that with respect to this part humanity has been relinquished, whileanother part of its self and the aggregates remains identical with the pasthuman. One part of the god’s state would then be permanent and existent frombefore, whereas another part would be impermanent with no prior existence. Thiswould contradict the god and the human’s being the same in essence. Therefore,since it does not make sense for the self and aggregates to have a separate partthat is human, these two cannot reasonably be both permanent and impermanent.Refutation of the Denial of BothFourth, refuting the denial of both permanence and impermanence, the treatisestates:> If permanent and impermanent> Were both established,> It would be possible to establish> The neither permanent nor impermanent. [XXVII.18] If the objects of negation, the permanent and the impermanent, were bothestablished, it would be possible to negate them, thus establishing that whichis neither permanent nor impermanent. Yet, as they have already been refuted,these two neganda are not established. The denial and negation of these two is,therefore, not established either.General RefutationOffering a general refutation, the treatise states:> If something came somewhere from somewhere> And then would go somewhere else,> Then cyclic existence would have no beginning,> Yet that is not the case. [XXVII.19] > When nothing is permanent,> What could be impermanent?> Permanence, impermanence,> And both have been dismissed [XXVII.20] It may be argued: “Something has been wandering in cyclic existence since timewithout beginning, and that something is also observed now. There-fore, the onethat cycles throughout cyclic existence is permanent.”If something—a formation or a person—came somewhere from somewhere in the pastand were then to go somewhere else in the future, there would be cyclicexistence without beginning. Yet there is no such coming and going, neither of aperson nor of formations, because the going and coming of both the permanent andthe impermanent have already been refuted. That is to say, since cyclicexistence is not established, there is nothing permanent that cycles. What,then, could be qualified by impermanence, by the negation of the former quality?Both permanence and impermanence, as well as the negation of these two (sincethe objects of negation are not established), have hereby been dismissed.Refutation of the Finite and so ForthThe refutation of beliefs in the four alternatives associated with finitude andso forth will include (1) a refutation of finitude and infinitude, (2) arefutation of their combination, and (3) a refutation of the denial of both. Thefirst of these sections contains arguments based on (1) the existence of otherworlds and (2) continuous arising and disintegration.Argument Based on the Existence of Other WorldsOn the first issue, the treatise states:> If the world had an end,> How could there be another world?> If the world had no end,> How could there be another world? [XXVII.21] If the world of the present self and aggregates had an end, and so would beannihilated, how could there be another world? Indeed, that would be impossible.Therefore, since there are other worlds, the present self and aggregates cannotbe finite and subject to annihilation. Moreover, if the world of the self andaggregates does not have an end and is inexhaustible, how could there be anotherworld? Indeed, there could not. Therefore, because there are other worlds, thepresent one cannot be infinite and inexhaustible.Argument from Continuous Arising and DisintegrationOn the second issue, the treatise states:> This continuity of the aggregates> Is just like an oil lamp’s light.> Hence, neither finitude> Nor infinitude makes sense. [XXVII.22] > If the previous were to cease,> And if, based on these aggregates,> Those aggregates would not arise,> The world would have an end. [XXVII.23] > If the previous were not to cease,> And if, based on these aggregates,> Those aggregates would not arise,> The world would be endless. [XXVII.24] Moreover, the continuity that the aggregates partake of throughout past andfuture is just like the light of an oil lamp. As previous instances of lightcease, subsequent instances arise. The same is the case with the aggregates, forsubsequent instances arise without interruption once the previous instancescease. Therefore, it does not make sense to think in terms of finitude andannihilation or infinitude and inexhaustible permanence.To elaborate, if the previous aggregates were to cease and then not serve as thecause for the aggregates that subsequently arise as a result, as is the casewith the foe-destroyer’s final moment of mind, the world would indeed have anend. Yet subsequent aggregates follow based on the previous aggregates. Hence,the world is not finite. Likewise, if the previous aggregates did not cease, andif, hence, the resultant, subsequent aggregates did not arise on the basis ofthe causal, previous aggregates, the world of the cause would be endless.Therefore, since the causal, previous aggregates do cease, the world is notinfinite.Refutation of Combined Finitude and InfinitudeSecond, refuting their combination, the treatise states:> If one part were finite> And another part infinite,> The world would and would not have an end.> This does not make sense either. [XXVII.25] > How could one part> Of the appropriator be destroyed> And another part not be destroyed.> This does not make sense. [XXVII.26] > How could one part> Of the appropriated be destroyed> And another part not be destroyed?> That does not make sense either. [XXVII.27] If one part of self and aggregates were to be destroyed, being finite, whileanother part were not, being infinite, then the world would and would not havean end. But since self and aggregates cannot reasonably be half destroyed andhalf not destroyed, it is not the case that the world is both finite andinfinite.How so? Well, would it be the self or the aggregates that are half destroyed andhalf not destroyed? If it is the self, then how could one part of theappropriator be destroyed and another part not? There is no argument that cansupport such an account. Moreover, this would mean that one half is the human ofthe past, while the other half is no longer human but a god, or that one halfhas disintegrated, while the other half has not. Yet that is not feasible withrespect to a single essence. And again, when we search the aggregates for theself in the fivefold way, we do not find one. It is, therefore, not reasonablefor one half of the self to be destroyed and the other half not.Given the second option, how could one part of the appropriated be destroyed andthe other half not? There is no proof to support such a position, and a singleessence cannot be both permanent and impermanent. Finally, since the aggregatesthemselves have already been refuted, it is not reasonable for one half of theaggregates to be destroyed and not the other.Refutation of the Denial of BothOn the third issue, the treatise states:> If the finite and infinite> Were both established,> It would be possible to establish> The neither finite nor infinite. [XXVII.28] If the objects of negation, the finite and the infinite, were both established,it would be possible to negate them and establish that which is neither. Yet asthese two neganda, the finite and the infinite, have already been refuted andshown to have no establishment, the negative phenomenon that is neither of themcannot be established either.Ultimate Lack of Establishment> Thus, in terms of the relative, we may assert illusion-like dependent> origination, where cause and effect are not the same, yet not different> either. None of the sixteen views are appropriate in this context. Having> explained how that is so, it will next be shown that since, in reality, the> self, the aggregates, and so on are all not established themselves, all> specific views about them are inappropriate as well. The treatise states:> Alternately, because all things are empty,> How could views of permanence and so on,> Occur in any form, anywhere,> And to anyone at all? [XXVII.29] Alternatively, as explained above, all things originate dependently and are,therefore, empty of nature, like reflections. What, then, would be the reasonfor views of permanence and so on to occur in any form, at any place, and toanyone at all? Similarly, there is no reason for views about the sharpness ordullness of donkey horns to occur in any form, at any place, to anyone at all.CONCLUDING HOMAGE The meaning of the profound teaching of dependent origination free from allmental constructs has here been flawlessly explained, along with the fruition ofrealization. Knowing this to be the kindness of the Teacher, the Master now payshomage by rejoicing in the Teacher’s explanation:> By the love of his heart, he accepts us> And, so that all views may be relinquished,> Reveals the sacred Dharma.> To the teacher, Gautama, I prostrate. [XXVII.30] The words “I prostrate” present the basis for distinctions, an act of reverencein body, speech, and mind. To whom is this prostration made? To Gautama, thevictorious Śākyamuni, who was born into the royal line of Gotama. Thedistinctive qualities of this object of veneration are found in his revealingthe sacred Dharma, the peace of dependent origination that is, in reality, freefrom arising, ceasing, and all other such constructs. The Dharma that he teachesprotects us from the abyss of all views, such as those that cherish peace andregard existence as something to reject. This Dharma is sacred insofar as it isenjoyed by those who are sacred and noble, and it is the supreme Dharma, in thatit saves one from the extremes of existence and peace and is worthy of praise.The purpose of this teaching is to facilitate the relinquishment of all views,such as the sixteen described before, and thereby to eliminate the universalroot of all faults. What is the motivation behind this teaching? The teaching isgiven out of the acceptance of nonreferential love because realizing dependentorigination, which is devoid of essential nature, is the remedy against thereification that lies at the root of all suffering. As is taught:> For those possessed by the demon of reification,> This is the supreme healing. This concludes the explanation of the twenty-seventh chapter, the analysis ofviews, in the Ornament of Reason, a commentary on the Root of the Middle Way."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/00005.jpg]THE MEANING OF THE POSTSCRIPT> This treatise on the Middle Way, the Root of Insight, is the vajra speech> Of the noble son of the Victorious Ones, prophesied by the Lord of the Able.> By means of the instructions transmitted in the lineage of the masters of> scripture and reasoning,> And with the eye of intelligent discernment, I have here clearly explained the> import of this scripture. > At the request of bright and committed individuals,> And with the wish to be of benefit, this work has been well composed.> By the merit that ensues, may all wanderers enter this path of the collection> of genuine reasoning,> And, by the pacification of all ignorance and construction, thus attain the> supreme stage.
