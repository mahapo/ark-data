To synthesize these teachings, there are two categories: the causal vehicle of characteristics and the vajra vehicle of Secret Mantra. In the vajra vehicle of Secret Mantra, there are two divisions: the common outer tamras and the uncommon inner tantras. The inner tantras are the three categories of generation-stage Mahayoga,' completion-stage Anuyoga,d and the great perfection-stage Atiyoga.< The tantra of the Glorious Secret Essence primarily belongs to the category of Mahayoga. It is taught that, among the distinctions within Mahayoga, namely the great accomplish­ment practices of the eight herukas and the eighteen classes of the great tantras, this Secret Essence Tantra extracts the essence of them all, as well as being the general tantra of enlightened mind.

Just by listening to this profound subject, it is certain that one's mind will be released from its strong hold on ordinary phenomena, needless to men­tion the benefits of practice. I have been the recipient of tremendous kindness expressed to me by many great incarnate masters from whom I received this [Secret Essence] empowerment, the corresponding commentaries, and pith oral instruc­tions many times. These masters, who are equal to the Buddha, include Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Kyabje Drupwang Penor Rinpoche, Kyabje Jigme Phuntsok Jungney Rinpoche, and the great dzogchen khenpo, Thubten Ts ondri.i Phuntsok. I have also accomplished the requisite mantra accumulations fo r the peaceful and wrathful deities of this mal)gala and have carefully contem­plated the inner meaning of this teaching many times over. In order co ensure chat the sacred lineage of this tanrra will spread throughout time and space, I have opened the door to these teachings in several loca­tions around the world and have built the great support and supported maQQala of deities in locations where they were previously nonexistent. Most importantly, when I really consider that, fo r most of my adult life, I have been inseparable from this profound tanrra, I fe el an overwhelming sense of heartfelt joy and gratitude. Also, when I began to teach this subject to Westerners, Sangye Khandro and Lama Chonam joined me by tirelessly serving as the translators. Under my direction, they have translated not only this commentary, Essence of Clear Light, but also Key to the Precious Treasury' by Dodrupchen Jigme Te npa'i Nyima and the Omniscient Longchenpa's word-for-word com­mentary entitled the Thorough Dispelling oJDarkness throughout the Ten Directioni into the English language so that future generations will have the opportunity to learn chis tantra.

Among them, the tantra of the Magical Ma nifestation Ma trix: the Secret Essence, is consid­ered the general tantra of enlightened mind. Many of the greatest accom­plished scholars and practitioners of the past have composed extensive and brief commentaries based upon this cancra. This commentary entitled Essence of Clear Light was composed by the great chakravarrin ruler of scholarship and accomplishments, the actual emanation ofManjushri, Mipham Jam pal Gyepa'i Dorje, who was born in the Western year of 18462 and lived to be sixty-seven years of age, passing on in 1911, the Year of the Male Water Rat. Mipham Rinpoche's writing is generally based on oral instructions from lineage vidyadharas and, in particular, the wisdom intent ofboth the omniscient masters Rongzompa and Longchenpa. Not only that, through his own impeccable logic, he composed this excellent commentary as an overview of Longchenpa's extensive treatise entitled 1horough Dispelling of Darkness throughout the Ten Directions. Essence of Clear Light has many special fe atures, such as being extremely clear and easy to understand, while at the same time illuminating all the crucial points of the entire path of Secret Mantra Vajrayana. The teachings contained in Essence of Clear Light are not only useful fo r dharma practice in general, but especially applicable fo r the practice of the three innermost yogas of Secret Mantra. For that application, there are the eleven topics well known throughout the reaching of tanrra that are clearly elucidated in this text. The topics are: • gyutrul drawa (s gyu 'phrul drva ba}"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT the nature as it is-the view, immovablc-samadhi, fo rsaking the pass­conduct, the array-ma1Jdala, traversing the stages-empowerment, not transgressing-samaya, pursuing the goal-accomplishment, presenta­tion to the places-ojjerings, the manifestation-enlightened activity, binding-mudrd, and recitation-mantra. These topics are the crucial points of the path t!lrough which the common and supreme siddhis3 are brought to fr uition. As Mipham Rinpoche points out in this commen­tary, if these topics arc not understood, then there is no other method through which the final result on the path can be achieved. In brief, this excellent text brings an undeniable understanding that all dualistic phenomena arising fr om the ignorance of grasping and fixating are primordially pure as the truth of inseparable purity and evenness, or the great dharmakaya.b Aside fr om realizing this view, there is no other method through which to receive the genuine wisdom transmission of rhe lineage of the vidyadhara masters. It is fo r these reasons that we have attempted this translation under the guidance and aurhorization ofKhen Rinpoche Namdrol, who kindly granted the empowerment, transmission, and explanation of this com­mentary several times. Khen Rinpoche Namdrol received the transmis­sions fo r the Gu.hyagarbha Ta 1ztra, including this commentary, from his master, Choje Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche. Khen Rinpoche Namdrol journeyed ro Golog, Tibet in 1988 with the aspiration to not only meet Choje bur, specifically, to receive all the transmissions fo r this cancra and its commentaries. Upon arriving at Larung Gar, the encamp­ment of Choje and his fo llowing of thousands of disciples, Khen Rin­pochc Namdrol's prayers were answered as he was able to receive all the cmpowermenrs, transmissions, and teachings over the course of the fo l­lowing year. Choje Jigme Phumsok Rinpochc was born in 1933, and immediately after birth he sat upright without assistance and draped the placenta over his left shoulder just as a monk would wear his robe. He then opened his eyes and began to recite the heart mantra of Manjushri, om ah ra pa tsa na dh i. Based on a number of signs, Choje was recognized as an incarnation ofTerron Lerab Lingpa, and at the age of seven he began finding recep­tacles containing treasure teachings hidden by Guru Padmasambhava in 'ngo driip (dngos grub); �ctual attainment h chii ku (chossku); enlightened body of truth"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"TRANSLATORS' NOTE 7 the eighth century. Choje always had profound devotion fo r Ju Mipham Rinpoche and spent his entire life reciting a supplication prayer to him, as well as practicing meditation based upon a manual written by Mipham Rinpoche on the subject of Mahasandhi. • Choje always claimed this was the reason why he was able to overcome many obstacles in his life and fu lfill his duties to Padmasambhava as his representative. As a young man Choje traveled to the Dzachuka region of Tibet to meet and study with the great scholar-hermit Thubten Chopel, who was a heart disciple ofMipham Rinpoche. It was from this great master that Choje received the Guhyagarbha transmissions in their entirety. The life story of this great master, who was himself an emanation ofMafi.jushr'i, is remarkable. Choje's enlightened mind passed into the basic space of phe­nomenab in January 2.004, and his lineage continues through the many highly realized disciples that carry on his legacy of teachings. It has been our great fo rtune to study under one of his principal dis­ciples, Khen Rinpoche Namdrol, who is a perfect example of the teach­ings that he so expertly transmits. We want to emphasize the importance of receiving the lineage blessings prior to reading or attempting to study this commentary, since this level of dharma belongs to the highest cycle of unsurpassed inner Secret Mantra. Empowerment fo r the peaceful and wrathful deities from the kama or terma lineage and a reading transmis­sion for this commentary must both be received. Once receiving em pow· erment, if one wishes to keep a copy of this precious teaching on one's shrine as an object of devotion, that is also acceptable. It is our sincere hope that all interested practitioners will carefully maintain the dignity of honoring the wisdom lineage tradition. We confess all shortcomings and any errors that may have occurred in the course of this translation and welcome any improvements or sugges­tions that would be of value to the pure dissemination of this tamra. Our only concern is to serve the doctrine and sentient beings, and to that end the merit accumulated through this effort is dedicated to the long life of the lineage masters, the firm presence of the doctrine in this world, and the liberation of parent sentient beings.

For example, [the tantra] that clearly reveals the magical body is the Guhyasamdja,\" the tantra emphasizing clear light is the Chakrasaf!Zvara, band the cancra emphasizing the wisdom of union is the Kalachakra.• Given chat the Kala chakra is said to be a nondual cancra exclusively emphasizing that which is being illustrated, namely, the genu­ine wisdom of union, it is referred to as the neutral state ofVajrasattva. Consequently, within the Nyingma� scriptures on mantra, Mahayoga itself is divided into three [classes], namely, the Maha of Maha, 10 and so fo rth. I.2 The Essential Profound, Uncommon Ta ntras Second, according to the profound, uncommon, specific approach, there are also two: the tantric classes of the vast and those of the profound. For the first, there are the well-known great tantras of the eighteen classes.11 Among them, the basis or very essence is this Secret Essence Tantra. If one wonders why these tantras are so uncommon and profound, it is because in order to unerringly comprehend the crucial wisdom intent of all inner classes of Secret Mantra these are the tantras that must be relied upon. Although all categories of unsurpassed mantra are similar in how they bring [aspirants] to maturity through the fo ur empowerments and how the key points are internalized through the path of the two stages, the majority of tantras tend to only teach the practice of deity and mantra, as well as the methods that emphasize the crucial point of the channels, winds, and essential fluids' of the completion stage. In truth, the crucial point fo r all of those practices lies in knowing the view of the great purity and evenness of phenomenal existence and the manner through which genuine wisdom is directly introduced through illustration. That which is otherwise hidden within the vajra words is clearly illuminated in these tantras.

Hence, that cancra is referred to as \"that which opens the precious vessel ofbuddhahood.\" This occurs as fo llows. The essence of the path of the vajra vehicle is the wis­dom of the fo urth empowerment. Other vehicles merely state \"the fo urth resembles that\" and hint at this during the third empowerment without openly revealing it. Consequently, some Indian masters teaching these tantras assumed that the wisdom of the fo urth empowerment amounted to the mere bliss of union, the mind fr ee of attachment, the theory of emptiness, and the like. These assumptions are clearly refuted in the Com­mentary on the Seven Aspects ofUn ion,' Indrabhiiti's Proving Wi sdom, b and other texts. Even these days in Tibd there are many charlatans who disparage upadeshas that introduce the wisdom of the fo urth [empowerment] by asserting that newly uniting the fe eling of bliss with notions of emptiness constitutes the connated and so fo rth. That is why the Ka lachakr-a Tantra addresses the issue of the genuine connate being illustrated, namely, the nondual wisdom kaya of unchanging bliss and emptiness that possesses the supreme of all aspects:·12 This all-pervasive, spacelike vajra nature that transcends the phenomena of substance and mind is clearly illuminated in that tantra [i.e., Ka lachakra] itself as well as in its commentary P1·oving Wisdom and others. Since this is a sacred upadesha, it must permeate the crucial wisdom intent of all classes of tantra. It is fo r this reason there is the well-known quote: A tantra must be known through other tantras. Given that this great tantra openly reveals the crucial points of the view and meditation of unsurpassed mantra and precisely determines the genuine wisdom intent of the entire Vajrayana vehicle, it is the single most precious jewel within the three worlds. This king of all tantras possesses superb qualities such as being the pin­nacle of all vehicles, the source of all doctrines, the general commentary on all scriptures, the great swift path of all buddhas, and the sacred goal a khajot dungyl drelwa (kha sbyor bdun g;•i 'grel ba) b yeshe d1·iip (ye shes grub) 'sil den (bsilldan); an epithet fo r Tibet d !hen kye (than skyes, sahaja); connate, coemergent ' nam kun chog den g]'i tong pa ny id (mam kun mchog !dan gyi stong pa nyid)"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":". . . . tit if i.r � � ir rtf � � � � l{!l11fl � ��Gl!.tlf• �if GlP !P' u ir? if qr i< �� 1:7\"\" l< !3\" u � � � .;lti) i1f [J tit C!{ Er Ill ir }f3\" -8? ir '� in> '� }!J }g r.;;;:::_ � .;u K kJ 10 · iJ;;!l � if . ·� f7 !J' !J\" _ (� f7 � · }� ll � !J\" L( fl£ &.r .;(! i.t;::!l ltC) � io -t() lf � ci:! � lET\"\" iu if io II£ k'l -rf6 � !7 lf 1::::-� 111 � � � � !') � l< I() \\ rr rr (f i< \" k'l rr I:1C <:U fiW f7 'tf' }!-( tJ' !J\" }� G� it � G!J'-� c.g; !J\" Gf:! � ll � f\"f � � r;i . � � !::7 c(f � ,-(! .,r;,.. ;,-,v cu t6' . 06 i'! iJ iJ u,.__ � .. 1ET' rr Lr'\" rr .,., r-rr • • !'->\" · ll � tr'\" � ... • • 'U. ._.

The explanation given here is in accord with the first of these three. These two traditions are of a single wisdom intent regarding the ulti­mate crucial point; however, the explanation presented here will fo llow the latter tradition, which possesses the crucial point of profound upade­sha. For this explanation, there are three sections: the explanation of the meaning of the tide as a link to understanding the subject, a synopsis of the crucial points of the meaning of the subject, and an extensive explana­tion of the meaning of the words of this tantra.13 2.2.1 The Explanation of the Meaning of the Title First, when an object is referred to as a \"vase;' one can understand that this refers to an object with a bulging belly. Similarly, by hearing the tide, disciples with sharp faculties will not only comprehend the meaning of the title but also internalize the meaning of the tantra, which in this case reveals all phenomena to be the maQ<;iala of primordial awakening.b This is the reason the tide of the text will be explained first. Generally, the term \"tantra\" means continuum.' Here, \"continuum\" refers to the continuity of the words and meanings that reveal the various relationships between the deities, mantra, samadhi, and so fo rth, which are the methods that accomplish the goal of the common and supreme siddhis. Specifically, [the tide] Secret Essence Definitive Nature just As It Is can be described as fo llows. Saying \"secret\" means that all phenomena of sarpsara and enlightenment14 are inseparably awakened and primordially abide as an inexhaustible ornamental wheel15 of enlightened body, speech, and mind.

Since those with obscurations who are not suitable vessels do not realize this, (for them] this remains secret. The way it is secret is that, although the three kiiyas are indwelling, they are temporarily obscured and, thus, invisible. Moreover, the pro· fo und wisdom of the view that reveals that [the three kayas are indwell­ing] is not understood through one's own strength alone. Either this is not taught by another or, even if it is, it still remains difficult to realize. In this way it is \"obscured.\"• If the uncommon view, meditation, and conduct of this tar: era were not hidden from those who are unsuitable recipients, the secret doorway would be inappropriately exposed, opening the door to disregard and contempt. Therefore, to intentionally not reveal this is the meaningof\"hidden.\"b [The term] \"secret\" is thereby established in the sense of being both obscured and hidden. \"Essence\" means the ultimate, fu ndamental nature of phenomena, pri­mordially awakened as an inexhaustible ornamental wheel of enlightened body, speech, and mind. This is the evenness of the Great Perfection. This explanation of the profound and vast is the basis of all phenomena, the quintessence, or that which is supreme, so it is the essence. The \"nature just as it is\" means the intrinsic nature of the three kayas, fr ee fr om meeting and parting. This nature pervades all things and is the sole nature of everything. It is the fundamental nature just as it is; and since it is undeceiving, it is unmistaken. Due to always sustaining its own never-diminishing, intrinsic nature, the fact that it is unchanging is why it is expressed in this way. The \"definitive\" or genuine meaning' is not like a conventional mean­ingd that is taught as a means fo r leading disciples on the path. Rather, it is expressed in this way because it is the ultimate meaning exactly as inter­nalized by the Tathiigata himself and then revealed directly to fo rtunate disciples. One should know that these fo ur terms of the title [secret, essence, definitive, nature just as it is] are explained from the perspective of fo ur conceptual distinctions that express the qualities of the great purity and evenness of primordial awakening.

In the self-appear­ing Akani�h�ha' the retinue of disciples who are not other than the teacher himself are taught by effortlessly knowing the meaning of wis­dom's self-appearances. This is not a conventional meaning taught accord­ing to the needs of others. This occurs only through the strength of the Buddha's blessings and the ever-increasing positive virtue of the disciples to be tamed. By means of establishing the definitive, genuine wisdom of the aryas,b·•6 all the words of the supreme, secret tantra will appear to the mind through the general aspect of sound. That is the tantra appearing as sound. Congruent with that through the impulse to be expressive, winds are set in motion, inciting the source and movement of sound. Expressing this through speech is the tantra heard as sound. That which has become characteristic of or the support of this expression is outwardly arranged in the fo rm of syllables that comprise the volumes of the tantra of symbolic indication. This connection to the meaning in the manner of root cause, contribut­ing circumstance, and result-such as the subject, the narrative context, and so fo rth-is fully clarified through the expression of the interrelated continuum of the sound of names, words, and syllables. Therefore, this is a continuum [i.e., tantra] . The purpose is that the intrinsic nature of the indicated meaning of these three tantras [of the ground, path, and result] is internalized through the indication of the expression of the tantra of syllables. Once the mind acknowledges a general meaning of the combi­nation of sounds and meanings, by fixation upon this as independently existing the symbolic unites with its referent, establishing a mental label. Such is the nature of all words. In dependence upon realizing the meaning of this subject, both the common and supreme siddhis will be fu lly actualized. This is the abso­lute purpose. Thus, the absolute purpose depends upon the purpose, and the purpose depends upon comprehension of the subject matter.

Here, the assertion is that the nature of phenomena is primordially awakened as the teacher, rather than that the mind of a single individual practicing on the path becomes a temporary riipakayab·'7 teacher who awakens as an embodiment of the wisdom mind. The place is the Akani�h�ha pure land palace of the space of phe­nomena, fr ee fr om center or limit. Phenomena are self-appearing as the mary9ala of the essence of awakening, without boundary or direction and without the bias of a pure or impure land based on conflicting directions. The retinue is the manifestation of the great wisdom of self-appearances, and as such it is asserted that [the retinue] is not other than the mind stream of the teacher himself, who embodies the state of great awaken­ing in which the intrinsic natures of tainted and taintless phenomena are inseparable. This is not akin to individuals gathering through devotion, nor is it based on their having purified their mind streams. Time means chat, within the fo urth time of the basic space of evenness<-free from transition and change-the effortless, inexhaustible ornamental wheel of enlightened body, speech, and mind abides as the ornament of the spontaneous Rich Array.d This is unlike the distinctions of ordinary time such as the past, present, future, seconds, moments, and so fo rth, which are ephemeral fr actions of time. The tantra [i.e., dharma] reveals chat the phenomena of sarpsira and enlightenment are primordially, inseparably awakened as the intrinsic nature of great purity and evenness. Here, it is not taught that, by relying upon buddha families, teachers, causes, results, accepting, rejecting, and accomplishing the causes fo r enlightenment, the result will come about at a fu ture time. These points are also understood through the synthesized words of the narrative context that state \"when this was taught.\" Given that the wisdom intent of teacher and retinue are inseparable, it says \"when this was taught.'' There is a significant difference between saying \"when;' men­tioned here, and saying \"at one time,\"18 which is not mentioned here.

As a crucial point concerning nonduality, if realized accord­ing to the way things abide this is the state of buddha and, if not, then this is the state of a sentient being. For example, if that which is called \"the mind\" were generally incapable of apprehending objects, then confusion would not be possible. It would then be impossible co realize the unconfused meaning. Since the mind is able to apprehend objects, then it is possible that-if the way the object actually appears is correctly apprehended-a rope, fo r instance, can be identified as a rope; and, likewise, due to a misleading circumstance, a rope could fe asibly be mistakenly apprehended to be a snake. Both options come into the realm of possibility. Likewise, when the unceasing radiance of the original awareness of spontaneously present self-appearances is identified objectively, chen fr om this seed of dualistic confusion the appearances of existence will pervasively emerge. When this occurs it resembles fr ozen water, because whatever appears is fixated upon [i.e., frozen] due to being perceived in terms of ordinary duality, thus preventing the meaning of great purity and evenness from being apparent. Since this mistaken conceptual mind is not complementary with the nature of wisdom, the truth of the intrinsic nature abiding as the ground fa ils to emerge; and by lying dormant, only confusion is left to arise. Although there arc countless distinctions concerning the details of the way confusion obscures the fu ndamental nature, in short there are four occasions of obstruction.21 While one is awake, the cognitions of the six collections\"·22 are so grossly and keenly engaged with their objects that, by fixating upon the varieties of ordinary appearances, the perfectly pure magical matrix of phenomenal existence-the intrinsic nature of the nirmaQ.akaya-is obstructed. While one is dreaming, the phenom­ena of wind-mind appear as a variety of erratic hallucinations. By fixat­ing upon that, the wisdom of self-appearances-the intrinsic nature of the sambhogakayab-is obstructed. During deep sleep, the movement of the mind and mental events cease. With no recollection whatsoever, like aimlessly roaming in darkness, the intrinsic nature of the nonconcepcual dharmakaya is obstructed. During sexual intercourse, all gross sensa­tions are subdued by the experience of climactic ecstasy.

Given that it is virtually impos­sible fo r this confusion to occur without a root cause, one may wonder, \"What is the root cause?\" The common vehicles teach that the root cause amounts to tne mental event of ignorance. In the tantras it is taught that, due to the contributing circumstance of the arising of duality, through the action of the subtle wind (or the semen), red essence, and wind­these three-there comes to be the habit of the transference of the three visions.b'23 Even the subtle wind-mind itself arises fr om original, unceasing self-appearances.

Likewise, even while a conch appears to be yellow, because of the abiding nature of its whiteness the original color will not change. In this way, whether phenomena that include all appearances of existence are understood or not, they never waver fr om being the intrinsic nature of great purity and evenness. It also states in many profound sutras: Whether all sugaras appear or not, The nature of phenomena has always primordially abided as such. Thus, it is as taught. 2.2.2.2.J.I.I. 4 How Confusion Is Reversed Fourth, by relying on authentic, perfectly pure wisdom in harmony with the way things abide or through the deeds of exceptional prajna consistent with that, confusion will be reversed like how light diminishes darkness.

This process of devia­tion will not self-correct. Reversal depends upon the circum· stance of familiarity with the path of the valid cognition that undermines it [i.e., deviation]. It fo llows that this will not be irreversible through circumstances because that condition is temporary, unstable, and able to be undermined through valid cognition, much like the mind that apprehends a rope as a snake. It follows that the nature of mind is dear light; therefore, it could not possibly be other than the antidote fo r grasping at objects. All stains of misconception, such as the view of self, attachment, and so fo rth, can be other than this nature because they are temporary. This is why, even at the time of analysis with hearing and contemplating, misconcep­tion has no potential co invalidate the view of the perfectly correct meaning. By perfecting fa miliarity with the path, the mind takes on the characteristic or nature of this antidote; so thereafter, need­less to say, there will be no potential to invalidate it. For those who have not yet exhausted their habits, there exists a slight potential to be faulted. Nevertheless, fo r one who is able to cultivate the valid cognition that undermines such grasping, this incorrect perception within a practitioner's mind stream cannot possibly persist for long, just as a small fire burn­ing on wet ground will not burn fo r long. Once there is the unmistaken, correct view and the mind assumes that nature or very condition, the torment of suffering is brought to an end and there is no longer even the slightest potential to turn back even if a contradictory opposing position is compel­lingly imposed. Since the mind maintains that perfectly cor­rect position, there is no existing valid cognition that could reverse this.

Based on the differences in the support-namely, fa culties that are keen versus dull-as well as differences concerned with accumulations on the path, here there are the two results of abiding like a rhinoceros'·27 or congregating.b Fourth, fo r the bodhisattvas it is asserted that, by generating the two aspects of bodhichitta: the nonconceptual genuine and the relative, the path of the ten paramitas28 is practiced.

The view of superior versus inferior is not an exceptional fe ature of this view. However, just as a master has the power to give a special favor to his servant, likewise, by relying upon deity and mantra there exists an exceptional certainty fo r the two siddhis to be accomplished within one's stream of mind. Nevertheless, it should not be considered that the deity's only power lies in the bestowal of siddhi. Having confidence in the way that, ulti­mately, one becomes inseparable fr om the deity's nature incites a degree of exceptional certainty. The key point is therefore based on the confi­dence gained in the genuine truth of the deity and the practitioner being equally united by the undeceiving interdependency of relative truth. Sub­sequently, through the methods fo r correctly practicing the characteris­tics of the deity's kayas, mantras, and so fo rth, according to the scriptural liturgy the nature of the deity awakens in one's mind. Like transforming iron into gold through alchemy, through the convergence of root causes and contribming circumstances, raking the realization of the thoroughly pure view as the basis and diligently practicing the deity, mantra, and samadhi in harmony with that will accomplish the result. Emphasizing the activities of body and speech without allowing the branches of the ritual-such as the outer activities of bathing, cleanli­ness, and so fo rth-to diminish, great measures are taken to please the deity. By the power of the deity, common attainments, such as becoming a vidyadhara of the desire and fo rm realms and so fo rth, will temporar­ily occur.

Based on this, these methods are proved to be swifter and more sublime than those on the path of sittra. Second, fo r the unsurpassed vehicle of inner mantra, Mahayoga, one meditates on the two profound stages according to the view that the deity and practitioner are primordially beyond meeting and parting and that phenomenal existence is purity and evenness. With conduct free from acceptance or rejection, whatever appears as the manifestation of the pure namre of phenomena is enjoyed.

The above explains the five enumerations of vehicles along with their inner divisions. To summarize their philosophies, there are five. The cor­rect philosophy of the world asserts that the result of karmic ripening is never wasted. The philosophy of the vehicle of characteristics asserts that all outer and inner phenomena created through duality arise interdepen­dently. By mistaken apprehension through delusion, designations-such as the individual person and so fo rth-occur. Delusion can be reversed and nirvaJ;la will be actualized by realizing the selflessness of the person and the selflessness of phenomena, or the nonexistence of [apprehending and] grasping at an external object and also the nonexistence of a fixat­ing mind [i.e., apprehender ]. Concerning this, fr om the standpoint of the varied degrees of realization there are the three schools of the hearers, Mind Only, and Middle Way. Moreover, the philosophies of the three outer classes of tantra teach that these interdependent, confused perceptions arise due to the unde­ceiving law of cause and result. If one relies upon the various methods of deity and mantra, there will be swift release [from confusion]; and it is caught chat the karmic results of sa.rpsara will no longer leave a sullying effect. The general philosophy of unsurpassed Yogatantra teaches that, if through training on the path one realizes that suffering itself is awakened and passions themselves are the great wisdom of perfect liberation, there will be no effec t fr om karmic results. From another perspective, since the phenomena of sarpsara and en­lightenment are primordially and spontaneously present as great purity and evenness without needing to rely upon the efforts of the path, it is revealed that primordially there has never been an effect fr om the • chog zhag zhi (cog bzhag bzhi) b khregs chod; cutting through ' dron ma zhi (sgron ma bzhi) d thod rgal; crossing over ' nang wa zhi (sn:mg ba bzhi)"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT (\\ C\\ .., � ..,� \" ,.., ..... ;.J��·��·�a.·�z::rO-J�r.,·�9�·�·��·r:.r 71 <l.lO-J'�O-J�'ul·�·O-J��·%9'�Srr�a.l 1 �·Ul�·�l.�l·<l.l�1 �·�9·�;.J�·ul·��·9��·�:.:�·lr;::4�·�9�·a·��:.:��·Oi�·�:.:��Oi·<l.l· ��·�9·a.�<l.l'�<l.l·��·��·�0-1'9��·�9�·��·�·0-I%0j'��·��:.:��·a.��·9�'\\'0-I%�' �:::·a.�·�:::·l:.:l4'\\'�1 I 9�6J·z:.r� ��: �·z:r� 1 �6.1· �It!· $'ltl6.1' a.� 9·�� ·It!�· a,� �·qa· � 9·q·9 �·�· l:.:l4l·q·�·�9·\\)�·:r.:�·��·�6.1�·�·2.�·��·��·qa:�9·q·9��1 �·,lr�·q·ar·9· �·l1a.·%�:.:�·£,9·S\\�·�'T�·9�0J1 OJ'1·�·�L�r�·�·��:.:�:;_·�:.:��.l\\·fl�:.:��·�·�9·\"-�· � � � �' � 9�0J·l�.'\\��·�OJ'1:,!�'1:.:!�9'\"-�'Ul�'� 1 1'\\'�·�a.·fl9'\"-�'l�·<l.l·�·qa_·�OJ' t::l�9'fl' ll.ill·��·a.��·�·�1 �·q-'\\�·�·IS<l.l'OJ'�l·%�·0-1�1�9�·&·5·�:.:�·�\\0-I'5'\\·�·�1 �:.:���·9��·ls�·il�·�·2.�·�·a.S:��·�<l.l·�·�<l.l·u0i·9�·��·9::_·�a.l<l9�·q�·rs'\\· ��·<l.l�j \\l�·��:.:�·�·�·�<l.l·�·�<l.l·�'f5·�:.:�·�9�·ai\\�·��·�F'\\99·�·��·<l.l1 \\lOi' V' \" \" \" ;i! \" \" ? \"\" \" ��:.:�·�·�<l.l·u�·�·�:.:�·O.JCli'� 1 a.�9· '7�·�a.·Ul�''\\9·�a.·'fj·�:.:�·l�·l �:.:� ��·�:.:�4a.·�OJ·�a.· �::_·�:.:�'\\9·a:J\"·OJ·9�9�·�·�:.:��·�·�0-1�·\"�·, �·�l·a·�<l.l·�·�:.:�4�·?_�·�a·�·�:.:�·\\1�· &'\\ ...,-? &'\\ C\\ ...., C\\.. �'r.:]'6.j�·q�·�<1J''\\t!]�'�1 l'Q.,S'<1JO-)'�'�c;,J'r.:]�t!j'd59�'Q'��·��·d.!·�a.l 1�'r.:]'Ul�' ._, C'\\ C\\ � C\\.. ......., 1:\\. ��·��·�6.l·qa.·�S�t1'��·6.l�·q�·�·�9·qa.·��·q.l\\·a,�9�·i!5�·�d.!·�F�6.l·�·Ul�·l ��·�6-l'ltl'tlj�ltl·��·�z:r�ltl·��·\\l�·�r::r<1J·2.�·q·§·�ltl·��·q.l\\·r::rtll�·q�·�·4�· �·Ul:;_·�l·q�·a.r:Q9�·��·�·�:;_·�·1 IU,l:;_·�r;,�·m�·l:;_·�OJ�·u�·iJ�·\"-�.1\\·��·\"-�· fl��·u'\\·"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT 6S bondage of karmic causes and results.

So it is. Although Rongzompa and Longchenpa each interpret these root verses differently, here I have explained the crucial points that are agreed upon. Third, the divisions of nine are as fo llows. The explanations given above concerning the paths of perfect freedom that transcend the world are the nine vehicles described as fo llows: the three vehicles that inspire renunciation: namely, the hearers, solitary realizers, and bodhisattvas; the three vehicles of Vedic asceticism:b\"41 Kriya, Upa, and Yoga; and the three vehicles of mastery through method:' Maha, Anu, and Ati. Those who claim that the description of the view is the same fo r all nine vehicles fa il to determine the difference between view and viewer, nor have they determined the view between siitra and mantra. By gain­ing certainty in the inseparable two truths, one determines the way the view gradually becomes more sublime. Nevertheless, fr om the relative perspective, who could deny the validity of a view that is likened to chat of a king and his servant? If the relative way of perceiving things were not considered to be a view, it would fo llow that-with the exception of emp­tiness and the aspect of selflessness-the four truths, the perfectly correct view of the world, and all views regarding the mode of designated objects would be disqualified as views. If that were the case, who would be obliged to even bother discussing the descriptions of these paths! There are some who still may wonder, \"Although this can be defined as a view: since it is not from the perspective of genuine truth, how can it be considered an exceptional feature of the vehicles?\" [The answer is) that this definitely qualifies as an exceptional fe ature because this is the exceptional means fo r gaining certainty in relative truth, based on attain· ing clarity with genuine truth.

This would be like believing chat cold does not exist when fire is present or imagining oneself to be a lion when fr ightened by a dog. Since chis is the view and medita­tion of the perfectly pure path that abandons the two obstructions''43 and brings unity with the absolute, unchanging result, views and meditations like these are as necessary as having eyes and legs.44 Consequently, medi­tation devoid of certainty in the view and a view devoid of meditation are like looking east while intending to go west. Paths chat engage things according to the way they abide based on the two truths must begin by establishing the perfectly correct view through the valid cognition that gives rise to perfectly correct certainty. Even thinking \"existing or not existing\" occurs within the mind that is analyzing the conventional and the genuine. In that case it fo llows that, fo r the genuine, there would be no meditation and that no certainty could be gained through valid cognition concerning chat which is designated. These are the reasons why such an approach is extremely untenable. Thus, one must know that there are two (valid] views.

Generally, both the wisdom of the path as well as the result are considered to be the vehicle. This is renowned in the scriptures in general, where it states: A vehicle is that which uplifts and delivers to a destination ... In particular, this is the ultimate wisdom path of unsurpassed mantra, so it is the king of all vehicles; and the texts that emphasize it can be proved to be the pinnacles of all vehicles.

An explanation of method and liberation Second, fo r the specific explanation of the path of unsurpassed mantra, there are two: an explanation of the generation and completion stages by means of their nature and an explanation of method and liberation, by means of practice. 2.2.2.2.J.I.2.2.Z.I An Explanation of Generation and Completion Stages For the first, among the generation and completion stages, the first is as fo llows. Consistent with the meaning of the definitive view, which is not other than the intrinsic nature of the tantra of the ground, the mind adapts accordingly and engages and becomes familiar with the purity and evenness of apparent existence. Here, this is called \"the generation stage;' which in ocher scriptures is referred to as the \"yoga of inference\"; however, it may also be referred to as the \"contrived path.\" Corresponding to the stages of maturity in sarpsaric life, the generation stage utilizes five approaches: great emptiness, magi­cal compassion, single mudd, elaborate mudra, and the accomplishment gathering of group fo rmations. By means of these, the negative habits of sarpsara are purified and the results of che positive state of nirval).a are perfected, lending maturity to the completion stage.b·45 In short, training continues until phenomenal existence appears to che contriving mind as the all-pervasive purity of the wheel of the magi­cal manifestation matrix.

Nevertheless, by perfect­ing the profound method of uniting generation and completion stages, one is led to the stage of completion as a matter of course so that genuine truth can be known. This is not illogical since it can be explained that, even through the path of siitra, it is possible to know genuine truth after an extended period of time. In the Guhyasamdja Ta ntra and others, the way of accomplishing the isolated mind' is to fo cus on the nada at the heart. Furthermore, each tantric class has its individual practices for relying upon the key points of the subtle vital essence, empty fo rm, the wisdom mudra, and the uncontrived practice of the completion stage. All of these can be engaged without difficulty by those who have perfected the fo ur yogas47 [of the generation stage]. Regarding these stages, there can be many fu rther dis­tinctions when combined with the extensive, the concise, or the various tantric ritual traditions. Second, fo r the completion stage, through the method of profound upadesha the great purity and evenness of the tantra of the ground­the indwelling maQ.<;Iala of spontaneous presence-is actualized. This is referred to as \"the stage of completion;' \"the practice of actual realization,\" or \"the innate path.\" The completion stage also has many enumerations in order to penetrate the key points of the channels, winds, and vital essence as the sup pons, such as the vase,b or wheel of technique,c'48 as well as melt­ing the subtle vital essence, resulting in bliss. In addition, the practices that penetrate the key points of the supported vital essence of clear light are empty formd and toga!.

Regarding the practice, there are three approaches: the dear-light wisdom of emptiness, the magical wisdom body of appear­ances, and the wisdom of their unity. The completion stage is engaged solely fo r the purpose of either directly or indirectly actualizing the wis­dom of purity by channeling karmic winds into the central channel.• This tantra reveals the practice with the subtle vital essence of the fo ur chakras,s2 the completion stage practice with characteristics, the prac­tice with the upper gateways fo r the gradual developers of the path of method,b the upadesha of the lower gateways for instantaneous realizers,c and the Great Perfection oral instructions of unelaborate clear light. Thus, by dispelling stains through the two stages of the path, the abiding nature of things is rendered evident. If the abiding nature were impure, then the mental process of the generation stage would actually contradict the way things abide. By arresting the winds of the ordinary body, all practice sub­stances appear to one's mind as the kiya of the deity. This is similar co how a magician's pebble can appear as a horse or elephant. Since that is a confused appearance lacking true existence, to fixate upon it as true would only result in mistaken cognition. If the way of taking five poisons as the path and engaging in conduct fr ee from acceptance and rejection were similar to that [mistaken cognition] and that approach said to surpass siitra, such claims would be extremely alarming! If surra and mantra dif­fe red only by means of method and not view, what would prevent siitra fr om teaching such swift methods? Concerning this, it should be understood that, since the causal vehicle does not assert that cause and result are spontaneously present, the meth­ods [of mantra] should not be revealed to those who are not yet suitable vessels. It must be understood that it is a great insult to mantra fo r those who do not know the fundamental nature of primordial great purity and evenness and who lack the potential to engage on the path of practice in harmony with the abiding nature of the two stages to claim that sentient beings can become buddha through methods alone.

By relying upon the yogas of evenness and postevenness in which one trains in samadhi harmonious with that [view], all ordinary confused concepts will be liberated as a matter of course. When the conceptual mind is liberated, it is inevitable that the movement of the wind element inseparably engaged with that will also be liberated in the space of wisdom. Once confused, dualistic appearances along with all contributing circumstances have been pacified and released, the genuine truth of the fundamental nature becomes manifest and one is led to the resultant state of no fu rther learning. The two paths of method and liberation arc also defined in terms of how they emphasize either method or prajiia. It must not be construed that one is absent fr om the other, but that rather, in terms of seeing the meaning of the fundamental nature, they are identical. Concerning this during the accomplishment gathering, even symbolic, illustrative wisdom can arise in the minds of practitioners, depending on their practice. Since this is connected to the exceptional accomplishment resulting fr om the profound methods of mantra, the accomplishment of the status of a vidyadhara of the desire and fo rm realms will occur and some degree of siddhi will be achieved. If the accomplishment gather­ing of the path of definitive perfection is authentic, once supreme siddhi is achieved the entire group fo rmation will depart fo r the ground of the vidyadharas. This occurs because the ten signs such as smoke and the rest\" are perfected when the samadhi of great emptiness is accurately engaged.

In regard to the genuine fu ndamental nature of phenomena, since the mind is capable of a more elevated experience, it is referred to in this way [i.e., as the fo rbearance of the path of unifica­tion]. When this increases, the ultimate, illustrative wisdom that induces actual genuine wisdom is born in the mind stream. This is called \"supreme dharma.\"b Given that among worldly paths there are none more supreme and because this [i.e., supreme dharma] leads to the path of the aryas, it is referred to as such. The names given above have been designated accord­ing to how the path of unification leads to the path of seeing. Even the line of demarcation between what is and what is not the path of unifica­tion must be apprehended based on the presence or absence of illustrative wisdom in the mind stream. There are those who claim that the practice of the stage of generation occurs on the path of accumulation and that the practice of the stage of completion-vajra recitation' and so fo rth-starts on the path of unifica­tion. If so, that would hold true for gradual developers, buc is not always the case because at the time of empowerment it is possible fo r some dis­ciples to achieve simultaneous familiarity and realizationd by recognizing wisdom. Furthermore, some may be able to integrate the generation and completion [stages] right fr om the start. It is also possible to invoke illus­trative wisdom through the profound stage of generation where empty appearances are likened to the moon reflected on water. Nonetheless, despite practicing vajra recitation and other methods, the possibility still exists that illustrative wisdom will not arise and consequently [the practi­tioner] will still remain on the path of accumulation. Regardless of which aspects of the generation and completion stages are practiced in accor­dance with the individual classes of tantra, ultimately the crucial point is to know that when illustrative wisdom arises in the mind stream that is called \"mantra's path of unification.\" During the first two stages on the path of unification, proximate illus­trative wisdom is likened to a drawing of the moon, whereas on the lat­ter two [stages] it is fu lly qualified and shown to be similar to the actual 'jor lam zod pa (sbyor lam bzod pa) bjor lam chO chog (sbyor lam chos mchog) ' dor dey (rdor bz/a;) d rok gom chig char pa (rtogs goms gcig car pa)"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"86 ESSENC£ OF CLEAR LIGHT � � ......, c.... � ........ \"\\ .... \" � �·�a_·.J:_z:_'o.laii3\\'�'��·��·�z:_·��·-;s�·�\")�'�'o.l�'r:.t::I\\'.;.J�z:;_·�a,·.;.J�z:;_·�.;.J'�z:_�· ...,_.

Seeing the indivisibility of subject-object that is char­acteristic of this [i.e., the actual moon] invokes the path of seeing that definitively knows the truth of the nature of phenomena and becomes realization possessing the seven branches of awakening,• such as prajfia and so forth.61 It is then that mantra's path of meditationb arises in the stream of mind, characteristic of the eight-branch path of the aryas:·62 such as the perfectly correct view of actually seeing phenomenal existence as great purity and evenness. Given that there are nine stages on the ground [of the path of medita­tion), 63 there are also nine obstructions. When the wisdom of[ the path of] learningd that serves as the antidote to the greatest of the great [ obstruc­tions] to be abandoned on the path of meditation arises in the mind stream, one reaches the second ground [on the path of meditation]. The other [stages) are gradually achieved in the same way. Finally, by means of the antidote to the smallest of the small [obstructions] being aban· do ned on the path of meditation, one arrives at the stage of the ultimate wisdom of the path of learning and the final stage of the tenth ground is achieved. By virtue of the vajralike samadhi• of evenness with the ultimate fu ndamental nature, even the subtle seeds of the two obstructions will be completely uprooted.

On the grounds of the aryas there is no difference in terms of the actual realization of the basic space of phenomena; however, there are signifi­cant differences in the way ever-increasing lucid appearances are achieved. Aside from each arya's discerning wisdom awareness, this cannot be discerned by an intellectual mind, much like how the trail of a bird in the sky cannot be apprehended. For this reason, distinctions of the ten grounds'·64 are determined dependent upon how lucid appearances are achieved fr om the time certainty arises in postevenness, while the qualities of abandonment and realization [become increasingly] more sublime. The different ways lucid appearances increase with respect to the nature of phenomena even determine the description of the way the purity of phenomenal existence is seen. For instance, on the path of accumulation the deity is based on devotion; on the path of unification the deity is based on wind-mind; on the path of seeing the deity is based on clear light; on the path of meditation the deity is the union oflearning; and ultimately the deity is the union of no fu rther learning. In these two ways,6s even the precise meaning of great purity and evenness is established through the path. When the simultaneous meaning of the inseparable truth of purity and evenness becomes evident without vacillation, it is described as the ground of buddha called \"the union of no further learning.\" Since this is the wisdom kiiya of the inseparable two truths, as fa r as the nature is concerned there is no difference. However, because of mental distinctions regarding the three kayas, there are descriptions of the grounds named All-Pervasive Lght, the Lotus, and the Great Assembly of the Wheel of Syllables. Although assertions may vary regarding the way [the three grounds] are combined with the three kayas, in terms of meaning there is no contradiction whatsoever; fo r it is agreed that these three [i.e., the grounds] represent divisions based merely on mental distinctions and not on whether abandonmems and realization are higher or lower. Moreover, there are fu rther descriptions of the grounds named Exaltation, Unsur­passed Wisdom, and so fo rth; however, the way of understanding them is the same as what was explained here. • sa chu (sa bcu, da..<habhumi)"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT 1:\\ ...,.. .... - \" ....... � �·ll.!3J'�l·lt!]·fl��·ll.!3J'l!:;..�:t,·�·�:t,·IJ.!·��·&z::;�3.)�·1l.!�·��r:.,·�·ll.!�·ll.!d-l'�a: ar�·?�·�·�·lr:,·l l�·O-j:t,·�·�r;;_· �·C-l�s�·�:t,·t!]Bt!]·�IJ.!·z:riJ.!�·�·q�·t!]%t!]·�·iil· .......

Having perfe cted the path of learning and almost becoming a buddha is the spontaneously present vidyadhara who bears the accouterments ofVajradhara, the spontaneous presence of five kayas. As fo r the definition, the term \"vidyadhara\" is derived fr om \"vidya;· meaning awareness or prajfla possessing mantra's wisdom of the nature as it is. \"Ohara\" means to hold. Given that this meaning is held or possessed within the mind stream, no matter where the boundaries fo r these fo ur vidyadharas are drawn-as with the fo ur branches of approach, accom­plishment, and so fo rth68-there is no contradiction. The term [i.e., vidyadhara] is also used fo r mantra accomplishment as with the vidyadharas of the desire and fo rm realms, the sword,\" and others. Moreover, there are the three vidyadharas who enter, abide, and mature on the grounds. On the path of meditation alone, the vidyadharas are divided into five, which are the vajra, wheel, jewel, lotus, and sword. Thus, this term is used in many ways. 2.2.2.2.J.I.J The Result Third, the state of perfection, or the tantra of the result, is as fo llows [as stated in the root tantra]: And: The essence of supreme accomplishment Present in the minds of the victorious ones of the three times Is an inexhaustible wish-fulfilling treasury, Evident without increase or decrease.

When extensively divided, this includes all knowable things that encompass the entire basic space of phenomena. For as long as space exists, these immeasurable qualities are constantly engaged as deeds that spontaneously and pervasively benefit and bring happiness to infinite sentient beings.

For instance, the path of Secret Mantra may be taught by means of the single, nondual practice of method and prajna. It may also be explained as the [stages of] gen�ration and completion, method and liberation, and so fo rth. Furthermore, there are explanations in threes, such as the threefold practices of enlightened body, speech, and mind; view, meditation, and conduct; approach, accomplishment, [and] activity; and the like. This [path of Secret Mantra] is also taught as fo ur stages of practice in which the wisdoms of the fo ur vajras are taken as the path. Binding with the four mudras-the great mudra, the mudra of dharma, the mudra of samaya, and the karma mudra•-a buddha's body, speech, mind, and deeds are taken as the path. Moreover, all paths can be synthesized into the five categories of empowerment, samaya, view, accomplishment, and enlight­ened activity.

Second, the pinnacle of all views-the ultimate tenet and the final des­tination of all paths-is the uncommon view of this tradition of the unsur­passed vehicle, implicating a mind that has gained certainty regarding the great purity and evenness of apparent existence. Furthermore, that which is called \"view\" is recognized by someone who definitively apprehends the meaning to be determined. Therefore, the emphasis falls upon cer­tainty that is achieved after evenness. For example, the terms \"prajiia\" and \"wisdom\" are assigned to the meditative evenness of the path of seeing; however, fo r the most part that is not referred to as \"a view.\" Nevertheless, from the perspective of seeing authentic truth, there is no contradiction in calling this \"a view.\" That being said, during the meditative evenness of the aryas, apart fr om each individual's discerning awareness, the way the basic space of phenomena is known actually transcends the domain of terms and concepts. The way that lucid appearances are achieved in meditative evenness determines how certainty is invoked afi:er evenness. In regard to this, it states [in Distinguishing the Middle and Extremes]: The omnipresent71 meaning is the supreme meaning. Thus, according to what is taught, just as how the difference between the grounds and the correct view of the aryas is determined through cer­tainty achieved afi:er evenness, here-based on the strength of fa miliar­ity with the authentic path and the transference of wisdom gained at the time of empowerment-one is able to rest in the view of great union free fr om elaboration.

They are the view that sees conditioned phenomena,b the view that sees the nature of phenomena,' and the view that sees self-awareness.d These three not only pertain to this context, they pervade all views as terms that enumerate the definitive subjects of the conventional: the genuine/ and the insepa­rable two truths.s Nevertheless, at this time these three will be explained according to the uncommon tradition [i.e., the Nyingma tantras]. With respect co that, the view of conditioned phenomena includes [seeing] the world [and] inhabitants-the support and the supportedh­as the mal).<;iala of enlightened kayas and wisdom. This is great purity. The view of the nature of phenomena sees all appearances to be inseparable with great evenness. The view of seeing self-awareness is the discerning wisdom of the surpassing truth of inseparable purity and evenness-the great dharmakaya. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I.J Proving the Nature of the View This has two parts: 1 Demonstrating mantra's view is more sublime than surra's l Proving the profundity of the sublime view of mantra Third, the use of reasoning to show this nature involves demonstrating how the view of mantra, when compared with that of surra, is more sub­lime and of proving the profundity of the view itself. • ngii tob ky i rik pa (dngos stobs ky i rigs pa) b chii chen tawa'i tawa (chos can Ita ba'i Ita ba) ' chii nyid ta wa 'i tawa (chos ny id Ita ba'i Ita ba} d rang rig tawa'i taw.t (rang rig Ita ba'i Ita ba) • ta ny ed ky i yiil chen (tha sn;•ad ky i yul can) f don dam pa'i yiil chen (don dam pa 'i JUt can) s den nJi JeT med ( bden gnyis dbyer med) h ten and tenpa (rten and brten pa)"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"1-:r: \" -l c::: ...: \"-1 -l u ... 0 \"\"\" u z \"-1 Vl Vl \"\"\" 'D !2 ir i:r � e-. .

Concerning the mere establishment of the basic space of phe­nomena free from elaboration as the object under consideration, there is no difference. However, since the view is proved from the perspective of the subject, there is a significant difference in the manner in which the basic space of phenomena is apprehended. If the object to be resolved by the view-the nature as it is of the space of phenomena-were not the sole nature,73 it would absurdly fo llow that the nature of phenomena could diverge into many aspects. It would then fo llow that siitra's path of seeing could not see the nature as it is. Then, it would be necessary to prove how an elaboration in excess of the elabora­tions of the fo ur extremes is eliminated. 1l1erefore, all learned and accom­plished ones unanimously agree upon this single crucial point, that the nature of phenomena is directly realized through both siitra's and mantra's paths of seeing. If one thinks, \"Well then, even though the object of the view is the same, the view is not proved to be more sublime;' the response is that, of course, this can be proved, fo r it is as stated [in the Lamp of the Ihree Mo des of Reasoninf]: A single meaning, no delusion, a wealth of methods, freedom fr om hardship, and fo r those of keen faculties-by these the vehicle of mantra is exalted. Thus, as taught, based on the differences that there is no delusion due to prajiia and the many special methods fo r swiftly seeing the fu ndamen­tal nature-these two-[mantra] is sublime. In dependence upon that, the path is practical and swift, so it is therefore without hardship. Addi­tionally, as fo r the person who is the support, mantra is sublime in that it is the province of those whose faculties are sharper than those to be tamed by the causal vehicle.

As fo r the first, on the path of siitra through analytical meditation that depends upon inference, along with gathering vast accumulations [of merit and wisdom), after a long while the space of phenomena can be directly realized. By contrast, here [i.e., with mantra] this can be realized within one's mind by means of direct experience devoid of analysis. Furthermore, by the strength ofhaving matured through empowerment and the possession of the special key points of upadeshas, the achievement of lucid appearances with respect to the fundamental nature is similar to clearly perceiving a distant fo rm after applying a sight-enhancing eye potion or releasing the secret knots through skill with the key points of meditation upon the wheels of technique and so fo rth. Moreover, even the key analytical points of meditation on the paths of siitra ultimately arrive at the inseparability of the two truths. Nevertheless, since it is diffi­cult fo r beginners to ascertain and experience the union of the two truths as of equal taste, they will emphatically hold to an emptiness in which the extremes are individually negated. Conversely, in mantra, wisdom that is the clear light of nnion is revealed in its natural state. In the Kd la chakra it states:74 The three states of existence are not established as the fo rms of extremely subtle particles and cognition in the way that the Proponents of External Objects75 believe. Here, the Mind Only [proponents] believe that mere consciousness devoid of duality is established. When that is further analyzed, like those subtle particles, consciousness itself is also not established. \"The nonabiding prajtia of the buddhas is the middle path.\" Thus, some followers of the Buddha will use those words. Whoever is without unchanging bliss, which is to say who­ever does not possess it, considers emptiness by holding mere emptiness in mind and, as a result, is unable to part with all reference points. Therefore, the principal [among tantras]­the Kdlachakra-reveals a connate bliss devoid of transition that abides in the body but does not arise from a solitary body'6 as taught in the vehicle of mantra."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"f-. :I: \" ... 0:: < \"' ... u � 0 \"' u z \"' V) V) \"' � � . = in?·. 1!4• • rp � <:17 c;t() ir � l{ � c:i:! ;:o 'fiP � if ii'f ,£rp it -1ir '� @ ,(! � e:;-· f1 .

Second, when the union of bliss and emptiness and the union of space and awareness are experienced as such, this perfectly pure basic space of the fundamental nature of phenomena is the aspect of awareness as kayas and wisdom that are by nature spontaneously present and free from meet· ing and parting. Since the fundamental nature is the union of appear­ances and emptiness, according to the fundamental nature even impure appearances do not exist. As a result, within the fu ndamental nature of clear light, only kiiyas and wisdom appear. The distinctions of this [pro­fo und view] are immeasurable and possess all the qualities of the state of awakening that are as numerous as the grains of sand on the banks of the river Ganges. This is asserted not only in mantra but also in the common great vehicle. In the Uttara tantra< it states: Having abandoned all faults along with their habits, chis stain­less space of the Tathagata possesses inconceivable and in com· parable qualities that are as incalculable as the number of grains of sand along the banks of the Ganges. Thus, as this demonstrates, the aspect of the perfectly pure nature of basic space at the time of the result and the natural indwelling poten­tial [i.e., buddha nature] do not differ with regard to change or quality in terms of their nature. Consequently, through the power of achieving lucid appearances with respect to the nature of phenomena, in evenness meditation appearances never depart from the great evenness of the space of phenomena. Within this state of evenness, all appearances without any exclusion are free from meeting and parting. To then gain definitive cer­tainty in the meaning of primordial purity through the exceptional cer­tainty that arises after evenness constitutes the view of Secret Mantra.

Nevertheless, by the strength of actually knowing the space of phenomena from the perspective of certainty achieved after evenness, the truth of great purity and evenness is precisely realized. The Uttara tantra continues: Having seen that the mind's nature is clear light, the passions have no true, inherent existence. Having realized the selfless­ness of all sentient beings, your unobstructed mind sees all sentient beings as followers of the Buddha. I bow down to you, whose wisdom knows the innate purity of infinite beings. Concerning this, when mantra's path of indivisible cause and effect­the truth of great purity and evenness-is realized, not only will there be the potential to precisely ascertain the truth of the nature of phenomena, there will be buddhahood. Given that on the path of siitra the entirety of phenomenal existence is not taught to be primordially awakened as great purity, it is then impossible to see the truth by means of the path of siitra alone. On the path of siitra while fa miliarizing with and accumulating merit fo r one incalculable kalpa, the teaching that reveals the truth of the evenness of phenomena is as though hidden within its own path. Never­theless, after an extended period of time, certainty concerning the great purity of phenomenal existence will naturally be gained. For instance, since on the three pure grounds\"· n the entire universe and inhabitants are seen as pure, existence and quiescenceb are then realized to be equal. Surra's equivalent of what mantra explains as purity and evenness are the two practices of those who are on the pure grounds: the evenness of existence and quiescence and merging with the pure realms.

However, it is necessary to explain this in more detail that will be addressed elsewhere. Based on this reasoning, although phenomena ultimately abide as great evenness, on the relative plane it is not held that sarpsara is the state of awakening since there are distinctions concerning cause, result, acceptance, and rejection. That is why this is called \"the causal vehicle of characteristics.\"• Until genuine truth is directly realized, there will be confusion concerning the truth of the awakened nature of phenomena. On the path of mantra-even at the time of initially severing all doubt through hearing and contemplating-since inseparable sarpsara and enlightenment are seen as great purity, there is no confusion concerning the view because the cause of suffering arises as the nature of the truth of the path and suffering arises as the nature of the truth of cessation. Therefore, passions are set free as wisdom, and suffering is set free as exal­tation.

Through touch [water] acts as that which moistens, and to partake of it can even induce bliss and nonconceptual samadhi. Given that all buddhas who have fully exhausted all dormant passions and liberated all appearances see things according to the way things actually are, elaborations are then pacified. By seeing the way things appear, [based upon the way they are] the bud­dhas see the immeasurable domain of perfect purity-the phenomena of wisdom's self-appearances. Due to the different ways that things are per­ceived, there are those who may wonder what is valid and whkh objects exist according to the way designations abide. [The answer is that,] how­ever much the subject sees purity, it is valid to that extent; and that indi­vidual's perception is, fo r them, the way things are. This resembles how the mind perceives an object such as a conch to be either white or yellow. For that reason [the syllogism is]: The topic is all appearances; it follows that they [i.e., appear­ances] naturally abide as the maQ<;lala of kayas and wisdom because they are perceived as such by the aryas' pure seeing, which is free from all stains of incorrect understanding. For example, this is like seeing a conch shell with unimpaired eyes.

However, some may think that what these aryas see is according to self-appearances and that they do not see the objects ordi­nary persons sec as pure.

This sparked a debate, at which time the Buddha revealed the pure land so that it could be witnessed by every­one simultaneously. Buddha said, \"Although my realm has always been pure in this way, until now you have failed to see it!\" Thus, the [present] similarity to this must be understood. If one fails to compare the way of seeing a single object by way of the nature just as it is and incorrect see­ing, one will be unable to establish the difference between what is true or fa lse concerning appearances, such as the yellow conch versus the white. This is because valid cognition is being established based merely upon one individual's perception. If that presentation were the case, then the descriptions of valid and invalid cognition would vanish without a trace and, except fo r pure self-appearances, there would be no impure reality existing elsewhere. In the Collection of Sutras' it states: Know that the purity of fo rm is resultant purity. The purity of the result and fo rm will become the purity of omniscience. Omniscience is pure fo rm and result, Undivided, indivisible, and comparable to space! Thus, just as taught, when the subject is free from stain, the object will be seen as pure. That is the actualization of the intrinsic nature of the object just as it is, analogous to the mind reversing fixation upon the conch as yellow. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I.J.2.I.I.I.I.I.2 Proved through Reasoning Second, this is also proved through reasoning. The fa ct that a single object can be perceived in different ways is commonly accepted throughout the world. When one is familiar with the intrinsic purity of phenomena and basic space as nondual, the discernment of appearances is then based entirely upon their intrinsic purity.

It fol­lows that to see in this way is genuine. If this [purity] did not pervade [all appearances], it would be necessary to accept that pure seeing is fa lse and impure seeing is true. If so, one would have to accept that sublime beings have incorrect understanding, while those who are ordinary have correct understanding. Who could possibly respect such a doctrine, and what proponent oflogic would advocate it? Here, [pure] seeing means that the higher would fault the lower, while the lower would be incapable of faulting the higher. In Entering the Middle �fit states: A person with blurred vision cannot claim visual defect in one whose sight is clear. Likewise, a mind lacking stainless wisdom cannot claim that a stainless mind is flawed ... Just like the verse states, the buddhas who have thoroughly puri6ed all stains see phenomena precisely as they appear. Except fo r whatever is seen as the pure nature of phenomena, there is nothing to improve upon since this is the ultimate fundamental nature of designated relative appearances. As a result it is crucial to distinguish the twofold approach to relative phe­nomena: one fr om the perspective of confusion and the other fr om the perspective of how the relative actually abides. The valid cognition of analyzing designations is nothing more than ordinary short-sightedness,b and merely seeing things in that way while assuming that to be the ultimate way designations abide is very narrow­minded. If carefully examined, this is the same as an indiscriminate mind that fails to distinguish whether seeing a conch as white or yellow is cor­rect or incorrect valid cognition. If there is no other nature aside from the way an ordinary person sees things, then the appearance of a yellow conch to the one who perceives it as yellow would become the way the conch truly is. If one thinks that this way of seeing fails to cognize reality because it is tainted by the cause of confusion, [the answer is] although ordinary persons perceive all impure appearances tainted by negative hab· its, they still must accept that the nature of their phenomena is the same • uma la jug pa (dbu ma fa Jugpa, madhyamak.ivatdra); Chandrakird b tsur tong (tshur mthong)"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT �a.·&�·�·4�·�·::!r::]·qa·tTJ��· ��·E�·t:���·311 \\l�·�·�·��·qa·��·�·<'ll·9��r�· iii\\�1 �·�<'ll·���·::J·<'ll·t:���·q·\\\\�·�·�·�\\qa·��·�·��·, �9·qa·9�tTJ�·q·<'ll· r::]��·q·\\\\�·�·£;J·��·qa·��·�·t!j��·�9��·qa·&�·�, ,�.t!j��·a·��·qJ:_·��· ::!�./!:]��·� 1 �·��·�·�·s�·<'ll�·�s�·�a·��·q�·t:�4·<'ll�1 ��·qa_·�·�·��·�cll· ��·;s�·�·�·l!:]·�·��·l!:]��·/!:]�9�·'la:�l!:l�·cll�·��·q�1 ���·��·�cll·i�·cll· 9��·�Q�·iJ·q�l!:]a·�9�·'l�1 1s�·<'ll�·�:l\\·���·�·��·�·�·��9�·��·q�1 1 �s�·�·�·��·���·qa·w·��·�q·q�1 1a_�·9��ra·�2l·�·i!·��·�a·i!9·�·�·�1 �:l\\·��r;;_ ·�·�<'ll·�·3l�r��·�r;;_·l �·�a·�<'ll·��·���·��·i!·��·q�l ���·�·�·�· a_�a·�z;·�cll·��·��·�1 �a.l ·tl]�tTJ·�·��·<'ll ·�<'ll·��·�·�r;;_·��·t:�, ��·��·�9·�· l!:l�<'ll·q·3l�·qa.·3lz:(�·q·w�·q1 ��r�sz;�·�:l\\·3l�·a.]�·o.r9ar�·t:���·�·�cll·qa· �<'l!·r:r��·ql ��·�9·��·s<'ll·l!:la:�9�·��·4�·s·£;!��·��·��·9�9·�·���· ...,., � � �--� � --fri q·�9�1 l!:l��·� �·�·�l!:l·qa:��·�<'ll·9�··lt!j'£J'�<'ll'q(.r�:l\\·���·� l·�cll·to,tTJcll'l!:l' l�:l\\·��·�·l!:]�q·q�·;)·��·q·���·"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT IlS as whatever appears to those whose minds are absolutely free from the stain ofhabits. Therefore, to reveal the profound key point here in brief, there are two aspects of fully designated valid cognition: the valid cognition that relies upon short-sightedness· and the valid cognition that relies upon pure see­ing.b In brief, the difference between these two can be explained in terms of their root cause, nature, function, and result. For the first [i.e., short-sightedness], the root cause arises from the strength of the careful examination of subjective, transient phenomena. The nature is merely that of subjective, temporarily undeceived compre­hension. The function is to eliminate misinterpretation concerning the object of the short-sighted mind, and the result is to engage based on having reached a final determination. The root cause fo r the latter [i.e., pure seeing] is that it is attained through the postevenness seeing of the nature of phenomena just as it is. The nature is the vast prajfla of the subject that sees myriad appear­ances. The function is to dispel misinterpretations concerning a domain of experience that the short-sightedness of the ordinary stream of mind cannot fathom. The result is to realize the omniscient wisdom that knows the multiplicity of things. These two [valid cognitions] can be likened to the eyes of the humans and the gods. Although the latter [i.e., the gods] know the objects seen by the short-sighted, the short-sighted do not know the objects seen by the latter. Based on that, given that the mind of the latter is uncommon, in the space of a single particle they can see as many pure lands as there are particles and in a single instant they can reveal the deeds of many kal­pas. Without wavering fr om the unchanging space of phenomena, they reveal the manifestation of emanations. Through an enlightened mind free from concepts, they simultaneously realize all knowable things and so fo rth. Although it appears as though such an inconceivable field of experience is contrary to the objects of ordinary short-sightedness-thus precluding the possibility of proving its validity-nevertheless, since this • tsu rol tongwa La ten pa kun tu ta nyed pa'i tsed ma (tshu rol mthong ba Ia brten pa kun tu tha snyad pa'i tshad ma) b dagpa'i zik pa Ia ten pa kun tu ta nyed pa'i tsed ma (dag pa'igzigs pa Ia rten pa kun tu tha ny ad pa'i tshad ma)"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"126 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT \" \" \" \"\" \"\"\" \" ...,.. � ��·���r��·3-1·�qqr.r�9�·q�·���·<l.!�·�z::_·��·� I 40i·�·�q�·�z::_·��·.1z::_· Oi;.r�·UJz::_·£rt::��t::!! ���·��·<l.!�·���·q·�z::_·�9·q·�z::_·�·�·il�·q·�z::_·.;J·¥.rq·��· �·ii!o;·�, ���·�·��·ijz::_·�·w�·q·o5�·.;J�·���·q·(l,!·�9�·q·��·.;Jf{t::_·�·<l.!.J.!·��· ��·qgj,q·��·��·�·�d-I�·�·�·;.J�·qgj,q·(l,!, %�·��·�·q��·949�·qa·i�·�<l.!· CJ�;.J·��·�·�Q·�·�d-l�·�·��·��·lll·��·���·�a:�<l.!·��·�·d-l�·l!:lgj_l!:l'��·s·l!:l· @�·����·�J\\·�·��·�;.J�·.;s�·U�·��·���·m�·�·<l.!·ij��·�·��·�Q·�·�;.J�·��· ......,... .....,.., t:'\\ C\\. ...... t:\\ .. ...... t:\\..

The valid cognition of perfectly pure wisdom originates from the power of the logic regarding the inconceivable nature of phenomena and, there­fo re, possesses great strength, will never deceive, and is transcendental, pure, unsurpassed, and unequalled. Everything that is proved from the relative perspective, even by the path of the short-sighted, such as prov­ing the authenticity of the Buddha and so fo rth, must be proved through the first [valid cognition] while all uncommon inconceivable fields of experience of the tathagatas are proved by the latter (valid cognition] in a manner that is congruent with the nature of phenomena. Therefore, all profundities such as the primordial awakening of phenomena cannot be proved by the short-sighted alone, while at the same rime it is also not the case that the [short-sighted] lack the valid cognition that establishes this, which is why the meaning of the key point must be known. If not understood in this way-except fo r the escalation of wrong understanding-it would be impossible to establish the differences in the way perception becomes more and more refined. This would be like the difference between the way a non-Buddhist clairvoyant sees beings on a patch of earth the size of a chariot's wheel and [that which is seen] by the fo ur [categories] of the aryas.78 Just as the Buddha could see that the lay­man Palkye' possessed the seed fo r liberation in his stream of mind but the arhat did not, qualitative distinctions, such as better or worse, that are known by the higher and not by the lower cannot be made. In the si\"Itras it states: Even upon the tip of a single strand of hair, There are millions of inconceivable pure lands. Even the va:iations of their shapes are discernable, While they all remain distinct. Thus, (if this logic is not known] confidence in these teachings will not be achieved, which is why this is a crucial point fo r both surra and mantra. • khyim dag palkye (khyim bdag dp al skyes)"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"1:!.8 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT ���·'-�·��·�J-J·���·'-�a·a5�·J-Ja·�r.:��·��·��·'-��·r.:��r.:�·�1 a.�·��·J-J·��·�r ��·s·r.:�·UJr:.:��·r.:���·�r;·��·�r;· 9�·t::���·'-��·�r::_·t::�·a.�·��·�'¥\\·��r:::a�· �r:_·ciJ�·Il.ll r.:��9·9�·��·�r::_·'-��·�sr;�·�r::_·�F�·�9�·'-��·�r::_·t::�·�d-!�·�1 r.:���·a.£(31·�·�9�·r:;·��·JJ��rqa:�·rr·�r;:_·�£J��·'-�·��·1 ��·JJ��·��·z::]s�· '-�a·��·�r;·�9·z::]�ilJ·� .. �·rr�·9?�·��·J-J·�z::]·q�·�, ��·��·��·z::]��·qa·�· ��''-J'�t;'�o.]'Uit;'ciJ�·q�·�r;·r;;J��·��·��·q�·���·4r;·, �r;·��'o.l'?o.!''-1'��· cr�·�r;·q��·�o.J·��·qa:��·a.�a.·UJr;·��·qa.·��·�z::,·��·�o.J�·u�·i!l·��·��·q· ��·CT�·�r.:�·?:ll la,�8_·��·��·�·��·�J-J�·<J.r�q·qa.·�r;·ao·��·��·t:��·q��·t:�·�;;j· ��·�1 wr::_·t:�·\"r;·\"�:l\\·iJ�·t:�a·��·�·'fi�·��·q·�\"·��·ill·��·\"�·'-�·��·r.:�::��·r.:��· r::r��·c:!�·r.:���·t:�·&0\\·�1 I ���·t:�·��·��·�·4�·�q�q·t:�·� I r.:�'fi·s·��·J.!�·q8,·�·��·£l·a.��·t:��·i�r �o.J�·��·�o.J�·�·::r;�·��·�o.J·�f�·��·t:�a·�r.:�·J-J�r.z.·�·qa·�-:1\\·��·q·��·arq�z:J· t:.la·��·�l a.�·�:t_·�d-!�·�·9-%r;·t:r�r;·a.��·t:.la·�d-!·q:t_·�9·t:.l·�·l9�·t::J·9��· q8_·z::]9'C!i��·d-l�·q��·q·Qj�'�9�·��·�·�r;· q·�·g9�·���·q·�·�9''-��' �z::]�·��·l ��·%·arqr��·El�'z::]a'�J-J'�'���·�q�·�·l�·q8,·��·q·��·l mr.:�·q· 3-lfla.·��·::��·q·a.s�·�a·�q�·�·��·�·��·qa.·��·t::rJ-Jf!a.·UJ�·q�·4�·t::�·flo.J�· u\\�c_·9·�o.J�·�·��:�c_·o'J-J'��·�'¥\\·��l·�z::,·l �·��·�·94·��·qll�o.1�·�· r.:���·���·��·�c_·t3c_·?.t�·��ll!·q·�r::,·q-�·l��·a:.J·a.���·q�·a,ao::r;·q·�a:.J·� 9��·�, �a:.j�·�a.·a.��·q·���·��·lr::,·o.,J��·t:J�'o.J'�9�·q�·q�9'��·��r::,' a,��·�q��·q�·��·JJ��·�r::,·l �·��·��·l�·�·l�·��·��·q��·r.:���·q�· r.:���·q8,·��·q·�·l��·�·�o.J·��·4::r;· r::r�·��·��·�l ��·�·�·���·4�·£1· q��··1.J ·q�qa:, ��Cl�·::r;�·9·9��·�141·��·o.J��·q.l;,'14jo.J'���·t:��·::r;�·��·�1'11' t:�f.i:a;·�o.J�'�{;.J·q4�·.1Jtrj·t:l·�1 �t!j't:la:��·q·��·i!l·t:J-:1\\'4-:1\\'.::]'�'"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT 129 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I.J.2.I.I.J.I.2 Through Valid Cognition of Genuine Analysis Second, proving purity through the power of the valid cognition of genu­ine analysis is as fo llows. Even that which is referred to as \"impure\" does not exist except fo r appearances fo rmed through suffering and its source. The space that is empty of the two aspects of self and all appearances united with that, including self-fixation and the nature of the passions, their apprehension, and the karma generated through those passions, have never existed as the nature of suffering. Therefore, while naturally abiding as pure, not even the name \"impure\" exists via [the truths of] suffering and its source. Since there are no phenomena that are not the intrinsic nature of the great evenness of emptiness, all apparent phenomena primordially exist as great purity. This manner of purity is not just a mere expression of purity based on the nonexistent empty aspect of phenomena. Since there is inseparability with emptiness, no matter what appears it is always shown to be primordially pure, noble exaltation. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I.J.2.I.J.I.2 Proving the Subject to Be Wisdom Second, the following establishes wisdom as the subject. The way of estab­lishing great purity is from the perspective of those proponents who do not accept the common external existence of objects and hold phenom­ena to be nothing but the mind's appearances. That which constitutes the occasion of impurity is reification through familiarity with various dualistic concepts, resulting in the appearances of the myriad phenomena of the six classes of beings. Accordingly, to be free from misconception during the time of the path constitutes pure appearances. At the time of the result, when all obstructions are completely exhausted, the limitlessly arising and exceedingly pure manifestations are nothing other than just the appearances of one's mind. This mind-the source of all-abides as the unceasing arising of various appearances of clear light, empty of the twofold self The fixation of this mind is contrary to its abiding nature, so dualistic grasping results in passions, karma, and the arising of the myriad dreamlike appearances subsumed within the truth of suffering. These are confused appearances that do not abide according to the genu­ine meaning, thus they are unreliable and deceptive. Through training on the path in harmony with the abiding nature of the mind when all con­fu sed appearances gradually reverse, flawless appearances will then arise."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"i:7 � i< . . -:,-, � . � . t! . if -}H.r t< . i:7 (i(; iii' 1-( • • • ll.t'-!-'...... iR) G!tl [7 • !(£ • i:i? f! � (!-C' .-� � IIi f£ [_ � lfp � � it' ,If= !'1 � � 'F 'tf g v-- w !J;:\"I'Ou f£� if w-ti5?\" � · eu17 � t( ii'r �-�� • �1ft[� �,� f'���� r: �flr�����r[f� }� � }w ro � fl if � � � '� � � };:( fl iif !t'£? iQ � !J? }E:;-c� if Gi:! t{\" � � � tr »0 !J }!J � iu U t{\" ll c ii'r '� li lf i(5= E7 � � � � ic; 1:! � IT lrl � �\"-,<) i:J if E7W � � � !=?\" (f6 }f£ G'lt{ l.l if � ET (l{] tiS • • � � '· fl\"W if f< f:! � · · !7 � Gfii> a !J � !J7 � � � k--G� I!_ � � � lC> GfiD G� � � � g_ !J � � G� GETi> lf ·i:f GIU • tiS • • • l7 f{ it;' io · if \"' If tiS ii(' • . v--G r1J � i.t;::9 :---E7 -rv-- � th i{ � i-{[-}[7 t() }mJj> }!tC' � e-}I£ tO � iJ' • . .

In this respect confused appearances are not true, while pure appear­ances are true because they are faultless. For example, when varieties of gold originating from earth and iron or the water gold of Jambudvipa•· 79 arc mixed with mercury that originates from water, herbs, and coal, it comes to look like a single substantial mass that resembles a lump of fresh butter. Even though these various component parts may not be apparent to the sense organs such as the eyes, the mind can still know that this is composed of various elements. Confused individuals will think the lump is butter, fa t, or something similar. Some will consider that, when in con­tact with fire, this could be the cause fo r producing gold; while alche­mists might see it as a conglomeration of substances with the potential to change depending upon circumstances. Under cold conditions, [the lump] can endure indefinitely similar to a lump of butter, and when in contact with heat it will turn the color of copper, bronze, or brass. Like­wise, when baked in fire i� will resemble ordinary gold, and when thor­oughly fired it will turn as golden as the water gold ofJambudvipa. At that point, it will be immutable regardless of exposure to heat or cold. The alaya consciousnessb that possesses all the propensities that give rise to appearances can be understood in a similar way. Just as the lump appears in various ways based on the contributing circumstance of the fields of experience of the senses, on different occasions [the alaya] gives rise to pure, impure, and extremely pure appearances concerning the environment, fo rms, and the domain of experience. Just as it is possible to know that the lump is composed of a conglomeration of elements­whether the karmic propensities within the alaya are actually evident or not, it can be known through the mind that the alaya possesses all the seeds fo r the limitless phenomena that reach throughout time and space. In the same way that the lump can be mistaken fo r butter, there are those who apprehend the appearances of the all-encompassing alaya as that of the self and phenomena.

For alchemists, the lump may not appear as pure gold, yet they know it is not other than gold. Although it may look like mercury, it does not transform into mercury. Nonetheless, it is not the case that there is no mercury at all because mercury is said to be volatile by nature, easy to change, and capable of eventual disinte­gration. Conversely, the nature of gold is far more stable, resists change, and does not degrade. Even in contact with raging fire, [gold] will not disintegrate. Likewise, as conditioned phenomena, all impure appearances are unsta­ble and extremely deceptive. Nevertheless, the easy-to-change appearances of past and future lives can be exhausted by practicing on the path. Since pure appearances are in opposition to impure ones, once a pure body and pure field of experience have been mastered that which was once impure will never reoccur. Moreover, when exceedingly pure supreme exaltation free from suffering is generated, as a result [pure appearances] become stable and undeceiving. Consequently, if the lump composed of a vari­ety of elements is carefully observed, its intrinsic nature as gold becomes self-evident. Similarly, the alaya, coo, that possesses a variety of factors and appearances becomes self-evident as the domain of pure appearances. Once all habits of temporary confusion are exhausted, it seems certain that appearances generated by that [confusion] will cease to arise. Because it is impossible to make a separation from the nature itself in the radiance of the space of the original ground, unimpeded, spontane­ously present appearances are irreversible. Similarly, since wisdom's self­appearances are taintless, it must be known that that is the abiding genuine nature. That being so, if the phenomena of sarp.sara are established as the perfectly pure nature of the deity, one may wonder what is meant by the perfectly pure deity. The genuine deity of the nature of phenomena• is the wisdom of indivisible appearances and emptiness, the vajrakaya free from the obstruction of transition. In the nature of phenomena just as it is, even the subtle habits of obstruction are exhausted and enlightenment is one taste. This is inconceivable fr eedom from the extremes of one or many; and although free from all fields of experience based on characteristics, this nature appears as every knowable thing.

For the first, chose with lesser intelligence may claim that the reason the universe and inhabitants appear as pure is because of meditating upon them as pure while on the path, but that in truth they are not pure since suffering and the cause of suffering obviously appear. In our system it is also accepted that those with impure intelligence and vision perceive the appearance of things as impure. If everyone could see appearances as pure, what basis would there be fo r debate? If that is the assertion, then although things appear in this way. the way things really abide is otherwise; and given that things naturally abide as pure, there is the following response. It is not necessary to see things as they truly are because, through confusion, the tainted mind perceives them mistakenly, similar to how visual cognition may mistakenly perceive a white snow mountain as blue. Therefore, in Entering the Middle Jtay it states: When emptiness is taken as the argument, whoever objects and replies will have no response at all. Instead that response will be the same as th<it which is being proved [i.e., emptiness]. Thus, as taught, this is what needs to be understood. For example, when phenomena are proved to be empty, whatever is used to prove the lack of emptiness such as the phenomena of karmic causes and results and sarpsara and nirvaQ.a, even that proof is itself similar to the original subject being proved that can be determined as nonex­istent. Logic that refutes emptiness cannot be fo und in the domain of chat which is knowable, because no matter to what extent one attempts to disprove it-like adding fuel co fire-[the argument] will in effect sup­port the logic that validates emptiness. Likewise, even here, no matter to what extent phenomena are proved to be impure, the proof itself is also an object to be proved as pure.

[One could then say that] when purity is taken as the argument, whoever objects and replies will have no response at all. Instead, that response will be the same as what is being proved [i.e., purity]. Thus, it is. (Some claim that] if sentient beings are buddhas, then when they [i.e., sentient beings] suffer in the hells, buddhas would have to be suffering. Such logic cannot be maintained because suffering in the hells happens in accord with the mental outlook of confused persons who have yet to real­ize the abiding nature. Because they are not yet buddha, the way things appear to them does not cancel that fact; yet according to the way things abide, suffering and the like are nonexistent. In the Extensive Magical Ma niftstation [Matrix]• it states: For one who lacks the discerning mind that knows the fu ndamen­tal nature, Even the pure lands of the sugatas will be seen as lower realms. If one realizes the meaning of evenness according to the supreme vehicle, Even the lower realms will be seen as the Akani�h�ha of Manifest Joy [i.e., Tu �hita]. Thus, this is similar. Furthermore, there are some who claim that, if phenomena are primor· dially awakened, it should be obvious to everyone and, as a result, it would be unnecessary to practice the path. Assertions such as these come from those with rudimentary intelligence, who are true objects of compassion. Their claims are equivalent to saying that, if a conch is white, even some­one with impaired vision has to see it as white, in which case there would be no need to even try to cure impaired vision. This is why the inability to see things according to their way of abid­ing indicates that things appear tainted by confusion. In order to dispel confusion, it is necessary to become familiar with the path; and because the intrinsic nature of phenomena is emptiness, in order to actualize this it is all the more necessary to become fa miliar with the path.

Since purity and evenness are mutually supportive, the key point is that the process of reasoning is iden­tical as well. Both purity and evenness constitute the nature of things; and because this is supreme, establishing great purity is a factual and extremely potent reasoning that cannot be defeated by anyone. Second, there are those who may claim, \"Well then, purity is acceptable according to this explanation; but ifbuddhas' wisdom sees all knowable things only as the nature of purity, then do the buddhas see the subjects and objects that appear according to the perspective of confused beings? If not, then how can they be omniscient? If so, then that means they are seeing impure phenomena.\" [The answer is] although phenomena appear as impure, [buddhas] know things just as they appear because of omni­scient wisdom that knows everything. Ultimately, however, impure phe­nomena do not exist; and, consequently, that which exists as impure will not be seen by them. Buddhas see precisely how a subject holding co true existence fixates upon objects as actually existing, yet they do not see phe­nomena to be established as true because, fo r them, it is impossible to see the true existence of even a single particle. Consequently, all knowable things fall within the omniscience of the buddhas' wisdom appearances, proving their ability to see chat which is perfectly pure. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I.J.2.I.2 Proved as Evenness Second, fo r provinggreat evenness [there are two]: the logic proving even­ness and how certainty is gained.

Second, those with keen faculties will analyze the mind according to its origin, place of abiding, and destination. Through that, the power of expe­riencing the three enrranceways to perfect fr eedom-the [mind] empty of cause, result, and characteristics-will enable them to gain simultaneous certainty in the meaning of the evenness of appearances and emptiness.

When unexamined, even if these things seem to exist, upon analysis their true existence can­not be fo und. If they conclude that a lack of existence is the fundamen­tal nature, they will be left with a partial understanding of emptiness; in which case they will alternate between emptiness and appearances such chat nonexistence itself becomes a mere designation that ultimately does not exist. On the other hand, by the consideration that [appearances] occur while being primordially empty, an exceptional certainty is gained such that appearances occur yet are empty and arc empty yet apparent, like a water moon. This is then referred to as the lack of true existence and dependent arising occurring without contradiction, or as an under­standing of what is meant by their unity. Even though the absence of true existence and dependent arising are said to be designated as dis­tinct, in terms of rheir nature not even the slightest difference exists. Through gaining certainty in chis inseparability, one's concept of fixa­tion by combining the appearance of the basis of negation while deter­mining the object co negate naturally falls away. Whatever arises is free from elaboration, similar to the ability to rest naturally without proving, refuting, adding, or removing. When constant familiarity with freedom from elaboration gains momentum, all indications of the dualistic field of experience based on the biased, conceptual mind that cognizes indi­vidual aspects of the nature of phenomena in dependence upon every fe ature of conditioned appearances are purified. By giving rise to excep­tional certainty in evenness as the intrinsic nature of phenomena, one then reaches perfection. Concerning this process, there are fo ur stages, namely, emptiness, union, freedom from elaboration, and evenness. By reliance upon under­standing the fo rmer, one should be able to engage in what succeeds that; fo r until certainty is gained with the previous, the subsequent cannot be proved. For that reason, to believe that the fu ndamental nature is merely nonexistent, nominal genuine truth• does not even approach the meaning of evenness that is being taught here. Just understanding the negation of true existence as applied to the individual existence of pillars, vases, and the like has no potential to establish evenness that results in the collapse • nam drang pa'i don dam (rnam grangs pa'i don da m)"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT �O-Jr::.�·��·�a.rara·s·r::J·s�·£J·��·��rq4�·�1 ���·�·I:\\{�;O-Ja·41.!0-!'�·��·s41.l·O-!�:l\\· ��·t::l�·��·\\l�'O-!'?O-!'t::l'��·tO-J�t::.·q·�·�r::J�'��a.·O-!'?O-!'t::l'�'q�9�'t::]�, ��· �:l\\·U!r::.·��·41.l�, 9�·9�·�£r9�·il�·£r·4�·�, ��·Ui�·g�·a·�sr::.�r£1·4�1 ��· �:l\\·���·�r::,·���.ril�·t::l, ���9't::l�·�£t9�·iJ�·4�'t::] :t_'$�, ���·�9�·�:::,·, O-l\")J-1'9��·�9·t::la.·;J'?J-1'9��·��� ,�a41.l·�:t_·��·�·��r::.·ara·�r::.·1 ���·Q·\"'l· �9�'Q�·q��·�, ��:l\\'JJ'El�'%�·�r::.·9·�9'Q�'U!Z::,'1 �JJ·a;�·q�·�,�·a!·41.!�1 �\\�r::.�·��·�JJ�r�r;;;·JJ\")JJ'q·��·��9�r�·�·\"�·41.l�·���·q·UJ�·41.ll �·U!\"' !f]�9·Ui�·�·!fj��·��·!fj�JJ'�'JJ'Lq�'�1 14�'�41.l·��a.·�·��·0-1��·�9'fJ9·q· 9�9·�·U!r::,·q��·q-l:·�c(\\�l 1�lS�q·�9�·q��·q8_·�\\��� ���·�q41.1·��· ��·�O-!�·-o�·�·O-l\")�·r;:J·i)�·41.!·9��·�·i)�·�r::.·, 9��·��s�·i)�·��·O-Jf3r::.·q·��· �·U!r::.·�!!]·t::!a·�·q�,,��·!!]�r::.�·�, '"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT 147 of concrete phenomenal perceptions, such as acceptance and rejection.

The appearance aspect of this as kayas and wisdom is proved through the mode of sy lla bles. This is the manner in which, from the single sound of the syllable ah, a variety of syllables arise based on the circumstance of their origin. The blessing of these two [i.e., kayas and wisdom) is reciprocal, as well as being free fr om meeting and parting. In this way the [direct realization] of the great dharmakaya­inseparable purity and evenness-proved through the fo ur realizations and experienced as self-discerning awareness that transcends the mind is the explanation given fro m the point of view of the gradual developers. An alternative to this is the one taste of phenomena within the nature of the inseparable truth of purity and evenness, which constitutes the single cause. That which exemplifies this is the mode of sy lla bles, such as om indicated by ah, u, and ma-these three-that reveals the inseparable intrinsic nature of the three enrranceways to perfect freedom through enlightened body, speech, and mind. By the fo rce or blessing of these two modes of logic based on analogy and meaning, phenomena are clearly shown to be primordially awakened as great purity and evenness. Although this meaning is explained according to scriptural transmissions and upadeshas, this is not just an intellectual understanding based upon the words of the scriptures and upadeshas because the confidence of direct realization can occur in the depth of one's mind. In order to establish the view of mantra through these fo ur [realizations], initially this is explained as union, which is the point of view of the instantaneous realizers. In either case, the fo ur realizations, such as the single cause and so fo rth, are called \"modes of logic\" because of the infallible manner in which they engage the profound view of mantra."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"(! . w-. if Wr . i-( ;;i:! � i=:i- i1r • =--i?F t! i?F <;.fill i.( !1b, !'1 ;:( ,b,. trrr u K \" -IT · £7 UlP !\"\"'\" flr · !'7\" · <;1{ '!\" !f\" l'f � C}( � if i(; i1 � i(; G!Q ET � )� G� l'f !J tf � ;;'� f7 tG � if t:r � �� it � iJ ilfiW G� � (�-�( � � .;j:T i< u �� to fb !7 !1 itl u g El i?; ET }!JC l! c;}( � i?; }}( � !1 !I if l! � � fJ? i? tr ur !7 � ;;}( w !6 r.!-f> tr � u � . it Gil t6 jo _ET .tr [1 i(; . jo G� � }� � J7 u f! �-� � � }!Jl � u to !7 GEl .c· HI �.>?

A brief explanation that indirectly points this out to them is as follows. First, fo r non-Buddhists who doubt the authenticity of the Buddha, in their own Vedas\" it states: An omniscient guide entering the world in a royal caste or that of a f�hi is as rare as the appearance of the iidumwarab flower. When entering her womb, his mother will dream that he enters in the fo rm of an elephant. Following birth, he will pos­sess the major and minor marks. If he fails to take ordination he will become a chakravartin, and if ordained he is destined to awaken as a buddha. Hence, this quote verifies the existence of the Buddha. As fo r logic, the path taught by the Buddha, such as the selflessness of the person and so fo rth, is proved through factual reasoning that also establishes the actual path to liberation. In consequence, fo r all those who aspire to liberation, the Buddha is shown clearly as an authentic teacher and the path he expounds a perfectly correct one. This can also be proved according to the teachings fo und in Establishing Valid Cognition< and other texts. Furthermore, fo r those hearers who accept the Buddha but do not accept the emptir.ess taught in the great vehicle, a quote is taken fr om one of their Hinayii.na sii.tras: Form is like a bursting bubble. Thus, it is taught. Since the five aggregates are composite and momentary, if they are not realized as lacking true existence then not even the selflessness of the • rik ched chenpo zhi (rigs byed chen po bzhi): nyen ngak (snyan ngag, rgveda); sid sung (srid bsrung, atharvaveda); ngey jod (nges brjod, sdmaveda); and chod )in (mchod sbyin, yajurveda) budum vam • tsd ma dri4p pa (tshad ma grub pa)"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT �t:.'I:J'�l·a.p:J�0\\·��·£1J:;'I:J'�Z:J'dl:�(lJ'�O\\·�·��:;_·CJ·(lJ�l'����·I:J·�J:;'CJ�CJ· q·l�·1 UJ�.OJ�·(lJOJ'I:J·��·��·���·���·fu·�·�l·E!CJ'Mfl�·�·.lJ�·�.rl�·(lJ1 ��· ........ .....,.,- .....-C'\\ ........

For this reason, the way of attaining liberation in accordance with emptiness can be established based on what is taught in the jewel Ga rland.' Furthermore, fo r those on the path of siitra who fail to accept the profound view and conduct of Secret Mantra, it is predicted in the sU.traMonarch of Entrusting Oral ln structionsb that mantra will fo llow [sutra]. In the siitraArranged as a Stalk< it states: While evenly abiding as the intrinsic nature of all buddhas, Not remaining and with no expectation, Such a person becomes a tathagata. All fo rms, fe elings, perceptions, consciousnesses, and minds Are purified as countless tathagatas. Such a person becomes a great sage. So, the five aggregates are shown to be the intrinsic nature of the tathagatas. In the treatise Stainless Renownd it states: Passions are the ancestral heritage of the tathagatas. Thus, and the explanation that being free from attachment is perfect liberation is meant fo r those with pride; whereas, fo r those who realize selflessness, it is taught that the intrinsic nature of their desire and the like is perfect liberation. In addition, in the surra Perfect Ma nifestation of Ma fijushri\" and others it states: All passions are the ground of vajra awakening.

Rather, contemplate that satpsara itself is nirval)a. Thus, this reveals why sarpsara is the state of awakening. In the Sutra ojthe Great Bounteousness of the Buddhas• it states: Even though the many realms of the world May burn beyond reckoning, Space will never be destroyed. Such is the case with self-originating wisdom. This quote and others reveal the meaning of self-originating wisdom. Fur­thermore, in the sutras it is taught that all sentient beings possess self-orig­inating wisdom. There are countless teachings that explain how, although this realm of Buddha Shakyamuni has always been pure, it is not seen as such. There are even statements in the sutras that explain how the body of a fe male can please the Buddha: 0 Bodhisattvas!

This can be proved by all scriptures that introduce the wisdom of the fo urth [empowerment]. Logically, the universe and inhabitants are established as primordial purity and evenness, and as a result nothing needs to be newly attained on the path. Those who realize this with confidence will also come to know that the bondage of exertion is a great obstacle to the path. By relying upon the practice of resting in the natural state, one will easily gain mas­tery over wisdom's self-appearances. Indeed, unless proficiency is reached in the preceding stage, the fo llowing stage should not be practiced. As a means to cleanse [the perceptions that obscure] the wish-fulfilling jewel of the buddha nature, the Buddha taught the stages of the vehicles much like the rungs of a ladder. For this reason, if the profound secret is taught to those with lesser faculties who have not yet reached proficiency in the preceding stage, they would either fo rsake it out of fe ar or denigrate it. That is why it is advised to keep it absolutely secret. It will be very easy fo r those who have gained certainty in the mean­ing of great evenness described in sl'ma to realize the profound view of unsurpassed mantra once they are introduced. Therefore, it should be understood that those who are learned in all stages of the vehicles will be capable of proving the logic of the fully perfected vajra pinnacle. . All of this has been a mere approach to reasoning, fo r if carefully cat­egorized [the explanations] would be limitless. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I.4 The Purpose Fourth, the purpose of the view is twofold, both general and specific. First, just as those who pursue any path will commonly engage it accord­ing to their own view, those who meditate on the vajra vehicle can only engage in the context of realizing purity and evenness. If they lack chis view that resembles their own eyes and legs, then meditation will only be an attempt toward the path.

Moreover, if phenomena did not abide as purity and evenness, it would fo llow that meditation upon the universe and its inhabitants as the support and sup­ported wisdom deities would constitute meditation upon that which is false. In that scenario meditation would be mistaken; bur since that is cer· tainly not the case this meditation is upon the way things are, and hence it is unmistaken. In regard to conduct, if all activities are [engaged with the view] of purity and evenness, such as fr eely enjoying the desirables without accep­tance or rejection, the fe arless conduct in union and liberation, and so fo rth, then they are acceptable because that would constitute conduct that is harmonious with the view. If that were not the context then, as explained according to the common vehicle, conduct such as that would be deemed careless and need to be abandoned. lherefore, it is due to the key point of purity and evenness that all conduct on the level of mantra becomes significantly meaningful. Regarding maQ<;iala, in order to indicate the intrinsic nature of the inseparable nuQ<;iala of the ground and result, there are the illustrative [maQ9ala] and the maQ4ala of the path. To realize the resultant mat)<;iala by means of the path, if it were not the nature of the ground even the path itself would not be perfectly correct and, consequently, a pure result could not emerge. Since the maQ9ala is established according to the ground, it is in harmony with the genuine nature. As fo r empowerment, the three doors-including their inseparabil­ity-primordially abide as the fo ur vajras. Similar to a candle illuminating a vase or a finger pointing out the moon, the strength of empowerment imparts understanding, experience, and realization. If this [primordial nature] were not the intrinsic nature, then there would be no genuine truth to be introduced through empowerment, so attainment through empowerment also depends on this. In respect to mantra's samaya, it is said that one should not harbor doubt about phenomena being naturally pure as the deity or objectify nonconceptual evenness. If purity and evenness were not [the nature of phenomena) , it would be untenable to consider that by holding to that [view] with a sound mind a root downfall could actually occur.

If it were otherwise, then the meaning taught in the lower vehicles would hold true; in which case it would be illogical to think that a downfall is derived by abandon­ing that which is to be abandoned. It is not the case that mantra's samaya cannot be transgressed; bur due to the nature of purity and evenness, cer­tainty is gained that it is untenable to oppose any conduct based upon this view. From that perspective, samaya is indeed difficult to transgress. As fo r accomplishment, the aggregates, elements, and sense sources are indivisibly accomplished as the deity. If this is the manner of their abid­ing, it makes sense to conclude that this will be actualized by practicing the path. If not, then [practicing the path] would be as fu tile as trying to wash charcoal [until it is] white or attempting to meditate on the mind as matter. It would be impossible fo r anything to occur. Likewise, it would be unfeasible to accomplish indivisibility with the deity, so practice would be squandered. On the other hand, due to the nature of purity and even­ness, practice can never be wasted in such ways. With reference to offering, in mantra the most impure substances in the world, such as the five meats, five ambrosias,a.sz and others, are arrayed as the main offerings. If they were actually impure, it would be offensive to offer them to the deities. One may think that through the blessing of mantra and mudra [the substances] are purified, so it is acceptable to con­sider that pure substances are being blessed by mantra and mudra and then offered. What would be gained by offering impure substances? As with Kriyatantra, even though it is a requirement to make pure offerings, in this case the fr amework of accepting or rejecting clean and unclean has collapsed, which is why the five ambrosias and others are accepted. Offer­ings are rendered perfectly pure based on the reason that everything is by nature pure and equal. In respect to enlightened activity at the time of inner mantra, all prac­tices of enlightened activity email the visualization of oneself as primor­dially indivisible with the enlightened body, speech, and mind of the tathagatas. Such enlightened activity is congruent with the deeds of the tathagatas, so it is exceedingly effective. Were it not fo r one's primordial nature as the deity, the practice would be a mental fa brication contradict­ing reality and could not be proved as sublime.

For the first, there are the two samadhis of the generation and comple­tion. To practice the generation stage, there are four practices that purify the habits of the fo ur places of birth. The most extensive is to generate the heir of the self, the heir of the other, the five actual manifestations of awakening, and the fo ur vajra rituals. The middling is to generate the three rituals, and the concise is to generate solely through mantra accord­ing to Anu[yoga]. The extremely concise is meditation instantaneously perfected upon recollection according to Ati[yoga]. Alternatively, in accordance with birth from the womb and miracu· lous birth, there are two [aspects of the] generation stage that are taught fo r the gradual developers and the instantaneous realizers. Furthermore, there are five distinctions based on the five stages of practice, such as great emptiness and so fo rth, as well as multitudes of distinctions such as the samadhi of visualizing the meaning of the fo ur mudras of enlightened body, speech, [and] mind, including enlightened deeds. In actuality, whatever is considere d part of the stage of generation is referred to as \"the samadhi of the nature as it is.\" Second, the completion stage includes both the path of method that relies upon the upper and lower gateways and the path of liberation that includes both the gradual and simultaneous practices of nonconceptual union. For the second [i.e., duration], there are three. The first meditation based upon devotion involves the practice of the blessing, the practice of symbolic indication, and the practice of completion.

Finally, the third meditation [of completion] called \"instantaneous\" is when a practitioner perfects samadhi by realizing the pure intrinsic nature, like a reflection effortlessly replicated on dear water. The entirety of mantra is subsumed within these three.

The first two impede the ability to engage with samadhi, the third impedes the actual practice, and the final two obstruct the increase of samadhi.

Now, according to the key points, this will be explained as an upade­sha method fo r practice. By the power of having heard the oral instruc­tions on the method fo r mind placement and the faults of not achieving samadhi-as opposed to the qualities of achieving it-yearning and interest [i.e., aspiration) are generated. Through the exertion of extreme concentration, laziness and so fo rth are eliminated. Placing the mind on whatever the object of fo cus may be, such as the view of the generation and completion [stages], constitutes the first method. At that time, even if [the mind] moves like flashing lightening not static for an instant, one must train repeatedly by generating joyful exertion. Having heard the instructions on samadhi and then through the strength of contemplat­ing the meaning, to maintain the continuity of abiding with the previ­ous fo cus as much as possible is the second [method]. During these first two methods, although [it is] difficult to abide with continuity the mind must be placed with the continuity of attentiveness by being alert. When the mind moves like a shooting star and is distracted from the continuity of the previous fo cus, to bring it back and maintain the course through attentiveness-like channeling raging water-is the third [method]. Since during these first three methods of placement the experience of movement [of the mind] is like paper carried by the wind or a cascading waterfall, concepts are so rampant it is difficult to abide even momen­tarily. There must be diligence devoid of discouragemem, like building a dam to contain raging water. It is important to understand that, when this extremely difficult-to-tame wild horse of the mind is tightly bound by the rope of mindfulness, it can then be led by the halter of exertion and placed in the corral of relaxed evenness. When the strength of recollection is somewhat stronger than before, the mind begins to achieve some stability as the objective fo cus begins to fade away. Then with single-pointed intro­spection, to fo cus only with proximate placement is the fo urth, similar to a soaring vulture continuously circling its prey. Rather than flying off. it attempts to land on its prey; yet unable to remain, it continues to circle above. Similarly, at this time the mind is beginning to relate to the object of to cus, so it is important only to maintain stability with constant mindful­ness. Now, a sense of joy toward samadhi emerges naturally; and inspired by placement, like a honey bee not remaining on a single flower for long"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"!-< :r: '-' :i c:: < .... o.l u ... 0 1>.1 u z 1>.1 Vl Vl 1>.1 \\D !::' • • }cr • .

Since placing [the mind] in proximate placement and taming are some­what easier than the preceding methods, these two are called the \"experi­ence of attainment.\" Even though this is the beginning of the development of samadhi or the attainment of subtle warmth, like the example of water rushing down a gorge, there are multitudes of subtle concepts that are still turbulent, erratic, and unceasingly dense. Nevertheless, the analogy of water rushing down a gorge is not as intense as that of a cascading water­fall. Within the context of taming, [the mind is] similar to a bee caught in a jar; unable to get out until set fr ee, it continually flies around in the jar. Here, although the mind is fo cused on its object, the movement of concepts still remains unceasing. Now, it is crucial to remain vigilantly fo cused without wavering. When abiding with vigilance if elation or leth­argy occurs, once one resolves to dispel them and applies the appropri­ate individual antidotes the onset of negative concepts will be naturally tamed and pacified. This is the sixth. When [concepts are] pacified in this way without the fa ults of elation or lethargy similar to muddy water becoming clear, the mind must be placed without distraction. Like a person at rest, now is the time to abide vigilantly within evenness. Like cloudy water gradually becoming clear, by virtue of the increase of the subtle pacification of concepts through the proximate pacifying of even all secondary passions that are themselves the origin of proliferating concepts, the elimination of distraction is the seventh. At the time of pacifying and proximate pacifying, all faults of distrac­tion are placed at a distance. Resembling the flow of a river, this is called the \"experience of familiarity.\" Although a gently flowing river seems to be motionless from a distance, when observed up close the flow is unceasing; likewise, although the mind seems motionless, when carefully observed there are still many subtle movements. At that time, the key point is that one must continue to increase this [i.e., samadhi] through exertion.

Without losing effort, [one's] concepts will be power­less to interrupt. Abiding with single-pointed fo cus is called \"being with recognition\" or \"single-pointedness,\" and this is the eighth [placement] referred to as \"the experience of stability like an ocean free from waves.\" \\Vhen one abides with an effort-based fo cus, then attentive concentra­tion is engaged without interruption. It is now important to fo cus on evenness. By increasing the state of recognition, attaining the evenness of naturally engaging without the need to apply effort is the final, nimh stage of the abiding mind. This is also called \"the single-pointed mind of the desire realm;' attained through the strength of tOtal familiarity with the preceding stages. At this point, the experience of perfection-like a motionless moun­tain-begins. When the single-pointed mind of the desire realm is accom­plished, it effortlessly merges with the object of fo cus and abides there naturally during all activities. When [the mind] remains natural without thoughts, phenomena cease and the ensuing experience is similar to the mind merging with space. Upon arising fr om that, it will feel as though the body is newly born. Even during the subsequent-to-evenness experi­ence, the stronghold of attachment, aversion, and the like are so weakened that they discontinue. When clarity is the predominant experience, it may seem as though the particles that make up a pillar could be counted even though they are microscopic. Each of the experiences of bliss, clarity, and no thoughts will now arise. Sleep as well will be as though merging with samadhi, and dreams fo r the most part will manifest as pure. Although this samadhi seems to represent either truly existing or coarse tranquil stillness, it must be considered a basis fo r the common path of both Bud­dhists and non-Buddhists. If this level is still not sustained through refine­ment, then it will not become genuine tranquil stillness. How then could it ever become true seeing?' Moreover, the experience of bliss, clarity, and no thoughts has two categories, namely, either resting in the evenness of the nature as it is or not. Therefore, it is important to be well-informed concerning the crucial points of the path in order to not consider erratic experiences of the abid­ing mind to be elevated stages of accomplishment on the path. When one becomes familiar within this single-pointed mind of the desire realm and both body and mind are fu nctional, this is called \"refinement.\" By master-• UJ ag tong (!hag mthong. vipashyand)"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"180 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT ���·�·�·4�·�·��·t::p,�·�q�·�·��'!;J\"t::]4�·�·�9·q3_·��!f]�·�·�·�·a.�\\t::l11'll' �q�q·%�·1 �J-I�·a.��·q�·���·�·q�·q·5·�a·���·��·d!�·��·ar��·�s�·? ........ .........�:'\\ � c-.

This is called \"tranquil stillness.\" In this way, whether one trains in the generation or completion stage, the practice will be genuine.

Nevertheless, conduct is primarily classified to be the time after even­ness. In this regard, there can be many aspects of conduct based on the way the inner heat will be achieved and the way the practice will be enhanced, which are categorized as elaborate, undaborate, and extremely unelaborate. In addition, there is conduct fo r beginners such as the newly ordained; and fo r those who are able to deal directly with circumstances, there is unconventional, fearless conduct. Once stability is attained, there is what is called \"the conduct of sustaining the status of a ruler.\" There are many fu rther ways of naming and classifying conduct, such as conduct that is fu lly transcendent, conduct that is victorious over all directions, and so fo rth. From the perspective of time, there is the conduct of initially engag­ing, fo llowed by the conduct of accomplishing siddhi and, finally, the conduct of the accomplishment. First, by relying upon a vajra master, empowerment is received, samaya is guarded, and the upadeshas on how to practice without transgressing the master's command are received. The second includes everything that belongs to the branches of approach and accomplishment. For the third, the conduct of the accomplishment means it applies to all enlightened activities that are subsequent to the attainment of siddhi. All paths of Vajrayana are complete within these three divisions. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.J.J The Manner of Accomplishing The third has two: the general and the specific. For the first, the common vehicle teaches that all desirable objects are impediments on the path. Why then are the [desirables] to be accepted here?

For the maQ<;iala of enlightened speech, one visualizes the man­tras of the principal deity and retinue and repeats the recitations. For the maQ<;iala of enlightened mind, sa111sara is pure in its place by taking the five poisons as the path of the five wisdoms, without rejection. Third, the resultant maQ�ala of perfection is that, when the path is fu lly perfected and the state ofKuntuzangpo is attained, kayas and wisdom are free from meeting and parting. It is also acceptable to make categories fo r that, such as the mar:t4alas of the three kayas, five wisdoms, enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities-these five-and others.

For the first [i.e., the preliminaries], the earth is to be examined by knowing how to determine the sky, the earth, and the atmosphere. If determined to be suitable, then permission to use the place is requested from the visible and invisible owners. Visualizing the purba to be Perna Kilaya, one stakes the earth and takes possession of it. Then one examines the Open-Belly Lord of the Earth,87 buries a treasure vase, and levels the earth. The earth is then fully purified through the five [methods] of plas­tering [to make smooth], fire offering, mantra, mudra, and samadhi. 1he borders are marked with five weapons to protect the ground.

Since the entirety of phenomenal existence never departs fr om being the inseparable truth of that which is to be known-the tantra of the ground-that is the nature. All practice upon the path is the nature of this ma!)Qala, which is the object to be accomplished, or the topic itself. Since the ground and result are inseparable, all appearances that occur during the ground and the path are also, ultimately, spontaneously pres­ent within the nature of the result to be attained. On the ocher hand, since the fundamental nature of the inseparable truth of the ground of purity and evenness is free from all speech, thought, and expression, there is no subject to understand, no object to accomplish, and nothing to attain. There is nothing to understand through conceptu­alization since this transcends the mind, and by primordially abiding in the present it is not necessary to accomplish this through a path. As fo r the phenomenon of there being something to accomplish, when examined nothing exists; so there is nothing to accomplish. Primordially present, nothing is newly attained because ultimately nothing exists to attain, leaving nothing to be attained. When seen in this context with a mind that knows the profound meaning of the two truths: according to the conventional designated way that things appear, there is something to accomplish; and according to the genuine way that things abide, there is nothing to be accomplished. Like the saying \"anything unable to be accomplished will be accomplished;' similarly, this is how the mal).t;iala's nature should be understood. 2.2.2.2.].2.2.4.4 The Pu rpose For the fo urth, since the root cause fo r establishing the dharma kingdom of all the buddhas is the king of dharma itself [i.e., the mal).�iala], it is extremely important to know that all paths of mantra originate in reliance upon this and that all paths and results are of this nature. In short, the maQ<;iala must be understood through the view and estab­lished through meditation. Moreover, it is also necessary to engage in conduct that is not separate from this. [MaQ<;iala] is the source of empow­erment and the object to engage through accomplishment, the object fo r making offerings, and the fo undation fo r all enlightened activity, mantra, and mudra.

The vase empowerment purifies the body and channels as the nirmi.i.Qakaya, the secret empowerment purifies the speech and winds as the sambhogakaya, the wisdom prajfla empowerment purifies mental activity and the vital essence as the dharmakaya, and the word empowerment purifies the three doors collectively as the abhisambodhikaya.

In addition, concerning these fo ur empowerments, there are many individual explanations throughout the tantras relating to the categories and diversity of the rituals. This tantra also teaches three empowerments, namely, the benefiting, enabling, and profound. If the profound empow­erment is included within the enabling, then there are two.

It is taught that supreme siddhi will then be achieved. According to that, the vase empowerment has two divisions; the benefiting and enabling [empowermenrs]. For the peaceful benefiting empowerment, there are ten sections, such as the five essences, the crown, and so fo rth. For the wrathful benefiting empowerment, there are the well-known, twenty-eight inner sections that bring benefit, such as the seat, deity, hand emblems, and so fo rth.

In order to accomplish both purposes, there is the all-pervasive word of the vajra ruler empowerment. These five are called \"enabling empowerments\" because, not only are they beneficial, they also grant the potential to accomplish enlightened activities since the actual empowerments are conferred. The three profound empowerments are the conferral of the secret empowerment fo r those who engage in fearless conduct without con­cern fo r what is clean or dirty such as partaking of the five meats and the fiv:.: ambrosias, the wisdom prajna empowerment conferred upon those who practice the fe arless conduct of the consort, and the fo urth empowerment conferred on those who practice the fe arless conduct of the evenness of phenomena. These are called the three profound or higher empowerments. 2.2.2.2.J.Z.2.5.3 How Empowerment Is Established Third, empowerment is the indispensible, initial entrance fo r the prac­tice of mantra because the extremely difficult to realize, primordially indwelling mal).<;iala of the ground-the inseparable truth of purity and evenness-is directly encountered through the profound empowerment ritual. Therefore, this is the special method fo r bringing fo rth the matu­rity of the wisdom of the fo ur vajras. If one were to wonder how the process of maturity occurs, it is by means of the inconceivable power of the gathering of two root causes and fo ur contributing circumstances. In fact, empowerment either produces the authentic realization of profound mantra or awakens the potential for this to occur in the mind stream. For that, the harmonious root cause is the exaltation of the purity and evenness of the nature of phenomena that inseparably pervades a disciple's channels, winds, vital essences, and mind. The simultaneous root cause includes the substances of the first empowerment, such as the vase and so forth; the substances of the second, the bodhichitta from guru and consort; the substance of the third, the prajfia consort; and the substance of the fo urth, the expression of words and indications.

One will have longevity and well-being, [and] TI1e fr eedom of the higher realms will await one. Similarly, it is also taught in the tantras that simply seeing the [ empow­erment] macygala will bring immeasurable benefit! In short, empowerment is the only door through which to initially enter the Vajrayana path. Since this is the special method that allows one to meditate on the paths and achieve the results, the view of mantra will arise in the stream of mind; meditation will be in harmony with the view; through conduct, momentum will be gained; accomplishment, offerings, enlightened activity, manrra and mudra will all become meaningful; and samaya will be received. 1his is why empowerment is really the source of everything since, similar to a king who establishes the levels of succession, every aspect of the path relies upon empowerment. Ultimately, there is nothing to confer or receive. When the meaning of the state of perfection-the primordial great dharmakaya-is realized, the empowerment of the strength of self-awareness is received. According to Mahisandhi, this is the consummate empowerment as stated in the [root] tantra: When nonduality is realized, that is the great mudra. Thus, it is as taught.

Thus, as it is taught, the term \"samaya\" translated as \"word of honor\" means that which should never be transgressed. This means that whatever mandate is issued by the buddhas becomes the subject of training fo r all practitioners to either correctly accept or reject, without transgression. z.z.z.z.J.2.2.6.z The Divisions For the second, there are two: the general and the specific. First, if mantra samayas are synthesized, they are combined within three: the general, spe­cific, and surpassing samayas. Although general samaya teaches the vows of personal liberation, bodhisattvas, and the samayas of the outer tantras, none of these categories should be carelessly transgressed because they are the roots and branches fo r the samayas of unsurpassed mantra. This is why the term \"general samaya\" is used. \"Specific samaya\" means the root and branch samayas that are well known and taught within the context of unsurpassed mantra. \"General\" [samaya] also means that, since all vows of personal liberation, bodhi­chitta, and mantra must be guarded by practitioners in general, they are referred to as \"general.\" The minds of practitioners have different capaci· ties based on fa culties, view, conduct, enlightened activity, and so fo rth, so the guarding [of a vow) is specific to each individual's capacity. There­fo re, this also explains the term \"specific samaya.\" Unsurpassed samayas are kept during the time of the great accomplishment practice when there are special vows to guard in addition to the usual vows, such as the phrase \"do not destroy the lion's abdomen\"88 and others.

Furthermore, there are various levels of samayas that are taught in the individual tantras both concisely and extensively. Here, they are explained as five roots and ten branches, totaling fifteen. Since these are the ultimate crucial points of all inner Secret Mantra samayas, knowing and not transgressing them constitutes maintaining samaya; which is why it is so important to be informed con· cerning these crucial points and guard the samayas accordingly. The five root samayas are not abandoning the unsurpassed, respecting the guru, not breaking the continuity of mantra and mudra, caring fo r and loving those who have entered the perfectly correct path, and not explaining the secret meaning to unsuitable recipients. The ten branches are not abandoning the five poisons and accepting the five ambrosias. For the first, \"not abandoning the unsurpassed\" refers to the ultimate fundamental nature of phenomena, which is the great dharmakaya truth ofinseparable purity and evenness. This is unsurpassed because it is impos· sible fo r there to be a higher path or result aside from realizing and attain· ing this [nature]. Hence, one should believe in this and never abandon it. If this is not abandoned, then the Triple Gem and the bodhichitta ofboth relative and genuine truth will involuntarily never be fo rsaken. The precise realization of the genuine fundamental nature of phe­nomena is buddha, and gaining understanding of this is the meaning of sangha. If one believes in the unsurpassed and does not abandon [this view], it becomes impossible to consider fo rsaking those who have real­ized this, namely, the arya vidyadharas, the buddhas, and the dharma that endures in their enlightened mind streams. It is natural that, through this, the ground, path, and result of the Triple Gem are subsumed. At the time of the ground, the minds of sentient beings abide as the nature ofbuddha. Not separate from that-like the sun and its rays-the dharma abides as the speech of the wheel of syllables. Since all sentient beings possess these qualities, they become the field through which merit is accumulated-the sangha. This establishes the Tr iple Gem. In addition, the three doors of practitioners are primordially awakened as the nature of enlightened body, speech, and mind. The paths of gen­eration and completion are the dharma, and those who internalize these [paths] arc the sangha. This is the Tr iple Gem at the time of the path. Fur­thermore, the one who has perfected the path is the Buddha, his teach­ings are the dharma, and those who practice are the sangha. These are the well-known Triple Gem.

In this way, even the Triple Gem at the times of the ground, path, and result has never been differentiated other than being the sole nature of the truth of inseparable purity and evenness. As the genuine jewel of the fu ndamental nature, it is here that everything is perfectly equal and the reason everything is sustained through practicing the unsurpassed. Concerning how to uphold this, there are two ways. Even if certainty has yet to be realized, according to the scriptures [samaya] can be sus­tained through devotion. Otherwise, by discovering confidence in the view as the primordial condition, once it is known that there is nothing to abandon [samaya] is sustained through certainty. For the latter there is no reverting back, such as reentering lower paths and so fo rth, because one is capable of ending [the lower paths] with this certainty. Therefore, the one who holds this view is called a \"vajra holder\" since holding the vajralike nature of mantra in one's stream of mind gives the potential to subdue the negativities of sarpsara and nirviiJ;la. Genuine bodhichitta will also not be abandoned since the ultimate, genuine fundamental nature of the inseparable truth of purity and even­ness is being sustained. Relative bodhichitta will not be fo rsaken since one has generated the bodhichitta based on the motivation and action of accomplishing buddhahood in order to protect all sentient beings fr om negativity. That is relative bodhichitta. By seeing with conviction that the state of absolutely benefiting limitless beings as a buddha can be accom­plished, one is able to permanently bring an end to the impure mind that engages lower paths, including giving up on buddhahood, discourage­ment, disdain toward sarpsara, and the like. In the [root] tantra it states: All limitless sentient beings and I Have always been buddha. Knowing this to be our nature, I generate bodhichitta. Thus, this is similar.

In that way it is possible that these states of mind can cause obstacles toward the cause and buddhahood will not be accomplished, like the way a burned seed will only produce a deficient sprout.Ifbuddhahood is viewed as that which depends only on personal effort, the mind will be forced to rely only upon contributing cir­cumstances. Consequently, except fo r having a firm commitment toward the bodhichitta, ordinary individuals will be incapable of gaining enough confidence to never fo rsake the bodhichitta. Here, fr om the perspective of the way inseparable relative and genuine bodhichitta are generated without delusion, even through the generation of relative bodhichitta the confidence achieved is extremely stable, mak­ing it impossible to be lost even by someone on the level of an ordinary individual. That is why it is taught that even an ordinary individual who understands the emptiness of mantra is equal in status to a nonreturn­ing bodhisattva. This is how the emptiness of unsurpassed mantra is the genuine deity of the nature of phenomena and proves that, fr om this perspective, even all deities who arise as the symbolic mudra will never be fo rsaken. By maintaining the life essence of this view through accom­plishments with meditation and pure samaya, nothing will ever degener­ate while everything will remain perfectly pure. Even though it is impossible fo r one who has gained confidence in the certainty of the meaning of unsurpassed mantra's nature as it is to fu lly commit a root downfall, the way that those who have entered mantra with devotion might fo rsake the unsurpassed is as fo llows. A downfall occurs if, due to lack of faith, one contradicts the profound view of the nature of inseparable purity and evenness and the fearless conduct of mantra that is congruent with that. This is as explained in the fourteen root down­fa lls. Two fu rther root downfalls are to doubt the meaning of the universe and inhabitants to be the pure nature of the deity by thinking that this is taught solely as a means to guide disciples to be tamed and is not actually the case, and by clinging to the meaning of evenness as something with characteristics and reference, which is completely contrary to great even­ness. These constitute root downfalls by virtue of opposing the view of mantra and, thereby, absolutely preventing the genuine nature of mantra from arising in the stream of mind.

One thereby prevents one's opportu­nity to internalize the profound conduct of mantra. The remaining root downfalls are established in reliance upon [first] the vajra master fr om whom teachings on the profound meaning of mantra have been directly received, [second] the vajra relatives who uphold the meaning of man­tra, and [third] the sentient beings to be tamed by mantra through keep­ing the secrecy of (1) the continuity of mantra by not allowing it to be squandered, ( 2) the teachings of the victorious ones that either directly or indirectly reveal mantra's meaning, and (3) the speech of the vajra master and the many philosophies taught in order to discern the distinctions of mantra teachings. These are all posited as root downfal ls because they are connected with the exalted view and conduct of mantra itself, making all of them signi6cant points that must be cherished so that mantra will not be wasted. Concerning advice given to show respect to the vajra master and main­tain the secrecy of mantra and so fo rth, it is clearly stated in the tantras that, if these points are not carefully guarded, the fa ults accrued will be significant. If opposed, this becomes a violation of the conduct of mantra because of being so divergent, which is why it is taught that these fo ur­teen root downfalls alone are in extreme contradiction with the view and conduct of mantra. Therefore, even if one is incapable of comprehend· ing the profound view and conduct of mantra, [these samayas] must still never be disparaged because that would bring about the inexplicable fa ult of abandoning the dharma. If empowerment has been received, then the root downfall would occur. Once empowerment has been received although there is no contradic­tion if one is unable to immediately internalize the profound conduct of mantra, one must at least hold the aspiration to be able to someday prac­tice this [conduct] while never turning against it. As the ultimate wisdom intent ofVajrayana even if one is unable to gain confidence in the scope and profundity of the view, it is necessary to pray fo r the ability to give rise to this view in the stream of mind. It is unacceptable to reject the view by claiming it is incorrect.

One must recall the inconceivable nature of phenomena. Whoever fa ils to accept it Will fa il to know the nature of phenomena. The perfect buddhas and their heirs Are always known by all awakened ones. Thus, since this is similar, careful consideration must be applied to this. Second, respecting the guru is as fo llows. In general, since all qualities on the path depend upon the spiritual guide, it is even taught throughout all the siitras that one must view the virtuous spiritual guide to be the same as the Buddha. In particular, without reliance upon empowerment received from a vajra master as well as upadesha instructions, it is impos· sible fo r the path of mantra to blossom in one's stream of mind. That is why, although the nature [of the guru] is equal to all buddhas, fr om the perspective of kindness [the guru) is surpassing. Due to this, it is taught that, rather than making offerings to the buddhas of all directions and times, it is of greater benefit to make offerings to a single pore of the guru. If one were to lose faith in a guru89 who conferred Vaj rayana empower­ment and oral instruction or disturb the [guru's] mind through body or speech, based on the weight of the impact this would constitute the first root downfall. If general distinctions are made concerning gurus, the guiding guru is one who opens the door of dharma. For example, this would be the abbot who gives monastic vows. The mind-liberating guru teaches the dharma, the upadesha-instruction guru is similar to the teacher from whom bodhi· chitta is generated, the vow-restoring guru is the object fo r the confession of negativity, and the samaya-empowerment guru confers empowerment. In addition to these five, there are other spiritual guides fr om whom some dharma may have been received who are general gurus, making six. One must respect all common gurus in the same way that a patient would rely upon a doctor. Respect must be shown to all uncommon gurus who have revealed the path of mantra by seeing them as actual buddhas.

It is taught that the level of respect must surpass that shown to a king, an uncle, parents, or one's eyes and heart. The guru who con­fe rs empowerment, explains the tantras, and reveals upadeshas is a vajra master kind in all three ways:·90 so it is required to show this master the greatest respect. Third, not breaking the continuity of mantra and mudra is as follows. Given that enlightened body and speech are indicated by mantra and mudrii, there is the nature as it is of oneself, of the deity, of secret mantra, of recitation, and of radiation and reabsorption. Possessing the nature as it is in these five ways means that the continuity of mantra is not broken. Not losing the continuity of mudra is fo urfold, namely, the great mudra of visualizing the wisdom deity, the dharma mudra of concentration, the sacred mudra of expression, and the activity mudra of movement. How is the continuity kept? At best, one would not break the continuity of mantra and mudra by practicing three or fo ur times in a twenty-four hour period or, at least, fo r one session. The middling would be to practice at least fo ur or six times a month. The least would be to practice once a month or to not lose the practice by engaging at least once every season. It is also necessary to make as many offerings as possible without postpon­ing these activities fo r many months and years. If one holds the attitude of forsaking effort toward the mantra and mudra of deity practice, then this root samaya will gradually diminish. Fourth, the samaya of the vajra relatives is to have love fo r those who have entered the perfectly correct path. Until enlightenment is reached, one should not break the continuity of feeling loving affection toward vajra relatives. This applies to the great vehicle in general and, in partie· ular, even more so in mamra fo r those who have relied upon the same vajra master, are of the same maQ4ala, and have received empowerment and upadeshas together. It is a root downfall to abandon them fr om one's heart. In general, it is explained that there are fo ur relatives.

The fe eling of deep affection toward any of them should never be abandoned. Fifth, as it states in the [the root tantra]: The secret meaning must not be publicly exposed. Thus, exposing the secret meaning means to knowingly speak about the profound view and conduct of mantra, as well as the fa ults of the vajra master, brothers and sisters, and so forth, to any outsider who is not meant to hear this since they may be an unsuitable vessel. Here, there are fo ur ge neral secrets: the profound view of mantra, outrageous conduct, the images and names of the deities, and the signs of accomplishment, all of which must never be spoken of without good reason. The intermediate fo ur secrets are that, until the practice is complete, it is necessary to main­tain secrecy concerning the place of accomplishment, the time, the com­panion, and the substances. That which is worthy of secrecy means that which may cause others to lose fa ith or that which may cause obstacles to the accomplishment of siddhis, which is why the mantra substances and materials are used in secrecy. The vow to maintain secrecy refers to whatever the vajra mas­ter and relatives have entrusted to be kept secret. Who is this secret kept from? It is kept from those who have damaged samaya, have no empow­erment, and lack faith. Secrecy must be maintained as strictly as possible with body, speech, and mind. Like this, the samaya that accomplishes authentic qualities is when the mind abides with the meaning of the unsurpassed, speech recites mantra, and the body possesses mudra. Since all vows of mantra are ultimately subsumed here, these three should be accomplished. The remaining three samayas are either based on abandoning or guard­ing. Supportive of the first [i.e., abandoning], those [samayas] help guard from inappropriate activity such as disturbing the guru's mind and the like. Otherwise, showing respect to the guru who is the source of siddhi is subsumed within the samaya of accomplishment. Pleasing [the guru] is also foundational fo r the first two. These five are like the trunk of a tree, as they sustain the basis fo r all qualities of mantra. Each of these five can also be applied to the body, speech, and mind as aspects of the samayas"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"\"\"' :X:: <:) '\"\" � < <.L1 '\"\" u \"\" 0 <.L1 u z � \"' \"' � � � }[( � rin v­L( B' i-6 \"� a � L( �.r· i:7 � e-}� '� i-< �­}if if }iiiJ d6 }� i:=r i37 � if if lf if i1lV\" ttg-if lf � FT � � ..:i.c--­u a � Gtc' E7 )g � � � 4r }i::T ev [; i-< � i:1 itt � }� i-< }ll u ..:i:l is? i.r }WltO .-;{! a i:T � t() f!S !V\" Glf7 Gi.p i{ it6 lr i.r � !9� i:I cc:5 M;ffr i.O> • � � e-[; � � itt '1C E7>W\"\" �. -� ww 'u (£ i-< if m GlfP if . i(l(1j) � • [7 ii'£ IJl a if lf lf itt i:1 it6 • � }� � � �( i.r;.9 m if --}ET t() • ,'lt{ ii'£ � tf l< }ET m. if ii'£ iiiJ G\"Eil> � i-< a a io� a:r [T j:l? i-< �gw i:T • • 1-( ,ii'£ G\"hP 11:7\"\" • v--� G16 !7 ii'£ ET:\" w-� . {� !8? 1-( � � G� !1l'J !filf1 ii'£ 1:7\"\" 1:7\"\" G� }� (iltr'Gfi1> i:7 � !77? � � !0 � $ !lif � G(f G\"� �· L( ii'£ � [[' 1-( !R' !7 � ;() }[] v--f\\1( }� � t?if 1..( lf i;\\7. a � i-<?

In addition, they can be distin­guished as aspects of samaya to be guarded and accomplished. Second, it states [in the root tantra]: Do not abandon delusion, desire, anger, Pride, or jealousy. Do not discard the white and red nectars, urine, fe ces, marrow, Or the pure vessel and inhabitants.91 Thus, like that, these five poisons are held by the hearers as objects to aban­don, held by bodhisattvas as objects to purify, and are taken as the path by mantra practitioners. Due to these differences, [mantra) is increasingly more exalted through method and lack of delusion. Well then, why are the five poisons not to be abandoned? Just as it is unnecessary to dig a ditch fo r a water mirage, ultimately there is no substance that exists to be abandoned. Relatively, if sustained through method like the transformation of poison into medicine, [the five poi­sons] support the path. In truth, everything is primordially awakened as purity and evenness, so everything becomes similar to the acknowledg­ment that one who was once thought to be the enemy is in fa ct a loved one. This completes the explanation about both the earlier [i.e., five poi­sons] and the latter [i.e., five ambrosias]. If sustained through method the way this becomes the support fo r the path is that, even according to the paramita vehicle, merit is accumulated in dependence upon the passions. For example, giving the gift of one's body is more meritorious than giving material things because attachment to the body is greater. This also brings about the cause fo r accumulating great virtue. Bodhisattvas who have not yet achieved mastery will inten­tionally not abandon the passion of desire in order to accumulate merit through the cultivation of desire, which if sustained through method can by nature turn into virtue. For example, the bodhisattvas who abide on the ground of devoted conduct will, through compassion, intentionally cultivate desire in order to fulfill the needs of those who are tormented by desire. Once desire arises, they experience the joy of bliss; and even though that is still desire, since it is sustained with the method of compas­sion, it transforms into virtue. The same applies to the other passions in various ways.

Because the mind has this dynamic potential, while on the path there will be great attraction toward the teachings of the path and the result. At the time of the result by seeing everything as that which is to be accepted and not turning against any phenomena, the nature of discerning wisdom­Amitabha-will be accomplished.

At the time of the result, the stain of confusion is removed from the genuine nature and the intrinsic nature of mirrorlike wisdom-Ak�hobhya, who has subdued all obstruc­tions and conquered all demons-will be accomplished. Delusion turns away from the actual nature of things so that, through lack of conceptualizing things, one will remain in the stupor of indiffer· ence. Because the mind has this dynamic potential, then while on the path there is no fixation upon characteristics. At the time of the result by not conceptualizing any field of experience based on elaboration, the wisdom of the space of phenomena-Vairochana-will be accomplished.

Jealousy is an unbearable state of mind that fo cuses on a sense of inequality between oneself and others.

Nevertheless, when realized, they also drive all pure activities of enlightenment. Like the collapse of a shot arrow or a malfunctioning machine, without the strength of these five one's purpose will be unable to be fulfilled, much like a hearer abiding in tranquility. Given that it is impossible to completely block the mind's inner dynamic potential, it is unnecessary to try to prevent this because, if unstained by delusion, the five wisdoms will emerge. This is mentioned in the treatise Stainless Renown, where it states: A lotus will not grow from a dry place or a parched desert, only from water and mud. Likewise, unsurpassed, perfectly complete awakening will not be born from hearers who aban­don passions in order to realize the uncompounded. Since all passions are the heritage of the tathagatas: if a view like Mount Mehru is generated toward the transitory collections, this will give rise to unsurpassed, perfectly complete awakening. Thus, this is similar. Second, it is as taught: Wo rldliness is pacified when there is no desire, Ye t accomplishing mudra occurs when there is. Thus as pointed out, according to this world, desire-attachment is con­sidered to be a great fault; and although it is taught that if there is no desire the mind can be tamed, there are occasions when being without desire is unacceptable. For those who possess samaya according to outer mantra: if the mind has no passion fo r the consort explained to be the designated deity, siddhis will not be received. According to inner mantra: if the mind lacks great passion fo r the physical consort, chen wisdom and siddhis will not be attained. Likewise, it is taught that, if there is no desire, the siddhis of the consort will not be accomplished. This is why the amount of desire that exists will determine how much bliss increases in the minds of those in the desire realm whose faculties are suitable [to attain siddhis]. The amount of bliss sustained through methods will indicate how great waves of wisdom will become evident. This resembles how wood increases a fire and eating poison increases a peacock's luster.

In this way, although it is caught chat desire fo r material objects is attachment, having interest in the doctrine that leads to enlightenment is not considered to be attachment. Due to the differences of the object and the characteristic, their fu nctions change while the way in which the strength of the mind engages with its object remains the same. This is even taught in the si'mas, such as where it states in the Sidra Requested by Sagaramati:• The amount of hay put on a fire Will determine how the fire's strength will increase. The amount of passion a bodhisattva has Will determine how the fire of prajfia will increase. Thus, it is taught. Third, by fixation upon all appearances as ordinary and conceptualiza­tion by holding to a self and phenomena as true, the strength of the mind arises as the five poisons. Conversely, when one sees that phenomena are pure and that the intrinsic nature of self and phenomena lacks true exis­tence, everything is seen as evenness free from all conceptual fo cus based on characteristics. At that time, when any of the five aspects of the strength of awareness arise, that will be wisdom. For example, if a pleasing object is noticed, then those who are ordinary will-through fixation upon object and subject-develop attachment. Those who can endure hardship will, from the perspective of seeing this as unpleasant and so fo rth, reverse the mind of attachment. Here, the arising of concepts is encouraged with­out attempting to stop them. When sustained by the mind that realizes the nature just as it is, the appearance of subject and object as well as the experience ofbliss will nor only be unceasing, there will be an unimpeded experience free from conceptual reference points. This is desire arising as discerning wisdom. Since objects are unceasing-distinct, blissful, and clear-this applies to the others [i.e., passions] as well. A truth such as this is explained only in mantra's upadeshas fo r [ tak­ing passions] as the path, yet surra does give some indication of how • lodro gyatso zhii pa'i do (blo groJ rg ya mtsho.< zlms p,z'i mdo, sdgammatipm·iprcchdsutm)"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"l44 !:.�:iJ:::NCE 0.1' CLEAR LIGHT ���·qa·�q�·�\\l:J'<J.l'���·qa·��·�a·{;l�·<l.l�1 ��·;Jt:,�·qa.·;x:_t:,·q�O\\·\"'l�·�· 4�'t!]��·itl·q:x:_·�Oi·3J��·qQ.·�=:q4�·�l·U1·4�·�0i'�1 4�·��t:,�'�1 1 \" ..... ....- � C\\.

In the Sutra of the Mudra Engaging through the Power of Faith' it states: Wisdom is not other than the intrinsic nature of passion. The intrinsic nature of passion itself is wisdom. Thus, it is taught. The five nor ro be discarded are the five ambrosias. From the perspec­tive of evenness, the notions of dean and dirty are indivisible, with noth­ing to discard. Given that they are pure, they are objects to accept; and by utilizing them [i.e., the five ambrosias] without the notions of dean or dirty, evenness is experienced and the concept of materializing is suppressed through splendor. With fe arless conduct siddhis are swiftly received, and these five ambrosias sustained through method become the nectar of the world. Given that their [i.e., the ambrosias'] nature abides as the substance of accomplishment, they are to be accepted. Siddhis will be achieved by practicing according to the teachings, so fr om time to time one should not fo rget to make the offering of ambrosia. If the profound .meaning is not realized and this conduct is recklessly engaged, such care­less conduct could damage the mind. Conversely, once realization is mas­tered, it is no longer necessary to intentionally utilize [the ambrosias]; nevertheless, taking one's level of understanding into consideration and relying upon them [i.e., the ambrosias] as much as possible will support the view. This resembles training in the skill of swordsmanship, where one gradually makes use of wood, metal, and finally an actual sword. Without these ten branch samayas, then the practice of the specifi­cally swift and practical path, such as taking passions as the path itself and so fo rth, will not occur. Practiced in this way when passions themselves arise as wisdom, the passions become the nature of the truth of the path. ln addition, when the karmic aggregates arise as pure wisdom, suffering becomes the nature of awakening, which is why this path is so potent. In reliance upon the branch samayas, the profound conduct of mantra as well becomes naturally present in the stream of mind. If the root and branch samayas are listed extensively as it clearly explains in other texts,92 then there are three hundred and sixty. • dcd pa'i tob kycd pa Ia }I4g pa'i (hag gya'i do (dad pa'i stobs skyed pa Ia Jug pa'i phyag rgya'i mdo, shraddhabalddhandvatdramudrdsutra)"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"2.46 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT ���·�\"131·9·��\"-l·�·�:t;·�I IOJ�:t;·Oi·l�·OJ\")OJ'�O)·CT�·�Oi·\"-l�r�·�l�·?:J·�·�;� ��·�l·l��·�·��r�a,·le-r%�·tJOJ�·�l·a·�\"-l·Cj'·��·\"-l1 �:t;·l��·��·q��· \"i�.!(l�·�a·lOJ·%�·�·�0J·�·��·�:t;·�·�·a;l·i!l·� 1 �OJ�·��·fu·�OJ·��rl=-· Q.af���·��·�·Q.�\"-]·qa·lOJ·%�·�·�0J·�·�·i��·arl·�a·�:t;·�1 1 ....... � � � ........ :'\\.� t\\. r-..

If divi­sions concerning the stages of samaya that both directly and indirectly benefit this [awakening] were tO be listed, it would be limitless since there arc countless levels of samayas to tame the limitless concepts of sentient beings. 2.2.2.2.].2.2.6.3 Ihe Crucial Points Third, the crucial points concerning [samaya] are as fo llows. Within Mantrayana's samayas of great methods, all disciplines, vows of personal liberation, and bodhisattva training are perfectly complete and extremely pure. This may seem contradictory to what is commonly accepted as con­duct and may even seem to oppose the lower vehicles. Nevertheless, not only is that not the case, [mantra's] conduct surpasses that of any other. For example, it is taught at the time of personal liberation that a root defeat is based on the combination of object, intention, activity, and final result-these fo ur. Even in that case, personal liberation actually means to abstain from harming others. In addition to that, bodhisattva train­ing means to benefit others. Therefore, through compassionate intentions and without the stain of self-interest, a bodhisatrva could even engage in adultery and the like; and not only would no fault be accrued, only qualities would arise. It is taught that, based upon attachment tO personal interests, a defeat constitutes complete emersion with personal praise, dis­paragement of others, and failure to give of the dharma or personal wealth due to avarice. For the vehicle of mantra, based on having gained confidence with the view of evenness, there is no conceptualizing of object-subject; so what looks like killing and the rest lacks even the slightest ordinary object, intention, activity, or final result. According to relative truth: through the ac tivity of skillful means and prajti.a, this is a special means through which to fulfill the two enlightened deeds. Therefore, here [i.e., with mantra], fr om the perspective of being unsullied by faults there is personal libera­tion, and from the pet:spective of benefiting others the bodhisattva vow is also perfected. Like iron gradually becoming silver and then gold, the end value is included in the initial worth.

First, the samayas are just like a wish-fulfilling jewel, the source that fulfills all needs, as well as the life essence of all principal vir­tues. Whoever transgresses them will be like a damaged vessel that can no longer hold the essence. Since all mantra accomplishments will therefore be wasted, samayas are like the ground supporting all qualities. In order to accomplish the dharma kingdom of all the buddhas, this [i.e., keeping samaya) is indispensable! Second, if one possesses the samayas of mantra, immeasurable, sublime qualities will be attained. That is why, for instance, according to the gen­eral vehicle, that which is called \"view, conduct, and support\" describes the three trainings of prajiia, samadhi, and discipline. Even fo r that dis­cipline, the [vows of the] higher are more sublime than the lower; and although there are immeasurable ways in which the bodhisattva vows are more sublime than those of personal liberation, if synthesized it is as fo l­lows.Jusr as the great vehicle is more sublime in seven ways, such as great­ness of intention and so forth, the vows supporting this are also more sublime from the perspective of being profoundly vast, accomplishing the two aims, not contradicting twofold selflessness, and so fo rth. In fact, the qualities of this are inconceivable. Not only that, the samayas of mantra are even more profoundly vast than the bodhisattva vows in the way that the qualities are exceedingly more sublime. This is summed up in the root ranrra as follows: Furthermore, the supreme victor Kuntuzangpo ... Thus, as taught, there are seven. For the first, sealing with the mudra of Kuntuzangpo, the unsought, spontaneously present qualities are as follows. Those who are hearers are born from the speech of the Buddha; so since they are nor of the buddha family, not being sealed by the mudra of Buddha himself means being sealed only by the mudra of blessing. Since bodhisattvas belong to the fa mily of the Buddha, although sealed by the Buddha himself they still believe buddhahood is yet to be accomplished; so they are not sealed by the mudra of spontaneous presence.

Second, the \\'iay the strength of blessings [for mantra practitioners] is sublime-based on how the principal worldly gods and their retinues see them as objects of respect-is explained in the following way. Although Brahma, Indra, and others respect the hearers, this is not the same as the way they respect bodhisattvas. Although bodhisattvas are respected, it is unlike buddhas since buddhas receive the greatest respect of all. In addi­tion, respect shown fo r those who possess vows and practice is similar according to the stages of categories just mentioned. Therefore, those who possess mantra samayas and have joined the domain of the buddhas are respected by all great worldly gods, their retinues, and the 9akinis and dharmapalas who will care fo r them as though they were buddhas and cherish them as their crowning jewels. This companionship will further enhance [the practitioners'] strength and potential. Third, given that the buddhas and bodhisattvas consider [mantra prac­titioners] to be their heirs or relatives, the way in which their blessings swiftly emerge is as fo llows. Just as it is certain that the authentic son of a chakravartin ruler will one day rule the kingdom, the vidyadharas whose minds arc one with the wisdom intent of the Buddha himself will be fully acknowledged and referred to as \"the heritage of the tathagatas.\" Just as an image is reflected on a clear pool of water, the Buddha's blessings will swiftly enter the mind streams of those with pure view and meditation combined with the potency of samaya. Fourth, since [the practitioner's] field of experience is in harmony with the Tathagata himself, the way that this is sublime is as fo llows. Since a mantra practitioner will not lose the continuity of the deeds of the Bud­dha while abiding in the meaning of original purity and evenness free from acceptance and rejection, this way of abiding is in harmony with the domain of the tathiigatas. Upholders of the other two vows are not like this because they are fo llowers of the aryas and ground-level bodhisattvas, which is why the field of experience of mantra samayas is sublime. Fifth, since phenomena are seen as the pure land ofKuntuzangpo, the way that all fe ar and anxiety diminish is as fo llows. The phenomena of sarpsara originally abide as great purity and evenness, so being without anything to accept or reject is the pure land of Kuntuzangpo. The mind that realizes this abides without the torment of the passions and suffering"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"154 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT ._. C' .; _.., c-...

When being carried away by a river in a dream, those who recognize the experience as a dream will have no fear and will know that, if they awaken, the nightmare will cease. Likewise, free from seeing sarpsara and enlightenment as the place to abandon and the antidote, there will be no attempt to practice the path of rejecting pas­sions. Then one will abide while sustaining the supreme prajfia that knows the intrinsic nature of the passions and so fo rth, without allowing great mindfulness to decline. Sixth, the way whatever vows have been taught according to the con­ventional and definitive meanings as perfectly pure and subsumed within the nature of spontaneous presence has already been shown. Seventh, even if [ samayas] decline, they can be restored through the method of fulfillment as fol lows. Since all hearers mainly emphasize fix a­tion upon material phenomena and the activities of body and speech, if their [vows] are damaged then-like a shattered clay pot-there is no way to restore them. The bodhisattvas do not materialize phenomena; so by emphasizing the mind and relying upon a spiritual guide, all degenera­tions can be completely restored and made stronger than before. Likewise, if a gold pot has become damaged, it is possible fo r a skillful blacksmith to restore it and make it even more magnificent than its fo rmer state. In man­tra it is asserted that great purity and evenness are realized, and the mani­fe station of the magical nature is mastered with awareness. Even without relying on someone to restore degenerations, it is possible to restore them through one's strength alone like how, if a gold or silver pot is denred, it is possible to repair it by oneself without the help of a blacksmith. This is how the seven qualities are possessed, which can be limitlessly expanded upon. Alternatively, these qualities can be subsumed into five categories as follows: the first quality is the inconceivable samaya of the unimaginable nature of phenomena, while the fo urth and fifth can be sub­sumed as one based on the distinction of the nature and its function. In short, \"samaya\" means to not transgress or even waver from the view; to abide within the mai)Qala; to maintain the meaning of empow­erment in the stream of mind; and to not fo rsake meditation, conduct, accomplishment, offerings, activity, mantra, and mudra. Putting an end to anything that is not in harmony with all of these is the samaya of ces­sation, or guarding. Since this nature permeates everything and does not transgress the path of mantra, it is the nature of the deity as well as vajra mantra.

The siddhi accomplished through various stages that are to be attained is what is meant by actual attainment, or siddhi. The nature is that, through the exceptional methods of Secret Mantra, the goal of accomplishing whatever is desired-common and supreme siddhis­occurs through the stages of approach and accomplishment. 2.2.2.2.].2.2.7. 2 The Divisions This has two parts: 1 General explanation 2. Specific explanation For the second, there are the general explanation and specific explanation of the exceptional accomplishment gathering. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.J.2.I General Explanation The first has fo ur. First, if based upon the objective to accomplish, there are two: the common and supreme siddhis. For the common there are both lesser and greater activities, and fo r the supreme-by distinguish­ing the temporary and the ultimate-there are two. According to the common, practices such as resuscitation of the dead, longevity, mirror divination, and so fo rth, are taught. Supreme siddhis are accomplished through Vaj rasattva, the accomplishment gathering, dharma medicine accomplishment, and others. Second, if distinctions are based upon supports there are various outer material substances, inner mantra recitation, abiding in samadhi, and physical exertion, such as the ways of gazing and the like. In reliance upon these fo ur, siddhis will be accomplished. Each of these can have two, three, fo ur, or limitless individual distinctions. Nevertheless, if sub­stances alone are relied upon, then even the accomplishment of subtle enlightened activity is not fully qualified although it may be referred to as \"accomplishment.\" Among the eleven topics of tantra, authentic accom­plishment refers to the exceptional methods that easily and quickly pro­duce the ultimate result. Even so, when lesser activities are sustained with exceptional methods and praji'la, such as compassion and so fo rth, they too become branches of the perfectly correct path. Since [such activities] may be necessary, it is temporarily acceptable to accomplish them. One may wonder what the difference is between enlightened activity"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"� b' . �J71? . . � it'� � il. � � � u . . .

Third, if determined according to the nature, there are two: accomplish­ment based upon the generation stage and upon the completion stage. Fourth, if determined according to the way accomplishment occurs, there are two: the approach and the accomplishment.

One may wonder why this accomplishment is referred co as \"exceptional.\" The reason is that it is sublime by way of cause, nature, and result-these three. First, the blessings are surpassing based on how siddhis are accom­plished through the simultaneous gathering of male and female prac­titioners who have acquired all necessary outer substances and attained inner strength. Second, results can be achieved without hindrance since there is continuous effort applied toward the fo ur branches of approach and accomplishment. Third, the state of an immaculate vidyadhara will be attained.

The five fully endowed circumstances are the place, time, teacher, reti­nue, and substances. Among them, the first means any auspicious place with an excellent location that is free of obstacles.

When these five fu lly endowed circumstances are present, the profound practice of accomplishment occurs through the fo ur aspects of appl\"'ach and accomplishment. First, fo r the fo ur branches, the approach means the way in which the deity is pleased. From that, the close approach is when the accomplishment of siddhi is imminent. Siddhi is then received, and this complete accomplishment constitutes what is called \"the great accomplishment.\" Then, in order to dispel conflicting circumstances, the outer bound­aries are set; the samaya violators are suppressed; and by dosing the inner boundaries, the maQ<;iala is erected. In addition, preparation of the m:u;<;lala, deities, vajra master, substances, and disciples are the five pre­liminaries. In the blessed place of the abdomen of the liberated matra1?J rudm,94 the illustrative maQc,iala is drawn and the accomplishment sub­stances arranged. Furthermore, all other substances are blessed according co the manual. This is the actual practice. Reciting mantras and making various offerings to the maQ<;lala, as well as entering and receiving em pow· erment, are the stages of the conclusion. Everything up until this point constitutes the stage of approach. Then, by having maintained the practice through effort in recitation and meditation, to see the sign of the approaching accomplishment of siddhi is the close approach to the deity. Then if [the deity] is peaceful, one can transform this into a wrathful deity or whatever deity has been practiced, whether peaceful or wrathful. Through concentration on the radiation and reabsorption of the deity and mantra recitation, all desir­able things such as fo od, drink, ornaments, and clothing are utilized as empty bliss. 1hrough this practice that pleases the deity with dance and various gestures of mudrii and the rest, when the signs of siddhi are firm"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":". � . i:T �� ic> . � -. -!J1> i:6' !7 Of �.... !J' i:7 tiiR<\" u-� &..( !.r;:9 dfj) Of t() !1> � j({ G'l£ r.? . � R) v-t6 . i1r G1'l j({ • i:7 � i:6' I{ t() � W � f! ii£ � [1 IT it'£ (7 1-( lf r.? o l{ I() t7 � . }!Ji ir w � !7 l( ftG\"' ,i:f f6 ¥ � � U � f6 lpi> ((f f7 G'� G'!f> !:f }!J � ro � >� � .

Among them, fo r the first, the approach is when one relies upon one's body to experience empty bliss through the unifica­tion of fierce wisdom; wind, and the subtle vital essence. The accomplish­ment is when one relies upon the body of another and connate [bliss] arises through the unification of the descent, retention, ascent, and distri­bution. These are the two. Each of them also becomes the four branches of approach and accomplishment by fu rther distinguishing the method and the outcome of the method. In addition, the fo ur branches of approach and accomplishment through the method of one's body are to receive oral instructions, become familiar, stabilize familiarity, and achieve perfection. Even with the body of another, the approach would be to know the oral instructions and magnetize a consort. The close approach is to bless the consort and unite the vajra and lotus. The accomplishment is when the first three joys arise, and the great accomplishment is when connate [bliss] is experienced. Not only that, even the fo ur joys abide as the fo ur branches of approach and accomplishment, which can be established based upon the fo rmer as the root cause and the latter as the result. In short, these fo ur branches of the approach and accomplishment have two distinctions, which are the original cause fo r whatever siddhi is going to be accomplished and the path that actually accomplishes this. Since it is also acceptable co delineate the two inner distinctions of root cause and result, this can be applied co all five paths. It should also be known that these (four branches J can be applied in various ways, such as to a single session. The second [for the completion stage] is the clear-light great perfection without characteristics. Although there at'e many paths with characteris­tics, they are only methods fo r realizing this one. The gradual developers will become familiar with the methods of those paths and eventually be able to enter this (path]. The instantaneous realizers, or those with keen faculties, are the special field to be tamed through Atiyoga, so they will not rely upon the methods of melting, bliss, and the rest bur rather will be able to enter this [path] solely through the power of the guru's upadeshas and the transference of blessings. Whatever the case, this is the authentic result of all other stages of completion.

Concerning that, the approach is to hear the upadesha pointing-our instructions in order to enter the great, natural, spontaneously present maJ:l�ala. This is similar to opening one's eyes. Understanding the mean­ing is the close approach, like witnessing the maJ:l�ala. The fa miliarity that occurs when one's indwelling wisdom is experienced is accomplishment, like having entered the maJ:l�ala. When familiarity is stabilized through the dissolution of exertion on the path and mental fixation upon the philosophies of the eight vehicles, like conferring empowerment within the mal)<;lala, the achievement of confidence with the meaning of\" the Great Perfection is the great accomplishment. Therefore, entering this great, natural, spontaneously present mary�ala does not occur through material substances and so fo rth, since this entrance occurs only through the strength of self-awareness. Unconrrived placement is the method fo r placement; and from that, when the personal clarity of wisdom that knows the uncontrived meaning of the intrinsic nature arises, that is the path of the Great Perfection-the result of the method of placement. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.J.J.2 1he Result of the Accomplishment Second, by accomplishing the path in this way, wisdom arises in :hree aspects: the wisdom of appearances, of emptiness, and of nonduality. For the first, according to the perspective of a generation-stage practi­tioner, the kaya of the contrived deity arises; and fo r a completion-stage practitioner, this [wisdom of appearances] is indicated within clear light through the twelve analogies of illusory phenomena. The limitless appear­ances of the kiiya of a deity accomplished just from the vital wind-mind arise merely as self-appearances. Second, having stabilized the samadhi of the generation [stagej, the appearance of the deity is dissolved and becomes nonconceptual. For a completion-stage practitioner who has relied upon the practice of method with characteristics, the fo ur states of emptiness will be experienced. At the time of the final emptiness, connate clear light will become evident. For the third, the union of awareness and space is the fundamental nature of phenomena freely experienced within one's mind as uncontrived natu­ral clarity.

Clear light as well means unceasing self-appearances, yet they are explained in this way based on what is being emphasized. Similarly, both terms-\"purity\" and \"evenness\" -when combined express an aspect of their individual distinction, while each term reveals the meaning of both terms. In regard to \"purity; the purity of relative truth is revealed in that everything is pure as the deity. According to the genuine, everything is pure without the characteristics of elaboration. In addition, according to the relative, \"evenness'' reveals chat buddhas and sentient beings are inseparably equal; and according to the genuine, everything is even in unelaborate space. No matter which of these two terms is expressed, both are capable of indicating the meaning of the pri­mordial buddha. Know that this is taught throughout the tanrras in vari­ous ways. With each of these three wisdoms, such as the magical body and so forth, the distinctions are based on experience and realization. Even tor experiences, there are various distinctions based on whether they are sta­ble, unstable, and so fo rth.

Since this subject is also taught in the paramita vehicle, it is needless to mention that it is illuminated in the vajra vehicle!

Thus, and in the Ornament of the Classes ofSutra• it states: It is believed that the mind is always the intrinsic nature of clear light, yet is stained by temporary fa ults. Except fo r the mind that is the nature of phenomena, other minds are not referred to as clear light, just as what they are.

The mind's nature, which is space and awareness primordially free from meeting and parting, transcends the object of conceptual duality and abides like che sky, primordially free from transition and change. When fr ee from the cloudlike, temporary dualistic concepts, wisdom arises from the natural strer.gch of the nature of phenomena through the power of the path. The experience of self-clarity without subject or object is called \"seeing clear light.\" To not waver from the self-manifestation of wisdom is to merely abide as the ground that is neither confusion nor liberation. That which wavers from the strength of self-awareness is misinterpreted due to circumstances and becomes the dualistic mind that is other than the ground. That is called the \"mind of confusion\" and, like a basket of woven grass, is the basis fo r all sarpsaric habits. When this [self-awareness] unmistakably arises, it is then referred to as \"wisdom.\" Why? Because this [wisdom] is lik e a fire that can burn the fo rest of the dualistic habits of sal'!lsara and bring about the state of perfect liberation. It is important ro not misinterpret these two crucial points. The difference between con­sciousness and wisdom is clearly illuminated in che dzogchen scriptures. Even in the surra Descent to Lanka• it states: 1hrough the mind, all karma is accumulated; Through wisdom, everything is fu lly liberated. lhus, and in the Ki ng ofSamadhib [siitra] it states: By knowing the intrinsic nature of the mind, Wisdom will increasingly emerge. Thus, it is taught. Although both consciousness and wisdom have che similar charac­teristics of being clear and cognizant, the difference is that objects are either seen just as they actually arc [i.e., with wisdom] or nor perceived just as they are and held incorrectly [i.e., with consciousness].

This is similar to the nature of water within ice. Although confusion occurs in this way, confusion occurs from within clear light; and when there is liberation, this occurs back into clear light. This is an extremely important point to understand ! In the Kalachakra it states: The outer schools of philosophy have not discovered awareness just as it is. We ll then, what is \"awareness\"? It is the emptiness of inner awareness and unchanging bliss. This was clearly explained in the world by all sages. If one wonders what that was: \"0 lord of humans! Wherever there is the appearance Of the entire threefold universe And wherever this once again dissolves, That is unchanging clear light.\" Thus in this way, although the ground is posited to be wisdom, since it is the space of phenomena-the union of appearances and emptiness­it is not just only voidness, because there is the aspect of the radiance of awareness. Irs own nature has transcended confusion and liberation, and without wavering from that it is classified as such based on the aspect of not being confused. Nevertheless, it is extremely important nor to mis­take this wisdom, which arises through the strength of the ground and realizes things as they actually are, with primordially liberated wisdom. The way appearances arise from rhe ground, the way in which confusion and liberation occur, and from that how it is impossible fo r confusion to reoccur once reversed within the ground must be known; and this is clearly illuminated only in the scriptures of che Great Perfection. A gen­eral explanation of this was given [in this commentary] at the time of the ground. In these ways, all training of Secret Mantra, such as mantra and mudd, that emphasizes the generation and completion is sequential. Complet­ing all branches of the paths that bring about whatever is necessary and accomplishing the temporary and ultimate goals both swiftly and easily, like magic, is called rhe \"accomplishment of Secret Mantra.\""},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"2.78 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT ,:-... \"� eo.. ...............

In brief, through accomplishment the meaning that has been estab­lished through the view is actualized, and finally the immutable ground will be reached. Accomplishment applies to all other topics of training because, by accomplishing siddhi through effort-based conduct along with mal)<;iala, samadhi, samaya, empowerment, offerings. mantra, and mudra, the needs of others are fulfilled through various enlightened activ­ities. Ultimately, all practices and their results are merely self-appearances. Knowing that-concerning the mind that is primordially awake-there is nothing to accomplish, to abide within the spontaneous presence of perfect evenness is the perfection of accomplishment.

From the perspective of the support, there are two, which are [offerings] that are made through the contin­uum of the inner three doors and offerings that are outer substances and necessities.

OF CLEAR LIGHT 283 rhe common outer offerings that are acceptable as mundane necessicies are also well known as the offerings. Uncommon, inner extraordinary offerings are the offering, support, fulfillment, and accomplishment substances that belong exclusively to inner mantra. The secret, superb [offerings] are the five poisons offered as wisdom. Offering phenomenal existence as exaltation is the view of great evenness and purity; meditation is phenomenal existence arising as the ground; and conduct is accepting union, liberation, and so fo rth with the view of naturally liberating what­ever arises. To synthesize offerings according to classifications, they are the outer offerings of necessities, inner offerings of samaya substances, secret offerings of union and liberation, and the offering of the nature as it is of great evenness. First, fo r the outer offerings, there are seven: the dance of mudra, songs of praise, mind of samadhi, various desirables, superbly conducive sub­stances, extraordinarily sublime methods, and phenomenal existence aris­ing as the ground. For the first, there are the many aspects of mudra, such as dancing with the feet, gesturing with the hands, gazing with the eyes, posturing with the body, expressing through dance, and so fo rth. For che second, from the perspective of melodies, there are many varieties such as the shatapa 95 melody and others. From the perspective of words, there are many such as invoking the sacred bond, praising, supplicating, pleasing, offering mantras, and others. For the third, through samadhi with faith and devotion as the basis, clouds of offerings all-pervasively manifest; and through prajfla it is known that they lack true, inherent existence. The fo urth includes the seven necessities, the six desirables, and, in par­ticular, clothing, ornaments, fo od, drink, usable things, dwelling places, and countries along with their wealth. The 6fi:h includes all uncommon offerings and support substances fo r the individual deities and protectors as mentioned in the scriptures. The sixth includes the fire offering and ochers, which is a fo rm of making offering through fire ritual as a special method that surpasses other offerings fo r satisfying the deities.

Third, the secret [offering] is explicitly defined as union and liberation, as well as the five poisons offered as five wisdoms and three poisons offered as enlightened body, speech, and mind. Fourth, the offering of the nature as it is means the offering of phenom­enal existence as the exaltation of purity and evenness offered to the sole vital essence of the dharmakaya.

Although the inner distinctions of these offerings are limidess, both brief and extensive explanations concerning this are given in the individual tantric classes. In this tantra the offerings of substance, fire rit­ual, samadhi, union, liberation, ambrosia, praise, and song are explicitly taught. According to the upadeshas of previous teachers, it is explained that there are fo urteen offerings of the peaceful and wrathful [as the root cancra scares] : Devotional prostration, mudra dance, Kuntuzangpo's fo urfold interlaced water offerings and the rest, Ambrosia torma, secret suppression, surpassing samadhi of union and Liberation, the desirables, music, song, and wisdom ... Thus, it is as taught. Concerning the wrathful, sprinkling the offering of rakta three times represents surpassing samadhi. Otherwise, the rest are the same.

For the first, if one were to wonder why this is referred to as \"general;' it is because the previously­mentioned distinctions of outer, inner, secret, and nature as it is are com­plete within this. Second, given that this is not just an ordinary offering and is, in fact, sublime among others, it is as stated [in the root tantra]: Among merit accumulations, the gar)achakra is supreme! This is similar. For the third, there are two explanations, extensive and brief First, when a group of fo rtunate practitioners gather with all the necessary materials, the accumulations of merit and wisdom are perfected by pre­senting offerings ro the gathering of deities who bestow siddhis. For the second, there are three: the preliminaries, actual practice, and the completion. First, in a place worthy of the gathering of man­tra's profound conduct, either an extensive maQ<;iala or the supports of enlightened body, speech, and mind are arranged. Otherwise, mounds of flowers equal to the number of deities are arranged. Following that bless­ing, as many suitable outer, inner, and secret offering substances as pos­sible are accumulated fo r the gal).achakra. There must also be meat and liquor or it is unacceptable. Then the male and fe male practitioners of the union of method and wisdom endowed with pure samaya are required to gather. There must be at least two [i.e., a pair], and beyond that there can be as many pairs as possible as long as they are male-female.

This is sublime because the object is being partaken of with the three doors as three vajras, so there is no difference between this and actually offering to the Buddha. Although the Buddha's wisdom kaya of evenness has no concept of being pleased or not, all manifestations of the wisdom kaya are still engaged according to the minds and aspirations of those to be tamed; so through this method that greatly pleases the mantra deities, the two siddhis are easily realized. Second, the intention is to partake of without fixation the great purity and evenness of the nature of phenomena, which includes all virtue that causes great awakening such as compassion, fa ith, and the paramita of generosity and the rest. Everything becomes the nature of the single taste of exaltation and emptiness possessing all supreme qualities.' Utilizing phenomena without fixation or rejection spontaneously perfects the paramita of generosity and efForrlessly brings about the result. Like that, once evenness is realized, discipline is unsurpassed and unsullied by any stain of faults. To be without disturbance and perfect the characteristics of wisdom is patience. To be without any decline while engaging in activi­ties that are meritorious is perseverance. To abide without wavering from evenness even while all faculties engage their objects and to see the intrin­sic nature of phenomena are concentration. To realize the unmistaken intrinsic nature that phenomena are unhindered and clear and co com­pletely transcend the characteristics of things are praj.ri.a.

To be completely invincible regarding any negative opposing factor is power. And to know nonduality, which is ro realize things just as they are free from fixation upon dualistic appearances, is wisdom. Furthermore, this [way of offer­ing] is sublime because of spontaneously bend-iring wanderers through­out all directions and times; and by [one] achieving indivisibility with the state of buddha, all qualities of the path are spontaneously accomplished, including faith and compassion.

That is why knowing this great vehicle Is the supreme way of pleasing the victorious ones. Thus, it is as taught. There is no mantra path that lacks the offerings of accomplishment, material substances, and devotional service. For example, there are the well-known eleven subjects of training, which are the view, meditation, and conduct while on the path; ma.t:l<;iala, empowerment, and samaya that are the three to maintain the fo undation; accomplishment, offerings, and enlightened activity that are the three to practice: and mantra and mudra that are the methods.

There are innumerable [activities] that utilize a variety of outer substances, including drawings of mal)4alas, fire ceremonies, stiipas, and images of enlightened fo rms, hand emblems, human corpses, and the five meats. Activities are physically accomplished through mudra, stomping, dancing, ways of gazing, and sitting; verbally through reciting mantra, singing songs, and speaking words of truth; and mentally through inten­tion, samadhi, and so fo rth. All of these enlightened activities can be accomplished individually or in conjunction with one another.

Since the deeds of the buddhas bring temporary and ultimate benefit and well-being to all sentient beings, this is attained not only by praying fo r results in the next life, but by relying upon the skill of mantra so that in this very lifetime one actually engages in the enlightened deeds of bud­dhas by accomplishing enlightened activity. For example, fo r those beings who are destined to plunge into lower realms to suffer unbearably through having accumulated extremely negative karma, some bodhisattvas are incapable of directly benefiting them and can only make aspirational prayers to help them in the future. Through the skillful means of wrathful liberation mentioned here, the continuity of their [i.e., the beings of lower realms] negative karma can actually be terminated. Likewise, through pacifying and the other activi­ties, [practitioners] are capable of accomplishing results in reliance upon the methods of mantra according to how their prayers have been directed. Such is the strength of the enlightened activity of Secret Mantra. In the [root] tantra it states: Since this is wish-fulfilling, The nature of names, words, fo rms, and the like Only appears as wisdom, Like the illumination of darkness And the transformation of iron into gold. Thus, this is similar. In addition, the aspiration prayers of the bodhisattvas are immeasur­able because they must fulfill the temporary and ultimate aims of all living beings according to their faculties, capacities, and intentions. Likewise, the enlightened activity of mantra is immeasurable. Concerning the dif­fe rences in aspirations, reliance upon mantra produces the potential fo r results to be actually revealed, which is also the paramita of aspiration.

For the first, accomplishment that occurs in reliance upon the comple­tion stage is as fo llows. If a practitioner possesses prajfla and keenest fac­ulty on the path of liberation, is capable of engaging the meaning of the Great Perfection without characteristics, and then receives the empow­erment of the strength of self-awareness that determines phenomena to be the expanse of the innate nature of the mind, the ability to control the phenomena of sarpsara and enlightenment will be gained. Whatever is wished fo r will be effortlessly accomplished through virtue of the inten­tion itself. Even if this level is not achieved but all activities are engaged with the view, then that [enlightened activity] will become supreme. For those with diligence, by combining the life essence and fo rm-where \"life essence\" means wind and \"form\" means empty fo rm-and through famil­iarity with the completion stage with characteristics, the kaya of wind­mind is accomplished. When that occurs, to merely visualize the deity of that method in order to accomplish any enlightened activity, that deity will then actually appear; and the potential fo r swift accomplishment will have been granted. Second, accomplishing enlightened activity in reliance upon the gen­eration stage means that, when a coarse and sub de clear awareness of the generation stage alone is perfected with the support of mantra, mudra, and so fo rth, one will be able to accomplish all worldly siddhis up to the [worldly] Akani�h�ha. If this level of the generation stage is accomplished, then even through the power of visualization alone any kind of enlight­ened activity can occur. Third, accomplishing activity through mantra recitation means that­by receiving empowerment and not allowing samaya to degenerate­through the power of mantra, if secret mantras are repeated with faith in conjunction with a sadhana, one will attain the ability to accomplish various activities according to one's wishes.

Within this great mudra of appearances, sound, and awareness, one naturally abides as the deity, mantra, and dharmakaya. Second, the temporary mudra of the path is that, in order to fa miliarize with this meaning, the three doors are accomplished as the three secrets through the wisdom vajra of the great mudra-the connate bliss of the fu ndamental nature of mind. Third, when all-pervasive, self-originating wisdom is realized, the ultimate resultant mudra is that the inconceivable deeds of enlightened body, speech, and mind will fu lfill the purpose of limitless beings fo r as long as space endures. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I0.2.2 Sp ecific Second, fo r the specific explanation of the mudd of the path, there are two: in conjunction with the generation stage and the completion stage. For the first, there is the great mudd of enlightened body, the dharma mudra of enlightened speech, the samaya mudra of enlightened mind, and the karma mudra of enlightened activity. Second, in conjunction with the completion stage, there are three: the consort as the support, the way of cultivating [qualities] on the path, and the way this applies to the fo ur resultant wisdoms. First, the dharma mudra is the emptiness of the intrinsic nature of phe­nomena-the mother praji1aparamita as the genuine consort. The karma mudra is the appearance of all fe male bodies with fe minine attributes; the samaya mudra is the wisdom mudra goddess emanating from one's mind; and the great mudra is rhe goddess arising as the intrinsic nature of the"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"316 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT ...... \" ...., t:\\ ........ ......, ��·�·�·��·��·��'I:;J?'J''l'��·3J'�.l;,·��·qr\\z::�·��·q�J1 ���·q·��·�·�t!j·�·�·q�·q·��·q·�q·�·Ui·4�'@1q·q�·��·��.J;,'q't!j�r;:_�· cr�::.·C-J'10-J'q.l;_'��·q·�9�·�, ���·�·��·��·��·�s::.�·q�·q·��·q��·c.J��· ·�6-l·��·q·�·��·�·�t!]·��11�a-��-��-���r£Jq·�·t!]��-%t!]�·�·���-�.l;,·� �!::q·�o.�·a;t!j·�-��-�-�� �-Ul�-��a,·q·q4·��-��-�-��a,·q·;;.j��-��a,·��-�� 1:\\ 1:\\, 1;\\ q�·q��-��-1 \"'��-��·qa_·���·q·::��-��-��a_·q·��·s(J.!·qa_·���·�q�·lll· c.J!(�·�, JUl::.·���-�'¥\\'\\l�-�-��a,·q·q��-����·q·��·i)·a_9�'1lld-J'4'�'�' \"'��·�·�9�·9��·ar�-��·1 �di·§�·�·s�·�q·�·�d-J�·�· �·� .l;,·�a·�·�il��.l;,· %9·q.::·qq·q�·�9a_·q·ar��-����·CJ3:6-l��-��-, iEtTJ�·s�-��·ar·!�·CJa: ...... ....... c-..

Through sealing with these mudras, unchanging bliss will be accomplished. Second, the karma mudra means that, with the support fo r accom­plishing the illustrative wisdom of exaltation, there is union with the con­sort. Through this activity, the dharma mudra constitutes an experience parallel to the exaltation of the space of phenomena; the great mudra is freedom from all concepts as the actual experience of the connate; and from within that the samaya mudra is the appearance of the enlightened body, speech, and mind mai)Q.ala after evenness. If applied to the fo ur joys they are joy, supreme joy, connate joy, and freedom from joy. In the tantras, although freedom fr om joy falls third in order, here since the torment of desire has been exhausted this is recog­nized as the time of freedom fr om joy [i.e., the fo urt h]. One may wonder if this is contradictory to other scriptures where the fo ur joys are referenced. The answer is \"no\" since both viewpoints hold that, when the bodhichitta descends to the tip of the vaj ra jewel, this connate joy constitutes the completion of joy. At that point freedom fro m joy begins and becomes the instantaneous wisdom that transcends the notion of desire, freedom fr om desire, bliss, and freedom from bliss. Therefore, when the previous three become fo ur and also when fo ur are synthesized as three, there is no contradiction. This way of applying [the joys] should be understood in reliance upon Arya Nagarjuna's Ascertaining the Fo ur Seals: Third, the vajrakaya of appearances and emptiness is the karma mudra, the vaj ra enlightened speech of clarity and emptiness is the dharma mudra, the vaj ra enlightened mind of bliss and emptiness is the samaya mudra, and the evenness of their inseparability is the vaj ra wisdom of awareness and emptiness as the great mudra. Hence, there are numerous ways to correlate these fo ur mudras in terms of their significance and context. Furthermore, there are limitless ways to express the term \"mudra; such as mudra with characteristics, without, and so fo rth. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.I0.2.J ExceptionaL Third, the main point being emphasized here is the teaching on how to perform the hand mudr:is that indicate any aspect of the wisdom deity's enlightened body, speech, mind, deeds, and the like.

Concerning these inner distinctions, there are fo ur mudras included here: the samaya mudra as the very nature of the mudra being performed; the karma mudra as that movement, including the release and so fo rth; the dharma mudra of visualizing the seed syllable, reciting man­tra, and so fo rth; and the great mudra of abiding as the deity. Concerning this, the basis of all created mudras is the joining of hands together in two ways: either as palms pressed together or by interlacing the finger tips as vajra palms. Separating the hands, the basis of the per­fo rming mudra is to then tuck the thumbs in and close the remaining fingers to fo rm a vajra fist. From that, there are the root mudras fo r the indiv:dual peaceful and wrathful deities, such as the five families and so fo rth. and the many stages of the branch mudras, such as the invocation, empowerment conferral, offerings, and the like. All of these are beauti­fully and eloquently expressed with the lotus swirl, the locus dance, and so fo rth. Finally, they are released with the sound of the fingers snapping. 2.2.2.2.3.2.2.I0.3 The Characteristics The third is tO know both the characteristics of mudra and the manner of sealing. The first is as fo llows. Based on the scriptures and the percep­tions of individuals, there will be six aspects of analysis. First, there are some who assert that these mudras and mantras belong to the category of karmic body and speech, such as thinking the indication of the body is designated as mudra, an expression of speech is mantra, and that these merely demonstrate the ordinary aspects of body and speech. Second, there are some who think that all of these symbolically indi­cate the enlightened body, speech, and mind of all victorious ones, such as introducing meanings through names, indicated in this case with the hands. Third, there are some who understand these indications to have the potential to accomplish enlightened activities and the attainment of wisdom siddhi based upon the undeceiving law of interdependency. Fourth, others understand by thinking that, although all these mudras and mantras are the appearance of one's actions that are part of body and speech, these appearances also emanate from the strength of the bless­ing of the tathagatas. For example, this is like when Maii.jushri blessed a demon and (the demon] taught the doctrine of the Mahayana.

Fifth. these mantras and mudras that possess the potential to accom­plish siddhi by emanating from the blessings of the tathagatas are similar to the way the moon's reflection appears and seems to exist on a vessel of water yet never departs from being the emanation of the moon. When those with samaya practice this by designating [mantra and mudra] as the actual deity, although it may seem that their practice involves fixation that is not the case. Because having directly connected with the genuine mean­ing, such practice will bring undeceiving results. This is similar to mentally fo cusing upon an image as the object to the extent that eventually that goal is able to be accomplished. In a like manner, from these indications [i.e., mudra and mantra] the actual deity can be accomplished. Sixth, some understand that great, all-pervasive wisdom-the ultimate kiya of all the victors-appears as the blessing symbols of mantra and mudrii through the fo rce of compassion and aspiration. For example. by the power of habit the mind itself can appear as both objects and fo rms. Similarly, in actuality both mantra and mudra and the wisdom deity are not different at all since both mantra and mudra are the nature of the deitv. Concerning these six, the latter are more sublime than the initial and, among them, the sixth position is supreme. Because [the sixth) precisely realizes the nature of mantra and mudra, know this to be the only way to fu lly understand the nature of mantra and mudra. For the second [i.e., the manner of sealing], there are two: the reason and the way to seal. First, according to the outer tantras, mudra is a reflec­tion of the manifestation of the perfectly pure space of phenomena and great wisdom. Mudra's nature is that it becomes limitless indications of the doors to perfect fr eedom, resulting in the potential to accomplish all siddhis and activities. Endowed in these three ways, [mudra) indicates all buddhas as well as a state that no one can destroy or transgress. This is uncommon by virtue of being the seal of a single dharma king; and since there is the potential to accomplish all the deeds of the buddhas when sealed with this, the stream of mind will be liberated fr om bondage, the city of deluded obstructers will be destroyed, and the body will be strengthened so obstructers and the like will be unable to cause any harm.

Furthermore, since mudra represents the fe male principle, it is the hidden kaya of all goddesses. If revealed, joy will be cultivated through the nature of samaya. These are the reasons why there is the sealing. Although all of these reasons also apply according to inner tanrra, the main emphasis is the mudri of spontaneous presence, which is the mudra that manifests only from within great wisdom. The sealing with mudra awakens the inseparable intrinsic nature of all tathiigatas and sentient beings-the great exaltation of bodhichitta abiding within the hearts of all wanderers-and allows them to effortlessly discover this great uncom­mon power. 1his also accomplishes the myriad enlightened deeds of the buddhas according to the needs and purposes of all beings. Second, as fo r the way to seal according to the outer tanrras, it is asserted that-just as it is impossible to transgress the seal of a royal decree-once one's genuine nature is sealed by mudra indicating the deity, there will be immediate accomplishment through the strength of the blessing. Accord­ing to inner tantra it is held that mudra is the nature of the deity and is indivisibly sealed with oneself, like deities dissolving into deities, the nature of phenomena merging with the nature of phenomena, or wisdom merging with wisdom. The nature of oneself becomes the deity and the deity [becomes] oneself, and through this method indwelling exaltation awakens to become fu lly manifest. 2.2.2.2.].2.2.ro.4 Ihe Purpose Fourth, the purpose is that all temporary and ultimate goals will be accom­plished in reliance upon this special method. Since this holds the poten­tial to accomplish the deeds of the buddhas, the qualities are supreme. In short, fr om the perspective of what this represents, the entire phe­nomena of the ground, path, and result are subsumed within mudri. This exceptional mantra method is meant fo r those who have received empowerment within the mal)qala and who uphold sa maya. If that is not the case, this must be kept extremely secret. This [rnudra) is in harmony with the view and meditation and renders conduct and accomplishment exceptional.

Given that [mantra] pos· sesses fo ur accomplishments, it has an unimpeded ability to bring about accomplishment. There are three ways to explain this nature in brief: the syllables as the cause of mantra, the nature possessing fo ur accomplish­ments, and the resultant unimpeded ability. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.II.I.I The Ca use of Mantra: The Sy lla bles For the first, there are two. First, the nature refers to the individual aspects of clarity concerning the modulation of sound as the sixteen syllables of the space of prajii.a, such as ah. With the thirty-four consonant syllables of method, such as ka, these fifi:y syllables together constitute the origin or basis fo r all words. Even combinations of these syllables, such as om and others, never depart from this intrinsic nature; so they are also referred to as syllables. Second, if divisions are made, there are fo ur: the syllables of the chan­nels abiding in the body, the syllables of the deities and the palace, the magical syllables of emanations, and the symbolic syllables of language. For the first. the way that the syllables abide in the channels within the body is just as taught throughout the tantras. In this tantra, it is taught that the three syllables-om, ah, and hung-abide within the three places.96 Second, these are the syllables visualized at certain places in the maQ<;lala when meditating upon the deity. Third, these are the clouds of syllables that radiate from the three sec.:ret places of the sambhogakaya buddha and the many emanations that accomplish the purpose of beings. Fourth are the expressions of the different sounds of mantra.

When completely purified, the resultant wisdom of self-appear­ances as the clouds of syllables is then accomplished. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.II.I.2 The Nature Possessing Four Accomplishments Second to further explain the nature, generally by relying upon combina­tions of syllables, there is the potential to clarify all meanings based upon the conventional labels that comprise the entirety of sarpsara and nirvaDa. In addition, all deeds of the buddhas directly and indirectly exist through syllables. That is why, among all worldly fields of perception, there is noth­ing more astonishing or potent than syllables. Although this holds true from the relative point of view, even while the unceasing interdependency of appearances that clarify [meanings] occurs, ultimately, there is nothing to be expressed since the expression itself lacks true existence. Because these expressions themselves are not established in the slightest, nothing at all is actually being expressed. By observing this evenness of the two truths in terms of a single syllable, through that alone the fo ur gateways to total recaW7 can be attained. Specifically, there are fo ur ways that all mantras taught by the buddhas inherently exist. [Mantras] are inherently the nature of phenomena in that all syllables primordially exist as the nature of the evenness of great emptiness. [Mantras] exist naturally as conditioned phenomena in that the uncommon nature of individual appearances exists without decep­tion. These two [i.e., the nature of phenomena and conditioned phenom­ena] pertain not only to mantra but to everything. Due to this, mantras are capable of giving blessings and granting unimpeded potential through the power of the undeceiving interdependency of anything arising from the nature of phenomena, where nothing whatsoever exists. Mantras exist through blessings, meaning that all buddhas who have achieved mastery over phenomena reveal wisdom manifestations of all the syllables-from one to many-accomplished through the blessings of the buddhas. Mantras exist through the strength of potential, meaning that, like the potential of medicine and wish-fulfilling jewels, mantras have the undeceiving and unimpeded potential to accomplish siddhi. Moreover, since all speech primordially abides as purity and evenness, according to this way of abiding all sound becomes the ma�<;lala of enlightened speech.

Furthermore, all movements are mudra, and fo od and drink are the sacred gal).achakra as well. We ll then, some may wonder, \"Do all mantras created by the Buddha, Brahma, and others have equal value and potential?\" [The answer is] from the perspective of how they appear: they are dissimilar because the man­tras of the buddhas are blessed to fu lfill the aim of those to be tamed, as well as being determined through the authenticity of the scriptures that render them incomparable. There may be the fu rther consideration that, since all sound indicates the gateway to perfect freedom from the per­spective of those to be tamed, the mantras of enlightened speech are also without limitation. Since it is taught that all root syllables are blessed, everything originating from them is also mantra. In addition, since the speech of the Buddha is completely impartial, if everything is said to be enlightened speech then why wouldn't the results of mantra recitation, ordinary speech, and the like be similar? [The answer is that) concerning mantra, when one thinks that this is the mantra, or divine speech, of the deity it is recited with faith. Otherwise, chat is not the case. If the nature of mantra is not recognized and thereby held to as ordinary, the intended fu nction of mantra will not occur. Mantras are nonconceptuallike a wish­fulfilling jewel, and their blessings arc similar to how the reflection of the moon appears on water, if[the blessings] are to enter one's stream of mind. And if the contributing circumstances fo r receiving siddhi such as fa ith and the rest are lacking, it would be like having no water [for the reflec­tion to appear on]. Nevertheless, due to the power of the inconceivable emanations of the buddhas, even just hearing the sound of the awareness mantras of the tathagatas is never without benefit. In the Root Co ncept of Manjushri• it states: However much the mantras of the tathagatas are recited Brings the benefit of all mantras. Even if a mantra practitioner merely glances at another, That person will become a future disciple.

ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT 333 Therefore, according to the conventional way things appear, these are the mantras revealed by the Buddha; and since the root causes and con­tributing circumstances are complete, when combined with devotion blessings occur according tO one's wishes. Similarly, when seeds, water, and earth combine, sprouts will grow; or when a person with a fully puri­fied mind stream encounters a disciple who sees that person as an arya, blessings will abound. 2.2.2.2.).2.2.II.I.3 The Result of Unimpeded Abilit)' Third, the result is that, since mantra is the nature of the deity, there is no goal both temporarily and ultimately that cannot be achieved by accom­plishing it. Hence, due to mantra, even an ordinary individual gains the ability to invoke the power of the tathagatas as a support and engage in various enlightened activities. From a common perspective there is noth­ing in this world that can bestow siddhi quite like mantra. Even Brahm a, Maheshvara, wish-granting trees, wish-fulfilling jewels, and the like arc unable to compare with the potential of mantra. Mantras can be recited by common folk, whereas comprehension of the profound view, meditation practice, and so fo rth are really meant fo r those whose streams of mind are relatively pure, not just fo r anyone. This completes the explanation of the nature of mantra. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.II.2 The Divisions Second, fo r the divisions, there are three: the general. specific, and excep· tiona! divisions. The first concerns the ground, path, and result. The mantra of the ground means that phenomena that primordially abide as great purity and evenness are complete within the exaltation of the mind's nature. This is the intrinsically clear maJ:!{,iala of the mind called \"the nature as it is of mantra.\" The path is that, in order to actualize [the ground], there are the paths of mantra possessing the exceptional practices of method and prajiia that swiftly and easily grant protection to the mind. The result is that­by realizing the wisdom kaya exaltation nature of mind-one becomes a sacred refuge, support, and guide fo r all sentient beings, establishing them all in a state of well-being and happiness."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"334 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT \"l��·�rs·s\"l·�·���·��·�ra.��·q(l,·�aj·�·���·�ar�·�l ��·q·��·q(l,·��·�· Ul!:,'�\"l�·��·s·�1 �O-I·�r;:_·O-J��·�r;:_·.��1 ��·q·iJ�·qa·��·��r;:_·���·�·���· a!·�·��·��·��r::_�·q·�·��� ����r�·iJ�·q�:iil·4�·l1l·Ulr::_·���·��·��r::_�·�1 �'0-J'aj�, \"l��·i)�·iil·4�·a,�·��·�, ���·q�·�9�·��·��r;:_�·q·��,,��·��, ��·�·1f�4·���·���·q·�·�O-I�·�·�·aja_r;:_·���·4�·��·�1 �·��·aj�, �9�·�0-l��r�O-J�·�\\��-1'-l·Ulr;:_·, ���·��r;:_·�a·���·O-J·Q.�\"-1' ���·�9�·��!:,�· q·���·�, l�'¥i·Lilr;:_·��r;:_·�r�9�·�r;:_·��·�9·\"'rij9�·qa:£l��·�·i9·�6J�· ....._ ....._ ....., 'V\" ......,..

Even the meaning of the unelaborate can be called \"mantra;' as it states in the Fu lly Awakened Vairochana:• The meaning of the unelaborate Is the essence of secret mantra. Thus, this is similar. It is also said that nondual wisdom is called \"mantra,\" as the quote continues: This nondual wisdom Is what the Sage spoke of as \"mantra.\" Thus, and whatever indicates this, such as the kayas of the deities, is also called \"mantra.\" The quote continues: In addition, the exceptional tormas are offered co all mantras. Thus, the point being made is similar to rhese quotes. Furthermore, the methods of sadhana including gacyachakra, fire ceremony, and others are all referred co as \"mantra; hence the term itself makes reference to mul­tiple subjects. Third, fo r the exceptional division, the subject is recitation mantra. The distinctions outlined above were merely general distinctions concerning the categories that are referred to by the term \"mantra.\" Generally, as the term itself points out, all mantra vehicles are referred to as such because they efficaciously grant swift protection. Here, the exceptional division for recitation mantras is due to their function as outstanding methods. For such mantras, there are three general explanations: secret mantra, awareness mantra, and retention mantra.b In terms of the meaning they represent, the three correspond to emptiness, awareness, and nondual­ity. Alternatively, these three can be applied in reverse order.

In addition, there are many assertions, such as the distinctions of mantra as they per· tain to sadhanas, taught within the sutras as well as in outer and unsur­passed mantra. From the perspective of cause and fu nction, the nature of mantra is extremely secret as the wisdom of nondual method and prajii.a that serves to remedy misconception. Mantra as the nature of prajii.a and wisdom serves the function to remedy ignorance, and the nature of memory and prajfia arises as the mantra of total recall, serving to remedy the decline of awareness. There are many ways to recognize awareness mantra. For instance, even the awareness mantras of male deities can be considered to belong to the fe male category since their nature abides as the female space of emptiness. Moreover, through the cause of attaining total recall, mantra is blessed to function as a retention mantra. Since the nature of this is wisdom awareness, it is awareness mantra; and since the method is to recite in secrecy, it is secret mantra. Aside from classify­ing [mantras] based on conceptual distinctions, there is no difference in their nature. The point is to know that there are these various correlations that are made. Specifically, regarding the mantras used fo r maQ<;Ialas, there are three: the root mantra is the unmistaken cause of the seed syllable; the mantras of the contributing circumstance of generation are recited when generat· ing the deity, such as those to be recited during empowerment conferral, invocation, offerings, and so fo rth; and [third] the repeated recitation of the essence mantra of the deity is called \"the recitation mantra of activity.\" The latter includes the mantras of the principal deities, the retinue, the synthesized mantras, and the appended mantras for enlightened a<:tivity. In addition to those, just as it is renowned throughout the tanrras and sadhanas, there are the three mantras of approach, accomplishment, and activity as well as many inner divisions, including the root, essence, and the close essence mantras. 2.2.2.2.3.2.2.II.3 The Ma nner of Engaging This has three parts: 1 The cultivation of confidence in mantra through profound prajna 2 Abiding with the visualization of mantra through profound samadhi 3 The fruition of the conduct of mantra through exceptional diligence"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":")(! it/ til � }rr . i-< • � � _, � ir U • ---· · if OJ L!fr�� · Lr i.( }� {� � � � i-< � � � ill( i-< !+() � tr: !1lU t6:\"\" i-t' a m? k'f <!U' • t(} -� � �.� � !'V a ir f:! � Gil tT !'! � !'! ir iif [{ �� '\"' 1..( itt 1€ i-( t6 ([ j.o-!J m .tO G� G� Ll i-( !'7 � fl€ Rl f1 m> � GB' � 1J <.!'f i1f � a G� U n:rv • • fr G•v • .,,...-• t:l U . ;.,... }w:' i=--L1 � t6 . ;-,. 1J u {i . \"\"' }� }LI G-.; • u G8' • ttQ c � if · · tO � -..; lit( u � � � ii{ ii{ � e' � k'( tO � k'( � 17 ir P' GIO • G!\"( f� • k'f i-( !J }!-( !J t:f l{ itt Lr G� flr ;.[ tf fg G� !J 1€ C � I{ i'( � G!'7 !J:7 • - i-< }� � fr !7 � i':{ ir !7 {l' ii{ u � l{ i:!'

Initially, this must be estab­lished through the mode of the six analyses that were explained during [the teaching] on mudra. Among them according co rhe final analysis, one must have confidence in the inseparability of deity and mantra while knowing that, ultimately, phenomena are impartial within the expanse of the great dharmakaya of evenness and purity. Relatively, mantra itself is held as the deity through rhe realization that both rhe actual kaya of the deity and mantra are not difl:erent insofar as both are wisdom emanations that manifest fo r the purpose of disciples. The second has three, beginning with rhe first. Dispelling dualistic concepts concerning the notion that the meaning of deity and mantra involves one being better or worse is as fo llows. Just as it is possible fo r the wisdom of rhe buddhas to arise as anything in the minds of those to be tamed, that is why those tamed by the Buddha will perceive him directly and those whose minds are tamed by an ordinary person will perceive the ordinary. Since in both cases chis occurs through the sole manifestation of the Buddha's wisdom, in truth there is no difference. That being the case, there is no better or worse since the Buddha himself appears in the aspect of mantra even fr om the perspective of ordinary beings. It should be understood that-once mantra is accomplished-if the deity directly appears, it is because mantra practice is manifesting as the actual deity; and it is only through knowing that mantra manifests as the deity that siddhi can be bestowed upon disciples. Second, dispelling the notion of holding to the [deity and mantra] as different since they assume different fo rms is as fo llows. For those who think that mantra is different from the deity because their fe atures are entirely different and that mantra is merely an expression of speech and images of syllables that lack wisdom, the response is [as fo llows].

Likewise, the Buddha's wisdom appears as various pure lands and kayas. [According to the above claim,] both of these could not be subsumed within mind or wisdom. Moreover, that would also mean that, among the inconceiv­able manifestations of the magical matrix of deities, only a single buddha within the pantheon of the peaceful and wrathful would be the fo rm of the deity and the rest would nor. Therefore, it must be understood that, even though aspects are different, [the nature] never departs fr om being the manifestation of wisdom. Third, to consider that there are differences in the meaning based on how all appearances are the product of the mind streams of self and others is as follows. One may think that mantra and mudra are phenom­ena belonging to one's stream of mind and that, since the wisdom deity is otherwise, there is a difference. [In response,] when there is freedom from temporary stain, that fu ndamental nature of phenomena is the non­dual ground of the nature as it is referred to as \"the nondual kaya.\" That nature is the genuine definitive deity of self-originating wisdom. Failing to understand the various manifestations of that wisdom's magical matrix is referred to as \"the deity of another's stream of mind.\" If a deity were to exist at some location and possess the transience of the three doors-since that involves particles and moments in time-that cannot be a wisdom kaya that pervades time and space. The claim is that, except fo r whatever direction the [deity) resides, if seen elsewhere that cannot be the actual deity; then when the kaya's of the Buddha appear simultaneously to all fortunate ones of the ten directions of this world, only one of them would be the actual Buddha and not the others. These are the reasons why one must come to know the nature of the Buddha through training the mind according to the great vehicle. Having given this general explanation, it appears that mantra belongs to one's stream of mind; however, according to the meaning of the even­ness of the fundamental nature of phenomena, even the stream of mind has no independent existence. Moreover, there is no contradiction even based on the way things appear. What appears in one's own mind may appear as though it were otherwise, such as dream appearances, while various perceptions such as the body also appear as a single phenomenon of one's mind. l11ough things appear in myriad ways, this is not how they actually are. No matter what appears-whether according to one's mind or that of another-through the appearances of mantra and mudra alone,"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"341.

That is why these appearances are considered to be the wisdom manifestation of the tathagatas, which is why the way that things appear to the ordinary mind would never be capable of obstructing the inconceivable domain of the buddhas who have mastery over phenomena. Furthermore, even though the Buddha's blessings may appear during dreams, samadhi, and waking reality, ultimately those too amount to self­appearances that could never be established as otherwise. Once some­thing appears to oneself, it is self-appearing. As taught extensively in the scriptures, this can be established by reasoning based on the power of the fact. Hence, to the degree that one's mental stains have been purified, the blessings and miracles of the buddhas become increasingly obvious. Fin ally, when all stains are completely purified and the fundamental nature is fully manifest, even all budd has will be oneself and oneself will be all buddhas. Then the wisdom kaya of the nature of phenomena will have been realized as indivisibility with all buddhas of the three times. Ar that point, one will know that all budd has manifest to oneself in the aspect of mantra in order to accomplish temporary and ultimate aims. This extremely impor­tant point allows one to cultivate extraordinary confidence in mantra and constitutes the root cause fo r mantra accomplishment. Similarly, it states in the Accomplishment ofSolitary Manjushri: The wisdom deity manifests as secret mantra, Through which all siddhis are granted. When a mantra practitioner meditates upon this, If accomplished, siddhi will be achieved.

Thus, this is similar. 2.2.2.2.J.2.2.II.J.2 Abiding with the Visualization of Mantra through Profound Samddhi Second, fo r samadhi, there are two: vivid samadhi during actual practice and maintaining the view as the support. The first is to have extreme clar­ity concerning all the ways the kayas, seed syllables, and encircling mantric syllables radiate and reabsorb during samadhi. The pride of being indivis­ible with the deity should also be cultivated without thinking this occurs only within one's mind. In addition, the wisdom deity should not be held as autonomous, possessing characteristics such as a true fo rm and name. One must have pure recollection toward the manifestations of deity and mantra since this represents ultimate resultant wisdom, the perfection of the abandonments, and realization.b Second, given that all of this never departs from the state of the sole viral essence of the dharmakaya, the primordial inseparable truth of purity and evenness, one must know this and abide single-pointedly without inter­ruption fr om fu rther concepts.

By internally binding all movement of wind and effort-based recollections, through mental recita­tion the exceptional quality of implicitly arresting all efforts of body and speech will be achieved. TI1e second is to join mantra with the inhala­tion, retention, and exhalation of the wind-these three-and to visual­ize without distraction. The third is mental recitation combined with the fo ur attributes of the vase [breath]. Second, \"whispered recitation\" means that-even though there is no melody-recitation is whispered by moving the lips and throat with mini­mal effort. Third, fo r melodious recitation, there are six. First, the melody of the sound of rhe mantric syllables possesses ten qualities: not overly loud or low, the voice not overly fast or slow-these fo ur-and not reciting while speaking to someone or while distracted, reciting without omitting manrric syllables, without adding, with accurate pronunciation by not allowing even the sound of subtle vowel endings such as the circle98 and so fo rth to be dropped, and with impeccably clear pronunciation without distorting rhc source of each individual syllable. Second, rhe melody that comes from the breath in the throat is that, by touching the tongue to the palate, breathing resembles the buzzing of bees, which is slow and drawn out through the nostrils. Recitation is gentle, elongated, and harmonious with the natural flow and hum of one's breath. Third, the melody led by the song of Brahma is pleasing, high pitched, elongated, and sustained. Like the song of Brahma with the teeth touching, the recitation has trills and modulations that incite a fe eling that captivates the minds of others. Fourth, the melody of the sound of groaning and moaning is that, by clos­ing the lips and placing the tongue against the palate, one recites in the"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"� . � . � � j_( � �-� � !J c:'-� itt � i?; �G�l> � � 1!7 ,tf-� if }!J _ ,{T � �r 'fT }!1f � g � = ,(:! i:1 r5· t() � 1.!;:!1 lf tO flf iif lf r � !u E77?

Fifth, the melody that thunders like the roar of a dragon is thunderously wrathful, and the syllables are slightly fa ster, resembling a dragon's roar. Recitation is with a fo rceful expression, like water cascading off a cliff. Sixth, the melody of the wail of the vajra cal1-nibal is that, with the mouth dosed like a bee trapped in a jar, the syllables are unclear and the melody extremely loud. Recitation is in the manner of grunting like incensed cannibals. These are referred to as the six melodies and, in the order just presented, are called the changka de'u,pangga de'u, treng(breng) nge ba, dung nge ba, shar ta pa, and ga r ta pa. These melodies are to be applied to the appro­priate context. Alternatively, it is taught that the sound of the grunting cannibal is shar ta pa, the sound of the dragon is ga r ra pa, the sound of breath in the throat is chang ka de'u, grieving and moaning is pang ga de'u, che sound chat accompanies mantra is treng nge ba, and Brahma's song is dung nge ba.

Moreover, if nonconducive circumstances-such as illness, demonic fo rces, and excess conceptualiza­tion-take place, recall that this is the exhaustion of negative karma and avoid becoming discouraged. It is taught that everything that inhibits the accomplishment of mantra must be kept at a distance, such as befriending samaya breakers and the like. Meat, liquor, and other substances that are fo rbidden on other occa­sions become beneficial substances during Secret Mantra because they are to be blessed through mantra, visualization, and mudrii.

As the dharma mudra, it supremely pleases all deities. When the blessings of the budd has enter one's mind: like fire to tinder, the dense fo rest of obstructions are incinerated and all qualities of the path, such as the wisdom of mantric formulas, samidhi, and so fo rth, are swiftly and easily generated. Since the temporary and ultimate purpose of self and others comprised within the common and supreme siddhis will be attained without exception, even a wish-fulfilling jewel cannot compare with this. Mantra possesses the unsurpassed purpose as the manifestation of the Buddha [and] the enlightened deeds of the Buddha, and affords the opportunity to attain the state of the Buddha. In short, that which is called \"mantra\" is the root cause and nature of the maQ�ala and deities, that which confers empowerment and defines samaya, and through the mode of the syllables and others [mantra is] the specific gateway that indicates the view. It is also the sacred method for generating the profound view and meditation in the stream of mind; the occasion of exceptional meditation and conduct; and the supreme method for accomplishment, offerings, and enlightened activities, as well as being sealed with mudra. In this way [mantra] engages all topics of training so, during these occasions, mantra functions as the sole essence. Since the nature of mantra is the wisdom deity and the view, all other top· ics become auxiliary branches to understanding this meaning. Ultimately, mantras are the state of evenness, free fro m an object being expressed and an expression. Therefore, when phenomena are separate from expression and complete within the expanse of the sole vital essence of dharmakaya, it is then that mantra is perfected.

Whoever accurately realizes and unerringly imparts this to another will be undifferentiated from me, Kuntuzangpo, [and] empowerment will be naturally complete. Be sure to uphold this teaching, never allowing it to diminish!\" Thus, the genuine, implicit entrustment was given. The two ways to uphold the doctrine are through practicing the doc­trine of realization and teaching the doctrine of scriptural transmission. Having realized the meaning of the tantra, fo r one to then communicate that meaning through instruction is how to uphold the cancra. Therefore, it is ultimately entrusted to someone who is capable of that. Having inter­nalized the profound meaning of the nature of phenomena, [chat person] becomes indivisible with the wisdom intent of the teacher of the cancra. Empowerment is also complete, because the meaning of empowerment is to generate this profound wisdom.

It is even possible that those whose mental capacities are inferior might allow the precious tanrra to go ro waste. In the KingofTa ntra Called \"The Great Black One'\"' it states: Senseless teachers who fail to know the supremely profound Will not even recall the words \"indivisible wisdom.\" Thus, similarly, when the meaning of great purity and evenness is being imparted, it is crucial to never depart from the tradition of the upadesha lineage of vidyadharas. One should not teach by mimicking the style of chose who are immature, narrow-minded intellectuals who only speak by using words that temporarily satisfy their own needs and assertions. If the profound meaning of cancra is explained incorrectly, the repercussions are extremely great. In rhe tanrra Compendium of Awarenessb it states: Without the eyes of dharma, No matter how many designations are expressed Through limitless words, It will not be known whether the meaning is mistaken or nor. Those whose minds are untamed and who just fo llow words Have not begun to enter the grounds and paths oflearning. Although capable of expressing hundreds and thousands of words, They must never teach this to others. If so, such thieves of the sacred vajra words Will fall to vajra hell. If a hypocrite who is not at all learned Pretends to teach the meaning of this dharma While remaining in the dark himself [and] Being driven by the syllables and words, The negative karma accrued will be weightier than Taking the lives of all living beings.

This meaning emerges from the expanse of'Kuntuzangpo's enlightened mind as the genuine space of the nature just as it is, where misinterpretation and denigrations are fully pacified. Those who know this are individuals who have realized the meaning of the cancra. For example-just as waves emerge from the ocean-from the basic space of the indivisible wisdom intent of all victorious ones of the three times, the strength of wisdom's self-appearances emerges; so through that, the person who unerringly realizes his own nature is not other than that nature.

Just as the principal heir of a chakravartin ruler will become his regent, the ones who become the sacred heirs of the sugatas are said to be born from the enlightened mind of the buddhas because they are born from the buddhas' secret enlightened mind. Hence, it was predicted, \"Those who teach the tantra to others are noble ones of awareness who abide on that which is referred to as 'the ground of a vidyadhara; the supreme ground among all, or 'the ground of a vajra holder of supreme method and prajna.' They will abide on the thirteenth ground ofbuddha, the ultimate ground.\" For example, like a poor man trying to uncover a treasure below his house, so long as the acrual treasure is nor in his posses­sion he is referred to as poor, but once he rakes possession of the treasure he becomes rich. Th is is also like a hooked fish still in the water that is as good as landed. In summary, whether it is the time of the lower vehicles or the most supreme ground of che ultimate mantra vehicle, such distinctions are based upon the realization that the natural dear-light mal)4ala of rhe mind is self-occurring wisdom-mantra's nature just as it is. It is predicted that, if there is realization, one will become a vidyadhara, also referred to as \"a holder of the vajra and mantra.\" Even just through unwavering confidence in mantra's nature just as it is, the state of no rerum will be achieved. Since it is taught that by just seeing the illustrative symbolic maQc)ala irrevers­ible buddhahood can occur, needless to mention what will happen when che object being symbolized is actually realized to be the genuine ma!f4ala of mantra's nature just as it is-inseparable purity and evenness. It is caught chat, here, rhe reference to \"realization\" actually means beginners who are gaining certainty [in the view] and who have severed the cord of doubt through prajna. Therefore, even fo r a beginner who cor­reedy enters the path of mantra no matter how immature they are, their fo rtune to awaken is equal to char of a nonreturning bodhisattva. Since chis path is even swifter, it grams fortune equal to those who are in their final rebirth in existence. One may wonder what is meant by reference to \"correctly entering.\" [The answer is] having received empowerment, con­fidence is chen gained in the wisdom of the genuine empowerment, the great purity and evenness of phenomenal existence.

Thus, and in the later Guhyasamdja Ta ntra it states: Whoever just sees or touches a practitioner engaged with the essence, Clearly recalls or merely hears their name, or Becomes devoted and attracted to them Will be treated as one who has awakened vajra nature And, to them, constant homage will be paid! Thus, this is similar. Furthermore, to merely cultivate interest toward the approach of Secret Mantra, the benefits are immeasurable as it states in Gathering of the Wi sdom Intent: Though lacking the capacity to know the essential meaning, Just giving rise to the aspiration Will outshine the Middle Wa y. The quote continues: For those who delight and cultivate interest In the secret of all the victorious ones, External obstacles will not occur And whatever is wished fo r will be swiftly granted.

Having severed the cord of doubt through hearing and contempla­tion concerning the unsurpassed path of mantra, I have composed this brief exposition that serves as a crucial overview to approach the great King of Ta ntras. This has been based on the wisdom intent of the lin­eage of vidyadharas in general and specifically explained according to the omniscient King of Dharma, Longchenpa, and the glorious mahapaQI;iita, Rongzompa. Nevertheless, gaining a direct experience of these profound key points within one's mind depends entirely upon receiving the lineage blessings from a fully qualified guru who is experienced with the oral instructions of the lineage of vidyadharas. It also depends upon bringing the mind to maturity through empow­erment, receiving the blessings of the genuine lineage, and listening to the profound liberating upadesha instructions. The meaning revealed in these precious tantric classes of the Nyingmapa tantras is sustained through these profound key points of mantra that are transmitted by the aural lineages of the vidyadharas. In other traditions [these key points] are not fu lly expressed. Chandrakirri said: Except fo r this, a similar doctrine is not tO be fo und elsewhere; just as there is nothing other than this, the learned must deter­mine that no other traditions have what is fo und here. Thus, this is similar. Therefore, keeping in mind the rarity of encountering this [Secret Essence], once doing so these teachings must be cherished and upheld. It is unacceptable to openly expose this to those with immature minds who lack fa ith, because it is taught that the profound meaning of this tanrra is carefully guarded by all wisdom <;lakin is as though it were their own hearts' blood. Hence, this must be kept secret from unsuitable recipients.

Therefore, it feels that the fo rm of the blessings of the lineage of vidyadharas is instantly reflected in my mind like the moon and stars. Through his immense kindness my guru, the Original Protector, has repeatedly given his permission by means of enlightened speech; and by the strength of the entrustment of his loving wisdom mind, I was able to gain the confidence to compose chis. Any faults accrued based on my own inability, as well as openly exposing such a profound secret subject, are confessed before the deities of the 1hree Roots.

The cognitions of the six collections are visual consciousness, miggi nam she (mig gi rnam shes, chak�urvijndna); auditory consciousness, na wa'i nam she (rna ba'i rnam shes, shrotravijndna); olfactory consciousness, na'i nam she (sna'i rnam shes,ghrd'Javijndna); gustatory consciousness, che'i nam she (lce'i rnam shes,jihvdvijitdna); tactile consciousness,/u ky i nam she (Ius ky i rnam shes, kayavijnana); and mental consciousness,yid ky i nam she (yid ky i rnam shes, manovijfui.na). 2. 3 Nang sum po wa 'i bak chak (snang gsum 'pho ba'i bag chags) means the three visions at the moment of death: the appearance of the red, the arising of the white light, and the close attainment of darkness, which is when uncon­sciousness occurs. 2.4 The bold letters in the quote are the words from Dharmakirti's commentary embedded in Mipham Rinpoche's commentary. 2.S The five paths are the paths of accumulation, unification, seeing, meditation, and no further learning. 2.6 The seven are stream enterers,gyun zhuk pa (rgyun zhugs pa); stream enterers abiding in the result,gyun zhuk drey ney (rg yun zhugs 'bras gnas); returning stream enterers, chir ong zhuk pa (p hy ir ong zhugs pa ); returning and abiding in the result, chir ong drey ney (phyir ong 'bras gnas); nonreturning enterers, chir mi ong zhuk pa (phyir mi ong zhugs pa); nonreturning and abiding in the result, chir mi ong drey ney (phyir mi ong 'bras gnas); and entering as a foe destroyer, dra chom zhuk pa (dgra bcom zhugs pa). 2 7 \"Abiding like a rhinoceros\" means to abide alone as a solitary practitioner as opposed to abiding in a group with other practitioners. 28 The ten pii.ramitii.s are generosity, morality, patience, perseverance, concen­tration, prajnii., method, strength, aspiration, and wisdom."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"386 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT 29 \"Twofold selflessness\" is the selflessness of the person and the selflessness of phenomena. 3 o The three families are the family of enlightened body-Vairochana, enlight­ened speech-Amitabha, and enlightened mind-Ak�hobhya. 3 1 Reference to the \"four families\" includes the three mentioned above, with the fourth being the enlightened quality fa mily ofRatna�ambhava. F The fifi:h family refers to the family of enlightened activity-Amogha­siddhi. 3 3 The five wisdoms are the space of phenomena, mirrorlike, evenness, discern­ing awareness, and all-accomplishing activity. 34 The sixth family refers to the Lord of All Families, who is the sambhogakaya buddha, Vajradhara. 3 S The seven arc synthesized into three as follows: the first five of enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities are one; the wisdom of genuine truth is the second; and the basic space, or emptiness of genuine truth, is the third. 36 The four vidyadharas are mature awareness holder, namin rigdzin (rnam Jmin rig 'dzin); immortal awareness holder, tsewang rigdzin (tshe dbang rig 'dzin); great mudra awareness holder, chag gya chenpo rigdzin (phyag rtJ 'd chen po rig 'dzin); and spontaneously present awareness holder, lhiin drup rigdzin (!hun grub rig 'dzin ). 3 7 The three samadhis are samadhi of the nature as it is, de zhin ny id ky i ting ngen dzin (de bzhin ny id k)'i ting nge 'dzin ); all-illuminating samadhi, kun tu nang wa'i ting ngen dzin (kun tu snang ba'i ting nge 'dzin); and samadhi of the principal cause,gy u'i ting ngen dzin (rgyu'i ting nge 'dzin). 3 8 Yi ge khodo tsok chen gyi sa (yi ge 'khor lo tshogs chen gyi sa) is the thirteenth ground, or bhl\"uni, called the \"Great Assembly of the Wheel of Syllables.\" From the perspective of the three kayas, there are three names for the elev­enth, twelfth, and thirteenth grounds; however, the nature of all three is the same. The eleventh is called \"All-Pervasive Light,\" kun tu od (kun tu 'od) and the twelfth, \"The Lotus,\" pem,t chen (pad ma can). 39 The four modes of placement are placement of the view like a mountain, tawa riwo chogzhag (Ita ba ri bo cog bzhag) ; placement of meditation like the ocean,gompa gyatsc chog zhag ( bsgom pa rg ya mtsho cog bzhag); placement of all appearances as conduce, chad p,z ntmg wa chog zhag (spyod pa snang ba cog bzhag); and placement of the uncontrivcd result, drey burna cho chog zhag ('bras bu ma bcos cog bzhag). 40 The fo ur luminosities arc the luminosity of the far-sighted water lasso,gyang zhag chu'i dron ma (rgyangs zhag chu'i sg ron ma); the luminosity of the empty bindu, tigle tong pa'i dron ma (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma ); the luminosity of perfectly pure space, ying nam dag gi dron ma (dbyings rnam dag gi sg ron"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"ma ); and the luminosity of self-occurring prajfla, sherab rang chung gi dron ma (shes ra b rang by unggi sgron ma). 41 The four visions are the direct realization of the dharmata, cho ny id ngon sum (chos nyzd mngon sum); the increasing eJ<pcrience, nyam gong pel (nyams gong 'phef); the full extent of awareness, rigpa tsed peb (rig pa tshad phebs); and the ground of the exhaustion of the dharmata, chii nyid zed sa (chos ny id zad sa). 42 The term �Vedic\" is used in this context because the disciplines and conduct of these three yogas resemble the Hindu-Vedic schools of practice from the outer point of view. 4 3 The two obstructions are passion-based, ny on drib (nyon sgrib) and cogni­tive-based, shey drib (shes sgrib ). 44 The phrase \"eyes and legs\" refers to the need for uniting the relative with the genuine or appearances with awareness of emptiness. 45 Purity, completion, and maturity are the three stages of the generation-stage process of the path. 46 This reference to \"Akani�h�ha\" is not the pure land of Rich Array.

For males, rasana is on the right and Ialani is on the left, whereas this is reversed for females. The white essential fluid runs through rasana, and the red t1uid runs through lalana. For males, the red lalana is knotted, which is why the red fluid does not flow from them. For fe males, it is the opposite: the white rasana is knotted, thus preventing the white fluid from flowing. 67 An epithet for Longchenpa. 68 The four branches are the approach, ny enpa (bsnyen pa); the close approach, nye ny en (nye bsnyen); the accomplishment, drup pa (sgrub pa); and the great accomplishment, drup chen (sgrub chen). 69 This reference is made in the fo rm of a personal note embedded in the com­mentary, which was probably written by the author. 70 The reference to Rongzompa is also a note embedded in the commentary."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"390 ESSENCE OF CLEAR LIGHT 71 The term kiin dro (kun gro) in Tibetan, translated here as \"omnipresent,\" refers to the level oi the mental activity during the first two grounds of after­evenness on the path of seeing. 71 The \"power offact'' simply means the natural way that things present them-selves, so it is facrual. 73 This is the sole nature fo r both surra and mantra. 74 The terms in bold are the root verses from the Kt ilachakra Tantm. 75 According to Thin.ey Norbu Rinpoche, Rongzom PaQ<;iita refers to this as den marva (bden smra ba), meaning a \"materialise:' and that this usage is not familiar to later scholars. 76 \"Solitary body\" refers to practicing alone without a consort. 77 Dag sa siim (dag s.� gsum) refers to the three final bodhisattva grounds that arc, namely, the cigi1th ground, called \"Immovable;' sa gyed pa mi gyowa (sa brgy,ad pa mi gyo ba); the ninth ground, called \"Excellent Intelligence,\" gu pa lek pa'i lo dro (dgu p,I Iegs pa'i blo gros ); and the tenth ground, called \"Clouds of Dharma;' chu pa cho ky i tr·in (bcu pa chos ky i sprin ). 78 1l1 is is a famous analogy taken from the sfmas, where the two ways of seeing arc compared. l11e \"four aryas\" refers to the shravakas, pratyekas, bodhi­sattvas, and buddhas. 79 Dzambu chri ser (tizam bu cbugser) is a reference to the purest gold to be fo und on this continent. According to the ancient Vedic tradition, there is another reference to this substance as the fe ces of an elephant that has fallen into rhe ocean and remained there to petrify for thousands of years. 8o In the edition of this commentary published by the Szechuan Province National Publishing House, it mentions that this quote comes from rhe Sutra Requested by Kashyapa, od sung ky i zhii p,1'i do ( 'od srungs kyis zhus pa'i mdo, kashyapaparivartasritra ). 81 The italicized words in this section set our rhe four realizations previously itemized. 81 TI1e five meats, sha nga (sha lnga ; pafichamaJrtsa), arc those of human flesh, elephant, horse, dog, and ox; and the five ambrosias, or nectars, dudtsi nga (bdud rtsi lnga; ptl1khdmrta), are semen/white bodhichitta, blood/red bodhichitta, urine, excrement, and marrow. 8 3 \"Kunda\" is rhc nectar of the bodhichitta, which is the essential fluid. 84 TI1e three fu lfillments arc: by liberating the object and offering the aggre­gates to the wisdom deities, rhe wisdom deities are fulfilled; by sending the consciousness ro rhe pure lands, the object is fulfilled; and by performing the practice, the practitioner accumulates the fulfillment of great merit.

The upper part of his body is that of a human, and the lower is a serpent. He is white in color, holding a jewel to his hip in the lefi hand and covering his ear with the right hand. Whenever any image needs to be constructed in order to facilitate a Secret Mantra practice, the geomancy and astrological connec­tions must be identified. The Earth Belly Lord turns his face according to these alignments, so the direction that he faces must be determined prior to digging in the ground. A qualified vajra master will be well aware of this and will know how to determine the correct approach. If the ritual is carried out according to these requirements, then the attainment of siddhi will not be obstructed. 88 'This quote fr om the tantra is a metaphor indicating the samaya to never harm the body or upset the mind of rhe vajra master. 89 This means to abandon the guru from one's heart. 90 \"Kind in all three ways\" refers to a guru from whom one has received the threefold kindness of empowerment, scriptural transmission, and upadesha instructions. 91 In the fourth line of this quote, the root tantra uses the word \"cu\" rather than \"bcud.\" The Omniscient One, Longchenpa, has interpreted this to be \"bcud,\" which means \"inhabitants.\" Our translation is based on his interpre­tation and explanation that is found in his commentary entitled Thorough Dispelling of Darkness throughout the Ten Directions. 91.
