Zab lam na ro'i chos drug gi 'khrid yig yidches gsurn ldan) (hereafter referred to as A Book of Three Inspirations). LamaJey Tsongkhapa was the founder of the eclectic Geluk school and the root guru ofthe First Dalai Lama (1391-1475). The introduction to that work gives a lengthysummary of the history and contents of the tradition of the Six Yogas of Naropa,which is not repeated here.The work of preparing Tsongkhapa's Six Yogas of Naropa led me to read over adozen classical Indian and Tibetan treatments of the Six Yogas. Six of thosetexts are included here: a brief verse work by the Indian mahasiddha Tilopa(988-1069), who is regarded as the original formulator of the system of the SixYogas; a slightly longer verse work by Tilopa's chief disciple, known to historyas Pandita Naropa (10161100), after whom the system is named; a commentary foundin Lama Jey Tsongkhapa's Collected Works (Tib. gSung 'bum), entitled A PracticeManual on the Six Yogas of Naropa: Taking the Practice in Hand (Tib. Na ro'ichos drug gi dmigs skor lag to len tshul, hereafter referred to as A PracticeManual on the Six Yogas), which is much shorter in length than his formaltreatise and focuses exclusively on the yogic techniques and meditations of thetradition; Gyalwa Wensapa's (1505-1566) presentation of \"the three blendings,\"an important aspect of and also an alternative name for the Six Yogas; the FirstPanchen Lama's (15681662) treatment of the yogas, which emphasizes the first andfourth of the six yogas, i.e., the yogas of inner heat and of consciousnesstransference; and, lastly, a small text found in the collected works of thenineteenth-century lama Jey Sherab Gyatso (1803-1875), which was compiled by oneof his disciples from a public discourse given by Jey Sherab Gyatso in 1836 onTsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations.The above list of the six texts is in the order of their historical appearanceas literary compositions. In this volume, however, I have placed the works byJey Sherab Gyatso and Gyalwa Wensapa respectively as Chapters Three and Four,thus arranging them before the works by Tsongkhapa and the First Panchen Lama,who lived earlier in history than they. My logic in arranging them in this wayis that the texts by Tilopa and Naropa in Chapters One and Two, although brief,show the roots of the tradition. Jey Sherab Gyatso's Notes in Chapter Threeworks well as an introduction to the overall approach taken to the Six Yogas,and describes how the general Buddhist trainings are used to prepare the mind ofthe practitioner for tantric endeavor. Gyalwa Wensapa's treatise in Chapter Fourpresents the underlying dynamic on which the Six Yogas tradition is based,namely \"the three blendings.\" Lama Tsongkhapa's A Practice Manual on the SixYogas in Chapter Five presents the nuts and bolts of the actual yogicdisciplines. Finally, the First Panchen Lama's text in Chapter Six provides anexcellent summary of the tradition, with emphasis on the inner heat andconsciousness transference yogas.These six translations were prepared with the guidance and assistance of variouslama friends. When studying Tsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations with Ven.Doboom Tulku, one of my root gurus, we also looked at parts of Tsongkhapa's APractice Manual on the Six Yogas. A few months later I carefully read throughthis latter text with Ven. Ngawang Pendey, a wonderful Dharma friend fromDrepung Loseling. With Ngawang Pendey I also read through several shortcommentaries on Tsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations, including that by JeySherab Gyatso which forms the substance of Chapter Three, and also GyalwaWensapa's Handprints of the Path of the Six Yogas of Naropa: A Source of EveryRealization, herein placed as Chapter Four. Later I rechecked several sectionsof these works with Geshey Lobzang Tenzin, also of Drepung Loseling. The textsby Tilopa and Naropa, and also the treatise by the First Panchen Lama, wereprepared a year later while I was on a teaching tour in Italy. There the mostlearned and accomplished master Geshey Jampa Gyatso of Sera Jey Monastery, alord of the Six Yogas tradition who for the past almost twenty years has beenthe resident teacher at Istituto Lama Tzong Khapa near Pisa, kindly made time inhis busy schedule to nurse my understanding through these intensely terse anddifficult works, and also took time to re-read difficult passages of the othertexts in this volume. His wisdom, learning, humor and profound realizationbrought out their essence like butter churned from milk.A number of Western friends also helped me in getting the manuscript into itsfinal form. Jimmy Apple at the University of Wisconsin checked dates andhistorical references. Pierre Robillard and Michael Wurmbrand did someindispensable leg work on obscure points in the texts. Lulu Hamlin, HilaryShearman, Debby Spencer and Renee Turolla offered useful suggestions. Finally,as always, my seven children fired my imagination and provided much inspiration.It is my hope that these six translations will give tantric enthusiasts a senseof the esoteric and profound nature of the tradition known in Tibetan as theNaro Choe Druk, as well as of its historical continuity."},{"pageContent":"TECHNICAL NOTEThe authors whose works are translated in this volume frequently quote Indianand Tibetan texts. Throughout the volume these titles are simplified for thebenefit of the general reader but are listed in a more formal manner at the backof the volume. The first section of the list of texts quoted gives Indian textsand includes both the original sutras and tantras taught by the Buddha and thetreatises by later Indian masters. The second section contains indigenousTibetan works.The original tantras taught by the Buddha are usually named after a particularmandala deity, and generally in the text I have put these in an abbreviatedAnglicized Sanskrit. An example is The Hevajra Tantra. The titles of texts bylater Indian masters generally are more translatable into English, and thereforeI have taken the liberty of doing so with them. An example is The Five Stages bythe Indian master Nagarjuna. The titles of indigenous Tibetan works also seem totranslate well into English; an example is Tsongkhapa's A Lamp on the FiveStages.Throughout the text Tibetan personal and place names appear as they arepronounced and not as they are formally spelled, due to the number of silentletters used in Tibetan syllables, for example, \"Khedrub Norzang Gyatso\" ratherthan \"mKhas sgrub nor bzang rgya mtsho.\" Those wishing to check the formalspellings can refer to the glossary at the back of the volume.I have not provided a glossary of technical terms. The few words that I feel thereader will benefit from knowing in Sanskrit or Tibetan are given in parentheseswhere they appear in the text. Tantric Buddhism speaks in a straightforwardlanguage, and very little of it is beyond the range of the English language. Theaim of tantric literature is to inspire and guide spiritual seekers in theuniversal doctrine of enlightenment. The more Western readers can integrate itinto their own linguistic environment, the greater will be their ability todemystify it and thus to integrate its inner essence into their own lives."},{"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTIONTHE NARO CHOE DRUKThe tradition known in Tibet as the Naro Choe Druk (Tib. Na ro'i clios drug)translates literally as \"Naro's Six Doctrines,\" but has become better known toWestern students of Tibetan Buddhism as \"the Six Yogas of Naropa.\" Earlyscholars such as Dr. Evans-Wentz, Prof. Herbert Guenther, and Garma C.C. Changused this rendition in their translations and consequently established it asstandard in the Western Buddhist world. Therefore I have followed their lead inusing the term \"Six Yogas,\" rather than \"Six Doctrines,\" both in my earlier workand in the present compendium.Over the centuries the manner in which the Six Yogas have been taught has variedwith the different lines of transmission. Lama Jey Tsongkhapa discusses this insome depth in his longer commentary. There are also traditions of speaking oftwo, three, four, six, eight, and ten yogas of Naropa. However, these variationsare merely different ways of dividing up the pie of the Naropa yogas; there areno substantial differences in what is taught.To accommodate these differing modes of structuring the Naropa system, in bothhis longer and shorter treatises Lama Jey Tsongkhapa uses a somewhat complexsystem of outlines and headings. He does not simply present the six yogas in sixchapters, but instead weaves a subtle line of thought that flows through hisentire presentation. This makes his two treatises somewhat more difficult tofollow than many of the simpler manuals on the system, but accommodates veryaccurately the flexible nature of the tradition and reflects the arbitrarinessof calling it the \"Six Yogas.\"Later Gelukpa commentaries generally follow Tsongkhapa's lead in this respect.They rarely treat the Six Yogas in six chapters.THE BACKGROUND AND NATURE OF THE PRACTICEThe Geluk school, which was formed in the early fifteenth century as a fusion oflineages from a dozen earlier sects, received its transmission of the Six Yogasprimarily from the Zhalu (Sakya) school. The Zhalu had received it from theDrikung Kargyu (one of the Eight Younger Kargyu schools), which in turn is aderivative of the Pakmo Drupa Kargyu (one of the Four Older Kargyu schools). TheGeluk lineage presents the Six Yogas in accordance with the way they weretransmitted by Lama Pal Pakmo Drupa, the founder of the Pakmo Drupa school, toLama Drikung Jigten Sumgon, the founder of the Drikung Kargyu school.According to Lama Pal Pakmo Drupa's lineage the six yogas are listed as follows:inner heat yoga; illusory body yoga; clear light yoga; the yoga for thetransference of consciousness to a higher realm; the yoga for transference ofconsciousness into another body; and the bardo yoga.In this arrangement of the six, the inner heat is the foundation of all theyogas; the illusory body and clear light yogas are grouped together as theactual or principal practices for inducing the experience of enlightenment; andthe yogas of consciousness transference to a higher realm and transference intoanother body are auxiliary or branch applications. This accounts for five of thesix; the sixth, or bardo yoga, is regarded as both a branch of the illusory bodyyoga and as a third auxiliary practice.In other words, the first three yogas-inner heat, illusory body and clearlight-are the real methods for accomplishing enlightenment in one lifetime. Thelast three yogas-consciousness transference to a higher realm, transference intoanother body, and the bardo yogaare only required if one fails to accomplishenlightenment before death draws near, and a forceful last-minute method ofself-protection is required. The First Panchen Lama puts it as follows in hisThe Golden Key: A Profound Guide to the Six Yogas of Naropa:The idea is that if one is not able to accomplish all the practices leading toenlightenment before death comes to destroy one's body-vessel, then in order tofulfill the purposes of oneself and others one engages the yogas of eitherconsciousness transference or projection into another body. Alternatively, ifone is unable to effect this transference, or if one wishes instead to attemptto accomplish final enlightenment in the bardo, then there is the doctrine ofthe bardo yogas.In both his longer and shorter treatises on the Six Yogas system (A Book ofThree Inspirations and A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas) Lama Jey Tsongkhapadedicates special attention to the first of the six, or inner heat yoga, becausesuccess in the remaining five depends on the level of proficiency attained inthe inner heat practice. As he explains in A Book of Three Inspirations,In general, all systems of highest yoga tantra's completion stage involve thepreliminary process of controlling the vital energies flowing through the twoside channels, rasana and lalana, and redirecting them into the central channel,avadlnuti. This is indispensable.There are numerous means for accomplishing this, based on the traditions of theIndian mahasiddhas, who drew from the various tantric systems. In this tradition[i.e., the Six Yogas of Naropa] the main technique is to arouse the inner heatat the navel chakra, the \"wheel of emanation,\" and then through controlling thelife energies by means of the AH-stroke mantric syllable, to draw the subtlelife-sustaining energies into the central channel. When these energies enter thecentral channel the four blisses are induced, and one cultivates meditation onthe basis of these in such a way as to give rise to the innate wisdom ofmahamudra....In this tradition the expression \"the inner heat, the foundation stone,\" is wellknown. This is because in the completion stage yogas one uses the inner heattechnology from the very beginning in order to collect the subtlelife-sustaining energies into the central channel and thereby arouse the innategreat bliss. This is the actual basis upon which all practices rely and uponwhich all later completion stage yogas are founded. The inner heat doctrineestablishes this basis.The practice of the inner heat doctrine entails directing the lifesustainingenergies into the central channel. Here the energies enter, abide, and aredissolved. When one trains well in this technique, the strength of theexperience has the power to give control over loss of the bodhimind substance[i.e., the sexual drops]. Then, based on this power, one can rely upon akarmamudra as a conducive condition to arouse the four blisses. On thisfoundation, innate bliss is aroused. Arousing this innate bliss is the purposeof the practices of the inner heat yoga and karmamudra.One unites the innate bliss with [meditation upon] emptiness, and during thewaking state applies oneself to the illusory body doctrine. Based on theexperience of the illusory body practice one can engage in the clear lighttechniques.Then when asleep at night one can cultivate awareness of the illusory nature ofdreams. To do so effectively one must first master the yoga of retaining theclear light of sleep [i.e., the clear light that arises at the moment of fallingasleep], and then enter into the dream state from that perspective. If the powerto retain the clear light of sleep is accomplished by means of gaining controlover the vital energies, this means that during the time of waking practice onemust have mastered this control and cultivated the ability to direct theenergies into the central channel. Thus the foundation stone of both practices[sleep and dream yogas] is the inner heat doctrine.Only when progress in dream yoga has been made firm can one effectively workwith the bardo yogas. Thus here again [with the bardo yogas] the foundationstone is the power achieved through the inner heat....As for the yogas of special consciousness transference and forceful projection,as a preliminary to them one must cultivate the ability to draw thelife-sustaining energies into the central channel. Therefore in these two theinner heat yoga again is the foundation stone.Thus the inner heat yoga is the basis for success in the remaining five yogas.For this reason Tsongkhapa and most later Gelukpa commentators made theelucidation of this yoga their prime concern.In recent centuries most treatises written by the Tibetan lamas of the twelveKargyu schools drop out the fifth yoga-that of forceful projection into anotherbody-because the Naropa lineage of this yoga allegedly was lost with the deathof Marpa's son Darma Dodey. They make up the list of six by separating dreamyoga from the illusory body yogas and treat it by itself.Tsongkhapa, however, like Pal Pakmo Drupa, taught dream yoga as one of the threestages of the illusory body training, and this tradition has continued inGelukpa commentarial literature. He provides a detailed account of the forcefulprojection yoga in A Book of Three Inspirations, but in A Practice Manual on theSix Yogas he simply mentions the yoga by name and does not elucidate thepractice, presumably because he considers it beyond the abilities and concernsof most people.This having been said, it is important to remember that, even though the Naropalineage of the forceful projection yoga may perhaps have died out (and even thistheory is questionable), the source of the technique is The Chaturpita Tantra,which, together with its oral transmission, still survives.Whatever the case may be, the forceful projection yoga is undoubtedly the leastused of any of the Six Yogas, and is really only maintained out of honor to themasters of the past.EARLY LITERATURE ON THE SIX YOGASAlthough it is generally stated that the Indian mahasiddha Tilopa formulated thetradition of the Six Yogas and transmitted it to Naropa, and also that Naropatransmitted the tradition to his Tibetan disciple Marpa Lotsawa, who imported itinto Tibet, there is not much literature on the Six Yogas from this earlyperiod. The Nartang Tengyur, or canonical collection of texts by Indian Buddhistmasters that were translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan, contains only one shortverse work by Tilopa on the subject (included here as Chapter One), and nothingby Naropa. The Dergey Tengyur, which is an alternative canonical collectionpublished in Eastern Tibet several generations later, contains the same text byTilopa, and also one slightly longer work by Naropa (included here as ChapterTwo).It would also seem that Marpa Lotsawa, who brought the lineage to Tibet in themid-eleventh century, did not write much on the Six Yogas. Tsongkhapa mentionsin A Book of Three Inspirations that some Tibetans do attribute one work to him;but the manner in which he refers to the matter suggests that it is acontroversial subject and that most lamas do not accept the authenticity of theclaim. Nor did Marpa's immediate disciple Milarepa write on the system. AsTsongkhapa puts it in A Book of Three Inspirations,Two fundamental texts serve as the basis of the Six Yogas of Naropa: The EarlyCompendium Root Text and The Later Compendium Root Text.' It seems that thereare two major problems with the former work. Some commentaries say that thesecond one was compiled by Lama Marpa himself.... We see such statements made,but it is difficult to ascertain their veracity.Another work attributed to Lama Marpa is entitled The Eight Instructions, whichblends verse and prose in its presentation. Then there is The Vajra Song of theSix Yogas. However, these two are only intended to plant the seeds of the oraltradition teachings and are too brief to do much more than that.The reason for this terseness in the early literature on the Six Yogas is thatin those days the system was taught purely as an ear-whispered transmissionteaching (Tib. snyan brgyud). As Lama Tsongkhapa states, these brief writtenworks were mainly intended to place seeds on the mindstream of the disciple, notto serve as practical guides. This latter function would have been performed byan oral teaching received directly from a lineage holder.In later centuries, however, the Six Yogas became the subject of much literaryactivity, and hundreds of commentaries appeared. This was not a matter of theTibetans becoming sloppy in their attitudes toward tantric secrecy, but ratherwas a fulfillment of an instruction given by Naropa himself.In a concluding verse to his text Vajra Verses of the Whispered Tradition,Naropa wrote,[../Images/page0019_0000.svg]Thus Naropa clearly states that for thirteen generations in Tibet thetransmission of the Six Yogas should be treated with great secrecy, and passedexclusively as an oral tradition, i.e., should not be written out in detail. Theimplication is that after that time the world would be ready for it to becomethe subject of commentarial literature.It is significant that Lama Jey Tsongkhapa, perhaps the greatest writer inTibetan history, belonged to the fourteenth generation of Tibetan masters, whichwas the first generation to be allowed to write openly on the Six Yogas. His twotexts greatly contributed to the preservation of the tradition, as well as tothe popularity that the Six Yogas achieved over the succeeding centuries.Here Tilopa and Naropa are not included in the count of thirteen generations,because the instruction of \"secrecy for thirteen generations\" was given byNaropa to his disciple Marpa, making Marpa the first of the thirteen.The names of the early Tibetan masters in the line of transmission that passedfrom generation to generation and eventually came to Lama Jey Tsongkhapa are asfollows: (1) Marpa Lotsawa, who received the transmission from Naropa; (2)Milarepa, the most important of the three disciples to receive the lineage fromMarpa; (3) Gampopa, the most successful of Milarepa's two chief disciples; (4)Pal Pakmo Drupa, founder of the Pakmo Drupa Kargyu school and the chief ofGampopa's four main disciples (each of whom formed one of the \"Four Older Kargyuschools\"); (5) Drikung Jigten Sumgon, founder of the Drikung Kargyu school andthe senior of Pal Pakmo Drupa's eight chief disciples (each of whom formed oneof the \"Eight Younger Kargyu schools\"); (6) Tsangpa Rechung, an early DrikungKargyu master; (7) Jampa Palwa, also of the Drikung Kargyu; (8) Sonam Wangpo,another yogi of the Drikung Kargyu to achieve enlightenment in one lifetime; (9)Sonam Sengey, a lion amongst yogis; (10) Yangtsewa, one of the Drikung Kargyu'smost talented and prolific writers; (11) Buton Rinchen Drubpa, a lama of theSakya school, from whom is traced the Zhalu school; (12) Khedrub Jampa Pel,Bu-ton's main Dharma heir in the Six Yogas transmission; (13) Lama DrakpaJangchup, a Zhalu lama of great renown; and (14) Lama Jey Tsongkhapa, founder ofGanden Monastery and the Geluk school.'Thus Lama Jey Tsongkhapa belongs to the fourteenth generation in the Tibetanline of transmission, and as such was free to write extensively on the system.ORIGINAL SOURCES OF THE SIX YOGASAs with all Buddhist teachings, tradition claims that the original source of theSix Yogas of Naropa is none other than the Buddha himself, who 2,500 years agotaught many different sutras and tantras, the former being his open discoursesand the latter his secret Vajrayana discourses. The Six Yogas of Naropa is asynthesis of numerous tantric doctrines embodied in the original tantras taughtby the Buddha. This is explained by Lama Tsongkhapa in A Book of ThreeInspirations,The instruction on the inner heat yoga comes to us through Tilopa, who commentedthat this was the transmission of the mahasiddha Krishnacharya, also known [toTibetans] as Lobpon Acharyapa, which fuses [the teachings on inner heat yogafound in] the Hevajra Tantra and the Heruka Chakrasamvara Tantra....The illusory body and the clear light doctrines are derived from the oraltradition teachings of the Guhyasamaja Tantra, as transmitted through the Indianmahasiddha Jnanagarbha. This Marpa tradition of the Guhyasamaja oral instructiontransmission has been used as the basis, with embellishments from theGuhyasamaja transmission of the Aryas, Father and Sons [i.e., Nagarjuna and hisdisciples Aryadeva and Chandrakirti].The practices of consciousness transference and forceful projection to a newresidence are based primarily on the Shri Chaturpita Tantra.°Thus all six of the Naropa yogas are sourced in original tantric texts taught bythe Buddha. The inner heat yoga is a fusion of those practices taught in theHevajra Tantra and the Heruka Chakrasamvara Tantra; the illusory body and clearlight yogas are based on the Guhyasamaja Tantra; and both consciousnesstransference and forceful projection yogas are based on the Shri ChaturpitaTantra. All of these original tantras were taught by the Buddha. Here LamaTsongkhapa does not mention the bardo yoga separately, for in the Six Yogastradition this is treated as an extension of the illusory body yoga, and thus isalso based on the Guhyasamaja Tantra.All of these original tantras were translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan and arepreserved in the Kangyur canon. In addition, numerous commentaries to them bylater Indian masters are preserved in the Tengyur. Tsongkhapa points out thatfor the Six Yogas tradition the most important of the Indian commentaries isKrishnacharya's treatise on the inner heat yoga.THE NAME OF THE TRANSMISSIONAs we will see later in Chapter One, which contains Tilopa's brief verse work onthe Six Yogas, Tilopa primarily drew from four Indian lineages in formulatingthe system that would become known to history as the Six Yogas. The title of histext was probably given retroactively by the Tibetans; it is a guide to what isknown as \"Tilopa's Four Instructions,\" which when translated into yogic practicebecome the Six Yogas.The title of the slightly longer verse work by Tilopa's Indian disciple Naropa,after whom the Tibetans named the system, was probably also given retroactivelyby the Tibetans. This is indicated by the fact that in the early days of thelineage in Tibet there were traditions of speaking of two, three, four, six,eight and ten yogas. Had both Tilopa and Naropa spoken specifically of sixyogas, as the names of their two texts would seem to imply, the Tibetans wouldautomatically have followed this lead, and there would not be a tradition ofspeaking of differing numbers of yogas. In fact the name of the text given inits colophon is The Vajra Verses: An Instruction to Jnana Dakini; the officialtitle under which it appears in the Tengyur-Vajra Verses of the WhisperedTradition-is not mentioned in the text itself.In all probability it was Milarepa's chief disciple Gampopa, whose work producedthe Dakpo Kargyu school (which later branched into the Four Older and EightYounger Kargyu subsects), who popularized the name the \"Six Yogas of Naropa.\" Abrief treatise using the name \"the Six Yogas\" appears in his Collected Works. Ofcourse the phrase also exists in Milarepa's biography; but this was composedseveral generations later and again probably introduces the terminologyretroactively.It seems that Marpa and Milarepa mostly referred to the lineage as \"the OralInstruction Transmission for Achieving Liberation in the Bardo.\" Lama JeyTsongkhapa refers to this name in the introductory section of his longercommentary, A Book of Three Inspirations, wherein he discusses the necessity forachieving maturity in the basic Buddhist practices before engaging in advancedtantric trainings such as the Six Yogas of Naropa. He writes,It is recorded that when Venerable Milarepa taught the oral instructiontransmission for achieving liberation in the bardo he said, \"First establish thebasics, such as Refuge in the Three Jewels, the two aspects of the enlightenmentmind-aspirational and engaged-and so forth.SOtherwise both [guru and disciple]will fall over the precipice of spiritual disaster, like two oxen yokedtogether....\"The above expression \"the oral instruction transmission for achieving liberationin the bardo\" is synonymous [with the Six Yogas of Naropa].^In Chapter Four we will see more on this name for the Six Yogas tradition, \"theoral instruction transmission for achieving liberation in the bardo,\" whenGyalwa Wensapa, a wonderful fifteenth-century Gelukpa lama and yogi who spentmuch of his life in retreat, discusses the Six Yogas from the perspective of howthey relate to the process of blending the three kayas with the three bardos, orin-between states: the bardo of waking state consciousness; the bardo of sleepand dreams; and the bardo between death and rebirth. This process is also knownas \"the three blendings,\" which is another name for the Six Yogas system.THE LIVING TRADITIONThe Six Yogas of Naropa has inspired meditators of Central Asia for a thousandyears now, and continues to be as popular as ever. It is practiced to someextent in all sects of Tibetan Buddhism, although is especially popular in theKargyu and Geluk schools. During the twelve years that I lived with the Tibetanrefugees in India I had the wonderful fortune to encounter many yogis who werewell established in the practice. There were always a dozen or so Gelukpa monksand nuns dedicated to the training who lived in the caves and huts in themountains above Dharamsala. Forty miles southeast along the Himalayas, in theTibetan settlement of Tashi Jong, the long-haired tokden yogis of the DrukpaKargyu school underwent six-year retreats in the Six Yogas. Another fifty milessoutheast at Manali, high in the mountains of the Kulu Valley, His Eminence ApoRinpochey constantly trained groups of Ladakhi monks in the system. Other groupspursued the Six Yogas training in other parts of the Himalayas. To mention but afew, there were Karma Kargyupas in the hills above Rumtek, Sikkim; ShangpaKargyupas in the mountains above Darjeeling; Drikung Kargyupas in the caves andhermitages of Ladakh; Drukpa Kargyupas in Bhutan; and Nyingmapas in Nepal. Allof these monks, nuns, yogis and yoginis upheld and continued the ancient lineageof the Six Yogas descending from Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa and Milarepa.Each of the different schools of Tibetan Buddhism has developed the Six Yogastradition in its own individual way and brought a unique character and flavor tothe legacy. The Geluk school has made its own contributions in this respect, andI hope that my two books on the Six Yogas somewhat reflect this.In Tsongkhapa's Six Yogas of Naropa I tried to convey a sense of the genius ofLama Jey Tsongkhapa and the vastness of his approach to the Six Yogas. In thiscollection of readings on the Six Yogas I am attempting to show how the originaltradition as laid out by Tilopa and Naropa, and as clarified by Lama JeyTsongkhapa, has continued to inspire practitioners over the centuries and hascome into the present era with both depth and power.[../Images/img0001.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"THE ORAL INSTRUCTION OF THE SIX YOGASSkt.

This work gave him plenty of spare time, and ashe sat in the fields with his herds he passed the hours first by learning toread and write, and then by studying and memorizing many of the great Buddhistscriptures. By the time he reached his teens he had become self-educated in theclassics.After he reached adulthood he journeyed to Oddiyana (the presentday Swat Valleyof Pakistan), where he received numerous transmissions from a group of femalemystics. Later he traveled widely and studied under many different Buddhistmasters. He spent years in the intensive practice of meditation and eventuallyachieved enlightenment.'His biography states that the main lineages he received and emphasized in hispersonal practice were the Madhyamaka doctrines and the Guhyasamaja Tantratransmissions descending from the mahasiddha Nagarjuna; the clear light andbardo doctrines of the mahasiddha Lawapa; the Heruka Chakrasamvara lineagesdescending from the mahasiddha Luipada; the Mahamudra lineages of the mahasiddhaShavari; and the inner heat doctrines of the Hevajra Tantra as transmittedthrough Krishnacharya.In his later life Tilopa manifested countless miraculous activities in order toinspire and enlighten trainees. He could stop the sun in its path, shape-shiftby changing himself into animal forms, fly through the sky, and visibly manifesttantric mandalas in space. Sometimes he lived quietly as a monk, and at othersdwelled with corpses in charnel grounds. To provide conditions by which beingscould collect merit he sometimes sustained himself by begging for alms,sometimes by operating a whore-house.Tilopa's name, in the colophon to our text spelled \"Tillipa,\" means \"Sesame-seedMan.\" He earned this name because as a part of his enlightenment path he workedas a pounder of sesame seeds for producing oil, taking his work as a metaphorfor how the oil of enlightenment is extracted from the seed of mundaneexperience. He had many disciples, but the greatest of all was Naropa, to whomhe transmitted the Six Yogas that he had formulated.Several short texts on the Six Yogas that are attributed to Tilopa exist inTibetan, but only the verse work herein translated was considered authenticbeyond question, and therefore was the only one to be included in the Tibetancanon of Indian commentaries, the Tengyur.Tilopa's text is only a few verses in length but is nonetheless important inthat it is the earliest known work on the Six Yogas. It mentions four importantlineage masters from whom the Six Yogas had come to him: Krishnacharya,Nagarjuna, Lawapa and Sukhasiddhi. These four are the sources of the longer listgiven above, as gleaned from his biography.In the translation I have added subheads giving the name of each of the sixyogas. This may perhaps break the flow created by Tilopa's continuous style, butas compensation clarifies the ideas embodied in the work.Tilopa's arrangement of the Six Yogas seems to be slightly different from thatwhich became popular in Tibet in the Pakmo Drupa Kargyu school and subsequentlyin the Geluk. He lists them as (1) inner heat yoga from Krishnacharya, whom herefers to as Charyapa; (2) illusory body yoga from Nagarjuna; (3) dream yogafrom Lawapa; (4) clear light yoga, also from Nagarjuna; (5) bardo yoga fromSukhasiddhi; and finally (6) the consciousness transference and forcefulprojection yogas, also from Sukhasiddhi.z My subheads indicate how they aregrouped in the Pakmo Drupa Kargyu and Geluk schools."},{"pageContent":"THE ORAL INSTRUCTION OF THE SIX YOGASby the Indian Mahasiddha Tilopa[../Images/page0028_0000.svg]INNER HEAT YOGA[../Images/page0028_0001.svg]ILLUSORY BODY YOGA[../Images/page0029_0000.svg][../Images/page0029_0001.svg]CLEAR LIGHT YOGA[../Images/page0029_0002.svg]BARDO YOGA[../Images/page0029_0003.svg][../Images/page0030_0000.svg]YOGAS OF CONSCIOUSNESS TRANSFERENCE AND FORCEFUL PROJECTION[../Images/page0030_0001.svg]The colop{ion: Written from the words of the mahasiddha Tillipa; translated bythe Indian sage Pandit Naropa and Marpa Lodrakpa Chokyi Lotru at the Kashmiriholy site known as Mount Pushpahara.[../Images/img0002.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"VAJRA VERSES OF THEWHISPERED TRADITIONSkt.

However, he soon left the worldly life and took theordination of a Buddhist monk.As a young renunciate he dedicated himself to intense study and practice. Hislearning and intellectual prowess became legendary, and by his early thirties hehad risen in the Buddhist monastic hierarchy to the position of abbot ofNalanda, India's most prestigious monastic university. He retained the abbotshipfor some eight years, achieving widespread fame as one of India's foremostBuddhist scholars.However, although his learning was unmatched, his inner realization was stillincomplete. This became obvious to him when he was in his fortieth year.According to his biography, one day he was quietly reading a scripture when henoticed an ugly old woman observing him. She inquired, \"Do you understand thewords of what you are reading?\" Naropa replied to the affirmative. The old haglaughed and added, \"And do you understand the essence?\" Again Naropa replied tothe affirmative, whereupon the old woman burst out in tears. \"Here you arelying,\" she scolded.The traditional accounts state that the old hag was in fact a dakini, an angelin disguise, manifesting in order to guide him to the fulfillment of hisdestiny. The encounter profoundly affected Naropa, and he realized that hisBuddhist understanding was merely intellectual. He resigned his seat in themonastery and left in search of a tantric guru.This search led him through many adventures. Eventually, however, he met withTilopa and entered into an intense twelve-year training under him. The feats ofdevotion and commitment that he had to manifest, and the many hardships that heunderwent, have become the stuff of legend with Tibetans. Eventually, however,he achieved enlightenment.'In his later life he in turn trained many disciples. The most famous of these inTibetan literature is Marpa Lotsawa, a Tibetan translator who travelled to Indiathree times and received the Six Yogas from him. It was Marpa Lotsawa whotranslated into Tibetan the brief text on the Six Yogas that follows, theauthorship of which is attributed to Naropa.Naropa's text on the Six Yogas was not included in the original edition of theTengyur compiled by Bu-ton Rinchen Drubpa, presumably either because no Sanskritedition was known in Bu-ton's time or else because Buton doubted theauthenticity of the authorship. However, it was included in the Dergey Tengyur,and here I have translated it from that source.'As mentioned in the Introduction, there are traditions of speaking about two,three, four, six, eight and ten yogas of Naropa. All ten are subsumed under thelist of six. The more expansive arrangement simply separates out the variouspractices for the sake of convenience. When they become arranged as ten the listis as follows: (1) the generation stage yogas; (2) the view of emptiness; (3)the inner heat yoga; (4) karmamudra yoga; (5) the illusory body practice; (6)the clear light; (7) dream yoga; (8) the bardo yogas; (9) consciousnesstransference; and (10) forceful projection.' Naropa's text has verses thatmention all ten of these, but places numbers two and four from the above list asdoctrines eight and nine.To facilitate an understanding of how he presents all ten in his short text Ihave provided the translation with subheads."},{"pageContent":"VAJRA VERSES OF THE WHISPERED TRADITIONby the Indian Mahasiddha NaropaHomage to the transcended and accomplished Buddha Vajradhara.[../Images/page0036_0000.svg]THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE GURU AND THE DISCIPLE[../Images/page0036_0001.svg]INITIATION AND THE GENERATION STAGE YOGAS[../Images/page0036_0002.svg][../Images/page0037_0000.svg]INNER HEAT YOGA[../Images/page0037_0001.svg][../Images/page0037_0002.svg]ILLUSORY BODY YOGA[../Images/page0037_0003.svg][../Images/page0037_0004.svg]DREAM YOGA[../Images/page0038_0000.svg]CLEAR LIGHT YOGA[../Images/page0038_0001.svg]CONSCIOUSNESS TRANSFERENCE YOGA[../Images/page0038_0002.svg]FORCEFUL PROJECTION YOGA[../Images/page0038_0003.svg][../Images/page0039_0000.svg]KARMAMUDRA YOGA[../Images/page0039_0001.svg][../Images/page0039_0002.svg][../Images/page0039_0003.svg][../Images/page0039_0004.svg]YOGA OF CULTIVATING THE VIEW[../Images/page0039_0005.svg][../Images/page0040_0000.svg][../Images/page0040_0001.svg][../Images/page0040_0002.svg][../Images/page0040_0003.svg]BARDO YOGAS[../Images/page0040_0004.svg][../Images/page0040_0005.svg][../Images/page0041_0000.svg]THE RESULTS OF PRACTICE[../Images/page0041_0001.svg][../Images/page0041_0002.svg][../Images/page0041_0003.svg][../Images/page0041_0004.svg][../Images/page0042_0000.svg]The colophon: Thus is complete The Vajra Verses: An Instruction to Jnana Dakini.It is from the mouth of the Indian sage Mahapandita Naropa, and was translated[into Tibetan] and then ascertained by the translator Marpa Chokyi Lotru at theholy site known as Pushpahari.[../Images/img0003.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"NOTES ON"},{"pageContent":"A BOOK OF THREE INSPIRATIONSTib.

It touches upon everything thepractitioner wishing to engage in the Six Yogas should know, from the basicGeneral Mahayana preliminary trainings, the special tantric preliminaries, whattantric initiations are necessary and why, and the preparatory generation stageyogas, up to the various techniques involved in the Six Yogas themselves.In 1836 Jey Sherab Gyatso gave a public reading of A Book of Three Inspirations,and one of his students took notes on the discourse. After Jey Sherab Gyatsopassed away these were published in his Collected Works.Jey Sherab Gyatso's discourse mostly focuses on the preliminary trainings thatsomeone wishing to enter into practice of the Six Yogas has to complete beforeentering into the actual trainings, and also on the special characteristics ofthe approach to emptiness associated with the Six Yogas tradition. We sawNaropa's verses on these subjects in the previous chapter; here Sherab Gyatsolooks at some of the developments of this trend in Tibet.The aim of Jey Sherab Gyatso's Notes is not to expand upon Tsongkhapa'streatise, but rather to contextualize some of the ideas found there. It thusworks well as an introduction to the present volume in particular, and to thespiritual sentiment of the Six Yogas tradition in general. It is less technicalin style than are the other works included in this volume because it was drawnfrom an oral discourse. In compiling the text the editors left out anything thatthey felt was perfectly clear in Tsongkhapa's writings and emphasized remarksmade by Jey Sherab Gyatso during his discourse that they felt contributed to anunderstanding of little-known or controversial points in the training. Theresult is a gem of a text that sketches a skeletal portrait of the tradition.Jey Sherab Gyatso was one of the preeminent Gelukpa masters of the nineteenthcentury. His many teaching activities as well as his numerous writings greatlycontributed to the tremendous vibrancy that the Gelukpa achieved in that era.In this text Jey Sherab Gyatso tells how he collected the transmission lineagesof both of Lama Jey Tsongkhapa's texts on the Six Yogashis formal treatise, ABook of Three Inspirations, and the shorter work found in his Collected Works, APractice Manual on the Six Yogas. Although Jey Sherab Gyatso's Notes is acommentary to the longer of Tsongkhapa's two texts on the Six Yogas, it serveswell as an introductory reader for his shorter manual, which is included asChapter Five of the present volume. It also provides an excellent overview ofthe traditional approach to the Six Yogas trainings. In addition, his commentson the lineage of transmission and on various philosophical implications of thetradition throw light on the legacy of the Six Yogas tradition as maintained inthe various Tibetan schools."},{"pageContent":"NOTES ON A BOOK OF THREE INSPIRATIONSby fey Sherab GyatsoMarpa of Lodrak received numerous transmissions directly from the illustrious[Indian] pandit Naropa. Among these were six instructions drawn from the varioustantric traditions. He gathered these six into the structure that has becomefamed as Naropa's Six Yogas. Each of these six contains a comprehensivepresentation of the completion stage yogas, and the six as presented hereprovide a comprehensive approach to the completion stage yogas.Naropa imparted the Six Yogas to Marpa, together with The Vajra Song on the SixYogas. However, even though all six of these Dharmas certainly existed in Indiaprior to Naropa, whether or not they had at that time been arranged into thatstructure is a point of doubt.Naropa's Six Yogas was the unique instruction of the early Kargyu lamas. LamaTsongkhapa the Great received this tradition, and later composed his treatise onthe system, A Book of Three Inspirations. Thus the Six Yogas came into theGanden [i.e., Geluk] order.The Kargyupas are especially renowned for their tradition of the Six Yogas, andtheir early lineage masters, such as Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, Pakmo Drupa andDrikungpa Jigten Sumgon, were flawless elucidators of the tradition. However, asthe lineage passed from generation to generation a large number of subtle pointsof unclarity found their way into many of the oral transmissions. Jey GyalwaNyipa [the Second Buddha, i.e., Tsongkhapa] removed these, and clarified all thekey points and basic principles of the system. For this reason the lineage ofthe Six Yogas of Naropa as practiced within the Geluk order today is especiallypowerful.I received the transmission of Tsongkhapa the Great's A Book of ThreeInspirations from the great guru Drakkar Kachu Rinpochey' and trained in theyogas under him. At that time I was not able to receive the transmission of [theshorter text on the Six Yogas in Tsongkhapa's Collected Works, namely,] thenotes on the Six Yogas made by Jangsem Kun- zangpa2 from Tsongkhapa's oralteachings. At that time my own tantric teacher had to leave the area, and Imyself was quite busy, so was unable to request it from him. However, shortlythereafter Pa Rinto Yontsang had to go to Central Tibet, so I requested him tocollect the lineage [of that text] from Gyalsey Rinpochey and to pass it to meon his return.; I had previously received instruction on the energy control andinner heat yogas, which had opened my eyes to these techniques; but these twotexts by Tsongkhapa seemed to me to be unsurpassed in clarity on the subject. Tohave the opportunity to hear them is a most wondrous ripening of positive karma,and one should pay heed.A widely used text for explaining the Six Yogas in other sects [prior to thetime of Tsongkhapa the Great] was that known as A Thousand Blazing Sunbeams.'However, that manual is not particularly clear on the inner heat yoga, thephysical exercises for purification, nor the meditations on the body as an emptyshell. Moreover, many of the later Kargyu lamas had begun to by-pass thetrainings in the General Mahayana as a preliminary to entering into tantrictraining, and had begun to teach the second stage of tantric practice [to whichthe Six Yogas of Naropa belong] without first establishing the basics of thefirst stage. Tsongkhapa composed A Book of Three Inspirations as a remedy tothese problems.To demonstrate the necessity of training in the General Mahayana meditations asa preliminary to tantric practice, Tsongkhapa quotes many of the early greatKargyu masters, such as Marpa, Milarepa, and so forth. In this way hedemonstrates that the early Kargyu lamas did not condone by-passing the GeneralMahayana trainings.As he points out, one should begin by making firm one's sense of spiritualrefuge and one's maturity in the bodhisattva trainings [i.e., the GeneralMahayana teachings], and then receive the tantric empowerments.To accomplish stability in these basic trainings, the early Kargyu mastersadvocated the preliminaries known as the \"Four Dharmas of Dakpo Gampopa\" (Tib.Dvags po sGarn po pa'i chos bzhis): (1) meditations that cause the mind to turntoward the Dharma; (2) meditations that cause the Dharma to transform into thepath; (3) meditations that cause the path to pacify confusion; and (4)meditations that cause confusion to arise as wisdom.'Prior to Tsongkhapa the Great, Kargyu masters such as Yang Gonpa relied upon themeditative tradition embodied in the text Twenty-One Instructions, whichcontains ideas and practices similar to those found in the Lamrim literature andFifty Verses on the Guru. Tsongkhapa advocates the Lamrim tradition of themaster Atisha as the basis of the trainings in the General Mahayana practices;in A Book of Three Inspirations he refers to Atisha, and then quotes severalverses from a song by Milarepa, in order to dispel the assumption, held by many,that the views of Atisha and Milarepa were in conflict on the subject of theneed for the General Mahayana preliminaries.'Milarepa's three verses embody the three levels of the Lamrim trainings: thefirst points to the initial level trainings, the second points to theintermediate trainings, and the remaining one points to the trainings of greatperspective.[../Images/page0050_0000.svg][../Images/page0050_0001.svg][../Images/page0050_0002.svg]Milarepa's songs embody many doctrines unique to the Kargyu school, but most ofthem are in harmony with the teachings of Lama Tsongkhapa.Lama Tsongkhapa quotes two more verses that similarly reflect how Milarepa'steachings were in accord with Atisha's doctrine of cultivating the three levelsof spiritual perspective as a preliminary to tantric training.[../Images/page0051_0000.svg][../Images/page0051_0001.svg]Tsongkhapa thus speaks of the need for training the mind in the General Mahayanaas a preliminary to entering into tantric training; and also of the need forthen receiving the tantric empowerments as well as maintaining the disciplinesand guidelines of tantric practice. He points out that a partial empowerment,and also a blessing empowerment, is not sufficient if one has not previouslyreceived the four complete initiations into an appropriate mandala system.Some of the other schools [of Tibetan Buddhism], such as the Nyingma and Sakya,rely upon a cycle of texts known as \"The Four Great Treatises on the PreliminaryPractices\" (Tib. sNgon 'gro khrid chen bzhi). Although there is nothing directlyfrom the hand of Tsongkhapa the Great that deals with the preliminaries in thatmanner, i.e., with the General Mahayana and exclusive Vajrayana preliminaries inone text, he has written extensively on the General Mahayana preliminaries [inhis Lamrim treatises] and treated those of the Vajrayana in various of histantric works.The two exclusive preliminaries emphasized in the Six Yogas system are those ofVajrasattva and guru yoga.' Both of these use some form of the seven-limbedrite. Actually, from within the range of practices for purifying the mind thatare common to both the General Mahayana and the Vajrayana is that known as theseven-limbed rite, together with the mandala offering.' Furthermore, as a meansof facilitating the guarding of the Vajrayana disciplines and guidelines, theVajrasattva meditation and recitation of the hundred-syllable mantra isrecommended. And even though some manuals on the tantric trainings state thatthe Vajrasattva practice is unnecessary for those who keep their disciplineswell, nonetheless every school and sect that maintains a tradition of the SixYogas of Naropa recommends it. As well, it is used in conjunction with almostall tantric systems of completion stage yoga.In the meditation and mantra recitation of Vajrasattva, the way in whichVajrasattva is seen as an embodiment of all objects of refuge is common to alltantric deity-yoga practices. Here the tantric activity is that of purificationof negative karma and spiritual obscurations, and hence there is a predominanceof the color white in the meditation. For example, either the five buddhas whoare summoned and hold up vases of empowering nectars are seen as being white incolor, or else they emanate white lights; or else the five buddhas, fourconsorts and so forth of the complete mandala emphasize the color white.In the meditation on guru yoga, the guru is visualized as appearing in the spacein front of oneself in the form of Buddha Vajradhara, seated upon a throneupheld by eight lions. Whatever generation-stage mandala yoga one is engaged in,it is important always to see the mandala deities as being in the nature ofone's guru; this leads to quick attainment of blessing powers. One's personalguru is more kind to one than are all the buddhas, for it is with him that onehas karmic connections, and he whom one can see and hear directly. We have thelink to communicate with him as directly as we do with our own parents.Thus to visualize Buddha Vajradhara as above or separate from one's own guru isa mistaken mode of practice. This is not only the case in the guru yogapreliminary meditation, but also with all mandala deity-yoga practices. In theprocess of arising as the mandala deity, one should meditate that one's body andthe body of the guru are of one inseparable nature, and that this arises in theform of the mandala deity. Similarly, one's speech is inseparably one with thespeech of the guru, and this arises as the communicative power of the mandaladeity. Third, one's mind is inseparably of one nature with that of the guru, andthis arises as the mind of the mandala deity. Finally, one's suchness nature andthat of the guru are inseparable, and this manifests as the suchness of themandala deity.When one meditates on the mandala deity in conjunction with guru yoga in thisway, the siddhis are more quickly achieved.The guru yoga meditation generally includes the symbolic offering of theuniverse in the form of a cosmogram. This is known as the mandala offering. Whenthis is done in connection with completion stage yoga, the twenty-three partmandala offering is used [as opposed to the shorter seven-part or longerthirty-seven part mandala offerings]. The liturgy for the twenty-three partmandala offering was actually composed by Panchen Naropa himself [so it isespecially relevant to the Six Yogas tradition].One takes a mandala offering base and imagines that upon it one places the worldand its inhabitants as offerings, together with the body, speech, mind, andpleasures of oneself and all others, from now until enlightenment is attained,and the root of goodness of times past, present, and future. All of this isoffered as a mandala, visualized as having the nature of wisdom and preciousgems, and presented in the manner of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra's peerlessofferings, immeasurable in number as the extent of space. The master Tang Sakpamentions this in his commentary to the Vajrabhairava mandala meditation. Thetradition is not clear elsewhere, but is lucidly presented in A Book of ThreeInspirations. The mandala offering is made in this way, and then the guru yogameditation concludes with the four empowerments being bestowed by means offlowing nectars. The first three purify coarse karmic stains and obscurationscollected by means of body, speech, and mind, and establish the seeds of thethree buddha kayas.4 The fourth empowerment purifies the subtle obscurations toomniscience and establishes the seed of yuganaddha, the state of great union.This is a specialty of the meditation as performed in the tradition of the SixYogas of Naropa.After these preliminary meditations for training the mind [through the GeneralMahayana meditations], purification [through Vajrasattva], and the enhancementof creative energy [through the meditation of guru yoga] have been made stable,one engages in the generation stage yogas.The principle behind the generation stage yogas is the process known as \"takingbirth, death, and bardo as the path of the three kayas.\" The concept here isthat by means of the generation stage yogas [the trainee] is introduced to theprocess of transforming the experiences of birth, death, and bardo into thethree kayas of enlightenment: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya. Thisprepares the mind for the methods of the completion stage yogas, which bringabout this actual transformation.The Sakya and Kargyu schools mostly rely upon simplified mandalas using only apair of central deities, male-female-in-union, such as Hevajra and his consortNairatmya, for accomplishing this ripening process of the generation stage.However, Tsongkhapa recommends that in the beginning we should practice with acomplete mandala, and then later, when stability has been attained, reduce it tothe central male-female-in-union deity. This reduces the risk of incurringdangerous side-effects from the yogas of working with the chakras, energies, andso forth. It is not recommended to do the simplified deity practice from thebeginning. The important principle here is that the meditation upon thesupporting mandala purifies perception of the world, and meditation upon thesupported mandala deities purifies the practitioner's five psychophysicalaggregates.This can be accomplished by meditation upon any of a number of mandalas, but themandala should be at least as complex as that of the Ghantapada lineage of theChakrasamvara mandala, which has five deities, for we want to purify the fivepsychophysical aggregates and transform the five inner distortions into the fivewisdoms.An exception to this rule [of a mandala having a minimum of five deities], asTsongkhapa points out in several of his writings, is the mandala of SolitaryVajrabhairava, wherein a single mandala deity suffices for the process. Manylamas from other schools question Tsongkhapa's logic on this recommendation ofSolitary Vajrabhairava. Tsongkhapa's idea here is that the Vajrabhairava mandalacombines elements from both the male and female tantric cycles and is unique inthis respect.In fact, Tsongkhapa held the view that because Naropa's Six Yogas embodieselements from both the male and female tantras, it is acceptable to prepare fortraining in the Six Yogas by practicing the generation stage yogas with any ofthe three main tantric cycles: Guhyasamaja, Heruka Chakrasamvara, orVajrabhairava. Tsongkhapa points out that many of the early gurus used eitherHevajra or Heruka Chakrasamvara as their personal meditational deity, and thusthey accomplished the generation stage yogas in conjunction with a mandala fromone of those two cycles. However, this does not mean that the practitioner islimited to these two mandala cycles.The process of the generation stage yogas begins by concentrating on oneself asthe lord of the mandala surrounded by the mandala entourage. If the centraldeity has many faces and hands, one first concentrates on the main face andaccomplishes clarity with it. One then concentrates on the two main hands. Afterthat one gradually supplements the visualization with other details of the maindeity, and then goes on to the consort, entourage, and supporting mandala, untilall appears with total clarity.In conjunction with this practice of cultivating radiant visualization of themandala and its deities one cultivates the divine pride, \"I am the tantricdeity.\" At first this thought is contrived, but gradually it arisesspontaneously.On the generation stage of practice the divine tantric pride of having the formof the deity is accomplished. Then during the completion stage yoga, at thephase of practice known as \"the vajra recitation,\" the divine tantric pride ofthe communicative dimension of the deity is accomplished. Finally, the divinetantric pride of the mind of the deity is accomplished at the stage of the clearlight yogas.After the generation stage yogas have been made firm one engages in thecultivation of the view of emptiness.These days in Tibet there are many lamas who teach that the emptiness philosophyof the tantras is different from that of Arya Nagarjuna, and that the former ishigher. However, many different sources, including the collection of texts knownas \"Four Interwoven Treatises\" (Tib. 'Grel pa bzhi sbrags), reveal how the twosystems are in harmony.Some Kargyupas even say that the Mahamudra philosophy of Marpa and Milarepa ishigher than the Madhyamaka emptiness doctrine of Nagarjuna. Tsongkhapa quotes asong by Lama Marpa to show that the two-Madhyamaka and Mahamudra-are in harmony:[../Images/page0055_0000.svg]This demonstrates how Marpa achieved his understanding of Mahamudra underMaitripa. This master was definitely a follower of Chandrakirti, the greatelucidator of Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka doctrine of emptiness, as demonstrated by[Maitripa's treatise] Ten Reflections on Simple Suchness. Tsongkhapa quotes thistext,[../Images/page0055_0001.svg]His point in using this passage is that it proves Maitripa was definitely aproponent of the Prasangika Madhyamaka view. Maitripa is saying that theapproach to emptiness philosophy as presented by the two Svatantrika Madhyamakaschools-that advocating \"emptiness with characteristics\" and that advocating\"emptiness without charac- teristics\"-do not have the capacity to induce thefinal wisdom of suchness, so how much more is this the case with the lowerschools, such as Vaibashika, Sautrantika and Yogachara, which speak in terms of\"true aspects\" and \"false aspects\"?Then, in order to show that this is not merely his personal interpretation ofMaitripa's words, Tsongkhapa quotes an Indian commentary to the passage. Thiscommentary was written by Sahajavajra, a direct disciple of Maitripa. Tsongkhapastates,The mahasiddha Maitripa's direct disciple, the pandit Sahajavajra, explains thatin the scriptures of the Shravakas we see a discussion of \"emptiness withcharacteristics,\" as is popular with the Sautrantika school of [Indian Buddhist]thought; and \"emptiness without characteristics,\" as is popular with theVaibashika school. Moreover, he continues, in the [Mahayana schools such as] theYogachara, we see a discussion of emptiness having \"true and falsecharacteristics,\" and in the Yogachara Madhyamaka school the doctrine of\"conventionally true characteristics and conventionally false characteristics.\"...One should rely upon the approach to emptiness elucidated by the greatMadhyamaka masters Arya Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Chandrakirti, and so forth, whoteach that the interdependent, co-existent nature of phenomena points to thesuchness of being. We should adopt the guidelines set forth by these threemasters.This passage demonstrates unquestionably that Maitripa, under whom Marpaachieved his realization of Mahamudra, was a master in the Prasangika Madhyamakalineage.Tsongkhapa then again quotes [Maitripa's] Ten Reflections on Simple Suchness,[../Images/page0056_0000.svg]Maitripa's point here is that most Madhyamaka teachers are not adorned with theoral tradition teachings from Chandrakirti and therefore are but mediocreproponents of the Middle View. By \"mediocre\" he means that they have notachieved the Prasangika understanding and rely upon less exalted lineages of theemptiness doctrine, such as those of the various Svatantrika schools.The Prasangika understanding of emptiness, as re-expressed in the Mahamudrateachings of Marpa, provides the most excellent platform from which the tantricyogas, such as inner heat yoga, energy control and so forth, can beaccomplished.In Tsongkhapa's time, however, most Tibetan schools had lost the philosophicalsubtlety of the emptiness doctrine as taught by Chandrakirti and Maitripa. Manyof them took the expressions \"not true and not false\" to mean that one shouldengage in a blank-minded meditation in the pursuit of the wisdom of emptiness.To show the correct meaning of these terms Tsongkhapa quotes Nagarjuna's SixtyStanzas on Emptiness:[../Images/page0057_0000.svg]Tsongkhapa then states,One should understand the emptiness doctrine in the context of this simile. Thewise perceive that all things-persons and phenomena-arise in reliance upon theirown causes and conditions, and that based on this process we impute mentallabels upon things. The phenomena themselves have no true or inherent existencefrom their own side. They have no self-nature whatsoever.In other words, the expression \"not really true\" means that on the ultimatelevel of reality they have no final or findable existence, no inherentself-existence. The expression \"not really false\" means that on the conventionallevel of reality they nonetheless function and seem to exist. To the ordinarymind, they seem to exist and function as though being real.Next Tsongkhapa quotes Milarepa, Marpa's chief disciple, to demonstrate howMilarepa upheld this same view,[../Images/page0057_0001.svg][../Images/page0057_0002.svg][../Images/page0058_0000.svg][../Images/page0058_0001.svg]Elsewhere Milarepa states,[../Images/page0058_0002.svg][../Images/page0058_0003.svg][../Images/page0058_0004.svg]Here Milarepa is showing how the Buddha taught the conventional truth thatthings exist, to accord with the mindset and perception of ordinary beings, andthe conventional validity of relative existence. However, Buddha also taught therelationship of the two truths such that phenomena are established as valid andcapable of performing functions yet even conventionally they have no intrinsicself-nature. The ultimate truth of things is that they lack a findableself-nature. The conventional truth of things is that they exist validly, butnot in the manner in which we perceive and conceive them; rather they exist asmental imputations and labels which nonetheless perform the functions of thoseobjects. In this way the two truths co-exist as one entity.This was the understanding of emptiness held by the early Kargyu masters, and itis in complete harmony with the understanding of Chandrakirti. So let's face it:If Marpa and Milarepa, the two great early Tibetan masters of the Six Yogastradition, did not know the special features of the Mahamudra emptinessphilosophy associated with the transmission, who does? As Tsongkhapa soeloquently suggests, to take the Mahamudra doctrine beyond what Marpa andMilarepa taught is to contradict the very basis of this Kargyupa legacy.Some previous Mahamudra teachers have taught that in the practice of Mahamudrathere is no need for a balance of the two levels of truth. Here the term\"balance\" is the same as that used for the keel\"' of a boat which keeps the boatstraight and prevents it from tipping to the right or left. In the same way,just as a keel is required in order to ensure that a boat does not tip over tothe right or left, a balance is required in meditation upon the two levels oftruth in order to ensure that one does not fall into the extremes of reificationor nihilism.The treatment of the emptiness doctrine here falls under the discussion of theintroduction to the nature of the mind. Three dimensions of the mind arementioned: the coarse mind, which is constituted of the six sensoryconsciousnesses and so forth, and is easily understood; the more subtle level,which is constituted of the six primary kleshas and twenty secondary kleshas;and the most subtle, which is what is referred to in the expression \"most subtlelevel of energy and consciousness.\" This third arises when the most subtlebodily energies have been isolated from the coarse energies. This most subtleconsciousness, when placed in the vision of emptiness, renders the path mosteasily accomplished. It is the emptiness described by Nagarjuna that is theobject of meditation of that most subtle consciousness.The first of the Six Yogas is that of the inner heat yoga. Although in the innerheat yoga it is not totally inappropriate to focus exclusively upon one of thechakras, this approach is discouraged. The navel chakra is the main chakra withwhich one works, but the others are also important in the process.\"As a preliminary to the inner heat yoga one engages in various physicalexercises, or yantras. There are a wide variety of these associated with the SixYogas of Naropa, such as the set of six, the set of thirty-two, and so forth.The Pakmo Dru and Drikung sects of the Kargyu school both maintain a traditionof 108 exercises. Even though these are impressive and useful, there seems to beno great advantage in doing more than the six recommended by Pakmo Drupa [astaught in Tsongkhapa's treatise] for accomplishing the inner heat yogas.The first of the six is the vase breathing exercise. Even though all of theremaining five are done within the sphere of this breathing technique, itnonetheless is counted as one of the six. These six exercises are regarded as apreliminary to the Six Yogas, and thus are not counted as a separate yoga.In the exercise called \"showing the mudra of vajra binding, lifting upwardtoward the sky, and then pressing downward,\" the head is held face upward. Inall the others it is held downward [i.e., in the normal position]. Also, withthe exception of the exercise called \"straightening the body like an arrow andexpelling the air like a dog heaving,\" in which the air is forcefully expelledthrough the mouth, in all the exercises the breath is made to pass exclusivelythrough the nose.The exercise \"circling like a wheel\" may be done in either of two ways: with thefeet placed in front of the body and soles facing one another; or with legscrossed in the vajra posture. In either case one holds the two big toes.Similarly, the exercise that uses the mudra of vajra binding can be done withthe palms facing up on the up-stretch and then facing down on the down-stretch,or can be done with arms crossed; there are these two ways. Also, the \"heavinglike a dog\" exercise can be done in two ways: with the hands placed as in themeditation mudra, one above the other; or with them placed on the floor, as inthe position of making a full-length prostration.These exercises are followed by the meditation on the body like an empty shell.Here the body and the energy channels are to be seen as completely transparentand radiant.If one enters into the completion stage yogas [such as the Six Yogas of Naropa]without first achieving great stability in these preliminary trainings, there isthe danger that one will experience considerable physical pain as a result ofthe changing energy flows. To avoid this, one should do as many of the physicalexercises as possible, in conjunction with the meditation on the body as anempty shell. When stability in these practices is achieved, one will experiencea sense of subtle joy that pervades the body, and the possibility of painarising in the body or mind will be eliminated. When progress in the practicecomes without pain or hardship, this indicates that one is proceeding correctly.In general it is said that the Six Yogas can be practiced in any of three ways:for achieving enlightenment in this lifetime; for achieving it in the bardo; andfor achieving it over a series of lives. No matter which way is appropriate tooneself, one should begin the training now. The best practitioner will achieveenlightenment in this life; the intermediate will achieve it in the bardo; andthe least will achieve it over a series of lives.It is also said that the inner heat yoga and karmamudra yoga [i.e., sexualpractices] are oral instructions emanating from the Hevajra Tantra; the illusorybody yoga and clear light yoga are oral instructions emanating from theChakrasamvara Tantra and Guhyasamaja Tantra; and the consciousness transferenceyoga and forceful projection yoga are oral instructions emanating from the ShriChaturpita Tantra. Thus all six were originally taught by the Buddha.In earlier days the dream yogas were not emphasized in the system of the SixYogas of Naropa, and the yoga of forceful projection did not exist in the systemof the Six Yogas of Niguma. It seems that this difference is the reason formaintaining these two [i.e., the Naropa and Niguma traditions of the Six Yogas]as separate systems. Otherwise, the two are very similar.\"The elaborative nature of the force of darkness causes confusion to increase inthe minds of sentient beings. Because of the manner in which the darkness ofconfusion increases, the expression \"darkness emanation\" is used. The generationstage yogas, in which the radiant appearance of the mandala and its deities isemphasized, are therefore necessary as a preliminary to engaging in the SixYogas.The first of the six is the inner heat yoga, which is accomplished by meditationon the AH-stroke mantric syllable at the navel chakra. This yoga gives rise tothe simultaneously born bliss, which in turn then acts as a simultaneouslypresent condition for the practice of the sexual or karmamudra yogas. Thereforethe expression \"inner heat karmamudra\" is used.From within the Six Yogas, the principal methods used for accomplishingenlightenment in this lifetime are the illusory body and clear light yogas. Inthe beginning of the training the inner heat yoga, karmamudra yoga, and soforth, are utilized as methods for drawing the subtle physical energies into thecentral channel in order to induce the four blisses. These four blisses, andespecially the simultaneously born bliss, are prerequisites for practicing theillusory body and clear light yogas. This principle is common to all completionstage yoga systems.There is no single standard way of engaging in the inner heat yoga. For example,the size in which the energy channels are visualized varies in accordance withthe capacities of trainees. Similarly, the chakra used as the site at which todraw the energies into the central channel varies. However, there is less dangerof undesirable side-effects when one works with the chakra at the navel.Consequently the two side channels are generally visualized as curling into themouth of the central channel at the site of the navel chakra. It is best firstto establish control over the subtle energies at the navel chakra. Should onetry to do this at any of the three upper chakras and apply the techniquesforcefully, there is the danger that the upper energies will be disturbed andthat negative side-effects will be produced, such as intense turbulence of theheart energies, and so forth. Similar dangers are associated with working withthe secret chakra. There are numerous ways of visualizing the mantric syllablesin the practice of the inner heat, as well as of retaining the energies anddirecting the inner heat that is induced.The two most clear and concise manuals on the manner of meditating on the innerheat are those by [the Second Dalai Lama] Gyalwa Gendun Gyatso and [the FirstPanchen Lama] Panchen Chogyen.\" One should meditate in accordance with theirinstructions, for they present the tradition embodied in Tsongkhapa's A Book ofThree Inspirations in a most wonderful and practical manner.It is very important that the mantric syllables at the chakras are seen as beinginside the central channel. Many early Tibetan lamas overlooked this crucialprinciple. The smaller the syllables are visualized, the more easy it becomes todraw the energies into the central channel. The syllables should be seen asblazing with light, as this will eliminate the danger of mental dullnessobstructing the meditation.Of the five fundamental energies that are to be drawn into the central channelat the navel chakra, it is said that the all-pervading energy generally does notflow. The upward-rising and downwardexpelling energies respectively have thenature of fire and water, and flow forcefully to the right and left. Thelife-sustaining and equalizing energies flow simultaneously and are of equalstrength.The vase breathing technique is used in the process of bringing these energiesinto the navel chakra. Generally one first draws in the airs from above, andthen draws them up from below. An exception occurs after the energies haveentered into the navel chakra and dissolved. At that time the lower energies aredrawn in first. The vase breathing exercise is also said to be a supreme methodfor increasing health and longevity. It is best to practice it at the navelchakra. To do so at the heart or throat chakras is dangerous.Tsongkhapa quotes a verse from The Arising of Samvara Tantra,[../Images/page0062_0000.svg]Here the expression \"kiss\" refers to the vital energies being dissolved into thenada above the mantric AH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra.Accomplishment in the inner heat yoga brings about great spiritual power. Oncewhen the yogi Paljor Rabten was drinking beer I asked him, \"0 great mahasiddha,what are you meditating upon?\"He replied, \"On the AH-stroke mantra of the Six Yogas of Naropa.\"I asked him, \"And what benefits have you gotten out of it?\"\"I achieved limitless, immeasurable realizations,\" he replied. \"When I was inretreat on the Six Yogas at Lodrak Drowolung I received many visions of the fivebuddhas as well as many bodhisattvas. Then when I made retreat on the energypractices and inner heat yogas at Samyey Chimpu I received visions of thebuddhas of the ten directions, and many more.\"I once asked another yogi friend what he was meditating upon.He replied, \"On the inner heat yoga.\"\"Well then, you must be able to levitate,\" I said.\"I haven't dedicated myself to the meditation for doing that; but if I were todo so, no doubt I could,\" he replied. In fact, it was well known that he hadachieved the power of levitation and flight.Although I did not test the validity of their claims, meditating on the innerheat yogas definitely does bring about such experiences and abilities. Forexample, the yogi Milarepa was seen levitating through the air on numerousoccasions.On another occasion I met a seventy-year-old hermit at Palkor Chodey Monastery.I asked him, \"0 mahasiddha, what are you doing?\"He replied honestly, \"If one takes up meditation early in life, there is nodoubt that great realization can be achieved. But what can you expect from anold man like me? I am a disciple of Jetsun Lobzang Yeshey of Tashi LhunpoMonastery. But I broke my vows and now live here in retreat.\"His point was well taken. It is important to take up practice before old age hasweakened one's body and mind, and also important to keep whatever spiritualprecepts one has taken. Then realization is easily accomplished.By means of the inner heat yoga the vital energies are drawn into the centralchannel. As said earlier, this technique is based on the oral instructionsemanating from the Hevajra Tantra. What then follows is similar to the processas described in the \"five stages\" of the Guhyasamaja Tantra system, and the\"four yogas\" of the Vajrabhairava Tantra system. The knots constricting thechakra at the heart are loosened, and when they are released the illusory bodyis achieved. Thus the inner heat yoga is a method for facilitating practice ofthe illusory body.The instructions on the illusory body and clear light yogas are presented withgreat clarity in Lama Marpa's oral tradition of the Guhyasamaja text known asElucidation of the Summary of the Five Stages. These instructions are clearlyexplained in Tsongkhapa's works A Clear Lamp on the Five Stages and The CompleteSeat.However, even though the illusory body and clear light yogas as presented in theSix Yogas tradition are based on the Heruka Chakrasamvara Tantra andGuhyasaniaja Tantra, the way in which they have been taught by earlier Tibetanlineage masters is mainly designed for beginners in tantric practice. Theircentral purpose is to establish karmic instincts for the real trainings.These early lineage masters taught the illusory body training under threetopics: the illusory nature of appearances; the illusory nature of dreams; andthe illusory nature of the bardo experience.Lama Tsongkhapa does not reject these practices as taught by the early lineagemasters. However, he does point out in A Book of Three Inspirations that thetechniques taught in the illusory body training, such as those classified as\"seeing all that appears as an illusion\" and \"realizing dream illusions\" areessentially for beginners, and only have the function of laying the karmic seedsfor the real practice of the illusory body yoga. They suffice as meditations forbeginners, but are not what he considers to be the actual illusory bodytrainings.Seeing all that appears as an illusion involves two levels of trainings:unpurified, in which one meditates on the dream-like, illusory nature of theobjects of experience; and purified, in which the illusory appearances arecaused to arise as the mandala and its deities. In the second of these the mainpractice is conducted in a room with a window in each wall. One opens all thewindows and arranges a mirror in front of a Vajrasattva image. One then places abowl of water on the floor between the two, and arranges the mirror so that itprojects the image of Vajrasattva into the bowl of water. One then contemplatesthis image, and just as in the generation stage practice, meditates that onearises as the mandala deity and that the image reflected in the water is theimage of oneself as the deity. It is said that this practice was taught by bothMarpa Lotsawa and Goe Lotsawa. One then blends this with the illusory naturemeditations.In the dream yoga section of A Book of Three Inspirations Tsongkhapa refers to atantric scripture known as The Advaya Vijaya Tantra, which states that one mayvisualize the five mantric syllables OM AH NU TA RA standing at the throatchakra on a four-petalled lotus, with OM in the center and the remaining foursyllables on the four petals. Alternatively, one may simply use a solitarysyllable, either OM or AH, at the center, and dispense with the remaining four.The scripture comments that using the four extra syllables does not bring anyadded power to the practice.Many Tibetan scholars question the authenticity of the above scripture. However,if it is inauthentic then the instruction is likewise inauthentic. There arenumerous other sources for the dream yoga instruction, but this text is quiteimportant. It would seem that if Tsongkhapa had confidence in it, it probably isreliable. Moreover, no solid logic for rejecting it has been forthcoming.Tsongkhapa regards The Five Stages and The Four Seats as the most importantsources of the dream yoga teaching.The dream yoga should be practiced in a solitary place. If one is unable toaccomplish lucid dreaming at night, then one should attempt the practice betweenearly dawn and sunrise. This will encourage especially clear dreams. As dreamsare linked to the throat chakra, this is the chakra most commonly used in thetraining.Should one find one's sleep to be too light, or if one repeatedly awakens, oneshould meditate on the mantric syllable [or syllables] as being less bright.When sleep is too heavy and as a result one cannot notice or clearly rememberone's dreams, one should apply the methods called \"cutting the obstacle ofheaviness.\" Should sleep come but no dreams occur, one should apply the methodscalled \"cutting the obstacle of nothingness.\" If sleep comes but one quicklyawakens from it, one should apply the methods called \"cutting the obstacle ofawakening.\" These terms were used by the lineage masters of old. Tsongkhapaaccepts them without reinterpretation or adaptation.It is said that the inner heat yoga is the foundation stone of all Six Yogas.Thus it is also the foundation stone of dream yoga. Through the inner heat yogaone gains control over the vital energies of the body; one then applies thiscontrol when going to sleep in order to conduct the dream yoga practice. Dreamyoga can also be engaged through the force of conscious resolution, yet this isnot the primary method. The primary method is energy control born from the innerheat yoga. Conscious resolution is only intended as a supplement.After stability in the practice of lucid dreaming has been established one takesup the dream practice known as \"the illusory dream deeds.\" These are of twotypes: worldly and para-worldly. Both involve projecting one's dream body tospecial realms from within the dream state. The difference between the two isthe purity of the realms to which one projects oneself. The latter refers toprojecting oneself to the buddhafields, such as Sukhavati and so forth.By engaging in the technique of illusory dream deeds one projects oneself in thedream state to a buddhafield and meditates there. But is this a reliableexperience? Can one really project oneself to a buddhafield?If the technique is applied by means of energy control, and one has loosened theknots constricting the chakras to the point that the illusory body has almostbeen attained, then the experience is valid. For example, Lama Wonton Kyergangwaprojected himself into the presence of Guru Padma Sambhava and received directteachings on the Hayagriva Tantra. Nonetheless such instances are rare and theirvalidity is difficult to ascertain.With dream experiences that arise as a result of the technique being appliedthrough energy control, it seems that sometimes they are clear and sometimesnot, sometimes valid and sometimes not. When the method is conscious resolution,they usually are not valid. There are, however, methods for enhancing theirreliability.The first step in dream yoga is to learn to retain conscious presence duringdreams. Later one meditates on the suchness of dreams. However, merelyrecognizing that the horses, elephants and so forth that are seen in dreams areillusions will not give rise to the wisdom of emptiness, in the same way thatrealizing something to be an illusion in the waking state, such as one'sreflection in a mirror, does not give rise to realization of emptiness. One mustcombine the technique of dream yoga with the instructions on the methods ofascertaining the meaning of emptiness.The third level of the illusory body yoga is the training in the illusory natureof the bardo.Milarepa speaks of three bardos: the bardo of life, which occurs [in the wakingstate] between birth and death; the dream bardo, which occurs between going tosleep and waking up; and the bardo of becoming, which refers to the time betweendeath and rebirth. Tsongkhapa explains these three concepts in depth in A Bookof Three Inspirations.The expression \"blending desire with the non-contaminated\" is used. Here\"desire\" refers to great bliss and \"non-contaminated\" refers to the wisdom ofemptiness. One blends the wisdom of emptiness with the great bliss generatedthrough bringing the energies into the central channel and then directing thedrop through the chakras.It is said that there is no bardo for those entering into the highest worldlyrealms, nor for those who have created any of the five most terrible karmicdeeds. Those two types of beings take rebirth immediately after death, withoutexperiencing the bardo.As the death process sets in, a series of outer and inner signs occurs. Theouter signs, such as losing control over bodily strength and so forth, can bewitnessed by others. The inner signs, such as the visions of a mirage, smoke andso forth, can only be experienced by oneself. Eventually the inner sign of theclear light of death arises. This is the final stage, after which consciousnessexits the body.[The Second Dalai Lama's guru] Khedrup Norzang Gyatso stated,When the appearance of the clear light of death arises, the mind of dualityrelaxes and the mind of utter simplicity, as unfabricated as space, arises. Thisis the actual mind of the wisdom of emptiness, yet untrained beings will notrecognize it as such. For the practitioner trained in the tantric yogas, thisclear light of death becomes the experience of the mind experiencing emptiness.However, if one has not previously achieved realization of emptiness, there willbe no realization now.Thus Khedrup Norzang Gyatso refers to this consciousness of the clear light ofdeath as \"a consciousness which appears but is unrecognized by the experiencer.\"Even though his view here does not accord with that of Lama Jey Tsongkhapa, itis worth considering. He makes this statement in his commentary to thecompletion stage yogas of the Guhyasamaja system. I have not seen it saidelsewhere.An important element in the bardo practice is the wisdom of bliss and emptiness.For this, the bliss that is induced through bringing the vital energies into thecentral channel and directing the drop through the chakras is the \"bliss\" beingreferred to.One lies in the \"sleeping lion\" posture, with one's head to the north and backto the east, and mind focused on the mantric syllable unmistakenly inside thecentral channel. One observes the natural dissolution of the elemental energiesduring the dying process, and the visions such as the mirage, smoke, and soforth. When the clear light of death appears one concentrates on it andsimultaneously applies the techniques for ascertaining the wisdom of emptiness.However, if one has not previously achieved meditative samadhi, it will bedifficult to recognize the clear light of death.It is important to critically examine the teachings of Lama Tsongkhapa in orderto plant the instincts of realization. In particular, three of his tantricworks-A Book of Three Inspirations, A Clear Lamp on the Five Stages, and TheComplete Seat-should be studied in conjunction with one another. Then aninconceivable understanding is produced. This is especially important in gainingprofound appreciation of the illusory body and clear light doctrines.The final two doctrines in the Six Yogas system, both of which are classified asbranches of the path, are those of consciousness transference to a higher realmand forceful projection of one's consciousness from its present residence intothe residence of another body. Both of these are forms of consciousnesstransference. The first is ordinary and the second is extraordinary. The formercan be accomplished simply by means of firm conscious resolution; the latter canonly be accomplished by means of the power induced through directing the subtlephysical energies into the central channel.The purpose of the yogas of consciousness transference and forceful projectionis that some practitioners may apply themselves to the Six Yogas but still notaccomplish enlightenment in this lifetime. They then utilize one of these twoyogas at the time of death.To apply either of these techniques prematurely is equivalent to suicide. As oneis a tantric practitioner, and thus one's body is the residence of hundreds oftantric deities, it is equivalent to killing hundreds of tantric deities.Tsongkhapa states that this breaks the eighth tantric precept. However, KhedrupNorzang Gyatso questions him on this in his text A Clear Lamp on the Precepts,pointing out that, by the time the transference or forceful projection has beencompleted, the basis of that karma has already gone.[The Second Dalai Lama's guru] Khedrup Norzang Gyatso questions Tsongkhapa'steachings on numerous points in this way. Langdol Lama criticizes Norzang Gyatsofor this, saying that as he [Norzang] is a follower of Tsongkhapa it is notappropriate. Norzang Gyatso accepted Tsongkhapa's doctrines in general, butraised questions on many subtle points of doctrine.As with the other doctrines, in the practice of consciousness transference thebest application is that of using the inner heat yoga to bring the vitalenergies into the central channel and give rise to the great bliss andsimultaneously born wisdom.A number of mandala deities can be used as the basis of the transference yoga.Tsongkhapa's A Commentary on Consciousness Transference Yoga recommends thethirteen-deity mandala of Jnana Dakini. This system does not use the AH-HIKmantra at the time of training, as is done in the Six Yogas system. The AH-HIKis only used at the time of actual application of the yoga [i.e., at the time ofdeath]. My own guru Drakkar Kachu Rinpochey taught that the AH-HIK is invokedbecause the AH-stroke mantric syllable at the lower region of the centralchannel must be made to move upward and strike against the KSHA syllable thatblocks the upper aperture, thus removing it.In the system of consciousness transference based on Buddha Amitabha, aspracticed by Lubum Ritropa Lobzang Dondrub,'4 a master of the ten instructions,the AH-HIK syllable is used at the time of practice as well as at the time ofactual application. Thus it seems to be the same as is taught in the Six Yogas.According to Kyabgon Dorjey Chang,\" although the Buddha Amitabha system ofconsciousness transference essentially belongs to the kriya division of tantricpractice, it is conjoined with the oral tradition teachings of highest yogatantra. Essentially it is a method for transference of consciousness to a higherrealm.In general, if one has complete control over the movement of the vital energies,there is no need to visualize mantric syllables in order to block the gatewaysof the senses when the transference yogas are engaged. Otherwise, one should usethem. [Tsongkhapa's] A Commentary on Consciousness Transference Yoga explainsthat there are a number of ways of utilizing [i.e., visualizing] the mantricsyllables, as well as various mantras to be used. Panchen Tamchey Khyenpa''taught that simply placing a syllable HUM at the nine gateways is sufficient.Another tradition recommends that we use two syllables of HUM, with an AHsyllable between the U-vowel [of the pair of HUM syllables]. Tsongkhapa does notmention this technique.The second form of transference, that known as drong-jug, or \"forcefulprojection to a new residence,\" involves one of two techniques: projecting one'sconsciousness out of one's body and into that of a corpse; or, alternatively,evacuating one's body and projecting the consciousness of someone else into it.Here the word \"residence\" is used because the body is the residence of thesenses. The source of the term is the Prajnaparamita literature. In particular,it comes from the passage in the Prajnaparaniita Sutra in 100,000 Verses thatbegins with the lines,[../Images/page0069_0000.svg]If one is to master the yogas of consciousness transference and forcefulprojection as taught exclusively in the tantric scriptures, one should begin bytraining in the General Mahayana meditations, taking the tantric empowerments,guarding the disciplines and precepts, cultivating stability in the generationstage yogas, and then, by means of the inner heat yogas, gaining the ability tobring the vital energies into the central channel. The prerequisites demandedfor successful practice of forceful projection to a new residence are even moreintense than those for mere transference to a higher realm.In the forceful projection training one takes a human skull cup and places it ona platform marked with the design of a mandala. The skull can be placed like acup, and a mantric syllable HUM written inside of it with do-gyu (Tib. rdorg>yu) stone, or else the skull can be reversed and the HUM written on top. Onethen engages in the training as instructed.Before attempting to do the actual application it is important to test oneselfto be sure that one is ready. To do this one takes the corpse of an animal andengages the technique with it as the object. If it warms up, this is a sign thatone is ready for the real application. One then gets a fresh human corpse, suchas that of a young child that has been left for dead in a charnel ground. Theprojection is best accomplished by someone who has complete mastery over thevital energies; however, lesser practitioners who have accomplished thegeneration stage yogas can also accomplish it.There is a tradition of vacating one's own body in order to offer it as aresidence to someone else. However, Tsongkhapa only mentions this application,but doesn't describe it. That technique is similar to the method ofconsciousness transference.Finally, the tradition of the Six Yogas of Naropa speaks of special activitiesand enhancement techniques for propelling one through transitional stages of thepath. There are those of the generation stage associated with the accomplishmentof the eight siddhis, or magical abilities, and the accomplishment of vastenlightenment deeds. Then on the completion stage there are the three types ofspecial activities known as \"with embellishment,\" \"without embellishment,\" and\"utterly without embellishment.\" There are also the special activitiesassociated with the five ordinary paths. By relying upon these, one eventuallyis transported to the enlightenment state known as yi ganaddha, or completeintegration.The textual source of the Six Yogas tradition is the twofold collection known asThe Two Kargyupa Scriptures. There is also a \"treasure text\" (Tib. gter nasbton) source, but Tsongkhapa writes that he has no confidence in it whatsoever.This is the only occasion in Lama Tsongkhapa's writings in which he directlycriticizes the [Nyingma/ Bon] treasure text tradition; I have not seen him do soelsewhere.The two disciples who requested Tsongkhapa to write on the Six Yogas of Naropawere Miwang Drakpa Gyaltsen, who was the main sponsor of the Monlam ChenmoFestival, and his younger brother Sonam Gyaltsen.In a concluding verse of A Book of Three Inspirations Tsongkhapa writes asfollows concerning his purpose in composing his text,[../Images/page0071_0000.svg]These are probably the three \"inspirations\" referred to in the title.Lama Jey Tsongkhapa's writings on the Six Yogas of Naropa are inconceivablyprofound guides to the practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa. Even if one searchesthroughout the three worlds of existence, one would find it difficult todiscover a teaching equal to them.We should exert ourselves in the study and practice of these teachings in orderto take the essence of the opportunities and endowments afforded by our humanlife and thus accomplish enlightenment, that we may fulfill the aspirations ofourselves and others.The colophon: Notes from a public reading of Jey Tsongkhapa's A Book of ThreeInspirations given in the fourth month of the Fire Tiger Year at the request ofHalha Zhab-drung.[../Images/img0004.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"HANDPRINTS OF THE PROFOUND PATH OF THE SIX YOGAS OF NAROPA: A SOURCE OF EVERYREALIZATIONTib.

Famous for his many years of meditation retreat in the OlkhaMountains, where Lama Tsongkhapa also spent five years in retreat, he iscelebrated as one of the most eccentric of the Gelukpa monks to have achievedenlightenment in one lifetime. Unlike most Tibetan monks, who by tradition arehumble and selfdeprecating in expression, he was wild and arrogant, and used tosay, \"In the old days there was the great yogi Milarepa to represent thetradition of the mahasiddhas. Today there is just me.\"He is also said to be one of the most important \"pre-incarnations\" of thelineage of Panchen Lamas. The First Panchen Lama (1568-1662), whose treatment ofthe Six Yogas is translated in Chapter Six, was his immediate reincarnation.Gyalwa Wensapa is not officially called one of the Panchens (because the title\"Panchen Lama\" was first given to Panchen Chokyi Gyaltsen by the Fifth DalaiLama in the mid-1600s), but is always mentioned as a Panchen pre-incarnate.'Gyalwa Wensapa's text on the Six Yogas does not deal with each of the six yogasindividually, but instead looks at the underlying pillar on which the mansion ofthe Six Yogas is based, namely the tradition known in Tibetan as sewn suns (Tib.Bred-ba-gsum), or \"the three blendings.\"There are many different ways to talk about these \"three blendings.\"Tsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations runs through several of these anddismisses many of them as meaningless distortions created by later Tibetanlamas. He then settles on what he considers to be the true doctrine astransmitted through Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa and Milarepa. As we will see inChapter Five, his A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas also dedicates a section tothe topic of the three blendings, the section being entitled \"The Illusory Bodyand Clear Light Yogas.\"Here he takes the three occasions for yogic practice-the waking state, the sleep/dream state, and the bardo state that follows deathand points out that theessence of the Six Yogas is to bring the three kayas-Dharmakaya, Sambhogakayaand Nirmanakaya-into each of the three states. Thus in fact there potentiallyare nine \"blendings\" to be accomplished, three for each of these three states.In the Six Yogas tradition these three states-waking consciousness, sleep/dreamconsciousness, and after-death consciousness-are also known as the three bardos.Lama Tsongkhapa explains this in A Book of Three Inspirations,In this tradition [i.e., that of the Six Yogas of Naropa] we see three \"bardostates\" being mentioned. Firstly there is \"the bardo between birth and death,\"which refers to the [waking-state] period from our birth to our death, includingthe present moment. Secondly there is \"the dream bardo,\" which is the periodbetween the moment of going to sleep and the moment of waking. Thirdly, the timefrom death until rebirth is known as \"the bardo realm,\" or \"the bardo ofbecoming.\"The three blendings can be accomplished in any of these three bardos. AsTsongkhapa states in A Book of Three Inspirations, the most important of thethree is the waking state bardo, for it is during the waking state that theaverage practitioner can most easily succeed in the tantric yogas, or at leastlay the foundations of success. Once basic competency in the practice has beenestablished in the waking state, one can apply the three blendings to the stateof sleep and dreams. Finally, if one does not achieve full enlightenment duringone's lifetime, either in the waking state or in the sleep/dream state, then onecan apply the three blendings at the time of death and achieve enlightenment inthe bardo.Tsongkhapa writes in A Book of Three Inspirations,Those beings who do not possess yogic abilities will experience the three bardosas ordinary.... However, yogis holding the oral tradition teachings know how totake the three kayas at the time of the path [i.e., the ordinary dimensions ofthe three] and transform them into the three kayas at the time of the result[i.e., into buddhahood].In Tibetan the tantric path is sometimes called trebu-lam (Tib. 'byes bu'i lam),or \"the resultant path,\" in order to convey the sense that for rapidenlightenment we can borrow an element of resultant enlightenment, bring it intothe here-and-now of our unenlightened experience, and thus cause tremendousinner transformation. The idea is that we are never far away from enlightenment;we always have the ultimate and conventional realities at hand and thepotentialities of the three kayas, but we just do not access them effectively.Of the three kayas, the Dharmakaya is linked to our mind, Sambhogakaya to ourspeech, or communicative principle, and the Nirmanakaya to our ordinary body.The process of the three blendings in brief is as follows.We experience the clear light of the waking state naturally during sexualorgasm, and it can also be induced with yogic methods. Moreover, we naturallyexperience it at the moment of going to sleep, and at the moment of death. Theprinciple here is that this clear light mind as experienced in each of the threeoccasions (waking, sleep and death) is the highest experience of ourconsciousness, and in it we dwell in a mental state of blissful, formlessnon-duality similar to that of the Dharmakaya wisdom of a buddha. Thus when weexperience the clear light mind in any of these three occasions we should blendit with the Dharmakaya.The first movement from this clear light mind is likened to the Sambhogakayaexperience. In the waking state this occurs in our meditation when we fall outof the clear light that is induced with yogic techniques and the conceptual mindis aroused. In sleep it occurs after the clear light of the moment of enteringsleep passes and we begin to dream. At death it occurs when the clear lightflash at the moment of death passes and we leave our body and enter the bardorealm.A buddha's Sambhogakaya is only visible to an arya, or saint, and not to anordinary being; in the same way our thoughts, dreams, and bardo visions are notvisible to ordinary beings but nonetheless are experiences of form. These subtleform experiences are to be linked to the natural realization of the illusory,blissful, and perfect nature of being; they are to be seen as an illusorytheater made manifest for the benefit of the world. In other words, they are tobe blended with the Sambhogakaya. This is the second set of three blendings.The third blending is that of blending rebirth with the Nirmanakaya. Rebirthfrom the bardo of the waking state occurs every time that we arise from ameditation session and once more go about our ordinary life; rebirth from thebardo of the sleep/dream state occurs when we wake up and once more enter thework-a-day world; and rebirth from the bardo of becoming, or death bardo, occurswhen we complete the unwinding process of the afterlife state and once again areready to enter into a new body.The basic principle underlying these three blendings is that what occurs to usat the time of death also occurs to us in miniature form at the time of going tosleep and can be induced in the waking state by means of the inner heat yogas.For this reason it will be useful to explain how the yogic tradition speaks ofthe death experience. Tsongkhapa provides us with a brief description of thisprocess in A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas,[At the time of death certain] external and internal signs of the energydissolutions occur. First the earth element dissolves into the water element.The external sign is that one loses the ability to move one's limbs or controlthe body and has an appearance of total relaxation. There is a sensation asthough one's body were sinking into the earth. The inner sign is a vision havinga miragelike quality. Next the water element dissolves into the fire element.The external sign is dryness of mouth and nose, and a shrivelling of the tongue.The inner sign is a vision as though of smoke. The fire element now dissolvesinto the air element. The external sign is that one's body heat begins to drop,withdrawing from the extremities [toward the heart]. The inner sign is a visionlike that of seeing sparks, or of seeing a cluster of fireflies.Next the air element of conceptual thought dissolves into mind. Here the vitalenergies that support conceptual thought dissolve into consciousness. Theexternal sign is that a long breath is exhaled, and the body seems unable toinhale. Even if one can inhale, one does so shallowly yet heavily. The innersign is a vision of a light resembling that of a butterlamp undisturbed by windmovement.After this the first emptiness occurs, known simply as \"emptiness.\" This is theexperience of the vision known as \"appearance.\" The inner sign is of whiteness,like seeing moonlight in a cloudless sky. The consciousness of \"appearance\" thendissolves into the second emptiness, known as \"very empty.\" This is theexperience of the vision known as \"proximity.\" The inner vision is of ayellowish red light, like that of the light at sunrise. This dissolves into thethird emptiness, \"the great emptiness,\" which is linked to the experience of thevision known as \"proximate attainment.\" The inner vision is of utter darkness,like that of a night sky pervaded by thick darkness. The person has a sensationof swooning and loses consciousness. After this the person emerges from thedarkness and the state of mindlessness and arises into the experience of \"utteremptiness,\" also termed \"the clear light.\" The vision is of a color like theblending of the lights of sun and moon in a sky free from all darkness, like theclear sky at early dawn. This is the clear light that is the actual basis.Sometimes we see it said that after the four elements have dissolved, thedissolutions of the conceptual mind are accompanied by the movement of thesubtle drops of the body. First the white, male drop moves from the crown to theheart chakra, giving rise to an inner sign of a white light, called \"the mind ofappearance.\" Next the red, female drop moves up from the navel chakra to theheart, giving rise to a vision of a red light and \"the mind of proximity.\" Inthe third phase the two drops collapse together at the heart, giving rise to avision of an utterly dark light and \"the mind of proximate attainment.\" Finallythe two drops temporarily stabilize at the heart, giving rise to a vision ofclear light and the experience called \"the mind of clear light.\"Ordinary people can stay in this clear light consciousness for a mere fractionof a second before their karmic instincts and psychological restlessness pullthem away from it. The yogi learns to remain in it for a prolonged period oftime, and to \"blend the Dharmakaya\" with it.ENERGY DISSOLUTIONS AT THE TIME OF DEATHFour Elemental Dissolutions[../Images/page0078_0000.svg]Four \"Emptiness\" Dissolutions[../Images/page0078_0001.svg]We will see this sequence of four elemental dissolutions and four emptinessvisions repeated several times in Gyalwa Wensapa's commentary to the Six Yogas,for the yogi or yogini trains to induce this death experience by means of his orher meditations and utilizes it in each of the stages of realizationalexperience generated in dependence on the Six Yogas.In the Six Yogas system the elemental dissolutions are fabricated by means ofwithdrawing the subtle energies (called \"airs\" or \"winds\") away from their usualsites in the body and directing them into the central channel of the subtlevajra body, just as occurs at the time of death. As Gyalwa Wensapa puts it,The sign indicating that they have been caused to abide is that the visions ofthe elemental dissolutions and also the dissolution of the three visionarystates occur. These dissolutions must be individually recognized.Gyalwa Wensapa divides his treatise into two major sections: the techniques fordrawing the energies into the central channel, and the techniques to be appliedonce this has been accomplished. In other words, the first stage of the SixYogas is concerned with inducing this \"death experience,\" and the second stageis concerned with what is to be accomplished from within the environment of thebeyond-death state, when the bodily energies have been withdrawn and broughtinto the central channel.The thrust of the dynamic of practicing in \"the three bardos\" is that in orderto succeed in the yogic methods of working with the clear light of sleep anddeath (i.e., the clear light of the second two bardos), one must first succeedin the yogas of the waking state (i.e., the first of the three bardos). In APractice Manual on the Six Yogas Tsongkhapa quotes Milarepa on this point,Jetsun Milarepa stated, \"The clear light of death is Dharmakaya; one only mustrecognize it as such. In order to be able to do so, one should be introduced toit now by a supreme holy master. Cultivate an understanding of the essence ofthe view of the way things are, and train in the symbolic clear light of thepath.\"Also in A Book of Three Inspirations Tsongkhapa writes,The meditations on the three clear light consciousnesses-the clear lightexperienced through yogic endeavor in the waking state, the clear light ofsleep, and the clear light of the moment of deathare similar in that success inall three applications depends upon first understanding the process ofdissolving the vital energies and consciousnesses into the central channel...and how thus to induce the experience of the four emptinesses and four blisses.Because the ability to dissolve the subtle energies into the central channel andthus induce the state of the clear light consciousness is accomplished by meansof the inner heat yoga, the inner heat practice is called \"the foundation stoneof the path of the Six Yogas.\"The Dharmakaya is a buddha's formless nature, and with us it is linked to theclear light consciousness, in which there is no sense of duality ormultiplicity. In The Guhyasamaja Tantra a parallel is drawn with our experienceat the moment of sexual orgasm, wherein we experience only bliss, radiance and asense of oneness with the world. These three mental qualities are brieflypresent at the time of ordinary sexual orgasm, and also are induced with yogicmethods in the orgasmic bliss produced by the inner heat yoga. This state ofmind provides the perfect environment for bringing a buddha's Dharmakaya realityinto the continuum of our own experience.Sometimes the term \"inner heat karmamudra\" is used, because many practitionersrely upon a karmamudra, or sexual partner, in order to induce the desiredexperience. Here the inner heat yoga is called \"the inner condition\" and thekarmamudra sexual practice is called \"the outer condition.\" The two arepracticed in conjunction with one another in order to harness the natural energyprocess of the sexual experience to the yogic methods for energy control.In other words, the parallel between sexual orgasm and the bliss required tosucceed in the inner heat yoga means that the advanced stages of the inner heatyoga are often best practiced while in sexual union. This is done in order toinduce the \"four blisses\" or \"four joys\" that we see mentioned in most texts onthe Six Yogas. The idea is that after the energies are brought into the centralchannel one draws the drops through the four (or five) chakras; as they movefrom chakra to chakra they give rise to an according experience of bliss. Thisbliss is like that of sexual orgasm, with the exception that it is sustained forlong periods of time. The most important of these four blisses is the fourth,which is known as \"the innate bliss.\" It is this bliss that is most closely akinto the Dharmakaya experience, and in which \"the blending with Dharmakaya\" is tobe accomplished. In the Six Yogas system this is also known as \"meditating onthe innate wisdom.\"Gyalwa Wensapa recommends that we take up the karmamudra practice at fivespecific stages in the training of the Six Yogas. Tsongkhapa describes thetechnique of controlling the sexual drops in A Practice Mannal on the Six Yogas,although he does not distinguish between when this is accomplished by means ofsolo practice and when with a sexual partner, because in any case the principleis the same.Here in the waking state one applies the inner heat yoga in order to draw theenergies into the central channel and give rise to an experience of clear lightresembling that at the moments of sleep and death. The clear light consciousnessthat is aroused by means of the yoga is to be retained and \"blended with theDharmakaya.\" This is the waking state practice.When going to sleep one observes the natural process of the elementaldissolutions and enhances the experience by means of yogic application. Thepreparation is the waking-state practice of becoming familiar with the energytransformations that lead up to the experience. As soon as the elementalenergies have withdrawn and the four emptiness experiences begin naturally tooccur, one watches for the arisal of the clear light consciousness of sleep andblends it with the Dharmakaya.Similarly, at death one allows the energy withdrawals to occur naturally, andwhen the clear light arises one applies the techniques of retaining it. One thenblends the Dharmakaya with it. Working in this way with these three-i.e.,blending with the clear lights of the waking state (induced by yogic methods),sleep state, and death stateis known as \"blending Dharmakaya with the clearlight of the three occasions.\"Again, all three of the Dharmakaya blendings depend on having first achievedsuccess in the waking-state practice of the inner heat yoga.Beginners in the practice will only be able to bathe in the clear lightDharmakaya for a few moments. Then the instincts carried by the ordinary mindwill begin to make themselves felt, and they will drift into thoughts. This iswhen the \"waking state bardo\" is to be \"blended with the Sambhogakaya.\"Similarly, novice practitioners will not be able to stabilize the clear light ofsleep for long; karmic instincts, memories, habits, bodily energies, and soforth will begin to make themselves felt, and they will drift off into dreams.Here the \"bardo of dreams\" is to be blended with the Sambhogakaya. In the sameway, in the death experience the clear light of death soon gives way to formaspects, such as memories and karmic predispositions, and one falls from theclear light of death into a hallucinated bardo, or after-death experience; thisafter-death bardo is to be blended with the Sambhogakaya at that time.Here the term \"Sambhogakaya\" refers to the higher of a buddha's two formaspects, the other being the Nirmanakaya, or coarse form.The third blending involves bringing the \"rebirthing\" experience of the threeoccasions into the Nirmanakaya perspective. For example, in the waking state, atthe completion of our yogic session we arise from meditation and return to theordinary world; this experience is to be blended with the illusory emanationbody, or manner in which a buddha sends countless emanations out into the worldin order to benefit others. After sleep and dreams we wake up and go about oureveryday life; again, this is to be blended with the idea of Nirmanakaya andconscious emanation. Third, after death and the bardo we may have to takerebirth; this is to be done as a conscious yogic application of emanation.All six yogas of the Naropa system are based on the principles of these threeblendings. These three are what transform the yogas from mere calisthenics intoenlightenment techniques.The section of Tsongkhapa's A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas introducing theillusory body and clear light doctrines explains the process of the threeblendings with wonderful lucidity (see pages 118-123 below). As he explained inA Book of Three Inspirations, Tsongkhapa felt that the Tibetans had tamperedwith this doctrine of the three blendings and brought to it various meaningsthat have nothing to do with the original teachings of Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa andMilarepa. For example, he felt that the popularly taught doctrine of blendingthe three delusions-lust, aversion and confusion-with the three kayas lacks anysense whatsoever. Although these three kleshas are incorporated into the tantricpath of the Six Yogas of Naropa, he does not agree that the popular presentationof the technique is relevant to the discussion of the three blendings; on thecontrary, to bring them in not only is superficial and arbitrary, but alsomistakes the gist of the process.'Another noteworthy feature of Gyalwa Wensapa's text is that he links the processof the attainment of enlightenment to the levels of realization as expressed inthe tantric terminology of the Guhyasamaja Tantra. That is to say, the tantricyogas transport the practitioner through the successive stages of bodyisolation, speech isolation, unpurified illusory body, semblant clear light,ultimate clear light, and then purified illusory body. The process culminates inthe attainment of \"the great union still in training,\" and finally \"the greatunion beyond training,\" which is complete enlightenment. He then reverses hisdiscussion and goes step-by-step from the highest stage of realization, or thefull enlightenment that is beyond training, back to the basic levels ofpractice, to illustrate how enlightenment as taught in the tantras is agraduated path, and that one proceeds successively from initial beginnings tothe highest attainment.His treatment of \"the three blendings\" is brilliant, and I have not foundanything in Tibetan literature to compare with it for sheer simplicity andprofundity."},{"pageContent":"HANDPRINTS OF THE PROFOUND PATH OF THE SIX YOGAS OF NAROPA: A SOURCE OF EVERYREALIZATIONby Gyalwa Wensapa Lobzang DondrupHomage to Guru Vajradhara, together with the myriad of mandala deities.'To engage in the practice of Naropa's Six Yogas one must understand threesubjects: the reality of the basis; the stages of traversing the path; and themanner of manifesting the results.THE REALITY OF THE BASISThe reality of the basis of our experience involves three subjects: the realityof the body; that of the mind; and that shared by both the body and mind.The Reality of the BodyThe reality of the body is that it is threefold: coarse, subtle, and verysubtle.The coarse body is the ordinary body made of flesh, blood and bone, and bornfrom the sperm and ovum of our parents.The subtle body refers to the abiding energy channels, the flowing energies, andthe emplaced red and white [i.e., female and male] creative drops.The very subtle body is the subtle energy that supports the consciousness of thefour emptinesses, especially the fourth emptiness, called \"utter emptiness,\"which is the clear light mind.The Reality of the MindAs for the mind, it also has these three same dimensions: coarse, subtle, andvery subtle.The coarse mind refers to that co-emergent with the five sensoryconsciousnesses.The subtle mind is that co-emergent with the driving force of the six rootdistortions, the twenty secondary distortions, and the eighty conceptualmindsets.The very subtle mind is the dimension of consciousness that is in the samenature as the four emptinesses, and especially the fourth, \"utter emptiness,\"which is the clear light mind.The Reality Shared by the Body and MindWhen embodied sentient beings meet with death, the very subtle aspects of theirvital energies and consciousness become of one entity. This entity is thereality shared by both body and mind.THE STAGES OF TRAVERSING THE PATHThe stages of traversing the path involve two principal types of techniques:those for drawing the vital energies into the central channel, and those thatare applied after the energies have been drawn in [to the central channel].The Techniques for Drawing the Vital Energies into the Central ChannelThe technique for drawing the vital energies into the central channel beginswith generating the image of oneself as Buddha Vajradhara, male and female insexual union, and envisioning the energy channels together with the mantricsyllables at the chakras. One then meditates on the inner heat and on themelting drops. This causes the vital energies to enter, abide, and dissolve.The sign indicating the entering of the vital energies is that, when a breath isinhaled in order to test one's progress, the air flows evenly through bothnostrils. The sign indicating that the energies have been caused to abide isthat the visions of the elemental dissolutions and also the dissolution of thethree visionary states occur. These dissolutions must be individuallyrecognized.First earth dissolves into water, and there is a vision like seeing a mirage.Then water dissolves into fire, and there is a smoke-like vision. Next firedissolves into air, and there is a vision like flickering fireflies. The airelement begins to dissolve into the visionary consciousness called \"appearance,\"and there is a vision like that of the glow of a butterlamp. Air fully dissolvesinto \"appearance,\" and there is a vision of whiteness, like a clear autumn skypervaded by the light of the full moon. This dissolves into the consciousnessknown as \"proximity,\" and there is a vision of redness, like that of the clearsky pervaded by sunlight. This dissolves into \"proximate attainment,\" and thereis a vision of overwhelming darkness, like the sky before dawn, with neither sunnor moon. \"Proximate attainment\" then dissolves into the clear light; there is avision of clear radiance, like the sky at daybreak, free from the threeconditions. One must recognize these experiences as they occur. This is theprocess known as \"blending with Dharmakaya during the waking state.\"When the time comes to arise from the clear light absorption one arouses thestrong instinct to put aside one's old aggregates and arise in the form of aBuddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Then when one arises from the clearlight one's old aggregates will be set aside and within the mind there forms theimage of a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Simultaneously oneapplies the techniques for inducing the stages of dissolution [described above]in reverse order. Thus one goes from the clear light to proximate attainment, toproximity, and to appearance. One experiences the signs of the elementaldissolutions [in reverse]: a glow like that of a butterlamp, firefly-likesparks, smoke, and finally the mirage. This is the process known as \"blendingwith the Sambhogakaya during the waking state.\"One engages in the stages of meditation on transformations associated with thatSambhogakaya form and focuses one's absorption upon it. When one decides toarise from the absorption, one does so by meditating upon one's old aggregatesas the Symbolic Being (Skt. smnayasattva), with the Wisdom Being (Skt.jnanasattva) at the heart. This is the process known as \"blending withNirmanakaya during the waking state.\"Simultaneous with this, as the air begins to flow through the nostrils again andthe five sensory consciousnesses are revived, whatever appearances occur areseen as emptiness, emptiness as bliss, and bliss as the mandala and its deities.This is the practice to be cultivated in the post-meditation sessions.Similarly, when one goes to sleep one attempts to retain the clear light ofsleep and sets the resolution to arise as a Sambhogakaya deity in the dreamstate. As one prepares for sleep one engages in the meditations on the channels,energies, and chakras, causing the drops to melt and the blisses to arise. Thevital energies enter, abide, and dissolve within the central channel. All thesigns of the dissolution process occur, from \"earth into water,\" until theemergence of the clear light. The four emptinesses emerge in the nature of thefour blisses. At the same time as the clear light occurs, one engages inmeditation on bliss conjoined with [the wisdom of] emptiness. This is theprocess known as \"blending with Dharmakaya in sleep.\"When the time comes to arise from that clear light one generates the resolutionto arise with a dream body by setting aside the body of the old aggregates andtaking the form of a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Then when oneemerges from the clear light [of sleep] the dream body appears. However, onedoes not do so in the body of the old aggregates; instead, one's dream bodyarises to the mind as a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. This iswhat is known as \"blending with Sambhogakaya in dreams.\"One focuses one's absorption on the meditations of the transformative processesof that Sambhogakaya. When the time comes to awaken from sleep, one does so byemerging with one's old aggregates envisioned as the Symbolic Being and with theWisdom Being at one's heart. This is the process known as \"blending withNirmanakaya while awakening.\"Simultaneous with this, as the air begins to flow through the nostrils and thefive sensory consciousnesses revive, whatever appearances occur are seen asemptiness, emptiness as bliss, and bliss as the mandala deities. This is thepractice to be cultivated in the post-meditation sessions.The yogi who is not able to accomplish the realizations of the highest stagebefore the time of death should cultivate the resolution to apply the techniquesfor retaining the clear light of death, arising in the Sambhogakaya in thebardo, and taking birth with the incarnation of a tantric master, ormantracharyin. Then as the actual moment of death draws near one should meditateon the channels, energies, chakras and so forth as above, and meditate upon theblazing and melting. This causes the vital energies to enter into the centralchannel and to abide and dissolve, giving rise to the signs of the dissolutions,until the signs of the clear light occur. As the clear light of death emergesone focuses in meditation upon emptiness. This is the process known as \"blendingwith Dharmakaya at death.\"When the time comes to arise from the clear light one arouses the instinct toset aside the old aggregates and, in taking a bardo body, to arise in the formof a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Then as one emerges from theclear light the image of the bardo body arises as Buddha Vajradhara, male andfemale in union, and the old aggregates are set aside. Simultaneously the signsof the dissolution process manifest in reverse, as consciousness reversesthrough the stages of clear light to proximate attainment, and so forth, untilthe vision of the mirage. This is the process known as \"blending withSambhogakaya in the bardo.\"One remains focused on the stages of absorption in the meditations of theSambhogakaya transformations. Then when the wish to take rebirth forms, oneseeks a suitable genetic environment in the white and red drops [i.e., thefertilized seeds] of one's future parents, in order to achieve rebirth as thespecial body-vessel of a tantric master. This is the process known as \"blendingwith Nirmanakaya at rebirth.\"The sentient being who enters the womb in this way will go through the fivestages of growth in the womb, such as that of being just a small conglomerate ofcells, and so forth. That being will then leave the womb, go through childhoodand youth, and then enter into spiritual practice and complete the remainder ofthe path, thus achieving Buddhahood.The Technique to be Applied After the Energies Have Been Drawn In [to theCentral Channel]After applying oneself to these methods for directing the vital energies intothe central channel, one eventually achieves a mature meditative absorptionfluent in the process. Soon one perceives the signs of approaching the stagewherein the illusory body can be produced. From within the sphere of sexuallyuniting with a karmamudra, which is the outer supporting condition, one engagesthe inner supporting condition, which refers to meditation on the channels,chakras, and so forth, and meditation upon the blazing and melting. The vitalenergies are caused to enter into the central channel and to abide and dissolve,giving rise to the signs of the dissolutions, from the mirage and so forth untilthe sign of the clear light. The four emptinesses emerge in the nature of thefour busses. When the innate clear light arises, one meditates upon blissconjoined with emptiness. This is the technique for engaging the innate semblantclear light, with which the basis of the illusory body is produced.When the time comes to emerge from the clear light, one arouses the instinct toset aside one's old aggregates and to take the form of a Buddha Vajradhara, maleand female in union. Then as one arises from the clear light, the vital energyof the five radiances, upon which rides the innate semblant clear light, servesas the substantial cause; and the mind serves as the simultaneously presentcondition. Based upon these, the old aggregates are by-passed and one arises inthe form of a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union, adorned by the marksand signs of perfection. This is the stage of \"the unpurified illusory body.\"Simultaneously one experiences the dissolution process in reverse, going fromclear light to proximate attainment, and so forth, until the sign of the mirage.In tantric systems such as Guhyasamaja this illusory body is illustrated andexplained by using twelve similes.1At that time three factors occur simultaneously: the cessation of the innatesemblance [i.e., the \"semblant\" or \"metaphoric\" clear light consciousness], thefulfillment of proximate attainment in the dissolution process, and arisal inthe actual form of an \"unpurified illusory body.\" The person with that illusorybody then focuses on the stages of absorption.How does one engage the stages of absorption?First one meditates on the phases of the dissolution process, which causes thevital energies to enter into the central channel, abide, and dissolve. Thisgives rise to the signs of the absorptions, from the mirage up to the clearlight. When the time comes to emerge from the clear light, one arouses theresolution to have the unpurified illusory body transform into a pure illusorybody. Then as one arises from the clear light the unpurified illusory body isset aside and the image of the pure illusory body arises within the mind.Simultaneous with that, one experiences the dissolution process in reverse; onemoves from the clear light to proximate attainment, and so forth, until the signof the mirage. The being engaging that Sambhogakaya form then arises as theNirmanakaya, emanating forth the supported and supporting mandalas. When onewants to arise from meditation one does so by meditating upon the old aggregatesas the Symbolic Being with the Wisdom Being at the heart.Residing within that vessel one shows the Dharma to trainees and cultivates theactivities of the after-practice, which include tantric enactments such aseating, drinking, and sexually uniting with a karmamudra.The practitioner of this illusory body stage cultivates these advancedmeditations and eventually sees signs that the accomplishment of the stage knownas \"the great union of training\" is approaching. He engages in the practice ofuniting with a karmamudra as the external condition; and, as the innercondition, engages the meditations on the stages of the dissolutions and soforth, causing the vital energies to enter the central channel, abide, anddissolve. The signs of the dissolutions occur, from that of the mirage to thatof the clear light. The four emptinesses emerge in the nature of the fourblisses. At the moment of the innate clear light, one engages the meditation ofbliss conjoined with emptiness.At that time five factors occur simultaneously: the state known as \"proximateattainment in the unfoldment process\" ceases; the innate bliss induces anunprecedented direct realization of emptiness; the illusory body is purified inthe actual clear light, appearing like a rainbow in a radiant sky; one achievesthe unhindered stage wherein the direct antidote to the emotional obscurationsis born within one's mindstream; and one's continuum becomes that of an arya.By the time the process of emerging from the clear light begins, one's previousdriving force in the practice will have come into play, placing one at the doorthrough which the \"pure illusory body\" can be achieved. As one emerges from theclear light, with the role of the substantial cause being played by the subtleenergy of five radiances, upon which rides the innate actuality [i.e., theinnate actual clear light consciousness], and the role of the simultaneouslypresent condition being played by the mind itself, one arises in the actual\"pure illusory body,\" which flows in an unbroken stream in a form such as thatof Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union, adorned by the marks and signsof perfection, with one's old aggregates left behind.Simultaneously the signs of the dissolution process in reverse manifest, fromthat of going from the clear light to proximate attainment, until the sign ofthe mirage. At that time five factors occur together: the innate actualityceases; the state of proximate attainment in the dissolution process isproduced; the arisal of the \"pure illusory body\"; one achieves the path of utterliberation which is free from emotional obscurations;5 and one's continuumbecomes that of an arhat.The being of that Sambhogakaya form then focuses in meditative absorption.What are the stages of that absorption? One focuses in single-pointed meditationupon emptiness and then causes the vital energies to enter into the centralchannel, to abide, and to dissolve, giving rise to the signs, until the clearlight occurs. At that time one has arrived at the place wherein the state ofgreat union can be unobstructedly achieved, where body and mind can be broughttogether as a single entity. Here body is represented by the pure illusory bodyadorned with the marks and signs of perfection, and mind is represented by theactual clear light consciousness.When the time comes to arise from that clear light experience one's previousdriving force from the practice comes into play, and one finds oneself at thedoor through which the body of \"the great union in training\" can become that of\"the great union beyond training.\" In emerging from the clear light, the beingon the stage of \"the great union of training\" perceives the image of the body ofthe stage of \"the great union beyond training.\" Simultaneously the signs of thereversal process occur, from that of moving from the clear light to proximateattainment, and so forth, until the mirage.That Sambhogakaya holds the potential of the Nirmanakaya, which emanates forth anet of activities, such as manifesting the supported and supporting mandalas.When one wishes to arise from meditation, one enters into one's own oldaggregates or some other old aggregates, whichever is appropriate. Then,residing in that vessel, one shows Dharma to those to be trained and cultivatesthe after-practice activities, such as uniting with a karmamudra, eating anddrinking, as well as residing with wild animals, and so forth.THE MANNER OF MANIFESTING THE RESULTSThe yogi on the stage of great union of training cultivates the absorptions ofthat level during both formal meditation and post-meditation sessions, andeventually sees signs of the approach of the attainment of great union beyondtraining. One engages the external condition of sexually uniting with akarmamudra and the internal condition of meditating single-pointedly onemptiness, causing the vital energies to enter into the central channel, abide,and dissolve. The signs occur, beginning with the mirage and so forth, untileventually the signs of the clear light manifest. The four emptinesses arise inthe nature of the four blisses.The moment this innate clear light manifests, one engages the meditation ofbliss conjoined with [the wisdom of] emptiness. The first moment of this clearlight is the unobstructed stage on which the perceptual obscurations' aretranscended. The second moment of it is also the first moment of omniscientbuddhahood, wherein one remains in perfect absorption upon the final nature ofbeing, while at the same time directly seeing all conventional realities asclearly as a piece of fruit held in the hand. The body of great union oftraining becomes the great union beyond training, the actual Sambhogakayaendowed with the kisses of the seven excellences that sends out thousands ofNirmanakaya emanations to benefit those to be trained. Thus one achievescomplete buddhahood in the nature of the three kayas.As a preliminary to attaining the stage of the great union beyond training, onemust go through the stage of great union of training. As a preliminary to thatone must accomplish the illusory body, and for that one must first meditate uponthe channels, chakras, blazing, melting, and so forth.In turn, as a preliminary [to these completion stage practices] one must go tothe end of the coarse and subtle generation stage practices which take birth,death, and bardo, the bases to be purified, as the paths of the three kayas. Forthis one must have received the complete empowerments and be mature in observingthe disciplines adopted at the time of initiation. Moreover, before enteringinto tantric practice one should train the mind in the common path, fromcultivating an effective working relationship with a spiritual master, up to themeditative training that combines shamata and vipassyana.Thus the jewel-like practitioner who engages in the profound path of Naropa'sSix Yogas in this way has entered into a complete and unmistaken path foraccomplishing enlightenment in one short lifetime, even in this degenerate age.The colophon: Notes on the stream of teachings of Vajradhara Lobzang Dondrup,with nothing extra and nothing left out, transcribed and edited by the Buddhistmonk Basowa Tenpai Gyaltsen.'[../Images/img0005.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"A PRACTICE MANUAL ON THE SIX YOGAS OF NAROPA: TAKING THE PRACTICE IN HANDTib. Na ro'i chos drug gi dmigs skor lag to len tshulbyLama Jey Tsongkhapa1357-1419"},{"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S PREAMBLEThe collected works of Lama Jey Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Geluk school,contain two texts on the Six Yogas of Naropa: a tri-yig (Tib. 'khrid yig), ortreatise of the tradition; and a mig-rini (Tib. dmigs rini), or \"Stages ofMeditation/Visualization.\"The tri-yig, included in Tsongkhapa's Six Yogas of Naropa, is double the lengthof the latter, and is written as a critical study of the overall nature of thesystem, including philosophical and historical points of controversy andinterest.A mig-rini, on the other hand, is usually written in the form of quintessentialmeditation instruction combined with liturgy. This is the case with Tsongkhapa'smig-rim on the Six Yogas. It directly presents the practice of the system of theSix Yogas, and when reading the text one has to keep this in mind. Its strengthlies in the fact that it provides a succinct overview of the meditations andyogas of the tradition. The instructions on the Six Yogas given here in brief byTilopa and Naropa respectively in Chapters One and Two, touched upon by JeySherab Gyatso in Chapter Three and presented from the viewpoint of the threeblendings by Gyalwa Wensapa in Chapter Four, are detailed here by Tsongkhapa asstep-by-step methods in practice.Lama Jey Tsongkhapa was born in 1357 in Amdo near Tibet's border with China to afamily of farmers. His birth was accompanied by many auspicious signs, and as achild he became a monk. By the time he reached his teens he had become learnedin the sutras and tantras and proficient in meditation. His teacher sent him toCentral Tibet to complete his training, and over the years to follow he studiedin fortyfive monasteries and hermitages under all the greatest lamas of his day.When he had finally become content with the level of his learning, he enteredinto the traditional four-year retreat and dedicated himself to intensemeditation. Shortly thereafter he entered another retreat, and a year into theprocess achieved realization.The later years of his life were dedicated to teaching, writing, and thecreation of spiritual centers. The most important of his building activities wasthe construction of Ganden Monastery in 1409, which soon became the fountainheadof the spiritual movement that followed in his wake. In the early days thisschool of Tibetan Buddhism was known as the Galuk, or \"Joyful Tradition\" (fromthe name of his monastery, Ganden, or \"Place of Joy\"). In later times the sectchanged its name to Geluk, or \"Sublime Tradition.\"Thousands of disciples came to him for training, of whom five are said to havebeen supreme. From among these, the youngest was a monk who later became knownto history as the First Dalai Lama. All subsequent Dalai Lamas, including thepresent (or Fourteenth), have received their basic monastic training from lamasof the Geluk school founded by Lama Tsongkhapa.Tsongkhapa's approach to Buddhist study and practice was one of balance. The erain which he lived was intensely spiritual in character, but was afflicted by apolarization of the Buddhist communities into semi-literate yogis dwelling inmountain caves and monks who were highly learned but weak in the practice ofmeditation. Tsongkhapa insisted that all the disciples who came to him becomewell-versed in the Buddhist classics, and also that they practice dailymeditation and undertake the major retreats. In addition, the Tibetan populationwas polarized into those who devoted themselves to the sutra (or GeneralMahayana) aspect of Dharma, and those who dedicated themselves to the tantricpath; Tsongkhapa insisted that all his disciples first gain basic innerstability by means of the General Mahayana trainings and then enter into theexalted tantric yogas.His formula certainly met with success, and Gelukpa monasteries and hermitagesgrew up throughout Central Asia at an amazing rate. Within a matter of a fewcenturies the Geluk had outgrown all other sects of Tibetan Buddhism combined.This was not only the case within Tibet, but also within much of Central Asia.For example, even during his lifetime seventeen Gelukpa monasteries and templeswere established in China by one of his disciples. Moreover, the Geluk traditionof Tibetan Buddhism became the national religion of the Mongol nations in 1578,when the Third Dalai Lama travelled and taught there at the invitation of theChakkar king Altan Khan, and it has remained so ever since.Tsongkhapa was an amazingly prolific writer. His texts on the principal subjectsof the Sutrayana, such as Madhyamaka and Prajnaparamita, stand today with thegreat classics of Asian literature. However, his writings on the tantric pathare even more important, and certainly more voluminous.His treatise on the Six Yogas of Naropa, A Book of Three Inspirations, is one ofhis most popular tantric writings, and is often used as the basis of publicdiscourses given by Gelukpa lamas on the Six Yogas. His Practice Manual on theSix Yogas of Naropa is less well-known, because it is usually only taught topractitioners in retreat. It nonetheless is regarded as an important tantricwork.Even though his Practice Manual on the Six Yogas is always published as part ofTsongkhapa's Collected Works, in fact it was not actually written by him.Instead, it was compiled from a number of his teachings and then edited as acohesive text by Sempa Chenpo Kunzangpa, one of his immediate disciples and alsoa guru to the First Dalai Lama. However, in that it was compiled fromTsongkhapa's words it is always attributed directly to him.The text opens with liturgies for the meditations on Vajrasattva and guru yoga,followed by a brief sadhana of Heruka Chakrasamvara. These are all regarded aspreliminary practices which anyone wishing to engage in the Six Yogas shouldcomplete. Most trainees would be expected to perform 100,000 recitations of theVajrasattva hundredsyllable mantra, together with the according meditations, andalso 100,000 recitations of the guru's mantra in conjunction with themeditations described in the liturgy. These two methods are usually done inretreat, and generally take a month to six weeks each to complete. In additiontrainees would perform at least a three-month retreat on their mandala deity,with many hundreds of thousands of mantra recitations. As Jey Sherab Gyatsostates, the most common mandala deity used in conjunction with the Six Yogas isHeruka Chakrasamvara."},{"pageContent":"A PRACTICE MANUAL ON THE SIX YOGAS OF NAROPA: TAKING THE PRACTICE IN HANDby Lama Jey TsongkliapaHomage to the lotus feet of the spiritual master, who is inseparable in naturefrom Buddha Vajradhara.The instructions on the practice of the profound path renowned everywhere as theSix Yogas of Naropa are presented under two headings: (I) the special tantricpreliminaries; and (II) on the basis of having completed the preliminaries, howto meditate on the actual tantric path.THE SPECIAL TANTRIC PRELIMINARIESThere are two special tantric preliminary practices to be completed before onecan take up the meditations on the Six Yogas of Naropa: the meditation andmantra recitation of Vajrasattva; and the meditation on guru yoga.THE VAJRASATTVA MEDITATION AND MANTRA RECITATIONBegin by blending thoughts of refuge and the universalist bodhisattva attitudedeeply into your mindstream. Then meditate as follows:Above your head visualize a white syllable PAM. It transforms into a white lotuswith a white syllable AH resting upon it. This syllable transforms into a moondisk with a white syllable HUM resting above it. HUM transforms into a white,five-pronged vajra marked by a syllable HUM.Lights go out from this, accomplish the two purposes, and then absorb into itagain.This transforms, and Vajrasattva instantly appears [upon the lotus and moonseats on your head]. His body is white in color, he holds a vajra in his righthand and a bell in his left, and is embracing the consort white Vajra Bhagavati.She holds a curved knife and a cup made of a human skull. They are adorned withthe precious ornaments and have the marks and signs of perfection. Vajrasattvais seated with his legs crossed in the vajra posture.A white syllable HUM stands upon a moon disk at his heart. From it lightsemanate forth and summon the Wisdom Beings, who resemble him.Make the five types of devotional offerings to them. Then: JAH HUM BAM HOH! Theyare summoned, and dissolve into, merge with, and become inseparably one withhim.Again lights emanate from the syllable HUM at Vajrasattva's heart, summoning theInitiation Deities.One again makes the devotional offerings to them and then recites: \"OTathagatas, You Gone to Suchness, please bestow empowerment.\"The Tathagatas agree to bestow empowerment. Their consorts hold up jewelledvases filled with wisdom empowerment nectars, and sing the auspicious verse,[../Images/page0101_0000.svg]Saying this, they pour forth empowering nectars from their vases, until the bodyof Vajrasattva and Consort are completely filled with the wisdom nectars. BuddhaAkshobya manifests from the overflow as Vajrasattva's crown ornament.One calls out, \"0 Bhagavan Vajrasattva, please inspire me to purify all negativekarmic seeds, spiritual obscurations, and degenerated precepts accumulated bymyself and others.\"Requested in this way, lights emanate forth from the syllable HUM at his heart.They touch all living beings and purify them of negative karmic instincts,obscurations, and transgressions of spiritual precepts.The lights then present devotional offerings to the buddhas and bodhisattvas ofthe ten directions. The blessings of body, speech, mind, realization, andactivity power of all enlightened beings transform into light and are drawn intothe syllable HUM at Vajrasattva's heart. Vajrasattva becomes brilliantly radiantand empowered with every strength and perfection.Surrounding the syllable HUM at Vajrasattva's heart are the syllables of thehundred-syllable mantra: OM VAJRA HERUKA SAMAYA / MANUPALAYA / HERUKATVENOPATISHTHA / DRIDHO MEBHAVA / SUTOSHYO MEBHAVA / SUPOSHYO MEBHAVA / ANURAKTOMEBHAVA/SARVA SIDDHI MEPRAYACHHA/SARVA KARMA SUCHAME / CHHITAM SHRI YAM / KURUHUM/ HA HA HA HA HOH BHAGAVAN / VAJRA HERUKA MAME MUCHA / HERUKA BHAVA / MAHASAMAYA SATTVA AH HUM PHAT.Lights emanate from these mantric syllables. They purify living beings ofnegative karmic instincts and spiritual obscurations, and make inconceivablyvast offerings to the buddhas and bodhisattvas. The inspiring energies of thebody, speech, and mind of the buddhas and bodhisattvas are drawn forth and areabsorbed into the mantric syllables.A stream of white nectar flows forth from the mantric seeds. It flows downinside the bodies of Vajrasattva and Consort, exiting them from the place oftheir sexual union. The nectars enter my body via the crown aperture, until mybody is utterly filled. All negative karmic instincts and obscurations collectedby means of activities of body, speech, and mind are expelled and leave via mybodily apertures and pores in the form of a thick black mist. I become purifiedof all negative karma and obscurations. The stream of wisdom nectar fills mybody with a blazing white radiance, infusing me with every spiritual knowledgeand excellence.Meditating in this way, recite the hundred-syllable mantra as many times aspossible. Then recite:[../Images/page0102_0000.svg]Vajrasattva replies, \"Child of good character, your negative karmic instincts,spiritual obscurations and failures in training are all now purified.\"He then dissolves into me. My body, speech, and mind become inseparably one withthe body, speech, and mind of Vajrasattva.THE MEDITATION ON GURU YOGAMeditate as follows:In the space in front of you, on a jeweled throne supported by eight lions, is aseat made of a lotus with a sun disk. Upon this sits your guru in the form ofBuddha Vajradhara. His body is blue in color, and he has one face and two arms.He holds a vajra in his right hand and a bell in his left, and embraces aconsort who resembles him. His upper and lower robes are made of celestialsilks, and he is adorned with the jewel ornaments. His legs are crossed in thevajra posture, and he is ablaze with lights of five colors.A white syllable OM rests upon a moon disk at his crown chakra; a red syllableAH rests upon a lotus at his throat chakra; and a blue syllable HUM rests upon asun disk at his heart chakra. All three syllables are ablaze with lights.Lights emanate from the syllable HUM, summoning forth Buddha Vajradhara, theassembly of lineage gurus, and the host of mandala meditational deities. Theyall dissolve into the Buddha Vajradhara visualized in front.Now make devotional offerings, and then offer the mandala symbolic of theuniverse:OM VAJRA BHUMI AH HUM! Here is the great powerful golden earth. OM VAIRA REKHEAH HUM! Here is the surrounding iron fence. Here is the great Mount Meru; to theeast of it, the continent Lupakpo; to the south, Jambuling; to the westBalangcho; and to the north Draminyan. Here also are the sub-continents: Lu andLupak; Ngayab and Ngayabzhan; Yodan and Lamchokdro; Draminyan and DraminyanKyida.Here are the precious elephant, the precious lord, the precious supreme horse,the precious queen, the precious warrior, the precious wheel, the preciousjewel, and the precious treasure vase. And here are the sun and the moon.In this way I create a symbolic universe with all auspicious things in it,visualizing it as being made of various precious gems. I send it forth, gemstogether with the mass of meritorious energy collected in the past, present, andfuture by myself and all other living beings through our actions of body,speech, and mind, and together with our pleasures of the three times, as anoffering in the manner exemplified by the great bodhisattva Samantabhadra. Allof this I envision within my mind and offer to my gurus, meditational deities,and the forces of spiritual refuge. Accept it out of your compassion, and bestowwaves of inspiring power upon me.In this way offer the mandala to the guru inseparable from Buddha Vajradhara.This should be done as outer, inner, and secret offerings. Here the flowerpetals, or whatever substances are used, represent the outer offering. Thenectars with which these are anointed represent the inner offering.Then recite the following verse and request:[../Images/page0104_0000.svg]\"0 precious master, bestow blessings that I may be inspired to quickly generatewithin my mindstream the realizations of the ordinary and extraordinary paths.Bestow blessings that any negative conditions obstructing the fulfillment of myaspirations may be pacified, and that conducive conditions may prevail.\"The guru smiles with delight. White lights emanate forth from the white syllableOM at his crown, and enter your body via your crown. They fill you with a whiteradiance, purify all negative karma collected by means of the body, bestow thevase empowerment, and plant seeds for the attainment of the vajra body.Red lights then emanate forth from the red syllable AH at his throat and enteryour body via your throat. They fill you with a red radiance, purify allnegative karma collected by means of speech, bestow the secret empowerment, andplant seeds for the attainment of the vajra speech.Blue lights emanate forth from the blue syllable HUM at his heart and enter yourbody via your heart. They fill you with a blue radiance, purify all negativekarma collected by means of the mind, bestow the wisdom awareness empowerment,and plant seeds for the attainment of the vajra mind.Finally multicolored lights then emanate from all parts of the guru's body andenter your body from all sides. These purify subtle negative karma collected bymeans of all three doors, bestow the fourth empowerment, and plant seeds for theattainment of the three inseparable vajras.The guru visualized in front then comes to the crown of your head and dissolvesinto you. Your body, speech, and mind become inseparably one with the body,speech, and mind of the guru.THE ACTUAL TANTRIC PATHWhen these preliminaries have been completed you can engage in the actualtantric practices. These are of two levels: the generation stage yoga; and thecompletion stage yogas.THE GENERATION STAGE YOGABegin by reciting the mantra of emptiness: OM SVABHAVA SHUDDHAH SARVADHARMAHSVABHAVA SHUDDHOH HAM. Everything dissolves into radiant emptiness.From within the sphere of emptiness there manifests a multicolored lotus with asun disk. Instantly you appear on it as Bhagavan Heruka Chakrasamvara, your bodydark blue in color. You have four faces: the main one is black, the left one isgreen, the rear one is red, and the right one is yellow. Each of the faces hasthree eyes. You have twelve arms, and your forehead is adorned with a band offive-pointed vajras.Your right leg is outstretched and presses down on the head of black Bhairava,who has four hands, the first two with palms joined together, the extra on theright holding a damaru drum, and the extra on the left holding a sword. Yourleft leg is bent in, and presses down on the breasts of red Kalarati, who alsohas four hands, the first two with palms joined together, the extra two holdinga skull cup and a katvanga staff. Both of these supporting deities have one faceand three eyes, and are adorned by the five seals.Your first two hands embrace your consort Vajra Varahi and hold a five-pointedvajra in the right and a bell in the left. The next set of two hold the fresh,greasy skin of a white elephant, with its left foreleg in your right hand andleft hind leg in your left, as though holding up a cape over your back. Thefingers of your hands are formed into the threatening mudra, the handsthemselves at the level of your eyebrows.Your third right hand holds a damaru drum, your fourth a vajra axe, your fifth avajra sword, and your sixth a trident. Your third left hand holds a katvangastaff marked by a vajra, your fourth a skull cup filled with blood, your fifth avajra noose, and your sixth the head of Brahma, who has four faces.Your long hair is tied up on the crown of your head and is adorned with acrossed vajra. Each of your [four] heads is adorned with a crown made of fivedried human skulls and has garlands of black vajras. To the left of your crownis a shimmering half-moon crescent that emanates pacifying energies. Your fourfangs [on each face] are bared and terrifying.Your body has the three qualities of arrogance, courage, and roughness. Yourspeech has the three qualities of humor, force, and wrath. Your mind has thethree qualities of compassion, power, and serenity. In this way you have ninevibrant presences.You are wearing a tiger skin as a lower robe, are adorned with a necklace offreshly cut human heads strung on a string made from human gut, are sealed withthe six seals, and are smeared with ashes and bone fragments from humancremation pyres.The consort Bhagavati Vajra Varahi is gazing intensely at you, the Bhagavan. Herbody is naked and is red in color. She has one face, three eyes, and two arms.Part of her hair is fixed in a knot on the top of her head and the remainderfalls down loosely over her shoulders. Her right arm is wrapped around your neckand holds a skull cup filled with the blood of the four maras and other evilforces. Her right hand holds a curved knife and shows the threatening mudra toall harmful beings of the ten directions. She blazes with a fire like that atthe end of time and her two legs are wrapped around your waist in order to pullyou into a sexual embrace with her. Her essence is great compassion manifest inthe nature of supreme bliss. She is adorned with the five seals, has a crown offive dried human skulls, and wears a belt of fifty dried human skulls.A white syllable OM stands on a moon at your crown, a red syllable AH stands ona lotus at your throat, and a blue syllable HUM stands on a sun at your heart.Lights emanate from the syllable HUM on the sun at your heart and summon forthWisdom Beings that resemble you [Heruka and Consort], as well as the InitiationDeities. Make offerings to them with the mantras OM ARGHAM PRATTICHHA SVAHA andso forth, until SHABTA.JAH HUM BAM HOH: The Wisdom Beings seem delighted and without hesitation meltinto you.Make the request to the Initiation Deities, \"0 Tathagatas, You Gone to Suchness,please bestow empowerment.\"Having been thus requested, they sing the auspicious verse,[../Images/page0107_0000.svg]They recite the mantra of initiation-OM SARVA TATHAGATA ABHISHEKATA SAMAYA SHRIYE HUM-and then pour forth empowering nectars. The nectars fill the bodies ofyourself and consort and then overflow through your crown apertures. Theoverflow above Heruka's crown takes the form of Buddha Vajrasattva, and thatabove the crown of the consort takes the form of Buddha Akshobya. These becomeyour crown ornaments. The Initiation Deities dissolve into you.Now make the offerings to yourself manifest in the divine form of the mandaladeity:[../Images/page0107_0001.svg]Male and female enter into sexual union, which gives rise to great bliss. Theybecome utterly absorbed in the experience.Recite the praise with the mantra OM HRIH HA HA HUM HUM PHAT. OM VAJRAVAIROCHANI YE HUM HUM PHAT SVAHA.Having meditated in this way, you should now concentrate on the absorption ofthe divine tantric pride of sensing yourself as actually being HerukaChakrasamvara and Consort. Remain in this meditation for as long as possible.Then engage in the mantra recitation. Visualize that the following mantra standsin a circle around the syllable HUM at your heart: OM HRIH HA HA HUM HUM PHAT.Recite this mantra as many times as possible, while engaging in the meditationas taught in the oral tradition.THE COMPLETION STAGE YOGASThere are two main practices, the first of which involves the physicalexercises, together with meditating on the body as being utterly empty ofmateriality.A. The Physical Exercises, Together with the Body as EmptyWithin the sphere of visualizing yourself as the mandala deity, male and femalein sexual union, perform the following six exercises.In the first, which is known as \"filling the body like a vase,\" you sit on acomfortable cushion, with your legs crossed comfortably. Your back is setstraight and the hands placed on the knees.Draw in air through the right nostril, glance to the left, and then release theair through the left, exhaling slowly and gently until no more remains in thelungs. Then draw in air through the left nostril, gaze to the right, and gentlyrelease it via the other nostril. Next draw in the air through both nostrils,glance straight ahead, and release it slowly through both. Repeat this cycle ofthree breaths two more times. In this way the breath is purified by means ofnine cycles. With both inhalation and exhalation, no air should be allowed topass through the mouth.Now sit with the body straight and erect, the hands formed into fists with thethumbs inside. Breathe in slowly and deeply, and push the air down to below thenavel. Swallow some saliva without making a sound and press down [on the ball ofair] with the abdomen, as though the air was being pushed to a point just belowthe navel chakra. Simultaneously pull up air from below and contract the musclesof the pelvic floor.Hold the breath for as long as is comfortable. As you do so, press down [withthe abdomen] and pull up [with the muscles of the pelvis floor]. In this way theupper and lower airs are held in an embrace at the navel and the body is filled[with air], like water in the belly of a vase.Imagine that your consciousness is located at the center of the navel chakra.Hold the breath as long as you can, and when it can no longer be retained, letit out slowly via the nose, without allowing any to be exhaled via the mouth.This, the vase breathing technique, is the first of the six exercises. All ofthe five remaining exercises are performed while engaging in it.The second exercise is called \"circling like a wheel.\" Here you should sit inthe vajra posture, hold the big toe of the right foot with the right hand, andthe big toe of the left foot with the left hand. Straighten the spine, and rollthe upper waist and stomach clockwise three times and then counterclockwisethree times. Next stretch the upper body from the left to the right, and thenfrom the right to the left. Finally snap the solar plexus from the front towardthe back, and then from the back toward the front.The third exercise is called \"hooking like a hook.\" Form the hands into vajrafists, tense your muscles, and stretch your arms outward, beginning from yourheart and reaching directly in front of your chest. Then stretch your two armsto the left, and slowly but with muscles tensed slide the right hand back to theright shoulder. Next bring the left hand to the heart, and snap the left elbowinto the rib cage. Repeat this process three times.Now do the same movement in reverse. First make the vajra fist mudra, beginningwith the two hands at the heart, and then extend your arms straight outward. Dothis slowly but with tensed muscles. Stretch them to the right, and hook them asbefore [except in reverse], bringing the left hand to the left shoulder and theright hand to the heart, and snapping the right elbow into the rib cage.The fourth exercise is that of showing the mudra of vajra binding, liftingupward toward the sky, and then pressing downward. Plant the knees flat on thefloor, straighten the body, and then, with the fingers of both hands stretchedupward like metal hooks, lift upward slowly but with great intensity into thespace above your head. Then reverse the hands, so that the hooked fingers pointdownward, and bring them down slowly but with intensity.The fifth exercise is that of making the body straight as an arrow and thenexpelling the air with the sound of a dog heaving. Kneel on the floor,straighten your body, place your hands on the floor, and put your head betweenyour hands. Slowly yet with intensity raise your head and straighten your body.Then bring your head back down to between your two hands and forcefully expelall air from the lungs. As you do this, make the sound \"hah,\" like a dogheaving. Then stand up and shake your feet three times each.The sixth exercise involves shaking the head and body and flexing the joints.Pull on the fingers of your two hands in order to pop the joints and then shakeyour head and body vigorously. Conclude by rubbing your two hands as thoughwashing them.It is important to hold your breath and control the vital energies whenpracticing these physical exercises. All movements should be slow yet intense.The best time to engage in the exercises is either before you eat or elseseveral hours after having eaten, when the stomach has digested most of thefood. Persevere in the practice until your body becomes completely flexible.As for the meditation on the body as being empty, here you should visualizeyourself as being the mandala deity and should imagine that your entire body isutterly empty of material substance, from the tip of your head to the soles ofyour feet. It is like an intestine inflated with radiantly bright air. Keep yourmind firmly and clearly on this image.B. The Stages of Meditation upon the Actual Path of the Six YogasThis involves two levels of practice: the essence of the actual path; and thebranches of that path, which include the practices of consciousness transferenceand forceful projection.The first of these involves two processes: arousing the four blisses by means ofdrawing the vital energies into the central channel; and, having accomplishedthat, the meditations on the illusory body and clear light yogas.'The process of drawing the vital energies into the central channel and arousingthe four blisses is accomplished by means of two principal techniques: the innercondition of the meditations on the inner heat yoga; and the external conditionof relying upon a karmamudra.The Inner Condition: Meditation upon the Inner Heat YogaHere there are two stages to the practice: meditating upon the inner heat yogain order to draw the vital energies into the central channel; and, havingbrought in the energies, the methods of arousing the four blisses.The meditation on the inner heat yoga, which draws the vital energies into thecentral channel, involves two stages of practice: the actual meditations on theinner heat yoga; and, having done this, the meditations that cause the vitalenergies to enter, abide, and dissolve within the central channel.The actual meditation on the inner heat yoga involves three principaltechniques: meditating by means of visualizing the channels; meditating by meansof visualizing mantric syllables; and meditating by means of engaging in thevase breathing technique.The first of these is the process of meditating on the inner heat by means ofenvisioning the channels.Begin by imagining that in the space in front of you your root guru, togetherwith the gurus in the line of transmission, surrounded by the host of dakas anddakinis, instantly manifest. Symbolically offer them all things good in theworld and beyond. Then make the following request for blessings and realization:\"May my energies be joyous. May my energy channels be subtle. And may the uniquerealizations of great bliss and the wisdom of emptiness be easily accomplished.\"Contemplate this thought intensely, and then generate the bodhisattva resolve:\"For the benefit of living beings as vast in number as the measure of the sky Iwill achieve the state of a Buddha Vajradhara. For this purpose I now take upthe practice of cliandali, the inner heat yoga.\"Then visualize yourself as the mandala deity, sit on your meditation seat, puton your meditation belt, cross your legs, and set your backbone erect. Your neckshould be bent slightly forward and your eyes cast downward at the angle of yournose. Your tongue should be held gently against your upper palate, and yourteeth and lips set in their natural closed position. Posture the body and mindalertly, with the chest slightly extended. Your hands should be placed in themeditation posture just below the navel, with the back of one hand in the palmof the other.Next you should visualize the three energy channels. The central channel, knownas avadlnuti, begins at a point four finger-widths below the navel, and runsfrom there up the center of the body just in front of the spinal column. To itsright is the channel known as rasana, and to its left is lalana. These channelsproceed up the body to the head, like pillars supporting the four chakras. Thelower tips of the side channels bend into a U-shape and curve up into the baseof the central channel.Now visualize the four chakras. First at the navel is the chakra called \"thewheel of emanation.\" Its shape is somewhat triangular, like the [Sanskrit]syllable EH, and it has sixty-four petals. They are red in color and stretchupward.At the heart is the chakra known as \"the wheel of truth.\" Its shape is somewhatcircular, like the [Sanskrit syllable] BAM, and it has eight petals, white incolor, extending downward.At the throat is the chakra known as \"the wheel of enjoyment,\" also somewhatcircular in shape, like the syllable BAM. It has sixteen petals, red in color,that reach upward.At the crown is the chakra \"the wheel of great ecstasy.\" It also is somewhattriangular, like the syllable EH, and has thirty-two petals. These aremulticolored and extend downward.'In the beginning of the session simply place the mind on these three channelsand four chakras. Meditate on both the upper and the lower regions [i.e., thetwo upper and two lower chakras] equally for a short period of time, and thenswitch your focus to the navel chakra. After that keep the mind solely on thenavel chakra, which is located four finger-widths below the navel at the pointinside the central channel where the three channels join, just in front of thespine.The next step involves meditating by means of visualizing the mantric syllables.This can be done either elaborately or else simply. The elaborate method entailsvisualizing mantric syllables at both the center of the chakras as well as oneach of the petals. The simplified practice requires visualizing only a mantricsyllable at the center of each of the four chakras.The process of this simplified technique is as follows.First focus on the navel chakra, known as \"the wheel of emanation.\" It islocated inside the central channel at a point four fingerwidths below the navel,just in front of the spine. At its center is an AH-stroke mantric syllable. Thissyllable stands upright upon a tiny moon disk and is in its Sanskrit form, whichresembles the Tibetan character shad in the Tibetan classical script [i.e., thevertical stroke that divides Tibetan sentences]. It is red in color, standsupright, and is the size of a mustard seed.'The heart chakra, known as \"the wheel of truth,\" has eight petals and is locatedin the center of the central channel just in front of the spine at the pointmidway between the two nipples. At its center is a tiny moon disk, and upon itis a blue syllable HUM, its head pointing downward [i.e., upside down]. Meditatethat it is the size of a mustard seed and has the power to cause the bodhimindsubstance to descend like falling snow.'The throat chakra, known as \"the wheel of enjoyment,\" has sixteen petals and islocated at the center of the central channel in the throat region, just in frontof the spinal column. At its center is a small moon disk with a tiny redsyllable OM standing upright upon it, the size of a mustard seed.The crown chakra, known as \"the wheel of great bliss,\" has thirtytwo petals andis located in the center of the central channel at the crown. At its center is amoon disk with a white syllable HAM standing upon it, its head pointed downward.It too is the size of a mustard seed.All four mantric syllables are seen as having the crescent made of a half-moon,a sun, and a nada. Meditate that they have the power to cause the bodhimindsubstances to melt and fall like dew dripping from leaves, as this willintensify the force of the inner bliss that is experienced. Also, meditate thatthe syllables are radiantly bright, for this will cut off any mental dullnessand make it easy to achieve clear concentration.When visualizing these mantric syllables, meditate on them as though the mindhas become fully blended with them. Do not do so as though looking at them fromsome far-off place. Holding the image either too strongly or too weakly willrespectively allow mental tension or sloth to set in. It is important to focuson the image with just the right degree of force. Concentrate on the syllablesin the three upper chakras for only a brief period at the beginning of eachsession, and then focus exclusively on the AH-stroke syllable at the navelchakra.For beginners, visualizing the syllables as being very small may seem difficult.If this is the case for you, begin by envisioning them as large and then laterreduce them in size.Next meditate on the inner heat in conjunction with the vase breathingtechnique. Here the oral tradition of the gurus speaks of this method as havingfour phases: drawing in the airs; filling the stomach like the belly of a vase;compressing the airs; and releasing the airs up the central channel like anarrow.Take care that as you draw in the airs you do not allow any breath to passthrough the mouth. It should move exclusively through the nostrils. Breathe inwith a strong, deep breath and then retain the airs inside, without allowing anyto leave. Press the air down with the abdomen, and imagine that the air fillsthe two side channels, rasana and lalana. It is as though these two becomecompletely filled, like empty intestines inflated with air.After the side channels have become filled in this way, imagine that the airfrom both of the side channels flows into the central channel. Swallow withoutmaking any sound and hold your breath. Press down the upper airs to theAH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra and simultaneously draw in the lower airsthrough the two lower apertures. Direct both of these [i.e., the upper and lowerairs] to the site of the AH-stroke mantric syllable.In this way the upper airs are pressed down, the lower drawn up, and the twobrought together in a kiss at the AH-stroke syllable of the navel chakra. Holdthe breath for as long as possible, pushing down and pulling up respectively onthe upper and lower airs as described above.When you can no longer hold the breath, release it gently and quietly throughthe nostrils. Gently exhale through the nose and imagine that it comes up thecentral channel.Here you should not visualize that the air leaves via the crown aperture [assome teachers advise], nor that the upper chakras, such as the heart and throat,are filled with it [as others suggest]. Instead simply concentrate on holdingthe airs at the AH-stroke mantric syllable [at the navel chakra] for as long asis comfortable.Gradually extend the time of breath retention in a natural and unforced way. Thekey to success is to naturally and gently increase your power to retain theairs.When skill in the vase breathing technique has become stabilized, engage in themethod in conjunction with visualizing the four mantric syllables at the centerof the chakras at the navel, heart, throat, and crown: AM,' HUM, OM, and HAM.The energies residing in the chakra at the secret place will gradually cause theAH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra, which is in nature the inner fire, toblaze with light and heat.This rises up the central channel and melts the other three syllables, HAM, OM,and HUM [respectively at the crown, throat, and heart chakras]. These melt andfall into the syllable AM [at the navel chakra], and the four become of oneinseparable nature.At this point you should keep the mind focused on the AM-stroke syllable at thenavel chakra, which has the nature of innate joy, and hold it there. Eventuallya tiny tongue of flame from the inner heat rises up the central channel, whereit melts the drop of white bodhimind substance abiding within the upper chakras.This drips down like nectar and falls into the AM-stroke mantric syllable at thenavel chakra. Meditate single-pointedly on the AM-stroke, until the signs ofprogress arise.Eventually your meditative stability in the practice will increase. The sign ofsuccess is that the radiance of the light from the inner fire begins to causethe inside and outside of your body, as well as your dwelling place and soforth, to seem to take on a special luster and radiance and to become astranslucent as a piece of kyurura held in the hand.'It is important during meditation sessions to keep the mind on the tiny radiantflame. This renders concentration more subtle and encourages quick and easyfulfillment of the meditative powers.How to Cause the Energies to Enter Into, Abide, and Dissolve Within the CentralChannelImmediately after completing a practice session as described above, check theway in which the airs are flowing through your nostrils. Then engage in thebodily postures and mental applications, and after some time again observe theflow of air. Draw in several breaths in order to see how evenly the air ispassing. Should it naturally flow evenly through both nostrils without any forcebeing exerted from your side, this is a sign that the strength of the yoga hasbrought you to the stage wherein the energies can be drawn into the centralchannel.The best sign is that, if there is no other obstruction, the airs flow throughboth nostrils, and the two flows are of equal strength, without one being strongand the other weak. This can be regarded as an omen that you have reached thestage at which the energies have begun to enter the central channel.Once the energies have entered the central channel you should continue tomeditate intensely. The breath will become increasingly subtle, until you willnotice that it has ceased moving altogether.Absorbing the energies into the central channel is easy for some practitionersand difficult for others. However, if you persist in the practice you willeventually begin to feel a sensation as though your solar plexus had becomefilled with air. The feeling may soon cease, but with persistence you willeventually feel the warmth from the residences of the inner fire in the naveland secret chakras. Fix your concentration on it. This will induce melting [ofthe substances] and an according experience of ecstasy.Some practitioners are unable to achieve the signs of progress in the absorptionof the energies into the central channel. This is usually a result of the factthat they have not yet eliminated subtle meditative torpor. This meditativeobstacle hinders progress in the training.For those who do not achieve proficiency in working with the energies at thecenter of the navel chakra, then even though they engage in the vase breathingtechnique and perhaps even draw the energies to the navel, the energies will notremain there and will dissipate to other sites. There is no movement of thebreath, but also no retention of the energies in the desired chakra. When thisis the case, there will be neither entering nor dissolving of the energies intothe central channel. You should watch closely for these subtle distinctions andnot mistake the stages of growth in the process.The Manner of Inducing the Four Blisses Once the Energies Have Been Drawn Intothe Central ChannelThe next step in the training, once the energies have been drawn into thecentral channel, involves the techniques for inducing the four blisses. This isaccomplished in three stages of practice: inducing the signs of success,together with igniting the inner fire; generating the four blisses by means ofmelting the bodhimind substances; and meditating on the innate wisdom.The first of these three stages, that for inducing the signs of success andigniting the inner fire, begins with focusing the mind at the center of thenavel chakra and bringing the life-sustaining energies into the central channel.This gives rise to five signs.First the earth energies dissolve into those of water. There is a vision likethat of a mirage of water seen in the desert heat. Next water dissolves intofire, and there is a vision like that of seeing smoke, somewhat like a vision ofwispy blueness. Fire dissolves into air, and there is a vision like seeingfireflies at night, or like red sparks. Then the energies on which theconceptual mind rides dissolve, and there is a vision like that of the light ofa butterlamp undisturbed by the movement of air. This energy then dissolves infour stages, each of which is likened to a sky of different colors, finallyculminating in the experience of clear light consciousness. This process will bediscussed later in the section on the clear light yoga, so I will not deal withit in more depth here.Inducing the experience of these signs, such as the mirage and so forth, is notthe actual method for bringing the energies into the central channel. However,working with them facilitates success in the practice. Usually they will arisein the order as described above, and be followed by the four sky-like signs.'When the signs arise due to the dissolutions and the process of bringing theenergies into the central channel, then all five, from the mirage to the skywithout clouds, will occur without interruption.The power of the inner heat can be experienced in various ways. For example, itmay arise from within the chakras at the navel and secret place and from therebe brought up the central channel. It can also arise and ignite outside thecentral channel. This latter experience may cause some melting of the bodhimindsubstances, as will be explained later; but the former process is what we wantto accomplish. The explanatory tantra known as The Vajramala Tantra puts it likethis,[../Images/page0117_0000.svg]Also The Mystic Kiss Tantra states,[../Images/page0117_0001.svg]Inducing the Four Blisses by Means of Melting the Bodhimind DropsThe descending blisses occur first as a result of the bodhimind substancelocated in the crown chakra being melted by the inner fire. They drip down, andwhen they arrive in each of the four chakras they give rise respectively to thefour descending blisses.When they arrive at the throat chakra, \"bliss\" is experienced. They leave thethroat chakra and arrive at the heart; the \"supreme bliss\" is experienced. Theyleave the heart chakra and arrive at the navel; the \"special bliss\" is aroused.Finally they leave the navel chakra and come to the chakra at the secret place,the tip of the jewel; the \"innate bliss\" is experienced.Then the ascending blisses are aroused. Here you have to bring the drops back upthe central channel and direct them through the chakras. As they move from thejewel chakra to the navel, \"bliss\" is experienced. They move from the navel tothe heart, and \"supreme bliss\" is induced. They move to the throat chakra, and\"special bliss\" is experienced. Finally, they move from the throat chakra to thecrown chakra, and \"innate bliss\" is aroused.When the melting of the bodhimind substances is accomplished on the basis ofhaving dissolved the energies into the central channel, then the drops can beretained at the tip of the jewel until the innate bliss is aroused.The drops should not be allowed to be ejaculated. This retention will only bepossible if the energy that causes ejaculation has been absorbed [into thecentral channel].In the beginning of the practice, in order to retain the drops in the jewelchakra and arouse the innate bliss, it is useful to visualize that the drops aredirected into the central channel. Engage in the energy practices gently untilthis ability is achieved. Don't overly exert force.Eventually you will be able to bring the drops back to the crown chakra. Correctmeditation on the process of diffusing them throughout the net work of channelsempowers you with total fluency in the process and enables you to reverse anddiffuse even a great melting of the drops.Also, if a strong experience of melting suddenly occurs and you are unable toaccomplish what is described above, then revert to the visualization of yourselfas being the mandala deity. Sit in the vajra posture, cross your hands in frontof your chest, wrathfully elevate the gaze of your two eyes, contract themuscles of your toes and fingers, place your mind on the mantric syllable HAM inthe crown chakra, the head of which now is seen as standing upright [unlike inthe usual visualization process], and wrathfully yet slowly recite the mantricsyllable HUM twenty-one times. Meditate that the drops are made to travel backup the central channel in front of the spine, and that they return to the crownchakra from where they descended. Then engage in a soft exercise of the vasebreathing technique and also shake your body gently. Meditate that the bodhimindsubstances are diffused throughout the appropriate sites of your channels.Repeat this process several times.Meditating on the Innate WisdomHere there are two trainings: that to be engaged during meditation sessions; andthat to be engaged between meditation sessions.Here is how to train during meditation sessions. Take the innate bliss thatarises from moving the drops downward, and also the innate bliss of theascending process, and direct it at meditation on emptiness. That is to say, atthis point in the training you should engage whatever knowledge of andexperience in the emptiness doctrine you have, and direct the innate bliss atit. Place the mind experiencing innate bliss in single-pointed focus on thenon-inherent nature of the self and phenomena, and meditate in this way withinthe sphere of inseparable bliss and emptiness. Those with little experience inthe emptiness doctrine should simply rest the mind in the experience of bliss.That alone is sufficient.At the conclusion of the meditation session you arise from your meditativeabsorption on the innate bliss. The training in the postmeditation periodsinvolves consciously cultivating mindfulness of the experience of bliss andemptiness conjoined. Seal all objects and events that appear and occur with theseal of bliss and emptiness. In this way the trainings in the meditationsessions and in the post-meditation periods support one another.In brief, through practice of the inner fire yoga you unite the vital energiesand invoke the four busses. This is to be conjoined with the technique ofmeditating on innate bliss focused on the wisdom of emptiness.Karmamudra, an External ConditionAll the authoritative tantric scriptures and treatises point out that thepractice of karmamudra is only to be performed by those who are qualified. Toengage in it on any other basis only opens the door to the lower realms. Thepractice itself should be learned from a qualified master holding the authenticoral tradition.The Illusory Body and Clear Light YogasThe teaching on the illusory body and clear light yogas involves two topics. Thefirst of these is a general discussion of how success in the inner heat yogasprepares the basis for engaging in the remaining stages of the path [i.e., theillusory body and clear light trainings]. The second is a presentation of themeditations of those two particular paths, namely the illusory body and clearlight doctrines.As for the general principles of these doctrines, here Marpa Lotsawa himselfsaid,[../Images/page0119_0000.svg]As Marpa points out here, the doctrines of the illusory body and clear lightyogas are based upon The Guhyasamaja Tantra. Moreover, these doctrines aretaught in detail in the Guhyasamaja tantric system known as the Arya Cycle,which is the transmission of Nagarjuna and his disciples, as elucidated in[Nagabodhi's] An Elucidation of the Summary of the Five Stages. As thattradition puts it, for as long as the vital energies have not been drawn intothe central channel, one will not be able to generate the samadhi of thethreefold experience of \"appearance,\" \"proximity,\" and \"proximate attainment\"that precedes the accomplishment of mind refinement; and it is from the state ofvital energies and consciousness that have generated the complete signs of thewisdom awareness of final mind refinement that the qualified illusory body canbe engaged. Similarly, the nature of the clear light doctrine should also beunderstood in reliance upon that same oral tradition teaching [i.e., AnElucidation of the Summary of the Five Stages].Prior to the stage wherein the qualified illusory body can be made manifest onemust give rise to the five signs. I discussed these in brief earlier. It wouldbe useful at this point to explain them in a bit more detail.The nature of the fully qualified illusory body is described in The Five Stages,[../Images/page0120_0000.svg]This passage refers to the yogic process in which the energies of the fourelements are withdrawn, giving rise to the four inner signs, such as the mirageand so forth. After that the three \"inner appearances\" leading up to theexperience of clear light consciousness manifest.After that has occurred, the clear light consciousness acts as thesimultaneously present condition, and the life-supporting energies of the bodyupon which the clear light consciousness rides act as the substantial cause.This transforms the primordial bodily force into the form of a divinity, theillusory body.Once you have produced this illusory body, it is certain that you will achievefull buddhahood in this lifetime. You discover a great space-like treasure andachieve a body-base that is immeasurable. As [Nagarjuna's] The Five Stages putsit,[../Images/page0120_0001.svg]And also,[../Images/page0120_0002.svg]Moreover, The Guhyasaniaja Tantra states,[../Images/page0120_0003.svg]The commentary known as The Clear Lamp [by Acharya Chandrakirti] explains thatthis passage means one's vajra body blazes with a great light that pervades theworld for more than a hundred yojanas and is adorned with the embellishments ofthe thirty-two signs of perfection.Prior to the realization of the fully characterized illusory body, you engage inthe inner heat meditation in order to draw the energies into the central channeland give rise to the innate bliss. You then arouse the resolution to manifestthe semblant clear light mind of utter emptiness, and by means of the energycontrol techniques arise in the form of a tantric deity.This is a semblant illusory body, and its causal condition is the semblant clearlight.Based on that accomplishment you engage in the three cycles of blending with thethree kayas: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya.\" This process isdescribed in [Nagarjuna's] The Five Stages as follows,[../Images/page0121_0000.svg][../Images/page0121_0001.svg][../Images/page0121_0002.svg]The significance of the above passages is given in An Elucidation of the Summaryof the Five Stages, wherein it is said,[../Images/page0121_0003.svg]The \"three blendings of death\" are explained as follows. During the waking stateone engages in the inner heat practices and gives rise to the four innervisions, known as \"the four emptiness experiences.\" The fourth of these is theexperience of clear light mind. Meditating on this clear light mind in thewaking state is known as \"death at the time of the path.\"Then when one goes to sleep the four inner visions known as \"the four emptinessexperiences\" naturally arise. When the fourth of these arises, which is theclear light of sleep, one meditates upon it. This is known as \"death at the timeof sleep.\"Similarly, at the time of actual death the four inner visions known as \"the fouremptiness experiences\" naturally arise. When the fourth of these arises, namelythe clear light of death, one meditates upon it. This is known as \"death at thetime of death.\"As for the three blendings of the bardo, these are explained as follows. Duringthe waking state one induces the dissolutions and experiences the fouremptinesses, the fourth being the clear light mind. After that, one engages theenergy control techniques in order to arise in the form of a tantric deity. Thisis known as \"the bardo of the path in the waking state.\"Then when one goes to sleep and the four emptiness experiences naturally occur,the fourth being the clear light mind, one engages the energy control techniquesand causes one's dream body to arise in the illusory Sambhogakaya form of thetantric deity. This is known as \"the bardo of dreams in the sleep state.\"Thirdly, at the time of death the elemental dissolutions naturally occur and thefour emptiness experiences arise, the fourth being clear light mind. After thatone enters the bardo. Here one applies the energy control techniques to causethe bardo body to transform into an illusory Sambhogakaya form of a tantricdeity. This is known as \"the bardo of becoming in the after-death state.\"Finally, the three blendings of rebirth are as follows. During meditationsessions in the waking state one controls the vital energies and molds them intothe form of a tantric deity. When one arises from this meditation and engages inactivities utilizing one's ordinary body that was born from ripened karma, onedoes so with awareness of oneself as a tantric deity, with the Nirmanakayaaspect established at the heart. This is known as \"rebirth as a path during thewaking state.\"During sleep one engages in the energy control practices, and in dreamstransforms the dream body into a Sambhogakaya form. When one begins to awakenfrom dream and sleep, and to enter back into one's ordinary body formed fromripened karma, one does so with awareness of one's body being the form of atantric deity, with the Nirmanakaya established at the heart. This is known as\"rebirth at the time of awakening from dreams.\"Thirdly, when one is in the after-death state and is about to take rebirth inwhichever of the four ways; one applies the energy control techniques andmeditates on taking birth as a tantric deity, with the Nirmanakaya establishedat the heart. This is known as \"rebirth at the time of completing theafter-life.\"Thus the experience of the clear light of the waking state, clear light ofsleep, and clear light of death are all taken as objects of meditation andtransformed into or \"blended\" with the Dharmakaya. Because all three areexperienced after the elemental dissolutions have occurred and the fourvisionary states known as \"the four emptiness experiences\" have transpired, justas occurs naturally at the time of death, each of these three clear lightexperiences is termed a \"death.\"Similarly, the illusory body of the waking state, the illusory body of dreams,and the illusory body of the bardo are all taken as objects of meditation andare transformed into or blended with the Sambhogakaya. Because all three ofthese can best be understood as analogous to the bardo body that is naturallyexperienced after death, the name \"bardo\" is applied to all three.Finally, the Nirmanakaya attained in the waking state, the Nirmanakaya meditatedupon at the moment of exiting from a dream just before waking up, and theNirmanakaya meditated upon at the completion of the bardo of death experiencejust before taking rebirth are best understood in relation to the manner inwhich one takes rebirth. Therefore each of the three is termed a \"rebirth.\"As for the term \"blending,\" here the manner of blending the three clear lightexperiences with Dharmakaya is explained as follows. During the waking state onecultivates the ability to dissolve the energies into the central channel andbring them to the heart chakra. This gives rise to the four emptinessexperiences, the fourth of which is the clear light consciousness. One remainsabsorbed in that clear light mind. Similarly, when one goes to sleep one engagesthe techniques for withdrawing the energies into the central channel at theheart chakra, and as sleep sets in one synchronizes one's meditation with thenatural process of the energy withdrawals. When the fourth emptiness experiencearises, which is the clear light mind of sleep, one focuses singlepointedly onit. Thirdly, one cultivates this practice throughout one's lifetime, and thenwhen the moment of death arrives uses the familiarity that has been gainedthrough working with the clear light minds of the waking and sleeping states.One follows the process of the withdrawal of the energies to the heart chakraand the arising of the four emptiness experiences. When the fourth of thesearises, which is that of the clear light of death, one focuses on itsingle-pointedly, just as one had done in the waking and sleeping states.The processes of the three blendings with Sambhogakaya and three blendings withNirmanakaya can be understood from what is said above.The meditation on the clear light of sleep is accomplished mainly by workingwith the chakras at the heart and throat. On the basis of proficiency in thisyoga one is enabled to engage in an undistorted practice of the yoga of dreamillusions. Approaching the practice [of dream yoga] from this perspective isindeed most praiseworthy.The stronger one's ability to withdraw the vital energies into the centralchannel during the waking state, the greater will be one's success in workingwith the clear light of sleep. When those in whom this ability has been maturedenter into sleep, they are able to work with the heart chakra in the centralchannel and to recognize and retain the fourth emptiness, that of the clearlight of sleep. This in turn enhances their ability to work with the vitalenergies during the waking state and to draw them into the central channel.Thus proficiency or lack of it in the techniques of working with the clear lightof sleep greatly affects the degree of strength and efficacy of one's daytimepractice and accordingly renders one's practice of this path [of the Six Yogasof Naropa] weak or strong.Moreover, if one does not manage to achieve supreme enlightenment in thislifetime, then there is the possibility of doing so at the moment of death bymeans of this practice [of working with the clear light of death]. This pathprovides a most unique method for recognizing the clear light of death. As themoment of death approaches, one engages the techniques for retaining the clearlight of death, based on the experience previously attained in the yogas of theclear light of sleep.Similarly, in the yogas of sleep and dream one learned to recognize the clearlight of sleep and then emerge in a dream body by means of recognizing theillusory body of dreams. Familiarity with that process amplified the strength ofone's illusory body training during the daytime practice, and stability in thedaytime practice of energy control amplified one's practice of dream yoga. If atthe time of the approach of death supreme enlightenment has not been achieved,what was accomplished in the waking and sleep states can be applied at the timeof death. Familiarity with the meditations of energy control and with the yogaof recognizing the clear light brought efficiency in working with the illusorydream body. That knowledge now helps in recognizing the illusory nature of thebardo experience and in transforming it accordingly.These are the general principles upon which the illusory body and clear lightdoctrines are based. Next there follows a discussion of those two individualdoctrines, namely the illusory body and clear light.The main purpose of all the high tantric teachings is to point out how we canmeditate on the illusory body and clear light doctrines at auspicious times inboth the sleeping and waking states. The underpinnings of the training, theyogas of energy control, have already been discussed. Once this foundation hasbeen established one should enter into the actual practice, i.e., themeditations for cultivating realization of the illusory body and the clearlight.The Illusory Body YogasThe illusory body yogas involve three main practices: how to meditate on allappearances as illusory; how to meditate on dream illusions; and how to meditateon the illusory nature of the bardo experience.All Appearances as IllusoryThe practice here begins by examining the sense of \"I\" that we all have.Examine this \"I\" to see if it is one with or separate from the psychophysicalaggregates.\"' Eventually you will develop a firm understanding that this \"I\" hasno self-existent nature whatsoever. This is the training on the emptiness side.However, the conventional existence of the self arises as an object of the mind.That is to say, we have the appearance of living beings as irrefutableconventional phenomena. There are collectors of karma and experiencers of theresults of karma. Even though nothing has a selfnature, all phenomenaconventionally function with validity according to the laws of interdependentarising. Cultivate a definite realization of how in this way all things areultimately empty of self-existence but nonetheless conventionally function withvalid presence.Sometimes these two levels of being may seem contradictory. To dispel thisillusion, contemplate the metaphor of an image reflected in a mirror. This willgenerate awareness of their non-contradictory nature. Consider how the reflectedimage of a face, including the eyes and so forth, are empty of existing in themanner of their appearance. Based on the presence of the actual image that isbeing reflected, as well as the mirror and the workings of light, the reflectionis created. When one takes away the supporting conditions, such as either theface or the mirror, the image disappears. The two phenomena are interdependent.The situation with all appearing phenomena is the same. For example, not asingle particle within a living being exists to represent a final self, yetliving beings collect karmic seeds, experience the results, and take rebirthsaccording to their previously collected karmic seeds and the presence ofspiritual distortions within themselves.Appreciate the non-contradictory nature [of emptiness and relativity] in thisway. As soon as you have achieved stability in this realization, extend thepractice to include all objects that appear to the mind. Take all forms asmanifestations of the deity; because these lack any self-existent nature, seethem as illusory appearances; and see the illusions as great bliss. Train inthese three awarenesses.Meditating on Dream IllusionsThis involves four trainings: learning to retain conscious presence duringdreams; controlling and increasing the content of dreams; overcoming fear indreams and training in the illusory nature of dreams; and meditating uponsuchness [i.e., emptiness] in dreams.In the first of these, retaining conscious presence during dreams, the principalmethod is that of the energy control that was gained by means of the inner heatyogas.The practice begins in the waking state, during which you should cultivate theability to bring the vital energies into the central channel and induce theexperience of the four emptinesses in order to gain familiarity with the fourthemptiness, which is that of the clear light mind. Then when you go to sleep,observe the natural process of the elemental energy dissolutions and the arisingof the four emptiness experiences. When the clear light of sleep arises,maintain awareness of it.If this is done, then when dreams occur there will be no difficulty inmaintaining conscious presence during them. No other method is required.A subsidiary method involves retaining conscious presence during dreams by meansof resolution. This is used by those who do not have the power of energy controland thus cannot recognize the clear light of sleep.Here one meditates upon oneself as the mandala deity, and also meditates uponthe guru and makes requests for blessings in the practice from him or her. Offerthe prayer, \"May I experience many dreams, may my dreams be clear andauspicious, may I retain conscious presence throughout my dreams, and may Ieffectively engage the special yogic applications in the dream state. May allnon-conducive conditions to these ends be eliminated, and may every conducivecondition manifest.\" You should also make torma offerings to the mandala deitiesand protector spirits, request their enlightened activity, and establish thelimits of the practice place.During the day you should continually make firm the strong resolution to beaware in the dream-state, and should combine this with the practice of repeatingto yourself the thought that whatever appears is like a dream appearance andshould be recognized as a dream. Also repeatedly cultivate the thought that whendreams occur you will recognize them and implement the dream yogas.A forceful method taught in the oral tradition that is to be practiced at nightis as follows. Just before going to sleep you should generate the vision ofyourself as the mandala deity, with your guru seated in the space above yourhead. Offer intense prayers to him for blessings to succeed in the practice.Then visualize that inside the central channel at your throat chakra is a smallred four-petalled lotus, with a small red mantric syllable OM, in nature thevajra speech, standing upon it. Maintain this visualization with clarity, notallowing the mind to lose it, and fall asleep within the sphere of retaining it.With this technique if you still fail to retain conscious presence in yourdreams, you should intensify your practice of energy control as explainedearlier. If you are still unable to succeed, then remember that sleep islightest following the period of dawn until after the sun has risen above theeastern mountains, and consequently it is easiest to accomplish dreams at thattime. Therefore engage the practice at that time. Perform guru yoga, offer manyprayers, and intensify the strong intent to recognize dreams when they occur.Visualize yourself as the tantric deity and imagine that there is a radiantwhite drop, the size of a mustard seed, between your eyebrows. Place the mind onit, perform the vase breathing technique seven times, and then go back to sleep.If you are unable to sleep well, or your sleep is too light or is disturbed, youshould cultivate conscious resolution during the day as described earlier. Thenwhen you get ready to sleep imagine a black drop at the center of your vajrajewel chakra. Place the mind on it for some time, and then unite the vitalenergies twenty-one times [through vase breathing]. Within that sphere, andwithout letting the mind stray, drop off to sleep.The second level of the dream yoga training involves controlling and increasingthe content of your dreams. Here you can engage in various transformativeexercises, such as consciously initiating a particular dream pattern or elsetransforming the nature of the dream altogether. Alternatively, you can projectyourself on the rays of the sun or moon to a celestial realm, such as theThirty-three Heaven, or to a faraway human realm, and see what is there. Youshould train in all the various activities, such as going to places, flyingthrough the sky, and so forth.You can also engage in visionary travel by projecting yourself to the variousbuddhafields, such as Sukhavati, Tushita, Akanishta, and so forth. There you canmeet with the buddhas and bodhisattvas, venerate them, listen to theirteachings, and engage in many other activities of this nature.As for the exercise of \"increasing the contents of dreams,\" this refers toincreasing the number of whatever appears in the dream. Whether thedream-objects are sentient beings such as humans or animals, or inanimateobjects such as pillars or vases, you simply multiply them from one to two, fromtwo to four, and so on, until hundreds and even thousands of the object appear.The third level of dream yoga practice is that of overcoming fear in dreams andtraining in the illusory nature of dreams. Here, whenever anything of athreatening or traumatic nature occurs in a dream, such as drowning in water orbeing burned by fire, recognize the dream as a dream and ask yourself, \"How candream water or dream fire possibly harm me?\" Make yourself jump or fall into thewater or fire in the dream. Examine the water, stones or fire, and remindyourself of how even though that phenomenon appears to the mind, it does notexist in the nature of its appearance. Similarly, all dream phenomena appear tothe mind but are empty of an inherently existent self-nature. Meditate on alldream objects in this way.You should train in seeing dream phenomena in this way and then in transformingthe dream world and its inhabitants into the supporting and supported mandala[i.e., residence and deities].This training also includes seeing all that is experienced in dreams as beingempty of a true self-nature yet manifesting as illusory appearances. Cultivatethe vision of how all phenomena are a drama of bliss and void: all appearancesarise as mandala and deities, these arise as illusions, and these illusionsarise in the nature of the wisdom of bliss and emptiness.The fourth level of the dream yoga training is that of meditating upon thesuchness of dreams. This stage of the practice can only be undertaken when thetraining in retaining conscious presence during dreams has become stable. Heremeditate upon yourself as the manifest radiant form of the mandala deity. Themantric syllable HUM shines with a great light from your heart. This light meltsthe animate and inanimate dream objects into light, which is absorbed intoyourself. Your body then also melts into light, from the head downward and feetupward, and is absorbed into the HUM at your heart. The HUM then melts intounapprehendable clear light. Rest the mind unwaveringly within this light.The Illusory Nature o f the BardoThis doctrine is taught under two headings: the qualifications of the beings whocan practice the bardo yogas; and the nature of the practice.The beings who can practice the bardo yogas are said to be of three types: best,medium, and least. The qualifications of the best candidates are described in[Aryadeva's] A Compendium of Tantric Experi- c►u'es. As that text puts it, thebest practitioners are thoroughly familiar with the process of energy control,the elemental dissolutions, the experience of the four emptinesses, and soforth. At the time of death they are able to follow the natural dissolution ofthe elemental energies all the way to the arising of the clear light mind ofdeath, and in the bardo can transform the illusory bardo body into the illusorybody of the third stage.\" From there they can achieve complete buddhahood in thebardo.The qualities of medium candidates for the practice are described in ACompendium of Tautric Experiences as follows,They apply themselves just as they had done in the yogas of sleep and dream,following the process of the dissolutions, and experiencing the states known asmind, thought, and unknowing. For a moment they lose awareness, and then emergein the unfabricated clear light consciousness. At that time the vital energiesmove, and they dream....The meaning is that the medium candidate for the practice has developed theability during his or her lifetime to recognize the four emptinesses of sleep,to apply the techniques of energy control when dreams arise, and thus to engagein dream yoga.The principle here is that if one is able to recognize the clear light of sleepduring one's lifetime practice, then at the time of death one will be able torecognize the clear light of the moment of death. Moreover, if one is able tocontrol the subtle energies in the dream state, one will be able to control themin the bardo. When the clear light of death arises one will recognize it; andwhen this clear light passes and one enters into the bardo, one will be able torecognize the bardo experience, control the subtle energies within it, andeffect the desired transformations.Candidates regarded as having the least qualification for practicing the bardoyogas are those who are stable in guarding the tantric commitments and have madesome progress in the generation and completion stage yogas. At the time of deaththey maintain whatever awareness they can throughout the process of theelemental dissolutions, beginning with the earth energies dissolving into thoseof water, and so forth, up to the emergence of the clear light mind of themoment of death. The clear light passes and they emerge into the bardo. Althoughthey have not developed fluency in the waking state practices of energy control,nor the power of sleep and dream yogas, they are sufficiently well versed in theoral transmission teachings and are able to recollect them at that importantmoment. Thus they engage in the bardo yogas on the strength of previousfamiliarity with the oral tradition teachings.As for the nature of the practice for these three types of candidates, here thebest trainees simply recognize the nature of the bardo body and then transformit into a Sambhogakaya form.For medium candidates, when the time of death comes they should maintain a clearstate of mind and distribute all their belongings and possessions to worthyrecipients in order to eliminate any grasping or attachments. Then they shouldconsciously acknowledge to themselves any transgressions of their practiceguidelines and commitments that occurred during their lifetime, as well as anygeneral spiritual failings, and purify and renew these. For their meditation,they should visualize themselves as the mandala deity and envision the guru andhost of mandala deities as coming into their presence. Then they should makeofferings and forcefully and repeatedly offer the prayer, \"Grant blessings thatI may be able to effect the blending of the clear light of death. Grantblessings that I may be able to effect the blending of the illusory bardo body.\"[At the time of death, certain] external and internal signs of the energydissolutions occur. First the earth element dissolves into the water element.The external sign is that one loses the ability to move one's limbs or controlthe body, and one has an appearance of total relaxation. There is a sensation asthough one's body were sinking into the earth. The inner sign is a vision havinga mirage-like quality. Next the water element dissolves into the fire element.The external sign is dryness of mouth and nose and a shrivelling of the tongue.The inner sign is a vision as though of smoke. The fire element now dissolvesinto the air element. The external sign is that one's body heat begins to drop,withdrawing from the extremities [toward the heart]. The inner sign is a visionlike that of seeing sparks or of seeing a cluster of fireflies.Next the air element of conceptual thought dissolves into mind. Here the vitalenergies that support conceptual thought dissolve into consciousness. Theexternal sign is that a long breath is exhaled and the body seems unable toinhale. Even if one can inhale, one does so shallowly yet heavily. The innersign is a vision of a light resembling that of a butterlamp undisturbed by windmovement.After this the first emptiness occurs, known simply as \"emptiness.\" This is theexperience of the vision known as \"appearance.\" The inner sign is of whiteness,like seeing moonlight in a cloudless sky. The consciousness of \"appearance\" thendissolves into the second emptiness, known as \"very empty.\" This is theexperience of the vision known as \"proximity.\" The inner vision is of ayellowish red light, like that of the light at sunrise. This dissolves into thethird emptiness, \"the great emptiness,\" which is linked to the experience of thevision known as \"proximate attainment.\" The inner vision is of utter darkness,like that of a night sky pervaded by thick darkness. The person has a sensationof swooning and loses consciousness. After this the person emerges from thedarkness and the state of mindlessness, and arises into the experience of \"utteremptiness,\" also termed \"the clear light.\" The vision is of a color like theblending of the lights of sun and moon in a sky free from all darkness, like theclear sky at early dawn. This is the clear light that is the actual basis.One should understand the stages of these elemental dissolutions and be aware ofthem as they occur. As each of the four signs manifests, such as the mirage andso forth, one should contemplate how neither the self nor phenomena have anytrue existence whatsoever. Again, as the experiences of the four emptinessesmanifest, together with the visions of a cloudless sky pervaded by moonlight,and so forth, one meditates on how neither the self nor phenomena have any trueexistence. Especially, when the fourth emptiness manifests with the sign of acloudless sky, which is the clear light mind in which the coarse sense ofduality is pacified, one attempts to recognize and remain in meditation on itfor as long as possible.Jetsun Milarepa stated, \"The clear light of death is the Dharmakaya; one onlymust recognize it as such. In order to be able to do so, one should beintroduced to it now by a supreme master. Cultivate an understanding of theessence of the view of the way things are, and train in the symbolic clear lightof the path.\"Here the words \"symbolic clear light of the path\" refer to the experience of theclear light consciousness on the two occasions: that which arises as the fourthemptiness experience as a result of tantric practice in the waking state [i.e.,the clear light consciousness invoked through the inner fire yogas]; and thatwhich is known as the fourth emptiness experience of the sleep process [i.e.,the clear light of sleep].The practitioner should conjoin the practice of the bardo yoga with a firmresolution by retaining the thought, \"As soon as I pass through the fourthemptiness of the death experience and enter into the bardo, I will arise in theillusory bardo body as my mandala deity.\"The ability to succeed in this practice very much depends upon the familiaritywith the illusory body trainings that was accomplished during one's lifetime inthe twofold practice of the illusory body of the waking state and the illusorybody of dreams. The principle here is that when one is in the bardo one engagesthe same type of meditations that were previously cultivated-the waking statepractice of seeing all appearances as an illusion and the dream-time practice ofobserving dream illusions.The practice here involves taking everything that manifests in the bardoexperience and transforming it into the supporting and supported mandalas bymeans of one's meditation. One contemplates how all the things that appear areempty of true existence, yet nonetheless manifest in an illusory manner as realphenomena; and one observes how the illusory appearances arise in the nature ofinseparable bliss and emptiness.You can also make a strong aspiration to be reborn in a buddhafield.Alternatively, if you are in possession of the instructions on consciousnesstransference, you can apply these techniques at this point.These are the methods to be utilized by the practitioner of mediumqualification.The third type of practitioners [i.e., the least qualified] should try toproceed in much the same way as did the medium practitioner described above.Should they have the good fortune to pass away in a clear state of mind, theyshould without any regrets distribute all their belongings and possessions toworthy recipients, consciously acknowledge to themselves any transgressions oftheir practice guidelines and commitments that occurred during their lifetime,as well as any general spiritual failings, and then purify and renew these.Then they should visualize themselves as the mandala deity, meditate that theguru and host of mandala deities come into their presence, offer devotions tothem, and forcefully and repeatedly offer the following prayer, \"Grant blessingsthat I may be able to effect the blending of the clear light of death. Grantblessings that I may be able to effect the blending of the illusory bardo body.\"Practitioners who are in this category should not wait until death befalls themto begin the bardo yoga. During their lifetime they should continually strive tofamiliarize themselves with the signs of the four elemental dissolutions andfour emptiness visions, and cultivate the habit of observing how the self andphenomena are empty of true existence yet manifest as illusions. They shouldmake a strong resolution that after the clear light of death passes they willgain realization in the bardo, and they should meditate on the three circles:how everything manifests as illusions, how the illusions manifest as supportedand supporting mandalas, and how these arise in the nature of bliss andemptiness.This practice should be coupled with the strong aspiration to achieve rebirth ina buddhafield.The Clear Light YogasTraining in the clear light doctrines involves two main practices: how to trainin the waking state; and how to train in the clear light of sleep.Working With the Clear Light of the Waking StateThe actual practice of the clear light yogas is intended for those who haveachieved the basis of a qualified illusory body experience or a proxy of it.Here visualize yourself as the mandala deity, male and female in sexual union.The \"wheel of truth\" chakra is at your heart with the central channel runningthrough it. A blue mantric syllable HUM stands on a sun disk located there.Lights emanate from this and purify the inanimate universe. The universe meltsinto clear light, which absorbs into the animate universe. These then melt intoclear light and into yourself as the mandala deity. The female aspect melts intothe male of the mandala deity.Then from your crown downward and feet upward you melt into light, which isabsorbed into the syllable HUM at your heart.The syllable HUM then melts into light from the bottom upward, beginning withthe U vowel underneath melting into the AH, that into the HA, that into itshead, that into the crescent moon above, that into the drop, and that into thenada above it.In this way everything is absorbed into the center of the central channel at theheart chakra. Hold your mind firmly there.Meditating in this way for a prolonged period will eventually induce theexperiences of the four emptinesses, the fourth of which is the \"waking-stateclear light of the path.\" Without wavering, place awareness on it.The methods for cultivating the clear light are taught in detail in theGuhyasamaja Tantra.Working With the Clear Light of SleepJust as proficiency in the waking state yogas of energy control is the supremecondition for success in the practice of working with dreams, so again hereenergy control is the best qualification for someone who wishes to engage in theprocess of working with the clear light of sleep.The practice as transmitted in the instructions of the lineage gurus isexplained as follows.Begin by making offerings to the Three Jewels, perform torma offerings to theDharma Protectors, and send forth the prayer, \"May I recognize the clear lightof sleep, and may all obstructions to success in the practice be eliminated.\"Meditate on yourself as being the mandala deity, meditate on guru yoga, and sendforth many prayers for blessing power to assist in the effort to retain theclear light of sleep. Generate a strong resolution that you will not slip intodreams, but instead will recognize the four emptinesses of sleep.As you prepare to go to sleep, lie on your right side in the posture of thesleeping lion,12 with your head to the north, face to the west, and your rightarm tucked underneath your body. Visualize yourself as the mandala deity andenvision a blue four-petalled lotus at your heart chakra, the central channelrunning through it, a blue mantric syllable HUM at its center. Meditate uponthis syllable as though your mind had become utterly blended with it and then goto sleep.If during the waking state you have cultivated the ability to induce theexperience of the four elemental dissolutions and four emptinesses by means ofthe inner heat yoga, then doing the above practice at the time of going to sleepwill produce the desired results. The energies will enter the central channeland you will recognize the clear light of sleep.Some practitioners lack the ability to draw the energies into the centralchannel and induce the experience of the four emptinesses during the wakingstate. They should apply a general samadhi free from torpor and on that basis atthe time of going to sleep should engage in the meditations explained above.Alternatively, during the waking state they can cultivate that samadhi and thenwhen going to sleep can direct it in mindfulness of the dissolution process.However, the clear light of sleep experienced in this way will not be the fullyqualified clear light as described in the tantric treatises. Even if the samadhiis directed at awareness of the view of suchness, it will still only be anexperience of the clear light as taught on the common path. It is not the clearlight consciousness induced by highest yoga tantra.The techniques for working with the clear light of sleep are discussed in detailin [Aryadeva's] A Compendium of Tantric Experiences.Next follows a discussion of the auxiliary practices of the Six Yogas path,namely, the yogas of consciousness transference and forceful projection.The Yoga of Consciousness TransferenceThe oral tradition of the gurus teaches the practice of consciousnesstransference yoga as follows.Visualize yourself as the mandala deity and bring the vital energies into a kissat either the secret place or the navel chakra. Imagine a red AH-stroke syllableat the navel chakra, a dark blue HUM at the heart chakra, and a white KSHA atthe crown aperture.Now pull up forcefully on the vital energies from below. These strike theAH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra, which rises and strikes the HUM at yourheart. This rises and strikes the KSHA at your crown.Then reverse the process. Pull the HUM back down to the heart chakra, and the AHback down to the navel chakra.Apply yourself to this training until the signs of accomplishment manifest.These include phenomena such as a small blister appearing on the crown of thehead, a sensation of itching, and so forth.When the time comes for the actual application [i.e., at the time of death],place the body in the tsig-bn position, with the two arms wrapped around theknees. Take refuge in the Three Jewels, generate the universalist bodhisattvaattitude, and then meditate upon yourself as being the mandala deity.From within this sphere visualize your root guru, in aspect inseparable from[i.e., appearing in the form of] your meditational deity. He manifests in thespace in front of your forehead and is roughly an armspan or half an armspan indistance from you. Offer strong heartfelt prayers to him.Then focus on the three mantric syllables: the red AH-stroke at your navelchakra; the blue HUM at your heart chakra, and the white KSHA at your crown.Pull up forcefully on the energies from below. This causes the AH-strokesyllable to spin up the central channel from the navel chakra. It melts into theHUM at the heart chakra. Recite the mantra AH-HIK many times. The HUM syllablemoves up the central channel. Recite the mantra AH-HIK twenty-one times; thiscauses it to continue up to the throat chakra.Turn your attention to the syllable KSHA at the mouth of the Brahma aperture [atthe crown]. It is as though silhouetted against a background of pure whitesky-like light, like an object in a roof window. Recite AH-HIK forcefully fivetimes. This causes the syllable HUM to shoot out the Brahma aperture and meltinto the heart of the guru inseparable from the mandala deity. Rest the mindthere in the state of beyond-conceptuality awareness.This is the method taught by the gurus of the lineage.The sixth and final yoga is that of forceful projection of consciousness intoanother body. I will not deal with it here, as it is an extremely secretpractice.\"This completes my compilation of the quintessential instructions on how to takeinto one's hands the stages of visualization and meditation associated with theprofound path known as the Six Yogas of Naropa.[../Images/page0136_0000.svg][../Images/img0006.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN KEY: A PROFOUND GUIDE TO THE SIX YOGAS OF NAROPATib.

During his lifetime he was informally regarded as thereincarnation of a number of important Gelukpa monks, including Gyalwa Wensapa,the author of the text translated in Chapter Four. However, he was neverenthroned as a reincarnate, but simply rose to his position of greatness due tohis personal spiritual charisma, his talents as a teacher, and his popularity asa writer.Panchen Lobzang Chokyi Gyaltsen served as the tutor to the young Fifth DalaiLama, and after the Fifth Dalai Lama became the spiritual and temporal leader ofTibet in 1642 he showed great respect to his guru. He gave him Tashi Lhunpo, themonastery that had been built by the First Dalai Lama two centuries earlier,with the instruction that his future incarnations should be enthroned andeducated there. Thus Tashi Lhunpo Monastery became the hereditary seat of thesubsequent Panchen Lamas, and this is still the case today. The Seventh PanchenLama passed away in 1989 in Tashi Lhunpo.'From that time until the present century the Panchen and Dalai Lamas have beenknown in Tibetan as Yab Sey (Tib. yab sres), or \"Father and Son,\" with whicheverof the two is the older serving as the guru to the younger in their subsequentstring of reincarnations.Jey Sherab Gyatso, the author of the text translated in Chapter Three,commented,The two most clear and concise manuals on the manner of meditating on the innerheat are those by the Second Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Gendun Gyatso, and the FirstPanchen Lama, Panchen Chogyen. One should meditate in accordance with theirinstructions, for they present the tradition embodied in Tsongkhapa's A Book ofThree Inspirations in a most wonderful and practical manner.The present chapter contains a translation of the second of these two works,that by Panchen Chokyi Gyaltsen, or, as Jey Sherab Gyatso calls him, PanchenChogyan, \"Ornament of the Dharma.\"Jey Sherab Gyatso recommends it for its treatment of the inner heat yoga.However, it is perhaps even more important for its treatment of powa, or theyoga of consciousness transference at the time of death, as it goes into thispractice in considerable detail. Because this yoga is applied at the time ofdeath, I have placed this work at the end of this collection."},{"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN KEY: A PROFOUND GUIDE TO THE SIX YOGAS OF NAROPAby Panchen Lobzang Chokyi GyaltsenHomage to Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.[../Images/page0142_0000.svg]THE PRELIMINARY TRAININGSThose who wish to enter into the practice of the tradition everywhere famed asthe Six Yogas of Naropa should begin by training their minds in the common paths[i.e., the Sutrayana methods].' After that they should receive the four completeinitiations into an appropriate auuttara-tantra system, such as eitherChakrasamvara or Hevajra. The Mark of Mahainudra states,[../Images/page0142_0001.svg]As said here, one should receive the appropriate empowerments before enteringinto tantric practice. In addition, one should then guard the precepts andcommitments taken at the time of initiation, just as one would guard one's life.The Root Tantra of Heruka Chakrasamvara states,[../Images/page0143_0000.svg]Thus the trainee receives initiation, guards the precepts and commitments of thetantric path, and then takes up the mandala meditations of the generation stageyogas. The generation stage practice should embody the complete process oftaking the three occasions-death, intermediate state and rebirth-as the threeenlightenment kayas: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya.' Arya Nagarjunaput it this way,[../Images/page0143_0001.svg]All highest yoga tantra systems are similar in this respect. They all advocateaccomplishing maturity in the generation stage mandala meditations beforeentering into the completion stage practices.The early masters in the Six Yogas tradition also advocated several specialpreparatory trainings: meditating on refuge and bodhisattva perspective; theVajrasattva meditation and mantra recitation; and the practice of guru yoga,together with the mandala offering. One should engage in these with intensefeelings of devotion and supplication for blessings.;THE ACTUAL PRACTICEAlthough there are various ways of categorizing the methods taught in the SixYogas, The Vajra Song of the Six Yogas of Naropas speaks of them as follows:inner heat; illusory body; clear light; consciousness transference; the bardoyogas; and projection into another residence. These six embody the essence ofboth the male and female tantras.Jey Marpa Lotsawa sang the following verse,[../Images/page0143_0002.svg][../Images/page0144_0000.svg]As stated above, the teachings on the inner heat yoga in the Six Yogas traditionare derived from the Hevajra Tantra, which is a female tantra system. ElsewhereMarpa sang,[../Images/page0144_0001.svg]Thus Marpa himself states that the illusory body and clear light yogas arederived from the Gnhyasamaja Tantra, which is a male tantra system.Finally, the yogas of consciousness transference and projection into anotherresidence are based on The Chaturpita Tantra and The Mystic Kiss Tantra.[Nagabodhi's] Elucidation of the Summary of the Five Stages states,[../Images/page0144_0002.svg]The meaning of this passage is that one engages in the yogas of energy control,such as the vajra breath repetition and so forth as taught in the GnhyasamajaTantra and other such systems, until eventually the experience of the clearlight consciousness known as \"final mind isolation\" is induced. This achievementdepends upon one first achieving proficiency in the inner heat yoga as taught inthe Hevajra and Chakrasamvara systems, by means of which one induces the fourblisses-both the four descending' and four ascending blisses-and thus inducesthe experience of the semblant clear light consciousness that arises togetherwith the innate bliss.This is the case in both the Six Yogas of Naropa and the Six Yogas of Niguma.Therefore in both of these traditions it is said that the inner heat yoga is thefoundation stone and life-tree of all the completion stage practices.Jey Naropa sang a song to Marpa Lotsawa,[../Images/page0144_0003.svg][../Images/page0145_0000.svg]Anyone who wishes to engage in the inner heat yogas should take up residence ina quiet and pleasant place. Sit on a meditation cushion in the seven-pointposture, or else wear a meditation belt and sit with legs crossed accordingly.Begin the session by clarifying the breath and bodily energies.\" Then meditateon guru yoga as a preliminary, recite verses of refuge to the spiritual master,and then offer strong prayers that your energies may remain blissful and energychannels supple, and that you may give rise to special realization of blissfulinner heat.As a final preliminary, generate the bodhisattva motivation by meditating on thethought, \"For the benefit of all living beings I will achieve completebuddhahood in this very lifetime, and for this purpose now enter into meditationon the inner heat yoga.\" Meditate in this way until your mindstream becomestotally infused with the bodhisattva aspiration.When these preliminaries have been completed, generate the vision of yourselfeither as Vajrayogini, with your body red in color, or else as HerukaChakrasamvara, with your body as blue as lapis lazuli. Envision your form asbeing utterly empty of substance, like an inflated balloon. It is bothtransparent and radiant, like a rainbow in the sky.Inside one's body are the three energy channels. Firstly one visualizes thecentral channel, known as avadhuti. It runs up and down the center of the bodyjust in front of the spine, and resembles a somewhat large and hollow wheatstraw or reed. As for the color of this energy channel, The Samputa Tantrastates that when the inner heat is being ignited it should be seen as being thecolor of the flame of a lamp burning sesame seed oil; before the inner fire hasbeen aroused, however, it should be seen as being light blue.To its right is the channel rasana, which is red in color, and to its left isthe channel lalana, white in color. They begin at a point four finger-widthsbelow the navel and run upward toward the crown in the manner of a centralpillar supporting the house of the body.At their base the two side channels curve and flow into the central channel.Located at that point is the multicolored navel chakra, known as \"the wheel ofemanation,\" with sixty-four channel petals.At the heart the channels form a knot, and there one envisions \"the wheel oftruth\" chakra, white in color, with eight channel petals. Again at the throatthey form a knot, and there one visualizes \"the wheel of enjoyment\" chakra, redin color, having sixteen channel petals. Finally again at the crown they form aknot, and there one visualizes \"the wheel of great bliss\" chakra, white incolor, having thirty-two channel petals.The Samputa Tantra states,[../Images/page0146_0000.svg]The meaning is that the two sets represent method and wisdom combined, just asdoes the Sanskrit word E-vam.Their shape is such that the petals of the navel chakra flow upward and those ofthe heart chakra flow downward, as though the two chakras are reaching out toembrace one another. Similarly, those of the throat chakra flow upward, andthose of the crown chakra flow downward, as though reaching toward one anotherin an embrace.This manner of visualizing the three energy channels and four chakras is inaccordance with the teaching of the Indian mahasiddha Lawapa, and is thetechnique advocated [by Lama Tsongkhapa] in A Book of Three Inspirations.After this one places the mantric syllables in the chakras. This is done astaught in the Hevajra Tantra.Here one focuses the mind at the very center of the central channel at the sitesof the four chakras. At each of these, standing on a moon cushion the size of asmall pea cut-in- half, is a mantric syllable.At the crown chakra is a white syllable HAM, its head pointed downward [i.e.,standing upside down]; at the throat chakra is a white OM, its head pointedupward; at the heart is a blue or mercury-colored HUM, its head pointeddownward; and at the navel is the AH-stroke syllable, its head pointed upward.-- - - - -- - - - - - - - --All four of these syllables are the size of mustard seeds, and all have theirheads adorned with a crescent made of the three symbols: a half moon, a drop,and a nada [zigzag line].The nadas on the syllables AH and OM [which are standing upright] are hot andred, as though about to burst into flame. From the nadas of the other twosyllables [which are standing upside down] bodhimind substances drip down, likedewdrops falling from above, or like small spiders descending down from theirthreads.Envision all these syllables as being intensely bright. Keep the mind fixedfirmly on them. Avoid the two obstacles of mental torpor and agitation, andmeditate on them single-pointedly.In general you should focus your attention on all four syllables, although inthe early stages of practice you should pay special attention to the AH-strokesyllable at the navel.When familiarity with this meditation has produced stability in the practice,engage in the vase breathing technique in rotation. The manner of doing so is asfollows.First turn your attention to the point below the navel chakra where the two sidechannels curve into the central channel. Then observe the upper sites of thechannels, and how the central channel comes to a point between the [upperapertures of your] nostrils, with the two side channels terminating at the[upper apertures of the] nostrils.The vase breathing is then done in four stages: inhaling, filling, dissolving,and releasing like an arrow.Here the breath is not inhaled through the mouth, but is drawn in gently throughthe two nostrils. This is the first step. Secondly the two side channels areseen as becoming completely filled, like balloons inflated with air. Thirdly theair in the two side channels is seen as entering into the central channel. Itdissolves into the AH-stroke syllable slowly, until the two side channels areemptied. The dissolution is gradual, like water poured onto sand slowly isabsorbed into the sand. This is the process of dissolving.At this point in the technique one swallows, and presses down with the upperenergies while gently pulling up the lower energies from below. Both [upper andlower energies] dissolve into the AH-stroke syllable. Meditate that mind andenergy become inseparably one with the AH-stroke syllable. The Arising ofSamvara Tantra states,[../Images/page0147_0000.svg]Retain the breath and energies in this way [at the navel chakra] for as long asdiscomfort does not set in. Then release the breath gently through the nostrils,visualizing that the energies rise and swirl up the central channel. This is thefourth step, called \"releasing like an arrow.\"As this yoga becomes stable the power of the inner heat is gradually ignited.The syllables at the heart and throat are melted and scorched, and the HAMsyllable at the crown begins to drip bodhimind drops, which descend through thechakras.In this way the AH and HAM respectively blaze and drip, giving rise to the fourblisses in consecutive and then reverse orders [i.e., descending and ascending],until eventually great bliss is aroused.This mind of great bliss is then focused single-pointedly in meditation uponemptiness. The mind and energies are repeatedly brought to one point in thisway, and the energies are directed to the mouth of the central channel andcaused to enter, abide and dissolve, until eventually the consciousness of thesemblant clear light manifests.One abides in this semblant clear light, and when the time comes to arise fromit one sets the resolve to arise in the form of Heruka and Consort in sexualunion. In this way one enters back into the coarse aggregates, seeing them as aNirmanakaya with the Jnanasattva9 at one's heart, and cultivates thebetween-sessions yoga.In case the yogi is not able to achieve complete realization of all the stagesleading to enlightenment before death arrives, he or she meditates on the HUM atthe heart in the sleeping state and uses this for preparing for the deathexperience, meditating single-pointedly upon the clear light of sleep and theillusory nature of dreams. This is the practice known as \"blending sleepexperience and death experience.\"Practicing in this way, engage the blending of the three kayas in both wakingand sleeping states.When the practice has developed stability and you have arrived at the pointwhere the knots constricting the heart chakra are ready to be released, take upthe practice of karmamudra with a qualified sexual consort, with you being therelier and the consort being the reliedupon, until the energies that support thefinal semblant clear light arise in the actual form of Heruka. [Nagarjuna's] TheFive Stages describes the experience thus,[../Images/page0148_0000.svg]The meaning of this passage is that the illusory samadhi is taken to completefulfillment.The illustrious Naropa said to Marpa Lotsawa,[../Images/page0149_0000.svg]The practitioner takes the illusory yoga to fulfillment, and eventuallyperceives the signs of the eradication of all spiritual distortions, togetherwith their seeds. He or she relies on the inner conditions of the energy yogasand the outer conditions of a sexual consort, and thus causes the inner andouter signs of enlightenment to manifest. This is the experience of the actualclear light. Jey Naropa sang to Marpa Lotsawa,[../Images/page0149_0001.svg]From the uncontaminated energy and consciousness that support this mind ofactual clear light arises the vajra body of great union, on the basis of whichthe resultant state of full buddhahood in the form of a Vajradhara endowed withthe seven excellent qualities is achieved.THE AUXILIARY TRAININGSThus in the tradition of the Six Yogas of Naropa it is said that the mainpractices are those of the inner heat, illusory body, and clear light yogas; theremaining three yogas-consciousness transference, forceful projection intoanother body, and the bardo yogas-are but branches of the path.The idea is that if one is not able to accomplish all the practices leading toenlightenment before death comes to destroy one's bodyvessel, then in order tofulfill the purposes of oneself and others one engages the yogas of eitherconsciousness transference or projection into another body. Alternatively, ifone is unable to effect this transference, or if one wishes instead to attemptto accomplish final enlightenment in the bardo, then there is the doctrine ofthe bardo yogas.From among these three, these days it is most important to know theconsciousness transference yoga.The Song of Naropa reads,[../Images/page0150_0000.svg]The techniques for closing the eight undesirable passageways wherebyconsciousness leaves the body at the time of death, and for opening thedesirable passageway, are drawn from tantric traditions such as The ChaturpitaTantra, The Mystic Kiss Tantra, and so forth. Omniscient Tsongkhapa the Greatexplains the quintessential instructions of these techniques in his A PowaCommentary: The Golden Key.The basic structure of that process is as follows. One begins by taking refugein the Buddhas, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and then generating the bodhichittamotivation. This can be done in conjunction with the standard verses or anyalternative liturgy. Consecrate the inner offering substances and also thegeneral offerings in accordance with the standard processes used in highest yogatantra.Then visualize yourself as Jnana Dakini, a multicolored lotus bearing a moondisc at your heart. Upon this stands the syllable HUM. It sends a flood of redbeams of light into all directions, which hook and call back myriad JnanaDakinis inseparable from the guru, surrounded by a host of buddhas,bodhisattvas, dakas, and yoginis. The light rays dissolve into your heart.Then recite the verse of praise,[../Images/page0150_0001.svg]Next make the offerings in the standard manner: OM SARVA TATHAGATA ARGHAM, andso forth, until SHAPTE. Offer the inner offering by means of the three seedsyllables, and then recite the praise:[../Images/page0151_0000.svg]Now make firm the bodhisattva resolve and meditate on the four immeasurablethoughts of love, compassion, rejoicing in goodness, and equanimity for allliving beings. The merit field is delighted and dissolves into you.Now meditate on the following sadhana. As usual, begin with the emptinessmantra-OM SHUNYATA JNANA VAIRA SVABHAVA ATMAKO NYA HAM: All dharmas, being emptyof inherent existence, are seen as emptiness.From within the sphere of emptiness there appears a vajra base, tent, canopy,and mountain of fire. At the center of this is a multicolored lotus bearing amoon disc, and on this stands the mantric syllable HUM, white in color. Lightsemanate from HUM, fulfill the twofold purpose, and absorb back [into HUM].There is complete transformation, and instantly you appear as Jnana Dakini, yourbody white as the kunda flower. You have three faces, each of which has threeeyes. The main face is white and is laughing; the right is black and wrathful;and the left is red, with an expression that is both arrogant and lustful.You have six arms, of which the three hands on the right hold an arrow, a hook,and a vajra, and the three on the left hold a bow, a club made of wood from thewish-fulfilling tree, and the threatening mudra at the heart. You areembellished with all the jewelled ornaments, such as the crown and so forth, andare dressed in exquisite raiments. You are in the warrioress posture, with awhite OM at your crown, a red AH at your throat, and a blue HUM at your heart.Lights emanate from the HUM at your heart and summon the Wisdom Beings in theform of Jnana Dakini, and also summon the Initiation Beings. JAH HUM BAM HOH:the Wisdom Beings become one with the Samaya Being; the Initiation Beings grantempowerment; Akshobya Buddha becomes your crown ornament.Then make the offerings with the standard mantra, as follows: OM JNANA DAKINISAPARIWARAARGHAM [and so forth until] SHAPTE. Also make the inner offering, andrecite the following verse of praise,[../Images/page0152_0000.svg]Then from within the sphere of visualizing yourself as Jnana Dakini, focus onthe three energy channels, together with the four or five chakras. At the pointwhere the central channel terminates at either the navel or secret chakraenvision the AM-stroke mantric syllable. It is red in color, is extremely hot,and is blazing with the fire of inner heat.Red lights emanate forth from it and fill your body, from the crown of your headto the soles of your feet, and draw all the vital energies back to it, likesmoke from Chinese incense drawn by a draft. It absorbs into the AM-strokesyllable at your navel chakra.Next perform the exclusively tantric form of the vase breathing exercise andestablish control over both mind and energy.At the same time, focus on the syllable KSHAM, which is at the mouth of theupper aperture, its head inverted. Below it is a HUM, its head inverted. Betweenthe eyebrows is a HUM, its head pointed inward. Inside that is a syllable HAM,its head inverted. At the root of the tongue is a syllable SUM, its head pointedinward. Beside it, in the throat aperture, is the syllable SMRYUM, its headinverted. On the pupil of each of the two eyes is a syllable HUM; on the doorsof the two nostrils and two ears stand syllables of YAM, their heads pointinginward. At the navel, and also at the doors of excrement and urine, is asyllable KSHMRYAM, its head pointing upward. All of these mantric syllables arewhite in color and emanate forth extremely thick white light. Meditate that inthis way all the bodily apertures are completely blocked off.Also, on each of your shoulders as armor is a syllable HMRYUM, and at your heartis a syllable YMRYUM.After that has been done, concentrate on the inside of the heart chakra, theenergy petals of which stretch downward. At that site envision a half moon,which represents the life energy.Inside of it, in nature your own consciousness, is a syllable HUM, its headpointed downward. Above and outside of it are two syllables of YUM, a syllableHI standing between them. Below and outside the HUM are also two syllables ofYUM, this time with the letter KA between them. All seven of these mantricletters are blue in color and stand with their heads pointed downward [i.e., areinverted].Meditate on this visualization and then engage in the special vase breathingmethod. As you exhale the breath, imagine that light from the AM-stroke syllableat your navel blazes up the central channel and comes to your heart chakra,where it arouses the life energy, carrying the chakra, together with its mantricsyllable, upward to your crown. The HI and KA letters, previously seen as beingrespectively above and below the inverted HUM syllable now reverse positions,with the HI below and the KA above. As you inhale, the cluster of mantricsyllables is drawn back down to the heart chakra, where they appear aspreviously described.Repeat this meditation again and again in conjunction with the vase breathingtechnique, until signs of accomplishment appear. This is how one prepares theconsciousness transference passage during one's lifetime by means of practice.Then when one arrives at the end of one's life and the time of death is at hand,one should distribute one's worldly possessions among worthy recipients andplace the mind in a sphere free from attachment and aversion. Make offerings tothe dakas, dakinis, and dharmapalas and request blessings that no obstacles mayarise.Visualize that your mandala deity, who is an embodiment of the Three Jewels andis inseparable in nature from your spiritual master, appears in the space infront of you, or above the crown of your head, whichever is easier for you.Offer the seven-limbed devotion, and make the prayer to be guided to the dakinipure lands or to take rebirth as a vidyadhara.\"' Perform the special method forapplying the vase breathing at the heart chakra, and recite the syllables HI-KAtwenty-one times. Mind and vital energy, in the form of the cluster of sevensyllables visualized at the heart, shoot like a falling star to the heart of themandala deity inseparable from the guru.This method of effecting consciousness transference is said to be superior toall others. Its beneficial effects are described in The Vajradnka Tantra,[../Images/page0153_0000.svg]With that I will close this treatment of the quintessential points in thepractice of the profound instruction known as the Six Yogas of Naropa.[../Images/page0154_0000.svg][../Images/page0154_0001.svg]The colophon: This brief treatise for opening a hundred doors leading into theprofound path of the Six Yogas of Naropa was written by the Buddhist monkLobzang Chokyi Gyaltsen, a holder of an ocean of lineages in both the sutra andtantra traditions, at the repeated request of the hermit meditator and monkRi-tropa Gendun Gyaltsen."},{"pageContent":"NOTESTranslator's Introduction1. Jey Sherab Gyatso refers to these two texts by slightly different names inChapter Three: \"The textual source of the Six Yogas tradition is the twofoldcollection known as The Two Kargyupa Scriptures (Tib. bKa' rgyud pa ka dpegnyis).\" To the best of my knowledge, these have not been openly published andare considered to be extremely secret.2. The word used for \"generation\" here does not mean a fixed period of time, butrather refers to thirteen stages in the lineage transmission, i.e., thirteengenerations of lineage masters. Each generation dates from the death of onelineage master until the death of his chief disciple. Thus some generations werelong and others short, depending upon the lifespan of the individual masters.3. This of course is just one version of the lineage of transmission, namely,the manner in which it came to Lama Tsongkhapa and the Geluk school. Thelineages as preserved in, for example, the Karma Kargyu and Pakmo Drupa Kargyuschools would only be the same in the early generations, until the time ofGampopa. After Gampopa the transmission was carried in many different lineages;each of the four older and eight younger Kargyu schools would have its ownlineage from that time onward, passed through the generations of masters oftheir individual sects.4. The story of how Marpa Lotsawa received these various tantric transmissionsis wonderfully told in his Tibetan biographies. Several of these have beentranslated into in English. The most extensive is The Life of Marpa theTranslator (Boulder: Prajna, 1982), translated by the Nalanda TranslationCommittee.5. Milarepa says, \"First establish the basics, such as Refuge in the ThreeJewels, the two aspects of the enlightenment mind-aspirational and engaged-andso forth.\" His simple words are instructions to cultivate the basic Buddhistfoundations. Refuge in the Three Jewels-the Buddhas, the Dharma and theSangha-means that one has understood one's basic situation and turned one's lifeto the spiritual path.The two bodhiminds-aspirational and engaged-refer to the inner Mahayanaperspective. The former is the aspiration to achieve enlightenment as an act oflove and compassion for all living beings; the latter refers to cultivating thesix perfections-generosity, discipline, gentleness, joyous energy, meditationand wisdom-in order to bring that aspiration to fruition.6. The oral instruction transmission for achieving liberation in the bardo (Tib.bar do 'phrang sgrol gyi man ngag). This name was used for the Six Yogas becauseby means of these yogas one can achieve enlightenment in any of the threebardos- waking state, sleep state, and after-death state.One: The Oral Instruction of the Six Yogas1. The legend of Tilopa's life is wonderfully related in The Great KagyuMasters, by Khenpo Konchok Gyaltsen (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1990).2. The lives and lineages of these four masters are told in brief in The SevenInstruction Lineages, a translation of Taranatha's bKa' Nabs bdun Idan by DavidTempleman (Dharamsala, India: LTWA, 1983).3. Chakrasamvara is the mandala deity that Tilopa used as the basis of hisgeneration stage yoga. This yoga is treated further in Chapter Three, where JeySherab Gyatso discusses what mandala deities can be used as the basis of thegeneration stage practice in the Six Yogas system. A short Chakrasamvara sadhanais provided in the introductory section of Tsongkhapa's A Practice Manual on theSix Yogas, translated in Chapter Five.4. Literally \"cause and effect.\" The meaning is that we get specific resultsfrom specific endeavors. The result of practicing the Six Yogas of Naropa is theattainment of enlightenment. This extracts \"the essence of the human potential.\"5. I am translating the Sanskrit term chandali as \"inner heat.\" The Tibetanequivalent is tumn o (t>tum mo), where the first syllable means \"fierce\" andrefers to the warm bliss that arises from the practice, and the second, afeminine particle, refers to the wisdom that becomes the object of that bliss.Tun is male and mo female, indicating the necessity of balancing male and femalefactors-that is, energy and wisdom-in one's training.6. Krishnacharya is known in Tibetan literature by a number of names, one ofwhich is Charyapa. Another common name for him in Tibetan scriptures isKanhapada. He is perhaps the most important of the four lineage masters prior toTilopa from whom the Six Yogas descends, because it is he who synthesized theinner heat teachings of the Hevajra and Heruka Chakrasamvara cycles astransmitted to Tilopa and then Naropa, and as Tsongkhapa states, success in theinner heat yoga is the foundation stone of progress in the remaining five.His most popular name in Tibetan is Nakpo Chopa (Tib. Nag po spyod pa), whichmeans \"Black Yogi.\" Born in the eighth century in Orissa, he embarked upontantric practice in his youth, first under the guidance of the female mysticLakshminkara, and later under the mahasiddha Jalandarapada, the principaldisciple of Lawapa. At Jalandarapada's feet he gained great siddhi, such as thepowers to fly, walk through solid matter, and so forth. Jalandarapada sent himto study with the female mystic Bhadri, also known as Guhyadakini, and from herhe acquired many tantric scriptures, including the Samputatilika, and achievedfurther realization. Jalandarapada then sent him to Oddiyana to receiveempowerments from another female mystic, Vajradakini by name, and from her heachieved the ability to travel to the netherworlds, the heavens, and otherparanormal realms. He also then achieved the power to transform matter intoenergy with a single glance. He could tame wild tigers and lions merely bylooking at them, and cause mighty soldiers to become frozen into statue-likestillness in his presence.His guru Jalandarapada, while teaching in eastern India, was captured by a kingand buried in a pit for twelve years. When Krishnacharya heard of this he wentto the king's palace and sat in meditation. All domesticated animals in thekingdom and all children were unable to drink liquids from the moment heappeared. The king repented and offered food to him and his entourage.Krishnacharya replied, \"A poor man like you is unable to fill the bellies ofeven two of my disciples, let alone all of us.\" Food for more than a thousandpeople was prepared, but the two disciples easily consumed it all. The kingbecame his disciple and released his guru Jalandarapada from prison.When Jalandarapada was offered food he replied, \"I have not touched any food orwater for the twelve years I sat in meditation in your prison, and have no needfor ordinary sustenance now.\" The king and a thousand of his attendantspracticed meditation under the two mahasiddhas and achieved sainthood.When Krishnacharya eventually passed away he did so by manifesting the rainbowbody, that is, dissolving his ordinary aggregates into rainbow light and leavingbehind only his hair and nails.In addition to his role in the Six Yogas transmission, one of the three mostimportant Heruka Chakrasamvara lineages to come to Tibet is rooted in him. TheTibetan canon contains translations of more than seventy-five tantric treatisescomposed by him in Sanskrit.7. Tibetans consider both Nagarjuna the second-century Madhyamaka philosopherand Nagarjuna the fifth-century tantric mahasiddha to be one and the same man.According to this account, he taught and wrote about Mahayana Buddhism andMadhyamaka philosophy in his early career and tantric Buddhism in his lateryears. He achieved the siddhi of immortality, and between the two phases of histeaching life lived in retreat in South India for three hundred years.Western scholars are skeptical of this legend and believe that there were twoNagarjunas: the first-century Madhyamaka teacher and the fifth-century tantricmahasiddha.The Nagarjuna referred to in this and the later verse is the tantric mahasiddha.8. Lawapa (Skt. Lvavapada; Tib. Lva ba pa) was the guru of Krishnacharya's guruJalandarapada. Lawapa was a direct disciple of Ghantapada (Tib. Dril bit pa).Born as a prince in Oddiyana, he renounced his kingdom for the life of awandering monk. Eventually he met the mahasiddha Ghantapada, and from himreceived the Heruka Chakrasamvara initiation. Thereafter he spent many yearsmeditating in charnel grounds and near cremation pyres.His name means \"the Blanket Master,\" which he acquired when some proud monkschallenged him to debate. He refused to accept their challenge, which angeredthe local king. The king shouted at him, \"Stupid monk, it would be better if youjust found somewhere to sleep!\" He immediately wrapped himself in his blanket,stretched out on the earth in front of the king's palace, and went to sleep fortwelve years without rising. Nobody could walk by him without prostrating, andall who touched his sleeping form were miraculously cured of any illnesses thatthey had.When he finally arose from his slumber the king asked him why he had slept solong. \"Your Majesty,\" he replied, \"it was your direct command.\" The king and hiscourt became his disciples.On another occasion when residing in a charnel ground, 500 black magicians stolehis blanket, cut it into small pieces, and ate it as part of a ritual to harmhim. He turned their black magic back on them and transformed them into sheep.The king appealed to him to forgive them. He came naked to the court, and hadthe magicians vomit up his blanket and sew it back together. He then retired toa nearby cave and spent twelve more years in meditation. Here he wrote numeroustreatises on tantric practice, many of which are preserved in the Tibetan canon.9. Sukhasiddhi is one of the great female mystics of late ninth- and earlytenthcentury Buddhist India. A system of yoga similar to the Naropa tradition isnamed after her, the Six Yogas of Sukhasiddhi. Several treatises on this yogiclegacy exist in Tibetan.Two: Vajra Verses of the Whispered Tradition1. The best English-language biography of Naropa is The Life and Teachings ofNaropa by H. V. Guenther (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963).2. The Tibetan scriptural canon has two wings: the Kangyur, which contains thetranslations of Buddha's teachings, known as the sutras (exoteric) and tantras(esoteric); and the Tengyur, which contains the Tibetan translations of works bylater Indian Buddhist masters, known as shastras. Bu-ton Rinchen Drubpa compiledthe latter canon. In doing so, he followed strict guidelines of only includingtexts for which he felt sure that original Sanskrit versions existed. He did notinclude works created by Tibetan lamas from the direct words of their Indiangurus, for no Sanskrit version of these existed and thus technically they werenot \"translated shastras.\"This is the same Bu-ton Rinchen Drubpa, by the way, who appears in the lineageof transmission of the Six Yogas of Naropa that came to Lama Tsongkhapa as givenin the Introduction, and who was the founder of the Zhalu school of TibetanBuddhism.The colophon to Naropa's text states, \"It is from the mouth of the Indian sageMahapandita Naropa...... This perhaps suggests that the text was spoken byNaropa directly to Marpa, but was never written out in Sanskrit and thereforedid not qualify as a shastra. Later editions of the Tengyur, such as thatpublished by Dergey Monastery, from which my English translation was made, addedextra titles that Bu-ton had excluded. Some of these probably were texts ofwhich Bu-ton was unaware; others would be texts that he felt were nottranslations of actual Sanskrit compositions but were written by the Tibetansfrom notes of their encounters with and teachings received from their Indiangurus.The First Panchen Lama in his Six Yogas treatise (translated in Chapter Six ofthis volume) quotes several passages from a text he calls The Song of Nampa.This text does not exist in either the Nartang, Dergey, Potala or Pekingeditions of the Tibetan canon. Presumably Marpa wrote it from Naropa's wordsdirectly into Tibetan, without there ever having been a Sanskrit version.3. The list as given here is from the eighteenth-century Gelukpa lama NgulchuDharmabhadra's commentary on Tsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations.Ngulchu's text, like that by Jey Sherab Gyatso translated in Chapter Three, isnot a commentary written by him, but is a compilation of edited notes from anoral discourse that he gave. It is a brilliant work, taking the very complextext by Tsongkhapa and stripping it down to practical essentials, as well asadding many little-known \"asides\" about the tradition, such as this list of tenyogas.4. This passage-\"I, Vajradhara, will speak of that auspicious meaning. Offerhomage, 0 Jnana Dakini, and listen well.\"-probably comes from one of the tantrasof the Heruka Chakrasamvara cycle taught by the Buddha in his emanation asVajradhara. I was unable to locate the exact source. Naropa's meaning is that heis going to paraphrase the meaning of Buddha's tantric teachings in the versesthat follow.5. The Sanskrit term sarnaya was translated into Tibetan as darn tsi~ (darntshig), meaning sacred oath, commitment, or bond. The three sacred commitmentsof tantric practice are those of the three vehicles: Hinayana, Mahayana, andVajrayana. The first is to avoid harming any living being; the second is tocultivate the attitude of universal responsibility; and the third is to alwayscultivate the tantric pride of seeing oneself and all other living beings assacred mandala deities.Three: Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations1. The great guru Drakkar Kachu Rinpochey: Drakkar is the name of an area inTibet; Kachu is a title meaning \"master of the ten instructions\"; and Rinpocheymeans \"Precious Teacher.\" Presumably this is the incarnate lama of the Drakkarregion, and the incarnate head of Drakkar Monastery.2. Jangsem Kunzangpa is another name for Sempa Chenpo Kunzangpa, the editor ofTsongkhapa's A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas of Naropa, translated in ChapterFive. \"Jangsem\" is an abbreviation of Jangchub Sempa, which is the Tibetanequivalent of the Sanskrit word \"bodhisattva,\" meaning \"awakening hero.\" \"SempaChenpo\" means \"great hero,\" which in Sanskrit is Mahasattva. The two aresynonymous.3. Pa Rinto Yontsang and Gyalsey Rinpochey: I don't know who the first lama is;the latter is a famous incarnate lama of Drepung Loseling Monastery, and alsothe incarnate head of Tawang Monastery, located at the birthplace of the SixthDalai Lama in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh, India. Until 1914 this part of Indiabelonged to Tibet; it was lost to British India at the time of the 1913-14Shimla Agreement. The 1962 war between India and China was fought over thisdisputed territory.The present Gyalsey Rinpochey incarnation lives and teaches in Tawang Monastery.4. A Thousand Blazing Sunbeams (Tib. 'Od zer stong 'bar): A text on the SixYogas popular as a teaching tool with the earlier Kargyupa lamas. I am unsure ofthe authorship, as I was unable to locate a copy.5. This is the literal translation. The meaning is (1) meditations that causethe mind to develop spiritual inclinations; (2) meditations that cause spiritualinclinations to transform into spiritual experience; (3) meditations that causespiritual experience to pacify the emotional and mental/spiritual distortions;and (4) meditations that cause the distorted mind to arise as wisdom.In many of the Kargyu schools today these four stages of training, which involvedozens of meditative and contemplative techniques, are used to accomplish theinner foundations on which tantric practice can be successfully engaged.6. In the Kadam and Geluk, and to some extent also in the Kargyu and Sakyaschools, the Lamrim tradition brought to Tibet by Atisha Dipamkara Shrijnana in1042 is used as the practice guide to the General Mahayana trainings in order toprepare the mind for tantra.The three levels of the Lamrim training are simply called initial, intermediateand advanced. The initial level is comprised of meditations for turning the mindfrom negative action and materialistic grasping, and instead replacing thesenegative states with the aspiration to goodness and higher rebirth. Theintermediate level training is comprised of meditations for turning the mindfrom grasping at higher sensual and meditative pleasures and engendering theaspiration to nirvana. The advanced level of training is comprised ofmeditations for turning the mind from self-grasping and engendering thebodhisattva mind of universal love.Tsongkhapa wrote three Lamrim treatises on these meditations, the longest ofwhich is over 500 folios, or 1,000 pages in length.7. Tsongkhapa presents meditational outlines for both of these methods in his APractice Manual on the Six Yogas.8. Again, these can be seen in Tsongkhapa's A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas.9. The three kayas are discussed in Chapter Four.10. At a public teaching the present Dalai Lama gave on A Book of ThreeInspirations in Dharamsala, 1991, he commented that the term kyawa (Tib. rkyaha) used here can also refer to the oars; just as one needs to keep the two oarsmoving with equal strength, one needs to put equal emphasis on the conventionaland ultimate levels of reality.11. Tsongkhapa explains the correct manner of envisioning the chakras in APractice Manual on the Six Yogas.12. A translation of a treatise on the Six Yogas of Niguma is included in mystudy on the life and teachings of the Second Dalai Lama, Selected Works of theDalai L.mna fI (Snow Lion, 1984).13. The second of these two texts, that by Panchen Chogyen, is translated inChapter Six of this volume.14. This is one of the high incarnate lamas of Ganden Jangtsey Monastery. Hismost recent incarnation passed away in Nepal in 1995.15. Kyabgon Dorjey Chang is a familiar honorific for a high lama, and simplymeans \"All-Pervading Buddha Vajradhara.\" At any one time there are a dozenGelukpa lamas known by this name. The disciples attending Jey Sherab Gyatso'sdiscourse would have known the person to whom it referred, as he would have beenone of Sherab Gyatso's main gurus.16. 1 presume this refers to the First Panchen Lama, but it could also mean thePanchen who was a contemporary of Jey Sherab Gyatso.Four: Handprints of the Profound Path of the Six Yogas of Naropa1. There are two ways of listing the successive incarnations of the Panchenlamas, due to the three important pre-Panchen incarnations. When these three areadded in, the First Panchen Lama becomes the Fourth in the line, and GyalwaWensapa then becomes the Third.The Lhasa government, however, who keeps the \"official list,\" counts PanchenChokyi Gyaltsen (1568-1662) as the First Panchen Lama, and the Panchen Lama whodied in Tibet in 1989 as the seventh incarnation. For most Tibetans, therefore,Gyalwa Wensapa is not considered an official Panchen Lama.This situation with two different lists was not the case in the early days, andseems to have arisen in the early 1800s, when the Ninth to Twelfth Dalai Lamasdied young, and the Panchen became a very important figure in Tibetan affairs.His numbering was increased by three in order to add prestige to the office.The Chinese follow the tradition of giving the larger number to theincarnations, on the basis that more is better. The Tibetans list the Panchenwho died in 1989 as the seventh incarnation (Tib. sku 'phreng Mini pa); theChinese list him as the tenth (Tib. sku 'phreng bcu pa). Similarly, by Lhasareckoning the present young incarnation is counted as the eighth; by Chinesereckoning he is the eleventh.As Tibet-watchers will be aware, the Tibetan child recognized as the EighthPanchen Lama by the Dalai Lama in May of 1995 was immediately arrested andimprisoned by the Chinese government, who in turn recognized and enthroned theirown candidate several months later, in December of 1995. In that ChineseCommunists do not acknowledge the doctrine of reincarnation, their role inoverseeing the search for and enthronement of an official reincarnate lama hasnot gone down well with the Tibetans. Even as I write, however, Beijing'sgovernment is giving all monks in Tibet the option of either signing a documentacknowledging Beijing's candidate and repudiating the Dalai Lama's candidate, orelse facing expulsion from their monasteries and also possible imprisonment andtorture.Thus today there are two Panchen Lamas: the child installed by the ChineseCommunists; and the child recognized a year earlier by the Dalai Lama, who,together with his parents and forty-eight monks from Tashi Lhunpo whoparticipated in the search, languish in prison or under house arrest. None ofthese religious prisoners has been seen or heard from since their arrest. Thechild has been adopted by Amnesty International as the world's youngestpolitical prisoner.2. See Tsongkhapa's Six Yogas of Naropa (Snow Lion, 1996), pp. 188-190.3. Vajradhara is the name given to Buddha in his primordial tantric emanation.\"The myriads of mandala deities\" refers to the manner in which Buddha in hisform as Vajradhara manifested as various tantric deities and taught thedifferent tantric systems.4. These twelve are as follows: an illusory appearance (Tib. sgyu ma), objectsin a dream (Tib. rnii lain), an hallucination (Tib. niig sgyu), a reflection ina mirror (Tib. gziigs brnang), lightning in the sky (Tib. glog), an echo in acave (Tib. brag cha), a rainbow (Tib. ja' tshon), the moon in a lake (Tib. chuzla), a city of ghosts (Tib. dri za'i grong kh yer), cloud-forms that deceivethe eye (Tib. mig yor sprin), and magically emanated forms (Tib. sprul pa).5. Emotional obscurations: Skt. klesha avarana; Tib. nyon sgrih.6. Perceptual obscurations: Skt. n yer avarana; Tib. sties sgrib.7. Basowa Tenpai Gyaltsen was Gyalwa Wensapa's chief disciple, and is alsoreputed to have achieved enlightenment in one lifetime.Five: A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas of Naropa1. Even though Tsongkhapa's text is very different from that by Gyalwa Wensapatranslated in the previous chapter, this aspect of his outline resemblesWensapa's analysis of how the Six Yogas involve two main techniques-those forbringing the energies into the central channel; and those to be applied once theenergies have been brought into the central channel. Wensapa, however, spoke ofthese two subjects in terms of the principles of the three blendings; Tsongkhapawill describe the actual meditations whereby these two stages are accomplished.2. The idea of the navel channel-petals reaching up and those of the heart down,and also those of the throat chakra reaching up and those of the crown reachingdown, is that there are two pairs of chakras-the crown/throat set and the heart/navel set-with each pair being comprised of one male and one female chakra thatarouse and stimulate one another. The male is on top in both sets; female heatrises and male fluids flow down.3. That is, it is a vertical line, but it is thicker at the base and becomesincreasingly thinner as it rises, somewhat like a thorn or toothpick standing onits thick end.4. The male and female \"drops\" that flow through the body are termed bodhichittain Sanskrit, meaning \"enlightenment substances.\" Bodhi means enlightenment, andchitta means mind. Following the lead of the late great Geshey Wangyal, Itranslate the term bodhichitta as \"bodhimind\" when it appears in a Sutrayanacontext, and as \"bodhimind substances\" when it appears in a tantric context.5. Sometimes the mantric syllable at the navel is called AH and sometimes AM,due to the presence of the crescent above it. The visualization is identical forboth, and thus both transcriptions of the mantra are correct. Either way it isjust a vertical stroke with the three-piece crescent above it.6. Kyurura is a type of transparent fruit that glistens and shines when held inthe light.7. These \"elemental dissolutions\" together with the four \"sky-like signs\" arediscussed in the preamble to Chapter Four.8. These \"three blendings\" were the subject of Gyalwa Wensapa's text, translatedin Chapter Four.9. The four types of birth in the Buddhist world view are (1) birth from a womb,(2) birth from an egg, (3) birth from a fusion of heat and moisture, and (4)miraculous birth. All living beings take birth in one of these four ways.10. That is, one's five skandhas: one's sense of form, feelings, distinguishingawareness, mental/ metaphysical archetypes, and primary consciousnesses. A\"person\" is the sense of \"1\" that arises from these five. Our entire experienceof the world and of life is known by means of them.11. That is, the level of the illusory body accomplishment that is concomitantwith the attainment of \"the path of direct vision,\" the third of the five stagesleading to enlightenment. On this level the yogi or yogini has direct insightinto emptiness, or ultimate reality, during meditation sessions, and has becomean arya, or saint. When exiting from meditation and engaging in activities onthe conventional level, the practitioner loses the direct vision of emptiness;therefore the path above this is known as \"the path of integration,\" becausefrom this point on the process of growth involves integrating the two levels ofreality into a unified vision.12. This is the same posture as that in which the Buddha passed away, andtherefore is the subject of considerable artistic activity. Most Buddhisttemples around the world have a painting or statue of the Buddha lying in thisposture.13. Tsongkhapa does describe the technique in depth in A Book of ThreeInspirations, translated in Tsongkhapa's Six Yogas of Naropa (Snow Lion, 1996).Jey Sherab Gyatso also discusses it briefly in the text translated in ChapterThree of the present volume.Six: The Golden Key1. According to Tibetan rumor, the Seventh Panchen Lama died from poisonadministered by the Chinese Communists a few days after a public talk that hegave, in which he condemned the Chinese presence in Tibet and said, \"There isnothing that the Communists could ever do now to compensate for the tremendousdestruction and suffering that their occupation has incurred.\" Four days laterhe died mysteriously during the night.2. These were discussed by Jey Sherab Gyatso in the text that appears here asChapter Three.3. Jey Sherab Gyatso discussed the general principles of the generation stageyogas in Chapter Three. Tsongkhapa's text in Chapter Five provides a briefHeruka Chakrasamvara sadhana that can be used as the basis of the generationstage meditations.4. The introductory sections of Tsongkhapa's text in Chapter Five provide briefmeditation instructions for both the Vajrasattva and guru yoga practices, underthe heading \"The Special Tantric Preliminaries.\"Jey Sherab Gyatso briefly discusses the topics of refuge and the bodhisattvaperspective. Readers who want more explanation of the traditional meditationsassociated with these two subjects can read one of my earlier books with SnowLion Publications, Training the Mind in the Great Way (1993), which contains theFirst Dalai Lama's treatise on the Tibetan contemplative system known as \"SevenPoints for Training the Mind in the Mahayana Tradition\" (Tib. Theg chen Nosbyong don hdun ma).5. As I mentioned in the Introduction, there are several Tibetan texts by thisname (Tib. Na ro'i mgur) attributed to Naropa. The original Tengyur compiled byButon does not include any of them, and the Tengyur published several centurieslater by Dergey Monastery includes only the one that I have translated inChapter Two of the present volume.This passage by the First Panchen Lama may be a reference to that work. However,later in this text the First Panchen Lama quotes another \"Song of Naropa\" whichis a different work altogether, and is not found in any of the Tibetan canonicalcollections. This passage may also be a reference to that second text.With the dispersion of Tibetan literature caused by the Chinese destruction ofTibet's great libraries it is difficult to know what from among thislittle-known body of writings has been lost, and also very difficult to knowwhat still survives and where it is to be found. Very few of the existingreservoirs of Tibetan literature have catalogues of their holdings.6. The First Panchen Lama has lifted this and the previous verse by MarpaLotsawa from Tsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations. Tsongkhapa in turnprobably lifted them from the official biography of Marpa. An Englishtranslation of this exists, prepared by the Nalanda Translation Committee (TheLife of Marpa the Translator [Boulder: Prajna Press, 1982]).7. The four descending blisses occur when the inner heat yoga causes the drop todescend from the crown to the jewel chakra; as it passes through each of thefour chakras it causes an increasingly intense sensation of orgasmic bliss. Thisdrop is then brought back up from the jewel to the crown chakra, giving rise tothe four ascending blisses. Tsongkhapa describes the meditations that accomplishthis process in A Practice Manual on the Six Yogas.8. \"Clarifying the breath and bodily energies\" refers to the nine-pointbreathing exercise and six physical exercises, described in Tsongkhapa's APractice Manual on the Six Yogas.9. Seeing oneself as Nirmanakaya means seeing oneself as the mandala deity. TheJnanasattva at one's heart means establishing the radiant mantric syllable HUMin the heart chakra.10. The term vidyadharn translates literally as \"knowledge holder.\" This refersto taking a controlled rebirth as a tantric master in order to perform vast andextensive activities for the benefit of the world."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARY:Tibetan Personal and Place Names[../Images/page0168_0000.svg][../Images/page0168_0001.svg][../Images/page0169_0000.svg][../Images/page0169_0001.svg][../Images/page0170_0000.svg][../Images/page0170_0001.svg]"},{"pageContent":"TEXTS QUOTED BY THE AUTHORSINDIAN TEXTSThe Advaya Vijaya TantraTib.
