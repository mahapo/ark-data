To preserve these is to preserve the complete practice of Vajrayana Buddhism. All of the texts enshrined in this collection were written by the most authentic masters of their lineage. Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye not only made great efforts to receive the transmission of every one of these instructions from a master of that practice; he also practiced them all in solitary retreat. Therefore, this is not just a collection of texts but a living lineage of transforming practices. The Treasury and its transmission also became the focal point of the ri-me (nonsectarian) movement in Tibetan Buddhism. When His Holiness the Sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa came out of Tibet as a refugee, one of the first things he did was to give the transmission of The Treasury of Precious Instructions-even before building a monastery. I am extremely grateful that Tsadra Foundation is taking up the enor-mous task of translating this entire collection into English. I regard this undertaking as one of the greatest possible contributions toward preserving Tibetan civilization. And I congratulate Richard Barron for making the cata-log of The Treasury of Precious Instructions available in English. Ringu Tulku February 2013"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR's PREFACE The Treasury of Precious Instructions (gDams ngag rin po che'i mdzod) is one of the five monumental collections known as the Five Treasuries that were compiled by Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye (1813-1900), one of the greatest figures of his time in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. To read his autobi-ography is to be astonished at his literary output alone, to say nothing of his other achievements. In A Marvelous Garland of Rare Gems, a history of the Dzogchen lineage of the Nyingma school, the late Nyoshul Khenpo re-marked of Jamgon Kongtrul: When we examine his legacy of some ninety volumes of original works-a marvelous nonsectarian contribution to the continuity of the teachings-it would seem as though he spent his life solely engaged in composition. When we reflect on his efforts to trans-mit the empowerments, teachings, pith instructions, and oral transmissions of the Nyingma and Sarma schools without sectar-ian bias, it would seem as though he devoted himself entirely to explaining and promulgating teachings. When we consider the ways in which he engaged in the profound stages of develop-ment and completion for an incredible range of practices, from the preliminaries to a vast array of mandalas, it would seem as though he spent his entire life sealed away in a retreat center. However, he also founded monastic centers such as that at Tsari Rinchen Drak, contributed to the restoration of older sites by erecting new representations of enlightened form, speech, and mind, organized more than 150 rituals for offering ganachalcras, served the sublime Three Jewels, and so forth. When we exam-ine how he pursued the ten kinds of spiritual conduct, it would"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"X THE CATALOG seem as though he spent his life wholly engaged in the pursuit of spiritual activities. He certainly exemplified the conduct of an advanced practitioner. 1 Kongtrul's inspiration to produce these Five Treasuries came, as did so much that he valued in his life, from his primary guru, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. In his autobiography, Kongt:n:Il notes the following exchange early in 1862, when he was about fifty: in the periods between my meditation sessions I had been com-posing the source verses to my treatise The Encompassing of the Knowable, 2 a treatise dealing with the three higher trainings. Later, I offered this to my lord guru for his inspection, and on that occasion he gave me great encouragement, saying, \"This is definitely due to the blessings of your spiritual masters and the power that comes from having the dakinis open up your subtle channels. We will call this The Treasury of the Knowable, the first of the five great Treasuries you will produce. Now you must write your own commentary to it.\" 3 The next mention Kongtrul makes of this project in connection with The Treasury of Precious Instructions is some eight years later, on the first day of the new Tibetan year (that is, early in 1870): I discussed an idea of mine with Khyentse Rinpoche. I had already received teachings from the traditions of the Eight Lineages of Accomplishment; So that these transmissions would not go to waste, I had thought to gather all the most important empow-erments, instructions, and spiritual advice in a single collection. When I suggested this plan to Khyentse Rinpoche, he told me that he himself had written about twenty small volumes of in-struction on these subjects, but that he had a big problem in that the empowerments were not complete. \"Your idea is excellent,\" he said, \"and you should put this collection together and call it The Treasury of Spiritual Advice.\" 4 He drew up a list of some ten volumes of oral transmissions and spiritual advice, such as the \"red\" and \"black\" volumes of the Lamdre tradition, and com-posed histories of the lineages of my Treasury of Precious Hidden Teachings and Treasury of Spiritual Advice. Khyentse Rinpoche"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE xi told me that I should write an instruction manual for the Eight Cycles of the Path. 5 The night after Kongtrul had agreed to undertake this project, Khyentse Rinpoche had an elaborate and prophetic dream that both of them took as an excellent omen for the success of their endeavors. Over a decade later, in late 1881, Kongtrul visited his guru: \"I went di-rectly to Dzongsar Monastery. There I did a detailed edit of the latest vol-umes of my Treasury of Spiritual Advice that had been published.\" 6 By the autumn of the following year, Kongtrul gave what seems to have been the first transmission of The Treasury of Precious Instructions to a small group of his students, a process that took two months: The masters of Ngor and his students, Dzogchen Rinpoche, the terton's rebirth, and others-some thirty people in all-promised me that they would study, teach, promulgate, and practice the instructions found in my Treasury of Spiritual Advice, so at the outset I performed for them a major torma empowerment focus-ing on the dakinis. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month I be-gan giving the empowerments, oral transmissions, and instruc-tions from The Treasury of Spiritual Advice. These were finished by the fourteenth day of the tenth month. On the fifteenth day, in conclusion we very methodically performed a ganachakra feast and, at Khandroi Drora, an offering ceremony for the \"one hundred families of yoginis.\" 7 Kongtrul continued to expand the collection over the next few years, so that by 1887, when he conferred the transmission of The Treasury of Precious Instructions on the young fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyap Dorje, the process took more than three months: I accompanied Gyalwang Karmapa and his retinue back to Palpung Monastery [where] ... Karmapa took up residence in the temple for the monastic summer retreat. I began giving the transmissions for The Treasury of Spiritual Advice [early in the third month] .... These were finished by the tenth day of the sixth month. Once I had finished offering these teachings, I brought everything to a positive conclusion with a teaching on the longevity practice associated with White Tara. 8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xii THE CATALOG He gave the transmission of The Treasury of Precious Instructions for the third and final time early in 1889, but an entry in his diary for 1893 notes that he continued to expand and revise the collection. At the conclusion of his autobiography, discussing his career as a student and teacher, he remarks: For the fourth of the Treasuries, The Treasury of Spiritual Advice, because of my deep faith in the Eight Lineages of Accomplishment that developed in Tibet, I spent a great deal of effort in seek-ing out the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions transmitted by the extensive lineages of all of these systems. Although no one could have the time to put all of these teachings into practice, they were collected so that the advice my spiritual masters had imparted would not go to waste. I also thought that while the famous traditions were widespread enough, it might be possible to ensure that some very rare transmissions, which were on the point of disappearing, might at least be preserved as lineages of words. In addition, it is my feeling that to hear these essential teachings of the sutras and tantras even once gives purpose to our lives as human beings. With this altruistic motivation, I collected the quintessential elements of these eight systems of practice, as well as their most profound ripening em-powerments and liberating instructions. 9 Kongtrul·never expected that any single individual would practice all the methods contained in even one of his Treasuries. Rather, by bringing these lines of transmission together in a unified format, he helped to ensure that the continuity that is so vital to an authentic lineage would be easier to maintain. In order for a lineage to be considered viable in the Tibetan context, at the very least, a living master must confer the transmission-whether an empowerment, a reading transmission, or an instruction--on a living student. Given that any teaching could conceivably be the means by which someone at some point might attain liberation and enlightenment, it is seen as crucial that all teachings continue to be transmitted through authentic lineages. Many of the teachings contained in Kongtrul's Treasuries might arguably have disappeared if he had not brought them into the main-stream as part of a collection that would be transmitted on a regular basis to large groups of people. Indeed, in his catalog to the collection, translated in the present volume, Kongtrul notes where an unbroken line for the reading"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"TRANSLATORS PREFACE xiii transmission (Tib. lung) of a given text is no longer extant. He also empha-sizes the urgency of this task of preservation: There are, however, special auxiliary teachings in the foregoing traditions-instructions and ancient texts-that are rare, with barely a continuous line of the reading transmission still extant, as well as the traditions of the Shangpa, the Zhije, the Nyendrup, and so forth, in which the lines of transmission are exceeding-ly rare and in danger of dying out. With an altruistic desire to benefit these lines of teachings and with great diligence, I have sought out the three components of empowerments, reading transmissions, and instructions for them and compiled them so that all this will prove to be of use. THE STRUCTURE OF THE TREASURY OF PRECIOUS INSTRUCTIONS Using the terminology given to him by his guru Jam yang Khyentse Wangpo, Kongtrul called his collection a treasury of \"instructions\" (Tib. gdams ngag), or spiritual advice. The term gdams ngag is often used interchangeably with man ngag, so that a unilateral distinction between these is not practical. As Matthew Kapstein notes in his insightful article \"gDams ngag: Tibetan Technologies of the Self\": The Tibetan terms gdams ngag (Skt. upade.Sa) and man ngag (Skt. iimniiya, but sometimes also upade.Sa) refer broadly to speech and writing that offer directives for practice, whether in the gen-eral conduct of life or in some specialized field such as medicine, astronomy, politics, yoga or meditation. In any of these areas, they may refer to \"esoteric\" instructions, i.e., advice not usually found in theoretical textbooks but derived from the hands-on ex-perience of skilled practitioners, and thus intended primarily for those who are actually engaged in the practice of the discipline concerned. Man ngag seems often to connote a higher degree of esotericism than does gdams ngag, particularly where both terms are employed together contrastively, and despite their essential synonymity. 10 In this context, Kongtrul is using the term gdams ngag to refer broadly to many different kinds of spiritual instructions, from complex exegeses of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv THE CATALOG scriptural sources to highly personalized, even idiosyncratic pith instructions given on a single occasion by a highly realized master to a highly receptive student. The Treasury of Precious Instructions includes examples of all kinds of teaching styles and subject matter. Yet it must be noted that the emphasis in The Treasury is on the Vajrayana teachings, the realm in which the distinc-tions among the various schools in the Tibetan tradition are most marked. As his overarching theme for The Treasury of Precious Instructions, Kong-trul found his inspiration in the historical Tibetan model of the \"eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment.\" As Kapstein notes: There is no single classification of the many traditions of gdams ngag that is universally employed by Tibetan Buddhist doxog-raphical writers. From about the thirteenth century onwards, however, the preeminence of certain particular traditions gave rise to a characteristic scheme that we encounter repeatedly, with small variations, throughout Tibetan historical, doctrinal and bibliographical literature. According to this, there are eight major gdams ngag traditions, which are referred to as the \"eight great conveyances that are lineages of attainment\" (sgrub brgyud shing rta chen po brgyad). The paradigmatic formulation of this classificatory scheme is generally attributed to 'Phreng bo gTer ston Shes rab 'od zer (Prajfiarasmi, 1517-1584), whose verses on this topic are widely cited by Tibetan authors. 11 The Buddhist tradition and the teachings on which it is based are often described as comprising the two areas of theory (which is to say, study) and practice (Tib. bshad sgrub), although \"theory\" is never meant to remain sim-ply theoretical. Indeed, there is not a hard-and-fast line between these two areas but a mutually complementary relationship of study informing prac-tice and practice inspiring further study. Just as Tibetans use this model of the eight lineages of accomplishment to exemplify the practical application of the Buddhist teachings, they also refer to the \"ten great pillars uphold-ing the lineages of exegesis,\" to whom Kongtrul alludes in the introductory section of The Catalog, as embodying the ideal of studying the teachings to better understand the Buddha's message. The eighteen volumes of The Treasury of Precious Instructions are arranged in roughly chronological order, beginning with the earliest of the Tibetan schools, the Nyingma, and continuing with the Sarma (\"newer\") schools, concluding with several volumes of teachings that are referred to as \"minor"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE X'l instructions\" (k.hrid phran), a term that should be understood to indicate not inferiority or lack of worth but simply a teaching that does not constitute the backbone of one of the more historically prominent schools. Thus the first two volumes of The Treaswy of Precious Instructions concern the teachings of the Nyingma school, established in the eighth century with the arrival in Tibet of masters such as Padmakara and Vimalamitra. Kongtrul classifies the texts included in these volumes according to the Nyingma model of the three yogas (mahayoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga) and the three categories within atiyoga: the Category of Mind (sems sde), the Category of Expanse (klong sde), and the Category of Direct Transmission (man ngag sde). In his autobiography he outlines the contents of volumes 1 and 2: The first system, that of the Early Translation School, or Nying-ma, consists of the \"three yo gas.\" The first of these three sections is that of the Mahayoga approach. This section includes The Concise Path by Buddhaguhya; the precious master Padmakara's Pith Instructions: The Garland of Views, together with a com-mentary, and his Sphere of the Mamos' Activity; and the concise instructions on The Heart Essence of Secrets by the omniscient Longchenpa. The Anuyoga section includes teachings on the four stages of yoga connected with The Clarification of Bliss, and extracts from the intuitive techniques of meditation from the Discourse of United Intent. Of the three categories-outer, inner, and secret-of the Atiyoga section, the outer Category of Mind surveys the funda-mental tantra and explanatory commentaries, and includes the empowerment for The Eighteen Meanings of A and the instructions from the tradition of Kham, Nyang, and Aro. The inner Category of Expanse surveys the fundamental tantra and explanatory commentaries, and includes meditation methods, the blessing ritual of the guru, and instructions. The secret Category of Direct Transmission surveys the fundamental tantra and explanatory commentaries, and includes the empowerment and instruction for the Innermost Heart Drop of the Guru; the secret cycles of the omniscient master of the Buddhist teachings, Longchenpa, including his instructions for the cycle of Being at Ease in Mind Itself and The Trilogy of Natural Freedom, his instructions on the tantra Dredging the Pit of Cyclic Existence; and the rituals to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvi THE CATALOG honor the gurus of the Heart Drop lineage and to make offerings to the seven classes of guardian deities of these teachings. 12 The third and fourth volumes contain texts from the Kadampa tradition that sprang from the teachings of the great Indian master Atisa (980-1054) and structured itself on what the late E. Gene Smith called \"the fundamental contribution of Atisa-the Graduated Path (Lam rim), with its emphasis on the exoteric as an indispensable foundation for the esoteric.\" 13 These texts are categorized under three headings: the source texts (gzhung), which in this case are short works by Atisa; the spiritual instructions (gdams ngag), which here focus on the system known as \"mental training\" (blo sbyong); and the pith instructions (man ngag), which include Vajrayana teachings and practices. As Kongtrul notes: The section dealing with the second system, the Kadampa, consists of three parts-the source texts, the spiritual advice, and the pith instructions. The section on the source texts includes the primary source-The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment and its commentary-as well as commentaries on the stages on the spiritual path and other instructions. The section on the spiritual advice includes the primary source-The Seven Points of Mind Training-as well as the in-struction manual on this theme called The One Hundred Collected Instructions on Mental Training and other texts. The section on the pith instructions includes the source text-The Bodhisattva's Garland of Gems-as well as the empowerment and instructions for the Sixteen Spheres and the auxiliary autho-rizations and instructions concerning the Four Deities. From the \"new Kadampa\" tradition, so named by Je Rin-poche [Tsongkhapa], I have included his treatise The Three Principal Aspects of the Path, as well as the text Mahamudra: The Main Path of the Victorious Ones, and the definitive instructions. To supplement these teachings, I have included the rituals to confer the bodhisattva vow from both traditions of that or-dination. As well, there are some associated texts-instructions on the Madhyamaka view, a ritual to honor the gurus of the Kadampa School, and transmissions connected with Kartari-dhara Mahakala (the guardian deity of these teachings) and Lord Atisha's tradition of White Jambhala. 14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"TRANSLATORS PREFACE xvii Volumes 5 and 6 contain teachings transmitted in the lineage of the Sakya school, founded by Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092-1158). Smith offers the following description of this school: The Sa skya religious system is an amalgamation of diverse tra-ditions. Both Dkon mchog rgyal po, the founder of Sa skya, and his elder brother 'Khon Rog shes rab tshul khrims, felt the need for thorough reforms .... Dkon mchog rgyal po, like Mar pa, the great guru of the Bka' brgyud pa, was sent to study with the great teacher 'Brog mi. From 'Brog mi he received the Three Tantras of Hevajra (Kye rdo rje'i rgyud gsum)-the Hevajra, Vajrapa, and Samputa Tantras-and the initiations of the New Tantras. These new doctrines he skillfully grafted on to the mantric prac-tices of his ancestors, to whom they had been transmitted by Padmasambhava. This fact explains the particular reverence the Sa skya have for Gu ru Rin po che. It was not, however, until the organization of these various elements into a doctrinal system by the great Sa chen. Kun dga' snying po that we can speak of a Sa skya sect. 15 The Sakya school is noted in particular for the system known as Lamdre (the Path with the Result), which focuses on the Hevajra cycle and incorpo-rates teachings on the three levels of Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. As Kongtrul describes the contents of these two volumes: In the section dealing with the third system, that of the spiri-tual advice concerning Lamdre (\"The Path and Its Fruition\"), are found the primary source-The Vajra Verses-and its commen-taries, as well as the source text on The Inseparability of Samsara and Nirvana, with the instruction manuals and explanatory es-says concerning this text. The section also includes the empowerment for the \"pith in-struction\" tradition of Hevajra; texts from the extensive, more direct, and extremely direct lineages of the Lamdre teachings; the instructions on threefold purity according to the tantra The Vajra Pavilion; the \"eight later cycles concerning the spiritual path\"; and the \"spiritual connections of the six avenues.\" The auxiliary instructions include those concerned with Parting from the Four Kinds of Attachment; a ritual to honor the gurus of the Lamdre"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xviii THE CATALOG School; and the authorization for the eight deity mandala of Vajra Panjara Natha, the guardian deity of these teachings. 16 The next four volumes ·of The Treasury of Precious Instructions (volumes 7 to 10) focus on teachings from the Kagyu tradition of Marpa the transla-tor (1012-1097)-Kongtrul's primary affiliation, at least at that stage of his life-with its numerous schools and subschools. In the Vajrayana context, the Kagyu teachings have a dual emphasis on the path of skillful method (Tib. thabs lam), epitomized by the Six Dharmas of Naropa, and the path of freedom (Tib. grollam), that is, the teachings on Mahamudra. Kongtrul states: In the section concerning the fourth system, that of the Kagyii School of the powerful master Marpa, the common teachings in-clude the fundamental source of the Mahamudra approach-the glorious Tantra of the Uncorrupted State-as well as commen-taries authored by Saraha, Shavaripa, Tilopa, Naropa, Maitripa, Marpa, Milarepa, and Gampopa. The uncommon teachings include the authentic texts that are the primary source for the Six Yogas, as well as the vajra verses of the intimate oral lineage, the smaller and larger original texts, and the three cycles of Tilopa's, Naropa's, and Marpa's clarifica-tions of the intimate oral lineage. This section also includes the empowerment for the masculine and feminine aspects of the glo-rious Chakrasamvara mandala according to the tradition of the intimate oral lineage. The fundamental advice and instructions included are the three treatments of the intimate oral lineage (the extensive, middle-length, and abridged), the nine doctrines of the \"disembodied dakinis\" by Rechungpa, and the \"four rolled scrolls\" of Tsurton's intimate oral lineage. This section contains instructions-primarily those concerning Mahamudra and the Six Yogas-from the individual subschools of the Dakpo Kagyii tradition, the four major ones being the primary one associated with the monastic seat of Dakpo, the Tsalpa of Guru Zhang, the Karma Kamtsang (with its branches of Zurmang and Nedo), and the Pakmo Drupa. Of the eight minor branches of the Pakmo Drupa Kagyii, the section contains teachings from the Drigung, Taklung, Throphu, and Lingre Kagyii (also known as the glori-ous Drukpa School, with its three subdivisions of upper, lower, and middle). There are also works by Yang-gonpa and Barawa."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE xix In addition, the section includes a ritual to honor the gurus of the Kagyi.i School in general, and transmissions concerning the protective deities of these teachings-the Four-Armed Mahakala and the goddess Dhumavati. 17 Volumes 11 and 12 contain the teachings of the Shangpa Kagyu school founded by the remarkable Tibetan master Khyungpo Naljor (990-1139), who is reputed to have lived to the age of 150, visited India seven times, and studied with more than 150 masters, including the two dakinis Niguma and Sukhasiddhi. Kongtrul had a special affinity with this tradition, which he felt was in danger of losing its identity as a distinct tradition, owing both to the vicissitudes of the Tibetan religio-political scene and to the fact that many of its teachings had been absorbed into other schools. Kongtrul was very concerned that the Shangpa Kagyu not just survive but thrive as a viable school of spiritual thought and practice, and to this end he made it a major focus in his program for the three-year, three-month retreat center he established at his hermitage of Kunzang Dechen bsel Ling, near Palpung Monastery, the seat of the Tai Situpas in eastern Tibet. 18 Kongtrul's dedica-tion to preserving and revivifying the Shangpa Kagyu tradition was carried on by one of his incarnations, Kalu Rinpoche Karma Rangjung Kunkyap Trinle Pal Zangpo (1908-1989), so that the school is currently undergoing something of a renaissance and has gained the support of such eminent figures as the current Tai Situ Rinpoche, Perna Di:inyi:i Nyingje. Kongtrul de-scribes the texts he included in these two volumes of The Treasury of Precious Instructions: In the section concerning the fifth system, that of the Shangpa Kagyi.i School, the primary sources are the vajra verses, and their commentaries, concerning the Six Yogas (the root), Mahamudra (the trunk), the three methods of \"carrying on the path\" (the branches), and the \"deathless state\" (the fruition), as well as the fundamental texts concerning the forms of the goddess Khechari (the flowers). The two collections of ritual blessings are the two cycles of teachings that establish the guidelines for receiving blessings-the six transmissions of the pivotal blessings, and the later basic transmissions. The section also contains the en-tire teachings from the direct lineage of Thangtong Gyalpo; the instructions written by the venerable Taranatha for the exten-sive lineage; and the practice cycles for Sukhasiddhi and The"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"XX THE CATALOG Combination of Four Deities. There is a ritual to honor the gurus of the Shangpa tradition, the authorizations for the dakinis of the five classes and the Swift-Acting Jnana Natha. The section also includes the thirteen major transmissions associated with the protective deity, the practice of Penetrating the Heart, and the transmission for Kshetrapala. 19 Volumes 13 and 14 are devoted to the teachings of two associated tra-ditions: (1) the Pacification of Suffering (Zhije) tradition based on the teachings of the enigmatic Indian master Dampa Sangye (d. 1117?), who is sometimes identified as (or perhaps conflated with) two Indian masters: Kamalasna and Bodhidharma; and (2) the Severance (Cho) tradition devel-oped by the female Tibetan master Machik Lapdri:in (1055-1149). The Zhije tradition, which takes its name (Pacification of Suffering) from a line in the Heart Sutra that describes the mantra of Prajfiaparamita as \"the mantra that .brings about the pacification of suffering,\" is based on teach-ings brought to Tibet by Dampa Sangye during some five visits to Tibet, organized into three main lineages with numerous branch lineages. With an enormous number of teachings that were brought from Buddhist India to Tibet over several centuries, the Severance tradition is renowned as the single example of a school of Buddhist thought and practice developed in Tibet that was accepted as authentic by Indian students and taken back to their home country to be promulgated there. 20 Kongtrul discusses the contents of these volumes as follows: The section dealing with the sixth system, that of Zhije School, includes the tantra fragments that are the primary sources, as well as miscellaneous writings of Phadampa Sang-gye and all the empowerments and ritual blessings for the three transmis-sions of these teachings-early, middle, and later-as well as for the protective deities. There are the instruction manuals for these themes written by Lochen Dharma Shri, and Nyedo Sonam Pal's instructions on the Zhije teachings. The auxiliary branch of the Zhije system is that of The Sacred Teachings on the Object of Severance. This section includes the primary sources for this approach, written by Aryadeva and Machik Lapdron-including The Teaching Essays, The Further Essays, The Heart Essays, and The Pinnacle Jewel of Wisdom-and the profound Heart Drop teachings. As for the ripening empow-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE :xxi erments, three traditions are included, those of the Zurmang, Jamyang Gonpo, and Gyalthangpa. The spiritual advice includes the instruction manuals for the three transmissions-early, mid-dle, and later. There is an activity ritual focusing on the feast offering, and one to honor the gurus of the Zhije School. 21 Volume 15 includes teachings from the last two of the eight lineages of accomplishment: that of Vajra Yoga (also known as the Six Branches of Union, or Jordruk) and Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup (Stages of Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras). The former is a system of advanced tantric practices based on the teach-ings of the KiHacakra tantra, particularly as transmitted through the Jonang tradition of Tibet. Though ostensibly a tantra of the Sarma tradition, the Kalacakra was also highly esteemed in the Nyingma school. The great Nyingma master Jamgon Ju Mipam Gyatso (1846-1912) wrote a two-vol-ume commentary on the Kalacakra cycle and considered the teachings of this tradition to reflect those found in the Dzogchen approach of the Nyingma. The final lineage is the least known among the eight, one transmitted by the master Orgyenpa Rinchen Pal (1230-1309), who was also a student of the second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi (1204-1283), and a teacher of the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339). Orgyenpa received this lineage, which incorporates practices also found in the Vajra Yoga approach, in a visionary transmission from Vajravariihi and other <;liikinis. Although the lineage continued unbroken until Kongtrul's time, it was another tradition that he considered \"exceedingly rare and in danger of dying out.\" Kongtrul described the contents of volume 15 in this way: The section dealing with the seventh system, that of the pro-found path of Vajra Yoga, includes the primary source-the quintessential Kalachakra Tantra-as well as instructions from the intimate oral lineage of Kalachakrapada and some small source texts by Shavaripa. There is the sadhana and offering ritual for the nine deity mandala, the extraordinary sublime empowerment and its instruction manuals and auxiliary texts, all authored by Jonang Jetsiin Rinpoche. The section includes The Profound Path: The Sphere of Nectar, the middle-length treatment of the Six Branches of Union from the tradition of Anupamarakshita; and the concise version entitled Touching the Tip of the Tongue to the Palate. There is a ritual to honor the gu-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"x.xii THE CATALOG rus of the tradition of the Six Branches of Union, as well as the authorizations for the form of Kalachakra with consort and the protective deity Vajravega. The section dealing with the eighth system, that of The Stages of Approach and Accomplishment for the Three Vajras, includes the primary source (which was bestowed on the maha.siddha Orgyenpa by Vajravarahi and the dakinis of the four families). There is also the explanatory commentary to this, as well as the instruction manuals and the methods for meditating to bring the stages of approach and accomplishment to consummation in a single sitting. 22 Volumes 16 and 17 contain what Kongtrul refers to as miscellaneous in-structions (Tib. khrid sna tshogs). In a traditional manner to ensure an auspi-cious conclusion to the collection, volume 17 contains transmissions focus-ing on the deities of longevity: the white Ta.ra, Amitayus, and U!?Q.il?avijaya. As Kongtrul writes: The ninth section of this collection contains a number of unre-lated teachings-spiritual advice that derives from various tra-ditions. These include the blessing ritual and instructions con-cerning the Eighty-Four Mahasiddhas; the individual empower-ments and instructions for The Six Instructions of Maitripa; the cycles of Mahakarunika Chittavishramana and The Threefold Quintessential Meaning as transmitted in the Zhalu tradition; the five definitive instructions on Avalokiteshvara; Thangtong Gyalpo's practice associated with the six-syllable mantra; the Mahamudra instructions and The Sutra Ritual of the Sage from the Bodong tradition; the instruction on chandali and the transfer-ence of consciousness transmitted by Rechen Paljor Zangpo; the \"mother transference\" of Rongti:in; the instructions on the \"seven lines of specific transmission\" according to the new translations of the Jonang tradition; and various kinds of alchemical procedures. The collection concludes in a positive manner with the au-thorizations for the three deities of longevity, the intimate oral lineage of the seven-day longevity sadhana, the instructions for the longevity practice of White Tara according to the tra-dition of Bari Lotsawa, and a ritual to honor the three deities of longevity. 23"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE xxiii In addition to the text of the catalog translated here, the eighteenth and final volume of The Treasury of Precious Instructions contains a collection of short texts collectively known as the 108 Instructions of the Jonang tradi-tion (Jo nang brgya rtsa), arranged by the Jonangpa master Jetsun Kunga Drolchok (1507-1566). Kongtrul held this collection, which contains ab-breviated versions of many of the teachings found in The Treasury, in great esteem, and in the catalog he describes its teachings as \"supports for all the foregoing [teachings].\" Whereas the volumes of The Treasury of Precious Instructions are arranged chronologically according to schools, the actual order in which the teach-ings are transmitted by masters to students follows a format that exempli-fies the model of the graduated path (Tib. lam rim). An account of such a transmission is found in a \"record of teachings received\" (Tib. thob yig) by the eighth Khamtrul Rinpoche, Dongyu Nyima (1930-1979). 24 This work, in the form of a diary, records. the teachings given by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche when he conferred the transmission of The Treasury of Precious Instructions at Khamtrul Rinpoche's center of Tashi Jong in Himachal Pradesh, India. The transmission began with a reading transmission of the catalog from volume 18 (\"to inspire confidence in the historical authentic-ity\" of the teachings, as Khamtrul Rinpoche put it), followed by a trans-mission of the teachings from the Sakya school known as Parting from the Four Attachments (Zhen pa bzhi bral) found in volume 6, and the Kadampa teachings on the graduated path to enlightenment (volumes 3 and 4). The transmissions then proceeded through the teachings of the Sakya (volumes 5 and 6), Marpa Kagyu (volumes 7 to 10), Shangpa Kagyu (volumes 11 and 12), Zhije and Cho (volumes 13 and 14), Vajra Yoga and Nyendrup (volume 15), and the miscellaneous instructions (volumes 16 and 17). The transmissions were then given for the first two volumes, those containing the Nyingma teachings. The transmissions from the 108 Instructions of the Jonang tradition were bestowed throughout the rest of the transmissions where appropriate, providing continuity as a kind of backbone to the entire process of transmission. 25 THE CATALOG The Catalog of The Treasury of Precious Instructions is an example of a popular genre known in Tibetan as dkar chag. This term is often translated as \"table of contents,\" and indeed I had originally chosen to render it that way. But the nature of this work (and of many dkar chag texts) goes far beyond the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxiv THE CATALOG structure and function of a table of contents in the Western sense.26 This is not simply a list of texts but a comprehensive account that places each of the texts-which are, in fact, listed at one point-in a much larger context. Kongtrul divides his catalog into five major topics. He first sets forth what he calls the purpose, by which he means not simply his reasons for compiling The Treasury of Precious Instructions but the purpose of the teach-ings it contains. In this section, he reminds us that the ultimate point of all Buddhist teachings lies in liberation from suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. He also discusses the Dharma as the means by which such a goal is reached, the qualifications of teacher and student and their relation-ship, and only then the compilation of The Treasury. In the second major section of The Catalog, Kongtrul gives a brief sur-vey of the historical development of Buddhism in India and Tibet. In out-lining the way the teachings came to Tibet, he bases his comments on the model of the eight lineages of accomplishment established by the Nyingma master Trengpo Terton Sherap Ozer (who is often referred to by Tibetans as PrajiUirasmi, which is the back-formation of his name in Sanskrit.) This model constitutes the structure of Kongtrul's entire Treasury of Precious Instructions. The third section is an analysis of how the teachings of each of these eight lineages are structured. Given that each lineage constitutes a complete path in itself, Kongtrul's concern was to preserve the integrity of each while demonstrating the themes common to them all. It is in the fourth major section of his catalog that Kongtrullists the actual texts he chose for inclusion in his Treasury, making this the section that most resembles a table of contents. His choices were not arbitrary: for each of the eight lineages, he consulted with holders of the respective traditions, and throughout the process of compiling The Treasury, he was guided by the ad-vice of his guru Jam yang Khyentse Wangpo, who was renowned as someone who held virtually every lineage extant at that time, including many that were rare and obscure. Kongtrul occasionally mentions texts in an order dif-ferent from the one in which they are now arranged in the actual volumes of The Treasury of Precious Instructions. This may be due to later editors' having rearranged the contents slightly. In the fifth and final section of The Catalog, Kongtrullays out the lineage of transmission for all the texts in his Treasury. In each case, he lists the suc-cessive holders of the lineage from its inception down to Kongtrul himself. Having received tl1e transmission allowed him not only to include the text in The Treasury of Precious Instructions but to transmit that lineage to oth-ers.

AN OTE ON THIS TRANSLATION This edition of An Ocean of Auspicious Renown: The Catalog of The Treasury of Precious Instructions is a preliminary one, prepared with some haste to co· incide with the unveiling of Tsadra Foundation's DNZ Project, the intention of which is eventually to produce English translations of the entire contents of The Treasury of Precious Instructions. As such, the present book lacks much of the apparatus, such as an index, that is planned for inclusion in a future edition; given the wealth of detail and information, both doctrinal and his-torical, contained in The Treasury, there will also no doubt be inaccuracies or omissions that will warrant correction. In choosing English names for the titles of Tibetan texts, I have relied in some cases on existing translations and in other cases have had to come up with my own provisional version, in full knowledge that another translator may hit upon a more useful English title in the future. To provide ease of pronunciation, Tibetan names have been rendered according to a simplified phonetic system, while titles of texts and technical terms have been given in a modified version of the system devised by Prof. Turrell V. Wylie. Sanskrit terms include diacritical marks, except in cases where a Sanskrit word has been accepted as part of English vocabulary by virtue of being included in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary or where passages cited from previously published works lack such diacritics. Where a Sanskrit name is my unconfirmed reconstruction from the Tibetan, I have observed the convention of preceding it with an asterisk. The numbers embedded in the translation in square brackets refer to the folios of the woodblock edition of the catalog found in volume 18 of the editions of The Treasury of Precious Instructions published by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (Paro, Bhutan, 1979-81) and Shechen Publications (Kathmandu, Nepal, 1991). Both of these editions are reproductions of the original wood-block edition printed at Jamgi:in Kongtrul's home monastery of Palpung in eastern Tibet. Those woodblocks were tragically destroyed during the Cultural Revolution that devastated so much of the Tibetan cultural and re-ligious heritage.

Timeless awareness is the quasi-subjective perceiver, 5 the facet of what is ultimatel:y true-supreme and utterly unchanging bliss-which is the totally perfect state of utter lu-cidity. Emptiness endowed with the sublime capacity to manifest in all ways is the quasi-object, what is relatively true, the dimension of illusion in which suchness arises in any and all ways as what is knowable. [3a] The oneness of these as equal in taste, not subject to any division, is spoken of in Mafi.ju.Sri: Web of Magical Illusion: buddhahood without beginning, without end; original buddhahood, undifferentiated ... 6 This is a reference to the state of primordial unity that requires no more training, 7 the enlightened dimension of innate timeless awareness, the state of the primordial lord protector, the supreme Vajradhara. This goes by limitless varieties of names and embodiments-Kalacakra, Vajrasattva, Guhyasamaja, Cakrasaqwara, Hevajra, and so forth. It is endowed with four aspects of transcendent perfection: • the transcendent perfection of sacred immaculacy, in that it does not serve as a basis for the continuation of habitual patterns; • the transcendent perfection of sacred presence in the ultimate sense, in that it constitutes the complete subsidence of all elaborations of identity or lack thereof; • the transcendent perfection of sacred bliss, in that it is not subject to any extraneous force but is the nondual perception of all that is know-able, in which any embodiment based on the nature of ordinary mind is eliminated and in which the habitual patterns of the nonrecognition of pure awareness are absent; and • the transcendent perfection of sacred constancy, in that, for as long as space itself endures, from the original moment of omniscient aware-ness onward there is no difference in its manifestation at earlier and later points in linear time."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 9 It is endowed with three aspects of supremacy: • a supreme state of elimination, in that all limitless aspects of adventi-tious distortion-the three levels of obscuration, 8 together with the habitual patterns they entail-have been eliminated; • a supreme state of realization, in that there is realization (requiring no deliberate examination) of knowable phenomena without exception, as being similar to the images in a diviner's mirror, an illusion, and so forth; and • a supreme state of mind, in that there is constant awareness, without any interruption, that permeates any and all ordinary beings, without any discrimination between near and far, ensuring the benefit of lim-itless beings for as long as space itself endures. In accord with the reference to buddhahood embodying the five kayas; sovereign lord embodying the five aspects of timeless awareness ... 9 it is that embodiment of the primordial unity of the five kayas and the five aspects of timeless awareness for which alone one should strive and of which one should gain accomplishment.

In particular, it is not possible to gain accomplishment of the sublimely un-changing state of primordial unity through any means other than by relying entirely on the unsurpassable swift path of the Vajrayana. The sacred Dharma subsumes the three higher trainings as its subject matter and the Three Collections as the presentations thereof. 14 If these are to be summarized, we may cite the master Vasubandhu: The sacred teachings of the Teacher are twofold, embodying scripture and realization. 15 They thus can be subsumed under the two headings of scripture and re-alization. Of these, the aspect of the Dharma as scripture is described in the Highest Continuum: The Dharma is that which is free of and brings freedom from attachment and is endowed with the characteristics of the two levels of truth. Freedom from attachment is subsumed within the truths of cessation and the path. 16 As this passage notes, that which is free of attachment is the truth of cessation, while that which brings freedom from attachment is the truth of the spiritual path. Of these, the truth of cessation is characterized as any context that, due to a focus on suchness itself, entails the cessation of anything associated with corruptibility 17-that is to say, the states of elim-ination on the paths of training and no more training, the state of nirvana that involves no residual traces, 18 and the dharmakaya of buddhahood as defined in the Mahayana approach. This is also referred to as the fruition state-the transcendence of sorrow (which is to say, suffering and the causes thereof) 19-irnbued with the seven attributes of peace and negating the four kinds of impermanence. The truth of the path is characterized as the means by which that cessa-tion is made fully evident, which constitutes incorruptible timeless aware-ness and its attendant factors-[ 4a] that is, the three paths of seeing, medi-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 11 tation, and no more training or (in the Mahayana context) the two paths of seeing and meditation. The attendant factors are the two paths of accumu-lation and linkage. 20 The aspect of the Dharma as scripture is characterized as the descriptions that allow one to gain access to the aspect of Dharma as realization-that is, the twelve branches of the Buddha's excellent speech, 21 which are appropri-ate causes that bring about realization of the true nature of reality. In this regard, there are also the two aspects of the Dharma as it is prac-ticed and the Dharma as it is explained. Of these, the former is endowed with four excellent qualities that allow the fruition state to be attained. These four excellent qualities are as follows: • It does not entail any factors of compulsion or perpetuation, for it leads to the citadel of nirvana and does not lead to that of samsara. • It is uninterrupted, for it connects one to nirvana without obstacles and with a continuity that is unchanging. • It causes no harm, for it is not affected by the thieving effects of desire and attachment and so forth. • It reveals itself in an intimate way, for it is fueled by the food of one's delight in the Dharma. As for the Dharma as it is explained, it is endowed with four functions that elucidate the factors of the spiritual path, for it demonstrates • what is attended to (\"This is the path\"); • what brings certainty about this (\"This is indeed the path, while any-thing else is not\"); • what elucidates the requirements for this (\"These factors, such as the four applications of mindfulness, are the causes of the path\"); and • the utter pacification of obscurations (\"The obscurations of karma, afflictive states, and obstacles to longevity cause hindrances on the path\"). Concerning the Dharma as it is explained, a text states: All the teachings of Dharma are subsumed in two categories, the Buddha's words and the treatises-respectively, what was spoken in an excellent manner and the commentaries on the intent of that."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"12 THE CATALOG Due to the power of these, the teachings of Sakyamuni will endure for a long time in this world.22 This is a reference to the two divisions of (1) what was \"spoken in an excellent manner\" in some ten ways23 and (2) the treatises that comment on the enlightened intent of the former. l. THE BuDDHA's WoRDS As for the first of these divisions, the Buddha's words are concerned with both what is forever meaningful in the greatest sense and what is connect-ed to the accomplishment of that meaning. Their function is to eliminate all the limitless afflictive mental states associated with the three realms of existence. They set forth the benefits and advantages of the fruition state of peace-that is, nirvana, the transcendence of sorrow. [4b] They derive from the enlightened deeds of buddhahood as their governing condition.24 They may be classified as follows:25 • According to the chronological order in which the Buddha spoke them, there are three cycles: the initial, the intermediate, and the final.26 • From the perspective of their subject matter, they concern the two levels of truth. 27 • From that of their presentation, there are the twelve branches of the Buddha's sublime speech. • In accord with the categories that are associated with the antidotes they discuss-that is, the factors to be eliminated, those to be adopted, and those to be understood-there are the Three Collections. 28 • From the perspective of the greater or lesser capacity of those who are to be guided by these teachings, there are the two approaches of the Hlnayana and Mahayana, the latter further consisting of the dialecti-cal approach (in which the path is based on causes) and the mantra approach (in which the path is based on the fruition). • Again from the point of view of the governing conditions, there are the words of the Buddha that were communicated directly, those that came about through blessings, and those that came about through permission being granted. 29 Given the foregoing categories, in this great Treasury are found teachings that cover the entire meaning of what is to be put into practice according to"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 13 all three cycles of teachings, with emphasis on the ultimate level of truth, a focus on the category of the most extensive teachings, and a presentation most especially of the higher trainings in mind30 and meditative absorption. They explain solely the Mahayana, particularly the Mantrayana approach within that, and are based on vajra verses and other such sources that were communicated directly. 2. THE COMMENTARIAL TREATISES As for the treatises, the authors were those whose minds were undistracted by afflictive mental states and who explained the meaning of the Buddha's teaching according to its vastness and profundity, so that their writings were in accord with the path that brings about the attainment of liberation. These treatises correct the ongoing experience of those who hear their teachings, turning them away from the three mental poisons and imbuing them with the three higher trainings, thus protecting them from lower states of rebirth and the suffering of conditioned existence. 31 While there are many ways to categorize such treatises, they are de-scribed in the Categories of the Levels in nine ways according to superior and inferior kinds of writings: Buddhist sastras are held to be devoid of these six flaws and to have these three positive qualities.32 That is to say, they are devoid of six flaws found in inferior kinds of treatises, instead being endowed with meaning, being concerned with the elimination of suffering, and placing great emphasis on spiritual practice. It is with these three kinds of sublime and authentic treatises that this Treasury is filled. In particular, the Mantrayana approach was taught by the sambhoga-kaya, endowed with the seven attributes of integration33 or (in certain cases) the sublime nirmfu).akaya. 34 In a few cases, teachings came about through blessings or through permission being granted. [5a] In such ways the wheel of Dharma was turned uninterruptedly for those to be guided-masters of awareness and hosts of Q.akas and yoginis-in places that appeared to be different, through the echolike quality of all sound in its ineffable nature. In the case of the anuttarayoga tantras, these were taught in an envi-ronment that transcends the scope of ordinary conceptual frameworks and characteristics: the \"basic space of phenomena,\" the \"unchanging ultimate"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"14 THE CATALOG abode,\" the \"source of phenomena,\" the \"palace of supreme liberation,\" the \"immeasurable mansion of supreme and inconceivable bliss,\" the \"bhaga of the Vajra Queen,\" and so forth. According to more relative interpretations, some were taught in such locations as Akani~tha,35 Tu~ita,36 the summit of Sumeru, and the stupa of SridhanyakatakaY In these environments the original buddha arose in the form of the central deity of a specific manda-la-as Vajradhara, Kalacakra, and so forth-so that the natural dynamic expression of timeless awareness was that of the inseparability of teacher and retinue in the nafure of being as the single state of supreme bliss. This caused the turning of the wheel of Dharma to manifest within that context as a constant process without interruption through the supreme secret of the indestructible resonance of vajra sound. These teachings were collected by Guhyapati,38 Vajragarbha, and others of the retinues (though in no way other than the teachers), so that at least a portion of them became accessible to fortunate people in the human realm. This entire vast range of the classes of tantra was elucidated in commentaries authored by powerful lords of the tenth level of realization and accomplished masters, and in the holy coun-try of India and other regions many people of the highest acumen pursued the practice of these teachings and gained high levels of accomplishment, in turn conferring the profound meaning of the classes of tantra as advice to fortunate individuals who were to be guided. These instructions were transmitted from sublime incarnate scholars and translators over successive generations, so that they came to this land39 at the invitation of our merit. In the land of Tibet, furthermore, there were great and holy beings who were exemplars of the excellent speech of the Victorious One and who had perceived the true nature of reality just as it is. This great Treaswy brings together in a single collection much wealth that constitutes the precious and profound instructions from the majority of the most famous of these masters. In the case of the Early Translation school of the Nyingma tradition in particular, there are three lineages: • the lineage of the mind-to-mind transmission by victorious ones, in which the timeless awareness of the three kayas of the teacher arises as its own natural manifestation; [Sb] • the lineage of transmission through symbols by masters of awareness (Garap Dorje, the five exalted masters of holy heritage, and others), in which the entire meaning of the teachings was completely absorbed simply through the use of something symbolic; and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 15 • the lineage of oral transmission by human individuals, in which teach-ings were transmitted through speech from one person to the ear of another, in cases such as that of the king Jal).. Due to the uninterrupted transmission through these three lineages, this collection contains the quintessence of the profound meaning found in the instructions of the categories of Mind, Expanse, and Direct Transmission in the ati approach (the pinnacle of the three great approaches based on skillful method that bring mastery), 40 as well as such texts as the instruction manual for the Vajrasattva cycle Web of Magical Display from the mahayoga approach. Concerning such precious teachings, the master Vasubandhu stated: It is this and this alone that is to be upheld, discussed, and put into practice.41 That is to say, those aspects of the sacred Dharma that constitute the scriptural tradition must be upheld through the activities of explaining, listening to, studying, and contemplating them; while those aspects of the sacred Dharma that constitute the experientially based tradition must be upheld through applying training in one's ongoing experience, practicing and meditating on their meaning. In the holy country of India, it was the great monastic communities and such figures as the \"six ornaments who adorn the human world,\"42 the \"four great ones,\" the \"two superb masters,\"43 the \"six learned gatekeepers,\" and the successive abbots of Vajrasana, who primarily guarded the scriptural tradition through the three activities of explaining teachings, debating, and composing commentaries. And it was the countless masters who ap-peared-as exemplified by the eighty-four mahasiddhas, such as the vener-able master Paramasva; the Great Brahmin and his spiritual son; the three masters LUipada, Ghal).~apada, and Kp~Q.apada; Kalacakrapada the Elder and Younger; and Tilopa44-who primarily upheld the experientially based tra-dition through spiritual practice. In this land of Tibet, moreover, the teachings of the Victorious One were guarded by the ten great pillars upholding the lineages of exegesis45 empha-sizing the profound path of the theoretical underpinnings of the teachings, and those who held the lineages of the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment emphasizing that of tl1e practical application."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"16 THE CATALOG C. METHOD OF PRACTICE In general, let us consider the case of any jndividuals who have experienced a sense of disenchantment with the sufferings of samsara and who seek liberation from these as their goal, following the precious teaching's of the Buddha and pursuing the stages of practice of the sacred Dharma.[6a] At the outset, they must rely on a mentor, who is the foundation of the spiritual path. According to the Compendiwn:46 \"The teachings of the Buddhadharma depend on spiritual mentors\": the Victorious One spoke of them as being endowed with the most sublime of all qualities. This and other sources refer to the qualifications of a master, a spiritual mentor who is validated as such through countless reasons supported by both scripture and reasoning. There are so many such qualifications, de-pending on the specific contexts of higher and lower approaches, that it would be difficult to reach a point where they had been explained adequate-ly. However, the factors that are indispensable are three: (1) intelligence based on wisdom, (2) an attitude of Joyjng-kindness, and (3) forbearance in one's actions. That is to say: 1. The qualities of wisdom are those of one being learned concerning the words of the teachings to be explained and the meaning of those words, being able to resolve others' doubts, presenting one's discussions in an el-egant fashion, being worthy of honor due to one's virtuous conduct, and being wise concerning the appropriate conduct or the qualifications of the recipients of teachings. 2. Ideally, one would have compassion that is not mere lip service but constitutes the desire to bring all ordinary beings to the state of supreme enlightenment. On a middling level, one would have the altruistic attitude of wishing to bring those who are glided by one's teachings to the level of buddhahood. At the very least, one must definitely have the compassion to explain the teachings without regard for material gain, but with the inten-tion that constitutes the desire that others who receive the teachings under-stand the meaning of what is explained precisely and benefit thereby; for without the latter one will commit the flaw of selling the Dharma."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 17 3. As well, one must certainly have the forbearance not to be discouraged by difficulties encountered when explaining the teachings, the forbearance to entertain questions from students, and the forbearance to be challenged by others and be able to answer their objections. In this collection, The Treasury of Precious Instructions, with the foregoing being taken to be the minimum requirements, one must in addition be en-gaged in the three levels of ordination, understand the words and meanings of the teachings to be explained, and have undertaken practice of the main points of the instructions concerned, so that one has gained some degree of personal experience. Although there are many discussions of the characteristics of a student, principally this should be someone who does not rely on fame and profit in this lifetime, is not competitive with others, and is not simply interested in \"collecting\" teachings by requesting and receiving anything and everything. Rather, he or she should be someone who strives wholeheartedly for libera-tion, whose mind is stable in the three aspects of faith that are the foundation of all positive factors, [6b] and who puts into practice the teachings he or she has heard as much as possible in accord with his or her level of understanding. Once the interdependence between mentor and student has been estab-lished, the latter relies on the former in the appropriate manner, pleasing the teacher to whichever of the three degrees one is capable of ensuring. Then, as the Treasury of Abhidhanna states: Maintaining discipline and endowed with study and contemplation, one applies oneself intensively to meditationY That is to say, as a basis for the development of positive qualities, one accepts whatever level of training in ethical discipline one is capable of and upholds that in the appropriate manner. It is of course the case that the more one can study the excellent teachings of the Victorious One, the better. But in particular one should study in detail the stages on the paths of the three spiritual models, which are an infallible path to integrate one's mind with the sacred Dharma, one that involves no regression. If the meaning of what one has heard is merely left as a superficial under-standing based on a single exposure, it will have no impact on one's ongoing experience, so investigate it in detail, reflecting on it over and over. This will ensure that one's fixation on the perceptions and consciousness associated with this lifetime will be undermined on a deep level, giving rise to a truly"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"18 THE CATALOG extraordinary intention to strive for the definitive excellence of enlighten-ment in the future. All this being the case, if we examine the majority of activities in which we ourselves and others engage, presumptuously assuming these to be spir-itual practice, they prove to be cases of dharma as theory, dharma as a means of livelihood, dharma as a hobby, dharma as a way of decorating one's life. Know that these not only are of no benefit for our future lifetimes, they can even cause harm. This will arouse a sense of enthusiasm to pursue meditation and spiritual practice of dharma in the true sense. As the exalted Nagarjuna says: Hearing teachings is what causes one's intelligence to expand; if one also contemplates, with both of these factors one can then apply oneself intensively to meditation. Unsurpassable attainment comes from that. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of individuals who apply them-selves to spiritual practice that focuses on what is profoundly meaningful. For those fortunate ones who have already trained, it is appropriate to teach the profound path all at once. Those who lack the good fortune to practice focusing on the profound meaning at the outset, or those who are beginning practitioners, should proceed like someone climbing a flight of stairs, so it would be best to instruct them in the stages of the paths of the three spiritual models. In Lamp That Integrates Conduct we read the following: In order for ordinary beings who are beginning practitioners [7a] to embrace what is ultimately meaningful, these means were classified by the perfect Buddha like successive steps in a flight of stairs. And according to the Two Sections, in consideration of those who are lacking in good fortune and difficult to guide: At the outset, confer the ordination for spiritual renewal and training. In such sources, there are extensive treatments of this developmental pro-cess of engagement. In addition, as is stated in the earlier and later editions of the Primer:"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The greatest medicine for one who proceeds in stages would be poison for one who proceeds all at once. PURPOSE 19 The greatest medicine for one who proceeds all at once would be poison for one who proceeds in stages. Therefore, for those with the carryover from previous training, one should present the mode to proceed all at once. For beings who are beginning practitioners, one should present the mode to proceed by stages. With respect to one's receiving the transmissions of this collection, The Treasury of Precious Instrnctions, in general each of the traditions of the eight mainstream lineages of accomplishment is, in and of itself, a special and pro-found path and the complete range of stages in the attainment of enlighten-ment. Thus, in accord with each person's interest and mental ability, what-ever one might desire in the way of instruction is available in each of these traditions, whether the complete transmission or selected stages. And so this collection is entirely sufficient, even though the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions constitute extractions from these traditions. And although in the case of major systems of instructions there is no way that these can be imparted before the maturing process of empowerment has taken place, one should make the distinction that in certain cases-such as teachings on the graduated path and minor instructions-the conferral of an empowerment is not necessary. On occasions when the entire collection is being transmitted and received, the way the volumes are organized is chronological, according to the earlier and later historical periods during which these profound teachings came to Tibet. But when the transmission is being given, it must be in accord with the developmental stages of the teachings, and so the transmission begins with the Kadampa teachings on the graduated path. Following the comple-tion of the Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup teachings, the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions for the three categories of the Great Perfection approach are conferred. Other, more minor instructions are transmitted in-termittently where convenient. It would be excellent if the instructions on longevity practice were used to bring everything to a positive conclusion. In this regard, if there are students who are householders and, as such, hold no ordination, some form of ordination from the Individual Liberation system-such as lay ordination, or whatever they are capable of upholding-is conferred. [7b] As the initial part of the instruction in the superior spiri-tual model, the ordination ceremony for arousing bodhicitta is performed,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"20 THE CATALOG from both the lineage of profound view and that of extensive conduct. As a preliminary to each of the major systems of instruction, the empowerment is conferred in accord with the respective tradition's way of carrying this out. Instructions that require a specific number of days, such as that of Parting from the Four Attachments, are transmitted in that way. The 108 Instructions of Jetsun Kunga Drolchok48 must be taken as the foundation of the entire collection in general, and so before any of these transmissions the preliminary practices of these instructions and the medi-tation and mantra repetition of Samayavajra are explained, and during the evening session everyone participates in that meditation and mantra. For the actual transmissions, it is my lord guru's method to confer them each in three versions: a brief presentation, an extensive explanation, and a con-cluding summary. So, the lineage supplication is recited at the outset in each case, the history of the specific instruction is related, and a mandala offering is performed. The teachings that are contained in the 108 Instructions are identified separately and read once, which constitutes the brief presenta-tion. Next, the source text of the respective instruction is explained exten-sively. Then the 108 Instructions are transmitted once again as a series, which constitutes the concluding summary. But in fact the order in which these are given need not necessarily be the one that is found in the text of the 108 Instructions. This can be illustrated by the fact that it would be, for example, fine to confer, in conjunction with the teachings on the graduated path, those instructions that are akin to those teachings, or the instructions on the view of the Middle Way. So the instructions that pertain to the sutra tradition can be given in conjunction with the teachings on the graduated path; those that pertain to specific mainstream traditions can be added to the transmissions of those respective traditions. As for those instructions on the stage of completion for the classes of tantra that are not included in the foregoing case, it would be fine to give them in conjunction with the Kagyu transmissions. As this indicates, one can include within the transmission of a given lineage any instructions that share some affinity with the authentic origins of that lineage, in whatever way is convenient. Once the instructions have been transmitted in their.entirety, it would be ideal if one were to add the reading transmission for the text of the 108 Instructions. As is stated in the sutra White Lotus of the Sacred Dharma, in any situa-tion in which teachings are being transmitted and received, the preparation involves arranging offerings on the shrine, offering prayers of supplication to the Jewels, repeating mantras to put an end to negative influences, and imbuing oneself with love for the audience. Especially in cases of transmit-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 21 ting tantric instructions, when they are being explained it is unsuitable to transmit or receive them with ordinary ideas, so one should never lose the clear impression of the universe being a pure mandala, of the one explaining the teachings being a master of the tantras, and so forth. [Sa] During the actual transmission, one explains the teaching while embody-ing the six transcendent perfections. In conclusion, one prays for forgiveness of one's errors, dedicates the virtue to the enlightenment of all, and applies the perspective of a nonconceptual state of awareness. Those hearing the teachings avoid the three flaws of a vessel, the six distortions, anything inappropriate to the activity at hand, the five flaws of incorrect retention, and so forth. With the intelligence that allows one to gain understanding, the determination to seek teachings, devotion that is devoid of pride, and one-pointed faith, they prepare by imbuing themselves with the intention to practice the teachings, engaging in conduct that expresses devotion through the three avenues of their being, and taldng joy in ensuring the circumstanc-es for them to hear the Dharma. During the actual transmission, they listen while embodying the six transcendent perfections. In conclusion, they pray for forgiveness of their errors, dedicate the virtue to the enlightenment of all, and pay homage as a thanksgiving gesture. One should act in accord with the foregoing explanations. 0. PURPOSE OF COMPILING THE TREASURY OF PRECIOUS INSTRUCTIONS This is twofold: the actual purpose of compiling this collection and the ben-efits and advantages of doing so. I. THE ACTUAL PURPOSE Generally speaking, in each of the eight great mainstream lineages of accom-plishment there exists such a profound and vast range of authentic sources from the sutra and tantra traditions, and such limitless cycles of scriptures and pith instructions, that no one could compile everything. And in such cases as that of the Early Translation school (with the empowerments for the peaceful and wrathful deities and the explanations of the tantra Web of Magical Display, which is the foundation of the mahayoga approach, and the empowerment for the Discourse of the Gathering of the anuyoga approach); of the six main scriptural sources of the Kadampa; of the \"explanation to the multitude\" from the Lamdre tradition; and of the teachings on Mahamudra and the Six Dharmas from the Dakpo tradition-in such cases, even now-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"22 THE CATALOG adays the institutions for the transmitting and receiving of these teachings that are entirely self-sufficient are widespread and flourishing, so that one certainly need have no concern for these traditions. There are, however, special auxiliary teachings in the foregoing tradi-tions-instructions and ancient texts-that are rare, with barely a contin-uous line of the reading transmission still extant, as well as the traditions of the Shangpa, the Zhije, the Nyendrup, and so forth, in which the lines of transmission are exceedingly rare and in danger of dying out. With an altruistic desire to benefit these lines of teachings and with great diligence, I have sought out the three components of empowerments, reading trans-missions, and instructions for them and compiled them so that all this will prove to be of use. As well, in the foregoing cases I have not had to rely solely on extensive lineages that are like rotting strands of old rope on the point of breaking. My lord guru, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, received seven great modes of personal transmission. [Sb] The first of these modes involved him making enormous efforts to receive the extensive transmissions of the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment, which he did to a consummate degree; the accounts of how he received individual direct lineages through these modes of transmission are clearly described in a separate text. I sup-plicated him again and again concerning all the transmissions I had not received previously, and with great delight he bestowed these on me like one vase filling another. And that was not all, for he did me the great honor of granting me a quite extraordinary authorization, formally appointing me as a master who could explain, write about, and practice these teachings. Even regarding most of the transmissions that I had previously received, I nevertheless persistently requested these from him for the purpose of re-ceiving them as direct lineages of his blessings. So my own enthusiasm for assembling this great collection of advice-which is like a wish-fulfilling gem, flawless and yielding all that is desirable just as one wishes-has been firmly rooted in me, and I feel this is also a way of fulfilling the enlightened intentions of my gurus and those of the lineages involved. 2. THE BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES Let me speak briefly about the benefits and advantages of this undertaking. Generally speaking, there are enormous benefits and advantages to listening to or explaining the sacred Dharma. As we read in the compilation of teach-ings on the bodhisattva approach:"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 23 Through hearing teachings, one comes to understand phenomena. Through hearing teachings, one turns away from harmful actions. Through hearing teachings, one abstains from what is meaningless. Through hearing teachings, one attains nirvana. As well, the master Vasubandhu illustrated the benefits and advantages of hearing teachings in three groups of five points, employing analogies. There are a great many such benefits and advantages to hearing teachings. As for the benefits and advantages of explaining teachings, in the sutras we read the following: One who, in order to benefit someone, presents my teachings in the appropriate manner shows me honor; the Victorious One is not shown honor with flowers, perfumes, or lamps. Such passages show that this is the unsurpassable offering one can make to the Buddha. Further, the sutra Maitreya, the Lion's Roar states: Some may fill the world with as much gold as there are grains of sand in the Ganges and give it generously, but to speak a single verse of teachings in these evil times holds so much more benefit than that. This and other sources indicate that explaining the teachings is far supe-rior to any other generosity on the material level, and thus it is of the most sublime benefit. Through generosity of the dharma, one recalls former lifetimes. [9a] Such citations state that explaining the teachings serves as a cause for gaining the powers of complete recall and deeper discernment. The sutra Discourse That Arouses Altruistic Intent discusses some twenty benefits and advantages to being generous with the dharma without regard for material gain; as this indicates, one's merit thus flourishes and one will attain en-lightenment."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"24 THE CATALOG Both explaining and listening to teachings stabilize the spiritual potential of those· in the three approaches, bring one erudition that others respect, uphold the teachings, and bring about the attainment of enlightenment-the benefits and advantages are truly inconceivable! The Demonstration of the Secret of the Tathdgata.s states: As for the merit of upholding the sacred Dharma, even if all buddhas spoke continuously about this for a million aeons, they would indeed never describe it entirely. And in the sutra Discourse Requested by Sagaramati we read: To uphold the sacred Dharma of the tathagatas is to be completely upheld by the victorious ones; it is to. be completely cared for by gods, nagas, and kiqmaras and completely imbued with merit and timeless awareness .... through joy and mental bliss one becomes enlightened, awal<ening to buddhahood. These and other such sources speak of immeasurable benefits and advan-tages. The benefits and advantages of explaining or listening to the dharma of the Mahayana approach are even greater still. In the context of the ground state, the Prajfiaparamita literature speaks of these activities outshining all that pertains to the Hinayana approach, nurturing the potential that is the fundamental constituent of our being, and so forth. In the context of the spiritual path, the Highest Continuum speaks of them eliminating all obscu-rations without exception and ensuring merit far greater than any other ac-tivity. And in the context of the fruition state, the Ornament of the Mahiiyiina Sutra.s explains that they make evident the state of onmiscience. In particular, it is said that there are immeasurable benefits and advan-tages to upholding the sacred Dharma in such times as the present day, when the teachings of the Victorious One are close to disappearing. To cite from the sutra Discourse of the One Known a.s the Exalted Avalokite5vara: Those who henceforth uphold this sutra will forever be my beloved children. Although a million buddhas praise them, [9b]"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"PURPOSE 25 they will never be finished with that praise .... More than those who show honor to thousands of buddhas (or even to hundreds of millions) for as many aeons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, someone who, when the sacred Dharma spoken by the Lord of the World is disappearing, upholds it day and night has far greater merit .... By upholding the Dharma of the sublime Victorious One when it is disappearing, one gains a very fine body, lovely to behold; is beloved of men and women and gods; and is happy, learned, praiseworthy, and possessed of intelligence. In whoever's presence the divine of the divine, the Teacher endowed with ten powers, thoroughly explained this sutra, such a sutra as this will, in the future, come into that person's hands. Furthermore, as we read in Spiritual Categories of the Supreme Amassing of the Rare and Sublime: In this regard, Sariputra, having embarked authentically on the Mahayana approach, once one has perceived such intolerable, such unworthy circumstances, under which the sacred Dharma is utterly disappearing, one arouses the force of a great diligence in the following way: One thoroughly listens to sutras such as this one, to teachings in the categories found in the collections of teachings on the bodhisattva approach. One memorizes them, one commits them to writing, one ensures that others understand them, and one teaches them on a vast scale, in an utterly authentic manner. Moreover, one gives rise to four ideas. What are these four? \"This body of teachings that I have, which I inherited from my forefathers, will utterly disappear. Since Sakyamuni, the Transcendent and Accomplished Conqueror, the Tathagata, the arhat, the samyaksaqibuddha, engaged in austerities for hun-dreds of thousands of millions of aeons for the sake of these"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"26 THE CATALOG teachings, therefore I will ensure that the teachings are not al-tered. I will thoroughly master them. I will uphold them. I will ensure that they do not come to naught!\" One thus arouses one's diligence in the following way: [lOa] Sariputra, say for example that someone had a child, and that child-beloved, lovely, attractive, and in no way at odds with that person-were about to fall over a great precipice. That per-son would seize the child by the hand with the fixed thought, the utterly fixed thought, \"May this being not fall into this hell-ish abyss!\" In a similar manner, Sariputra, those holy beings who have faith in me, who would absolutely never forsake this unsurpass-able Jewel of the Dharma, and who hope to attain nirvana, in those times they completely uphold the sacred Dharma, and so to them I entrust this sublime state of enlightenment. It is thus. 0 Sariputra, suppose for example that, in the midst of a great battle, for the sake of protecting many people, those who arrange themselves in front of the opposing forces turn out to be few; and furthermore, that those whose courage proves worthy of the challenge and who will emerge victorious in battle arrange themselves during that great and terrible battle in front of many people. Similarly, Sariputra, at the point that the sacred Dharma is extremely close to disappearing, whosoever with al-truistic intent desires to attain complete nirvana, and so dons their strong armor with stable courage and diligence, arouses the force of that great diligence and emerges victorious in the battle with the maras. They thus realize to at least some small degree the vital essence of such a Jewel as that of the Dharma. Why is this so? Sariputra, not to rejoice in the complete re-jection of even a four-line verse of teaching, but to proclaim to many people \"This Buddha explained this\" and to help them understand it is to rejoice in what is explained in an excellent manner by the buddhas, the transcendent and accomplished conquerors of the past, the present, and the future. 0 Sariputra, I would not say, \"The consequences of the merit of such individ-uals is small.\" [lOb] Rather, they are endowed with an amassing of merit that is equal to space in its extent.

Until death one should have a devoted interest in emptiness. Sariputra, if one has the four foregoing qualities, at that point, at that time-a time when the sacred Dharma is utterly disappearing, a time when the sacred dharma is on the wane, a time when many pervert the ethical standards, a time when many harken to the furtive words of rank materialists, a time when the age is degenerating, a time when beings are degener-ating, a time when longevity is degenerating, a time when afflic-tive mental states are degenerating, a time when belief systems are degenerating-one should abide in these qualities through-out the three times. One should continue to pacify conflict thor-oughly. One should not become separated from the enlighten-ment of buddhahood. Sariputra, one should abide completely like this throughout the three times! To quote again from the sutra Discourse Requested by Sagaramati: To uphold the sacred Dharma of the tathagatas is to repay the kindness shown by the tathagatas. To uphold the treasury of the victorious ones and be stable in that intent is to make offerings to buddhas in the ten directions. One could fill with jewels many realms seen by the eyes of the buddhas and offer these to the tathagatas, but at the point that these were exhausted, the amassing of one's merit would not have increased as it does by one's upholding the Dharma .... Although the qualities and benefits and advantages of these actions might be described by speaking without interruption for an aeon, one could never completely finish describing the benefits and advantages of upholding the sacred Dharma."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"28 THE CATALOG As these and other passages indicate, this issue is spoken of on a vast scale. [lla] Compared to the foregoing cases, the benefits and advantages of transmit-ting, receiving, meditating on, and practicing the unsurpassable teachings, both general and specific, of the Vajrayana, the secret mantra approach, are significantly greater-many hundreds and thousands of times greater. For it is even rarer for the Vajrayana to appear than for a buddha to do so. It is due only to the strength of our Teacher's special resolve to guide beings who were not being guided in these times of strife that these teachings appeared. Otherwise, as it is said, they have not appeared, are not appearing, and will not appear in the teachings of all buddhas of the three times. This being the case, it is stated extensively throughout the classes of tantras that, for exam-ple, those who write out the profound tantras, or carry them on their person, or read them, and who meditate on their meaning are gazing on the vajra state of enlightenment itself. To give one example, from the tantra Heaped Jewels of the Early Translation school: Therefore, people who uphold this secret tantra gain empowerment into their respective families. Merely by carrying this tantra on one's person, one becomes an emanation of Vajradhara. All who read this tantra have the entire meaning of the view arise in their minds. All who write it out enjoy the enlightened speech of all buddhas. 49 And from the Supreme Array of Ati: If one makes offerings to, praises, and shows honor to this unsurpassable and most excellent secret, both sublime and more ordinary attainments will come to one just as one wishes. By merely carrying it on one's person, one possesses the oral transmission and pith instructions. And that is not all.

This situation is discussed in the source tantra of Cakrasa111vara: Through seeing, touching, hearing, and recalling, one becomes freed of all effects of harmful action, right then and there, without doubt .... [11 b] The supreme and timeless awareness of the glorious heruka has all the attributes of total purity. It is the water of bliss for the practitioner. Nondual, it is nonduality itself. Contact with one who is engaged in nonduality is purifying, overcoming the effects of harmful actions. Through contact or speech, one becomes free of all effects of harmful actions. With this freedom from all effects of harmful actions, one's body is pure and without flaw. One is a sublime person who is completely refined. One attains the level of a tathagata who is completely pure of all effects of harmful actions. Completely free of all effects of harmful actions, one is born into the family of the tathagatas and becomes a monarch who possesses spiritual values. The reasoning behind these statements is thus: It is said that those yogins who pursue practice are constantly being blessed by the glorious heruka, while all c;lakas and c;lakinis-such as Heruka and Vajravarahi-are actually present in their heart centers, engaging passionately in union with them in a state of delight and love. They therefore are born simultaneously with those yogins, so that beings who forge any connection with them-through see-ing, hearing, thinking of, or touching them-amass enormous merit thereby. The same source states: There is no doubt that one is constantly engaged in play with the great hero. In the heart center dwells Varahi. One abides in union with me and with c;lakas and c;lakinis and heralds."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"30 THE CATALOG Beings gain merit by seeing anyone who is truly born with these. Having studied and contemplated any sutra or tantra, in the final analy-sis one must integrate that by applying oneself to meditation and spiritual practice. For if one becomes distracted by merely talking about the teach-ings, not only will there be no meaningful result, but as the sutra Discourse Exhorting One to Altruism points out, there are a great many flaws in taking delight in such talk. And if one does not meditate on the authentic nature of reality, even though one were to embrace the teachings of the Buddha and hear and contemplate the sacred Dharma on the level of mere words, no matter how much one did so this would produce only a temporary result; [12a] one would not gain the consummate state of total freedom. This fact is spoken of using numerous analogies as, for example, in the following pas-sage from the Array of Stems: These teachings of the perfect Buddha are not realized through one's simply hearing them. To give an analogy, in certain cases a mighty river can carry off those who are weak while others die of thirst; the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma. One might give food and drink to many beings but die of hunger oneself; the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma. Certain physicians may possess all medicines but still die of some virulent disease; the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma. In treasure houses of riches there may be great numbers of jewels to be counted but not even a single gem that one may own; the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.

One might stand at the crossroads and proclaim to everyone what is excellent yet still not obtain it oneself; the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma. In addition, if one does not meditate, one's mind can fall under the sway of afflictive mental states, and one will fall into a lower state of rebirth, as we read in the sutra Discourse on the Complete Display: If one has not realized the nature of mind, one falls under the in-fluence of the conceptual thought process of ordinary mind and circles through the three realms, wandering into the six states of unenlightened being. In these and other such passages, this point is discussed extensively in the sutras and sastras. The merit of meditating on the authentic nature of reality, however, is incalculable. According to the sutra Discourse Demonstrating Suchness Itself: [12b] 0 Sariputra, greater than the merit of someone who listens to teachings for an entire aeon is that of someone who for the duration of a finger snap cultivates meditative absorption fo-cusing on suchness itself. Given that that is so, Sariputra, you should strongly advise others about this meditative absorption of suchness itself.

Why is this so?"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"32 THE CATALOG Because it ensures that one is separated by a great distance from the path of birth and death. And the sutra Discourse on Expanding One's Realization states: If one engages in a single session of meditative stability, this is more meaningful than if one were to save the lives of as many people as would fill the three realms. Furthermore, it is said that cultivating meditative absorption undermines one's fixation on sense pleasures, resolves issues on which one is indecisive, arouses powers of deeper discernment and absorption, awakens supreme compassion, brings insight into the significance of the authentic nature of reality, ensures that one is capable of bringing those to be guided to enlight-enment, and so forth. To cite from the sutra the Compendium: Through meditative stability, one downplays and casts aside sense pleasures. Once actually gains spiritual potential, powers of deeper dis-cernment, and meditative absorption. And according to the Ten Cycles of K$itigarbha: By cultivating meditative absorption, one resolves doubts, but without that realization, one cannot do so by other means. Therefore, since the cultivation of meditative absorption is most excellent, the wise will pursue it intently. In the Authentic Consolidation of Qualities we read the following: By resting the mind in equipoise, one will gain insight into the authentic nature just as it is.

The great learned and accomplished master Prajfiarasmi stated: As prophesied by the Victorious One, the lord protectors of beings in the Land of Snows, whose principal intent was solely and entirely concerned with the teachings, were the rulers who were the unique and divine figures among the spiritual kings of old.

[13b] The heart essence of these teachings lies in the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplish-ment, made up of those who upheld the extensive traditions of the Early Translation school of Nyingma, the Kadampa, the Lamdrepa, the Marpa Kagyu, the Shangpa Kagyu, the Zhije and associated teachings, the Jordruk, and the Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrub.

The manifestation of innate compassionate responsiveness as \"other\" was that of the victorious ones of the five families, who revealed limitless approaches based on skillful methods of empowerment and transformation to bodhisattvas on the ten ·levels of realization. In the pinnacle realm of Akani~tha in the immaculate abodes, the sambhogakaya appropriate to that realm taught the \"approaches that lead away from the all-pervasive origin of suffering\" and the \"approach-es that evoke awareness through ascetic practices.\" The Great Perfection teachings were codified by Vajrasattva, those of anuyoga by the master of awareness Kunjara, and those of mahayoga by Vajradharma and others. These teachings were entrusted to the lords of the three families and to the c;lakini Lekyi Wangmo and others. Teachers and retinues in these cases abided in the equality of enlightened intent, the dharma being such that there was no sense of someone being taught distinct from someone doing the teaching, but due to its manifesting simply as a mode that derives from the dynamic energy of timeless awareness, there is the \"lineage of mind-to-mind transmission of victorious ones.\" The atiyoga teachings were transmitted successively to the child of the gods Adhicitta, Garap Dorje, Mafijusrimitra, Srisirpha, Vimalamitra, and others."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 37 The teachings of anuyoga and mahayoga were demonstrated through mere symbols to the lords of the three families, the five exalted masters of holy heritage, and others, whereupon they thoroughly mastered these teachings.

The Lord of Secrets revealed himself to King Jal:t in a vision and con-ferred empowerment on him. The transmission then passed successively to Kukuraja, Indrabodhi, 51 Sirp.haraja, and other human masters of awareness. This is the \"lineage of oral transmission by human individuals.\" Thus, through the foregoing threefold lineage, the profound cycles of ati, anu, and so forth were transmitted in the holy country [14a] to a few fortunate individuals, imparted to each as a private teaching without being promulgated further. The rulers, patrons, and teachers involved respected the seal of secrecy entailed and concealed these teachings at Vajrasana and other places. During the time in which the Buddhist king Trisong Detsen was first causing the teachings of the Victorious One to spread in the land of Tibet, it is explained that there were many stages, but if we summarize the primary ones, they are six in number: 1. The second Buddha, Padmakara, in the perceptions of ordinary indi-viduals to be guided, taught simply the text Pith Instructions: The Garland of Views. On extraordinary people of good fortune he bestowed the matur-ing empowerments and liberating instructions for the three yogas on a pro-found and vast scale, with the oral lineage of these· teachings passing down through uninterrupted lines of siddhas and masters of awareness, such as the traditions of Nyang, Pang, Khon, Nup, Ma, Rongzom, and others. The majority of the cycles of his advice were sealed as hidden treasure teachings (tennas) for the sake of future generations of those to be guided. 2. The great translator Bairotsana taught such individuals as the twen-ty-five learned ones from India; in particular, the master of awareness Srisirp.ha received the profound teachings of the Great Perfection approach on a vast scale and caused these to be promulgated in Tibet as the five stages of the Category of Mind and uninterrupted continuum of the \"heard lineage\" of the Category of Expanse. 3. With the coming of the great scholar Vimalamitra to Tibet, those to whom he gave the cycles of teachings of the Category of Direct Transmission"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"38 THE CAT-ALOG in the Great Perfection approach passed on lineages of continuous teachings as well as those of hidden treasure teachings. 4. The great master Sangye Yeshe of the Nup clan received limitless advice-such as that of the great reading transmission of the Discourse of the Gathering, the cycles of Yamantaka, and so forth-from four masters of India, Nepal, and Gilgit; the oral lineage of the Discourse of the Gathering survives to the present day. 5. Namkhai Nyingpo of the Nup clan received the cycle of teachings of the glorious deity Samyak from the master Hurhkara and promulgated this, and as well ensured that the teachings of the Vajrayana approach fell, as is said, \"first to Nyak, following that to Nup, and finally to Zur,\" such that their lineages of teachings and students became limitless. In particular, during the time of the \"three ancestors of Zur,\" the way in which the teachings of the secret mantra approach spread in Tibet [14b] was said to rival that of OQ.Q.iyana. 6. In future generations, fortunate beings who were emanations of the king and his subjects appeared in succession, bringing forth the profound teachings concealed as hidden treasure from their places of concealment, in accord with the times, so that all beings throughout central Tibet and the surrounding regions were granted unsurpassable benefit and happiness in the short and the long term. B. KADAM In the case of the Kadampa tradition, the Noble Lord, the glorious Atisa (who was renowned as being an emanation of the buddha Amitabha and having attained the third level of realization) came to Tibet. There he found that, due to the evil ruler Langdarma's attempts to eradicate the teachings that had been established by the ancestral spiritual monarchs, the sutra tradition and the Vinaya had been undermined, while the secret mantra approach had become distorted into perverted forms of behavior. In order to ensure that the teachings of the Sage were once again eluci-dated, Atisa composed his Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment, a complete overview of the stages on the paths of the three spiritual models that is based on the meaning of what is taught in such sources as the Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras and the Stages of the Bodhisattva. He emphasized the view of the Middle Way, the conduct of the Vinaya, and the advice con-cerning the precious awakening attitude of bodhicitta. At!Sa established a system of teaching that allowed a single individual to experience all the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 39 words of the Victorious One arising as personal advice for awakening to buddhahood. The foremost among Atisa's students were Khu, Ngok, and Drom,s2 who were emanations of the bodhisattvas of the three families. 53 Of these, Dromton Gyalwai Jungne (who was Avalokitesvara in the flesh) had three students who were known as the three brothers. From these three there de-veloped three traditions: • Putowa Rinchen Sal established the branch of the Kadampa of \"those teaching mainstream sources,\" that is, those such as Lang and Shar54 (who were compared to the united sun and moon), who upheld the tradition of teaching six major sources. • Chenga Tsultrim Bar established the branch of \"those teaching ad-vice,\" transmitted by such masters as Jayulwa, who taught the four truths as personal advice. • Puchungwa Zhonu Gyaltsen established the branch of \"those teach-ing pith instructions,\" transmitted by such masters as Tapkawa, who conferred the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions for the \"sixteen spheres,\" as well as the supportive transmission of the precious volumes of secret teachings. These three branches, as well as the lineage of oral transmission from Naktso, developed extensively, spreading throughout the eastern and cen-tral regions of Tibet. In later times the centers that upheld this tradition itself waned somewhat, [15a] but the illuminating activities of the glorious Tsongkhapa Lozang Drakpa, an emanation of Mafi.jusri:, in elucidating these teachings once again caused them to spread over the surface of the earth. C. LAMDRE As for the tradition of \"The Path with the Result,\" Vajra Nairatmya conferred empowerment on the powerful lord of yogins Sridharmapala (\"Glorious Protector of the Dharma\")55 within a mandala that she emanated. The re-alization of the sixth level became fully evident to him, and he became renowned as the mahasiddha Virilpa, or Birwapa.56 It was he who, relying on the tantra of Hevajra, bestowed the Vajra Lines of the Lamdre teachings for the sake of KaJ:.lha of the East, on whom he conferred an abridged ex-planation of the tantra, as well as extensive instructions on the Path with the Result. To Qombipa he granted an extensive explanation of the tantra"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"40 THE CATALOG and abridged instructions. From these two the transmissions were passed down through lineages of successive masters of accomplishment. Among the translators in Tibet during the later spread of the teachings were three who served as authentic sources of the secret mantra approach, or Vajrayana: Mar, Gi:i, and Drok. One of these, Drokmi Lotsawa Sakya Yeshe, received a complete range of mainstream sources and advice from Gayadhara and Viravajra. He also received the \"eight later cycles concerning the path,\" such as the instructions of the mahasiddha Saroruha. In Tibet he conferred these teachings on his students: the seven siddhas, the seven students who re-ceived a complete transmission of the primary sources, and the four students who received a complete transmission of the pith instructions. 57 From these four there develo.ped in the Lamdre tradition three lineages of the sons who were students. Among these, from Sekar Chungwa58 there further developed three lines through those who received from him an ideal, a middling, and a lesser transmission. The middling transmission was prop-agated through the Zhamas,59 from whom some seven traditions developed. The ideal transmission came through Zhangti:in Chi:ibar, from whom Sachen Kunga Nyingpo received it. There were the traditions of the earlier spiritual son Pakmo Drupa and Chegom, and both extensive and more direct lineages came to the later sons.60 As well, Gyijo Lotsawa studied with Gayadhara, which led to a lineage succession. There came to be what were renowned collectively as the eighteen traditions of Lamdre. From these, the Sakya tra-dition itself has endured as the most widespread in terms of activity. [15b] With respect to that tradition, moreover, Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo stud-ied with the mahasiddha Buddhasri, which led to the lineage succession of the Ngor tradition: the \"explication for the assembly.\"61 The Dzong tradition of Lamdre is that of Dorje Denpa Kunga Namgyal and is the lineage that came from Ngakchang Zungkyi Palwa. And Tsarchen Losal Gyatso studied with Doring Kunpangpa Chenpo and passed this transmission on to his two heart sons, 62 who were compared to the sun and moon, which led to the lineage of the Tsar tradition: the \"explication for disciples.\"63 All of these are still living traditions. Generally speaking, the great guru Drokmi Lotsawa received personal transmissions of the exceptional instructions renowned as the \"nine cycles of the path.\" The first of these, the cycle of the Path with the Result, com-piled by the lord of yogins Birwapa, has just been discussed. As for the \"eight later cycles concerning the path,\" six are concerned with the stage of completion associated with the three cycles of Cakrasmp.vara, Hevajra, and Guhyasamaja, while two are commentaries on the tantra classes in general."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 41 They are: 1. Ensuring the Innate State, a text on the stage of completion according to the \"commentarial tradition\" of Hevajra, authored by Qombi Heruka on the basis of the Two Sections; 2. Saromha's Sadhana, based on the tantra Vajra Pavilion, for which the instructions are those referred to as \"like the tip of a candle flame\" and those on the nine profound methods of the stage of completion, authored by the master Padmavajra and known as the Hevajra tradition of Saroruha, the Lake-Born One; 3. The six mainstream sources of I<r~IJ.a, authored by Kr~IJ.adiryavajra on the basis of the explanatory tantra of Cakrasarp.vara, of which the practical application of the Olapati is \"the complete path of cal).c;lali\"; 4.

Treatises authored by the great scholar Vagisvarakirti, such as Illumi-nating the Seven Branches, which emphasizes the enlightened intent of the glorious Guhyasamaja cycle, [16a] the practice of which is the Mahamudra without Letters, connected with the tradition of the venerable Jiiana; 7. The pith instructions on the \"stages of the inconceivable,\" authored by the mahasiddha Kuddala, based on the Well-Sealed Locket; and 8.

These and other instructions and reading transmissions have en-dured without interruption."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"42 THE CATALOG D. MARPA KAGYU With respect to the oral lineage of the lord Marpa, the great and glorious Tilopa established an extensive lineage in receiving individual transmissions from the mahasiddhas Arya Nagarjuna, Qombipa, Uiipada, and Sukhasiddhi; these became the pith instructions associated with his four personal trans-missions. He practiced for a long time, training in the realizations associated with the spiritual path, until he became a great and powerful master among siddhas, actually cared for by Vajradhara and Vajrayogini, who conferred on him the treasury of the four classes of tantra. After the great scholar Naropa had trained with him, engaging in twelve great hardships, Naropa gained attainment, mastering the meaning of the teachings in its entirety simply through symbols and words. Marpa Chokyi Lodro journeyed to the holy country of India three or four times, studying a limitless range of sutras and tantras with many learned aNd accomplished masters, Naropa and Maitripa foremost among them. In particular, during his earlier and later journeys, he spent a total of sixteen years and seven months with Naropa alone, integrating study, contempla-tion, and meditation so that he came to dwell in a state of attainment. On the occasion of Marpa's final journey, Naropa had already entered into a phase of advanced tantric conduct, so Marpa sought him out by undergoing great hardship and supplicating him. He actually met Naropa at Pu~pahari in northern India and spent seven months with him while Naropa conferred on Marpa the complete transmission of the or~ lineage of the masculine and feminine aspects of Cakrasarp.vara. [16b] In Tibet, the foremost among the students on whom Marpa bestowed profound teachings were known as the four great pillars. From among these, three-Me, Ngok, and Tsur-received the personal transmission of the lineage of exegesis, while the venerable Milarepa received that of the lineage of accomplishment. Among the many students of Mila, including the \"seven who ascended to Khecara\" and the \"eight cotton-clad brethren,\" one of the foremost was his heart son Rechung Dorje Drakpa, who was compared to the moon and from whom came the Oral Lineage of Rechung (Rechung Nyengyu); several of its instructions, such as those concerning Amitayus and Car:H;la, spread throughout the entire Land of Snows. The student who was compared to the sun and who was praised in the proph-ecies of the Victorious One was the great, incomparable Gampopa, whose coming was in every way similar to that of <tn actual buddha coming into the world."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 43 Although he had an inconceivable number of students whom he brought to spiritual maturity and liberation, the foremost were those who upheld the lineages renowned as the four senior branches: • Barompa Darma Wangchuk, from whom came the Barom Kagyu; • Pakmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo, from whom came the Pakdru Kagyu; • the glorious Dusum Khyenpa, from whom came the Karma Kagyu; and • Zhang Tsalpa Tsi:indru Drakpa (a student of Gampopa's student On-gam Tsultrim Nyingpo), from whom came the Tsalpa Kagyu. • As well, a fifth branch, the Dakpo Kagyu, came from the succession that followed the three \"uncle and nephew\" masters of Dakpo, which was the primary seat of Dakpo. Some 500 students of Pakmo Drupa were famed as being worthy of a cer-emonial canopy. From the foremost among them came what were renowned as the eight junior branches of Kagyu, or \"the four pairs, totaling eight.\" These students were: • Kyoppa Jikten Sumgyi Gi:inpo, from whom came the Drigung Kagyu; • Tangpa Tashi Palwa, from whom came the Taklung Kagyu; • Drogi:in Gyaltsa Kui:in, from whom came the Tropu Kagyu; • Lingje Repa Perna Dorje, from whom came the Lingre Kagyu; • Marpa Rinchen Lodri:i, from whom came the Martsang Kagyu; • Yelpa Yeshe Tsekpa, from whom came the Yelpa Kagyu; • Zarawa Yeshe Senge, from whom came the Yapzang Kagyu; and • Nyipu Gyergom Chi:ikyi Senge, from whom came the Shuksep Kagyu. [17a] Each of these had its own monastic seat, lineage of teachings, and vast range of activities. In particular, from Gi:itsangpa Gi:inpo Dorje (who was the foremost stu-dent of Lingje Repa's heart son Dragon Tsangpa Gyare) came the upper branch of the Drukpa, renowned as the \"stars in the sky\"; from the lin-eage of his students such as Gyalwa Yangi:inpa, Lati:i Sherap Gi:inpo, Barawa Gyaltsen Zangpo, and others came specific subbranches of the Kagyu. From Lore Darma Wangchuk came the lower branch of the Drukpa: the \"focal point of earth.\" And through the nine masters named Senge, who upheld the monastic seat, came the uninterrupted transmission of the middle branch of the Drukpa."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"44 THECATALOG On the basis of the special nature of the lord Dusurn Khyenpa's motivation and aspirations; the incredible students and activities of each of his succes-sive incarnations constituted the Ka.J.11tsang tradition, the primary branch of the Kagyu. Two further branches developed: the Zurrnang Kagyu carne from Drung Mase Lodro Rinchen, who was invested as the master of the fifth lord Dezhin Shekpa's oral lineage known as the \"Three Cycles of the Gem,\" while the Nedo Kagyu carne from the learned and accomplished Karma Chakrne, who was a personal student of the sixth Garwang, Chokyi Wangchuk. From among the foregoing, nowadays only the Karma Kagyu (as one of the four senior branches) and the Drukpa, the Drigung, and the Taklung (of the eight junior branches) are still lineages that can stand on their own. Of the remaining branches, only the transmissions of a few minor maturing ernpowerrnents and liberating teachings have not disappeared; other than these, the presence of these branches is no longer felt to any great degree. E. SHANGPA KAGYU Concerning the Shangpa Kagyu, the learned and accomplished master Khyungpo Naljor (who was prophesied by the Victorious One as a \"great sravaka worker of miracles\") first embraced his ancestral religion of Bon and then the Nyingrna school. Although he became learned in each of these systems and gained some spiritual power thereby, due to the power of his aspiration to engage in enlightened conduct finding a timely expression, he was not satisfied with them alone and so journeyed to the holy country of India. He met with some 150 learned and accomplished masters, foremost among them his four primary gurus (Vajrasana and others), and studied an enormous range of teachings from both sutra and tantra. [17b] In particular, he actually met the Q.akinis of timeless awareness Nigurna and Sukhasiddhi, who had both heard teachings directly from Vajradhara and who dwelled on one of the three pure levels of realization. They bestowed profound instruc-tions on him, and he became a great lord among siddhas, indistinguishable from such sublime rnahasiddhas as Saraha, as exemplified by the fact that the deities of the five tantras were actually present in the five places of his body. Because he established his seat at Zhang Zhong in the Shang valley of the Yeru region of Tsang province, he was known as Lama Shangpa, and so those who continued his lineage became famed as the Shangpa Kagyu. Khyungpo Naljor lived to the age of 150, maturing and liberating an inconceivable number of those who were to be ·guided, so that his stu-dents included some 180,000 teachers. Foremost among these were the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 45 five \"earlier sons\" and a sixth \"later son.\" And among these, it was only to Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsondru that the personal transmission fell for the one-to-one lineage of the secret words of Vajradhara. After him this lineage passed in succession to Onton Kyergangpa, Sangye Nyenton, Sangye Tonpa, and Drogon Tonpa. The vajra seal of this one-to-one transmission was then loosened by the seventh \"jewel,\" Choje Tonpa, in accord with prophecies from Vajradhara and the <;Iakini of timeless awareness, thus allowing accom-plished students to spread throughout the human world Jambudvipa and as far away as its subcontinents. The primary holders of the continuing lineage were Tsangma Shangton, Samdingpa Zhonu Drup, and Jakchen Gyaltsen Bum, all three of whom committed the instructions to writing. Countless lineages of students developed at the seats of both J akchen and Samdingpa. There also appeared another series of great and exceptional beings known as the later seven jewels, such as Khyungpo Tsultrim Gonpo, who was a student of Tsangma Shangton. In addition, countless other lineages developed: from Choje Tonpa's stu-dent Serlingpa Tashi Pal, from the succession of Lato Konchok Kar's stu-dents, and so forth. Later on, the mahasiddha Tangtong Gyalpo received the distinct \"upper\" and \"lower\" lineages and practiced these teachings, so that he was actually taken under the care of the <;Iakini of timeless aware-ness, [18a] which resulted in three successive direct lineages that still exist nowadays. The venerable Jetsun Kunga Drolchok received the extensive lin-eage of these teachings on some twenty-four occasions, and a twenty-fifth time-a marvelous and extremely direct lineage-when the <;Iakini actually bestowed instructions on him in this direct manner. Jetsun Taranatha com-bined these twenty-five transmissions in the instruction manual found in this collection. As for the cycle of teachings concerned with the \"swift-acting lord pro-tector of timeless awareness,\" the special dharmapala of the learned and accomplished Khyungpo, in former times the followers of the so-called upper tradition spread these teachings almost everywhere. Later on, the lower tradition that came from Rigong spread throughout the majority of schools, and in particular the Precious Lord and his spiritual sons adopted this as the foremost of their dharmapala practices, so that the rituals of offering, praise, sadhana, and activity spread throughout the three region of U, Tsang, and Kham and as far away as China and Mongolia, It would seem that nowadays any tradition that upholds the sources of the \"golden teachings\" is exceedingly rare."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"46 THE CATALOG F. ZHIJE AND ITs AuxiLIARY LINEAGE Kamalaslla (who was also renowned in both Tibet and China as Padampa Sangye) was a greatly learned master who was born at Cata Senga in the region of Vetali in India. He received the entire range of profound instruc-tions from some fifty-four accomplished masters, both men and women, and one-pointedly applied himself to the practice of these instructions. In this way he gained the eight major attainments of the more ordinary variety-such as the ability to extract the vital essence of the inanimate world-and so lived for 570 years. In meditation he was graced with visions of twelve sugatas, thirty-six amazing gurus who had attained Khecara, and others; he also gained the supreme attainment: the timeless awareness of the great path of seeing. It was this master who based his teachings primarily on the three ver-sions of the Prajfiaparamita-extensive, middle-length, and concise-as well as such texts as the tantra Great Flowing River of the Sanskrit Vowels and Consonants, condensing the meaning of these sources for application in spir-itual practice. In accord with this master's own life example, for him the support was that of the three levels of ordination; the path was the challeng-ing one of austerities; and the fruition was conduct for the benefit of others. Those of fortunate karma who followed that example and were liberated on the level of buddhahood were as numerous as stars in the nighttime sky. The specific teachings that brought this about became known by the generic name' of \"the sacred teachings,\" as well as \"the pacification of suffering.\" [18b] Although these teachings comprise an inconceivable range of instruc-tional methods based on people's varying degrees of acumen, the lineages that are most renowned are the three successive lines of the transmission of Pacification established by Padampa during some five visits to the land of Tibet: 1. The first line of transmission concerns the \"Three Cycles of the Lamp of Pacification\" that Padampa imparted to Jfianaguhya of Kashmir and were transmitted by the translator Angpo Lotsawa and others. 2. In the intermediate line of transmission, the primary masters are Ma, So, and Karp. The transmission of the words and meaning of Mahamudra were imparted to Ma Chokyi Sherap; the transmission of the words and meaning of the advice for \"perceiving pure awareness in all its nakedness\" were imparted to Sochung Gendun Bar; and the transmission of upper lin-"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 47 eage and lower lineage of the transcendent perfection of wisdom was im-parted to Ka111 Yeshe Gyaltsen. There were also three minor transmissions: • the \"Ninefold Cycle of the Lamp of Pacification,\" imparted to Geshe Drapa; • the advice integrating sutra and tantra, imparted to Che Candrakirti; and • the advice \"without letters\" on the transcendent perfection of wisdom, imparted to Jang Kadampa. It is also said that there were some fifteen minor transmissions of diverse lineages for such teachings as Lapkyi Dronma's advice on the Object of Severance. 3. As for the final line of transmission, when Padampa returned from China to Dingri, there were transmissions beyond counting, of maturing empowerments and liberating instructions that he bestowed on his students: the twenty-six \"destroyers of illusion,\" his more than one hundred great and exalted spiritual sons, the twenty-four noble ladies, the twelve students who directed monastic seats, and others. However, the foremost of these students were known as the four favored yogins, who compiled teachings and wrote them down: • in the east, Dampa Charchen, who compiled the \"Cycle of the Teach-ings That Integrate the Sutras\"; • in the south, Vajrakrodha, who compiled the \"Cycle Organizing the Meaning of the Precious Jewel\"; • in the west, Dampa Purchung, who compiled the \"Cycle That Com-piles Fragmentary Teachings\"; and • in the north, the bodhisattva Kunga, who compiled the \"Cycle of the Teachings of Cholu.\" Of the foregoing three lineages, the intermediate one is explained as be-ing in accord with the final cycle of the Buddha's teachings (that is, the sutras that concern the definitive meaning of the teachings), while the later lineage is primarily in accord with the tantric approach. All of the foregoing lineages, moreover, are complete spiritual paths, but Padampa averred that the most exalted among them-equal in its intent to that of Padampa himself-is the tradition of the holy master Kunga."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"48 THE CATALOG This cycle of teachings is composed of a vast range of sections, of both more ordinary and extraordinary teachings. [19a] Although all three lineag-es were formerly very widespread, nowadays they exist only in name. But the great translator Dharrnasrl of Mindroling put much effort into receiving whatever transmissions were available and writing manuals and ritual texts. It would seem that it is due to his kindness that at least the fundamental elements of the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions for all three lineages (the earlier, the intermediate, and the later), and particularly for the tradition of the holy master Kunga, are still extant. The auxiliary cycle, the Object of Severance, is renowned for having two branches: the \"male\" lineage of Severance and the \"female\" lineage. As for the former, Padampa Sangye bestowed on Kyo Sakya Yeshe and Yalung Mara Serpo the exclusively sutra tradition of Severance: the instructions called Six Fragments, which discuss the meaning of Aryadeva's short text Fifty Verses.64 Kyo conferred these on his nephew, Sonam Lama, who in turn is said to have conferred four of these Fragments on Machik Lapkyi Dronma. The cycle transmitted by Mara Serpo was promulgated by Rok Sherap b and Khedrup Zhonu Drup. The foregoing is known as the male lineage of Severance. As for the female lineage, the same Machik Lapkyi Dronma-who was the great mother Prajfiaparamita manifesting as a human woman-read the sutra of the transcendent perfection of wisdom aloud, which aroused in her the view of emptiness. With Padampa teaching her a few words of heart advice, she experienced an ongoing sense of freedom and became a natu-ral yogin!. Out of her own experience of enlightened intent-the meaning of the intent found in the Prajfiaparamita Sutras-Machik established the extensive tradition of the path of Severance, composing an incredible num-ber of cycles of advice. All of these are subsumed within four lineages: the father lineage of skillful method, the mother lineage of wisdom, the nondual lineage of ultimate meaning, and the Q.akini's lineage of meditative expe-rience. Her many students, including some 108 male and female siddhas who were her personal students, lived throughout central and eastern Tibet. Foremost among them were her sixteen great spiritual children to whom personal transmission fell, whose activities flourished everywhere. Her own son Langlungpa Gyalwa Dondrup became the foremost one upholding the lineage of the sutra tradition. The upholder of the lineage of the tantra tra-dition was Tonyon Samdrup, who became renowned as a siddha and whose special lineage of Severance was known as Gangpa.65 [19b] The one up-holding the lineage that integrated the traditions of sutra and tantra was"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 49 Khugom Chi:ikyi Senge, whose lineage produced many further lineages that came from individual siddhas. In particular, the Gyalwarig Karmapa Rangjung Dorje received the teachings of Severance from Namtso Dopa, and from that lineage came the Severance lineages of \"Rupa.\" In later times there developed the tradi-tions of Zurmang and Nedo. There also developed countless other traditions from various lineage holders, as exemplified by the Kyapche tradition that came from Jetsun Kyase and the Trechi:i tradition that came from Treho Chi:ikyi Wangpo. An extensive lineage came from Machik's daughters, while Gyaltang Samten Ozer received many distinct transmissions and met direct-ly with Machik, who bestowed instructions on him; all of this led to the Tang tradition. 66 Therewere many profound teachings that Machik did not confer on her students but concealed as hidden treasure teachings. In later times these were revealed by Ladu Dorje Dri:inma, who was an emanation of Machik herself. Kunpang Tsi:indru Senge, a rebirth of Khugom, revealed a profound and vast array of hidden treasure teachings from concealment; it would seem that the later transmission of these has continued to the present day as the Gyati:in lineage of Severance. G. }ORDRUK The Vajrayoga of the Six Br~J1Ches of Union dates from the time when our Teacher, the perfect Buddha, was teaching a vast range of anuttarayoga source tantras of the Vajrayana at the glorious stupa of Dhanyakataka to those in his retinue, a vast assembly of beings both of this world and tran-scendent. On that occasion, in response to a supplication by Dharmaraja Sucandra, who was an emanation,67 the Buddha spoke the source tantra of the Kalacakra cycle in twelve thousand lines. This teaching flourished in the land of Shambhala until the end of the seventh Dharmaraja's reign. Then the Kalki ruler Mafijusri Yasas composed an abridged version of the tantra based on the source, and Kalki Pur.u;larika elucidated this version in his major commentary. The successive generations of emanated Kalki rul-ers spread these teachings, so that they definitely came to mahasiddhas in the holy country of India at a certain early point in time, if in a somewhat random manner. In the perceptions of people in general, however, the one who first intro-duced these teachings was Cilu Pai,lc;lita. When he was traveling to Shambhala seeking the \"Bodhisattva Commentaries,\"68 [20a] during his journey he was"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"50 THE CATALOG taken under the care of an emanation of the Kalki ruler, who bestowed on him the entire range of empowerments, tantras, commentaries, and pith in-structions and blessed him so that Cilu thoroughly mastered these teachings. Cilu's student was Pi!)QO Acarya, also known as the master who begs for alms. It was from him that Maiijuvajra (also known as Kalacakrapada the Elder, or Cilupa the Younger) received the teachings. Through the power of ) the emanated Kalki ruler's blessings, Maiijusrivajra gained siddhis and actu-ally journeyed to Kalapa, where he received a complete transmission of the empowerments, tantras, and pith instructions. Emphasizing these teachings, he explained them to those who listened, so that he came to have many students, including Naropa, Ratnakaragupta, and others. Among these, three figures-Avadhi.itipa, Sribhadrabodhi, and Nalandapa-were each referred to as Kalacakrapada the Younger. Initially, the translator Gyijo Lotsawa Dawai Ozer invited Kalacakrapada Sribhadrabodhi to this land of Tibet; they translated the commentary on the tantra and the pith instructions. Gyijo trained those known as the four great sons, including the translator Trom Lotsawa Perna Ozer. The Gyilo tradition was transmitted from Trom Lotsawa. Maiijukirti was a student of Nalandapa, and his student in turn was the Nepalese Samantasri. It was from Samantasri that Ra Lotsawa Chorap re-ceived the teachings that became the Ra tradition. Alternatively, another student of Nalandapa was the Kashmiri Dawa Gonpo, from whom the teach-ings passed to Dro Lotsawa Sherap Drak, to his student Gompa Konchok Sung in turn, and so forth, resulting in the Dro tradition. Other traditions included the following: • the Tsami tradition, the lineage that passed from Nalandapa to Tsami Sangye Drak and successive generations; • the Nyo tradition, through Nyo Darma 6, who received teachings from Tsami's student Se Lotsawa Zhonu Tsultrim; • the Chak Lo tradition, another lineage that came from Nalandapa and passed successively to Abhayakara, Ni~kalaii.ka, the Nepalese scholar Ravindra, and Chak Lotsawa Choje Pal; • the Pa!)chen (\"Great Scholar\") tradition, also called the Chal tradition, which came from Abhayakara to Vikhyatadeva, the Kashmiri scholar Pal)chen Sakyasri, and Chal Chokyi Zangpo; • the Rong tradition, which passed from Ra Lotsawa Chorap to Yeshe Senge, to Bumseng, to Rongpa Ga Lotsawa Namgyal Dorje, and so on through successive generations of the lineage;"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 51 • the Tsal tradition, which was passed from Tsami to Khampa Ga Lotsawa Zhonupal to Zhang Tsalpa; • the Sakyapa tradition, conferred by Ga Lotsawa on the great master of Sakya; [20b] • the Kodrak tradition, which was received by Kodrak Sonam Gyaltsen from the great scholar Vibhi.iticandra, on whom it had been actually conferred by the mahasiddha Savarisvara; • the Go tradition, which Lama Go received from both Nyen Lotsawa and Ga Lotsawa, they in turn having received the teachings from Mafi.-jukirti and Abhayakara; and • the Kar tradition, which came from Chak Choje Pal to Golungpa Dode-pal, to the learned and accomplished master Orgyenpa, to Nyemdowa Kunga Dondrup, to the lord Rangjung and so on, and which emphasiz-es the Tsami tradition. In addition, there appeared many other traditions, such as the Bodong tradition (passed down from Shong and Pang), the Koktrangwa tradition, the Lato Wangyal tradition, and others. In later times, however, the two schools that caused the teachings of the Kalacakra cycle to spread very widely in this Land of Snows were the Jonang and the Zhalu. Both of these received teachings initially from the lineage of the Ra tradition and subsequently brought in teachings from the Dro tradition, so that they definitely came to uphold a combined lineage of Ra and Dro. Because the Bu tradition was primarily a personal transmission of exegesis, it has continued from the great Buton to the present day and constitutes an uninterrupted transmission of explanation of the tantra. In the Jonang tradition, the great Kunpang received from successive ema-nations of the Kalki rulers the complete tradition of Kalacakra that included all the sources translated into Tibetan. His students were famed as the \"four sons of Kunpang.\" The great and omniscient Dolpopa's marvelous activity in spreading the yoga of the Six Branches was truly incredible. Primarily, it was the fourteen students who were considered his equals who each en-gaged in extensive activities to spread traditions of instruction, which has resulted in an ongoing succession that constitutes a personal transmission of accomplishment. This continues even now without impairment as an ongo-ing tradition of consummate meditative experience and realization. Generally speaking, in India, the holy country, it would seem that a number of traditions appeared, including those of Kalacakrapada the Elder and the Younger, Savaripa, Anupamarak~ita, RaviSrijfi.ana, the great schol-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"S2 THE CATALOG ar Naropa, the Great Scholar of Kashmir, the mahasiddha Santigupta, and others. Here in Tibet the most renowned were the \"four prior traditions\" (of Gyijo, Dro, Ra, and Chi:idrak of Dingri); the \"four intermediate traditions\" (of Menlung Guru, Tar Lotsawa, Orgyenpa, and Vibhuticandra); [21a] the three from Savari (earlier, intermediate, and later); and the \"later tradition\" that came from the great scholar Vanaratna. H. 00RJE 5UMGYI NYENDRUP As for the tradition of Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup (Stages of Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras), the learned and accomplished mas-ter Orgyenpa Rinchen Pal trained completely in the sutras and tantras; in particular he became a superb scholar of the Kalacakra cycle. Training un-der Gyalwa Gi:itsangpa, he gave rise to a consummate level of realization, beholding the truth of the path of seeing. The lord of dharma Gi:itsangpa extolled Orgyenpa as his heart son, equal to him in uncontrived tantric con-duct. In order to develop his conduct to a consummate degree, Orgyenpa journeyed to Jalendhara and many other regions. In particular, he went to the land of Oqqiyana in the west, where many obstacles and quasi-mirac-ulous events occurred; he quelled these with his indwelling confidence on the view and the splendor of his uncontrived conduct. In the four cardinal directions of the central region of Dhumatala, he was blessed by the qakinis of the four families. In accord with a prophecy uttered by a lovely emanated maiden, he went to a town called Kapoka, where Vajrayogini herself mani-fested in the form of a prostitute and bestowed on him the pleasures of food and drink and physical contact, which released the blockages in his subtle channels. With sounds and earthquakes and other great omens, she mani-fested in actuality as the Vajra Queen and conferred tl1ese instructions on him in their entirety. The four previous qakinis and a fifth, the lioness-faced Sirhhamukha, each conferred a portion of the instructions on Orgyenpa as well, and he gained the sublime and more ordinary attainments. Orgyenpa journeyed to Tibet, where, in response to a supplication by Kharchu Rinpoche, a student who had received a prophecy concerning this, he first committed the vajra verses of this cycle to writing. He composed a Mnemonic Summary of verses concerning the visualizations that he had be-stowed. Dawa Senge, who was entrusted with safeguarding these teachings, compiled the pith instructions into a volume. There are also what are re-ferred to as the four major commentaries: The replies that Orgyenpa gave to questions from Golungpa Zhi:inu Pal were recorded; Zurpukpa Rinchen Pal"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"TRADITIONS IN INDIA AND TIBET 53 authored a major commentary; and both the learned Shangton and Nyedo Kunga Dondrup composed detailed explanations of the vajra verses.

[2lb] The venerable and omni-scient Rangjung received the entire cycle of instructions from the mahasid-dha himself, composed a commentary to unravel the vajra verses, and fur-ther elucidated this noble path, the key points of which are more especially exalted than others."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"III IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS In terms of what the teachings in this collection constitute in their essence, eight topics are to be identified: • the Nyingma, or Early Translation school • the Kadam • the Lamdre • the Kagyu • the Shangpa • the Zhije and Cho • the Jordruk • the Nyendrup A. NYINGMA In the first case, that of the Early Translation school and its classification of nine approaches, with respect to the three yo gas of the inner level of skillful method, there have developed many graduated approaches to meditation. These, however, can be subsumed within the two categories of those that involve some thematic structure and those that do not. As the Three Stages states: The stage of meditating on a thematic structure and that of cultivating the experience of suchness itself-the specific variations are spoken of as twofold. Of these, in this collection the emphasis is on presenting the sources for the stages of meditation in atiyoga, the pinnacle of the nine approaches."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"56 THE CATALOG This is the latter of the three categories of development, completion, and Great Perfection. If we interpret the Sanskrit term mahdsandhi, it translates as \"great meditative absorption\" or \"great meditative stability\"; that is, the meaning is that of timeless awareness, in which all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are naturally arising within the expanse of the oneness that is the true way in which things abide, transcending all the systems of the eight approaches of ordinary consciousness. If this approach is further categorized, we read the following in the Supreme Array: the Category of Mind for those with conceptual minds, the Category of Expanse for those with minds like space, and the Category of Direct Transmission for those who need not strive step by step. Accordingly, the Great Perfection is renowned to involve three categories, because there are different degrees of profundity within this approach that forges the path of naturally occurring timeless awareness. Of these, in the outer Category of Mind, the realization of all phenomena as being the display of the oneness of mind itself-beyond causes and condi-tions, effort and achievement-brings freedom from the limitation of there being factors to be eliminated. There are seven further subcategories within this, such as the position that the fruition state is the origin of mind. In the inner Category of Expanse, free of anything to be done, the re-alization that all objects in the phenomenal world are without coming or going within the expanse of Samantabhadra-and that they therefore do not undergo change within the basic space of the three kayas as natural attri-butes-brings freedom from the limitation of there being antidotes. [22a] This has four subsections: the three of the White Expanse, Black Expanse, and Multicolored Expanse, plus the Immense Expanse. In the secret and profound Category of Direct Transmission, there is the realization that the way in which all phenomena of ground, path, and frui-tion actually are is such that their innate attribute is the fact of the insepa-rability of original purity and spontaneous presence; and in accord with this realization, there is freedom from the limitations of factors to be eliminated as well as antidotes. This category includes three kinds of texts: personal ad-vice, miscellaneous instructions, and teachings that discuss the tantras that are the source specific to this category. In this regard, the All-Creating Monarch contains the following lines:"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 57 Six approaches that bring the attainment of certainty are shown to be points of error concerning the great perfection. Such passages demonstrate the fact that, in every case, all the fixed concepts pertaining to the sutras and to the outer and inner tantras (up to and in-cluding the anuyoga approach) are solely systems of thought constrained by ordinary rational consciousness, so that one succumbs to the error of failing to see the primordial way in which things actually abide, just as it is. Timeless awareness in the context of the Great Perfection approach tran-scends the eight avenues of ordinary discursive consciousness, which entail imagining and describing things in terms of cause and effect. It is a supreme freedom from conceptual elaboration, with all limitless states of ordinary mind and mental events having subsided within basic space. It is the fundamentally unconditioned mode of being that is the true nature of pure awareness, occur-ring in and of itself, supremely free of anything to be done and transcending ordinary consciousness. Other than constituting a naturally abiding process of resting in its own fundamental nature, it is not contrived through any artifi-cial means, and so the adventitious distortions that are manifestations of its dynamic energy have dissipated naturally within the basic space of genuine being. It is therefore remarkably superior to all lower systems of thought, a fact that is discussed in the tantra Naturally Arising Awareness: How marvelous! The great perfection of ati does not fall into any extreme and so embraces the ultimate meaning of naturally occurring timeless awareness. To give an analogy, just as the carnivorous lion awes other predators with its majesty, so the Great Perfection speaks its own language and awes inferior approaches with its majesty. The Great Perfection speaks its own language and relies on its own ultimate meaning.69 In this and similar passages, this source presents the definitive secrets of unique view and meditation. In the Supreme Array of Ati, moreover, following an extensive presenta-tion of the way in which this approach is superior to systems of view and meditation that involve conceptual speculation, we read the following:"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"ss THE CATALOG Therefore, this quintessence that is the definitive secret is like a lamp that illuminates the darkness; it is like an elephant among oxen; it is like a lion among other wild beasts; [22b] it is like a horseman among foot soldiers. It is superior to all other approaches. The preceding citation is an illustration of the extensive treatment found in this text. As for the key points of this path; the Great Perfection approach is en-dowed with the special teachings of the unsurpassable instructions concern-ing \"fourfold freedom.\" And in particular, having received the empower-ment into the dynamic energy of pure awareness from the secret cycle of the Category of Direct Transmission, with unimpaired faith and samaya one familiarizes oneself to some significant degree with the yoga of day and night. Even if one does so, one still might not gain the level of primordial freedom in this lifetime. Nevertheless, through the power of the blessings of the lineage of masters of awareness and that of the true nature of things, when one becomes free of the cage of the physical body, immediately upon calling nirmai).akaya pure realms to mind, one beholds the nirmaQ.akaya realms of the ten directions and is inspired to the level of \"universal illumi-nation.\" This process is described in such passages as the following from the Supreme Array of Ati: In the final of the five-hundred-year periods in degenerate times, this heart essence of secrets will manifest in the human realm. Those fortunate individuals who follow and uphold this and to whom this heart essence becomes evident will pass to the level of unchanging being. Even if, due to having a short life and many illnesses in these degenerate times, they do not gain indwelling confidence in this heart essence, by perceiving it they gain supreme inspiration, taking pure and miraculous rebirth in the nirmai).akaya realm of Universal Illumination, freed from the confines of the womb."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 59 B. IZADAM As for the Kadampa, this refers to the tradition of the glorious AtiSa-known as the Noble Lord and the \"single deity\" of the Land of Snows-in which all the words of the Victorious One are experienced as personal advice by which a single individual can awaken to buddhahood. There is a saying, \"The bodies of those who uphold this lineage are adorned with four deities, their speech is adorned with the Three Compilations, and their minds are adorned with the three higher trainings.\" Of these, the four deities are Sakyamuni, the master of the teachings; Avalokitesvara, the master of love and compassion; Tara, who dispels external obstacles; and Acala, who dispels internal obstacles. The Three Compilations are the presentations with which the three higher trainings are counted together as the subject matter being presented, so that this tradition is renowned as embodying mastery that is endowed with seven divine components. This tradition has three parts: primary sources, advice, and pith instruc-tions. [23a] As for the primary sources, this tradition emphasizes a living process of listening to and explaining six sources: the Garland of Lives and the Didactic Aphorisms, as the sources that arouse one's faith; the Compendium of Training and Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, as the sources that teach about one's conduct; and the LeveLs of the Bodhisattva and the Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras, as the sources concerning meditative absorption. The advice is instruction on the basis of the four truths-of suffering, of its all-pervasive origin, of its cessation, and of the spiritual path to it-in terms of the usual progression and its reversal. The pith instructions con-cern the practical implementation of secret teachings found in the Precious Volume. As that source states: Please recall the guru, the source of refuge. Your body is of the nature of the deity. Please use your speech to e11gage continuously in recitation and mantra repetition. Think of all beings without exception as your parents. Investigate the way in which mind truly abides as empty. In maintaining these five, please purify all your fundamentally positive qualities!"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"60 THE CATALOG That is to say, the path is forged of the \"sixteen spheres,\" on both the rela-tive and the ultimate levels, derived from the five recollections of the guru, the deity, mantra, compassion, and emptiness. The Lamp on the Path to Enlighterunent by the Noble Lord presents an integrated treatment of the primary sources and the advice. Given that it is indispensable for one to embrace this unerring path right up to the point at which liberation and omniscience are attained, it is famed as the \"path to enlightenment,\" or the \"graduated path of the three spiritual models.\" As the source itself States: Understand there to be three spiritual models: the lesser, the intermediate, and the most excellent. The Sanskrit term for a spiritual model is pu~a, which etymologically means \"having capability,\" and so the term \"spiritual model of the teach-ings\" is used in this context to refer to someone who has the capability to accomplish something meaningful for the next lifetime or even beyond that. In this tradition, at the outset the foundation for all three models lies in the teachings on how one relies on a spiritual mentor and how the opportu-nity and leisure to practice is difficult to gain, and so one begins with these. Then, as the exalted Nagarjuna states: First there are teachings concerned with higher states of rebirth; later come those concerned with the definitive excellence of enlightenment. Why? Because once one has gained a higher state of rebirth, gradually one can come to that definitive excellence. Accordingly, the lesser spiritual model is that of those who rid them-selves of fixation on this lifetime and are capable of making the moral choices of what to accept and what to reject for the sake of some happier state of existence for themselves in the future. As the main body of teach-ings in this path, there are four topics: impermanence, the shortcomings of the lower states of rebirth, [23b] the taking of refuge, and the effects of karma. The intermediate spiritual model is that of those who rid themselves of fixation on samsara in its entirety and are capable of engaging correctly in the three higher trainings for the sake of becoming liberated from it. From the perspective of approaches, this model comprises those of the sravaka"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 61 and the pratyekabuddha. From the perspective of what one meditates on, there are the four truths, interdependent origination, the obvious and subtle aspects of the identity of the individual, and so forth. The superior spiritual model is that of those who perceive the flaws of both conditioned existence and mere personal salvation and are capable of accepting the challenge of bringing all beings to the level of buddhahood. From the perspective of view, this is either the Middle Way or the Mind Only school. From the perspective of spiritual approaches, this model can be divided into the two approaches of sutra and tantra. Beginning with the arousal of bodhicitta, which is the distinctive feature of this path, the teach-ings deal with the way in which one engages in the conduct of the heirs of the victorious ones-that is, the general and specific points of training-as well as the results to which this leads. Generally speaking, the designation \"three spiritual models\" appears in a few sources, such as the Concise Definitive Conclusion and the commentary on the Treasury of Abhidhanna. The stages of practical implementation are con-densed from explanations found in the two Ornaments and the Categories of the Levels.7° In fact, all the teachings that were spoken in so excellent a manner by the Victorious One are subsumed within this path of the three spiritual models. The variant themes of mind training, or lojong, which constitute advice for mentally exchanging oneself with others, are primarily found in the Indian sources by the Lord Atisa's three gurus and are the quintessence of the practical implementation found in such texts as Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva and the Compendiwn of Training. This training is the fundamen-tal theme for meditation on the path of the superior spiritual model-the consummation of the three models of the graduated path-and constitutes a remarkable way to enhance the relative aspect of bodhicitta and the medi-tative absorptions of loving-kindness and compassion. c. LAMDRE In the case of the Lamdre tradition, the powerful lord among yogins Virupa pursued a spiritual practice of the completion stage from the three tantras of the Hevajra cycle71 and condensed this into the source text of pith in-structions,72 which became renowned as the Precious Speech Concerning the Path with the Result, a lineage imbued with four oral transmissions and authentic qualities. This tradition involves four ways of instructing students through three means of validation and four oral lineages."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"62 THE CATALOG Of these, if we discuss instruction exactly according to the source, 73 which is the most extensive basic treatise, [24a] to quote the great lord Sakyapa: The three states of appearances lay the foundation for the path; the three continua bring understanding of all practical implementation without exception. In accord with this statement, the three states of appearances are teachings that are held in common with the approach of the transcendent perfections and lay the foundation of the path: • Impure appearance involves meditating on the shortcomings of sam-sara, on the hard-won state of opportunity and leisure, and on convic-tion concerning the cause-and-effect process of karma; this completes the path of the sravaka approach. • Experiential appearance involves, for the more ordinary kind of practi-tioner, the cultivation of loving-kindness, compassion, and bodhicitta; this completes the path of the ordinary Mahayana approach. For the more extraordinary kind of practitioner, this involves meditation on the path of the Vajrayana approach, in which one understands that all the inconceivable states of meditative and visionary experience that arise are subsumed within fifteen topics, so that when these arise one recognizes them and allows their natural expression. • Pure appearance involves being aware of the qualities of buddhahood in the context of the fruition state-the uninterrupted continuum of adornment and so forth-and the arousal of inspiration that one will oneself attain these qualities, so that one's ongoing experience be-comes refined through tl1eir cultivation in meditation. In the extraordinary path of mantra, at the outset one receives empower-ment as the causal circumstance and upholds the samaya commitments en-tailed in the ground situation.74 As for the actual path of the three continua: • The causal continuum of the basis of all experience involves one being directly introduced to the view of the indivisibility of samsara and nir-vana as the primordial unity of lucidity and emptiness and cultivating that in meditation. • The continuum of skillful method as the path in fact involves four succes-sive paths connected to the four levels of empowerment:"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 63 ,. The path of the vase empowerment is that of the stage of develop-ment on the external and internal levels; having received empow-erment in the context of the path, one meditates for four sessions in every twenty-four-hour period on the profound path that embodies the significance of that empowerment. .. The path of the secret empowerment involves techniques using subtle energies and cal).c;lali:. >-The path of the empowerment of wisdom leading to timeless aware-ness involves the body of another as the \"messenger.\" .. The path of the fourth empowerment is that of the \"vajra waves\"-that is, meditation on the threefold path of the stage of completion to usher in the anticipatory and actual states of timeless awareness. • Once one has meditated on these four paths, within the context of the mundane path, one experiences the four views (of the three essences and so forth). Within the context of the transcendent path, one reaches the four culmination states of attainment, and the resultant continuum of the frnition state of the five kay as becomes fully evident. [24 b] To summarize, one lays the foundation of the path with the three states of appearances; carries out the implementation of the main body of prac-tice with the three continua; eliminates one's false assumptions with four-fold authenticity and the four oral lineages; and delineates the levels of the path by means of the five factors of interdependent origination. When implementing the foregoing, by knowing the three situations in which the subtle elements gather, one becomes skilled in the seven pith instructions that are of benefit and in the methods for dispelling hindrances; and by pursuing the practice, one reaches the culmination of attainment. This is the process of instruction in the extensive treatment of the path. The in-termediate treatment of the path involves five topics, while the condensed treatment of the path is subsumed within four categories. Given that any of the foregoing treatments are such that the fruition remains attainable within the context of the path, this tradition is renowned as Lamdre-the Path with the Result-because it reveals the significance of the insepara-bility of ground, path, and fruition. D. MARPA KAGYU As for the tradition of the Kagyupa, this refers to the veritable ocean of advice (primarily associated with the anuttarayoga class) that has been transmitted"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"64 THE CATALOG by the mahasiddhas who founded the schools based on the oral lineage they upheld, which Lord Marpa the translator had received as the tradition of the venerable Naropa and Maitripa. Although these instructions are so limitless as to defy description, we may summarize them according to the emphasis on the topics of meditation into two categories: the path of skillful method (the Six Dharmas of Naropa) and the path of freedom (Mahamudra). Both of these, however, are subsumed within three major \"vajra themes.\" To cite from the Clear Sununary of the Five Stages and the Later Primer: The stages of the way in which things truly abide, the path, and the arising of the fruition state. That is to say, there is • the ground (the way in which things truly abide); • the stages for traversing the spiritual path; and • the way in which the fruition state is made fully evident. The true way of abiding, furthermore, has two aspects: the way in which things actually abide as the ground of being and the way in which things actually abide as this pertains to mind. Each of these, too, has three levels (the more obvious, the subtle, and the extremely subtle), which are taken as the basis for the refinement process. The path involves two aspects: maturation and liberation. Of these, one begins with one's ongoing experience being matured through the empower-ment process to some degree (ideal, middling, or lesser) based on one's ca-pacity as the recipient. Then, the teachings that liberate one concern the two stages of development and completion. [25a] A beginner implements the practice of these two alternately, but with familiarization one implements them simultaneously. In the stage of completion, moreover, one implements the practices of either the path of skillful method or that of freedom, which are the means that effect the refinement in accordance with the basis for that refinement process. The fruition entails more ordinary attainments (such as the ten indica-tions of successful practice, the eight qualities, the four aspects of enlight-ened activity, and so forth), as well as the most sublime attainment (being endowed with the seven attributes of integration, the eight qualities of pow-erful mastery, the four kayas, and the five aspects of timeless awareness). Depending on one's particular good fortune and diligence, these attainments"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 65 may actually be gained in this lifetime or perhaps in the intermediate state after death. 1. THE PATH OF SKILLFUL METHOD As for the Six Dharmas, which constitute the path of skillful method, these are practical techniques that rely on such methods as the arousal of bliss to make fully evident· the timeless awareness of Mahamudra that derives from these methods, and constitute a swift and profound path for those who are endowed with sharp acumen and diligence. They come from the tradition of the glorious Narotapa.75 The primary bases on which they rely are summaries of the key points of enlightened intent that are specific to five tantric cycles-Cakrasarp.vara and Hevajra, Mahamaya, CatuQ.pitha, and Guhyasamaja-and that permeate the Kalacakra cycle in general. These practices are thus renowned as the path of skillful method associated with the tantras. In this regard, we read in the True Measure of the Authentic Word of the Buddha: Ca.IJ.<;laH, karmamudra, illusory body, dream, utter lucidity, the intermediate state, the transference of consciousness, and transferring one's consciousness into another's body.76 In this regard, Cal).<;laH is renowned as the root of the path, karmamudra as the enhancement technique on the path, the practice of illusory body as the axis of the path, dream practice as the authentic measure of meditative warmth on the path, the practice of utter lucidity as the very core of the path, the practice of the intermediate state as the decisive factor on the path, the transference of consciousness as one's escort on the path, and the practice of transferring one's mind into another's body as the means to bridge interruptions on the path.77 Of these, the practices of cal).<;laH, illu-sory body, dream, and utter lucidity are known as the four basic practices, constituting the profound path that makes fully evident, within a single lifetime, the state of primordial unity that requires no more training. For those of lesser good fortune, for whom these practices will not make the fruition state evident in this lifetime, the instructions are given for the practices of the intermediate state and the transference of consciousness, making for a set of six practices. Karmamudra and the practice of trans-ferring one's consciousness into another's body are auxiliary practices to"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"66 THE CATALOG enhance one's practice or bridge interruptions, so they are not counted separately in the grouping. The foregoing is the exegesis of Lord Gampopa and as such is univer-sally espoused by those of the Dakpo Kagyu tradition. [25b] Lord Marpa subsumed these into what he termed the four comers of the teachings that bring awakening to buddhahood, while in the tradition of Ngok and his spiritual descendants, the essence of the Six Dharmas is condensed into the two processes of \"blending\" and \"transference.\" The venerable Mila sang of this as the direct introduction to the eight intermediate states; Tepupa explained this in terms of four pairs of eight practices; and Rechungpa spoke of it as the \"three cycles of blending\" or the \"ninefold cycle of blending and transference,\" and so forth. While there are numerous analyses and syntheses, the actual teachings are subsumed within the previous explanation. 2. THE PATH OF FREEDOM As for the path of freedom, or Mahamudra, according to the tradition of this precious lineage there is a sutra-based model, in which the instructions speak of the object as the utter lucidity that is free of elaboration, and the subjective perceiver as the absence of any conceptual process; with these instructions, one rests in equipoise. And there is a tantra-based model, that of Mahamudra specifically characterized as \"gaining contact with the innate nature\"-that is, the unity of bliss and emptiness-through timeless aware-ness awakened during the empowerment process and intense focus applied to the key points of the vajra body. Of these two models, the latter conforms to what was described previously, whereas the former derives primarily from the tradition of the master Maitripa. In essence, Mahamudra is nondual timeless awareness, profound and lu-cid and permeating all of samsara and nirvana, imbued with seven special attributes. As for the derivation of the term, if we analyze the Sanskrit term mahiimudrii, mudrii (\"seal\") means that all phenomena of the three situations of samsara, nirvana, and the spiritual path are such that they do not fall outside of this awareness, while mahii (\"supreme\") indicates that there is no other thing superior to it; this is a compound term that combines these meanings. If we analyze this, there are three aspects: Mahamudra of ground, of path, and of fruition:"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 67 1. The ground is a \"seal\" because all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are such that they do not fall outside this, for freedom and confusion occur respectively due to the realization of or the failure to realize that very fact of the way in which things truly abide. It is \"supreme\" because other than that there is no other dharmakaya to be sought. 2. The path is a \"seal\" because even while one is undertaking spiritual practice, having been introduced directly through the guru's pith instruc-tions, all consciousness and objects of consciousness are such that they do not fall outside this. It is \"supreme\" because other than that there is no other timeless awareness of buddhahood to be sought. 3. The fruition is a \"seal\" because once the way in which the ground of being is present becomes fully evident with adventitious obscurations being refined away through the process of the path, the entire manifest display of the kayas and timeless awareness is such that it does not fall outside the essence of this. [26a] It is \"supreme\" because it constitutes the consummate state of being. Regarding the innate nature, there are the two aspects of what is innate by nature and what is innate due to \"melting bliss.\" Of these, what is being referred to in the present context is not merely some speculative meditation on what is inferred after nothing is found at the conclusion of one's inves-tigation, but rather a path that is forged of the direct experience, free of concepts, of the unceasing unity of perceived appearances and mind, with-out the conceptual component of reifying that, so that one is brought into contact with that innate nature in its actuality. As Lord Gampopa stated: Mind, conceptual thought, and dharmakaya: these three are innate at the outset. Because through instruction one gains contact with these as one, wouldn't you call this \"gaining contact with the innate nature\"? With respect to the practical implementation of such a path, as Tilopa said: Ah! This is self-knowing timeless awareness. Transcending any verbiage or terminology, it is not the province of mind. I, Tilo, have nothing whatsoever to show you. Understand it by pointing it out to yourself!"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"68 THE CATALOG That is to say, once one has recognized one's own true way of abiding, the perspective of the ground of being, one meditates on this path using what are known as the six teachings of Tilopa: Do not reflect. Do not contemplate. Do not examine. Do not meditate. Do not think. Just rest, utterly relaxed. To implement these in one's practice amounts to what is identical in its significance to the cycles of Maitripa's teachings on the \"absence of any conceptual process.\" In addition to this, the lord Gampopa relied on the Second Annor of Mahdmudra, authored by the Noble Lord/8 and the instructional methods from the Kadam tradition. The fourfold preliminary practices ensure that meditation develops where it has not yet developed. The threefold process of direct introduction ensures that where it has developed, it is used as the path. Due to the methods for enhancing the practice and developing positive qualities, the issue of whether one is of excellent or lesser acumen is of no consequence; if one's ongoing experience is refined by one's immersion in the instructions, even those of lesser acumen are edified to the highest de-gree, for these are unsurpassable instructions that give one skill in the means to bring about the state of natural freedom. Of the followers of this tradition, the glorious Pakmo Drupa, as well as Jikten Sumgon of the Drigung school and his descendants, emphasized in-structions on the Five Principles of Mahamudra.79 The glorious Karmapas matured and liberated people with instructions on \"four key points of the ongoing cycle of the true nature of reality\" and \"direct introduction to the three kayas.\" [26b] In the glorious Drukpa Kagyu school, the upper branch of the Drukpa employ the \"eight major instructions,\" while the lower branch uses the \"fivefold capability.\" In the basic Kagyu tradition, instruction is given using the \"path of the six cycles.\" As the foregoing cases illustrate, there are limitless individual traditions associated with the four primary and eight secondary schools and their de-rivative lineages, and in each of these cases many of those to be guided have been brought to states of attainment. Given its vast display of methods, this tradition is entiiely worthy of one's complete confidence. E. SHANGPA KAGYU In the case of the Shangpa Kagyu, in general terms the learned and ac-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 69 complished master Khyungpo, who embodied five consummate attributes, received in its entirety the distilled essence of enlightened mind from some 150 learned and accomplished masters of the holy country of India, so that it was impossible to ascertain any finite number of what were renowned to be a limitless and unequaled array of methods. However, if these are summarized into categories, what developed was a threefold tradition, a graduated path that included theoretical teachings, debate, and practice. The latter consisted of five parts: the cycle of Niguma's teachings, the cycle of Sukhasiddhi's teachings, the cycle of Vajrasana's teachings, the cycle of Maitripa's teachings, and the cycle of Rahula's teachings. Of these cycles, the primary one is the cycle of teachings from the c;lakini of timeless aware-ness Nigupta,80 which for adherents of the Shangpa Kagyu lineage consists in its most extensive version of the \"fifteen special instructions,\" in its con-densed version of the \"instructions on the three bodies,\" and in its extremely condensed version simply of the \"natural freedom of deathless mind.\" While these and other classifications exist, the Five Golden Teachings of Shangpa constitute the widely known tradition of a one-to-one transmission bearing a vajra seal. These are: • the Six Dharmas of Niguma as the root; • Mahamudra as the trunk; • the three means of maintaining ongoing awareness as the branches; • the white and red forms of Khecari as the flowers; and • \"unerring immortality\" as the fruit. These instructions were set down as mnemonic manuals for visualization from the Vajra Verses of Vajradhara and the c;lakini of timeless awareness, so that even the topics for visualization and the supplication prayers are like refined gold, not in any way altered, changed, adulterated, or corrupted by the minds of ordinary individuals. 1. Srx DHARMAS OF NIGUMA The first of these is the set of Six Dharmas. As we read in the Vajra Verses: Having been matured through the four levels of empowerment, if those who are endowed with faith and diligence begin with impermanence, disenchantment, and an awareness of shortcomings as preliminaries"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"70 THE CATALOG and then exert themselves on this sublime path, [27a] they will awaken to buddhahood in six months, or a year, or within t)1is lifetime. That is to say, for individuals who have been matured through the con-ferral of an empowerment either into the five tantric classes (as described in the major tantra Ocean of Gems) or into the mandala of the glorious CakrasaJTivara, and through their receiving the transmission of the respec-tive blessings, the first practice to be undertaken is that of the \"purifying factor of the empty framework of A.\" They then primarily carry out four practices: the path of skillful method (called \"the natural blazing of bliss and warmth\"), illusory body (\"the natural freedom of attachment and aver-sion\"), the dream state (\"the natural purity of compounded confusion\"), and utter lucidity (\"the natural awakening of mental dullness\"). Through these practices, the distortions of the confusion experienced in four life situations are dispelled. The two practices of the transference of consciousness (\"awak-ening to buddhahood without meditation\") and the intermediate state (\"the sambhogakaya of the victorious ones\") are relegated to the status of auxil-iary practices in the stages of meditation for those of lesser diligence and acumen, so that complete freedom is gained in one of the three phases of the intermediate state, depending on the different levels of acumen (ideal, middling, or lesser). 2. MAHAMUDRA Concerning .Mahamudra, the learned and accomplished Khyungpo so high-ly valued the vajra verses of instruction on the ultimate heart essence of being, a state in which any conceptual process is absent, that he placed a small scroll of these inside an amulet box of Nepalese origin, which he wore around his neck. These instructions thus became know as \"Mahamudra of the amulet box\": • For the preliminaries, through the three states of utter relaxation81 one develops calm abiding and profound insight. • For the main body of practice, with the descent of the vajra state of timeless awareness, one is directly introduced through a stealthy ap-proach and, by becoming free of four flaws in one's natural state, one refines one's experience of mind itself with great precision."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 71 • For the concluding phase, one maintains the context in which the three kayas arise naturally. Through reliance on uncommon methods to enhance one's practice and eliminate hindrances, the supreme seal of Mahamudra, which is the nat-ural freedom of the four kayas-the very core of what is presented in all the sutras and tantras, and the distilled essence of all pith instructions-be-comes fully evident. 3. THREE MEANS OF MAINTAINING ONGOING AWARENESS One maintains ongoing awareness of all phenomena (visible, audible, or imaginable) as being of the nature of the guru, chosen deity, and illusori-ness, incorporating these into one's spiritual path by applying this key point. Thus, in a matter of mere months or years, the supremely blissful unity of lucidity and emptiness becomes the natural arising of the three kayas. 4. WHITE AND RED FORMS OF KHECARI As for the forms of the transcendent and accomplished conqueror, the Vajra Queen, that bear the colors of the sun and moon, [27b] by one's invok-ing them with the supplication prayers and the key points of visualization, cal).Q.ali-the unity of bliss and emptiness-blazes in the four cakras due to the freedom from attachment that is associated with each of these places. With that as one's working basis, one comes to experience Khecara, the \"en-joyment of space,\" as the supreme state of primordial unity. S. UNERRING IMMORTALITY By performing the thirty-two physical exercises that ensure immortality, one utilizes one's body on the path to liberation. Given that one's own mind is primordially unborn, its immortality is ensured as a supreme state of natural freedom. The physical body as the natural consequence of karma, being an assemblage of inanimate matter, is devoid of any basis for assigning birth or death. In actual fact, even the body occurs simply as a manifestation of mind, so if one gains the indwelling confidence of realizing mind to be deathless, the manifestation of the body is that of Mahamudra in the form of the deity, as deteqnined within basic space, without the error that is due to perceptions based on confusion."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"72 THE CATALOG It is said that one can gain the kaya of primordial unity in this lifetime by receiving just a few of these instructions, and that merely hearing them will allow one to awaken to buddhahood in the intermediate state after death, as the sambhogakaya of the victorious ones. As we read in the Vajra Verses: For those who implement this most sublime of paths, without reference to any other time, but now or in the intermediate state, the inseparable unity of bliss and emptiness will arise naturally as the three kayas so that they go to the totally pure realm of Khecara. The cycle of teachings from the <;lakini of timeless awareness Sukhasiddhi would seem to include simply two teachings: a set of Six Dharmas as the pro-found path of skillful method and \"Mahamudra, the pure state of timeless awareness.\" The sadhana practice that combines four deities is the instruc-tion that comes from the mahasiddha Rahula, while the profound teaching from Maitripa is that of the \"swift-acting lord protector of timeless aware-ness.\" It is evident that these are entirely transmissions based on authentic meditative experience and blessings. F. ZHIJE AND CH6 In the case of the tradition of Zhije (Pacification), according to the systems of instruction that came to Tibet, the meaning of the term Zhije derives from the emphasis placed in this tradition on causing the student to turn away from unvirtuous pursuits and on refining away the afflictive emotions in the ongoing experience of original mind. This process is one that in the short term pacifies the inferior physical states, factors contributing to illness, and so forth that are due to the force of previous karma, and so ensures that the practitioner can deal with and bear these. And so the specific name Damcho Duk-ngal Zhije (Sacred Teachings on the Pacification of Suffering) was ap-plied to this tradition. It was applied on the basis of such references as that in the \"Mother\": the mantra that utterly pacifies all suffering.82 [28a] and that in the most majestic of tantras:"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 73 It pacifies the pains of the three kinds of suffering. These are special instructions that combine into one the profound key points of all the sutras and tantras, for they are said to be \"of the transcendent per-fections in their essence, yet in accord with the mantra approach.\" Generally speaking, the powerful lord among siddhas Dampa Sangye gained mastery over the meaning of the unborn sound of the Sanskrit vowels and consonants and, through inconceivable secret means,83 presented im-measurable avenues of teachings-through symbols, words, and meanings-to beings who were to be guided, according to their temperaments and lev-els of acumen, so that there was no single tradition to be systematized. He taught his students, however, in accord with his own life history, and they for the most part followed his example in three ways: (1) the working basis being that one was endowed with the three levels of ordination; (2) the path being the challenging one of ascetic practice; and (3) the result being con-duct that benefited others. Dampa Sangye first formulated the Three Cycles of the Lamp of the Zhije Tradition, which summarized and presented the three higher trainings as these are implemented in a practical manner by those of lesser, middling, or ideal acumen. Three specific lines of transmission became renowned here in Tibet as the earlier, the middle, and the later line: • The first line of transmission was the \"Kashmiri tradition,\" which taught all the advice of fifty-four male and female siddhas, summa-rized into five key points as illustrated by five analogies. • The middle line of transmission included three traditions: those of Ma, So, and Karp. ~>-The Ma tradition involved a process of direct introduction through sixteen practical instructions that rely on the \"lineage of ultimate meaning,\" and a process of eliminating false assumptions through sixteen major points that rely on the \"lineage of words.\" ~ The So tradition involves a process of direct introduction to an ideal, middling, or lesser extent using three key points that are the means of resting the mind, and then a process of practical imple-mentation using ten themes. ~>-The Karp tradition, although it began as a very extensive method of instruction, in later times seems to have continued simply as instruction on the meaning of the Heart Essence of the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"74 THE CATALOG • The later line of transmission was the tradition of the bodhisattva Kunga. It consists of pith instructions concerning Prajfiaparamita (the \"transcendent perfection of wisdom\"), which are nevertheless in ac-cord with the secret mantra approach-a direct introduction to the ultimate heart essence of being (through the conferral of this funda-mental insight in one's ongoing experience) adorned with the skillful method of the supreme principle of interdependent origination in its many ramifications. [28b] These are pith instructions for the practical implementation of all the Buddha's teachings at one time, on a single meditation seat. With respect to the cycle of instructions for the practical implementation of the Immaculate Drop, this is subsumed within the following steps: • One begins with the conferral of the four levels of empowerment through ·symbols (an extraordinary process unique to this tradition), which matures the student's working basis for the teachings where this has not previously been matured. • One proceeds through the strict parameters of the white, red, and black instructions, which causes meditative experiences to develop where these have not developed previously. • One forges one's path of the guru's blessings, which causes realization to arise where it has not arisen previously. • The assemblage of words causes the meaning to penetrate one's mind, which eliminates conceptual elaboration where this has not yet been eliminated. As for the actual process of instruction, according to the pith instructions for seven complete meditation sessions, there are three alternatives: 1. For those of the highest acumen, the key point of beholding pure aware-ness in all its nakedness is the \"white instruction,\" causing them to awaken to buddhahood all at once through directly beholding the uncontrived way in which genuine mind truly abides, beyond dualistic consciousness. 2. For those of middling acumen, the key point of devotion as the single decisive point is the \"red instruction,\" in which the four kayas are attained in leaps and bounds due to the refinement of the bindu of the three avenues of body, speech, and mind in equal measure, which perfects the path of the four kayas of the guru."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 75 3. For those of lesser acumen, the key point of advice that defines issues precisely is the \"black instruction,\" since one gains the five paths successively. Of these three, the last involves the following: • Subsuming the eight topics of instruction on the external level of the dialectical approach in a single basic format, by practicing the five paths during a single session, one is elevated through one's mental training to the path of accumulation. • By perfecting the five paths of the mother tantras, in which the motile factor of subtle energy is aroused and channeled, during a single ses-sion, one is brought into the strict confines of ascetic practice on the path of linkage. • By meditating during a single complete session on the four mudras, the instructions on the experience of bliss from the mother tantras, one is ushered into the path of seeing. • Due to one's meditating during a single complete session on the four yogas (or four states of meditative absorption), the instructions on the ultimate heart essence of being, one's practice is enhanced through the equal taste of the path of meditation. • By meditating during a single complete session on the Six Branches of Union, the instructions on the natural freedom of pure awareness, one attains the path of consummation, free of anything more to be done. This method is the special teaching of Dampa Sangye, which had never existed before in India or Tibet. On the external level, it tears out the heart of the Three Compilations; [29a] on the internal level, it severs the aorta of the four classes of tantra; on the secret level, it opens the eye of ultimate heart essence of being; and on the level of thatness, it loosens the seal of secrecy imposed by the <;lakinis. Thus, it constitutes the strict path of prac-tice for implementing the limitless range of the Buddha's teachings during a single meditation session, and it is adorned with the skillful method of the supreme principle of interdependent origination in its many ramifications. As we read in the Graduated Path by Zhikpo Nyiseng: The salt of the lineages of attainment in general, the great graduated path, the strict path of accomplishment, the united pith instructions of the sutras and tantras in general, this is indeed found in no other case: Ah!"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"76 THE CATALOG As for the auxiliary tradition to this, that of Damcho Dukyi Choyul (Sacred Teachings on the Maras as the Object of Severance), if the name is interpreted on the basis of supportive circumstances, this derives from the many classifications of conduct-such as secret conduct, the conduct of pure awareness, and so forth-as an enhancement of spiritual practice that are spoken of in the classes of anuttarayoga tantras, as well as what we read in the \"Mother\": those who wish to engage in the conduct of the profound and transcendent perfection of wisdom should train in this way. Since this tradition constitutes the practical implementation of the mean-ing found in these sources, the related name \"sphere of activity\" was applied. If the name is interpreted from the perspective of antidotes to counter-productive circumstances, in the context of the cause-oriented approach of the transcendent perfections, the four truths are paired with respect to the choices one makes of engaging in what one accepts or turning away from what one rejects. Because this tradition involves integrating the truths of suffering and its all-pervasive origin into one's spiritual path, it constitutes the practical implementation of the profound key points of meditation as a countermeasure and the \"equal taste\" of things, and this is implied in the name \"Maras as the Object of Severance.\" In this name, the meaning of the term severance (Tib. gcod) is as explained in the brahmin Aryadeva's small source text: Because this cuts through to the very root of mind, cuts the root of the five poisons as afflictive mental states, serves as the cause of meditation as the consummation of view, and cuts off all nai:ve hope, fear, or resistance to conduct that is daunting, severance is used as the definitive term. As for the meaning of the term object (Tib. yul), because the afflictive states that are to be cut off develop through the mind focusing its attention on unsuitable objects, the advanced practitioner focuses intently on these objects, so that the habitual reactions are aroused, and then cuts them off in the immediacy of that very moment. Of four mainstream transmissions of the Indian teachings of this tradition that flourished in Tibet, the two lineages from Padampa Sangye were those"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 77 of the \"male line of Severance\" and the \"female line of Severance\"; [29b] it is the latter that nowadays has spread everywhere. And this is primarily a lineage of the meditative experience of the accomplished master Machik herself, who gained freedom on the basis of the Buddha's word. The source of the view is the Prajfiaparamita, while the specific skillful methods are dis-tinctively those of the mantra approach, and so this tradition is held to blend the realization of the sutra and mantra approaches. The overview of the path of this tradition is stated in the sutra titled the Compendium: Due to four causal factors, the bodhisattvas are endowed with powerful skill. It is difficult for the four maras to challenge them, for these cannot perturb them. They abide in emptiness, yet do not in any way forsake ordinary beings. They act according to whatever is taught and are imbued with the blessings of sugatas. That is to say, this is the practical implementation of some four themes found in these teachings: (1) the view of abiding in emptiness; (2) the com-passion of not forsaking beings in any way; (3) the discipline of bodhisattvas, acting according to whatever the Buddha taught; and (4) the blessings con-ferred by sugatas. 1. As for the view of abiding in emptiness, initially one eliminates the belief that the mind-body aggregates that are included in one's ongoing experience constitute a self, and then abides continually in the meaningful experience of a lack of any identity, without one's mind focusing on any notion of subtle traits being associated with anything associated with other beings in one's objective perception. 2. With respect to not forsaking beings in any way, one embraces the path to enlightenment and with a sense of great compassion turns away from conduct that harms beings, feeling a special love for those with material form (such as the afflicted, the sick, and so forth), while also not indulging in maliciously seeking to harm those without material form (such as gods and demons). 3. To act according to whatever is taught means to eliminate frivolous behavior and arouse bodhicitta-the motivation toward enlightenment-so that one does not act in ways that contradict the pledges associated with that."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"78 THE CATALOG 4. To be blessed by sugatas means that, having taken refuge, one prays with fervent devotion to one's primary gurus and those of the lineage. With the foregoing as a basis, at the outset of one's practical implemen-tation of these instructions, one receives the empowerments that are unique to this tradition, which render one a suitable aspirant. [30a] As for the main process of instruction, for all branches of this tradition-the sutra meth-od, the mantra method, the methods blending the realizations of sutra and mantra, and so forth-the general format is to begin with the preliminary exercise unique to this tradition, that of reinforcing positive factors on the physical level and driving home the vital point of blessings invoked through devoted supplication. Then, for the main body of practice, through pursuing pure awareness and pure awareness alone, one seeks out the hidden flaw of ordinary mind. Having become involved in a methodical approach, one is shown the means of resting the mind. Through the process of \"opening the doorway to space,\" the meaning of. the \"mother\" is directly introduced. In formal meditative equipoise, one maintains the experience of one's own true nature-inde-scribable, inconceivable, and inexpressible-attaining dharmakaya in a sin-gle session. In postmeditation awareness, according to the Great Bundle of Precepts: The entanglements of material objects have been cut off; the entanglements of nonmaterial mind have been cut off; the entanglements of fixations due to excess enthusiasm have been cut off. The maras are divided into four groups; these are, however, subsumed in the mara of complacency. As this passage states, with the four maras having been cut off through one's being freed from the dualistic frameworks of hope and fear, of accep-tance and rejection, whatever has proved difficult to cut off has nevertheless been cut off by one's crushing it without hesitation. Applying oneself to a structured practice of sessions in frightening environments, one frequents those environments armed with the instructions, so that when any and all of one's reactions are provoked, one blends basic space and pure awareness and uses the visualizations for casting out one's body as food-the white feast, the red feast, the variegated feast, and so forth-alternating peaceful methods with wrathful ones. With this, one experiences concepts of good versus bad as having an equal taste, so that one puts an end to gods artd"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 79 demons outwardly and the belief in a self inwardly in light of the absence of any such identity. In the shorter term, one completes the process of an-nihilating these, while in the final analysis one gains the three aspects of indwelling confidence, which in itself constitutes a perfecting of the paths and levels as a natural consequence. G. )ORDRUK As for the Vajrayoga, the hidden meanings that are implied with vajra words in the condensed versions of such anuttarayoga tantras as those of Cakrasarj1vara and Hevajra are presented clearly in that of the glorious Kalacakra. In all the extensive source tantras, such as the Sublime Original Buddha, the profound meaning that they present directly with a single intent is that of the sublime yoga of Mahamudra, known as the Six Branches of Union. This is the unsurpassable point to which one can go as the consum-mation of the entire stage of completion. [30b] As for the way in which one becomes involved in this path, in the Stainless Light the Transcendent and Accomplished Conqueror speaks of threefold confidence with respect to this mantra approach: Initially, at a certain point one has confidence in the tantra, then confidence in the guru, and then confidence in oneself. It is through these three that the path to completely perfect buddha-hood is thoroughly finished. As this passage states, it is because one is endowed with this threefold con-fidence that this becomes the totally pure path that brings one closer to the most sublime state of accomplishment. In this regard, what are to be accomplished are the vajras of the three secrets and of the timeless awareness of tathagatas, those gone to suchness. The Six Branches of Union, which ensure this accomplishment, are listed in the source tantra of the Kalacakra: Withdrawal, meditative stability, channeling subtle energy, and furthermore retention of it, recollection, and meditative absorption: these are held to be the Six Branches of Union. These are similar to what is also described in the Subsequent Tantra of the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"80 THE CATALOG Gathering of Secrets and the Vast Range of l)ti.kas. With respect to the way in which the practices are accomplished, they are accomplished it is through the four phases of approach and accomplishment. That is to say, if we consider the combining of the preliminaries and the main body of practice (as these are specific to the completion stage) as con-stituting the completion of a single set of the four phases of approach and accomplishment, the following proves to be the case: 1. Since the preliminary stage of fourfold disregard lays the foundation for the deity's form, it constitutes the phase of approach 2. In the main body of practice, the branches of withdrawal, meditative stability, channeling subtle energy, and retention constitute the phase of intimate approach. 3. Recollection of desire through the four mudras constitutes the branch of accomplishment of the bliss of supreme unchanging desire. 4. Meditative absorption constitutes the branch of supreme accomplish-ment, since it ensures that the kaya of timeless awareness is actually accom-plished. If we consider the actual way in which this accomplishment is gained: o The two branches of withdrawal and meditative stability are the yoga of the essence of the vajra principle of enlightened form; they refine the central subtle channel and bring accomplishment of vajra form in all its aspects. • The channeling of subtle energy and retention are the yoga of the va-jra principle of enlightened speech; channeling energy brings the sub-tle energies of the lateral rasana and lalana channel§ into the central channel, while retention causes these to become stabilized, bringing accomplishment of vajra speech in all its aspects. [3la] • Recollection is the yoga of the vajra principle of enlightened mind; due to one's reliance on the four mudras, the bodhicitta that has been melted is maintained free of dissipation, bringing accomplishment of vajra mind in all its aspects. • Meditative absorption is the yoga of the vajra principle of timeless awareness; that selfsame bliss is integrated inseparably with rupakaya, bringing accomplishment of vajra timeless awareness-the primordial unity of bliss and emptiness-in all its aspects. Alternatively, it is also sai.d that the two branches of withdrawal and meditative stability are the phase of the accomplishment of total recall; the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 81 two of the channeling of subtle energy and retention are the phase of the ac-complishment of subtle energy; recollection is the phase of the accomplish-ment of bliss; and meditative absorption is the phase of the accomplishment of suchness. With respect to these branches, when the Oral Transmission of Kalacalcra-pada says: one should understand that each and every one has six .. the former masters of this lineage have interpreted the meaning implied in explaining each branch through a set of six topics: (1) the meaning of the term, (2) the appropriate time for that meditation, (3) the. branch as a meth-od of meditation, ( 4) the authentic indications of one's having meditated, (5) an analysis of what is purified and what purifies, and (6) the result that is gained through meditation. These branches can also be subsumed within threefold virtue. Vajra-garbha speaks of the two branches of withdrawal and meditative stability as the path that is virtuous at the outset; the two of channeling subtle energy and retention as the path that is virtuous in the interim; and the two of recollection and meditative absorption as that path that is virtuous in the final outcome. In general, the teachings of our Teacher in their en-tirety are virtuous at the outset, in the interim, and in the final outcome. From the point of view of this consummate stage of definitive meaning, however, meditation based on conceptual thinking, or the bliss of kar-mamudra practice being considered to be the ultimate state, or medita-tion on emptiness as the nonconceptual state reached at the conclusion of mental investigation are neither exceptionally virtuous (since they can be characterized as causes of samsara), nor do they constitute, respectively, the mandala of ultimate reality or supreme bliss or true emptiness. In this path, there is virtue at the outset, since initially it brings accomplishment of empty forms as the mandala of ultimate reality; there is virtue in the interim, since later on it brings about the cessation of the subtle energy of karma, which is the cause of discursive conceptual thinking; and there is virtue in the final outcome, since it brings about accomplishment of the unchanging ultimate state of hindu. [3lb] And there is virtue in all three stages of the outset, the interim, and the final outcome, since this path entails the perspective of authentic timeless awareness, a nonconceptual state that precludes mental investigation; for the meaning of virtue here is identified as bliss and its attendant causes."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"82 THE CATALOG Thus what is virtuous at the outset brings accomplishment of the medi-tative absorption of extraordinary calm abiding and profound insight. The initial stage of what is virtuous in the interim blends subtle energy and mind in its earlier stages, and the later stage opens the gates of the cakras. What is virtuous in the final outcome ensures the accomplishment of the changeless kaya of timeless awareness. Through the use of these six branches as yogic practice, at first one is imbued with a partial glimpse of vajra timeless awareness; then step by step one gains the complete blessing of the \"vajra flow,\" so that visionary expe-riences and significant perceptual indications arise. One's mind abides as a matter of course in a nonconceptual state, while there occur physical sen-sations of shaking and trembling and verbal experiences of uttering various sounds. When one allows the natural expression of these, the blockages of the three avenues of body, speech, and mind are gradually released. Finally, the three factors of masculine energy, feminine energy, and subtle motile energy are purified within the six cakras, so that the kaya of timeless aware-ness of the victorious ones of the six families is accomplished. H. DORJE SUMGYI NYENDRUP Concerning the tradition of Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup (Stages of Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras), we may cite the Gathering of Secrets: Consider your mind as like your body, your body as like your mind, your mind as like something uttered in words. The instructions of this tradition are unique, for in the context of the ground of being, a connection is determined-that the three vajras cannot be divided from one another-and in the context of the spiritual path, one meditates on the yoga of the indivisible vajra state so that, in tl1e context of the fruition state, the three vajra secrets are made fully evident. According to the Vajra Verses: Through the refinement of the subtle channels, the body is purified of distortions; through the refinement of the subtle energies, the speech is purified of distortions;"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATION OF TEACHINGS 83 through the attainment of the state without dissipation, the habitual tendencies of ordinary mind are overcome. The blockages of the cakras are eradicated though the progression of the four degrees of joy. One wakes from the sleep of nonrecognition through coming back out of unconsciousness. The mind that is free of desire and in which faintheartedness and aversion are exhausted gains freedom in supreme bliss through the purification of desire. The meaning of the lines cited is as follows: 1. In the branch of approach, which purifies the body and the subtle channels, the causal factor of the yoga that utilizes the key points of the body is withdrawal, and its result is meditative stability. [32a] One comes to a definitive conclusion through the Three Compilations. 2. In the branch of accomplishment of the vajra principle of enlightened speech, which purifies the speech and the subtle energies, with the vajra mantra repetition as the preliminary step, the causal factor is the channeling of subtle energy, and its result is retention. One comes to a definitive con-clusion through four factors: these two branches, their effects, and the result that they accomplish. 3. In the branch of supreme accomplishment of the vajra principle of enlightened mind, which purifies the mind and hindu, the branch of rec-ollection presents completion of the mundane phase of the spiritual path in any of three ways: ideally by reliance on 1 cal).c;lali, in middling cases on one's own body, and in lesser cases on the 'body of another. The branch of meditative absorption, which presents completion of the transcendent phase of the path, entails the mind abiding; one-pointedly in the bliss of pure self-knowing awareness-the nonduality of both aspects of supreme bliss, that which is conceptually structured and that which is unstructured. On the external level, then, one secures all hindu of the refined essence that is subject to loss.

The various texts and transmissions of blessings for the eighty-four mahasiddhas. Although some three distinct traditions of these teachings were brought to Tibet, it seems that there was some controversy that caused learned ones with the discerning eye of the dharma to have misgivings about these. From among these three, it would seem that the Indian source for the tradition of the scholar VIraprabhasvara included here (as trans-lated by Menyak Lotsawa Mondrup Sherap) can be verified as authentic, and that the transmission of blessings for this tradition also included here (which is according to the methods set down by Jetsun Kunga Drolchok and is the tradition of the gurus of India, uncorrupted by some more gener-ic format of authorization rituals) can be taken as reliable. And although there is definitely a specific transmission of blessings for each of the siddhas, while the method included here (that of conferring all of these in a single transmission) is intended to simplify the process, it is not simply my own invention. [39b] Rather, I have written out an arrangement of this practical method, having received explicit permission to do so from my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, according to the advice conferred on him by the mahasiddha Lavapa. 446 Also included are: • a ritual honoring the eighty-four siddhas;447 • a guru yoga according to the Indian tradition;448 and • a manual of instruction for the Six Dharmas associated with these sid-dhas, together with some ancient sources.449 2.

NYINGMA In the first place, of the cycles of teachings from the Early Translation school of the Nyingma, even the lineages of textual transmission for the Concise Path, the Garland of Views, and the Mamas' Sphere of Activity are rare, to say nothing of the lineages of word-by-word explanation. Nevertheless, my pre-cious lord guru, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, received the transmissions of these teachings from genuine teachers who held the unbroken essential lin-eages for them. The underlying basis that exemplifies the first of the seven great modes of personal transmission that this lord himself received consists of the extensive lineages of the eight great mainstream traditions of accom-plishment. He thus conferred on me the reading transmissions, explanato-ry instructions, and authorization rituals as a direct lineage. In fact, witzh respect to all of the more ancient texts that are mentioned below, all the lineages that I received should be regarded as following this same format, that is, having been received through the grace of my lord guru Khyentse. The way in which the lineage for the essential manual of instruction on the Heart Essence of Magical Illusion by the omniscient Longchenpa was transmitted from the author himself is as recorded in the record of teach-ings received by the Great Terti:in (revealer of hidden treasure teachings) of the Mindroling tradition.535 From Gyurme Dorje himself, the transmission passed down to Rinchen Namgyal, Srinatha, Jikme Lingpa, Jangchup Dorje, Chi:ikyi Lodri:i, Rikpai Dorje, Khen Padmavajra, Kunkhyen Dorje Ziji, and from him to me."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"114 THE CATALOG As for Four Stages of Yogic Practice by Dewa Saldze, my lord guru himself graciously recommended that it be included at this point in the collection, but the text has proved to be unavailable. If it is ever located, it should be inserted here. Concerning the instruction on innate meditation extracted from the Discourse on the Gathering, the way in which this was transmitted conforms to that of the Mindroling tradition, while from the Great Terti:in it passed, in succession, to Dharmasri, Rinchen Namgyal, Orgyen Tenzin Dorje, Trinle Namgyal, Rikzin Paljor Gyatso, Jikme Ngotsar, Orgyen Chemchok Palgyi Dorje, Gyalse Ril<pai Dorje, Khen Damchi:i Ozer, and Kunkhyen Lama Dorje Ziji Tsal, from whom I received it. An alternative lineage is that of the ma-turing empowerments and liberating instructions that the Katok master Drao Chi:ibum received from Sakyamitra (a holder of the Zur lineage), and that passed down through successive generations in the eastern region of Tibet to the vajra holder Perna Sangak Tenzin, from whom I received it. [4lb] As for the outer cycle of the Category of Mind in the Great Perfection ap-proach, the lineage for the thirty-seventh chapter extracted from the tantra the All-Creating Monarch accords with that found in Minling Terchen's re-cord of teachings that he received. It then passed to Sungtrul Tsultrim Dorje, Tsultrim Gyaltsen of Bi:inlung, Tukse Tenzin Gyurme, Sungtrul Ngawang Kunzang Dorje, Tukse Gyurme Chokdrup Palbar, Sungtrul Tenzin Drupchok Dorje, Khenchen Orgyen Tenzin, Zichen Trinle Namgyal, Jetsun Trinle Chadron, and the omniscient Gyurme Tenzin Pelgye Palzangpo, from whom I received it. As for the small text of annotations to the preceding, as well as the vajra songs of the eighteen texts by masters of the Category of Mind and Smelting Gold from Ore, these were transmitted to me through the grace of the pre-cious lord Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. The lineage for the empowerment into the dynamic energy of pure aware-ness, the means for direct introduction in a radical manner to the enlightened intent of the eighteen \"mother and child\" texts of the Category of Mind, which is conferred on the basis of the manual written by the Katok master Mokti:in Dorje Palzangpo, began with dharmakaya Samantabhadra and passed to the sambhogakaya (the victorious ones of the five families), the nirmal).akaya lord of secrets VajrapaiJ.i, the master Garap Dorje, the \"twenty-one learned ones,\" the translator Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo of Gyalmorong, Jfianakumara of the Nyak clan, Sokpo Palgyi Yeshe, Sangye Yeshe of the Nup clan, Yeshe Gyatso of the Nup clan, Sherap Chok of the Nyang clan, Yeshe Jungne of the Nyang clan, Zurchen Sakya Jungne, Zurchung Sherap Drak, Kyoti:in Sakya"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"LINEAGE SuccESSIONS liS Yeshe, Dropukpa Sakya Senge, Dragon Dampa Sakya Gyal, Khepa Cheton and his spiritual son, Cheton Zunge, Seton Tashi, Lama Tangton Bumye, Choje Lakyap Dorje, [42a] Drinchen Khepa Chenpo, Khandro Palgyi Yeshe, Machik Drinchen Zurmo, Zurham Sakya Jungne, Zurmo Gendun Bum, Sakya Shenyen of the Zur clan, Khedrup Draa Chobum, Shenyen Konchok Zangpo, Dorje Zangpo of Katok, Dorje Namgyal of Darlung, Lodro Palden Pangton Karma Guru, Jatang Kunzang Paljor, Rikzin Trinle Lhundrup, and Lochen Chogyal Tenzin, who transmitted it to Terchen Gyurme Dorje.

From the Great Terton536 the lineage passed to Dharmasri, Rinchen Namgyal, Oc;liyana, Trinle Namgyal, Perna Wangyal, Namkhai Dorje, Tenzin Pelgye, Perna Tashi, Zhenpen Taye, and then to my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who graciously bestowed the transmission on me. An alternative transmission passed from the Great Terton through the great translator537 to Mingyur Paldron, Rinchen Namgyal, Perna Tenzin, Trinle Namgyal, and Perna Wangyal, from whom Gyurme Tenzin Pelgye received it. Of the three major traditions of teachings for the Category of Mind, that of the Nyang tradition is represented by the manual of instruction authored by Sokdokpa Lodro Gyaltsen.

The lineage for the supplication prayer to the lineage of the Category of Mind is the same, from the author himself onward. The lineage for the manual of instruction according to the eastern Tibetan tradition, by the Katok master Chenga Namkha Dorje, is a lineage of reading transmission that also includes that of the detailed instruction for the Web of Magical Illusion-that is, from Samantabhadra to Vajrasattva, Garap Dorje, Maii.jusrimitra, Dhahetala, Gomadeva, Rapnang Tenma, Tsokyi Dakpo, Nagarjuna, Dorje Lekpa Tsal, Kukuraja, the \"one with nine top-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"116 THE CATALOG knots,\" Dipaq1kara, Srisi111ha, Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo, Salrap Chenpo, Palgyi Gyalpo of Ma, Jangchup Sherap of the Nyen clan, Yi:inten Jungne, Chokro Gomchung, Jampa Gomchen, Jangti:in Namdak, Dampa Deshek, Choje Tsangton, Jampa Bum, Yeshe Bum, Yenpa Rinpoche, Bodhisrl, and Vajrasri (alternatively, from the great Jampa Bum the transmission passed to Tsade Chengawa, Drung Tukje Yeshe, Tonpa Wangjor Pal, to Vajrasrl).

As for the two primers (longer and shorter) on the Six Dharmas, Tilopa's pith instructions on the Six Dharmas, Naropa's vajra song on the Six Dharmas, and Lord Milarepa's Three Cycles Clarifying the Oral Lineage, the lineages are as in the preceding case of Ganges Mahc'imudra. The second category of texts in this tradition contains developmental instructions of two kinds: empowerments as the causal factor that brings spiritual maturation and the main sources of instructions (both primary and secondary) that bring liberation. Of the first kind, there are three versions of the primary cycles of the oral lineage: the extensive, the intermediate, and the concise. 1. In the extensive version, the Rechung Nyengyu (Oral Lineage of Rechungpa), the lineages for the following teachings-the short source by Tilopa, the more common manual Wish-Fulfilling Gem, the Six Dharmas (which bring total liberation through the \"upper gateway\"), the physical exercises for the path of skillful means, the \"lower gateway to supreme bliss,\" Supreme Bliss: Luminous Pure Awareness, and the Mahamudra text Shedding Light on Timeless Awareness-passed from Vajradhara to the c.lakini of timeless awareness, Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Rechungpa, Khyung Tsangpa, and to the latter's three heart children Marton Tsultrim Jtmgne, Lopi:in Targom, and Machik Angjo (known as the three accom-plished heart children).

As for the Four Scrolls of Heard Instructions, the lineage was transmitted as a main part of the Zurmang Nyengyu (Oral Lineage of Zurmang), so that the two scrolls on the yogic practices of subtle channels and energies and the transference of consciousness were conferred by Naropa on Marpa, while the two on Mahamudra and the intermediate state were bestowed on Marpa by Maitripa. Marpa then transmitted them all to Tsurton Wangde, Shengom Gomchung, Dakpo Dotse, Lopon Nyima Lungpa, Deshek Rinpoche Toktse Gangpa, the omniscient Choje Kung a Dondrup of Nyedo, and Yungton Dorje Pal, after whom it is the same as for the oral lineage.

The reading transmission for the instruction manual Meaningful on Sight, which I received in the presence of Perna Nyinje Wangpo, came through the same lineage as the transmission of the empowerments. The lineage for the works of Jonang Jetsun Rinpoche-the sadhana for the nine-deity mandala, the ritual for honoring the foregoing, the texts for the sublime empowerments, the instruction manual, the manuals of the signs and authentic measure of practice, the ways to dispel hindrances, and the summary of the physical exercises-passed from Jetsun himself"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"164 THE CATALOG to Gyaltsap Rinchen Namgyal, Lodrti Namgyal, Ngawang Trinle, Kunzang Wangpo, Tsewang Norbu, Chtikyi Jungne, Tsewang Kunkhyap, Ngedtin Tenzin Rapgye (who was also known as Karma Ratna), and Karma Osel Gyurme, who conferred it on me.

During that initial period, through the kindness of the second Buddha Padmakara, the great scholar Vimalamitra, the great translator Bairotsana, and others, the lineage of at-tainment based on the three yogas first appeared. From that time until the great Jetsun Taranatha later received the personal transmissions of advice from the powerful lord among siddhas Santigupta, major and minor systems of advice appeared throughout these earlier and later periods-advice con-cerning the practical application of general and specific principles of the sutras and tantras. In the case of each of these systems, those of the highest degree of acumen and good fortune could gain the state of primordial unity that requires no more training in a single lifetime; those of an intermedi-ate degree could awaken in their ongoing experience the manifest states of realization associated with the paths and levels, to whatever extent was commensurate with their faith and diligence; and even those of a lesser de-gree underwent a gradual maturation in their ongoing experience, so that through a succession of lifetimes they attained the state of complete free-dom. The scriptures and historical records attest to these facts. Even to forge some connection with such teachings closed the doorway to rebirth in samsara and lower states of existence, while planting the seeds of liberation and enlightenment in one. But while such inconceivable enlight-ened activity manifested to a marvelous and superb extent, from the point of view of this country of Tibet the periods of \"fruition\" and \"attainment\" have successively passed away, so that the somewhat superficial presence of the teachings of the scriptures has become predominant and we are on the point of passing into the period of \"mere outer signs.\" It is due to such"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"176 THECATALOG events that even those who uphold the lineages of practice engage in rote repetition of the theory underlying that practice and are caught up in dis-tractions involving the eight mundane values.

In such times as these there appeared one who is an expression of the playful dance of the spiritual king Tsangpa Lhayi Metok629 himself taking conscious rebirth in order to stir the embers of the teachings-the omni-scient and all-seeing Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, a true master of the seven modes of personal transmission.

In coming to appreciate the integrity of. each of these traditions without any sectarian prejudice, I have felt the lotus of my faith blossom in an unbiased way, and I am there-fore unsullied by any stain of rejecting the teachings. I have taken as my guiding principle such words as those of the omniscient Dolpo Sangye, who said: In all lifetimes, may I shoulder the great responsibility of teachings. And even if I am unable to take on that great challenge, may I at least have concern that the teachings might otherwise wane. To me, these lines mean that even though I consider myself incapable. of actually benefiting the teachings, due to my hopes that their ongoing transmission will not be interrupted, I have exerted myself greatly to re-quest these teachings from holy masters who uphold these lineages and have gathered all the most important texts-sources for empowerment and instruction-in this series of volumes. In this way, I pray again and again that henceforth those holy people who truly hold these precious teachings in their hearts may ensure ongoing enlightened activity on a vast scale, upholding and protecting and spreading teachings through explaining, lis-tening to, and practicing them; for to do so will fulfill the intentions of vic-torious ones and their heirs."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"CoLOPHON 177 0Ip svasti siddhi jayantu [May all that is auspicious be realized!] The source of all limitless virtue and excellence, that of conditioned existence and the peace of nirvana, lies solely in the precious teachings of victorious ones; and the very essence of those teachings is the Vajrayana approach of secret mantra, the appearance of which is as difficult to ensure as that of the udumvara flower.

He began by teaching principally the training in discipline, what came to be known as the compilation of Vinaya. The ethical codes of Vinaya contain extensive overviews that classify actions according to their nature or their relation to formal precepts. The discourses of Vinaya concern the stages of meditative absorption and the celibate way of life undertaken in yogic practice. The further teachings of Vinaya give extensive, detailed expla-nations and analyses of these topics. Then, at the excellent place of Vulture Peak, the excellent teacher Shakyamuni spoke to several excellent retinues. Among the four relatively ordinary retinues were about five thousand arhats, including Shariputra and Maudgalyayana; about five hundred nuns, including Shakyamuni 's stepmother, Prajapati; and groups of laypeople, including the householder Anathapindaka and the laywoman Sagama. As well, there were enormous numbers of gods, nagas, demigods, and gandharvas. The extraordinary retinue was made up of an enormous number of bodhisattvas-includ-ing Bhadrapala, Ratnasambhava, and Jaladatta-who had truly attained great levels of realization. On excellent occasions, he taught these reti-nues the excellent dharma-the intermediate cycle of the Buddha's words, the various teachings pertaining to the characterization of phenomena as nonexistent; this he did between the ages of forty-three and seventy-two.

Then, in excellent places-not any one place-such as the human world and the abodes of gods and nagas, on excellent occasions, the ex-cellent teacher Shakyamuni spoke to an excellent retinue of innumerable monks, nuns, gods, nagas, bodhisattvas, and others, teaching the excellent dharma-the final cycle of the Buddha's words, the various teachings per-taining to definitive truth; this he did between the ages of seventy-three and eighty-two. He taught principally the training in sublime knowing, what came to be known as the compilation of Abhidharma. The ethical codes of Abhidharma have to do with taming the afflictive states in ways that are easy to implement and involve little hardship. The discourses of Abhidharma discuss the vast range of techniques for engaging in the expe-rience of suchness. The further teachings of Abhidharma analyze in great detail the mind-body aggregates, the fields of experience, the components of perception, the controlling factors, consciousness, and tathagatagarbha (the innately, totally pure \"buddha nature\") and discuss related topics. As the sutra The Seven Hundred Stanzas states: The Sage taught the collections of the dharma thoroughly to benefit beings. In stages, at various places and times, the Buddha imparted his teachings in melodious tones ... According to the extraordinary interpretation, in tenns of the intel-ligence of those to be guided, for those whose karma allowed them to comprehend the teachings gradually, it seemed that the Buddha taught in three successive cycles. For those whose intelligence enabled them to comprehend everything all at once, he seemed to teach, in its entirety and on a single occasion, everything that needed to be taught. According to the sutra The Majestic Array of Qualities: Without saying anything at all, I manifest to beings in infinite and pervasive ways. When there are those who sincerely wish to comprehend in a gradual way, that is what occurs for all of them. For those who comprehend all at once, the varieties of spiritual teachings manifest in their entirety. Such is the great quality of enlightened speech-to fulfill beings' hopes just as they wish.

Teachings of the first kind were communicated directly by the transcendent and accomplished conqueror Vajradhara in Akanishtha and by other buddhas in other realms. The tantras of enlightened form were taught in the pure realm of Ghanavyuha, and the teacher was Vairochana. The tantras of en-lightened speech were taught in Sukhavati by the teacher Amitabha. The abode of the tantras of enlightened mind was Abhirati, and the teacher was Akshobhya. The tantras of the qualities of enlightenment were taught in Ratnapurna by the teacher Ratnasambhava. The tantras of enlightened activity were taught in Sukarmasiddhi by Amoghasiddhi. The retinues consisted of countless buddhas, bodhisattvas, gatherings of dakinis, and others. Moreover, the teachings given by these five teachers in these five pure realms came about through the display of the single wholly positive state, Samantabhadra, the embodiment of which is the heruka Vajradhara; they manifested in these ways according to tl1e requirements of specific situations. Similarly, abodes such as \"the bhaga of the vajra queen\" have the same nature as Akanishtha and these other realms. These, then, are the teachers and the abodes of the sambhogakaya teachings. Regarding the nirmanakaya teachings, in separate locations the tran-scendent and accomplished conqueror Shakyamuni communicated these teachings in the midst of a retinue, his enlightened speech manifesting with sixty melodious qualities .... The following are examples of the Buddha's words that came about through blessings: 1. The Buddha's words tllat came about through the blessings of en-lightened form, as when the Buddha placed his hand on the head of Vajragarbha and blessed him, so that Vajragarbha had the confidence to explain the sutra The Ten Spiritual Levels as a discourse in response to a request by Vimuktachandra. 2.

The Explanatory Essays states: Through the blessings of this Teacher, teachings came even from birds, pieces of wood, pebbles, lotuses, wish-granting trees, and powerful drums. Because they arose from the blessings of the Victorious One, these teachings are held to be \"the Buddha's words.\" According to Aralli: Although they came from mountains, pebbles, pieces of wood, lotuses, wish-granting trees, and powerful drums, because they arose from the blessings of the Victorious One, these teachings are held to be \"the Buddha's words.\" Similarly, teachings given by any shravakas who were moved to speak by the Buddha's blessings, and those given by men, women, boys, girls, and others who were influenced by the Buddha's supreme enlightened ac-tivity, were all included in the Buddha's words as well. The Compendium states: Whatever teachings were given by any shravakas who were followers of the Victorious One-teachings that were explained and expressed with understanding and then gave rise to sublime and exalted bliss and the attainment of their fruition-they all came about through the influence of the spiritual being, the Tathagata. Why, you ask? Because whatever the methods taught by the Victorious One, the excellent people who were his students first trained in them and, having gained direct experience, instructed others in such training, just as the Buddha intended.

They are, moreover, devoid of the six flaws found in non-Buddhist treatises and have three qualities that are characteristically Buddhist. The Definitive Conclusion on the Levels of Realization Resulting from Hearing Teachings states: Neither meaningless nor erroneous, but endowed with meaning; neither merely theoretical nor contentious, but concerned with spiritual practice; advocating neither deceit nor lack of compassion, but the elimination of suffering: Buddhist shastras are held to be devoid of these six flaws and to have these three positive qualities. To elaborate, treatises that are not ultimately meaningful are works like the four Vedas. Treatises that are erroneous maintain that freedom can be attained through such philosophical views as realism and nihilism. Treatises that are merely theoretical are works on poetics and the like. Those that are contentious are works of logic and so forth. Those that ad-vocate deceit are works on military strategy and related subjects. Treatises that advocate a lack of compassion are those that profess, for example, that the sacrifice of cattle is spiritual practice, and thus are harmful to oneself and others. Treatises found in Buddhist traditions are devoid of these six negative qualities and instead have three positive ones, for they discuss the important topic of bringing about happiness in the short term and freedom ultimately, as well as the attainment of enlightenment and the complete elimination of the suffering of samsara.

It is called \"naturally present\" because it manifests effortlessly in the percep-tions of all who experience it; it is not, however, considered \"awareness's own manifestation,\" being rather a state that manifests in response to other beings' perceptions. This realm, which consists of light, is accessible to spiritually advanced bodhisattvas and to highly realized yogins of the Vajrayana approach. It is above the seventeenth, and highest, level of the realm of form in samsara, and so is often grouped with the form realm (and referred to as \"Akanishtha in the realm of form\"), but in fact is not considered to be part of samsara. It is often mistaken for the Akanishtha that is the fifth of the five immaculate abodes of the form realm within samsara (and thus the highest of the seventeen levels of the form realm). However, as Longchenpa notes in The Dragon's Roar of Pure MelodY: An Overview of the Significance of the Mantra Approach, the latter Akanishtha cannot be the one intended in this case, because according to this in-terpretation one cannot awaken to buddhahood within samsara. Even though Shakyamuni awakened to buddhahood at Bodh Gaya, the actual site, known as Bodhimanda, which is much subtler, is not considered to be part of samsara. And, of course, Longchenpa states that in awakening to buddhahood at Bodh Gaya, Shakyamuni did so only \"in the manner of one awakening\" (i.e., he seemed to undergo a process of awakening in order to provide others with an example, not because he himself needed to undergo it).

Prime among the audience of thousands of bodhisattvas and celestial beings was King Sucandra of Shambhala, a fabulous kingdom some-where on this earth where the Kalacakra teachings were held and propagated until their appearance in India in the tenth or eleventh century C.E. \"Sucandra, a manifestation of the bodhisattva Vajrapii.I;!i, retumed to Sharnbhala and wrote down the teachings in twelve thousand verses. This was the Root Kalacakra Tantra and was known as the Supreme Original Buddha. From then on he taught the tantra to the inhabitants of Shambhala until his death.

Perhaps the most famous example of its use was when Darma Dode, son of the Kagyu master Marpa the Translator, was fatally injured by falling from his horse. Marpa revived his dying son and taught him this method, whereby Darma Dode was able to transfer his consciousness into the body of a dead pigeon that flew to India and then was reborn as the master Tepupa, who taught Milarepa's student Rechungpa. 78 That is, Atisa. 79 The Five Principles of Mahamudra are the motivation of bodhicitta, deity yoga, devotion, meditation on the nature of mind, and dedication of the virtue of one's spiritual practice to the benefit of all beings. 80 A variant name for Niguma. 81 That is, physical, verbal, and mental. 82 This is a line from the Heart Sutra. 83 \"Sanskrit vowels and consonants\" and \"inconceivable secret means\" are possibly references to texts bearing those titles. 84 This is the period when Buddhism first came from India to Tibet, beginning with the reign of the legendary first king of Tibet, Nyatri Tsenpo, and ending in the mid ninth century when Langdarma attempted to eradicate Buddhism. 85 sGyu 'phrul drwa ba'i lam mampar bshadpa chung ngu, vol. 1, pp. 1-15. 86 Man ngag Ita ba'iphreng ba, vol. 1, pp. 17-27. 87 That is, Guru Rinpoche Padmakara. 88 Man ngag Ita ba'i phreng ba'i tshig don gyi 'grel zin mdor bsdus pa zab don pad tshal 'byedpa'i nyi 'od, vol. 1, pp. 29-84. 89 Ma mo gsang ba las kyi thig le, vol. 1, pp. 85-94. 90 That is, Longchenpa. dPal rdo rje sems dpa' sgyu 'phrul drwa ba'i grol byed lam gyi snying po'i don khrid, vol. 1, pp. 95-104."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"NOTES 199 91 bDe ba gsa! mdzad kyi mal 'byor bzhi rim.

These are distinct ways in which authentic transmission of teachings can take place. The first is (1) extensive historical transmissions from one generation of living master to the next generation (Tib. ring brgyud bka' ma). Hidden treasure teachings (Tib. gter ma) are conceale~d under various authentic conditions and revealed later (often centuries later) under equally authentic con-ditions. These are further classified as (2) treasures of earth (Tib. sa gter), which are physical texts or objects; (3) treasures of enlightened intent (Tib. dgongs gter), which are \"concealed\" as latent memories within the mental continuum of an individual and then revealed to that continuum in a future lifetime; and ( 4) re-concealed treasures (Tib. yang gter), which are revealed but then reconcealed to be revealed a second time. The others are (5) orally transmitted lineages (Tib. snyan brgyud) that originate with the oral teachings of an enlightened master or mahasiddha;(6) transmissions received in pure visions (Tib. dag snang) of deities or masters in the past manifesting in forms that are embodiments of their time-less awareness (Tib. ye shes kyi sku); and (7) recollections of past events, such as occasions in a previous lifetime in which teachings were received and are then \"remembered\" in a future lifetime. 509 Grub chen zhi ba sbas pa'i thugs bcud bka' babs bdun !dan gyi gzhung rdo rje'i lam bzang po, vol. 17, pp. 207-18. 510 bKa' babs drug !dan gyi 'khridyig 'phags yulgrub pa'i zhallung, vol. 17, pp. 219-95. 511 bKa' babs drug !dan gyi zab khrid brgyudpa'i gsol 'debs mu tigphreng ba, vol. 17, pp. 297-301."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"224 THE CATALOG 512 bCud len gyi gdams pa rim pa lnga pa, vol. 17, pp. 303-9. 513 Chu'i bcud len gyi gdams pa 'chi med rig 'dzin sgrub pa'i chu rgyun, vol. 17, pp. 311-18. 514 sNyan brgyud rde'u bcud len dang me tog bcud len gyi 'don khrid sbrags ma, vol. 17, pp. 319-29. 515 The formal authorization for the white Amitayus is found in vol. 18, pp. 331-34. 516 Tshe sgrub zhag bdun ma'i nyams len gyi rim pa 'chi med bdud rtsi'i bcud len, vol. 17, pp. 331-36.
