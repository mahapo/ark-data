GUENTHER (1917-2006) and his wife and life-time academic collaborator Dr. Ilse GUENTHER (née ROSSRUCKER). Their groundbreaking translations of Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen's magnum opus, The Jewel Ornament of Liberation, made this founda-tional text available to non-Tibetan audiences for the first time with Herbert GUENTHER's English translation in 1959, followed by Ilse and Herbert GUENTHER's German transla-tion in 1989. Their precious efforts and trail blazing intel-lectual work – always in \"engagement with what matters\" – have thrown open so many opportunities for subsequent generations of gnosis seekers for the study of and direct encounter with the deep cultures of the Far East. The present book, which in some sense began long ago with a lama's advice to read The Jewel Ornament, is but one minor ripple effect of their work in the endless sea of wholeness.

My original interest in Bsod nams rin chen's meditative instructions was aroused in 1995-1997, when I during four longer periods worked in Hong Kong as a Tibetan-English interpreter for a Tibetan Rinpoche of the Karma Bka' brgyud tradition. The subject of his lectures was a complete reading of one of the most systematic Tibetan texts on Mahāmudrā, the large treatise entitled \"The Moonlight Exposition Elucidating the Stages of Mahāmudrā Meditation\" (Phyag chen zla ba'i 'od zer). The text was composed in the sixteenth century by Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal, who served as the seventeenth abbot of the Tibetan monastery Dags lha sgam po. The monastery originated in the twelfth century as a small hermitage for anchorites founded by Bsod nams rin chen. Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal composed his Mahāmudrā treatise some fifty years after the previous abbot, Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub, in 1520 had published the first-ever printed version of a large collection of texts known as The Manifold Sayings of Dags po (Dags po'i bka' 'bum). The xylograph print contains forty texts, most of which are associated with Bsod nams rin chen and his main students. In his Mahāmudrā treatise, Bkra shis rnam rgyal relied heavily on the works of The Manifold Sayings as authoritative sources for his Mahāmudrā explanations. Indeed, he might have intended his text primarily as being a thorough exposition of these medieval writings aimed in part at promoting Bsod nams rin chen's meditation doctrine while indirectly intending to bolster the prestigious heritage of his hermitage-monastery. With Bkra shis rnam rgyal's large Mahāmudrā treatise, the newly printed works of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum gained importance for later Tibetan scholars, yogīs, and meditation masters, leading to the popularity of some of these texts in modern Tibetan Buddhism. Through my Hong Kong translation work and exchange with a living master of the Bka' brgyud Mahāmudrā lineage combined with our reading of Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal's Tibetan text, I became fascinated with the Mahāmudrā system of meditation and formed a wish to research its place in Tibetan Buddhism. This quickly brought me back to its roots, the teachings of Bsod nams rin chen and the Dags po'i bka' 'bum corpus. Discovering how little had actually been written on this Tibetan doctrine, I decided to make it the subject of my magisterial thesis entitled Culture and Subculture – A Study of the Mahāmudrā Teachings of Sgam po pa, which was submitted to the University of Copenhagen for a Master's degree in Tibetan studies in 1998. Some smaller parts of the present book constitute the revised publication of the thesis. For guidance and help in writing the original MA thesis, I express my sincere thanks to my MA advisor at the University of Copenhagen, Cand.Mag. Flemming FABER, and my"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" degree examiner from the University of Oslo, Prof. Dr. Per KVÆRNE. Being the first broader study of Bsod nams rin chen and his writings, the thesis subsequently aroused some interest in academic circles. Several eminent scholars read the thesis after its submission and gave me valuable feedback, including Hartmut BUESCHER, Franz-Karl EHRHARD, Georges B. DREYFUS, Roger R. JACKSON, Dan MARTIN, John NEWMAN, and E. Gene SMITH. I wish to express my deep appreciation to them. Moreover, I thank Khenpo Chödrak Tenphel, then resident professor at my Indian alma mater where I studied over a nine-year period 1990-1999, the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi. Further, words of gratitude should be given to my dear friend, the yogī Krzysztof LEBRECHT, for his financial support for two research travels to India during the thesis writing. The present book also incorporates many later materials researched and written during my three-year post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard University, in the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies, throughout the period 2004-2007. The stay at Harvard was made possible by three consecutive research grants from the Danish Carlsberg Foundation (grant numbers ANS 1365‐2004 and 04‐007120). During that time, my study was focused on the early hagiographies of Bsod nams rin chen, the textual transmission history of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, and especially on five collections of lectures that Bsod nams rin chen is said to have given orally at his hermitage, namely the so-called \"Teachings to the Gathering\" texts (tshogs chos). My work on the early Sgam po pa hagiographies is now included in Part II of the present book, while my overall study of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum is found in the book's Part III. The translation work of the tshogs chos texts that I began while at Harvard still awaits publication in a future monograph. For my Harvard fellowship, I am deeply thankful to Professor Dr. Leonard W.J. VAN DER KUIJP, Chair of the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies, who made my stay at the department possible and whose immense erudition in all things Tibetan was and still is a constant source of learning for me. I also wish to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Dr. Janet GYATSO of Harvard Divinity School, who gave me much feedback in my research and whose penetrating analytic skills have been a source of great inspiration. Moreover, Professor Dr. Laura S. NASRALLAH, likewise of Harvard Divinity School, fundamentally transformed my methodological awareness. To these three brilliant minds, I dedicate the book's theoretical preamble. Further work on the book manuscript was carried out in 2008-2010 while I served as a research professor and head of a newly established team for Tibetan research at the Geumgang Center for Buddhist Studies (GCBS) of Geumgang University in South Korea. The work was made possible by the Center's funding from the Korean National Research Foundation (MEST, KRF-2007-361-AM0046). I sincerely thank my former colleagues at GCBS for their kindness and warm support. Particular thanks should here be given to Professor Dr. Sungdoo AHN, Professor Dr. Changhwan PARK, and Professor Dr. Sangyeob CHA, who all in various ways supported me in my efforts to produce this book."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Later revisions and additions were made during my stay in 2011-2013 as a research fellow at the International Institute for Asian Studies (IIAS) at Leiden University, as well as during my visiting Lectureship in Sanskrit, Buddhist, and Asian Studies in 2014-2015 at the University of Sydney, and during an Endeavour Research fellowship in 2015 at the Australian National University (ANU).

Dakla Gampo. Since the twelfth century, the mountain has been home to a hermitage for meditators. The founder of the site and its long lineage of Tibetan mystics was the medieval Buddhist monk Gampopa Sönam Rinchen (1079-1153). Sönam Rinchen took ordination in his early twenties and spent several years learning from some of the leading Buddhist scholar monks and lay yogīs of his day. Thereupon, he went into a decade-long solitary meditation retreat, dwelling in rocky caves and self-made meditation huts in uninhabited places. At the age of forty two, he took up residence on Mt. Dakla Gampo to live in a life-long retreat in the wasteland solitude. Soon a small community of fellow yogī meditators began to assemble around him in order to train in Tantric yogas and Mahāmudrā meditation under his skilled guidance and mentoring. Having taught many trainees for over thirty years, Sönam Rinchen finally passed away on the mountain. The best of his students went on to found the different chapters of the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism that today is known as the Kagyü school, name of which means \"the transmission of the instruction lineages\". A number of his followers wrote down teachings that they had received orally from Sönam Rinchen and gradually these notes, writings, and texts were compiled into a large written corpus called The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo (Dakpö Kabum). It is from the roots of these medieval texts – originating in the twelfth century – that a massive trunk of meditative instructions, radiating branches of inner yoga techniques, and vitalizing leaves of unique mystical terminology grew into a giant tree in the Himalayan wilderness of Tibetan mysticism. Nevertheless, nowadays, the non-Tibetan audience invariably conceives of Gampopa Sönam Rinchen, commonly called 'Gampopa', as being a rather dry monastic figure associated exclusively with a single literary work, namely a large scholastic treatise on Mahāyāna Buddhism in English called The Jewel Ornament of Liberation and in Tibetan referred to in shorthand as the Dakpo Targyen. The misperception has over the last half-century been reinforced by the repeated Western translations exclusively of this particular text. The replicated image is not only skewed but is fraught with factual and representa-tional problems. In terms of authorship, it is very unlikely that The Jewel Ornament was ever composed by Sönam Rinchen, given that it markedly differs in style and contents from the rest of The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo and bears all the hallmarks of being a much later work. More importantly, the notion misrepresents Gampopa and the larger written tradition associated with him as being scholastic rather than experiential in nature. When the focus is repositioned to the other 82% of The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo, an earlier textual layer comes into view, revealing traces of a large contemplative community of medieval yogī renunciates earnestly devoted to practicing yoga and meditating in the mountain wilderness."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 20 In view thereof, the intellectual aims of this book are threefold. The first aim is to effect a contradistinctive fusion of horizons by reenvisioning and reclaiming Gampopa as a mystic and innovator. The second aim is to shift the ontology of the text by severing The Manifold Sayings from authorial intentionalism. The third aim is to propose a neostructur-alist reading by disassembling the textual corpus into its smallest interpretive units and begin to determine their meaning-producing interrelations. These three aims will be addressed respectively by the three parts of the book. The historical distance between the reader and the discourse of a text requires a fusion of horizons in the act of reading, constituting what Hans-Georg GADAMER (1992:301-302) has termed \"the hermeneutical situation.\" The reader's standpoint is the horizon of a consciousness that is affected and delimited by history. The text's standpoint is the horizon of its discourse. Meaning is acquired by the fusion of these horizons: the reader as the discursive agent interacts with the signifiers of the text as the discursive object to construe what comes to be signified by the discourse. Signification is thus created anew in each hermeneutical situation. Given that the reader's interpretive horizon is a historically affected consciousness, the present book's project of examining The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo is a hermeneutical situation that always remains prefigured by the historically embedded scholarly, religious, and popular notions of 'Gampopa' as the author and ultimate source of these written works. For a textual reading, it is fundamentally impossible to exit this interpretive circumstance and to acquire a form of consciousness that is wholly objective and uncolored by pre-existing notions. Accordingly, the first task at hand when embarking on a new reading of Gampopa Sönam Rinchen and The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo is not to refute or deny the existing state of the art by dispelling the prevailing opinions. Rather, it is to transform the situation by introducing contradistinctive notions, which can enlarge the interpretive scope sufficiently to allow for an advanced reading of the text, in turn leading to new signification. The needed displacement of notions is to be achieved in the book's Part I, wherein the author Gampopa shall be reenvisioned and reclaimed as a mystic and innovator. In the current study, the term 'mysticism' is to be understood in a very specific sense. It denotes a contemplative system that in its core is non-ritualistic and not concerned with form. As such, this sets it apart from meditation techniques involving elaborate outer rituals and extensive inner visualization techniques. Furthermore, it separates it from types of mysticism built on visions, prophecy, ecstasy, spirit possession, and speaking in tongues. With this specific signification in mind, the present narrow use of the term fulfills most but not all of the twelve general characteristics of mystical experience posited by Reinhard MARGREITER (1997). In essence, mysticism is here used narrowly as referring to meditative absorption in non-conceptuality. The Tibetan word employed in The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo for such absorption is Chakgya Chenpo. The phrase, which literally means \"the great seal,\" is the Tibetan replication of the well-known Indian Sanskrit term Mahāmudrā. Mahāmudrā, viewed as a unique form of Tibetan mysticism, has been chosen as the focal point for the book's first part in order to confront the reader with a representation of Gampopa that differs from the scholastic image of a Mahāyāna author. The portrayal"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 21adduced in Chapter One is that of Gampopa as a mystic, namely as a meditation master whose prime occupation was the development of a Tibetan contemplative system. The chapter provides an anthology of Mahāmudrā passages in Tibetan and English translation concerned with Gampopa's approach to mysticism in theory and practice as reflected in writings by his closest students. These passages from primary sources are intended to augment the hermeneutical situation by introducing parts of The Manifold Sayings other than The Jewel Ornament. Though various forms of Indian and Tibetan Mahāmudrā have already received several academic and popular treatments in the past decades, the Mahāmudrā segments of The Manifold Sayings stand out as being of particular historical importance, because they are the earliest substantive Tibetan Mahāmudrā writings. On the one hand, these texts postdate the phase of late Indian Buddhism, given that Gampopa detached Mahāmudrā from its traditional Indian Tantric context of ritual, visualization, and sexuality. On the other hand, they predate the later Tibetan phenomenon of the Mahāyānization of Mahāmudrā in the fifteenth-seventeenth centuries, when Tibetan Buddhist writers apologetically retrofitted Tibetan Mahāmudrā mysticism with the classical Indian contemplative categories of tranquility and insight meditation, named shinä – lhaktong or śamatha – vipaśyanā. Hence, a study of the Mahāmudrā passages in The Manifold Sayings is essential for discerning originality and innovation in Tibetan mysticism and for setting a hermeneutical beginning from which the Tibetan mystical terminology can be researched through etymology and philology. Moving now to a slightly deeper theoretical level, it is to be observed that 'originality' and 'innovation', in point of fact, are highly precarious notions in classical and medieval Asian Studies. The truth of the matter is that the historicist approach, which is the implicit constant in virtually all textual, literary, and philological study in the modern humanities, intrinsically necessitates a search for origins. The chief governing principle of the histori-cist project is the placing of its object of study in historical time, whereby the object's ascribed value becomes secularized. Resultantly, the historicist configuration of time is a verbalization of the object's past until the point of its origin, located either in a concrete historical event or in the initial inception in the history of an idea. It is this construction of the past that renders the humanities' objects of study relevant to the hermeneutical situation of the present, thereby creating what François HARTOG (2003) has called \"the regimes of historicity.\" Through the circular mechanism of placing the past in the present, which has been acutely described by Jörn RÜSEN (2013), the humanities fulfill their academic and social purpose of knowledge production (Sinnbildung) of the past within the hermeneutical situation of the formation and education of the modern individual's cultural identity (Bildung) within the nation state. The book at hand is no exception to this rule, for it too is a reflection of the commonplace academic search for meaning in the conception of the past as 'origin' and 'history'. Without reservation, the very reason for the selection of The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo as the book's object of study lies precisely in the philological value of this corpus for understanding the beginnings of Tibetan mysticism."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 22 Edward W. SAID (1983:127) once remarked that \"the theoretical level of investigation is connected historically in the West to a notion of originality.\" Ergo, the intellectual significance which in the humanities is attributed to originality and innovation (Greek: kainotēs) is generally linked to the social value that overall is ascribed to these notions in the predominantly Eurocentric condition of modernity. In this cultural modality, originality and innovation are commonly regarded as the telltale signs of creativity and progress in the arts, industry, and technology. Conversely, cultural and epistemic preservation, transmis-sion, and reproduction are less appraised, being either merely of antiquarian concern for cultural heritage or demoted to outright negative connotations of appropriation, plagiarism, and kitsch. The inbuilt Eurocentricity of the academic search for originality, which dictates the historicist investigation undertaken also in the present monograph, has to be kept firmly in mind, because the book's object of study hails from a very different epistēmē governed by entirely other values. The cultural encounter of this hermeneutical situation demands a very challenging fusion of interpretive horizons between the humanist academic horizon of the reader and the discursive horizon of its object of study that in both place and time lies well outside the Eurocentric vantage point. Regarding place, as has been discussed at length by Elías J. PALTI (2006), ideas become misplaced when the scholarly focus moves away from the traditional dominant places of the humanities and social sciences, namely the cultural-economic core of Europe and North America, and instead becomes engaged with 'non-places' along the culturally-economically dependent periphery. Hence, speaking of 'originality' and 'innovation' in connection with Asian Studies in general and Tibetan Studies in particular proves problematic, because the altered context of the Oriental 'Other' constitutes an entirely different hermeneutical situation, which brings unforeseen meanings and values of the terms into play. Regarding time, the present object of study belongs to the Middle Ages, an epoch with a mindset so entirely different from the interpretive horizon of the modern reader. Accord-ingly, as argued by Gabrielle M. SPIEGEL (1990), a proper historically informed reading needs to be firmly grounded directly in the social logic of the text. Verily, when the notions of 'originality' and 'innovation' are considered from within the epistēmē of twelfth-century Tibet, it comes to fore that these terms were looked upon with great suspicion as hetero-doxy of grave soteriological consequence. In the classicism of the day, precisely the inverse epistemic values were considered the virtues of highest genius. Exact and unaltered memorization, reproduction, and transmission were not thought of as stagnant and plagiarist, but were deemed essential for preserving the Buddha's teachings in their pure Indian form. Oppositely, any attempt to innovate had to be carefully disguised by couching new creative expressions in traditional frameworks of classical terminology, scriptural quotation, and the authority of an Indian guru lineage. The issues at stake turn up in Chapter Two of the book, when the reception history of Gampopa's Mahāmudrā system is investigated. It is revealed how some later Tibetan authors criticized Gampopa's brand of mysticism for not being in line with the orthodox"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 23Indian Mahāmudrā tradition. While the critique underscores the originality found in The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo and their consequent worth for the humanist study of the beginnings of Tibetan mysticism, it is also a reminder to the reader that the texts at hand need to be read with assiduous attention to their own social logic and epistemic values. In conjunction, the two chapters of the book's Part I bring together a series of inescapable considerations needed when entering into a new reading of The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo. In Part II, the book embarks on accomplishing its second aim: to shift the ontology of the text by severing The Manifold Sayings from authorial intentionalism. The ontology of the text denotes the text's mode of being, namely its presence as an object of knowledge. Given that the text only acquires meaning as a text within the hermeneutical situation, its ontology is constituted as an inseverable part of this epistemic event. To highlight how the object of knowledge's ontology is contingent on its appearance and representation to the intentionality of the knowing subject, GADAMER (1992:115) argued that the mode of being of a work is linked with its presentation (Darstellung). That is to say, the text's ontology is substantiated and embodied in the presentation of its lay-out and typography, which are matters of textual production. In an earlier study (KRAGH, 2013c), it has been demonstrated how certain changes in text design, which were introduced when The Manifold Sayings were printed for the first time in 1520, created the impression that the entire oeuvre was composed by Gampopa, whereas no such general authorship claim is attested in the older handwritten manuscript recension. The altered presentation ontologizes the text within a new superstructure of authorial unity, easily leading to the fallacy of authorial intentionalism. From a methodological perspective, the supposition of singular authorship calls for unwarranted comparison, erroneously suggesting that it is possible to assess the author's intention in lesser known parts of the collection by adopting a well-known work, like The Jewel Ornament, as a yardstick. This type of thinking inserts the notion of the 'design' or 'intention' of the author into the hermeneutical situation, which – as argued by William K. WIMSATT JR. and Monroe C. BEARDSLEY (1946:468) – \"is neither available nor desirable as a standard.\" Comparison between individual parts of the corpus is only sensible when it is recognized that The Manifold Sayings consist of numerous heterogeneous segments composed by a number of anonymous or little known authors from the broader Dakpo community, of whom some were students of Gampopa and others belonged to later generations. Direct evidence of writing by many hands is found throughout the collection and any impression of complete authorial unity is simply a false consciousness spawned by late editorial modifications in the presentation of the corpus. Yet, even when vigilant scholarly attention is paid to the composite constitution of the corpus as a poly-authored work, the authorial icon of Gampopa remains lightly hovering above the hermeneutical situation. A relatively unwrought figure of Gampopa features in much – albeit not all – of the corpus, because many written passages are ascribed to Gampopa as representing his spoken word. A large number of segments commence with phrases declaring \"the teacher says...\" or \"again the Dharma master Gampopa says...,\" and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 24 long passages are bracketed within Tibetan quotation markers. Moreover, some portions give shape to Gampopa as a concrete character by providing hagiographical accounts of his religious life, which ties The Manifold Sayings in with the larger Tibetan tradition of Gampopa narratives found elsewhere in later religious annals, eulogies, and lineage histories of the Kagyü school. From within the Tibetan tradition, it is these literary collages of Gampopa that define and delimit the reception-historically affected consciousness of the reader. Highlighting this issue, Chapter Three presents a study of the hagiographical tradition portraying Gampopa. Special attention is given to the earliest hagiographical records, being the works that exhibit the most divergent and contradictory accounts. The intended outcome is awareness of the fact that the representation of Gampopa on the whole is a narrative construct that has been forged over the course of many centuries. This discern-ment aims to shift the ontology of the text, perhaps not entirely blotting out the authorial figure of Gampopa as an interpretive element in the reading but at least allowing for an improved hermeneutical situation, wherein the image can be cautiously appraised through understanding its effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte). With the critical hermeneutical perspectives uncovered in the book's Parts I-II in place, the aim of Part III is to establish a new reading strategy for textual corpora (Tibetan: bka' 'bum), applicable to The Manifold Sayings, building the foundation for what forthwith may be referred to as a neostructuralist methodology for discourse analysis. Part III begins with Chapter Four, wherein the reading of the corpus is prepared by first introducing the religious historical context of the early Dakpo community, thus opening to view a social logic of the medieval text. The chapter then surveys all the manuscripts, prints, and editions of the corpus, drawing attention to the presentation (Darstellung) of each recension, which is significant for hermeneutically apprehending the ontology of the text through the course of its reception history. Finally, the very substantial Chapter Five embarks on the actual neostructuralist reading of the corpus in its entirety on the basis of the standard edition of the forty works found in the first printed version of The Manifold Sayings of 1520. The proposed neostructualist method is theoretically underpinned by the semiology of Ferdinand de SAUSSURE. In his linguistic examination of meaning-formation, SAUSSURE (1916:166) arrived at a sophisticated view of language as a system of arbitrary signs entailing no intrinsically positive terms, wherein signification exclusively emanates from the structural differences between them. Accordingly, the meaning of a given word or utter-ance is regarded as not arising from the word or utterance itself but only through its thetical relations to allied words and antithetical differences to opposing expressions in the particular linguistic context. To adopt these structuralist principles in a reading strategy for an entire discourse, it becomes necessary to operate with larger analytical units than the individual linguistic signs treated by SAUSSURE. One of the most influential attempts at doing so has been the structuralist study of myth advanced by Claude LÉVI-STRAUSS. In the method of LÉVI-STRAUSS (1955:431), a myth would be broken down to a sequence of shortest possible sentences, which could be employed as the constituent units of a structuralist analysis."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 25Examining the meaning-producing bundles of relations between the derived sentences, LÉVI-STRAUSS especially focused on pairs of binary opposites, such as the raw and the cooked, in order to arrive at generic conceptual dichotomies in kinship, social relationships, and culture that would be applicable for a general theory of structuralist anthropology. While the present neostructualist approach shares LÉVI-STRAUSS' objective of applying fundamental semiological principles to a higher level of discourse analysis, the reductionist aspect of his method needs to be avoided, because it involves a degree of generalization that is unsuitable for a close reading of rigorous textual scholarship. Consequently, instead of using individual linguistic signs or simplified sentences as the constituent units of the analysis, the reading presented here will center on unabridged segments of discourse, which aggregate to form a textual corpus in its entirety, resulting in a true bricolage of meaning-bearing relations. As with all structuralist analysis, the study of these segments operates along two juxtaposed dimensions of the relations to be examined: the synchronic and the diachronic. The synchronic dimension denotes relations that can be posited between the constituent textual segments across the corpus within a given recension of the text. These relations can either be in the modality of metaphoric part-part relationships between individual segments or in the modality of synecdochic part-whole relationships between a given segment and the corpus as a text in its totality. In the case of The Manifold Sayings, the segments that serve as the constituent units for the analysis are embedded directly in the text. In the standard printed edition, the corpus is arranged into forty works, which in turn are divided into 444 separate passages that in nearly every case is explicitly demarcated by means of special opening and closing markers. Chapter Five clearly defines the exact starting and ending point of each segment, summarizes their contents, and notes a large number of synchronic relations between the segments. These synchronic cross-references of termi-nology, yoga and meditation instructions, mystical doctrines, literary writing styles, citation patterns, and many other issues of textual production combine to create an extensive conceptual lattice that may serve as an intertextual ground for all further investigation of meanings in the corpus. The diachronic dimension signifies relations that are historically predicated in terms of the text's redaction history. The traditional starting point for diachronic analysis in the humanist traditions of textual scholarship is the earliest possible version of the text, whence a progressive historical explanation can be formulated. That approach, however, entails a deep seated anachronistic fallacy of prefigured historical beginnings, where the existence of a later phenomenon chosen as the object of study – whether it be a nation state, an institution, a religious tradition, or simply a text – is conceived of as having its birth in an earlier era during which the phenomenon as such was not yet found. For example, the early Dakpo religious community may be viewed as the historical beginning of the Kagyü school of Tibetan Buddhism, but as a matter of fact the school label Kagyü is virtually absent throughout The Manifold Sayings, suggesting a time when this sectarian brand was not yet part of the community's self-image."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 26 In consequence, for the neostructuralist method proposed here, the diachronic analysis shall adhere to the principle that history should be written forwards but read backwards. Such a retrogressive approach may be illustrated by the ingenious three-volume history of Indonesia by Denys LOMBARD entitled Le carrefour javanais: essai d'histoire globale (1990). LOMBARD has written each volume forwards in time, but as a whole the volumes cover a retrogressive series of topics, with the first tome presenting modern Indonesia's colonial and post-colonial history, the second tome uncovering the preceding Islamic and Chinese civilizational layers of the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, and the third tome excavating the underlying stratum of Indian-imported Javanese heritage from the fifth till the fourteenth centuries. Using a retrogressive outlook prevents predetermining the writing of a history by setting its point of departure in the inception of a later phenomenon. Instead, the outlook engages in an open-ended investigative search for prior events that need not necessarily be viewed as inaugural. In line with this principle, the reading presented in the present book's Chapter Five is predicated not on the earliest version of The Manifold Sayings but on the later standard printed edition of the corpus. By providing exhaustive references to parallel texts of each segment in earlier and later editions, the reading lays a firm ground for further retrogressive study of the corpus in its antecedent writing and compilation history. What though quickly becomes evident in the book's implementation of its neostruc-turalist method is that the adoption of entire textual segments as the constituent units for the analysis radically destabilizes meaning. The meaning-forming relations that can be found between long segments of discourse are of such immense complexity that any reductionist abstraction into simple binary opposites, as done by LÉVI-STRAUSS, is altogether inapplicable. All in all, the horizon of the semantic field, which emanates from a system of virtually endless possible relations between its substantial constituent parts, is boundless. Nonetheless, the reading of concrete, stable meanings in the text remains attainable, because a delimited interpretive reflection materializes in the specific hermeneutical situation that is brought about by the fusion of the infinite semantic horizon of the text and the finite interpretive horizon of the reader. Drawing on Martin HEIDEGGER's Sein und Zeit, GADAMER (1992:266-267) reasoned that interpretive reflection operates in a repeated circular mode. When the interpreter looks at \"the things themselves\" in the text and becomes aware of the subtle interpretive fore-projections originating in him- or herself, new meaning can be penetrated in the text. These meanings hold an ontologically positive significance for refiguring the interpreter's fore-projections, thereby enabling another reading capable of finding new meanings in the text. The present study of The Manifold Sayings of Dakpo intertwines three such hermeneu-tical circles, each of which exerts an ontologically positive effect of its own. The first circle of reenvisioning and reclaiming Gampopa as a mystic and innovator in Part I clears the semantic field of shallow fore-structures (Vor-strukturen) erected in the courte durée by restrictive closures in the history of research. This circle repositions The Manifold Sayings as an object of knowledge for the study of yoga and mysticism. The second circle of severing The Manifold Sayings from authorial intentionalism in Part II decenters the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Theoretical Preamble 27semantic field of deep fore-structures built up in the longue durée of the Tibetan hagiographical tradition of a religious founder. This circle reorients the sayings as an object of knowledge for the study of an entire community of religious writers. The third circle of presenting a neostructuralist reading of the corpus in Part III spreads out the semantic field by forming a new fore-structure of both synchronic and diachronic dimensions. This circle reconstitutes The Manifold Sayings as an object of knowledge for the study of text. In unison, the turnings of these three hermeneutical circles will lift up the reader's gaze from the scholastic textual production of the medieval Buddhist seminaries seated at the floor of Himalayan valleys up to the discourses spoken in the simple hermitages of Tibetan mystics and yoga practitioners nestled high in the mountains.

Bsod nams rin chen 's Shortcut to Instant Awakening The special contribution by the Buddhist monk (dge slang, bhik�u) Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (1079-1153 CE)' to the Tibetan Bka' brgyud traditions has in Tibetan works often been characteri zed as consisting in a special teaching-style that combined doctrinal Bka' gdams pa teachings on the stages of the Mahiiyiina path with a particular meditative system known as *Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po, or in brief phyag chen).2 Thus, Bsod nams rin chen is said to have \"merged the two streams of Bka' gdams pa and Mahamudrii\" (bka' phyag elm bo gnyis 'dres). This signature phrase, which is used to captivate the particular style of teaching for which Bsod nams rin chen became so renowned, occurs in several later Tibetan works.3 In general, the word Mahamudrii, literally meaning \"great (mahii) seal (mudrii),\" is a term used in some of the Indian and Tibetan Tantric literature for the most advanced stage of Buddhist Tantric practice, on which the practitioner realizes full and direct Awakening (byang chub, bodhi). However, in the present context, Mahiimudrii takes on a new and special meaning. In the Tantric teachings, Mahiimudrii designates the meditative practices and experi­ences associated with the final empowerment of the Unparalleled Yogatantra, in Sanskrit called *Anuttarayo gatantra or Yoganiruttarat antra. Bsod nams rin chen is said to have separated Mahiimudrii meditation from its original Tantric setting and to have recontex-1 Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen will henceforth be referred to primarily by his personal monastic name, Bsod nams rin chen, leaving out the epithet Sgam po pa.

Other popular epithets associated with Bsod nams rin chen include Zia 'od gzhon nu (*Candraprabha kumara) meaning \"young man Moonlight\", Dags po Iha rj e \"the doctor from Dags po,\" and Dags po rin po che \"the precious one from Dags po\".

The expression \"Common Maha­yana\" (t heg chen thun mong pa) is a key term used in this book to signify the teachings of the Indian Mahayana Sutras and Sastras, which as a doctrinal system and path to buddha­hood also are labeled the Paramita Vehicle (Piiramitayana, phar phyin theg pa). These teachings are common to all followers of Mahayana Buddhism, as generally found in the various forms of Indian, East Asian, and Tibetan Buddhism. They are doctrinally and prag­matically distinguished from the teachings of the Buddhist Tantras, which theoretically also are subsumed under the Mahayana system but as Tantric methods are not practiced by all Mahayana adherents. Consequently, the Tantric methods are sometimes in Tibetan sources referred to as the \"Uncommon Mahiiyiina\" (theg chen thun mong ma yin pa).4 As attested by the extant textual tradition, Bsod nams rin chen in some instances taught Mahiimudra in a broader context of Common Mahayana teachings and thereby separated these Mahamudra instructions from their original framework of the Tantras. The conse­quence was that Mahiimudra no longer was a doctrine reserved for the initiated practitio­ners of the secret Tantras with their yoga and sexual techniques, but Mahamudra became generally accessible to all followers of the Mahayana, perhaps especially addressed to monks wishing to practice the Tantras without violating their vows of celibacy. With Bsod nams rin chen's conception of such a novel approach to Mahamudra practice, a new and distinct tradition evolved within Tibetan Buddhism. This tradition gradually became known as the Bka' brgyud school and in the course of the following decades and centuries it developed into several Bka' brgyud sub-traditions. Hence, a study of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra teachings and techniques reaches back to some of the most formative years of Tibetan Buddhism in the eleventh and twelfth centuries when the majority of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism were in the process of being founded. The collection of texts that contain Bsod nams rin chen's oral teachings, known in Tibe­tan as the Dags po'i bka' 'bum corpus, definitely includes a series of distinct works, whose focus is on the Mahayana path, Mahiimudra meditation, or a mixture of the two, thereby il­lustrating the kind of \"blending the two streams of Bka' gdams pa and Mahiimudra\" (bka' phyag chu bo gnyis 'dres) that later sources characteristically ascribe to Bsod nams rin chen as the hallmark of his teachings. However, it should be noted that the corpus also includes works that are focused on several other topics, especially on the yoga practices known in later literature as the \"Six Doctrines of Naropa\" (na ro'i chos drug).5 Even so, according to hagiographical sources, it appears that Bsod nams rin chen only taught these higher Tantric yoga techniques to a small number of advanced students. The majority of his disciples were instead taught contemplative theory drawn from Common Mahayana doctrines, as exempli­fied in the texts on Teachings to the Gathering (tshogs chos) or his well-known doctrinal treatise on the stages of the path (lam rim) entitled The Je wel Ornament of Liberation (short 4 The English word \"Tantric\" is here used adjectivally to characterize a person, teaching, or tradi­tion adhering to the Buddhist Tantras and their techniques.

To such doctrinal or theoretical teachings, he then added instruc­tion on practical techniques in the form of Mahiimudrii meditations aimed at instant Awa­kening, being the goal of the Tantras. Bsod nam rin chen's Mahiimudrii method made it possible to leave out the higher stages of the Tantric path, namely the practices of the Six Doctrines of Naropa as well as the more advanced Tantric sexual techniques known as \"the path of means\" (thabs lam, *upiiyamiir­ga),6 which according to the Indian Tantric tradition would normally be required in order to reach full Awakening within a single lifetime, i.e., the Tantras' fourth and final stage known as Mahiimudrii. Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii approach could thus be explained as a Mahiiyiina-based shortcut to the highest Mahiimudrii level of Tantric practice. Later Tibetan sources, such as Sgam po Bkra shis mam rgyal's (1512-1587) Mahiimudrii Moonlight (short title, Phyag chen zla ba'i od zer), referred to Bsod nams rin chen's ap­proach as Slitra Mahiimudrii (mdo'i phyag chen), a term which is, however, not used in�the Dags po'i bka' 'bum itself. The expression Siitra Mahtimudrii implies that Bsod nam rin chen's Mahiimudrii teachings were rooted in the Common Mahiiyiina doctrines, i.e., the Siitras, rather than in the yogic techniques of the Tantras with all their sexual symbolism. The opposite of Slitra Mahiimudrii was by later Tibetan authors labeled Tantra Mahiimudrii (rgyud kyi phyag chen), referring to the traditional Indian form of Mahiimudrii practice that is the culmination of the regular Tantric path.7 It seems that Bsod nams rin chen's perhaps unique Siitra Mahiimudra approach was a novelty in Tibetan Buddhism at the time. In his booklength study of the Bka' brgyud Slitra Mahiimudrti approach and the criticism it provoked from the side of more orthodox fol­lowers of the Indian Tantras within the Tibetan Sa skya tradition, David P. JACKSON (1994: 10) has succinctly characterized Bsod nams rin chen's contribution to this develop­ment in the following words: In the later part of his life, [Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen] gave increasing attention to transmitting directly the highest Great Seal [Mahiimudrii] insight, perhaps in part also as an outgrowth of his own deepened and intensified spiritual insight. What was somewhat revolutionary about the approach sGam-po-pa adopted was that he sought ways to transmit this insight outside of the traditional Mantrayana method, which treated it as an ultima�e and highly secret \"fruit\" instruction to be conveyed only after full, formal Tantric initiation and in connec­tion with special yogic practices. Along the same lines, the fifteenth-century Tibetan religious history The Blue Annals (Deb ther sngon po) has characterized in slightly more detail the manner in which Bsod nams rin chen is said to have circumvented the traditional Tantric approach: 6 Throughout the book, most of the correlated Sanskrit words marked with an asterisk, supplied as possible linguistic correspondences for the pertinent Tibetan word or expression, have been drawn from the Tibetan-Chinese-Sanskrit index of the Indian contemplative treatise YogacarabhUmi com­piled by YOKOYAMA & HIROSAWA (1996). 7 For the term Siitra Mahiimudrii in later Tibetan traditions, see MATHES (2006:201-207)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Essence of Mahiimudrii Concerning that [teaching on Mahiimudrii] , Master Mi la had not given the [Tantric] Path of Means (thabs lam) and the Mahiimudrii [instructions] separately from one another.

He moreover composed a literary treatise on the teaching-stages (bstan rim) of the Bka' gdams pa tradition and also gave much practical advice. He therefore became renowned for having merged the two streams of Bka' gdams pa and Mahiimudrii.8 33 The Blue Annals further illustrate with another story how openly Bsod nams rin chen is thought to have taught MahiJmudrii in comparison to how selectively he is believed to have taught the Tantric methods of the \"Path of Means\" or the \"Method Way\" (thabs lam): In the end, when [Bsod nams rin chen] was passing into Nirvii!Ja in the water­female-hen year [1153 CE], two monks each holding a sacrificial cake (gtor ma, *bali) in their hands approached, calling out: \"We request instruction in the Path of Means, so pray compassionately accept us!\" \"Don't let them come near,\" [Bsod nams rin chen] replied. Then one of his attendants advised them: \"You should call out saying that you are requesting Mahiimudrii!\" Accordingly, those two then called out for a long time: \"But we are requesting Mahiimudrii, sir!\" Thereupon, [Bsod nams rin chen] said, \"Now send them in,\" and he let them in and gave them the instructions of Mahiimudrii. In this way, he emphasized Mahiimudrii in particular from among his teachings.9 It is this particular Mahiimudrii approach expressed in the oral teachings of Bsod nams rin chen that will be briefly outlined in the present chapter. A detailed presentation and defi­nition of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudrii doctrine has so far not been undertaken in Western sources. What is currently available in the form of academic studies are a brief synopsis of Bsod nams rin chen's four stages or yogas of Mahiimudrii (rnal 'byor bzhi) (MARTIN, 1992:250-252), a short discussion of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii doctrine emphasizing how his teachings can be classified and compared with other approaches, particularly those of classical Tantra and the Common Mahayana (JACKSON, 1994:9-37), 8 Th e Blue Annals (CHANDRA, 1974:400; ROERICH, 1949:459-460).

In order first to identify the kind of contemplative approach involved in Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii system, the following pages will offer a brief outline of its philosophical basis, meditational methods, and the result that these methods are intended to produce in the practitioner. These three are in later Tibetan sources respectively referred to as the basis (gzhi), the way (lam), and the result ('bras bu) of Mahiimudrii. To make the treatment as straightforward as possible, the overview will be given in the form of selected quotations of actual passages from the Dags po'i bka' 'bum. The reader should keep in mind that the texts in question are not said to have been written directly by Bsod nams rin chen himself, but they are stated to have been composed by his disciples on the basis of records of Bsod nams rin chen's oral sayings. 2. The Basis for Mahamudra The basis for Mahiimudrii is a certain 'theory', 'understanding', 'outlook', or 'view' (lta ba, *dr�ti) of the nature of the mind. The texts of Dags po'i bka' 'bum employ a particular ter­minology to describe this nature. Since Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra doctrine has its indirect basis in the Indian Tantras and the Doha songs of realization by Indian yogfs,10 the majority of the terminology seems to have originated from those genres.11 One such term is the \"innate\" or \"the co-emergent\" (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja).12 In the Mahiimudrii context, the word signifies the perfection that is naturally found within every experience or -in other words -dharmakiiya (chos sku) as inherently present within all 10 Ta ntra (rgyud) here refers to the Buddhist Tantric texts, which for the Tibetan tradition specifically are those works found in the rgyud sections of the Tibetan bka' 'gyur and bstan 'gyur canons. Doha (mgur) is, in the Buddhist tradition, a song or poem of spiritual realization usually attributed to an Indian Tantric master, a so-called mahasiddha (grub chen). For an exposition of the Doha genre, see Kv JERNE (1977). The broader designations yogi (rnal 'byor pa, *yo gin) and tantrika, literally meaning \"yoga practitioner\" and \"follower of Tantra\" respectively, are here used to denote Tantric practitioners in general. Regarding the spelling of the word yogi, it will throughout this book be spelled in its Sanskrit nominative form yogi, which is the form of the word that comes closest to the common English usage yogi. The proper stem form of the Sanskrit word, however, is yo gin. 11 It should be underlined that there still exists no detailed study of Mahamudra terminology that thoroughly traces the Indian, Chinese, or Tibetan sources for the basic terms. Accordingly, the present terminological remarks given in this book should be regarded as highly preliminary. 12 The translation 'co-emergent' is just one possible way of capturing the meaning of this term, in the sense that 'co-emergent' here means \"innate within every moment of experience.\" GUENTHER (1969) and KVJERNE (1977:61-62) have both used the translations 'coemergence' or 'co-emergent' for the term. David P. JACKSON (1994: 16) has employed the translation 'innate simultaneously arisen gnosis' for lhan cig skyes pa 'i ye shes ( *sahajajiiana). The literal meaning of the Sanskrit word is \"born/arisen (ja) together with (saha),\" implying something inborn, natural, or inherent which has been present since birth. The literal meaning of the Tibetan term is \"born/arisen (skyes pa) as [part of] a pair (lhan cig ). \""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Chapter I: The Essence of Mahiimudrii 35 perceptions. Bsod nams rin chen often taught the co-emergent as being binary: it is a natural perfection, liberation, or purity to be found both within perception (snang ba, *avabhasa) as well as within the perceiver, i.e., the mind as such (sons nyid, *cittata), and these two elements are co-emergent (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja). In a collection of notes on Bsod nams rin chen's Teachings to the Gathering (tshogs chos), his student Sho sgom Byang chub ye shes (dates unknown), who was renowned for his special attainment in meditation, 13 wrote: In general, Mahiimudrii is without divisions, but solely for the sake of enabling yogis to comprehend the meaning of Mahiimudrii, to make them realize what has not yet been realized, a twofold division [is given]: the co-emergent mind as such and the co-emergent perceptions. So it was said [by Bsod nams rin chen]. As for these, the co-emergent mind as such is dharmakiiya, while the co-emergent perceptions are the radiance of dharmakiiya. Now, the co-emergent the mind as such, dharmaka_va, is devoid of all conceptual entanglement. It is without color or shape, uncontrived in nature. It has no identi­fiable character, but as an analogy it is like space, since it embraces everything. It is without conceptuality, unchanging, the emptiness of emptiness of a self-existing nature. The co-emergent perceptions, the radiance of dharmakiiya, are like a wave of reali­zation that is self-arisen as it has no cause or condition. It is that which involves all the different positive, negative, and unspecified thoughts that pass by. Are these two identical or different? For those without realization they are perceived as though they are different, but for those who have become realized by means of the instructions of a genuine teacher, they are identical.14 13 In a list of Bsod nams rin chen's students appended to text Na of the Dags po'i bka' 'b um entitled Answers to the Questions of Yogi Chos 'byung, Sho sgom Byang chub ye shes appears to be named as one of Bsod nams rin chen's two disciples who had attained special accomplishment (dngos grub, *siddhi) : \"The two having special accomplishment were Gsal stong Shor sgom and Rnal 'byor Chos g.yung.\" DK.A.Na.2.4a3.4: khyad par can gyi grub thob gnyis nil gsal stong shor sgom! mal 'byor chos g.yung ste/ It seems that the name Gsal stong Shor sgom here refers to Sho sgom Byang chub ye shes. 14 Ts hogs chos bkra shis phun tshogs, DK.A.Nga.9.11 a-b (critical edition based on manuscripts DK.a and DK.A): spyir phyag rgya chen po la dbye ba med kyang/ mal 'byor pa mams kyis phyag rgya chen po'i don khong du chud par bya ba'i ched du'am/ ma rtogs pa rtogs par bya ba'i ched tsam du! dbye ba mam pa gnyis tel sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa dang/ snang ba lhan cig skyes pa gnyis yin gsung! de la sems nyid than cig skyes pa nil chos kyi sku yin! snang ba than cig skyes pa ni chos sku 'i 'od yin/ de yang sems nyid than cig skyes pa chos kyi sku de sp ros pa thams cad dang bral bal kha dog dang dbyibs dang bra! ba! rang bzhin ma bcos pa'o/ /n go bongos bzung dang bra! ba/ dp e' nam mkha' !ta bu yin te gang du yang khyab pal mam par rtog pa med pal mi 'gyur ba ngo bo nyid kyis stong pa nyid kyis stong pa nyid cig yin/ snang ba than cig skyes pa chos kyi sku'i 'od nil rgyu rkyen dang bral bas rang byung rtogs pa'i rba rlabs dang 'dral blo bur gyi dge ba dang midge ba dang/"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"36 Chapter J: The Essence of Mahclmudra Bsod nam rin chen's younger nephew and later lineage holder, Shes rab byang chub (1130-1173), encapsulated the same point as follows: Your own co-emergent mind is the actual dharmakiiya. The co-emergent perceptions are the light of dharmakiiya. The co-emergent thoughts are the waves of dharmakava. The co-emergent inseparability [of these] is the meaning of dharmakiiya.15 As suggested by the word 'inseparability' (dbyer med, *abheda) in the last line of the poem, the given explanation is not meant to imply any dichotomy between a perceiving subject and a perceived object, or between the mind, perception, and thought, since the co­emergent is said to be characterized by non-duality (gnyis su med pa, *advaya). Thus, Sho sgom Byang chub ye shes further wrote : Moreover, the co-emergent perceptions never stop being the co-emergent mind as such. In order to realize this, there are three teachings that generate reali-zation. One must understand that from a source that isn't anything, it emerges as a multiplicity. Although it emerges as a multiplicity, one must understand that it isn't any object at all. And one must understand that when that has been realized, its non-duality cannot be expressed in words. Concerning this, a source that isn't anything refers to the co-emergent mind as such. That which emerges as a multiplicity refers to the co-emergent percep-tions. That it isn't any object at all although it emerges as a multiplicity should be understood in the way that all the different thoughts are untrue and do not exist as any kind of [real] objects. To understand that when that has been realized, its non-duality cannot be expressed in words means that the realization of the non-duality of perception and realization is beyond the ex-pression of language.16 Although Mahamudra is frequently referred to as a 'theory' or 'view' (!ta ba, *dr�ti), the word 'view' does here not imply a belief.

Being free from conceptual entanglements is also the definition given to emptiness (stong pa nyid, *siinyatii) by the Indian Madhyamaka philosophers, and the co-emergent should therefore be understood as being empty.17 In other words, spiritual perfection is said to lie within the realization of the emptiness of all thoughts. To emphasize the empty, non-conceptual nature of the co­emergent, it is sometimes described as 'uncontrived' (ma bcos pa, *akrtrima).18 Bsod nam rin chen's attendant Bsgom pa Legs mdzes wrote: By severing beliefs, reality is established as being free from all conceptual en­tanglements. Its nature is therefore uncontrived by thought . . . As long as one contrives, one does not realize the [true] nature of the observer and the per­ception ... The nature of reality is impenetrable by thought ... Thus, dhannakiiya is precisely the uncontrived awareness of freedom from all conceptual entangle­ments.19 Although the co-emergent is described as being the true nature of every perception, feeling, and thought, it is not something 'temporary' or 'passing' (glo bur ba, *iigantu). Hence, it is designated as being 'immanent', 'inborn', or 'continual' (gnyug ma, *nija) in the sense that it is always present.20 Sho sgom Byang chub yeshe wrote: 17 For a definition of emptiness (Sanyatii) as \"the pacification of all conceptual entanglements\" (afe�aprapaiicopafoma), see Candrakfrti's Madhyamakavrtti(l Prasannapadii: \"Thus, since empti­ness has been understood as being characterized by peace, namely the pacification of all conceptual entanglements (a§e�aprapaiicopafoma), it is free from any entanglement in the net of thoughts. Since it is free from conceptual entanglements, it is the unravelling of conceptuality. Through the unravelling of conceptuality, it is also the unravelling of all actions and afflictive emotions. Through the unravelling of actions and afflictive emotions, it is also the unravelling of rebirth.

Here the translation 'uncontrived' is preferred, since the English word 'contrived', just like the Tibetan word bcos pa, has a negative connotation, whereas the word 'altered' may be more neutral. It also makes a better translation in connection with a verbal stem, e.g., \"as long as one contrives\", as seen in the following quotation. 19 Mgon po zla 'od gzhon nus mdzad pa'i tshogs chos legs mdzes ma, DK.A.Ca.3.6a: chos kyi dbyings spros pa'i mtha' thams cad bra! ba cig tu sgro 'dogs gcod cing gtan la phebs pa'i gnas lugs kyi don de la bias bcos su med pa yin/ ... bcas bcos byed na dran snang gi gnas lugs ma rtogs pa yin no/ ... chos kyi dbyings kyi gnas lugs bsam gyis mi khyab pal ... de ltar yang sp ros pa'i mtha' thams cad dang bra! ba'i ngang de nyid la shes pa ma bcos pa de nyid chos kyi sku yin no! 20 JACKSON (1994:13, 187) here uses the translation 'primordial mind' or 'original mind' for gnyug ma.

The"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"38 Chapter I: The Essence of Mahclmudril What does it mean to be immanent? It is to be ungrounded, unobstructed, unfaltering, incessant, undemonstrational, inexpressible. First, to be ungrounded is not to be based in any [particular] state of mind ... To be unobstructed is to be free from all hope and fear, from all rejection and conviction. To be unfaltering is not to fall into either extreme of etemalism or nihilism. To be incessant is to be without wishes. To be undemonstrational is to be without any [fixed] identity. To be inexpressible is to be beyond all designations.2 1 To sum up what has been said so far about the Mahamudra view, it is suitable to quote Bsod nams rin chen's younger nephew Shes rab byang chub, who in one passage made use of another synonym for the co-emergent, namely the term 'natural knowing' or 'the natural mind' (tha ma! gyi shes pa, *prakrtajiiana):22 The co-emergent is the natural mind. It is uncontrived. It is immanent. It is dhar­makiiya. It is Buddha. It is what brings knowledge. By remaining in the natural mind as such, one never gets harmed by outer and inner distractions.23 In this manner, the nature of the mind is taught to be perfect Awakening (byang chub, *bodhi), but as long as this has not been realized, the meditator remains trapped in sm!isara. Bsod nams rin chen's older nephew and first lineage holder, Dags po bsgom pa24 Tshul khrims snying po (1116- 1 169), or in brief Dags po Bsgom tshul, summed up this existential problem in the following words: connotation 'continual' is also a regular meaning of the Sanskrit word nija in various contexts.

For undoing swnsiira, a genuine teacher's instruction is needed.25 3\" The Way of Mahiimudrii 39 Although the co-emergent mind is Awakening itself, it is necessary to discover its Awake­ned qualities through meditation. Here follows a brief synopsis of how Bsod nams rin chen is said to have taught the meditation of Mahamudra. His attendant, Bsgom pa Legs mdzes, stated: Thus recognize everything as being birthless and in this state let go off all the shortcomings of intellectual ideas, such as 'meditation' and 'no meditation', 'being' and 'not being', etc. You should rest free from conceptual grasping in a non­intellectual state.26 Obviously, it is probably rather difficult just to enter such a meditative state by one's own accord. The texts therefore repeatedly underline that the practitioner only becomes able to see the co-emergent by having it pointed out by a teacher who himself is thoroughly fami­liar therewith. Bsod nams rin chen's younger nephew, Shes rah byang chub, wrote: In general, all sentient beings in saf!isiira have always appeared as Buddhas within, but as long as [the realization] thereof has not been triggered [in them] by the divine potion of the teacher's instruction, it remains impossible to realize this and liberation cannot be gained.27 As a preliminary condition, Bsgom pa Legs mdzes explains that the practitioner should rely on a proper teacher, develop openness for teacher's spiritual influence or 'blessing' (byin brlabs, *adhi�fhiina), and thereby become introduced to the nature of the mind: Since the secret Mantra is a way of blessing, it is important first to enter the bles­sing of the teacher. Having entered the teacher's blessing, the expanse of knowing opens up. This rising realization of co-emergent knowing causes all ties to the 25 Chas rj e dags lha rj e'i gsung/ phyag rgya chen po gsal byed kyi man ngag, DK.A.Zha. l.2b: khams gsum ye nas sangs rgyas yin/ /'khor ba ye nas myang 'das yin/ /s ems can ye nas sangs rgyas yin/ /n yon mongs ye nas byang chub yin/ /'on kyang ye nas ma rtogs pas/ /khams gsum pa ni 'khor ba yin/ /'khor ba las ni bzlog pa nil /bla ma dam pa'i gdams ngag dgos! 26 Mgon po zla 'ad gzhon nus mdzad pa'i tshogs chos legs mdzes ma, DK.A.Ca.4.Sa: de !tar chos thams cad skye med du ngos zin pa dang de ka 'i ngang la bsgom pa dang mi bsgom pa dang yod pa dang med pa dang la sags bzung 'dzin blo 'i dri ma dang bra! bar byas la blo bra! gyi ngang du 'dzin med du bzhag go! 27 Chas rj e dags po lha rj e'i gsung/ snying po don gyi gdams pa phyag rgya chen po'i 'bum tig, DK.A.'a.5.3a: spyir na 'khor ba'i sems can thams cad la/ /s angs rgyas ye nas rang chas su yod kyang! /mtshon byed bla ma'i man ngag bdud rtsi yis/ Ima mtshon bar du rtogs shing grol mi sridl."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"40 Chapter 1: The Essence of Ma/ulmudrii perception of outer phenomena to be automatically untied. Thereby, one arrives at a knowing-awareness, where all conceptual beliefs have been cut off from within.28 Bsod nams rin chen thus taught his students to give rise to a first glimpse of Awakening by relying on the teacher's spiritual influence or 'blessing'. This point is especially noteworthy, because he thereby led his students to the highest level of Tantra, i.e., Mahiimudrii, without necessarily giving them Tantric empowerment and without teaching all of them the usual preceding steps of Tantric yoga, which normally serve the purpose of providing the first glimpse of the nature of the mind on the Tantric path. Instead, in order to gain the necessary firsthand experience that would enable the student to enter the actual Mahiimudrii meditation, Bsod nams rin chen instructed his students to practice the meditation on the teacher called guru yoga (bla ma 'i rnal 'byor). By making strong wishes to a realized teacher, the student is said to be led into the teacher's own realization. In a segment on Mahiimudrii in the anonymous text The Instruction Manual entitled Closely Stringed Pearls, it is said: Concerning the way of guiding oneself or others in the meditation of Mahamudrii, given that this [tradition] of ours is a transmission of blessing, the meaning of Mahiimudrii cannot arise in one's mind-stream as long as one has not received the blessing of the teacher. However, there is no difficulty in receiving the teacher's blessing, for one receives it ljust] by making wishes with conviction and trust. Those having the best conviction and trust also get the best blessing. Those with mediocre conviction and trust [receive] a mediocre [blessing], while those with little conviction and trust [receive] little blessing. Without ever feeling conviction and trust, it is truly impossible to receive blessing. Consequently, this is the very core of the Dhanna.29 Dags po'i bka ' 'bum also contains exact instructions on how to meditate on the teacher, but it would be too elaborate here to translate such an instruction in full.30 Instead, the actual Mahiimudrii meditation practice will now be introduced in the brief words of Sho sgom Byang chub ye shes: 28 Mgon po zla 'od gzhon nus mdzad pa'i tshogs chos legs mdzes ma, DK.A.Ca.2.2b: gsang sngags byin brlabs kyi lam pa yin pas/ !dang po bla ma'i byin brlabs zhugs pa cig gal che ba yin/ bla ma'i byin rlabs zhugs nas ye shes kyi mthongs phyed! de lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes kyi rtogs pa shar bas/ phyi shes bya'i chos thams cad la sgrog rang grol la song nas/ ye shes kyi rig pa sgro 'dogs nang nas chod pa gcig yong ngo! 29 Chos rj e dags po !ha rj e'i gsung/ khrid chos mu tig tsar la brgyud pa, DK.A.Pa. 13.12a: rang ngam gzhan la phyag rgya chen po'i bsgom 'khrid lugs ni 'o skol gyi 'di byin brlabs kyi brgyud pa yin pas/ bla ma'i byin brlabs ma zhugs na phyag rgya chen po'i don rgyud la 'char mi srid pas/ bla ma'i byin brlabs 'jug pa la tshegs med! mos gus yod pas gsol ba btab pa la rten nas 'jug pa yin! mos gus rab la byin brlabs yang rab tu 'jug /m os gus 'bring la 'bring/ mos gus mtha' ma la byin brlabs mtha' ma! mos gus gtan nas med na byin brlabs gtan nas mi 'jug pas chos nyid yin! 30 See, e.g., Chos rj e dags po !ha rj e 'i gsung/ kh rid chos mu tig tsar la brgyud pa, DK.A.Pa. l .3a."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Chapter I: The Essence of Mahiimudrii To bring about realization of co-emergent knowing, the understanding of which is [inexpres-sible] like a dream dreamt by a mute or by a small infant, it is necessary to engage in meditation practice.

In the middle [of the session], settle into an uncontrived state by letting go of hesitation. At the end [of the session], understand all thoughts about physical sensations as being birthless.31 41 In The Meditation Stages of the Inconceivable Ma hamudra, the practice is explained in the following way: There are three inconceivable methods ... Be natural, serene, and at ease. To be natural involves three things: Relax the body and the mind within, leave the speech as it is without controlling the breath, and let the mind be unfounded. To be serene also involves three things: Let the mind be on its own and thus free from attach­ment; by becoming mentally disengaged from the conceptual objects that appear as identities, know them to be dharmakiiya ; and do not stray from this. To be at ease likewise involves three things: In the three activities of daily life, be without hope and fear; leave the senses and the mind at ease; and do not let the mind become separated from this experience.32 An even more detailed description is found m The Instruction Manual entitled Closely Stringed Pearls. In the preceding section of the text, the preliminary steps have been explained in detail and in the present passage the actual practice is presented: Namo guru! Complete the necessary number of days, months, and years of making wishes to the teacher. When the time has then come for the actual practice, begin the meditation session by engendering determination and so forth as a short preli­minary step.

Do not meditate on the birthless, the lack of a self-existing nature, freedom from conceptual entanglement, what is beyond the intellect, emptiness, selflessness, bliss, presence and non-thought, not being established in any way, or there not being something wanted and someone wanting it.

Thus, identify the moment of the present thought. In brief, do not think about earlier or future thoughts, but find out how the thought of this very moment is. By looking nakedly at just this moment of the present thought, the thought is cut off as it is made to pass and one thereby enters an undistracted state free from thoughts. When a distraction or a thought again manifests, search for its source [within]. By looking nakedly, the thought is liberated by itself and, with balance, one enters non-conceptuality. In this way, search for and look directly at any thought that arises. Before the session becomes too long, stop while the experience is still fresh and make many short sessions in this way. By doing this repeatedly, one gradually comes to understand the nature of thought, whereby one reaches an understanding of all the phenomena of sm71siira and nirvii�ia.

Yoga is to settle in this view of whatever occurs within the state of dharmakiiya of one's mind.35 As the experience of the co-emergent is cultivated through yoga, the practitioner is said to progress through four stages of Mahiimudrii practice called the \"four yogas\" (rnal 'byor bzhi, *caturyoga). These four are named \"single pointedness\" (rtse gcig, *ekiigra), \"freedom from conceptual entanglement\" (spros bral, *ni�prapaiica), \"one taste\" (ro gcig or du ma ro gcig, *ekar asa), and \"great meditative absorption\" (mnyam bzhag chen po, *mahiisamiihita).36 Shes rab byang chub has given a short description of these: First, at the time of learning, exercise a clear and pure awareness; then exercise an undistracted mind; and then exercise being undistracted within the nature of awareness. Once this has been cultivated, it is said that one has developed certainty within oneself. When one no longer loses sight of the nature of the mind, any thought that arises is dharmakiiya. The clouds or mist that appeared in the sky have dissolved back into the sky again. It is said that if one is still unable to control the arising of thought, one will become able to do so later. Having generated the deity, meditate only on radiance. This is an experience of pure radiance. To be undis­tracted in that is the abiding. The insight that no longer perceives any kind of [fixed] nature is the [basic] realization. The momentary mind that is unobstructed radiance is \"the yoga of single pointedness.\" The realization that the nature of awareness is birthless and beyond 'being' and 'non-being' is \"the yoga of freedom from conceptual entanglement.\" The realization that what appears to be a variety is actually of a single nature is \"the yoga of one taste.\" The uninterrupted realization of the inseparability of perception and emptiness is the \"great meditative absorption.\" The essence of the mind is like the center of the autumn sky. It is without hope and fear, unchanging and uninterrupted at all times.37 35 Chas rj e dags po lha rj e'i gsung/ snying po don gyi gdams pa phyag rgya chen po'i 'bum tig, DK.A.'a.4.2b: dran rtog myong tshor ma lus thams cad kun/ !chos sku sems las ma rtogs gzhan med pas/ !g ang !tar song yang rang sems chos sku'i ngang/ Ide !tar lta ba thag chod mal 'byor yin! 36 For a discussion of the four yogas, see GUENTHER (1992). 37 Chas rj e dags po lha rj e'i gsung/ snying po don gyi gdams pa phyag rgya chen po'i 'bum tig, DK.A.'a.l l.6a: dang po slob pa'i dus rig pa gsal sing nge bade la bslab/ Ide yang shes pa ma yengs pa la bslab/ Ide yang/ rig pa'i ngo bo ma yengs pa la bslab/ Ide goms tsa na/ rang la nges shes skye ba yin gsungs/ se1ns nyid kyi ngo bo ma shor bar byas na/ mam rtog ci byung yang chos sku yin/ nam mkha' la sp rin dang/ khug ma la sags pa ci tsam byung yang/ /n am mkha' rang la dengs nas 'gro ba yin/ Imam rtog 'phror ma btub na slar thub yin gsungslyi dam lhar bskyed nas 'ad gsal 'ba' zhig bsgom/ gsal sing nge ba de nyams myong yin/ Ide la ma yengs pa de gnas pa yin! shes rab kyi ci'i ngo bar yang ma mthong ba de rtogs pa yin/ gsal la ma 'gags pa skad cig ma'i shes pa de rtse gcig gi mal 'byor yin/ !rig pa'i ngo bo skye med! yod med las 'das par rtogs pa de spros bral gyi mal 'byor yin/ sna tshogs su snang yang rang bzhin cig tu rtogs pa de du ma ro gcig gis mal 'byor yin/"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"44 Chapter 1: The Essence of Mahamudrii Once the four yogas have been accomplished, the practitioner attains the ultimate goal of Mahiimudrii, which Bsod nams rin chen's attendant, Bsgom pa Legs mdzes, described as follows: It has been said that \"the result is a spontaneously accomplished certainty free from hope and fear.\" The result is dharmakaya. That it is spontaneously accomplished means that one understands that everything one sees and hears has always been birthless, the nature of dharmakaya. It is the realization of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana.38 . . Summing up, Bsgom pa Legs mdzes wrote: There are three aspects: the flawless basis, the fl awless way, and the flawless result. The first is the naturally pure phenomena as such. The second is to take co­emergent knowing as the path. The third is not to be divorced from the inseparability of space and knowing ... This instruction of taking the penetrating openness as the way is like a [spotless] lotus flower: when one has ascertained the true being to be the flawless basis, one takes it as the path, whereby one attains true being as the flawless result.39 Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii teaching thus commences with that the practlt10ner employs a certain understanding of the nature of the mind. It is said that every state of mind has a co-emergent aspect of Awakening, referred to as dharmakiiya, the state of ultimate reality. This view is associated with the highest level of Tantra called Mahiimudrii. To introduce his students to an experience thereof, it seems that Bsod nams rin chen often avoided bestowing Tantric empowerment or teaching the Tantric methods. Instead, he gave a meditation on the teacher, where the student is instructed to make intense wishes for Awakening to the teacher with strong trust. It is promised that the student thereby will receive the teacher's blessing, which enables the practitioner to gain a glimpse of the innate A wakened qualities of the mind.

Having become acquainted with this realization, every state of mind is said to appear as A wakened. The ensuing result is to be free from all hopes and fears. Bs od nams rin chen's approach thus first of all emphasized the role of the teacher, which may help to explain the immense importance that devotion to the teacher generally has played in the later contemplative traditions of the Bka' brgyud schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Secondly, this devotional practice enabled Bsod nams rin chen to introduce his students to the highest level of Tantra without necessarily teaching them the regular preceding steps of Tantric yoga. Mahamudrii was thereby changed from being the climax of Tantric practice into being a meditative practice emphasizing instant Awakening. In this regard, it was somewhat similar to other instant approaches in Buddhist contemplative systems, such as Chinese Chan40 or the Tibetan Rnying ma and Bon traditions of Great Perfection (rdzogs chen). Was this kind of Mahiimudra approach a novelty purely invented by Bsod nams rin chen or had it been passed down from or otherwise implicitly inherent in the earlier Indian Buddhist traditions? And, if it was a novelty , what then might have motivated Bsod nams rin chen to formulate such a doctrine? These are questions to be briefly considered in the following chapter. As will be shown, some Tibetan defenders of the classical Indian Tantric traditions reacted quite strongly against the meditative teachings of Bsod nams rin chen and his Bka' brgyud successors. By looking into this critique, some of the doctrinal forces at play in the Tibetan contemplative traditions of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries begin to emerge, thereby elucidating the Tibetan reception history of Bsod nams rin chen's teachings. 40 The Chinese word Chan (1�), perhaps better known in its Japanese pronunciation Zen, literally means 'meditation'. The Chinese and Japanese words are phonetic approximations of the Indian word for meditation, dhyana (Tibetan bsam gtan)."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra 1. A Mahamudra Critic Roughly 79 years after the demise of Bsod nams rin chen in 1153, a strong criticism of his Mahiimudra teachings was penned by the scion of scholarship in the Tibetan Buddhist Sa skya tradition, namely Sa skya Par:ic# ta Kun dga' rgyal mtshan (1182-1253), who also is known in brief as Sa Pan. Sa Pai:i belonged to the powerful 'Khon clan, which held the Sa skya transmission of the Tantric teachings that had been gathered in India by 'Brog mi Lotsa ba Shakya ye shes (993-1050).41 In 1216, Sa Par:i became the religious head of the clan and its monastic center in Sa skya.42 Until the late twelfth century, the Sa skya lineage had predominantly been a Tantric tradition specialized in the Path and Fruition (lam 'bras) teachings epitomized in Virupa's text generally referred to as \"The Vajra Verses\" (Rdo rje tshig rkang),43 a work having its theoretical basis in the Indian Hevajratantra and the associated literature. During the abbacy of Sa Pary's uncle, Bsod nams rtse mo ( 1142-1182), the Sa sky a followers began more broadly to incorporate doctrinal siltra and philosophical sastra study of the Indian Common Mahayana teachings into their curricula, as propagated earlier in Tibet by the translator Rngog Lotsa ba Blo ldan shes rab (1059-1109) and other scholars. This took place, in particular, through the teaching activities of the learned monk Phya pa Chos kyi sengge (1109-1169), who served as a tutor for Bsod nams rtse mo. With the many writings and religious activities of Sa Pa9, this scholastic shift in orientation within the Sa skya tradition seems to have become much more pronounced. Besides studying the Tantric teachings held by his clan , Sa Pai:i also spent his formative years studying with a number of Tibetan teachers from the tradition of Rngog Lotsa ba.44 Then in 1205, Sa Par:i met the Indian scholar Sakyasribhadra (1127-1225) who had come to Tibet in 1204 on the invitation of Tibetan Buddhist master and translator Khro phu Lotsa ba Byams pa'i dpal (1172-1225). Sa Par:i spent several years under the tutelage of Sakyasnohadra and his entourage of younger Indian pm:u;litas, focusing his learning especially on Indian Buddhist epistemology (tshad ma, prama\"(la). His study of Indian texts 41 See VAN DER KuIJP ( 1983 :97). 42 See David P. JACKSON (1987:27). 43 D2284/Q3 l 3 l, Lam 'bras bu dang bcas pa'i gdams ngag ( *Miirgaphaliivaviida). 44 For these events in the Sa skya lineage and Sa Par.i's life, see VAN DER KUIJP (1983:97-99)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Ma!nlmudrfi 47 cu lminated around 1219,45 when Sa Pai:i composed his epistemological masterpiece, The Repository of Polemics on Epistemology (Tshad ma rigs pa 'i gter), a text which still today is re garded in all traditions of Tibetan Buddhism as one of the foremost Tibetan treatises on prama!w. With The Repository of Polemics on Epistemology, Sa Pai:i attempted to tidy up all imprecisions that had crept into the interpretations of the Indian pramii!W tradition in the previous writings by his Tibetan predecessors. Some years later, Sa Pai:i wrote another polemical work entitled A Clear Diff erentation of the Three Sets of Vows (Sdom gsum gyi rab tu dbye ba'i bstan bcos, or in brief Sdom gsum rab dbye).46 In this text, Sa Pai:i aimed at setting straight the proper principles for Buddhist practice in relation to the three levels of vows and commitments (sdom gsum), viz. the Priitimok�a vows of liberation, the Mahayana vows of the bodhisattva, and the special observances of Tantric practice (dam tshig, samaya). Besides discussing the concrete principles of these vows, Sa Par:i included a number of critiques of what he regarded as improper practices by his fellow Tibetan Buddhists. Thus, the text's first section on the Priitimok�a vows, which covers 24 folios in Sa Par:i's autocommentary, includes a short passage criticizing certain contemporary Tibetan interpretations of the buddha-nature doctrine (tathiigatagarbha).47 The second section on the bodhisattva vows covers only eight folios in the commentary.48 The major part of the text, however, is its third section, covering 62 folios, which deals with the proper practice of the Tantras, namely the methods of Secret Mantra (guhyamantraniiya). In this part, Sa Par:i was more concerned with criticizing what he considered improper Tantric practices in the other Tibetan Buddhist traditions than he was with explaining the actual meaning and performance of the Tantric commitments (samaya). Thus, it was in this context that he presented an implicit attack on the Bka' brgyud tradition of Mahiimudrii as initiated by Bsod nams rin chen and the way in which this form of Mahiimudrii practice had later been propagated within the \"Single Intention\" (dgongs gcig) teachings of the 'Bri gung Bka' brgyud tradition and the \"White Panacea\" (dkar po gcig thub) teachings of the Tshal pa Bka' brgyud school.49 45 For the date, see David P. JACKSON (1987:26-28). 46 The work includes a root text as well as a short auto-commentary entitled Sdom gsum rang mchan 'kh rul med. The auto-commentary does not explicitly state Sa Pai:i to be its author, but it is generally held by the later Sa skya tradition to have been composed by Sa Pai:i, a view that is also shared by the academic specialist David P. JACKSON (1991 :242-249). A later commentary on the text was composed in 1463 by Go rams pa Bsod nams sengge (1429-1489) under the title Sdom pa gsum gyi rab tu dbye ba'i mam bshad rgyal ba'i gsung rab kyi dgongs pa gsal ba. 47 The passage has been translated by SEYFORT RUEGG (1973:31-32).

Nonetheless, it"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"48 Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrli A Clear Differentiation was written around 1232,50 when Sa Pai:i was fifty years old. Just twelve years later in 1244, he traveled to Central Asia to meet the Mongol prince Kodan (1206-1251), a son of the Mongolian ruler Ogedei Khan (1186-1241), who at that point controlled the Tangut region (Mi nyag, [713� Xfxia) northeast of Tibet. Kodan had in 1240 briefly invaded Tibet to pillage and had subsequently invited Sa Pai:i to visit him at his court in LanzhOu (M)'f'I). Having arrived there, Sa Pai:i entered into a political settlement with the Mongols in 1249, which, on the one hand, prevented further Mongolian invasions of Tibet and, on the other hand, delegated great secular powers to Sa Pai:i's 'Khon clan by installing the 'Khon family as the Mongolian viceroy for the Tibetan territory.51 Sa Pai:i's Central Asian diplomatic mission sheds some light on the political and reli­gious prestige that he possessed already prior to his journey. Sa Pai:i received a summons directly from Prince Kodan in 1244 to attend Kodan's court, suggesting that Kodan must have considered Sa Pa9 to be one of the most important bla mas in Tibet at the time. A Clear Differentiation was therefore not an insignificant criticism, since it came from one of the most influential religious persons in Tibet, whose authority must have been felt scholastically as well as secularly. Indeed, Sa Pa9's criticism may be considered in light of the political climate of the time. As SAMUEL (1993:479) writes: Among Gampopa's disciples were several founders of major monastic gompa, each of which served as the center for a Kagytidpa suborder in later days ... These gompa were to be the Sakyapa order's main rivals in the power struggles of the thirteenth century. In fact, the main Bka' brgyud monasteries of the 'Bri gung, Tshal pa, and Karma kwri tshang traditions competed with the Sa skya pas for the favor of the Mongols. In the words of STEIN (1972:77), \"the Karma-pas were going to be the Sakya-pas rivals at the court of the Emperors of China -first Mongolian (Yuan) and later Chinese (Ming).\"52 Karma Pak�i (1206-1283), the head of the Karma kmJi tshang Bka' brgyud branch, was sent for by Kubilai Khan (1215-1294) who met him in A mdo in 1255, although this meeting did not lead to any lasting patronage. Also, the 'Bri gung Rebellion of 1285-1290 should be noted, during which the 'Bri gung Bka' brgyud monasteries supported by an army more or less repeats the same line of argument as the one found in Sdom gsum rab dbye, and it therefore need not be elaborated here for the present discussion. Sa Pai:i's Mahiimudrii critiques in both works have been treated in full detail by David P. JACKSON (1994 ), who has also provided an English annotated translation of the pertinent passage from Th ub pa'i dgongs gsal (JACKSON, 1994: 180- 1 82).

In the end, the rebellion was quelled by the Sa skya pas and the 'Bri gung monastic center was torched and burned down.53 Sa Paiy's critique in A Clear Diff erentiation of the meditation systems practiced in o ther Tibetan traditions was thus written in a climate wherein a political power struggle between the Sa skya and the Bka' brgyud traditions was about to evolve.5 4 2. Sa Pal) and Indian Tantric Buddhism The standpoint on Mahamudra found in A Clear Differentiation accords with the traditional Indian view of the Unparalleled Yogatantras (Rnal 'byor bla na med pa'i rgyud, *Anuttarayogatantra or Yoganiruttarat antra). Sa Pa9 admonished that practitioners should strictly follow the Indian Tantras and their associated Indian commentaries. He found that the Mahamudra doctrine propagated by Bsod nams rin chen and other Bka' brgyud pas went against these Tantras, because Bsod nams rin chen had taught Mahamudra independently of the Tantric empowerments and the pertinent yogic meditation techniques. In the eyes of Sa Pa9, Mahamudra is exclusively linked to the wisdom that is said to appear when practicing these Tantric empowerments. Hence, before Sa Pa9's critique will be explained in detail below, the traditional role of Mahamudra in Indian Tantric Buddhism needs to be presented in brief, given that Sa Pa9 was a staunch defender of the Indian tradition. The Indian term Mahamudra (phyag rgya chen po or in brief phyag chen) is a Sanskrit compound consisting of two words: the adjective maha (chen po) meaning 'great' or 'big', and the noun mudra (phyag rgya) meaning a 'seal', 'stamp', or 'impression'. Used metaphorically, the Sanskrit word mudra denotes a variety of symbols, especially symbolic handgestures employed in Indian dance and religious ritual and iconography. The Indian Buddhist Tantras operate with a large number of mudras and the term Mahamudra must therefore be seen in its Tantric context as being a subtype of the broader term mudra. Several late Mahayana Sutras employ the term mudra55 and it is likely that the Buddhist Tantras adopted the word from these texts. In these Sutras, mudra appears in the sense that 53 See TRINLE ( 1991:50-52). 54 David P. JACKSON (1994:67) has objected to such a political interpretation of Sa Pa9's motiva­tion in writing his critique. He devotes an entire chapter of his book (1994:91-122) for arguing that Sa Pai? adhered to pure scholarly principles and that he therefore ought not to be seen as having been motivated by sectarianism. He nevertheless admits (1994:72) that Sa Pa9 by his criticism attempted to counter the continuing influence of the Ts hal pa Bka' brgyud school founded by Bla ma Zhang (1 123-1193), which was a major contender for political power at the time. Sa Pa9's personal motivation can, of course, never be known, but it seems to make little sense completely to ignore the political tension within which these Buddhist traditions developed. 55 For discussion and examples of various uses of the word mudra in the Mahayana Sutras and Tantras, see the sixteenth-century Tibetan Mahiimudra treatise Nges don phyag rgya chen po'i sgom rim gsal bar byed pa'i legs bshad zla ba'i 'od zer composed by Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal (c. 1512-1587), TBRC W23447-1898, pp. 163-186 (the section entitled phyag rgya chen po'i mam"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"50 Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudrii emptiness 'stamps', 'marks', or 'characterizes' all phenomena, just like a seal or a stamp (i.e., a mudrii) is a symbolic mark that identifies the person who has signed or sent a document.56 The Sutras thus say that all phenomena are 'sealed' by emptiness. Further, in the ritual practices of the Kriyii-, Caryii-, and Yogatantras, the word mudrii designates symbolic hand gestures used for 'sealing' ritual actions through their representational intent. The word is also used to express the symbolic meanings of such gestures in iconography and in the visualization of Tantric deities. In the Unparalleled Yogatantras (*Anuttarayogatantra), however, the terminological meaning of the word mudrii is much more complex, and it is particularly in this context that the word has been given a deeper semantic significance that is relevant for the present discussion. The practice of these Tantras begins with receiving empowerment (dbang, abhi:jeka) by a master belonging to the lineage of a given Tantra. The Anuttarayoga empowerment is a ritual act generally consisting of four steps known as \"the four empowerments.\" 57 These empowerments serve to indicate the experience of spiritual realization and its qualities to the practitioner as well as to introduce the yogic techniques leading to this realization. Once the practitioner has received empowerment, he or she must cultivate the understanding that was achieved during the empowerment through the meditation practices associated with each empowerment. In brief, these meditation practices are divided into two overall steps known as the 'Generation Stage' (bskyed rim, utpattikrama) and the 'Completion Stage' (rdzogs rim, sampannakrama or utpannakrama). Having perfected these techniques involving ritual, visualization, and yoga, the practitioner must in the end let go off all contrived, premeditated efforts, since the experience of emptiness involves something that goes beyond the conceptuality embedded in these stages of practice. It is this final, uncontrived stage wherein all contemplative or yogic technique has been abandoned that is referred to as the \"Greal Seal\" (Mahiimudrii). In this context, the word mudrii carries a special meaning in the Tantric practices of the Anuttara yogatantras, wherein orgasm is employed as a special sexual approach for experiencing the meditative unraveling of thought. Such unraveling of thought is called 'emptiness' (stong pa nyid, sunyatii) or 'radiance' ('od gsal, pr abhiisvara or iibhiisvara) in the Tantric terminology. The basic theory is that an unraveling of thought occurs naturally during orgasm and through yogic control of the sexual experience it may become possible to remain in an intense prolonged experience of an orgasm-like bliss that reaches beyond ordinary concepts and thereby shatters the mind's usual entanglement in conceptuality .

The sexual practices of the Anuttarayogatantras involve a constellation of three or four so-called mudras or 'seals'. These are named the 'Dharma seal' (chos kyi phyag rgya, dharmamudrii), the 'knowledge seal' (ye shes kyi phyag rgya, jfiiinamudrii), the 'action seal' (las kyi phyag rgya, karmamudrii), and the 'great seal' (phyag rgya chen po, mahiimudrii). Basically, all four mudriis are 'representations' or 'symbols' of radiance and emptiness, viz. the object of realization in Buddhist Tantric practice. Emptiness is first expressed in the form of the teacher's oral instruction to the practitioner, which is referred to as the 'Dharma seal'. Thereupon, to cultivate the slight experience of emptiness that naturally occurs during the height of sexual arousal and orgasm, the Tantric practitioner visualizes him-or herself as a male deity in sexual union with a female deity. Here, the female deity represents emptiness and this imagined sexual partner is called the 'knowledge seal'. Having mastered the visualized technique while practicing alone, very advanced practitioners may go on to engage in sexual union with an actual partner in order to enhance the attained meditative experience, and this physical sexual partner (which generally is considered to be a female partner, since Buddhist Tantric texts almost invariably are written from a male perspective) is called the 'action seal'. Through prolonged sexual union, imagined or real, the practitioner may experience a partial glimpse of Awakening, which is called 'indicatory knowledge' (dpe'i ye shes). The indicatory knowledge enables the practitioner to progress to the final stage of the Tantric practice, which is related to the fourth empowerment of the Anuttarayogatantras, during which 'actual knowledge' (don gyi ye shes) emerges. It is such actual knowledge of emptiness or radiance that is referred to with the term the 'great seal', i.e., Mahiimudrii. 58 Mahiimudrii is thus the ultimate symbol that does not point to Awakening but which rather is Awakening itself. Mahiimudrii is the final view of the An­uttarayogatantras and it is only taught at the highest level of their various practices. Its view is the final stage, where the practitioner has attained genuine realization of emptiness, has abandoned all contrived efforts and techniques, whether sexual or otherwise, and is fully able to remain absorbed in the understanding that every perception in its true nature is Awakening (byang chub, bodhi).59 As will be explained below, Sa Pai:i maintained that Mahiimudrii only should be taught in this type of Tantric context, namely as the outcome of the four empowerments and their associated meditations of the Generation and Completion Stages involving the four mudriis. He therefore strongly dis agreed with Bsod nams rin chen's direct way of teaching Mahii­mudrii without necessarily first bestowing Tantric empowerment on the practitioner and without teaching the yogic and sexual Tantric techniques involving the four mudriis. Sa Pai:i also suggested that Bsod nams rin chen's instant approach to Mahiimudrii, in fact, might not 58 In this connection, GRAY (2007:306) has translated the word mudrii simply as 'consort' and has accordingly rendered Mahiimudrii as 'the great consort'.

In the following section, Sa Pai:i's critique will be presented with a few explanatory comments, whereafter it shall be analyzed to see what his critique might reveal about Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudra doctrine. 3. Sa PalJ 's Mahiimudrii Critique In the first part of the section in A Clear Diff erentiation dealing with the practice of the Tantric commitments,60 Sa Pai:i criticized the custom of allowing Tantric practice without the bla ma having first bestowed a full and proper empowerment on the practitioner. In the later Tibetan commentary on this passage of the text, the Sa skya teacher Go rams pa spelled out that Sa Pai:i's criticism on this point was directed at the followers of Bsod nams rin chen (folio 88�), also referring to them as \"some followers of [Maha]mudra\" (phyag rgya ba kha cig, folio 89ai).61 Further, Sa Pai:i and Go rams pa also included an extended discussion of a Bka' brgyud custom at the time, where students were permitted to practice Inner Heat (gtum mo, *caJJ­rj,alf) and other advanced Tantric yogas after merely having received a short blessing ritual (rjes gnang, *anujflapti) on the Tantric goddess VajravarahI without having been transmitted the full Tantric empowerment (dbang, *abhi�eka) for the practice. Sa Pai:i's view could here be summed up as follows: if one does not want to follow the Tantras properly, one should rather follow the Common Mahayana properly; if one wants to follow the Tantras, one should take the four empowerments in full, meditate properly on the two stages, and cultivate Mahamudra, which is the wisdom that arises therefrom. This discussion is followed in Sa Pai:i's text by a section dealing specifically with Mahamudra (folios 25b-31 b ), of which only the first piece has direct relevance for the Mahamudra doctrine of Bsod nams rin chen (folios 25b-26b).62 The pertinent passage will now be translated and analyzed in detail. 60 Sa skya'i bka' 'bum, Sde dge xylograph printed in 1736, vol. 12 (Na), folios 18aff. or pp. 35ff.

The edition, which was edited by Sonam Tsering, appears to be a facsimile off-print of the Sde dge xylograph having the exact same pagination. 61 Go rams pa's commentary, entitled Sdom pa gsum gy i rah tu dbye ba'i rnam bshad rgyal ba'i gsung rah kyi dgongs pa gsal ba, is found in the Collected Works of Gorampa (Kun mkhyen go rah byams pa bsod nams seng ge 'i bka' 'bum), vol. 9 (Ta), folio lff., published in 13 volumes in 1995 by Yashodhara Publications, New Delhi, for the Dzongsar Institute in Bir, Himachal Pradesh, India. 62 Sa Pai:i's critique of Bka' brgyud Mahiimudra in this passage and in other works by Sa Pai:i have previously been discussed in detail by Roger R. JACKSON (1982), VAN DER KUIJP (1986), BROIDO (1987), David P. JACKSON (1990; 1994), and MAYER (1997)."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahllmudrji 53 S a Pai:i begins the passage by giving a general criticism of the Bka' brgyud Mahamudra doctrine: Some meditate on Mahamudra, but they are just meditating on shutting up thoughts. They do not understand Mahamudra to be the wisdom that arises from the two stages [of Generation and Completion]. Such fools' Mahamudra meditation is said mostly to be the cause for being reborn as an animal. If not so, they will be reborn in the Formless Realm or fall into the iravaka's cessation of rebirth. Even if they meditate well, this [practice] would not go beyond the Madhyamaka medita­tion [of the Common Mahayana tradition]. Although Madhyamaka meditation is fine, it is very difficult to accomplish. As long as the two gatherings [of benefi­cence and knowledge] have not been completed, such meditation cannot be perfected, and the perfection of the two gatherings is said to require [three] immea­surable aeons.63 Sa Pai:i here argues that if Mahiimudrii is not the realization produced by practicing the two stages of the Anuttarayogatantras, namely the Generation Stage and the Completion Stage, it is mistaken, because it would not be realization. He characterizes it as a wrong meditative technique where the meditator merely attempts to block out or shut up (kha 'tshom) thoughts (rtog pa, *vikalpa) without realizing their true nature as being emptiness. He then argues that, in most cases, such meditation would simply amount to cultivating one's stupidity, since the meditator is engaged in a mistaken idea that is merely imagined to be Mahamudrii. That, in tum, can only result in rebirth as an animal, which is here implied to be the embodiment of stupidity. Nevertheless, if the meditator by relying on this technique were truly able to enter into a non-conceptual state (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa) devoid of the wisdom of proper realization, the practitioner would either end up in his or her future life becoming reborn in the Formless Realm (gzugs med khams, *iirupyadhiitu) within sm11siira, where the meditator generally is said to be absorbed within a dull meditative state devoid of mental activity. Alternatively, if the practitioner nevertheless managed to acquire a certain degree of insight shy of full Awakening, s/he might enter nirvii7:1a as taught in the inferior Sriivakayiina, which involves the cessation of rebirth in saf(lsiira. It should here be under­stood as implicit that none of these states is considered desirable for a bodhisattva follower of the Mahiiyiina path. Finally, Sa Pai:i reasons, if someone were to claim that such artificial Mahamudra meditation results in a genuine realization of emptiness as taught in the Mahayana without 63 A Clear Differentiation, folio 25b: phyag rgya chen po bsgom na yang/ lrtog pa kha 'tshom nyid bsgom gyi/ !r im gnyis las byung ye shes la! /p hyag rgya chen por mi shes sol lblun po phyag rgya che bsgom pal /p hal cher dud 'gro'i rgyu ru gsungs/ !min na gzugs med khams su skye! !y ang na nyan thos 'gog par !tung/ /g al te de ni bsgom legs kyang! !dbu ma'i bsgom las !hag pa med/ !d bu ma'i bsgom de bzang mod kyi! /'on kyang 'grub pa shin tu dka'/ lji srid tshogs gnyis ma rdzogs pal Ide srid bsgom de mthar mi phyin/ /'di yi tshogs gnyis rdzogs pa la/ /bskal pa grangs med dgos par gsungs!

Sa Pal) admits such insight meditation to be an acceptable Buddhist approach, but he goes on pointing out that accord­ing to the Common Mahiiyiina doctrine the attainment of final realization via the contem­plative methods of the Common Mahiiyiina is said to require practice throughout three immeasurable aeons (bskal pa grangs med, *asa1Jikhyeyakal pa). An immeasurable aeon is defined in the Abhidharma teachings as being 1057 years, indeed an extremely long period of time covering countless rebirths. Mahayana doctrine further explicates that the practice of a bodhisattva must be cultivated throughout three such aeons.64 The reason for the extre­mely long duration of the bodhisattva's path is that the bodhisattva has to perfect the two gatherings of beneficence and knowledge over the course of uncountable rebirths, just like the Buddha did according to the jiitaka tradition. Without perfecting these gatherings, the bodhisattva's insight meditation cannot be completed. On the basis of these universally accepted dogmas of Mahayiina Buddhism, Sa Pal) rejects any form of Mahiimudrii which is not taught as being the culmination of the methods of the Tantras, given the promise made in the Tantras of providing a very speedy short-cut approach to Buddhahood, where in rare cases of highly talented practitioners the ultimate result of Buddhahood may be reached even within a single lifetime. Thereupon, Sa Pal) continues his critique by pres enting his own view of Mahiimudrii: My Mahiimudrii is the self-arisen knowing acquired through the wisdom of the empowerments and the meditation of the two stages. Its realization is accomplished within this life, if one has skill in the methods of Secret Mantra. The Buddha did not teach a realization of Mahiimudrii other than this. Accordingly, if one puts one's trust in Mahiim udrii, one should practice it according to the scriptures of Secret Mantra.65 Here Sa Pal) points out that only the methods of the Tantras are considered capable of producing realization faster than the three immeasurable aeons mentioned above, namely within a single lifetime , provided that one is skillful in the Mantra methods. Having thus rejected any teaching in which Mahiimudrii is taught outside the frame of the four Tantric empowerments and their practices, Sa Pal) puts forth his own view: Mahamudrii is exclu­sively the final realization produced by the Tantric empowerments and the associated meditations of the Generation and Completion stages. When he says that the Buddha did not teach any other kind of Mahiimudrii, he implies that one only finds Mahiimudra taught 64 This is, e.g., the view presented in the Bodh isattvabhumi. See KRAGH (2013a: 92-93 fn. 206 , 1 66, 1 68, 193). 65 A Clear Differentiation, folio 25b: nged kyi phyag rgya chen po nil !d bang las byung ba'i ye shes dang/ /rim pa gnyis kyi ting 'dzin las/ lbyung ba'i rang byung ye shes yin! /'di yi rtogs pa gsang sngags kyil /thabs la mkhas na tshe 'dir 'grub!

Sa Pai:i thus admonishes that one should practice Maha­mudra only by following the teachings of the Anuttarayogatantras. If Mahamudra strictly belongs to Tantric practice, what should one then make of the teachings that say anything to the contrary, in particular the Mahamudra taught by Bsod nams rin chen and his followers? Sa Pary provides his answer to this question in the following passage: such teachings are simply a derivative of Chinese Chan (1�), implying that they are an inferior doctrine that does not accord with the Indian orthodox tradition: There is, in fact, no difference between the present-day Mahiimudrii and the Chine­se tradition of Great Perfection. Only the expressions \"alighting from above\" and \"climbing from below\" have been changed to \"instantaneous\" and \"gradual.\"66 From the above context, it is clear that with the expression \"present-day Mahamudra\" Sa Pary refers to the traditions that teach Mahamudra outside the Tantric context, which at the time only was the Mahamudra system of Bsod nams rin chen and his Bka' brgyud followers.67 Sa Pai:i thus equaled Bka' brgyud Mahamudra with what he calls \"the Chinese tradition of Great Perfection\" (rgya nag lugs kyi rdzogs chen). What is meant by this somewhat odd phrase? In the following passage of the text, Sa Pai:i identifies the phrase as referring to a Chinese doctrine of an instantaneous approach to Awakening, which is said to have been refuted in Tibet by the Indian master Kamalaslla (ca. 740-795). The phrase therefore denotes the teachings of the Chinese Chan master Heshang Maheyan (f[! f5:j�i,ilj 1�J, eighth century, Tibetan hwa shang ma ha ya na), who arrived in Lhasa from the Tibet­occupied Dunhuang region in either 781 or 787 at the invitation of the Tibetan King Khri song lde'u btsan (ca. 742-796).68 Sa Pai:i's use of the term \"Great Perfection\" (rdzogs chen) in the present passage is pecu­liar, since it has the obvious connotation of the Rdzogs chen contemplative system taught in the Tibetan Rnying ma and Bon traditions. Was Sa Pa:i:i thereby implying that the Tibetan Rdzogs chen teachings of his day also were equivalent to Chinese Chan? Neither Sa Pa:i:i's own commentary on the verse nor Go rams pa's exegesis provides any clue on this point, and Wes tern scholars have presented different opinions about the implication of the phrase. 66 A Clear Differentiation, folio 25b: da lta'i phyag rgya chen po dang/ /rgya nag lugs ky i rdzags chen la/ /y as 'bah dang ni mas 'dzegs gnyis/ /rim gyis pa dang cig char bar/ /ming 'dogs bsgyur ha ma gtogs pal /d on la khyad par dbye ha med! 67VAN DER KUIJP (1983:102) has given the same interpretation of these lines when he wrote: \"The context in which this phrase occurs explicitly indicates that certain Bka'-brgyud-pa Mahamudra theories seem to, if not reiterate, then at least unwittingly propagate doctrines, which, according to Sa-skya Pm.ic:lita, bear close resemblances with the Chinese doctrines current in Tibet especially during the eighth century.\" Cf. David P. JACKSON (1994:84). 68 For a description of the influx of Chinese Chan Buddhism in Tibet during the Tibetan Empire, the extant Tibetan sources on Chan, and various traces of Chan doctrines in later Tibetan Buddhism, see, inter alia, HOUSTON (1977), UEYAMA (1981; 1983), FABER (1985), HANSON-BARBER (1985), KARMAY (1985; 1988), STEIN (1971), TANAKA & ROBERTSON (1992), and especially MEINERT (2004) with further bibliographical references."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"56 Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudra On the one hand, KARMAY(l975 : 152-153) understood the phrase as implying that Sa Pai:i also saw Tibetan Rdzogs chen as being a derivative of Chinese Chan, a reading that has since been adopted by DAVIDSON (l98 1b :92) as well. VANDERKUIJP(l983: 102), on the other hand, has called this interpretation into question by arguing that the rhetorical context in which the phrase appears clearly deals with associating Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii with Chinese Chan and if the phrase somehow would imply Tibetan Rdzogs chen rather than Chinese Chan, then Sa Pai:i would, in fact, merely be arguing here that Bka' brgyud Mahii­mudrii would be equivalent to Tibetan Rdzogs chen and not to Chinese Chan , which is clearly not the point that Sa Pa9 wanted to convey.69 Judging from the context, it may be concluded that the phrase primarily refers to Chinese Chan, though it cannot be ruled out that it also hints at a secondary connotation of linking Tibetan Rdzogs chen with Chinese Chan, given the peculiarity of referring to Chan by the name Rdzogs chen, which is highly unusual and was unprecedented in Tibetan writings. Sa Pai:i goes on to say that the only difference between Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii and the Chinese tradition of Great Perfection, i.e., Chinese Chan, is that the phrases \"alighting from above\" (yas 'bab = *shangjiang _t�i) and \"climbing from below\" (mas 'dzegs = *xiadeng T1!) have been changed to \"instantaneous\" (cig char ba) and \"gradual\" (rim gyis pa). In another work entitled Elucidating the Muni's In tention,70 Sa Pai:i explicitly attributes the first set of phrases to an answer that the Chinese Chan teacher Heshang Maheyan is said to have given to the Indian master Kamalasila during the Bsam yas debate: Then the master KamalasTia asked his opponent: How is the Chinese Dhanna tradition? The Chinese master said: Your Dhanna tradition, starting with the taking of refuge and engendering bodhicitta, is an approach of climbing from below (mas 'dzegs), just like a monkey climbs up to a treetop. However, one will not awaken by such Dhanna practices. One will only awaken by realizing the mind through having cultivated non-conceptuality. My Dharma tradition is therefore a Dhanna of alighting from above (yas 'bab), just like a phoenix alighting on a treetop from the sky, and in that sense it is a white panacea (dkar po chig th ub).71 69 See also David P.

For example, the Lha sa manuscript edited by W ANGDU & DIEMBERGER (2000:85) does not speak of \"alighting from above\" but compares the gradual approach to climbing a mountain: \"For instance, if one climbs a mountain, to pass through [the bodhisattva stages] by way of single steps [in order to reach the top] is extremely difficult and there is not [sufficient] power to jump at once [to the top].\" Op.cit., folio 23a1: dp er na ri la 'dzeg na gom pa re res bgrod na dka' che ste! skad cig mchong ba'i mthu med pa dang 'dra bar/.

Sa Pai:i is certainly correct in saying that Maheyan's phrases \"alighting from above\" and \"climbing from below\" do not occur in Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii literature, such as the texts of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum.75 He is also correct in claiming that the latter set of terms, \"instantaneous\" and \"gradual,\" occur frequently in Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii texts. Sa Par:i's claim implies that teachers of the early Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii tradition changed these Chinese Buddhist terms \"alighting from above\" and \"climbing from below\" into Indian Buddhist terms, viz. \"instantaneous\" and \"gradual,\" which -being Indian terms -would seem more palatable to the broader Tibetan Buddhist tradition, thereby concealing the supposed Chinese origin of Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii, given that Chinese Buddhism, ac­cording to Sa Pary, had been refuted in the eighth century at the Bsam yas debate. The logic of Sa Par:i's argument, however, is somewhat odd, because the terms \"instantaneous\" and \"gradual\" are, in fact, not purely Indian terms but are also widely used in medieval Chinese Chan texts to denote sudden (dim �ffii) and gradual (jiim )JWT) approaches to Awakening as represented respectively by the Southern and Northern Chinese traditions of Chan. As attested by several Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts, this Chan distinction was well-known to the Tibetans. In those texts, Tibetan authors spoke of these two Chinese Chan traditions called \"the school of sudden Awakening\" (ston mun pa, dunmenpai �ffi!F, 5JlX) and \"the school of gradual Awakening\" (brtse n mun pa, jianmenpai ilWTF,5JlX) by using the respective phrases \"those [maintaining] an instantaneous approach\" (cig char ba) and \"those [maintaining] a gradual approach\" (rim gyis pa).76 Since the terms \"instantaneous\" and \"gradual\" were equally used in the Chinese Chan tradition, what reason could Sa Par:i possibly have had for postulating that the early Bka' brgyud pas employed these (Indian) terms in order to conceal the alleged Chinese origin of their Mahiimudrii tradition? The reason seems to be that the terms \"instantaneous\" (yugapad) and \"gradual\" (anupilrva or kramqza) not only occur in Chinese Chan literature, but that they also are well-attested in contexts pertaining to cognition, purification, and realization in purely Indian Buddhist the very best capacity.

Sa Pal)'s statement in A Clear Differentiation quoted above remains only a postulate, since he does not offer any form of proof, and it could therefore seem that he merely meant to say that Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii is doctrinally similar to Chinese Chan. Nevertheless, his statement offers a hint that implies otherwise, because the purport of his use of the word \"changed\" (bsgyur ba) literally suggests that Bsod nams rin chen's teaching, in fact, is the teaching of Maheyan in disguise. In the next piece of A Clear Differentiation, Sa Pal) expressed this thought more expli­citly by quoting a prophecy that the Indian master Santarak�ita (died ca. 788) is supposed to have given to King Khri song lde'u btsan: The rise of this kind of Dharma tradition has occurred in accordance with the pre­diction [given] by Bodhisattva Santarak�ita to King Khri song lde'u btsan. Now hear my exposition of this prediction. \"King, here in your country Tibet, non­Buddhists will not appear, since the master Padmasambhava entrusted the country to the Twelve Guardian Goddesses. However, due to certain circumstances, the Dhanna tradition will split in two. After I have passed away, a Chinese monk will first appear and teach an instantaneous approach called The White Panacea (dkar po chig thub ). At that time, you should invite from India my student, the great scholar Kamalasila. When [Kamalasila] has defeated him, you will command: \"The faithful should practice in accordance with his Dharma tradition.\"\" Later everything came to pass just as he had said. After the Chinese tradition had been stopped, the gradualist Dharma tradition flourished. Later on, the imperial reign ceased and simply on the basis of the [still extant] written tradition of the Chinese abbot, [his tradition reappeared] under the new name Maham udrii, keeping its original name secret. Thus, present-day Mahiimudrii is most probably the Chinese Dharma tradition.81 77 See STEIN (1971 :43).

By setting this debate as the supposed historical background, he further maintains that Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii did not originate with Indian Tantric Buddhism but that it was a stealthy revival of the Chinese Chan teaching of Heshang Maheyan . He also asserts that this revivalism was not initiated by any surviving oral transmission of Maheyan's teaching, or -for that matter -by later contacts with contemporaneous Chinese teachers, but rather that Bsod nams rin chen and his followers revived the Chan teaching under the name Mahiimudrii solely by relying on Maheyan's writings. In an open letter written later in order to subs tantiate the critique set forth in A Clear Differentiation, Sa Par,i specified five works by Maheyan that he considered might have formed the textual basis for Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii, although it remains uncertain whether these texts indeed were available in twelfth-century Tibet or whether he merely listed titles that he had seen mentioned in Tibetan his torical records.82 With Sa Pan's reference to King Khri song lde'u btsan's rejection of Chinese Buddhism in Tibet and that the king ordered his subjects to practice the Buddhist Dharma by following the Indian gradualist approach, it finally becomes evident what Sa Pai::i wished to imply by equating Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii doctrine with Chinese Chan.

For a translation of a longer passage from Sa Par.i's letter, see David P. JACKSON ( 1994: 169-1 75). Partial identification of several of these texts with Dunhuang fragments has been given by KARMAY (1975:153-154), Kl.MURA (1981), and VAN DER KuIJP (1984:169-1 70). The Dunhuang manuscripts were walled up in the Mogao Caves (Mogaoku �15]@) near Dunhuang in the early eleventh century and were therefore not likely to have been available to Bsod nams rin chen and his followers as a scriptural basis for reviving Chan in Tibet under the name Mahiimudrii. It remains uncertain whether actual Chinese-Tibetan Chan texts from the eighth-ninth centuries would have been available to the early proponents of Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii. Some fragments of Maheyan's teachings have been preserved in Rnying ma Rdzogs chen literature from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries; see MEINERT (2004)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrf!. 61 what he implies to say is: Bka' brgyud Mahiimudra is anathema, an inferior Dharma tradition that ought not to be practiced in Tibet. It must further be noted that Sa Pary's reference to Maheyan's Chan tradition under the name \"The White Panacea\" (dkar po chig thub, Chinese *iiqietu6 *�DJ f/JOP'8 \"' Sanskrit *aga­da) carries yet another implication. It is not evident that this name was ever a common epithet for Maheyan's doctrine in Tibet during the eighth-ninth centuries but, as argued by DEMIEVILLE (1952: 122) and SEYFORT RUEGG (1989:89), there is evidence to suggest that Maheyan at least made use of some sort of medical metaphor based on the Indian Mahiiparinirvd!iasiitra. Nevertheless, the phrase is attested as a name for Maheyan's Chan doctrine in two Tibetan twelfth-century sources, viz. in Nyang ral Nyi ma 'od zer's history of the Buddhist religion as well as in a version of the Sha bzhed chronicle (VAN DER KUIJP, 1984:178-179; 1986:149,151). While this expression may thus have been known as a name for Maheyan's Chan doctrine in the thirteenth century when Sa Pa� was writing his text, it was at that time also a term that was at least to some extent associated with certain contemporary Bka' brgyud Mahamudra doctrines, because the expression is attested in a couple of works in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum and is especially associated with the Tshal pa Bka' brgyud writings by Bla ma Zhang.83 Sa Pa�'s claim obviously contradicted the Bka' brgyud pa's own view that their Mahii­mudra doctrine had originated with the Indian siddhas, in particular with the Indian teachers of Marpa, viz. Naropa and Maitrlpa. In the next piece of A Clear Differentiation, Sa Pa� consequently set out to argue that these Indian masters exclusively taught the Tantric Mahiimudrii doctrine accepted by Sapa�: Naropa and Maitrlpa only taught Mahamudra as it is expressed in the Tantras of Secret Mantra, namely as karmamudra, dharmamudra, samayamudra, and Maha­mudra. Further, even the noble Nagarjuna said in his treatise on the four mudras (Caturmudra[nifraya]): \"If those unfamiliar with kannamudra also do not know the dhannamudra, it is impossible for them to realize even the mere name of Mahamudra.\" Other texts on the kings of Ta ntra and a number of great treatises also reject any Mahamudra that is not related to the Tantric empowerments. It is first when one has realized the wisdom of Mahamudra that arises from the Tantric empowerments that one should stop relying on all identifiable efforts.84 83 See VAN DER KUIJP (1984: 150), BROIDO (1987), and JACKSON (1994: 149-158). For a study and translation of Bia ma Zhang's main Mahamudra work, see MARTIN (1992). It may be remarked that Bia ma Zhang founded the Tshal pa Bka' brgyud sect, which became a major rival for Sa Pai:i in terms of obtaining political alliances with the powerful Mongols (see STEIN, 1972:76-78). 84 A Clear Differentiation, folios 26ab (pp. 51-52): n 'a ro dang ni me tri pa 'ii !p hyag rgya chen po gang yin pal Ide ni las dang chos dang nil !d am tshig dang ni phyag rgya chef /g sang sngags rgyud nas Ji skad du! /g sungs pa de nyid khong bzhed do! !'phags pa klu sgrub nyid kyis kyang/ lphyag rgya bzhi par 'di skad gsung/ /las kyi phyag rgya mi shes pas/ /chos kyi phyag rgya'ang mi shes na! !p hyag rgya chen po 'i ming tsam yang/ /rtogs pa nyid ni mi srid gsung/ /rgyud kyi rgyal po gzhan dang nil !bstan bcos chen po gzhan las kyang/ !dbang bskur dag dang ma 'brel ba/ Ide la"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"62 Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudrii Sa Pai:i here makes reference to the exact same Indian masters whom Bsod nams rin chen and his followers considered the source for their Mahamudra teaching, namely Naropa and Maitrlpa. To add weight to his argument, Sa Pai:i further quotes the Tantric author Nagarjuna, whom all Tibetan tradition s consider supreme and whom the Bka' brgyud pas consider to be a member of their Indian Mahamudra lineage, namely as a student of the Indian Mahamudra founder Saraha.85 Sa Pai:i further states that many other Indian Tantric texts likewise do not admit any Mahamudra teaching that is not related to the Tantric empowerments. Finally, he rejects the Bka' brgyud Mahamudra contemplative principle of abandoning all contrivance in order to realize the nature of the mind by saying that one should not stop relying on identifiable efforts until one has fully accomplished the wisdom of Mahamudra by practicing the four Tantric empowerments. 'Contrivance' (spros pa, *prapafica) or 'identifiable effort' (mtshan bcas, *salak�fffta) refers in the Tantric context tomaking use of visualization, mantras, and yoga, including the Tantric sexual practices. To sum up Sa Pai:i's critique, three points can be drawn out: (1) Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra approach is at best equivalent to the Madhyamaka meditation of the Common Mahayana, which requires extremely long time to accomplish; (2) it is a disguised revival of the Chinese Chan tradition of Heshang Maheyan; and (3) it does not accord with the authentic Indian tradition, where Mahamudra exclusively was taught in a Tantric context.86 4. A Possible Contemporaneous Indian Instantaneous Approach Sa Pai:i thus criticized the Bka' brgyud pas for propagating and practicing a Mahamudra doctrine that did not adhere to the orthodox Indian Tantric tradition taught by such Indian masters as Nagarjuna, Naropa, and Maitrlpa, and therefore regarded it as an entirely non­Indian system. If Sa Pai:i's critique has historical validity, it establishes a contrast between Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra teaching and the Indian Tantric tradition, which con­sequently raises the questions of what the background and novelty of Bsod nams rin chen's teaching might have been as well as what motive he may have felt in formulating his new approach to Mahiimudra. Sa Pai:i's critique seems to have been right in at least some regards.

For a later Bka' brgyud Mahamudrii text asserting Nagarjuna as a student of Saraha, see, e.g., Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal's large Mahamudra treatise written in 1565 or 1577 (Ox year), entitled Nges don phyag rgya chen po'i sgom rim gsal bar byed pa'i legs bshad zla ba'i 'od zer, TBRC W23447-1898, folio 105b, p. 210; English translation by LHALUNGPA (1986: 1 17). 86 Sa Pal).'s Clear Differentiation continues at this point with a longer criticism of using devotional practices for realizing Mahiimudra in the manner this was first taught by Bsod nams rin chen.

Rather, it seems possible that some Bka' brgyud Mahamudra terms and tropes may have roots in Chinese Chan, perhaps introduced to Bsod nams rin chen's teachings via the early traditions of Tibetan Rdzags chen.87 Nevertheless, it would be highly oversimplified to think that Indian Buddhists only taught the gradual approach to Awakening, whereas the instantaneous approaches exclu­sively were taught by Chinese Buddhists. To demonstrate the complexity and even hybridity of Buddhist doctrines in Tibet at the time when Sa Pa9 wrote his critique, a short contemplative text attributed to the Indian master Sakyasribhadra will be considered next. Sakya5nohadra (died ca. 1225) was a Buddhist scholar-monk from Kasmir, who came to Tibet with a group of Indian monks in 1204 at the invitation of the Bka' brgyud teacher Khro Phu Lotsa ba Byams pa'i dpal (1172-1236). In 1205, Sa Pa9 went to study with Sakya5ribhadra, in particular to learn the Indian treatises on logic and epistemology (tshad ma, pram{i!ia). Sa Pai:i studied with him and his monks for several years and in I 208 Sa Pai:i received full monastic ordination from this Indian master (VAN DER KUIJP, 1994:612). In 1214, Sakyasribhadra returned to Kasmir accompanied by Khro phu Lotsa ba. SakyasrI­bhadra is thus an example of a Kasmirian teacher, considered Indian and therefore orthodox in Tibetan eyes, who taught in Tibet in a number of different sectarian contexts, including those of the Bka' gdams, Bka' brgyud, and Sa skya traditions. From the point of view of Sa Pal)'s criticism that non-Tantric instantaneous approaches are purely Chinese in their origin, it would be expected that Sakyasribhadra's teachings were wholly gradualist. Nevertheless, the Bka' brgyud pas have transmitted a text attributed to Sakyasrlbhadra, which -although not a Mahamudra text per se -seems to be instanta­neous in its meditative approach. The text in question is entitled \"Nine Jewel Pebbles oflnstruction\" (Gdam ngag rin chen 'bru dgu).88 According to its colophon, the text was composed by Sakyasrlbhadra.89 After presenting some preliminaries, the text instructs that the practitioner should go to a remote place free from distractions and relax the body and mind. Then the meditator should pray to the guru and to the meditational deity (yi dam) in order to form a strong resolve for attaining Awakening. The meditator should contemplate death, karman, and suffering to produce a sense of renunciation. Thereafter, the main meditation is explained in the follo­wing words: 87 See David P. JACKSON (1992) for an article that has initiated such a course of investigation. 88 The text is found in Nges don phyag rgya chen po'i kh rid mdzad, edited by Zhwa dmar pa Mi pham chos kyi blo gros, New Delhi 1997, TBRC W23447, vol. 2 (A(1), folios 44b-48b (pp. 88-96). 89 The colophon mentions no date, place, or circumstance for its composition. It only says: \"The Nine Jewel Pebbles of Instruction composed by the great scholar of Kasmir Sakyasribhadra is finished.\" Folio 48b5: !g dam ngag rin chen 'bru dgu ::,he bya ba kha che'i pa!ic/i ta chen po shakya shrf bha dras mdzad pa rdzags sol/."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"64 Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's MahZimudriJ When letting whatever is perceived just be, accomplishment happens spontaneous­ly without acting. When perceiving the essence of all that arises, awareness becomes liberated by itself. When cutting off the trace of movement, thinking subsides in space. Since these three are the nature of the mind, cultivate them as the main meditation.90 These verses explain what appears to be an instantaneous approach to A wakening. This becomes especially clear when the explanatory prose section, which follows in the text, is taken into consideration. One of the given prose explanations states that \"the uncontrived awareness itself is buddha\" (ma bcos pa'i rig pa nyid sangs rgyas yin) and it is said that the meditator should practice compassion and insight instantaneously (cig car du) in unison, like the two wings of a bird. It is also instructed that emptiness and compassion are to be perfected as being of one taste (ro gcig, *ekar asa): The uncontrived awareness itself is buddha. [The meditator] should never become distracted from [this] object [of meditation]. When he focuses attentively on the instruction of recognizing awareness in this manner, then - as [the meditator] gains familiarity therewith - any form of awareness that appears will become liberated in and of itself. . . . In spite of having meditated on emptiness combined with engendering compassion toward those without reali-zation thereof, most practitioners do not know how to make [this experience] continuous.

Thereafter, letting the meditation become relaxed, he should practice them instantaneously in unison, like the [two] wings of a bird. In general, a crucial key point [of the practice] is to mix emptiness and compassion as much as possible until they become perfected as being of a single taste and then rest in a meditative absorption therein.91 Several key terms in the passage, including \"uncontrived awareness\" (ma bcos pa'i rig pa, *ak!trimavidyii), \"instantaneously\" (cig car du, *yugapad), and \"one taste\" (ro gcig, *eka-90 Gdam ngag rin chen 'bru dg u, folio 46a (p. 91): cir snang rang sar gzhag na bya bra! lhun gyis grub/ /g ang shar ngo bo gzung na rig pa rang sar grol/ /'gyu ba'i rtsad rj es chod na dran rtog dbyings su ya!/ !'di gsum rang sems gnas lugs yin pas dngos gzhir bsgom/. 91 Op.cit: 46b-47b (pp. 92-94): ma bcos pa'i rig pa nyid sangs rgyas yin/ yul dus nam yang de las ma g.yos sol Id es na rig pa ngos 'dzin gyi man ngag dran pas bzung la/ de bsgoms pas gang shar gyi rig pa thams cad rang gis rang nyid la rang grol du 'gyur ro/ I ... ls grub pa po phal cher gyis stong pa nyid bsgom pa'i zhor la de ma rtogs pa'i yul la snying rj e skyes kyang/ de don du mi gnyer bas rgyun mthud mi shes/ der thabs shes kyi nyam !en shed ma mthud pas theg pa ch en po 'i lam mthar than par dka' ba yin/ ... goms pa zhan pa mams kyis de gnyis ma goms pa !tar re mos kyis zung 'jug dang/ goms pa klod du gyur pas bya'i gshog pa !tar cig car du zung 'jug tu nyams su blang/ spyir stong nyid snying rj e ro gcig tu mthar phyin par 'gyur ba ci nus kyis bsre zhing mnyam par 'jog pa'i gnad gal che/."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudr(j 65 rasa), are highly reminiscent of corresponding Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii formulations. Even though the text never actually employs the word Mahiimudrii, it may be observed that it teaches a meditative approach that is quite similar to the system introduced by Bsod nams rin chen and his successors. The text's similarity to Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii obviously raises the question whether it at all was composed by Sakyasribhadra, as its colophon suggests, or whether it is an apo­cryphal pseudepigraph wrongly attributed to him.92 The text was never accepted widely e nough for it to gain canonical status by being included in the Bstan 'gyur, unlike so many other works by Sakyasribhadra now found in the Tibetan canon.93 The Bka' brgyud pas, however, seem to have considered it an authentic work, because the seventh Karma pa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454-1506) included it along with three other short texts ascribed to Sakyasribhadra in his three-volume compilation entitled \"The Indian Mahiimudrii Treatises\" (Phyag rgya chen po'i rgya gzhung).94 The other three texts by Sakyasribhadra found in Chos grags rgya mtsho's compilation are of less consequence to the present analysis and need not be considered here.95 92 It may, for example, be noted that David P. JACKSON (1994:68-70) in a different context has suggested that SakyasrTuhadra held a negative opinion about Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii, but JACKSON has not offered any textual proof for this claim. 93 The Beijing and Sde dge Bstan 'gyurs contain at least fifteen works authored by him. 94 On the seventh Karma pa Chos grags rgya mtsho being the editor of this compilation, see folio 3a2_4 of the compilation's dkar chags entitled Gnas lugs phyag rgya chen po 'i rgya gzhung glegs bam gsum yi ge'i 'byung gnas su ji !tar bkod pa'i dkar chags bzhugs byang mdor bsdus pa sgrub brgyud grub pa'i ma rgyan. According to its colophon (folio 42a, p. 83), the dkar chags was written by Karma Bkra shis chos 'phel (b. nineteenth century) in the vicinity of Dpal spungs monastery in Sde dge. Karma Bkra shis chos 'phel's dkar chags is a redaction of an earlier work first written in the eighteenth century. It was possibly produced in connection with the Dpal spungs printing of the seventh Karma pa's compilation, a print which the dkar chags mentions was made at the occasion of a teaching and recitation-transmission (bklags lung) performed at Dpal spungs monastery by 'Jam mgon Kong sprul Blo gros mtha' yas (1813-1899). Meanwhile, the Dpal spungs print of the seventh Karma pa's compilation has recently been incorporated as a facsimile into a larger compilation of both Indian and Tibetan Mahiimudrii works entitled Nges don phyag rgya chen po'i khrid mdzod (TBRC W23447, see fn. 88 above) edited and published by the fourteenth Zhwa dmar pa Mi pham chos kyi blo gros (1952-2014). The Indian treatises (rgya gzhung) make up the first three volumes of this new compilation bearing the sub-title Phyag rgya chen po'i rgya gzhung. As a digression, it may further be remarked that Karma Bkra shis chos 'phel's dkar chags does not include Sakyasrlbhadra's text in his listing of the contents of the second volume (A(1) on folio 23a6 (p. 45), but on folio 26b1 (p. 52) he instead enumerates all four of SakyasrTuhadra's works when listing the contents of the compilation's third and last volume (Hudi), including the above-cited work. It is therefore concei­vable that it was Bkra shis chos 'phel's intention that all the four works by Sakyasrlbhadra found in this compilation ought to have been kept together in the third volume, instead of being scattered across the second and third volume as is now the case. 95 These works are: (1-2) two short non-canonical sets of verses supposed to have appeared mira­culously out of the sky during Sakyasrlbhadra's funeral entitled \"Verses that Appeared in the Sky\""},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"66 Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahclmudrii Further, there seems to have existed another text attributed to Sakyasr!bhadra, which contained explanations on an instantaneous approach. This is a text referred to in other sources under the title \"The Nine Golden Syllables\" (Gser gyi yi ge 'bru dgu pa). It has not been possible to locate this work anywhere, but the seventh Karma pa gave the following reference to it in one of his own works entitled \"A Mahamudrii Instruction given by the Seventh Rgyal ba [Karmapa]\" (Rgyal ba bdun pas stsal ba'i phyag rgya chen po zhal gdams): There are very many authentic treatises [that praise non-analytical meditation as the highest] ... such as [the writings by] the great scholar Sakyasrl[bhadra], who in \"The Nine Golden Syllables\" said that analytical meditation relying on various forms of reasoning, such as [the Madhyamaka argument of] neither being one nor many, is a practice [intended] for those of mediocre capacity, whereas uncontrived meditation, wherein whatever arises is left uncon-trived, is a practice for those of the highest capacity.96 This reference likewise indicates a Bka' brgyud interpretation or transmission of an instantaneous approach taught by Sakyasr!bhadra. Given the limited circulation and non-canonical status of these texts attributed to Sakyasrlbhadra as well as the extant text's use of what appears to be Bka' brgyud Mahii­mudrii terminology, the works may be suspected of being pseudepigraphs that were not actually taught by the widely respected Indian master Sakyasr!bhadra. In fact, there is currently no philological evidence for their authenticity other than the above-cited colophon found in \"The Nine Jewel Pebbles of Instruction.\" Nevertheless, there are two arguments that should be considered as weighing in favor of the authenticity of the two cited texts. First, if these texts were forged by some Bka' brgyud pa writers in order to lend support to the notion that a highly acclaimed Indian master, Sakyasribhadra, taught an instantaneous approach, it would be expected that the texts would be sufficiently explicit on this point to warrant such support. Nevertheless, \"The Nine Jewel Pebbles\" never uses the actual word Mahamudra, which weakens its support for claiming any Indian origin for the Bka' brgyud (Nam mkha' la byon pa'i tshigs su bead pa) and \"[A Poem] with Seven Branches that Appeared from a Rumbling Cloud\" (Chu 'dzin gyi nga ro las byung ba'i yan lag bdun pa) found in Nges don phyag rgya chen po'i khrid mdzad, vol. 2 (A(1), folios 48b-50a, pp. 96-99; and (3) two verses explaining the inseparability of emptiness and compassion entitled \"Instruction in the Pure View and Conduct\" (Lta spyod mam dag gi man ngag, *Vi§uddhadar.fonacaryopade.fo) found in vol. 3 (Hitdi), folios 193b-194a, pp. 470-471) said to have been translated by Khro phu lotsa ba at Khro phu monastery in the presence of Sakyasrlbhadra himself.

Secondly, if the texts were forged in order to support an Indian origin for Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii, it would be expected that the texts would have been cited i n the extensive doctrinal defenses of Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii that are found in seve­ral apologetic passages in sixteenth-century Mahiimudrii works, such as those written by Kun mkhyen Padma dkar po (1527-1592) or Sgam po Bkra shis mam rgyal (1513-1587).97 While i t may be tempting simply to write off Sakyasrlbhadra's texts as being inauthentic pseudepigrapha given that they fit so poorly into the simple exegetical schematics presented by S a Pai:i, it is, in fact, not entirely inconceivable that Sakyasr!bhadra may have taught different approaches in different sectarian contexts and could have been inclined to teach an instantaneous approach to someone like his personal translator Khro phu lotsa ba. After all, Khro phu lotsa ba was a Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii practitioner in his own right and he was Sakyasr!bhadra's main host and translator in Tibet. If it is accepted that the Indian master Sakyasrlbhadra taught a non-Tantric instanta­neous approach resembling Bka' brgyud Mahamudrii -and, granted, this may be a very big if -these teachings suggest a much more complex situation than that depicted by Sa Pai:i. Indian teachers, who visited Tibet and who were thereby themselves exposed to Tibetan doctrines on instantaneous approaches to A wakening, may have felt inclined to give their own non-Tantric teachings on instantaneous meditation. Examples of such teachers might include Sakyasr1bhadra and, somewhat earlier, Pha dam pa Sangs rgyas (eleventh-twelfth centuries) who likewise is known to have taught Mahiimudrii in Tibet. While such Indian attestations do not exempt Bsod nams rin chen's teachings from all the points raised in Sa Pai:i's critique claiming that his teaching was a novelty which had not been taught within the orthodox Indian Tantric traditions, they at least indicate that the doctrinal situation in thirteenth-century Tibet when Sa Pai:i wrote his criticism was far from a simple and clear­cut dichotomy between Indian authenticity versus less-authentic Chinese derivation. Rather, it seems that a number of instantaneous contemplative approaches had developed independ­ently in different Buddhist contexts and localities in India, China, and Tibet from the eighth and ninth centuries onwards. While it is possible to discuss the origin or sources of inspiration for Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra in terms of the complexity and hybridity of the religious trends in twelfth-century Tibet, it must at the same time be kept in mind that the Bka' brgyud tradition perceived itself as being of wholly Indian origin, including its Mahiimudrii 97 Padma dkar po defended the Indian origin of Bka' rgyud Mahiimudrii especially in his \"Repo­sitory of Mahiimudra \" (Phyag chen gan mdzod); see BROIDO (1987).

Bka' brgyud masters of the twelfth-thirteenth centuries claimed their tradition to have been derived from the some of the most respected masters of Indian Tantra, espe­cially from Mar pa's Indian teachers Naropa and Maitrlpa. Hence, to comprehend the continuity or novelty of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra teachings, it is next necessary to turn to these Indian teachers in order to consider whether they, as claimed by the Bka' brgyud pas, ever taught a non-Tantric form of Mahamudra, or whether they, as claimed by Sa Pa9, only taught Mal@nudra within a strictly Tantric context. If they did teach a non­Tantric form of Mahamudrii, it is, moreover, necessary to consider whether their Indian teachings were of direct relevance to the Mahiimudrii doctrine of Bsod nams rin chen. 5. Maitrfpa -A Possible Point of Departure When did Mahiimudra begin to break away from Tantrism and come to be practiced independently in a doctrinal context that may be viewed as being more in line with the Common Mahayana teachings? The answer to this question pertains to a larger movement in Indian Buddhism towards synthesizing the Tantric and the Common Mahayana teach­ings, which was underway in the eleventh century when the second wave (phyi dar) of Buddhism was being introduced in Tibet. This has, e.g., been noted by HOOKHAM (1991: 171): Fortunately for Buddhism, the time of these synthesizing developments coincided with the second wave of Tibetan translators and scholars who were reintroducing Buddhism to Tibet in the eleventh century. Thus, the Tibetans were able to preser­ve not only the work of synthesis already begun but also to build on that work. SAMUEL (1993 :412) has characterized the nature of this synthesis in terms of how the counter-cultural practices of the Anuttarayogatantras were gradually absorbed into the Indian Buddhist monastic centers during this time: The Kriya and Carya [Tantras] ... probably grew up as an extension of ritual, yogic, and devotional tendencies already present within the Mahayana. They would certainly have been the forms that could most easily be absorbed into the ritual life and practice of established monastic communities. If [the archaeologist Nancy] Hock's interpretation is correct, they were an important part of the ritual life and practice of some of these communities by the eighth and the ninth centuries. The Anuttarayoga tantra practices, by contrast, seem to have remained outside the monastic context until very late. They remained the preserve of siddha-style practitioners .. ., who seem ... to have formed small cult-groups of wandering yogins and yoginis. It seems that it was only at the end of the period we are considering, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, that these practices were taken up openly within the monasteries and the large monastic universities that had by then grown up."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's MahZimudi;ii 69 Buddhist Tantrism or Vajrayiina surfaced as a religious subculture in India between the fourth to the sixth centuries CE98 and appears from its earliest days to have consisted of two parallel developments. On the one hand, there was a ritualistic development of invoking various buddhas and bodhisattvas, which possibly evolved as an extension of Mahiiyiina Sittra practices performed within the Buddhist monasteries. On the other hand, a Tantric subculture emerged outside the monastic establishment, practiced by ascetics and laity called yogins, tiintrikas, or siddhas, who attempted to attain Awakening through a number of unconventional techniques that often involved sexuality, the drinking of alcohol, an d other behaviors prohibited within the monasteries. In the twelfth century, Tibetan scholars systematized and thereby historicized these two developments into a system of four Tantra classes (rgyud sde bzhi).99 The first ritualistic trend was represented in the two lower Tantra classes called 'Ritual Tantra' (kriyiitantra, bya rgyud) and 'Conduct Tantra' (caryiitantra, spyod rgyud), while the second more unconventional trend was contained in the two higher Tantra classes respectively called 'Practice Tantra' or 'Union Tantra' (yogatantra, rnal 'byor rgyud) and 'Unparalleled Practice Tantra' or 'Unparalleled Union Tantra' ( *anuttarayoga­tantra or niruttarayogatantra, bla med rgyud). SAMUEL (1993:413) explains: We can therefore suppose that Buddhist Tantra developed in two parallel contexts. In the monastic context, and perhaps also that of settled urban and village lay communities of religious practitioners, ritual and yogic practices based on the external visualization of deities became more and more important, perhaps from the fourth and fifth centuries onwards .. , This corresponds to Hock's 'Mantrayana' and to the Kriya and Carya Tantras of the later Tibetan tradition. In the other context, small cult-groups of wandering ascetics whose practices involved identification with deities and the niicji-priir:za (Tibetan tsa-lung) techniques devel­oped around the same time ... This pattern drew in part on the already-established practices of tribal and folk shamans. It corresponds to the Yoga and Anuttarayoga Tantras and to Hock's 'Vajrayana'. During the tenth and eleventh centuries, the subculture of the Tiintrikas gradually merged with the more widely acknowledged culture of Common Mahiiyiina that was studied and practiced within the curriculum of the monastic establishment. In the process of this merger, the subculture had to conform to the culture, which meant that less emphasis came to be put on the more unconventional antinomian aspects of the Anuttarayogatantra s, such as their sexual practices. Instead, a stronger emphasis came to be laid on Mahiimudrii, which as the highest and final level of the Anuttarayogatantras was an instantaneous approach that did not involve any ritual or controversial activity whatsoever. Still, in the Anuttarayogatantras the instantaneous approach of Mahiimudrii was only taught as the culmination of the 98 On dating the beginning of Buddhist Tantra in India, see, inter alia, HUNTINGTON (1987), SAMUEL (1993:41 1-412), and DAVIDSON (2002:25ff.).

Thus, prior to this merger, Mahiimudrii was strictly taught in the context of the four mudriis, as it was indeed maintained by Sa Pa9 in his criticism discussed above.100 Since Tantric sexual practices were irreconcilable with the monastic regulations of celibacy, Tantric practice had to change. Its taboo-breaking aspects became enmeshed in ritual, whereafter the offensive parts came to be expressed only symbolically. At the same time, the instantaneous approach of Mahiimudrii gradually became separated from its Tan­tric context, which permitted celibate monk-practitioners to meditate on the essence of the Tantras without having to perform the preceding stages of Tantric sexual yoga. Both these new developments first became really pronounced in the Tibetan forms of Vajrayiina Buddhism. As for the ritual development, SAMUEL (1993:413) writes: A gradual synthesis between the Mantrayana [i.e., the Kriya-and Caryatantras] and Vajrayana [i.e., the Yoga-and Anuttarayogatantras] trends developed ... , and was widely represented by the tenth and eleventh centuries. The differences between the two bodies of material were already lessening at this time, and were to become still weaker in Tibet, where identification with the deity would become common even within the Kriya and Ca1ya Tantras, and the elaborate ritual of Kriya and Ca1ya would be adapted to the Yoga and Anuttarayoga Tantra. The other development of separating Mahiimudrii from its Tantric context is exactly what is found in the case of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii doctrine. Is it therefore possible that Sa Pa9's more orthodox Mahiimudrii view was derived from a stage of Indian Tantrism that was earlier than Bsod nams rin chen's more liberal view? A pertinent watershed in the history of Tantric Buddhism is the north-Indian Mahiimudrii teacher Maitr\"lpa (ca. 1010-1087).101 100 The sixteenth-century Tibetan author Sgam po Bkra shis mam rgyal has argued in his Nges don phyag rgya chen po 'i sgom rim gsal bar byed pa 'i legs bshad zla ba'i 'od zer (folio 90b2ff , p. 180; LHALUNGPA, 1986:101-102) that the Indian Kalacakratantra is an exception to the rule that Maha­mudra only was taught in the Indian Ta ntras within the framework of the four mudras, because the Kalacakratantra teaches bliss (dga' ba, ananda) to be an innate quality of the mind and not just something that is artificially produced by the Tantric methods of sexual union with the karmanwdra. The consequence of this subtle point seems to be that the Kalacakratantra implies an instantaneous approach to innate bliss that - theoretically speaking - might be equalled with a view of Mahamudrii where Mahamudra is not simply the culmination of the four mudra framework. Yet, if Bkra shis rnam rgyal is correct in this assertion, the difference he points out between the Kalacakratantra and the other Anuttarayogatantras only supports the historical point that a stronger emphasis came to be laid on instantaneous approaches during the eleventh-century epoch of synthesizing the Tantric subculture with the monastic culture of the Common Mahayana, because the Kalacakratantra is generally considered to be the latest among the Anuttarayogatantras in that it possibly first appeared in the early eleventh century. For the dating of the Kalacakratantra, see NEWMAN (1998:342-343) and KRAGH (2010:200). 101 These dates are given by ROERICH (1949:841-842) in Th e Blue Annals.

He is said later to have redisco­vered the important but hitherto lost Buddhist treatise Ratnagotravibhiiga (a.k.a. the *Mahayanottaratantrasastra, Rgyud bla ma) in a stupa. He is then said to have propagated this text widely, for example teaching it to the Kasmlrian scholar Sajjana (fl. eleventh century) and possibly also to Atifa, who both were involved in the transmission of this text to Tibet. 103 The Ratnagotravibhiiga is a major treati se on the notion of buddha-nature, which represents an important doctrinal bridge between the philosophy of the Common Mahiiyiina and the Anuttaray ogatantras. The text is also said to have been important for Bsod nam s rin chen's formulation of Mahamudrii, since Bsod nams rin chen is reported to have said to his student Phag mo gru pa Rdo rje rgyal po that \"the basic text of our Mahiimudrii doctrine is the *Mahayanottaratantrasiistra composed by Bhagavan Mai­treya.\" 104 Given that Maitripa was particularly concerned with bridging the teachings of the Common Mahayana and the Tantras and given this text's importance as a link between these two systems of doctrine and practice, it is certainly quite an astonishing coincidence that it was exactly Maitripa who accidentally rediscovered this lost text and brought its teachings back to life. Maitripa is also said to have revived the Buddhist Apabhraryifa tradition of the mystical songs (Doha) by the two siddhas Saraha and Sabari after he had obtained their transmission in a vision.105 Subsequently, Maitripa composed several Tantric works, including some commentaries on the Buddhist Dohas as well as twenty-six short texts, which the Tibetans later compiled into a corpus called \"The Teaching Cycle on Non-Cognition\" (Yid la mi byed pa 'i chos skor, or alternatively, a ma na si kii ra'i chos skor). 106 lo ), and the identification of MaitrTpa's dates is questionable (see TATZ, 1987:697-698).

The first 18 texts of the cycle explain a number of Anuttarayo gatantra concepts in terms of Common Mahayana doctrine, particularly the Madhyamaka philosophy of emptiness (.Si\"\"inyata, stong pa nyid). The explanations employ several doctrinal terms that later reappear in Tibetan Mahamudra instructions, including a key concept discussed extensively by Maitripa called \"non-cognition\" (amanasikara, yid la mi byed pa). The term here refers to a meditative state wherein the mind abstains from engaging in dualistic thought proces­ses or 'cognitions' (manaskara or manasikara, yid la byed pa).107 The cycle also contains explanations (e.g., the text \"Five Verses on No Separation,\" Nirbhedapaficaka) that incor­porate the notion of buddha-nature, as well as teachings (e.g., \"The Jewel Rosary on Reality,\" Tattvaratnavalf) that come close in meaning to the later Tibetan doctrine of ex­trinsic emptiness (gzhan stong). The most well-known text of the cycle is probably \"Ten Verses on Reality \" (Tattva­dafaka, De kho na nyid bcu pa), wherein Maitripa explains Tantric concepts, such as 'radiance' (prabhasvara, 'od gsal), through the Madhyamaka philosophy of emptiness. It should, however, be noted that Maitripa never actually employs the word Mahamudra in the first 18 texts of the cycle, though he several times explains various terms that are echoed in later Bka' brgyud Mahamudra doctrines. This is, for example, the case in \"Elucidating Reality \" (Tattvaprakafa, De kho na nyid rab tu bstan pa), where Maitripa lays out an instantaneous approach to Awakening while pointing out how it accords with the Madhyamaka view of Nagarjuna, albeit without referring to this approach as Mahamudra. In the last eight texts of the cycle, Maitripa explains the in structions of the Anuttara­yogatantras, particularly the phases of Tantric empowerment. There the word Mahamudra occurs, but only in the context of the four mudras. Hence, it does not seem that Maitripa explicitly taught Mahamudra independently of the Tantras, although he certainly partook in a broader trend of synthesizing what later became Mahamudra terminology with Common Mahayana philosophy, and he also seems to have taught instantaneous approaches to Awa­kening without referring to these as Mahamudra. by the MIKKYO SEITEN KENKYUKAI study group under the general title Adva.vavajrasm!1graha (1988: texts (1), (3) and (15); 1989: texts (18), (21) and (4); 1990: texts (6), (9), (12), (22), and (20); and 1991: texts (23), (5), (14), (7), (11), (2), and (8)). 107 Generally speaking, manaskara (yid la byed pa, ff'.¥'. zuoyi) occurs in Buddhist Abhidharma literature as a term denoting the mental factor (caitta , sems byung) of directing the intellect towards an object perceived by the senses and labeling it with a name. It is variously translated as 'attention', 'mental orientation', or 'mindfulness'. The Abhidharma definition of the term is \"exertion with the mind\" (cetasa abhoga(1); see KRAMER (2013:1014).

In two articles (2006, 2007), MATHES has argued that the Tibetan doctrine of \"Siltra Mahamudrii,\" which is a label used in later Tibetan sources for the non-Tantric Mahiimudrii approach, was already present in the writings by Maitripa and his direct stu­dents. That is a view that is generally upheld by the Tibetan Bka' brgyud traditions. MATHES (2006:225) concluded that \"it should no longer be maintained that not­specifically-Tantric mahiimudrii is a later Tibetan invention.\" There are, though, some points in MATHES' argument that need to be revisited. As mentioned above, while Maitripa's works clearly belong to a trend of synthesizing Tantric philosophical doctrines and terminology with teachings of the Common Mahayana, Maitripa did not apply the word Mahamudrii to this amalgam but only referred to Mahiimudrii in its Tantric context of the four mudri'is. It is also important to note that while Maitripa did indeed speak of a non-Tantric direct approach to Awakening which was not specified as 'Mahiimudra', he did not present this approach along the broad lines seen in the later well-known Tibetan Mahamudrii divisions of practice, such as the four yogas, etc., or by using other major characteristic features of the Tibetan Sutra Mahamudra systems. It might therefore be somewhat overstated to say that a direct equivalent to Tibetan Satra Mahi'imudra is found in Maitripa's writings, even if some terminological and doctrinal precursors definitely occur. In his study, MATHES discusses several of Maitripa's texts, but the sources he cites either do not employ the word Mahiimudrii (e.g., Maitripa's Tattvadasaka) or only use the word in its Tantric sense where reliance on sexual practice with a karmamudrii in order to realize Mahiimudrii is presupposed (e.g., Maitripa's *Sekanirdefa).108 As rightly noted by MATHES (2007:553-555) in his second article, the *Sekanirde§a is a strictly Tantric work. Nevertheless, when discussing the text MATHES concludes that Indian masters taught a form of Mahamudrii that may be culti vated without relying on the Tantric practice of the four mudriis. He does not arrive at this interpretation on the basis of the text itself or any related Indian source, but instead refers to the opinion of a modern Tibetan informant (MATHES, 2007:fn. 47). Such an approach to reading medieval Indian texts runs the risk of anachronistically superimposing later Tibetan outlooks on the Indian sour ces, yet it seems that it is this opinion which comes to serve as the basic premise in the overall argument of MATHES' article. 1 08 The *Sekanirde§a is another name for the Sekanin:wya listed among Maitr!pa's works in fn. 106. MATHES adduces two passages that employ the label Mahiimudrii from the Tattvadafokaffka composed by Maitr!pa's student Sahajavajra. However, the first passage (MATHES, 2006:219) only contains the word Mahamudra in a quotation from Maitr!pa's *Sekanirdefo, which as mentioned is a purely Tantric work. In the second passage (MATHES, 2006:221 bottom), the word Mahamudra occurs in a verse quoted in the Ta ttvada§akaffka from an unidentified source, and since it is thus unknown whether the provenance of the verse is Tantric or non-Tantric, it is presently not possible fully to assess in what sense and in which original context the word is used in the quotation."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudr!J 75 In the course of his detailed analysis, which -it should be noted -gives due conside­ration to many pertinent sources, MATHES locates two passages in works not authored by Maitr1pa that indeed speak of non-Tantric meditative approaches that are explicitly labeled 'Mahamudrii'. Although the two short passages in question do not provide sufficient detail to permit a broader comparison to Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudra doctrine, they definitely establish that it was not unheard of in Indian circles to use the label Mahiimudrii when speaking of non-Tantric practices. The ear liest such passage cited by MATHES (2006:223-224) comes from Jfianakfrti's Tattvavatara, 109 where an advanced non-Tantric form of Piiramitayana practice is referred to as Mahiimudra . . The second passage (MATHES, 2006:220-221) stems from the Tattvadafoka_tfka composed by Maitr1pa's student Sahajavajra.110 The passage speaks of an approach that neither belongs to the Tantric Mantra tradition nor to the Paramitiiyiina, and Sahajavajra ends the passage by saying: \"Some call this Mahiimudrii, the wisdom of reality\" ('di nyid la de kho na nyid kyi ye shes phyag rgya chen po zhes kha cig brjod). In Indian and Tibetan sources, the use of the pronoun 'some' (kha cig, ke cid or kas cid) often marks a rhetorical statement, in which the author distances himself from what is said by attributing it to some­one else. Hence, it could seem that Sahajavajra here speaks of an Indian non-Tantric usage of Mahamudrii which he reports to have existed but which is not wholly identical to his own contemplative tradition.111 MATHES' analysis has thus established that there were rare, isolated Indian cases of using the otherwise Tantric word Mahiimudrii in its contemplative sense as referring to ad­vanced non-Tantric stages of meditation. 1 09 D3709, Q4532 translated into Tibetan probably in the early eleventh century by Rin chen bzang po (958- 1055) in collaboration with the Kashmiri an scholar Padmakaravarman. The passage was previously cited as evidence for an Indian non-Tantric Mahiimudrii teaching by the fifteenth­century Tibetan scholar 'Gos lotsa ba Gzhon nu dpal (1392-148 1) (MATHES, 2007:545). 110 The text is only extant in its Tibetan translation (D2254, Q3099). It should be noted that the work spuriously quotes a passage from the Bhiivaniikrama (see MATHES, 2006:217), a text which was composed in Tibet in the late eighth century by the Indian master Kamalaslla, who never retur­ned to India after having arrived to Tibet. While the Bhiivaniikrama certainly is extant in a Sanskrit manuscript from Tibet as well as in a partial Chinese translation, no Sanskrit manuscript of the work has ever been found outside Tibet. Hence, it is rather questionable whether the text was known and quoted by later authors living in India who did not visit Tibet, such as Sahajavajra. There may consequently be reason to look closer at the authenticity of Sahajavajra's commentary and consider the possibility that certain passages, perhaps also the text's reference to a non-Tantric form of Mahii­mudrii, could be later Tibetan interpolations. 111 Given the above-mentioned reservation about the authenticity of the full text of Sahajavajra's commentary, it is equally possible that the sentence is a later Tibetan interpolation, in which case the word 'some' would refer to \"some Tibetans\", i.e., the Bka' brgyud pas. As noted by MATHES (2006:223), Sahajavajra does not mention such a \"third path\" of Mahiimudrii in his other extant writing, the Sthitisamuccaya."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"76 Chapter 2: The Critical Reception of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudril There is, however, a more fundamental difficulty in MATHES' line of argument when it comes to establishing a connection between the Indian sources and the beginnings of \"Sutra Mahiimudrii \" in Tibet, i.e., the teachings by Bsod nams rin chen and his immediate fol­lowers. The problem is that the texts stemming from the Indian circle of Maitripa and his students are hardly ever referred to in the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um, let alone commented upon or quoted from. The only references to these texts that occur in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum are a few general remarks mentioning that the works of Maitripa are examples of the (Indian) scriptural basis for (Tibetan) Mahiimudrii. For example, in the text \"Answers to the Ques­tions of Master Phag mo Grub pa,\" Bsod nams rin chen is reported to have said to Rdo rje rgyal po: These [Indian] works teaching Mahamudra, such as the Dohas and the three cycles of the new [Tantras], ... 112 The phrase \"the three cycles of the new [Tantras]\" (gsar ma skor gsum) is a standard term referring to three key cycles of Indian texts dealing with the essential meaning of the Anut­tarayogatantras and their practices. The three cycles in question are \"The Seven (or eight) Siddhi Texts\" (Grub pa sde bdun or Grub pa sde brgyad),113 \"The Cycle of Six Heart 112 Rj e phag mo grub pa'i zhus Ian (DK.A.Da.7.10a2), DK.A.Da.13b: do ha dang/ gsar ma skor gsum la so gs pa'i phyag rgya chen po'i gzhung 'di tsho/. 1 13 The seven Siddhi texts (Grub pa sde bdun, *Saptasiddhi) constitute an important group of Indian Tantric works. The term Grub pa sde bdun occurs several times in Dags po'i bka' 'bum, al­though the concrete contents of the list are not provided there. Bu ston Rin chen grub (1290-1 364) used the related term \"the eight Siddhi texts\" (Grub pa sde brgyad, *A�,tasiddhi) in his bstan 'gy ur catalog, where the list of texts includes: (1) Padmavajra's Guhyasiddhi (Q3061, D2217); (2) Anailgavajra's Prajiiopayavini§cayasiddhi (Q3062, D22 l 8); (3) Indrabhiiti 's Jiianasiddhi (Q3063, D2219); (4) Lak�ml's Advayasiddhi (Q3064, D2220); (5) Ul avajra's *Vyaktabhavasiddhi; (6) Dari­ka's Mahaguhyatattvopadesa (Q3065, D2221); (7) SahajayoginI Cinta's Vy aktabhavanugata­tattvasiddhi (Q3066, D2222); and :porpbhi Heruka's Sahajasiddhi (Q3067, D2223).

Bu ston thinks that these texts ought to be studied in the particular progression in which he lists them and he also presents their authors as standing in successive teacher-student relationships. The fifth text in Bu ston's list, i.e., the *Vyaktabhavasiddhi (Dngos po gsal ba grub pa) by LI!avajra (Sgeg pa'i rdo rj e), does not seem to be contained in the Q or D redactions of the bstan 'gyur. A modem compilation with Sanskrit editions of *A�tasiddhi texts has been published by SAMDHONG & DWIVEDI (1987). Their list of eight works includes: (I) Padma­vajra's Guhyasiddhi, (2) Anailgavajra's Prajfiopayavinifrayasiddh i, (3) Indrabhiiti's Jnana-siddhi, (4) Lak�ml's Advayasiddhi, (5) YoginI Cinta's Vy aktabhavanugatatattvasiddhi, (6) :porpbhi Heruka's Sahajasiddhi, (7) Kuddalapada's Acintyadvayakramopade§a, and (8) Padmavajra's Advayavivara�w­prajfi.opayavini§cayasiddhi.

In spite of the noticeable absence of more numerous references to Maitrlpa's writings in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, it is clear that the later Tibetan tradition considered these textual cycles to be central for the Tibetan Mahiimudrii transmission. For example, The Blue An­nals refer to Maitrlpa's tradition when defending the Mahiimudrii doctrine of Bsod nams rin chen, in that it references Sahajavajra's commentary on Maitrlpa's Tattvadafaka: Now, during the time of Mar pa and Mi la ras pa, the understanding of Mahiimudrii was ascribed to the [Tantric] Completion Stage (sampannakrama), in that an understanding derived from [the yoga of] Inner Heat (gtum mo) was produced first and based thereon an understanding of Mahiimudra was subsequently brought about [in the student] . Dags po'i rin po che (i.e., Bsod nams rin chen) caused an understanding of Mahiimudra to arise even in beginners who had not received [Tantric] empowerment. This is called the Paramita method (i.e., the Common Mahayana) ... With regard to this, though the Dharma Master Sa skya pa (i.e., Sa Pai�) stated that the Paramita method ought not to be called Mahamudra, since the awareness of Mahamudra arises solely from Tantric empowerment, [he was mistaken]. [In fact,] the [Indian] Acarya Jfianaklrti states in his Ta ttviivatara that even at the level of an ordinary person, someone who possesses a sharp intellect may attain an irreversible understanding, since he can understand Mahamudrii properly and with certainty [merely] by relying on the [Common Mahayana] practices of famatha and vipasyana in accordance with the Piiramita approach. Moreover, in Sahajavajra's commentary on the Tattvadasaka, we find: \"The essence is the paramitiis, [whereas] mantra is a later adjustment. This is called Mahiimudra and it is clearly explained as an awareness that understands Suchness having three specific features (i.e., bliss, presence, and non-thought).\" Accordingly, varies slightly in different sources, and since the Dags po'i bka' 'bum nowhere specifies which texts the authors of this corpus considered to be included in the cycle of Grub pa sde bdun, it remains un­certain how the precise list looked for the authors of the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum. 114 \"The Cycle of Six Heart Texts\" (Snying po skor, also called Snying po'i skor or Snying po'i skor drug) are defined in Bu ston Rin chen grub's bstan 'gyur catalog as: (1) Saraha's Dohako�a (Q3068, D2224) ; (2) Nagarjunagarbha's Caturmudranifraya (Q3069, D2225); (3) Devacandra's Prajfiiijiianapraka§a (Q3070, D2226); (4) Sahajavajra's Sthitisamuccaya (Q3071, D2227); (5) Kud­dalI's Acintyakramopadesa (Q3072, D2228); and (6) Aryadeva's Cittavara!wvifodhana-niima­pr akara!W (Q2669, Dl804).

However, it is [also] certain that Sgam po pa [additionally] taught his own personal pupils a [form of] Mahiimudrii whose path is mantra .116 According to this later Tibetan view dating from the fifteenth century, Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii doctrine continued a trend first initiated by Maitripa and his peers of attempt­ing to synthesize the terminology and practices of the Anuttarayogatantras with the doctri­nes of the Common Mahiiyiina. Yet, how might this trend relate to Sa Pai:i's negative view of Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii? Sa Pai:i's own Tantric tradition had been handed down within his Sa skya clan. The core ofthis tradition are Tantric teachings that had been gathered in India by the great translator 'Brog mi Lotsa ba Shakya Ye shes (992-1074),117 a little over two hundred years prior to SaPai:i. The Blue Annals state that 'Brog mi was sent to India by the Tibetan master Rin chen bzang po (958-1055), when the latter was nearing the age of fifty.118 This means that 'Brogmi went to India around 1008. 'Brog mi stayed in India for thirteen years studying with Santibhadra, Santi pa, and Prajfiendraruci, and thereupon returned to Tibet around 1021.This fits well with another statement found in The Blue Annals saying that Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros (1009/1021-1097) went to learn Sanskrit from 'Brog mi in Tibet when Mar pa was fifteen years old, which would correspond to 1026 if the birth year of Mar pa is taken to be 1009.119 In Tibet, 'Brog mi taught several students, one of whom was 'Khon Dkon mchog rgyal po (1034-1102), Sa Pai:i's forefather who founded the monastery of Sa skya in 1073. Comparing the dates of 'Brog mi's visit to India (ca. 1008-1021) with the dates of Maitripa (ca. 1010-1087), it would seem that 'Brog mi may have visited India before the new trend of synthesizing the teachings and practices of the Anuttarayogatantras with the Common Mahiiyiina had come to fore, since one of the major figures in this movement was Maitripa who flourished in the middle of the eleventh century. It is therefore conceivable that Sa Pai:i's more orthodox view of Mahiimudrii as only belonging within the frame of the four empowerments and the four mudriis was derived from a slightly earlier stage in Indian Tantrism that existed prior to the time when the monastic establishment had truly begun to emphasize Mahiimudrii meditation as a non-Tantric possibility. In extension thereof, Bsod 116 The Blue Annals (CHANDRA, 1974:632-633; ROERICH, 1949:724-725). The English translation is partly based on BROIDO ( 1985: 12-13). 117 The dates are according to STEIN (1972:73) and ZHANG (1993:3217). SNELLGROVE (1987: 137) gives 'Brog mi's dates as 992-1072 without mentioning his source. 118 Th e Blue Annals (CHANDRA, 1974: 184- 189; ROERICH, 1949:205-210). 119 Th e Blue Annals (CHANDRA, 1974:352; ROERICH, 1949:399). The dates of Mar pa remain problematic. For a discussion, see DAVIDSON (2005: 142-148). His birth year is variously believed to be 1009 or 1021. Regarding the year of Mar pa's death, another Tibetan source ought to be added to the previous discussion in the form of the recently published biography by Rngog Zhe sdang rdo rj e (1078-1 154), wherein the year of Mar pa's death is given as \"the wood ox year\" (shing glang), i.e., 1085 CE.

Still, as noted above, Maitripa never spoke explicitly of Mahiimudrii as a practice to be used outside the Tantric context of the four empowerments and the four mudriis. Instead, he only attempted to explain certain key Tantric terms by equaling them with well-known philosophical concepts of the Common Mahayana, in particular with the Madhyamaka philosophy. Maitripa, therefore, does not seem to have severed Mahamudra from its Tantric context, as it was later made explicit in Bsod nams rin chen's contemplative approach. Moreover, the two cases of non-Tantric forms of Mahiimudrii attested in Jfianaklrti's Tattviivatiira and Sahajavajra's Tattvadasakaffka cited by MATHES cannot be said to constitute full equivalents of Bsod nams rin chen's much more extensive Mahamudra system. Although much of the Tibetan Mahiimudra terminology consists of Tantric terms that also appear in the writings of Maitripa and other authors belonging to his circle, the texts of Dags po'i bka' 'bum do not directly and explicitly rely on these Indian treatises, either by quoting or explaining them.120 While the authors of Bsod nams rin chen's contemplative community may have had general knowledge of the exi stence of Maitripa's textual corpora, it does not seem that they ever studied these sources closely. Hence, it appears rather difficult outright to conclude that Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudra doctrine was directly derived from Maitr1pa. Perhap s it was merely the case that Maitripa's synthesis of Tantra and Common Mahayana served as an indirect inspiration for Bsod nams rin chen and other early Tibetan Mahiimudra teachers and authors. Conversely, Sa Pai:i had a certain case in point with his critique, given that Mahamudra in the multivalent senses of this term traditionally did belong firmly to the context of the four empowerments and the four mudras of the Anuttarayogatantras, and it was only in very exceptional cases separated from this context in Indian sources. Consequently, it would seem pertinent to conclude that Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra approach in large part was a novelty, an innovative approach to Buddhist meditation practice which carefully attempted to fuse the existing Indian-Tibetan traditions of Tantric and Common Mahayana practices in a new way considered more suitable for the needs of Tibetan meditators living in communities of ascetic wilderness retreat in the twelfth century. 1 20 It should be noted that an exception in this regard is the Indian Tantric treatise Acintyiidvaya­kramopadefa composed by Kuddalapada, which is commented upon in text Za of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum (DK.A.Za). Kuddalapada's work is not included in Bu ston Rin chen grub's list of the eight Siddhi texts, but it is found among the eight Siddhi texts edited and published by SAM-DHONG & DWIVEDI (1987). See fn. 113 above. The form of Maluimudra taught in this work by Kuddalapada is, however, clearly framed in the Tantric context of the four empowerments and the four mudriis."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Part II The Narrative Construct of a Founder"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 The Hagiographical Tradition Surrounding Sgam po pa 1. The Making of an Icon Tibetan Buddhism abounds with astounding narratives of ascetic yogis, deep meditators, and extraordinary teachers, and Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen -being one of the main founders of the Tibetan Mahamudrii tradition -is certainly no exception to this. A key Tibetan genre of such stories is the rnam thar (or in the longer form of the word rnam par thar pa, *vimok�a) denoting religious 'biographies' or 'hagiographies', i.e., stories of saints. The literal meaning of the Tibetan term is 'liberation', which carries the sense of attaining freedom from smJisaric existence. The word suggests that the narratives contained in such texts primarily are meant to serve as role models for spiritual striving. Aside from inspiring faith, the stories have the additional function of creating religious histories of the given tradition to which the Buddhist masters in question belonged, thereby furnishing the contemporary practitioner with a sense of legacy and lineage.121 The Tibetan term for hagiography, rnam thar, was probably derived from the Indian Mahayana text Gm:u)avyuhasutra, wherein the protagonist of the story, named Sudhana, visits fifty male and female spiritual teachers in order to listen to their individual stories of spiritual liberation. The stories they tell are in the work referred to as \"liberation [stories]\" (vimok�a, rnam par thar pa).122 The word's emphasis on spiritual salvation thus makes it fairly equivalent to the Christian term 'hagiography', meaning \"writing (graphia) about [the life-story] of a holy (hagios) person.\" In the Bka' brgyud school of Tibetan Buddhism, the hagiographies of the tradition's two ear liest Tibetan founders -namely the layman Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros (1009/1021-1097) and the yogfMi la ras pa (ca. 1028-111111123)123 -have become well-known in the West with the popular English translations by the NALANDA Translation Committee (1986) and LHALUNGPA (1977).

Such stories are found in The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa127 and in The Rain of Wisdom.128 These materials available in English were subsequently collected and paraphrased by Jampa MACKENZIE STEWART (1995) and published in the non-academic, populist Dharma book The Life of Gampopa, which has since been reprinted in a second edition (2004). An academic and more detailed study of Bsod nams rin chen's life based on comparison of the various Tibetan hagiographies, especially on the later more elaborate versions, has since been made by Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche SHERPA (2004: 18-76) in his doctoral disserta­tion from Harvard University . In contrast to the relative dearth of materials on Bsod nams rin chen available in English and other Western languages, the Tibetan tradition has a plethora of biographical materials on the master. The Tibetan literary form of biography or hagiography (rnam thar) is a multivalent genre. Portraying a historical individual , it narrates a past and thereby attempts to set the past in a certain relationship to the present. Yet, as with any story, the figure that the hyper-text represents is constructed through the modes of the narrative, resulting in what may be called a narrative construct. In the case of Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, the narrative construct produced by a long series of Tibetan hagiographies on his life has created a religious icon that evolved over time with the growth of the literature.129 In the earliest literary phase constituted by works written during or very shortly after Bsod nams rin chen's life, a number of textual 1 27 See CHANG (1977). The Tibetan title is Rnal 'byor gyi dbang phyug chen po mi las ras pa'i rnam mgur, compiled, edited and first published in Tibetan in 1488-1495 by Gtsang smyon He ru ka Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan ( 1452-1507). On the author and the text, see SMITH (2001 :59-80). 1 28 NALANDA Translation Committee ( 1980:217-242 and 275-282) . The Tibetan title is Mchog gi dngos grub mngon du byed pa'i myur lam bka' brgyud bla ma rnams kyi rdo 1je'i mgur dbyangs ye shes char 'bebs rang grol lhun grub bde chen rab 'bar don rgya mtsho'i snying po or in shmi Bka' brgyud mgur mtsho, block-print published in 1972 by Rumtek Monastery (TBRC W21 962), folios 10la-l 16b and 134a-138b. The Tibetan compilation was originally made around 1542 by the eighth Karma pa Mi bskyod rdo rj e (1507-1 554) and was since expanded several times by subsequent Tibetan compilers. The second episode narrated in the text entitled \"Master Gampopa's Song of Response to the Three Men from Kham: Shomo! Come Back up !\" (Rje sgam po pa dang khams pa mi gsum gyi zhu !an sho mo yar shag gi mgur) is not told in any of the early sources and seems to be fictitious, since Dus gsum mkhyen pa had lived at Bsod nams rin chen's hermitage since 1139 and was already a senior resident when Phag mo gru pa joined the group in 1151, and it is therefore improbable that they were both expelled from the hermitage together as the story claims. 1 29 The question of how a series of Tibetan biographies gradually create the religious image of a given Tibetan Buddhist master has previously been treated in detail by Tiso (1988), QUINTMAN (2006), ROBERTS (2007), ARY (2007), and DUCHER (201 1). Trso's and QUINTMAN's studies both deal with the hagiographical corpus on Mi la ras pa, ROBERTS' work was based on the Ras chung pa hagiographies, ARY's research has been on hagiographies belonging to the Dge lugs tradition, while DUCHER's study was on the hagiographies of Mar pa. In the Indian tradition, a similar approach has previously been used by GRANOFF (l 989a, l 989b, 1990) in her studies of a series of religious biographies of the Jain monks Haribhadra and Siddhasena Divakara."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 85 fragments tell incomplete stories of a Buddhist master who lived a life firmly devoted to meditation in the solitude of the mountains, who often went against the typical life patterns followed by his monastic peers, and who sometimes had to undergo hardships and doubts to carry on in his renunciant endeavors. Thereupon, a string of early hagiographies composed from the late twelfth till the early fourteenth centuries gave rise to the first complete versions of Bsod nams rin chen's life story from his birth to his death. Coinciding with the growing political and economic influence in Tibet and abroad of bla mas from Bsod nams rin chen's Bka' brgyud tradition, the early hagiographies were then replaced by the first truly expansive hagiography, the so-called Large Hagiography (rnam thar chen mo) written by the second Zhwa dmar pa Mkha' spyod dbang po (1350-1405). Therein, Bsod nams rin chen was firmly declared to be a Buddhist saint, not simply in the form of the historical person Bsod nams rin chen but additionally as being the reincarnation of several earlier Buddhist saints from very distant non-historical pasts, whose spiritual lives have previously been recounted in a number of Indian Mahayana Sutras. Finally, in the course of the subsequent centuries which saw the political rise, fall, and peripheral persistence of the Bka' brgyud tradition, there was a literary phase of additional large hagiographies that built upon and embellished the narrative construct of Bsod nams rin chen formerly created by Mkha' spyod dbang po. This latter period was, moreover, the epoch during which the religious icon of Sgam po pa proliferated through a variety of other literary and religious modes. Textually and doctrinally, the iconic proliferation took form through the publication in 1520 of a large collection (bka' 'b um) of written works from Bsod nams rin chen's hermitage, many of which were attributed to Bsod nams rin chen as constituting the written form of his oral teachings. Religiously, the iconic proliferation was embedded in empowerment rituals whose transmissions were traced back to Bsod nams rin chen and earlier masters of the lineage, as well as in guru yoga meditation practices and devotional prayers focused on the early founders of the lineage. 130 In unison, this iconic proliferation created a coherent central history for the Bka' brgyud lineage that had a centrifugal power of anchoring the lineage in the lives and activities of a few select lineage holders of the past. Yet, the process equally involved a more implicit centripetal force that dispersed and put into oblivion the countless smaller contributions to the history of the lineage stemming from lesser known past individuals and the community at large. In short, the iconic proliferation created by the narrative constructs of the hyper-texts of the hagiographical genre created the unity needed for developing and maintaining the sectarian identity of a given religious lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. 2.

The Earliest Accounts of Bsod nams rin chen 's Vita The hagiographical image of Bsod nam rin chen -or, in other words, the 'narrative construct' of Sgam po pa as a religious figure and founder -developed over the centuries via the above-listed works. In the existing Western literature on his life, the focus has naturally been on the later texts with their fully developed account of Bsod nams rin chen's religious vita. Thus, the various shorter summaries of his life story given in most of the secondary literature is based on the Tibetan account found in The Blue Annals, being a religious history whose account of Bsod nams rin chen, in turn, relies on the Large Hagio­graphy by Mkha' spyod dbang po (no. 12 in the above list). Similarly, the short summary provided by DAVIDSON (2005:282-290) draws on the hagiography composed by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub (no. 14), while the larger hagiographical study by SHERPA (2004: 18-76) combines several of the above sources but retains its focus on the later, more developed narratives. The present study shall instead concentrate on the earliest texts belonging to the phase of hagiographical fragments (ca. 1130-1176), since these sources have received little attention in the existing Wes tern literature and since it is in those texts that the foundational elements of the narrative construct of Bsod nams rin chen were initially formed. 3.1.a. The First 'Autobiographical' Narrative Among the forty works found in the first xylographic print of Dags po'i bka' 'bum (DK.A), only a single text contains two short autobiographical passages that depict Bsod nams rin chen's life in a first person narrative recounting the major events of his religious life. The two passages are interspersed by a brief account of his death. The work in question is entitled Answers to the Questions of Dus gsum mkhyen pa (Dus gsum mkhyen pa'i zhus Zan, DK.A.Tha). The overall treatise is not a unitary work written by a single author but is rather a compilation of miscellaneous materials sharing a questi on-answer format.

The remaining 39 segments are not related to Dus gsum mkhyen pa in any explicit way. The first 'autobiographical' passage makes up the text's third segment.1s1 The segment bears no individual title and has no internal colophon, and it is therefore neither clear who the author was nor exactly when it was written. It records Bsod nams rin chen's answer to a general question about his religious life story and given the text's oral character it seems clear that it was not written by Bsod nams rin chen's own hand, since Bsod nams rin chen features as the text's speaker. His reply to the question , which takes up the major part of the segment, is initiated with the phrase \"from the mouth of the matchless master\" (rje mnyam pa med pa'i zhal nas). The end of his long reply is marked by the verb \"says\" (gsung ngo ), indicating the end of the author's quotation of Bsod nams rin chen's direct speech. In other words, the reply isembedded in a typical Tibetan literary structure, which means \"the matchless master says ... 111s2 Although not written directly by Bsod nams rin chen, the first-person narrative, the plain character of its contents, along with the self-irony with which Bsod nams rin chenoccasionally speaks of himself all make it seem possible that the text, at least to some extent, may reflect an actual autobiographical oral account. If that is so, the passage would constitute one of the most direct literary witnesses of his life. However, given the seriousdiscrepancies between this 'autobiographical' passage and the next 'autobiographical' passage that follows shortly after in the text, there is also good reason to think that both narratives were strongly colored by their subsequent writers. Here follows a translation of the first 'autobiographical' passage in its entirety: 153 15° For an overview of the texts and its internal segments, see the summary of Dags po'i bka' 'bum given below in part III of the present book, text DK.A.Tha. 151 Segment DK.A.Tha.3.10b4-13b5, corresponding to DK.a.Kha.132b5-136b6. For further corre­lated passages, see the summary of segment DK.A.Tha.3 in the latter part of this book. 152 In English, the past tense verb \"said\" would seem more suitable, but the numerous oral sayings contained in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum are invariably framed by the present tense verb 'says' (gsung). The reason for this is probably the strong perfect tense nuance of the Tibetan past tense verbal stem, which means \"having said\" rather than \"said\". Hence, the use of the present tense verb may here simply be equivalent in meaning to the English form \"said.\" Yet, present tense verb usage also gives an additional shade of meaning, suggesting that the words somehow are still ongoing, perhaps in the sense of being living words that are being passed down through the oral and written transmission of the saying. 153 The translation is based on a comparative reading of the two primary Tibetan manuscripts DK.a.Kha and DK.A, occasionally supported by readings from later manuscripts derived from A. The additional correlated passage in DK.a.Nga was not taken into consideration in the readings, as it"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition Homage to the true teachers! The precious master was asked: \"How did you first listen to the Dharma? How did you accomplish it in the time that followed? How was the Dharma born in your mind-stream in the end? What special meditative experiences have you had till now? What is your special realization? How do you regard the external physical world? Please tell it all without holding anything back.\" Having been requested thus, the matchless master154 said: \"Usually, such things are said to be private. To talk about stable meditative experiences causes obstacles. However, once the innermost nature has arisen, what it is proper to say may be improper and what is an impediment may be harmless. Since I have hoped to do you good, I previously did not hide these things but told about them in the [teaching] gathering. Hence, if I should now talk about these things again: First I studied medicine. Then I learnt many mantras with Mnga' ris pa.155 At that time, my friend named 'Gong ston156 told [me], \"The Acarya Byang chub sems dpa'157 has instructions from Bia ma Mid la, 158 and Mid la is said to be an accom­plished practitioner; 159 let us request teachings from this master. Let's ask for any instruction he can give us or ask for what others have requested [previously] - then other teachings might follow.\" After we had received teachings from him, a fine state of meditative absorption (ting nge 'dzin, *samadhi) arose in me lasting for seven days. When I inquired about it, the teacher [Byang chub sems dpa'] said, \"This should be cultivated.\" The Acarya and the two of us then meditated together. 'Gong ston said to me, \"Tell me if something similar happens to you [again].\" I re-93 first came to light at a later stage of research. The present volume does not include critical Tibetan editions of this and the other hagiographical passages. For a different English translation, see DUFF (201 1). 154 \"The matchless master\" (rje mnyam pa med pa), although not a common epithet in these sources, is clearly intended as referring to Bsod nams rin chen given the overall contents of the text and its first-person narrative. 155 Mnga' ris pa (dates unknown). Given that Bsod nams rin chen's birth-place was the Se ba valley (se ba lung) in the Gnyal region, located south of Dags po, and that no travel has been mentioned in the story so far, it would seem that Mnga' ris pa was a local bla ma residing in or near Se ba valley. Ms A (DK.A.Tha.3.10b6) calls him Mnga' ris pa, meaning \"the One from Mnga' ris\", being the name of a region in the Western-most part of Tibet. Ms a (DK.a.Kha. l 33a3), however, calls him Lnga rig pa, meaning \"the One learned in the Five [Sciences].\" Later on, ms a (DK.a.kha. 133a6) also refers to the same (or another?) person as Mnga' ris pa, at which point ms A also gives the name as Mnga' ris pa. 156 'Gong ston (dates unknown). This is the spelling of ms a (Dk.a.kha.133a3); ms A (DK.A.Tha.3.10b1) spells his name 'Gongs ston. The name is probably an epithet meaning \"the teacher (ston) from 'Gong,\" with 'Gong being an unspecified toponym. 157 Acarya (slob dp on) Byang chub sems dpa' (i.e., *Bodhisattva, dates unknown). The title Acarya refers to a highly educated monk teacher. Like Mnga' ris pa, Acarya Byang chub sems dpa' seems to have resided somewhere in Dags po, near Bsod nams rin chen's home in Se ba valley, since their meeting is prior to Bsod nams rin chen's departure for Central Tibet (Dbu ru , see below). 158 Bia ma Mid la, i.e., Mi la ras pa (ca. 1028-1111/1 123). 159 \"Accomplished practitioner\" (grub thob), i.e., a siddha."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"94 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition plied, \"I have already given rise to a meditative state again.\" He said, \"As for me, I occasionally manage to give rise to a meditative state, but at other times I feel nothing sitting here, except for numbness.\" Yet, with more practice, the state of meditative absorption also developed in him, and on his seat he one day wrote, \"Today was the end of sa1!1siira for 'Gong ston.\" After that, I requested Mnga' ri s pa to preside as ordination preceptor, 160 and at the age of twenty-six I thus became a fully ordained Buddhist monk.161 At the age of twenty-eight, 162 'Gong ston and I went together to Central Tibet.163 We asked for the Bka' gdams instructions164 from Dge bshes165 Snyug rum pa166 and also requested the [ceremony for] engendering the resolve for Awakening (bodhicitta). From that point onwards, I felt I never lost the relative bodhicitta. 160 'Preceptor' (mkhan po), i.e., the upodhyiiya who administers monastic ordination. 161 Given the Tibetan manner of counting the birth-year as one, this would correspond to the age of twenty-five in the Western style of age-calculation. Having been born in 1079, Bsod nams rin chen's ordination would therefore have taken place in 1104. 162 \"Age of twenty-eight,\" i.e., in 1106. 163 Central Tibet (Dbu ru), literally meaning the 'Central Hom' or the 'Central Division'. The Central Division was a medieval region in Central Tibet (Dbus), being one of the four divisions (ru bzhi) of Dbus and Gtsang. According to the Tibetan dictionary Ts hig mdzad chen mo (ZHANG, 1984: 1942), the center of Dbu ru was the Ra mo che temple in Lha sa; in the east, it was demarcated by the mountain range called the Seven Cypress Brothers (shug pa sp un bdun) in '01 kha, in the south by the place Rma la la rgyud (in Gtsang), in the west by Gzhu snye mo, and in the north by Brags kyi glang ma gur phub. In other words, Bsod nams rin chen and 'Gong ston traveled from Se ba valley to the vicinity of Lha sa in Central Tibet. 164 The Bka' gdams instructions\" (bka ' gdams kyi gdams ngag) literally means \"the instructions (gdams ngag) of the [tradition] of instructions (gdams) on the [Buddha's direct] words (bka') .\" As will become evident below, the name Bka' gdams holds a central place in Bsod nams rin chen's concept of his own religious heritage. Aside from Bia ma Mi la, all Bsod nams rin chen's teachers mentioned in this narrative seem to have belonged to the Bka' gdams tradition. The tradition had started in Tibet with Atifa Dlparpkarasrljfiana (ca. 982-1 054), an Indian monk who visited Western and Central Tibet in the period 1042-1054. 165 The title Dge bshes is here left untranslated, but will in some instances below be translated with \"spiritual teacher.\" It is short for dge ba'i bshes gnyen (kalyo1:1amitra), which literally means \"good friend,\" \"virtuous friend,\" or \"friend for [promoting] goodness.\" It has often been translated with \"spiritual friend\". In the Bka' gdams literature, a Dge bshes signifies a Bia ma (guru) or teacher of the Mahiiyiina tradition, and a number of texts, including several passages in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, define the qualifications that a Dge bshes must possess to be authentic, one of which is a general qualification of knowing the Buddhist teachings. In the later Dge lugs tradition, Dge bshes became a title given only to highly educated monks who have gone through a higher education in Mahiiyiina Buddhist doctrine and philosophy, somewhat equivalent to a doctorate in theology. For the later Dge lugs Dge bshes education, see TARAB (2000) and DREYFUS (2003). 166 Dge bshes Snyug rum pa, i.e., Dge bshes Snyug rum pa Brtson 'grus rgyal mtshan (dates un­known). His name literally means the Dge bshes from Snyug rum, with Snyug rum being a toponym. The spelling of his name is here according to ms DK.A. Ms DK.a spells his name Gnyug rum pa."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition Since we in this place had to stay together with many other people, my former meditative state was spoiled, which made me unhappy. We heard that Rgya Yon bdag167 was a good meditator, so we went to his place and since there were fewer people there, the state of meditative absorption reappeared. We meditated on impermanence, action and its result (kanna-phala), and the shortcomings of sa'!1silra in accordance with the instructions on the Stages of the Path (lam rim).168 Due to this, my former meditative experience changed. Whereas I earlier had an experience of bliss and emptiness, I now became short­tempered and a feeling of weariness took over. 'Gong ston asked me what was hap­pening to me. I told him how I felt and he said that he felt the same and added that these Bka' gdams pa instructions seem to work the same for everyone. Having stayed there for three years, 169 I thought to myself, \"That Bia ma Mid la really seems to be an accomplished practitioner.170 If I do not turn to him even for a moment while he is still alive, I shall regret it later.\" When 'Gong ston and I asked Rgya Yon bdag for permission to leave, he said, \"While you stayed here, you have traveled on the Path of Means;171 if you [now] depart, I wish that there may arise an opportunity for you to stay with me again!\" We then left, but when we reached 'Gur mo, 172 'Gong ston fell ill. I nursed him [for some time] and then found someone else to look after him a little and went on my way. 95 167 Dge bshes Rgya Yon bdag (dates unknown). The name Rgya Yon bdags is an epithet literally meaning \"the Benefactor of/from the RGya clan.\" See SHERPA (2004:64). For background informa­tion on the clan, see VITALI (2004). 168 The Stages of the Path teachings (lam rim) is a Bka' gdams set of teachings that are particu­larly associated with Atifa's seminal text \"A Lamp for the Path to Awakening\" (Bodhipiltha-p radfpa, Byang chub lam gyi sgron me), which he wrote in Western Tibet in 1042 at the behest of the king of Mnga' ris, Lha bla ma Byang chub 'Od. 169 If the three years are to be counted from the time when Bsod nams rin chen first traveled to Central Tibet in 1106, it would mean that he left Central Tibet to meet Mi la ras pa in or shortly after 1109. This estimate agrees with the later hagiographical tradition, which likewise gives 1109 as the year when Bsod nams rin chen met Bia ma Mi la. 170 I.e., a siddha (grub thob). 171 It is somewhat unclear what \"the Path of Means\" (thabs lam, *upilyamilrga) would refer to here. The phrase may refer to the Mantra method (Mantranaya) in general, but in later Bka' brgyud literature the expression usually denotes the Six Doctrines of Naropa (Na ro 'i chos drug) along with the sexual yogas of the second and third Tantric empowerments. For a similar use of the term in Rnying ma literature, see DEWITT GARSON (2004: 124). Unless Rgya Yon bdag taught advanced Tantric yogas to Bsod nams rin chen and 'Gong ston without this being mentioned in the narrative, the latter specialized meaning of the Path of Means does not seem to be the right connotation in the present context. This is particularly the case, since Bsod nams rin chen first later in the narrative receives the Inner Heat (gtum mo) instruction, being the foremost among the Six Doctrines of Naropa, from Bia ma Mid la. Instead, the Path of Means may here refer to the Common Mahayana practice of cultivating kindness and bodhicitta, which is how the phrase has been used in another work within the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, namely text Ca (Tshogs chos legs mdzes ma, DK.A.Ca.9.18a3.s). 172 'Gur mo is a toponym. Ms DK.a spells it 'Gur mo, while ms DK.A gives it as Mgur mo."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"96 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition In the morning of the day I was going to meet the Bia ma, 173 the Bia ma had said [to his students]: \"Today a teacher from Central Tibet will come to me; he is someone who will bring benefit to sentient beings.\" When I arrived, a warm wel­come had [therefore] been prepared with some dark beer. Whereas I was physically and mentally fatigued from having traveled so far, the Bia ma said, \"I am feeling very good.\" I asked him how come, yet as soon as the Bia ma had spoken those words, my former tiredness disappeared completely. Then I stayed there and the Bia ma's attendant, 174 Se ban Ston chung, 175 came by to see me. He said, \"I will help you make a request for higher teachings. Now let's go to see the Bia ma!\" We went there,176 and having made prostrations very properly, I said to the Bia ma, \"As I have traveled four months to come here, please consider me with kindness.\" However, the Bia ma responded, \"In the course of your four months, one could have come to my place all the way from India.\" I an­swered, \"Yes, but two of us set out to come here and then one of us became sick and had to remain behind.\" Then the Bia ma said, \"It seems you that do not have a karmic connection with me.\" I responded, \"Although many Bka' gdams pa Dge bshes cared greatly for me, this did not hold me back in the least. My coming here was therefore like an arrow being released from the bow. So if we have a karmic connection, it would seem to be a strong one.\" When I requested instructions from him, I received several good177 instruc­tions that Bia ma Byang chub sems dpa' had not obtained. I presented my former manner of meditation to the Bia ma and he responded that it was good and just right. At one time, there was a fine teaching I had requested, which I could not medi­tate on properly due to intense lethargy. Then the Bia ma said, \"You should prac­tice breathing exercises.\" 178 Another time, when Se ban Ston chung and the Bia ma got distracted from the teaching topic, I reminded Se ban Ston chung and [the Bia ma then] said to me, 173 Although not mentioned by name, the Bla ma in question is clearly Bia ma Mid la, as becomes evident from the stories told about him in the following piece. 174 An 'attendant' (nye gnas, *antevasin) is a personal assistant to a bla ma. See fn. 418. 175 Se ban ston chung (dates unknown), literally meaning \"junior teacher Se ban.\" Additionally, the name Se ban perhaps means \"the monk (ban de) from Se.\" Se ban Ston chung may be identical with Se ban Ras pa (dates unknown), who appears in story fifteen of Th e Manifo ld Songs of Mi la (Mi la mgur 'bum) entitled \"The Story at the Inn\" (Gtsang g.yas ru byang gi sgar kha che'i mgron khang du se ban ras pa dang mj al ba'i skor); for an English translation, see CHANG (1977:150-156). 176 Ms DK.A adds an interlinear note at this point, not attested by ms DK.a, saying, \"at the age of thirty-one,\" presumably referring to Bsod nams rin chen. If this is so, Bsod nams rin chen's meeting with Bia ma Mid la would have taken place in 1109. Mi la ras pa (ca. 1028-111111 123) would in that year have been 80 or 81 years old. 177 In both manuscripts DK.a and DK.A, the spelling of the word 'good' is yags pa, which is not found in the Tibetan dictionaries. It is probably equivalent to yag pa, meaning 'good', although that remains a conjecture. The modem edition DK.S spells it yag pa in this instance, but al so spells it yags pa together with manuscripts DK.a and DK.A in the sentence that follows. 178 \"Breathing exercises\" (srog rtsol), i.e., prar:zayiima."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition \"Indeed, you speak of the meditation I am explaining in the right terms. Now I want to meditate like you -please give me a teaching!\" [Horrified], I thought to myself, \"I cannot teach meditation to the Bla ma!\" Since I was [always] so smart in asking for [new] explanations, the Bia ma [one day] said to me [jokingly], \"Hey stupid, there haven't been many questions from you [lately]!\" Towards the end of the winter, the Bia ma told me, \"You have stamina in your practice. You are suitable for becoming a Ras pa.179 Having donned the [white] cotton robe, I felt improvement in my meditation and when I woke up after sleep­ing, my body felt like it was boiling, although [the sensation of Inner Heat] did not last. As I continued to practice [the yoga of Inner Heat] over the summer, the bodi­ly heat that one is taught [to generate gradually] arose in me. I then moved down to a lower place [on the mountain], where there was a cold [and windy] juncture of three valleys.180 I only wore the tattered cotton garment. While I stayed there, the Bia ma came to see me and asked, \"Do you feel warm now?\" and I answered, \"The heat is still there.\" I asked him whether the heat would also be there during winter and he replied, \"Then it becomes even warmer. By now, you are already better than me.\" At the age of thirty-two, 181 I traveled down from the mountain after having stayed just thirteen months [with the Bia ma] high up on the mountain pass.182 The Bia ma had told me to watch out for obstacles when I came down and since I was sometimes disturbed by ghosts, I did a lot of recitations. [I'm sure] the Bia ma knew [of this]. 97 179 The Tibetan word Ras pa means a \"cotton-clad [practitioner].\" It is the title used to designate the yogis of Mi la Ras pa's tradition, who were characterized by only wearing a white cotton robe all year round. The thin robe was a sign of their accomplishment of the yoga of Inner Heat (cii!1¢alf, gtum mo), which has the side-effect of elevating the body temperature. The white color of the robe denotes their status of being semi-lay practitioners, as opposed to the maroon robes of a monk. The precise expression used here in the text, however, is not the common word Ras pa but rather Ras thub , which literally means \"someone capable (thub) of [wearing only] a cotton [garment] (ras)\" and/or a \"cotton-clad (ras) Muni (thub).\" The Indian word Muni is an old title of respect for a religious ascetic or sage, as for example seen in the Buddha's title Sakyamuni, meaning \"the Muni of the Sakya clan.\" Presumably, the expression Ras th ub is a slightly elaborate form of the title Ras pa, denoting the same kind of practitioner. 180 The canc;Jalf instructions generally say that strong outer wind (vii.vu, rlung) disturbs the inner breath (also called vayu, rlung), which the practitioner attempts to control and manipulate in this yoga. It is therefore considered extremely difficult and even dangerous to practice cii!1¢alf in a very windy place. Moreover, the chill factor of the location that Bsod nams rin chen chose must also have been an additional hardship, which he thus employed to challenge himself in his practice. 181 Bsod nams rin chen's Tibetan age of thirty-two corresponds to the year 1110. 182 The sentence thus implies that Bia ma Mi la lived with his students high up in the mountain wilderness."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"98 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition I then traveled back to the residence of Rgya Yon bdag.183 [Having arrived there], I thought to myself, \"I have only made some progress [in my practice] and so I should [still] stay in the presence of the Bia ma. \"184 However, my vitality was at its end and we had not acquired any barley [for new provisions]. [What little I had left], I provided [as food for both Rgya Yon bdag and myself]. Moreover, having practiced so intensively I had become ill and [in order to obtain medicine] to cure it I had to pay 1 V2 kiwi measures185 of barley. As there were two of us [in Rgya Yon bdag's retreat place], we did not have [suffi­cient] provisions. So I left and went to '01 kha,186 but again I did not receive any barley [as alms]. I continued [east] to Dags po187 and began having fearful thoughts. My feeling of Inner Heat188 was quite unstable, sometimes good, sometimes bad, and my former meditative experience faded away, since I was again living amidst many people in the Bka' gdams pa monasteries. That is indeed why one needs to dwell in solitude. Since I had lived ascetically, my body was dried up and my meditative absorption was lost. The Bia ma had once said to me, \"Oil does not come from sand, but comes from mustard seeds. Similarly, meditative absorption does not arise in a body without vitality .\"189 He had also said, \"Don't put aside this Inner Heat (gtum mo) of mine.\" Remembering these words, I kept practicing. I finally obtained plenty of food in [my home valley] of Se ba190 and the meditative absorption reemerged. Hence, for practicing one needs a proper quantity of food. Three years after leaving the presence of the Bia ma,191 the Inner Heat turned into a [steady] flow. That summer, even when I did not practice so much, the heat was still there. 183 Thus, having traveled for four months to southern Tibet and trained for thirteen months under Bia ma Mi la, Bsod nams rin chen returned after one year and five months to his former Bka' gdams meditation teacher Rgya Yon bdag in Central Tibet, with whom he had lived for three years prior to visiting Bia ma Mi la. 184 Evidently, the Bia ma here refers to Bsod nams rin chen's main Bka' gdams teacher Rgya Yon bdag. 185 A khal is a Tibetan measure of roughly thirty pounds. 186 As mentioned above, the '01 kha region is the eastern-most part of the Central Division (Dbu ru). It is located approximately 150 kilometers south-east of Lha sa. 187 Dags po (in later sources often spelled Dwags po) is the region immediately east of '01 kha and west of Kong po.

The second 'autobiographical' passage (DK.A.Tha.5) mentions one Dge bshes Sgre pa as a Bka' gdams pa teacher with whom Bsod nams rin chen studied shortly after his stay with Bia ma Mi la. See also SHERPA (2004:64), who mentions that \"Las chen states he was a student of the first Spyan snga ba\". In the present context, Sgre pa is portrayed as asking a question, implying that he is a member of the audience during Bsod nams rin chen's teaching. Since the narrative of the present segment continues well beyond the period shortly after Bsod nams rin chen's stay with Mi la ras pa, it is uncertain whether the Dge bshes Sgre pa of both the passages is the same person. 197 \"Hands in the meditation posture\" (mnyam bzhag gi phyag rgya, *samahitamudra or perhaps better *dhyananwdra), i.e., with both hands in the lap, the right hand resting with the palm up on top of the left upward-facing palm, and the thumbs touching lightly."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"100 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition breath be soft.

It was quite difficult for me to bring this about, whereas it seems to happen to you without difficulty. In my case, it started with a good dream. I dreamt that I obtained a tub full of gold that had been dug up and I then thought that I should [use the gold to] write [a copy of] the A:j_tasahasrikii.199 Shortly after having this dream, an inner certainty arose in me, ascertaining [the nature of] the mind. Apait from the Yoga of the Co-Emergent (lhan cig skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga), my practice had only been to meditate on Inner Heat (gtum mo, *cii�1qliilf).200 An understanding emerged powerfully within me in that I reflected: Every­thing exists [merely] as thought,201 all thoughts are passing,202 and all that exists [only] as mind.203 In that moment, the nature of cognition204 appeared, like meeting a person I knew from before.

The sentence implies that Bsod nams rin chen had by then stayed several years in his home region of Se ba valley. According to the present narrative, after leaving Ela ma Mi la, he first went to stay with his former teacher Rgya Yon bdag. When they ran out of provisions, he went briefly to '01 kha and Dags po, whereupon he walked home to Seba valley. The narrative did not mention that he ever left the valley in the intervening period and it therefore seems that he simply stayed there during the years of ca. 1111-11 17. 199 The A:j.tasahasrikii, i.e., the Prajiiiipiiramitiiszltra in eight thousand (a:j_tasahasra) verses. In Tibet, this sutra was often copied in gold ink on black paper as a religious beneficient practice. The Prajiiiipilramitii scriptures are often viewed as embodiments of the Buddha's wisdom, which it may symbolize in Bsod nams rin chen's dream. 200 It is uncertain precisely what \"the Yoga of the Co-Emergent\" (lhan cig skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga) signifies here, but in the later Eka' brgyud traditions the expression is a common name for Bsod nams rin chen's own meditational system of Mahiimudrii. If that is also its meaning here, it connotes that Bsod nams rin chen during his years of solitary retreat only engaged in two kinds of meditation practice: Mahiimudrii meditation (lhan cig skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga) and Inner Heat (gtum mo, *ca1:1qlalf). 201 'Thought' (rtog pa, *vikalpa) or 'ideas'. 202 'Passing' (glo bur ba, *iigantuka) or 'adventitious'. 203 'Mind' (sems, *citta). 204 \"The nature of cognition\" (shes pa'i ngo bo, \"'j niinarilpa). 205 \"The self-nature of knowledge\" (rig pa rang gi ngo bo, *vidyiisvabhiiva). 206 \"Perceptions\" (snang ba, *avabhiisa) or 'appearances', referring to the experience of the outer world as well as inner states."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition meditation, and no meditator. All phenomena from before became an outer shell, the nature of knowledge became without [the] support [of an object] and there was no longer any need for being concerned with perceptions. Sometimes these would emerge as empty, other times as illusion-like. It was unnecessary to attempt to ap­ply the realization and the practice toward these perceptions. At some point, I felt that the meditation experience became very distant and I had the feeling that this was experience itself. The realization had become stable and could not be enhanced any further. Later [while practicing] at upper Brtan mkhar in the area of upper Rong, [fur­ther] progress arose in [my] realization. How? Earlier, whenever thoughts of vari­ous things would arise hazily, I felt it would be nice if these thoughts were not there. Now, however, all thoughts turned into a pure radiance.207 I sensed that in this [state] there could not be any hurt from thoughts and indeed in that moment I felt assured that there could be no hurt from anything whatsoever. From then on, there was only radiance, which has remained continuous with me ever since. It has been uninterrupted day and night and I have seen that for a yogfthere is neither death, non-death, nor any in-between (bar do , *antarabhava). Ever since, I have felt completely happy.208 Formerly, even though I did a lot of recitations, I was [often] harmed by ghosts. Nowadays even the thought of reciting does not occur to me and no ghost is able to do me any harm. Before, whenever I met dge bshes learned in the teachings, I would feel nervous. Now I would not have the slightest worry, even if the Buddha himself were to come by. No matter how I converse with learned people, I am carefree, since the door of insight has opened within me. [Recently], I had a dream where I dreamt that I received a small leather box, whereupon Meditator Bkra shis g.yung209 said to me, \"Please teach me!\" In the dream, I answered him, \"I am not going to teach [you]. Instead, this box contains the relics of the Venerable Master [Atisa]210 and the Bka' gdams instructions.\" I dreamt that given his great perseverance, he was able to open the box. 101 207 'Radiance' ('od gsal, *abhiisvara) is a light-metaphor that is often used in Buddhist texts for the manner in which the cognizance of the mind shines forth. Just like things are visible due to the radiant quality of light, outer and inner phenomena are experienced due to the mind's inherent power of cognizance which, so to speak, radiates and makes things cognizable. 208 This last sentence is not attested by ms DK.a, but only by ms DK.A and its derivatives. 209 \"Meditator Bkra shis g.yung\" (bsgom pa bkra shis g.yung). Perhaps this person is identical with Bsod nams rin chen's student Yo gf Chos g.yung (rnal 'byor chos g.yung, also spelled rnal 'byor chos 'byung). Dags po'i bka' 'bum includes a short text said to contain Bsod nams rin chen's replies to questions by YogfChos g.yung (DK.A.Na). At the end of this text is appended a list of Bsod nams rin chen's major students (DK.A.Na.2.4a3.4), where Yogf Chos g.yung is counted among the two especially distinguished practitioners possessing accomplishment (khyad par can gyi grub thob gnyis) . 210 \"The Venerable Master [Ati§a]\" (Jo bo rj e).

When they blew in it, it became as small as a conch shell. Then [a voice] said, \"Since this is now the only horn in all the kingdoms of Central Tibet and the Gtsang province, people are going to come.\" This is what I dreamt and it has happened just so. One night while I stayed in a small cave in the '01 kha mountains, I dreamt that I killed a black man. I had the feeling that from then on I could no longer be harmed by obstacles of negative influences and the like .213 Indeed, that is how it has been ever since. Another night I dreamt that I cut off the head of a child. I thought to myself, \"In this world, nothing special comes from having children. Shouldn't I become unattached even to such things?\" And this is indeed how it has been. Ever since I awoke from this dream, I have never dreamt again. The Bka' gdams pas all say, \"When one has realized emptiness, one turns away from action and result (karma-phala).\" I have ascertained in my meditation experience that there are [indeed] no such things. I therefore have a Dharma­transmission for the Bka' gdams pas.\" So spoke [Bsod nams rin chen]. The above translation of the first 'autobiographical' narrative consists of seven overall parts.211 It may be added that the label Bka' brgyud, which in later times became the common name for the tradition started by Mar pa, Mi la ras pa, and Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, is quite rare in the texts of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum. Consequently, in the present sentence, when Bsod nams rin chen mentions the Bka' gdams tradition as being the source of all benefit, it is not certain that this is to be read (anachronistically) as denoting a tradition that is quite different from and partly opposed to the Bka' brgyud tradition. As also suggested by the following sentence, it is possible that Bsod nams rin chen here understands his own transmission (being a monk from the Bka' gdams school) as belonging to the Bka' gdams tradition and that he has simply incorporated certain meditative and yogic teachings from Mi la ras pa into this transmission. Such an entirely positive view of the Bka' gdams tradition is, however, not espoused by all texts within the Dags po'i bka' 'bum. What appears here is probably an issue connected with the long span of time during which the texts of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum were composed, redacted, and compiled into a corpus, as well as differing attitudes towards the Bka' gdams tradition among the different authors who wrote down the texts of the corpus. 212 These sentences seem to imply that Bsod nams rin chen's method of teaching was to combine explanations on the Bka' gdams instructions of the Common Mahayana with teachings on the yoga techniques of the Six Doctrines of Naropa. The statement not only indicates the strong emphasis Bsod nams rin chen seems to have placed on the Bka' gdams instructions in general, but it is also notable that it makes no reference to his Mahilmudril teachings as a separate meditational system. 213 \"Negative influences\" (bdud, *milra) or \"deadly forces\" imply both inner and outer obstacles, either in the form of negative mental states or spirits."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 103 The introductory part contains the opening questions put to Bsod nams rin chen and his initial reaction. The second part presents his youth in Seba valley, explaining that he first studied medi­cine and then learnt some Buddhist teachings and meditation instructions from a bla ma called Mnga' ris pa as well as from the Acarya Byang chub sems dpa'. It is notable that Byang chub sems dpa' is said to have possessed instructions from Mi la ras pa, which in general suggests that other Bka' gdams pa monks, besides Bsod nams rin chen, also received and practiced higher Tantric teachings. At the age of 25 in 1104, Bsod nams rin chen received monastic ordination from Mnga' ris pa. The third part details his travel together with his companion 'Gong ston to Central Tibet in the region of Lha sa. The two young monks spent three years there, first studying with the renowned Bka' gdams pa Dge bshes Snyug rum pa and later spending much time with the hermit Dge bshes Rgya Yon bdag, receiving his instructions in the foundational Bka' gdams system of contemplation. Wishing to learn from the famous yogzMi la ras pa, they set out in the fourth part of the narrative to meet him, but 'Gong ston fell ill and had to abandon the journey. Continuing on his own, Bsod nams rin chen met Ela ma Mi la in 1109 at the age of thirty. He stayed with him for thirteen months to learn yogic practices, particularly the practice of Inner Heat. The fifth part describes Bsod nams rin chen's years of practice in solitude during the period from 1110 until at least 1117. First, he returned shortly to his teacher Dge bshes Rgya Yon bdag in Central Tibet and then continued his homebound journey south-east, to '01 kha and Dags po, and finally back to Se ba valley . He describes how his gtum mo practice gradually evolved and also answers two short questions put to him by his audience regarding certain details of his story . In the sixth part, he describes at length his inner experience of realization, which began in 1117. In this context, he mentions that his personal meditation practice consisted only of gtum mo yoga and the yoga of the inborn (lhan cig skyes sbyor), the latter possibly referring to some sort of Mahiimudrii practice. The first experiences of realization took place while he resided in Se ba valley and these experiences continued to occur when he subsequently took up residence in a place called upper Brtan mkhar in the area of upper Rong. The seventh and last part of the narrative recounts a number of special dreams Bsod nams rin chen had, which he took as indications of various prophecies of success for his teaching activity. The mention of prophetic and auspicious dreams is si gnificant, as it within the narrative serves to confirm the validity and authenticity of the speaker's spiritual achievements. The present 'autobiographical' narrative is though notable for its complete lack of references to miracles, which occur frequently in later Sgam po pa hagiographies. The mention of dreams to corroborate Bsod nams rin chen's meditational achievements is a narrative device that is similar to tropes found in many Indian hagiographies. For example, Indian literature often contains stories of philosophical debates between rival schools where"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"104 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition the human outcome of the debate needs to be corroborated by divine tests, in which the debaters di splay miracles or undergo trials of superhuman abilities and knowledge.214 This first 'autobiographical' narrative is significant in several ways. It appears to be a very frank account, wherein the speaker at times mocks himself and speaks directly of various difficulties he had in his meditation practice and daily life. This tone differs considerably from the later hagiographies, which tend to speak only very highly of their subject. Further, the narrative lays an unusual emphasis on the speaker's ties to the Bka' gdams tradition. According to the present story, Mi la ras pa begins his teacher-disciple relationship with Bsod nams rin chen by confirming the success and validity of Bsod nams rin chen's former Bka' gdams style of meditation practice. This too disagrees with the later hagiographical tradition as well as with the second 'autobiographical' narrative below, which has Mi la ras pa reject and belittle Bsod nams rin chen's Bka' gdams practice. 3.1.b. A Brief Account of Bsod nams rin chen 's Death The \"Brief Account of Bsod nams rin chen's Death\" follows immediately after the first 'autobiographical' passage within the same text in Dags po'i bka ' 'bum, i.e., Answers to the Questions of Dus gsum mkhyen pa (Dus gsum mkhyen pa'i zhus lan).215 This is a short seg­ment containing a little poem in just three verses by an anonymous author. The following is a complete translation of the segment:216 Niimo guru !217 In the last autumn month of the bird year, in the night of the fourteenth day, [Bsod nams rin chen] fell a bit ill.21 8 \"Now I shall not take medi­cine,\" he said. 214 For some examples from the Indian Vedanta literature, see GRANO FF ( 1985 :466). 215 DK.A.Tha.4.13b6-l3b7, corresponding to DK.a.Kha.136b5-l37a2. 216 For a different English translation, see DUFF (201 1). 217 This homage, meaning \"praise to the guru,\" is lacking in ms DK.a and has been inserted only in ms DK.A and its derivatives. 21 8 Since the poem describes Bsod nams rin chen's death, the bird year (bya'i lo) in question is undoubtedly the water-bird year (chu bya) of the third rab byung cycle, viz. 1153 CE. The \"last autumn month\" (ston zla tha chung) is a reading found only in ms DK.a. Since there are two dif­ferent ways of converting seasonal months into the regular Tibetan calendar months (hor zla), the \"last autumn month\" may correspond either to the seventh calendar month (hor zla bdun pa) or the ninth calendar month (hor zla dgu pa) of the Tibetan lunar calendar (see ZHANG, 1984:1118). According to this passage, Bsod nams rin chen thus died on night of the fourteenth day (or perhaps in the morning of the fifteen day) of either of those months, which in all the major Tibetan calen­drical systems respectively correspond to Wednesday August 5, 1153 CE or Saturday October 3, 1153 CE in the Gregorian calendar (see the calendrical calculation table in SCHUH, 1973:*34*, 7. Jahr). In ms DK.A and its apographs, however, the month appears as \"the middle summer month\" (dbyar zla 'bring po), which signifies either the third (hor zla gsum pa) or the fifth Tibetan lunar calendar month (hor zla Inga pa). In all the major calendrical systems, these dates correspond respectively to Thursday April 9, 1153 CE or Saturday June 7, 1153 CE in the Gregorian calendar (ibid.).

The fact that his heart did not burn [in the funeral pyre] gave rise to marvel. ltlzi.223 105 This short passage describes the events that took place when Bsod nams rin chen passed away in 1153. There is, however, an element in the poem which could suggest that it was not written right after his death, but considerably later. In the poem's second verse it is stated that the corpse was placed inside the large temple (mchod khang chen mo). The reference to a large temple may be anachronistic, since the building generally known as the \"large temple\" in the Dags lha sgam po hermitage224 first was constructed in the 1180s by the hermitage's fourth abbot Dags po 'Dul 'dzin (1 134-1218), some thirty years after Bsod nams rin chen's death.225 If the reference is to this building, the poem must have been written after its chen's death. Thus, while all sources agree on the year of his death, there is disagreement on the concrete month. 219 The translation is here according to ms DK.a. In ms DK.A and its apographs, the sentence literally reads \"based on a bit of conditions,\" which hardly makes sense. 220 Ms DK.a gives the date as the sixteenth, whereas ms DK.A and its derivatives give the date as the eighteenth. 221 Gung thang (here spelled according to ms DK.A and its derivatives) is the locality in Southern Tibet, where Bsod nams rin chen went to study with Mi la ras pa. Ms DK.a spells the name Gung tang, but that is probably an orthographic error. 222 Gnyal is Bsod nams rin chen's place of birth. 223 Ms DK.a ends the segment with this auspicious syllable, which is not attested by ms DK.A and its derivatives. The syllable occurs frequently in DK.a at the end of segments. 224 Dags Iha sgam po is the name of the small hermitage constructed by Bsod nams rin chen and his students at the place on Mt. Sgam po where Bsod nams rin chen had been living in solitary meditation retreat for many years in the latter half of his life. Mount Sgam po is located in Central Tibet, in the Dags po region, near the present-day town of Rgya tsha, just north of the Yar klungs gtsang po river, in the modern district of Lho kha. It is south-west of Kong po, east of '01 kha, and north-west of Mt. Tsa ri.

The only building project during his lifespan that is mentioned in the available sources is a small, primitive stilp a that he asked his students to construct for the purpose of practicing circumambulation.226 When a large gathering was held at the hermitage in 1145 at the occasion when Bsod nams rin chen offi­cially appointed his nephew Dags po Bsgom tshul to be his Dhanna successor, a camp of yak hair tents (ru ba) had to be set up to house the gathering.227 Nevertheless, according to a seventeenth-century local history of Dags Iha sgam po, there was an \"old temple\" (chos khang rnying ma) which existed prior to Bsod nams rin chen's death. It is told that after his cremation, a nw!i<fala of deities was invited to come from the old temple into a new large stupa that was being built by Phag mo gru pa to house the ashes and relics from Bsod nams rin chen's cremation.228 Hence, it is vaguely possible that the author had this small, old temple in mind when he spoke in the poem of \"the large temple.\" It must though be underlined that the cited source in question is rather late (seven­teenth century) in terms of serving as reliable evidence. 3.1.c.

Judging from Bsod nams rin chen's manner of classifying the Buddhist teachings in other works in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, it is evident that he uses the expression \"the path of perfection\" to signify the Common Maha­yana teachings in general while distinguishing these from the teachings of the \"Secret Mantra Vehicle\" (gsang sngags kyi theg pa, *guhyamantrayiina). 242 Literally, \" .. .in the presence of Dge bshes Snyug rum pa and Rgya Yon bdag\" (dge bshes snyug rum pa dang/ rgya yon bdag gnyis kyi spyan sngarl). For these two Dge bshes-s, see footnotes 166 and 167. 243 Tibetan language usually omits personal pronouns and the subject of sentences, leaving these implicit, unless they are needed for clarifying the meaning. The subject is often implied merely by the form of the verb, where there is a choice between regular and honorific forms, and honorific forms cannot be used with reference to oneself. In the present segment, the personal pronoun \"I\" (nga) was explicit in the first sentence, \"To begin with, when I reached the age of sixteen ... \" The first person pronoun (nga rang) occun-ed again in the sentence, \"Since then, I have [always] been good when it came to meditation.\" In all other sentences, the subject \"I\" was implicit in Tibetan, though justified to insert into the English translation given the overall flow of the narrative and the author's choice of verbal forms. However, in the present sentence which has no explicit subject, the narrative breaks away from this flow, because it uses an honorific verb and other honorific words to speak about Bsod nams rin chen. It also quotes a statement that seems to have been spoken by Bsod"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"108 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition vated] the resolve for Awakening (bodhicitta) was [due to] the kindness of these two [teachers].

Thereby, the author, who is not Bsod nams rin chen, reveals himself, stepping away from the 'autobio-graphical' character of the narrative. 244 Ms DK.A strengthens the sentence by saying \"[my] mind became exceedingly faithful.\" 245 The duration of his travel from Central Tibet to Gtsang in the present story is much shorter than the four months the journey was said to have taken in the first 'autobiographical' narrative, where Bsod nams rin chen was delayed by the illness of his companion 'Gong ston. It is in general notable that 'Gong ston, who fi gured prominently in the first narrative, is entirely absent in the present story. 246 Ms DK.A and its derivatives add the interlinear note, \"the ox year\" (glang lo), i.e., the earth­ox year (sa glang) corresponding to 1109 CE.

I dreamt that while you were staying here, you and I competed in a foot race. Since you came in first, it seems to indicate that you will bring about bigger benefit for sentient beings than I will. Also, once I dreamt that I threw a boulder larger than a tent to another land, but when you struck it with both your hands it turned into a pile of dust.

Later, knowledge emerged truly. In my case, I had a good dream and not long thereafter the self-nature of knowledge was seen vividly, like meeting a person I knew from before.

The mind, being without support, emerged as both present and empty.271 I felt from the very beginning of this, that there was a moment of recognition. All phenomena turned into an outer shell.

While the Tibetan term gsal ba literally means 'clear' or 'clarity', the Sanskrit term vyakta literally means 'before the eyes', i.e., to be lucidly present and exceedingly mindful of everything.

It also leaves out any mention of Bsod nams rin chen's companion 'Gong ston, who figured so prominently in the first narrative. Providing fewer details, it then recounts Bsod nams rin chen's study with the Bka' gdams teachers Snyug rum pa and Rgya Yon bdag in Central Tibet. In its third part, it describes his apprenticeship under the yogi Mi la ras pa. Bla ma Mi la's reaction to Bsod nams rin chen's former meditation practice differs considerably from the first narrative, since Mi la here rejects his Bka' gdams practice, saying it was unsuccess­ful. In general, the present narrative does not emphasize Bsod nams rin chen's Bka' gdams ties in the same positive vein as seen in the first narrative. 277 \"The visions of the interim\" (bar do 'i snang ba), i.e., the experiences that a normal person is said to encounter in the afterlife between death and rebirth (bar do, *antarabhava). 278 \"The venerable Bla ma\" (bla ma rj e btsun) is not identified in the text but the phrase here seems to refer to one of Bsod nams rin chen's teachers, probably Mi la ras pa who is often referred to as \"venerable\" (rje btsun). 279 The toponym's spelling is according to ms DK.a.

SHERPA (2004:74) has suggested that the phrase 'da' ba'i lo la, \"in the year that passed,\" alternatively could be taken as meaning \"in the year of [the Bla ma's] passing\", thereby becoming an argument for accepting 1123 as the year in which Mi la ras pa passed away. DUFF (2011 :95) interprets the same phrase as meaning \"in his year of passage\", taking it as referring to 1153 when Bsod nams rin chen died.

Finally, the monks in the audience request Bsod nams rin chen to tell about his medita­tive experiences, and accordingly the remainder of the segment describes the inner experi­ences of realization that he achieved in Se ba valley and other places. When comparing the two 'autobiographical' narratives, their general structures are similar, though there is little consensus regarding the details. Instead of seeing these seg­ments as inconsistent autobiographical accounts, their differing emphases may be viewed a s indicating varying preferences on part of the two authors who wrote them. 3.2. Phag mo gru pa Rdo rj e rgyal po 's \"A Prayer of Grief at the Time of Sgam po pa's Passing Away \" The narrative construct of Bsod nams rin chen was not only crafted by means of the type of first-person narrative seen above in the Answers to Questions texts (zhus Zan). Another literature that yielded significant influence thereon was the genre of eulogies (bstod pa). While such eulogies do not provide much of a coherent story , they bring to fore Bsod nams rin chen's import by extolling his religious qualities, thereby revealing certain tendencies of religious interpretation. Among Bsod nams rin chen's students, it was in particular Phag mo gru pa Rdo rje rgyal po who took up this genre, composing several poems about his teacher, two of which shall be presented here.282 Rdo rje rgyal po came to the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage in 1151 i n order to study meditation practice with Bsod nams rin chen and stayed there till 1154, one year after Bsod nams rin chen's death in 1153.283 282 Besides the two eulogies translated here, there are at least two other Sgam po pa eulogies ascribed to Rdo rj e rgyal po. One is the Bde gshegs chen po sgam po pa'i bstod pa found in the earliest Phag mo gru pa'i blw' 'bum, edited in 1507 by 'Bri gung pa Kun dga' rin chen (1475-1 527), vol. Ka, folios 297a6-298a2 (see SCHILLER, 2002:216 entry 47). I wish heartily to thank Dr. Alexander SCHILLER for providing me with a photocopy of the Sgam po pa eulogies from the 1507 bka' 'bum along with a copy of his thesis on Rdo rj e rgyal po. Another eulogy is known in later editions as Rj e sgam po pa la bstod pa gsol 'debs ma badzra riidziis mdzad pa, which is found untitled in the Phag gru'i gsung, an early dbu med manuscript of Rdo rj e rgyal po's collected works (TBRC WICZ688-1 1CZ858, folios 97a-99b).

SCHILLER (2002:134) has, more­over, identified the block-print of yet another eulogy entitled Dags po rin po che'i bstod pa phag mo gru pas mdzad pa. Since these additional eulogies do not contain any biographical information, they have not be translated here. 283 See SCHILLER (2002:74-76).

The text is now found in the Manifo ld Sayings (bka ' 'bum) of Phag mo gru pa.284 The eulogy seems to have been composed in 1153 shortly after Bsod nams rin chen's death. For the funeral, Rdo rje rgyal po was responsible for constructing the crematory stitpa, which was later used to house the personal clothes, ashes, and relics of the master.285 It is likely that the eulogy was written some time after the funeral, given that it mentions events taking place one month after the cremation. This is indeed how the eulogy has been contextualized in the later hagiographical tradi­tion starting with the large Sgam po pa hagiography (rnam thar chen mo) composed in the late fourteenth century by the second Zhwa dmar pa Mkha' spyod dbang po (1350-1405). In Mkha' spyod dbang po's depiction of the event, the \"Dge bshes from Eastern Tibet\" (dge bshes khams pa), i.e., Rdo rje rgyal po, announced at the funeral that he would remain in Dags Iha sgam po for the remainder of the year in order to support Bsod nams rin chen's nephew Dags po Bsgom tshul, who a few years prior, at the young age of thirty, had been installed as Bsod nams rin chen's spiritual successor. Rdo rje rgyal po is said to have sung the present eulogy in response to a request (dri rmed) made by a group of yogis, who arrived at the hermitage shortly after Bsod nams rin chen's death but who came too late for attending the funeral ceremony.286 Rdo rje rgyal po then sang to them as follows, describing what had happened during the funeral: 284 See 'Bri gung pa Kun dga' rin chen's Phag mo gru pa'i bka' 'bum, vol. Ka, folios 302a2-303a1 (SCHILLER, 2002:216 entry 52). The eulogy is also found in Phag gru 'i gsung (TBRC WlCZ688-IlCZ858, folios 97a-99b).

Although engulfed by the flames of primordial wisdom, [Bsod nams rin chen's] Heart remained untouched and fell into the hands of the Dhanna master.290 This was taken to portend that the students and followers would Forever be held by the iron-hooked noose of [Bsod nams rin chen's] compassion. 287 The eulogy's title is not attested at the beginning of the passage in the earliest textual witnesses, viz. 'Bri gung pa Kun dga' rin chen's Phag mo gru pa'i bka' 'b um and the dbu med manuscript called Phag gru'i gsung. 288 Given the two different systems of calculating the seasonal months into the Tibetan lunar months (see ZHANG, 1984: 1118), the mid-autumn month (ston zla 'bring po) corresponds either to the sixth or to the eighth Tibetan lunar month (hor zla). The subsequent mention of the Alpha Pegasi constellation (khrums stod) clarifies that it is the eighth lunar month that is meant here, thus corre­sponding to September 4, 1153 CE, in the Gregorian calendar. In the xylograph of Zhwa dmar Mkha' spyod dbang po's Sgam po pa hagiography, an unnamed hand has added an enthusiastic interlinear note to this line stating, \"This is [the same as] the tradition that I calculated. \" ('di bdag brtsis pa 'i lugs yin). 289 The Alpha Pegasi constellation (khrums stod, \"p urvabhadrapadii) is the 251h lunar mansion associated with the eighth month of the Tibetan lunar year. 290 Rdo rj e rgyal po does not clarify whom it is that he here refers to with the epithet \"Dhanna master\" (chos rj e), i.e., the person who received Bsod nams rin chen's unburned heart from the funeral pyre. In Mkha' spyod dbang po's Sgam po pa hagiography (p. 417 6), it is \"Slob dpon Sgom pa\" (*iiciirya Sgom pa) who addresses the crowd after Bsod nams rin chen's heart has been discovered unburned in the crematory hearth. Slob dpon Sgom pa is the hagiography's shorthand for Bsod nams rin chen's elder nephew and lineage-holder, Slob dpon Bsgom pa (or, Sgom pa) Tshul khrims snying po, i.e., Dags po Bsgom tshul."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition For a whole month, offerings were made to the remains.

This find was assigned particular significance for the future of Bsod nams rin chen's tradition.296 The author also gives voice to the somber mood of loss that was felt by Bsod nams rin chen's disciples at the death of their beloved teacher. A highly momentous feature is the poem's reference to two bodhisattvas by the names Supu�pacandra (me tog zla mdzes) and Candraprabha Kumara (zla 'od gzhon nu) in the 294 'The [four] bases for gathering [disciples]' (bsdu dngos bzhi, *catu(1sa111gralzavastu) refer to four sympathetic activities used by a Dharma teacher to care for his community, viz. generosity, affectionate speech, helpful activity, and equality with regard to the common good.

The bodhisattvas in question appear in the Indian Samiidhiriijasiitra, a very large Mahiiyiina scripture that in its earliest version is datable to the second century CE.298 The Sittra commences with a scene where a young man (kwniira, gzhon nu) named Candra­prabha (Zla 'od, meaning \"moonlight\") asks Buddha Sakyamuni how one might realize the true nature of things. The Buddha replies that this is to be done by practicing a meditation (samiidhi, ting nge 'dzin) wherein one realizes the equanimity of everything. Candraprabha is thus the main recipient of the Buddha's teaching of this Siltra and there are several passages in the scripture where Candraprabha declares and promises that he is going to promulgate and uphold the teaching of the Siltra in the future dark age when the Buddha's Dharma will be nearing its end in this world.299 In the course of explaining the meditation to Candraprabha, the Buddha illustrates his teaching with several stories about past buddhas and bodhisattvas and also tells a few stories about his own former lives. Thus, in chapter 35 of the Siitra,300 the Buddha narrates the tragedy of the bodhisattva Supu�pacandra (Me tog zla mdzes, §ffi* R � Shlhua Yueyan, literally meaning \"pretty flower moon\") to illustrate the many hardships that a bodhisattva may have to undergo in order to preserve and teach the Dharma. Supu�pacandra is said to 297 Op.cit.

For a general summary of the Siitra, see POTTER (1998: 185-192). 299 For such passages in the text, see the Sanskrit edition by VAIDYA ( 1961: 181.16; Tibetan translation Dl27.l2£4.7), a passage in the Tibetan recension (D 127.5lar5lb1), and VAIDYA (1961: 1301s- 1312; Dl27.66ar66b5). It should be added that one or more Bodhisattvic figures named Candraprabha (J=l :71C Yueguang) appear in several other Mahiiyiina Sittras and these figures have in some East Asian Buddhist traditions been historically associated with popular millennialist move­ments espousing belief in prophecies of a future revival, political revolution, and a golden age of Buddhism in China sparked by a reincarnation of Candraprabha. For a few short remarks on this topic, see ZURCHER (1959:315). The association between Bsod nams rin chen and Candraprabha to be discussed below is, however, explicitly only with reference to the Samiidhiriijasiltra and con­sequently seems to be unrelated to the broader narratives of the various Candraprabha figure(s) in Indian Mahayana traditions and the special significance these have had in Chinese Buddhism. Addi­tionally, it may be noted that the various stories concerning the Bodhisattva Candraprabha found in Mahayana scriptures differ from the Jiitaka story entitled the Candrap rabhiivadiina of King Candra­prabha who sacrificed his own head to a Brahmin. On the various versions of the Jiitaka story found in the Divyiivadiina and elsewhere along with notes on the text, see HARTMANN (1980). 300 It is chapter 35 in the Sanskrit edition, viz. the chapter entitled Supu�pacandraparivarta (VAIDYA, 1961:232-253). In the Tibetan translation (D l27.125arl4lb2), however, it is chapter 36, Me tog zla mdzes kyi le 'u."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"118 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition have lived in a very distant age when the teachings of a certain Buddha had almost fully disappeared. He was one of the last remaining individuals who held the teachings. He therefore set out to restore the Dhanna and went to a nearby kingdom to teach the people there. While the courtiers delighted in hearing his teachings, the local king was hostile to the newcomer and had him executed. Special omens in the form of lights appeared at the bodhisattva's corpse, whereupon the king realized his wrongdoing and converted to the Buddha's Dharma. At the end of the story, Sakyamuni tells that he was that king in a former life, while Candraprabha, the young man in the audience who had requested the teaching, was the reincarnati on of the age-old bodhisattva Supu�pacandra.301 When Rdo rje Rgyal po in the present eulogy refers to Supu?pacandra and Candraprabha,he does so in the context of describing the auspicious signs surrounding Bsod nams rin chen's cremation. Hence, it would seem that the general context of the reference is to create a comparison between the miracles and special omens surrounding Bsod nams rin chen'sfuneral and the scriptural story describing a similar event, wherein the corpse of an important bodhisattva was perceived by the king as being effulgent with lights. When the king of the distant past saw the good omens at Supu?pacandra's death, he was converted tothe Dharma, which in tum led him to become Buddha Sakyamuni in the future, at whichoccasion the auspicious event arose in which the Buddha taught the Samiidhiriijasutra toSupu?pacandra's reincarnation as Candraprabha. Analogously, Rdo rje rgyal po expresses the solemn wish in the eulogy's final verse that by the blessing of having now met such a noble individual as Bsod nams rin chen, may he and the other followers come to be reborn in a Buddha land and there encounter Bsod nams rin chen again in order to reach Bud­dhahood. When the lines of the poem are read in this way, they do not seem to suggest that Rdo rje rgyal po designed them as an explicit declarati on intended to express that Bsod nams rin chen was a specific reincarnation of these ancient bodhisattvas. Rather, he seems just to have meant the reference as a scriptural comparison between Bsod nams rin chen's funeral and the omens surrounding the death of Supu�pacandra. Nonetheless, the ensuing tradition -including numerous later hagiographies and even another poem composed by or attributed to Rdo rje rgyal po -did not read the lines in this way. Instead of reading the phrase gzhon nur gyur [pa] as being the usual Tibetan ren­dering of the Sanskrit expression kumarabhuta, simply meaning \"a young man,\" the final 301 See VAIDYA (1961:25215): padmottaro 'yam iisi supu�pacandro (D 127. 14la7: me tog zla mdzes padma bla ma yin). Translation: \"You are Supu�pacandra, the finest of lotus flowers.\" For a longer English paraphrase of the story, see THRANGU (1994:127-1 30). For a detailed comparison of the story with earlier Buddhist versions of the story of the teacher of forbearance (K�antivadin) along with a summary, see SKILTON (2002). Regarding the verb iisi (\"you are\") in the cited sentence, this is a Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit form of the regular Sanskrit second person singular indicative present tense verb asi (see EDGERTON, 1953.1:1 34). The lengthening of the vowel a to a may simply be due to metrical reasons, and it is clear that it here does not carry any subjunctive or imperative sense, as also attested by the Tibetan translation (yin); for discussion of these possible senses of the lengthe­ned form iisi, see EDGERTON (ibid.)."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 119 syllable gyur instead was taken as being a finite verb, \"[you] were\", thereby leading to the reading: \"[You] were Supu�pacandra in a distant age and Candraprabha Kumara in the presence of Buddha [Sakya]muni. \"302 With such a reading, Rdo rje rgyal po's poem turned into a strong declaration regarding the sanctity of Bsod nams rin chen's former lives. His religious activities in Dags Iha sgam po thereby came to be interpreted as being the result of Candraprabha's ancient promise to the Buddha to uphold and spread the meditation teach­ings of the Samiidhiriijasiltra, and Bsod nams rin chen thus came to be viewed as an age­old bodhisattva who had long ago been prophesied by the Buddha himself, thereby raising him to a virtually divine status.303 In spite of the fact that there have been some modern attempts to link the Siltra Mahamudrii doctrine of Bsod nams rin chen with the teachings of the Samiidhiriijasiltra,304 there is, in fact, no evident linkage between the meditation (samiidhi, ting nge 'dzin) spoken of in the Samiidhirii jasiltra and Bsod nams rin chen's contemplative instructions. The Siltra does not seem to play any particular role in the texts associated with him and, aside from three quotations of general nature from the Siltra among the many other Siltra quotations found in the Jewel Ornament of Liberation, there are no references to this scripture in the forty texts of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum.305 Conversely, the Samiidhiriij asatra does not contain any concrete meditation teaching that is reminiscent of Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii 302 Op.cit. (folios 302b5): sngon gyi dus kyi me tog zla mdzes la/ lthub pa'i pyan sngar zla 'ad gzhon nur gy ur/. 303 For a list of some of the Sgam po pa hagiographies that include references to the Samadhi­rajasiitra in order to present Bsod nams rin chen as being the reincarnation of these bodhisattvas, see SHERPA (2004:299). To his list needs to be added the early hagiography composed by Bla ma Zhang G.yu Brag pa Brtson 'grus grags (1123-1193) (TBRC W13994-3025, folio 32a4). An early reference to the belief is also found in a saying by Chos rj e Lo ras pa Dbang phyug brtson 'grus (1187-1 250) (TBRC W23440-1755, p. 57845) as well as in another poem attributed to Phag mo gru pa Rdo rj e rgyal po's authorship, namely the eulogy entitled What Should be Known (Shes bya ma) to be translated and discussed below (see section 3.3 of the present chapter). 304 For such an attempt by a contemporary bla ma of the Karma Kam tshang tradition, see THRANGU (1994) . A recent book on the life of the tenth Karma pa Chos dbying rdo rj e (1604-1674) also mentions that such linkage between the Samadhirajasiitra and Maham udra teachings was promoted in the seventeenth century: \"Karmapa also explained in great detail the meaning of the Samadhiraja Sutra. He explained how the advanced Mahamudra teachings of Kagyupa matched all the points and meanings expounded in that sutra. He showed that there was no difference between the two\" (SHAMAR, 2012:211). The book cites an IS'h-century Tibetan rnam thar source for this information, but the stated folio reference is evidently incorrect and it has not been possible to locate such a passage elsewhere in the text. Hence, it is uncertain whether the book's statement on this matter should be seen as yet another modern attempt to create such linkage or whether the passage verily is hidden in the pages of the l 8'h-century text. 305 For the three quotations from the Siitra in the Jewel Ornament, see GUENTHER (1959:2, 219, 269). For the problem of the authenticity of the authorship of the Jewel Ornament, in particular with regard to its scriptural quotations, many of which seem to be later interpolations, see KRAGH (2013c:388-391 )."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"120 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition doctrine. Hence, from a doctrinal point of view, there is little reason to believe that Bsod nams rin chen during his own lifetime was thought to be associated with the Samiidhi­riijasiitra and that he already at that time was considered to be a reincarnation of Candra­prabha.306 It is also notable that the sixteen passages in the Dags po 'i bka ' 'b um that mention the name Candraprabha Kumara (excluding Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub's sixteenth-century Sgam po pa hagiography) all seem to be late layers of the corpus that most likely po stdate Bsod nams rin chen by one or more generations. Moreover, there are several early hagiographies that make no mention of Bsod nams rin chen's canonical bodhisattva status, which would be curious if such a significant belief were widespread during his lifetime. The tendency to interpret Rdo rje rgyal po's poem as a declaration of Bsod nams rin chen's bodhisattva status may not only have been caused by religious fervor. There might also have been more pressing reasons, namely a need to justify the authenticity of Bsod nams rin chen's novel style of meditational practice and thereby ease eventual tensions felt between the traditional Bka' gdams tradition and Bsod nams rin chen's novel movement, which consisted of Bka' gdams pa monks practicing Tantric yogas and Mahamudrii. While such tensions only surface far and between in the earliest sources, they become more apparent in the slightly later literature. An example is seen in the second 'autobiographical' passage translated above, when Mi la ras pa is depicted as having entirely rejected Bsod nams rin chen's former Bka' gdams pa style of meditation practice during their first meeting.In contrast thereto, the first 'autobiographical' passage has Mi la ras pa warmly approve of Bsod nams rin chen's former practice at the same occasion. According to the fifteenth-century religious history The Blue Annals, a renowned Bka' gdams pa teacher of the eleventh century named Po to ba Rin chen gsal (1027/1031-1105) used to underline his strict adherence to the Common Mahayana teachings (as opposed to Tantric practices) by saying: \"What is called Mahiimudrii agrees in meaning with the Samiidhiriij asiitra and we should neither criticize it nor practice it.\" Saying so, Po to ba held in high esteem only the teachings of Atifa.307 When considering the dates of Po to ba, it is clear that his use of the word Mahamudra -if the saying is authentic -could not have referred to the Mahamudrii doctrine of Bsod nams rin chen, since Po to ba died in 1105, sixteen years before Bsod nams rin chen began to 306 There is a single rather late source that places the association between Candraprabha and Bsod nams rin chen in Bsod nams rin chen's own mouth, namely the narrative entitled \"Master Gampopa's Song of Response to the Three Men from Kham: Shomo! Come Back up!\" (Rje sgam po pa dang khams pa mi gsum gyi zhu lan sho mo yar shog gi mgur) found in the sixteenth-century compilation Bka' brgyud mgur mtsho (English title, Rain of Wisdom). As discussed above (fn. 128), the story, however, contains other elements that call for rejecting it as being an authentic historical source. 307 The Blue Annals (CHANDRA, 1974:2402-3; ROERICH, 1949:268-269): phyag rgya chen po skad pa 'di mdo ting nge 'dzin gyi rgyal po'i don yin!

Instead, Po to ba must have been referring to an earlier form of Mahiimudrii, which could be Mahiimudra in general as signifying the highest stage of the Anuttara­yogatantras, or it could be the (Tantric) Mahamudra doctrine of Maitripa that had been spread in Tibet by the Indian master Vajrapai:ii in the 1070s, or it could eventually be the Mahiimudrii teachings of the Indian siddha teacher Pha dam pa Sangs rgyas (b. eleventh c entury), who had been active in the area of Ding ri in southern Tibet. When Po to ba compared \"what is called Mahiimudrii\" (phyag rgya chen po skad pa) to the meditation teachings of the Samiidhiriijasutra, it seems that he did so in order not to deny the Indian origin and authenticity of these Mahamudrii teachings. Saying so, he admonished his Bka' gdams pa monks neither to speak ill of (smod pa) Mahamudrii nor to practice it ('jug pa), but simply to stick to the teachings of Atifa (Jo bo rj e'i chos). If Po to ba's saying is authentic, though the fifteenth-century source containing it is admittedly a very late witness, then it is conceivable that the students of Bsod nams rin chen or perhaps even Bsod nams rin chen himself may have used Po to ba's statement to their own advantage. It must though be underlined that there seem to be no references to Po to ba's saying neither in the Bka' brgyud texts voicing critiques of the Bka' gdams pa tradition nor in Bka' brgyud apologetic Mahiimudra writings, for which reason the possible significance of Po to ba's saying in terms of declaring Bsod nams rin chen to be a reincar­nation of Supu�pacandra and Candraprabha from the Samiidhiriijasutra proposed here should presently just be regarded as speculative and hypothetical .308 By declaring Bsod nams rin chen to be the bodhisattva Candraprabha who was pro­phesied in the Sutra to be the one to spread the &itra's meditational teachings in the future, Bsod nams rin chen obtained an unquestionable canonical authority, a teaching license issued by Buddha Sakyamuni himself, which would have to be respected by anyone familiar with Po to ba's supposed statement. Having gained such status, it would be difficult to criticize Bsod nams rin chen's doctrine, since the highly esteemed Bka ' gdams pa master and lineage-holder Po to ba had spoken approvingly of Mahiimudrii and its association with a recognized Mahayana Sutra, even if the Bka' gdams pa monks who practiced Mahiimudra teachings might, in tum, be criticized for going against Po to ba's admonition not to practice such a path. In that scenario, the Bka' brgyud references to Candraprabha Kumara might have been a way for the monks of Bsod nams rin chen's community , who mostly hailed from the Bka' gdams pa tradition, to defend their doctrines and novel medi­tation styles against any critique from the institutionally already well-established Bka' gdams pa movement. If so, that would indicate that there existed a certain pressure on Bka' brgyud monks to justify themselves and their practices in front of their more orthodox brethren. 308 While no references to this or any other saying by Po to ba regarding Mahiimudrii are attested in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, it is evident that the authors of the corpus, generally speaking, were aware of Po to ba's teachings and opinions, because other references are given in four passages to Po to ba's views on meditation practice.

Tha. 13, DK.A.Tha.29, and DK.A.La.2."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"122 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition In any case, whether or not the Candraprabha reference and Po to ba's supposed saying are pieces in the historical puzzle of such sectarian tensions, it is evident that Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii approach and its differences to the earlier Bka' gdams pa system of practice were doctrinally significant for the newly formed Bka' brgyud tradition to develop into a distinct monastic institution. In contrast thereto, Bsod nams rin chen's Tantric teacher Mi la ras pa had remained the center of a group of carefree lay or yogf ascetics, who practiced Tantric yogas in the wilderness without feeling any need for founding fixed hermitages or larger religious institutions, such as monasteries. Since the Bka' brgyud tradi­tion with Bsod nams rin chen and his students became institutionally more established with new hermitages and monasteries serving as a socio-economic base for the sect, the consequence was that the former non-celibate Tiintrika style of practice gradually became more and more peripheral and minimal within the tradition.309 In other words, soon most Bka' brgyud followers were monks, whose monastic lineage had been derived from the Bka' gdams transmission. Bsod nams rin chen was himself a Bka' gdams pa monk, as were most of his students. Yet, the original Bka' gdams pa tradition did not subside with the onset of Bsod nams rin chen's new doctrine, but continued to exist side by side with the new Bka' brgyud traditions. It remains a question, which is in need of further research, how the traditional Bka' gdams pa monks reacted to the divergent monks, who had turned to the newly emerging Bka' brgyud traditions, and how the earliest Bka' brgyud monks integrated or separated their teachings from the surrounding Bka' gdams tradition. Later sources allude to some Bka' gdams pa criticisms of the Bka' brgyud school,310 and the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum contains numerous passages that discuss similarities and differences between the Bka' gdams doctrines, Mi la ras pa's teachings, and Bsod nams rin chen's style of practice.311 3.3. Phag mo gru pa's Eulogy \"What Should be Known\" Another eulogy attributed to Rdo rje rgyal po is a laudation entitled \"What Should be Known\" (Shes bya ma). The title is derived from the opening words of its first Tibetan verse (shes bya 'i mkha' la ... ). The text's colophon states that it was put together by Phag mo gru pa. The name Phag mo gru pa simply means \"the one from Phag mo gru,\" the latter being a toponym, and could in principle refer to any person from this place. As an epithet, the expression is though closely associated with Rdo rje rgyal po and it therefore suggests him to be the composer. The authorship is, however, not entirely certain, since the work was never included in the Manifold Sayings (bka ' 'bum) of Rdo rje rgyal po. A copy of the text was included in the 309 To this should be added that a revival of Mi la ras pa's yogf tradition took place in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, initiated by the Ras pa Gtsang smyon He ru ka Sangs rgyas rgyal mtshan (1452-1 507). 310 See David P.

The Shes bya ma eulogy mentions Bsod nams rin chen's death and must therefore have been written after 1153. If its authorship is authentic, it must have been composed prior to Rdo rje rgyal pa's own death in 1170. If the author is a different person, then it could have been written any time between 1153 and 1519 when it was finally printed in Dags lha sgam po. The eulogy's first verse makes a reference to the Bka' brgyud lineage, which seems to suggest that it is a work postdating Rdo rje rgyal po, since this label for Bsod nams rin chen's tradition was rare although not completely unknown in the mid-twelfth century and 31 2 DK.A.*Ji, 3 folios, being an undesignated addendum placed after text DK.A.Chi. 313 As has been argued elsewhere, the eulogy was perhaps not part of the original version of the 1520 edition, but may have been included at a later stage into the print (KRAGH, 2013c:373). The eulogy's original publication colophon states that it was printed at Dags Iha sgam po (Iha ri sgam po) sponsored by the descendant of Sgam po pa (sgam po pa'i dbon po), the kinsman Rgya mtsho (a bo rgya mtsho) when he was seven years old.

The kinsman Rgya mtsho is probably referring to Don yod rgya mtsho (1 513-1587), the first Sgam po pa sp rul sku, who later became known under the monastic name Sgam po Bkra shis mam rgyal. Don yod rgya mtsho was the nephew (dbon po) of Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub (1488-1 552), the abbot of Dags Iha sgam po who was in charge of producing the first printed edition of Dags po'i bka' 'bum in 1520. Don yod rgya mtsho arrived at Dags Iha sgam po at the age of seven, i.e., in 1519, to begin his studies. Phag mo gru pa's eulogy may thus have been printed at that occasion, paid for by Don yod rgya mtsho, and might only some time later have been included in the 1520 edition of the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum.

The phrase Bdud rtsi thab sbyor (Amrtaku!icfall) is the name of a wrathful Tantric deity, whose mantra often is recited in various kinds of Tibetan ritual liturgy for the purpose of dispelling obstac­les and purification, e.g., when preparing a ritual offering. For an example with both mantra and ritual context, see BEYER (1978:348), where the name Amrtaku!i<falf is referred to in English as \"swirling nectar.\" The hand gesture (mudrii) associated with the recitation of the mantra of Amrta­ku!J<falf involves placing the palms flat together in the traditional Indian gesture of greeting (thal sbyor, *aiijali) above the head and then moving the hands downwards from over the head to the front of the chest while making a sideways waving or circling motion with the palms held together. It would seem that it is the use of the thal sbyor ( *aiijali) gesture in the ritual mudra associated with Amrtakw:z<jalfthat may have been the reason for mistaking thab sbyor with thal sbyor in the name of the deity. 334 \"The fifteenth day of the sixth month of the female water bird year,\" i.e., Tuesday July 7, 1153 CE in the Gregorian calendar (SCHUH, 1973:*34*, 7.

These include visions, manifestations of bodily emana­tions, and special experiences that his students had during empowerments or consecration rituals. It also includes a short outline of his religious vita. The eulogy's fifth verse makes another reference to Supu�pacandra and Candraprabha Kumara, which is here done in a manner that clearly intends to proclaim Bsod nams rin chen as being a reincarnation of these bodhisattvas. If Rdo rje rgyal po indeed is the author of the text, it would evince that he in this poem clearly initiated the tradition of regarding Bsod nams rin chen as being such a reincarnation.336 However, if the present eulogy is a pseudigraph written by a later writer, the author would simply be following the ensuing hagiographical tradition that evolved over the centuries following Bsod nams rin chen's life. 336 A reference to Bsod nams rin chen as being an emanation (sprul sku) of Candraprabha Kumara is additionally found in a religious song ascribed to Rdo rj e rgyal po entitled \"A Meditative Experiential Song about when the Glorious Phag mo Gru pa met the Master Sgam po pa\" (Dpal phag mo gru pa rj e sgam po dang mj al ba'i nyams mgur) .

The song does not seem to be included in 'Bri gung pa Kun dga' rin chen's original edition of Phag mo gru pa'i gsung 'bum compiled in 1507 (see the list of contents in SCHILLER, 2002:215-224) and the ascribed authorship of the song is rather questionable."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 131 The fifth verse also contains another significant scriptural reference, namely the phrase \"physician monk\" (dge slang 'tsho byed'). The same expression occurs at the end of verse seven. The phrase is a well-known reference to a passage from the Mahiikaru!iiipu!1¢arlka Sutra, which in the hagiographical tradition as well as in the present verse was regarded as a prophecy given by the Buddha to announce the future Bsod nams rin chen.337 In the sixth chapter of the Siltra, the Buddha gives a series of predicti ons to his disciple Ananda about various persons who will promote his teachings in the future. One of these is a monk named *Jfvaka ('Tsho byed, Q1p6jiii W�}@_), meaning \"physician,\" of whom it is said that he will teach the Mahiiyiina Dharma bringing benefit to many.338 Since Bsod nams rin chen studied medicine (gso ba rig pa) and worked as a physician (!ha rj e) prior to becoming a monk, there were some who in the second half of the twelfth century began to interpret the Sutra prediction as referring to him. This is probably also partly why Bsod nams rin chen in later sources often was referred to by epithet \"the doctor from Dags po\" (Dags po lha rj e). It should though be noted that the same Sutra passage continues by saying that the monk *Jlvaka will undertake an extensive renovation of a stupa containing the Buddha's relics. That part of the passage, however, was somewhat ignored by the Tibetan writers who adapted the Siltra's prophecy as a reference to Bsod nams rin chen, since this feature of the Siltra passage did not fit to him.339 3A. Phag mo gru pa's Verses on Naropa's Lineage Eulogies extol the bla ma's qualities to instill faith in the devotee and in the course thereof reveal religious interpretations of omens, visions, and other signs of spiritual accompli sh­ment. Still, a different facet of the narrative construct of Sgam po pa emerges in yet another 337 The earliest texts that refer to the Siitra passage are the Sgam po pa hagiographies by 'Ba' rom pa Dar ma dbang phyug (SHERPA, 2004:299) and Ela ma Zhang B1tson 'grus grags pa (TBRC WI 3994-3025, folio 32<4). 338 See the Mahakarwy'ipu�ic,la rfka Siitra (Dl l 1.84b2-3; Chinese version in T380.955b9_10). 339 Unless, of course, the primitive, small stone stiipa that Bsod nams rin chen had his disciples construct at the hermitage in order to practice circumambulation (see page 106) is to be regarded as being worthy of a prediction by the Buddha. It may be added that some hagiographers or text editors seem to have been aware of this problem, because in the 1520 xylograph print of Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub's Sgam po pa hagiography, a quotation of the Siitra passage is interrupted with an in­serted note written in smaller script briefly mentioning the repairs of key temples (gtsug lag khang) (perhaps also including some stiipas, it would seem) in Lha sa which Bsod nams rin chen's older nephew and lineage-holder, Slob dpon Bsgom pa (i.e., Tshul khrims snying po), undertook some years after Bsod nams rin chen had passed away (DK.A.Ga.2.61a3-4). The purpose of the interlinear note seems to be to make up for the apparent lack of correlation between the Stitra's prediction of *Hvaka and Bsod nams rin chen's life story on this point. Cf., however, the remarks on these repairs by WARNER (2008: 199, 209), who cites a sixteenth-century and a modern source that have Bsod nams rin chen attend the repairs in person (or perhaps in a vision?) in order to give advice to his nephew."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"132 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition Tibetan literary genre, namely in manuals containing yoga or meditation instructions (khrid yig). Such texts occasionally provide short histories of their transmission lineages that may include some hagiographical details of the individual masters. An early example of that genre is a short work likewise said to have been composed by Phag mo gru pa Rdo rje rgyal po. This is a manual on the Six Doctrines of Naropa (nii ro 'i chos drug) entitled \"The Succession in the Guru Lineage of the Six Doctrines of Guru Niiropa and a Brief Division of the Essential Points of the Instructions\" (Bia ma nii ro pa'i chos drug gi bla ma brgyud pa'i rim pa dang gdams ngag gnad kyi dbye ba mdor bsdus pa). The work is not included in the earliest version of Rdo rje rgyal po's Manifold Sayings340 but is found in a modern edition of his collected works.341 As a lineage history, the text narrates the transmission of a given teaching over several generations of teachers and disciples. In the case of the Six Doctrines of Naropa, the transmission begins with the Indian gurus Tilopa and Naropa, then carries on with the Tibetan master Mar pa Lotsa ba Chos kyi blo gros and his students Rngog Chos sku rdo rje (1022/1036-1102) and Mi la ras pa, and finally ends with Bsod nams rin chen, who was the author's own teacher. The literary act of placing earlier teachers in the context of such transmissions is of utmost importance for much instructional and liturgic al Tibetan literature, since it clarifies the lineages that authenticate the teaching activities of all the subsequent Tibetan bla mas who inherited these instructions. By singling out the few central figures of the early religious communities who were in charge of teaching and giving instructions, the genre also foregrounds the founding fathers while causing other less central members of the early Buddhist communities in Tibet to more or less disappear out of the historical picture. Understanding the purpose of such lineage texts is therefore crucial for inferring the nature of Tibetan biographical and historiographical literatures and the inherent limitations of these genres as historical sources. In the present lineage history of Naropa's Six Doctrines, the author begins by telling the stories of the above-mentioned preceding gurus. These stories are not translated here. The following is a translation of the passage concerned with Bsod nams rin chen, who is referred to as \"the venerable Ela ma from Gnyal\" (gnyal gyi rj e btsun bla ma):342 340 I.e., the gsung 'bum compiled by 'Bri gung pa Kun dga' rin chen in 1507 (see the table of contents in SCHILLER, 2002:21 5-225). 341 See Dus gsum sangs rgyas thams cad kyi thugs rj e'i rnam rol dp al ldan phag gru rgyal po mchog gi gsung 'bum rin po che, vol. 8, pp. 462-483 (TBRC W23891-3172).

Ye shes Bla ma's Hagiography of the Venerable Uncle and Nephew Short lineage histories found in meditation manuals, as here exemplified by Rdo rje rgyal po's verses on Naropa's yoga instructions, later developed into their own full-fledged literary form. The account of each master's vita became expanded into a full story standing on its own, whereby a series of separate accounts came to form a biographical cycle of texts,often tracing the history of a given lineage. In Tibetan literature, this genre generally became known as the 'hagiography' (rnam par thar pa or in short rnam thar) and cycles of such hagiographies telling the life stories of the successive generations of teachers of a given lineage came in the Bka' brgyud traditions to be known as \"The Golden Rosary of the Bka' brgyud Lineage\" (bka ' brgyud gser 'phreng ). 352 For the six kinds of clairvoyance (mngon shes, *abhijiiii), see KRAGH (2013a: 162). 353 The wheel adornment in the lines of the palms and soles of the feet is one of the thirty-two signs of great person (mahapuru�alak�mw, skyes bu chen po'i mtshan).

Full epics of the Buddha's life date back to around the second century CE with Asvagho�a's Buddha­carita, literally meaning \"The Wanderings of the Buddha,\" and the slightly later anonymous Lalitavistara Sutra, \"The Discourse on the Vast Display.\" Aside from such nar­ratives of the Buddha's life, Indian Buddhist life stories were mainly concerned with non­historical figures, such as accounts (avadiina, rtogs brjod) of the lives of various ahistorical bodhisattvas who were central to the sermons of major Mahayana scriptures.355 For this reason, Indian literature contains virtually no biographies even of the most renowned historical Mahayana masters, such as Nagarj una, Aryadeva, Asanga, or Vasubandhu. The Indian predilection for avoiding historical subjects differed completely from the inclina­tions of Chinese Buddhist literature, where accounts of celebrated historical monks and nuns became a popular and highly beloved genre already during the Tang Dynasty, particularly in the form of the \"memoirs of eminent monks or nuns\" (rB'J{� {W: Gaoseng Zhuan). In the tenth century, however, Buddhist and Jain authors in India also began to compose religious vitae of near-contemporary historical teachers. An early Buddhist example of such historical hagiography is the Guide to the Accomplishment of the Inborn (Sahajasiddhi­paddhati) written by the female Tantric master Lak�mI (ca. tenth century). Within the larger philosophical commentary of her composition, the authoress described the religious lives of a series of twelve earlier gurus, who had previously handed down her teaching on the inborn nature (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja) in the Swat valley of UcNiyan a in northwest­ern Pakistan. 356 Slightly later examples include the Nepalese Sham Sher Manuscript (eleventh-twelfth centuries) containing the vita of Maitripada (see TATZ, 1987) as well as the Bengali author AbhayadattasrI's Stories of the 84 Siddhas.357 The Indian hagiographies became known under such titles as \"prominent [lives]\" (prabhavaka), \"wanderings\" (carita or caritra), or \"the unfolding [of a life-story]\" (tshul, *vrtta). Shortly thereafter, probably in the first half of the twelfth century, the hagiographical genre (rnam thar) took roots in Tibetan literature as well. Some of the earliest examples of the genre are Gro lung pa Blo gros 'byung gnas's (ca. 1060-1130) hagiography of Rngog Lotsa ba Bio ldan shes rab (1059-1109) entitled \"The Hagiography of Bio ldan shes rab, the Sole Eyes of the World\" ('Jig rten mig gcig blo ldan shes rab gyi rnam thar)358 and partial life stories of Mar pa and Mi la ras pa composed by Mi la ras pa's student Ngam rdzong pa Byang chub rgyal po (ca. 1070-1130).

Yet, similar to the lineage history seen in Rdo rje rgyal po's verses on Naropa's transmission, hagiographies were also written as longer works or small cycles of texts whose topic was the life stories of a whole series o f gurus belonging to a particular teaching transmission. One of the earliest texts of such scope is an untitled lineage history of the tradition stemming from the Indian gurus Tilopa and Naropa composed by the Tibetan monk Ye shes Bla ma (1115-1176). Ye shes Bla ma was known under the epithet Rgyal ba Khyung tshang pa, meaning \"the Jina from the Garwfa Nest.\" Though Ye shes Bla ma was thirty-six years junior to Bsod nams rin chen, his religious career resembles that of Bsod nams rin chen in several regards. Like Bsod nams rin chen, Ye shes Bla ma was a Bka' gdams pa monk who began his mona­stic life with studying scriptures under several well-known monastic lecturers. Having completed his studies, he then went to learn Tantric practices from a yogi. Just as Bsod nams rin chen had learned from Mi la ras pa, Ye shes Bla ma practiced yogas under the guidance of Mi la ras pa's main student Ras chung pa Rdo rje grags (1084-1161) and Ye shes Bla ma subsequently became a major holder of Ras chung pa's contemplative instruc­tions known as \"the Hearing Lineage\" (snyan brgyud). Similar to Bsod nams rin chen and his mainly monastic hermitage on Mt. Sgam po, Ye shes Bla ma later in life cared for a small circle of Tantric monks, a gathering which thus differed fundamentally from the non­monastic yogi or ras pa communities that existed first around Mi la ras pa and later surrounding Ras chung pa.361 Given the fact that Ye shes Bia ma's composition includes a detailed hagiography ofBsod nams rin chen, it would seem that Ye shes Bla ma had met Bsod nams rin chen and 359 For a study, edition, and translation of the text, see DU CHER (2011 :39-44, 161-187). 36°For a study and translation of the text, see QUINTMAN (2006:144- 1 60, 292-374). See also the remarks in ROBERTS (2007:65-66). It may be noted that a hagiography of Atifa entitled Jo bo rj e'i rnam thar lam yig chos kyi 'byung gnas ascribed to his eleventh-century student 'Brom ston Rgyal ba'i 'byung gnas (1004/1005-1 064) must be dated to the thirteenth century and is not of 'Brom ston's authorship (EIMER, 1982:41-42). Hence, it is not to be counted among the earliest Tibetan hagio­graphies. 361 See Lho rang chos 'byung, Gangs can rigs mdzod vol. 26, Bod lj ongs bod yig dpe rnying dpe skrun khang, 1994, pp. 115-119, there referred to as Dge bshes Khyung tshang ba.

Ye shes Bla ma's own biography362 makes no mention of such an encounter, but the later hagiographical tradition of Bsod nams rin chen lists Ye shes Bia ma as one of the earliest students of Bsod nams rin chen, namely as s om eone who came to study at Dags lha sgam po already in the l 120s.363 Such an early date of their meeting, however, seems somewhat unlikely, given that Ye shes Bia ma was born in 1115, first became ordained in his teenage years, and spent several years studying with Bka ' gdams pa scholar monks before his interest in meditation began in earnest. Still, chronologically seen, it is not impossible that Ye shes Bla ma encountered Bsod nams rin chen later in life.

The final part of the text also adds the information in a colophon that it was \"composed by Rgyal ba Khyung tshang ba\" (rgyal ba khyung tshang bas mdzad pa'o). In all likelihood, Ye shes Bla ma's Sgam po pa hagiography is, in fact, the earliest actual hagiography on Bsod nams rin chen's life. In the first printe d edition of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum (ms DK.A) produced at Dags Iha sgam po in 1520, Ye shes Bla ma's text was broken up into two separate works (texts DK.A.Ka and DK.A.Kha) containing the hagiographies starting with Vajradhara until Mi la ras pa. The printer gave the first work (DK.A.Ka) a new title: \"The Hagiographies of Tailo and Naro composed by Master Sgam po pa\" (Rje sgam po pas mdzad pa'i tai lo nii ro 'i rnam thar). To the second work (DK.A.Kha), he gave the title: \"The Hagiographies of Master Mar pa and the Venerable Mi la\" (Rje mar pa dang rj e btsun mi la 'i rnam thar) . The last part of Ye shes Bla ma's composition containing the vita of Bsod nams rin chen, however, was entirely omitted from the xylograph publication (DK.A) and was replaced with a much longer Sgam po pa hagiography (DK.A.Ga) composed by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub himself, i.e., the publisher of the 1520 xylograph, being an embellished version of Zhwa dmar pa Mkha' spyod dbang po's large Sgam po pa hagiography (rnam thar chen mo). As a consequence, the final colophon of the cycles of Ye shes Bla ma's texts, wherein the name of the author was explicitly stated to be Ye shes Bla ma, was not included in the xylograph (DK.A) and for this reason the authorship of the printed hagiographies of Telopa to Mi la ras pa became unclear. Moreover, the new title given to the first text (DK.A.Ka) in the 1520 print suggested instead that the two cycles of hagiographies from Vajradhara to Mi la ras pa (DK.A.Ka and DK.A.Kha) had been composed by Bsod nams rin chen, which obviously is not the case. This misinformation have in several instances misled modem scholarship to believe that the hagiographies of the earlier masters were works by Bsod nams rin chen, as is stated explicitly in some of the existing Western scholarship (no need for names to be mentioned). Ye shes Bla ma's hagiographical cycle of texts seems to have been composed some time between 1153 and 1176. First of all, he refers to Bsod nams rin chen's eldest nephew Dags po Bsgom tshul as \"the precious meditator\" (rin po che sgom pa). The title \"precious\" (rin po che) seems to suggest that the text was written after 1145, when Bsod nams rin chen installed Dags po Bsgom tshul as his official spiritual successor and the abbot of the Dag Iha sgam po hermitage, thereby deserving him to merit the title rin po che. Hence, 1145 most probably constitutes a first terminus post quem for the writing of the text. Ye shes Bla ma's own death in 1176 serves as the terminus ante quem for the composition. Furthermore, Ye shes Bla ma states that Bsod nams rin chen's youngest brother, Slob dpon (* Acarya) Jo sras pa (dates unknown), whose lay name was Grags pa seng ge, was still alive at the time of writing the text. This information must implicitly be understood as being contrasted with Bsod nams rin chen, who thus presumably was no longer alive when the sentence was written. For this reason, the text seems to have been composed after Bsod nams rin chen's death in 1153, constituting a second terminus post quem, even though the latter part of Bsod nams rin chen's life and his death are not mentioned anywhere in the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 139 narrative. It is possible that Ye shes Bia ma only spent time at Dags Iha sgam po prior to Bsod nams rin chen's death an d chose to make earlier events the topic of his hagiography of the master. Although Tibetan hagiographies generally follow a very genre-specific format which usually includes descriptions of the guru's death and the special signs occurring at that occassion, Ye shes Bla ma's text may not be adhering to this format, since it was written at a very early stage of the newly developing Tibetan genre. It is here notable that Ngam rdzong pa's hagiographical narrative of Mi la ras pa's life also does not describe Mi la ras pa's death. The following is a full translation of Ye shes Bla ma's Sgam po pa hagiography without inclusion of the preceding hagiographies of the earlier Bka' brgyud gurus listed above: His student372 was the precious Bla ma Lha rj e.373 His place of birth was Dmyal,374 and he was of the Gnyi clan. [Bsod nams rin chen] told that his father was from a major ancestral lineage. His three forefathers were Brgya 'bar, Rdo rj e 'bar, and Rdo rj e. Brgya 'bar had three sons. Rdo rj e 'bar had many [sons], such as La sho !ta ba pa. Rdo rj e had no children.375 Brgya 'bar's three sons were the precious one,376 Ser ra, and Grags pa seng ge. The precious one had no sons.377 Ser ra had three sons and one daughter. His three sons were Rin po che Sgom pa, Sgom chung, [and] Grags mdzes.378 Including his daughter Glog ris Lha mo, there were four siblings altogether. As for Grags pa seng ge, he is [Bsod nams rin chen's] second brother [now known as] Acarya Jo sras pa, who is [still] alive today.379 372 'Student' (sras), literally 'son'. The personal pronoun 'his' refers to Mi la ras pa, whose vita was narrated in the immediately preceding portion of the text. 373 The title Lha rj e, which the ms DK.a spells lhar rj e, means 'physician'. 374 The ms DK.a spells this toponym Dmyal and later in the text spells it Mnyal, which probably refers to the region called Gnyal in later sources. 375 \"Had no children\" (rahs chad) , literally \"broke the family line.\" 376 \"The precious one\" (rin po che), i.e., Bsod nams rin chen. 377 Some later hagiographies, in fact, report that Bsod nams rin chen had children, a son and a daughter, prior to becoming a monk, but that they died along with his wife in an epidemic. 378 Rin po che sgom pa, meaning \"the precious meditator,\" was Bsod nams rin chen's eldest nephew Bsgom pa Tshul khrims snying po or, in short, Dags po Bsgom tshul (1 1 16-1169), who became a monk and was installed as Bsod nams rin chen's spiritual successor and abbot at the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage. Sgom chung, meaning \"the younger meditator\" or \"the little meditator,\" was Bsod nams rin chen's younger nephew Bsgom chung Shes rab byang chub (1130- 117 3), who likewise became a monk and who later in life served for four years as the second abbot of Dags Iha sgam po after his brother's death in 1169. It is not entirely clear whether the last nephew named Grags mdzes also became a monk and student of Bsod nams rin chen, but this is quite possible, because Bsod nams rin chen did indeed have a student named Sgom pa Grags mdzes (dates unknown) but the precise identity of that individual is unknown. 379 \"Who is [still] alive today \" (da !ta bzhugs pa), or \"who is staying [here] now.\" It is possible that Acarya (slob dp on) Jo sras pa refers to Bsod nams rin chen's student La yag Jo sras pa Byang chub dngos grub, a.k.a. La yag pa, who was responsible for promulgating a fourfold systematization of Bsod nams rin chen's teachings known as \"the Four Dhannas of Dags po\" (dags po'i chos bzhi)."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"140 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition The precious Bia ma was the eldest among [Brgya 'bar's] three sons.

After his wife passed away, he gave rise to faith and re­nounced [the life of a householder] for the sake of the Dharma. He thought to him­self, \"Having accumulated the gatherings [of beneficence and insight] throughout many rebirths, I have now obtained a precious free and endowed [human] exist­ence [with the capacity to practice the Dhanna].

La yag pa's dates are unknown, but if he were a younger brother of Bsod nams rin chen as perhaps suggested here, he must have been born between 1085 and 1110. Since Ye shes Bia ma mentions that he is still alive, presumably as opposed to Bsod nams rin chen, he must have died later than 1153, perhaps some time in the 1160s or '70s. 380 Bsam yas is here probably referring to the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet constructed with royal patronage in the 760s and 770s.

When the winds enter the central channel, which is one of the major steps in the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo), it means - figμratively speaking - that all thoughts and concepts dissolve into emptiness and that the meditator begins to experience a non-conceptual state. 386 See fn. 156."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition Saying that he wished to follow the custom of all Bka' gdams pa [monks] by going to Central Tibet (Dbu ru), he went there and listened to all the Bka' gdams instructions of the venerable master [Atifa's] tradition from the two Dge bshes-s Snyug rum pa and Rgya Yon bdag.387 [He] said that they both treated him kindly.388 [He also] told that meditative concentration of the highest kind arose very well [during this time]. Further, [he] said that earlier when he was young after having become married, he had meditated very forcefully on the inner winds and it had then briefly happened that the winds entered the central channel. [He] said that since he purified negative actions by relying on the Amoghapafa practice, he was advised to meditate on the inner winds without remainder.389 When he then heard the story of Ela ma [Mi la] ras pa, he felt trust [in him] and decided to ask Dge bshes Yon bdag for permission to go to him. When reque­sting this, he was given permission and went up to [Mi la] ras pa and learnt with him for thirteen months. He said that he was given all the instructions.

Dream (nni lam, *svapna) is the practice of lucid dreaming. Radiance ('od gsal, *iibhiisvara or *prabhii­svara) is a practice for maintaining awareness during deep sleep. 392 \"The four Dhannas [for] buddhahood without meditation\" (ma bsgom sangs rgyas chos bzhi). It is not immediately clear which practices are intended by this expression. Elsewhere (DK.A.Khi. 6. 16b3), the practice of Transference ('pho ba, *sa111kriinti) is taught as the method for achieving buddhahood without meditation (ma bsgoms par sangs rgya ba'i thabs), but only three types of Transference are taught in that context and not four as suggested by the reference to \"four Dhannas\" in the present passage. 393 \"The three [kinds of] mixing\" (bsre ba gsum). This line is not written in the meter of the verse and may be an insertion. The term 'mixing' (bsre ha, *mifra) is used in the context of several diffe­rent yogas in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, e.g., the mixing of the three types of interims (bar do , antariibhava). 394 \"Inner Heat, Dream, and Radiance\" (gtum mo nni lam 'od gsal gsum). Inner Heat (gtum mo, *cii!1r/iill) is the yoga of dissolving the winds into the central channel, thereby causing the white energy to descend from the cakra at the top of the head down through the central channel, leading to a sense of blissful (sexual) arousal on its way.

However, though the Abhidharmako§a contains a similar explanation on this point, it does not employ the word \"sideways\" (see DE LA VALLEE POUSSIN, 1988-1 990.11:397): \"Intermediate heavenly beings - those who go towards a heavenly realm of rebirth - go high, like one rising up from a seat. Humans, animals, pretas, and intermediate beings go in the manner in which humans, etc., go.

Simi lar explanations are found in the Vinaya, for example in the Garbhiivakriintisiitra section of the Vinayak�udrakavastu (see, e.g., Yijing's Chinese translation Tl 45 l.253b3•6), but the Tibetan translation of that passage (D6.1 25a) does not employ the expression \"going sideways\" ('phred la 'gro or similar) . Hence, it has still not been possible for me to identify a scriptural source for Ye shes Bia ma's usage of this phrase. 402 'Jewel' (rin chen) is Sgam po pa's monk name, i.e., Bsod nams rin chen, meaning \"jewel of beneficence.\" 403 \"Mahakfrti\" (ma hii ghir ti), i.e., \"someone of great renown.\" The author here uses the Sanskrit expression."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition The Liberation [Story] of the Venerable Uncle and Nephew404 written by Rgyal ba Khyung tshang ba [is finished] . 145 I(hyung tshang ba Ye shes Bla ma's Sgam po pa hagiography agrees on a number of points with the other early accounts. It is one of the first sources to mention the death of Bsod nams rin chen's wife prior to his becoming a monk, an information that was also mentioned in What Should be Known (Shes bya ma) attributed to Rdo rje rgyal po. Nonetheless, many details also differ slightly from the other narratives. One example is Ye shes Bla ma's statement that Bsod nams rin chen returned to study Bka' gdams pa teachings with Dge bshes Lcags ri ba after his seven years of retreat in Se ba valley following his studies with Mi la ras pa. 4. The Ensuing Hagiographical Tradition The texts translated above all belong to the earliest literary period of Sgam po pa hagio­graphies, namely the phase of hagiographical fragments (ca. 1130-1176). The works of this period were written during or shortly after Bsod nams rin chen's life by younger contempo­raries. Although one of the texts, namely the life story by Ye shes Bla ma, uses the word 'hagiography' (rnam thar) in its title, none of the compositions provide complete vita covering all of Bsod nams rin chen's life from his birth till his death. Hence, these works have here been referred to as hagiographical 'fragments'. 4.1 The Phase of Short Complete Hagiographies In the period that followed, complete vitae were composed, giving a full and rounded narrative of Bsod nams rin chen's life. These rnam thar were relatively short and were either written as independent hagiographies or as part of longer series of hagiographies providing whole histories of religious lineages (bka ' brgyud gser 'phreng). The works make up a period which may be called the phase of short complete hagiographies (ca. 1160-1380). A distinctive feature of the texts belonging to this phase is that it is in these work that certain well-known stories of episodes in Bsod nams rin chen's life begin to be formulated and find their place within the larger narrative construct of his life story.405 The phase of short complete hagiographies include five vitae composed by 'Ba' rom pa Dar ma dbang phyug (1127-1 199), Ela ma Zhang Brtson 'grus grags pa (1122-1193), Rgyal thang pa Bde chen rdo rje (12th_ 13th centuries), and two anonymous authors; it also contains 404 \"The Liberation [Story] of the Venerable Uncle and Nephew\" (Rje khu dbon gyi rnam thar). Although the title suggests that the text should include a hagiography of Bsod nams rin chen's nephew Dags po Bsgom tshul, this is not the case, at least not in the extant version of the text. 405 It may be observed that the temporal phases in the emergence of the Sgam po pa hagiographies suggested here and below fundamentally agree with the broad periodization of Mar pa hagiographies presented by DUCHER (2011:31-32)."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"146 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition a eulogy composed by Skyob pa 'Jig rten mgon po (1143-1217).406While the individual texts differ to some extent in their detail, it is a common feature that they generally all nar­rate the vita as consisting of four key periods pertaining to Bsod nams rin chen's life in Tibet from 1079 to 1153. The first key period is an account of Bsod nams rin chen's family background, birth, and life as a young man. It is here told that he was born in 1079 into the Snyi ba family in Se b a valley (se ba lung) in the Dmyal region of southern Tibet amidst various auspicious signs. Around 1090, he married at the age of twelve and had a son and a daughter, but a few years later his wife and children died during an epidemic. At his wife's deathbed, he sought to assuage her anxiety by promising her not to remarry and instead to take up the life of a Buddhist monk. The latter literary feature of providing a stronger emotional background for Bsod nams rin chen's decision to become a monk is a new element in the vitae of this period. In the earlier texts of the period of hagiographical fragments there is either no mention of Bsod nams rin chen having had a wife and children or it is said that he had a wife and children who passed away at a young age, but the story is not dramatized in the manner that it is his wife's anxiety that moves Bsod nams rin chen to promise her to become a monk rather than to remarry. This narrative feature remains stable throughout the entire subsequent hagiographical tradition o f Sgam po pa. The second key period concerns the six years from 1104 till 1110, which Bsod nams rin chen spent as a young Buddhist monk studying and practicing meditation with a number ofreligious teachers (dge ba'i bshes gnyen) of the Bka' gdams tradition. At the age of twenty­five, he renounced a worldly family life and received monastic ordination. Thereupon he studied the teachings of the Indian master Atifa Diparµkarasrijfiana (ca. 982- 1054), cover­ing the main textual curriculum of the Bka' gdams tradition along with the monastic Vinaya code. Bsod nams rin chen is also said to have received a transmission for the Tantric deitypractice of Cakrasamvara ('khor lo bde mchog). His Bka' gdams pa teachers at this time aresaid to have included Dge bshes Sha ba gling pa, Bya 'Dul ba 'dzin pa chen po, Mang yul Blo ldan shes rab, Dge bshes Bya yul ba, Lcags ri gong kha ba, and Snyug rum pa. While practicing meditation in a mountain retreat, he is said to have had several special dreams and experiences, which are stated in the Da§abhumikasutra and other Buddhist scriptures to be signs of having accomplished the ten bodhisattva levels (sa, *bhumi). The latter is a significant feature, which occurs in shorter form in the earlier peri od of hagiographical fragments, but which is here made into a major attribute meant to authenticate Bsod nams rin chen as the saintly reincarnation of an Awakened bodhisattva. The third key period of Bsod nams rin chen's life narrated in the short complete vitae is his encounter with and mentoring by the yogf Mi la ras pa in 1110. A rather detailed story of premonition and auspicious coincidence is told in some of the texts, reporting that Bsod nams rin chen repeatedly dreamt of meeting a white old man, which spontaneously gave rise to intensive feelings of faith and devotion in him. One day while taking a rest from his 406 For an overview and bibliographical details, see the Survey of Bsod nam rin chen Hagio­graphies, pp. 85ff."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 147 meditation retreat, he went out to sit in the sun where he met three poor but quite hilarious beggars, who mentioned the name of Mi la ras pa, the famous Tantric yogl, as an example of someone who is happy even while possessing nothing. When Bsod nams rin chen heard this name, he felt an intensive religious longing and upon having had another auspicious dream, he decided to travel to Mang yul gung thang in southern Tibet to meet the man behind the name. When Bsod nams rin chen finally met Mi la ras pa in person, Mi la ras pa recognized him as a worthy recipient of the Tantric teachings. Bsod nams rin chen initially felt some doubt about this, since Mi la ras pa was a yogf and not a monk, but having overcome his doubts he received Mi la ras pas's empowerments and meditative instructions, particularly the teachings on the yoga of Inner Heat (gtum mo). At this point, the texts go into some detail concerning the various meditative experiences and visions that Bsod nams rin chen had while he trained these yogic instructions for the eleven months he stayed with Mi la ras pa. The fourth key period recounted in the short complete vitae is how Bsod nams rin chen spent the remaining forty-five years of his life from 1111 till his death in 1153 living in solitary meditation retreats in the mountains and gradually attracting a circle of students who came to learn meditation from him. It is told that following his eleven months of train­ing with Mi la ras pa, Bsod nams rin chen returned to the Dmyal region where he spent six years in solitary meditation retreat, followed by another four years of retreat in the secluded mountain valleys of the '01 kha region. Having accomplished his practice, he then settled down on Mount Dags Iha sgam po in the Dags po province of Central Tibet in accordance with a prophecy that he had earlier received from Mi la ras pa. He remained in a simple hermitage on the mountain for the rest of his life, spending his time meditating and teaching students who came to study with him. The vitae account some miraculous feats displayed by Bsod nams rin chen to his disciples, such as crossing a river by walking on water, as also seen in the earlier fragmentary life stories. It is reported that he passed away in the morning of the fifteenth day of the sixth Tibetan month of the bird year amidst many special signs.407 The texts end by providing a list of his major students. Among the many who learned from him,408 his main students are here said to include four heart sons (thugs kyi sras bzhi) named Shor sgom 'Phags pa, Gser sgom Ye shes snying po, Zim Zhing Ye shes byang chub, and Rnal 'byor Chos g.yung, as well as four lineage-holding students (rgyud 'dzin gyi slob ma bzhi), counting Phag mo gru pa, Dus gsum mkhyen pa, 'Ba' rom pa, and Bsod nams rin 407 Bya lo shar ba'i tshe hor zla drug pa'i tshes bco lnga'i snga thun dang po. In the Gregorian calendar, this corresponds to Tuesday July 7, 1153 CE (SCHUH, 1973:*34*, 7. Jahr). The month and day of Bsod nams rin chen's passing given here agrees with the data supplied in Phag mo gru pa's poem Shes bya ma. 408 While the present vitae only mention that Bsod nams rin chen had numerous students, the near-contemporaneous religious historian Nyang ral Nyi ma 'od zer (11 36-1 204) states that Dags po rin po che, i.e., Bsod nams rin chen, taught more than three hundred students who became accomplished meditators. See Chas 'byung me tog snying po sbrang rtsi'i bcud, edited by Chab spel Tshe brtan phun tshogs (Beijing: Bod lj ongs mi dmangs dpe skrun khang, 1988), p. 4936-8·"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"148 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition chen's nephew (dbon po) Bsgom pa Tshul khrims snying po. It may be added that aside from Tshul khrims snying po, these lineage-holding students went on to found hermitages and small monasteries elsewhere in Tibet, which became the basis for the various later sub­schools of the Bka' brgyud tradition. While the early complete hagiographies do not provide much detail on the physical construction and development of the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage, later sources dealingwith the history of the site make clear that during Bsod nams rin chen's life, Dags Iha sgam po was, in fact, merely a yogi community situated directly in the wilderness with access to a few rocky caves rather than an actual hermitage, since no large buildings had yet been constructed on the mountain. A series of small buildings were erected at the site by Bsodnams rin chen's successor, his nephew Tshul khrims snying po (1116-1 169) during theyears he served as the second abbot of the community from 1145 till his death in 1169.409 Later generations added more and bigger buildings to the hermitage, gradually transforming it into a small monastery. The five texts of the phase of short, complete hagiographies thus provide a full narrative of Bsod nams rin chen's life from his birth till his death with several major narrativefeatures having become established, such as the death of his wife, his becoming a monk, his study with Bka' gdams pa teachers, his encounter with the three beggars, and so forth. The individual versions of his life story vary on several points, but their overall narrative isrelatively uniform in comparison to the considerable disagreements found between the earlier texts of the phase of hagiographical fragments. A notable feature is that the tendency to write longer series of hagiographies of thegurus belonging to a given transmission-lineage was continued in this period. Such a construct was already attested in the work by Rgyal ba khyung tshang ba Ye shes Bia ma discussed above. In the ensuing period, the tradition was taken up by another member of the early Dags Iha sgam po community, namely Bla ma Zhang Brtson 'grus grags pa (1122-1193), who produced a new series of Bka' brgyud hagiographies in the form often referred to as the 'Golden Rosary' (bka ' brgyud gser 'phreng).410 Like Ye shes Bla ma's archetype, Bla ma Zhang's text includes the stories of Te lo pa, Na ro pa, Mar pa lotsa ba, Mi la ras pa, and Bsod nams rin chen. Additionally, since Ela ma Zhang was mainly a student of Bsod nams rin chen's nephew and successor, Dags po Bsgom Tshul, his text also includes a hagiography of the latter master. In terms of his Sgam po pa hagiography, the text is more or less a direct reproducti on of the above-translated first 'autobiographical' narrative from Answers to the Questions of Dus gsum mkhyen pa (DK.A.Tha.3). Whether Bia ma Zhang's 409 See Gdan sa chen po dp al dwags Iha sgam po'i ngo mtshar gyi bod pa dad pa'i gter chen (text G) in S0RENSEN & DOLMA (2007:202, folio 23b4_5), where it is told that Bsgom Tshul built a small dormitory hut as well as a little temple (mchod khang) attached to a new stiipa constructed to house the ashes of Bsod nams rin chen after the latter's death in 115 3. 410 See Bia ma zhang brtson 'grus grags pa'i gsung 'bum dang bka' rgya ma 'i skor, vol. ka, pp. 46-83 (folios 19b-38a) (TBRC 13994-3025). The Sgam po pa hagiography is found on pp. 71-77 (folios 32a1-35as)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 149 version of the narrative or the version found in the Answers to the Questions of Dus gsum mkhyen pa is the original source for the parallels is an unsettled question, but the parallel itself is significant in that it provides one of the earliest attestations for the existence of a segment of the Dags po'i Bka' 'bum corpus already in the second half of the twelfth century. Another important facet of Bla ma Zhang's text is that it -like the eulogies by Rdo rje rgyal po -also briefly refers to the stories of Supu�pacandra and Candraprabha Kumara from the Samadhiriijasutra as being predictions of Bsod nams rin chen and his activities in Tibet. Moreover, Ela ma Zhang's work also refers to the Mahakarw:1apu1Jrjarfka Sutra as containing a scriptural prophesy of Sgam po pa, which makes his text one of the earliest sources to refer to this scripture in connection with Bsod nams rin chen. A slightly later work is a eulogy composed by Skyob pa 'Jig rten gsum mgon Rin chen dpal ( 1143-1217), who was a student of Phag mo gru pa Rdo rje rgyal po. The poem does not refer to any historical aspects of Bsod nams rin chen's life, but it too mentions his association with the bodhisattva Candraprabha Kumara from the Samiidhiriijasutra and is therefore another relatively early source attesting the community's view on this scriptural prophecy. 4.2 The Phase of Extensive Hagiographies In the second half of the fourteenth century, the hagiographical tradition on Sgam po pa became unified into a single narrative stream, when the second Zhwa dmar pa Mkha' spyod pa dri med dpal ye shes (or, in short, Mkha' spyod dbang po, 1350-1405) wrote the hitherto largest Sgam po pa hagiography in 57 folios.411 Mkha' spyod dbang po's text, which later became known simply as \"the large hagiography\" (rnam thar chen mo), transformed the narrative construct of Bsod nams rin chen into a much more extensive religious tale covering several former lives as bodhisattvas, whose spiritual career culminated in his rein­carnation in Tibet as Bsod nams rin chen. In particular, these were the life stories of the bodhisattvas Supu�pacandra and Candraprabha Kumara known from the Samiidhiriijasiltra, to which Phag mo gru pa had already made brief references in his eulogies written in the phase of hagiographical fragments. In fact, Mkha' spyod dbang po begins his Sgam po pa vita by paraphrasing the entire thirty-sixth chapter of the Sutra containing the story of Supu�pacandra. His hagiography incorporates many diverse materials from the earlier hagiographical literature, thereby attempting to bring the divergent versions into a single unified account. For this reason, his text quickly became the archetype for all subsequent Sgam po pa hagiographies. The large hagiography gives Bsod nams rin chen's vita in nine main episodes: (I) his former lives as the bodhisattvas Supu�pacandra and Candraprabha Kumara (folios 268b-232a I pp. 320-327); (II) his childhood and youth in Tibet (folio 232a I p. 327); (III) his monastic ordination followed by his studies and practice with Bka' gdams teachers (folios 41 1 For bibliographical details, see the survey of Sgam po pa hagiographies, pp. 85ff."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"150 Chapter 3: The Hagiographical Tradition 232a-234b I pp. 327-332);412 (IV) his fervent wish to meet Mi la ras pa after havingencountered three beggars (folios 234b-236b I pp. 332-336); (V) his meeting and study withMi la ras pa (folios 236b-252b I pp. 336-370 followed by missing folios); (VI) solitary meditation in the wilderness and his meditative experiences (folios 256a-260b I pp. 377-386); (VU) arrival at Dags lha sgam po and the gathering of students, including miracle stories and songs of realization (folios 260b-274b I pp. 386-415); (VIII) death and crema­tion, and ensuing developments at the hermitage headed by Dags po Bsgom tshul (folios 274b-279b/ pp. 415-425); (IX) mention of various Sutra prophecies considered pertinent toBsod nams rin chen (folios 279b-282b I pp. 425-432) followed by the hagiography'scolophon (folios 282b-283a I pp. 432-433).413 Some materials from Mkha' spyod dbang po's \"Large Hagiography\" were subsequently picked up in a smaller hagiography simply entitled \"Hagiography of Master Sgam po pa\" by an anonymous author. Yet, the work that strongly promulgated the larger narrative created by Mkha' spyod dbang po was a reworking of the text (in 62 folios) made in 1520 by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub (1488-1 552), the sixteenth abbot of Dags Iha sgam po monastery.414 Sgam poBsod nams lhun grub's text bears the long title: \"The Best of Jewel Ornaments of Liberation Adorning the Banner of Pervasive Renown: A Precious Wish-fulfilling Jewel in the Form of a Hagiography of the Dharma-Master, the Eminent and Great Sgam po pa\" (Chas kyi rj e dp al ldan sgam po pa chen po'i rnam par thar pa yid bzhin gyi nor bu rin po che kun khyab snyan pa'i ba dan thar pa rin po che'i rgyan gyi mchog). The title's mention of a jewel ornament that sits atop \"the banner of pervasive renown\" (kun khyab snyan pa 'i ba dan) isclearly a reference to the title of Mkha' spyod dbang po's Large Hagiography, the title ofwhich is \"Banner of Pervasive Renown.\" The analogy actually characterizes Sgam po Bsodnams lhun grub's composition very aptly, for it is really a complete reproduction of Mkha'spyod dbang po's text with many sentences having been slightly expanded with addedexpressions, quotations, an d explanatory remarks throughout the narrative. The colophon of the text states that it was compiled in 1520 at Mt. Santi, i.e., Dags lhasgam po. It was included in the first xylographic print of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum415 produ­ced by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub in the same year, and it is therefore evident that thehagiography was produced especially for this occasion. Given that the text was proliferatedin printed form through the publication of the 1520 xylograph, its centrality to the later412 This episode includes the interlocuted questions and answers from Sbrang ston and Dge bshes Gre pa attested in the first 'autobiographical' passage. 413 The folio and page references are to the 1978 publication of the incomplete Rumtek manuscript (TBRC W23928-3568).

The text's colophon mentions the sources that Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub relied on for writing his text: I wrote down these [stories] purely with an attitude of faith by compiling and combining the three longer and shorter hagiographies narrated by the master him­self put together by his four Dharma assistants, his precious valet and others, and then written down by [Dags po] 'Dul 'dzin, as well as [the text] known as Th e Large Hagiography written by the master Mkha' spyod dbang po having added scriptural quotations from the precious siltras.416 The first part of the colophon is actually lifted verbatim from Mkha' spyod dbang po's hagiography, meaning that it was the latter author who consulted the three hagiographies narrated by the master himself and thereupon written down by Dags po 'Dul 'dzin. It seems that these three hagiographies refer to the three passages in the Answers to th e Questions of Dus gsum mkhyen pa referred to above as \"the first 'autobiographical' narrative\", \"a brief account of Bsod nams rin chen's death\", and \"the second 'autobiographical' narrative,\" since these are the only narratives written in the first-person voice. If that is the case, the colophon supplies the valuable information that the 'autobiographical' narratives first received their final form in writing by the hand of Dags po 'Dul 'dzin ( 1134-1218), who was the fourth abbot of Dags Iha sgam po. The statement clarifies that after Bsod nams rin chen had spoken these accounts417 there was a compilation process, in which the stories were gathered, perhaps in the form of various notes. The persons who took part in this process were Bsod nams rin chen's four Dharma assistants (nye gnas chos bzhi), his precious valet (bran kha rin po che), and others. It is uncertain precisely which students are to be included under these titles, but several disciples are known in the colophons of texts in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum by the epithet 'assistant' or 'attendant' (nye gnas, *anteviisin or *antevasika),418 such as Nye gnas Sho sgom Byang chub ye shes, Ny e gnas Sgom pa Legs mdzes, and Nye gnas Shes rab gzhon nu.

It thus appears that the author has drawn to a considerable extent on his own spiritual interests -himself being a renowned meditative recluse and retreatant (mtshams pa) of the nineteenth-century Karma km?i tshang tradition -to produce a novel version of the Sgam po pa hagiography that is more centered on meditation and inner guidance than on outer events. The text includes segments on the scriptural Sutra prophecies regarding Bsod nams rin chen (folios lb-Sa); his childhood and early years as a bka ' gdams monk (8a- l la); the yogic training he received during the eleven months he spent with Mi Ia ras pa (11 a-41 a); the years he spent in solitary practice retreat in the wilderness ( 41 a-48b ); the qualities, activities and miracles he displayed for the benefit of his students, along with rather detailed explanations on the different types of instructions that he gave (48b-64b); his answers to various questions and how he guided his students ( 64b-72b); his students and their activities (72b-75a) ; and an epilogue concerning the nature of the hagiography and the benefits that practitioners may derive from reading such texts (75a-79a) .427 The stories of Sgam po pa's life presented here have revealed a formative process. The simple and at times somewhat conflicting narrative elements of the earliest fragmentary life stories gradually became unified into a larger, more fixed religious vita that shaped the traditional view of Bsod nams rin chen and his significance for the Bka' brgyud lineages. This standard version of the story was cemented by Mkha' spyod dbang po's Large Hagiography composed in the second half of the fourteenth century at a time when the Bka' brgyud schools were going through a period of increased political an d cultural influence in Tibet and China. By including the Large Hagiography into the first printed edition of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus in the reworked, embellished adaptation of the vita by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub in 1520, the hagiographical stream was fused with the textual transmission of teachings from the Dags Iha sgam po community. From this point on in time, the life and teachings of Bsod nams rin chen were embedded in a single transmission, in which the hagiography informed the reading of the teaching texts and vice versa. This is the traditional hermeneutical framework from within which the teachings of Sgam po pa have been read and promulgated in the Tibetan speaking world since the sixteenth century. With a clearer understanding of the Tibetan narrative construct of Sgam po pa as a religious founder in hand, the next part of the book will lead the reader into a larger study of the Manifold Sayings of Dags po, being the collection of teachings associated with Bsod nams rin chen's authorship. 427 The folio numbers are to the xylograph version of the text (NGMPP microfilm reel no.

Doctrinal Background: Monastic Cul ture - Tantric Subculture To place Bsod nams rin chen's manifold teachings in their proper context, it is helpful first to view them from the broader perspective of the traditions of monasticism and Tantrism practiced in Tibet during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. For, just as the hagiographies portray Bsod nams rin chen as having gone back and forth between the monastic establish­ment of the Bka' gdams pa order and the Tantric tradition of the yogi counter-culture, his extant teachings also form a medley of elements from both traditions. After Buddhism in Tibet had gone through a period of decline in the late ninth and early tenth centuries, a new influx of Indian Buddhism began towards the end of the tenth century. The revival culminated during the eleventh century in the form of cooperation between numerous Indian teachers and Tibetan translators. The Tibetans were very fascina­ted with the Anuttarayogatantras, which were in vogue among Indian Buddhists at the time,and the Tibetans therefore emphasized the Tantric teachings of these texts. There seem to have been two reasons for this. First, Tibetan translators had already translated the main Indian corpus of Buddhist Mahayana Siitras during the eighth and ninth centuries, an d consequently the translators of the tenth and eleventh centuries were seeking new materi als to translate and transmit to Tibet, which they especially found in the litera­ture of the Anuttarayogatantras. Secondly, the Tantric subculture of the Anuttarayoga­tantras had in the meantime entered a process of becoming integrated into mainstream Indian Buddhism, and the teachings of the Tantras were accordingly practiced and ex­pounded by the majority of the Indian masters whom the Tibetans encountered. One of the most influential figures in this Tibetan epoch was the Indian master AtifaDiparpkarasr1jfiana (ca. 982- 1054 ), who came to Tibet in 1042 and stayed there till hisdeath in 1054. Atifa exerted a major influence through his edifying activity , which was his attempt at bridging some of the internal contradictions within Indian Buddhism. At the time, North Indian Buddhism had developed two major trends that were difficult to reconcile. On the one hand, there was the tradition of Common Mahayana Buddhism, which was deeply anchored in the monastic culture. On the other hand, a new movement of Tantrism had emerged from the sixth and seventh centuries onwards, which had gradually become an increasingly dominant element in Indian Buddhism, given that the meditation techniques of the Tantras promised quick spiritual Awakening."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmi�ion 157 The Mahayana Siitras had already begun to emerge in the first century CE at a time when Indian Buddhism was becoming institutionalized with a monastic establishment. In most of these scriptures, spiritual realization was taught to be very distant for the ordinary practitioner, because the attainment of Awakening was said to require three immeasurable aeons, which is an almost endless period.428 The high and noble but somewhat pessimistic ideal of the Si\"itras was challenged in the sixth-seventh centuries, when India experienced a sort of spiritual optimism with the emergence of the Tantras, some of which promised Awakening to be attainable even within a single lifetime. The higher Tantras, however, do not seem to have arisen within the monastic establishment but were rather texts belonging to certain lay and yogi communities that formed an extrinsic subculture. Thus, the Tantras did not replace the Mahayana Siitras and commentaries, but the two trends continued to develop side by side. Eventually, the Tantric subculture began to be absorbed into the monastic establishment, probably beginning with the less controversial, more rituali stic forms of Tantra. Thus, when the first wave of Buddhism was introduced into Tibet during the seventh to ninth centuries, a great number of Tantras were taught in Tibet, but it seems that the Tantric prac titioners were laymen living in hermitages apart from the monks.429 During the tenth and eleventh centuries, however, even the most controversial forms of Tantra, such as the Anuttarayogatantras, began to become part of the monastic life, as is attested by the archaeological evidence of numerous Tantric images found at monastic sites during this period, e.g., at the grand monastery Nalanda in Bihar. This integration was not unproble­matic. As many of the Tantras involved sexual techniques, they were fundamentally at odds with the chaste life of the monks. The Tibetans imported both types of Indian Buddhism, but often felt a need to empha­size one type above the other. A number of Tibetan lay translators, such as 'Brog mi and Mar pa, focused solely on the Tantras, whereas a few ordained translators, e.g., Rin chen bzan g po (958-1 055), tried to combine the two. When the Indian monk Ati:Sa came to Tibet in the middle of the eleventh century, he initiated a shift in emphasis that came to have a strong bearing on subsequent Tibetan Buddhism. Ati:Sa propagated monkhood to be the proper basis for Buddhism, the Mahayana bodhi­sattva ideal to be its core, and the practice of the Tantras to be just one possible method among many others. The movement initiated by Ati:Sa became known as the Bka' gdams pa tradition. Since it consisted mainly of monks, it quickly established itself in institutional form with a number of key monasteries, such as Rwa sgreng dgon pa and Snar thang dgon pa. The other Tibetan traditions gradually adopted similar organizational structures and Tibetan Buddhism thus became institutionalized. SNELLGROVE (1987:493) has character­ized this process as follows: 428 For details from the fourth-century Yo gaciirabhiimi, see KRAGH (2013a:93 fn. 206 and p. 208). 429 The situation must have been similar in India at the time; cf., e.g., the many prohibitions against monks practicing Ta ntra given in Indian Tantric treatises of this period quoted by Ati§a (D3948.289a4ff. )."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"158 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission Thus it would seem that Atlfa and [his student] 'Brom-ston in founding the bKa'­gdams-pa Order were in effect the founders of the whole later Tibetan monastic tradition. Not only the Sa-skya-pa and the bKa'-brgyud-pa Orders, but also the Rnying-ma-pas and the Bon-pos inevitably followed suit, when from the fourteenth century onward they too began to establish some celibate religious communities. As for the dGe-lugs-pas, they quite consciously modeled their new communities [in the fifteenth century] on those of the earlier bKa'-gdams-pas , thus claiming to restore a purer monastic way of life, which from their point of view had become muddied by the literal interpretation and the actual practice of many of the Tantric rituals imported from India. Atifa was a grand master of the Common Mahayana and -in spite of being a monk -he was also very well-versed in the Tantras.430 In 1042, he traveled from India to Tibet by invitation of the Tibetan royal monk Byang chub 'od (11th century), who belonged to the ruling family of Gu ge in Western Tibet. Atifa spent the next thirteen years in Tibet until his death in Central Tibet in 1054. The basis for Atifa's teachings is epitomized in his treatise \"A Beacon for the Path to Awakening\" (Bodhipathaprad!pa).431 He wrote this work at Mtho gling monastery in Gu g e shortly after arriving in Tibet at the request of Byang chub 'od in order to counter what the latter considered improper Tantric practices and instead to elucidate the proper Mahayana path.432 The treatise is devoted to explaining the stages of Buddhist practice (lam rim), laying a strong emphasis on monkhood and the gradual teachings of the Common Maha­yana. In particular, it stresses the Mahayana contemplative practices of tranquility (§ama­tha, zhi gnas) and insight (vipa§yana, lhag mthong) meditation in accordance with the philosophical doctrine of the Indian Madhyamaka tradition. In the final verses of the text, Atifa laid down his view on Tantric practice: The Secret and Insight-[Knowledge] Empowerments Should not be taken by religious celibates, Because that is emphatically forbidden In The Great Ta ntra of the Primal Buddha. If those empowerments were taken by someone living In the austerity of celibacy, It would violate his vow of austerity, Because he would have performed something forbidden. 43° For a detailed analysis of Atifa and his life, see EIMER (1979). 431 Tibetan title Byang chub lam gyi sgron me (Q5343/D3947).

Those who have received the Master empowerment And those who see reality incur no fault In hearing and explaining all the Ta ntras, Making fire-rituals, offerings, and so forth.433 159 The expression \"religious celibate\" (tshangs par spyod pa, *brahmaciirin) refers to monks and nuns. The Secret Empowerment (gsang ba 'i dbang, *guhyiibhi:jeka) and the Insight­Knowledge Empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang, '1-prajfiiijfiiinabhi:jeka) are the second and third empowerments of the Anuttarayogatantras and are in the Tantric deity­practice associated with the meditations of the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim, *sm,npanna­krama). Thus, Atifa was very explicit in saying that Buddhist monks and nuns are prohibited from taking the second and third empowerments and -in extension thereof -to engage in their associated yogas, because these rituals involve practices that violate the monastic vow of chastity. The yogas to which Atifa hints are the practices involving a so-called \"knowledge seal\" (jfianamudrii), i.e., an imaginary female partner for sexual practices performed in conjunction with the Secret Empowerment, and a so-called \"action seal \" (karmamudrii), i.e., a real female partner for sexual practices associated with the Insight­Knowledge Empowerment. Since these meditations of the Anuttarayogatantras aim at approaching spiritual Awakening through the experience of the arousal and bliss of sexual intercourse and orgasm, Atifa considered them completely unsuitable for monks and nuns who have vowed to remain celibate. The last verse of the quoted passage explains which Tantric practices certain qualified monks and nuns are permitted to perform. It is stated that celibates are allowed to study and teach all the Tantras, and are also allowed to perform fire-rituals, make offerings, and the like. For men and women of the cloth, Atifa thus limited Tantric practice to intellectual study and the performance of some of its purely ritual parts. Atifa, moreover, prescribed that an ordained individual who aspires to engage in these limited Tantric practices must possess two qualifications. The first qualification is that the monk or nun should have received the \"Master Empowerment,\" i.e., the so-called Vajra 433 The present translation is partly based on SHERBURNE's English translation (1983:12). For another translation, see EIMER (1978:138-139).

In the initiatory system of the Anuttarayogatantras, this empowerment constitutes the final stage of theVase Empowerment (bum pa'i dbang, *kalasabhi�eka). The Vase Empowerment is the first of the four overall empowerments of the Anuttarayogatantras and it precedes the Secret Empowerment and the Insight-Knowledge Empowerment.434 In other words, the first qualification is that the monk or nun must have received the complete Vase Empowerment up to and including its final step called the Vajra Master Empowerment. As pointed out in the auto-commentary to this verse of Atifa's text,435 this prescription means that the monkmay receive the Vase Empowerment and practice the above-mentioned outer rituals, which only pertain to the Generation Stage (bskyed rim, *utpattikrama) of Tantric deity practice, but the ordained practitioner must avoid receiving and practicing the controversial second and third empowerments belonging to the Completion Stage of the practice. The second qualification that a monk or nun ought to possess in order to engage in the above-mentioned ritual aspects of Tantric practice is that he or she sees or knows reality (de nyid rig, *tattvavid). According to the auto-commentary,436 this phrase means that he or she,as a minimum, must have achieved a firsthand meditative experience of emptiness, which in the Buddhist structure of the path is said to occur on the third stage called \"Endurance\" (bzad pa, k�anti) of the Path of Integration (sbyor lam, prayogamarga). In other words, ifthe monk or nun has achieved an advanced stage of meditation practice by relying on the techniques of Tranquility and Insight as taught in the Common Mahayana, no fault will beincurred if s/he performs the ritual aspects of the Generation Stage of Tantric practice. There is, however, a slight unclarity in the Tibetan version437 of the final verse quotedabove, because -with a bit of stretched interpretation -the Tibetan text also could be readin the following manner: In hearing and explaining all the Ta ntras, Making fire-rituals, offerings, and so forth, Those who have received the Master empowerment [incur no fault], While those who see reality incur no fault [whatsoever ].438 434 The four overall empowerments are generally enumerated as the Vase Empowerment (bum pa'i dbang, kalasiibhi�eka), the Secret Empowerment (gsang ba 'i dbang, guhyabhi�eka), the Insight­Knowledge Empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang, praj iiajiiiinabhi�eka), and the Word Empo­werment (tshig gi dbang, ak�arabhiseka). 435 See SHERBURNE (1983: 177-1 79). The auto-commentary, entitled *Bodhimargapradlpapaiijikii (Byang chub lam gyi sgron me'i dka' 'grel, Q5344/D3948), may or may not be an authentic work by Atifa (EIMER, 1978:46, fn. 2), but is in any case a very early commentary. In favor of the text being an authentic work by Atifa, it may be noted that the text speaks of Atifa's guru Bhik�u *Pain�apatika of Java (Dge slang Bsod snyoms pa Ya ba dwi pa) as \"my teacher\" (bdag gi bla ma), using the first­person pronoun; see D3948.289b1 -2. 436 See SHERBURNE (ibid.). 437 The original Sanskrit versions of the text and the auto-commentary are not extant."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmi'),Sion 161 Hence, from the Tibetan version of the verse, it is not entirely clear whether someone who has experienced emptiness would incur a fault even in the case that he or she were to engage in the higher Tantric practices of the second and third empowerments, or whether such an advanced practitioner would still remain limited to perform only the practices of the first empowerment. The auto-commentary does not clarify this point and is therefore of little help in this regard. Since the argument used here might suggest that someone who has experienced emptiness never incurs faults in any case, it seems to follow that such an advanced individual may be allowed to perform any Tantric practice, if he or she should wish to do so. The manner in which ordained monks and nuns may or may not be permitted to engage in higher Tantric practices of sexual nature remains to this day a grey area, which has not been researched in detail by modem scholarship. In any case, for the common practitioner Atifa's prohibition must have set a forceful limitation to more advanced Tantric practices. This, in turn, put the Bka' gdams pas in square opposition to the lay Tiintrikas of the other schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the teachers Mar pa, Mi la ras pa, and Ras chung pa of the Bka' brgyud tradition. While it still remains uncertain how and to which extent the Bka' gdams pas truly followed Atifa's rule on the ground, there can be no doubt that Bka' gdams pa monks maintained certain restrictions on Tantric practice. The fifteenth-century religious history, The Blue Annals, illustrated this point with the following narrative derived from the later Sgam po pa hagiographical tradition, telling a story about an exchange that the monk Bsod nams rin chen is supposed to have had with his non-monastic teacher, the yogfMi la ras pa, when they first met in 1109: [Bsod nams rin chen] requested: \"Please, give me the profound instructions\", [to which Mi la ras pa] responded, \"Have you received empowerment?\" [Bsod nams rin chen] answered: \"I have received many empowerments, such as the Six Jewel Ornaments (rin chen rgyan drug), Cakrasamvara, and others, from Mar yul Blo ldan [shes rab] . I have also listened to many expositions of the Bka' gdams instructions in Central Tibet in the north. And I have stayed in samadhi for thirteen consecutive days.\" [Mi la ras pa] emitted a loud laugh \"Ha, ha!\" and said: \"The samadhi of the gods of the form and formless realms, who are able to meditate throughout an entire aeon, is better than your samadhi, but it is of no benefit to 438 A somewhat similar interpretation is given by SHERBURNE (2000: 19), although his translation incorrectly suggests taking the present tense finite verb myed 'gyur as a gerund meaning \"having acquired\", namely: \"Having acquired the Preceptor-Initiation, he may listen to all tantras and explain them; perform fire-offering, gift-worship, and the like: there is no wrong in wisdom about reality.\" E!MER's (1978: 139) translation, which outright ignores that the Tibetan phrase de nyid ( *tattva) follows after the coordinating verbal conjunction zhing, differs slightly therefrom but amounts to the same meaning: \"Wenn einer, der alle Tantras studiert und predigt, Feueropfer [und] Opferdarbring­ungen und ahnliches vollzieht, die \"Lehrer\"-Weihe erhalt, so ist eben dies passend, und es liegt kein Pehler darin.\" English Translation: \"If someone, who studies and preaches all the Ta ntras, performs fire-rituals, makes offerings, and the like, obtains the 'teacher'-initiation, then that is suitable just so and there is no error therein.\""},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"162 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission Awakening. It is similar to sand that will never become oil when pounded. The Bka' gdams pas have explanations (gdams ngag, *avaviida) but they have no instructions (man ngag, *upadefa). Since a demon penetrated the heart of Tibet, Atifa was not allowed to explain the secret Mantrayiina. If he would have been allowed to do so, Tibet would by now have been filled with siddhas ! The Bka' gdams pa's Generation Stage consists only of lone male deities and their Comple­tion Stage is merely a dissolving of the world and its inhabitants into radiance. Now you should meditate on my Inner Heat of the A-stroke (gtum mo a th ung). \"439 This is generally how Tibetan texts of later centuries, probably somewhat anachronistically, viewed the supposed twelfth-century tension between Bka' gdams pa monks and lay yogfs , as here exemplified in the meeting between Bsod nams rin chen and Mi la ras pa.440 The struggle to reconcile Tantra with the Common Mahayana in general and with monasticism in particular was widespread in the period leading up to Bsod nams rin chen, and Atifa's restrictive approach was by no means the only opinion on this crucial matter. For example, Mi la ras pa's teacher Mar pa had during his sojourn in India studied with the learned lay master Maitripa, whose synthetic approach differed substantially from that of the monk AtiSa. Maitripa had attempted a synthesis by explaining Tantric concepts through the terminology of Common Mahayana philosophy as well as by laying more emphasis on the non-ritualistic, non-sexual aspects of the Tantras. Yet, he never emphasized monkhoodas a precondition for all Buddhist practice. This could be due to the fact that Maitripa belonged to the Tantrika subculture and not to the monastic establishment, from which he had possibly been expelled during his youth on the grounds of having performed Tantric sexual practices while living as a monk.441 In contrast to Maitripa, Atifa belonged to the monastic culture and was a staunch defender of its virtues. Consequently, during his stay in Tibet Atifa stressed monkhood and the Common Mahayana teachings and prohibited monks from practicing the central elements of the Anuttarayogatantras. It is therefore notsurprising that the synthesis of Tantra and Common Mahayana propagated in Tibet by Atif a represented the way in which Tantra was viewed from within the Indian monastic establishment rather than how it was seen from the point of view of the Tantric subculture that continued to exist outside the monasteries in India as well as in Tibet. Atifa's combina­tion of Mahayana and Tantra was therefore a shift in emphasis for the Tibetans but also a limitation. In fact, Atifa had deadlocked Tantric practice for the monastics. 439 Th e Blue Annals (CHANDRA, 1974:396-397; ROERICH, 1949:455-456). The English translation is loosely based on ROERICH's translation but has been modified in some aspects. 440 As remarked above, such tension is, however, not found expressed in all the earliest hagiographical fragments dealing with Bsod nams rin chen's life. A case in point is the first 'auto­biographical' narrative, which speaks of Mi la ras pa as warmly approving Bsod nams rin chen's former meditative practice based in the Bka' gdams tradition. 441 According to the later Tibetan tradition he was expelled, but according to the Nepalese tradition he gave up the monastic life voluntarily after having had a vision of Avalokitesvara (see TATZ, 1987:700-701)."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmis.JiiOn 163 Although Bsod nams rin chen was a Bka' gdams pa monk, he chose to break away from such monastic attitudes by going to study under the non-monastic yogf Mi la ras pa and subsequently by teaching Tantric instructions alongside Bka' gdams pa teachings combined with his own unique Mahiimudra doctrine. Moreover, Bsod nams rin chen was not the only Bka ' gdams pa monk to pick such a path. There were other monks who went to study under yo gf teachers, for example, S gam po pa's biographer Rgyal ba Khyung ts hang ba Ye shes Bla ma, who studied with Mi la ras pa's student Ras chung pa. It is said that Ye shes Bla ma -on the advice of his teacher -kept his training with Ras chung pa secret until Ras chung pa had passed away, since it was bound to be frowned upon for a yogfto have given Tantric teachings to a monk.442 Moreover, the majority of Bsod nams rin chen's students were them­selves Bka' gdams pa monks, who perhap s came to Bsod nams rin chen seeking the oppor­tunity to learn Tantric meditation and yoga from a fellow monk, a situation that probably illustrates one of the reasons behind Bsod nams rin chen's great renown at the time. Bsod nams rin chen was personally confronted with these contrasts between the Common Mahayana of the monastic establishment and the sexually-related techniques of the Tantrika subculture, but once he started teaching his own students, he introduced a novelty that made a synthesis of these t wo streams possible. Bsod nams rin chen was clear­ly an insider of the monastic Bka' gdams pa movement. After having become a Bka' gdams pa monk, he spent the first five years of his religious career studying and practicing Bka' gdams pa doctrines with some of the most well-known Bka' gdams pa teachers of his day. He is said to have had success in his practice and to have accomplished the meditations he learned, but still -at the age of thirty -he decided to go to learn from one of the most famous Tibetan Tantrikas of his day, the yogfMi la ras pa. In doing so, Bsod nams rin chen chose not to abandon his monastic ordination but to remain a monk. His vita may thus be seen as an unusual attempt at bridging the lifestyle of a monk with that of a Tantrika. When Bsod nams rin chen met his new teacher, Mi la ras pa almost immediately made him practice the Tantric yogas of the second and third empowerment, particularly the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo), which is one of the yogas associated with the Secret Empowerment. It was during the years of solitary meditation after having ended his training with Mi la ras pa that Bsod nams rin chen seems to have developed a unique style of practicing the yoga of Inner Heat in combination with the meditation of Mahiimudra. Once he settled down on Mt. Sgam po in the Dags po region, he attracted a large number of students who were searching for this sort of synthesized approach and his hermitage thereby gradually developed into the first Bka' brgyud monastery. Several of his students went on to found new monasteries and Bka' brgyud subsects of their own.443 In the process thereof, the Tiintrika tradition of Mi la ras pa became institutionalized as a monastic tradition under Bsod nams rin chen, and the group of Bka' gdams pa monks who followed Bsod nams rin chen adopted his new style of teaching, which made wider use of Tantric practices than seems to have been the case with the original Bka' gdams pa tradition 442 See ROBERTS (2007:3, 9). 443 See Th e Blue Annals (CHANDRA, 1974:402-633; ROERICH, 1949:462-725)."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"164 initiated by Atifa. The outcome was a new school, the Bka' brgyud tradition, as Bsod rin chen's tradition later came to be called, whose teachings offered a union of Tantrism Common Mahayana. A certain pattern emerges in Bsod nams rin chen's teachings from the various \"1r•tt°K· texts in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum that contain his oral sayings. As a foundation, he gave Common Mahayana teachings that he had learned from his Bka' gdams pa masters, such as explanations on impermanence, actions and their results, the suffering of sar(lsara, and the Resolve for Awakening (bodhicitta). These teachings are, for example, epitomized in his Jewel Ornament of Liberation.444 Further, he combined this foundation with instructions given directly without Tantric empowerment and Tantric practices. An example of such an amalgam of foundational and Mahii.mudra teachings is the Teaching to the Gathering texts (tshogs chos), which will be summarized below. Notably, he did notreserve Mahamudra only for those who had reached the most advanced stage of Tantricpractice, which is how Mahii.mudra normally is taught in the Tantric scheme of teachings,but rather he seems to have taught it openly to all his students. Since his students did not approach the experience of Mahamudra through the Tantric sexual techniques taught in the Tantras, he instead taught them to gain an experience of Mahamudra by meditating on the teacher and praying for his blessing, viz. the practice called guru yoga (bla ma'i rnal 'byor). In the Tantras, such devotional meditation on the teacher is usually considered an auxiliary practice. It does not involve any sexual element and may in the form taught by Sgam po pa simply be considered as pertaining mainly to the Generation Stage of Tantric practice permitted by Atifa. In such manner, Bsod nams rin chen enabled his followers to practice the essence of the Tantras, i.e., Mahamudra, without having to engage in the Tantric sexual techniques that had been prohibited by AtiSa. Yet, to a small selection of close students, Bsod nams rin chen also imparted the full Tantric teachings, including the various yogas associated with the second and third empowerments that he had learned from Mi la ras pa, and some of which, especially the gtum mo meditation, constituted the core of his own meditational practice. Perhap s these were students whom he considered already to have achieved an advanced stage of meditation and who accordingly were perhaps permitted to practice all levels of Tantra according to Atisa's Bodhipathapradfpa as discussed above. Bsod nams rin chen's Mahii.mudra approach offered a way to practice Tantra while bypassing the more controversial sexual parts of its practice. Hence, it seems that he managed to comply with Atifa's view while at the same time managing to break the deadlock on Tantric practice for monks and nuns that Atifa's prohibition had effected.445 444 Concerning the problems of the authorship of this text, see KRAGH (2013c:388-391). 445 It should, however, be noted that Bsod nams rin chen never directly mentions or discusses Atifa's prohibition for monastics to engage in Tantric practice in his sayings preserved in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum. The passages in the corpus that come closest to discussing issues related to these problems are segments concerned with analyzing the hierarchy between the three sets of vows (sdom gsum). These passages have been translated and studied by SOBISCH (2002: 177-216)."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission 165 His MahiiJnudra doctrine thereby unraveled the division between the Common Mahayana and Tantra, offering an alternative for anyone wanting to practice Buddhism on the basis of both systems. Consequently, his contemplative system became a capstone for the meditation al structure of the Bka' brgyud traditions, since it allowed practitioners to inte­grate Tantrism into the monastic life, given that the ensuing Bka' brgyud schools developed primaril y as monastic traditions. Later Bka' brgyud writers on Mahiimudrii developed the doctrine further in a number of ways, either trying to incorporate other elements from Tantrism or from the Common Mahiiyiina. For example, a major later development was to integrate the Common Mahii­yiina teachings on tranquility (§amatha) and insight meditation (vipasyanii) as a preliminary step to be accomplished before entering into the actual Mahiimudra practice, as it is, e.g., seen in the Mahamudra works by Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal (1513-1587), Kun mkhyen Padma dkar po (1527-1592), and the ninth Karma pa Dbang phyug rdo rje (1556-1603). Although the explanations on samatha and vipasyanii given in such works of the sixteenth century seem to be almost a key feature of Tibetan Mahamudra teachings as the living tradition is known today, it is notable that these constitute later developments. There is hardly any mention of Samatha and vipasyanii in the Mahamudra teachings orally ascribed to Bsod nams rin chen. Accordingly, it is necessary to delve into the actual contents of the Dags po'i bka' 'b um, the Manifo ld Sayings of Dags po, to understand Bsod nams rin chen's teachings on their own terms and from within their own textual framework. 2. Transmission: Compilation and Printing of The Dags po 'i bka' 'bum For reading the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum, it is first necessary to gain a clear overview of the different recensions and editions in which the text corpus exists, so that the reading may be based on the best available edition and with proper understanding of the historical point in time and geographical place where the edition was made. For this reason, the remainder of the present chapter will provide a thorough overview of the various editions of the Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum. The corpus of Bsod nams rin chen's teachings are found in a Tibetan collection often referred to in the primary literature as the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um (sometimes also spelled Dags po bka ' 'b um or Dwags po'i bka' 'bum), which shall here be translated as The Manifold Sayings of Dags po. The meaning of the word Dags po in the title is twofold. On the one hand, Dags po may be understood as a toponym referring to Dags lha sgam po monastery. On the other hand, Dags po may be taken as the epithet of a person referring to \"the precious one from Dags po\" (Dags po rin po che), i.e., Bsod nams rin chen. The dual meanings of the title are actually very suitable, because the nature of the textual corpus is such that it contains numerous materials that are not directly relatable to Bsod nams rin chen but that in various ways are connected with the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage and the early Bka' brgyud traditions that originated from that place. Yet, the corpus also contains a large number of texts that are said to preserve teachings or sayings given orally by Bsod nams rin chen and then put into writing by his followers belonging to the first generation of"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"166 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission his students or occasionally by followers who belonged to the second, third, or even fourth generation of later Bka' brgyud Buddhists. Finally, the corpus contains a couple of texts that might be regarded as having been authored in writing directly by Bsod nams rin chen himself.446 The issue of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum's complex authorships is closely tied to the question of the early compilation history of the corpus, which is a highly intricate matter that shall not be covered in detail in the present book but which is hoped to be the topic of a future publication. The starting point for understanding the pertinent textual history is the recognition that the corpus today exists in two very different recensions. Firstly, an older recension is preserved in the form of a codex unicus, a single unique manuscript, which I refer to as the Lha dbang dp al 'byor manuscript (siglum DK.a, i.e., \"DK alpha\").447 The codex is a handwritten so-called 'golden manuscript' written with white ink (possibly containing silver) on black paper. Secondly, a younger, more recent recension is found in a series of xylo­graphic prints and modern reproductions of the corpus, which all have their prototype in the first printed edition, namely the xylograph produced at Dags Iha sgam po monastery in 1520 (siglum DK.A). There are considerable differences between the two recensions with regard to the con­tents, the formation of textual units, the arrangement of the materials, the editing of the language, the provision of titles for texts, and the attribution of authorships. The differences between the two recensions and the ramifications of these differences have already been discussed elsewhere (KRAGH, 20 l 3c ). To gain deeper understanding of the concrete compilation history of the corpus, a detailed comparative study of the two recensions is required to uncover the different textual layers for the several hundred individual text segments. That is a larger project whose findings shall not be presented here, but which will be the topic of a separate publication. Instead, the remaining part of chapter four will give a brief overview of the different versions of the texts belonging to both recensions. Thereafter, chapter five will present a detailed study and summary of the basic text of the younger and more well-known recension, i.e., the printed text of ms DK.A. The study and summary is intended to lay a foundation for any future study of the corpus by creating a reference system that clearly identifies and defines all the individual segments of DK.A. 446 For a discussion of the problematic authorships found in the corpus, see KRAGH (2013c:384-391). 447 For a description of the manuscript, bibliographical details, and the reason for the label given to the text, see KRAGH (2013c:371-372). As for the choice of employing a Greek letter as its siglum, this reflect a standard practice in Biblical text critical scholarship, according to which Greek letters are assigned to handwritten manuscripts, whereas Roman letters are given to printed manuscripts. The same principle has been adopted here to distinguish sigla for handwritten manuscripts and printed texts"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmi�sion 3. The Lha dbang dp al 'byor Manuscript (Siglum DK. a) 167 The date and provenance of manuscript DK.a are unknown, since the manuscript contains no colophon describing its production. The only clue to its making is a tiny caption given on the cover page of volume DK.a. Ka, saying: \"This is the beginning of 31 Dharma lessons starting from here, [written] with great care by Lha dbang dpal 'byor. [May it be] auspicious! \"448 In the above reproduction of the relevant page, the line mentioning the scribe Lha dbang dpal 'byor appears in very tiny script within the bottom of the rectangular frame, set beneath the main body text (i.e., beneath the third line starting po 'i gdam ngag gnyis ste ). Since all four volumes of the manuscript are written in a single hand in very neat dbu can script, Lha dbang dpal 'byor must be the name of the scribe who committed the texts to writing. It is also possible that he additionally was a compiler, redactor, or editor of the corpus. Even though the name Lha dbang dpal 'byor is quite rare in Tibetan sources, it unfortunately has remained impossible at this stage of research to arrive at a conclusive identification of the person in question. Tibetan historical sources of the period contain information on only two persons named Lha dbang dpal 'byor. The first is a Dge lugs pa monk, whose teachers were the Abhi­dharma master Pa:i:i chen Mchog lha ' od zer (1429-1500) and the thirteenth Dga' Jdan khri pa Chos kyi bshes gnyen (1453-1540). This Dge lugs pa monk, Smad gling Lha dbang dpal 'byor (TBRC P454), whose dates approximately are 1475-1540, is in some sources mentioned as a teacher in the Dge lugs transmission line of Vasubandhu Kofakara's 448 DK.a.Ka. ] a: 'di nas gzung ste chos tshan sum bcu so cig kyi dbu/ /lha dbang dp al 'byor kyi[s} legs par b::.abs!! l1W1?1gha la1?1il."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"168 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission Abhidharmako§a and its commentaries449 and is in other sources listed a member of the Dge lugs line of the reading transmission (lung) of Dharmaklrti's Pramii!wvarttika.450 The other known Lha dbang dpal 'byor of the period is a Sa skya pa monk by the name Sde snod 'dzin pa Bsod nams lha dbang dpal 'byor (151h century), who is listed as the scribe of a short eulogy poem composed by the great Sa skya pa master Go rams pa Bsod nams seng ge at th e Byams chen chos grwa college in 1466.451 Given their affiliations with other traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, both the known persons of the most probably period with the name Lha dbang dpal 'byor are very unlikely candidates for the Lha dbang dpal 'byor mentioned on th e first fol io of DK.ex. A hypothesis of a different identity of Lha dbang dpal 'byor shall, however, be set forth here. The hypothesis remains rather specul ative but it is perhap s nevertheless the best qualified guess as to his identity that is possible at this stage of research. In the period 1470-1476, the second 'Brug chen Rin po che (the head of the 'Brug pa bka' brgyud school), Kun dga' dpal 'byor (1428-1476), served for a short time as the thirteenth abbot of Dags Iha sgam po monastery until the abbatial responsibility could again be returned to the descend­ants of Sgam p o pa's family line. Kun dga' dpal 'byor had previously developed a close student-teacher relationship with the eleventh abbot of Dags Iha sgam po, Sgam po Chos rje Bsod nams rin chen dpal (1416-1466), having received a number of teachings from him.452 Kun dga' dpal 'byor visited Dags Iha sgam po several times and spent periods there in 449 See the gsan yig of the fifth Dalai Lama (1617-1 682), Rgyal dbang thams cad mkhyen pa phyag na padmo kun gzig lnga pa chen po'i nang gi rnam par thar pa zab pa dang rgya che ba'i dam pa'i chos kyi th ob yig gangga 'i chu rgyun (TBRC W294-1804), Lhasa xylograph, vol.

In this source, Lha dbang dpal 'byor is mentioned as Gling smad Lha dbang dp al 'byor, suggesting that he was a teacher at the \"lower community\" (gling smad), being a monastic section that historically was applicable to internal parts in several well-known Dge lugs monasteries. The most famous Gling smad was in Se ra monastery in Lha sa (see DREYFUS, 2003:366 fn. 74), but Gling smad was also the name of similar sections in other Dge lugs mona­steries, such as Byams pa gling monastery in Chab mdo.

The Dpal 'byor part of his name remains unattested in the currently studied sources, but it is noticeable that Dpal 'byor is the final part of the monastic name of his famous brother Kun dga' dpal 'byor, and if the two brothers had received monastic ordination from the same teacher it would customarily be the case that the last part of their monastic names would be identical, i.e., Dpal 'byor in both cases. Moreover, if Lha'i dbang po also maintained some association with Dags Iha sgam po monastery (likewise presently unattested) through his brother's abbacy and extended residence at the hermitage, it is conceivable that Lha'i dbang po could have been involved in making a new manuscript copy of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum during his brother's abbacy in the period 1470-1476, perhaps based on the earlier manuscript that was presented to Kun dga' dpal 'byor at his inauguration ceremony as mentioned above. Lha'i dbang po might then have signed the new manuscript that he produced with the name Lha dbang dpal 'byor. If that is so, Lha'i dbang po would be the Lha dbang dpal 'byor who was the maker of DK.a, which would set the date of the manuscript in the 1470s. Such a dating would fit well with other features of the manuscript and would place it earlier than the first xylograph print of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum produced at Dags Iha sgam po in 1520, partly on the basis of DK.a. This theory concerning the identity of Lha dbang dpal 'byor remains highly hypothetical, but it is at least a qualified guess that would seem to fit the circumstances and dating well. Generally speaking, the manuscript must be dated somewhere in the period after the gter ma revealing activities of Dung tsho Ras pa (died ca. 1329) at Dags lha sgam po, given that his gter ma extracted from lake Sgam po dar is included in DK.a.Ga.88b-92b, and it must be dated earlier than the printing of DK.A in 1520. Hence, in any case, the date of DK.a falls in the second half of the fourteenth century or in the fifteenth century. DK.a consists of four or five volumes. Four volumes are respectively labeled alphabeti­cally Ka, Kha, Ga, and Nga. A possible fifth volume, if considered to be a separate volume, is labeled Ka, but in order to distinguish it from the other volume Ka it is here going to be referred to as Ka Thar rgyan (DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan), given that this volume only contains Bsod nams rin chen's Ornament of Liberation (Thar rgyan in brief) . It is also possible that the two volumes labeled Ka originally made up two parts of a single volume, but with separate internal pagination.

The Dags lha sgam po Xy lograph of 1520 (Siglum DK.A) In the male iron dragon year (lcags pho 'brug gi lo), i.e., 1520 CE, the sixteenth abbot of Dags Iha sgam po monastery, Sgam po Bsod nams Jhun grub457 (1488-1552) produced the first printed edition of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum using xylographic printing technique.458 Dags Iha sgam po, which by the sixteenth century had become a small monastery of the Dags po bka ' brgyud tradition, originated as a remote mountain hermitage founded by Bsod nams rin chen. It was there that he spent the second half of his life surrounded b y his students. Given the special heritage and renown of the monastery as being Bsod nams rin chen's seat (gdan sa) and that Bsod nams rin chen was regarded as a major founding figure for all the later Bka' brgyud sub-schools, the printing of the first edition of Bsod nams rin chen's teachings was accordingly a project of great prestige and consequence for the monastery. Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub, whose tenure as abbot was 1510-1531,459 was himself a descendant (dbon po, literally 'nephew') belonging to a family line that reached back to Bsod nams rin chen's brothers. Aside from overseeing the xylograph publication of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum,460 Bsod nams lhun grub is also known to have authored two works ofhis own. The first is his adaptation of the second Zhwa dmar pa's large Sgam po pa hagiography, discussed above.46 1 The second is a lineage history of Atifa's Mind Training transmission entitled Blo sbyong snyan brgyud chen mo.462 It is unknown exactly when the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum was first created as a complete corpus prior to its printing in 1520. Clearly, ms DK.a represents at least one version that predates the first print DK.A. Given that ms DK.a is a precious \"golden manuscript\" that is finely executed in a careful dbu can handwriting produced by a single hand, whose creation must have been very costly and time consuming, it is quite conceivable that the manuscript represents a very significant edition, perhap s even the first full compilation of the miscella-456 For details of the modem publication, seep. 196 below.

It is at least clear that the corpus is referred to under the name Dags po'i bka ' 'bum in several primary sources prior to 1520, such as life stories of several persons before this date.464 For example, a brief biography of Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub, who was the publisher of the 1520 xylograph, states that during his teenage years (i.e., in the 1500s, some fifteen to twenty years before producing the printed edition) he received the reading transmission (lung) for the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus from Spyan snga Rin po che at Dags Iha sgam po monastery.465 Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub does not specify how many or which manuscripts he relied on when producing the 1520 printed edition. Yet, text critical analysis of individual works from the corpus reveals that ms DK.A probably was based on one or more other prototypes aside from ms DK.a.466 It is therefore very likely that DK.A is a so-called misch­codex, i.e., a text that has been created on the basis of several different textual ancestors. 463 In comparison, a handwritten golden manuscript was, for example, the beginning for the gsung 'bum edition of the collected works by Phag mo gru pa. That manuscript was compiled and written down under the supervision of the famous 'Bri gung pa scholar Kun dga' rin chen in 1507 (for details, see SCHILLER, 2002:124- 127, 215-224). 464 There is much evidence attesting the existence of individual texts or passages from the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum in earlier centuries, being evidence that shall be presented in a later publication. The question raised in the present context, however, only pertains to the evidence of the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum existing as a complete compilation or corpus and not just as individual texts. 465 See Gangs can 'dir ston pa'i rgyal tshab dp al sgam po pa'i khri gdung 'dzin pa'i dam pa rnams kyi gtam bai diirya'i phreng ba, folio 70a6 in S0RENSEN & DOLMA (2007:223). For a further example, see the story of Nam mkha' rgyal mtshan (1475-1 530) cited by EHRHARD (2000:52-53) (cf. KRAGH, 20 13c:398), which stresses the great rarity of the bka' 'bum of Sgam po pa in the late fifteenth century. 466 Critical Tibetan editions and annotated translations of the five Ts hogs chos texts from the corpus are currently being prepared for future publication and the information given here is derived from those analyses. Using the standard techniques of text criticism, the editions reveal that ms DK.A repeats many of the corrupt readings found in ms DK.a, meaning that DK.A must have had DK.a or one of its ancestors as its prototype. However, DK.A does not repeat all the corrupt readings found in DK.a, which either means that very thorough editing and correction of the text took place when the first printed edition was produced (as also attested by the listing of the names of editors in the internal printing colophons) or it suggests that DK.A may additionally have been based on one or more other earlier manuscripts (aside from DK.a), which did not contain some of the faulty readings found in DK.a. Furthermore, in a few instances, DK.A introduces a number of corrupt readings of its own, which either suggests that these are new corruptions created when DK.A was being copied or that these are corruptions which can only be explained as having been derived from mistakes found in one or more earlier manuscripts used as prototypes for the text. In a few instances, the latter scenario quite clearly seems to be the case. Detailed philological analysis thereof will be presented in connection with publishing the said critical editions."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"172 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission It appears that DK.A consists of two separate volumes, although the volume division is not immediately evident from the microfilm in which the print is available today.46 7 In total, the corpus consists of 734 folios measuring 49,7 x 9,1 cm (19.5\" x 3.6\"), printed with black ink on both sides of light-colored paper.

Although not indicated explicitly, the texts seem generally to be arranged in the order of their genre. The first volume contains texts belonging to four genres: hagiographies (rnam thar), teachings to the gathering (tshogs chos), answers to questions (zhus !an), and Tantric instructions (khrid yig). The second volume likewise contains texts belonging to four genres: texts on Mahamudra, texts on miscellaneous topics (gsung thor bu), eulogies and prayers (bstod pa and gsol 'debs), and expositions of the stages of the path (lam rim).

The title of the text, Rje sgam po pas mdzad pa'i tai lo nii ro 'i rnam thar bzhugs, rests on a lotus flower with an ornate decoration arching over the title. The alphabetical text label Ka stands above the title within a separate box. A frontispiece of similar design is found on the cover of text DK.A.E.1.1 a, but the microfilm of that folio is too smudged and dark to reproduce the image here. On the verso folio lb of text DK.A.Ka, the 1520 xylograph has two line-drawings that frame the text to the left and right. The left drawing is a picture of three figures -Vajra­dhara (center), Tilopa (left), and Naropa (right) -seated on a single throne. A caption beneath the figures reads: \"Homage to Tailopa! Homage to Vajradhara! Homage to Naropa!\"469 The right drawing likewise depicts three figures -Mar pa (center), Mi la ras pa (left), and Bsod nams rin chen (right) -seated on a single throne. The drawing is very blur­red in the extant print and the caption is illegible. The text proper begins on the verso side of the first folio, which has a larger script than that of subsequent folios. The recto left margin of all folios is marked by the alphabetical text label (e.g., Ka) and the folio pagination (e.g., bzhi), both written vertically. The cover pages of all the following texts in the two volumes, e.g., texts DK.A.Kha, etc., do not have any ornate drawings as found on the fronti spiece of the first text. However, the beginning of each text is marked by a simple cover page displaying the alphabetical text label, e.g., Kha, set within a small box with a pointed top, below which is the title of the text in question set in a double-lined square box. The pagination begins anew for each section. On regular folios, there are seven lines of text. DK.A contains printing colophons in several of its texts. The colophons explicitly testify to the fact that the printing of the xylograph was completed on September 26, 1520, in the A 'khar bde chen temple at Dags Iha sgam po under the supervision of abbot Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub. A short version of the printing colophon is found in eighteen texts of the corpus, namely DK.A.Ba, DK.A.Wa, DK.A.Za-DK.A.Chi, and DK.A.Vaf!! .

The Mang Yul Gung Thang Xy lograph (Siglum DK.B) Fifty two years after the first printed edition of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum had been publishedin 1520 at Dags Iha sgam po monastery, a reprint of the corpus was made in 1572 by theprinter Gnas rab 'byams pa Byams pa phun tshogs (1503-1581) in the Mang yul gung thangregion of southern Tibet. This reprint shall here be referred to with the siglum DK.B. The new printing blocks for the reprint were directly based on the 1520 xylograph (DK.A), which in text critical terms means that DK.B is an apograph, i.e., a direct copy anddescendant, of DK.A. DK.B has been preserved in two incomplete prints as well as in six fragments.471 Itseems that the xylograph contained 42 works in total, having two short extra texts added tothe 40 works already found in DK.A. Combining together the various parts of DK.Bpreserved across the different prints, a total of 37 of its texts are extant, while five texts thatprobably were part of the original xylograph DK.B are not found in any of the availablepaper prints.

The sixth and final fragment is a nearly complete print of text DK.B.E (Dags po thar rgyan) belonging to Sempa Lodoe in Glo smon thang. It was filmed by NGMPP on April 30, 1987 (reel no. Ll36/7 , running no. L1652). The majority of the texts can be established as being prints of the same xylographic printing blocks simply on the basis of the identical passages that are shared between them and their uniform design. The only exception to this principle is text DK.B.E, which only 473 It should be noted that segments DK.B.Nga and DK.B.Da are reversed in the microfilm and their places should be swapped to reflect the proper order of the corpus. 474 In two earlier publications (KRAGH, 20 11a:l62 and 20 13c:370 fn. 25), I have erroneously regarded microfilm NGMPP L247/4 to be of a separate xylograph from DK.B, which I labeled DK.C and referred to as \"a later reprint of the Mang yul gung thang xylograph, the date and origin of which are unknown.\" However, after renewed careful consideration of the textual evidence, I have now come to the conclusion that microfilm L247/4 simply is another paper print of DK.B whose printing quality is somewhat lesser than the prints represented by the other microfilms, perhaps reflecting that the wooden printing blocks had become quite worn out by the time when this print was made. Aside from minor tear and wear of individual letters in L247/3, there are no substantial differences between the texts shared by the various microfilmed DK.B prints, such as L24 7 /4 and L 1 18/3 . 475 The NGMPP microfilm and online catalog currently also lists reel numbers L36/3 and L36/4 as fragments from Sgam po pa's Dags po'i bka' 'bum.

This fragment can be proven to be part of xylograph DK.B given the similarity in the design of its frontispiece decoration that it has with the frontispiece found on the cover of text DK.B.Ka in prints L118/3 and L456/15. Generally speaking, frontispiece designs of early xylographs reflect particular styles of craftsmanship that typically were unique to specific printing houses in pre-modern Tibet. They can consequently often be used in provenance studies to identify related prints (or parts of prints) and their geographic origin. Xylograph DK.B is such a precise copy of its prototype DK.A that it reproduces each text of the corpus with the exact same pagination of each and every folio. Only the line breaks (but not the folio breaks) differ slightly in comparison to DK.A. Moreover, text critical analysis477 confirms that DK.B is a direct descendant of DK.A, because DK.B reproduces nearly all the corrupt readings of DK.A and introduces a small number of new corruptions of its own. The few cases where DK.B has a correct reading in lieu of a corrupt reading in DK.A can all be justifiably explained as simple emendations of minor, obvious spelling errors. Aside from reproducing the works from DK.A, xylograph DK.B has added two new eulogies to the corpus and has in the process thereof given a new alphabetical label to the eulogy entitled Rj e khu dbon rnam gsum la bstod pa utpala gzhon nu 'i chun po (DK.A. *Nyi) composed by Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal in 1519, which in DK.A was left without an alphabetical label. In DK.B, the said eulogy has been given the label OJ'n and the two extra eulogies have been furnished with the labels A(i and Hurn. It is uncertain whether the eulogy Shes bya ma ascribed to Phag mo gru pa (DK.A.*Ji) was reproduced in DK.B, since it is missing in all the extant prints. The first of the added eulogies (DK.B.A�, 2 folios) is a short poem entitled Prayer to the Stages of the Path of the Two Charioteers whose Teachings were transmitted to the Master Candraprabha Kumara [i.e., Bsod nams rin chen] (Rje zla 'ad gzhonu la bka' bahs pa'i shing rta gnyis kyi lm?1 rim gsol 'debs).478 The colo­phon states that it was composed by the seventh Karma pa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454-1506). The second added eulogy (DK.B.Hum, 2 folios) bears the title \"A Praise to Mount Peace\" (Ri bo shan ti 'i gnas bstod), being a poem that describes the religious marvels of Mount Dags Iha sgam po, also known as Ri bo Santi. The author is not named in the text, but a line in the poem identifies the narrator as Bsod nams rin chen himself.479 He is said to have song the poem at the ridge of Copper Valley (zangs lung gsal sgang) on Mt. Dags po to the three realized men from Khams (rtogs ldan khams pa mi gsum), i.e., Karma pa Dus gsum mkhyen pa, Phag mo gru pa Rdo rje rgyal po, and Gsal stong Sho sgom in the male 477 My text critical editions and annotated translations of the five Ts hogs chos texts from the corpus will be forthcoming in a future publication. 478 See fn. 144. 479 DK.B.Hum.1 . l b4: \"[This] is the practice place of mine, Dags po Iha rj e\" (nga dags po lha rj e'i sgrub gnas yin)."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"178 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission water dragon year (chu pho 'brug gi lo).480 The authorship is though very questionable;because the poem is unknown in the earlier tradition. Also, the cited water dragon year is impossible if the story were taken to be true, because the only water dragon year in Bsodnams rin chen's life time was 1112, which is nine years before he reached Dags Iha sgam po and long before the arrival of the mentioned students. All the short scribal colophons mentioning the names of scribes and wood carvers foundin DK.A have been removed in DK.B. Instead, DK.B includes three scribal colophons of its own. The first scribal colophon is found at the end of text DK.B .Ta. It names the scribewho copied the letters of text Ta, saying: \"From the top of part Ta , [the text] was designedby Nam mkha' mgon po.\"481 The identity of Nam mkha' mgon po is not known. The second.scribal colophon is found at the end of text DK.B.Hiim, which reads: \"May it be auspicious! The letters of this print were written by the fingertips of Gaba Bkra shis [from] lower Lanbde. By this good action, may all beings quickly attain buddhahood!\"482 The toponym\"lower Lan bde\" (Ian bde smad kyi cha) seems to be an orthographic variant of the Lan de.valley near Mang yul gung thang, where the famous sixteenth-century printer Lha btsunRin chen mam rgyal (1473-1557) ran a printery at Glang phug cave (EHRHARD, 2000:17).It may be the case that the scribe in question had received his training at or was otherwiseassociated with that facility. The third colophon is a carver's colophon found in the middleof the large treatise Dags po thar rgyan at the end of the text's chapter fifteen. It gives thename of the person who carved (brkos) the wood blocks for the first half of the text, saying:\"The twelve [chapters?] till here were carved by Dpal ldan rdo rje. \"483 The name Dpal ldanrdo rje is not identified with a known person.

The first case is text DK.B.Ga, which is the large Sgam po pa hagiography composed by the publisher of the 1520 xylograph, Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub. In the 1520 xylograph (DK.A.Ga), the publisher includes an extensive colophon describing the making of the hagiography and its printing at Dags Iha sgam po in 1520.484 In DK.B.Ga, the full colophon from DK.A is included up to the point of mentio­ning the printing in 1520. To this, DK.B adds a phrase stating that the present print was redacted directly from the 1520 xylograph produced at Mount Santi, i.e., Dags Iha sgam po monastery.

However, aside from the lotus, the decorative parts of the frontispieces of DK.A and DK.B differ. Rather, the various elements of DK.B's frontispieces are very similar to other such designs seen on sixteenth-century xylographs produced in the Mang yul gung thang region in southern Tibet.489 Those xylographs were produced at several different local printeries by publishers and craftsmen who had been educated in the production of the large xylographic printing projects undertaken in the southern region by the Bka' brgyud teacher Gtsang smyon He ru ka Rus pa'i rgyan can (1452-1 507). Three such cases can be listed here, where similarities can be observed in the decorative designs between DK.B and other sixteenth-century manuscripts from the region around Mang yul gung thang in the south. The first is the frontispiece of the 1533 xylograph of the Rnying ma treatise Th eg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod originally composed by Klong chen rab 'byams pa and printed by Chos dbang rgyal mtshan at Kun gsal sgang po che hermitage located southwest of Mang yul gung thang.490 In this example, the lotus element and the flaming jewel on top are similar to those of DK.B but the remaining ornaments differ in design. The second case is the frontispiece of a hagiography of Gtsang smyon He ru ka composed and printed by Rgod tshang ras pa Sna tshogs rang grol (1494-1570) in 154 7 at the printery of Ras chung phug hermitage (SMITH, 200 l :62). 491 The hermitage is located east of Mang yul gung thang at the intersection of Yar klungs and 'Phyong rgyas valleys.

Concerning other decorative elements in DK.B, the xylograph has line drawing illustra\"'tions in texts DK.B.Ka, DK.B.Ga, and DK.B.E. On folio DK.B.Ka.l.lb, there are two linedrawings of Vajradhara flanked by Tilopa and Naropa and of Mar pa flanked by Mi la raspa and Bsod nams rin chen. These motifs are identical with the line drawings found in thesame text of DK.A. The drawing style is also rather similar and the captions beneath thepictures correspond as well to those of DK.A. On folio DK.B.Ga.l.lb, there are two linedrawings of Bsod nams rin chen (left) with the caption mnyam med dags po Iha rj e la namo (\"Homage to the incomparable Doctor from Dags po\") and his student Phag mo gru pawith the caption rj e phag mo grub pa la na mo (\"Homage to the venerable accomplishedone from Phag mo\"). Xylograph DK.A does not have any line drawing in the correspondingtext, although blank spaces are left where the drawings were to be expected.

The final folio of the same text in the microfilm of DK.A has no such drawings, but -as noted above - a comparison between DK.A and DK.B of the prayers written in the last lines of the text seems to suggest that the final folio in DK.A.E is missing in the extant print on the microfilm. While the available internal evidence of DK.B only arrives at the conclusion that the xylograph is an apograph of DK.A and that it was produced somewhere in the Mang yul gung thang region in the sixteenth century, there exists a piece of external evidence that in high likelihood settles the question of the xylograph's provenance. One of the printers who were active in Mang yul gung thang in the sixteenth century was a Bka' brgyud monk named Gnas Rab 'byams pa Byams pa phun tshogs (1503-1581). Byams pa phun tshogs had studied with the teachers Lha btsun Rin chen rnam rgyal (14 73-1557) and Rgod ts hang ras chen (1482-1559), both of whom were xylograph printers in their own right (EHRHARD, 2010: 129). Byams pa phun tshogs writes in his auto-biography that at the age of 69 (corresponding to age 70 in the Tibetan manner of counting age), he produced xylographic prints (spar) of a number of works, inter alia, the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum. The sentence says: At my age of 70, I produced xylographs of numerous texts, including the complete Dags po bka ' 'bum (Dags po bka' 'bum yongs rdzags), the complete volumes of the Buddha's liJ.taka stories composed by Aryasura and Rang byung rdo rj e, Khro [phu] Lo [tsa ba]'s hagiographies of the three Siddha-Pa!1¢itas, [L]ce Bsgom pa's Ri khrod gsang ldan sgron me, the short sutra on Amoghapafa, and other works.494 Byams pa phun tshogs refers to the Dags po'i bka' 'bum with the phrase \"the complete Manifold Sayings of Dags po\" (dags po bka ' 'bum yangs rdzags), which is how the long printing colophons of DK.A label the corpus.495 The auto-biography establishes that the 494 See the 93-folio xylograph Mkhas grub chen po byam[s] pa phun tshogs kyi rnam thar ngo mtshar snang ba'i nyin byed yid bzhin nor bu (TBRC W25576), fo lio 9la6f rang lo bdun bcu pa la/ dags po bka' 'bum yongs rdzags/ sangs rgyas kyi skye rabs dp a' bo dang rang byung rdo rj e gnyis kas md::,ad pa'i gleg bam yongs rdzags! khro lo 'i pan grub gsum gyi mm!1 thar/ ces bsgom pa'i ri khrod gsang ldan sgron me! don yod zhags pa'i mdo chung sogs sp ar mang du bsgrubs!.

It should though be noted that while the frontispiece design of DK.B is typical for prints from the Mang yul gung thang region, it is somewhat dissimilar from the frontispiece of another known xylograph published by Byams pa phun tshogs.498 If new evidence should surface in the future of other sixteenth-century Dags po'i bka' 'bum xylographs whose frontispiece designs are closer to the style known from Byams pa phun tshogs's publica­tions, it may be necessary to revise my claim, but until such evidence becomes available, it shall here be maintained that DK.B is the Mang yul gung thang xylograph published by Byams pa phun tshogs in 1572. 6. The Sde dge Xylograph (DK.D) At some point in the nineteenth or early twentieth century, a new xylograph print of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum was produced at the renowned printery Sde dge par khang chos mdzod chen mo, belonging to the Sa skya monastery Lhun grub steng in Sde dge in eastern Tibet. The printery had been established in 1729 by the king of Sde dge, Bstan pa tshe ring, whereafter it became a major publishing center for Tibetan texts belonging to most of the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism (KOLMAS, 1971.I: 10).499 The two-volume Sde dge xylograph of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum, which shall here be referred to as DK.D, has been preserved in an older paper print obtained in Sde dge in June 496 This can, e.g., be seen in a sentence in the auto-commentary where he correlates his age 63 (Tibetan age 64) with the tiger year of 1566 (folio 89b5_6): rang lo drug bcu re bzhi pa stag gi lo la. 497 In two earlier publications (KRAGH, 20 1 1a:162 and 2013c:370 fn. 25), I have erroneously written that the xylograph was produced in 1575, which needs to be corrected to 1572. Although the sentences in the auto-biography (lines 9la2 and 91a3) that immediate precede the above-cited sentence mention first the bird year of 1573 and then the dog year of 1574, it is evident that the author's mentioned age of 69 must refer to 1572 and not to 1575 as might otherwise be expected from the preceding context. 498 It was at this time only possible to compare DK.B with the frontispiece of a single other xylograph published by Byams pa phun tshogs, namely his publication of Legs par bshad pa rin po che'i gter gyi 'g rel pa, in the form of a photocopy of the cover page made available on a lecture handout by Franz-Karl EHRHARD at the meeting of the International Association for Tibetan Studies (IATS), Konigswinter, 2006. 499 For further details on the history of the printery, see the MA thesis by SCHEIER-DOLBERG (2005)."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Man(fo/d Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmis11ion 185 1922 by the French traveler and explorer Mrs. Alexandra DAVID-NEEL (1868-1969). The print was subsequently brought to Paris, where it is today kept at the Musee national des Arts asiatique Guimet.500 The folios measure 6x45,5 cm. Another more recent reprint was produced in 1987 from the Sde dge xylograph blocks and it seems that some slight revisions were introduced into the printing blocks when this reprint was made.501 The reprint has been obtained by the TBRC in the late 1990s and is now kept at the TBRC where it has been digitized (TBRC W22393). The following description of the Sde dge xylograph is based on examination of a few sample pages from the 1922 Paris print and the complete 1987 reprint of DK.D. The DK.D xylograph does not give a general title for the corpus, given that it starts directly on its first cover page with the title of text DK.D.Ka, but the short corpus title Dwags po 'i bka ' 'bum is written vertically in the left margins of all verso folios. The xylograph consists of two volumes, which respectively are labelled E and Vm?l. Each individual text has its own pagination. The cover pages of the individual texts have titles framed within a double rectangular box, being the standard design used in nearly all traditional woodblock print publications from the Sde dge printery.502 A list of contents of the DK.D xylograph made on the basis of the Paris print was pub­lished by SEYFORT RUEGG (1962:323-324) in his review article of Herbert V. GUENTHER'S English translation of Th e Jewel Ornament of Liberation (1959).503 Volume E contains twenty four works (texts DK.D.Ka-DK.D.Ra), while volume Varyi contains thirteen works (DK.D.La-DK.D.Nyi). Hence, the xylograph includes 37 texts in total, following the over­all arrangement of the texts first made in DK.A. It is evident that DK.D is based directly on the 1520 xylograph from Dags Iha sgam po monastery (DK.A). This is attested by the fact 500 The library accession numbers for the two volumes entitled Dvags po bka' 'bum in the Musee Guimet are T0541 and T0542. The Tibetan town Sde dge is spelled Dirgi on the French library catalog card for the text. I wish to thank reference librarian Dr. Francis MACOUIN at the Musee Guimet for his most kind and excellent service in providing me with photocopies of a few sample pages from the print. It should be noted, however, that the full 1922 Paris print of DK.D has not been digitized and I did not manage to visit Paris and consult the whole print when writing this book. 501 A new printing colophon was inserted at the end of text Ga (DK.D.Ga.2.50b). The colophon mentions that the print was made at the Sde dge printing house (sde dge par khang chos mdwd chen mo bkra shis sgo mang) in the Fire Hare year of the seventeenth Rab byung cycle (rah byung bcu bdun pa me yos pa 'i lo), which corresponds to 1987. The colophon also mentions that the 1987 reprint was supervised by Karma Byang chub shes rab. Without further detailed comparison with the 1922 Paris print of the Sde dge xy lograph, it remains uncertain whether any other changes have been introduced into the new 1987 reprint. 502 See the cover pages of all the texts of DK.D reprinted in facsimile in the Sde dge printing house catalog by KOLMAS (1971.1:262-269). The order of the two volumes has been reversed in KOLMAS' publication, as also noted by the author (op.cit.: 11). 503 At the time when SEYFORT RUEGG wrote the article, the Paris print of DK.D was kept at the Ecole Frarn,:ais d'Extreme Orient (SEYFORT RUEGG, 1962:323 fn. 6), but it has since been moved to the Musee Guimet as noted above."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"186 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission that DK.D reproduces some of the short printing colophons found in DK.A, which were not included in the Mang yul gung thang xylograph of 1572 (DK.B). Short printing colophon s stemming from DK.A are reproduced in texts DK.D.Ca.21.50a2, DK.D.'a.14.l lb4_5, DK.D.Ra.ll.12as, andDK.D.La .5.llb5. In spite of being based on DK.A, there are four texts in regard to which DK.D deviates from DK.A, namely in comparison to DK.A.Ga, DK.A.Pa, DK.A.*Ji, and DK.A.*Nyi. Firstly, the Sgam po pa hagiography found in DK.A.Ga is the adapted version of the Large Hagiography made by Sgam po Bsod nam lhun grub, the Kun khyab snyan pa'i ba dan thar pa rin po che'i rgyan gyi mchog. In DK.D.Ga, however, this hagiography has been replaced with the second Zhwa dmar pa Mkha' spyod dbang po's original version, the Kun khyab snyan pa'i ba dan. In the 1987 reprint of DK.D, the hagiography by Zhwa dmar pa has been furnished with a longer colophon (DK.D.Ga.2.56b s-57as) arguing for why the printers of the Sde dge xylograph chose to include this hagiography instead of the hagio­graphy by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub found in DK.A. However, given that text DK.D.Ga is missing from the 1922 Paris print (SEYFORT RUEGG, 1962:323 fn. 6), it is uncertain whether this part of the DK.D.Ga colophon belonged to the original DK.D xylograph or whether it was only added at the time of the reprint in 1987 along with the later part of that text's colophon (DK.D.Ga.2.57a6-57b6), which was explicitly added in 1987. Secondly, DK.A.Pa is a Tantric instruction text on the Six Doctrines of Nampa entitled Chas rj e dags po lha rj e'i gsung/ Khrid chos mu tig tsar la brgyus pa. This work has been entirely left out in DK.D without any stated reason. Consequently, there is no text DK.D.Pa, so text DK.D.Na is followed directly by DK.D.Pha.504 Thirdly and fourthly, the two eulogies found in DK.A. *Ji and DK.A. *Nyi composed by Phag mo grub pa and Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal are omitted in DK.D. The alphabetical labels 'Ji' and 'Nyi' have instead been applied in DK.D respectively to the texts Chas rje dags po lha rj e'i gsung/ bstan bcos lung gi nyi 'od (DK.D.Ji = DK.A.ValTl) and Dam chos yid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan (Dags po thar rgyan) (DK.D.Nyi = DK.A.E) in that order, which means that the two texts in DK.D appear in the reverse order of DK.A where the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od (text DK.A.Va1T1) follows after the Dags po thar rgyan (DK.A.E). 504 The omission is attested by the modern TBRC print of DK.D (TBRC W22393-I01JW305), where the Western pagination continues directly from page 000556 to 000557 between texts DK.D.Na and DK.D.Pha. The omission is also attested by the older Paris print of DK.D found in the Musee Guimet as shown in SEYFORT RUEGG's list of its contents (SEYFORT RUEGG, 1962:323). It should be noted that SEYFORT RUEGG incorrectly labels text DK.D.Pha with the alphabetical label Pa and instead has no alphabetical label Pha in his list (cf. his fn. 6). This error can be accounted for by the fact that it is rather difficult to see the additional stroke in the Pha letter in the printed text on most pages, but it is there if one looks carefully. In comparison to the text order of DK.A and its later apographs, it is evident that the label in DK.D should be Pha and not Pa."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmis�ion 187 Furthermore, DK.D introduces a new set of decorative line drawings that differs from the illustrations found in DK.A and DK.B. The first set of new line drawings are found in volume E as follows: Vajradhara (DK.D.Ka.1.1 b left) and Naropa (DK.D.Ka. l. I b right), Maitripa (DK.D.Ka. l.2b left) and Mar pa (DK.D.Ka.1.2b right), and Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (DK.D.Ga.1.1 b center). These drawings are attested in the 1922 Paris print and as well as in the modern 1987 reprint of DK.D.505 A second set of line drawings are found in the final text of volume VmJi, the Dags po thar rgyan, as follows: Mi la ras pa (DK.D.Nyi.1.1 b left), Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (DK.D.Nyi.1.1 b right), the ninth Si tu pa Padma nyin byed dbang po (1774-1853) (DK.D.Nyi.l.2b left), and 'Jam mgon Kong sprul Blo gros mtha' yas (1813-1899) (DK.D.Nyi. l.2b left). At the present stage of research, the latter set of drawings in text DK.D.Nyi has been attested in the 1987 reprint of the xylograph, but it has not been possible to verify whether the same drawings are also found in the 1922 Paris print. If the drawing of Blo gros mtha' yas is found in the old Paris print, it would suggest that the Sde dge xylograph either was produced in the late nineteenth century after Blo gros mtha' yas had become a famous Buddhist master in his own right or, perhaps more likely, after his death in 1899 forming a terminus post quem for the produc­tion of the xylograph, yet before Alexandra David-Neel obtained her copy in 1922, thus forming a terminus ante quem. 70 The 1974 Dolanji Publication (DKP) The first modern publication of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum was published in a single volume by Topden Tshering in 1974 under the title Selected Writings of Sgam-po-pa Bsod-nams­rin-chen (Dwags-po Lha-rje) with the biography written by his descendant Sgam-po-pa Bsod-nams-lhun-grub, reproduced fr om a rare manuscript collection from the Gemur Monastery in Lahul. The book was distributed by the Tibetan Bonpo Monastic Centre (i.e., the re-founded Menri Monastery of the Bon po tradition) in Dolanji, Solan District, Hima­chal Pradesh. The volume includes a short introduction by E. Gene SMITH giving a bit of background information about Bsod nams rin chen and a few general remarks about prints of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum found in European collections. The volume has since been digitized by the TBRC (W23346). Given the reproduction possibilities in India in the 1970s, the publication is not an actual facsimile reprint of an original xylograph, but is a modern handwritten copy (what Gene SMITH called a 'trace') in dbu can script of the eighteen texts found in the first volume (£) of the Mang yul gung thang xylograph of 1572 (DK.B.Ka to DK.B.Tsha). Thus, the \"rare manuscript collection from Gemur Monastery in Lahul\" mentioned in the publication's title as being the basis for the copy can be identified as being the first volume of DK.B. Gemur (Dge mur or Dge smur) monastery is a small temple located above Gemur village in the upper part of Bhaga valley, Lahul-Spiti District, Himachal Pradesh in northern India, 505 Only the drawing of Sgam po pa cannot be verified in the Paris print, given that the relevant text (DK.D.Ga) is missing in the Paris print."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"188 Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission approximately 18 kilometers from Keylong (Kye Zang) and 38 kilometers from Manali. Given the strong presence of the 'Brug pa bka' brgyud school in Lahul valley, it is likely that Gemur temple belongs to that order. The temple's foundation dates back to the fourteenth century and it was one of the oldest temples in the region. Around the year 1973, however, the temple was wholly destroyed by an avalanche and a new temple was later rebuilt nearby on a safer spot, housing the statues an d other items that could be salvagedfrom the old temple.506 It is unclear whether the mentioned Gemur print of the DK.Bxylograph survived the avalanche, though it should be noted that Topden Tshering' s publication of the handwritten copy was published about a year after the incident. Thepresent-day whereabouts of the original xylograph copy are unknown. There are three indications that DK.P has DK.B as its prototype. Firstly, DK.P includesthe text DK.B.Pa, which is omitted in the Sde dge xylograph (DK.D) and the Sgam po pahagiography found in DK.P.Ga is the version by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub that isincluded in the xylographs DK.A and DK.B but not in DK.D. These facts rule out thatDK.D could have been the prototype for DK.P and point to DK.A or DK.B.

Thirdly, DK.P.Ga.2.86b1-4 reproduces the unique printing colophon ofDK.B.Ga.2.62a5-7, and DK.P.Ba.8.2lb5 omits the short printing colophon found in the DagsIha sgam po xylograph (DK.A.Ba.8.15b1), just as it is omitted in DK.B.Ba.8.15b. Theseindications in general and the evidence of the printing colophons of DK.B being reproducedin DK.Pin particular suggest that DK.B was the basis for the DK.P handwritten copy. 8. The 1975 whul Publication (DK, Q) In 1975, a second modern print of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum was published by Khasdub Gyatsho Shashin in Lahul, Himachal Pradesh.

The publication's Tibetan title is Bsod nams rin chen gyi rnam thar thar rgyan. The print consists of two volumes labeled stod cha and smad cha printed and bound in a large A3 book format, which include 39 works (DK.Q.Ka to DK.Q.Chi).

Similar to DK.P, DK.Q is not a facsimile reproduction of an original xylograph, but it is a modem handwritten copy (a 'trace') in dbu can script. The scribe of DK.Q might be the same copyist who produced DK.P. The copy is based on a xylograph print found in a small temple named Bkra shis chos rdzong in Miyad valley, Lahul. It seems that the xylograph prototype for the handwritten copy is either DK.A, or DK.B, or eventually a third, still un­known xylograph based on DK.A. It is clear that DK.D cannot be the prototype, because DK.Q.Ga contains the Sgam po pa hagiography authored by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub that is only found in DK.A and DK.B, and further because DK.Q also includes text Pa, which is omitted in DK.D. There is strong evidence to suggest that the prototype was DK.A, because at the end of the Sgam po pa hagiography DK.Q.Ga.2.74b1.3 reproduces the printing colophon of the 1520 Dags Iha sgam po xylograph (DK.A.Ga.2.62as.7), except for the final sentence in DK.A stating the name of the scribe. This colophon in DK.Q does not agree with the revised version of the same colophon found in DK.B.Ga.2.62a5-7. No other printing colophon attested in DK.A or DK.B is reproduced in DK.Q. There is, however, an unusual and unfortunately incomplete colophon found at the very last folio of DK.Q.Chi. l.17a1-6 (p. 495), which has no corresponding part in the extant prints of DK.A and DK.B. In its place, DK.A.Chi. l.12a6-7 has the short printing colophon of the Dags lha sgam po xylograph, while text Chi is not found in any of the extant fragments ofDK.B. The said colophon of DK.Q is undated and it is therefore not entirely clear whether it pertains to the making of the handwritten Lahul reproduction in 197 5 or whether it belongs to the original xylograph on the basis of which the reproduction was made. Since the toponyms mentioned in the colophon seem to belong to Mang yul gung thang in Tibet or, less likely, to Mnga' ris in Western Tibet and not to Lahul in Himachal Pradesh, it is likely that the colophon was part of the original xylograph. The colophon is written poetically in verse and mostly consists of prayers, but it nevertheless provides a few historical clues.508 One of the prayer lines expresses the wish 508 The colophon reads (DK.Q.Chi.1. l 7a16): ... bod yul mnga ' ris yin/ Is a la sa'i dp al kun ldan pa'i ljongs! !dpal 'bar khyung rdzang dkar po zhes bya ba/ /chos rgyal chen po yab sras rnaTJ1 pa nil lp hyir rgol mi mthun phyogs las rgyal gyur cigl !!kai! de yis legs par skyabs pa yul gyi mchog/ !'um lung zhes bya dge bcu 'dzam pa'i yul! /p hu na lta gnas gangs ri mtho la brjidl !m do na gtsang chab snyan pa'i glu dbyangs sgrogs/ !bar na rtsi shing nags tshal 'bru bcu sminl Ide 'dra 'dzom pa'i yul gyi mchog dbus 'dir/ /y on gyi bdag po pad ma zhes bya yis! /s angs rgyas bstan pa 'di ni rgyas phyir"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"190 Chapter 4: The Man(fold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission that the publication will promote the rule by the Dharma king of Dgung thang (dgung thang chos rgyal mnga' thang brgyas phyir dang), probably referring to the king of Mang yul gung thang in Southern Tibet, given that Dgung thang occasionally appears as an ortho­graphic variant of Gung thang. The colophon also mentions the toponym \"White Garuc;t Fortress\" (dpal 'bar khyung rdzong dkar po zhes bya ba) as a place associated with the grea monarch (chos rgyal chen po yab sras), which likely refers to the royal seat of Mang yu gung thang known by that name. It might, however, alternatively refer to a small temple i Mnga' ris in Western Tibet also known by that name.509 It should be observed that th colophon in its first extant line also mentions Mnga' ris in general terms (bod yul mnga' riSyin). Finally, the colophon states that the publication's patron (yon bdag) was named Pad ma, that the scribe (yi ge pa) was named Smon thang kun rgyal, and that the publication project included the Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum and the 'Bar ra bka ' 'bum, the latter probably referring to the Manifold Sayings of 'Ba' ra ba Rgyal mtshan dpal bzang (1310-1391); Given that xylograph DK.B was produced in Mang yul gung thang, it is tempting to think that the colophon hails from that print and thus would provide further details about the making of that xylograph in 1572. However, since text Ch i is missing in all the extant fragments of DK.B and the colophon is not attested elsewhere in those fragments, it is impossible to reach a firm conclusion concerning a link between the colophon and DK.B. In conclusion, it cannot at present be determined with certainty which xylograph served as the prototype for the reproduction of DK.Qin 1975. Text critical analysis or new evidence will be needed to reach any further identification. 9. The 1982 Darjeeling Publication (DK.R) A third modern publication of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum was published in 1982 by theKargyud Sungrab Nyamso Khang located in Darjeeling. It consists of three volumes in po.ti(dpe cha) format and bears the title: Collected Wo rks (gsuri 'bum) of Sgam-po-pa Bsod­nams-rin-chen, reproduced from a manuscrip t reflecting the tradition of the Dwags-lhadang/ /dgung thang chos rgyal mnga' thang brgyas phyir dang/ /'gro drug sems can bde skyid 'byung phyir dang/ !d rin can pha ma'i drin Lan bsab phyir dang/ lkhyad par rang gi sdig sgrib sbyang phyir du/ !dags po bka' 'bum 'bar ra bka'bury1 ma1!1sl /s gyu ma'i nor la snying po blangs pa'i phyirl /bzhengs pa 'di ni yon bdag pad ma lags// kyai/ dge la 'degs ston mdzad pa'i nye drug rnam pa nil /dpal 'byor ldan pa'i yon bdag sangs rgyas skyab ma dang/ /dge la mos pa'i dbon ma rnary1 sp yod gtsang ba'i grub pa mo ...

It is evident that the first line bod yul mnga' ris yin is incomplete, because its five syllables are two syllables short of the verse meter. The preceding folio is missing and has been left blank in the publication (pp. 493-494). 509 For a reference to the Mnga' ris khyung rdzong dkar po temple, see the text Mnga' ris khyung rdzang dkar po'i nye 'dabs kyi nam gling dgon sder sde pa !has sbyin bsam 'grub kyis sbyor jags sags gnang ba'i dkar chag written in 1728 included in the gsung 'bum of KaJ:i thog Rig 'dzin Tshe dbang nor bu (1698-1755) (TBRC W29688), volume 5, pp. 67 1 -678."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmiss.�on 191 Sgam-po redaction prepared through the effo rts of Spyan-s1ia Bsod-nams-lhun-grub from the Hemis Monastery in Ladakh. The volumes have been digitized by the TBRC (W23566). The book contains a handwritten copy (a 'trace') in dbu can script, which according to the information provided in the publication's title and preface is based on a print of the I 520 Dags Iha sgam po xylograph (DK.A) found in Hemis Monastery, a 'Brug pa bka ' brgyud institution in Ladakh. The published transcript is marred by numerous orthographic errors. It is remarked in the preface that the xylograph print was fragmented and missed several parts. Consequently, the publication only contains 28 of the 40 works found in DK.A with the following twelve parts missing in comparison to DK.A: DK.A.Ta, DK.A.Tha, DK.A.Da, DK.A.Na, DK.A.Pha, DK.A.Wa, DK.A.Ci, DK.A.Chi, DK.A.*Ji, DK.A.*Nyi, DK.A.E, and DK.A.Varp. The fact that DK.A was the prototype for the publication is attested by that DK.R reproduces in full all the printing and scribal colophons of DK.A found in the texts included in the book, in particular the long printing colophon at DK.R.Ga.2. l 32a1_5 and the s hort printing colophons found throughout the latter half of the bka ' 'bum, e.g., DK.R.Za.1. l 7a5_6, etc.510 The present-day whereabouts of the Hemis xylograph print of DK.A are unknown, but it is notable that the print includes text DK.A.Ma, which is missing in the NGMPP L594/l print of DK.A. The publication contains a new set of decorative illustrations, none of which is named with captions, but which may be identified as reflecting the following 'Brug pa bka ' brgyud lineage bla mas: Atifa (DK.R.Ka.1.1 b center), Vajradhara (DK.R.Kha.1.1 b center), Tilopa (DK.R.Nga.l.lb center), Mi la ras pa-Mar pa-Sgam po pa (DK.R.Ca.1.lb left, center, and right), Naropa (DK.R.Cha.1.1 b center), Phag mo gru pa (DK.R.Ja.1.1 b center), Gling ras pa Padma rdo rje (DK.R.Pa.1.1 b center), Gtsang pa rgya ras Ye shes rdo rje (DK.R.Ba.1.1 b center), and an unidentified monk wearing a pa7:1cjita hat with hands in teaching mudra holding two lotus flowers supporting a wisdom sword and a book (DK.R.Ma.1.1 b center). 10. The 2000 Kathmandu Publication (DK.S) To date, the most complete modern publication of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum was produced in 2000 by Khenpo S. Tenzin (mkhan po bshad sgrub bstan 'dzin sku mched) and Lama T. Namgyal (bla ma 'phrin las rnam rgyal).511 The publishing house is Gam-po-pa Library, which is part of the Buddhist monastery Shri Gautam Buddha Vihara in Kimdol, Swayam­bhu, Kathmandu, Nepal. The monastery belongs to the 'Brug pa bka ' brgyud tradition and was founded in 1986 by Bia ma 'Trin las Rin po che.

It is notable that the title thus explicitly presents the content as being works authored by Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen and not merely a collection ocmaterials pertaining to the early tradition of Dags lha sgam po, which -as noted earlier -iS; also a possible and likely interpretation of the general Tibetan title for the corpus, i.e., the \"Manifold Sayings of Dags po\" (Dags po'i bka' 'bum). The title Dwags po'i bka ' 'bum also appears in the present publication, namely as the short corpus title printed vertically in the left hand margin of all verso folios. The edition has been digitized by the TBRC (W23439).'The publication is a newly-made computer-typed copy of the corpus. It contains 38 of, the forty works found in DK.A along with a list of contents (dkar chag), a modern text o the reading transmission for the corpus (lung gi thob yig), and a short printing colophon (par byang). The works are distributed among the four volumes as follows. Volume 1 (Ka) contains a twelve-page dkar chag entitled Chos rj e sgam po pa 'i gsung 'bum yid bzhin norbu'i dkar chag chos kyi sgron me as well as works DK.S.Ka-Ja (corresponding to DK.A.Ka-la). Volume 2 (Kha) consists of texts DK.S.Nya-Dza (DK.A.Nya-Dza). Volume 3 (Ga) has texts DK.S.Wa-Gi (DK.A.Wa-Gi). The final volume 4 (Nga) contains texts DK.S.Ngi-Chi (DK.A.Ngi-Chi), DK.S.Ji (corresponding to DK.A.Varµ), and DK.S.Nyi (DK.A.E). The arrangement of the final texts is thus in accordance with the arrangement ofDK.D, where the order of the texts Bstan bcos lung gi nyi 'od (DK.A.Varµ I DK.D.Ji) andthe Dags po thar rgyan (DK.A.EI DK.D.Nyi) are reversed in comparison to DK.A, and thetwo eulogies found in DK.A (DK.A.*Ji-*Nyi) are left out. The Sgam po pa hagiography found in DK.S.Ga is, however, the version composed by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub, which reflects the choice of DK.A rather than DK.D. The fourth volume (Nga) of DK.Sfurther contains two supplementary texts, viz. a survey of the reading transmissions (lung) for the Dags po'i bka' 'bum (text DK.S.Ti) entitled Lung gi thob yig and a short publication colophon (text DK.S.Thi) entitled Par byang smon tshig. These additional texts are writtenby the modern editors of DK.S. The publication's dkar chag (pp. 2-4) mentions the alphabetical label system applied tothe forty texts of the Dags Iha sgam po xylograph (DK.A) and states that the labels Ji and Nyi of the two final works, i.e., the bstan bcos lung gi nyi 'od and Dags po thar rgyan, have here been adopted on the basis of the Sde dge xylograph (DK.D). The dkar chag also mentions alternative alphabetical labels Ka, Kha, and Ga used in an unspecified corpus consisting of excerpts from the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um (gsung 'thor bu) containing the Dags po 513 An English translation of the Tibetan title might be: \"The Manifold Sayings (gsung 'bum) of the supreme Bsod nams rin chen, the protector of beings, the glorious and incomparable Sgam po pa, a Dharma king of the three realms, which are like a wish-fulfilling gem.\""},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmis§ion 193 thar rgyan, the cycle of the five Tshogs chos texts, and the cycle of texts containing Mahiimudrii instructions. Moreover, the dkar chag (pp. 10-11) clarifies which xylograph prototypes (ma dp e) were employed as the basis for the computer-typed copy of the present publication. The dkar chag says: The prototype manuscript (ma dp e) for this publication was kindly lend to us from a collection of rare manuscripts acquired from afar through great efforts on part of the eminent accomplished master Bsod nams bzang po Rin po che without any regard for the personal hardships involved. This codex was input as it is from text Ka onwards. However, two works in the codex' first volume (E), namely texts Ga and Pa, were missing and the input of these texts was therefore supplemented on the basis of the Dwags Iha sgam po xylograph [DK.A]. Furthermore, we carefully consulted other available prints, such as the three-volume hand-written publication from the 'Brug pa community in Darjeeling [DK.R] and the Rtsib ri spar ma corpus. However, we did not venture make emendations, since introducing such changes could cause some doubt, so we choose to adopt the readings of the prototype manuscript (ma dp e) in all cases. We therefore request Buddhist scholars (lit. \"those possessing the eyes of Dhanna\") to pay heed to such passages.514 The explanation given here establishes that a print of DK.A was only employed to supplement the input of texts DK.S.Ga and DK.S.Pa. Instead, the input was based on a print of a different xylograph, which had been obtained from a collection gathered by the famous 'Brug pa bka ' brgyud master Bsod nams bzang po Rin po che (1888-1984).515 The dkar chag passage does clarify which xylograph print this might be. However, text critical analysis reveals that the xylograph in question must be the Sde dge xylograph (DK.D). Hence, it becomes evident that when the editors state in the quoted dkar chag passage that texts Ga and Pa were missing in the employed prototype, it refers to the fact that DK.D.Ga contains a different Sgam po pa hagiography than the one included here in DK.S.Ga, name­ly the hagiography composed by Zhwa dmar Mkha' spyod dbang po rather than the one made by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub, and that DK.D entirely omits text Pa. In brief, it is observed that DK.S is strictly based on DK.D, except for texts DK.S.Ga and DK.S.Pa 514 Chas rj e sgam po pa'i gsung 'bum yid bzhin nor bu'i dkar chag chos kyi sgron me, pp. 10-11: ...

It may be added that DK.S.Ga.2.6lbz_5 thus includes the printing colophon of DK.A. The publication, moreover, contains a novel text entitled Mnyam med sgam po pa'i gsung 'bum gyi lung gi thob yig (DK.S.Ti), which provides lineage histories for the reading transmission (lung) of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum. The first part of the text describes how one reading transmission for the whole corpus was passed down from Bsod nams rin chen through the Kanna kalJi tshang lineage and reached the editor of the publication, Bia ma 'Phrin las rnam rgyal, from the sixteenth Karma pa Rang byung rig pa'i rdo rje (1924-1981) . The editor also received the Karma km!l tshang reading transmission of the corpus from another source, namely a lineage that went via Ra ho sprul sku, to the mkhan po of Dpal spungs monastery Karma 'od zer (1896-1945), and on to Bia ma Bzod pa mthar phyin (201h century). The second part of the text describes another reading transmission of the same corpus stemming from the 'Brug pa bka' brgyud school, which the editor received from Khu nu Bla ma Bstan 'dzin rgyal mtshan (1894-1977) with an added transmission of the yogic instructions in text DK.A.Khi obtained from Seng brag Rin po che (1947-2005). The decorative line drawings found in the publication include a drawing of Sgam po pa at the beginning of the first volume (DK.S, vol. Ka , Dkar chag, p. 2) and a drawing of a stupa at the end of the last volume (DK.S, vol. Nga, Par byang, p. 673). 11. The Karma Lekshay Ling Digital Edition (DK.T) In November 2008, an electronic version of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum was published online.516 The date of the publication is not stated in the publication's printing colophon (par byang, file 39), which only contains a dedication prayer that does not furnish any pub­lication information. However, the month and year of publication is listed on the download website. The publication is created in the TibetDoc software in its dct file format and is electronically searchable.517 It was published by the Karma Lekshay Ling Institute, a Buddhist school and learning institution following the Kanna Ka1Ji tshang tradition, located in Kathmandu, Nepal.518 The edition is based on the 2000 Kathmandu publication (DK.S), given that it reproduces a printing colophon of that work at the end of text DK.T.Nyi, the Dags po thar rgyan. It is, however, not clear whether the electronic version consists of the original computer files used to produce DK.S or whether the text has been retyped on the basis of the printed version of DK.S. Text critical analysis is needed to verify this. 516 The electronic edition is available for free download at the webpage http://www.dharmadownload.net/index.html.

The texts of DK.Tare not laid out in the Tibetan dp e cha format used in DK.S, but are instead set up in a modem A4 page for­mat. Consequently, DK.T does not follow the pagination of DK.S. DK.T includes folio number citations internally within each text, which provide a folio number with recto folios labeled na and verso folios labeled ba. The folio numbers do not refer to DK.S but generally accord with the folio changes found in the Sde dge xylograph (DK.D), which served as the prototype for DK.S. Yet, three texts in DK.S do not have DK.D as the prototype for the internal folio numbers. Thus, DK.S.Ga and DK.S.Pa do not have DK.D as their prototype, since those texts are not found in DK.D. Instead, those two texts are based on DK.A. Accordingly, the internal folio references in DK.T.Pa are to the folio numbers of DK.A.Pa. However, the internal folio references in DK.T.Ga are to the modem page pagination of an unidentified publication of the Sgam po pa hagiography having the page numbers 1-181, which do not accord with any of the pre-modern or modern publications of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum listed in this book. In DK.T.Nyi (the Dags po thar rgyan), the internal folio references do not precisely correspond to any known xylograph. Given that DK.T is an electronic text, the page formatting of the text is not stable and fixed across different versions of the TibetDoc software in which it is written. Conse­quently, it is not possible to provide exact page and line number references to the publica­tion, which can be assured to be exact even with future updated versions of the software. For this reason, all page references given in the present book to DK.T are made only by citing the folio numbers listed internally in the electronic text, i.e., the folio numbers that mainly correspond to the folio numbers of xylograph DK.D. No line numbers have been provided to DK.T. When citing the internal folio number references of DK.T, recto folios have been cited with the English letter 11, reflecting the Tibetan letter na, which is how the folio references have been given in the electronic text. For example, folio reference 2a is being cited as 2n. Verso folios are cited with the English letter b, as it also the case with references to all other text recensions in the present book. 12\" Miscellaneous Partial Prints Aside from the premodern and modern publications of the complete Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus, there also exist various handwritten manuscripts, xylographs, and modern books in Tibetan that contain single texts or selected works from the Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum. The most important of these shall be listed here. In the years 1934-1958, the 'Brug pa bka ' brgyud master 'Khrul zhig Padma Chos rgyal (1876-1958) of Ladakh published a large corpus in 31 volumes of contemplative and yogic texts pertaining to the traditions of Mahiimudrii, Nii ro chos drug, and Rdzags chen. The woodblocks for the print were made at La stod rtsib ri in Western Tibet (a.k.a. Rgyal gyi shrl ne'u steng) and the corpus is consequently known as the Rtsib ri'i par ma.

The corpus was reprinted in facsimil by the Kargyud Sungrab Nyamso Khang publishing house in Darjeeling in 1978-1985 an it has been digitized by the TBRC (W20749). Seven works from the Dags po'i bka ' 'bun·are included in the Rtsib ri'i par ma. Volume Ka (W20749-1264) includes the Dags po tha rgyan (pp. 33-479, DK.AB) and the Lam mclwg rin po che 'i phreng ba (pp. 481-515 DK.A.Chi). Volume Ca (W20749-1268) includes the Mahiimudrii text Sems kyi mtsha nyid gab pa mngon du phyung ba (pp. 1-18, DK.A.Pha) and the four Zh us Zan texts (pp. 19 283, DK.A.Da, DK.A.Tha, DK.A.Ta, and DK.A.Na in that order).519 It has not yet bee verified which earlier print of the Dags po 'i bka ' 'b um served as the prototype for the text included in the Rtsib ri 'i par ma. Moreover, in 1997, the 13th Zhwa dmar pa Mi pham chos kyi blo gros (1952-2014 published a corpus of Indian and Tibetan Mahiimudrii works entitled Nges don phyag rgy chen po'i khrid mdzod or in short Phyag chen mdzod. The corpus has been digitized by th TBRC (W23447). Volume Ka (W23447-1894) contains 19 works from the Dags po'i bka 'bum, namely texts DK.A.Ma to DK.A.Ngi. Volume Kha (W23447-1895) contains a furthe · six works, namely DK.A.Ta to DK.A.Da along with DK.A.Cha to DK.A.Nya. The thre Zhus Zan texts in volume Kha (corresponding to DK.A.Ta, DK.A.Tha, and DK.A.Da) are facsimile reprints of these works from the Rtsib ri'i par ma. All the remaining works from the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum in the two volumes are newly created woodblock prints, whose prototype is unknown. Again, in 2004, a large corpus of texts related to the 'Bri gung bka ' brgyud tradition was published in Lhasa by Agon Rinpoche (A mgon Rin po che). The corpus consists of 15lvolumes and bears the full title Th ub bstan don brgyud snying po bka ' brgyud rin po che'.spyi dang dp aZ Zdan 'bri gung bka ' brgyud kyi rim byon brgyud pa'i zhaZ skyin zab rgyasgsung rab bzhugs so 'tshaZ phyogs gcig tu bsgrigs pa'i gZegs bam gyi phreng ba bka ' brgyud.chos mdzod chen mo. In brief, it is referred to as the 'Bri gung bka ' brgyud chos mdzod. Ageneral list of contents has been published by Per K. S0RENSEN and Sonam DOLMA(2007:317-404). The corpus has been digitized by the TBRC (WOOJW501203). The four volumes labeled Da to Pha contain a facsimile reproduction of the five vol� umes of the handwritten golden Lha dbang dpal 'byor manuscript of Dags po'i bka ' 'bum (DK.a). The reproduction has been slightly altered in minor regards as described by KRAGH (2013c:372). The reproduced volumes include DK.a.Ka, DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan, DK.a.Kha, DK.a. Ga, and DK.a.Nga. The volumes DK.a.Ka and DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan have been printed in a single volume (vol. Da, pp. 1-271 and 273-505 respectively).

The same volume then c ontinues with four other works from the Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum, which are new copies (possibly handwritten) based on DK.A given that the copies of each text includes the s cribal and printing colophons found in DK.A, namely texts: DK.A.Pha (pp. 181- 294), DK.A.Chi (pp. 294-321), DK.A.VaJ:Tl (pp. 321-391), and DK.A.Ngi (pp. 391-415). Further, v olume Pa includes a relative late Sgam po pa rnam thar entitled Rje btsun sgam po pa rin po che 'i rnam thar lo rgyus bsam gyis mi khyab pa la cha ts am smos pa (pp. 417-492) by an anonymous author. The volume ends with two later works. The first text is entitled Mnyam med dwags po rin po che 'i snyan brgyud (pp. 493-590). It is said to contain special instruc­tions from an oral lineage (snyan brgyud) hailing from notes that Bsod nams rin chen is said to have taken of Mi la ras pa's instructions and later verified with Mi la ras pa's main student Ras chung pa. The second text is an anonymous work bearing the title Dp al 'khor lo bde mchog snyan brgyud dwags po lugs kyi man ngag gi rtsa ba brjed byang ma (pp. 591-643), which holds yoga instructions for the Cakrasamvara practice. The last volume of the 'Bri gung bka ' brgyud chos mdzod containing works from the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum is volume Pha. This volume first provides a facsimile reproduction of DK.a.Nga (pp. 1-316). This is followed by a copy of text DK.A.Ga (pp. 317-497) based on DK.A including its printing colophon. Aside from such large corpora containing selected works from the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um, there also exist numerous handwritten manuscripts, xylograph prints, and modern publica­tions of individual works from the Dags po'i bka' 'bum. A few notable cases shall be mentioned here. On Feburary 2, 1994, a handwritten manuscript in dbu med script of the Mahamudra text Snying po don gyi gdam pa phyag rgya chen po'i 'bum tig (DK.A.'a) was filmed by the NGMPP (reel no. L470/9, running no. L4983). The manuscript seems to be a handwritten copy of DK.B. It consists of eleven folios measuring 7,8 x 45,5 cm and contains no inform­ation about its date or place of copy. The manuscript belongs to the private library of Perna Lama in Sgang yul, Nepal. As mentioned previously, a xylograph of the text Bstan bcos lung gi nyi 'od (DK.A.VaJ:Tl) was produced in 1550 at the Brag dkar rta so hermitage in Mang yul gung thang in southern Tibet by the printer Lha btsun rin chen rnam rgyal (1473-1 557).520 The Gsung rab nyams gso'i par khang printery at Rumtek monastery in Sikkim, India, has also produced woodblock prints of several individual works from the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum. The newly produced xylograph blocks are said to have had the Sde dge edition ( DK.D) as their prototype and prints thereof are distributed by the library of the Karma Shri Nalanda Institute, P.O. Rumtek via Ranipul, Sikkim 737135, India. It should though be noted that the page lay-out and pagination of the Rumtek prints do not correspond exactly to the Sde dge edition. The first Rumtek print from the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum is an anthology of the five Tshogs chos and the four Zhus Zan texts from the Dags po'i bka' 'b um 520 See fn. 492 for details of the different available prints and microfilms of this xylograph."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"198 Chapter 4: The Man(fold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmission .

The xylograp contains a printing colophon (par byang, folios 180b-l 83a) written by the 16th Karma p Rang byung rig pa'i rdo rje (1924-1981).52 3 On May 24, 1987, the NGMPP filmed a xylograph print of the Dags po thar rgya (DK.A.E) and Lam mchog rin po che'i phreng ba (DK.A.Chi) printed as a single volume i 112 folios measuring 7,7 x 47,5 cm (reel no. L150/5, running no. Ll834). The print belongs' to Mr. Chos dag in Smon thang, Nepal. The alphabetical section label hiiln appears verti� cally in the left hand margin of recto folios, suggesting that the print is part of a large corpus, perhaps a still unidentified xylograph of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum. Though th combination and arrangement of the two texts are similar to volume Ka of the Rtsib ri'i pa ma, the present print is not identical to any of the known publications of the Dags po'i bk 'bum or other corpora, and the woodblock printing quality seems to be older than the Rtsi ri'i par ma. The print contains a printing colophon (folios 111 b1-112a) which ends abruptly thereby suggesting that a final folio is missing. Unfortunately, the preserved part of th colophon does not provide any historical information that could lead to identifying the provenance of the publication. A xylograph of the Dags po thar rgyan in 162 folios has, moreover, been published in modem time in Bhutan. The xylograph's printing colophon (folios 161bd62a4) states th6'. place of publication to be Punakha Dzong (spung thang bde ba chen po) and the publisherto be named Bstan 'dzin rgyal mtshan. The print has the thick-lined black text frames on the frontispiece and individual folios that are characteristic of Punakha prints.524 The xylograph'has been digitized by the TBRC (W1 KG3680) . Another xylograph of the Dags po thar rgyan has been digitized by the TBRO(W1CZ1013). The digitized print is incomplete, as it lacks the final folios, ending abruptly on folio 124 in the middle of chapter 21. The xylograph is not identical to any other Dags po thar rgyan print listed here and since its final folios, where the printing colophon migh have been found, are missing, the print's origin remains unknown. The xylograph bears th alphabetical label Di in the left-hand margins of recto folios. The label suggests that the text is part of a larger corpus, probably placed as text no. 41 in the collection. Comparatively; 521 I have previously seen a print of this publication in the library of the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi in the 1990s, but the xylograph has not been available to me at this point in time and hence I cannot provide any detailed information here. 522 A print thereof is found in the Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek in Munich, Germany (call no. 2° L. tibet. 7s) (GRONBOLD, 1989:83). 523 Two prints of this text are also found in the Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek in Munich, Germany (call nos. 2° L. tibet. 28 x and 2° L. tibet. 30 k) (GRONBOLD, 1989:122, 148). 524 In his review 6f GUENTHER'S translation of the Jewel Ornament of Liberation, SEYFORT RUEGG (1962:322-323 fn. 5) remarks that GUENTHER relied on the Bhutanese print of the Tibetan text for his translation."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Chapter 4: The Manifold Sayings of Dags po -Background and Transmi�sion 199 the Dags po thar rgyan features as text no. 39 in DK.A and text no. 38 in DK.S. Given this placement and its rel ative similarity to existing prints of the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum, it is possible that the unknown corpus in question might be another Dags po'i bka ' 'bum xylograph that is still unidentified. Finally, there exist several modern book-form publications of the Dags po thar rgyan and Lam mchog rin po che'i phreng ba produced in India, Nepal, an d China. An often-used combined edition of the two texts, simply entitled Th ar rgyan, is the 1989 Chinese publication with 371 pages brought out by the Si khron mi rigs dp e skrun khang (Sicl1Uan minzu chubanshe 12]} 11 �JmtBll&U) in Chengdu (ISBN 7-5409-0380-5/B.13).

The present study will focus on the later recension represented by the first printed edition of the corpus, i.e., ms DK.A produced at Dags Iha sgam po monastery in 1520. The reason for this choice offocus is twofold. Firstly, the later recension is, by far, the more well-known and widespread of the two versions, as reflected in the many later prints and publications directly or indirectly based on that edition. Accordingly, in order to provide scholars with a useful survey of the version most generally available, it is necessary, as a first step, to present the structure and contents of ms DK.A, which served as the prototype for all later Tibetan prints and modern publications of the bka' 'b um. Secondly, a detailed study of the earlier recension of DK.a presupposes thorough know­ledge of the later recension. The argument is here that the first printed edition, ms DK.A, introduced a new textual and thematic structure into the corpus. The editors of the print reorganized the entire corpus into forty textual units and provided each text with a title, whereas the earlier recension contains no logical or thematic internal structure and its contents are not divided into textual units.525 Hence, if the reader begins by becoming familiar with the ordered contents of the later recension, it becomes considerably easier to approach the complexity of the material found in the earlier recension, even if such an approach carries the risk of giving rise to a tendency of thinking of the earlier recensionanachronistically in terms of the structure found in the later recension. In the following pages, a detailed survey of the first xylograph of 1520 (DK.A) shall therefore be presented, while a thorough study of the earlier recension (DK.a) along with discussion of the earliest compilation history of the corpus predating ms DK.a will be reserved for a later publication.526 525 For a study of the changes introduced into the corpus when the first xylograph was produced along with a general discussion of the technological and religious context in which such editorial projects took place in fifteenth and sixteenth century Tibet, see KRAGH (2013c). 526 Shorter surveys of the bka' 'bum in accordance with its structure originally introduced by ms DK.A (though not necessarily based on the earliest xylograph of that recension) have previously been presented by SEYFORTRUEGG (1962), KRAGH (1998:8-28), and SHERPA (2004:97-124)."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 201 The DK.A xylograph contains forty texts, the majority of which are presented in the corpu s as containing the oral teachings or 'sayings' of Bsod nams rin chen. Such authorship attribution is achieved by labeling each text with a novel titel that ascribes its authorship to h im.527 The publisher of DK.A, Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub, did not explain in what form the texts of the corpus existed prior to producing the first print. However, when looking at the colophons of the individual texts, it quickly becomes clear that the majority of the works were not written by Bsod nams rin chen himself but rather were produced by his students or later followers of his teachings, because the names of individual authors often are stated in the internal colophons. Most of the texts are therefore not exactly primary sources attesting Bsod nams rin chen's own writings. For the most part, they are are secondary sources written in a timespan lasting up to two centuries after Bsod nams rin chen's demise, reflecting how later followers perceived and reconstructed Bsod nams rin chen as a persona and his teachings as a transmi ssion. Nevertheless, in terms of understand­ing the reception history of the corpus, it is significant to keep in mind that the Tibetan tradition itself generally considers the majority of the texts to reflect the exact words spoken by Bsod nams rin chen and that passages from the corpus therefore tend to be quoted in later Tibetan works with the authority (if not 'authorship') of Bsod nams rin chen.528 The following table provides an overview of the forty texts contained in the 1520 Dags Iha sgam po edition of Dags po'i bka ' 'bum (DK.A) . The table divides the print into its two volumes labeled E and VmJi, but it should be noted -as explained previously -that the volume division remains uncertain and somewhat hypothetical. The table further divides the contents into eight genre divisions, namely (1) hagiographies (rnam thar), (2) teachings to the gathering (tshogs clws), (3) answers to questions (zhus lan), (4) meditation manuals concerned with the six doctrines of Naropa (na ro 'i chos drug gi khrid yig), (5) Mahamudra meditation manuals (phyag chen gyi khrid yig), (6) miscellaneous sayings (gsung thor bu), (7) Sgam po pa eulogies (bstod pa), and (8) treatises concerned with the stages of the path (lam rim gyi bstan bcos). These genre divisions are my own and do not appear explicitly in the xylograph (DK.A) or in any other edition of the corpus.529 They merely represent a very rough segregation of the internal structure of the corpus. The listed folio numbers express the number of leaves, which are printed on both sides, i.e., recto (a-side) and verso (b-side). 527 For discussion of the ascribed authorships in the printed version, see KRAGH (2013c:384-391). 528 There have though also been premodem Tibetan voices that have been critical of the authorship attributions in ms DK.A. For a discussion of Padma dkar po's (1527-1592) critical opi­nion, see KRAGH (2013c:393-394). 529 For more details on the genre division, see KRAGH (2013c:380-382)."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"202 Label Ka Kha Ga Nga Ca Cha Ja Nya Ta Tha Da Na Pa Pha Ba Folios 7 6 62 12 45 18 18 19 10 50 15 4 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum English Translated Title Original Tibetan Title VolumeE Genre: Hagiographies (rnam thar) Th e Hagiographies of Ta i lo and Naro written by the Master SRam po pa The Hagiographies of Master Mar pa and the Eminent Mi la Th e Best of Jewel Ornaments of Liberation Adorning the Banner of Pervasive Renown: A Precious Wish-fulfilling Jewel in the Form of a Hagiography of the Dharma Master, th e Eminent and Great SRam po pa Rje sgam po pas mdzad pa'i tai lo nii ro 'i rnam thar Rj e mar pa dang rj e btsun mi la 'i rnam thar Chas kyi rj e dp al ldan sgam po pa chen po'i rnam par thar pa yid bzhin gyi nor bu rin po che kun khyab snyan pa 'i ba dan thar pa rin po che'i rRyan RYi mchoR Genre: Teachings to the Gathering (tshogs chos) Th e Te ach ing to the Gathering entitled Tshogs chos bkra shis phun Profusion of Good Fortune tshOJ?S Legs mdzes's Te aching to th e Gathering Mgon go zla 'ad gzhon nus Given by the Protector Candraprabha mdzad pa'i tshos chos legs mdzes Kumiira ma Sayings of the Dharma Master, the Doctor Chas rj e dags po lha rj e'i gsung/ fr om Dags po: The Teaching to the Gathering tshogs chos yon tan phun tshogs entitled Profusion of Good Qualities The Te aching to the Gathering entitled the Ts hogs chos mu tig gi phreng ba Pearl Rosarv Th e Precious Master of Dags pa's Large Rj e dags po rin po che'i tshogs Teach inR to th e GatherinR chos chen mo Genre: Answers to Questions (zhus Ian) Master Dags pa's Oral In struction and Rj e dags po zhal gdams dang/ Answers to th e Questions of Master Bsgom rj e bsgom tshul gyi zhu Ian tshul Answers to the Questions of Dus gsum Dus gsum mkhyen pa 'i zhu Ian mkhyenpa Answers to the Questions of Master Phag mo Rj e phag mo grub pa'i zhus Zan Grub pa Answers to the Questions of Rnal 'byor Chas Rnal 'byor chos 'byung gi zhus 'byunf?

Dags po'i bka' 'bum: Hagiographies (Rnam thar) The first volume of DK.A commences with three hagiographical texts (rnam thar) whose topics cover the founders of the Bka' brgyud lineage, including Tilopa, Naropa, Mar pa, Mi la ras pa, and Sgam po pa. These works form a short, so-called \"golden rosary of the Bka' brgyud tradition\" (bka ' brgyud gser 'phreng). The first two works (DK.A.Ka and DK.A.Kha) are, in fact, made up from a single work, which has been separated into distinct texts, each with its own cover page, pagination, and alphabetical section label. These features are not found in the earlier handwritten ms DK.a. Both works originate from the series of hagiographies composed by Rgyal ba Khyung tshang ba Ye shes Bia ma ( 1115-1176). The newly introduced cover page of text Ka incorrectly attributes its authorship to Sgam po pa (rje sgam po pas mdzas pa 'i), while the cover page of text Kha provides no such suggestion about the authorship of the text. The third work in the series, text DK.A.Ga is, however, a hagiography of much later provenance, namely the Sgam po pa hagiography written by the publisher of ms DK.A, Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub, in 1520 in connection with producing the first printed edited of the corpus. In other words, the final part of Ye shes Bia ma's original series of Bka' brgyud hagio­graphies, namely the part dealing with Bsod nams rin chen, has been removed and by doing so the original writer's colophon, wherein the authorship for the whole series of hagio­graphies by Ye shes Bia ma is stated, is gone.531 By incorrectly attributing the first of the hagiographies (DK.A.Ka) to the authorship of Sgam po pa on the newly inserted cover page, ms DK.A gives the wrong impression that Bsod nams rin chen wrote the hagiographies of Tilopa, Naropa, Mar pa, and Mi la ras pa, and that these early works then have been supplemented by Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub with an additional, larger hagiography on Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen himself. 1.1 DK.A.Ka: The Hagiographies of Tai lo and Na ro Written by the Master Sgam po pa (Rje sgam po pa mdzad pa 'i tai lo nii ro 'i rnam thar bzhugs) 7 folios, 1 internal segment, no colophon. Having originally been composed by Rgyal ba khyung tshang ba Ye shes Bia ma (1115-1176), probably after Bsod nams rin chen's death in 1153, this text seems to have been composed some time in the period 1153-1176.

One approach is said to consist in creating a cause for Awakening,533 which is identified with the (Common Mahayana) Vehicle of the Perfections (pha rol du phyin pa'i th eg pa, *piiramitiiyiina) taught by Ati5a (jo bo rj e lha cig). The other approach consists in considering the qualities of Awakening to be immanent in all beings,534 which is identified with the Vajra Vehicle (rdo rj e theg pa, *vajrayiina) transmitted by the Indian Tantric master Na ro pa. The text thus begins by placing the hagiographies of Ti lo pa and Naro pa in contradistinction to the Bka' gdams tradition of Ati5a, thereby referencing both the major traditions from within which Bsod nams rin chen taught. It is then explained that Buddha [Sakyamuni] appeared in the form of Vajradhara (rdo rj e 'chang) in order to give Vajrayiina teachings to those students who possessed the highest capacities, whereas those of middling or lower capacities were only able to perceive the Buddha in the form of Buddha Sakyamuni giving the teachings of the Praji'fiipiiramitii vehicle. The text states that the later Indian Tantric master Ti lo pa was someone who was able to perceive Vajradhara and upon seeing Vajradhara he then received the Vajrayiina teachings directly from him. The text only provides few details about Ti lo pa. Thereupon, Na ro pa is introduced as Ti lo pa's major disciple and a longer descriptionfollows of how they met and the many hardships that Na ro pa had to undergo in order to become Ti lo pa's student and receive his teachings. It is stated that Na ro pa became Awakened and then went to the Buddhist monastic university Nalanda,535 where he used his magical powers to protect the institution against an attack from a non-Buddhist group. Finally, a few stories are given about how Na ro pa benefited various persons throughmagic and teachings.

It is told how he came to study with 'Brog mi Lots a ba Sakya ye shes ( c. 992/993-1043/1072) and thereafter went to Nepal and India to receive teachings. Mar pa then returned to Tibet, where he taught a number of students, and the text narrates several different short stories of special events that took place in his life during this period. Finally, a few notes are given on Mar pa's main student, Rngog Chos sku rdo rje (l 036-1102), with whom the author of the text, Ye shes Bla ma, is known in his youth to have studied the Hevajratantra.537 The text's story of Mar pa has been translated into French by Cecile DUCHER (2011: 158-160). Thereafter follows the story of Mi la ras pa, whom the author of the text also is known to have met in person while studying with Mi la ras pa's main student Ras chung pa. The narrative briefly tells how Mi la ras pa as a young man learned black magic. It goes on to say that he then met a Rdzags chen teacher named Lha dga', whereupon he came to see Mar pa. He served Mar pa for five years and Rngog Chos sku rdo rje for one year, before he finally was allowed to receive teachings from them. After doing some meditation retreat, he went to visit his ancestral home only to find that it now lay in ruins. He then started a prolonged meditation retreat in the wilderness of the mountains. Since he had nothing else to eat but weeds, his skin acquired a greenish hue. Different stories of his austerities then follow, as well as stories about the magical powers he displayed after the completion of his Buddhist practice. The end of the text provides no independent colophon, given that the original work by Ye shes Bla ma continues with another hagiography, namely that of Bsod nams rin chen, which in tum ends with a proper colophon stating the name of the author. Thus, text DK.A.Kha simply ends by saying: \"I have explained a bit about the actions and good qualities [showing] how master Mi la became realized. \"538 The text's story of Mi la ras pa has been translated into English by Andrew H. QUINT­MAN (2006:280-291).539 QUINTMAN (2006:65) also notes that this Mi la ras pa hagiography served as the basis for a slightly later Mi la ras pa hagiography compiled by Bla ma Zhang g.yu brag pa Brtson 'grus grags (1123-1193).540 As noted above, the Sgam po pa hagio-536 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.7b4-12b3, DK.B.Kha.1.1 b1-6b1, DK.P.Kha.1 .9bs-15h DK.Q.Kha. l .8b4-l2b4, DK.R.Kha.1. lb1-l0bs, DK.D.Kha. 1.1 b1-7a3, DK.S.Kha. l. lb1-l lbs, DK.T.Kha. 1 pp. 14-516.

The story goes that once upon time -uncountableaeons ago when human lifespans were incredibly long - a Buddha named \"King Arisen like a Pure Jewel-Lotus-Moon\" (Ratnapadmacandravi§uddhiibhyudgatarajan) appeared in theworld and turned the wheel of the Dharma for the benefit of countless sentient beings. At first, many practiced his Dharma with great diligence and attained liberation and realization.Gradually, however, during the reign of King Suradatta, people stopped practicing, theDharma transmission was broken, and much suffering arose. At that time, the bodhisattvaSupu�pacandra, who was a Dharma reciter (dharmabhiiftaka), lived in the solitude of a forest, practicing meditation together with a band of other practitioners. Realizing what hadhappened, he decided to leave his retreat in order to spread the Dharma again in Suradatta'skingdom.

The entire entourage of the king attended his teachings, including Suradatta's several wives and children. They were all filled with great faith and prostrated themselves in front of the bodhisattva in the royal garden. Suradatta himself, however, had not attended the teachings but happened to come by at one occasion and then witnessed the scene of his court prostrating before the bodhisattva. This made him very an gry and he ordered that the bodhisattva should be arrested and executed. After the court executioner had killed the bodhisattva, many special signs appeared. Notably, the corpse of the bodhisattva emitted a strange light and did not decompose. The king realized that he had made a grave mis take, since the bodhisattva, in fact, was a genuine teacher who possessed the good qualities of Awakening. Suradatta painfully regretted his misdeed and fearing that he would be reborn in hell, he then performed an elaborate funeral ceremony for the bodhisattva. Thereupon, he renounced his kingdom in order to devote the rest of his life to practicing the Dharma. The story ends by Buddha Sakyamuni revealing that he in a former life was that king.

It is told that he was born in Central Tibet (dbus) in the region of Gnyal in the female earth- sheep year (sa mo lug gi lo, viz. 1079 CE). His father's name was Snyi ba Rgyal po and his mother's name was Sho mo Za tshe learn. He had two brothers, an older and a younger. Before obtaining his monastic name Bsod nams rin chen, he was called Ngar ma grags as well as Snying po kun dga'. As a young man, he married a woman named 'Tshims jo sras and was educated in medicine (gso ba rig pa). One day his wife passed away, which led him to take up ordination as a monk. He went to Dbrongs kha in Dags po and received ordination from Dge shes Mar yul Blo ldan shes rab in 1104 CE at the Western age of 25 (Tibetan age 26). He was given the monastic name Bsod nams rin chen. The next part of the narrative (DK.A.Ga.2.19b4-2lb2) tells the story of how he studied with various Bka' gdams pa masters. From Dge shes Mar yul Bio ldan he received many teachings on the Father and Mother Tantras. The teacher of this Dge shes is said to have been a student of Mi la ras pa. At this time, Bsod nams rin chen started having many profound meditation experiences and was able to stay in meditation without break for a whole week. Under Dge shes Zangs dkar ba, he became learned in yoga, the Cakrasamvara practices, the Vinaya rules, as well as in various Tantras and their practices. He then went to Central Tibet (dbu ru) to receive further teachings. There he stayed with Dge bshes Snyug rum for seven months. At this time, he gave rise to the relative resolve for Awakening (bodhicitta) without ever losing it again. He went Lcags ri gong khar for seven months and received all the teachings of Atifa from Dge shes lcags ri ba. He also received many other meditation instructions and did the Dharma protector (chos skyong, *dharmapiila) practice of Mahiikiila wielding a curved knife (mgon po gri gug ma, *kartarf dhiira-mahiikiila). 554 He then heard about the famous Dge shes Rgya Yon bdag and went to see him. Again, he received all the teachings of Atifa from him as well. In particular, he studied Atifa' s teachings on the stages of the path (lam rim, *miirgakrama) and practiced the associated contemplations, which made his previous meditation experiences of bliss and clarity decrease. Instead he started to feel a stronger sense of weariness (skyo shas) with sm71siira and a strong wish for renunciation. He stayed with Rgya Yon bdag for three years and practiced intensively. It is said that during this time he had many special dreams, such as riding an elephant, riding a lion, climbing up on a Dharma throne, reaching the top of a stilpa, etc., which are mentioned in the Dasabhilmikasiltra as indications of having accomplished the bodhisattva levels (sa, *bhitmi) in former lives.

Thereupon, the text narrates the story of his search for and encounter with Mi la re pa (DK.A.2.Ga.21 b2-24a2). In the springtime, he emerged from his meditation retreat and went out to the southern slope of Mt. Lcags ri to sit in the sun and regain strength. There he accidentally met three old beggars, one of whom happened to mention the king of yogfs, Mi la ras pa. When he heard this name, he felt very excited, the hair on his body stood on end, and he spontaneously got tears in his eyes. Having inquired about Mi la ras pa from the beggars, he was told that Mi la ras pa stayed in the Mang yul gung thang area in southern Tibet. Bsod nams rin chen set out to meet the yogf, which took him on a long journey. On the way, he encountered some students of Mi la ras pa, who told him that Mi la ras pa had predicted his coming. This made him a bit proud and when he approached the place where Mi la ras pa was staying at the time, Mi la ras pa consequently had his student Se ban Ras pa send Bsod nams rin chen off to stay alone in a cave in the vicinity. Half a month passed by before he was allowed to see Mi la ras pa. The hagiography's next part (DK.A.Ga.2.24ar26b3) is concerned with the time Bsod nams rin chen spent training under Mi la ras pa. When the two of them met, Mi la ras pa recognized him as a future holder of his Dharma lineage. A longer series of songs, dialogues, and auspicious dreams are narrated. Mi la ras pa and Bsod nams rin chen then set off together to Chu 'bar cave in southern Dingri,555 where the two of them stayed alone. In 1109-1110, Bsod nams rin chen remained thirteen months with Mi la ras pa while practi­cing the master's secret meditation instructions, in particular the yoga of Inner Heat (gtum mo). The text here gives a detailed account of the visions, dreams, and meditation experi­ences that Bsod nams rin chen had during this time along with descriptions of Mi la ras pa's response to each of them, often in the form of spiritual songs. After his stay with Mi la ras pa, it is told (DK.A.Ga.2.26b3_7) that Bsod nams rin chen returned to Central Tibet (dbus) to meet again with his former Bka' gdams pa teachers. They all inquired in detail about the meditation experiences and achievements that Bsod nams rin chen had achieved during his training with the yogf Mi la ras pa. They all became very impressed with his progress and Bla ma Snyug rum pa bestowed a White Tara empowerment on Bsod nams rin chen to ens ure him a long lifespan, since he saw him as destined to benefit many sentient beings.556 555 Chu 'bar cave is located at the mouth of the very remote Man lung valley (at the foot of Mt. Jobo Garu, Man lung rtse), south of Dingri (Tingri County), in southern-most Tibet, just north of the Nepalese border. It is about 40 kilometers west of Mount Everest. Mi la ras pa is said to have passed away in this cave some years later. 556 It may be added it was through this empowerment that the Jo bo lugs of the White Tiirii (sgrol dkar) practice, stemming from the Indian master Atifa (lo bo rj e), entered the Bka' brgyud tradition, being the main transmission for the longevity goddess White Tiirii. Other minor transmissions for the deity include the Rngog lugs, the Ba ri lugs, the Gnyan lugs, and the Nags rin lugs, though the Rngog lugs and the Jo bo lugs are considered inseparable.

One of these experiences concerns a encounter he had with a man, who told him some depressing things. Afterwards, nams rin chen prayed to Mi la ras pa and perceived him in a vision. At that point, •vUUL\".-;'tion of Mahiimudrii was born within him and a series of dreams and songs are then revealing the meaning of his realization. In one such dre am, he received the advice to and stay at Mount Sgam po, since its local mountain deity (rtsang po) speaking as a \"\"''\"\"'1'promises to protect him and his followers if he settles there. Thereupon, it is told (DK.A.Ga.2.42b1-S la1) that Bsod nams rin chen traveled to Sgam po in the Dags po region, where he established a small retreat place, viz. Dags Iha sgam po. Ras sgom Ras pa, a fellow disciple of Mi la ras pa, came to stay with him Gradually, a number of students begin to arrive, who stayed at the mountain hermitage order to learn yoga and meditation from Bsod nams rin chen , who had by then become teacher in his own right. The text mentions Dge shes Rgyal ba khyung tshang can, Dge Gnyan nag, Snyags dmar po, and several others, until sixty students had gathered around him. Many of these disciples were monks of the Bka' gdams order. It is told how he gave them meditation instructions and then sent them into retreats. A series of songs and episodes involving the display of miraculous powers is also narrated. The final narrative part of the hagiography (DK.A.2.Ga.5 la1-58b6) tells the story Bsod nams rin chen's death and funeral . At the age of 74, Bsod nams rin chen began to physically unwell and predicted to his students that he soon was going to pass away. The text portrays the last series of teachings and advice that he imparted to his followers, in the form of a series of spiritual songs. In the female water-bird year (cliu mo bya lo}, 1153 CE, he then passed away. His students, led by Bsod nams rin chen's elder nephew official lineage-holder Slob dpon Sgom pa (i.e., Dags po Tshul khrims snying po) arranged elaborate offering ceremonies to be performed in front of his corpse in the large temple (lha khang chen mo) and many special signs appeared. Several of the students had special visions and experienced states of deep meditation. The corpse was cremated and the remains placed inside a newly built stupa. A group of meditators (bsgom chen) arrived too late at the hermitage to participate in the cremation. At their urging, Phag mo gru pa sang them an elaborate song describing how the master died and the auspicious omens that appeared during the cremation.

Dags po'i bka' 'bum: Teachings to the Gathering (Tshogs chos) Following the three hagiographies presented above, ms DK.A of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum continues with a series of five texts in the genre of Teachings to the Gathering (tshogs chos). These comprise texts Nga to Nya. Each text ends with a colophon describing the text's authorship and, according the. information provided there, Bsod nams rin chen did not write these works himself. Rather, they are explicitly stated to be notes (zin bris) t aken by his students based on Bsod nams rin chen's oral lectures (gsung or gsung sgros). The notes were then compiled and perhaps edited to some extent by the authors. Each text is relatively uniform in its language and style, indicating that the respective text was written by a single hand. The works consist of a number of individual lectures, which are demarcated by standard prefatory phrases inserted into the text at the beginning of each lecture. Such a prefatory phrase is, for example, \"Again, the Dharma master Sgam po pa said ... \" (yang chos rje sgam po pa 'i zhal nas). The end of the given lecture is marked by a short closing word or phrase, such as \"[thus he] said\" (gsung).558 These demarcations make it possible to distinguish distinct segments in the works, which in the works' colophons are referred to as \"teaching sessions\" or, more literally, \"Dharma sessions\" (chos thun). As a literary genre, a Teaching to the Assembly (tshogs chos) is thus a cycle of one or more oral teachings (chos, *dharma) presumably given to a larger audience, i.e., a 'community', an 'assembly', or a 'gathering' (tshogs, *gal}a). The contents of the text suggest that the gathering mainly consisted of monks, because the teachings occasionally empha­size topics or explanations that would seem most suited to such listeners, e.g., the study of Vinaya. Hence, the word 'gathering' does not necessarily imply that the lectures were fully 'public' in the broadest sense of the word. The Tshogs chos texts found in Dags po'i bka ' 'bum are the earliest extant and perhaps the original Tibetan works of this genre. The genre continued to be used especially within the Bka' brgyud school as well as in the Bka' gdams tradition until the early fourteenth century, whereafter it went out of use. In total, there are thirty-three known works belong­ing to the tshogs chos genre found in various corpora. These works contain oral teachings of nine different bla mas. The last known specimen is a tshogs chos attributed to 0 rgyan pa Rin chen dpal (1229/30-1309).559 For the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um, the tshogs chos texts are particularly significant in terms of how their compilers chose to arrange the individual teachings on different topics, which may or may not reflect the manner in which Bsod nams rin chen himself arranged the topics 558 As discussed above in the context of the corpus' Zhus Ian texts, the closing phrase 'said' is mostly written using the present tense form in Tibetan (gsung) rather than in the perfective or past tense (gsungs). See fn. 152. 559 A full historical survey of the Ts hogs chos genre has previously been presented by the author in a still unpublished paper entitled \"Tsokcho: Emergence of a New Genre in 121h Century Tibetan Buddhism.\" The paper was read at the University of Virginia in 2007 and again at Geumgang University in 2008."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 217 of his lectures. This is a complex issue that fundamentally relates to the problem of the texts' historical accuracy and reliability in reflecting what the original verbal author, Bsod nams rin chen, may be believed to have spoken, thereby illustrating the problem of the oral authorship of 'sayings' (gsung) that pervades almost the entire corpus. In terms of the tshogs chos texts in particular, these five works are noteworthy with regard to the manner in which they blend Common Mahayana topics with Tantric and/or Mahamudrii explanations. In fact, it is the tshogs chos that give the clearest expression to the so-called 'blending' ('dres) of teachings, which may have served as the basis for the reputation that Bsod nams rin chen gained in later Tibetan literature for having \"merged the two streams of Bka' gdams pa and Mahamudra\" (bka' phyag chu bo gnyis 'dres).560 The Teachings to the Gathering texts of this corpus typically begin with a series of religious motivational talks covering such topics as the precious human life, impermanence, the value of kindness and compassion, etc. In the middle of the cycles, the lectures mostly concern the meditative approaches of Vajrayana and Mahiimudra. At the end, they usually conclude by again stressing impermanence and the like, possibly in order to urge the importance of immediately practicing the teachings that were given. These texts do not contain very concrete meditation instructions, but rather seem to be lectures of more general character intended for a larger audience rather than reflecting a smaller private setting suitable for imparting detailed instructions. Since several of the texts deal with the importance of monastic life and put emphasis on the male set of vows, the intended audience is likely to have been Dags lha sgam po's own community of monks rather than outside lay-followers of either gender visiting the community. The texts provide an impression of how Bsod nams rin chen and especially the students, who actually wrote and compiled the texts, combined teachings belonging to different doctrinal layers of Buddhism. They are therefore important when attempting to evaluate the context of Mahiimudrii teachings in the early Bka' brgyud traditions. Hitherto, David P. JACKSON (1994:14-37) is one of the few academic scholars to have written more exten­sively on these teaching cycles. In his study on Sa skya Pai:i\"hta's Mahamudrii critique, he refers to three of the tshogs chos texts (Ca, Cha, and Nya) in a discussion of how Bsod nams rin chen separated Si\"\"i tra, Tantra, and Mahamudra. Moreover, several passages from the Tshogs chos texts concerned with the three sets of vows (sdom gsum) have been studied and translated by Jan-Ulrich SOBISCH (2002: 177-215). 2. 4 DK.A.Nga: The Teaching to the Gathering entitled Profusion of Good Fortune (Ts hogs chos bkra shis phun ts hogs bzhugs so) 12 folios, nine internal segments, one colophon.

It is explained that this path was taught in Tibet by Atifa in his treatiseentitled Budhipatlzapradzpa (Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma).564 It is then said that later theseteachings were promulgated by the so-called \"three brethren\" (sku mched gsum), referringto the early Tibetan Bka' gdams pa teachers Po to ba Rin ch en gs al (1027 I I 031-1105), Spyan snga ba Tshul khrims 'bar (1038-1103), and Phu chung ba Gzhon nu rgyal mtshan(1031-1106). The three brethren laid out Atifa's teachings in a system referred to as \"thethree persons\" (skyes bu gsum, *tripuru0a), consisting of those of small, middling, or greataptitude (dbang po rah 'bring gsum). The small person (skyes bu chung ngu) is said to feel apprehensive of the suffering oflower rebirths in sartisiira, obtains teachings from a bla ma, takes refuge and the associatedvows of the Refuge, contemplates the suffering of existence, learns about action and result, builds up beneficence (bsod nams, *p w1ya), and thereby gains higher rebirth in sa1?1siira as a god or a human being. He may also become a lay practitioner (dge bsnyen, *upasaka), 565 who after taking Refuge receives the four basic lay vows along with the fifth vow of abstaining from alcohol. He refrains from the ten negative actions and performs the ten positive actions. The middle person (skyes bu 'bring) takes Refuge, becomes ordained as a novice monk, observes the ten monastic novice vows, studies the Prabhiivatl commentary of the Vinaya and the shortcomings of SaJ?isiira.566 He may also become a fully ordained monk, who observes 253 disciplinary vows. The best person (skyes bu mchog) takes the special Mahiiyiina form of Refuge, engen­ders the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta) and takes the bodhi-561 For the colophon and its translation, see the summary of segment DK.A.Nga.9 below. 562 Correlated passages: DK.cx.Ka.67a3-68a5, DK.B.Nga.1.lb1-2b7, DK.D.Nga. l.lb1-3a1, DK.P.Nga. l .86b4-87b1, DK.Q.Nga. l .74b5-75bs, DK.R.Nga. l .lb1-3b4, DK.S.Nga. l. lb1-3bs, DK.T.Nga.l pp. 13-]34. 563 The text's distinction of these two paths has been cited by David P.

The segment ends with a few additional explanations on the Buddhist Refuge laying out how the Refuge is a basis for all other vows, which actions of cruelty cause a lapse from the discipline of the Refuge, and which action may entirely terminate the Refuge.

It ends (DK.A.Nga.2.4a1): /de bas na bsod nams bsags pa gal che gsung ngo//.568 The segment begins by stressing the need for now putting the teachings one has received into practice, since life is short. It also says that for practicing, one does not need many teachings. If one has turned the mind away from this life, practicing even on the basis of a single four-syllable Dharma verse would suffice. Next, the segment emphasizes the need for developing faith in the Buddha, his teachings, and the sangha of practitioners, and taking Refuge. Then one has to find an authentic \"spiritual friend\" (dge ba 'i bshes gnyen or in brief dge bshes, *kalyii.!iamitra), i.e., a bla ma (*guru) or 'teacher'. To illustrate the need for relying on a skillful and knowledge­able spiritual teacher, the text gives a comparison of having to find a skilful physician and getting a proper diagnosis when one is ill. In this context, the segment mentions some basic points of Tibetan medicine, such as the three humors of air, bile, and phlegm and how these humors are derived from the three afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, *klefo). It also gives a short list of different forms of medical treatments, including acupuncture (thur ma), bloodletting (gtar kha), cauterization (me btsa'), administering a laxative (bshal ba) or emetic (skyug), and prescribing various kinds of medicine. A slightly longer explanation of the characteristics that a genuine teacher ought to possess follows, describing these in a variety of ways. As for the Dhanna that needs to be practiced, the segment explains this briefly in terms of creating a cause for Awakening by building up (bsag pa, *smJ1bhrta) beneficence (bsod nams, *p w:iya) and purifying (sbyong ba, *sodhana) negative actions (sdig pa, *papa). The segment ends by clarifying that the co-emergent quality (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja) of one's own mind as such (rang gi sems nyid, *svacittata) is, in fact, not created by these causes of Dhanna practice, but instead the practice of building up beneficence through cultivating kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening create the necessary conditions for realizing this innate quality. The teaching concludes that it therefore is of great importance to build up beneficence.

It begins by listing five practices and their benefits, namely the contemplationof death, the contemplation of the shortcomings of SaT?ISiira, the contemplation of actio n and result, the cultivation of kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening, and meditation on the profound teaching of emptiness. Each of these practices is said to bringliberation from a certain undesirable state. Thereupon, the segment lists five benefits thatcome from contemplating death, such as engendering firm spiritual diligence, and it is saidthat the best practitioner develops these benefits and the quality of non-attachment within a single day of contemplation, the middling person within a month, while the practitionerwith the lowest aptitude reaches this result within a year.

It is said that this nature may assume either of two forms: when it is perceived and is ascertained (snang ba la nges pa), and when it is perceived without being [fully] ascertained (snang la ma nges pa). The first aspect refers to the stage when the practitioner has realized the non-dual nature of the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittatii) and is without hope for Buddhahood and fear of SaT?Isiira. The second aspect refers to the stage in which the practitioner is still attempting to realize this nature by relying on meditation and the nature then begins to emerge within the meditation in the form of meditative experiences (nyams myong, *anubhava or *anubMiti). These are the meditative experiences of bliss (bde ba, *iinanda or *sukha), presence (gsal ba, *vyakta or *p rakiifo), and non-thought or non-conceptuality (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa), which are experiences associated with the practice of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *Samatha).

The segment then turns to an explanation concerning the Tantric practice of the Genera­tion Stage (bskyed rims, *utpattikrama) of meditating on a personal deity (yi dam lha, *i�_tadevatii). This explanation is also found in a parallel passage with only minor variants in a different part of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum (segment DK.A.La.2.3b5-4b1). It is clarified how visualization of the nw!u/ala of the deity brings about meditative experiences of radiance ('ad gsal, *p rabhiisvara) and non-di straction (ma yengs pa), followed by actual realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha). The ensuing passage provides a brief explanation of the Generation Stage and the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim, *sampannakrama or *utpannakrama) with their direct vision of radiance. The Tantric stages of inner accomplishment, which are related to the yoga practices of the Completion Stage, such as Inner Heat (gtum mo) and so forth, are laid out in some detail.

These are said to be twofold: human and non-human troublemakers and the troublemaker of thought. The segment then presents three methods for dispelling these, namely through kindness and compassion, through meditating on emptiness, and through knowing that they are merely manifestations of delusion, i.e., projections of one's own mind. The segment ends by discussing the particular obstacle of gaining a large following and obtaining wealth. In the Secret Mantra tradition, this is said to be a mundane spiritual accomplishment (dngos grub, *siddhi), but it may also be a troublemaker depending on whether or not harmful states, such as attachment and aversion, arise in the practitioner due to these factors.

The act of cutting through delusion is illustrated by an analogy of an infant who is a human being but who does not yet possess the strength of an adult,57 6 an analogy of seeing a shadow that looks like a lion but is not, and an analogy of unreal strands of hair appearing to someone suffering from cataract.

JACKSON (1994:30 fn. 71) has cited this segment's use of the infant analogy, where the segment says \"an infant is still a person though it does not have the strength of an adult\" (byis pa chung ngu de mi yin yang mi tshad ldan stabs ldan ma yin pas byis pa chung ngu'i dp e ... ). He matched this up to a passage in text DK.A.Tha.16, wherein a saying is attributed to Mi la ras pa, which belittles Rdzags chen practitioners by comparing them to little five-year-old boys who claim to have the power of twenty-five-year-old men. JACKSON argued that these two comparisons to children are opposite analogies. However, it may be argued the present segment's use of an infant­analogy does not necessarily contradict the supposed Mi la ras pa saying in text DK.A.Tha. When the present infant-analogy is considered in its complete form given in the text, it is evident that the non-figurative, literal meaning of both comparata (upamana) is that children are not as strong as adult men and that they therefore are not opposed comparisons."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 223 tions (snang ba, *avabhiisa) and the mind (sems, *citta) is illustrated with analogies of water and ice and of sandalwood and its fragrance. The way in which dhannakiiya permeates all perceptions is illustrated by analogies of gold and silver nuggets, and of milk and butter. Illusory perceptions are illustrated with analogies of smoke, clouds, mist, mirror reflections, and echoes. The way in which perceptions arise due to the coming together of various causes is explained with reference to a mirror reflection, the reflection of the moon in water, and [reflections] in a precious gem. The method for realizing the nature of the mind is said to be the empowerment and blessing of an authentic bla ma, followed by practice of the meditations taught by him. These practices give rise to the three meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non­thought. The winds enter the central channel, producing experiences of bodily lightness and bliss. Phenomena are realized to be birthless. Two different quotations are given to illustrate the meaning of 'birthless' (skye med, *nirjata or *anutpanna), namely a passage from a song by Mi la ras pa and a verse attributed to Atifa. The explanations given here on the empty nature of phenomena employ several technical terms from Buddhist doctrine, such as non-analytic cessation (so sor brtags min gyi 'gog pa, *apratism71khyiinirodha), yogic direct perception (rnal 'byor mngon sum, *yogzpratyak�a), and signlessness (mtshan ma med pa, *animitta), thereby imbuing the segment with a doctrinally more sophisticated feel in comparison to the other segments of the text. The segment points out the mind to be devoid of beginning, middle, or end. It compares the mind to space and refers to it as Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po). Thereupon shifting its terminology to words more closely associated with the corpus' Mahiimudrii explanations, the segment next introduces the fundamental state of the natural mind (tha mal gyi shes pa, *p rakrtajiiiina) as being free of meditation involving the duality of something being meditated upon and someone meditating. It declares the absence of anything to be meditated upon (bsgom du med pa) to be the highest form of meditation (bsgom pa'i mchog). The direct perception of the emptiness of the naturally pure mind (rang bzhin gyis dag pa'i sems kyi stong nyid) is called dharmakiiya (chos sku). Dhar­makiiya is stated to be present even when it has not yet been realized. This is compared to the new moon, an infant, or a lion cub, meaning that the new moon is as much the moon as the full moon is, even if it does not yet shine, etc. Next, the segment gives explanations on how to rest in this nature in an uncontrived manner, again and again gaining certainty about the object of this experience, producing a sense of being present without there being any separate perceiver (gsal la 'dzin pa med pa). The meditation thereby becomes free from arising and ceasing (skye 'jig bra! ba), present at all times (dus thams cad pa, *siirvakiilika), uninterrupted (rgyun chad med pa, *avi-chinna), unchanging (mi 'gyur ba, *drr/,ha or *avicala), and all-pervading (thams cad khyab pa, *sarvaspara�ia or *sarvavyiipya). This is the vision of ultimate reality, which -Bsod nams rin chen adds -he is not going to ask anyone about. The last part of the segment explains how to enter into such Mahiimudrii meditation at the beginning of the session, how to sustain it in the middle of the session, and how to end"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"224 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um the session. It also states that practicing in this way will lead to experiencing incessant bl is s devoid of corruption and the attainment of the ascetic quality of shaking everything off (sbyangs pa'i yon tan, *dlnitagu(ia).577 The segment ends with a short colophon declaring: \"This was master Sgam po pa's teaching entitled Accomplishing the Realization of the Union of Method and Jnsight. \"578 It is uncertain how much of the preceding text, i.e., how many segments, should be taken as being contained under this title; perhaps the title only refers to segment seven. Segment DK.AoNga.8: The segment begins (DK.A.Nga.8.8b2): !/yang chos rj e sgam po pa'i zhal nas/ rnam pa thams cad mkhyen pa'i sangs rgyas thob par byed pa la! sdom pa gsum dang ldan dgos gsung!. It ends (DK.A.Nga.8.1 la3): rgyud sdom pa gsum dang ldan par bya gsung//.579 Segment eight contains another lengthy discussion of the three sets ofvows (sdom gsum).580 It opens by giving an authoritative scriptural quotation of four verses from the Vajrasekharatantra (rgyud rdo rj e rtse mo), which lays out the three sets of vows, viz. the Priitimok�a vows of a lay practitioner or a monk, the bodhisattva vows, and the vows of a knowledge-holder (rig 'dzin, *vidyiidhara). The latter set of vows refers to the commitments (dam tshig, *samaya) of the Vajrayiina. The quoted passage ends by declaring the internal hierarchy between the three sets by saying that the first two sets of vows should be considered to be the support for the third set of vows or, alternatively, that they may be regarded as being implicitly contained within the third set of vows. SOBISCH (2002: 185-186) has identified the quotation with a passage in the mentioned Tantra scripture (Ql 13.225a5_s/D480.199b3_5), but it is evident that there are numerous variant readings between the scripture and the version of the text cited here. In fact, it would rather seem that the actual source of the passage of the present segment is a quotation of the same Ta ntra passage given in a work by the Kashmirian Aciirya Lak�rnlkara (11th century), namely the Vajrayanacaturda§amuliipattivrtti (D2485.101 bs-6), a work specifically concerned with the Tantric vows. The extent and Tibetan wording of the quotation in that and the present text is nearly the same. Further, Lak�mlkara's work is directly mentioned in segment 6 of the present text (DK.A.Nga.6) as a treatise to be studied for learning the Tantric observances. 577 Dhlltagwy,a (also spelled dhutagui:ia) is a technical term used in Buddhist literature to refer to a number of ascetic practices of thorough renunciation. These practices are usually associated with fravakas and citing them here may bring in a yogic connotation to the term. For a study of the dhuta­gu!ws, see DANTINNE (1991). 578 DK.A.Nga.7.8b2: thabs dang shes rab zung du 'jug pa'i rtogs pa sgrub ces bya ba rj e sgam po pa'i chos lags so. 579 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.74a4-76b5, DK.B.Nga.8.8brl la3, DK.D.Nga.8.8b5-l lb3, DK.P.Nga.8.94b3-97b6, DK.Q.Nga.8.81 a3-83b1, DK.R.Nga.8.1 3a3-l 7h DK.S.Nga.8.14b3-l 9b4, DK.T.Nga.8 pp. 6w835. 580 The segment has been discussed at length by SOBISCH (2002: 185-194 ), who refers to it as work A."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 225 After quoting the Tantra, the segment presents each of the three sets of vows in some detail with reference to the practitioner who takes them, the ritual through which they are received, and their proper observance. Thereupon, the essence of the three sets of vows is briefly stated by paraphrasing explanations generally attributed to two other Tantric scriptures, namely the VairocanabhismJibodhitantra (Q126/D494) and the [pakinf]-vajra­paiijaratantra (Ql l/D419). Next, the segment raises a series of questions concerning how it may be possible to observe all three sets of vows simultaneously without internal conflict. A similar series of questions formed the structure of the discussion of the three sets of vows in segment DK.A.Nga.6. It is explained that the three sets of vows clearly are distinct sets which are received on separate ritual occasions, which are broken by different improper actions, which are based in different notions of the nature of the person who receives them, which are doctrinally presented as possessing different substantial natures, and which operate differently in terms of how they may be given back. Nevertheless, the three sets of vows should not be regarded as being wholly separate, because they involve numerous overlaps in their disciplines and in such cases it is not possible to say which of the levels of the vows is operating in the given situation. Thus, they are distinct yet merged, which is here compared to the old Indian anecdote that although water and milk may be mixed and merge into one, a goose is nevertheless capable of extracting and drinking the milk out of the water. In terms of their observance, the segment advices that they should be upheld as gene­rally prescribed, but if any vow were to become an obstacle for one's life by causing illness, were to pose an obstacle for the two other sets of vows, or were to pose a hindrance for further spiritual progress, then there would be no fault in not observing that particular vow. Further, it is advised that. one should keep the vows progressively, so that a higher vow would override a lower vow in a case of internal conflict, e.g., the bodhisattva vow would rank higher than a Pratimok�a vow. It may be remarked here that the explanations found in this segment on the hierarchy of vows may be highly significant for understanding in general how the monks of the Dags Iha sgam po community attempted to combine their monkhood with Tantric practice and it is notable that the issue was sufficiently important to be directly addressed in the present segment as well as in segment DK.A.Nga.6 of the corpus. It is also to be remarked that these passages constitute some of the very earliest discussions of the three sets of vows in Tibetan literature. Having treated the internal hierarchy of the vows, the segment then goes over how a vow may be restored if it has been violated or broken. The manner of restoring vows differs for the different levels of practice. The segment also discusses how more emphasis should be put on the outer Pratimok�a vows during the daytime while being in public or being in the company of Sra vakas, whereas more emphasis should be put on the Secret Mantra commitments when being in private at night. The segment also states directly that an accomplished practitioner incurs no fault in undertaking higher Tantric levels of practice, such as relying on a female consort for practicing the sexual levels of the Tantric yogas."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"226 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum ����������������������������������� Yet, no reference whatsoever is here given to Ati5a's prohibition in the Bodhipathapradfpa for ordained practitioners to engage in the higher Tantric practices. Finally, the segment admonishes that the practitioner must always weigh internal con­flicts between the different sets of vows in terms of the gravity of the action involved. Someone striving for the highest Awakening should keep all three sets of vows. Segment DK.A.Nga.9: The segment begins (DK.A.Nga.9. l la3): //yang rj e sgam po pa'i zhal nas/ spyir phyag rgya chen po la dbye ba med kyang/. It ends (DK.A.Nga.9.12a6): de 'i phyir nyam nga ba dang bag tsha ba thams cad chos nyid kyi ngang du mthong gsung/ chos1je sgam po pa'i gsung la/ nye gnas sho sgom byang yes zin bris su mdzad pal bdag gisphyogs gcig tu sgrigs pa'o/I l/c hos thun dgu yod// dge 'o// bkra shis so//.581 The finalsegment of the text returns to the topic of Mahamudra. It is said that Mahamudrii generallyis without divisions, but in order to enable yogis to comprehend its meaning, a twofolddivision is presented: the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja­cittatii) and the co-emergent perceptions (snang ba lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajiivabhasa). The co-emergent mind as such is dhannakiiya (chos sku), while the co-emergentperceptions are the radiance of dharmakiiya (chos sku'i 'ad, *dharmakiiyiiloka or *dharma­kiiyaprakiifa) or the 'light' of dharmakiiya. The co-emergent mind as such refers to theuncontrived, unidentifiable nature of the mind, which is like space, embracing everythingbut having no color or shape of its own. The co-emergent perceptions are a wave of self­arisen realization, which penetrates all the different positive, negative, and neutral thoughts that pass by. The question is then raised whether these two aspects are identical or different. Someone without realization would regard them as being different, but someone who has become realized by relying on the instructions of a genuine bla ma would see them as being identical . This is illustrated through three analogies: sandalwood and its fragrance, which permeates the whole vicinity but never stops being sandalwood; the sun and its shine, which though radiating never stops being the sun; and water and waves, which though moving never stop being water. Likewise, the co-emergent perceptions never stop being the co-emergent mind as such. Next, the segment gives three explanations on how to generate realization. The first is to understand that from a source, which is not anything in itself, a multiplicity emerges. The second is to understand that although it emerges as a multiplicity, it is not any object at all. The third is to understand that when it has been realized as it really is, its non-duality cannot be expressed in words. It is stated that these instructions pertain to the relationship between the co-emergent mind as such and the co-emergent perceptions. Further, the segment gives three instructions on how to implement these teachings into a meditation practice. It is said: At the beginning of a meditation session, relax the body and mind by letting go of effort. In the middle of the session, ease into the uncontrived state by 581 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.76b5-78a1, DK.B.Nga.9.l la3-l2a6, DK.D.Nga.9.1 lb3-l3a 2, DK.P.Nga.9.97b6-99a1, DK.Q.Nga.9.83br85a3, DK.R.Nga.9. l 7b3-l9h DK.S.Nga.9.19b4-22a4, DK.T.Nga.9 pp. 8wl03."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 227 letting go of hesitation. At the end of the session, regard all thoughts about physical sensations to be birthless. Finally, three reinforcing instructions are given for sealing the realization. The first is to understand that the co-emergent exists within every sentient being and also within oneself, and for this reason one does not have to seek it from others. The second is that the great bliss that removes suffering, dharmakiiya, is simply one's own awareness, and for this reason it is not to be found outside. The third is that all perceived outer phenomena are nothing but one's own mind, and for this reason fear is completely unnecessary and all distress and anxiety may be left behind. The segment ends with a general colophon for whole text Nga, saying: \"[These] notes of sayings by the Dharma master Sgam po pa taken by his attendant Sho sgom Byang Ye were compiled by me.

The final colophon of this second Tshogs chos work in the corpus states that the text was written as notes of Sgam po pa's words by his student and attendant Sgom pa Legs mdzes (dates unknown) without adding or removing any words.583 The treatise is by far the longest of the five Teachings to the Assembly texts in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum. It is also notably different from the other texts of this genre, given that the present text includes numerous scriptural quotations from sutras, the works of the Indian Mahiisiddha Saraha, Santideva's Mahiiyiina classic Bodhicaryiiva­tiira, and many other sources. In fact, the text is the first among just three works in the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum that account for 78% of all the ca. 1.412 quotations found throughout the forty works of the corpus; these three quotation-rich texts include DK.A.Ca, DK.A.E (Dags po thar rgyan), and DK.A.Varµ (Bstan bcos lung gi nyi 'od).584 Text DK.A.Ca also makes frequent use of more technical terminology known from Buddhist philosophical and epistemological treatises. The work consequently has a much more literary character than the other tshogs chos texts. It is notable that through its frequent use of quotations and writing style, it is the only work in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum that comes somewhat closer in style to the work traditionally thought to be the magnus op us of Sgam po pa, namely the Jewel Ornament of Liberation (Dags po thar rgyan, DK.A.E) . Finally, it should be noted that the present work repeatedly quotes lines from an un­named and still unidentified text that seems to serve as a root text (rtsa ba, *mula) for this 582 DK.A.Nga.9.12a5_6: chos rj e sgam po pa'i gsung la/ nye gnas sho sgom byang yes zin bris su mdzad pal bdag gis phyogs gcig tu sgrigs pa'o// //chos thun dgu yod!! dge'o// bkra shis sol/. 583 For a full translation of the colophon, see the summary of segment DK.A.Ca.21 below. 584 See KRAGH (2013b:l 337- 1 379)."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"tshogs chos. It is unclear whether these lines are drawn from an independent treatise or whether they function as mnemonic lines or verses (sdom tshig, *uddiina) internal to thetext in order to capture key points of meaning. Segment DK.A.Ca.1: The segment begins (Dk.A.Ca.1.1 b1): In a mo gu rul bla ma rin che'i zhal nas/ 'o skol da lta thob par dka ' ba'i mi lus rin po che thob/. It ends(DK.A.Ca. l .2b3): des na da res thun mong gi gdams ngag rin po che 'i gter kha phyed pa lta bu 'i gdam ngag 'di ston no//. 585 The first segment of the treatise is written as an introductory preface. It ends (DK.A. l .2b3) by stating that the following segments will teach the instructions (gdam ngag, *avaviida)586 needed for attaining accomplishment and it com­pares this to \"opening the treasure of the precious common instructions\" (thun mong gi gdam ngag rin po che'i gter kha phyed pa lta bu). It is notable that the segment thereby identifies the teachings to be given in the work as being 'common' (thun mong, *siidlui,ra!w), i.e., generally shared by all practitioners of the Buddhist paths, thus setting these about from an implicit, supposedly different set of 'uncommon' (*thun mong ma yin pa, *asiidhiira�ia) instructions that would be secret and exclusive to inner, higher practices. The word 'common' (thun mong), on the one hand, is in various other contexts often employed for referring to teachings that are general for the whole Mahiiyiina tradition (e.g., the explanations on the bodhisattva attitude) and sometimes also inclusive of the Hfnayiina tradition (e.g., the contemplations of death and impermanence). The phrase 'uncommon' (*thun mong ma yin pa), on the other hand, is often employed to designate secret yoga instructions of the Vajrayiina tradition. Hence, it might be deduced from the use of the phrase 'common' that the present texts place particular emphasis on the Mahiiyiina instruc­tions that Bsod nams rin chen received from his Bka' gdams pa teachers rather than on the Tantric and Mahiimudrii instructions that he obtained from Mi la ras pa. The prefatory segment begins by pointing out that the practitioner has now attained a precious human rebirth (mi !us rin chen) which is difficult to gain and that the practitioner has encountered the teachings of the Buddha, which are hard to come by. What needs to be done now is to enter the door (sgo) of these teachings and thereafter gain experience in their practices (nyams su Zen). The segment then states that there are several different entrances to these teachings and goes on to distinguish the Sriivakayiina (nyan thos kyi theg pa), the Pratyekabuddhayana (rang sangs rgyas kyi theg pa), and the Mahayana (theg pa chen po). It is emphasized that the following explanations all belong to the Mahayana. Thereupon, the segment presents a brief doxography of various Mahayana doctrinal or textual traditions (gzhung lugs). It mentions two different traditions of the Mind Only 585 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka,78ar 78b5, DK.B.Ca.1.1 b1-2b2, DK.D.Ca.1.1 b1-2b4, DK.P.Ca. l .99b1-lOObi, DK.Q.Ca. l .85a4-85b7, DK.R.Ca.1.1 b1 -3bi, DK.S.Ca.1.1 b1-3b2, DK.T.Ca. l pp. h-ln. 586 On the meaning of avavada and its fundamental significance in the Buddhist meditative path according to the Bodhisattvabhum i book of the large Indian contemplative treatise Yogaciirabhiimi, see ARAMAKI (2000:40-46 and 2013).

The mentioned philosophical distinction of whether the mental images of perception (rnam pa, *akara) are real (rnam pa bden pa, *satyakara or *sakara) or false (rnam pa rdzun pa, *alfkakara) is a division found in the late Indian Yogacnra-vijfianavada or Cittamntra tradition, which was known to the early Tibetan traditions particularly through the Yognciira-Madhyamaka treatise Madhyamakalm?1kiira by Santarak�ita. 587 The latter is, however, not a source that is explicitly referred to anywhere in the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um. The s egment also mentions two different textual traditions (gzhung lugs) of the Madhyamaka school (dbu ma), namely \"the illusion-metaphor\" tradition (sgyu ma lta bu, *mayopamii) and \"the non-abiding\" tradition (rab tu mi gnas pa, *aprati�_thiina).588 It further distin­guishes two sub-traditions of the latter strand, viz. \"the non-abiding union\" tradition (zung 'jug rab tu mi gnas pa) and \"the non-abiding cut stream\" tradition (rgyun chad rab tu mi gnas pa). For the Secret Mantra tradition (gsang sngags), the segment distinguishes the old Tantras (rnying ma), the outer and inner Tantras (phyi pa dang nang pa), and the Father and Mother Tantras (pha rgyud dang ma rgyud). Finally, it sums up all these distinctions in the form of the two broad traditions it calls \"the accumulation path of the perfections\" (pha rol tu phyin pa tshogs kyi lam, *p aramitiism?ibhiiramiirga) and \"the method path of Secret Mantra\" (gsang sngags thabs kyi lam, *g uhyamantropayamarga).589 Evidently, the mention of all these distinctions of textual traditions and Tantric sub-streams reflect what must have been well-known parts of common religious study and practice curricular in twelfth-century Tibet. Next, the segment makes a few general remarks concerning the method path of Secret Mantra. It is stressed that this path is fundamentally a path of blessing (byin rlabs kyi lam pa), the success of which depends on entering into the blessing of the teacher (bla ma'i byin rlabs zhugs pa). This is illustrated through an analogy of a great treasure buried beneath the house of a poor man, who will remain poor until the treasure has been found and opened. The treasure is said to be the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajacittata) and its opening is achieved by entering the teacher's blessing. Consequently, the segment ends with the above-cited statement that the following instructions are like \"opening the treasure of the precious common instructions.\" The segment has no colophon. 587 For some details, see ICHIGO (1989:182-183). It may be noted that these designations do not agree with the labels employed by Kamalaslla and Ratnakarasanti; see SEYFORT RUEGG (1981:58 fn. 172). 588 These designations are known from Advayavajra's (i.e., MaitrTpa's) Ta ttvaratniivall as well as from the eighth-century Tibetan treatise Lta ba'i rim pa'i man ngag by Dpal brtsegs; see SEYFORT RUEGG (1981:58-59 fn. 174). 589 The doxographic part of the segment has been presented in schematic form by JACKSON (1994: 15-16)."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"230 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum Segment DK.A.Ca.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Ca.2.2b2): In a mo gu ru/ thun mong gi gdam ngag rin po che'i gter kha 'byed pa lta bu'i gdam ngag 'di la don bzhi ste/.

These explanations are supported by a quotation from the Hevajra­tantra. To sum up the qualifications of a proper teacher, the segment presents necessary quali­ties: having the instructions of an uninterrupted transmission lineage (brgyud pa'i bka ' ma chad pa), being good-natured and compassionate (ngang tshul bzang la thugs rj e che ba), and being a person worthy of devotion (gus pa skye ba 'i rten du rung ba). The segment elaborates these qualifications in some detail. The explanations given here of the trans mis­sion lineage distinguishes between the \"red guidance\" (dmar khrid) of an oral transmission (snyan brgyud), which is a transmission of meditative experience (nyams kyi brgyud pa), and the \"black guidance\" (nag khrid), which is the transmission of the (written) teachings (bka 'i brgyud pa). The term \"red guidance\" (dmar khrid) thus signifies the practical instruction given by a meditation master, and it is a phrase that appears elsewhere in the corpus, e.g., in the title of the yoga instruction text DK.A.Ba. Conversely, the rarer term \"black guidance\" seems to designate the ability to explain the teachings of written texts, with the color black possibly referring to the black ink of the letters. As for relying on a teacher who is worthy of devotion, the segment stresses the need forletting go of inner arrogant attitudes (dman pa'i blo spangs) of thinking of the teacher as being inferior and instead to regard him as being an actual Buddha. It is said that it is only with such genuine conviction that the practitioner will truly be able to enter the blessing and thereby give rise to spiritual realization. The segment here gives a series of instructions on how to foster devotion (gus pa, *gaurava or *satkrtya or *bhakti). The passage includes quotations from the Cakrasm7ivaratantra and other unnamed Tantric works. It also refers to the stories of the Indian Tantric masters Tilopa and Nampa, Sahara (bram ze chen po) and Nagarjuna, and Bhadrapada (bzang po'i zhabs) and Kotali (tog rtse ba). The segment ends with a longer passage discussing two kinds of devotion. The first is an artificially cultivated form of devotion (bsgom pa'i mos gus) felt by the beginner practitioner, which is fickle and easily lost if the practitioner sees or hears of a flaw in the teacher.

Finally, it is revealed that the inner meaning of devotion is not directed towards an outer person, but that the teacher represents one's own mind. On a deeper level, devotion is thus an act of the mind praying to the mind itself, thereby purifying itself within the state of the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittatii), fulfilling the verbalized wishes and thereby becoming infused with blessing. The segment has no colophon. It may be noted that the latter part of the segment follows a structure of quoting a root text (rtsa ba) in verse form and commenting on it in prose with several interspersed notes (mchan bu).

The segment then enters into a detailed discussion of what differences there are between a sentient being (sems can, *sattva) and a buddha (sangs rgyas). The discus­sion unfolds by presenting three general modes in which things might be said to be different (tha dad pa, *bhinna), viz. (1) being different substantive entities (dngos po tha dad pa, *bhinnabhiiva or *bhinnavastu), (2) being different by excluding one another (gcig pa bkag pa 'i tha dad pa, *ekaprati�iddha), and (3) being different in the sense of sharing the same nature but forming different features (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha dad pa, *ekarupa-bhinnavyatireka). These distinctions -which are known from the Inda-Tibetan epistemological tradition (tshad ma, *p ramii1:1a) -are then briefly explained with examples, and it is concluded that the distinction between sentient beings and buddhas belongs to the third category . That is to say, sentient beings and buddhas have similar natures, given that they are equal in pertaining to the mind (se1ns, *citta), but they are different in terms whether or not they have realized the birthless nature of the mind as such (sems nyid skye ba med pa'i don). The declaration that sentient beings and buddhas are fundamentally the same but that the naturally pure mind (sems nyid rang bzhin gyis rnam par dag pa) is obscured in the case of sentient beings is supported in the segment through quotations from the canonical texts *Atyayajiiiinasutra592 and the Hevajratantra. In order to realize the birthless nature of the mind, sentient beings have to purify the temporary stains that cover this nature and for doing so a method (thabs, *upiiya) is needed. 591 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.80br83a3, DK.B.Ca.3.4br7a1, DK.D.Ca.3.4b3-7�, DK.P.Ca.3.102b5-105b4, DK.Q.Ca.3.87bs-90as, DK.R.Ca.3.6b3-10bs, DK.S.Ca.3.7ar 12a1, DK.T.Ca.3 pp. 3w516-592 'Da' ka ye shes (D122)."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"232 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um To this end, the segment announces that it is going to teach an instruction (gdam ngag, *avaviida)593 which is comparable to the sound of a piwang (pi wang, *pavang), a classi cal Tibetan stringed fiddle instrument, which is somewhat similar to the Indian veena (vfnii). It is said that the comparison means that the sound of the piwang is not produced by any single element of the instrument, such as the strings, the instrument's body acting as a sound box, or the efforts of the musician to play the in strument, but it is the combination of all these elements acting together that produces the sound. Similarly, the achievement of nirvii1:1a is accomplished by uniting spiritual methods (thabs, *upiiya) -in particular the cultivation of kindness (byams pa, *maitrl), compassion (snying rj e, *karu!iii), and the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta) -with the development of insight (shes rab, *p rajffri), through which the practitioner realizes the profound emptiness (zab mo stong pa nyid, *gambhfrasilnyatii) of all phenomena. By bringing together these two facets in his or her practice, the practitioner can purify the obscurations (sgrib pa, *iivara1:1a) along with their tenacious tendencies (bag chags, *viisanii) and hereby end up achieving the non-abiding nirvii!W (mi gnas pa'i mya ngan las 'das pa, *aprati�fhita­nirvii!ia). Following this introduction, the segment proceeds to impart a concrete contemplative instruction consisting of four points (don bzhi). Each point is presented in the form of a short root text prose-sentence (rtsa ba) followed by an explanatory note (mchan bu). The first point is the necessity of adopting (khyer) the understanding that smrzsiira ('khor ba) has the nature of suffering (sdug bsngal gyi rang bzhin, *du(ikhasvabhiiva or *du�khariipa). Such understanding is needed for turning the mind away from smJisiira ('khor ba la blo ldog pa) and to achieve this view the segment teaches a twofold contemplation of the shortcomings of smJisara ('khor ba 'i nyes dmigs bsgom pa, *smJisiiriidfnavabhavanii). The involved contemplations are focused on suffering in the various forms of smJisiiric rebirth as well as on the basic suffering found in the life of a human being. The second point is the necessity of adopting this understanding of suffering as a spiritual path (sdug bsngal lam du khyer). It is by contemplating the suffering endured by others that the Mahiiyiina practi­tioner is able to generate compassion and the relative resolve for Awakening. Pragmaticallyspeaking, the passage also stresses the need for relating to personal hardships as an incentive to practice, considering them as reminders for striving on the path of renunciation. This is compared to the story of how the Buddhas manifest a golden drum in the heavenly realms to remind the gods, whose lives are filled with celestial pleasur es, of the smJisiiric impermanence of all temporal happiness. The segment then instructs the practitioner how to complete the development of kindness and compassion to the extent that these attitudes are felt towards all and anyone, whereupon the practitioner is told to contemplate the inborn empty nature of compassion, suffering, and the mind, and to relax into a state that is free of concepts. This constitutes the third point, namely the importance of achieving freedom from states of mind that cling to the path as being a real entity possessing definable 593 Gdam ngag occurs frequently in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum as a Tibetan orthographic variant of gdams ngag.

The illusion­like nature of things that is thereby realized is spelled out in the segment with quotations from the Siltra literature, such as the Sm?icayagathii Praj fiiiparamitii scripture (Sdud pa). The ultimate result is the attainment of dharmakiiya, which is the instruction's fourth and final point, namely the recognition that dharmakiiya (chos kyi sku) is nothing but freedom from the conceptual mind (blo bra! de ka). The segment also stresses that benefit for others flows spontaneously from this state. It is pointed out that this is what is called non­referential compassion (dmigs pa med pa'i snying rj e, *niralambanakant(iii), which techni­cally constitutes what is called \"naming a result by its cause\" (don la rgyu'i ming 'bras bu la sbyar te btags pa).

It ends (DK.A.Ca.4.9b2): da blo bral gyi don de dang bra! ha med par nyams su blang gsung ngo//.594 Similar to the third segment and many of the segments that follow, segment four commences by summing up all the teachings of the Buddha and then stating what is considered their essential point. Here, the Buddha's teachings are subsumed under the categories of the three baskets of the Buddha's words (bka ' sde snod rin po che rnam pa gsum, *tripi[aka) and the four Tantra classes (rgyud sde rin po che rnam pa bzhi), along with the commentaries ( 'grel pa, *vrtti) and instructions (gdam ngag, *avavada). Their key meaning (brjod bya) is presented as being aimed at revealing the nature (gnas lugs sam yin lugs) of cause and effect (rgyu 'bras, *hetuphala), particularly the teaching on dependent arising (rten cing 'brel bar 'byung ha, tp ratftyasamutpada). It is added that the purpose of this teaching is to give understanding of what is to be practiced and what is to be renounced (blang dor). The teachings on cause and effect pertain to saryisara ('khor ha) as well as to nirva!ia (mya ngag las 'das pa). The segment explains the details thereof at length, pointing out the causes for sm?isara being the five mental poisons (dug lnga, *paiicavi�ab) and the results being rebirth in the six sm?isaric states of rebirth ('gro ha, *gati). Nirva!la is considered twofold, viz. the nirvii!ia of peace (zhi ha mya ngan las 'das pa, *santanirva!ia) attained by Hinayana followers and the non-abiding nirvii!ia (mi gnas pa'i mya ngag las 'das pa, *aprati�_thitanirva!la) strived for by Mahayana bodhisattvas. The causes for the first kind of nirva!ia primarily include realization of the selflessness (bdag med pa, *nairiitmya) of the individual and partially also of phenomena, and secondarily the perfection of the twelve ascetic practices (sbyangs pa'i yon tan, *dhutagu!la or *dhutagu!1a).595 The causes for the non-abiding nirvii!la are complete realization of the selflessness of the individual and of all phenomena, as well as the perfection of the four bases for gathering students (bsdu ba 'i 594 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.83a3-86a2, DK.B.Ca.4.7a1-9b2, DK.P.Ca.4.105b4-l08b6, DK.Q.Ca.4.90a5-93a1, DK.R.Ca.4.10bs-15as, DK.T.Ca.4pp. 5w723. 595 See fn. 577.

The remaining part of the segment provides an instruction (gdam ngag, concerned with these processes of cause and effect. The teaching is compared to a rice seedling (s 'a lu lj ang pa, *salistambha), in the sense that a particular kind of seed incon­trovertibly yields a given type of plant and no other; e.g., a rice seed generates a rice and not a buck weed sprout. The instruction again consists of four points (don bzhi), whosepresentation is structured around brief root text sentences (rtsa ba) and explanatory notes (mchan bu). The first point is to contemplate how past actions function as causes (snga ma'i rgyu 'bras kyi las). The second point is to understand how present experiences of happinessand suffering (phyi ma bde sdug) are the outcomes of past actions. Herewith, the practi­tioner should recognize the unfailing principle of action and result and as a strive to practice good actions and avoid harmful actions. At this point, the segment discusses whether beneficial actions have the power to purify baneful actions, arguing that it is possible through doing beneficial actions to purify and terminate the seeds (sa ban, *bija) of negative actions that are stored in the latent consciousness (kun gzhi, *alaya[vijnana]), but it is not possible to purify and avoid results of negative actions that have already ripened (rnam smin, *vipaka). The third point of the instruction is to view all workings of causality of SaJ?ISiira and nirvii�1a as constituting dependent arising (rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba, *p ratltyasamutpada) and consequently as being empty (stong pa, *sunya) of inherent existence. By realizing the true nature, all causes of actions and effects of deluded experiences are automatically purified, because every action has been performed by one's own mind and every experience it produces does not exist apart from the mind, When the mind is realized as not existing with any fixed identity, there is no longer any duality of good and bad and thus no duality of good or bad actions. Everything is under\" stood as being one's own mind (rang gi sems su thag chod pa) and it is realized that the mind is dhannakaya, free of any defining trait, like the center of the sky. This leads to the fourth and final point of the instruction, which says that such understanding brings about a state beyond thoughts (blo las 'das pa'i dbyings), meaning that the practitioner through these steps of practice can reach a level that is free of thoughts (blo bral) and without hope and fear.

Looking down upon and disparaging a tenet system (grub mtha', *siddhilnta), such as the *Sravakayana (nyan thos kyi theg pa) or the *Pratyekabuddha­yana (rang sangs rgyas kyi theg pa), is paramount to the very serious negative action of abandoning the Dharma (chos spong gi las). The segment then turns to the Great Vehicle (theg pa chen po, *mahayana), said to constitute the highest path (lam mchog, *paramamarga) for the person who possesses the Mahayana predisposition (theg pa chen po'i rigs, *mahayanagotra). A key feature of the Mahayana is here said to be the view (lta ba, *d!:j[i) of profound selflessness (bdag med pa, *nairatmya) and accordingly the segment proceeds to teach a fourfold instruction (gdam ngag, *avavada) on a progressive meditation on the meaning of selflessness (bdag med pa 'i don rim gyis bsgom pa). The segment compares this instruction to the manner in which a series of signs are conveyed to a deceased queen (rgyal po'i btsun mo shi ba la brda rim gyis sp rod pa).599 The segment provides no explanation of what is meant by this compari­son and its meaning is consequently unclear. The first point is a series of contemplations on the equality of oneself and others (bdag gzhan mnyam pa bsgom pa) in terms of that everyone wishes to find happiness and avoid suffering. The second is a meditation on that it is selfish behavior (rang don byas pa) that causes suffering, whereas the sublime qualities found in buddhas and bodhisattvas (buddha dang bo dhi sa tva'i yon tan phun sum tshogs pa) stem from acting for the benefit of others. Having thus identified the root of suffering to be the tendency to cherish oneself (bdag gees par 'dzin), the practitioner must resolve henceforth to act only in ways devoted to others' wellbeing, particularly by striving to attain buddhahood. The third point is to meditate on that the self is unestablished as a real entity (bdag ma grub par bsgom pa). This is achieved by analyzing the five aggregates (phung po, *skandha), body and mind identification, and the transitory and unidentifiable nature of past, future and present instants of consciousness (shes pa skad cig ma mi rtag pa). The fourth and final point is a meditation on the unestablished, empty nature of both self and other, freeing oneself from any dualistic thought of being and non-being (yod pa dang med pa la sags pa 'i blo thams cad dang bral 598 The term yana is generally taken as meaning 'vehicle' in the later Buddhist traditions, but VETTER (2001 :62-67) has argued that it may first have been employed in early Buddhist Mahayana texts in the sense of 'path', 'way' or 'road'. A yana is literally something on which or by which one moves (from the verb ya \"to move, to go\"), which accordingly may either be interpreted as a road that carries a traveler or as a vehicle, such as a chariot or cart, that transports the traveler. 599 Alternatively, the phrase htsun mo shi ha could be interpreted as being a proper noun, \"Queen Shi ba,\" rather than taking shi ha as an adjectival past particple (\"deceased\") of the verb 'chi ha, in which case the comparison might refer to a particular story.

Here two broad categories are mentioned: the Dharma of the transmission (lung gi chos, *iigamadhanna) and the Dharma of realization (rtogs pa'i clws, *adhigamadharma). The former is explained as what has come down ('ongs pa, *iigama) via earlier generations through a lineage (brgyud, *p aramparii), referring to the words heard from earlier masters (bla ma gong ma rnams las thos pa'i tshig), preserved in memory, and then taught to suitable students of the following generations. The latter category designates the realization (mngon par rtogs pa, *abhisamaya) born in the mind of a practitioner by transforming the received words of the teachings into personal experience through practicing in solitude in a cave (phug dben pa) in the wilderness. In view of this, the question is raised as to how the Dharma can be put into personal experience to make it one's own (nyams su Zen, *svfkaroti). It is recommended that the practitioner first relies on a genuine teacher (bla ma dam pa, *sadguru) in order to study and understand the Dharma of the transmission. Not being content with mere learning, the practitioner should then go to a place of solitary retreat (dben pa, *p riivivekya) in the wilderness (ri khrod, *vana or '\"parvatakandara) or in an isolated hermitage (dgon pa, *iirmJya) to meditate on and cultivate (bsgom, *bhiivanii) what has been learnt and understood during the preceding period of study. The meditation practice of cultivation (sgom pa, *bhiivanii) is focused on following the path (lam, *miirga) consisting of the methods (thabs, *upiiya) of kindness (hymns pa, *maitrl), compassion (snying rj e, *karwJii), the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta), along with the meaning of profound emptiness or selflessness of all phenomena (chos thams cad kyi zab mo stong pa nyid bdag med pa'i don, *sarvadharmagambhfrasilnyatiinairiitmyiirtha). The cultivation should, moreover, develop the supportive aids for the path (lam gyi cha rkyen), namely faith (dad pa, *§raddlui) and drive or perseverance (brtson 'grus, *vfrya). Faith ensures that the practitioner, to begin with, will enter the path and not be consumed by doubt, while drive safeguards that he or she will foster development, given that the spiritual practice is not being postponed. The segment here provides a short explanation on faith and drive, discussing the faith of openness (dang ba'i dad pa, *adhimuktafraddhii), the faith of aspiration ('dod pa'i dad pa, *abhipriiyafraddhii), and the faith of conviction (yid ches pa'i dad pa, *iiptafraddhii), along with the armor-like drive (go cha'i brtson 'grus, *smJmiihavfrya), the drive of engagement (sbyor ba'i brtson 'grus, *p rayogavfrya), and 60° Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.88b3 -91�, DK.B.Ca.6.12a1-14h DK.D.Ca.6.12b5-15b4, DK.P.Ca.6.111 bs-114b6, DK.Q.Ca.6.95ar98a3, DK.R.Ca.6. l 9br24a2, DK.S.Ca.6.22ar27�, DK.T.Ca.6 pp. 93rl2s. --"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 237 insatiable drive (chog mi shes pa'i brtson 'grus, *asa17itu�,tavfrya) in relation to Dharma practice. To avoid distractions (g.yeng ba, *vik�epa) and the tendency that the body and speech return to their ordinary patterns of behavior (lus ngag tha mal du song ba), the practitioner is advised to cultivate understanding of the difficulty in acquiring (myed dka' ba, *sudurlabha) opportune circumstances (dal 'byor, *k�wiasampad) in the form of a precious human rebirth (mi lus rin po che) and awareness of death and impermanence ('chi ba mi rtag pa, *marm:ianitya).

The segment ends with another fourfold instruction (gdam ngag, *avavada), which is compared to hitting a good horse with a horsewhip (rta bzang po la lcag gis brabs pa !ta bu). The first point is to contemplate the difficulty in acquiring a human rebirth (mi !us myed par dka '). Here the practitioner reflects on how rare it is to find rebirth as a human being. Secondly, he should deliberate how difficult it is -among human existences -to gain a life that has the necessary leisure (dal ba phun sum tshogs pa) and right opportunities ('byor pa phun sum tshogs pa) for practicing the Buddha's teachings. He must realize how inopportune other forms of sar(lsaric rebirth ('gro ba rigs, *gati) are for practicing the Dharma and how difficult it is to encounter the Dharma. The passage explains the ten resources ('byor pa bcu) needed for Dharma practice. The third contemplation concerns the inevitability of death. Finally, the practitioner is instructed to develop kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening by thinking of the suffering of sentient beings who consider their present lives lasting and strive for mundane happiness in spite of its fleeting nature, and, further, by examining the deeper nature of momentariness in order to realize its emptiness and lack of any independent existence in each moment.

It also underlines the unavoidable coming of death and the need for practicing the Dharma right now from the heart (snying nas chos byed pa). To this end, the practitioner has to gain a thorough understanding of the proper characteristics (mtshan nyid, *lak�al}a) of all things, because without understanding that the nature of all things is merely phantom-like (sgyu ma'i skyes bu !ta bu) the practitioner runs the risk of his or her spiritual practice (dge sbyor, *.frama�ia) turning into a superficial appearance (!tar snang, *iibhiisa). The remainder of the segment teaches a fourfold instruction (gdam ngag, *avaviida) concerned with employing the character [of phenomena] as the path (mtshan nyid lam du 'khyer ha). To begin with, the character or nature of four types of phenomena is briefly presented. These include: (1) understanding all conditioned phenomena ('dus byas, *sa1Jiskrta) as being impermanent (mi rtag pa, *anitya); (2) understanding all causes and effects (rgyu 'bras, *hetuphala) as being dependently arisen (rten cing 'brel par 'byung ha, *p ratftyasamutpiida); (3) understanding that all sentient beings have been one's parents (pha ma) in former lives and that they all undergo all sorts of suffering; and (4) understand­ing that all experienced phenomena (snang grags kyi chos) are unborn in nature, which is dharmakaya. It is here explained that without acquiring these four modes of understanding, the spiritual practice will run the risk of becoming superficial respectively by being hijacked by mundane thoughts, by not properly observing the required conduct, by attempts to benefit others being ineffectual, or by trying to be without attachment and clinging while lacking the insight into phenomena that actually is truly needed in order to maintain such attitudes. To accomplish such understanding of the character or nature of things, the segment next presents four meditative contemplations. One is the contemplation of death and imperma­nence ('chi ha mi rtag pa sgom pa), which should be carried out at the beginning of every practice session, because it causes the mind to tum fully away from the doings and actions of this life (tshe 'di 'i bya byed dam las) and gives rise to a feeling of having no needs (dgos med kyi blo, *ni�prayojana). Having firmly engendered such a state of mind, it is said that it is impossible that the practitioner's Dharma will not follow the path (chos lam du mi 'gro ha shes bya la mi srid) and accordingly the spiritual practice (dge sbyor, *.framal}a) is bound to be authentic (mtshan nyid pa, *lak�al}ika). Another is the contemplation of the causes and results of actions (las rgyu 'bras, *karmahetuphala), which will ensure a pure conduct (tshul khrims rnam par dag pa, *vi§uddha1Ji §flam), in particular an authentic (mtshan nyid pa) conduct of renunciation (nges par 'byung ba'i tshul khrims, *nai�kramya§fla). 603 Sanskrit edition by VAIDYA (1960:4) : k�a!iaSaf!ipad iyaf!i sudurlabhii pratilabdlza puru�artha­sadhanfl yadi natra vicintyate hitaf!1 punar samagama(1 kuta(z!I."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 239 Thirdly, the segment teaches the importance of giving rise to genuine attitudes of kind­ness (hymns pa, *maitrf), compassion (snying rj e, *karu!1d), and the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi se1ns, *bodhicitta), without which any action attempted for the benefit of others (gzhan don, zparahita) would remain superficial. Finally, the practitioner is instructed how to meditate on the emptiness (stong pa nyid kyi don, *§unyatartha) of all phenomena during the phase of meditative absorption (mnyam bzhag, *samahita), resulting in understanding all experiences (snang ba, *avabhasa) encountered in the post-meditative phase of ensuing attainment (rjes thob, *P!�fhalabdha or *anuprapta) as being illusion-like (sgyu ma, *maya). By joining the phases of meditation and post-meditation in this manner, the practitioner ensures that the cultivated attitudes of non-attachment and non-clinging (chags zhen med pa, *vairagya) do not remain superficial. The final sentences of the segment compare self-clinging (bdag 'dzin, *atmagriiha) to a tight knot (mdud pa dam po) existing deep within, which prevents one from turning to the path (lam du mi 'gro ). The authentic path (lam mtshan nyid pa, *lak�a(iikamarga) consists in untying this knot and thereby becoming free from the bondage of taking things as being real (bden 'dzin, *satyagriiha). This leads to an inner state characterized by non-attachment (zhen chags med pa, *vairagya), being without hope for results ('bras bu la re ba med pa), and independence (ltos pa med pa, *apek�d). The segment has no colophon.

Here it is said that there are 84.000 afflictive states (nyon mongs pa, *kle§a) in the mind-streams (rgyud, *santana) of sentient beings and the Buddha therefore taught 84.000 entrances to his teachings (chos kyi sgo mo, *dharmamukha) to serve as remedies (gnyen po, *p ratipak�a) against these afflictions. Further, the segment says that the 84.000 entrances to the Dharma can be summed up the three vehicles (theg pa gsum, *triyana), namely the vehicle for fravakas, the vehicle for pratyekabuddhas, and the Great Vehicle for bodhisattvas. It is then stated that the present segment only will teach the Great Vehicle. The Mahayana includes instructions on the view (lta ba, *dr�.ti) and meditation (sgom pa, *bhiivana), which pertain to the definitive meaning (nges don, *nztiirtha), and instruc­tions on the right conduct or behavior (spyod pa, *carya), which pertain to the expedient meaning (drang don, *neyartha). To be strongly motivated to use these instructions, the practitioner must make the best possible use of the present human rebirth with its unique circumstances for practicing, given that death is certain to come soon.

Thereupon, the segment turns to pres enting a fourfold instruction (gdam ngag, *avavada), which it compares to a wish-fulfilling gem (yid bzhin gyi nor bu rin po che !tabu). The first is the contemplation of the difficulty in obtaining a free and endowed rebirth(dal 'byor rnyed dka ' bsgom pa, *sudurlabhak0a!iasampadbhiivanii). The second is theinstructi on on the contemplation of death and impermanence ('chi ba mi rtag pa bsgom pa'i man ngag, *111ara!1iinityabhiivanopade5a). The third is the instruction on the contemplationof the cause and effect of actions (las rgyu 'bras bsgom pa'i man ngag, *karmahetuphala­bhiivanopade5a). The fourth point consists in gaining understanding of the methods of the path (lam thabs shes), namely the methods for cultivating kindness (byams pa, *maitrf), compassion (snying rj e, *kant!lii), the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bo­dhicitta), and insight into the meaning of selflessness and the profound emptiness of all phenomena (shes rab chos thams cad kyi zab mo stong pa nyid bdag med pa'i don). The segment gives a short explanation of each point and includes several quotations from the Bodhicaryiivatiira. The segment has no colophon. It is notable that the fourfold structure of the instructions given in the segment's second half partially agrees with the overall structure of key chapters found in the large treatise The Jewel Ornament of Liberation (Dags po thar rgyan, DK.A.E) . In the latter work, the second chapter is concerned with the freedoms and good circumstances (dal 'byor) of a precious human rebirth, the fourth chapter teaches the contemplation of death and impermanence ('chi ba mi rtag pa), the sixth chapter is concerned with the contemplation of the causes and results of action (las rgyu 'bras), and chapters four to seventeen are generally said to pre­sent the teacher's instructions (gdams ngag, *avaviida) on the methods (thabs, *upiiya) of the Mahayana path. This observation underscores the point that text DK.A.Ca is the only work in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum that is relatively similar in writing style, quotation patterns , and contents to the Dags po thar rgyan. Therefore, a study of the origin and textual history of the Dags po thar rgyan would probably have to take text DK.A.Ca into consideration.

It is then stated that no further remarks will be given on this approach in the present segment. The gradual approach, on the other hand, is said to consist either of the method way (thabs kyi lam, *upayamarga) or the insight way (shes rab kyi lam, *prajiiiimarga). For the method way, the teacher gives three pointing out guidances (ngo sprod) to the student and the student then relies on the experiences of these guidances as the path (lam 'khyer) . The pointing out guidances here consist of the teacher's instruction to see all sentient beings ('gro drug) as one's parents (pha ma) in former lives, which allows the student to give rise to loving kindness or friendliness (hymns pa, *maitrl); secondly, an instruction to recognize all the suffering experienced throughout sm11sara, which enables the student to foster compassion (snying rj e, *karu!1a); and, thirdly, an instruction to understand all causality (rgyu 'bras, *hetuphala) as being dependent arising (rten 'brel, zp ratftyasamutpada), which is needed for engendering the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta). For the insight way, the student first has to find an authentic teacher (bla ma mtshan nyid dang ldan pa zhig) who can introduce (ngo sp rod) perceptions (snang grags) as being dhannakiiya (chos sku). It is stated that without a proper introduc ­tion to the nature of things, it would be impossible for the student ever to realize the meaning of profound emptiness and the unborn nature of all phenomena. The gradual path is practiced by relying on these four introductory guidances and using them as the path. Thereupon, the segment teaches a fourfold in struction (gdam ngag, *avavada), which it compares to showing a poor person that he actually possesses a hidden treasure. The four points are the four introductory guidances (ngo sprod pa) mentioned above in connection with the gradual path. The segment has a pattern of quoting short sentences in verse that function as a root text, which are then commented upon in ensuing prose passages. Detailed explanations are given on how to regard all sentient beings as the parents of one's former lives, the kindness that these parents have previously shown to one, the suffering that all beings undergo throughout the different realms of smJisara, how a bodhisattva aiming to engender the resolve for Awakening should see all causal phenomena as being dependent arising, how the aspiring bodhisattva needs to find an authentic Mahayana teacher, how bodhicitta functions as the basic cause or seed (sa ban, *bfja) for the result of buddhahood, and how all phenomena are empty and unborn in nature and therefore possess the nature of dhannakiiya. The segment gives quotations from the Bodhicaryavatara and the Mahayana­siitralaryikara. It has no colophon. 606 Segment DK.A.Ca.10: The segment begins (DK.A.Ca.10.2 la5): /In a mo gu ru/ bla ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ da lta snyigs ma lnga ni bsngo/.

It is therefore said to be crucial that the practitioner makes the best use possible of the oppor­tunity to practice the Dharma afforded by the present rebirth as a human being. To this end, the segment instructs the listener in the steps needed to be taken for practicing. These include finding an authentic Mahayana teacher and studying the teachings of the Sittras, the Tantras, and the Sastras with him, turning the acquired knowledge into personal understanding by reflecting on the meaning of the words, and turning the ensuing under­standing into personal experience and realization by meditating. The segment compares these step s of a proper spiritual practice (dge sbyor, *.framar:ia) to the steps taken by an ill person to cure a disease by finding a doctor, receiving a diagnosis, taking medication and using other remedies, and so forth. To foster a strong motivation, the practitioner is advised to rely on the contemplation of death and impermanence, the successful practice of which is indicated by the rise of a strong feeling of wanting to turn away from the eight worldly affairs ('jig rten gyi chos brgyad, *a�rau lokadharmab).608 Thereupon, the practitioner should contemplate the detrimental character of sm?isara ('khor ba 'i nyes dmigs, *sm?1sara­dfnava), which produces a strong wish to attain complete buddhahood. The segment then moves on to impart a fourfold instruction (gdam ngag, *avavada), which is compared to a doctor skilled in medicine (sman pa mkhas pa). Here the segment is again laid out in the structure of a root text followed by commentary. The first point is to turn the mind away from this life (tshe 'di), which is achieved by contemplating death and impermanence, contemplating the detrimental character of sm71sara, cultivating the attitudes of kindness, compassion and the resolve for Awakening, and meditating on the profound emptiness of all phenomena. These contemplations are presented in brief in rela­tion to their meditati onal focus (bsgom rgyu, *bhiivayitavya), purpose (dgos pa, '\"p ra­yojana), and measure of success (drod tshad, *matra). These explanations are supported by quotations from the Bodhicaryavatara and the Indian Doha literature. The segment has no colophon.609 Segment DK.A.Ca.11: The segment begins (DK.A.Ca.11. 23a2): na mo gu ru/ bla ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ spyir yang dag par rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas kyis gsungs pa'i chos thams cad kyi brjod bya'i don bsdu na gsum/.

I I) as being examples illustrating how Sgam po pa, when givinggeneral Mahayana teachings, \"stressed the need for preliminary learning and reflection.\""},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 243 du bsgom zhes de la brjod/ ces gsungs so//.610 In the present segment, attention is first given to subsuming the Buddha's teachings under three headings: the perfect goal ('bras bu phun sum tshogs pa) that is to be achieved, the perfect path (lam phun sum tshogs pa) whereby the goal may be reached, and how that goal is to be achieved by practicing this path. The result of the path is, moreover, presented as the attainment of the state of great joy (bde ba chen po'i sku, *mahasukhakaya) wherein the three buddha bodies are equally present (sku gsum ro mnyam pa, *trikayasamarasa). The result is also said to be the three buddha bodies endowed with the five wisdoms (sku gsum ye shes lnga dang ldan pa), and it is, moreover, presented as being the dhannakaya (chos sku) attained for one's own benefit (rang don, *svahita) and the form-kayas (gzugs sku, *nipakaya) manifested for the benefit of others (gzhan don, \"p arahita). To attain this result, the stages of the path are taught as consisting in finding an authentic teacher and receiving the teachings of the Mahayana. The segment ends with another fourfold instruction, which is compared to a ground (gzhi, *iidhara) for developing good qualities. The first part of the instruction presents the qualifications needed in an authentic Mahayana teacher (bla ma mtshan nyid dang ldan pa). The teacher must hold an unbroken teaching transmission, have few desires and be content, possess great compassion, and be endowed with blessing. These qualities are explained in some detail. Having found a qualified teacher, the practitioner then has to study the teachings and understand their meaning, particularly the instructions on the definitive meaning (nges don, *nltartha). This point is supported with a quotation from a text called \" Letter from the Junior Student Meditator of Gtsang\" (gtsang bu sgom chung gi 'phrin yig). The segment here explains at length that perceptions (snang ba, *avabhasa) have not come from anywhere, do not go anywhere, and are not established as real entities in the present moment. Hence, the practitioner should recognize their unborn nature (skye ba med pa). It is said that all experiences are manifestations of the deluded mind (sems 'khrul pa'i snang ba), comparable to the illusory strands of hair that may appear to eyes of someone suffering from cataract. The segment provides several quotations from the Doha literature in this passage. Finally, the meditator must realize that the mind itself is not existent as an identifiable entity (mtshan ma gang du yang grub pa med), but that it is like space (nam mkha' !ta bu). What is all important is then that these understandings are turned into meditative experiences and personal realization by practicing meditation. Hence, the meditator needs to meditate on the object that is free from the conceptual mind (blo bral gyi don bsgom dgos). Thereby, experiences (snang ba, *avabhasa) and their empty nature (stong pa, *sunya) are known to be inseparable (dbyer med du shes par byas), and the meditator becomes able to rest without artificiality (ma bcos par bzhag) in the natural state (gnas lugs kyi ngang), free from any attempt to remove or create something, free from being or not being something (spang blang dang yin min gyi rtsol ba med pa).

The former set of teachings is especially concerned with explaining positive actions (dge ba, *kufola) and negative actions (mi dge ba, *akufola), with knowledge of which the practitioner can avoid negative actions, cultivate the positive ones, and thereby attain higher rebirth as a sarrzsiiric god or human being. The latter set of teachings are those that lead to the three kinds of Awakening (byang chub rnam pa gsum) by following any of the three Buddhist vehicles (theg pa gsum, *triyana). It is then stated that the present segment is going to focus on the teachings of definitive meaning and from among the three vehicles it will only be conc erned with the instructions of the Great Vehicle (theg pa chen po, *mahayana). The instructions (gdam ngag, *avavada) of the Great Vehicle are, moreover, said to be twofold. They may belong to the vehicle of the perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa 'i theg pa, *piiramitayana) or to the result vehicle of secret mantra (gsang sngags 'bras bu'u theg pa, *guhyamantraphalayiina). Again, it is stated that the present segment will only be concerned with the latter approach. The secret mantra result vehicle includes instructions (gdam ngag, *avavada) on the two stages (rim pa, *krama), viz. the Generation Stage (bskyed rim, *utpattikrama) and the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim, *sampannakrama or utpannakrama), and the present segment will only be dealing with the Complete Stage teachings. Moreover, the Complete Stage is said to consist of the instructions (man ngag, *upadefo) of the two practice systems called Rdzogs pa chen po and Phyag rgya chen po (*Mahiimudra), and the instruc­tions (gdam ngag, *avaviida) given here exclusively belong to the Mahiimudra system.612 Mahiimudra is now taught through three notions, namely the immaculate basis (gzhi dri ma med pa, *vimaliidhara), the immacalute way (lam dri ma med pa, *vimalamiirga), and the immaculate result ('bras bu dri ma med pa, *vimalaphala). The immaculate basis is the naturally pure reality as such (chos nyid rang bzhin gyis rnam par dag pa, *p rakrtivisuddha dharmatii). The immaculate way is the method of employing co-emergent knowledge (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes, *sahajajfiiina) as the path (lam du 'khyer ba).

JACKSON (1994: 16-17). JACKSON (1994:30 fn. 70) cited this passage as an example illustrating how Sgam po pa identified Mahiimudrii and Rdzogs chen in their essentials."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 245 is to be completely without separation from the state of inseparable knowledge and reality (dbyings dang ye shes dbyer med pa 'i don dang mi 'bral ha). The segment compares the instruction on these three points to a lotus flower (padma lta bu 'i gdam ngag) and then goes on to teach it in detail. The lotus comparison is used in the sense that a lotus is rooted in dirt and mud, but the flower itself remains immaculate and unstained by dirt; similarly, an immaculate result is realized by relying on this instruction that identifies the co-emergent meaning (lhan cig skyes pa'i don, *sahajartha) in ordinary phenomena. The adjective 'i mmaculate' (dri ma med pa, *vimala) is explained as being without the stains of the c onceptual states of subject and object (gzung 'dzin blo'i dri ma dang bral ba).613 The immaculate basis is the co-emergent nature (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja), which is realized on the immaculate way by employing radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhasvara) as a medi­tation focus. The immaculate result is the attainment of dharmakaya, which too is co­emergent. The co-emergent is clarified by distinguishing an outer (phyi), inner (nang), and secret (gsang) aspect, respectively signifying the nature of sensory perceptions (snang ba, *avabhasa), the nature of the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittata), and the realization of these in the form of non-conceptual knowledge (rnam par mi rtog pa 'i ye shes, *nirvikalpajfiana). Several quotations are given from the Dohas of the Indian master Saraha and some Mahayana Siitras to validate this teaching. In the ensuing experience of daily life (rjes thob spyod pa, *anuprap tacarya), everything is seen as co-emergent wisdom and consequently all experiences of the senses and the inner mind become self-liberated. This is compared to recognizing a familiar person (sngar 'dris kyi mi ngo shes pa). The result is dharmakaya, which is said to mean that the practitioner becomes naturally confident (gding du tshud pa) without entertaining any hopes or fears (re dogs med pa).614 613 The segment here employs the phrase \"Mahomudrii, immaculate openness\" (phyag rgya chen po dri med zang tha[) (DK.Q.Ca.12.109h?, cited by JACKSON as p. 220.7). David P. JACKSON (1992: 101) has argued that Sgam po pa is here \"using terminology apparently borrowed from the rDzogs­chen.\" 6 14 Samten KARMAY (1988: 144 fn. 39) has given a brief reference to this segment (DK.A.Ca.12) in a context where he discussed the Mahiimudrii phrase lhan cig skyes sbyor (*sahajayoga) as explained by the first Pa�i chen bla ma Blo bzang chos kyi rgyal mtshan (1567-1 662). It would seem that KARMA Y simply intended the citation as a general example of just one out of many passages in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum that concern sahaja and not as a specific identification of the term lhan cig skyes sbyor within this particular segment. However, KARMA Y's reference was taken by David P. JACKSON (1994: 11 fn. 19 & 33 fn. 76) as having been intended in a more specific manner and was accordingly criticized by JACKSON for failing to provide any further detail of the term in question. The present segment indeed does actually not use the phrase !hag cig skyes sbyor, although that phrase occurs in numerous other passages of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum. The present segment only uses the term lhan cig skyes pa (*sahaja). In this context, it may be important to note that Lhan cig skyes sbyor (*Sajajayoga) is traditionally used a general name for Sgam po pa's Mahiimudra system, attested in that sense in slightly later Bka' brgyud works. The first Pa�i chen bla ma thus employed the phrase Lhan cig skyes sbyor as a general name for Sgam po pa's teachings without having a specific passage in mind and this is, in fact, made clear in Pai:i chen bla ma's auto-commentary (also"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"246 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum Segment DK.A.Ca.13: The segment begins (DK.A.Ca.13.28a4): In a mo gu ru/ bla ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ skal ldan kun 'klzor ba 'di me dong dang 'dra rtson ra dang 'dral.

Sm71siira leads to nothing but suffering and a method for gaining liberation from sm71siira is therefore needed to purify the delusion ('khrul pa, *bhriinti) that causes sm11siira. A fourfold instruction (gdam ngag, *avaviida) is then given, which is com­pared to a sword (spu gri lta bu) that cuts the root of delusion. Making a distinction between the mode of being (yin lugs) and the mode of abiding (gnas lugs), a key point (gnad, *marman) is identified, saying that confusion is experienced although it is not real (med par snang ba). This means that experience is empty (snang ba nyid stong pa yin), that the energy of emptiness (stong pa nyid kyi rtsal, *silnyatiivyavasiiya) emerges as experi­ence (snang bar shar ba), and that these are non-dual (snang ba dang stong pa gnyis su med pa, *silnyiivabhiisiidvaya). As a consequence, there is also non-duality (gnyis su med pa, *advaya) of sm71sii,ra and nirvii�w, of happiness and suffering (bde sdug), of weaknesses and qualities (skyon dang yon tan), and of what is to be removed and the means for doing so (spang bya dang gnyen po). In order to cultivate this understanding in meditation, the practitioner has to rest in this view of being free from all concepts and any attempt at doing anything. The given explanations are supported by numerous scriptural quotations, e.g.,from a Prajiiiipiiramitii sutra, the Pranui�wvarttika, and the mystical poetry of Saraha.

The path (lam, *marga) consists of abandoning what is to be remo­ved (spang bya spong ba, *parivarjayitavyaparivarjana) and letting the remedy (gnyen po, *'pratipak�a) arise in the practitioner's stream of being (rgyud, *santd na). The result ('bras bu, *phala) is to perfect this process of abandoning and to attain complete knowledge (spang pa dang ye shes mthar phyin pa). What is to be abandoned (spang bya, *parivar­jayitavya), moreover, is divided into that which is to be abandoned on the path of seeing (mthong spangs) and that which is to be abandoned on the path of cultivation (bsgom spang). It is also divided into the afflictive emotions (nyon mongs pa, *kle§a) and concep­tuality (rnam par rtog pa, *vikalpa). The Mahayana path that should be employed to effect the elimination of these states to be abandoned is threefold: the way of abandonment (spong ba 'i lam, *parivarjanamiirga) signifying the Paramitiiyiina, the way of transformation (bsgyur ba'i lam, *pari1:1amamiirga) denoting the Secret Mantrayiina, and an approach dubbed \"taking the original nature as the path by ascertaining the mode of abiding\" (gnas lugs gtan la phab nas gnyug ma lam du khyer pa). This third approach is here given in the form of a teaching called the \"discus-like instruction cutting off all thoughts\" (rnam par rtog pa thams cad gcod par byed pa 'khor lo !ta bu'i gdam ngag). To purify or remove rebirth (skye ba 'dag par byed pa, *janmavifuddhi), the practitioner has to purify action (las 'dag pa, *karmavifuddhi). To purify action, the practitioner has to purify afflictive emotions (nyon mongs pa 'dag pa, *kle§avifuddhi), and to purify those, the practitioner has to purify clinging to experiences as being real (snang ba la bden zhen 'dag dgos). To achieve this, it is necessary achieve insight into the mode of being (yin lugs) and the mode of abiding (gnas lugs) of experiences (snang ba, *avabhasa). Experience or appearances (snang ba) are deluded experiences of the mind (sems kyi 'khrul pa'i snang ba, *cittasya vyiikuliivabhasaf:i), comparable to dreams (mdangs sum gnyid log pa'i rmi lam). Their mode of abiding (gnas lugs, *p rakrti?) is that they abide or exist (gnas pa, sthiti) in the inseparability of experience and emptiness (snang ba dang stong pa gnyis su med par). If this is realized, clinging to experiences as being real stops and this effects the purification or removal of afflictive emotions, karmic actions, and sm!isiiric rebirth. The segment then goes on to give explanations of the mind's mode of being (yin lugs), describing it as not being established as a thing or possessing any fixed traits (dngos po dang mtshan ma gang du yang grub pa med de). Its nature is radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhasvara), which is dharmakiiya (chos kyi sku). The mind abides (gnas pa, *sthiti) in the inseparability of presence and emptiness (gsal stong gnyis su med par). It is inexpres­sible (brjod med, *nirabhiliipya). Knowing this will likewise purify afflictive emotions, actions, and rebirth. It is by never becoming divorced from this state that dha rmakiiya is realized. The teaching of the segment is supported by several quotations from Nagarjuna, Saraha, and a number of Mahayana Sutras.

Three types of relations are distinguished, namely a causal relation (rgyu 'bras kyi 'brel pa, *hetuphalasambandha), a mutually relative relation (phan tshun ltos chos kyi 'brel pa, *apek:jadharmasambandha), and a same-nature relation (bdag nyid gcig pa'i 'brel pa, *ekatmyasambandha). It is then logically argued how come the relation found between a sentient being and buddhahood cannot be a causal relation or a mutually relative relation, and why it has to be a same-nature relation, given that buddhahood logically must exist inherently within every sentient being. It is taught that buddhahood, which is the real nature of the mind, is inexpressible (brjod du med pa, *nirabhilapya) and beyond the intellect (blo las 'das pa). As long as this has not been realized, the mind remains deluded ( 'khrul), which causes dualistic thoughts of experience and subject (gnyis snang dang gnyis 'dzin gyi rtog pa) to emerge as a multipli­city (sna tslwgs su shar ba). To become free from this delusion, the practitioner needs to ascertain the real nature of the mind (gnas lugs kyi don gtan la phab) and cultivate this understanding in meditation (bsgom, *bhavana). The meditation may either involve an object (mtshan bcas, *sanimitta) or it may be without any identifiable object (mtshan med, *nirnimitta or *animitta), but in either case the basic point is to ascertain the mode of being (yin lugs) of the meditative experience and realization (nyams dang rtogs pa). To illuminate the meaning of the mode of being, the segment teaches another fourfold instruction (gdam ngag, *avavada), which it compares to a mirror (me long !ta bu) that clearly reflects this mode, allowing one to see it as vividly as one's own face reflected in the mirror. The first point mentions the two overall types of meditation (sgom pa, *bhavana), namely meditation involving an object (mtshan bead, *sanimitta) and meditation without any object (mtshan med, *nirnimitta). Examples of meditations involving objects include meditations on loving kindness (byams pa, *maitrl), compassion (snying rj e, *karUl:ia), and the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta) up to their advanced level on which these attitudes are practiced in a non-referential manner (mi dmigs pa, *anupalabdhi). Meditations with objects also include the Generation Stage practices (bskyed rim, *utpattikrama) of the Secret Mantra vehicle, along with yogas focused on channels and winds (rtsa dang rlung, *na�ivayu) up to the advanced level of such practices on which the meditator dwells in the unborn nature (skye med, *nirjata). Since these practices all revolve around conditioned phenomena ('dus byas, *sarrzskrta), they can only result in sa111saric outcomes. Hence, the practitioner should ultimately discard these practices and move on to the meditations without identifiable objects. To do so, the blessing (byin rlabs, *adhisthana) of a qualified teacher (bla ma, *guru) is needed, which gives rise to meditative experiences (nyams myong, *anubhava) of bliss, presence, and non-thought (bde gsal mi rtog) or, in 617 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.1 08ar 109b5, DK.B.Ca.15.31 b4-33a1, DK.D.Ca.15.34as-36a6' DK.P.Ca.15.134as-136a6, DK.Q.Ca. 15. l 14brl 16b4, DK.R.Ca.15.50br53b3, DK.S.Ca.15.60a1-63b2, DK.T.Ca.15 pp. 262s-289."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 249 other words, the experience of meditative absorption (sa m'a dhi bzang po, *samadhi). With such experience in hand, the meditator can rely on the teacher's key point instructions (gnad) to ascertain the nature (gnas lugs, *p rakrti?) of inner and outer perceptions (dran snang) and of the space of reality (chos kyi dbyings, *dharmadhatu). The practitioner learns to see both inner states of mind (nang dran pa) as well as outer sensory perceptions (phyi snang ha) as being inseparable from emptiness (stong pa gnyis su med pa). Thereupon, he ascertains (gtan la phebs pa) the nature of the space of reality as being free from any conceptual entanglement (spros pa'i mtha' thams cad dang bral ha). Its nature is unthink­able (bsam gyis mi khyab pa, *acintya) and inexpressible (b1jod du med pa, *nirabhiliipya). The meditative abiding in this space needs to be without artifice and uncontrived (ma bcos pa, *akrtrima) and this is what is called dhannakaya (chos kyi sku).

The latter type includes instructions of expedient meaning pertaining to the gradual path (drang don gyi gdam ngag lam rim gyis pa) and instructions of definitive meaning intended for the instant path (nges pa don gyi gdam ngag lam cig car ha). In this segment, the instructions for the instant path will be presented.619 Four kinds of definitive instructions are then distinguished: (1) instruction on the view (!ta ha 'i gdam ngag, *dr�_tyavavada) aimed at ascertaining the object of knowledge (shes bya gtan la 'bebs pa), (2) instruction on meditation (sgom pa'i gdam ngag, *bhavaniivaviida) dealing with how to put this certainty into practice (de nyid nyams su Zen pa), (3) instruction on conduct (spyod pa'i gdam ngag, *caryiivavada) concerned with blending the meditation with its object (de nyid yul dang bsre ha), and (4) instruction on the result ('bras bu'i gdam ngag, *phaliivaviida) showing how the practitioner has become one with the meaning (de la don gcig tu gyur pa).

JACKSON (1994:34) in order to illustrate his argument that Bsod nams rin chen at times expressed the view that any type of learned exposition (bshad pa, *de§ana) - whether belonging to the Piiramitayana or the Secret Mantrayiina teachings - is inferior to actual meditation instruction (man ngag, *upade§a)."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"250 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum The practitioner who may receive these instructions needs to be a great meditator (sgom chen pa), who is a suitable recipient for such practice (nyams su len pa'i rten gyi gang zag). The view is then explained at some length and is said to be synonymous with understanding the emptiness (stong pa nyid, *siinyata) of all phenomena, a state that is free from all conceptual entanglement (spros pa'i mtha' thams cad dang bral ba). All phenomena are merely experiences of one's own deluded mind (rang sems 'khrul pa'i snang ba) and the mind itself does not exist as a real entity (bden par ma grub). As for meditation, there can be neither meditation nor non-meditation, since everything is empty . Conduct means that there is nothing to be practiced or abandoned. Finally, the result is explained as becoming free of all hope and fear, since one has realized sa171sara and nirva!w as being inseparable, and the accomplished practitioner accordingly neither fears sa1!1sara nor hopes for nirvii!Ja. The segment contains numerous quotations from Mahayana Sutras, Atifa's Bodhipatha­pradzpa, and Saraha's Doha songs.

The saying begins with a motivational piece, urging the audience to strive on the path to liberation and omniscience, given that one has now attained a free and endowed human rebirth and has had the rare fortune to encounter the teachings of a Buddha. The Buddha's teachings are then briefly outlined in the structure ofthe four truths of the noble ones (bden pa bzhi, *catvari satyani) and how the causes and conditions of ignorance (ma rig pa, *avidya), craving (sred pa, *tr.J!Ja) and taking hold of(!en pa, *upadana) lead to three kinds of sa171saric action (las, *karman), namely non­beneficial actions (bsod nams ma yin pa'i las, *apU!JYal!l karma), beneficial actions (bsodnams kyi las, *p U!JYa!Jl karma), and contemplative immovable actions (mi g.yo ba 'i las, *anifijymJi karma). To achieve liberation from smJisiira, it is necessary to practice the path (lam nyams su Zen pa) and to this end there are two types of instructions (gdam ngag, *avavada): (1) instructions concerned with the method (thabs la dmigs pa) belonging to the expedient meaning (drang don) and (2) instructions concerned with insight (shes rab la dmigs pa) belonging to the definitive meaning (nges don). The present segment teaches the instructions concerned with insight, which need to be applied (gnad du thebs pa). The instructions concern non-dichotomy or non-duality (gnyis su med pa, *advaya), explaining four kinds of meditation focused respectively on the none dichotomy of visual perception and emptiness (snang stong gnyis su med pa), the non-di­chotomy of sound/language and emptiness (grags stong gnyis med), the non-dichotomy of taste and emptiness (myong stong gnyis med), and the non-dichotomy of happiness and suffering (bde sdug gnyis med). 62° Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.11 1brl13a5, DK.B.Ca.17.35a4-36b6, DK.D.Ca. l 7.38a6-40as, DK.P.Ca.l 7.138a6-140�, DK.Q.Ca. l 7. l l 8b1-120a3, DK.R.Ca. l 7.56b4-59b1, DK.S.Ca. l 7.67ar70as, DK.T.Ca.17 pp. 2930-31 12."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 251 Segment DK.A.Ca.18: The segment begins (DK.A.Ca.18.36b7): bla ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ spyir theg pa chen po 'i rigs dang ldan pa 'i rten gyi gang zag cig gis/.

These are meditation experiences (nyams myong, *anubhiiva) that occur when the medi­tator practices the way of insight (shes rab kyi lam). First, there is the meditative experience wherein all perceptions or experiences (snang ba, *avabhiisa) are seen as manifestations of one's own mind (sems, *citta). Next, the meditator experiences the mind itself (sems nyid, *cittatii) as being empty (stong pa, *sunya). Finally, the meditator reaches non-dichotomy (gnyis med, *advaya).

The perfected view is said to be the necessary condition for pure meditation, and the practitioner should therefore start by establishing the right view of all phenomena as being inexpressible (brjod du med pa, *nirabhiliipya), unfathomable (bsam gyis mi khyab, *acintya), co-emergent knowledge (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes, *sahajajiiiina). All outer experiences (phyi rol dkar dmar gyi snang ba) and the perceiving mind (nang dran rig) are said to be radiance the dharmakiiya ('od gsal chos sku, *p rabhii­svaradhannakiiya). Although the current state may be confused and deluded, the experience of confusion itself is radiance, dharmakiiya. Therefore, the meditator ought not to attempt removing the confusion but should rather realize its real nature. This understand­ing must then be put into experience through meditation. As a result of the meditation experience, everything appears unreal and dream-like even while the yogi does not rest in meditation. The conduct is accomplished by realizing that there is nothing to achieve or abandon, and as this attitude is perfected, the practitioner reaches the result, which is to be free of hopes and fears. The themes presented in this segment are basically the same as those seen in segment sixteen, though more details are given here. 621 Correlated passages: DK.cx.Ka. l 13a5-l 15h DK.B.Ca. l 8.36br39a5, DK.D.Ca. l 8.40a5-43a2, DK.P.Ca.18. 140a4-l42b6, DK.Q.Ca.18.120a3-l22b1, DK.R.Ca.18.59b1-63bi, DK.S.Ca.18.70as-75a2, DK.T.Ca.18 pp. 3112-3314. 622 Correlated passages: DK.cx.Ka. l l 5b3-l l8as, DK.B.Ca.19.39a5-41 b6, DK.D.Ca. l 9.43a2-46a1, DK.P.Ca.19.142b5-l 45b6, DK.Q.Ca.19.122b1-125a2, DK.R.Ca.19.63b1-67b2, DK.S.Ca.19.75a2-80a2, DK.T.Ca.19 pp. 33w3522."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"252 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um Segment DK.A.Ca.20: The segment begins (DK.A.Ca.20.41b6): /lb la ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ spyir theg pa chen po'i rigs dang ldan pa'i rten gyi gang zag gis 'bras bu yang dag par rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas thob par byed pa la/.

It is said that the practitioner should even be able to sacrifice his or her own body (rang lus sbyin par btang ha) for the sake of removing the suffering of other sentient beings and accomplishing their happiness. Thereupon, a visualization is explained, where the meditator imagines that a field of bla mas, deities, buddhas, and bodhisattvas assemble in the space in front of him. The meditator then mentally offers his own body (rang !us mchod par 'bu!) to the visualized field of Awakened ones, whereupon the body no longer is there. With this, the meditator then turns his focus to his own mind (rang gi sems), deliberating where it exists when there is no body and how it is. Looking in this way, he becomes abs orbed into an experience that the mind is not established as a thing that possesses any kind of identifiable trait. This understanding is said to constitute the realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha) of the pure nature of the mind (sems kyi chos nyid, *cittadharmatii). The meditator should rest in an uncon­trived manner (ma bcos par) in awareness of this state (de ka 'i ngang la shes pa). 623 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka. l l 8a5- l l 9b5, DK.B.Ca.20.41 b6-43a5, DK.D.Ca.20.46ar-47b2, DK.P.Ca.20.145b6-147a7, DK.Q.Ca.20.125az-126a7, DK.R.Ca.20.67bz-69b5, DK.S.Ca.20.80az-82b4, DK.T.Ca.20 pp. 3522-3629. 624 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.119b5-122a2, DK.B.Ca.21.43a5-45a7, DK.D.Ca.21.47b2-50a2, DK.P.Ca.21.147ar 149bs, DK.Q.Ca.2l.126ar 128b2, DK.R.Ca.21.69bs-73as, DK.S.Ca.21.82b4-86bs, DK.T.Ca.21 pp. 362r3824."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 253 This meditation is followed by a precise instruction on a guruyoga practice, which is here explained as being a technique for entering the meditation on the nature of the mind. The meditator must first visualize his root teacher (rtsa ba 'i bla ma) seated on a lotus flower and a moon disc in the space in front of him. It is imperative that he with intense devotion views the teacher as an actual Buddha (sangs rgyas dngos). Thereupon, the yogi should visualize that he performs prostrations and makes mental offerings to the meditation teacher. A short prayer is given for requesting the teacher's blessing, which should be recited three times. Next, the meditator imagines that the teacher's blessing carrying non­dual knowledge (gnyis su med pa'i ye shes kyi byin gyi brlab) streams from the bla ma's heart in the form of a wave of light. The light assumes the form of fire, which incinerates all negative actions and obscurations of body, speech, and mind, whereupon the fire and the practitioner's own body dissolve into space. In this bodiless state, the yogi should then look for the nature of his own mind, realizing that it is empty like space. He should observe that the mind, unconditioned space ( 'dus ma byas pa 'i nam mkha '), and emptiness are insepara­ble (dbyer med du song ba), and thus rest his mind in a state of non-dichotomy or non­duality (gnyis med, *advaya). By thus resting in the unborn nature of the mind as such (sems nyid skye ba med pa 'i don), he meditates within the inseparability of space and knowledge (dbyings dang ye shes). He understands that all outer sensory perceptions do not exist as real phenomena but that they are merely the deluded experiences of his own mind (rang gi sems kyi 'khrul pa 'i snang ba). Moreover, he sees that the mind itself does not exist as a thing having any identifiable feature (dngos po dang mtshan ma gang du yang grub pa med de).

This is discussed by narrating a verbal exchange between Bsod nams rin chen's main Bka' gdams pa teacher Dge bshes [Rgya] Yon bdag and the famous Bka' gdams pa master Dge bshes Po to ba [Rin chen gsal] (1027 /31-1105). That is followed by another quotation on the same topic from Bsod nams rin chen's teacher Bla ma Mi la [ras pa] . A second quotation from Mi la ras pa segues into the segment's other topic, namely the four aberrations that the advanced practitioner may develop about emptiness (stong nyid shor sa bzhi). These include misunderstanding emptiness as a means for enhancing activities (stong nyid rgyas 'debs su shor ba), mista­king emptiness as a remedy (stong nyid gnyen por shor ba), mistaking emptiness as the path (stong nyid lam du shor ba), and mistaking emptiness as the nature of phenomena (stong nyid shes bya 'i gshis la shor ba).626 It is taught at some length how to avoid these mis takes and how to develop a correct understanding and meditative application of emptiness.

When this innermost nature of the mind has been realized, it leads to actualization of the true nature (chos nyid, *dharmatii) and the manifestation of the form bodies (gzugs sku, *nlpakiiya) that perform A wakened activities for the sake of sentient beings. Through a series of rhetorical questions and answers, the segment explains in some detail how these form bodies are effected by the bodhisattva's previous accumulation of wishing prayers (smon lam, *'pra�iidhiina) for accomplishing benefit for sentient beings, how these pure (dag pa) and impure (ma dag pa) bodies appear to the minds of sentient beings (sems can gyi snang ba), how they relate to the relative (kun rdzob, *sm?1vrti) and absolute (don dam, *paramiirtha) levels of truth (bden pa, *satya), and how they progressively manifest on the higher stages of the path. Various qualities of the different bodhisattva levels (sa, *blnlmi) are also listed. Finally, the nature of the mind is explained through the three meditative experiences (nyams myong, *anubhuta) of bliss (bde ba, *sukha), presence (gsal ba, *vyakti), and non-thought (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa), with added clarifications of the potential dangers that exist in clinging to these experiences as being superior (mchog 'dzin, *paramnta). If the yogi is capable of avoiding these dangers by recognizing ('khyer ba) the inner nature of thoughts (rnam rtog de nyid) as being knowledge (rig pa, *vidya) and recognizing knowledge as being the mind (rig pa sems su 'khyer ba), he attains mastery (rtsal sbyang, *vyavasiiya) of meditation (ting nge 'dzin, *samadhi).

In an earlier article, JACKSON (1992:101, citing Ts hogs chos yon tan phun tshogs p. 269.1 = DK.Q.Cha.6.1 34a1) also referred to this passage as evidence that Sgam po pa portrayed Rdzags chen \"as occupying a parallel doctrinal position to the Mahamudra as a practical instr uction (man ngag) of the Mantrayana 'perfection stage' (rdzags rim), and on occasion even seems almost to identify the two.\" 638 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.55ar55bs, DK.B.Cha.7.6br7h DK.D.Cha.7.7b4-8b2, DK.P.Cha.7.155arl56a3, DK.Q.Cha.7.134arl 34bs, DK.R.Cha.7. l0b4-l lb6, DK.S.Cha.7.12b1-13bs, DK.T.Cha.7 pp. 527-614.

These statements are then laid out through the framework of the Bka' gdams pa doctrine transmitted by Atifa (jo bo) and later teachers, including Sgam po pa, referencing the practices to be performed by the three types of persons (skyes bu gsum, *tripuru�a). The mentioned practices include the cultivation (sgom pa, *bhavana) of kindness (hymns pa, *maitrf), compassion (snying rj e, *karu7:1Ci), and relative bodhicitta (kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems, *sm71vrtibodhicitta), along with the contemplations of impermanence (mi rtag pa, *anitya) and the cause and effect of actions (las rgyu 'bras, *karmahetuphala). These stages of the path (lam rim) constitute a necessary basis for realizing the original nature (gnyug ma, *nijasmJ1vid), because if the practitioner by relying on these gradual practices has not first overcome desire (chags, *raga) for places,people and things, there will not be benefit even if the original nature should emerge within the meditation.

A distinction is brought out between the Paramita approach (pha rol tu phyin pa 'i bzhed pa, *p aramite�,ta) followed by Buddhist scholars (mtshan nyid pa, *lak�a(iika) and the Secret Mantra approach (gsang sngags kyi bzhed pa, *mahayanaguhyamantre�.ta) of the Maha­yana (theg pa chen po). The Paramita approach consists of the gradual paths (lam rim) of the three persons (skyes bu gsum). This is followed by a short teaching on the stages of the Mahayana practice carried out by the best person (skyes bu mchog, *puru�ottama), such as the mind training (blo sbyong ba) of cultivating kindness (hymns pa), compassion (snying rj e), and bodhicitta (byang chub kyi sems). Fostering these attitudes (blo) is said to be necessary for manifesting the Awakened form bodies (gzugs sku, *rupakaya), without which the dhannakiiya will not arise (chos sku mi 'byung).

The ninth segment concerns select elements from among the twelve links of dependent arising (rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba, *pratftyasamutpiida). First it discusses ignorance (ma rig pa, *avidyii) and how ignorance gives rise to afflictive feelings (nyon mongs pa, *klefo) and thereby becomes positive (dge ba, *kusala), negative (mi dge ba, *akusala), or indeterminate (lung ma bstan, *avyiikrta) in nature. These states produce consciousness (rnam par shes pa, *vijfiana), which becomes infused with the seeds of habitual tendencies (bag chags kyi sa bon, *viisaniibfja). Liberation (thar pa, *nwk�a) from smJisiira is explained as consisting in relying on the instructions of a genuine teacher (bla ma dam pa'i gdam ngag) in order to recognize ignorance as knowledge (ma rig pa rig par ngo 'phrod pa). Thereby, conscious­ness (rnam par shes pa) emerges as radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhiisvara), thus eliminating the place (sa) for the seeds of habitual tendencies and turning the conditioned factors ('du byed, *sm?Iskiira) into radiance as well.

This is supported with an explanation from the Tantras of the female knowledge-holders (rig pa 'dzin ma 'i rgyud, *vidyiidharftantra), where it is taught that if the bodies of oneself and others are regarded as deities, then harming or killing anyone would amount to hurting or killing a deity, which would completely shut the door to attaining accomplishment (dngos grub, *siddhi).

The prior quoted sentence is derived from the first chapter of the Sa11ipufatantra. 643 Thereupon, the segment quotes three lines from a poem or song attributed to one Rnal 'by or pa (*yogi) saying that the Buddha is not real and that \"I\" (nga) is the person giving the teaching ('chad pa po), the teaching given (chos), as well as the person listening to the teaching (nyan pa), who possesses a multitude of self-aware [instances of mind] (rang rig tshogs ldan). The identity of the poem's author named Rnal 'byor pa is uncertain, but it might refer to one of Ati8a's students.644 The remainder of the segment comments on these lines, discussing the meaning of there being no identifiable meditator or object of meditation, particularly in terms of how this point relates to the meditative experience of non-thought or non­conceptuality (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa).

Vital force (srog rtsol, *p rii�w) is led into the central channel (dbu ma), whereby the meditator experiences bliss (bde ba), presence (gsal ba), and non-thought (mi rtog pa). Thereafter, the pracitioner focuses his attention on the immaculate nature of awareness (rig pa rang gi ngo bo skyon thams cad kyis ma gos pa), realizing that the view (lta ba), the meditation (sgom pa), and the conduct (spyod pa) all are nothing but mind (sems).

The practice is then explained in terms of the view, meditation, and conduct. The view (!ta ba, *dr�,ti) is illustrated by quoting twenty lines from a song by Mi la ras pa. Some remarks are given on the right meditation practice (sgom pa, *bhavana) and conduct (spyod pa, *caryii), emphasizing how the meditator -when meditating on \"innate knowledge\" (gnyug ma 'i shes pa, *nijasmJivid) -should first cultivate the bodhisattva attitudes of kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening. Then -while meditating on radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhasvara) -he should recognize that radiance is, in fact, nothing but his own mind (rang gi sems, *svacitta), namely the uncontrived nature of the mind (sems kyi rang bzhin ma bcos pa, * akrtrimacittasvabhava). Without attempting to be present or not pre­sent within this nature, without trying to do anything positive or negative, without striving to realize or not realize it, the meditator must leave the mind at it is in its natural state without attempting to create anything (dran rig la so gs pa gang du yang mi byed pa). This state is what is called \"the original nature\" (gnyug ma, *nijasm71vid). It is the nature of the mind which is emptiness (sems kyi rang bzhin stong pa nyid, *cittasvabhiivasi\"'inyatii). This nature of the mind is radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhiisvara). It is what is called \"the natural mind\" (tha mal gyi shes pa, *p rakrtajfiana). Contrasting this meditative approach with the philosophical view (grub mtha', *siddhanta) of the Paramitayiina, the emptiness established by the Madhayamaka argu­ment of neither being one nor many (gcig dang du bra!, *ekanekaviyoga) is said to be a mere intellectually fabricated and artificial notion of emptiness (blos byas kyi stong pa).

It ends (DK.A.Cha.24.14a3): /khyed dang mthun na de yang dag nga'i 'dad pa de yin gsung/.661 The short segment twenty-four explains the right view (!ta ba, *dr�ti) as being the understanding that no phenomenon exists externally of the mind (sems las phyi rol du gyur ba'i chos med de) and that the mind is unborn (sems skye ba me pa). The meditation (sgom pa, *bhavanii) is to rest the mind one-pointedly (sems rtse gcig tu 'jog pa, *cittaikiigratiiprati�_thapana) in this realization (rtogs pa'i don), while the conduct (spyod pa, *carya) is not to waver (yengs pa med pa, *avik�epa). It is then stated that there are two ways of putting this into experience (nyams su Zen pa, *udvahana). One approach is to contemplate intellectually through a conceptual image (don spyi's tshul du bsgom pa) by logically ascertaining all phenomena as being empty and unborn and resting the mind (blo 'jog pa) therein. Another approach is to meditate directly on the actual nature (don dngos par sgom pa) by experiencing the real (don dngos po) co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa), which is dharmakiiya and radiance and whose nature is knowledge (rig pa'i ngo bo, *vidyilrupa). The latter approach is not intellectual (rtog ge'i !ta ba'i spyod yul ma yin pa, *tiirkikadr�figocaro niisti); rather it is a form of meditation that consists in cultivating the blessing of the bla ma (bla ma'i byin rlabs bsgom pa). The segment ends with the declaration: \"My assertion is that [latter approach]\" (nga yi 'dad pa de yin gsung). 659 The passage on the three approaches has been translated and briefly discussed by MATHES (2006:202-203). 660 The segment is parallel to the first part of segment DK.A.Tha.16, but the two segments display a number of variant readings. 661 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.62a.+-62b2, DK.B.Cha.24.13b6-14a3, DK.D.Cha.24.1 6arl6b1, DK.P.Cha.24. l 62br 16334, DK.Q.Cha.24.141 bn, DK.R.Cha.24.23ar23b1, DK.S.Cha.24.27as-28ai,DK.T.Cha.24 pp. 1214�23- A facsimile copy of DK.D.Cha.24 is found in Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The negated unborn is to ascertain the unborn as the selflessness of the individual and of phenomena. This approach does not encompass the naturally unborn (rang bzhin skye med la ma khyab). The naturally unborn is the self-liberated emptiness (stong pa nyid rang grol) that emerges through the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo) and other Tantric yogas of the Method Path (thabs lam, *upiiyamiirga). The naturally unborn encompasses the negated unborn . This explanation is then related to the meditative experiences (nyams myong, *anubhuta) generated through other yogas as follows. Seeing perceptions (snang ba, *avabhiisa) as hallucination (sgyu ma, *miiyii) is the yoga of the Illusory Body (sgyu lus); seeing hallucinations as being empty is the yoga of Radiance ('od gsal); and seeing these as not being different is the yoga of union (zung 'jug, *samayuga).

Emphatic statements are made with regard to life's impermanence and the many externally and internally possible causes of death, as well as regarding the need for abandoning negative actions and doing what is positive in order to achieve a good rebirth. This is explained -with reference to the framework of the three persons (skyes bu gsum) -as being the mentality of the lesser person (skyes bu chung ngu). Thereafter, statements are made about the suffering of sm?1siira and the importance of striving for liberation by taking refuge, adopting the training in discipline (tshul khrims kyi slab pa, *film?isik�ii), and meditating on the four truths of the noble ones ('phags pa'i bden pa bzhi, *catvilry tiryasatytini) until nirvii!ia is achieved. This is said to be the approach of the middling person (skyes bu 'bring). Finally, it is necessary to cultivate kindness, compassion, and bodhicitta for the sake of relieving all sentient beings of their sm11stiric suffering. That is the Mahayana path of the highest person (skyes bu mchog). This must be followed by perfecting insight through understanding all phenomena to be unborn and not existing outside one's own mind as well as by understanding the mind itself to be empty of an independent nature. To give rise to this understanding, it is said first to be necessary to make offerings and pray with deep-felt devotion to the bla ma and to the Three Jewels (dkon mchog gsum, *triratna) of the Buddhist refuge.

These three are defined and explained in terms of how they concretely appear in the beginner practitioner moving onto progressively more advanced levels. The segment includes the well-known phrase \"compassion with a heart of emptiness\" (snying rj e stong pa'i snying po can).

The text's colophon declares that this tshogs chos text was written by Bla ma Bsgom tshul, i.e., Bsod nams rin chen's elder nephew and main lineage-holder Sgom pa Tshul khrims snying po. This statement is followed by an enumera­tion of a transmission lineage starting with Buddha Sakyamuni and moving down to Bso d nams rin chen and his nephew lineage-holder Bla ma Bsgom tshul. However, it is then stated that the transmission thereafter was passed on step-by-step (de nas rim par rgyud pa'o). The latter information suggests that the text, in fact, may have been written, edited, or modified some generations after Bsod nams rin chen and Bia ma Bsgom tshul. Alternatively, it might imply that only the last sentence was added later to indicate that the original work was handed down through a transmission line, but that the text itself was truly written by Bsgom tshul as claimed in the first part of the colophon. The colophon also refers to the title of the text as being \"The Large Teaching to the Assembly\" (Tshogs chos chen po), while it does not provide the present title of the text, viz. \"The Pearl Rosary\" (Mu tig gi phreng ba) that is stated on the frontispiece of the text in the 1520 xylograph (DK.A.Ja) and its apographs.

The first a preparatory practice (sbyor ba, *p rayoga) which is aimed at developing the motivation to reach buddhahood in order to free all sentient beings from suffering and bring them happiness.

It is said that the latter approach prevents new habitual tendencies (bag chags, *viisanii) from being stored in the latent [consciousness] (kun gzhi, *iilaya), thereby terminating the accumulation (bsags pa, *upacita) of new karmic actions (las, *kannan).

Having understood death and impermanence ('chi ba mi rtag pa), the practitioner must cultivate bodhicitta and develop kindness and compassion by contemplating the shortcomings of saf!isiira ('khor ba'i nyes dm igs, * sm71siiriidfnava), thus fostering the intention to benefit others (sems can gyi don byed pa, *sattviirthakara).

The passage's first focus is the contemplation of impermanence (mi rtag pa, *anitya) combined with understanding how the transient nature of all outer phenomena means that things should be seen as being unreal (mi bden par bzung). The second focus is to realize that the nature of the mind (sems rtogs) is knowledge (ye shes, >tjfiiina) and that this understanding is highest Awakening (sangs rgyas, *buddha), which cannot be obtained or sought from others.

It ends (DK.A.Ja.6.6a1): /shes he badzra las gsungs sol !chos de las ma mchis so//.679 Here the briefness of the human lifespan (tshe 'di yun thung) is underscored and it is concluded that there is no time to lose by diverting attention to studying too many teachings. Rather, the practitioner ought to learn only select but significant teachings, like the proverbial Indian goose (ngang pa, *haryisa) that has the ability to extract milk from water. Having obtained mastery of the mind (rang sems la dbang thob), the meditator must make the mind (sems, *citta) pliable (las su rung ba, *karmm;,ya). Those who feel trust in the Generation and Completion stages of the Man­trayiina (bskyed rdzogs la mos pa rnams) should use these methods to render the mind skillful (las su rung, *kanna!iya). The practitioner may then employ the methods of the channels, winds, and drops (rtsa rlung thig le), Mahamudrii (phyag rgya chen po), or Rdzogs pa chen po.680 These practices enable realization of the nature of the mind (sems chos nyid du rtogs pa khong du chud pa) and thereby give rise to natural feelings (shugs las 'byung ba) of compassion and equanimity (mnyam pa nyid, *samatii). The passage ends with a quotation from the Hevajra Tantra.

JACKSON (1994:30 fn. 70) has referred to this passage in order to show how Sgam po pa identified Mahiimudrii and Rdzags chen in their essentials. It must, however, be remarked that the present passage uses coordinating conjunctives (zer kyang rung/ ... zer kyang rungl ... zer kyang rung) and therefore does not actually equate the individual elements, viz. the practice of channels, winds, and drops (rtsa rlung th ig le nyams su !en pa), meditation on the absolute and the relative (don dam kun rdzab), Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po), and Great Perfection (rdzags pa chen po). JACKSON left out the first half of the list in his quotation. 681 The apographs of DK.A.Ia clearly read gang zag, but the word is somewhat smudged in the extant print of DK.A.Ia itself, where the word appears to be written gal yug."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"274 Chapter 5: The Dags po 'i bka' 'bum gsung/ chos de las ma mchis so//.682 The seventh segment begins by declaring the i m­portance of cultivating kindness, compassion, and bodhicitta. It then says that one shouldpractice Maluimudrii while avoiding three errors (skyon bral gsum), viz. an error pertainingto perceptions (snang ba'i skyon dang bral ba), an error pertaining to emptiness (stong pa'i skyon dang bral ba), and an error pertaining to the unborn (skye ba med pa'i skyon dang bra! ba). The first, avoiding the error pertaining to perceptions (snang ba, *avabhiisa),means not to take perceptions as being real (bden par mi 'dzin pa) but rather as being merehallucinations (sgyu ma tsam, *miiyiimiitra). Using the slogan known from the fourDharmas of Sgam po pa (Dags po'i chos bzhi), this stage is here referred to as turning[one's] Dharma to the Dharma (chos chos su 'gro ba). The second, avoiding the errorpertaining to emptiness (stong pa, *siinya), means not to desire [realizing] emptiness (stong nyid kyi 'dad chags, *sunyatiiriiga), since that would create an artificial concept (rnam rtog, *vikalpa) of emptiness. The third, avoiding the error pertaining to the unborn (skyed med, *anutpanna), means not to see perceptions and emptiness as being different (snang ba stong pa res 'jog tu ma song ba), but to understand them both as being unborn (skyed med) and thereby to be completely without any form of dualistic consciousness (gnyis snang gi shes pa). The passage ends with a reference to the textual tradition of Mahamudrii (phyag rgya chen po'i gzhung lugs), where the avoidance of these three errors is said to result in the attainment of the three kiiyas (sku gsum), which is briefly explained. It is then stated that this is the approach (bzhed pa, *i�ta) of the Great Brahmar.ia [Saraha] (bram ze chen po). Segment DK.A.Ja.8: The segment begins (DK.A.Ja.8.6b4): /Im am pa kun la chos gcig snyan du gsol ba'i dbang du bgyis na/ tshe la long med rgyud la dran pa 'i lcag gis bkul zhing/. It ends (DK.A.Ja.8.8a1): ji srid du blo 'i 'dad pa zad zad nyamsu blang/ chos de las ma mchis/.683 In segment eight, the impermanence of life (tshe la long med) is again highlighted and it is said to be of great importance to rely on a teacher (bla ma la bsten pa, *gurviisevita) as a source of refuge (skyabs gnas, *sara�wk�etra). The segment then turns to discuss Dharma practice (nyams su Zen pa, *udvahana) and here gives a reference to a three-word instruction derived from the tradition of [the Rdzogs chen teacher] A ro Ye shes 'byung gnas (ca. l01h century) (a ro ye shes 'byung gnas kyi lugs).684 The three-word instruction simply states: \"Perceptions are emerging\" (snang shar 682 Correlated passages: DK.B.Ja.7.6a1-6b4, DK.D.Ja.7.6b3-7a6, DK.P.Ja.7.17lb1-172a5, DK.Q.Ja.7.1 50a5-15lai , DK.R.Ja.7.8a6-9bi, DK.S.Ja.7.10b1-llb5, DK.T.Ja.7 pp. 429-516.

This instruction is then explained at length within a threefold framework, namely what experiences or perceptions (snang ba, *avabhasa) are (cir snang); how they emerge (cir shar); and if they are there, how they are (yin na ci yin). In short, the teaching concerns how all perceptions are only mental experiences (sems kyi snang ba, *cittavabhasa) and how the mind itself is unborn (rang sems skye med) . To meditate on this is to meditate on dharmakaya, whereas if perceptions are taken as real external objects, they then become nothing but smJisara even though they nonetheless remain dharmakaya in nature. Another reference is then given to an unspecified teaching-cycle of the Great Perfection system (Rdzogs chen skor lugs), according to which the meditator should first determine all phenomena as being his own mind, whereafter he should discover the nature of the mind as being empty and unborn. This is again explained in some detail. Segment DK.A.Ja.9: The segment begins (DK.A.Ja.9.8a1): Imam pa kun la chos gcig snyan du gsol ba'i dbang du bgyis na/ chos bsha' ma gcig byed pa la/. It ends (DK.A.Ja.9.8<4): snang shar yin gsum du nyams su blangs pas nyams rtogs 'bras bu kun 'grub ste/ chos de las ma mchis//.685 This short segment begins by saying that the practi­tioner must realize impermanence (mi rtag pa, *anitya) and turn the mind away from the affairs of the present life (tshe 'di la blo ld og). Contemplating the shortcomings of sa1Jisara ('khor ba'i nyes dmigs, *smJlsiiriidfnava), he should abandon all hope for SaJ?lSliric rebirth. Thereafter, he must cultivate kindness, compassion, and bodhicitta. Entering into the meditative experience and realization of the [Rdzogs chen] statement that \"perceptions are emerging\" (snang shar yin gsum du nyams su blangs pas, cf. the preceding segment DK.A.Ja.8 above), he should then meditate on the whole multiplicity of perceptions (snang ba sna tshogs) as being unreal (bden med, *asat), see the unborn mind (sems skye med) as being dhannakaya (chos sku), and see the whole range of sensory perceptions and sensations (byung tshor sna tshogs) as being unborn, empty, and dhannakaya. If the meditator practices in this manner with an undistracted mind (sems ma yengs pa), he is bound to accomplish all the results of the practice ('bras bu kun 'grub) through gaining meditative experiences and realization (nyams rtogs). Segment DK.A ..

As a consequence, the practitioner must abandon self-interest (rang don med) and only act in the interest of others (sems can gyi don du). It is said to be a grave mistake to give up concern for sentient beings (sems can blos spang), because this would go against the Mahiiyiina doctrine and the spiritual teacher (dge ba 'i bshes gnyen, *kalyii!iami tra). In reference to the Secret Mantrayiina, all beings are to be seen as male and female deities (!ha dang lha mo'i rang bzhin), due to which the practitioner cannot uphold afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, *kle§a) towards them. In reference to Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po) and Rdzags chen (rdzogs pa chen po), he must see all experiences as the light of dharmakiiya, its ornament, or its great display (chos sku'i 'od dam/ rgyan nam che ba'i rol pa). Relying on this view, the meditator is likewise barred from maintaining afflictive emotions. Instead, one must accumulate positive actions in order to purify the body, speech, and mind for the benefit of all sentient beings. As long as the mind is tainted by tendencies (bag chags, *viisanii) and afflictions (dug lnga, *paficavi�a), it is necessary to persevere (bsgrim dgos) in the meditative practice. It is only by realizing their unborn nature that the tendencies and afflictions can be purified. The yogi must continuously practice in this manner until the bond to smJisiira ('khor ba'i 'brel thag) has been completely severed. Segment DK.A.Ja.11: The segment begins (DK.A.Ja.l l.9a1): /Im am pa kun la chos cig snyan du gsol ba'i dbang du bgyis na/ chos bsha' ma cig byed pa la/ tshe 'di mi rtag cing long med pas dngos po gang thongs thongs gtong dgos tel.

Also, the practitioner must understand that there is no permanent self (bdag, *iitman) and that the concept of \"mine\" (bdag gir, *svzkara!ia) therefore is equally inapplicable. The same goes for all related notions, such as the concepts of being a son (bu, *p utra), having an enemy (dgra, *amitra), having wealth (nor, *dhana), being renowned (snyan pa, *yafas), being exposed to defamation (mi snyan pa, *aya§as), and receiving praise (bstod pa, *stuti).

First one must turn the mind to the Refuge and the bla ma (bla ma yi dam dkon mchog) and pray to them with strong faith and devotion (dad pa dang 'dun pa mos pa dang gus pa). Then one must take the practice of the six perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa drug, *�a! paramita[i) to heart and implement them in one's life with relative and ultimate bodhicitta (don dam kun rdzob, *paramarthasaryivrtl). In terms of the relative bodhicitta, one must abandon negative actions (sdig pa, *papa) and gather positive deeds (dge ba, *kufala) which in the future will ripen (smin) as good rebirths ('bras bu bzang po'i bde ba skye ba phyi ma). A quotation is given from the Ratnagu�iasaf(lcayagatha scripture to illustrate that there can be no enlightenment as long as one has not gathered the bases of positive qualities (dge ba 'i rtsa ba, *kusalamiila). Hence, conviction in action and result (las rgyu 'bras, *karmahetuphala) is essential. Once the ultimate truth has been realized, one automatically becomes liberated from karmaphala and sa171sara. A quotation is here given from Acarya Vairocana (slob dp on bai ro tsa na) to illustrate the need for practicing positive actions, followed by another quotation from Nagarjuna (slob dp on klu sgrub). It is concluded that one must seek to practice the two truths without separating them (bden gnyis dbyer med du nyams su blang 'tshal).

The second is freedom from conceptual entanglement (spros bra!, *ni�prapafica), which is practiced when a meditative focus no longer is used (dmigs med, *analambana). The third is called one taste (ro gcig, *ekarasa), which is practiced when all experiences (snang ba, *ava­bhiisa) are understood as being mind (sems, *citta). The fourth is the yoga wherein there is nothing to be cultivated (bsgom du med pa 'i rnal 'byor, *bhiivaniibhiivayoga), which is embarked upon when the meditative experience (nyams, *anubhuta) has become uninterrupted (rgyun chad med, *nifrhidra or *nirantara). If the yogf performs these four practices, he will accomplish benefit for himself as well as for others (rang don dang gzhan don gnyis ka).

First, the yoga of mantra is explained as consisting in visualizing the deities and their illusory nature during the Generation and Completion stages. The yoga of substances (*dravya, rdzas) pertains to seeing all things, including wealth and belongings, as being hallucinatory and dream-like. The yoga of phenomena means to realize the nature of all phenomena to be like the center of the pure sky and to realize the equality of oneself and others as well as of all labels such as 'being' and 'non-being'. The explanations are sup­ported by further scriptural quotations. Finally, it is explained how the yogfmay practice all three yogas in unison during a single meditation session (rnal 'byor gsum ka stan thog cig tu) and during the ensuing phase in between the meditation sessions (thun mtshams).

In order to use this human life for practicing the Dharma, the practitioner must abandon the ten negative actions (mi dge ba bcu spang) and perform the ten positive ones (dge ba bcu, *dafokufola). These actions are enumerated with their negative and positive aspects. Finally, it is explained that the yogi should practice the six perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa, *piiramitii) with an understanding of their dream-like, hallucinatory nature (rmi lam sgyu ma lta bu).

When dying, the things or persons of this life are really of no help (phan pa med). In­stead, one has to look to one's own mind (rang sems) for happiness (phan te bde ba). Those with trust in the practice of mantra should during meditation see all experiences as mind (sons su shes) and understand that the mind itself has neither shape nor color (dbyibs dang kha dog kyang ma grub). The mind is free from any characteristic (ngos bzung thams cad dang bral ba). Looking at the mind in this manner, all conceptual constructs (spros pa, tprapafica) will automatically dissolve (rang bzhin rang sar grol) and the meditator can thereby rest in meditative absorption (mnyam bzhag, *samiihita).

The right path is characterized by six aspects: not holding grudges (mi phod pa la thog brdzis bya ba), avoiding all attachment ('khri ba bead pa), reversing all cravings (zhen pa bzlog pa), identifying one's faults (skyon ngos bzung ba), uprooting the source of all faults (mtshang yul nas 'don pa), and bringing all joys and sufferings onto the path (bde sdug thams cad chos nyid du khyer) .

These yogas are then explained, each in a detailed manner with particular emphasis on how to avoid errors and how to progress to the succeeding stage. It is, for example, emphasized that once the practitioner has entered the yoga of freedom from conceptual entanglement and a feeling of detachment (chags med, *asaliga) has arisen in his mind, it is at that point important that the yogf keeps on praying intensely to the bla ma, makes offerings to the three jewels, engages in a study of the view according' to the profound teachings (chos gang zab), and remains without pride (nga rgyal med pa, *vigatamiina). Otherwise, there is serious risk that obstacles (bar chad, *vfcika or *antariiya) will arise. Respect and devoti on (mos gus, *adhimuktigauravau) are important, because without these attitudes meditative experience and realization (nyams rtogs) will not occur, since the approach of the Secret Mantrayiina (gsang sngags theg pa'i lugs) is a path of the bla ma's blessing (byin brlabs bla ma'i la m). If the practitioner follows this approach in a proper manner, he will enter the next stage of one taste. When explaining -in a somewhat similar fashion -how the practitioner should act in order to further progress after having entered the stage of one taste, a reference is given to the \"profound Dharma of Candraprabha Kumara\" (zla 'ad gzhon nu'i chos zab), which the practitioner should study at this point. It is unclear whether the name Candraprabha Kumara here should be understood as referring to the bodhisattva of the Samiidhiriijasiltra and that it consequently is this particular Sittra scripture that is to studied, or whether the epithet here rather refers to Bsod nams rin chen and that it thus is his special teachings and instructions on Mahiimudrii that are to be learnt at this point. The latter interpretation would seem to be more in line with the overall teachings of the corpus. It should though be noted that the passage immediately upon this reference mentions the importance of listening to teachings on the Sittras, the Tantras and the great Siistra treatises (mdo rgyud dang bstan chos chen po), which would seem to favor the former interpretation 698 Correlated passages: DK.B.Ja.20. l 7a3-l 8a7, DK.D.Ja.20.19a3-20b6, DK.P.Ja.20. l 84a5-l 86a3, DK.Q.Ja.20.161a6-l62b6, DK.R.Ja.20.25bs-28a5, DK.S.Ja.20.33as-36as, DK.T.Ja.20 pp. 1435-l 6 11.

The last point concerns the measure of faith having become completely fixed and stable (dad pa brtan pa'i tshad, *fraddhiidhrtiparimii�ia), where based on a scriptural quotation it is said that someone truly endowed with faith will never transgress his good conduct out of desire, hatred, or stupidity.

The saying narrates a short story about a novice monk (dge tshul, *friima�iera) who lived in India (rgya gar na). First, he requested instruction (gdam ngag, *avaviida) from the Tantric master J!orpbhipa. J!orpbhipa told him that there was no karmic connection ('brel ba med pa) between them and instead sent the monk to his student (nga'i slob ma) Ati8a (a ti sha) with whom the monk had a connection. Having gone to Ati8a (jo bo rj e) and requested teachings, Atifa taught him a siidhana (sgrub thabs) for the bodhisattva deity Avalokitesvara (spyan ras gzigs). Having successfully performed the practice, the monk had a vision of seeing (mthong ba'i mtshan ma), physically encountering (reg pa'i mtshan ma), and hearing (sgra 'i mtshan ma) the bodhisattva. The monk then asked a series of Dharma questions to A valokitesvara and the bodhisattva gave his replies to these queries, which are narrated in the segment. The brief teaching concerns the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta), the importance of avoiding negative actions and performing beneficial actions, and the nature of consciousness (rnam par shes pa, *vijfiiina). The segment has no colophon. The narrative and its placement in the text may be significant, because its mention of Ati8a and the deity A valokitesvara could suggest a historical, doctrinal, or mythological background for the subsequent teachings of the text. 712 Correlated passages: DK.a..Ka.33a1_6, DK.B.Nya.2.3a4-3b3, DK.D.Nya.2.3as-3b4, DK.P.Nya.2.1 87b3- l 88a3, DK.Q.Nya.2.164�-1 64b2, DK.R.Nya.2.4b2 -5bi, DK.S.Nya.2.4b2-5bi.

Thereupon, a detailed presentation of what is here called \"the four Dharmas\" (chos bzhi) is given. These Dharmas are the four famous statements that later became known as \"the four Dharmas of Sgam po pa\" (Dags po'i chos bzhi). Just before this explanation commences (DK.A.Ja.3.3b6), the segment again inserts the introductory phrase rin po che'i zhal nas (i.e., \"the precious one says ... \"), but given how the preceding part of the segment ends in an unfinished sentence and how the two parts are connected in terms of sharing a common theme, the two parts have here been counted as a single text segment. The four Dharmas are: (1) to turn a Dharma [practice] to the Dharma (chos chos su 'gro ba), (2) to turn the Dharma into a path (chos lam du 'gro ba), (3) to make the path remove delusion (lam 'khrul pa sel ba), and (4) to make delusion arise as knowledge ('khrul pa ye shes su 'char ba). Turning a Dharma [practice] to the Dharma (chos chos su 'gro ba) is here explained as involving two steps or perhap s two alternative forms (gnyis). The first is to turn to the worldly Dharma ('jig rten pa'i chos su 'gro ba, *lokadharmagamana), meaning that the practitioner understands impermanence, develops faith in the doctrine of action and result, strives to avoid lower rebirths, and practices positive actions aimed at achieving higher rebirth in sm?1sara for the sake of personal peace and happiness (rang nyid gcig po zhi bde). The second is to tum to the Dharma of nirva7Ja (mya ngan las 'das pa'i chos su 'gro ba, *nirvi17Jadharmagamana). Here the practitioner understands sa1?1sara to be suffering in nature and consequently strives to reach liberation (thar pa, *mok�a) from sm?1sara. Nevertheless, the practitioner must also understand the limitations involved in the form of Awakening that is reached by fravakas (nyan thos kyi byang chub). Turning the Dharma into a path (chos lam du 'gro ba) is likewise divided into two aspects (gnyis). The first aspect is to tum to the basis of the path (lam gyi gzhir 'gro ba), which consists in understanding the limitations of the lower vehicles (theg pa dman pa, *hznayana), taking up the motivation (kun nas bslang ba, *samutthana) of kindness, 713 Avalokitesvara is only mentioned elsewhere in passing m segments DK.A.Ki.27 and DK.A. *Nyi.1.

The second aspect is to tum to the actual path (lam dngos su 'gro ba), practicing the methods and insight in unison. Making the path remove delusion (lam 'khrul pa sel ba) is taught as repelling the delu­sion of taking things as being real by meditating on them as hallucinatory and abandoning the delusion of the lower vehicles by cultivating kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening. Making delusion arise as knowledge ('khrul pa ye shes su 'char ba) is said to take two forms (gnyis). One form is the approach of dialectics and the practice of the perfections (mtshan nyid pha rol tu phyin pa'i lugs), where the practitioner meditates on non-duality (gnyis su med pa, *advaya) of subject and object (bzung 'dzin, *griihyagriihaka). Realizing the state free from all extremes of conceptual entanglement (spros pa 'i mtha' dang bra! ba), the practitioner passes through four steps of purity (rnam par dag pa, *visuddhi), disap ­pearance (mi snang ba, *adar§ana), non-perception (snang ba med pa, *apratibhiisa), and utter pacification of subject-object (bzung 'dzin nye bar zhi ba, *griihyagriihakopasama). The other form is the Secret Mantra approach (gsang sngags kyi lugs), whose philosophical view is succinctly presented in the passage. According to this view, any state of delusion ('khrul pa, *bhriinti) or non-delusion (ma 'khrul pa, *abhriinta) is equally one's own mind (rang gi sems, *svacitta), without involving any duality (gnyis su med, *advaya). They are indistinguishable within the nature of the mind and they are equally mental projections (sems kyi cha 'phrul, *cittapriitihiirya). The experiencer of delusion ('khrul mkhan) is self-evident or self-radiant (rang la gsal, *svaprakiisa) and non-conceptual (rtog pa med pa, *nirvikalpa). The union of radiance and emptiness (gsal stong) is without identity (ngos bzung med pa), uninterrupted (rgyun chad med pa), and without middle or extreme (mtha' dbus med pa). It is a state of naked awareness lacking any base (rig pa rten med pa gcer bu). Finally, it is said that there is co-emergence (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja) of the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa) and co-emergent perceptions (snang ba lhan cig skyes pa). The former is identified as dharmakiiya (chos sku), while the latter is the light of dhannakiiya (chos sku'i 'od). The segment has no colophon.

In the Piiramitii tradition (pha rol tu phyin pa'i lugs, *piiramitiinaya), on the one hand, the practitioner focuses first on the emptiness of external perceived objects (phyi bzung ba'i yul, *biihyagriihyavi�aya), whereafter the experience thereof is applied to the inner perceiving mind (*nang 'dzin pa'i sems, *adhyiitmagriihakacitta). In the Mahiimudrii tradition (phyag rgya chen po'i lugs, *mahiimudriinaya), on the other hand, the procedure is the other way around, in that the practitioner begins by focusing on the emptiness of the inner perceiving mind, whereafter this experience is applied to outer perceived objects. At this point, the segment commences explaining how to analyze the nature of the mind according to the Mahiimudrii method and this point in the text is marked by the phrase \"the precious one says\" (rin po che 'i gsung), although the phrase here does not not seem to indicate an actual segment break (cf. the similar occurrence above in segment DK.A.Nya.3). The Mahiimudrii analysis of the mind is taught through three aspects: the mind's character (mtshan nyid, *lak�a�a), appearance (ngo bo, *rupa), and nature (rang bzhin, *svabhiiva). The mind's character (mtshan nyid, *lak�a�w) refers to outer experiences and inner thoughts that all arise out of the mind as mental events (sems byung, *caitta), whereas the mind's appearance or essence (ngo bo, *rupa) refers to the mind itself (sems, *citta) as an uninterrupted, empty , and present self-awareness (rang gi rig pa, *svasm71vedanii) that is mistaken for a static \"I\" (bdag, *iitman). This self-awareness is free of the two extremes (mtha' gnyis dang 'bral ba) of existence and non-existence. It is imperishable (mi shigs pa) and unobstructed (mi khegs pa). It is what in other contexts is referred to as great bliss (bde ba chen po, *mahiisukha), co-emergent knowledge (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes, *sahaja­jfiana), and non-duality (gnyis su med pa, *advaya). The inseparability of the mind's character and appearance is the underlying nature (rang bzhin, *svabhiiva) of the mind. Through devotion (mos gus) and diligent application (brtson 'grus), this understanding must undistractedly (ma yengs par) be put into meditative experience. The segment here briefly mentions the well-known analogy of tethering the mind which is like an elephant (sems kyi glang po). A warning is given at the end, saying that if the teacher's instruction is not applied directly (thad so) and the meditator instead lets his own intellect arise and subside 716 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.36as-37as, DK.B.Nya.5.6ar7a1, DK.D.Nya.5.6br7h DK.P.Nya.5. 19la3-l 92a6, DK.Q.Nya.5.1 67a3-l68a3, DK.R.Nya.5. 10as-l 2a3, DK.S.Nya.5. 1 Oas-12<4, DK.T.Nya.5 pp. 430-524.

The whole phrase Mahamudra is said to refer to the non-dual knowledge that is the mind of all buddhas in the three times (du gsum gyi sangs rgyas thams cad kyithugs gnyis su med pa'i ye shes). As for the individual parts of the term, the syllable mu (phyag) is said to denote the self-aware wisdom aspect of the mind (rang gis rang gi ye shes, svaklya1!1 svaym?J )Fianam).718 The syllable dra (rgya) is explained as having three facets signifying the buddha-nature (bde gshegs snying po, *tathagatagarbha) inherent in all beings, the meditative experience thereof (nyams myong, *anublni ta), and the complete realization thereof (rtogs pa, *avabodha). The syllables maha (chen po) express the insurpassability (bla na med pa, *anuttara or *niruttara) of this realization.

Such emendation would be a rather unlikely explanation for the fact that the transposition is not found in DK.A. Nonetheless, the emendation remains a remote possibility if it were the case that DK.A is a misch-codex based on more than one archetype, as was argued above, and that the editor of DK.A chose to base himself primarily on another manuscript than DK.a while copying the present segments. 718 The phrase rang gis rang gi ye shes stems from a verse quoted in the segment from Nagarjuna's Gulzyasamiija commentary, Paiicakrama, chapter 2, verse two, which is preserved in Sanskrit as given above."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 291 Refuge, (3) strong trust in karmaphala (las rgyu 'bras) leading the practitioner to avoid all negative actions, and (4) the will to cut all bonds to this life.

Having done so, the practitioner may take up the practice of Secret Mantra (gsang sngags, *guhyamantra), which constitutes the uncommon Mahiiyiina (thun mong ma yin pa'i theg pa chen po, *asiidhiirm:zamahiiyiina). The Mantra methods consist of the Generation Stage (skyed pa 'i rim pa) and the Completion Stage (rdzags pa 'i rim pa) practices. The remainder of the segment offers a quite detailed explanation of the underlying principles of the Generation Stage practices, summing these up in six points or Dharmas (chos drug). The first point is the subdivisions of the Generation Stages (bskyed rim gyi dbye ba, *utpattikramabheda), referring to the three ways of visualizing the initial appear­ance of the deity, including a step-wise generation (sgrub thabs rim gyis bskyed pa or rim gyis bskyed pa, *siidhanakrame�ia utpatti�i),720 generation [of the deity] via three proce­dures (cha ga gsum gyis bskyed pa), and generation through instant and total recall [of the deity] (skad cig dran rdzogs kyis bskyed pa).721 The second point is the nature of Generation Stage (ngo bo, *svabhiiva), where merely the following very short definition is given: \"Having rejected thoughts of the ordinary, the real nature vividly appears in the form of the deity\" (tha mal gyi rnam rtog bzlog nas ngo bo lhar gsal ba 'o). Thirdly, the segment presents and briefly explains three derivative analyses (nges tshig, *nirukti) of the term \"Generation Stage\" (bskyed rim, *utpattikrama), including \"generating the mind-body722 as the deity\" (sems lus lhar bskyed pa), \"clearly perceiving the body-mind 719 Correlated passages: DK.cx.Ka.39a3-39b4 and DK.cx.Ka.37b5-38b1 (the parallel passage is split due to the transposed folio mentioned above, fn. 717), DK.B.Nya.7.8a3-9a5, DK.D.Nya.7.8b1-9b4, DK.P.Nya.7.193a3-l94bi, DK.Q.Nya.7.168b6-169h DK.R.Nya.7.13b1-15b2, DK.S.Nya.7.13b3-15b5, DK.T.Nya.7 pp. 610-710.

Moreover, segment DK.A.Ki.20 deals with the different visualization techniques for generating the deity and only mentions the two latter types enumerated here. Hence, it is uncertain whether the first sub­division mentioned in the present segment truly constitutes a separate technique. 721 For the two latter visualization techniques, see fn. 1010 and 1011. 722 The phrase \"mind-body\" literally reflects the Tibetan sentence (sems lus) and has been translated so due to the exegesis that is given in the segment in comparison to the following phrase"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"292 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum as the deity\" (!us sems lhar gsal ba), and \"generating the mind, a [mere] verbal designation (tshig tu brjod pa, *vyavahiira or *abhiliipa), as the deity\" (sems tshig tu brjod lhar bskyed pa). The fourth point is the purpose (dgos pa, zp rayojana) of the Generation Stage, which generally speaking is said to be the accomplishment of the realization of union (zung 'jug gi rtogs pa bsgrub) for the best practitioner (rab), while it is overcoming clinging to the ordinary (tha mal gyi zhen pa bzlog) for the mediocre and lower practitioners ('bring dang tha ma). This general explanation is followed by a more detailed explanation (bye brag tu, *visi�fa) pertaining to the twelve purposes of different parts of the Generation Stage ritual, such as visualizing the commitment deities (dam tshig sems dp a', *samayasattva), inviting the knowledge deities (ye shes sems dp a', *jiiiinasattva), blessing the body, speech and mind (sku gsung thugs byin gyis brlabs pa), and receiving empowerment (dbang bskur, *abhi�eka). The fifth point is the measure of stability (brtan pa'i tshad) in the practice of the Genera­tion Stage, which is presented both from one's own and from others' perspectives. For example, the lowest level of stability is the accomplishment that the practitioner is able to see himself as the deity during any kind of daily activity, while the highest degree is the accomplishment of not only seeing himself and everyone else as the deity and the entire environment as the deity's palace, but also to perceive all these appearances as dream-like and hallucinatory at all times. Such accomplishment, in tum, affects how the practitioner is perceived by other beings, particularly by other liberated practitioners (rang grol gzhan) and by hungry ghosts (yi dags, *p reta). The six and final point in this explanation on the Generation Stage is the result ('bras bu, zp hala) to which the practice leads. The ultimate result (mthar thug, *ni�fhii) is the manifestation of the two form kiiyas (gzugs sku, *riipakiiya). The temporary result (gnas skabs, *avasthii) is for the best practitioner to see reality within the present life (tshe 'di la brten nas bden pa mthong), for the middling practitioner to be reborn as a universal monarch ('khor las sgyur ba'i rgyal po, *cakravartin) in a future life, and for the lowest practitioner to attain rebirth in the pure body of a celestial being or human (lha mi'i lus rnam par dag pa thob).

At that point, the practitioner must realize the nature of the mind (rang gi sems ngo shes), which is here explained by the notions of the mind's appearance (ngo bo, *rupa) and its characteristics (mtshan nyid, *lak�m:ia) denoting respectively the perceiving and the perceived aspects of cognition. Once the empty nature of these two aspects has been understood, the practitioner must be committed to serious meditation practice (tshul bzhin du nyams su Zen pa), which is to be carried out in a desolate chamel ground (dur khrod, *smasana) or a place of solitude (dben pa'i gnas, *pravivekya).

It is said that Bde bar gshegs pa Rin po che (i.e., Bsod nams rin chen) purely followed this example and that \"we too must practice and teach accordingly\" (rang re yang de 'i rj es su sgrubl de 'i rj es su slob dgos pa yin/) -presumably with reference to the actual author of this text and his community.

It is explained that the practitioner who enters the Secret Mantra practice must find and rely on a spiritual teacher (dge ba'i bshes gnyen, *kalya!Jamitra) of the Mahayana who possesses the right qualifications (mtshan nyid dang ldan pa, *lak�aJJika). The teacher must hold a proper and unbroken lineage transmission (brgyud pa, *para111para). This lineage is a transmission of gurus reaching back, via the Indian accomplished masters (grub thob, *siddha), all the way to the Buddha as its origin. It also has to be a transmission not only of the written words (yig nag dang dp e rul gyi brgyud par ma song) but also of the oral transmission that has been handed down by the instruction lineage-holders (bka ' brgyud 724 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.40b4-4las, DK.B.Nya.9.10b1-lla3, DK.D.Nya.9.lla1-llb3, DK.P.Nya.9.195bs-196b1, DK.Q.Nya.9. l 7la3-l 71 b4, DK.R.Nya.9.17b5-l 8b6, DK.S.Nya.9.18a3-19�, DK.T.Nya.9 pp. 810-2s.

Nevertheless, it must also be a lineage that relies on the written words, in that the teacher has acquired realization of the meaning of those words (brjod bya 'i don de nges par rtogs pa). Finally, the lineage must confer the blessing (byin rlabs, *adhi�fhiina) that is transmitted through its empowerments (dbang, *abhi�eka) and that enables the teacher to give rise to good qualities (yon tan, *gu�ia) in others. The segment then presents other qualifications needed in the teacher as being either twofold, threefold, or fourfold. The twofold qualification is to be endowed with the eye of the Dharma (chos kyi mig, *dharmalocana) and the eye of insight (shes rah kyi mig, *prajfiiilocana). The threefold qualification is to have the ability to guide other with great insight, being endowed with great compassion and therefore never abandoning sentient beings, and being completely without attachment to this life. The fourfold qualification is to have acquired complete stability in faith, compassion and realization, and to have the attitude of teaching others without concern for profit. The segment ends by saying that the practitioner needs to find such a teacher and that he should not take anyone as his teacher (bla ma, *guru) who is like a fox or like a monkey (wa lta bu sp re 'u lta bu). These animal similes are not explained in the present segment, although the fox reappears in a slightly different context in a later segment of the text (DK.A.Nya.17).

It ends (DK.A.Nya.l0.llb1): de yang rtogs dgos ma rtogs na phan pa med/725 The tenth segment gives a short presentation of the view (lta ba, *drHi). It begins by stating that a great meditator (sgom chen pa) must sever the ties to this life and then needs a view that is conjoined with realization (lta ha rtogs pa dang 'brel ba, *avabodhasambaddhadr�!i), a meditation conjoined with meditative experience (sgom pa nyams myong dang 'brel ha, *anubhutasambaddhabhiivanii), a conduct conjoined with phases (spyod pa dus tshod dang 'brel ba, *veliisambaddhacaryii), and a result conjoined with benefit for others ('bras bu gzhan don dang 'brel ba, *parahitasambaddhaphala). Only the first of these four points, viz. the view conjoined with realization, is presented in the current segment, while the remaining three points are explained below in segment DK.A.Nya.11. The view conjoined with realization is taught in terms of the co-emergent (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja), which as usual is distinguished in terms of the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajacittatii) which is dhannakiiya (chos sku) and co­emergent experiences (snang ha lhan cig skyes pa, *p rabhiisasahaja) which are the light of dharmakiiya (chos sku'i 'od, *dharmakiiyaprakiiia). The co-emergent mind as such is identified as the dharmakiiya that is found within the mind-streams (rgyud, *sa7J1tiina) of all sentient beings. The co-emergent perceptions are said to include the thoughts (rnam rtog, 725 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.41 as-41 h DK.B.Nya. 10.1 1 a3- l l bi, DK.D.Nya. l 0.11b3-l2ai, DK.P.Nya.10.196b1-6, DK.Q.Nya.10.17lb4-l 72a2, DK.R.Nya.10.18b6-19bi, DK.S.Nya.10.19�-19bs, DK.T.Nya.10 pp. 82s-92.

It might have been justified to treat segments ten and eleven as forming a single segment, but since there between them is a very clear segment marker declaring \"the precious lama says\" (bla ma rin po che 'i zhal nas), which also is reflected in the older handwritten manuscript DK.a, they have here been listed as two separate segments. The first point, the view conjoined with meditation, was mainly laid out in segment ten, but segment eleven commences with adding a few more sentences to this point, describing the problem of holding a view that is lacking in realization (rtogs pa med pa'i lta ba). Thereupon, the present segment turns to the second point, viz. meditation conjoined with meditative experience (sgom pa nyams myong dang 'brel ba). Meditative experience (nyams myong, *anubhuta) is defined as an experience of the reality or meaning (don, *artha) of that realization (rtogs pa'i don de nyams su myong), while realization is said to be a realization of the reality or meaning behind the meditative experience. On the one hand, there are some meditative experiences which are not conjoined with what should be cultivated in meditation (bsgom pa dang 'brel ba ma yin), but which have their basis (rten, *iifraya) in the channels and winds (rtsa rlung, *niir;fiviiyu). Such experiences may take the form of extrasensory perceptions, e.g., visions (mig gi[s) mthong snang) and auditory perceptions (rna bas thos snang), or they may arise as the meditative experiences felt during tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *§amatha), viz. bliss, presence, and non-thought (bde gsal mi rtog pa). These are experiences of expansion (phyam 'gro ba) into emptiness (stong pa nyid, *sunyatii), which are described like transcending time (dus 'da ' ba), disappearance (mi snang ba), non-perception (snang ba med pa), and becoming like a pure, cloudless sky (nam mkha' rnam par dag pa). Yet, from the perspective of the result of the path, all such experiences are passing and are only felt occasionally. On the other hand, other meditative experiences are conjoined with what should be cultivated in the meditation (bsgom pa dang 'brel ba). Those are actual experiences (rang nyams) of the nature (ngo bo, *svabhi'iva) of the mind (rang gi sems), of the co-emergent (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja), of the inborn (gnyug ma, *nija), of Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po). This nature is experienced as being without any definable characteristics, without any fixed trait, neither describable as being something nor as not being something.

The meditator is advised to let this presence-emptiness (gsal stong) arise uninter­ruptedly (rgyun chad med par shar) and when this happens, he has achieved the meditation that is conjoined with meditative experience. For the third point, the conduct conjoined with phases (spyod pa dus tshod dang 'brel ba), the segment explains four progressive steps in detail: the conduct of a young monarch to be observed by the beginner (las dang po pas rgyal po gzhon nu'i spyod pa bya), the conduct of Secret Mantra to be observed by the practitioner who is in the process of accomplishing the practice (sgrub pa pos gsang sngags kyi spyod pa), the conduct of the knowledge vow (rig pa brtul zhugs, *vidyiivrata) to be observed by the practitioner who has accomplished the practice (grub pa pos rig pa brtul zhugs kyi spyod pa), and the conduct of great meditative abs orption (mnyam bzhag chen po, *mahiisamiihita) to be observed by the practitioner who possesses knowledge (ye shes can gyis mnyam bzhag chen po'i spyod pa). The explanations thereon provide some details on the more advanced steps of Tantric practice and the precepts (dam tshig, *samaya) to be kept by the yogf. The final part of the segment teaches the fifth and final point, the result conjoined with benefit for others ('bras bu gzhan don dang 'brel ba). It is said that the form bodies (gzugs sku, *rilpakaya) benefiting sentient beings will appear once the practitioner, who has perfected such a view, meditation, and conduct, passes away. The segments ends by admonishing that \"we too\" (rang re rnams kyang) must seek to uphold such a view, [meditation], and conduct.

The term is said to signify that the mind (shes pa, *jiiiina) is not contaminated (ma bslad pa) by any kind of phenomenon (chos kyi rnam pa, *dharmavidha or eventually *dharmiikiira) or polluted (ma rnyogs pa, *akalu�a) by any mundane consciousness ('jig rten gyi rnam par shes pa, *lokavijfiiina). This implies that the mind remains in its natural condition (rang sor gzhag pa), unaffected (ma gtum par) by any [meditative flaw of] torpor (hying, *laya), dullness (rmugs, *styiina), or thought (rtog pa, *saf!!kalpa). To recognize this is to see the mind as the knowledge of self-awareness (rang gi rig pa'i ye shes). As long as this is not recognized, one remains stuck in the naturally occuring innate ignorance (lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa, *sahajiividya). It is then explained at length how the realization of the natural mind surpasses any form of book-learning (pa7J4i ta 'i rig pa'i gnas Inga la mkhas pa), any kind of achievement in the absorption of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas kyi ting nge 'dzin, *§amathasamiidhi), and any visionary 727 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.43i14-44bi, DK.B.Nya.12.13a1-14a4, DK.D.Nya.12.13b3-15ai, DK.P.Nya.12. 1 98ar 199b1, DK.Q.Nya.12. l 73br l 74b4, DK.R.Nya.12.22i14-24a6, DK.S.Nya.12.22 bs-25a3, DK.T.Nya.12 pp. lOn-l l 14.

On the one hand, the view should be free from joy when his philosophical position (grub mtha', *siddhiinta) agrees with that of others as well as free from fear when it does not. On the other hand, his view should be without expectations (snyam pa) about which results will be achieved from the practice. Thereupon, it is explained how his meditation (sgom pa, *bhavanii) ought not to be strictly divided into three phases (go rim, *anukrama) consisting of a preparatory phase (sbyor ba, *p rayoga), an actual meditation session (dngos gzhi, *maula), and a post­meditative phase (rjes, *pr�_tha). Instead, he should strive to rest in a stream of meditation employing the river-flow yoga (chu bo rgyun gyi rn al 'byor, *anusrotayoga). His conduct (spyod pa, *carya) ought not in any way to be segregated into phases of before and after (snga phyi, *p firvapara) and he should neither strive to abandon nor to cultivate anything. Finally, the result ('bras bu, *p hala) he achieves should be completely free of hope (re ba, *iisii) for buddhahood and fear (dogs pa, *smikii) of sm!isiira.

There are three basic meditative experiences, viz. bliss (bde ba, *sukha), presence (gsal ba, *vyakti or *vispa.Jfa), and non-thought (mi rtog pa, *nirvikal pa). If the meditator becomes attached to any of these meditative experiences and considers them special , he risks being reborn respectively in the desire realm ('dod khams, *kiimadhiitu), the material realm (gzugs khams, *rupadhiitu), or the immaterial realm (gzugs med khams, *iirilpya­dhiitu) and subsequently remains bound in sw71siira. These are the three pitfalls of meditative experience. Moreover, the practitioner may also misunderstand (shor ba) the view of emptiness. For one, he may think that there are no karmic consequences, since everything is empty and liberated from the beginning, and that it therefore makes no sense to engage in positive behavior. This is to misunderstand emptiness as the nature of phenomena (stong pa nyid shes hya 'i gshis la shor ba). Further, the meditator may neglect applying remedies against the afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, *kle§a), since he thinks they are anyway empty of an independent nature. Such behavior, however, will fail to eliminate the afflictive emotions and that would be to misunderstand emptiness as a remedy (stong pa nyid gnyen par shor ba). Another error is first to engage in some virtuous activity while thinking of this as real and only subsequently to apply the notion of emptiness in a retrospective manner. This is to misunderstand emptiness as a means of enhancing activities (stong pa nyid rgyas 'debs su shor ba). Finally, some do not realize that the cause, path, and result have one and the same nature, but instead think that by having meditated on emptiness during the path, they will achieve the result of buddhahood. This, however, is to misunderstand emptiness as the path (stong pa nyid lam du shor ha). The segment presents each of these problems in some detail and admonishes the practitioner to avoid them.

He must accept the bare necessities when it comes to food and clothes, and he must stay in the mountain wilderness (ri khrod, >rp arvatakandara or *ara!Jya or *vana). The best meditator hermits stay like snow-lions in the snowy regions (seng ge bzhin du gangs la song), the middling ones live like Bengal tigers in the forest (rgya stag bzhin du nags la song), while lesser ones stay like vultures in the rocks (bya rgod bzhin du brag la song).

The segment includes quotations from Asvagho�a's Fifty Stanzas on the Guru (bla ma Inga bcu pa, *gurupaiicafikii) and another unspecified source. The explanations also give a passing reference to how Naropa had to undergo twelve trials by his teacher (bla ma n'a ro pas dka ba bcu gnyis spyad pa). The segment ends with the general colophon for the text, which states (quoted in Ti­betan above): \"The sayings (gsung sgros) of the precious master, put in writing by the monk Shes rab gzhon nu, are finished. May it be good! May it be auspicious!\" The colophon thus identifies the speaker of the teachings contained in the text as being \"the precious master (rje rin po che), presumably denoting Bsod nams rin chen. The sayings were written down by his student, the monk (dge slang, *bhik�u) Shes rab gzhon nu, who -as menti oned above -can be identified as one of Bsod nams rin chen's attendants (nye gnas, *anteviisin or *anteviisika). 734 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.48b4-49a6, DK.B.Nya. 19.18b1-19a5, DK.D.Nya.19. 19a6-20a3, DK.P.Nya.19.204br205a6, DK.Q.Nya.19. l 78b6-l 79b2, DK.R.Nya.19.3 lb5-33ao, DK.S.Nya. 19.32bs-34a3, DK.T.Nya.19 pp. 1429-1514.

Dags po 'i bka' 'bum: Answers to Questions (Zhus lan) The third group of texts in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum is a set of four works (texts Ta-Na) belonging to the literary genre of \"Answers to Questions\" (zhus Zan or zhu Zan). These works are highly composite, containing an array of different materials that have been compiled together. Their sundry nature is though not revealed by the given titles of the works, according to which each text simply contains the questions of one particular student along with Bsod nams rin chen's answers to these. It should here be stressed that the general titles of texts given in ms DK.A and its apographs are not reflected in the older ms DK.a., which does not contain any titles at the beginning of texts but which only has titles provided occasionally in the colophons of some text. The same colophons also occur in DK.A. It therefore seems that the overall text titles at the beginning of works were newly introduced when the first printed edition, i.e., ms DK.A, was redacted and produced.735 The concept of zhus Zan as a written work must have been a new genre in the twelfth century, and the zhus Zan texts of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum are among the earliest known Tibetan works of the genre.736 The genre has, however, a prototype in the form of at least one of two canonical zhus Zan ('rprafnottara) works included in the Peking, Snar thang, and Golden Manuscript bstan 'gyurs. The first is the DpaZ sa ra ha dang mnga' bdag mai tri pa'i zhu ba zhus Zan (*Srfsarahaprabhumaitrf-piidaprafnottara, Q5048, 2 folios) composed by an anonymous author. The text records questions put by Maitripa to Saraha in the exact same format seen in later Tibetan works of the Zhus Zan genre. It may thus have been a prototype for later Tibetan works of this genre, unless the bstan 'gyur text rather is a Tibetan apocryphal work composed after the second half of the twelfth century, which is a distinct possibility. The second canonical text is the Rdo rj e sems dp a'i zhus Zan slob dp on dp aZ dbyangs gyis mdzad pa (*Vaj rasattvaprafnottara, Q5082, 7 folios) composed by Sri Gho�a (dpaZ dbyangs). The latter work is a small treatise in verse on the meaning of deity Vajrasattva, which is heavily annotated with interlinear notes (mchan bu). The treatise does not reflect the typical question-answer format indicated by the verb \"asked\" (zhus pa), which is a defining feature in the later Tibetan works of the zhus Zan genre. The four zhus Zan texts of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum are compilations of questions sup­posed to have been presented orally by some of Bsod nams rin chen's closest students, along with Bsod nams rin chen's oral answers to these questions. The questions posed by the students reveal no particular structure, which means that these texts cover a lot of different topics, especially practical questions concerning how to combine different types of meditation practice, although a few more philosophical and doctrinal questions also are raised with regard to Bsod nams rin chen's teachings. Consequently, the texts provide a 735 For a detailed discussion of the editorial changes introduced while preparing the first print, including the creation of text titles, see KRAGH (2013c). 736 The medieval Tibetan zhus !an geme bears some similarity to the medieval Latin Christian genre of quaestio texts ('questions'), which emerged around the same time in twelfth-century Europe in connection with the study of the writings of Saint Augustine.

The text has no overall colophon, but four of its six segments have individual colophons clarifying the authorship of each part. It is notable that it is only the text's first segment that is structured as a question-and-answer exchange between Bsgom pa Tshul khrims snying po and Bsod nams rin chen, as reflected in the title of the work. The three subs equent segments instead contain teachings given by Tshul khrims snying po himself, while the fifth and sixth segments consist of sayings attributed to \"the precious master\" (rje btsun rin po che). These sayings turn out to be exact copies of two segments from Tshogs chos text Nya. It may be reiterated that S gom pa Tshul khrim snying po (1116-1169) was the elder of Bsod nams rin chen's two nephews born to Bsod nams rin chen's elder brother Rgya pa Se re. Tshul khrims snying po was instated as Bsod nams rin chen's main lineage-holder and the abbot of the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage in 1145, i.e., eight years before Bsod nams rin chen's death, and his abbacy lasted till his own death in 1169.737 Segment DK.A.Ta.1: The segment begins (DK.A.Ta. l.lb1): /b la ma rin po che la skyabs su 'chi 'o/ !byin gyi blab tu gsol lo/ In ga bo gang yin zhus pas/.

The segment ends with a colophon, wherein the segment's title is first given as \"Thorough investigation of the essence through questions to the precious bla ma along with [his] answers, eliminating treacherous passages in all meditative experiences and realizations\" (bla ma rin po che la ngo bo'i gdar sha gcod pa zhus Zan dang bcas pal nyams rtogs thams cad kyi phrang sel bar byed pa). Later in the same colophon, the text is also referred to as \"Questions and answers by master Sgam po pa and master Bsgom tshul\" (rje sgam po pa dang/ rj e bsgom tshul gyis zhus Zan). It is not immediately clear from this title whether the questions contained in the text were posed by master Bsgom tshul and answered by master Sgam po pa, or whether the questions were 737 See S0RENSEN & DOLMA (2007:47). 738 Correlated passages: D K.a.Kha.203a5-2 l Oa3, D K.B.

Furthermore, the colophon establishes that the text was written by Lang ban Dharma Kumara at an unnamed mountain hermitage (fang ban dharma ku ma ras/ ri khrod dgon par bris pa'o/I). Lang ban Dharma Kumara is not a known student of either Bsod nams rin chen or Bsgom tshul. The epithet Lang ban may indicate that he was a monk (ban de)739 from the Lang clan. Since the colophon does not mention any notes or oral transmission on the part of Bsgom tshul, it remains unexplained how Dharma Kumara could have compiled a text containing questions supposedly posed by Bsgom tshul along with Sgam po pa's answers. Perhaps this problem indicates that the questions, in fact, were posed by Dharma Kumara himself to Sgam po pa and Bsgom tshul, and that Dharma Kumara thereafter noted down his questions with their answers. It is also clear that the eclectic order of the questions does not reflect a polished and finely redacted arrangement. This might indicate that the text does not represent a memorized oral transmission but rather a collection of haphazardly written notes. The introductory sentence at the beginning of the segment states that the overall theme of the questions is the 'appearance', 'nature', or 'essence' [of the mind] (ngo bo, *nlpa), and that the author wrote down the text not to forget the obtained answers. Indeed, most of the questions pertain directly or indirectly to the topic of ngo bo. Some of these address ngo bo as the nature of consciousness or awareness. Other questions relate to the nature of thoughts and the objects of the mind. The topic of ngo bo is also approached philosophically as well as doxographically with questions about the relationship between the mind and emptiness, the teaching that everything is only mind (*cittamatra), and the relationship between the essence (ngo bo) and the latent-consciousness (kun gzhi rn am shes, *alayavijfiana). One of the doxographic answers includes a general reference to the views presented in Rdzogs chen and Mahamudra teaching. Other questions concern meditation practice, how to dwell in the essence, and what effects this has in the form of accomplishments (dngos grub, *siddhi). In one answer, a short story is narrated about a student from the province of Gtsang, who was told to do a purification practice consisting in copying the Heart &itra (shes rab snying po) multiple times. The relationship between meditating on the ngo bo and doing yogic practices, such as gtum mo, is also probed in several questions. A clarification is sought on the nature of the inner wisdom-winds (ye shes kyi rlung, *jiianavayu), purification of the activity-winds (las kyi rlung, *karmavaya), and the effects this has on the experience of the interim (bar do, *antarabhava) between death and rebirth. Some questions directly concern the yogic practices of Inner Heat (gtum mo), Radiance ('ad gsal), and the Interim (bar do), e.g., queries about the difference between gentle and forced breathing techniques ('jam rlung and rtsub rlung). In one answer, a short explanation of the process of dying is given with reference to teachings by Bla ma Mar pa, Mi la ras pa, and 739 The word ban de may be taken as a Tibetanized form of the Sanskrit word vandya, \"reverend,\" (NATTIER, 1988:218 n. 24; RICHARDSON, 1992:106), or, perhaps better, of the respectful Sanskrit epithet bhadanta possibly via an intermediate Prakrt or Apabhramfa form resembling the Pali equivalent bhante (NATTIER, ibid.)."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"304 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum \"all the Bka' gdams pa bla mas.\" When discussing the signs of successful practice, a reference is given to the (five) treatises of Maitreya (byams chos). Moreover, there are also questions of more pragmatic character, such as queries about which kind of retreat place is better, how one should nourish oneself in the wilderness by relying on vitality practices (bcud Zen, *rasiiyana), how to live on the nourishment of samiidhi, how to deal with ghosts while staying in solitude, and whether it is advisable to meditate with open or closed eyes. The segment ends with a passage, wherein Bsod nams rin chen states to Tshul khrims snying po that the latter has now cleared all his doubts, that there is nothing more to learn, and that from now on he should rely solely on his own meditative experience. The segment concludes with the colophon described above. Segment DK.A.Ta.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Ta.2.8a1): dags po bsgom tshul gyis bu chen dam pa phag bsgom gyi zhal nas/. It ends (DK.A.Ta.2.8b1): yags su re ba'i skyid skyid po cig la blo gtad pas mi yang ba yin no gsung/740 According to the second segment's opening phrase (quoted in Tibetan above), the segment contains a saying by Dam pa Phag bsgom (dates unknown), who was a major student (bu chen, lit. \"a great son\") of Dags po Bsgom tshul (a.k.a. Tshul khrims snying po). The saying, whose extent is a mere few lines, is a brief statement on the need for the hermit practitioner to turn the mind away from the present life, give up all hope for comforts and good food, accept the life of a beggar (phugs sp rang), and only be concerned with the welfare of sentient beings.

The poem admonishes the listener not to forget to think of the body of visualized deities (lha sku) as being illusory, always to have devotion for the teacher, to look nakedly (gcer mthong) at the unborn nature (rang bzhin skye med 'ad gsal), and not to lose the meditative experience (chos nyid kyi nyams) during daily activities (spyod pa).

The poem describes different ways of resting in medition (gzhag, *[sam]iihita).

According to the segment's internal colophon, the segment is called \"Answers to Questions between Rin po che Sgam po pa and Rin po che 'Tshur phu ba\" (rin po che sgam po pa dang/ rin po che 'tshur phu ba gnyis kyi zhu ba zhus !an). The name 'Tshur phu ba means \"the one from 'Tshur phu,\" where 'Tshur phu is a toponym that here seems to be an orthographic variant of Mtshur phu. The epithet probably refers to the first Karma pa Dus gsum mkhyen pa (1110-1193), who in early sources also is known by the nickname \"the grey-head from Khams\" (khams pa dbu se). In 1189, Dus gsum mkhyen pa founded Mtshur phu monastery (mtshur phu dgon) in the Stod lung valley northwest of Lha sa, which hypothetically might be a reason for referring to him by the title 'Tshur phu ba. It is not clear whether the text was written by 'Tshur phu ba himself or by someone else, but the questions posed here are of a very personal character. In fact, most of the questions can hardly be called \"questions\" as such; rather, they are brief descriptions of concrete meditation experiences, each followed by a clarifying response by the meditation teacher. The first question describes how an experience of intense presence or clarity (gsal ba, *vyakti) arose some days after having received an instruction from the teacher. In the answer, the speaker makes use of the term \"white panacea\" (dkar po cig thub), which later became significant in the context of Sa skya Pai:i<;lita's critique of the Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii system.746 A second reference to the same term reappears later in the text. Thereafter, the speaker describes that he had to leave his meditation retreat in order to gather alms, since he had run out of food and did not meet the teacher for three months. Meanwhile, the teacher was staying at a cliff crevice in '01 ka. This is notable, because if the teacher in question is Bsod nams rin chen as the colophon indicates, then this remark suggests that in the years after Bsod nams rin chen began to give teachings to various disciples in 1121 and onwards, he apparently did not spend all his time at the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage, but he also went elsewhere for meditation retreats, such as the neighboring '01 ka region. The speaker first met the teacher in '01 ka and thereupon began his meditation practice. Quickly a pure meditative experience of bliss (bde ba), presence (gsal ba), and non-thought (mi rtog pa) appeared, which he inquired about with the teacher. In a long series of questions, the reader can follow how the speaker's meditation experi­ences developed step-by-step. Many experiences concern the feeling that everything is mind only (sems tsam, *cittamiitra) and how this feeling affected his perception of reality . 745 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.9 la1-96b4, DK.B.Tha.1.1 b1-6b5, DK.D.Tha.1.1bi-7as, DK.P.Tha. 1.214b3-220a1, DK.Q.Tha. l.l 87b6-l 93a3, DK.S.Tha.1.1 b1-12a3, DK.T.Tha. l pp. 13-520.

In a few passages, 'Tshur phu ba tries to clarify whether his experiences correspond to specific Buddhist terms, such as the notions of Radiance ('od gsal, *prabhiisvara) and dharmakiiya (chos sku). Many questions deal with the fluctuation of meditative experiences and how to deal with that issue. Several of the answers given in response thereto speak about the positive or negative effects that the movement of the inner winds (rlung, *viiyu) has on the meditation experience. In one such case, the teacher instructs the student in a concrete yoga exercise ('khruZ 'khor) in order to eliminate a negative development in the winds. In one seance, the speaker describes how he felt like laughing uncontrollably in the middle of the night, causing others sleeping around him to wake up, while in another question he describes visions that arose in him of the hell-realms and the sufferings of the hungry ghosts. In each case, Bsod nams rin chen instructs his student how to turn these experiences into the meditative path. Two questions address the issue of minor illnesses that appeared during the retreat, and Bsod nams rin chen explains how to dissolve these obstacles. The segment ends with the colophon quoted above.

The answer to the first question is introduced by the phrase \"the master said\" (rje btsun gyi zhaZ nas), but who the master is remains unspecified. The segment begins with a short verse that in a sense reveals the character of a text of the zhus Zan genre. The verse says: \"In the hermitage moistened by blessing, wind entered the locality of the true nature -the central channel -whereby I saw the meaning of the inseparability of non-thought, bliss, and presence. I then inquired (zhus) with the bla ma master about my realization of its meaning.

The student has then noted down the master's answers in order not to forget them. It is generally the case that it is the compila­tion of such questions and answers that makes up a text of the \"Answers to Questions\" genre (zhus Zan). 747 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.128a5-132bs, DK.B.Tha.2.6b5-10h DK.D.Tha.2.7a5-l l bi, DK.P.Tha.2.220b1-225ai, DK.Q.Tha.2.193a4-l 97 /8a1 (doubly paginated folio), DK.S.Tha.2.12a3-19b4, DK.T.Tha.2 pp. 520-833.

In this segment, the questions are clearly formulated as questions and they constitute a well-connected series. The first question concerns a vi sion the speaker had. The teacher answers that this was caused by the inner winds entering the central channel. This leads to a series of questi ons concerning gtum mo practice and the manipulation of the winds. The answers lead the interlocutor to begin a series of questions about the yogic practice of Transference ('pho ba, *sarrzkriinti), i.e., the yoga of ejecting the consciousness out of the body into Awakening or into a pure land (dag pa'i zhing khams), being a practice that is to be carried out at the time of death. Having discussed the yogic approach of dying in this manner, the questions thereafter turn to address the issue of the interim (bar do, *antariibhava) between death and future rebirth. The answers contain quite detailed explanations on the process of dying. The latter set of questions and answers includes references to a number of teachers, including Rngog Jo sras pa, Naropa, Bla ma Ti phu pa, Bla ma A dul Vajra, as well as to the Abhidharmako§abhii�ya's explanations on the antarii\" bhava (bar do).749 As mentioned above, the segment ends with the ultra-short colophon \"Answers to Questions\" (zhus Ian ifhi//).

Although it mentions a path beginning with study (thos bsam, *fruticinte) of the Buddhist teachings as one possible approach, it also emphasizes the option of not engaging in study and reflection but instead achieving realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha) by meeting an authentic bla ma and relying on his oral instruction (gdams ngag, *avavada).757 Moreover, in terms of engaging in practice, the segment mentions various points that it considers crucial to include in the practice, namely fully abandoning worldly thoughts ('jig rten pa'i rtog pa), forgetting about all the intellectual notions taught in the doctrinal texts (bstan bcos, *sastra) since too many ideas may turn good qualities into weaknesses (yon tan skyon du 'gyur ba), relying on the teacher's blessing, cutting the ties to this life, knowing that all forms of rebirth involve suffering, never to let go of feeling kindness, compassion and the resolve for Awakening towards all sentient beings, giving rise to the contemplative paths of tranquility (gzhi gnas, *.§amatha) and insight (lhag mthong, *vipasyana), and feeling gratitude towards the teacher.

It begins by praising the Bka' gdams Mind Training teachings (blo sbyong) used for engender­ing bodhicitta, which are said to bring benefit even if the practitioner is unable to realize the original nature (gnyug ma, *nija). The character of the original nature is then described and the method to realize it is said to be the practice of Inner Heat (gtwn mo). Thereupon follows a brief explanation on the four yogas (rnal 'byor bzhi) of Mahiimudrii, whereafter it is specified how the result arises for practitioners of various capabilities, either by reaching the result in the present life, in the interim (bar do, *antariibhava), or in a future life. Questions are raised about the difference between a completely perfect Buddha's realization and the realization reached by a yogi meditating with these techniques, and how this relates to the Mahiiyiina notion that complete buddhahood takes three uncountable aeons to attain. The explanation of the latter point is supported by several scriptural quotations. The stages of Tantric practice are briefly explained, whereafter the speaker presents the eight signs of accomplishment (yon tan brgyad), starting with the smoke-like sign (rtags du ba). The explanation, however, ends abruptly with the fifth sign, leaving the sixth to the eighth signs unexplained. At this point, a new explanation begins on the different stages (lam rim) of the Mahiiyiina Piiramitii path, followed by a similar survey of the Guhyamantra path covering the empowerments, the Generation and Completion Stage practices, and the various accomplishments to be achieved.759 Thereupon follows a discussion of phenomena and their nature, illustrated through several analogies. Next, the meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought are compared in terms of how they are taught and practiced by those holding the teaching-transmission of Ati:Sa (jo bo rj e'i bka ' brgyud 'dzin pa rnams), the Guhyamantra practitioners (gsang sngags pa), and Mi la ras pa, being a passage which includes several quotations, possibly from Mi la ras pa. A question is raised concerning where the root of sa17isiira and nirvii�ia should be cut. The answer discusses knowledge (rig pa, *vidyii) and ignorance (ma rig pa, *avidyii), and goes on to explain the appearance (ngo bo, *rupa), nature (rang bzhin, *svabhiiva), and character (mtshan nyid, *lak�a(w) of the mind. Then different attitudes toward establishing the view (!ta ba, *d.r�.ti) of the Bka' gdams tradition and of Mi la ras pa's approach are compared, which includes a brief doxographical discussion of the different schools of Mahayana philosophy and a mention of the seven Siddhi texts (grub pa sde bdun).760 This leads to a presentation of the nature of thoughts (rnam rtog, *vikalpa) with a distinction being made between the intellect (yid, *manas), knowledge (rig pa, *vidyii), the mind (sems, *citta), and wind (rlung, *viiyu). The segment ends with a brief discussion of the need for secrecy. There is no colophon. 758 Correlated passages: DK.a. Kha. l 39b5- l 44b2, D K.B. Tha. 9. l 6a3-20b2, DK.D.

A question is then put to [Dge bshes] Mar yul ba [Blo ldan shes rab] regarding the paths of the Piiramitiis and the Guhyamantra approaches. The answer uses the term rnam thar in the sense of liberation path and provides a rather detailed description of different types of conduct related to progressively higher levels of realization. This is following by a discussion of the differ­ences between the Piiramitii and Guhyamantra traditions. The passage also includes the distinction of three paths seen in DK.A.Cha.23, namely \"using inference as the path\" (rjes dpag lam du byed pa), \"using blessing as the path\" (byin brlabs lam du byed pa), and \"using direct experience as the path\" (mngon sum lam du byed pa). Another distinction of three paths is presented next, which was also taught in DK.A.Cha.6, viz. \"the path of abandoning the basis\" (gzhi spong ba'i lam), \"the path of transforming the basis\" (gzhi bsgyur ba'i lam), and \"the path of knowing the basis\" (gzhi shes pa'i lam). The latter is here only identified as Mahiimudrii and not as either Mahiimudrii or Rdzogs pa chen po as seen in DK.A.Cha.6. Finally, the three paths are distinguished with regard to the practitioner's differing degrees of aptitude. Then follows an explanation on Samatha and vipasyanii meditation, where each is taught in terms of its causes (rgyu), function (las), hindrances (gegs), obscurations (sgrib pa), and perfection (lam yangs su dag pa). Various potential flaws in the cultivation of emptiness are laid out, including an explanation on the four misunderstandings of emptiness (shor ba bzhi).762 Quotations are here provided from an unspecified Doha poem and from Mi la ras pa. The segment ends with an elucidation of the authentic, unmis taken understanding of emptiness (stong pa nyid ma nor ba rnal ma). It is said that emptiness designates the original nature (gnyug ma, *nijasm?1vid) of the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittatii) and the original nature is then laid out using the same six comments that are attested in segment DK.A.Cha.13, viz. \"it is not supported by any base\" (rten gang la yang mi bca' ba), etc.7 63 Additionally, the present segment discusses how realization of this nature is inexpressible, inter alia illustrating this with the analogies of the indescribable pleasure experienced by a virgin [having sex for the first time] (gzhon nu ma 'i bde ba myong ba) and a dream dreamt by a mute (lkugs pa'i rmi lam).

The segment opens with an inquiry into the mind (sems, *citta) and the light of the mind (sems kyi 'od, *cittabhiisa). The interlocutor asks whether it is right that these two notions do not form a duality, and the lecturer answers in the affirmative, saying that everything is mind only (sems gcig pu). This prompts the interlocutor to ask a similar question with regard to dhannakaya (chos sku) and the light of dharmakaya (chos sku'i 'od). The discussion turns to the ontological status and cause-effect relationship of the manifesta­tions of enlightenment in the form of emanation bodies (sprul sku, *nirmiiftakiiya) and enjoyment bodies (longs sku, *sm?ibhogakaya). The lecturer here makes a reference to the opinions held by the earlier Bka' gdams pa Dge bshes-s (dge bshes bka ' gdams pa rnams snga ma) and by \"our later bla mas\" ('o skol gyi bla ma phyi ma). Thereupon, the question­answer exchange turns to address matters of meditation (bsgom, *bhiivanii) and distraction (yengs pa, *vik�epa), and whether or not distractions necessarily are negative for the meditation. The answer includes a longer explanation of realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha), the vajra-body (rdo rj e'i sku, *vajrakiiya), and the unchanging nature of the ultimate (mi 'gyur ba, *nirvikiira). The theme of meditative experience (nyams myong, *anubhata) is brought up at this point in order to clarify how one may avoid mishandling various experiences. A new discussion of the unborn begins, wherein doctrinal distinctions are made with regard to the Piiramitii and Guhyamantra approaches, also mentioning the traditions of Naropa and Maitrlpa (n'a ro pa'i lugs and mai tri pa 'i lugs). The segment ends with a discussion of vows in connection with higher realization, including references to the views of Dge bshes Sgre pa, Bia ma Mar pa, and Rin po che (presumably Bsod nams rin chen).

It commences by stating that the best practiti oners attain buddhahood in the bar do by relying on Radiance ( 'od gsal), the middling ones attain it by the Illusory Body (sgyu lus), while the lesser ones attain it by managing to block their entry into the womb (mngal sgo bkag nas). These three approaches are then briefly explained. 764 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.148br 152a5, DK.B.Tha. l l.24a1-27a6, DK.D.Tha.l l.25bz-29a2, DK.P.Tha.l l.240ar244b5, DK.Q.Tha.l l.211�-214bi, DK.S.Tha. l l.45b4-52a3, DK.T.Tha.11 pp. 2020-2315.

The latter, on the other hand, denotes those whose intermittent meditative experiences (nyams myong, *anubhitta) may still lead to conceptual notions concerning whether these experiences are there or not, which in turn leads to the risk of being reborn in a lower sm71saric existence, in the meditative material or immaterial realms (gzugs khams gzugs med khams), or of entering the cessation of nirvii(W ('gag pa, *nirodha) and thus no longer being able to benefit sentient beings. Such practitioners must learn to see thoughts as emanating ( 'phro ba, *visarm:za) out of the nature of the mind, and detailed practical advice is here given on how to do so. Thereupon, the segment explains the realizations achieved by persons of different apti­tudes who practice the Generation and Completion Stages of the Guhyamantra approach. This is followed by an advice stressing the importance -in the context of Bka' gdams pa practice -of understanding the teaching on the three persons (skyes bu gsum) and the associated principles of kindness, compassion, and bodhicitta. Cultivation of these instructions must be followed by contemplating impermanence and action and result, which are briefly explained according to the different levels of understanding. In this manner, the stages of the path (lam rim) should be cherished. The segment here quotes a line attributed to Vajradhara (rdo rj e 'chang) derived from the Sm71pu_tatantra along with lines from a poem by Rnal 'byor pa, which are nearly identical to the same lines attested and explained in segment DK.A.Cha.11.76 7 It is said that someone, who has achieved a direct experience of the original nature of the mind, risks sliding back into saryisara due to attachment to places, people, and things if he does not cultivate the above-mentioned attitudes resulting from the lam rim practices. 766 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha. 152b5-157b1, DK.B.Tha. 13.27b5-3 l b6, DK.D.Tha.13.29br 33b5, DK.P.Tha.13.245a7-250ai, DK.Q.Tha.13.215a1-218b5, DK.S.Tha.13.53a1-60bi, DK.T.Tha.13pp. 2323-2h Also found in Rtsib ri 'i par ma vol.

In this way, a strong emphasis is laid on these basic teachings.7 68 Next, an explanation on the original nature (gnyug ma) is given, explained with regard to its appearance (ngo ho), result ('bras bu), and cause (rgyu).769 Following this, the meditation stages of famatha (zhi gnas) and vipasyanii (lhag mthong) are elucidated, parti­cularly in terms of the signs of realization that appear, such as \"the smoke-like\" sign (du ha !ta bu), the sign \"like fire-flies\" (srin bu me khyer lta bu), etc. This segues into a teaching on the four cakras ('khor lo rnam bzhi) and the yogas of Inner Heat (gtum 1110), sleep (gnyid), dream (rmi lam), and abs orption (snyom 'jug, *samiipatti). Here, the central chan­nel is compared to a wish-fulfilling tree (dpag bsam gyi shing), while the \"king of the mind\" (sems kyi rgyal po, *cittariijan) named Tilaka is said to reside in the city of the navel cakra, and so forth.

Short definitions of the terms \"thing\" (dngos po, *bhiiva), \"appearance\" (ngo bo, *rupa), and \"character\" (mtshan nyid, *lak�my,a) are given , which is followed by yet another explanation on \"experienced and certain\" (snang la nges pa) and \"experienced but uncertain\" (snang la ma nges pa). The phrase \"gaining skill in samiidhi\" (ting nge 'dzin la rtsal sbyong) is explained, whereupon the Mahamudrii terms \"natural mind\" (tha mal gyi shes pa), \"uncontrived\" (ma bcos pa), and \"original nature\" (gnyug ma) are explicated. A verse is then quoted from the Sal'!idhininnocanasutra regarding the appropriating consciousness (Zen pa'i rnam par shes pa, *iidiinavijniina) and seeds (sa ban, *bfja), followed by exegesis of individual words from the verse. Finally, the two terms \"sphere\" (dbyings, *dhatu) and \"knowledge\" (ye shes, *j niina)770 are explained, along with pheno­menon (chos, *dharma), phenomenon-possessor (chos can, *dharmin, here understood as the consciousness perceiving the phenomenon), and phenomenon as such (chos nyid, *dharmatii).

If that is so, this, in turn, could explain the presence of eventual rdzogs chen influences on Bsod nams rin chen's teachings and his subsequent tradition, given that Rgya Yon bdag was the latter's main teacher from the Bka' gdams pa tradition throughout several years.

JACKSON (1994:35-36 with fn. 81) has quoted this passage in Tibetan and provided a paraphrased outline of the mentioned schools. It seems, however, that JACKSON takes the list to be asserted by Sgam po pa and thus writes that the \"enumeration does not include sGam-po-pa's own Great Seal\", in spite of the fact that the passage explicitly is attributed in the segment to Dge bshes Rgya Yon bdag, as it indeed also appears in the Tibetan text quoted by JACKSON. JACKSON's reading subsequently leads him to use the passage as part of his larger argument saying that Sgam po pa considered his Mahiimudra approach to be superior even to other contemporary Tibetan Buddhist schools. 774 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.158b3-159bi, DK.B.Tha.16.33a1-33b5, DK.D.Tha.16.34b6-35b4, DK.P.Tha. 16.25la3-25lb1, DK.Q.Tha.16.219b5-220b2, DK.S.Tha.16.62bi-64a2, DK.T.Tha. 16pp. 281.2 6· Also found in Rtsib ri 'i par ma vol.

With the third path being Mahamudra, David P. JACKSON (1994:25 fn. 61 and fn. 62) has cited the passage of the"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 317 There are two types of individuals who embark on these paths (lam gsum la 'jug pa'i gang zag), namely the one [who arrives] gradually [at the goal] (rims kyis pa) and the one [arrives] instantly (cig char ba). The instant approach is defined and stated to be exceed­ingly difficult, and it is said that Sgam po pa pronounced himself to be a gradualist (bla ma 'i zhal nas nga ni rim gyis par 'dad pa yin gsung). Up to this point, the present segment is strongly reminiscient of segment DK.A.Cha.23, but with enough variants in the wording to consider the two segments as being distinct. The segment carries on with a story, in which Bsod nams rin chen asks Mi la ras pa what Rdzogs chen is like (rdzogs chen 'di ci tsug lags zhus pas). After a reference to Mar pa, Mi la ras pa answers the question by comparing Rdzogs chen practice to a five-year-old boy (byis pa lo lnga tsam lon pa zhig) who claims that he is as strong as a twenty-five-year-old adult (skyes bu lo nyi shu rtsa lnga lon pa'i nus pa yod).776 This is followed by a brief statement written in a highly colloquial Tibetan style, attributed to Bsod nams rin chen's main Bka' gdams teacher Rgya Yon bdag. The main point of the saying is that the very search for the ultimate is in itself sary1saric, which the segment follows up with some further comments. Overall, the segment contains many vernacularisms. It ends with the colophon: \"[This] was spoken by the master Sgam po pa. [It] is finished\" (lrje sgam po pas gsungs ba 'o// rd zogs sol!). It may be remarked that the colophon in the older handwritten ms a (DK.a.Kha. 159b1) differs slightly: \"The sayings of the master Sgam po pa are finished\" (lrje sgam po pa'i gsung rdzogs'ho//) . Segment DK.A.Tha.17: The segment begins (DK.A.Tha.17.33b6): /b la ma rin po che la phyag 'tshal lo/ /p ha rol tu phyin pa'i lugs kyis/. It ends (DK.A.Tha.17.36a2): lha bsgom mi dgos/ 'ad gsal gyi ngang nas bzlos pa yin gsung ngo/ lz hus lan//.777 Segment seventeen begins by distinguishing the Paramita tradition (pha rol tu phyin pa 'i lugs), the Mantra tradition (sngags kyi lugs), and \"our tradition\" (yu bu'i lugs).778 The latter approach, which is explained in some detail, concerns the appearance of the mind (sems kyi ngo bo, *cittarilpa). It separates the conceptual (rtog pa, *vikalpa) from the non-conceptual, and says that \"although there is nothing to explain to you, you will also not reach the ultimate present segment in order to show that Sgam po pa taught Mahamudra as an approach that was \"quite extrinsic to both non-Tantric Mahayana and Tantra\". JACKSON ( op.cit.:26) has also provided an outline of the three paths. 776 The passage (DK.Q.Tha.16.21 9b-220a, cited by JACKSON as p. 438-439) has been cited and paraphrased by David P. JACKSON (1992: 101-102) as an example of how Sgam po pa \"distanced himself from what he portrays as the more extreme cig-car-ba doctrines of the rDzogs-pa-chen-po.\" Again, JACKSON (1994:30 fn. 71) cited the passage in his 1994 monograph with further discussion of Rdzogs chen import; see. fn. 576 above for details. 777 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.159b,-162a,, DK.B.Tha.17.33b6-36a2, DK.D.Tha.17.35b4-38a2, DK.P.Tha. 17.252a1-254a6, DK.Q.Tha.17.220br222h DK.S.Tha.17.64ar68a3, DK.T.Tha.17 pp. 2826-3020.

At this point, the segment changes its style into a question-answer format with a series of sixteen questions and answers. These questions particularly concern someone meditating on \"the essence\" or \"the appearance\" (ngo bo, *rupa, *bhava or *svabhava) of the mind, the ability to cultivate this practice, and what happens to a practitioner at this stage when he dies. Several questions deal with whether or not he will be able to enter the essence (ngo bo) when he dies. Some questions pertain to the mixing of the essence and meditation (ngo bo dang mnyam bzhag 'dres pa bya ba, *svabhavasamahitavyamifra), as well as the mixing of meditation and post-meditation (mnyam rj es 'dres pa, *samahitapr�fhalabdhavyamifra), particularly when occasional distractions (yengs pa, *vik�epa) arise. In one question, the interlocutor asks the teacher whether he still feels mental discomfort when he becomes sick. Two questions are quite pragmatic; the interlocutor asks whether someone who has constant realization of ultimate bodhicitta (don dam byang chub sems, *paramiirthabodhicitta) still needs to cultivate relative bodhicitta (kun rdzob byang sems, *sa1Jivrttibodhicitta), and further, whether someone meditating only on the essence (ngo bo 'ba' zhig bsgom pa) still ought to practice the Generation Stage (bskyed rim) and recite mantras (bzlas pa). The segment ends with a brief colophon giving the segment's title as: \"Answers to Questions\" (zhus lan).

It ends (DK.A.Tha.18.36a5): lam gyis 'khrul pa sel ba 'oil //rdzogs so//.780 The eighteenth segment gives a brief explanation on the so-called \"four Dharmas of Sgam po pa\" (dags po'i chos bzhi),781 though that term is not used in the segment. The four principles are first presented: (1) to turn [one's] Dharma [practice] to the Dharma (chos chos su 'gro ba), (2) to turn the Dharma into a path (chos lam du 'gro ba), (3) to make the path remove delusion (lam 'khrul pa sel ba), and (4) to let delusion arise as wisdom ('khrul pa ye shes su 'char ba).

This is followed by another statement saying that he has, on the other hand, practiced according to Mi la's command (ngas bla ma'i bka ' bzhin sgrubs) by devoting his whole life to medita­tion.785 The segment thus seems to bring out a difference between Mi la ras pa's and Sgam po pa's communities in terms of their respective attitudes towards secrecy.

Part of the segment (DK.A.Tha.22.37bz5) has an additional parallel in DK.a.Ka.22b2.s. 787 It would seem very likely that the Tibetan phrase, in fact, does not mean the \"freedom\" (mam thar byed pa, *nirmok�wiatii) enjoyed by a wild hare (ri bong, *fafa), but that it rather refers to the well-known liitaka tale (skyes rabs) of the selfless hare (Safajiitaka). This is the Jiitaka story where four animal friends are secretly tested by the God Sakra with regard to their generosity and almsgiving; the hare - having found no food to give away - selflessly offers its own body as a meal to the disguised God and is rewarded by having its image drawn on the moon. While the story's message perhaps tallies well with the basic point of the present passage concerning how to maintain a pure Dharma practice, there would seem to be little connection between the Jiitaka tale and the ensuing sentences in the segment, which stress the importance that the Dhanna practitioner remains free from any ties to a single place (yul gcig), a single benefactor (yon bdag gcig), or a single companion (grogs po gcig), given that companions and loved ones in particular are the root of afflictive emotions (nyon mongs pa'i rtsa ba). The liitaka tale in question does not touch on such points. 788 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha. l 63b4- l 64b3, DK.B.Tha.23.37b6-38b3, DK.D.Tha.23.40a1-40b5, DK.P.Tha.23.256a4-257a2, DK.Q.Tha.23.224ai-224h DK.S.Tha.23.71 b1-73a1, DK.T.Tha.23 pp. 32n5.

In the final part, the Mahamudra realization of the ultimate is presented as being the highest offering (mchod pa'i mchog), the highest confession (bshags pa'i mchog), as being free from the four evils (bdud, *mara), as being the highest means (thabs rnams kyi nang nas kyang mchog).

Segment DK.A.Tha.30 narrates a story of how an unnamed person studied meditation. It begins with an episode taking place while the person was staying at a \"cave hermitage\" (brag phug dgon pa), where the individual in question received an advice from 'Anchorite' (dgon pa ba). Perhaps the famous Bka' gdams pa teacher Dgon pa ha Dbang phyug rgyal mtshan (1016-1082) is here meant, but, if so, it cannot be Bsod nams rin chen who is studying under him, since Bsod nams rin chen was born in 1079 and Dgon pa ba Dbang phyug rgyal mtshan died in 1082. It is instead possible that this part of the story is intended to depict how Dge bshes Rgya Yon bdag studied under Dgon pa ba, since Rgya Yon bdag appears later in the story. Dgon pa ba's advice is quoted in the segment. Thereupon, someone -perhaps Bsod nams rin chen -is instructed in meditation by Slob dp on [Rgya] Yon bdag. After nine months of meditation, the person inquires with the teacher again, who provides further directions. At this point, Slob dp on [Rgya] Yon bdag 798 David P.

It is said that it is rare to be a best or middling person, and this is clarified by present­ing the forms of realizat ions that these two types of practitioners respectively achieve. The realization of the best person is explained as the experience of illusoriness, emptiness, and equanimity. The realization of the middling person is the experience of everything as being an intermediary state (bar do, *antarabhava).

Before starting (dang por), the body and mind should be relaxed (!us sems khong glad pa) without making any effort to achieve anything (rtsol sgrub dang bra! ba). Keeping the eyes open and looking straight ahead, the yo gf first visualizes himself as a deity with the bla ma sitting above his head looking in the same direction as himself. Thereupon (presumably after melting together with the bla ma and dissolving the visualization), the meditator enters a state of spontaneous rest without creating anything. Thoughts are not to be pushed away but should merely be regarded as self-arisen, allowing them to dissolve back into their own essence while remaining in a state of non-duality (gnyis su med pa, *advaya ).

Again citing the Guhyasamiijatantra, the segment also subdivi­des mantras in terms of their internal components. The segment has no colophon.

An advice from an unnamed Bka' gdams pa teacher (bka ' gdams pa'am kha cig) is then paraphrased, saying that a teacher must care for his students even at the cost of his own life, but there is a constant danger of thereby becoming lost in worldly affairs and things. The enjoyable things and personal relations ('du 'dzi, *iimi�a) that some refer to (zer ba) as [the result of] \"beneficence\" (bsod nams, \"\"p u!1ya) are simply the harmful activities of evil influences (bdud kyi las, *miirakannan).

Further, three dharmas to be put into practice (nyams su blang ba 'i chos gsum) are mentioned: at first, the meditator should relax the body and mind in the co-emergent mind as such without any effort or anything to accomplish; in the middle, the meditator should leave the mind in a fresh, non-artificial state free from any doubt; in the end, all sensations should be understood as being unborn.

The illness as such can be analyzed in terms of whence it arises, whether it has any color or shape, etc., and since that it is thereby recog­nized as being unborn, the disease dissolves into reality . Finally, the passage outlines four types of practitioners who use these methods.

A different theme follows, where it is explained that someone who only cares for himself will be unable to bear anything, will always get caught up in a great lie, and faces a big obstacle for developing any positive quality . To avoid this, it is necessary to train the mind and to meditate. To hanker after outer and inner desires is an evil action (bdud kyi las, *miirakarman); not to have devotion for the bla ma is an evil action; not to trust the instructions is an evil action; not to abide in meditative concentration but to be involved in a distracted mind is an evil action; to think in terms of an \"I\" is an evil action; and to be attached to this life is an evil action. The yogi has to put effort into the means (thabs, *upiiya) that reverse these evil actions, which are then explained one by one. The methods in question include contemplating the hell-realms, fostering gratitude towards the bla ma, thinking of the instructions as a medicine for curing oneself, developing better self­reflection, appreciating the benefits of meditative concentration, and seeing the fleeting 818 The colophon seems somewhat corrupt.

Sa171siira and nirvii(W are equal and the meditator needs to realize this Dharma, which is like space. He should rest in the nature of the mind as such, without following any trace of the past, without greeting the future, and without focusing on anything particular in the present. By meditating in this manner, the nature of the mind will appear with clarity and free from thought, just like the deep center of the sky that is free from clouds. The yogi should neither think that it is good to rest therein for a long time nor that it is bad to rest only for a short time. Instead, he should remain inseparable from this state at all times.

May it be auspicious!\" The expression \"the uncle and two nephews\" (khu dbon gsum) is a common way of referring to Bsod nams rin chen and his two nephew lineage-holders. The younger nephew, Aciirya (slob dp on) Bsgom chung, then taught these sayings to Aciirya Bstod lungs pa (elsewhere also spelled Stod lungs pa). In ms a (DK.a.Kha.176b1), the word Dbu se is added after the epithet Bstod lungs pa. Dbu se, meaning \"grey-head\", is the common nickname for the first Karma pa, Dus gsum mkhyen pa.

Bstod lungs (also spelled Stod lungs) is a valley located about 70 kilometers northwest of Lha sa, presently called Stod lung bde chen rdzong (Iha sa khul). The first Karma pa founded Mtshur phu monastery there in 1189, which might be a reason for referring to him as Bstod lungs pa.82 1 Bstod lungs pa then transmitted these sayings to another unnamed person, who only refers to himself as \"me\" (bdag) in the colophon.

The use of the honorific epithets also suggest that the segment does not contain Phag mo gru pa's own notes in a purely unredacted form, since a Tibetan writer normally would never use honorific phrases with regard to himself. Hence, the segment is a text or at least the later redaction of a text written by an anonymous second hand. The segment contains fourteen questions along with Bsod nams rin chen's answers. There seems to be a certain progression in the order of the questions, commencing with inquiries about the onset of the path and ending with questions regarding realization and Awakening. First it is asked how it is best to gather beneficence and which instructions are more profound. The answer to the latter question provides a comparison between the views of the tradition stemming from Ati8a (jo ho rj e'i hrgyud pa'i lugs), of some unnamed masters (la la), and of Ela ma Mi la, along with the speaker's own opinion. This is followed by a question whether it is better first to practice Inner Heat (gtum mo) or Mahiimudrii. 822 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.11 lai-113b5, DK.B.Da.l.lb1-4b4, DK.D.Da.l.lb1-5as, DK.P.Da. l .269a1-272a7, DK.Q.Da. l .235a4-238a3, DK.S.Da. l. lb1-7bs, DK.T.Da. l. lb-5n.

The pertinent line in the text here says, \"Once that [realization beyond all words] has arisen, by knowing one -[like] a white panacea -all becomes liberated, and Buddha is thereby found in oneself. \"827 This passage is followed by five questions about differences, including the difference between Mahamudra (phyag rgya chen po) and the yoga of the co-emergent (than cig skyes sbyor);828 the difference between meditative experience (nyams) and realization (rtogs pa);829 the difference between such realization and the path of seeing (mthong lam, *dar§anamarga);830 the difference of how a sentient being (sems can), a noble one ('phags pa), a yogf (rnal 'byor pa), and a buddha (sangs rgyas) regard sensory experiences (snang ba); and the differences between the yogas of Illusory Body (sgyu lus), Radiance ('od gsal), Union (zung 'jug), and Mahii.mudra (phyag rgya chen po). Thereupon, it is asked when it is suitable to begin acting for the benefit of others by guiding students, 831 followed up by a question about whether Bsod nams rin chen achieved his own realization from gtum mo or Mahamudra practice.

There appears to be no textual basis for BROIDO's opinion. 829 The answer to this question has been translated into English by GUENTHER (1969: 117 fn. 42) and has been cited and paraphrased by MARTIN (1992:247 fn. 22). 830 The answer to this question has been referred to by BROIDO (1985: 13), who saw the complex answer as a way for Bsod nams rin chen to avoid giving Phag mo gru pa a single straightforward definition.

The segment ends with a colophon in verse that states: \"By having asked this jewel­rosary [of questions] regarding key-points to the precious master, the great one of the Rnyi clan, at the Copper Valley hermitage in Sgam po, may all beings unfold the non-dual wisdom. In order to attain the rainbow-body, the dharmakaya, in this life, one must fully cut the rope of worldly concerns for this life and while relying on the teacher and the deity in a place of solitude apply oneself to the non-dual Mahiimudra. For this, there is no need for many an alogies and sophistry.\"83 2 The expression \"the great one of the Rnyi clan\" (rnyi ba chen po) probably refers to Bsod nams rin chen, who hailed from the Rnyi family. The Copper Valley hermitage (yang dgon zangs lung) is the name of a retreat place located in the vicinity of Dwags Iha sgam po.833 Segment DK.A.Da.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Da.2.4bs): lbla ma rin po che la na mo/ lbla ma rad na bdag gi 'khor 'das gnyis rtsad gcod cing/.

It is first taught how the difference between sarpsiira and nirvii(ia really is only a matter of perspective. Then it is said that the practi­tioner should go to a mountain hermitage (ri khrod, *vana), give rise to disenchantment with sm71siira, and consequently strive to attain buddhahood for the benefit of sentient beings. Having visualized his body as a deity and meditated on the bla ma above his head, he should let the mind rest unaffected by thoughts, in a natural state of vivid awareness andpresence. 836 The ensuing explanation elaborates in great detail on the character of such meditation and provides a thorough presentation of the four stages of Mahiimudrii practice called the 832 DK.A.Da. l .4b3.4: sgam po bzangs lung yang dgon du/ /rj e rin po che rnyi ba chen po la/ mdo 'gag rin chen 'phreng ba 'di/ lz hus pas 'gro rnams ma lus pal /g nyis med ye shes rgyas par shog/ !tshe 'dir 'ja ' lus chos sku thob pa la/ ltshe 'di 'i zang zing ltos thag rab sp angs shing/ dben pa'i gnas su bla ma yi dam brten tshul gyis/ /rlung sems gnyis med phyag rgya che la sbyar ba bya! !dpe dang tha snyad mang pos 'di la dgos pa med!/. 833 See S0RENSEN & DOLMA (2007:52). 834 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.113b5-l 15b4, DK.B.Da.2.4bs-6a4, DK.D.Da.2.5as-6b6, DK.P.Da.2.272ar274a2, DK.Q.Da.2.238�-239h DK.S.Da.2.7b5-10h DK.T.Da.2.5n-6b.

The meditator achieves certainty in this ability to rest the mind, but it is not an artificial attempt to block out thoughts. In the yoga free from conceptual proliferation, the meditator trains the mind in presence-emptiness (gsal stong) and thereby understands all phenomena to be mere projections (rnam 'phrul) of the mind. As the mind as such is understood to be unborn, a certainty of everything's innate purity arises. With the yoga of the manifold having a single taste, the sensory experiences of the mind are understood to be the mind's own expression, and even if there is a stirring of various thoughts, the meditator has the certainty that he needs not rely on any remedy, because the experience of thought itself is mind as such, the ultimate reality . Finally, in the yoga of nothing to be meditated upon, all meditative experiences and realizations dissolve into the dimension (dbyings, *dhiitu) of the absolute, and one gains complete certainty of knowing the unaltered natural mind (tha mal gyi shes pa ma bcos pa) to be reality (chos nyid). This is followed by yet another explanation of the certainty gained during the four yogas, employing several analogies for the sake of clarifying the meaning of each. The passage also includes some quotations from the Hevajratantra.840 The segment ends with a colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"[These] 837 This explanation on the four yogas has been summarized in English and quoted in Tibetan by MARTIN (1992:250-251, fn. 33, 35, 39, and 42). 838 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.115b4-l l 8b4, DK.B.Da.3.6�-8b3, DK.D.Da.3.6b6-9b4, DK.P.Da.3.274ai-277ai, DK.Q.Da.3.239b3-242a2, DK.S.Da.3.10b3-15a5, DK.T.Da.3.6b-9b.

Thereupon, the twofold distinction called \"experienced and certain\" (snang la nges pa) and \"experienced but uncertain\" (snang la ma nges pa) is presented (also occurring in DK.A.Tha.13). This is followed by an explanation of a progression of meditative stages, where thoughts are successfully utilized as part of the meditative experience and a focus on illusion is employed to avoid falling into a rebirth in the immaterial realm (gzugs med du skye). The latter is presented with reference to the Generation and Completion Stages of deity-practice (yi dam). Then it is taught how the winds enter the central channel, causing five internal signs (rtags lnga) to appear succes­sively, ultimately leading to the attainment of the kayas and the ability to act for the benefit of sentient beings.

The text is not included in DK.R. 846 The term dohii refers foremost to the songs of the Indian master Saraha compiled into several cycles entitled Dohako�a, although there also exist other dohii texts by other adepts belonging to this literary form in the Tibetan canon. One cycle of Saraha's songs have been translated into English by GUENTHER (1969). A thorough study of the Tibetan reception history of the Dohiiko�a has been written by SCHAEFFER (2005). Further songs of Saraha have been studied and translated by BRAITSTEIN (2013). In its literal sense, the word dohii is the name for a particular form of meter, namely a rhyming couplet with 24 syllables in each line consisting of piidas of 13 and 11 syllables. The form originated in poems written in the Indian vernacular Apabhramfa language, which is the case for the Buddhist examples of the form, and was subsequently used in Hindi and Urdu poetry. 847 For the three textual cycles of the gsar ma skor gsum, see p. 76. 848 BROIDO (1985: 13) has cited Bsod nams rin chen's answers to the questions whether experience and mind are identical or different, and whether the mind as such and things as such are identical or"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"338 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum speaker declares that these categories essentially are one and the same. It is also asked whether sm!isara has a beginning and an end. The majority of the questions, however, concern higher states of meditation practice. The interlocutor inquires whether one should meditate on the appearance (ngo bo) of the mind after one has done away with such categories as experience (snang) and things as such (chos nyid), or object (yul) and subject (yul can). He asks how one should conduct oneself physically when engaging in meditation, whether the yoga of continuity (rgyun gyi rnal 'byor) extends into the state of sleep, whether one should cultivate the four immeasura­ble attitudes (tshad med pa bzhi) as a preliminary, whether one should keep up the vows associated with the ordinary state sullied by afflictions (zag bcas kyi sdom pa) once realization of the essence has appeared, and whether one should cultivate emptiness involving compassion (stong nyid snying rj e can). The replies all pertain to the very advanced practitioner with realization. In the answer to a question about whether one should continue to cultivate the twofold bodhicitta, the rare term \"the unaccountable absolute\" (rnam grangs ma yin pa'i don dam) is used, in all likelihood indicating a reference to Santarak�ita's *Madhyamakalm?ikara, where the term occurs. Other questions raised concern whether the advanced practitioner still needs to gather the two requisites of beneficence and knowledge, whether the form-kayas can still appear if one no longer gathers beneficence, whether such a practitioner still needs to augment the practice of the Generation and Completion Stages of deity practice, whether one must engage in separate meditations on the instructions on the interim (bar do), and what kind of signs of progress on the path should appear now if one is set to attain buddhahood in a single life-time. Finally, it is asked whether wisdom (ye shes, *jfiana) is interrupted or uninterrupted, and whether it is advisable only to meditate on the essence (ngo bo). The segment ends with a short colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"[This] transmission of key-points [in the form of] answers to questions spoken by the precious one (rin po che) without omitting or detracting anything was requested by the Sakya monk (sh'akya'i bande) Rdor rgyal.\" The name Rdor rgyal is an abbreviated form of Rdo rje rgyal po, being Phag mo gru pa's monastic name.

He claims that Sgam po pa refuses to give a direct answer to these questions. That is, however, incorrect.

In other words, the opening sentence of the segment indicates that the present segment does not contain questions asked to Bsod nams rin chen by his student Phag mo gru pa, as is otherwise declared in the overall title of the text in the Dags lha sgam po xylograph (DK.A.Da), i.e., \"Answers to the Questions of Master Phag mo Grub pa\" (Rje phag mo grub pa'i zhus Zan).

The present segment consists of thirteen questions and answers. The majority of the questions concern meditation practice, particularly meditation on the essence (ngo bo bsgom pa, *svabhiivabhiivanii). The interlocutor, for example, asks whether confessional purificatory practices (bshags pa) or a bit of essence meditation (ngo bo yud tsam zhig bsgoms pa) is more efficient for purifying past negative actions. He inquires how medita­tive experience comes about and poses several pragmatic questions, e.g., whether one should meditate with open or shut eyes and whether it is alright to sit for meditation in a position with raised knees. One string of questions deals with fear while staying in solitude, particularly how one should deal with disturbances from ghosts or spirits (lha 'dre) in lonely, haunted places. It is also asked whether it is better to meditate in a blessed place where others have earlier achieved accomplishment, or whether it is better to go to a lonely place in the mountains or valleys. The segment further contains two questions of philoso­phical character, namely what difference there is between the latent consciousness (kun gzhi'i rnam par shes pa, *iilayavijnlina) and the essence (ngo bo, *svabhava), and how the two kinds of knowledge (mkhyen pa gnyis) and the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) exist for a buddha.

Rnal byor Chos g.yung, 1103-1199) along with answers attributed to Bsod nams rin chen. The questions tend to be longer than the answers. The majority of the questions concern meditation on the essence (ngo bo, *svabhiiva). The first two questions deal with the issue of the non-duality of the mind (sems, *citta) and the light of the mind (sems kyi 'od, *cittaprakiifo), as well as of dharmakiiya (chos sku) and the light of dharmakiiya (chos sku'i 'od). Thereupon, the interlocutor asks two questions about how it is possible for a buddha who has entered the decisive meaning (don cig chod) still to perform actions for the benefit of sentient beings. The next question concerns the relationship between distraction and the ability to rest in dharmakaya, which is followed by some remarks about the perfection of the view as presented by Mi la ras pa (rje btsun mi la). The interlocutor then asks whether an elderly person who already since long has gener­ated the essence still can expect more progress and familiarization, whereupon he asks two further questions about whether the practitioner can expect to recognize the essence in the interim (bar do, *antariibhava) if he has achieved recognition of the essence in this life but has still not been able to recognize the essence while dreaming. The latter question is repeated later in the text in slightly different wording. The next two questions concern the need to engage in other practices besides resting in the essence: Is it still necessary to visualize the Generation Stage (bskyed rim) of a deity practice and recite mantras, and is it still necessary to cultivate the relative bodhicitta? Then comes a personal question, where it is asked whether the venerable one, i.e., Bsod nams rin chen, feels any mental discomfort when he gets ill. Finally, there is a series of nine questions over the theme of the phases of meditation and post-meditation, how distraction affects the meditation, and whether the practice will carry fruit in the interim. Inside the answer given to one of these questions, an embedded saying is oddly attributed by the speaker to \"Aciirya Sgam po pa\" (slob dpon sgam po pa'i zhal nas ... gsung). This either seems to indicate that the author refers to Sgam po pa in the third person, forgetting that he is already writing in the voice of Sgam po pa, or it is possible that the epithet Acarya Sgam po pa, which literally means \"the Acarya from [Dags lha] sgam po,\" in this instance does not refer to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen but to someone else, perhaps to the later throne-holders of the Dags lha sgam po hermitage, such as one of Sgam po pa's two nephews and lineage-holders. The title Acarya (slob dp on) is certainly not commonly used with regard to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen.

The list presupposes the later history of these disciples' activities in that it distinguishes who later became lineage-holders, etc. Hence, it is evident that the appendix must have been written at least two generations after Bsod nams rin chen, i.e., in the late twelfth century, but not so late that some of these rare names would already have been forgotten. The fact that the master 'Dul ba 'dzin pa (1134-1218) is here referred to as \"abbot\" or \"preceptor\" (mkhan po, *upiidhyiiya) suggests that the list was written during or shortly after his tenure as abbot (mkhan po) of Dags lha sgam po in the period 1173-1218. 854 The list of students is sufficiently short to be translated here in full: The precious Bia ma Lha rj e855 had an inconceivable number of students who attai­ned accomplishment (grub pa, *siddhi).

He served as abbot of the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage in the period 1145-1169, thus starting his tenure already eight years prior to Bsod nams rin chen's death in 1153. He is thus regarded as the main lineage-holder of the Dwags po bka' brgyud tradition. 858 Phag mo grub pa, \"the siddha from Phag mo [gru],\" i.e., Phag mo gru pa Rdo rj e rgyal po ( 1110-1170), was the founder of the Phag gru bka brgyud tradition. 859 The great 'BaITl rom pa, meaning \"the great one from 'BaITl rom,\" refers to 'Ba' rom pa Dar ma dbang phyug (1127-1199), who was the founder of the 'Ba' rom bka brgyud tradition.

Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum: Meditation Manuals concerned with the Six Doctrines of Naropa (Na ro 'i chos drug gi khrid yig) The majority of the texts in the Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum are concrete manuals (khrid clws or khrid yig) containing meditation instructions on either the Tantric yogas or on MahO.mudriI In ms DK.A, these works are roughly arranged into two groups of texts, with the present division of Tantric yoga manuals coming first. Such a division is, however, only proposed as a general distinction, because the present Tantric group of six works (texts DK.A.Pa­DK.A.Tsha) also contains a text (DK.A.Pha) which deals entirely with MahiimudrO. and that work actually falls under what has here been presented as the subsequent division in the arrangement of texts, namely the group of manuals giving MahO.mudrii instruction (texts DK.A.Dza-Sha). The Tantric instructions presented here are primarily concerned with the so-called \"Six Doctrines of Naropa\" or, more literally, the \"Six Dharmas of Nampa\" (no. ro 'i chos drug, also spelled nO. ro chos drug), a set of teachings said to have been gathered by the Indian master Tilopa and transmitted to his student Naropa. Nampa, in turn, gave the teachings to his Tibetan student Mar pa Lho brag pa Chas kyi blo gros, who brought the yogas to Tibet. It was from Mar pa that Bsod nams rin chen's Tantric teacher Mi la ras pa learnt these practices. 871 The yogas, also often referred to as \"the method way\" (thabs lam, *upO.yamO.rga), are practices associated with the second of the four empowerments of the unparalleled Yogatantra (*Anuttarayogatantra or Niruttarayogatantra). After having visualized oneself and all other beings as deities and recited the mantras of the deity during the practices associated with the first empowerment, the practitioner uses these techniques of the six yogas, belonging to the second empowerment, to create strong experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought, thereby providing a first glimpse of Awakening. Several of the practices accomplish this by manipulating the psychic energies, referred to as \"winds\" (rlung, *viiyu), which are thought to flow through a bodily system of energy channels (rtsa, *nii</-i). These practices involve holding the breath deep in the abdomen for extended periods and manipulating the winds by visualization and yoga movements in the type of yoga practices known as 'breath-control' (srog rtsol, *priir:zi'iyiima). This is done in order to create a powerful experience of bliss, which is said to constitute a similitude of the actual bliss experienced in spiritual Awakening (byang chub, *bodhi). Other yogas do not rely on breath-control, but are instead techniques for learning to maintain awareness during states of dream and deep sleep, producing what in Western psychology has become known as lucid dreaming. Further, some of the yogas are tech­niques concerned with the experience of dying and are meant to aid the practitioner at the moment of death or during the interim (bar do, *antari'ibhava), which is believed to go on for several weeks after death until the next rebirth occurs. The famous \"Tibetan Book of the 871 The Indian history of the tradition of the six yogas has been presented in more detail in KRAGH (201 la)."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"346 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum Dead\" (Bar do thos grol), which does not belong to the Six Yogas of Naropa, bears some similarity with one of these practices, which in the Six Yogas is known simply as \"the instruction on the interim\" (bar do 'i gdams pa). Further details about these practices willbecome evident from the summaries of specific textual segments below. 4.13 DK.A.Pa: Sayings of the Dharma Master, the Doctor from Dags po:The Instruction Manual entitled Closely Stringed Pearls (Chos rj e dags polha rj e 'i gsu ngl khrid chos mu tig tsar la brgyus pa bzhugs so) 14 folios, 13 segments, 13 internal colophons. The first of the Tantric instruction manuals isa collection of thirteen segments containing two separate cycles of meditation instructions,dealing respectively with Mahamudrii and the Six Dharmas of Naropa. The first cycle(segments DK.A.Pa.1-DK.A.Pa.4) begins by explaining the preliminary practice ofMahiimudrii, namely the meditation on the teacher (bla ma'i rnal 'byor, *guruyoga),followed by three segments providing a concise instruction on Mahiimudrii practice. The second cycle (segments DK.A.Pa.5-DK.A.Pa.13) deals with the Tantric yogas, i.e., the above-mentioned Six Dharmas of Naropa. These yogas are here presented in the followingorder: (1) Inner Heat (gtum mo, *cii7:1<;liill) with several different instructions, (2) Radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhiisvara), (3) Dream (rmi lam, *svapna), (4) Illusory Body (sgyu lus, *miiyiideha), (5) Transference ( 'pho ba, *sar;ikriinti) with two different instructi ons, and (6) the Interim (bar do, *antariibhava). Since these segments represent the first text of thecorpus where these practices will be introduced to the reader in the present book, the summaries given below will provide somewhat more detail in order to familiarize the reader with the general principles of the practices. Later segments in subsequent texts thatrepeat the same instructions will be summarized in shorter form. Segment DK.A.Pa.1: The segment begins (DK.A.Pa.1.1 b1): lbla ma yi dam mkha' 'gro rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ !rang ngam gzhan la phyag rgya chen po'i bsgom 'khrid lugs ni 'o skol gyi 'di byin brlabs kyi brgyud pa yin pas/. It ends (DK.A.Pa. l .3b3): /b la ma sgam po pa 'i ma7:1<;lal 'bul ba 'i thabso/. 872 The first segment begins by pointing out that the manner of guiding oneself or others in the meditation of Mahiimudrii is in the case of \"our tradition\" ('o skol gyi 'di) a lineage of blessing (byin brlabs kyi brgyud pa) 873 and it is therefore only 872 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.1303Q-132a5, DK.B.Pa.1.1 b1-3b3, DK.P.Pa.1.288a1-289b1, DK.Q.Pa.1.251 a1-252b4, DK.R.Pa.1.lb1-4b5, DK.S.Pa. 1.lb1-Sa4, DK.T.Pa.1.lb-3b. The text is not included in DK.D. 873 The Tibetan word (byin rlabs or byin gyis rlabs), which is here translated with 'blessing', is an attested translation for the Sanskrit term *adhi�,thana, which literally means \"standing above.\" Adhi�.thiina seems to carry a basic sense of overseeing, perhaps indicating how the teacher oversees the student in his or her learning. Adhi�,thana also carries a sense of \"ruling, controlling, correcting.\" The Tibetan translation byin rlabs literally means \"a wave/influence (rlabs) of magnificence or splendor (byin),\" where the \"magnificence\" possibly is meant to emphasize the bla ma's authority and the \"wave\" or \"influence\" seems to signify an exertion of control by the bla ma over the student. For a slightly different interpretation of the literal meaning of the Tibetan term, see MARTIN"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 347 possible for the meaning of Mahiimudrii to arise in the practitioner if he or she has first entered the blessing of the bla ma (bla ma 'i byin brlabs ma zhugs na). The segment also states that it is not difficult to enter the blessing of the bla ma, because this is simply done by praying to the bla ma with devotion. Further, it is said that those with the best devotion (mos gus rab) will be best at entering the blessing (byin brlabs), those having a middling devotion will do so in a middling manner, and those with little devotion will only be able to do so sparingly. These pronouncements of the text are highly significant for understanding the particular manner of practicing Mahiimudrii used in the early Dags po tradition. As discussed previously, the various Bka' brgyud traditions stemming from Dags po differ from other Tibetan traditions of Tantric-style Mahiimudrii practice, such as that of the Sa skya school. The main difference lies in the Bka' brgyud pa's claim that it is possible for a non-Tantric meditator to practice Mahiimudrii simply by relying on guruyoga and blessing as an entryway into the initial experience of Mahiimudrii. In other Tibetan gsar ma traditions, it is maintained that Mahiimudrii practice must be preceded by relying on the traditional Tantric stages of deity practice, the Tantric yogas, and sexual karmamudrii practice as steps leading up to and inducing the direct experience of Mahiimudrii. These opening remarks about the importance of blessing are followed by a detailed instruction on a guruyoga meditation focused on visualizing the bla ma surrounded by the earlier bla mas of the lineage as well as by various buddhas, bodhisattvas, deities, and protectors. The bla ma is here visualized in the space in front of the practitioner. He should then take refuge and thereafter visualize a ma�i<;lala consisting of the universe with Mount Meru, the four continents, and various offerings of wealth, etc., and offer many such visualized ma�<;Lalas to the bla ma. Thereafter, the meditator should recite a longer prayer (1994:274). The English translation \"blessing\" or \"consecration\" has since long been in use in many publications and is common Buddhist English usage, probably given the word's significance in Tibetan guruyoga practices where the student meditates on the teacher to receive empowerment (dbang, *abhi�eka) from him and thereby his \"blessing.\" The same is reflected in the common ritual behavior by contemporary Tibetan bla mas of giving 'blessing' (byin rlabs) by laying a hand on the head of a student or by touching the student's head with a consecrated religious object. A more literal translation of the term might be \"influence\" or \"supervision\", while retaining the translation \"blessing\" or \"consecration\" for more ritual contexts. MARTIN (ibid.) has mentioned in passing that the Tibetan word is not a literal reproduction of the Sanskrit term (which would be gnas, gzhi, rten, or brten pa, all of which are also attested Tibetan translations in other contexts) and that the Tibetan term might instead have its origin in an early seventh-or eighth-century Tibetan translation made from the Chinese term sheshou (Jiii£), literally meaning \"to receive and to accept.\" That is a term used in Chinese sources to denote the Buddha's willingness to accept all kinds of suffering individuals into his saligha. Hypothecially speaking, a more direct Chinese equivalent of the Tibetan term would be the Chinese Buddhist word jiach( CIJDt�), which literally means \"to increase and hold.\" This term is used in East Asian esoteric Buddhist text to signify the 'support' or 'assistance', and thus the 'blessing', that the practitioner receives through symbolic identification with a buddha or deity attained via Tantric ritual and visualization."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"348 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum to the bla ma, asking for purification of the afflictive emotions and veils, and wishing for wisdom and realization to arise. The particular liturgy for the cited prayer874 is a prayer that is often seen reproduced in slightly adapted versions in many later Tibetan guruyoga texts belonging to the different Bka' brgyud traditions, which attests to a quite ancient origin of the prayer in question. Finally, the meditator should imagine that the bla ma dissolves into him- or herself and should then rest for a while in a state free from conceptual proliferation. The meditation ends by dedicating (bsngo ba) the accumulated roots of wholesome actions towards Awakening.

It begins by saying that when the practitioner has completed the necessary number of years, months, or days needed for praying to the bla ma, he should then begin on the actual practice of Mahamudra. After taking refuge and so forth, he should sit in the vajra posture (i.e., what in Indian hafhayoga is today known as the \"lotus posture\"). He should then neither 'meditate' on Mahamudrii, the unborn, emptiness, the meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought, nor on anything else. Rather than attempting to 'meditate', he should avoid following thoughts of the past or engaging in thoughts of the future. Instead, he should simply recognize the thoughts (rtog pa, *vikalpa or *sm11kalpa) of the present by looking at them nakedly and observing their nature. It is recommended that the beginner meditator should make the meditation sessions short but frequent.

The Bka' dp e, simply meaning \"the instruction (bka } text (dpe)\", consists of mnemonic verses that explain the practice of Inner Heat and other Tantric yogas. It served as the root-text (milla) for the majority of early Tibetan texts deal­ing with the Six Dharmas of Naropa. There exist several different recensions of the verses.880 The present segment commences by quoting the first two Bka' dp e verses. The verses explain how Naropa completed the recitation of the seven-syllable Cakrasm71vara mantra and then received a prophecy from a rjiikinf telling him to seek out Tilopa as his teacher and request instruction on \"the nature of things\" (dngos po'i gnas lugs, *miilaprakrti), the path (lam), and the stages of the arising of the result ('bras bu skye ba'i rim pa).881 The verses are followed by a prose passage narrating how Naropa met Tilopa and re­ceived teachings from him. It is said that he, in particular, received instruction on the \"six Dharmas of Naropa\" (n'a ro'i chos drug), starting with the practice of \"Inner Heat of the A­Syllable Stroke\" (gtum mo a thung). It should be noted that this is the first attestation in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum of the designation \"six Dharmas of Naropa\" (in English a.k.a. \"Six Doctrines of Naropa\"), a label that in later Tibetan literature became a widespread name for the series of practices explained, inter alia, in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum and elsewhere but which is quite a rare designation in these early works.882 The prose part is followed by the quotation of another two Bka' dp e verses concerning the nature of the body and its inner channels, along with an indication of the correct sitting posture required for the practice. One of the verse-lines describes how to keep the back very straight (shin tu drang), comparing the vertebrae of the spine to \"closely stringed jewels\" (rin chen rtsar la rgyus par !tar). This wording of the root-text may be reflected in 88° For a preliminary discussion of the several versions that exist of the Bka' dp e root text(s), see KRAGH (201 la). It should now be added that two Bka' dp e versions whose readings are reflected in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum have meanwhile been published in a corpus of teachings and writings attributed to Mar pa entitled Lho brag mar pa lo tsa'i gsung 'bum, vol. 2, edited by Dpal brtsegs bod yig mying zhib 'jug khang, Beijing: Krung go'i bod rig pa dp e skrun khang (2011), pp. 21-28 and 97-115. 881 For a few more details on these terms, see the summaries of segments DK.A.Tha.26 and DK.A.Ya.3. 882 The label nii ro 'i clws drug is only attested three times in the early works of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum: the present occurrence at DK.A.Pa.5.5b4, once in the following segment at DK.A.Pa.6.6bs, and once in the chapter on the Dhyanapiiramita in the Jewel Ornament of Liberation (DK.A.E.93as). Besides such early works, the label also occurs several times in Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub's Sgam po pa hagiography written in 1520, which also is found in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum (DK.A.Ga). Hence, it is slightly incorrect when MEI (2009:55) states: \"It is quite certain that the phrase Nii ro chos drug has never been utilised as a rubric that refers to the renowned six teachings in the entire gSung 'bum of sGam po pa.\" She is, however, completely right in the overall point of her argument, namely that the expression was a very rare designation at this early stage of the Tibetan tradition."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 351 the overall title of the text (DK.A.Pa), where the text's various instructions are compared to \"closely stringed pearls\" (mu tig tsar la brgyus pa). The root-verses are followed by a second prose part that explain in detail how to begin a meditation session by assuming the correct sitting posture and visualizing the central channel and the two side-channels inside the body. Again, another Bka' dp e verse is quoted explaining the fourfold breathing practice consisting of inhaling (rngub, *iifviisa), holding (dgang, *bhara), releasing (gzhil ba, *nirvapa!ia?), and expelling [the last bit of breath] like an arrow [being shot] (mda' !tar 'phang, *i�uvad iik�ipta). These breathing techniques along with the associated visualizations, which are used to give rise to the first experience (nyams myong) of Inner Heat, are thereafter laid out in an accompanying prose part. The segment ends with the above-mentioned colophon. Segment DK.A.Pa.6: The segment begins (DK.A.Pa.6.6b4): na mo radna gu ru/ gtum mo a thung gi dbang du byas na/. It ends (DK.A.Pa.6.7b2) with the colophon: lg tum mo a thung gi zhal gyi gdams pa//.883 The second segment provides another instruction on Inner Heat that is closely related to the instruction given in the previous segment. The present instruction is -as indicated in its colophon -called \"oral instruction on Inner Heat of the A-Syllable Stroke\" (gtum mo a thung). In the present colophon, this instruction is not stated to be given according to Bia ma Mi la, as was seen in the colophon of segment DK.A.Pa.5. The segment begins by again quoting the first Bka' dp e verse and remarks that this is the same as was explained above, i.e., in the previous segment. The segment's use of cross­reference indicates that the instructions contained in this textual cycle originally were composed with the unity of a single work. Thereupon, the segment takes up the three key-points (gnad, *mannan) of the body (!us, *de ha), the channels (rtsa, *nii¢i), and the breath (rlung, *viiyu). The key-point of the body is explained by quoting a short Bka' dp e prose passage describing the sitting posture. The passage differs in wording from the Bka' dp e verse quoted in segment DK.A.Pa.5 on the same topic. A short subs equent prose part refers to the need for performing certain physical yoga exercises ('khrul 'khor), such as the \"squatting rotation\" (tsog pu'i 'khrul 'khor), etc. The next key-point of the channels is laid out in a prose segment presenting the visualization of the central channel (rtsa dbu ma or dhuti, *madhyanii¢1 or *avadhiiti)884 and the two side-channels, viz. the right channel called ro ma ( *rasanii) and the left channel called rkyang ma (*lalanii). Some sentences here have parallel wording to the explanations on these topics found in the previous segment. Thirdly, the key-point of the breath or wind (rlung) is introduced by describing the four breathing techniques of inhaling, holding, releasing, and expelling like an arrow. 883 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.1 35br 136b2, DK.B.Pa.6.6br 7b1, DK.P.Pa.6.293a5-294a5, DK.Q.Pa.6.255b4-256bi, DK.R.Pa.6.9a5-10b4, DK.S.Pa.6.11a1-l2h DK.T.Pa.6.6b-7b.

It is explained how the meditator should visualize the straight vertical stroke of the Indian Jetter A, which is stated to looks like a Tibetan shad (*dmyja) punctuation sign. It stands upright centrally in the body below the navel and is fiery in nature. While holding the breath pressed together i n the abdomen, a blissful heat is said to appear. Finally, it is briefly indicated how there are five ways of focusing on the letter A, and it is said that there are no differences between the present instruction called \"the short A stroke\" (a thung, *a-hrasva) and \"the four yogas ofmaster Mi la\" (rje mi la 'i rnal 'byor bzhi) in terms of how to visualize the flame and the vowel stroke of the A-letter, but that there are some differences with regard to the minor details (bshad yam). The segment ends with the short colophon quoted above. Segment DK.A.Pa.7: The segment begins (DK.A.Pa.7.7b2): /In a mo gu rul gtum mo 'bar 'dzag nyams su Zen pa la/. It ends (DK.A.Pa.7.8a2) with the colophon: lg tum mo 'bar'dzag zhal gyi gdams pa/.885 The seventh segment offers yet a third instruction on Inner Heat with special attention to how the practice should progress once the initial experience of heat has arisen. As stated in the brief colophon placed at the segment's end (quoted in Tibetan above), the segment contains an \"oral instruction on the Inner Heat of blazing and dripping\" (gtum mo 'bar 'dzag). The segment, written entirely in prose and without quoting any root-text, starts by outlining the same visualization of the central channel explained previously. It then instructs on how to visualize four cakras or 'wheels' ('khor lo) at different vertical points along the central channel with various numbers of secondary chan­nels radiating out from the central channel like the spokes of \"an open umbrella\" (gdugs bdal ba). At the navel, there is the emanation-cakra (sprul pa'i 'khor lo) with 64 channel­spokes. At the heart, there is the Dharmacakra (chos kyi 'khor lo) with 8 spokes. In the throat, there is the enjoyment-cakra (longs spyod kyi 'khor lo) with 16 spokes. At the top of the head, there is the great-bliss-cakra (bde ba chen po'i 'khor lo) with 32 spokes. These spokes are enclosed by the two side-channels starting at the nostrils and going down along the central channel until they reach below the navel, where they join the central channel. Again, it is instructed that the practitioner should hold the breath below the navel to make the A-letter flare up like a flame, the fire reaching so high that the flames strike the letter hmJi visualized in the great-bliss-cakra. This causes an energy called bodhicitta (byang sems), which is stored in this cakra, to trickle down through the central channel. As it fills up the different cakras on its way down, it generates different experiences of bliss. After reaching and filling the navel-cakra, the bodhicitta is visualized as flowing back up, while yogi continues to use the gtum mo breathing technique of holding the breath for as long as possible in the abdomen. At the end of the practice, the practitioner stops visuali­zing (yid la mi byed) the channels, winds, and drops, and instead rests in an uncontrived state of Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po ma bcos pa'i ngang). Thus, the present Tantric 885 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.136br l37a3, DK.B.Pa.7.7bz-8a2, DK.P.Pa.7.294ar295a1, DK.Q.Pa.7.256b1-257ai, DK.R.Pa.7. l0b4- ll b2, DK.S.Pa.7.12b3-13b3, DK.T.Pa.7 .7b-8n.

This practice is done while falling asleep. The instruction begins by explain what lying-position should be used in the bed and how to start by forming an intention not to dream but instead to \"seize the radiance\" ('od gsal zin par bya). The yogi then focuses the mind on a visualization of five syllables in the heart-cakra. As the state of sleep gradually sets in, the yogi must shift the awareness in a slow, progressive order from one syllable to another. If he is unsuccessful, he will enter the state of dream. When waking up, he must then evaluate his failure to seize the radiance and decide to try again. Following the same procedure as before, the yogi falls asleep again, and once he is successful in capturing the radiance, he will vividly see the visualized syllable Hiin1 in his heart radiating with a powerful light and the sleep will rise as blissful. After waking up, he will have the experience of being inside a strong permeating glow, seeing everything around him in the dark very clear ly. At the end, it is stated that this is a form Mahiimudrii practice for the dream state (phyag rgya chen po rmi lam du bsgom pa). A short quotation is given from Acarya Sgom pa (slob dp on sgom pa), perhaps referring to Sgom pa Tshul khrims snying po, saying that if someone manages to enter the Radiance of sleep (gnyis 'od gsal) just once, it is unthinkable that this ability would be absent at the time of death ('chi kar). In other words, Aciirya Sgom pa is here saying that when the nature of the mind appears at the time of death, which is likewise referred to as Radiance ('od gsal) as will be attested below, the yogi will definitely have the ability to recognize it and beco­me Awakened when dying, if he has achieved some mastery of the Radiance of sleep practice.

These points are then presented one-by-one. The first point, seizing the dream, contains a detailed explanation on how to fall asleep. First, during the daytime the yogi must think of all perceptions and thoughts as occurring in a dream. Then when feeling sleepy, he should go to bed with a strong determination to recognize the dream in the sense of practicing what in Western psychology has been referred to as lucid dreaming, i.e., dreaming with the self-awareness of recognizing that one is dreaming. Lying on the right side, the yogi then visualizes a lotus-flower holding five syllables that radiate a gentle light in his throat-cakra and he slowly shifts his awareness from one syllable to another while falling asleep. Falling asleep in this way should spontaneously produce the experience of seizing the dream, i.e., lucid dreaming, but if unsuccessful, the meditator should evaluate his attempt when waking up, form a new resolution, and try again using the same procedure. When the dream is seized, there will be the awareness that whatever one is dreaming is just a dream (rmi lam ci rmis pa de rmi lam yin 'dug snyam du shes pa 'ong). Next, the second point of training in lucid dreaming is explained. The yogi is here instructed to think of whatever dream arises as being merely a dream and to relate to it without any fear. If he dreams of water, he should plunge into it or walk across it. He should jump into an abyss or sit down to be bitten by dream-dogs or beaten by dream­enemies. He should fly in air, visit the god-realms, or go sight-seeing in India. The third point is then to bless the dream as illusion and to get rid of all fear. Here the yo gl is instructed to check his mind during the dream to see if even the slightest fear arises, and if so he should let go of it by recognizing that it is only a dream. Once a complete feeling of unobstructedness appears, he has \"blessed his dreams as illusory\" (sgyu ma byin gyis brlabs pa). Finally, he should in his dreams meditate on reality by analyzing that all states of dream­consciousness are his own mind which is unborn (rang gi sems skye ba med pa). If such a contemplation of Mahamudrii did not occur during the night, the yogi should direct his focus on the syllables again in the morning after waking up and then rest in the state of Mahamudrii.

He should then speak to himself, voicing many self-criticisms and check whether he feels any unhappiness or expressing praises and see whether he feels pleased. As long as such emotions arise, he has not trained himself sufficiently in the practice. Once no emotion occurs, he should contemplate all appearances of himself and everything else as having a hallucinatory and dream-like quality . A second phase then follows where the yogftrains in the illusory body of a chosen deity (yi dam lha 'i sgyu !us la bslab pa). A picture of a deity should be hung behind the practitioner's shoulder so that its image appears in the mirror placed in front. Again, the yogf scolds or praises the image in the mirror as his self-reflection and sees whether he can provoke an emotional response. When a state is reached in which no emotion occurs, the meditator contemplates the hallucinatory nature of himself and the reflection, producing the sensation that everything is essenceless like the body of the deity. The segment ends by stating that once accomplished, this practice will allow the practi­tioner easily to perfect the complete gathering of the requisites and it will purify all veils. This is followed up by a scriptural quotation praising the virtues of contemplating hallucination (sgyu ma, *miiyii). It is said that this instruction is a teaching on the post­meditative practice on Illusory Body (sgyu lus thun mtshams kyi chos), presumably meaning that it is a practice done in-between the sessions of regular sitting meditation practice.

In the instruction of the first type, the yogf assumes the meditation posture, generates bodhicitta, and visualizes the letter hilm in the heart-cakra. Light radiates out from the letter and transforms the external world into a pure palace and all beings into deities. The palace then dissolves into light that merges with the deities, and the deities dissolve into light that merges with oneself. The yogf's own deity-form dissolves into the hum syllable, which in turn gradually fades completely away. The meditator then rests in a state of Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po'i ngang).

This seat is the flat Armolika rock (ar mo ling ka 'i rdo Zeb) found in the Heaven of [Vedic gods of] the Thirty-Three [mansions] (sum cu rtsa gsum, Trayas­tril7ifo).891 The actual Transference is performed at the time of death. When the subtle bodily material elements of earth, water, fire, and air have dissolved ( 'byung ba rnams rim gyis bsdus pa), 892 the yo gf transfers his consciousness to the celestial seat and appears there in the essenceless form of his chosen deity (yi dam gyi lha) like a reflection in a mirror. By meditating on Radiance ('od gsal, >rp rabhiisvara) from within such a state of a pure Illusory Body (dag pa'i sgyu lus, *visuddhamiiyadeha), he is said to reach buddhahood. This part of the segment ends with what appears to be an excerpt from a zhus Zan text, where a question is posed with regard to lacking the ability clearly to perceive the celestial realm in the dream. An answer is given by \"the precious bla ma\" (bla ma rin po che'i zhal nas) about how to solve this problem, namely that the practitioner in that case during the daytime should repeatedly imagine traveling to the celestial Armolika stone and it then ought to become possible to have this experience in dreams during the night. The segment then continues by explaining the third type of Transference, the Transfer­ence from the Generation Stage of a yi dam practice. The yogf should first visualize himself in the illusory form of a deity and imagine the inner channels having particul ar syllables in 891 As noted by MEI (2009:49 fn. 143), the Buddha is said to have been sitting on this stone when he gave teachings to his deceased mother Maya in this heaven during his celestial sojourn. For a description of the stone slab's size and location, see WILLEMEN's (2004: 19) English translation of Bia ma 'Phags pa's Shes bya rah gsal. To this may be added that the stone is also often depicted in a number of Ta ntras and paintings as being the celestial seat of Buddha Vajradhara when he gave various higher teachings of the Tantras in the non-human realms. Such a non-human outer setting appears in numerous Ta ntras, perhaps to justify the belief of the Tantra followers that the Buddhist Ta ntra teachings originated with the historic Buddha Sakyamuni in his celestial form of Buddha Vajradhara even though the Ta ntras first emerged historically in the human realm of India and elsewhere many centuries later. 892 As will be outlined in later segments, these Tantric practices explain the initial death process through a series of steps in which the four elements dissolve. The dissolution process is accompanied by particular outer and inner signs and sensatio ns, to be explained below."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 357 different specific cakras. The breathing technique called the pitcher-or pot-like breathing (bum pa can, *kumbhaka) should be employed to hold the breath in the abdomen while imagining the syllables moving in the central channel with the effect of opening up the central channel at the crown of the head. When the exercise is done at the time of death, the letter standing within the heart-cakra is sent up and expelled out of the body through the crown of the head. It then merges into the heart of the bla ma who has been visualized in front. Thinking that the bla ma also is essenceless, the yogi rests in this state. When the breathing ceases at death, the meditator's mind is said to mix with natural Radiance (rang bzhin gyi 'od gsal dang 'dres) and he will thereby achieve buddhahood. In this segment, each of the three parts ends with a brief colophon indicating the type of Transference that has been explained. Thus, the last colophon states: \"The oral instruction on the Transfer­ence of the Generation Stage.\" Given that the parts do not start with the regular prefatory homage lines seen elsewhere in the text and that not all the parts are separated in the lay-out of ms DK.A, all three parts have here been treated as constituting a single segment.

It ends (DK.A.Pa.12.11 b1) with the colophon: lbtsan thabs kyi 'pho ba zhal gyi gdams pa//.893 The twelfth segment explains another form of Transference called \"Forceful Transference\" (btsan thabs kyi 'pho ba).894 It is notable that the word 'forceful' or 'forceful method' (btsan thabs) is a Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit word hafha, likewise meaning 'forceful' or 'manipulation', as known in the term hafhayoga. This is especially clear, since the practice explained here evidently involves a physical manipulation of the body and thus would seem to constitute a kind of hafhayoga in the Indian medieval sense of the term meaning \"the yoga of force\" (BIRCH, 2011 :527).895 893 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.140a4-140b3, DK.B.Pa.12. l la3-l lb1, DK.P.Pa.12.298ar298b6, DK.Q.Pa.12.259br260a5, DK.R.Pa.12.15b6-16bi, DK.S.Pa.12.19a4-20a1, DK.T.Pa. 12. l ln-l lb. The text is not included in DK.D. 894 MEI (2009:50) mentions this instruction and states that it is the same practice as seen in segment DK.A.Pha. 11. That is somewhat imprecise. 895 The Tibetan phrase btsan thabs has previously been proposed as a Tibetan equivalent for Sanskrit ha_thayoga by ALMOGI (2009:247), though without reference to textual attestations. An attestation of Tibetan btsan thabs for Sanskrit ha.tha is found in the Tibetan translation of Nagarjunagarbha's Caturmudranifraya, where the Sanskrit text twice has ha_thayoga (MIKKYO SEITEN KENKYOKAI, 1989:947.9) which in both cases is translated into Tibetan with btsan thabs kyi sbyor ba (D2225.78b2 ). Here btsan thabs corresponds to hafha, while sbyor ba is the translation for yoga. However, it needs to be added that there also exist text passages, where other Tibetan translations for Sanskrit ha_tha or hafhayoga occur. For example, the Tibetan translation of the final chapter of the Guhyasamajatantra (D443.155a4) has drag shul sbyor pas for Sanskrit lw thayogena (Sanskrit edition by MATSUNAGA, 1978:18.162), and the Tibetan translation of Advayavajra's Sekanirde§a (D2252.143a4) has drag po'i dbang bskur for Sanskrit lw thadiihseka (Sanskrit edition by MIKKYO SEITEN KENKYOKAJ, 1991:609). In these examples, Tibetan drag shul and drag po, which both mean 'forceful', 'powerful', 'violent', or 'wrathful', are the Tibetan equivalents for Sanskrit ha_tha. -"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"358 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum The instruction given here is a form of Transference which a yogi or bla ma might perform on someone else who is dying. The dying person is placed in a lying position with the legs pulled up, so that the heel of the left foot blocks the anus while the ankles block the urethra. The facial orifices, such as the eyes and so forth, are blocked with the right hand by assuming the lion-pose. By pushing the abdomen in, the dying person's breath is forcefull y expelled, thereby moving the inner winds upwards and out through the crown of the head. During this, the dying person should visualize that the nine bodily orifices are completel y blocked with hun'i syllables and that above his head is a bla ma or deity of the person's choice. By the forced expelled breaths, the consciousness, in the form of a hit1n letter, is sent out through the opening at the crown of the head and it merges into the bla ma's heart. Thereupon, the dying person should rest in a state where the bla ma is seen as essenceless. It is stated that the dying person thereby will merge with dharmakaya and attain bud­dhahood, or even if this should not be the case, he or she is certain to achieve higher rebirth as a god or a human . The segment ends by stating that this type of Transference should only be done to a dying person, in particular someone greatly pained by illness and who has not accumulated very negative actions, but it is not to be done to others.

Before it commences on explaining this precept, it first states that \"the instruction on Body-Entering has not been explained here\" (grong 'jug gi gdams pa 'dir ma bstan no). The instruction on Body-Entering (grong 'jug or grong khyer la 'jug pa, >rp urapravefo) is a special form of Transference practice ('pho ba) explained elsewhere in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum that is said to allow the yogi to expel his conscious­ness out of his living body and temporarily or permanently make it enter a fresh corpse of a very recently deceased person or other sentient being.897 It seems that this practice was discontinued in the later Bka ' brgyud traditions, which may already have been the case when the present text was written. The Sanskrit passages cited here have all been selected on the basis of the remarks given by Jason BIRCH (2011 :535) regarding uses of the Sanskrit phrase ha,thayoga in Buddhist sources. 896 Correlated passages: D K.a.N ga.1 40b3- l 42a5, D K.B .Pa.13.11b1-14�, D K.P .Pa.13.298b6-301 b6, DK.Q.Pa.13.260as-262b6, DK.R.Pa.13.16b1-20a6, DK.S.Pa.13.20a1-24bs, DK.T.Pa. 13.l lb-14n.

This involves a lengthy explanation of the process of dying and the experiences that a deceased person is believed to undergo in the interim state (bar do, antara bhava), which -according to the various schools of Northern Buddhism in Tibet and East Asia (but not according to the Theravada school of Southern Buddhism) -occurs after death for up to seven weeks until the next rebirth. The passage begins by quoting three verses from an unidentified scripture. It then divides the instruction into three parts: (1) recognizing the radiance [in] the first interim (bar do dang po 'od gsal ngos bzung ba), (2) recognizing the illusory body [in] the second [interim] (gnyis pa sgyu lus ngos bzung ba), and (3) blocking the door to the womb in the third [interim] (gsum pa la mngal gyi sgo dgag pa). As for the first phase, it is explained how -when dying -first the five outer sensory perceptions dissolve one by one (yul Inga thim pa'i rim pa). This is followed by a second set of stages during which the four bodily constituents in the form of the material elements dissolve ('byung ba bzhi thim pa'i rim pa). When the earth element dissolves into the water element, the dying person becomes unable to hold up the body, has a sensation of sinking, feels like there is a fine layer of dust in front of the face, and the nostrils and ear canals open up slightly. Thereafter, the water element dissolves into the fire element, a little spittle and snot come out from the mouth and nose, the mouth and nose become dry, the tongue sinks in, and the dying person perceives a black spot. When the fire element dissolves into the air element, the body heat disappears from the extremities of the body, the eyeballs turn upwards, and the feet and hands twitch and shake. Finally, when the air element dissolves into consciousness, the breath becomes irregular and rattles (? rngog rngog byed), and after a while the breathing fully stops. Following the dissolution stages of the five elements, there are three phases called light (snang ba, *iiloka), rising (mched pa, *vrddhi), and arrival (thob pa, *labdha). During the first phase, the consciousness dissolves into light. Externally, the dying person sees a weak light like a moon-rise, while inwardly the luster of consciousness becomes weak as if it was covered with smoke. At this time, 33 types of anger cease. When the phase of light dissolves into the phase of rising, the dying person externally sees a more intense light comparable to a sunrise, while inwardly the consciousness flickers like fireflies. Here, 40 types of desire cease. When the phase of rising dissolves into the phase of arrival, the dying person externally finds himself in a dense darkness and inwardly the consciousness becomes as weak as the light from a single flame. Seven types of ignorance now cease. Finally, the phase of arrival dissolves into radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhiisvara). Here, the radiance of emptiness, dharmakaya, which is found within every sentient being, appears. For someone who has meditated on radiance during his life, the radiance of the meditation (bsgoms pa'i 'od gsal, *bhiivanaprabhasvara) and the natural radiance (rang bzhin gyi 'od gsal, *svabhavaprabhasvara) merge together like water and milk, or like the space inside a jar that breaks whereby its inner space merges with space itself. The segment then provides"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"360 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum quotations from the Caturp�thatantra and the Maiijufrfnamasa171gfti to illustrate this process. The segment's second instruction concerns recognizing the illusory body in the interim, which is divided into a section dealing with the impure illusory body (ma dag pa 'i sgyu lus) and a section on the pure illusory body (dag pa'i sgyu lus). It starts by saying that if the yogiis unable to remain in the state of radiance, the interim (bar do, *antarabhava) will appear. This begins to take place between half a day and four days after dying. The deceased finds himself appearing in an illusory, dream-like body similar to the one he had when he wasalive. When he approaches living people, they cannot see him or hear what he says to them,which makes him feel upset and frustrated. The deceased is now able to go anywhere instantly, he is unobstructed by all physical things, and he has intuitive mind-reading abiliti es. He gradually realizes that he has died. After three and a half days in this state, he perceives his upcoming future reincarnation. The segment quotes the Abhidharmakofo on this point. These experiences all pertain to what is called the impure illusory body. If the deceased is a meditator, it is possible that he may recognize this illusory body for what it is, instead assume the form of the deity that he has previously meditated on while he was still alive. Meditating repeatedly on Mahamudra, all habitual tendencies become purified by the fire of radiance. It is said that such meditation in the interim is far more efficient than even a hundred years of meditation while alive. The segment's third instruction concerns how to block the door to the womb [of reincarnation]. If the deceased person did not become Awakened during the second interim (bar do gnyis pa), his future parents will appear before him having sex. If he is to be born as a male, he will feel anger towards the father and desire towards the mother. If he is to be born as a female, he will feel the other way around. By the force of this emotion, he will enter the father's body through the anus, merge with the semen, enter into the mother's womb through the father's ejaculation, and thus enter into a new SaJ??Sliric rebirth. It is, however, possible for the deceased person to prevent this from happening by resting in samadhi. If the deceased person is able to remain calm and stay out of this the first time such a sexual vision appears, it will become increasingly easy for him to prevent it again later on when other rebirth possibilities appear. If, however, he is unable to stop the pull of rebirth, he should imagine the father as being his bla ma (of the previous life) and the mother as being the bla ma's female Tantric partner in order to avoid feeling desire and generate devotion instead. If this approach is unsuccessful, he can imagine the couple as his chosen deity (yi dam gyi Iha) in union to avoid feeling desire. If this too is unsuccessful, he should contemplate that these appear­ances are illusion-and dream-like, merely projections of his own mind. He should then visualize himself as a deity and meditate on radiance. If this too does not work, he can contemplate emptiness, thinking that all appearances are mind only and rest in a non-dual experience of the mind, like the center of the sky. If he is able to block rebirth in this manner during the first week of the interim, he will be able to do so with ease again during the second week of the interim and so forth."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 361 Someone who has previously accrued equal amounts of positive and negative karmic actions remains in the interim for up to 49 days and during these seven weeks he can train i n the path and possibly achieve buddhahood. Someone who is to be reborn in the modes of instant rebirth (rdzus skyes, *opapatika), from heat and moisture (drod bsher las skye ba, *smf!sedaja), or from an egg (sgong skyes, *ari�laja)898 needs to block such rebirths by meditating on himself in the form of his chosen deity . To avoid rebirth, he may also use the miraculous ability, which is naturally present in the interim, to go spontaneously to the celestial realms and visit the Buddha's heavenly seat in the form of the Armolika stone, purify the remainder of his karmic actions there, and it is said that he will then with certainty reach buddhahood. This is followed by an instruction on how to enter the womb if the above methods were futile due to insufficient training. In that case, the deceased should resolve to enter the womb like a bodhisattva. Relying on the intuitive powers that everyone possesses in the interim, he should search out the best possible parents. Visualizing the father's seed as the letter !1i, he should then transfer ('pho bar bya) his consciousness into the womb. In order to protect the womb from being snatched away (mngal 'phrog pa bsrung ba), he should meditate on being surrounded by a circle of weapons. Subsequently, he will then be reborn , grow up with a strong inclination for practicing the Dharma, and thus reach Awakening in that or some future life. The segment ends with a colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): The instruction on practical guidance for the interim is finished. [These] oral instructions of master Sgam po pa have come down in a lineage from Rin po che Bye dkar ba. Since I have had no self-interest [in writing them down], I ask that the ¢akinls will not be displeased. May the blazing splendor of auspiciousness [of this text] adorn the world! May it be beneficial ! May it be good! The colophon seems to be an overall colophon for the entire text or at least for the larger part of the text, such as the second teaching cycle of segments DK.A.Pa.5-13. It states that the instructions presented here were passed down orally from Sgam po pa to Rin po che Bye dkar ba. The latter was a master who served as deputy abbot at Dags Iha sgam po hermitage during the abbacy ofMkhan po 'Dul ba 'dzin pa (1 134-1218) in the years 1173-1213 (S0RENSEN & DOLMA, 20007:47). Consequently, the composition of the text or at least of some of its segments can be dated to the late twelfth or early thirteenth centuries. The prayers at the end of the colophon starting \"May the blazing splendor ... etc.\" are the scribal colophon, and as argued above (under DK.A.Da.2) this particular prayer is a sign­off from the scribe named Kun dga' rin chen. 898 Regarding the four types of birth (yoni, skye gnas) taught in Abh idhanna texts, see KRAGH (2006:300 fn. 488)."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"362 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 4.14 DK.A.Pha: Exposing the Hidden Character of the Mind (Sems kyi mtshan nyid gab pa mngon du phyung ha bzhugs) 5 folios, 2 segments, 2 internal colophons.

It is written in verse with nine syllables per line, having 66 four-line verses in full. The first verses (1-6) argue that though there is ignorance of the nature of the mind, this ignorance has no real cause and is never really there to begin with . Hence, there is no real distinction between igno­rance and liberation, and consequently there cannot be said to exist any real duality between sentient beings and buddhas, between sm?isilra and nirvii�ia. Sm1isiira is just a magical self- illusion, a self-enveloped dream that holds no reality . If sm?isiira is unreal, so is A wakening -as is argued in verses 7-12 -in the sense that a dream does not go anywhere after one awakens since it was never real to begin with. There is, in fact, nothing to abandon or realize. Those who imagine themselves to be learned are actually just deluded in their scholarly assessments of illusory forms. Sm?tsiira and nirvii�a are equally unreal like the reflection of the moon in a pool of water, and if one overcomes this tendency of clinging to them as real, all the seeds of SaJ?tsiira and nirvii�a will be destroyed. This is said to be a moment of experience undefiled by wanting, uncorrupted by words and thoughts, unpolluted by notions of duality; it is dhannakiiya itself. Yet, how is this to be realized? Verse 13 mentions the faulty approach taken by some (la la'i bzhed), where meditation and post-meditation are treated as if separate. Instead, the practitioner should stop thinking in terms of these phases and rather understand the naked, natural mind (tha mal shes pa rj en pa) to be dhannakiiya (verses 14-17). There is no distincti on between the equally unreal delusion ('khrul pa) and non-delusion (ma 'khrul pa); knowledge (ye shes, *jfiiina) is simply the realization of this fact. The yogf is admonished not to attempt to recover his focus when getting distracted and not to apply remedies when delusion occurs; these are unnecessary artificialities, because there is neither bondage nor liberation. 899 Correlated passages: DK.D.Pha.1.1 b1-6a1, DK.P.Pha.1.301 br306a3, DK.Q.Pha. l.262br266b3, DK.S.Pha. 1.1 b1-9a2, DK.T.Pha.1.1 b-6n.

Rather, the practitioner should not to seek to give up or develop anything, but should wake up from the delusion of superimposing such hopes and fears. When looking within, there is no mind to be seen. Consequently, \"Bud­dha\" and \"sentient being\" are mere names. A causal result obtained through striving is only conditioned and not lasting; instead the practitioner must seek a non-conditioned result. The meditator should not rely on anything else, but be self-sufficient like the sky. The following verses (24-30) reject all notions of duality , arguing that there cannot be any passing defilement for someone who is inherently liberated from the beginning. Knowledge (ye shes, *jfiana) is neither permanent nor interrupted and is not something to be attained. It is comp arable to the sky or space (nam mkha ', *gagana), unsullied by no­tions of bondage or liberation as it is not subject to change. Space can neither be bound nor freed and likewise the notions of sentient being or buddha cannot be applied to the mind. In terms of action (verses 31- 40), the text recommends non-action (ma byas), saying there is no basis for habitual tendencies in the unconditioned nature of mind. It rejects any need for being concerned with positive or negative actions, and there is no high or low. All appearances or perceptions (snang ba, *avabhasa) are merely magical illusions of space (nam mkha'i cha 'phrul). Meditation is compared to gazing into space and everything that appears is as unreal as a drawing in space. Things and thoughts arise out of nowhere. The character of such meditation is elaborated further in verses 41-49. There should be neither focus (dran pa, *smrti) nor distraction (yengs pa, *vik�epa). Once it is seen that the mind has no basis, the key-point (gnad) that there neither is meditation nor distraction will be understood. Hence, there is nothing to be abandoned or developed, and neither delusion nor liberation. Looking inward again and again, a state without bondage and liberation is seen. This is a path without grasping, need, or meaning. Verse 50 admonishes: \"Look! Look! There is nothing to see. Meditate! Meditate! There is nothing on which to meditate!\" (ltos shig ltos shig ci yang ma blta zhig /bsgoms shig bsgoms shig ci yang ma bsgom zhig/). Without any fault or quality (verse 51), all doubt and conceptual entanglement should be cut off (verse 52). All instructions boil down to understanding that there is neither benefit nor harm from the empty appearances and that one should observe the observer himself (verse 53). Doing away with all existence and non-existence, one should rest in oneself without coming or going (verse 54). In terms of teaching (verses 55-56), there is little need for study or talking. Without meditative experience, the meaning of the key-points will not be understood. This teaching should not be taught to those who talk too much, to those who disregard cause and effect, or to those who strive for meditation in solitude. The meaning of the Sutras is experience. The outcome of such experience (verses 57-60) is buddhahood, when the intellect realizes that there is nothing to intellectualize. In fact, conceptual entanglement (spros pa, *p rapaiica) is incapable of sullying the mind, since delusion is not real. Knowing this, one is not affected by bondage or liberation.

This is unceasing meditation. As it is beyond birth and death, it is the king of Transference ('pho ha). Being free of clinging, it is incessant Radiance ('od gsal). Finally, since karman only is accumulated as long as one engages in thoughts of clinging, the yogf awakens from worries about whether or not he is focused in his meditation (verses 61-66). Without any hope or fear, both SWJ1Siira and nirViilJa dissolve into the experiential expanse (klong du zhig). Although there really is no meditation, the meditator should seek meditation as long as he has not found the confidence of an undistracted meditation. Once meditation and post-meditation have become indivisible in this expanse, he can engage in conduct for the benefit of himself and others. Therefore, without striving in a practice through faith and diligence, yogfs should verify the mind. If certainty has not been reached at the time of death, one will harm oneself. If happiness is desired, the meditator needs to accept hardship now. If buddhahood is desired, he needs to realize the mind. The segment ends with a short colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"The instruction exposing the hidden character of the mind -the [syllables] OTJ1, iif:i, hu1J1 [naturally inscribed]in the hearts of sentient beings -was spoken by the lord of yogfs, the Dharma king Candr.aprabha Kumara to Rnal 'byor Chos g.yung.

The third instruction manual is another compilation of instructions on the Tantric yogas, particularly the Six Dharmas of Naropa. Overall, the text begins with an explanation on the preliminary practices and the Generation Stage (bskyed rim) according to the Hevajratantra. Thereafter, it turns to presenting the yogas associated with the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim), including Body-Entering (grong 'jug), Inner Heat (gtum mo), Illusory Body (sgyu lus) and Dream (rmi lam), Radiance ('od gsal), and the Interim (bar do). The title given to the text in ms DK.A seems to be a composite title denoting three distinct parts: a first part entitled \"the Great Secret Practical Guidance\" (Dmar khrid gsang chen), a second part entitled \"Practical Guidance on the Interim\" (Bar do 'i dmar khrid), and a third part entitled \"Practical Guidance on Transference\" ('Pho ba 'i dmar khrid). The first part, Dmar khrid gsang chen, seems to refer to segments DK.A.Ba.1-7, which first explain the preliminary practices and the Generation Stage of the Hevajratantra and thereupon explain the Completion Stage practices of grong 'jug, gtum mo, sgyu lus and rmi lam, and 'od gsal. The second part, Bar do 'i dmar khrid, seems to refer to segment DK.A.Ba.8, containing a bar do explanation, which -as shall be argued below -is an exact copy of segment DK.A.Pa.13 and therefore perhaps adopted from text DK.A.Pa into the present work as an addendum.

I I. Alternatively, it could have been an unrealized intention of the editors to add a segment with a 'pho ba instruction in order to have all the practices of the Six Dharmas of Nampa taught in the present text. Segment DK.A.Ba.1: The segment begins (DK.A.Ba. I.lb,): na mo gu ru! bla ma dang ni dgyes rdor la/. It ends (DK.A.Ba. l .4a2): de rnams sngon du 'gro dgos shes bla ma dam pa gsung ngo/!.903 The first segment begins with a homage to the bla ma and the deity Hevajra, whereupon the author states that he in this text is going to explain the Completion Stage practices (rdzogs pa'i rim pa) of the Hevajratantra (although the second segment DK.A.Ba.2 actually teaches how to practice the Generation Stage). In spite of the fact that several of the Six Dharmas of Nampa are said to be affiliated with other Tantras than the Hevajratantra, including the Caturplfha-, Cakrasary1vara-, and Guhyasamiijatantras, the present text's special attention to the Hevajratantra suggests that this Tantra was of parti­cular exegetical importance to the author. The segment then divides the practice into \"preliminary practices\" (sngon 'gro, *p urva1?1gama) and \"actual practices\" (dngos gzhi, *maula). From among these, the present segment introduces the preliminary practices. There are three such preliminary practices: (1)setting up the protection circle (bsrung ba'i 'khor lo), gathering the requisites (tshogs bsags pa), and generating the deity which serves as a support [for the later practices] (rten lhar bskyed pa). The practice of setting up the protection circle is explained in the form of two visualiza­tions that are to be performed in a retreat with five daily meditation sessions over the course of several days. It is said that this practice will remove obstacles and suppress afflictive emotions. The second preliminary practice of gathering the requisites involves imagining the bla ma in front of oneself. Through a certain visualization that relies on the breath, the meditator engenders faith and devotion to bla ma, which is said to gather beneficence and fulfill the Tantric observances (dam tshig, *samaya). In the third preliminary practice of generating the deity, the meditator imagines that the bla ma in front dissolves into himself and settles in the middle of his abdomen near the navel. The bla ma then appears in the form of Hevajra with eight faces and sixteen arms. Each of the three practices are to be performed in the same retreat format of five daily sessions, in that each session begins with first practice and once that is perfected, the second practice is added thereafter, etc. The segment ends by admonishing that these 902 The problem of the missing 'pho ba instruction in this text in spite of the indication given in its title has been noted by Ching Hsuan MEI (2009:48-49) in her extensive study of Tibetan 'pho ba transmissions and liturgies. 903 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.142a5-145a6, DK.B.Ba.1.1 b1-4a2, DK.D.Ba.1.1 b,-4a,, DK.P.Ba. l .306a4-308b3, DK.Q.Ba. l .266b5-269b4, DK.R.Ba. l. lb1-5a6, DK.S.Ba.1.1 b1-5b4, DK.T.Ba.1.1 b-4n."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 367 preliminary practices must be performed prior to any of the later practices, such as Inner Heat, Illusory Body, etc. Segment DK.A.Ba.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Ba.2.4a2): //b la ma dam pa rnams la phyag 'tshal lo! lbskyed pa'i rim pa'i man ngag nil. It ends (DK.A.Ba.2.5b1): /n 'a ro ma tri 'i gdams pa'o/! .904 The second segment presents an instruction on the Generation Stage (bskyed rim, *utpattikrama). This is explained by means of three trainings: (1) training in the image (rnam pa la bslab pa), (2) training in the sequence (go rim la bslab pa), and (3) training in the sessions (thun mtshams la bslab pa). For training in the image, i.e., how to visualize the deity, the segment instructs the meditator to erect a meditation hut with windows in different directions. By the use of a mirror and a sword, the practitioner is at different times of the day able to direct reflected sunlight onto a painting (thang sku) of the deity . This allows him to focus on visualizing the deity's face, shape, and hand-implements in a manner that makes the image resplendent with light. The meditator is told gradually to extend the length of each session, as a result of which the best meditators will be able to visualize the deity more clearly than the painting, a mediocre practitioner will be able to visualize it as clearly as the painting, while lesser practitioners will only be able to imagine it less clearly than the painting. Practitioners who remain unable to achieve a clear visualization are directed to engage in various purificatory practices and then to try again. This process should gradually be applied to visualizing the entire Hevajra mm:i<;fala with all its deities and offering goddesses, along with other ritual aspects of the practice, such as taking Refuge, contemplating the four immeasurables, contemplating emptiness, etc. The second point of training in the sequence is only explained very shortly, saying that the meditator should familiarize himself with each step of the practice in its correct order from the beginning till the end of the practice. The final point of training in the sessions is explained in the way that the practitioner can choose any number of daily practice-sessions, such as three or four sessions. The attainment of stability in the practice is then listed as consisting in a clear visualization, non-distraction, and clarity with regard to the differences between the various deities. It is stated that a good practitioner will attain such stability within one month, the middling practitioner within six months, and the lesser practitioner within a year. The segment ends with a brief colophon (quoted in Tibetan above), saying \"The instruction of Naro and Maitr1,\" thereby attributing these explanations to the Indian masters Nampa and Maitrlpa.

Given the contents of segments DK.A.Ba.1-2, the yogas here seem to be presented as the Completion Stage practices associated with the Hevajra practice. The third segment teaches the practice of Body-Entering (grong 'jug, *p urapravefo), which is one of the ancillary practices of the Six Dharmas of Naropa. Since its transmission was at some point discontinued or died out, it is generally not included among the Six Dharmas in later Tibetan texts. Similarly, the grong 'jug practice is explicitly omitted in text DK.A.Ba, as stated at the beginning of segment DK.A.Pa.13. The present segment and the upcoming segment DK.A.Tsha.8 are therefore some of the rare passages in Tibetan literature that explain the principles behind this yoga. The practice of Body-Entering is though well-known from Tibetan narrative literature, e.g., the hagiography of Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros (1002/1012-1097) written by Gtsang smyon He ru ka Rus pa'i rgyan can (1452-1507), wherein Mar pa and his son Dharma Mdo sde are repeatedly depicted as using these techniques. These narratives, however, do not provide any technical details on the yoga and its performance, as is seen in the present text. Hence, it seems significant clearly to distinguish between narrative and instructional texts when discussing passages dealing with yoga practices. The segment begins with a short quotation from the Sgyu ma chen po, probably referring to the Mahiimiiyiitantra. Thereupon, the actual instruction is given. The yogi must contemplate the illusory nature (sgyu ma, *miiyii) of everything, maintain full conviction of seeing himself as a deity (lha'i nga rgyal), and have achieved mastery over his inner winds. When wishing to perform this practice, he first has to construct a ma�1¢ala, write a black letter huifz on a human skull (thod pa, *kapiila) or on a piece of slate (g.yam po), and place it above the ma�rjala. He then visualizes his consciousness in the form of a certain syllable in his heart-cakra. Relying on his mastery of the combined wind-and-mind (rlung sems), the yogi attempts to transfer the visualized syllable symbolizing the mind from the heart­cakra into the black hum syllable written on the skull or the slate in the outer ma�rjala. The sign of his success is that the skull or slate begins to quiver and shake. The next step of the practice is to replace the skull with a fresh and completely undam­aged corpse of a small, pleasant animal. The yogi now visualizes the hulfi letter in the heart of the animal and performs the same procedure as above. If the ritual is effective, the dead animal will begin to quiver, stand up, and walk about. At the end, the yogi retracts his consciousness back into himself. Once this step has been successful, the yogi can perform the same ritual using a freshand undamaged human corpse. The corpse is washed and adorned with ornaments and then placed in meditation posture on top of the ma�rjala. When successful, the corpse will begin to breathe and become animated. As long as the yogi keeps his mind attached to the corpse 905 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.1 46b5-147b1, DK.B.Ba.3.5b1-6a4, DK.D.Ba.3.5b1-6a3, DK.P.Ba.3.3 lOad lOb1, DK.Q.Ba.3.27 lar271 b4, DK.R.Ba.3.7b1-8b1, DK.S.Ba.3.8as-9b3, DK.T.Ba.3.5b-6n."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 369 and not to his own body, the corpse will be a \"risen corpse\" (ro langs, *vetiila). Eventually, when someone like a great scholar (pa!u/ita) or Dharma king dies, the yogi might go there and insert his own consciousness into that person's dead body, take it over, and discard his own old body. This is said in the segment to be possible due to the yogi's mastery of the winds (rlung brtan pa), his conviction and faith (mos pa dang dad pa), his intense dedication (rt sol ba drag po), and his total conviction that the whole of existence is a mere illusion (snang srid sgyu mar mos).

It ends (DK.A.Ba.4.8b6): /des ni dbang po rah cig sangs rgya ba'i lam rdzogs par bstan to//.906 The fourth segment is an instruction on Inner Heat (gtum mo). The segment begins by mentioning that there are three practices that lead to liberation by relying on the \"upper gate\" or the \"upper aperture\" (steng sgo rnam par grol ba'i lam). The upper gate (steng sgo, *urdhvadviira) refers to the cakra at the top of the head, as opposed to the lower cakra in the genitals. The three instructions related to the upper cakra are: (1) the instruction on cultivating bliss (bde ba bsgom pa'i man ngag), (2) the instruction on cultivating the Illusory Body (sgyu lus bsgom pa 'i man ngag), and (3) the instruction on cultivating Radiance ('ad gsal bsgom pa'i man ngag). The present segment explains the first of these three, the instruction on cultivating bliss, which, in fact, is another name for the practice of gtum mo. After a reference to the pertinent lines dealing with gtum mo in the Hevajratantra, the segment begins by explaining the method of meditating on the nature of things (dngos po'i gnas thabs), which denotes an explanation on the bodily channels and winds. It is notable that the central channel (avadhuti) here is discussed in some detail. The segment refers both to an 'explained' central channel (bshad tshod kyi dhiiti) as well as to a 'natural' central channel (gnyug ma'i dhuti), which is said to be extremely subtle, minute, and completely invulnerable. It is also explained that this natural central channel signifies the true nature of the mind, which also referred to as \"the nature of things\" (dngos po'i gnas lugs, *mulaprakrti). That is followed by explanations on the bodily meditation posture, the inner visualization of the flaming stroke of the letter 'A' beneath the navel, the descending dissolution of bodhicitta from the blissful letter haf(l at the crown of the head, and the meditation on bliss-emptiness by merging bodhicitta into the navel-cakra. 906 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.1 47bi-149a5 and DK.a.Nga.150�-15 la1, DK.B.Ba.4.6�-8b6, DK.D.Ba.4.6a3-8bs, DK.P.Ba.4.311 a1-31 3b1, DK.Q.Ba.4.271 b4-274a3, DK.R.Ba.4.8b2-12a6, DK.S.Ba.4.9b3-l4a5, DK.T.Ba.4.6n-8b.

The drop descends down through the central channel to the genitals, spreading along the way a sensation of bliss-emptiness. Thereupon, the drop ascends in the same manner. This visualization is to be repeated several times. For the post­meditative phase (rjes thob pa, *pr�.thalabdha, literally \"the ensuing attainment), the yogfis instructed to train in experiencing all sensory impressions as blis sful and to maintain a constant sense of inner heat and the soothing, cooling bliss of the descending bodhicitta. It is said that the experience of everything as being blissful will automatically give rise to the experience of non-thought (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa). This portion of the segment ends with a brief colophon, saying \"This is the meditation on ca(u/alf, the instruction pointed out by the old lady\" (!d i ni tsmyja li bsgom pa ste/ rgan mo 'dzub tshugs kyi gdams pa'o/I).\" It would seem that the \"old lady\" (rgan mo) is probably a reference to the female deity of the nia(ir/ala, here perhaps Nairiitmya, the consort of Hevajra. The segment's main explanation is followed by two supplements marked as separate parts in the text. The first supplement (DK.A.Ba.5.8a3-4) provides a brief explanation from an alternative tradition (yang lugs cig la) on how to hold the wind in the navel-cakra using different techniques of gazing in order to dispel agitation and dullness.907 The second supplement (DK.A.Ba.5.8as-8b5) gives an explanation attributed to Nampa, which distinguishes three progressive levels of controlling the wind. These three levels are refer­red to as \"holding the wind in the central channel\" (rlung dhutir bzung ba), \"holding the wind in the mind\" (rlung sems su bzung ba), and \"holding the wind in radiance\" (rlung 'od gsal du bzung ba). The supplement also briefly indicates the different signs (rtags, *nimitta or *liliga) of a successful practice. It is mentioned at which stage of the practice the yo gf is self-sufficient enough no longer to have to rely on a teacher, and -with reference to the chapter on \"The Certainty of Success\" in the Hevajratantra908 -it is indicated after how long the yo gf will achieve the fruition of buddhahood.

The manuscript in question is ms no. A15 (ST. PETERSBURG BRANCH, 1998:244-246). It is entitled Mengl1Uan shen yaomen C��J :!iff�i'l), \"The Essential Entry to the Dream and Illusory Body [Practice].\" SHEN correctly identifies this to be an incomplete Chinese translation of segment DK.A.Ba.6, having only minor variations between the Chinese translation and the current Tibetan text. The translation might be datable to the late twelfth century, when several Tibetan Bka' brgyud teachers were invited to Tangut. The terminus ante quern for the translation is 1374 when Khara Khoto, the capital of the Tangut kingdom and the site of the manuscript's excavation, was destroyed in warfare and subsequently abandoned due to the encroaching desert (see SHEN, 2005: 189). IN 2005, SHEN published a more thorough study in English concerning the same finding, which includes an introduction, editions of the Chinese and Tibetan texts, an English translation, a comparative discussion, and a discussion of sources for Bsod nams rin chen's instructions on Dream yoga (rmi lam) giving a short survey of earlier works on this topic. His Tibetan edition is only based on two modern prints of Sgam po pa's works, namely the 1975 Lahul edition (DK.Q) and the 1982 Hemis edition (DK.R)."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"372 Chapter 5: The Dags po 'i bka' 'bum dream\" (rmi lam gyi 'du shes sngon du btang ba) elucidates how to form an intention to recognize the dreams before falling asleep. The third point called \"recognizing the dream as a dream\" (rmi lam la rmi lam du ngo shes par bya ba) explains briefly how to enter into lucid dreaming during sleep. The fourth point, \"honing the dre am\" (rmi lam bogs dbyung ba), consists in cultivating the experience of dreams as being empty and unreal. The fifth point, \"purifying the dream\" (rmi lam sbyang ba), is an explanation on how the yogi should turn dreams into religious dreams of <Jaki�iis, buddhas giving teachings, etc., and how that will give rise to blessing. These explanations on the Dream practice are followed by a precept for contemplating the Illusory Body in the post-meditative phase (rjes thob), i.e., the wakened state. The yogi meditates on everything being dream-like and then does the same practice of looking into a mirror as described under segment DK.A.Pa. I 0. The meditator thus contemplates the illusory nature both during sleep and while awake, blending these phases into one. An advice is given on how to use the technique of pot- like breathing (bum pa can, *kumbhaka) before going to sleep for the purpose of stirring up dreams in case the meditator finds it difficult to recognize the dreams as dreams. It is said that the practices on illusion taught here are certain to bring attainment (dngos grub, *siddhi) in the present life, but even a yogi who is not yet fully able to control his dreams will still be able to recognize the interim after death (bar do, *antarabhava) simply by having been somewhat able to recognize his dreams as dreams. By practicing Illusory Body in the interim, he will then find liberation. These points are followed by an explanation on how to combine the practice of Dream (rmi lam, *svapna) and [deep] sleep (gnyid, *nidra) into a single practice by advancing to the practice of Radiance ('od gsal, *prabhasvara). The yogi must first achieve mastery of the practices of Dream and Illusory Body, and he can then begin the practice of Radiance. Focusing on a brilliantly shining letter hum in the heart-cakra, the practitioner falls asleep into a state of bliss and enters the awareness of Radiance while sleeping. Since entering a state of dream would be an adverse condition ('gal rkyen) for this practice, a wake person may assist the sleeping yogi and gently wake him up when and if he enters into any dream state. In this way, the yogi can practice three or four sessions of Radiance while sleeping. The segment says that by becoming able to enter the state of Radiance during sleep, he will become able easily to enter the Radiance at death when he dies. A brief summary of the process of dying is then given using the same vocabulary as above when explaining the process of falling asleep in the Dream yoga. It is said that if the yogi is unable to maintain the Radiance of death, he will enter the interim (bar do) and may there be able to reach liberation through the practice of Illusory Body. If he is also unable to do so, then he should block eventual rebirth by not harboring feelings of attraction and dislike towards the future parents (whom he will see in a vision having sexual intercourse) and should instead aim at taking rebirth in a celestial realm (mtho ris, *svarga).

If the observance (dam tshig, *samaya) is broken, there is a grave risk of falling into hell. 373 The colophon thus describes the traditional transmission line of these instructions, which it refers to as the Quintessential Illusory Body instruction. It is uncertain to which teacher the word Rin po che (\"the precious one\") mentioned in the second sentence might refer, but clearly it must be someone post-dating Mar pa Lho brag pa, the teacher of Mi la ras pa.

It begins by explaining that the yogi first must deprive himself of sleep for three days. Then he must lie down and do the visualization of syllables in his heart-cakra (as previously summarized under segment DK.A.Pa.8). Falling asleep with this visualization, the practitioner enters into the experience of the Radiance of sleep (gnyid 'ad gsal), where the sleep has a flavor of bliss-emptiness. He must guard himself against dreaming, since dreams are an adverse condition for this practice. After one session of the practice, he should sit up and check whether or not the sleep turned into the sleep of ignorance (ma rig pa'i gnyid). Then he can lie down again and in like manner perform four­five sessions during one night. As the outer perceptions and ever more subtle states of thought dissolve, the yogi again enters into the state of vivid bliss-emptiness by letting his awareness continue into the state 912 Correl ated passages: DK.a.Nga.1 52bs- 1 54a2, DK.B.Ba.7.11b4-l3a3, DK.D.Ba.7.11 b3-13a2, DK.P.Ba.7.3 l 7ar318b3, DK.Q.Ba.7.276b6-278a3, DK.R.Ba.7.16b1-18b3, DK.S.Ba.7.19br22a2, DK.T.Ba.7.l lb-13n."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"374 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum of deep sleep. Thereby, ignorance will naturally cease, the foci of thought will subside, and Radiance having the nature of knowledge will emerge. The yogi must remain in this state without allowing his consciousness to move anywhere. Upon awaking, the yogi must practice the post-meditative phase in the waking state by placing a picture (thang sku) of the chosen deity (yi dam) in front of himself and direct the mind one-pointedly on the picture. Thereafter he should cultivate an inner feeling of presence and bliss-emptiness. The final part of the segment explains the criteri a for a successful practice and mentions that someone who has accomplished the practice of Radiance will attain the highest accomplishment in this life. Even if he is unable to do so, he will recognize the Radiance in the interim (bar do, *antanibhava) and reach buddhahood there. Possessing this skill, it is impossible for him to be reborn against his will, and if he takes rebirth it will only be with the intention of benefiting others. The segment then refers to the story of Acarya *Kambala (lwa ha pa), who attained accomplishment by sleeping for thirteen years. It also gives two scriptural quotations from the Hevajra-and Mahamayatantras. The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): [This is] the instruction of the secret spiritual practice (thugs dam gsang ba) of the precious teacher (bla ma rin po che).

The abbot of Dags Iha Sgam po monastery at the time, who was responsible for the making of this print, was Bsod nams lhun grub zla 'od rgyal mtshan dpal bzang po (1488-1552, in short Sgam po Bsod nams lhun grub). He belonged to the family-line that had descended from Bsod nams rin chen's brother. He held the abbacy of the monastery in the years 1510/11-1531 (S0RENSEN & DOLMA, 2007:48). The place name Mount Santi (Ri bo shanti) is a common name for Dags Iha sgam po (op.cit.:52). This particular printing colophon was employed in ms DK.A by at least four different scribes (yi ge pa). From the colophon alone, it is therefore not possible to deduce who the scribe of text DK.A.Ba was. At the end of texts DK.A.'a, DK.A.Sha, and DK.A.Ki, one scribe using this printing colophon reveals himself to be a man named Shes rab kun dga', who in the scribal colophon of text Ki also is stated to be a descendant (dbon po). At the end of text DK.A.Khi, the same printing colophon is used by a scribe named Dar po. In text DK.A.Ci, it is again used by a scribe named Dkon mchog skyabs, and at the end of text DK.A.Varp, it used by the above-mentioned scribe Kun dga rin chen belonging to the monastic house (bla 'brang) of A phyags. In consideration of the several different scribes employing the printing colophon and of the fact that the colophon occurs at the end of most the texts (texts no. 20, 22-36, and 40) belonging to the second half of ms DK.A, it seems that the colophon is not so much a personal scribal colophon as it is a general printing cola-913 Correlated passages: DK.B.Ba.8.13a3-l 5b6, DK.D.Ba.8. l 3ar 15b6, DK.P.Ba.8.3 l 8b3-321 b5, DK.Q.Ba.8.278<4-280bs, DK.R.Ba.8. l 8b4-23a2, DK.S.Ba.8.22ar27a2, DK.T.Ba.8.13n-l 5b.

A [red] sindhura substance is [to be placed] in the maw;lala of [the goddess] Vajra-Knowledge (Rdo rj e ye shes, *Vajrajfiiina), [who represents] Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po rdo rj e ye shes kyi dkyil 'khor du sin dhu ra 'i dbang bskur ba). The goddess in question is Vajrayoginf (rdo rj e rnal 'byor ma) or Vajraviiriihl (rdo rj e phag mo) having one face and two arms. She is surrounded by a retinue of four other goddesses. Once the teacher, who is imparting the empowerment, has visualized himself as Vajra­yoginf surrounded by her retinue and has recited their mantras, he applies red sindhura paste to a mirror and with his finger traces in the paste a *dharmodaya symbol (chos byung) in the form of two intertwined triangles wherein he writes the pertinent �akin! mantras. Placing the mirror in the middle of the mm:i4ala, he arranges various offering substances around it, including a suitable kapiila filled with beer. Having again visualized himself as the goddess, he recites her mantra and then visualizes Vajrayoginf and her retinue standing in the mirror smeared with the sindhura paste. After inviting the yoginfs to come to the empowerment site from U��iyana and to merge with the ma!i�ala in the mirror, the yogi recites the mantra, proceeds to bless the beer in the kapiila, and then sprinkles the other offerings with this blessed liquid. Having recited offering prayers and praises, the students who are receiving the empowerment take refuge and make prostrations while reciting a prayer. Having instructed the students on how to sit in the right sitting posture and the use of the pot-like breathing technique (bum pa can, *kumbhaka), the bla ma proceeds to bless the students with the mirror, the beer in the kapiila, and a sviistika. These steps constitute the vase empowerment (bum pa'i dbang, *kalasiibhi�eka). The second empowerment called the secret empowerment (gsang ba'i dbang, *guhyiibhi�eka) is bestowed by making the students taste a little milk mixed with beer and blessing pills, while instructing them in how to meditate on their their bodies as being full of bliss. The teacher then displays a symbol of wisdom (ye shes brda, *jiiiinaketu) while instructing the students how to meditate on non-thought (mi rtog pa, *nirvikal pa). This constitutes the third empowerment called the insight-wisdom empowerment (shes rab ye shes dbang, *prajfiiijfiiiniibhi�eka). 922 The transliterations-ho is here used to indicate the stacked letter-combination sa ha btags s-ha na ro s-ho, i.e., a superscript sa letter with a subscript ha letter with the o-vowel on top of the stack.

Then he visualizes the inner offering in the form of a large kapiila filled with impure substances that are transformed into the wisdom nectar (ye shes kyi bdud rtsi, *jiianamrta). These visualizations are explained in some detail in the segment. Reciting a mantra three times, the guests for receiving the offering are invited from beneath and above the ground, and everything appears as the 111a�1tjala of Vajravariihf with her retinue of four goddesses surrounded by a charnel ground.

Relying on another visualization of syllables in his heart-cakra, he invites the ma!Jtjala of Vajrayoginl to abide in the space in front of him and visualizes that he offers to them the inner offering (nang me hod) in similar terms as described above under segment DK.* A.Ma.2. Vajrayoginfs attendant-goddesses melt into the central goddess and she assumes a nature of bliss. Again, the yogi imagines that he presents her with various outer offerings, such as flowers, incense, etc., and the text says that he should recite many prayers.

Thereupon, the yogi imagines that many goddesses of sensory pleasure ('dod pa'i yon tan gyi !ha mo) stream out from Vajra­yoginf's heart, holding empowerment vases and flowers.

After making prostrations and offerings to the goddesses, the yogi imagines that the goddesses return to the pure land of *Akanistha.

At this point (DK.B.Ma.4.7bs), the segment contains a short colophon stating that \"[this ritual] was written down according to the oral instruction of the precious bla ma\" (bla ma rin po che'i zhal gyi gdams ngag yi ger bkod pa'o). To this are appended two prayers written in verse, which are common in the later liturgy of the Bka' brgyud traditions, as well as a third prayer in six verse lines said to have been derived from the liturgy of the \"thirteen deity\" ma(?<;lala practice (lha bcu gsum), perhaps referring to the liturgy of the thirteen deity Vajrabhairava practice. With the mantra \"vajra mu(?,\" the invited host of deities, spirits, and protectors are again sent away. The segment ends with a short colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"This [instruction] from the mouth of the bla ma is [a ritual] for drawing the ritual food offering into Suchness (gtor ma'i de nyid bsdus pa).

The fifth instruction manual contains teach­i ngs on the Six Dharmas of Naropa as well as several instructions on the four interims (bar do, *antarabhava) and their mixing (bsre ba, *mifra). It is also the only text in the Dags po'i bka' 'b um to provide explanations on the more advanced Tantric practice of *karma­mudra (las kyi phyag rgya), i.e., sexual union. While the Six Dharmas of Naropa often are explained as being associated with the second Tantric empowerment (gsang ba'i dbang, *guhyabhi�eka), the practice of sexual union is said to be associated with the third empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang, zprajiiajiianabhi�eka). It thus represents a stage of practice that may be performed after having perfected the yogas of the Six Dharmas.

Although written in prose, some of its sentences are written in meter and may be extracts from other texts. Several lines, in both prose and verse, are reminiscent of the Bka' dpe root text for the gtum mo practice. The key-points covered in the segment include the sitting posture, the visualiza­tion of the three channels, and the visualization of the A-vowel stroke in the navel-cakra.

The [left] channel (rkyang ma, *lala­na) is said to represent insight (shes rah, *praj11a) and the pure object (gzung ba dag pa, *vifuddhagrahya), while [right] channel (ro ma, *rasani'i) signifies the method (thabs, *upaya) and the pure subject ('dzin pa dag pa, *visuddhagri'ihaka).933 The central channel (kun [']dar ma, *avadhii.ti) represents the abandonment of both object and subject (gzung 'dzin gnyis ka spangs pa). Next, it is stated that Inner Heat (gtum mo) comes about through diligent practice (rtsolsgrub), the practices of Dream (rmi lam) and the Interim (bar do) depend on motivation ('dun pa), Transference ('pho ba) comes from focus (dmigs pa), while sample-knowledge (dpe'i ye shes) arises from the sexual union practice with an action partner (las kyi phyag rgya, *karmamudra). Finally, the segment briefly lists four circumstances where [non-dual] knowledge (ye shes, *jni'ina) is said to arise naturally, namely (1) during sexual intercourse (pho mo snyoms 'jug byed pa), (2) when [the breath] changes between the right and the left [side-channel] or vice versa (g.yas g.yon 'pho dus su), (3) in the interim after having died (shi nas bar do'i dus su), and ( 4) during intense rage (zhe sdang drag po'i dus su). It is stated that these are called the six circumstances during which Radiance [naturally] arises ('od gsal skye ba 'i dus su rgyu drug).934 932 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.71 b2.6, DK.B.Tsa.3.2a6-2b4, DK.D.Tsa.3.2a3-2b3, DK.P.Tsa.3.331 a3-33 l b1, DK.Q.Tsa.3.289as-289b2, DK.R.Tsa.3.2bs-3as, DK.S.Tsa.3.2bdas, DK.T.Tsa.3.2n-2b, Phyag chen mdzodvol. Ka (TBRC W23447-1 894) pp. 256-26s. 933 In all the available recensions, the segment reverses the words 'left' and 'right', so that the present passage describes the rkyang ma channel as being situated on the right and the ro ma channel as being situated on the left. This, however, seems to be an error, since all other passages in the corpus mentioning the side-channels follows the usual pattern that rkyang ma is the left channel while ro ma is the right. Hence, the words 'left' and 'right' have been placed in square brackets in this summary to indicate that this is a corrected proposed by the present author. 934 It is notable that the present list actually only specifies four circumstances and not six. There are, however, other similar lists of the \"naturally occuring Radiance\" given elsewhere in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum that additionally include fainting, sneezing, and falling asleep. The basic notion that there exist ordinary sm7isii.ric situations in which the nature of the mind spontaneously appears in the form of a brief non-conceptual state is highly significant, because it seems that these circumstances constitutes the experiential basis for the Six Dharmas of Naropa and other types of Tantric practice. Thus, the experiences of non-conceptuality that briefly occur during orgasm and when the predominance of the breath shifts from one nostril to the other (as it is said to do several times each day and night) seem to be the two principles that are utilized in the spiritual practices of sexual union (las kyi phyag rgya, *karmamudrii.) and Inner Heat (gtum mo). The sexual element in the the latter practice takes the form of an inward simulation of sexual arousal in the form of white bodhicitta (i.e., semen) descending downwards to the genitals while producing a steadily increasing feeling of bliss. The unraveling of the ordinary self and the ensuing state of non-conceptuality that occur during deep sleep is the basis for the practice of Radiance ( 'od gsa[) and perhaps also for the practice of Dream (nni lam), although the latter yoga is not directly concerned with the non-conceptuality of deep sleep"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 383 Segment DK.A.Tsa.4: The segment begins (DK.A.Tsa.4.2b s): bla ma dam pa rnams la phyags 'tshal lo/ /rmi lam gyi man ngag la bzhi ste/. It ends (DK.A.Tsa.4.3a6): rmi lam gyi man ngag rin po che 'i thugs dam/. 935 The fourth segment offers an abridged delineation of the Dream yoga practice (rmi lam). The yoga is here explained in four points: (1) recogni­zing or capturing the dream (rmi lam bzung ha), (2) training in the dream (rmi lam yangs su sbyang ba), (3) knowing that the dream is illusory (rmi lam sgyu mar shes par bya ha), and (4) contemplating the true nature of the dream (rmi lam gyi de kho na nyid bsgom pa). In the present explanation, the visualization for falling asleep is not based on visualizing syllables in the throat-cakra as seen in the earlier rmi lam manuals, but instead the yogf is here instructed to imagine a sphere of light (thig le) between the eyebrows (smin phrag). Otherwise, the directives found here correspond largely to those seen in the earlier rmi lam s egments DK.A.Pa.9 and DK.A.Ba.6. At the end, the present segment instructs the yogf to employ the Dream practice at the time of death by meditating on the stages of dying in the same manner as he has earlier meditated on the stages of falling asleep. It is said that he in this way will be able to enter the Radiance of the interim (bar do 'od gsal, *antarii­bhavaprabhiisvara) and realize Mahiimudrii in the interim as long as he does not give rise to sexual attraction and jealous anger towards the parents of his future rebirth (whom he will see having sex prior to his entry into the mother's womb). However, if he should wish to take rebirth, the segment says he should engender a strong aspiration to be born in the pure land of Sukhiivatf (bde ba can). The segment ends with the colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the transmission on Dream, the spiritual practice (thugs dam) of the precious one.\" Segment DK.A.Tsa.5: The segment begins (DK.A.Tsa.5.3a6): lldpal ldan bde ba'i sku la phyag 'tshal lo/ /gnyis su med pa'i ye shes bde ba chen po'i sku dang/.

It provides a general but doctrinally sophisticated survey of the Tantric path, including the Generation Stage, the Completion Stage, and a brief overview of the Six Dharmas of Naropa. The segment begins by proclaiming that the state (sku, *kaya) of non-dual wisdom and great bliss (gnyis su med pa'i ye shes bde ba chen po, *advayajiiiinamahiisuk ha) exists naturally (rang bzhin gyis gnas, *prakrtistha) within all sentient beings. The mean s to make but is rather involved in manipulating dreams. The experiences of non-conceptuality in the process of dying and in the interim seem to be the principles behind the practices of Transference ('pho ba) as well as the Interim (bar do). It is though not immediately clear how the practices of Illusory Body (sgyu !us) and Body-Entering (grong 'jug) would fit into this scheme. 935 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.71 b6-72b2, DK.B.Tsa.4.2b4-3a6, DK.D.Tsa.4.2br3�, DK.P.Tsa.4.331 b1-332as, DK.Q.Tsa.4.289bi-290a3, DK.R.Tsa.4.3a5-4b1, DK.S.Tsa.4.3a5-4b1, DK.T.Tsa.4.2b- 3n, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

In the first point, referred to as \"the nature of things\" (dngos po'i gnas lugs, *mitla­prakrti), the segment stresses the need to know the nature of the body (lus dngos po'i gnas lugs) and the nature of the mind (sems dngos po'i gnas lugs). The explanation on the nature of the body, concerning its inner channels and winds, is not elaborated here, but the nature of the mind is elucidated through a teaching on presence (gsal ba, *vyakti), bliss (bde ba, *sukha), and emptiness (stong pa, *sunya). These three characteristics are explicated in some detail with some reference to the radiance of awareness (rig pa 'od gsal) and the natural radiance (rang bzhin gyi 'od gsal). The text distinguishes these concepts from similar notions taught in the Cittamatra philosophical tradition (sems tsam pa), as well as from ordinary bliss (tha mal pa'i zag pa dang bcas pa'i bde ba), the bliss of nirva�w (nyan thos lta bu zhi ba'i bde ba), and various conceptions of emptiness (stong pa).937 In the second point explaining the stages of the path, a brief introduction is given to the theme of the four Tantric empowerments (dbang, *abhi�eka) and their associated precepts (dam tshig, *samaya). This is followed by an outline of the Generation and Completion Stages of deity practice. For the Generation Stage, two phases are mentioned. The first phase involves building a retreat hut with windows to reflect sunlight onto a painting and then using the painting to learn to visualize the deity (cf. segment DK.A.Ba.2). The second phase is the actual Generation Stage (bskyed rim, *utpa ttikrama), where the yogi must train in viewing its elements as being illusory (sgyu ma lta bu). The Completion Stage (rdzogs rim, *sm71pannakra111a) is presented through a rather detailed explanation on twelve ways of mixing (bsre ba, *mifra) the three types of interim (bar do rnam pa gsum). The three interims in question are the interim between birth and death (skye shi bar do), the interim of dream (rmi lam bar do), and the interim of becoming (srid pa bar do), i.e., of entering into a new rebirth. Having presented twelve aspects of these three states, the segment gives a detailed outline of the practice of Dream (rmi lam). This expl anation surveys the various stages of Dream yoga and gives instructions on how to mix this practice with the experience of the hallucinatory character of the waking state, with the Radiance ( 'od gsal) that appears in deep sleep, and how to apply the instruction at the time of death. Thereupon, the segment turns to the yoga of Inner Heat (gtum mo). Inner Heat is said to involve 42 different aspects, which can be summed up in five main points: (1) the Inner Heat of yoga (rnal 'byor gyi gtum mo) consisting in explanations on the bodily posture, the channels, the winds, and the mind; (2) the Inner Heat of knowledge (ye shes kyi gtum mo) consisting in the particular breathing technique needed for the practice; (3) the Inner Heat of action (las kyi gtum mo) concerned with the visualization of the A-syllable stroke beneath the navel; (4) the Inner Heat of Mahamudra (phyag rgya chen po'i gtum mo) 937 For a discussion of the passage in the context of Tibetan Yogacara transmissions, see KRAGH (2013b: 1376-1 377)."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 385 consisting of pressing down the winds and thereby resting the mind in non-duality ; and (5) the great Inner Heat (gtum mo chen mo) giving miscellaneous advice on how to manipulate the winds. These points are briefly laid out in the segment. This is followed by an explanation on how to train in the Action Seal (las rgya, *karmamudra), i.e., the practice of Tantric sexual union. First, there are a series of exercises to be done in order to try to feel bliss in relation to each of the five sensory objects. That is followed by advice on sexual arousal and retention of orgasm during sexual intercourse. The actual techniques are not explained in great detail but are merely indicated in a few suggestive words, causing the passage to be rather convoluted. The segment ends by explaining how to implement the union practice during the day-and nighttime, with the nighttime practices consisting in the Dream yoga (rmi lam) techniques.

It begins by stating that mere [non-conceptual] [mental] abiding (gnas pa, *[ citta]sthiti) should not be a major focus for meditation. This is because such [non-conceptual] abiding is a mental feature that is also present even during [various natural forms of non-conceptuality, including] unconsciousness, deep sleep, and intoxication, but these states do not involve realization (rtogs pa). Realization, on the other hand, is defined as knowing all experiences or appearances (snang ba, *avabhasa) to be mind (sems, *citta), since they are clearly perceived and present (gsal ba, *vyakta). That which experiences this presence (gsal ba, *vyakti) is called the mind (sems, *citta), since it is aware (rig pa, *sm?ivid or *vidya). Awareness (rig pa) is not established by au/ nature of its own but is empty. A sustained experience and realization of awareness is what is called meditation (sgom pa, *bhavana). The instruction is followed by a short explanation arguing that everything is mind, the mind is free from any identifiable characteristic, and self-awareness is empty of any ultimate reality .

This will give rise to four levels of joy, i.e., sexual arousal. While experiencing these, he should concentrate on the nature of his mind. Thereupon, he performs the practice of Inner Heat, whereby the wind element dissolves into the fire element giving rise to the dissolution sign of 'smoke' (rtags du ba). The white bodhicitta (byang sems, i.e., semen) then descends from the crown of his head to the penis (rdo rje nor bu, *vajraratna). At this point, the male yogi must remain in a meditative state without ejaculating any semen, thereby causing the water element to dissolve into the fire element, which produces the mirage-like sign (rtags smig sgyu lta bu). When the flow of bodhicitta has reached the very tip of the penis (rdo rje rtse mo, *vajrasekhara), the male yogi must reverse its flow back up to the crown of his head. Thereby, the water element dissolves into the earth element, causing the lamp-like sign (rtags mar me lta bu) to appear. When this experience has bec ome very steady and the firefly-like sign has appeared, that constitutes the perfection of tranquility meditation (gzhi nas, *famatha), equivalent to the meditative concentration ( *samadhi) of the first level of absorption (bsam gtan dang po, *prathamadhyana). Interrupting this abs orption, the yogi should then train in insight meditation (lhag mthong, *vipasyana). That is here done by means of a visualization focusing on a small ball of light (thig le, *bindu) in the heart-cakra , which gradually turns into an experience of radiance and emptiness ( 'od gsal stong pa nyid). Thereby, the sign which is like a cloudless sky appears (sprin med pa'i nam mkha' lta bu'i rtags) and the yogi realizes the selflessness of all phenomena to be like the ungraspable center of the sky.

It might be noted that the Dags po'i bka' 'bum corpus nowhere provides instruction on the practice of sexual union for the female practitioner, unless the metonymic terminology -such as \"vajra jewel\" (rdo rje nor bu) and \"vajra tip\" (rdo rje rtse mo) -used here might also be understood as corresponding to specific locations in the woman's body.

This is followed by a short explanation on the liberation path (grol lam, *muk�amarga).

Then they must meditate on their bodies being deities, all speech being mantra, and the mind being the true nature.

It sets out by emphasizing the need for abolishing thoughts of attachment to this world ('jig rten 'di yi rnam rtog). Then the meditator must purify the mind by analyzing its character, purify the body through the Generation Stage practice of visualizing himself as a deity, and purify the speech by the mental recitation of the mantra of Hevajra (de wa pi tsu bzlas pa). Seeing all things as illusory (sgyu ma, *maya), the yogf then trains in the various stages of Dream yoga (rmi lam). Thereupon, he learns to mix the experiences of Illusory [Body] and Dream (sgyu ma dang rmi lam bsre ba) and those of the Interim and Radiance (bar do dang 'ad gsal bsre ba). He trains in the [four] interims of life-to-death (skyes nas 'chi ba 'i bar do), of dream (rmi lam gyi bar do), of becoming (srid pa bar do), and of meditative absorption (bsam gtan gyi bar do). Analyzing the unarisen nature of the mind, he realizes the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittata) to be free from the two extremes of existence and non-existence. This is the state of radiance ('ad gsal, \"\"prabhasvara). After providing a few scriptural quotations, the segment briefly instructs that the meditator should neither follow traces of thoughts about the past nor welcome thoughts about the future, but he should instead rest spontaneously in the present. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.Tsa.10: The segment begins (DK.A.Tsa.1 0.9a5): //bla ma dam pa rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ !bar do dang po 'ad gsal ngos bzung ba dang/.

It starts by saying that in the first interim (bar do dang po) the yogishould recognize Radiance ('ad gsal ngos bzung ba), in the second interim he should recognize the Illusory Body (sgyu lus ngos bzung ba), and in the third interim he shouldblock the door to the womb (mngal sgo 'gegs pa). Thereupon, the stages of dying are presented, where the physical elements dissolve one into another, a process that is accompanied by specific bodily signs. When the outer breathing has ceased, four phases or moments (skad cig ma, *k�a�w) occur, wherein four outer and four inner signs or visions (rtags) appear. It should be noted that these signscorrespond to the signs that the yogi is said to experience in the dissolution stages of InnerHeat, Dream yoga, and other practices of the Six Dhannas of Naropa. In particular, theseare the smoke-like sign (r tags du ba lta bu), the firefly-like sign (rtags srin bu me khyer !ta bu), the lamp-like sign (rtags mar me lta bu), and the cloudless sky-like sign (rtags sprinmed pa'i nam mkha' lta bu). Thereby, the yogic practices are correlated with the stages ofdeath. Along therewith, the mind undergoes four stages of dissolution of conceptuality, whichare called light (snang ba, *iiloka), the rising of light (snang ba mched pa, *alokavrddhi),the arrival of rising (mched pa thob pa, *vrddhilabdha), and the great arrival (thob pa chen po, *mahiilabdha) (cf. segment DK.A.Pa.13). Thereupon, the natural radiance (rang bzhin gyis 'ad gsal, *prakrtiprabhiisvara) appears to the deceased. This is the point when the yogi should attempt to recognize radiance in the first interim (bar do dang po 'ad gsal ngos bzung ba). If unable to do so, the deceased will enter the second interim. Here the yogi should attempt to meditate on himself as the illusory form of his chosen deity (yi dam lha) while cultivating the experience of radiance. Thereby, the fire of radiance will burn away all his earlier bodily tendencies and the yo gf will achieve dhannakaya. If also unable to accomplish this, the deceased will enter the third interim. There , the yogi must attempt to block the door to the womb by thinking of everything as being illusory, by not giving rise to attraction and hatred to the prospective parents of his future rebirth, and by meditating on them and himself as deities. If this is insufficient, he may also try to view the prospective parents as being his bla ma in union with a female consort, thereby avoiding feelings of sexual attraction and hatred. If a state of detachment is impossible to maintain, he must instead give rise to strong compassion for all sentient beings and wish to be born as a universal monarch ('khor las bsgyur ba 'i rgyal po, *cakravartin) or as Indra, the king of the gods, in order to achieve a rebirth where he can bring great benefit to many sentient beings. He may also aspire to be reborn in a pure land. Here the segment quotes some unspecified sentences pertaining to the seven weeks of the interim, adding a few explanatory comments. The segment has no colophon. 942 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha. 78b3-79b6, DK.B.Tsa.10.9a5-10a1, DK.D.Tsa.10.9a4-l0bi, DK.P.Tsa.10.340a,-34lb3, DK.Q.Tsa.10.296b3-298b5, DK.R.Tsa.10.15b4-l 7bs, DK.S.Tsa.10. 15a4-l 7b2, DK.T.Tsa.10.9n-10b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The segment then shortly lists different means for blocking rebirth. Thereupon, it describes how the interim (bar do, *antarabhava) will appear out of the state of radiance ('od gsal, *prabhasvara) shortly after passing away, if the deceased does not recognize radiance when dying. This process happens through the stages called the light (snang ba, *aloka) and the rising of the light of dhannakaya (snang ba chos sku la mched pa, *iilokadharmakayavrddhi), both of which involve a subtle rising of thought and conceptuality (rnam pa rtog pa, *vikalpa). The segment identifies this process as sm11sara ('khor ba). However, if the practitioner is able to recognize radiance, he will not enter sm11siira and will not veer from the state of non-duality (gnyis med kyi ngang las ma yengs pa). Next, the segment briefly indicates the interims of life from birth to death (skye shi bar do), dream (rmi lam bar do), and becoming (srid pa bar do), and how the practitioner should mix (bsre ba, *mi.§ra) each interim with particular yogic experiences. Finally, there is a brief passage on the result, where there is no longer anything to be mixed (bsre bya) and no one doing the mixing (bsre byed). This includes a brief mention of the practice of Transference ('pho ba, *smJikriinti), which is explained in the segment by several short interlinear notes (mchan bu).

Fearing to forget this mere drop that I am able to retain in my mind from the ocean-like sayings of the bla ma, I have written down [this text] in order to refresh my memory. Having thus attributed the following explanations to the bla ma as being his oral sayings, the segment next quotes the first two verses of the Bka' dpe, i.e., the mnemonic root-text for the Six Dharmas of Naropa. Commenting on these lines in prose, an explanation is given on three points: ( 1) the key-point of the body (!us kyi gnad) explaining the sitting posture; (2) the key-point of the (meditative) foci (yul kyi gnad) mentioning different alternative visualizations; and (3) the key-point of the time (dus kyi gnad) where various activities are correlated with different yogic practices focusing on different cakras. Thereupon, two more lines are quoted from Bka' dpe indicating the gtum mo pot-like breathing technique (bum pa can, *kumbhaka), which is then explained along with the signs of success. The latter point is supported by a quotation of two lines here attributed to \"the venerable bla ma\" (bla ma rje btsun). The same lines were attributed to Bla ma Mid la in segment DK.A.Nga.7.

Mentioning briefly what practices are to be done in each state, the segment gives more attention to the interim of becoming. It is here explained how the yogfin this state should first attempt to recognize Radiance (bar do dang par 'od gsal ngos bzung ba), secondly train in the Illusory Body (gnyis pa sgyu lus sbyang ba), and thirdly block the door to the womb of reincarnation (gsum pa mngal sgo 'gegs pa).

It is only explained very briefly, since it simply involves resting unwaveringly in radiance when dying. The second type, used by average practitioners, is called \"Transference through Illusory Body\" (sgyu lus kyis 'pho ba) and is given some further consideration in the text. The yogf should have trained during his life in the Dream yoga. In his dreams, he must previously have traveled to the heaven of the Vedic gods of the 33 mansions (Sum cu rtsa gsum, *Trayastri171fa) and should there have made aspirations to realize Mahiimudrii at the bles­sed Armolika rock (ar mo li ka'i rdo Zeb) on which the Buddha sat when he taught his deceased mother. After dying, the yogf must again travel through the interim to the same holy stone and while meditating there, it is said that he will attain the full accomplishment of Mahiimudra. The third type, used by lesser practitioners, is called \"Transference through the Genera­tion Stage\" (bskyed rim gyis 'pho ba).

The syllables dissolve upwards one into another, until the third syllable forces the top of the central channel to open at the crown of the head. Then the syllables descend back into the channel again. By training in this exercise repeatedly, the yogi prepares himself to open up the crown-cakra at the time of death. When dying, he uses the same visualization and with the help of an additional syllable he then ejects his consciousness into the heart of his chosen deity, which he has visualized in the space in front of him. Having presenting these three types of Transference, the segment further explains the practice called \"Forceful Transference\" (btsan thabs kyi 'pho ba), which is also described in segment DK.A.Pa.12. Although not stated explicitly, the practice appears to be a technique to be used for dying persons, who are spiritually untrained or unable to perform any other liberation technique by him-or herself. The present technique differs in minor details from the bstan thabs 'pho ba found in segment DK.A.Pa.12, but its overall principles are the same. Next, the segment in structs in a method for breathing control (rlung sbyang ba'i thabs). The meditator must train for some weeks in bec oming able to hold the breath for an extended period. This ability is then checked by an assistant who will count his own normal breaths while the practitioner holds his breath. The practitioner should be able to hold his breath for at least 36 breaths by the assistant. Having accomplished this, the practitioner may take up the practice of Transference. Here, he is instructed to visualize syllables that block every bodily orifice. Using a mantric syllable, the yogi then ejects his consciousness in the form of a syllable up through the crown of his skull. The segment mentions various signs of accomplishment and says that this practice should be done regularly for up to twenty years. It also quotes a few passages from the Caturp�thatantra, mentioning this Tantra as being the scriptural foundation for the practice. Based on one of these quotations, the author then presents the manner in which the practice should be performed at the time of death. The explanation is supported by more quotations from the Tantra and its explanatory Tantra (bshad rgyud, *vyiikhyiitantra).

The yogi falls asleep while focusing on the letter hii171 in his heart-cakra and thereby enters a lucid state of sleep free of dreams. If he begins to dream, he must evaluate the practice after waking, form a new intention, and then try again.

Thereupon, the segment quotes Abhidharmakofa verses III. 14-15 with some added interlinear exegetical notes regarding the same topic. The segment ends with the sentence (quoted in Tibetan above): \"As was spoken by Acarya Vasubandhu. \"952 The placement of this scriptural addendum on the interim in the text is s omewhat curious, since it is placed in between two segments dealing respectively with the Radiance of Sleep practice (DK.A.Tsha.5) and the Illusory Body practice (DK.A.Tsha.7). A more logical placement would have been right after segment DK.A.Tsha.3, which pertains to the interim and how the yogf should attempt to block the door to the womb of reincarna­tion by not engaging emotionally in the said sexual vision of his future parents.

After waking up, the yogf should first contemplate how his own self and everything else is hallucinatory and dream-like. This step of the practice will produce knowledge (ye shes, *'jfiiina). In the post-meditative phase after waking up (gnyid sad nas rjes thob), the practitioner should then perform the practice of gazing into a mirror and alternately praising and offending himself as summarized above (see DK.A.Pa.10 and DK.A.Ba.6).

Besides a couple of alterna­tive visualizations, eating less, and wearing thinner clothes (presumably to produce lighter sleep), the advice also includes going to a deserted place and run around there completely naked while yelling wildly \"this is a dream, this is a dream\" at the top of one's lungs. Thereupon, the practitioner is to go and sit in a scary place at the top of a deep abyss. When going to sleep at night back home, it is assured that he will produce sufficiently wild dreams, which he ought with relative ease to be able to recognize lucidly as dreams. Once the yogzhas become able to recognize his dreams and has begun manipulating and augmenting them to familiarize himself with their fundamental unreal quality, the second problem may arise that the yogi's experience of bliss in the dream is not sufficiently connected with emptiness. As a consequence, he may become attached to this blissful feeling, which in turn may give rise to other afflictive emotions, thereby turning the whole 954 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.

For this, a technique is advised that the practitioner should press hard at his heart-cakra with the fists of both hands and let his eyes roll upwards, while relaxing the mind. It is said that this technique physically induces an intense sense of bliss­emptiness. At this stage, it is said that the yogfwill understand all phenomena to be mind, illusory, and dream-like. Yet, he may fear that he might still be reborn in SaJ?1Siira and feel anxious that he has not yet reached liberation. To overcome this problem, he needs to mix his experience with daily life experiences (spyod lam dang bsre ba) until he no longer feels any difference between meditation and the ensuing experience of daily life. Even when such a meditative concentration has become stable, it is still possible that the interim will appear to him after he has passed away. To counter this problem, the yogi is advised to form a firm intention to train in the practice of Dream. By then becoming fully able to control his dreams and overcoming any separati on between the meditation of the Dream state and the post-meditation of the wakened state, he plants the seed for recogni­zing the Illusory Body in the interim for what it really is and thus becomes able to accomplish the buddha-bodies right then and there. Here the segment adds that in Nagarju­na's praise to the Illusory Body (slob dpon klu sgrub kyis sgyu lus la bstod pa), the good qualities of this body are presented. It is then added that the present segment has offered a key-point of combining the instructions on Dream and Illusory Body.

Dags po'i bka' 'bum: Mahiimudra Meditation Manuals (Phyag chen gyi khridyig) The fifth overall section of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum contains nine texts dealing primarily with Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra doctrine. So far, these texts have remained relatively little studied in modem scholarship. There are only two academic studies that have drawn attention to these works, namely a very brief review by David P. JACKSON (1994:81-82) who gave a short summary of text DK.A.Wa and Gyaltrul Rinpoche Trungram SHERPA (2004), whose doctoral dissertation included a critical Tibetan edition and an annotated English translation of text DK.A.La. 5.19 DK.A.Dza: Sayings of the Master, the Doctor from Dags po: The Extraordinary Ambrosia of Speech (Rje dags po lha rj e 'i gsung/ zhal gyi bdud rtsi thun mongs ma yin pa bzhugso) 20 folios, 16 segments, 2 internal colophons. The first Mahamudra instruction manual contains a full introduction to Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra doctrine, here referred to by the term \"the yoga of the co-emergent\" (lhan cig skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga). It stresses the importance of the basic motivational teachings taught in the Common Mahayana, such as cultivating an understanding of impermanence, karman, suffering, compassion, and bodhicitta. It also emphasizes the importance of relying on a teacher (bla ma). Several sections give very concise instruction on Mahamudra meditation and many of the issues that later were criticized by others in Bsod nams rin chen's doctrine are actually explained here. It is, for example, stated that only practitioners of lesser capacity need to approach Mahamudra by relying on the Tantric sexual practices (las rgya, *kannamudra), wherein the female partner must be seen as a symbol for highest wisdom. Practitioners of highest capacity can in stead approach Mahamudra directly without relying on such Tantric tech­mques. Much reference is here also given to Common Mahayana teachings, where it is ex­plained how the bodhicitta practice of Mind Training (blo sbyong) can lead into Maha­mudra meditation. The text also makes comparisons between the Tantric teachings of Mi la ras pa and the Common Mahayana teachings of the Bka' gdams pa tradition. The distinc­tion between a gradual approach (rim gyis pa) and an instant approach (cig char ba) is alsomentioned several times.

Thereafter, the student must be guided by an authentic teacher (bla ma dam pa cig). The training of the student begins by cultivating kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta). For the student to achieve realization, it is necessary that the teacher possesses realiza­tion; if not, this is compared to the impossibility of making a clay imprint (tsha tsha) of a religious image by using a stamp with no drawing on it. Once the student has chosen a teacher, he must develop trust (yid ches pa, *sm71pratyaya) in all the masters (jo bo kun). Then he should don the \"two armors\" (go cha gnyis, *dvayasm7miiha). The first is the armor of the view (!ta ba'i go cha) consisting of abandoning outer negative actions and fostering positive inner qualities. The second is the armor of insight (shes rab kyi go cha), which means bodily not to shy away from illnesses and mentally not shy away from thoughts. When practicing meditation, the practitioner should first look at the nature of the mind and say to himself three times that the mind is unborn (skye ba med pa, *anutpanna), unceasing ('gag pa med pa, *aniruddha), and essenceless (dngos po med pa, *abhiiva). Thereafter, he reflects intellectually on these pronouncements, giving rise to an understand­ing that sm7isiira is mere thought (rtog pa, *vikalpa), thought is mind (sems, *citta), and the mind is unborn and dhannakiiya. Having neither fear of sm7isiira nor hope for nirvii�ia, he should see that thought is needed for reaching realization of dharmakiiya, since it is the method that must initially be employed. Keeping this in mind, he then rests undistractedly in a state of experiencing the mind as dharmakiiya. Whenever thoughts arise, he sees them as mental events (sems byung, *caitta) and lets them dissolve back into the mind. This is called \"carrying [thoughts] into the yoga of the co-emergent\" (lhan cig skyes sbyor du 'khyer ba). In the vocabulary of Mahiimudrii, one's own co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *cittatii), which co-arises (lhan cig skyes pa) as one part of the pair, is dhannakiiya (rang gi sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa chos sku), while the co-emergent experiences are the light of dharmakiiya (snang ba lhan cig skyes pa chos sku'i 'od).957 These two aspects are inseparable in the same manner as the sun and sunlight, or sandal­wood and its fragrance. The segment provides some remarks on the meditative experience of this meditative state and its realization. mdzod vol. Ka (TBRC W23447- 1894) pp. 815-885. From text DK.A.Dza onwards, the DK.P publications contains no further texts from the corpus. 957 The expression 'co-emergent' is an attempt to try to capture a nuance of the Tibetan and Sanskrit expressions lhan cig skyes pa (*sahaja), literally meaning \"arisen (skyes pa, *-ja) in a pair (lhan cig, *saha-). The pair in question consists of the mind as such (sems ny id, *cittata) and 'experi­ences' or 'perceptions' (snang ba, *avabhasa).

The segment comments that the action seal (*kannamudra), i.e., the Tantri c sexual practice, is only employed in meditation by inferior practitioners who are desirous. The observance seal (*samayamudra), i.e., the visualization of a being a Tantric deity in sexual union, is practiced as a meditation involving form (mtshan bcas bsgom pa) by middling practitioners who are without desire. Following either of these preliminary stages, such practitioners can then progress to the nature seal (*dharmamudra), where they in a formless meditation directly recognize thoughts as being dhannakaya. Yet, the highest practitioners are able to recognize the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittata) , which is the great seal (*mahiimudra), to be unfabricated in nature (ma bcos pa'i ngo bo), and relying on this alone they reach complete realization. The segment's explanation of Mahiimudrii within the Tantric framework of the four mudriis is then followed by an explanation on the mind's nature (rang bzhin ), appearance (ngo bo ), and character (mtshan nyid), along with a detailed explanation on how these facets may be applied in the meditation practice. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.Dza.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Dza.2.4a2): /Ina mo gu ru/ rang rig pa'i ngo bo de ci yang ma yin pa la/. It ends (DK.A.Dza.2.4b5): bdag gis bsod nams las shes bya/ ces gsungs so//.959 The second segment str esses how the yogi should focus on the mind without striving for anything else. It starts by saying that the essence of self-aware­ness (rang rig pa'i ngo bo) is not anything at all and to realize this is buddhahood. The yogi should not strive for higher meditative abs orptions (skye mched mu bzhi rtog med kyi ting nge 'dzin), but should \"settle for the natural mind\" (tha mal gyi shes pa dga). Moreover, visions and visualizations are merely the mind's own projections (sems kyi rnam 'phrul), and the yo gl should therefore settle for the natural mind. Dialecticians (mtshan nyid pa) and the Bka' gdams pas argue that object and subject cannot be established with any underlying basis (gzhi rtsa ma grub pa). However, whatever appears is naturally pure and empty of conceptuality. Hence, instead of striving for the intellect, the yogi should settle for the natural mind. The meditator should also not hope for supersensory perceptions, because these only pertain to this life and are anyway common to both gods and ghosts. Rather, the yogi should settle for the natural mind. The segment ends by saying that the natural mind (tha mal gyi shes pa) was taught in the following verse in the Hevajratantra: \"The co-emergent (sahaja, lhan cig skyes) can be told by no other, and nowhere can it be found. It is known by oneself as a result of the beneficence [produced] by 958 Possibly, the reference to Nagarjuna denotes the Caturmudranifraya (phyag rgya bzhi gtan la dbab pa, Q3069/D2225) by Nagarjunagarbha. 959 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.21 5ar215b6, DK.B.Dza.2.4ar4bs, DK.D.Dza.2.4a3-5ai, DK.Q.Dza.2.31 Oa6-3 l la2, DK.R.Dza.2.5b4-7a2, DK.S.Dza.2.6a1-7a5, DK.T.Dza.2.4n-5n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Segment DKA.Dza.3: The segment begins (DK.A.Dza.3.4bs): !!bdag gis bla ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes nil. It ends (DK.A.Dza.3.5b4): snang grags thams cad dang bra! ba'i nyams dang mi 'bra! bar bya gsung ngo//.961 The third segment opens with a saying that is attributed to \"my precious teacher\" (bdag gi bla ma rin po che). The saying states that co-emergent knowledge (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes, *sahajajfiiina) is simply this present natural mind which has existed forever (da ltar gyi tha ma! gyi shes pa ye nas yod pa 'di nyid). Commenting on this saying, the segment then explains that the method for realizing this is to rely on an authentic teacher and to rest in the natural mind (tha mal gyi shes pa, *priikrtajfiana) while remaining uncontrived (mo bcos par), unadulterated (ma bslad par), and natural (rang sor rang dgar). This leads to a realization (rtogs pa) of the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittatii) being unborn, unceasing, non-abiding, and essenceless, and this is the view (!ta ba, *darfona). To rest in this undistractedly is the meditation (sgom pa, *bha­vana), and to engage in activities while seeing this unborn mind as such and all sensory perceptions as inseparable, like water and waves, is the conduct (spyod pa, *ciirya). The segment then presents a distinction between attention (yid la byed pa, *manasikiira) to abstract objects (don spyi) and attention to concrete objects (don dngos) . The first type of attention is explained through reference to the teachings of the Miidhyamikas (dbu ma pa) and the Piiramitii followers (pha rol tu phyin pa) presenting the twofold truth (bden pa gnyis, *dvayasatya), i.e., the relative and the absolute levels of reality . The second type of attention is said to refer to the Guhyamiintrikas (gsang sngags pa), who consider awareness (rig pa, *vidyii or *smJivid) to be knowledge of reality (de kho na nyid kyi ye shes, *tattva­jfiiina). The Guhyamantra approach is then briefly laid out in terms of its view (!ta ba), meditative experience (nyams myong), meditation (sgom pa), conduct (spyod pa), and result ('bras bu). The explanation on meditative experiences includes two analogies comparing the meditative approach to how a skillful person herds oxen and how a forest fire spreads. 960 The English translation given here is loosely based on SNELLGROVE's translation (1959.1:76) with some changes. The Hevajratantra I.viii.36 (SNELLGROVE, 1959.II:28-29): niinyena kathyate sahajam na kasminn api labhyate// iitmanii jiiiiyate pllnyiid guruparvopasevayii!/.

It ends (DK.A.Dza.4.6a1): /mnyam gzhag chen po'i rnal 'byor ni rgyun chad med pa yin gsung ngo//.962 The fourth segment provides a short lay out of the entire path. It begins by mentioning the trainings in higher discipline (!hag pa tshul khrims kyi bslab pa) and higher contemplation (lhag pa sems kyi bslab pa), which are said to lead to higher reincarnations within sm71siira. Then it mentions the practice-mode of the followers of the Guhyamantra approach of the Mahiiyiina (theg pa chen po gsang sngags pa), where the three buddha-bodies (sku gsum) are utilized as the path in the present state. It is briefly pointed out how such a practice relates to the dharma­kiiya, the sambhogakiiya, and the nirmii�wkiiya. Finally, the segment outlines four stages of accomplishment that are elsewhere referred to as the \"four yogas\" (rnal 'byor bzhi). These stages are usually associated with Mahiimudrii practice, although the word Mahiimudrii does not occur in the present passage. The four stages are here called \"cultivating one-pointedness\" (rtse gcig gi bsgom pa), \"cultivating freedom from conceptual entanglement\" (spros bral gyi bsgom pa), \"cultiva­ting one taste of the manifold\" (du ma ro gcig gi bsgom pa), and \"the yoga of great absorption\" (mnyam gzhag chen po'i rnal 'byor). It is not clear whether the way in which the segment segues from Guhyamantra practice directly to the four yogas is meant to imply a pragmatic progression moving from deity yoga directly into the stages of Mahiimudrii accomplishment without ever entering any form of non-Tantric Mahiimudrii practice, or whether it is meant to imply a progression from deity yoga to a non-Tantric form of Mahiimudra practice.

Then it mentions the need for cultivating kindness and compas­sion as the motivation, whereby all wholesome activities are done in order to bring benefit to other beings, who are to be seen as the practitioner's mothers in his past lives. Someone who has trained the mind in this way (de !tar bur blo sbyong ba cig) should then meditate on the nature of his mind as being radiance ('ad gsal ba, *prabhiisvara). By analyzing and observing that the mind is not anything at all, a feeling of lucid clarity and presence (gsal sing nge ba), complete freshness (dwangs sing nge ba), and utter happiness (bde phril le ba)arises.

Thereby, the yo gf becomes free from any hope for or attachment to the meditative experiences (nyams). At this stage, any thought that arises will not proceed on its own but will emerge within a non-duality of perceiver and perceived. Sm!isiira is understood as being the mind's self­delusion (rang 'khrul pa) and as a mere self-experience (rang snang) within the mind. Likewise, nirvii!W is seen as the mind's own purification, where the form-bodies (gzugs sku, *rupakaya) appear for the benefit of others (gzhan snang) while ultimate reality remains utterly free from concept (rtog bral 'ba' zhig). This development depends on achieving a decisive way of looking at the mind free from any attachment. SaYfisiira should not be observed with one's physical eyes (phyi mig) but must be pierced (gzong plwgs byed). This is compared to a saying that is here quoted from the teacher referred to as \"the Anchorite\" (Dge bshes Dgon pa ba), presumably referring to the Bka' gdams pa master Dgon pa ba Dbang phyug rgyal mtshan (1016-1082), who was the teacher of Bsod nams rin chen's meditation teacher Rgya Yon bdag. At this point, the segment changes its character from a narration attributed to the mouth of the teacher (rin po che'i zhal nas), to a dialogue form. The structure is that of Question and Answer text (z/rns lan), where an interlocutor raises two questions each followed by an answer. The first question is whether it is a supportive condition (grogs) or an obstacle (gegs) when the essence abruptly becomes interrupted by slumber in the meditation (ngo bo rbad kyis chod pa cig la gnyid). The second question regards the difference between union (zung 'jug) and being incisive (gcig chod). The segment has no colophon.

This is a teaching through which the individual character (rang gi mt shan nyid, *svalak�a!ia) is revealed by itself. Following this saying, the segment continues by comparing this to various other ap­proaches. One inferior approach is that of the dialecticians, who refute all extreme positions and debate emptiness. Another is the meditative approach of those who attempt to achieve a non-conceptual state by blocking out all thoughts. Some cultivate limited methods (thabs nyi tshe) and as a result have meditative experiences of bliss, clarity, and non-thought. These three experiences are briefly explained. It is stated that such experiences should not be considered superior, because if the practitioner grows attached to them, they will become obstacles. 964 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.218b1-220a2, DK.B.Dza.6.7ar8a6, DK.D.Dza.6.7a6-8b4, DK.Q.Dza.6.314�-315b1 (the folio numbers 313 and 314 are in the print given to a single folio to correct a pagination error), DK.R.Dza.6.10bs-l 3a3, DK.S.Dza.6.11 a5-13b5, DK.T.Dza.6.7n-8b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

Thoughts should be regarded with gratitude as being highly useful. The root of all thoughts (rtog pa'i rtsa ba) is the mind, and thoughts are therefore thoughts belonging to the essence of the mind (ngo bo nyid kyi rtog pa). The bla ma is here quoted as saying that non-thought (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa) is dharmakiiya. Having explained in a few more details how to view thoughts, the segment turns to explain the importance of developing inner certainty (nang du nges pa'i shes pa). With such certainty, the meditator is able to rest non-artificially in reality (de nyid, *tattva). The bla ma is again quoted as having said, \"I have knowledge of nothing [remaining] to be cultivated (mi bsgom pa).\" It is stated that it is necessary to understand that all the Buddhist teachings of the canon (sde snod, *pifaka) converge on the mind (sems thog tu 'bebs). Knowing this, the four yogas of one-pointedness and so forth emerge as one, all phenomena are discerned as awareness (rig pa, *vidyii or *samvit). Whether the practitioner meditates on Cittamiitra, Madhyamaka, or Prajiiiipiiramitii, he will arrive at the essence (ngo bo, *svabhiiva). This is even the case if he follows the inferior path of the friivakas or a non-Buddhist approach. However, without such certainty (ma nges na), no approach will ever yield any real result. A quotation from Tilopa is then given, wherein he states that he only teaches the co­emergent radiance of self-awareness (rang gi rig pa lhan cig skyes pa'i 'od gsal gcig pu). In that case -the segment says -the practitioner must cut the bond to this life and practice as much as possible with only this in his heart. The practitioner, who only goes to radiance ('od gsal 'ba' zhig la 'gro ba), will not experience the interim when he dies. A quotation from Ela ma Mi la is given to this effect. This is followed by further quotations from the Ela ma and from Bsod nams rin chen's Eka' gdams pa teachers Lcags ri ba and Bya yul ba. A question is then raised as to what difference there is between these three statements, and it is said that there is none. A saying by the precious master (rje rin po che) concerning the stages of the path starting with engendering the resolve for Awakening an d ending with the ultimate, co-emergent original nature (don dam lhan cig skyes pa'i gnyug ma) is given to indicate the interconnectedness of the Eka' gdams gradual teachings and Mahiimudrii practice on the original nature.

Knowing all phenomena to be illusory and dream-like, he should overcome all attachment to this life. At this point in the segment, a religious poem of 25 verses written in meter is cited, probably stemming from another source. It is introduced with the phrase \"thus\" (de ltar), though the source of the poem is not specified. The poem emphasizes the need to rely on a teacher and speaks of how, based on his blessing, to enter meditation directly on the nature of the mind. After describing how such practice culminates in achieving buddhahood, the poem turns with the exclamation e ma ho to describe a Tantric practice that consists in mastering the winds and channels and the associated meditative experiences that lead to the realization of dharmakiiya.

Describing the progress of an ordinary practitioner, it says that at the outset such a practitioner has little commotion in his mind. As he achieves the stage of \"one-pointedness\" (rtse gcig, *ekiigratii), the meditation gives rise to an experi­ence of lucid clarity (sing nge ye re ba) of heightened awareness. This produces an inner sense of conviction that will guide him, although he is still prone to doubts and his meditative experience remains unstable. As he learns to recognize the mind, which is the root [of all experience], he familiarizes himself with resting in a non-artificial state (ma bcos par), which gives rise to the yoga stage called \"freedom from conceptual entangle­ment\" (spros bral, *ni�prapafica). His good and bad meditative experiences are still on and off, yet he begins to assimilate a continuous experience of subtle and profound realization. Since he feels certainty, he no longer suffers from doubt and anxiety . Guarding his meditative experience of the natural state (rnal ma), his meditative concentration grows spontaneous and he thereby begins to have an experience of having inner 'clarity' or 'pre­sence' (gsal) yet remaining non-attached and without clinging. This in itself is the experi­ence of \"one taste\" (ro gcig, *ekarasa). As he realizes outer objects as non-duality and his own mind innately as dharmakiiya, he reaches the final stage called \"nothing to be cultivated\" (bsgom du med pa, *bhiivaniibhiiva). 966 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.221 bs-222a5, DK.B.Dza.8.9br1 0a1, DK.D.Dza.8.10a6-10b6, DK.Q.Dza.8.317a1-317b1, DK.R.Dza.8.16a1-l6bs, DK.S.Dza.8.16b4-l 7h DK.T.Dza.8.10n-10b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

For such a person, the level of \"freedom from conceptual entangle­ment\" appears as soon as the teacher points out the nature of the mind for the first time. For the gradual practitioner (rim gyis pa), this stage only emerges through repeated practice and accustomization (goms pa). In any case -the segment states -all practitioners require diligence. A short quotation in three lines is given to stress the need for faith and persever­ance. The segment ends with a brief colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"This [text] called The Purification of the Defilements of Habitual Tendencies, made by the Precious One in the Byar mo sbas ston cave, is finished.\" The colophon thus states that the present teaching was given by \"the Precious One\" (rin po che), perhaps referring to Bsod nams rin chen. The place name of the cave remains unidentified. The first syllable, byar, in the Tibetan name Byar mo, may be an abbreviation of bya ra, meaning \"watch, guard,\" combined with a feminine nominalizer mo suffix, whereby the name of the cave would mean \"the cave (phug) of teaching (ston) the hidden (sbas) to the watch-woman (byar mo).\" Alternatively, byar mo could be a misspelling of dbyar mo, being an archaic word for a fully ordained nun, in which case the name might mean \"the cave of teaching the hidden to the nuns.\" In the older ms DK.a, the syllable sbas \"hidden\" is spelled sba \"genitals\", in which case the phrase \"teaching the hidden\" would have to be interpreted as \"showing the genitals\" (sba ston), thereby giving the quaint title quite a different connotation.

First, it is said that the teacher must possess six qualifications: undamaged observances (dam tshig), learning (thos pa, literally \"having heard [the doctrine]\"), a resolve to benefit [others] (phan sems), realization (rtogs pa), and patience (bzod pa). To this is added that he must possess transmission (brgyud pa), and that this transmission should pervade his manner of teaching in four ways. A slightly extended expl anation of how the teacher should be patient follows. Next, the question is raised how a student (slob ma) should rely on (bsten) such a teacher, which is explained in three points. He must practice in the manner demonstrated by the teacher, think dearly of the teacher, listen to what the teacher says and only tell the truth. Thereupon, it is explained how the teacher teaches with blessing (byin rlabs, *adhi­�,thana). A longer explanation of blessing follows, where the word mainly seems to refer to how the teacher instructs the student and introduces different points of realization concerning the nature of the mind. As long as the student has not been able to reach an experience of non-duality, it is said that he must rely on gathering the requisites.

Finally, a few remarks are made with regard to the result of realizing dhannakaya. At the end of this explanation, it is stated that this is the instruction of Bia ma Mi la (bla ma mi la'i gdam ngag). To this are appended two further explanations on the qualifications of the teacher. The first subsidiary explanation lists four qualifications needed in the teacher, namely faith, compassion, certainty , and that he teaches the Dharma to beings without demand for material wealth (zang zing). The second subsidiary explanation is attributed to the \"tradition of the Bka' gdams pa teachers\" (bka' gdams pa'i dge bshes rnams kyi lugs), according to which a spiritual friend (dge ba'i bshes gnyen, *kalyii'.lamitra), i.e., a teacher, is someone who is capable of inspiring others to abandon negative actions and foster kindness, compas­sion, and the resolve for Awakening due to having done so himself. Overall, the segment is interspersed with many interlinear notes (mchan bu) in smaller script, probably added by a later hand, especially in its first part explaining the qualifications of the teacher as well as its middle part explaining blessing.

Thereupon, the practitioner must be taught the Buddhist path in its entirety. A question to the Bka' gdams pa teacher Lcags ri ba along with his answer(s) is then presented. Since Lcags ri ba was one of Bsod nams rin chen's teachers, it is possible that the passage is meant to depict a convers ation between Bsod nams rin chen and this master. Lcags ri ba is asked whether an actual experience of emptiness will emerge if the practitioner possesses these three qualities (chos gsum po), i.e., kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awake­ning, which he in a slightly elaborate answer confirms to be the case. To teach a student of the highest capacity (dbang po rab ), it is then said to be necessary to impart (1) an instruction that is deep like an ocean (rgya mtsho ltar zab pa'i man ngag), (2) an instruction that is able to turn anywhere like a chariot (shing rta ltar gar yang bsgyur du btub pa'i man ngag), (3) an instruction that is wide and vast like the sky (nam mkha' ltar yangs shing rgya che ba'i man ngag), (4) an instruction that can fulfill all desired objectives like a [wish-fulfilling] gem (rin po che !tar 'dad pa'i don grub pa'i man ngag), and (5) an instruction that is sharp and can cut like a sword (ral gri ltar mo shing gcod pa'i man ngag). 968 Correlated passages: DK. a.Kha.223b3-224b 1, DK.B .Dza. l 0.1 1brl2b3, D K.D .Dza.10. l 2a6-l 3a4, DK.Q.Dza.10.318bs-319bi, DK.R.Dza.10. l 9a6-20b4, DK.S.Dza. 10.20a5-2lb4, DK.T.Dza.10.12n-1 3n, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

The remainder of the segment is devoted to outlining each of these instructions in brief. The first entails a differentiation between the instant (cig char ba) and the gradual (rim gyis pa) approaches. The second consists in teaching the inseparability of experience (snang ba) and the mind (sems) through various examples. The third is an instruction for realizing Mahiimudra from among the four mudriis. The fourth, which is described in verse-form, concerns the Generation and Completion stages of Tantric practice. These are here explained in the form of a triad pertaining to 'going' ('gro ba), another triad consisting of the teacher, empowerment, and blessing, a third triad consisting of meditation, experience, and realization, along with an explanation of the mind, which is nothing at all but which experiences a variety of manifold manifestations that too are without essence. The fifth instruction is said to impart a decisive (gcig chod) teaching where the nature of the mind is taught to be unborn and unceasing. This is outlined with reference to realization, meditation,and conduct. The segment concludes by stating that for all these instructions, compassion is of the essence and the practitioner should therefore never part from this attitude. The segment has no colophon.

The opening question is as follows: \"As for the view, meditation, and conduct, it has been explained in the Tantras of the Mahayana Guhyamantra that one [can] achieve the accomplishment of Mahamudra in a single body in a single life-time -is that true?\" Various answers to this question are then quoted from different teachers of Bsod nams rin chen. The first answer stems from Bla ma Mar yul ba [Blo ldan shes rab], who affirms this statement but adds that there is also a possibility of achieving this accomplishment within seven rebirth s and that there are other accomplishments, such as beholding the face of the chosen deity and the ability to extract medicinal vitality (sman bcud Zen, *rasayana) [as a longevity practice]. This is followed by an answer given by Bla ma Mi la, who too affirms the statement and comments that it requires the meeting of a genuine teacher with a genuine student as well as practice with fervent diligence. An interlinear note, possibly added by a later hand, adjoins a small comment that only the students of the highest capacity can achieve buddhahood in the present life; others can only do so in the interim or in a future life. Lcags ri ba is then requested to tell how Atifa (Jo bo) explained [this point]. He replies that Atifa here is in accord with the venerable one (rje btsun). From the preceding context, it seems that the \"venerable one\" must here refer to Bla ma Mi la.

Each of these is explained in brief. The result is said to be buddhahood achieved in a single life-time provi­ded that the practitioner is a great meditator who possesses three qualities (c/zos gswn), namely realization free from anxiety (nyam nga med pa'i rtogs pa), meditation without partiality (phyogs cha med pa 'i bsgom pa), and conduct beyond the conceptual mind (blo dang bra[ ba'i spyod pa). Next, Dge bshes Bya yul ba is asked about what is reached by a practice that is not joined with an understanding of the hallucinatory nature of all things. Bya yul ba replies that such practice would produce a mistaken cognition (log shes, *mithyiijifiina) and goes on to present four points on which the practitioner should always focus (rtag tu yid la bya ba 'i chos bzhi). These include always concentrating on the teacher in order to give rise to blessing, always realizing all phenomena to be dhannakiiya in order to reach a non­conceptual meditation, always regarding the mind (sems) as the being the bla ma in order to abandon harmful actions towards all sentient beings possessing a mind (sems can), and alway s regarding oneself and all sentient beings as having the same nature of the mind as such (sems nyid ngo bo gcig tu byas).

It starts with an inquiry into the causality of buddhahood. The question is raised what causes lead to manifesting the two form-kiiyas (gzugs sku, *nipakiiya) when the yogi realizes the mind as such and accomplishes dhannakiiya. It is explained that the form­kiiyas are the result of beneficence and wishing-prayers accumulated while practicing the path. A brief explanation on the nature of these kiiyas follows written in the form of a dialectical argument with objections and consequences (thal ba, *prasmiga) raised at various junctures. First the argument concerns whether the form-kiiyas require any outside influence, such as the blessing of a buddha, or whether they purely are perceptions appearing in the minds of sentient beings (sems can gyi snang ba). Thereafter, it turns to debating whether the form-kiiyas pertain to nirvii!1a or sm71siira, whether they are ultimate (don dam, *paramiirtha) or relative (kun rdzab, *sm71vrti), and why they are called 'bodies' or 'states' (sku, *kiiya).

Discussing the ability belonging to bodhisattvas on the higher bodhisattva levels (sa, *bhiimi) to create multiple simultaneous bodily manifestations, the segment enters an explanation of the nature of a buddha's abilities (nus pa, *fokti). This, in tum, leads to a presentation of a buddha's non-conceptuality, while he at the same time is able to display such powers. This includes an explanation of the expressions \"birthless knowledge\" (skye ba med pa'i rig pa), \"unceasing path\" ('gag pa med pa'i lam), \"non-abiding insight\" (gnas pa med pa 'i shes rab ), and \"non-attained result\" (thob pa med pa 'i 'bras bu). The result is explained in terms of receiving Tantric empowerment (dbang, *abhi�eka). A presentation is given of the four kinds of bliss (dga' ba, *iinanda) associated with the bodily arousal that is felt during the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo) as well as during Tan­tric intercourse.

These are explained in terms of how they are experienced in meditation. More specifically, it is said that the practitioner must cultivate the essence in meditation, which is followed up by a concrete instruction on how to sit in meditation and observe the mind. Sitting in the meditation posture and having engendered a resolved to cultivate Mahiimudra for the benefit of all sentient beings, the meditator should begin by thinking that all phenomena that appear (snang srid kyi chos thams cad) are his own mind (rang gi sems). He must then ascertain that this mind is birthless (skye ba med pa, *anutpanna), and without passing judgment (rtsis gdab med pa) he should rest quietly (lhan gyis) in its natural state (rang gi ngang). He should simply abide in its qualities of being pristine (so ma), uncontrived (ma bcos pa), and at ease (lhug pa) quality. The term so ma is here defined through an interlinear gloss (mchan bu). Without focusing on anything in particular, he should meditate with ease and deep relaxation in its quality of crystal-clear awareness (sal le sing nge ba). A saying is then quoted stating, \"The most relaxed (glod pa rab), the best meditation (sgom pa rab); a middling relaxation, a middling meditation; the least relaxed, the least meditation.\" In terms of how to deal with thoughts that arise during this practice, the meditator is instructed to think of them like clouds that appear out of space itself and disappear· back into space, all the while remaining in the nature of space. Likewise, thoughts arise out of the co-emergent mind as such, remain therein, and in the end dissolve back into the co­emergent mind as such, without ever going beyond the nature of the co-emergent mind as such. By meditating in this manner, the experiences of the four yogas (rnal 'byor rnam pa bzhi) will gradually emerge. The segment then presents each of these yogas in some detail. This presentation includes describing each yoga in terms of its phases (dus) and how the mind's three characters of essence, nature, and characteristic are realized in turn on the different levels. Next, it is said that although the yogi thus realizes dharmakaya in the course of these four yogas, he will still experience the illness and suffering associated with having a physical body. This is explained through an analogy of the yet unborn offspring of lions and of the mythical garutf,a bird. Even if the embryos of these creatures are naturally powerful animals, they remain limited by being enveloped by the womb or the egg. Likewise, although dhannakaya has been realized within, it is still enclosed in the physical body that was produced due to past actions (las, *karman). Hence, there is no contradiction in the fact that comfort, discomfort, and undesirable conditions are felt as one as one lives. Turning to the issue of how the yogi who has practiced Mahamudra will experience death, it is said that due to the training of his former practice, he will automatically recognize the knowledge of the co-emergent dharmakiiya as it naturally appears at the end of the death process when the bodily elements have fully dissolved.

It is said that this is why it is so important to meditate on Mahiimudrii now. As long as Mahiimudrii has not been realized, the meditator should simply try to rest in a natural state during meditation and should concentrate on accumulating beneficence when not meditating in order to create the inner conditions needed for enhancing the meditation experience. Such an approach is sure quickly to lead to realization.

It ends (DK.A.Dza.14.18b2): !hug pa brten pas spyod lam rnam bzhi la khyad par med pa'i khyad par ro//.974 The fourteenth segment is a short list of three times three elements of Mahamudrii practice (phyag rgya chen po'i lam nyams su Zen pa). The first set of three is called \"three methods for the nature or for resting [therein]\" (ngo bo'am bzhag thabs gsum), consisting of \"resting pristinely\" (so mar bzhag), \"resting by and of itself\" (rang gar bzhag), and \"resting with ease\" (!hug par bzhag).975 These three are defined through interspersed interlinear notes. The second threefold set is \"three aids that stabilize these\" (de brtan par byed pa'i grogs gsum), viz. \"being effortless\" ('bad rtsol med pa), \"not resting on any basis whatsoever\" (rten gang la yang mi gnas pa), and \"not holding on to meditative experience as experi­ence\" (nyams su myong ba la myong bar mi 'dzin pa). These three stabilize respectively the first set of three. The third set is \"their three forms of illustriousness\" (de'i khyad par gsum), namely \"the illustriousness of cause and fruition occurring at the same time\" (rgyu 'bras dus mtshungs pa'i khyad par), \"the illustriousness of distinctions becoming liberated in and of them­selves\" (mtshan ma rang sar grol ba'i khyad par), and \"the illustriousness of being without distinctions in the four daily activities\" (spyod lam rnam bzhi la khyad par med pa 'i khyad par). These three are the outcome of having respectively stabilized the first set of three by means of the second set of three. The segment has no colophon.

It presents \"three times in Mahamudrii\" (phyag rgya chen po la dus gsum) called \"the time of spontaneous accomp­lishment\" (lhun gyis grub pa'i dus), \"the time of the inconceivable\" (bsam gyis mi khyab pa'i dus), and \"the time of great bliss\" (bde ba chen po'i du s). The latter corresponds to the achievement of dhannakiiya. This is followed by a short outline of view, meditation, conduct, and fruition, as well as view, realization, and great meditation. Next, it speaks of \"the search for the lost radiance\" ('od gsal star ba btsal ba), \"the cause for the emergence of radiance\" (od gsal skye ba'i rgyu), and \"the cause for increasing [radiance]\" ('phel ba'i rgyu). These explanations mention the need for receiving the teacher's supervision or blessing, making prayers, accumulating beneficence, engendering devotion, practicing Inner Heat, perservering in solitude, etc. An instruction, which in an interlinear note is attributed to Bla ma Mi la, emphasizes the need for combining Generation Stage practices with the cultivation of kindness, compas­sion, and the resolve for Awakening. A saying by the Bka gdams pa teacher Spyan snga ba [Tshul khrims 'bar] (1038-1103) is then quoted, wherein he underlines the need for strengthening meditation practice by making offerings and praying to the Three Jewels. The segment then turns to discuss how the practice of meditative Tranquility (zhi gnas, *famatha) may become a cause for further rebirth in sa11isiira if the meditator grows attached to various aspects of such meditation. Thus, clinging to the bliss (bde ba) experienced in a famatha practice that is one-pointed (rtse gcig pa, *ekiigrata) may lead to rebirth in the Desire Realm ('dad khams, *kiimadhiitu). Attachment to its presence or clarity (gsal ba) may lead to rebirth in the Material Realm (gzugs khams, *rupadhiitu). Clinging to non-thought (mi rtog pa) may lead to rebirth in the Immaterial Realm (gzugs med khams, *iirupyadhiitu). Committing negative actions due to overemphasizing emptiness (stong pa shas che) may lead to rebirth in the lower existences (ngan 'gro, * durgati), or even if not committing such actions, a lack of compassion (snying rje la sags pa shas chung) may lead to joining the inferior vehicles (theg pa dman pa, *hfnayiina) of Buddhist practice. Therefore, one-pointed famatha practice must be combined with the methods for cultiva­ting kindness and compassion as well as lead to realization of selflessness or radiance. In that case, it is said to lead to supreme Awakening. The segment ends with a passage attributed to \"the teacher who is a spiritual friend\" (dge ba'i bshes gnyen ston pa), which here seems to refer to Bsod nams rin chen. The passage begins with an inquiry into a distinction between the instructions (gdams pa, *avaviida) which the speaker (Bsod nams rin chen (?)) requested from fifty-five different teachers (bla ma lnga bcu lnga) and [their] ensuing explanations (rjes su bstan pa, *anusasanl). These instructions may be summed up in ten corresponding roots (rtsa bcu 976 Correlated passages: DK. a.Kha.230b4-232a2, D K.B .Dza.15. l 8br l 9bs, D K.D .Dza.15. l 9b i -20b6, DK.Q.Dza.15.326a3-327a5, DK.R.Dza.15.3 lb3-34a3, DK.S.Dza.15.32br35a3, DK.T.Dza.15.19b-20b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

The number ten seems here to refer to the said distinction between instructions and ensuing explanations, along with two sets of four Dhannas explained in the following piece, called \"the four common Dharmas\" (thun mong gi chos bzhi) and \"the four Dharmas that should always be kept in mind\" (rtag tu yid la bya ba'i chos bzhi). The word \"instruction\" or \"guidance\" (gdams pa, *avavada) is said to signify teachings given to students who are entering the path in order to show them the path, whereas the word \"ensuing explanations\" (1jes su ston pa, *anusiisani) indicates teachings meant to help the student avoid detours on the path, e.g., explanations on how to overcome unfavorable conditions and find construc­tive conditions. Thereupon, the four common Dharmas are presented, with the word \"common\" (thun mong, *siidharm:w) probably meaning that they should be followed by all seasoned practi­tioners in the Dags po community. The first is that although the student realizes everything to be Mahiimudra, he should still meditate on the bla ma over his head and make an effort in doing positive actions. Secondly, whatever practice he does, he should shun negative actions. Thirdly, although he feels no difference between being in retreat in the solitude (dben pa, zprfivivekya) or staying in town (grong, *grfima), he should remain in solitude. Fourthly, although he feels no difference between sitting upright with raised knees (tsog pu) or lying down (nyal ba) [when sleeping?], he should meditate sitting upright (tsog pu). Next, the set of \"four Dharmas that should always be kept in mind\" are laid out. The first is that the practitioner should always keep in mind the cultivation of kindness, compas­sion, joy, and equanimity and the contemplations of death and impermanence, the cause and effect of actions, and the suffering of sm?1sfira. Secondly, he should always remember to meditate on himself as the deity, invite the wisdom aspects (ye shes sems dpa', *jniinasattva), and then make offerings and praises to the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Thirdly, during all daily activities he should meditate on guruyoga and let the mind rest in an uncontrived state (sems ma bcos par bzhag). Fourthly, he should from time to time dedicate the beneficence he has gathered and make wishing-prayers (smon lam, *pra�1idhana). The segment ends by stating that these four Dharmas to be kept in mind were instructed by the precious one (rin po che) to authentic men (dam pa skyes po). Segment DK.A.Dza.16: The segment begins (DK.A.Dza.16. 19b6): na mo ratna guru/ yang 'jug ldog gi bye brag nil.

These are explained in the form of analogies, some of which are clarified by brief interlinear notes.

These three experiences should be fostered in a manner free from clinging. The three experiences to be avoided are: (1) an experience which is like a traveler remembering his motherland after recognizing the road (this is explained in a note as refer­ring to remembering one's former studies, received empowerments, service to the bla ma, practices and so forth, and then practicing these); (2) an experience which is like a person's time being up (this is explained in a note as meaning that one feels sad when after meditating on emptiness, signs [of accomplishment] do not appear); and (3) an experience which is like bad dependencies manifesting as negative influences (bdud, *miira) (this is explained in a note as referring to turning back after seeing how others practice the Gene­ration Stage and achieve powers by propitiating worldly deities and spirits, and then thinking that something similar was not achieved by oneself). It is then stated that when these three negative experiences arise, the yogf should deter them by meditating on powerful remedies. These remedies are explained in a note saying that the yogf should contemplate the short time that is left of his life even though he has attained a precious human body as well as contemplating the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death, the suffering of the six sm1isaric existences, the great suffering of the three lower existences, and then resolving always to remember and rely on the bla ma's instructions in order to remedy these sufferings. The segment ends with the prayer (quoted in Tibetan above): \"By this as well, may vast benefit be brought about for the teachings and for sentient beings! May it be auspicious!\" While the segment and the overall text DK.A.Dza thus do not end with any colophon in xylograph DK.A, a colophon is found in the older manuscript DK.a, which says: [This was] the instruction on the birthless Mahamudra by the venerable meditator from Dag po of the *Rnyi clan (rje btsun *[r]nyi sgom). For the sake of overcoming birth and death along with smtistira, I have written down the bla ma's sayings and my own meditative experiences.978 In the Tibetan text, the word gnyis sgom should be read as *rnyi sgom and the word 'jigs pa'i should be read as *'jig pa'i. While this colophon does not reveal the name of the author, it indicates that the whole or a part of text DK.a.Dza was written by a later author as a mixture of sayings attributed to the venerable meditator from Dag po of the Rnyi clan, i.e., Bsod nams rin chen, combined with passages describing the author's own meditative experiences (rang gi nyams myong). It is possible that the colophon was known to the makers of the first xylograph (ms DK.A) through its presence in ms DK.a but that they consciously omitted it due to its contents, given that the colophon clearly indicates that the 978 DK.a.Kha.232a5: rj e btsun dags po gnyis sgom gyi phyag rgya chen po skye ba med pa'i gdam ngag!

Or, if the makers of ms DK.A were not familiar with ms DK.a, its omission in ms DK.A could equally be explained in the way that the colophon is not an original part of the work and was transmitted only through some recensions of the earlier transmission lines of text Dza -here represented by ms DK.a -and that it therefore was not attested by the manuscript(s) that formed the basis for the first xylograph, ms DK.A. 5.20 DK.A. Wa: Sayings of the Dharma Master, the Doctor from Dags po: The Mahiimudrii Instruction Descending from Above along with Manifold Songs (Chos rj e dags po lha rj e 'i gsung te phyag rgya chen po 'i man ngag thog bahs dang mgur 'bum rnams bzhugs so) 11 folios, 18 segments, 9 internal colophons. Text DK.A.Wa consists of two main parts. The first part is entitled \"The Mahiimudrii Instruction Descending from Above\" (phyag rgya chen po'i man ngag thog babs). The expression \"descending from above\" (thog babs), generally speaking, denotes something that drops or has dropped from the sky, such as lightning, a meteoritic rock, or a religious object made from such stone. Here, however, the phrase is employed metaphorically to describe a contemplative technique of entering into deep meditation in an immediate manner, as opposed to gradually building up the medita­tion practice. The same title is also used for segment DK.A.Ra.3. As discussed above, Sa skya Par:ic;lita later criticized Bka' brgyud Mahiimudrii of being a Chinese Chan Buddhist teaching in disguise. Specifically, he accused the Bka' brgyud pas of simply having changed the Chinese Chan terms \"falling from above\" (yas 'bab, *shangjiang _!:_�if) and \"climbing from below\" (mas 'dzegs, *xiadeng T1t) into the familiar Indian terms \"instantaneous\" (cig char ba or cig car ba, *yugapad) and \"gradual\" (rim gyis pa, *anupiirva or *kranwria) in order to hide the doctrine's Chinese origin. While it certainly is true that the Tibetan expressions yas 'bab and mas 'dzes are not attested anywhere in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum whereas the terms \"instantaneous\" and \"gradual\" are frequently used, it is notable that the present phrase \"descending from above\" (tlwg babs) corresponds closely in meaning to the Chinese term \"falling from above\" (yas 'bab, *shangjiang _!:_�if). The Chinese term likewise consists of two syllables meaning 'above' (shang _!:_ = thog or yas) and 'falling' or 'descending' (Jiang �if = babs). It is evident that the two Tibetan words yas \"above\" and thog \"on, above\" can be used interchangeably, because segment DK.A.Ra.3 contains a sentence (DK.A.Ra.3.5a2), wherein the two words yas and thog are placed appositionally next to each other as plain synonyms: \"This Mahiimudrii instruction descending from above (thog babs), which should be applied from above (yas thog tu gdab pa), has two points\" (phyag rgya chen po'i gdam ngag thog babslyas thog tu gdab pa 'di la don gnyis te/).979 Nevertheless, the similarity between the attested Tibetan 979 A highly similar sentence is seen in the segment DK.A.Wa.1.11_2 with only minor reading variants: phyag rgya chen po 'i gdam ngag thog bahs dang! yang thog tu byung ba 'di la don gnyis tel. In the older ms DK.a .Kha.80b.1, the word dang/is omitted and it reads gyur pa instead of byung ba."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 415 term thog bahs and the non-attested Sino-Tibetan term yas bahs ( *shangjiang __tji�) may be a mere coincidence, because no equiv alent for the other paired Sino-Tibetan term \"clim­bing from below\" (mas 'dzegs, *xiadeng i:-�) appears in texts DK.A.Wa or DK.A.Ra.3. These issues will be discussed in further detail in the segment summary. The first overall part of the manual consists of segments DK.A.Wa.1-5. It is stated in its several internal colophons to have been transmitted through Bsod nams rin chen's younger nephew, Slob dpon Bsgom chung to Slob dpon Stod lung pa. In the older ms DK.a, Stod lung pa (also spelled Stod lungs pa) is identified with the personal name Tshul khrims ye shes. It is added that he, in turn, gave this instruction to the actual writer of the text, who only refers to himself as \"me\" (bdag), but who can thus be identified as a student of Tshul khrims ye shes. In ms DK.A, however, the name Tshul khrims ye shes only appears in one of the colophons and is there separated from the epithet Stod lung pa, in the way that Stod lung pa gave the instruction to Tshul khrims ye shes. Moreover, in ms DK.A, none of the references to \"me\" is attested and they have possibly been intentionally deleted given the lack of a concrete name in these references. The \"Aciirya from Stod Valley\" (i.e., Slob dpon Stod lung pa) is a person who appears several times in the Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum. The exact same transmission line from Bsgom chung to Bstod lung pa to \"me\" is attested in the colophons of segments DK.A.Tha.39 and DK.A.Tha.41. As mentioned above in the description of segment DK.A.Tha.41, the older ms DK.a there adds the nickname Dbu se, \"grey-head,\" after the epithet Bstod lung pa, thus indicating the epithet to be referring to the first Karma pa Dus gsum mkhyen pa, who was known by this nickname. In ms DK.a of the present segment, however, the epithet Slob dpon Stod lung pa is specified as belonging to a person named Tshul khrims ye shes, which is not a name associated with Dus gsum mkhyen pa. The identific ation of these titles and personal names is a problem that still awaits a satisfactory solution. The second overall part of text Wa consists of segments DK.A.Wa.6-18. It contains an early collection of songs (mgur 'bum) attributed to Bsod nams rin chen. Among these, segments DK.A.Wa.15-18 appear to have been appended at a later stage. Segment DK.A.Wa.1: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.1. lb1): !bla ma dam pa mams la phyag 'tshal lo/ /p hya rgya chen po'i gda m ngag thog bahs dang yang thog du byung ba 'di la don gnyis tel.

This instruction has two points. First, there is a part dispelling 98° Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.80b1 -8lbi, DK.B.Wa.l.lb1-3a2, DK.D.Wa.l.lb1-2bs, DK.Q.Wa.1.327b5-328b4, DK.S.Wa.1.1 b1-3bs, DK.T.Wa.1.1 b-2b, Phyag ch en mdzad vol.

The text is omitted in DK.R."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"416 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum five mistaken ideas (log par rtog pa lnga bsal ba).981 This is followed by a presentation ofthe actual instruction (gdam ngag dngos). As for the five mistaken ideas, the first is called \"a mistaken idea about the essence\" (ngo bo la log rtog). Here, the practitioner wrongly believes that he should first abandon the present bad mind (da lta'i sems ngan pa), while he thinks that knowledge or wisdom (ye shes, *jii ana) is good (bzang po). The text rejects this belief and retorts that, according to the tradition of this instruction, the root of all phenomena, [whether good or bad], is the mind (chos kyi rtsa ba sems yin te). Consequently, there is nothing to be abandoned in the mind. The second mistaken idea concerns the object (yul la log pa). This refers to the opinion ('dad pa, *abhipriJ.ya) that the practitioner should abandon the five poisons (dug lnga), i.e., afflictive emotions including pride, desire, anger, jealousy, and stupidity. It is answered that in the tradition of this instruction these emotions should not be eliminated but should be utilized as part of the path (lam du 'khyer ba). The third mistaken idea concerns time (dus la log par rtog pa), namely to think that realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha) can first take place after three incalculable world-ages (bskal pa grangs med pa, *asm?ikhyeyaryi kalpam).982 This is a common view held with regard to Mahayana practice, and it later became -as discussed above -one of the points raised as a criticism against Bka' brgyudMahiJ.mudriJ. by Sa skya Pai:ic.!ita. The segment rejects this idea by saying that the tradition of this instruction maintains the present [moment] to be self-realization (da !ta rang rtogs par 'dad). The fourth mistaken idea concern s insight, namely to think that realization is achieved by means of knowledge (rig pa, *vidya). This is rejected by saying that the tradition of this instruction maintains realization to be achieved by means of the instruction (gdams ngag, *avaviida). The fifth mistaken idea is to consider buddhas to be good and sentient beings to be bad. This is refuted on the ground that there is no substantial differ­ence between buddhas and sentient beings, the only difference being whether the nature of the mind has been realized or not. Having dispelled these five erroneous views, the segment goes on to present the actual instruction in three points. The first point is called \"skill in beginning the meditation\" (sgom mgo rtsom pa la mkhas pa). It concerns assuming the proper sitting posture for meditation and letting the mind begin to rest in its own essence in a manner of \"descending from above\" (thog babs su bzhag). This means leaving the mind in its own state (rang lugs) with­out applying any [artificial] effort, namely in an uncontrived meditative experience of bliss, presence, and non-thought. This is to recognize the undeluded mind (sems ma khrul pa la ngos bzung ba). Further, the yogi also needs to recognize the deluded mind (sems khrul pa la ngos bzung ba). Here, the meditator observes all thoughts that arise and look at these in a 981 The dispelling of the five mistaken ideas has been summarized by David P. JACKSON (1994:82fn. 199). 982 For a general explanation of the three incalculable aeons that it in Mahayana literature is saidfor a bodhisattva to complete the path, see KRAGH (2013a: 166, 208). One incalculable aeon is defi­ned in Abh idharmakofo as consisting of 1057 human years. It is said to include the full time it takes for a universe to manifest, remain, and be destroyed."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 417 manner of \"descending from above\" (thog babs su blta) while applying insight (shes rab, *prajiia). He should observe the trace left in the mind when a thought arises and recognize that this vacuum is not without mind (sems med pa ma yin); rather, there is a mind empty of any essence, a lucid openness, wherein matrix (dbyings, *dhatu) and knowledge (ye shes, *jiiana) are non-dual. The meditator thus sees the mind, which is Buddha when realized. He sees it in its beginningless being, as embracing all phenomena, seeing what is beyond the objects of sensory perception, meaning that the mind is not established in any discernable form possessing color or shape. The second main point of the instruction is called \"skill in stabilizing the experience during [the meditation practice]\" (bar nyams brten pa la mkhas pa). This relates to managing mental agitation (rgod pa, *auddhatya) and dullness (hying ba, *Zaya). When feeling agitated, the meditator should simply let the mind be in its own state (rang gi thog tu gtang) . When feeling dull or drowsy, he should stimulate the mind making it a bit agitated and then gaze at that state. The third main point of the instruction is called \"skill in stopping [the meditation] at the end\" (tha mar 'phro gcod pa la mkhas pa). Here it is explained that the meditator should keep the length of the meditation session clear and short. He should spread out the sessions well without becoming fed up with the practice. The segment ends with a colophon (quoted in Tibetan above) saying: \"The transmission of Sgam po pa, the precious one, including knots for keeping tabs [of the points] of the Mahamudra Descending from Above was instructed to Acarya Stod lung pa [based on] Dags po Sgom chung's booklet.\" The colophon thus indicates that the instruction came from Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen and was given to Acarya Stod lung pa through the intermediary of a booklet (phyag dpe) belonging to Dags po Sgom chung, i.e., Bsod nams rin chen's younger nephew. The colophon's mention of a booklet in the possession of Dags po Sgom chung is highly significant, for it is the first attestation in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum of the existence of an early written record of Bsod nams rin chen's instructions. It thereby points directly to textual prototypes for the material that eventually came to be included in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum corpus. The expression \"knots for keeping tabs\" (rtsis kyi rgya mdud) seems to refer either concretely or figuratively to the ancient Tibetan device of using a system of different types of knots tied on strings (ju thig) for purposes of memorization, record keeping, and arithmetic.983 In the older ms a (DK.a.Kha.8la6-8lb1), the colophon includes the name Tshul khrims ye shes after the epithet Slob dpon Stod lung pa, and then continues the colophon with an additional phrase, \" ... who [in turn] gave it to me\" (des bdag la gnang ba'o). Segment DK.A.Wa.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.2.3a2): lbla ma rin po che la phyag 'tshal zhing skyabs su mchi'o/ /'o cag rnams kyis mi lus rin po che th ob nas/. It ends 983 For a nineteenth-century Tibetan text on the related device of using knots on strings for divi­nation purposes, see the illustrated manuscript entitled Srid pa 'phrul gyi ju thig gi dp yad don snang gsal sgron me by 'Jam-mgon 'Ju Mi pham 'Jam dbyangs rnam rgyal rgya mtsho (1846-1912) in vol. la of his collected works (TBRC W23468-2019)."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"418 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum (DK.A.Wa.2.3b6): /bla mas gsungs pa de mad par mchis sol /zhal gyis gdams pa'o//.984 The second segment creates somewhat of a contrast to the first segment's emphasis on there being no need for abandoning anything and simply to take the present moment as realiza­tion itself. Instead, the present segment contains a motivational piece that strongly admonishes the yogi to meditate with diligence. It does so by stressing the importance of practice through several analogies. First, it says, if a person who has attained a valuable human rebirth does not accomplish (ma grub na) any teaching, it is comparable to choosing to drink from a jar full of poison instead of from a jar full of longevity medicine. If someone meets a buddha and receives his teachings but does not turn away from this life and does not accomplish any benefit, he is no different from Rudra or a demon. If someone who has listened to the Mahiiyiina teachings does not engender the twofold resolve for A wakening, he is no different from an evil person (mi nag) and is very stupid like a pig (shin tu glen pa phag lta bu). If someone who has produced certainty is unable to turn his mind away from food and sense pleasures, his torment is no different from that of a hungry ghost. If someone has developed a good meditation and has managed to let radiance appear in the mind, but nevertheless clings to this life and is unable to give up the five mental poisons, he will in spite of his meditation not become liberated from sm?1siira. He is a lunatic even among crazies and is despicable even among vulgar people. The five or three mental poisons constantly confuse us (here the segment speaks in the first person), so now we should apply ourselves by not entertaining these emotions and not letting them confuse us. It is necessary to be careful and attentive, not letting these emotion s arise even in the first place. Gradually, signs of progress will then appear. The yo gf needs to see for himself whether his Dharma practice benefits himself or not. In this way, he must guide himself, for there is no better advice than the advice that one gives to oneself. The se gment ends by saying that these words spoken by the bla ma are truthful and are his oral instruction (zhal gyi gdams pa). There is no colophon. The segment contains many interlinear notes throughout. Segment DK.A.Wa.3: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.3.3b6): Ina mo gu ru/ tshe cig po de nyid la sangs rgya bar byed pa'i phyag rgya chen po'i man ngag nil.

This corresponds to the teaching previously taught in segments DK.A.Ca.18, DK.A.Tha.38, DK.A.Na. I, and DK.A.Dza. l. In order to ascertain the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittatii), the yogi needs to ascertain the nature of experience (snang ba, *avabhasa). This is done in three steps, the first of which is to understand experiences to be non-existent (med pa, *abhiiva). Next, the practitioner should understand that although experiences as such are non-existent they nevertheless emanate from awareness (shes pa'i cho 'phrul, *\"jiiiinapriitihiira). Finally, the yogi should see that the meditative experience thereof is inexpressible (smrar mi btub pa). Having transmitted the instruction on how to ascertain experience and the mind as such, the segment goes on to explain the method for practicing this understanding in meditation (nyams su !en pa 'i thabs), namely how to rest in the state of the co-emergent mind as such. This point is explained in some detail including a brief mention of the four yogas of Mahamudrii. Thereupon, the manner in which realization arises (skye lugs) is presented with a threefold division into (1) gradual realization (rim gyis skye ba), (2) realization taking place in leaps (thod rgal du skye ba), and (3) instantaneous realization (cig car du skye ba). Finally, there is a brief remark on the result of attaining dharmakiiya and the form-kiiyas. The segment ends with a colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"The sayings of the precious meditator from the sNyi clan of Dags po were instructed to Dags po Sgom chung. He taught them to Acarya Stod lung pa, who taught them to Tshul khrims ye shes.\" In the older ms a (DK.a.Kha.82b4), there are two variants in this colophon similar to the variants seen in the colophon of segment DK.a.Wa. l, in that it reads: \" ... He taught them to Aciirya Stod lungs pa Tshul khrims ye shes, who gave them to me\" (des slob dpon stod lungs pa tshul khrims ye shes la gdams pa des bdag la gnang ba). Segment DK.A.Wa.4: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.4.4b2): Ina mo gu rul bla ma rin po che'i ma h'a mu tra'i gegs bsel nil. It ends (DK.A.Wa.4.5a3) with the colophon: lbla ma rin po che'i phyag dpe/ khu dbon gnyis ka'i gsung sgrosl slob dpon stod lungs pa la gdams pal gegs sel gyi man ngag gol/.986 The fourth segment presents an explanation called \"removing obstacles for Mahiimudrii\" (ma ha mu tra'i gegs bsel). It is here explained that the word Mahiimudrii signifies 'emptiness' (stong pa nyid, *siinyatii) and that there are two kinds of emptiness: an artificial emptiness (bcos ma'i stong pa nyid') and a natural empti­ness (rang bzhin gyis stong pa nyid'). It is stated that buddhahood is only reached by reali­zing the natural emptiness, since the artificial emptiness is subject to verbal expressions [in the form of philosophical treatises]. This is supported by a quotation from Nagarjuna. It is followed up by a brief outline of the four misunderstandings of emptiness (shor ba bzhi)987 986 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.82b4-83as, DK.B.Wa.4.4b2-5a3, DK.D.Wa.4.4as-4b6, DK.Q.Wa.4.330ar330h DK.S.Wa.4.6b1-7bi, DK.T.Wa.4.4n-4b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

This is illustrated with a scriptural quotation from the Ratnakt\"i,ta scripture. It is concluded that the natural emptiness is what must be cultivated in meditation. Nonetheless, this kind of emptiness cannot be met with in any cave, it cannot be discerned even in India, and it cannot be shown by any example. Rather, it is entirely beyond language. Hence, Mahamudrii is without a view (lta ba med). If the yogfholds a view, this view will always be one-sided (phyogs ris, *ekiinta?). In sum, the practitioner should simply rest pristinely (so ma), naturally (rang thang), and at ease (lhug pa) in an inner state of discerning the mind (sems kyi 'khris thag rbad kyis bead pa'i ngang). The segment ends with a colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"The booklet of the precious bla ma [containing] the sayings of the uncle as well as the nephew was instructed to Aciirya Stod lungs pa. [This was] the transmission for removing obstacles.\" The colophon thus indicates the existence of another booklet (phyag dpe), which belonged to someone here only referred to as the \"precious bla ma\" (bla ma rin po che). This title could denote Bsod nams rin chen or, else, some later bla ma who had such a booklet in his possession. The booklet is said to have contained sayings (gsung sgros) spoken by the uncle and the nephew (khu dbon gnyis), i.e., Bsod nams rin chen and one of his two nephews, probably the older nephew and main lineage-holder Tshul khrims snying po. The booklet or its teachings were given as instructions to Aciirya Stod lungs pa. In the older ms DK. a, the same colophon contains an additional line stating\" ... who, in tum, gave it to me\" (des bdag la snang ngo). Finally, the colophon gives the name of this segment as \"the transmission for removing obstacles\" (gegs sel gyi man ngag). Segment DK.A.Wa.5: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.5.5a3): Ina mo gu ru /p hyag rgya bzhi'i gdam ngag la/.

The first mudrii is the action seal (las kyi phyag rgya, *karmamudrii) through which the experience of the co-emergent (*sahaja) is exemplified to the initiant. By engaging in Tantric intercourse, the practitioner experiences ordinary, sarrisiiric pleasure of sexual arousal, which is to be taken as an example for the bliss of the co-emergent (dpe'i lhan cig skyes pa). Once the practitioner can sense this bliss without any feeling of attachment and recognize its essencelessness, he should during intercourse enter into a meditative experience of bliss, presence, and non-thought. This is referred to as the actual *sahaja (don gyi than cig skyes pa). It should be noted that the term *sahaja is here used in its traditional Tantric sense of a meditative experience that arises 988 The four pitfalls correspond to the three pitfalls (gal sa gsum) mentioned in segment DK.A.Nya.15. 989 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.83a5-83b6, DK.B.Wa.5.5a3-5b4, DK.D.Wa.5.4b6-5b1, DK.Q.Wa.5.330b3-331�, DK.S.Wa.5.7br8h DK.T.Wa.5.4b-5b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The second mudra is the reality seal (chos kyi phyag rgya, *dharmamudra), which is related to the practitioner's conduct or daily activities (las, *kar­man). It is said to refer to a behavior where the practitioner remains balanced in his experience of reality (don, *tattva) throughout all activities, to the extent that there is no difference between sitting in meditation and moving about. The third mudra is the great seal (phyag rgya chen po, *mahamudra), which refers to the result ('bras bu, '\"phala) of the practice. This is here separated into two phases: one phase in which the practitioner has penetrated into an understanding of reality but still holds on to some hopes and fears, and another phase where the practitioner has become able to let go off all hopes and fears, evaluations, and words. The fourth mudra is the observance seal (dam tshig gi phyag rgya, *samayamudra), which is said to refer to creating benefit for others (gzhan don, '\"parahita). Having perfected benefit for himself, i.e., spiritual realization, the practitioner goes on to perfect benefit for others by acting with friendliness and compassion. The segment ends with a brief colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"The instruction on the four mudras [contained] in the booklet of the precious bla ma was instructed to Acarya Bsgom chung.\" In this case, the colophon is identical to the one seen in the older ms DK.a. The colophon thus states that this teaching existed in the written form of a booklet (phyag dpe) belonging to the \"precious bla ma\" (bla ma rin po che), presumably referring to Bsod nams rin chen, and that he gave it or taught it to his younger nephew Bsgom chung Shes rab byang chub. This agrees with the same transmission pattern seen in segments DK.A.Wa.l and DK.A.Wa.3, where instructions were said to have been given to Shes rab byang chub. In those colophons, however, the instructions were further said to have been passed on to Acarya Stod lung pa, who is not specified in the present colophon. This was the last of the segments within the present manual (DK.A.Wa.1-5) imparting Mahamudra instructions, a textual cycle which in the overall title of the work seems to be the part that is referred to by the name \"The Mahamudra Instruction Descending from Above\" (phyag rgya chen po'i man ngag thog babs). Segment DK.A.Wa.6: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.6.5b5): !bla ma dam pa rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ /p hyi nas pha ma'i rgyu rkyen shar/. It ends (DK.A.Wa.6.6b1): Ire dogs su ma lta rnal 'byor kun//.990 Starting with segment DK.A.Wa.6, the remaining segments of text DK.A.Wa contain a series of religious songs (mgur, *gfti), which in the overall title of DK.A.Wa (a title that is not attested in ms DK.a) are referred to as \"Manifold Songs\" (mgur 'bum). None of the songs are here attributed to any specific authorship. DK.A.Wa.6 contains a song in sixteen verses written in meter. The first eight verses follow a pattern, where verse-line a expresses something that arises on the outside (phyi nas shar), line b mentions something that arises on the inside (nang nas shar), line c using the 99° Correlated passages: DK.a.Ga.135b4-l36b2 (the passages corresponding to segments DK.A.Wa.6 and DK.A.Wa.7 are merged as a single text in DK.a), DK.B.Wa.6.5b4-6b1, DK.D.Wa.6.5b1-6as, DK.Q.Wa.6.33lad3lb6, DK.S.Wa.6.8b3-lOa2, DK.T.Wa.6.5b-6n, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

Applying this pattern, these eight verses concern rebirth as a human, turning to the divine Dharma (dam pa'i Iha chos), listening to the teachings, practicing meditation and entering meditative experiences, obtaining realization, engaging in a meditative conduct of equanimity (ro snyoms), applying effort, and having compassion for other beings. It may be noted that the first verse employs the Yogaciira term \"latent consciousness\" (kun gzhi'i rnam shes, *iilayavijfiiina). Verses 9 and 10 follow a different pattern, where verse-lines band d both state that there is a ghost ('dre gcig gda') causing harm to the practitioner's spiritual practice, when certain conditions mentioned in verse-lines a and c are present. These obstacles are said to arise from a lack of deep realization, a stagnant motivation for meditation, talking too much, and not abolishing the afflictive defilements (nyon mongs, *kle§a). Verses 11 and 12 follow a concessive pattern with lines a and c ending in \"although\" (kyang) and lines b and d ending with \"please\" ('tshal). For example, verse llab says, \"Although having realized the meaning of non-duality, please do not neglect positive actions.\" Verses 13 and 14 employ an interrogative pattern where lines ac give a parable ending in \"just like\" ('dra) and lines bd end with the rhetorical question \"shouldn't one?\" (lags sam). The points made in these lines concern requesting instructions from a learned bla ma, practicing meditation, resting in the original nature (gnyug ma), and realizing the nature of the mind before dying. Finally, in verses 15 and 16, lines ac end with the locative marker (la) and lines bd end with the phrase \"Oh, all yogis! [One] does not see ... \" (ma lta rnal 'byor kun). The latter phrase does not agree with the regular meter. The verses pertain to the view (lta ba), meditation (sgom pa), conduct (spyod pa), and result ('bras bu). The segment has no colophon. Se2ment DK.A.Wa.7: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.7.6b2): /Ina mo gu rul dang po sgro 'dogs chod lags kyang/. It ends (DK.A.Wa.7.8a3): /tshe 'di rtag par bzung ste 'khrul//. 991 The seventh segment contains another song written in meter. In fact, in the older ms DK.a, the passage corresponding to segments DK.A.Wa.6-7 constitute a single song without any separation between the two parts, whereas in DK.A a clear segment demarca­tion marker has been placed between the parts in the form of three double punctuation marks (nyis shad) and the homage niimo guru. Since the present calculation of segments is based primarily on ms DK.A, the two parts shall here been considered two separate seg­ments and hence two separate songs. The song of DK.A.Wa.7 is a complex composition utilizing several different rhythms and literary patterns. The majority of verse-lines contain seven syllables and the song mixes verses of two, three, and four verse-lines. Some of these changes between meters are indi­cated in ms DK.a by marks inserted before the beginning of a new rhythm. 991 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ga.136bz-138a2 (segments DK.A.Wa.6 and DK.A.Wa.7 are merged as a single text in DK.a), DK.B.Wa.7.6bz-8a3, DK.D.Wa.7.6a5-7b5, DK.Q.Wa.7.331br333a6,DK.S.Wa.7.10az- 12b5, DK.T.Wa.7.6n-7b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

'tshal). The first verse deals with doubt, the view, and freedom from conceptual entanglement (spros br al). The second verse concerns thought (rnam rtog, *vikal pa), meditation, and non-distraction (yengs med). The third pertains to reifying attachment ('dzin chags), conduct, and non­attachment (zhen me d). The fourth is about ambition (zhe 'dad), the result, and spontaneity (lhun grub). The fifth speaks of anxiety (nyam nga), the eight worldly concerns (chos brgyad), and remedies (gnyen po). The sixth verse takes up the issue of pretense or \"saving face\" (ngo srung), friendly relations (mthun 'jug), and letting go off pretense. The seventh verse concerns indifference (btang snyoms), laziness (le lo), and diligence (brtson 'grus). Verses 8 to 14 are two-line verses, where line a ends with a dative marker (la) and line b admonishes the practitioner not to interrupt (rgyun chad mi bgyid 'tshal) his devotion, offerings, compassion, and so forth toward the bla ma, the Three Jewels, sentient beings, etc., as well as not to be corrupted (mi bslad 'tshal) by mixed-up instructional words or conceptual thoughts. Verses 15 to 19 consist of only three lines each. Their pattern is that line a mentions something one seeks due to fear (dogs), line b identifies that which is sought with some­thing spiritual, and line c admonishes the practitioner not to engage in further thoughts of such fears. For example, verse 16 says, \"Due to the fear of cold, [you] seek clothes (gos). These are the clothes of the spontaneously accomplished original nature (gnyug ma lhun grub). Think no longer of the cold!\" Verses 20 to 22 have four verse-lines and display a pattern where d-lines end with the phrase \"if you make a ... , then make it like that\" ( ... mdzad na de la mdzod). These verses describe respectively the view, meditation, and conduct. These verses are rounded off by verse 23, which does not follow their pattern, but which concludes that the view, meditation, and conduct ought not to be thought of as three separate aspects. In the pattern of verses 20 to 22, lines ac mention various possible deficiencies (med pa, ma spangs pa, ma brtan pa, and nyes pa) for \"great meditators\" (sgom chen) and lines bd compare these problems to similes of a lost traveler, a big bird circling an empty plain, a creek running dry, a tethered donkey foal, an ill-behaved child, and an old dog. Verses 24 to 26 revert to the three-line verse structure. Here they display a pattern, where a-lines end with the expression \" ... soars within ... \" ( ... nang na ... 'phyo ), b-lines say \"even the mere name of ... is not there\" ( ... bya ba'i ming yang med), and c-lines exclaim \"see how delightful the conviction of ... is!\" ( ... thag chod blo re bde). In this manner, these four verses address the proper view, meditation, conduct, and result. This is followed by three half-verses in two lines each, with line a mentioning some­thing that occurs (byung) at the time of (dus su) forming the view, meditation, and conduct, and line b saying \"[there is] value [in] not neglecting to ... \" (la mi btang ri)."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"424 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum Verses 30-32 are again four-line verses.

The verses again address the topics of view, meditation, and action, here in erroneous versions of these. The six final four-line verses, namely verses 33-38, concern delusion ('khrul pa, *bhran­ti or *skhalita), and with the exception of verse 33, their pattern is that lines bd both end in a semi-final particle followed by the word \"deluded\" (ste 'khrul). Neither the song nor the segment contains any colophon, so the circumstances of its composition along with the name of its author remain unknown. Segment DK.A.Wa.8: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.8.8a3): /Ina mo gu ru/ gnas chos 'byung gru gsum gzhal yas khang/. It ends (DK.A.Wa.8.8a7): lyun bar chad mi 'byung dang re spro//.992 The eighth segment contains a short song in six verses. The first verse has five lines, while the remaining five verses all have four lines with either seven or eight syllables in each line. The first verse states that the poet will sing this song while staying in a place called \"the bear den crystal rock cave\" (dom tshang she! gyi brag ph ug). The five remaining verses all end their d-lines with the phrase \"[I am] filled with joy over. .. \" ( ... dang re spro). The second verse refers the Bka' brgyud lineage stemming from Naropa and Maitr!pa. The third verse mentions praying to the bla ma widely known as \"Sgam po pa\" (yangs su grags pa'i sgam po pa), thus revealing that the song probably was written by a follower of Sgam po pa rather than by Bsod nams rin chen himself. This would also agree with the use of the lineage name Bka' brgyud, the usage of which as a name for this tradition seems to be of slightly later date. The fourth verse speaks of *sahaja and *Mahamudra, while the fifth verse mentions the Tantric oral transmission (snyan brgyud) and the method path (thabs lam, *upiiyamiirga). The final verse expresses joy in how the flaki1:1zs watch over yogis who are pure and whose observances (dam tshig, *samaya) are not polluted by deceit and hypocrisy (g.yo sgyu, *kii,takapafa or *mayasathya). The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.Wa.9: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.9.8a1): /Ina mo gu ru/ rgyu 'bras khyad du gsod pa de/. It ends (DK.A.Wa.9.8b3): /'di ni 'bras bu'i 'khyer so yin//.993 The ninth segment contains another song in five verses describing the view, meditation, conduct, and result. With the exception of the second verse, each verse has four lines, mostly with seven syllables in each verse. The first verse describes the wrong views of nihilism and etemalism. The second verse, which in all the extant versions only has three lines, states the right view. The second verse, like all the remaining verses, ends its last line (d) with the phrase \" .. .is the right way of adopting the ... \" ( ... 'khyer so yin).

It ends (DK.A.Wa.l0.8b7): flus phung por 'dzin pa'i zhen pa log/.994 The tenth segment contains a song in seven verses. Most lines consist of seven syllables, but several lines have eight syllables exhibiting a meter where the first syllable is to be sung separately with a prolonged stress of two morae (miitre). In the older ms DK.a, segments W a. 9-10 constitute a single segment, and hence probably a single song. However, ms DK.AW a exhibits a clear segment demarcation between the two parts and they are therefore counted accordingly as two segments in the present survey. The first four verses of DK.A.Wa.10 display a pattern, where line a ends with a condi­tional particle (na), line b ends in the expression \"there is no time for ... \" ( ... dus med), while line d ends in the phrase \"happy is the man who ... \" ( ... mi re bde ). In this manner, verse one describes the need for overcoming the five mental poisons (dug lnga), verse two expresses the need for the yogi to free himself from social relationships, verse three admonishes the yogi to regard food and wealth as hallucinatory, and verse four proclaims the need for realizing radiance while staying in a meditation retreat (mtshams). The last three verses of the song have a different pattern where line a ends in an instrumental particle (-s) and line d describes how a mendicant (ldom bu pa) wandering in the mountain wilderness (ri khrod 'grim pa) abandons attachment (zhen pa log). Thus, verse five praises how the mendicant ab andons attachment to outer things that are the objects of sensory perception. Verse five highlights that the same attitude is needed towards the inner perceiving mind. The last verse speaks about the physical body as the intermediary between these two, how the body is a deity (yi dam lha, *i�_tadevatii) without the two kinds of self, and how the yogi thereby overcomes attachment to the body. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.Wa.11: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa. l 1.8b7): Ina mo gu ru/ /'jig rten bya ba kun spangs nas/. It ends (DK.A.Wa.11.9�): /bla ma rje la rtogs par 'bul//.995 The eleventh segment contains a song in six verses with seven syllables in each line. It exhibits no other particular compositional pattern. According to its last line (quoted in Tibetan above), the song is concerned with presenting the anonymous composer's realization (rtogs pa) to his unnamed, venerable teacher (bla ma rje). 994 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ga. 138br139a1 (DK.a has no separation between segments DK.A.Wa.9-10), DK.B.Wa.

The second verse points out that the illusory body (sgyu ma'i lus) is light and blissful, the breath is empty without coming and going, the meditation is clear without dullness and agitation, while the mind is without an identifiable self. With the third verse, the composer enters more deeply into a description of his meditative state. He sings that it is like space not resting on anything, a matrix (klong, *dhatu) empty of thought and expression, a self-aware self-clarity that is gentle and joyous, an unceasing present moment never seen before. In verse four, he turns to the outcome of such meditation, saying that when resting uninterruptedly in this pristine state, accomplishment (dngos grub, *siddhi) arises. Without cultivating this, the practitioner will not become free of suffering. Not yet fully free from such sa1Jisaric problems, the yogf describes in verse five that he has meditated day and night in this manner, thereby bringing about stability in his meditative concentration (ting 'dzin, *samadhi), guiding it along together with knowledge (ye shes, *jfiana). In the final verse of the song, the composer declares that by doing so he has now abandoned applying remedies against thoughts and has entered a conduct (spyad, *carya) free from remedies. Proclaiming this meditative experience (nyams myong, *anubhava) to be the extent of his realization (rtogs tshad), he offers this realization to his venerable bla ma. The segment has no colophon.

The verse lines are of varying length with either seven or eight syllables in each line. They follow a pattern where a-lines end with a temporal ablative construction ( ... nas) or in some case with an instrumental particle; b-lines end with the phrase \"led to forgetting ... \" ( ... brjed de th at). In the final verse having three lines, the brjed de that construction occurs in the c-line. The song describes how the composer gradually progressed in his meditative practice, slowly \"forgetting,\" i.e., letting go of, various artificialities. Thus, in the first half-verse he says that cutting off delusion ( 'khrul pa, *bhranti) at its root led to forgetting the delusion of ignorance (ma rig 'khrul pa, *avidyabhranti). In a similar manner, he describes how by realizing the inner meaning of the inseparability of the three kayas, he forgot all knowledge based only on hearing or studying (go lo 'i shes pa). Reflecting repeatedly on the instruc­tions of the oral lineage (snyan brgyud), he forgot all written notes with their black [ink] letters (yig nag gi zin bris).

The first verse has four lines, the second has six lines, the third has five lines, and the fourth verse has six lines. The verses display a pattern, where the last line ends in the phrase \"although [I] have no .. ., I do not worry\" ( ... med de nga mi 'gyod). The last line of the song makes a reference to Mi la ras pa, stating \"Mi la ras pa is joyful\" (mi la ras pa dgyes yin) or eventually \"Oh Mi la ras pa, [I] am joyful,\" if the name is taken as being in the vocative case. Hence, it seems that either Mi la ras pa or Bsod nams rin chen should be understood as being the composer of the song, depending on how the final line is interpreted. The delightfu l song describes the life of an anchorite in a mountain hermitage, who has to make do without any outer religious belongings or ritual implements. In the first verse, the composer describes how he views his illusory body (sgyu lus) as a mwujala of buddhas or jinas (rgyal ba'i dkyil 'khor) wherein he performs his offerings (mchod pa 'bul), and therefore he does not worry that he has no [outer] offering substances (mchod rdzas med de nga mi 'gyod). In the second verse, he goes on to say that he considers the outer environ­ment to be a self-arisen palace [of the meditational deity] (rang 'khrungs gzhal yas khang). In this sense, there is a palace no matter where he stay s and anyone he meets is a medita­tional deity (yi dam lha), and for this reason he does not worry that he has no icon [of the deity] (thang sku med de nga mi 'gyod). The third verse says that he makes a drawing of the five sense-faculties with the ink of great insight on the paper of the white and red [energies]. Whatever is experienced thus becomes his Dharma text, and he therefore does not worry that he has no books (dpe cha med de nga mi 'gyod). In the final verse, the composer says that a yogf without worries is very joyous. All sentient beings posses the real nature (de nyid, *tattva) but do not realize it. Yet, having applied himself to the profound instructions, a meditation inseparable from the three kiiyas has emerged; [therefore] \"Mi la ras pa is joyful.\" The segment has no colophon.

The first two verses discuss the right view (lta ba). It states that the composer thinks that, on one hand, one cannot abandon thought (rnam rtog,*vikalpa) and, on the other hand, one cannot accomplish non-conceptuality (rtog med, *nirvikalpa). He perceives this absence of conceitedness (snyems bra!) to be the essence of the mind (sems kyi ngo bo, *cittasvabhiiva). Beyond the extremes of existence and non­existence, the view should be unchanging ('gyur med) and liberating in and of itself (rang grol). The second verse ends with the phrase \"do not engage in any ... \" (bgyi yang mi 'tshal lo); a phrase that is repeated at the end of verses three and four. The third verse describes meditation (sgom pa) and conduct (spyod pa). The meditation should be free from clinging and be blissful and clear, and the meditator should not strive to break it up into sessions (thun, *prahara). The conduct should be self-arisen (rang byung) and at ease (!hug pa), and the yogi should avoid hypocrisy (tshul 'chos). The last half-verse presents the result ('bras bu), which is equanimity (mnyam nyid) of the three times, and the practitioner should not engage in any hope or fear (re dogs).

After paying homage to the bla mas as the fathers, the first half-verse requests the fjiiki�ifs, who are the mothers, to remove obstacles and lead the composer straight up a suitable path. In the second verse, the song turns to describing the nature of the mind. Blissful, present awareness (rig pa bde gsal)is the matrix of phenomena (chos kyi dbyings, *dhannadhiitu). It is unceasing radiance, performing the activity of accomplishing benefit for others. It is the union of sm71siira and nirvii�w. Describing his religious practice in the third verse, the composer goes on to say that when he prays, it is [merely] consciousness (shes pa), and he has no recitation other than this. The blackness of the letter 'a' is without a smile (a yig nag po 'dzum med pa -the meaning of this is unclear to me), and the non-duality of wind and mind (rlung sems gnyis med) is union (zung 'jug, *yuganaddha). In the final verse, which only has three lines, the author proclaims that this is Mahiimudrii whether he is going ('gro) or sitting ('dug) -the non-duality (gnyis med, *advaya) is Mahiimudrii.

The title is \"The song about the eleven points of kindness, sung by the Dharma Master, the Doctor from Dags po\". The poem is found twice in ms DK.ex (DK.A.Ga.63ai-63b5 and DK.A.Ga.1 29bs-130as). At its first occurrence (DK.cx.Ga.63b5), the song bears the title \"Mahiimudrii having eleven points of kindness\" (phyag rgya chen po bka' drin bcu gcig pa). At its second occurrence, no title is given. The song consists of twelve four-line verses with seven syllables in each line. Except for verse twelve, the d-line of every verse ends with the phrase \"[That] was the first kindness of the bla ma\" (bla ma'i bka' drin dang po yin), where the number grows with each verse, i.e., \"the second kindness\", \"the third kindness\", etc. The song is a devotional piece with an overall theme of thanking the teacher. In the first verse, the composer states that he obtained an endowed and free human rebirth (dal 'byor mi lus) due to having accumulated vast amounts of beneficence (bsod nams, *pu(iya) in previous lives and this was the first kindness of his bla ma. In the second verse, he says that he was accepted by the Buddha and received the Buddha's prediction (lung bstan, *vyiikara(Ia), and this was his bla ma's second kindness. The prediction is probably a reference to the belief that a bodhisattva on the eighth bodhisattva level (bhumi) meets a Buddha and receives a prediction by the Buddha as to when, where, and under what name the bodhisattva in the future is going to attain final Buddhahood. In the case of Bsod nams rin chen, this may, moreover, be a reference to the several Sutra predictions believed to testify his being reborn in Tibet as Sgam po pa. Later Bka' brgyud authors usually cite these scriptural passages as evidence of his authority, such the predictions found in the Samiidhiriijasutra and the Mahiikaru!iii­pu(I(l.arlkasutra mentioned above when discussing the pertinent hagiographical literature. In the third verse of the song, the author states that he has realized this dependently arisen relative reality to be experienced while it, in fact, has no real, lasting nature, and this realization was the third kindness of his bla ma. The fourth verse concerns his realization of the mind as such, understanding it to be dharmakiiya, free from conceptual proliferation (spros bra! ), and that was his bla ma's fourth kindness. This led him to see the bla ma, the buddhas of the ten directions, and his own mind as being identical, inseparable like water mixed with water; that understanding was his bla ma's fifth kindness. In the sixth verse, he says that the light of insight (shes rab snang ba, *praj1iiiloka) found in the Siitra and Tantra 1 00° Correlated passages: DK.a.Ga.63ai-63b5, DK.a.Ga. l 29b5-l 30a5, DK.B.Wa.16. 1 Oaz-lOh DK.D.Wa.16.9b6-10b1, DK.Q.Wa. 16.336as-336b6, DK.S.Wa. l6. l6b2-17b2, DK.T.Wa.16.9b-10b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Then, in the seventh verse, he expresses that anything he thought of, any need or wish, was spontaneously fulfilled, arising from his own mind, like opening the treasure chest of a monarch; this was his bla ma's seventh kindness. In the eighth verse, he sings that the notion that samsara and nirva1:1a are separate was released by itself, like ice melting into water, and that was his bla ma's eighth kindness. Unfathomable emanations (sprul pa, *nirma1:1a) appeared to train an unfathomable number of students, relying on what is fathomable like the reflection of the moon appearing in water; that was his bla ma's ninth kindness. As Jong as sm!isara has not been emptied for sentient beings, the great drum of Dhanna will continue to resound, and that is his teacher's tenth kindness. In the eleventh verse, the author says that after death new emanations will again appear in various forms, like magical manifestations, and that is his bla ma's eleventh kindness. After this grandiose proclamation, in the twelfth and final verse, the author seems to depreciate himself. He states that this three-thousand-fold world-system \"contained in a mustard seed\" (stong gsum yungs 'brur shong ba) and [this] crazy song (smyon glu) of a yogi is only meant for a few yogis, but if it were to be heard by others, it would be a great lie (brdzun du che). The fact that the song is only intended for an initiated audience might point to its esoteric and metaphoric nature. The number of eleven verses should perhaps be taken as a reference to the ten bodhi­sattva-levels (bhumi) with the added eleventh level of buddhahood (buddhabhumi) known from the Daiabhumikasutra and also taught at length in Sgam po pa's Jewel Ornament of Liberation (Thar rgyan). If so, the final verses might be less concerned with proclaiming the author's greatness in terms of his own accomplishments as it might aim to explicate what he sees as his own future development toward buddhahood in accordance with the prescribed stages of the path. In ms DK.A and its derivates, the segment has no colophon, but in the first occurrence of the song in ms DK.a (DK.a.ga.130b4. s), there is a colophon: \"The king of yogis possessing the highest realization extracted the heart essence of the glorious great bliss and then put his complete realization into [this] song.

The colophon thus identifies the song's composer as a highly respected practitioner, here referred to with the honorable epithet \"the king of yogis\" (rnal 'byor gyi db ang phyug), though it remains uncertain who that might have been. The second time the song appears in ms DK.a, there is no colophon.

It has five verses with seven syllables in each line. Verses one and five consist of five lines each, while verses two to four have four lines each. Every verse ends with the line \"I don't have the slightest regret over this\" (de yang mi 'gyod tsam zhig byung). Additionally, verses one and five have an extra line in five syllables following that sentence, which says \"Father [bla ma], I pray, bless me once again\" (pha da rung byin gyis brlab tu gsol). The first verse describes the composer's devotion to his bla ma, characterizing him as being the root of all accomplishments (dngos grub rtsa ba) and the highest emanation (sprul sku mchog). The second verse presents how the author experiences his mind as being inseparable from the chosen deity (yi dam lha, *i�fadevatii), who serves as the guide on the path (lam sna 'dren). In the third verse, he proclaims his conduct (spyod pa, *ciirya) to consist in embracing the inseparable cause and result [of the path] (rgyu 'bras dbyer med) as his spiritual path (lam 'khyer). Thereupon, in the fourth verse, he pronounces his realization that sa'!1siira and nirviil}a are of a single nature when he gazes nakedly (gcer mthong) at the unstained radiance of his own mind. In the final verse, he says that when he engages in any activity that completes the two accumulations of beneficence and wisdom, he offers these activities to his venerable bla ma, whereas when he is not engaged in such things, he simply rests (nyal) his body and mind in a relaxed state (glad la). Of course, he ends the poem with the song's refrain: \"I don't have the slightest regret over this -Father [bla ma], I pray, bless me once again!\" The segment ends with a brief colophon (quoted in Tibetan above) giving the title and stating the author to be an unnamed precious master (rje rin po che): \"[This was] the Song with a Measure of Confidence spoken by the precious master.\" Segment DK.A.Wa.18: The segment begins (DK.A.Wa.18.lla1): Ina mo gu ru/ chos rnams thams cad rgyu rkyen tshogs pa las byung ba yin/.

Thereafter, the segment continues with a song in five verses displaying several different types of verses and meters. It is difficult to discern where one verse ends and the next begins, so the verse divisions below are tentative. The first four-line verse describes the happiness of a great meditator (sgom chen bde), who has heard the teachings of a genuine bla ma, abandoned preoccupation with this life, turned his back on the eight worldly concerns, and has become free from any attachment. The second five-line verse describes the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajacittata), characterizing it as dharmakaya, admonishing the meditator to experience (nyams su long) this present and unceasing nature (gsal la ma 'gags). It then points to the multitude of perceptory experiences (snang ba) that also appears, calling them \" reflections of habitual tendencies\" (bag chags gzugs brnyan). The third four-line verse follows a pattern where the bd-lines repeat the phrase \"just don't be deceived by ... \" (ma bslus tsam). First, it states that by realizing the non-duality implicit in radiance ('od gsal zung 'jug), the yogf should \"just don't be deceived by a view of non-focusing\" (dran med kyi !ta bas ma bslus tsam). Next, by experiencing the bliss-emptiness of non-attachment (zhen med kyi bde stong), he should \"just don't be deceived by any lethargy of non-conceptuality \" (rtog med lteng pas ma bslus tsam). The fourth five-line verse describes this blis sful nature in more detail, saying it is beyond the duality of existence and non-existence; these belong to the language of being and non-being, while this is not an object of naming or analyzing, but it is beyond the intellect. The verse ends with an exclamation, saying \"that pure nature arising within oneself is a great wonder!\" (chos nyid de/ !rang la shar ba ngo mtshar che). The fifth four­line verse in seven syllables presents the mistaken view, meditation, and conduct of a mundane person still stuck in sm71sCira. This is a view that creates divisions (phyogs su byed pa), a meditation that is not free from clinging (zhen pa dang ma bra!), and a conduct clinging to dualities (gnyis su 'dzin pa). Here the first song ends and is followed by a short prose-segment describing the happy meditator who has achieved the realization that everything is his own mind and understood how to be satisfied with merely resting in this nature of mind without anything to be cultivated or meditated upon. Again, the segment turns to a short song in two verses. The first five-line verse with nine syllables in each line describes certainty and the right view, meditation, and conduct. The second two-line verse with seven syllables in each line admonishes the yogf to remain with just realizing his own mind, not to look at the words but to rely on the meaning. The segment has no colophon of its own, but in ms DK.A a scribal colophon pertaining to the 1520 Dags Iha sgam po printing of Dags po'i bka' 'bum has been added.

The fictive Sanskrit title is ungrammatical and meaningless in its current form (prakarasama-upadefo-mahamudra). It might be slightly emended to *Praka§anopade§a Mahilmudrii, but even in this emended form it does not properly reflect the meaning of the Tibetan title. The segment contains an instruction in Mahiimudra written in verses with seven sylla­bles in each line. It includes numerous glosses in the form of interspersed notes written in smaller script. The glosses explain the technical terms and expressions found in the verses. The first verse in four lines declares that everything outer and inner is Mahamudrii and asks where a contrived nature of the mind might be found within this state. It also identifies all that can be experienced (snang srid thams cad) with dharmakaya. The second verse, which only consists of three lines, says that when the yogf rests in this state without any perceptible experience (snang ba med pa) and without artificiality (ma bcos), then this is the meditation [of Mahiimudra]. As is apparent in a gloss to a later line in the text, the word \"experience\" or \"appearance\" (snang ba, *avabhiisa or zprabhiisa) is here clearly taken to mean \"thought\" or \"concept\" (rtog pa, *sm?ikalpa or *vikalpa). Hence, when Mahamudra is said to be without experience, it means that it is beyond thought or without conceptuality (rtog pa med pa, *nirvikalpa). The third four-line verse identifies Mahilmudrii as being inconceivable (bsam du med pa, *acintya) and says that when meditating on this, the yogi should rest in its state without 1003 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.99ar 100a1, DK.D.Zha. 1.1 b1-2b6, DK.Q.Zha.1.337b4-338h DK.R.Zha.1.lb1 -3b4, DK.S.Zha.I.lb1-3b4, DK.T.Zha.l.lb-2b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

When he looks at it directly (cer re bltas pa), he should understand this to be without duality (gnyis su med pa, *advaya). The fourth verse consis­ting of five lines asserts that the nature (dngos po, *svabhiiva) that appears in this way is simultaneous with the realization of emptiness. It then compares this to encountering an old acquaintance, whom one recognizes as soon as one sees him. The fifth five-line verse say s that all the various experiences in the mind (sems kyi snang ba) emerge as a multiplicity, but they are realized as emptiness (stong pa nyid, *sunyatii). A gloss identifies the expression sems kyi snang ba as meaning \"thoughts\" or \"concepts\" (rtog pa, *sm?1kal pa), which -as mentioned above -makes sense when Mahiimudrii also is defined as being snang ba med pa, i.e., beyond or without conceptuality. The same verse, moreover, com­pares this enigma of being a multiplicity yet empty to snow falling into the ocean, where the snow instantly turns into water and becomes one with the sea. An accompanying gloss explains this as referring to the realization of \"one taste\" (du ma ro gcig). The sixth five-line verse says that all experiences (snang ba thams cad) should be recog­nized as being without birth (skye ba med pa, anutpanna). A gloss here identifies \"all experiences\" as referring to \"the objects of the six external senses\" (phyi rol tshogs drug gi yul), which thus differs from how the term snang ba was understood above. Awareness is said to be appearing as a real entity, but that it is empty of any real essence. This is compared to the reflection of the moon in water. The sixth four-line verse identifies meditation as the process of familiarizing oneself with this unborn nature of the mind. Yet, \"meditation\" is just a designation, which in itself is unarisen. The seventh five-line verse again concerns meditation and declares it to be immeasurable and not divisible into sessions. Meditation -however it appears -is not separate from awareness itself and is thus uninterrupted. The eighth five-line verse pertains to the distinction between buddhahood and SaT?ISiira. Buddhahood is merely the realization of the mind's character (sems kyi mtshan nyid). Those who are unclear about this consider meditation to be divisible into absorption and post­meditation (mnyam bzhag rjes thob). The ninth six-line verse describes the realization of saryisiira as pertaining to phenomena (chos), whereas its 'clarity' or 'presence' (gsal ba, *vyakti) is the pure nature, or the 'noumenon' (chos nyid, *dhannatii), so to speak. Indeed, all experiences are non-dual (snang ba thams cad gnyis su med). The tenth verse in four lines proclaims that the three realms of smJ1siira have always been buddhahood, SaTJISiira has always been nirvii�ia, sentient beings have always been buddhas, and obscurations have always been Awakening. In response to these statements, the eleventh verse in four lines explains that since sary1Siira has never been realized as such, then to the unawakened the three realms are simply SGIJ1Siira. In order to reverse this situation, the instructions of a genuine bla ma are needed. The twelfth verse also in four lines says that as long as one does not rely on a bla ma, it is like a treasure [hidden under the house] of a poor man. Although he has a great treasure, it brings him no benefit, since he is unaware of it. It concludes that for this reason, one should cherish the bla ma's instructions.

It says there is no difference between the relative and the ultimate truths, that this is the character of dhannakaya, and that it constitutes the Buddha's ultimate intended meaning (sangs rgyas dgongs pa mthar thug). The segment ends with a brief colophon (quoted in Tibetan above), stating this poem to be \"A Summary of the Ultimate Mahiimudrii.\" Segment DK.A.Zha.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Zha.2.3a2): /lb la ma'i zhal nas/ 'di !tar ma rtogs na 'khor ba las grol thabs med gsung/. It ends (DK.A.Zha.2.3a3): !ta bas thag bead pa gal che gsung/!.1004 The second segment is a very short prose piece in only three sentences, which seems to constitute an afterthought to segment DK.A.Zha. l. Attributed to the bla ma as a saying, it states that there is no method for becoming liberated from SaJ?I­siira aside from gaining realization in this manner, that the yogf needs to train himself in this realization, and that it is crucial to ascertain the view. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.Zha.3: The segment begins (DK.A.Zha.3.3a3): /Ina mo gu ru/ rang rig rang gsal rang la gnas/. It ends (DK.A.Zha.3.3a4): /btags pa tsam las ming du bas/ ces gsungs sol/. 1005 The third segment contains a short text in three verses having three lines with seven syllables in each line. The first verse describes the nature of consciousness (shes pa, '\"jfiiina), declaring it to be self-aware (rang rig), self-radiant (rang gsal), and self­abiding (rang la gnas). It compares consciousness to a lamp placed inside a jar, presumably regarding the jar as an analogy for the physical body. The second and third verses say that if the nature of consciousness is to be expressed conventionally in words, various labels may be applied, including \"radiance\" ('od gsal), \"bliss-emptiness\" (bde stong), \"awareness­emptiness\" (rig stong), and \"experience-emptiness\" (snang stong) . However, [its nature is something other] than these mere designations. The segment ends with the phrase \"thus it was said\" (ces gsungs so), indicating the text to be a saying of a bla ma.

Following the prose piece, the remainder of the segment is a text written in five four-line verses with nine syllables in each line. The first two verses display a pattern where bd-lines end in the phrase, \"Please understand that ... \" (mkhyen par mdzad). The first two verses describe the nature of the mind and experience, referring to this nature as the pure being (chos nyid, *dharmatii), the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa), and the original nature (gnyug ma). The three final verses describe meditation on this nature, explaining how thoughts are experienced as dhannakiiya, how sm71sara as well as nirvii7Ja dissolve into the expanse of the original nature (gnyug ma'i klong), how all duality of a perceiver and something perceived dis appear into the matrix without birth (skye med dbyings), and how the result of the practice ('bras bu) emerges effortlessly. The final line of the text declares that this is the inexpressible meaning of Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po'i brjod du med pa'i don ). The text ends with a short colophon (quoted in Tibetan above), saying: \"This was writ­ten by Aciirya Bsgom tshul.\" Given the similar versified writing style and contents found in segments DK.A.Zha.1-4, it is very likely that the colophon refers to all these segments and that it thus declares Tshul khrims snying po to be the author of the text overall. Alterna­tively, the colophon could also be taken as only denoting segment DK.A.Zha.4, although that is less probable given the uniformity of the preceding segments. The colophon's use of the honorific verb mdzad pa (\"made\" or \"written\") makes it unlikely that the colophon was written directly by Tshul khrims snying po himself. Hence, it must have been added by a later hand or eventually by a scribe taking Tshul khrims snying po's dictation of the text. Segment DK.A.Zha.5: The segment begins (DK.A.Zha.5.3b4): Ina mo gu rul bla ma'i zhal nas/ chos rnams thams cad ma lus pal. It ends (DK.A.Zha.5.4b2) with the colophon: zhes gsung ngo/ phyag rgya chen po gsal byed kyi man ngag ces bya ba'o/ /rje zla 'od gzhon nus mdzad pa'o/ /p hyag rgya chen po gsal byed kyi man ngag 'di la chos tshan brgyad yodl!.1007 The fifth segment is a composite piece consisting of five disparate sayings by the bla ma, each introduced with the phrase \"from the mouth of the bla ma\" (bla ma'i zhal nas) and ending with the phrase \"thus he says\" (zhes gsung ngo). The first half of segment DK.A.Zha.5 corresponds largely to segment DK.A.Wa.18. The first saying begins with a verse in five seven-syllable lines speaking of causality and the need for abandoning harmful actions and practicing good actions. It ends with a senten­ce in prose saying that the practitioner ought not to be separated from this [principle] until reaching full Awakening. This saying corresponds closely to the prose piece that is found at the beginning of segment DK.A.Wa.18 with the only difference being that the sentences are here put in verse, leading to a few minor differences in the rhythm of the words. 1007 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.1 00brl0la6, DK.D.Zha.5.3b2-4a6, DK.Q.Zha.5.339a4-340ai, DK.R.Zha.5.4bs-6a6, DK.S.Zha.5.4b4 -6as, DK.T.Zha.5.3b-4n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

These verses are -with only very minor variations -identical to the first song in five verses found in segment DK.A.Wa.18. The verses were already summarized above (see DK.A.Wa.18). The third saying in the segment contains a prose piece, wherein some but not all lines seem to be written with the rhythm of a verse of varying line lengths. Its first part corre­sponds to the remaining prose-and verse-parts of segment DK.A.Wa.18 describing a happy meditator and his certainty in the view, meditation, and conduct. It does not include the final two-line verse of segment DK.A.Wa.18 admonishing the yogfto remain satisfied only with realizing his own mind and not to search for words but to rely on their meaning. In­stead, the present segment adds four lines of differing length describing a meditation without meditation, being free from any fixed point of reference, and resting vividly without interruption. The last two sayings found in the segment do not have any correspondence in segment DK.A.Wa.18. The fourth saying begins with a prose sentence asking what is needed in order to enter into the natural state (don rnal ma). The answer is given in the form of four verses starting with the exclamation \"How amazing!\" (e ma ho). The first verse describes a tension between an understanding of emptiness that results in non-attachment and the fact that this understanding does not involve any object to be seen (don ma mthong). Further, it expresses a tension within the meditation that is not yet free from clinging to duality while not involving any object to be seen, although meditative experience is felt. This line of thought is continued in the second verse. There, the yogf possesses a view that still lacks realization. Although his view may be said to be free from extremes, it nevertheless is merely an intellectualized understanding. The verse concludes that a great meditator (sgom chen) who has not yet cut his bonds of dependencies still possesses the cause for saf!1silra even if his samadhi is good. The third verse, which is just a half-verse in two lines, declares that a Dharma follower (chos pa) lacking compassion, even though he may be very diligent, still remains on the (lower) path of the fravakas. Finally, the fourth verse, which only consists of a single line, expresses irony, saying \"Well, of course, I am only kidding!\" (a kyang ku re bgyis pa lags). The fifth and last saying of the segment has a short text in six verse-lines consisting each of either nine or seven syllables. The lines show a binary pattern, with lines ab, cd, and ef having close connection in contents and wording. First, it is mentioned how the yogfshould look at his own mind (rang gi sems la lta ba); he needs to tum the act of viewing itself into mind (sems su gyis). When he has gained familiarity therewith, he will no longer hold onto the object and the mind as being two separate entities and thus he will come to experience the knowledge of non-duality. This is said to show the special point of the method (thabs kyi khyad par) and it is also said to show the very moment of gaining [realization] (thob pa'i dus nyid). The segment ends with a colophon (quoted in Tibetan above) that says: \"[This text] is called the Instruction Clarifying Mahamudra (phyag rgya chen po gsal byed kyi man ngag )."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"438 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum It was written by Master Candraprabha Kumasa. This Instruction Clarifying Mahi.imudrii has eight Dharma sessions.\" By giving the title Instruction Clarifying Mahamudrii, which in ms DK.A also is the overall title of text DK.A.Zha, the colophon seems to tie together segments DK.A.Zha.1-5 into a single work bearing this title. Employing an honorific verb for \"written\" (mdzad pa) and using the highly reverential title Candraprabha Kumiira to refer to Bsod nams rin chen, it declares him to be the author of the work. It also states that the text consists of eight segments or \"Dharma sessions\" (chos tshan), although only five overall segments are actually seen in the text as it is made up today. The colophon is not attested in the older ms DK.a, which is cause for suspicion regarding its authenticity. It should also be noted that the preceding segment DK.A.Zha.4 ends with a colophon of its own, which states that Bsgom tshul was the author, and that statement could be taken as applying to the whole unit DK.A.Zha.l-4. When the spurious overlap between segments DK.A.Zha.5 and DK.A.Wa.18 is also taken into consideration, it seems that segment DK.A.Zha.5 is a later addition to unit DK.A.Zha.1-4. Segment DK.A.Zha.6: The segment begins (DK.A.Zha.6.4b2): na mo gu ru/ rj e dags po lha rje'i gsung sgros tlwr bu lags/ rin po che'i zhal nas/. It ends (DK.A.Zha.6.5a1): ngo bo 'dzin med du gnas pas gol ba med pa yin gsung ngo//. 1008 Segment six begins with a title that seems to be an overall title for the remainder of text DK.A.Zha. It reads, \"[Here] are the Miscellaneous Sayings of the Master, the Doctor of Dags po\" (rje dags po lha rje'i gsung sgros thor bu lags). As the title indicates, this and the following segments contain a series of sayings (gsung sgros) attributed to the bla ma, each segment containing a single saying starting with the phrase \"From the mouth of the precious one\" (rin po che'i zhal nas) and ending with the phrase \"[Thus he] says\" (gsung ngo). The saying narrated in segment DK.A.Zha.6 concerns the topic of pitfalls (gol sa, *utpat ha or *unmarga) that exist for the great meditator (sgom chen). Here these pitfalls are regarded as twofold: mistaking meditative experience for realization (nyams myong rtogs par shor ba) and mis taking realization for meditative experience (rtogs pa nyams myong du shor ba). The segment explains that when a yogi meditates relying on a proper method, meditative experiences -such as non-thought (mi rtog) and bliss (bde ba) -will occur, and it may seem that these feelings could not be surpassed even if all the buddhas of the three times were to appear. In this manner, the meditator might come to have excessive faith (yid ches) in these temporary meditative experiences and hold onto them as supreme (mchog tu bzung). This is what is meant by mistaking meditative experience for realization, which will not yield benefit. Moreover, by the blessing of the bla ma, genuine realization may arise within of the essence of the mind, appearing in the form of a blissful feeling or a sense of presence and 1008 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.20b4-2la3, DK.D.Zha.6.4%-4b5, DK.Q.Zha.6.340a2-7.

The meditator should then cultivate this feeling undistractedly. However, if he begins to think that he is happy when it is there and unhappy when it is not there, then he might strive mentally to search out this feeling and meditate by intellectually attempting to rest his mind therein. This is to mis take realization for meditative experience. This too is unfortunate, because the meditator must remain indifferent as to whether or not the feeling of realization is there. Instead he should meditate again, now deciding to be patient with whatever happens, and in this way clarity will slowly come. Here the segment attests the word \"says\" (gsung), perhaps indicating that this sentence marks the original end of the saying. The sentence is, however, followed by a small piece giving the customary explana­tion on the term pitfall (gol sa) also seen elsewhere in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, e.g., in segments DK.A.Nya.15 or DK.A.Wa.4. It is said in brief that even a little attachment ('dzin pa bag tsam) to the meditative experience involves the risk of becoming reborn in the three realms (khams gsum), in the four states of meditative abs orption [of the material realm] (bsam gtan bzhi), or in the four fields (skye mched bzhi) [of the immaterial realm]. A brief remark is also made regarding the pitfall of a fravaka. Finally, it is said that by abiding in meditation without clinging to any essence, there will be no pitfall.

It ends (DK.A.Zha.7.5a6): /dngos po a thang chad par sgom du mi rung ba yin gsung//.1009 The seventh segment presents the Generation Stage (bskyed rim) and the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim) in terms of their nature (ngo bo, *bhava), derivative analysis (nges tshig, *nirukti), and subdivision (dbye ba, zprabheda). Also, an explanation of their purpose (dgos pa, *prayojana) is given, although this is not mentioned at the outset of the segment, where the other points to be covered are listed. Perhap s this suggests that the sentences dealing with the purposes of these two stages were added later. The contents somewhat resemble the explanations found in segment DK.A.Tha.33, where the same topics were taken up. However, the writing style and wording of the two segments are very different. First, as for the Generation Stage (bskyed rim), its nature is said to be \"union [as repre­sented in] the deity's body\" (zung 'jug lha'i sku). The derivative etymology of bskyed rim (*utpattikrama) is given as \"generated in stages\" (rim gyis bskyed pa, *kramqza utpatti(1). It subdivision is said to be according to the four types of rebirth, i.e., rebirth through a womb, egg, moisture and heat, or instant rebirth. Its purpose is stated to be superior to the Para­mitayana, the reversal of ordinary notions of the body, the dhatus, and the ayatanas, to bring about realization of union, and to give rise to the two kayas for the benefit of others. Secondly, as for the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim), its nature is freedom from concep­tual entanglement (spros bra!, *ni�prapa11ca).

To search for a spiritual teacher is said to involve faith. Faith is then divided into three major types, which are briefly explained: faith based on belief (yid ches pa'i dad pa) in cause and effect, aspiring faith ('dad pa'i dad pa) that arises from understanding the four truths of the noble ones, and enthusiastic faith (dang ba'i dad pa) created by relying on a special object. It is the spiritual teacher who stabilizes these forms of faith and consequently the saying goes on to discuss the role of this friend. It is explained how the Buddha gave teachings, with particular reference to explanations on the Tantric stages. In this context, the segment men­tions the treatises summarizing the scriptures (lung bsdu ba 'i bstan bcos) and the treatises explaining the scriptures (lung bkrol ba'i bstan bcos) compiled by \"the great Acarya(s) from Eastern Tibet\" (slob dpon khams pa chen po rnams).

The nature is here defined as the mind's natural purity (rang bzhin gyis dag pa). The essence is its awareness-aspect free from arising and ceasing (rig pa skye 'gag med pa). The character i s its experience in the form of a multitude of reflections born from habitual tendencies (bag chags kyi gzugs brnyan sna tshogs su snang ba). It is stated that the meditator is concerned with the mind's essence, which is identified with the mind of a buddha and with self-awareness (rang rig, *svasarJivedana). Several remarks are made about this essence and it is said that \"followers of the master\" (jo bo pa rnams), possibly denoting followers of Atifa who is commonly known simply as \"the master\" (jo bo ), should strive diligently until this essence has been recognized. It is stressed that the present human opportunity for gaining realization does not last and must be utilized to its fullest degree for the sake of realization. A sentence to this effect is quoted which in an interlinear note is attributed to the bKa' gdams pa master Dge ba'i bshen gnyen Spyan snga ba [Tshul khrims 'bar] (1038-1103). This is followed by some sentences emphasizing the need for contemplating and respecting karmaphala (las 'bras), which again are attributed to Spyan snga ba in an interlinear note. Pointing to the fact of impermanence, the segment concludes by stressing that life is short and that the practitioner needs to engage in his practice right now.

The text contains several internal parts pertaining to instructions on this transmission from each of the above-mentioned Indian and Tibetan teachers. The explanations given in the text are closely intertwined with verses quoted from the Indian Tantric work Acintyadvaya­kramopade§a (Bsam gyis mi khyab pa'i rim pa'i man ngag), \"Instruction on the [Meditative] Stages on the Unthinkable Non-Duality\" composed by the Indian teacher Acarya Kuddalapada or Kuddalin (tog rtse pa).1014 1013 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.22bs-23ll6, DK.D.Zha.9.5b4-6a6, DK.Q.Zha.9.34la4-34lbs, DK.R.Zha.9.8b5-10a2, DK.S.Zha.9.8b3-9b4, DK.T.Zha.9.5b-6n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The five aspects include: (1) the unthinkable nature of all outer and inner phenomena (phyi nang gi chos thams cad rang bzhin bsam gyis mi khyab pa); (2) the unthinkable method (thabs bsam gyis mi khyab pa); (3) the unthinkable conduct (spyod lam bsam gyis mi khyab pa); (4) the unthinkable manner of subsuming all phenomena [into one] (chos thams cad 'dus pa'i tshul bsam gyis mi khyab pa); and (5) the unthinkable stages ofclimbing the levels including the path and its result (sa non pa'i rim pa lam 'bras bu dang bcas pa bsam gyis mi khyab pa). Having listed these five headings, the text provides a detailed explanation on each aspect. The unthinkable nature (rang bzhin bsam gyis mi khyab pa) is explained in terms of its appearance (ngo bo ), division (dbye ba), and the appearance of its special support (khyad par rten du snang ba). Its appearance (ngo bo) is said to be bliss (bde ba), presence (gsal ba), emptiness (stong pa), and the inseparability (dbyer med) of these. These four features are then elaborated while referring to them as 'teachers' (slob dpon, *acarya), namely the teacher of bliss (bde ba'i slob dpon), the teacher of presence (gsal ba'i slob dpon), etc. The passage explaining the teacher of emptiness includes a quotation of verses 59cd-60ab of the Acintyiidvayakramopadefo. The verse in question refers to \"the tradition of Bhadrapada\" (bzang po zhabs kyi lugs yin no, bhadrapadena de5itam). The division (dbye ba) of the unthinkable nature is said to pertain to the two impure stages of Generation and Completion (ma dag pa'i bskyed rdzogs gnyis). As for the manifestation of its special support (khyad par rten du snang ba), it is stated that this nature abides in Mahamudra, signifying what is unborn, unceasing, and unchanging. Next, the text takes up the unthinkable method (thabs bsam gyis mi khyab pa). It com­mences by quoting nineteen verse lines, consisting of a medley of mixed lines from the was made by 'Gos [Khug pa Lhas btsas] (ca. 1000-1060) in collaboration with the Indian Pandita *K�emankura (Bde ba'i myu gu, dates unknown). For an edition of the Tibetan text, see SAMDHONG & DWIVEDI (1988:285-306).

The unthinkable conduct (spyod lam bsam gyis mi khyab pa) is presented in terms of a series of meditative foci aimed at realizing \"equal taste\" (ro mnyam). The unthinkable manner of subsuming all phenomena [into one] (chos thams cad 'dus pa'i tshul bsam gyis mi khyab pa) is briefly explicated as consisting of non-attachment to sensory perceptions, non-conceptuality towards meditative presence, and non-mental­engagement towards bliss in the realization of the emptiness of the multiplicity [of percep­tions]. Finally, the [unthinkable] stages of climbing the levels (sa non pa'i rim pa) is presented via the structure of the four empowerments (dbang, *abhi�eka) intertwined with the fourteen bodhisattva levels (sa, *bhami) and the five paths (lam, *marga). The first expla­nation of the five aspects ends (DK.A.Za.1.3a4) by stating that the bodhisattva Vajrapal)i gave this instruction to *Acarya Dharmika (slob dpon chos kyi ba ). Thereup on, the text continues by presenting *Acarya Dharmika's realization of the same five headings and their various sub-points (DK.A.Za. l .3�-4a2), followed by explanations on the same points according to the realization of *Bhadrapada (bzang po zhabs) (DK.A.Za.1.4az-5a6), *Kuddalapada (tog rtse pa) (DK.A.Za.1.5a6-6a4), *Kambala (DK.A.Za.1.6a4-6b4), Tailopa (DK.A.Za.1.6b4-7b3), Naropa (DK.A.Za.1.7br8a6), and Mi la ras pa (DK.A.Za.1.8a6-9b1). 1017 The explanations given on the above points by these different Indian and Tibetan teachers cover a variety of Tantric topics, such as the four mudras, the inner channels, death, the interim, the yoga practice of Inner Heat, luminosity ('od gsal), and the buddha bodi es. Several of the explanations include quotation of verse lines, probably from the Acintyadvayakramopade§a but possibly also from other Indian Tantric texts. The treatise ends with the short printing colophon pertaining to the 1520 xylograph production.1018 1016 The verses include Acintyadvayakramopadefa verses 34d, 35a, some unidentified lines, 48ab, 58, some unidentified lines, 53cd, 59a, and 59b. Many of the lines differ slightly in their readings from the Bstan 'gyur editions of the Tibetan text and might even represent a different Tibetan trans­lation of the Sanskrit original altogether. 1017 Mi la ras pa's teacher Mar pa is mentioned in the text as having received the instruction from Naropa and having passed it on to Mi la ras pa. However, the text does not provide an explanation of the various points according to Mar pa's realization. 1018 For a translation, see the summary of segment DK.A.Ba.8."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"444 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 5.23 DK.A.

First, there is a homage verse paying respect to \"the venerable meditator of the Snyi clan\" (rje snyi bsgom), which is an epithet occasionally used for Bsod nams rin chen. The author then states that he has written (bri) this instruction on the root of his own mind (rang sems rtsa ba 'i man ngag) for the sake of later generations and that the instruction was originally taught by the realized (rtogs ldan) Bla ma Snyi bsgom to Shes rab byang chub, i.e., by Bsod nams rin chen to his younger nephew and later lineage holder. The instruction was then passed down in a transmission lineage (de nas brgyud nas), through which it reached the present author, who only refers to himself as \"I\" (bdag dang 'phrad). A short prose passage then instructs that the practitioner should at all times recognize awareness (shes pa) as being dhannakaya, characterized by an undistracted, clear and present awareness, which is unceasing. He should maintain this awareness in all daily activities. The segment ends by stating that this instruction on recognizing one's own mind as Mahfimudra is the teaching of Bla ma Lha rje snyi bsgom, i.e., Bsod nams rin chen.

The resultant understanding is described as Mahiimudrii and the method for realizing it is said to be the practice of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *samatha). Nonetheless, tranquility meditation does not suffice, since in and of itself it remains a cause for sa171siira ('khor ba'i rgyu). Hence, it needs to be combined with seeing the real nature (ngo bo mthong ba). The segment ends by stating that this instruction on introducing the immanent nature is the oral instruction of the bla ma.

It starts with a homage verse and by expressing the intention for writing the work. It then explains how the meditator should ascertain the nature of the mind at the beginning stage, in the middle, and at the end. Thereupon, it briefly mentions the teaching on the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajacittatii) being dharmakiiya (chos sk u), the co-emergent perceptions being the light of dharmakaya (chos sku'i 'ad), the co­emergent thoughts being the waves of dhannakiiya (chos sku 'i rlabs), and their co-emergent inseparability (dbyer med lhan cig skyes pa) being the real meaning of dharmakiiya (chos sku'i don). The segment then goes on to address how the bla ma's instruction points out the nature of awareness and how the yogi thereafter delves into meditative experience relying on the four yogas (rnal 'byor rnam bzhi) of Mahamudrii and accordingly ascertains the right view. Finally, the segment briefly presents the result ('bras bu, *phala) of Mahiimudrii. The concluding verse states that the author of the text was Bande Prajfiabodhi, i.e., the monk Shes rab byang chub, who was Bsod nams rin chen's younger nephew.

It ends (DK.A.'a. l l.6b4): ting nge 'dzin gyi rtsal sbyong ba 'o/ Ices gsung ngo//. 1029 The beginning of the segment bears some resemblance to segments Dk.A.Nga.4 and DK.A.Da.4. It starts by listing four conditions for creating a good practice of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *fomatha), viz. the bla ma's blessing, a fortunate circumstance, the gathering of merit, and purification of negative actions. Then it turns to describe the co-emergent knowledge (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes, *sahajajfiiina), which is said to exists forever as the natural mind (tha mal gyi shes pa, *prakrtajfiana). To recog­nize this nature, the practitioner is instructed to rest in the uncontrived (ma bcos pa, *akrtima), being a natural state wherein the nature of the mind neither arises, abides, or ceases. The practice is then laid out in terms of the view (lta ba), meditation (bsgom pa), and conduct (spyod pa). The resultant realization is presented with respect to the best (rab), the middling ('bring), and the lowest (tha ma) types of practitioners. The segment thereupon turns to describe two stages of higher experience. The first is when the nature is perceived and is ascertained (snang ba la nges pa), in which case it has become full realization. The second is when the nature is perceived without being [fully] ascertained (snang la ma nges pa), in which case it takes the form of the three meditative experiences of bliss (bde ba), presence (gsal ba), and non-thought (mi rtog pa). These experiences are here presented in some detail. The internal signs of accomplishing tranquility meditation (zhi gnas kyi nang rtags) are listed and briefly explained in the form of the five signs (rtags lnga), being comparable smoke (du ba !ta bu), a mirage (smig sgyu lta bu), fire-flies (srin bu me khyer !ta bu), a 1029 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.6a5-7b2, DK.B.'a. l 1.5b1-6h DK.D.'a. l 1.5b1-6b4, DK.Q.'a. l l.353b1-355b3 (folio numbers 354 and 355 have been applied to the same folio in the print), DK.R.'a.11.Sbrlla,, DK.S.'a.ll.8a5-10b3, DK.T.'a.11.5 b-6b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

It describes how the winds are made to enter the central channel (a wa dha tf, *avadhuti), which gives rise to the meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought. It is explained how the meditator should relate to these experiences in order to move beyond them and reach full realization.

The non-conceptual state that can be achieved in contemplative abiding is said not to be an ultimate goal, since such forms of non-conceptuality also are found in mundane states of unconsciousness (brgyal ba), intoxication (ra ro ba), and deep sleep (gnyid thug po). Instead, the meditator should strive for proper realization, which involves a sense of clarity and presence (gsal ba, *vyakti) and knowledge (rig pa, *vidyii). The attained knowledge, in turn, acts as a countermeasure against likes and dislikes (chags sdang).

It states that the experience of the original nature will not benefit the practitioner, unless he completely abandons attachment to this life. To counter this problem, the practitioner should concentrate on seeing all phenomena and sensory perceptions as being illusory and he should train himself in kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening. Thereupon, the segment presents three aspects of the original nature, namely its essence (ngo bo, *svabhava), its cause (rgyu, *hetu), and its result ('bras bu, zphala). It is notable that these explanations are related to the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo), which is said to be the cause for the original nature.

The saying also provides a series of analogies to illustrate the nature and procedure of a proper meditation practice. The segment has no colophon.

The second is to cut off the illness (nad tshar gcod pa) by contemplating how the phenomenon lacks any discernible features in terms of its origin and way of abiding.

The segment then divides all the teachings of the Buddha into two domains: those that pertain to conduct (spyod pa, *carya) and those that pertain to the view (!ta ba, *dn_ti). Conduct consists of various practices aimed at turning away from sar(lsara and cultivating the spiritual attitude of a bodhisattva, such as contemplating impermanence, meditating on actions and result, and engendering kindness, compassion and the resolve for Awakening.

This is the view that is cultivated in the Bka' gdams pa tradition and by all those who study philosophy (mtshan nyid pa thams cad). The view may also be that of the Secret Mantra (gsang sngags, *guhyamantra) as it is taught in the tradition of Mi la ras pa, namely according to the Mahiimudrii approach (phyag rgya chen po). The segment then lays out in some detail the Mahiimudrii attitude towards any thought, concept, or notion, namely an attitude of equanimity and non­conceptuality. When holding this view, thoughts should neither be seen as positive or negative and accordingly there is nothing to give up and nothing to accomplish. In the explanation thereof, the segment makes reference to the story of Tilopa and also employs several similes that in the canonical literature often are associated with teachings on the Buddha-nature. These are, for example, the simile of a treasure buried beneath the house of a destitute man or the simile of a pure universal monarch staying in an impure human womb prior before being born . The passage also paraphrases a longer saying attributed to the Indian master Rje btsun Khyi thul can (Kukkur1pa?). The segment then raises the question as to what difference there is between the way in which ordinary people pay no attention to their thoughts and how yogis (rnal 'byor pa) pay no attention to their thoughts. An extensive answer is given. Overall, the segment contains several shorter sayings attributed to \"the meditator of the Snyi family\" (snyi sgom), particularly in its final pages. The end of each saying is marked by the word \"said\" (gsung). Other sayings are attributed to Mi la ras pa and the *Bodhi­sattva (byang chub sems dpa), the latter probably referring to the Bka' gdams pa teacher under whom Bsod nams rin chen first studied meditation, namely *Aciirya Byang chub sems dpa'.1047 The segment ends with a colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"[This text is] called the key consisting in what I have noted down concerning my own meditative experience.\" Segment DK.A.Ya.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Ya.2.5b1): Ina mo c)ii ki ni ye! /rang gi sems la ma blta/.

It begins by citing two lines from the Ka dpe instruction text1050 outlining the three key points of the gtum mo instruction, viz. the bodily nature (dngos po'i gnas lugs), the path (lam), and the stages in which the result arises ('bras bu skye ba'i rim pa). Other lines from the Ka dpe text are cited throughout the segment as its root-text. The explanation on the bodily nature (dngos po'i gnas lugs, *mulaprakrti)1051 first covers in brief the way in which the body and its energies are formed during conception, the stages of the human embryo, culminating in birth. Thereupon, it lays out the bodily system of the channels (rtsa, *niidf), cakras ('khor lo), and winds (rlung, *viiyu). The explanation ends with quotations from an unnamed Tantra scripture and a song by Tilopa. The instruction on the path (lam, *miirga) explains how to use the body for practicing the yoga of Inner Heat (lus kyi gnad), the objects of visualization (yul gyi gnad), and the time (dus kyi gnad). The first of these points provides details on the concrete breathing techniques used in this yoga, including the four steps of taking in the breath, holding it, exhaling, and expelling the remainder of air like shooting an arrow. The second point lays out the steps of the visualization. The third point explains how to focus on various yogas pertaining to different cakras during certain phases of the day, particularly with regard to sleeping, dreaming, and being awake.

The first part presents the four stages of dying through which the four physical elements dissolve into one another, whereby sensory perceptions cease one by one. After the breathing has stopped and the wind element has dissolved into consciousness, three inner phases follow, which are referred to as light (snang ba, *iiloka), rising (mched pa, *vrddhi), and arrival (thob pa, *labdha). At the end of this process, the true nature of the mind, Mahiimudrii, reveals itself. If, however, the consciousness is unable to remain therein, the deceased person exits the Mahiimud rii state and enters instead into the interim (bar do, *antariibhava) of the illusory body (sgyu !us, *miiyiideha). Here a good practitioner may be able to perceive the impure illusory body (ma dag pa'i sgyu !us) experienced in the interim as the body of the deity (lha'i sku). If the meditator thereby delves fully into radiance ('od gsal, *prabhiisvara), all karmic seeds will be purified, and he or she will attain buddhahood right there and then. If unable to do so, the deceased person will proceed through the interim to the site of rebirth, where the practitioner must utilize the instruction on blocking the entry into the womb of rebirth (mngal sgo dgal ha), which is briefly explained. The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"The venerable Dags po rin po che's instruction on the Interim free of corruptions was taught by Master Dags po sgom chung to Master Stod lungs pa.\" The text's colophon is followed by the brief printer's colophon of the 1520 xylograph edition. 5.25 DK.A.Ra: Sayings of the Dharma Master, the Doctor from Dags po: A Treasury of Ultimate Identifications of the Heart Essence (Chos rj e dags po lha rj e 'i gsung/ snying po 'i ngo sprod don dam gter mdzod gzhugso) 12 folios, 13 segments, five colophons.

He then lays out a series of explanations in prose, which are said to be \"sayings of the precious bodhisattva\" (byang chub sems dpa' rin po che'i gsung). He tells that everything outer and inner is the co-emergent nature (lhan cig skyes, *sahaja). This nature exists within all that may be experienced, whether belonging to sm?Zsiira or to nirv<lJJa. The practitioner should rest in the state of the inborn (gnyug ma, *nija) while not entertaining any thought about the past, the present, or the future, since time within the inborn nature (gnyug ma'i ngo bo) is invariably singular and undivided (cig go). The deep realization that there exists no actual difference between the past, the present, and the future is called Mahiimudrii. This point in then laid out in the form of a metaphori­cal interpretation of each of the three morphemes found in the Tibetan word for Mahiimudrii (i.e., phyag, rgya, and chen po). The text carries on with a series of verses that describe how the yogf should rest in the inborn nature. In this state, any negative emotion that may arise -whether anger, desire, stupidity, jealousy, or pride -becomes naturally purified in emptiness (stong pa, *sanya). The meditation (bsam gtan, *dhyiina) is likened to a stream of awareness, flowing steadily like a river (chu bo klong). The right manner of resting in such meditation is presented at some length in the remaining verses of the passage.

The title is not attested in the older handwritten manuscript (DK.a). The segment is a Mahiimudrii poem in 34 verse-lines. Most lines consist of seven sylla­bles, while a few verses have more syllables. The poem describes Mahiimudrii as a nature of liberated self-awareness that is present within every sentient being. This Awakened awareness subsumes all the stages and fruits of the path. It is beyond the intellect. It is the intended meaning of the Buddha's teachings. It is unborn, non-dual, inexpressible, the dhannakiiya, of a single flavor, and without center or periphery. It is learnt from the bla ma,who teaches that one's own mind is simply buddha. The yogi, who sees this, realizes the co­emergent nature (sahaja) in everything and everyone. The segment has no colophon.

The title is not attested in the older handwritten manuscript DK.a. Following the title, the segment opens by stating that this is the Mahiimudrii instruction on Descending from Above (thog bahs), whose broader context was discussed in the summary of text DK.A.Wa. To begin with, five misunderstandings (log par rtog pa lnga) maintained by opponents (phyogs snga ma) are dispelled. The first is a misunderstanding about the nature, namely to think that the present mind must first be given up before Awakened knowledge (ye shes, *jiiiina) can be realized. It is retorted to this opinion that in the tradition of this instruction (gdam ngag 'di'i lugs) the root of all phenomena is the mind and there consequently is no mind to remove. The second is a misunderstanding of the object, namely the opinion that the practitioner should abandon the five mental poisons. To this it is answered that in the tradition of this instruction the five poisons are not to be abandoned but they are to be utilized as part of the path. The third is a misunderstanding about time, namely the belief that it takes three countless aeons to realize the path (as generally taught in the Common Mahayana). However, in the tradition of this instruction, realization is said to occur right here and now. The fourth is a misunderstanding about insight, namely that realization 1054 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.37a4-38b4, DK.B.Ra.2.3ar5a1, DK.D.Ra.2.3a6-5a1, DK.Q.Ra.2.369br370a6, DK.R.Ra.2.4a6-7a3, DK.S.Ra.2.4br 7b2, DK.T.Ra.2.3n-5n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

In this tradition, it is instead maintained that realization occurs through the instruction itself. Finally, the fifth mis understanding is to see a non-existent separation between buddhas and sentient beings, thinking that they respec­tively are good and bad. However, in the present tradition, the only difference between them is whether or not realization has occurred. Thereupon, the segment imparts the actual instruction on Descending from Above in three parts. The first is the right skill in starting up the meditation at the beginning of the session (dang po sgom pa'i mgo rtsom pa la mkhas pa). The meditator must know how to sit in the Vairocana meditation posture. He should then enter into the meditative state by looking directly at the nature of the mind in an effortless manner, thereby engendering experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought. This is to descend into the meditation from above (thog bahs). A detailed instruction in four points on identifying the deluded mind (sems 'khrul pa ngos bzung ba) is given here concerning the object to be viewed (lta ba'i yul), the method of viewing (!ta thabs), the extend of seeing (mthong tshad), and the manner of seeing (mthong lugs). In brief, the instruction is concerned with how to relate to thoughts that arise during the meditation. The second part of the actual instruction deals with how to develop skill in stabilizing the meditative experience (bar du nyams brten pa la mkhas pa). It is here taught how to dissolve mental restlessness and drowsiness. The third part presents how to develop skill in ending the meditation (tha ma 'phro bcod pa la mkhas pa), namely to keep the meditation sessions sufficiently short to maintain full mental clarity . The segment ends with the colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"Included are the [mne­monic] knots for counting the Mahiimudra.\" The colophon suggests that the text existed in the form of knots tied on strings (rgya mdud), which was a medieval Tibetan mnemonic device that served as a memory aid. The expression \"counting\" (rtsis) probably denotes the act of remembering the three overall parts of the instruction along with the various sub­points of each. The mention of mnemonic knots may either be taken literally to imply that a set of such strings originally accompanied (bcas pa) the written text and was handed over to the student, or it may figuratively mean that the points of the written text are comparable to mnemonic knots in the sense that they jog the memory of the practitioner regarding key points of the instruction.

The first set of three is called \"the three Dharmas for realizing the co-emergent\" (de ltar rtogs par byed pa'i chos gsum). This is the instruction which says: (1) From a base that is nothing in itself, a multiplicity arises; (2) although it appears as a multiplicity, these perceptions are not real objects; and (3) when this has been realized, there is no way of expressing in words whether the base and its multiplicity are identical or different. The second threefold set is the three Dharmas (chos gsum) for turning the realization into experience (rtogs par byed pa la nyams su !en). Here it is described how to relax the body and mind by relinquishing all effort at the outset of the session, how to be free from doubt by resting in a non-artificial state during the session, and how to regard all ideas about experiences and percepti ons as unborn at the conclusion of the session. The third set of three is a teaching on how to consolidate (mtha' rten gyi gdam ngag) the bla ma's instruction. Such consolidation is first accomplished by understanding that the co­emergent nature exists within each and every sentient being and that it therefore does not need to be sought from anyone else. Secondly, the practitioner needs to understand that the highest happiness, free from all suffering, the dhannakiiya, is nothing but the mind itself and that it does not exist externally. Finally, since everything is purely mind, the practi­tioner realizes that there is absolutely nothing to fear. The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"The instruction pointing out Mahiimudrii - if hi.\" The expression if hi is a common segment marker (especially in the handwritten manuscript Dk.a) and possibly a signal imposing secrecy on the instruction.

The segment starts with a title heading (cited in Tibetan above) saying: \"Here is [the text] entitled Firmly Establishing the Dharmakiiya.\" The seg­ment identifies dhannakiiya with the clear and present awareness that is found directly within the person who hears the instruction. It advices the practitioner not to regard some attempts to meditate on this nature as being successful and other attempts as being unsuc-1057 Similar instructions on these two terms are found elsewhere in the corpus; see segments DK.A.Nga.9, DK.A.Cha.18, DK.A.Nya.10, DK.A.Tha.38, DK.A.Dza.1, and DK.A.Wa.3. 1058 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.40a3.6, DK.B.Ra.5.6b1.4, DK.D.Ra.5.6b2.s, DK.Q.Ra.5.372b6-373a2, DK.R.Ra.5.10a1-6, DK.S.Ra.5.10a5-10b4, DK.T.Ra.5.6b, Phyag chen mdwd vol.

It ends with the colophon (DK.A.Ra.6.7a2): /rje rin po che'i !ta sgom spyod 'bras kyi gdam pal 'ol ka'i yon bdag mo la gsungs pa'o//.1059 The segment opens with a rare sentence giving a brief historical context for the saying. The saying is said to have been spoken by the Ela ma Dags po Snyi sgom, \"the meditator of the Snyi family in Dags po,\" i.e., Bsod nams rin chen. It is stated that he gave the teaching when a female supporter or sponsor (yon bdag mo) from the '01 ka region (also spelled '01 kha) ('ol ka'i yon bdag mo cig) wanted to learn to meditate (sgom 'dod nas). The mention of a female practitioner is significant from a gender perspective, given that very few women are mentioned in the corpus itself an d in the associated hagiographies of Bsod nams rin chen and his students. The teaching begins by mentioning the right bodhicitta motivation of wishing to reach Awakening for the benefit of sentient beings. The core instruction (gdam ngag, *avavada) is to let the mind rest in its natural state (se1ns rang sor 'jog pa). The manner of resting ('jog lugs) is to rest without making any judgments (ngos bzung med par 'jog), to remain indefinable like space, to rest free of waves like a languid river, to rest shiningly like an unflickering oil lamp or candle. When the mind rests in such a manner within its natural state while be being fully aware of its own nature, this is called realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha). The manner in which the mind is realized (rtogs lugs) is explained next, saying that the mind is understood neither to have a beginning (skye ba med pa), an end ('gag pa med pa), nor involving any mode of remaining (gnas pa med pa). When this is realized, the mind becomes free from all extremes (mtha' bral) and gains an outlook as broad as space. The meditative experience (nyams myong) is one of non-grasping (bzung du med pa), a meditation of clarity and bliss comparable to the sun and the moon. The spiritual conduct should consist in simply letting all thoughts and perceptions emerge as dharmakaya itself and the final outcome of such inner experience is nothing short of buddhahood. The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"The precious master's instruction on the view, the meditation, the conduct, and the result spoken to a female supporter from '01 ka.\" Segment DK.A.Ra.7: The segment begins (DK.A.Ra.7.7a2): !dus gsum dbyer med kyi gdams pa lags sol/ /Ina mo gu ru/ rin po che sgam po pa'i zhal nas/.

It is then explained how the meditator should deal with thoughts that are concerned with the past, the present, or the future. The past leaves no trace, the future is unrealized, and the present should not be taken as a focal object of thought. Instead, the meditator should rest in a present, vivid awareness, which is like the center of the pure sky, the natural state. From this res tful state, the practitioner is advised to enter into a meditative stream of awareness, a constant stream compared to the tip of a flame or the flow of a river that carries on and on yet never remains the same. This state of transient awareness is referred to as \"the river stream yoga\" (chu bo rgyun gyi rnal 'byor). From within this awareness stream, the practitioner should then focus on the nature of awareness by directing attention to the mind's appearance (ngo bo, *bhiiva), nature (rang bzhin, *svabhiiva), and character (mtshan nyid, *lak�wia). The segment briefly elaborates on these three aspects of the mind. There is no colophon.

It ends (DK.A.Ra.8.8a2): de las med/ slang la bsgoms shig/!.1061 The segment starts with a title: \"Here is an Introduction [to the Nature of the Mind] Spoken by Dags po Sgom chung.\" The title thus ascribes the saying to Bsod nams rin chen's younger nephew. Following the title, the segment itself accordingly opens by stating, \"Rin po che Sgom chung said ... \" The actual wording of the saying is very remiscient of segment DK.A.Ra. 7. The pointing out instruction or 'encounter' (ngo sprod) first mentions the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa) and the co-emergent experiences (snang ba lhan cig skyes pa). It then says that the division between buddha and Sa7?1Siira is a matter of whether or not the knowledge nature of the mind (sems rig pa 'i ngo bo) has been realized. Then follows an explanation on how the meditator should rest in the present awareness without following thoughts pertaining to the past, the present, or the future. Thereby, the meditator will perceive that the mind is vivid and present yet not expressible in thoughts (gsal la rtog pa med pa). When attempting to rest therein, the practitioner should neither see it as an achievement when he or she is able to remain in this state for a longer time, nor consider it a failure when only able to do so for a short time. Rather, whenever thoughts arise, the practitioner should simply relax deeply, thereby allowing the thoughts to subside by themselves. Relaxation and meditation should thus go hand in hand.

The teaching found in the segment presents how the most talented practitioners of the highest capacity (dbang po rab) are able to realize Mahiimudrii by relying on just three points (don mam pa gsum). The first point is called the Mahiimudrii of the cause (rgyu'i phyag rgya chen po), referring to the nature [of the mind] (rang bzhin, *svabhiiva), which makes the practitioner understand the basis (gzhi, *adhi�_thiina). The second point is called the Mahiimudrii of the path (lam gyi phyag rgya chen po), 1063 dealing with meditation (sgom pa, *bhiivanii) and the methods for practicing the path. The third point is the spontaneously accomplished result (lliun gyis grub pa'i 'bras bu). Having laid out these three points, the segment then moves into a detailed presentation of the Mahiimudra of the path. It is said that to begin with the practitioner searches for an experience -or literally \"a taste\" (ro, *r asa) -of Mahiimudrii by relying on indicatory instructi ons (brda'i gdam ngag) from the bla ma. Thereupon, the practitioner enters into the actual nature of the mind as such (sems nyid rnal ma) by meditating on the nature of radiance which is non-duality (gnyis med 'od gsal). In the final stages of the path, the practitioner transcends conceptuality (rnam pa rtog pa, *vikal pa) by relying on the yoga of non-cognition (yid la mi byed pa'i rnal 'byor, *amanasikiirayoga). The various ways in which the practitioner obtains a taste of Mahiimudrii through the indicatory instructions of the bla ma are then discussed in more detail. The term bla ma may here denote the lineage bla mas (brgyud pa'i bla ma) or the actual bla ma (dngos kyi bla ma). The expression \"lineage bla mas,\" on the one hand, is said to refer to the unborn nature of thought that is introduced to the student through the empowerment ritual (dbang, *abhi�eka). The segment here briefly explains how different ritual steps in successively deeper ways point to the true nature of thoughts. The actual bla ma, on the other hand, guides the student through a series of meditative processes of recognizing the nature of the mind (sems ma zin pa zin par byed pa), stabilizing what has been recognized (zin pa brtan 1062 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.42a1-43b2, DK.B.Ra.9.8ar9b5, DK.D.Ra.9.8a3-9bs, DK.Q.Ra.9.374ar375b1, DK.R.Ra.9.12bs-15b6, DK.S.Ra.9. l 3as-l 6b1, DK.T.Ra.9.8n-9b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

To begin with, the student observes with intense focus the reflection of a steady flame of a candle in a spotless mirror. Once the mind has become able to rest with complete absorption on this outer focus, then the visual image and the sensation of seeing the flame are transported into the meditator's own heart center and the meditative focus is transferred to this locus. The meditator should then train in letting the mind rest on this focus, while avoiding drowsiness by taking frequent breaks and avoiding mental agitation by relaxing deeply. Gradually, a meditative flow will be achieved, which is comparable to the flow of a river or the fine tip of a flame. When this has been accomplished, the meditator should begin stabilize the meditation by focusing on the non-conceptual nature of the experience. Thoughts cannot describe the nature of awareness, yet the non-conceptual awareness thereof is radiant and unceasing, and there really exists no actual difference between the awareness and the absence of concep­tual proliferation. These three points are referred to by the term \"the radiance of things as such\" (chos nyid 'od gsal), \"the radiance of the mind as such\" (sems nyid 'od gsal), and \"the radiance of non-duality \" (gnyis med 'od gsal). The meditator goes effortlessly through these steps, letting the mind of the radiance of non-duality rest in itself (gnyis med 'od gsal gyi sems rang ma! du bzhug pa). Thereby, the meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought begin to arise and the meditator applies these experiences to any mental or bodily sensation and sensory perception that emerges. The yogf mixes bliss, presence, and non-thought with all that appears. The bliss that is spoken of here is said to be quite different from the feeling of satiation that comes from having eaten a good meal. Instead, it is an unbinding great bliss (zag pa med pa'i bde ba chen po, *aniisravo mahiinanda(i). It is compared to how the sky becomes free from all mist when the radiance of the sun emerges at dawn. Just as the sky is not definable in and of itself, the nature of these experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought are indefinable (dngos bzung med pa). Moreover, just like wind and clouds arise out of the sky and disappear back into the sky again, in the same manner thoughts arise out of the mind and disappear back into the mind again, but the mind itself remains just the same all the while. Thus, the meditator turns all thoughts, feelings, and perceptions into meditative experiences characterized by bliss, presence, and non­conceptuality, and that is how the meditation experience is stabilized. In fact, this achieve­ment is the actual bla ma, because the bla ma is here said to be the mind itself. The explanation is rounded off with two short quotations from the Hevajratantra and the Sampufatantra. The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"The Instruc­tion on Mahiimudrii Meditation.\" Segment DK.A.Ra.10: The segment begins (DK.A.Ra.10.9b5): //dga' gdung ro snyoms kyi man ngag bzhugs s'ho// //b la ma dam pa rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ /gang zhig nyams su Zen par 'dad pas!.

The instruction is said to pertain to feelings of happiness (dga' ba) and unhappiness (mi dga' ba), pleasant and unpleasant things heard (snyan mi snyan), and attractive and unattractive things seen (gzugs sdug mi sdug). Whatever thought arises, the yogi must realize that the thought has merely arisen from the mind itself and that the mind in actuality is empty of any defining characteristic. The power (rtsal, *vyavasaya) of the mind to unfold a variety of experiences is endless. When the yogi has realized that everything just comes down to this, then he has become a buddha. As long as this has not been understood, he remains in sm!isara. When this power emerges as knowledge (rig pa, *vidya), it is dharmakaya. When it appears as ignorance (ma rig pa, *avidya), it is the sm_nsaric mind (sems can, *sattva). On the stage between these two, namely the stage of being a practitioner (rnal 'byor pa, *yogin), the power emerges as realization and meditative experiences (rtogs pa dang nyams). There are some who say that the practi tioner should look at the unborn realization (skye med rtogs pa la lta ba byed), meditate in the state of the unborn (skye med kyi ngang la sgom pa byed), and realize the result within the stability of the unborn (skye med brtan pa la 'bras bu byed). The segment criticizes such a view by arguing in some detail that this view not only essentializes the unborn but also reifies ignorance and sm!isiira, thereby rendering it logically impossible to reach buddhahood. A series of similes are here presented and further philosophical debate follows in the ensuing piece regarding how to view the unborn (skye med, *anutpanna) and non-conceptuality (rtog med, *nirvikalpa). This part of the segment has a distinctly more scholastic character than other parts of text DK.A.Ra. In the end, the teaching concludes that all notions of likes and dislikes have to be abandoned; the practitioner should neither entertain hope for buddhahood, assert any phenomenon to exist, nor fear sm71sara. Nonetheless, he or she must avoid even the slightest harmful action. Even though the yogi recognizes his own mind as being Buddha, he must still carry the bla ma over his head. Even though he sees that there is no difference between self and other, the stream of compassion should never cease. The root of all Tantric observances (dam tshig, *samaya) is the unborn.

The saying gives an explanation on the nature of conceptuality or thought (rnam rtog, *vikalpa). It is said that all phenomena (chos thams cad, *sarvadhannii(1) are thoughts (rnam rtog, *vikal pa), because without thought nothing could appear. Thoughts, in turn, are the mind (sems, *citta) and the mind is unborn (skye med, *anutpanna). The unborn is emptiness (stong nyid, *sunyatii). Things as such (chos nyid, *dhannatii) are not anything whatsoever, yet they nonetheless appear as a variety or a multiplicity (sna tshog, *vicitra). When they appear so, they still do not constitute any object whatsoever. The meaning of this is the inseparability of the twofold truth (bden pa gnyis dbyer med, *avinirbhiiga­dvayasatya) and when that is realized, it is the right view (lta ba, *darfana). To remain within this is the meditation (sgom pa, *bhiivanii). To sever the bond of proudly thinking in terms of hope and fear is the result ('bras bu, >rphala). The segment has no colophon.

The first is the encounter with perceptions as being mind (snang ba sems su ngo sprad), at which point all attachment to outer objects disappears. The second is the encounter with the mind as being empty (seJns stong par ngo sprad), at which point a realization arises which sees that mind has no basis or root. The third is the encounter with emptiness as being radiance (stong pa 'od gsal du ngo sprad), at which point it is under­stood that the mind really never wanders outside of radiance. The fourth is the encounter with radiance as being union ('od gsal zung 'jug du ngo sprad), at which point sensory perceptions turn into helpers on the path. The fifth is the encounter with union as being great bliss (zung 'jug bde ba chen por ngo sprad), which is said to feel like throwing a spear into directionless space. These five introductions or encounters give rise to three meditative experiences (nyams, *anubhiiva). The first is an experience of being like a sphere of light ('od kyi gong bu). The second is an experience of being like clear transparent jewel. The third is an experience of being like space without center or limit. Also, three types of heat (drod tshad, *u�man) arise. These include external heat in which the body no longer is felt, internal heat in which the movement of the breath no longer is felt, and secret heat wherein the flow of thought entirely falls away. The signs of having stabilized the mind are that all activities cease and the yogfno longer can be hurt by sensory perceptions (snang ba, *avabhiisa).

The saying opens with a question, \"Is there any contradiction between meditation on a deity and [meditating on] emptiness?\" The answer given is that if the yogfbecomes proficient in meditating on a deity during this life time, then the nature of the mind will automatically appear at the time of death in the form of the deity. To prevent conceptual clinging to the visualization which reifies it, it is necessary to seal the deity practi ce with emptiness (stong nyid du rgyas gdab). The visualization should be viewed as empty yet radiant. When there is no tendency to take the features of the visualization as being real, the visualization emerges as emptiness with a nature of compassion (stong nyid snying rj e'i bdag nyid can). The stream of such meditative experience is unbinding bliss, the dhannakaya. The saying finally declares that this is the practice to be employed at the time of death ('chi ka'i nyams Zen).

Text DK.A.La is an amalgam of Common Mahayana, Vajrayana, and Mahiimudra teachings. A considerable portion of the text deals with dis­cussing differences between the Bka' gdams pa tradition, the Vajrayana approach repre­sented especially by the teachings of Mi la ras pa, and Bsod nams rin chen's Mahamudra doctrine. In the course of these discussions, the segment also imparts instructions pertinent to each of these traditions. The text, moreover, includes two segments dealing with the Stages of the Path (lam rim). The first of these is entitled \"A Summary of the Stages of the Path\" (Lam rim mdor bsdus) , which relies loosely on Atifa's text Bodhipathapradfpa (Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma) in explaining the spiritual approaches to be used by the so­called three types of persons (skyes bu gsum). The other lam rim segment is entitled \"The Essence of the Stages of the Path\" (Lam rim snying po). The text further contains segments dealing purely with Mahamudra and Vajrayana practices.

Thearrangement of the materials, however, differs considerably between the three segments. The first segment opens with a twofold instruction said to have come from the teacher ofDge bshes Lcags ri ba (dge bshes lcags ri ba'i bla ma).1069 The instruction is: \"Have nohope for buddhahood above, for it is found in your own body, speech, and mind. Have nofear for sa-rr1siira below, for -without there being any need to abandon it -it is the fuel for insight.\" Having presented this saying, the segment goes on by stating that when a greatmeditator (sgom chen pa) meditates on this teaching, concepts or thoughts (rnam par rtog pa, *vikalpa) will arise and there are three ways of dealing with them. Some thoughts are quelled as soon as they are encountered (phrad 'jams pa) by understanding that they are unborn in nature. Other thoughts must subsequently be pursued (phyi bsnyag) in order todissolve them by analyzing their source, namely by seeing that they have arisen from themind, that they disappear back into the mind, and that they really are no different from themind. Finally, some thoughts have to be entertained in spite of being non-existent, forexample the serious concern that a monk should uphold to observe his four root vows;nevertheless, the meditator should still regard those thoughts as being mind and the mind asbeing unborn. Having explained these three approaches to handling thoughts in the meditation, the segment uses three similes to illustrate how thoughts are useful to the meditator in that they constitute the fuel for insight. One simile is how the wood of a forest fuels a bush fire. The second simile is how snow falling on a lake immediately dissolves and is absorbed into the water with no difference in nature. Finally, when the adept meditator has thoroughly learned to recognize the nature of thought, this is compared to meeting an old acquaince who requires no introduction. It is said that this was an explanation given by Dge bshes Lcags ri ba. Next, the segment presents an explanation on thoughts given by Bla ma Mi la. He said that thoughts are necessary, full of kindness, and that the yogf cannot be without them. In fact, all positive qualities are intrinsically found right within them.

If read in this fashion, it would mean that Dge bshes Lcags ri ba metaphorically regarded this particular instruction to be his guru and in that case there would be no indication that the instruction specifically stemmed from Spyan snga ba Tshul 'khrims 'bar.

The visualization must then be combined with the insight of understanding that the mm;,rj,ala and the deity are not established with any real, independent nature. The student suited for such practice must be ritually matured by receiving empowerment from a bla ma who possesses realization. First then should the student employ the liberating methods of the practice. The Generation Stage here refers to meditating on the illusion-like body of the deity and is said to include the part of the Completion Stage known as \"the Completion Stage involving Elaborations\" (spros pa dang bcas pa'i rdzogs rim).1075 The Completion Stage proper is the direct perception of radiance and the empty aspect of the mind ( 'od gsal sems kyi stong nyid). 1073 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.27b6-30a6, DK.B.La.2.3bs-6a6, DK.D.La.2.3bs-6a6, DK.Q.La.2.38 la,-384a6, DK.R.La.2.5a3-9b2, DK.S.La.2.5a5-10a2, DK.T.La.2.3b-6n, Phyag chen mdzadvol.

In short, these the inner practices associated with the second and third empowerment cycles of the"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 471 When the meditator practices the Generation and Completion Stages successfully in this manner, results will arise, particular when the practices are performed in the solitude (dben pa) of a prolonged meditation retreat. Primarily, the experiences are bodily bliss (lus bde ba) and mental bliss (sems bde ba). Inwardly, the five signs (rtags rnam Inga) appear, while externally the eight benefits (phan yon brgyad) manifest.107 6 The segment then provides a short explanation on the meditative experiences that are associated with each of the five signs. When the first sign called \"smoke-like\" (du ba lta bu) has appeared, the vital energies or 'winds' (rlung) are arrested and enter into the central channel. With the second sign, there is an experience of light or splendor (snang ba, *aloka). With the third sign, the experiences of presence and non-thought (gsal la mi rtog) arise. This level is the culmination of meditation, at which points the winds have entered the mind (rlung sems su tshud pa). With the fourth sign, the meaning of the view is realized and the four types of Awakened activity ('phrin las) are accomplished. Finally, the sign of knowledge (ye shes kyi rtags) appears when the winds have entered radiance (rlung 'od gsal du tshud pa). At this most advanced stage, the body appears like a rainbow or a sphere of light. Thereupon, the segment turns to discussing various troublemakers (bdud, *mara) that may appear to the practitioner externally in human or non-human form or internally in the form of thoughts. It teaches three methods for dispelling these. The methods include meditating on kindness and compassion, meditating on the empty nature of the obstacles, and seeing them as manifestations of delusion, i.e., projections of the practitioner's own mind. It is here also discussed whether or not wealth and followers constitute spiritual ob­stacles. At this point, the parallel passage shared with segments DK.A.Nga.4 and DK.A.Nga.5 ends. The segment then enters into a short explanation of three triads of Mahiimudra terms, namely the three aspects of being \"natural\" (so ma), \"innately happy\" (rang dga') , and \"at ease\" (lhug pa). The same three triads are explained elsewhere in the corpus in nearly the same words;1077 in some of those passages, the middle term \"innately happy\" (rang dga') is replaced with the terms \"uncontrived\" (ma bcos pa) or \"unfeigned\" (rang thang). The remainder of the segment is concerned with presenting the Secret Mantra path (gsang sngags, *guhyamantra) according to the Bka' gdams pa tradition. First, it is stated that the Bka' gdams pas are not in the habit of teaching the Secret Mantra path in its entirety from the outset but that they employ a gradual approach. A series of sayings by Bka' gdams pa teachers dealing with Secret Mantra teachings are then given. The first Bka' gdams pa teacher cited is Dge bshes Lcags ri ba, whose statement makes references to Naropa and the Bia ma [Mi la ras pa?]. His opinion is followed by the views of Dge bshes Rgya Yon bdag and the precious one (rin po che) (possibly denoting Bsod nams rin chen), tantras. The Completion Stage without Elaboration is the Mahamudrii practice, which in the Tantric system is associated with the fourth empowerment. 1076 For the five signs, see GRAY (2007:220-221) and MULLIN (2005: 157-1 58). 1077 See segments DK.A.Cha.15, DK.A.Dza.13, DK.A.Dza.14, DK.A.Za.l, and DK.A.Wa.4."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"472 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum whose statements refer to the views of the Ela ma (Mi la ras pa?), Dge bshes Po to ba, Dge bshes Phu chung ba, and Dge bshes Spyan snga ba.

With this in mind, the practitioner should take refuge (skyabs 'tshol) in the teacher (bla ma) and the three jewels (dkon mchog gsum). Even the slightest negative action must be avoided, since such actions are the very causes for rebirth in the lower realms. Conversely, the practitioner should engage in beneficial actions, since those are the actions that lead to good rebirths. Finally, to turn away from this life, the practitioner should take the temporary one-day vows of fasting and renunciation (bsnyan gnas, *upavasa) or the (life-long) vows of a lay-practi­tioner (dge bsnyen, *upasaka). This constitutes the path for the small person (skyes bu chung ngu), which leads to liberation from rebirth in the lower realms. However -the segment says -this path does not suffice, because lasting happiness cannot be found merely by obtaining rebirth in the higher realms of sm71sara. Therefore, it is recommended to contemplate the overall shortcomings of sm71sara ('khor ba'i nyes dmigs,*sa171saradfnava) and the impermanence (mi rtag pa, *anitya) of everything. The practi­tioner needs to cultivate non-attachment to all that is associated with the present life, such as friends, family, wealth, and the body and thereby attain the Awakening of a fravaka practitioner. This is the fravaka path for the middling person (skyes bu 'bring), which brings personal benefit. Still -the segment declares -this path as well does not suffice, because other sentient beings, who have been one's parents (pha ma) in former lives, remain stuck in sm71sara with all its suffering. Accordingly, the practitioner of the highest capacity (skyes bu mchog) needs to develop friendless and compassion (byams snying rje). He or she needs to turn away from the lower vehicles (theg dman, *hrnayana) and instead give rise to the Mahayana motivation of the relative and ultimate resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta). This will lead to higher meditative experiences and realization, culminating in the attainment of full Awakening. The practitioner must not remain limited to the meditative states of the desire realm ('dod khams, *kamadhiitu), the form realm 1078 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.30a6-32a3, DK.B.La.3.6a6-8a2, DK.D.La.3.6a6-8a4, DK.Q.La.3.384�-385h DK.R.La.3.9brl2bi, DK.S.La.3.10ar l3a3, DK.T.La.3.6n-8n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Like pouring water into water or mixing butter with butter, the mind should be made to rest in itself in its natural state (so ma), with ease (!hug pa), in and of itself (rang ga). The progressive stages meditative attainment are here presented in some detail through the scheme of the four yogas of Mahiimudrii known as the yoga of one-pointedness (rtse gcig gi rnal 'byor ), the yoga of being free from conceptual proliferation (spros bra! gyi rnal 'byor), the yoga of one taste (ro gcig gi rnal 'byor), and the yoga of being meditation-less (sgom med kyi rnal 'byor). Although the yogf has achieved such great attainment, bodily unease may still arise as long as the yogf remains alive and has a physical body. This point is illustrated with two similes of a lion cub still dwelling in the womb of its mother and a still unhatched garU<;la fledgling within the egg.1079 Full Buddhahood first occurs once the body has died and the accomplished practitioner enters the first interim (bar do dang po) wherein dhannakiiya appears.

Its view of emptiness accords with that of the Madhyamaka position, but the Secret Mantra tradition adds the realization of the bliss of emptiness (stong pa'i bde ba) to this Madhyamaka view. Further, its view of mind being self-aware and self-clear (rang rig rang gsal) accords with that of the Cittamiitra position, but to this is likewise added the flavor of bliss (ro bde ba) to the experience of presence (gsal). Hence, the Secret Mantra view is characterized by the union (zung 'jug, *yuganaddha) of clarity appearing as emptiness (gsal ba nyid stong pa) and emptiness appearing as clarity (stong pa nyid gsal ba). Following this introductory explanation, the segment moves into a deeper analysis of the similarities and differences between the views of the Secret Mantra tradition and those of 1079 This passage on the lion cub and the garutja fledgeling have been translated and analyzed by David P. JACKSON (1992:101) in a broader study of these similes and their origin in Indian siitras and Tibetan Rdzogs chen texts. JACKSON concludes (op.cit.:102): \"Thus there does seem to be a Rdzogs-chen influence in some of sGam-po-pa's writings on certain doctrinal points, which is reflected by his use of the animal images. But he by no means adopted the earlier system wholesale or accepted it in the most radical forms known to him.\" 108° Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.32a3-33a6, DK.B.La.4.8a3-9bi, DK.D.La.4.8a.-9b2, DK.Q.La.4.386a1-387a., DK.R.La.4.12b1-14b2, DK.S.La.4.13a3-15b2, DK.T.La.4.8n-9b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Particular attention is given to the relationship between the images of sensory perception (dkar dmar gyi rnam pa, *citriikiira), objects (yul, *artha), phenomena (chos can, *dharmin), and their nature (clws nyid, *dhannatii). The relationships in question are investigated in terms of the meditative experiences to be had during the practice of Secret Mantra. The explanations given are then related to presenting the characteristics of the mind (sems kyi mtshan nyid, *cittalak�m:w) and the characteristics of knowledge (rig pa'i mtsh an nyid, *vid yiilak�a!ia). It is concluded that at the highest stage there is neither a meditator, something to be meditated upon, nor an act of meditating. There is merely a stream of knowledge (rig pa, *vidyii), which is present, knowing, unceasing, and uninterrupted. This nature cannot be comprehensibly illustrated by any verbal expression, whether by calling it 'present', 'blissful', or 'non-conceptual'. The yogi simply has to let the meditation remain non-fabricated (bcas bcos ma byed) and let experience rest in itself (rang gar zhog). The segment has no colophon.

The final segment of the text lays out in brief the major stages of the path (lam rim). The first step consists in contemplating death, impermanence, the cause and effect of actions, and the shortcomings of sa17isiira. These contemplations tum the mind away from the affairs of this life and instill in the yogi a firm intention to practice the Dharma. Having received instruction from a genuine bla ma, the practitioner cultivates the attitudes of kind­ness, compassion , and the resolve for Awakening, whereby all activities and undertakings come to be performed for the general benefit of sentient beings. It is these motivations that in the future will give rise to manifesting the form-kiiyas of a Buddha (gzugs sku, *nlpa­kiiya), while it is the yogi's realization of dha rmakiiya that will bring personal liberation (thar pa, *mok�a). To achieve such realization, it is first necessary to rely with faith, conviction, and devo­tion on a bla ma who has already attained this result. It is such faith that produces blessing (byin rlabs, *adhi�,thiina). The teachings to be obtained are the instructions on how to contemplate death and impermanence, the cause and effect of action, and the shortcomings and sufferings of sal?isiira, which turn the mind away from this life. The sufferings experienced in various forms of SaJ?ISiiric existence are shortly explained in the segment. 1081 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.33a6-35b4, DK.B.La.5.9b1- l l b6, DK.D.La.5.9br 11 b6, DK.Q.La.5.387�-389a6, DK.R.La.5.14brl8a6, DK.S.La.5.15br 19bs, DK.T.La.5.9b-11 b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

These step s are here explained with regard to the compassion that focuses on sentient beings (sems can la dmigs pa'i snying rje), on phenomena (chos la dmigs pa'i snying rje), and unreferential compassion (dmigs pa med pa'i snying rje). The two former constitute the relative bodhicitta (kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems), while the latter type is the abs olute bodhicitta (don dam byang chub kyi sems). Three short quotations of sayings by Mi la ras pa and the Indian Siddha Kotali (slob dpon tog tse ha) are then used illustrate the importance of meditating on the nature of the mind and how this nature is beyond characteristics. This point is related to Mahamudra meditation, either in the form of the Completion Stage involving elaborations (spros bcas) or without elaborations (spros med). The former denotes the special yoga practices of channels and winds (rtsa rlung, *natj,ipra�ia), which produce a glimpse of the nature of the mind, allowing the attainment of full realization when the dying practitioner experiences radiance in the interim (bar do'i 'od gsal). The question of when to practice and achieve realization is underlined by contrasting sayings from an unspecified (Bka' gdams pa) dge bshes and Mi la ras pa. Even if the radiance ('od gsal) of the nature of the mind is not fully grasped in the interim, a practi­tioner who has successfully given rise to seeing the essence (ngo bo mthong ha) will in future lives have a special meditative ability (ting nge 'dzin khyad par can). Such an individual is said to be someone supported by a past accumulation (bsags pa'i rgyab can). Consequently, the practitioner ought now to strive towards realizing radiance in the interim and even if that should fail he will consequently be in a position to achieve full realization in a future life. It is said that no teaching is more important than this.

It contains explanations on the Mahiimudra view, meditation, and conduct, along with the basis, path, and result of Mahamudrii.

The segment contains a prose commentary that provides the exegesis of an unidentified root text written in verse. It is possible that the title of root text is \"the quintessential meaning\" (snying po don or snying po'i don, *siiriirtha), although the title is only alluded to and never stated explicitly. The root text, which is cited in the segment with the interspersed prose commentary, con­sists of ten four-line verses. Most of the verse lines have nine syllables per line, while a few have just seven syllables. The first set of verses describes how the yogf, by relying on the instruction of a bla ma, should meditate on the Self (bdag nyid, *iitman, *iitmakatii, or *iitmya), whose nature is bliss and emptiness. The meditation is to be focused on the bodily cakra of great bliss (bde ba chen po 'i 'khor lo), i.e., the cakra located at the top of the head.10 83 The next group of verses declares that the quintessential meaning (snying po don) is without a self (bdag med ma, *aniitman or *nairiitmya), non-dual and singular. The third set of verses explains that the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittatii) is the seed of everything (kun gyi sa bon, *sarvabfjaka), from which both SaJJisiira and nirvii1:1a appear. The whole variety of existence radiates out of the mind, which ultimately is the dhannakiiya (chos kyi sku). The relationship between the mind and the emanated perceptions of existence is comparable to the indivisibility of the sun and its rays. Next, the root text describes how this co-emergent nature (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja) is to be realized by relying on the instruction of the bla ma and how the meditation practice produces various meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought. The following verses discuss the inseparability of perceptions (snang ba, *avabhiisa) and the mind (sems, *citta) by means of two analogies, namely pouring water into water and adding butter to butter. To this is added how the practitioner should rest meditatively in the nature of the mind, dissolving all appearing objects into the perception (snang ba) of the mind. The final verse-group proclaims th at in this manner all experiences are nothing but the dhannakiiya, the nature of the mind, appearing like reflections of the moon on a water surface. The nature is beyond the senses. This is the highest meditative focus and meditating thereon is the best form of devotional service to the bla ma. The segment ends without any colophon.

The segment first lists and then briefly explains these points. The first point is \"the realization involving the view\" (rtogs pa lta ba dang ldan pa), which includes the realization that Buddhahood and a sentient being belong to the same continuum (rgyud gcig), as well as the realization that manifest phenomena (snang ba, *avabhasa) and the perceiving mind (sems, *sems) are not separate (tha mi dad pa, *avyatireka). The second point is \"the meditation involving meditative experience\" (sgom pa nyams myong dang ldan pa). Meditation (sgom pa, *bhiivanii) is here characterized as being unbiased (phyogs su ma lhung pa), free of identifying features (ngos bzung dang bral ba), and inexpressible (brjod du med pa, *nirabhiliipya). The meditative experience thereof (nyams myong, *anubhiiva) is the merging of the meditative and the post-meditative states, an achievement which manifests outwardly in completely giving up the eight worldly concerns ('jig rten chos brgyad, *a�,tau lokadharmii!i).1085 The third point is \"the conduct involving equalizing taste\" (spyod pa ro snyoms dang ldan pa). It is here explained that \"equalizing taste \" (ro snyoms, *samarasa) may refer to equalizing the taste of realization (rtogs pa'i ro snyoms), where there remains no difference between perception (snang ba) and radiance ('od gsal). It may also denote equalizing the taste of equanimity (mnyam pa nyid kyi ro snyoms), where there remains no difference between meditation (mnyam bzhag, *samiihita) and post-meditative attainment (rjes thob, *anupriipta) . Moreover, it may be equalizing the taste of meditative experience (nyams su myong ba'i ro snyoms), where there remains no difference between the afflictive emotions (nyon mongs pa, *kle§a) and knowledge (ye shes, *jfiiina). The fourth point is \"the certainty involving the removal of errors\" (nges shes skyon bsal ba dang ldan pa), which refers to gaining the certainty that buddhahood is found within oneself, that all phenomena are subsumed within the mind, that SaJJisiira is without beginning and end, that the result of the path will emerge in ones elf, and that SaJJisiira will 1084 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha. l 2b6-13a6, DK.a.Nga. l 03b2-104a3, DK.B.Sha.2.4a3-4b3, DK.D.Sha.2.4a1-4b1, DK.Q.Sha.2.39lar39lb1, DK.R.Sha.2.6az-7a3, DK.S.Sha.2.5b4-6b5, DK.T.Sha.2.4n-4b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

The present commentary does not cite the root text systematically but refers to many of its phrases. It thus covers largely the same points as segment DK.A.Sha. I, but it gives much more extensive explanations. Following a verse of homage to the bla mas, yoginfs, and tjiikinfs, the segment com­mences by stating that the co-emergent (lhan cig skyes pa, *sahaja) is dharmakiiya (chos kyi sku). More specifically, the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajacittatii) is dharmakiiya, whereas the co-emergent perceptions (snang ba lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajiivabhiisa) are the light of dharmakiiya. Thereupon, the segment explains how the practitioner should abide (gnas, *sthiti) in the co-emergent, namely by resting in the inborn (gnyug ma, *nija) without considering the mind as such and perceptions as being different or separate. The segment elaborates on this point, explaining in more detail how the meditator experiences the inseparability of the nature of the mind and sensory percep-1086 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ga.130a5-135b4, DK.a.Nga.1 04a3-109bi, DK.B.Sha.3.4b4- l Oai, DK.D.Sha.3.4b1-9bs, DK.Q.Sha.3.391br397b1, DK.R.Sha.3.7a3-l 7bs, DK.S.Sha.3.6bs-1 6b3, DK.T.Sha.3.4b-9b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Relying on the instructions of the bla ma, the practitioner comes to experience this nature as clearly as seeing a medicinal amla fruit (skyu ru ra, *amalaka, emblic myrobalan) held in one's own hand. The text then states that the inborn nature (gnyug ma'i don) involves a realization of selflessness (bdag med pa, *nairatmya) and that all phenomena are just mind (sems nyid, *cittam eva). Yet, this is not something that has been realized by the Madhyamikas and others (dbu ma pa la sags pa gzhan gyis). In fact, it is acc omplished without relying on meditation. It is an inborn nature that is found within all sentient beings. This nature called \"the quintessential meaning\" (snying po'i don, *sarartha) is the natural mind (tha mal gyi shes pa, *prakrtajiiana). It is an inner knowledge that cannot be obtained from others or from elsewhere, the realization of which is buddhahood. Ultimately, no form of meditation can perceive this nature, because it is not something to be cultivated. Yet, the nature can be indirectly approached through meditative methods. Deluded meditative practices (rmongs pa'i bsam gtan, *sa1Junohadhyana) and the Tantric methods of visualizing channels, winds, drops, bodies, and mudras merely give rise to various states of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *§amatha), which never yield any real result. These are all paths of yogas involving conceptual entanglements (rnal 'byor spros pa'i lam). The inborn nature, on the other hand, is fundamentally inexpressible, an unfabricated aspect of the mind (sems ma bcos pa). Aside from this mind, there is neither smJisara and nirvaria. In this sense, there is no difference between all phenomena and dhannakaya, the nature of the mind. The segment uses the analogy of sunrays and the sun to illustrate this indivisible relationship. As long as the mind is bound, it remains sa1Jisaric, whereas when it comes to rest in itself fully relaxing all its self-created attachments, it becomes liberated. These points are further elaborated in the segment. In an interlinear note (DK.A.Sha.3.8a2), the meditative practice of letting the awareness rest in itself (shes pa rang gar bzhag pa) is referred to as *Samantabhadra (kun tu bzang po), a reference that might betray a subtle Rnying ma influence on the teaching from the tradition of the old Tantras (rnying ma 'i rgyud), given the special position held by the bodhisattva or adibuddha Samantabhadra in those texts and transmissions. The segment then speaks of the meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non­thought, here relating the meditative practice to the stages of Tantric empowerment. The vase empowerment (bum dbang, *kalasabhi�eka) denotes that ignorance and the afflictive emotions are turned into the five buddha wisdoms. The insight-knowledge empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang, *prajiiajnanabhi�eka) expresses how co-emergent knowledge (than cig skyes pa'i ye shes, *sahajajiiana) becomes a meditative experience (nyams su myong ba, *anubhtiva) by relying on sexual practices with an action seal (las kyi phyag rgya, *karmamudra). Yet, the inborn nature (gnyug ma'i de kho na nyid, *nijatattva) signifies insight-emptiness (shes rah stong pa), the single nature of all meditative experi­ences of bliss, presence, an d non-thought."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"480 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um At this point, the segment relates the presented understanding to the doctrines of various Buddhist tenet systems. It is said that the Vaibhasikas (nyan thos bye brag pa) and the Sautrantikas (mdo sde pa) of the Hinayana share the view that comprehends the essence­lessness of perceived objects (gzung ba rang bzhin med pa), due to which they realize the selflessness of the individual. In the end, there is, however, no need to adopt the medita­tions that have been taught by non-Buddhist ascetics (mu stegs kyi brtul zhugs, *tfrthika­tapasvin), by Hinayana practitioners, by proponents of Cognition-[ Only] view (rnam par rig pa, *vijiiapti[vada]), or by the Madhyamikas (dbu ma pa). Rather, with this unexcelled quintessential meaning (snying po'i don mchog tu gyur pa 'di) in hand, the practitioner sees directly that there is no buddhahood to be attained outside. This is not simply the experi­ence of the channels, winds, and drops, but it is the actual original knowledge (dang po shes pa, *adijiiana) that involves neither effort nor accomplishment. It is the union of com­passion and emptiness. Emptiness without compassion or compassion without emptiness should equally be understood as being the work of Mara. The segment ends with thirteen verse lines that briefly sum up the view, the meditation, and the conduct. It also gives a dedication of the beneficence (bsod nams, *pu!iya) for the sake of the happiness of all.

The first is that Mahamudra pervades everything (thams cad khyab pa, *sarvavyapya). The second is that it is formless (gzugs can ma yin pa, *ariipa), yet has the appearance of knowledge (ye shes kyi ngo bo, *jiianariipa). The third is that it is present at all times (dus thams cad pa, *sarvakalika). The fourth is that it neither comes nor goes ('gro 'ong med pa). When the realization of this arises in the practitioner, sa111sara is no longer thought of as something to be given up or removed, since it is not considered an adverse condition. Nirva!ia is not seen as peace. Consequently, Mahamudra involves no use of remedies and entails no hope or fear for any result or outcome. Aside from this, there is no buddhahood. To focus one's mind on this is to live without any care for storing provisions (bza' gtad med pa). Its realization is induced by a bla ma belonging to the transmission lineage, but it is nonetheless a direct realization that occurs purely from within oneself. 1087 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.

These include the small person (skyes bu chung ngu) who practices out of fear for unplea­sant rebirths, the middling person (skyes bu 'bring) who strives to attain personal liberation (rang thar pa) from sa17isara, and the highest person (skyes bu mchog) who aims to attain complete Awakening (byang chub, *bodhi) in order to benefit all sentient beings. The progressive steps of these paths, which are taught in treatises of the Bka' gdams traditi on (bka' gdams kyi gzhung), consist of contemplating the suffering of the lower existences (ngan song gi sdug bsngal bsams pa), taking refuge in the three jewels (dkon mchog gsum la skyabs su song ba), contemplating the overall suffering of sa17isara ('khor ba mtha' dag gi sdug bsngal bsams pa), taking monastic ordination as a Buddhist monk (bsnyen par rdzogs pa dge slang gi sdom pa blangs pa), cultivating the relative resolve for Awakening (kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems bsgoms pa), and meditating on the two kinds of selfless­ness (bdag med rnams gnyis sgom pa). 1088 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.60a5-6l b1, DK.B.Sa.1. lb1-3as, DK.D.Sa.1.1 b1-3a2, DK.Q.Sa. l .398a;-399a5, DK.R.Sa. 1.1 b1-3b6, DK.S.Sa.1 . 1 b1-4a3, DK.T.Sa.1.1 b-3n, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

In this tradition, the Mantra practitioner is first only instructed to accumulate the requisites (tshogs sog tsam) and is thereafter taught the Generation Stage visualizations (bskyed rim) as a separate practice. Thereupon, he is instructed how to invite the wisdom-beings (ye shes sems dpa) and is then taught the empo­werments, offerings, and praises (dbang mchod stod). First at this point are the practices of the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim) presented, given that those practices are not taught from the outset in the Bka' gdams school. A short saying by the Bka' gdams teacher Dge bshes Lcags ri ba is quoted at this point to present the Bka' gdams pa view (lta ha). This view is then contrasted with the position of the Indian Tantric master Naropa, who said that the Generation and the Completion Stages may be taught progressively to a gradualist practitioner (rims kyis pa), but to the instantane­ous practitioner (cig car ba) they should be taught in a combined fashion and be practiced in unison within the single sitting (gdan thog cig tu) of a meditation session. Again, a contrast is introduced in the segment between how purification practices (sbyong pa, *visod hana) are variously taught. The Bka' gdams tradition of Atifa (jo ho rje'i lugs) teaches that purification takes place from the outside in, the Tantric tradition of Bla ma Mi la teaches that purification is effected from the inside out, whereas the tradition of the Bla ma (i.e., Bsod nams rin chen) teaches that purification first occurs in the interim (bar do, *antarabhava). The Bla ma taught that the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa, *sahajacittata) is dharmakaya, namely co-emergent knowledge and emptiness (rig pa dang stong pa lhan cig skyes). This accords with what has been taught in the teaching cycles of the Indian siddhas (grub pa thob pa'i skor), what was spoken by Buddha Vajradhara in the Tantras (rdo rje 'chang gi rgyud), and it also fits with the inner experience that generally presents itself to yogis.

First, it is stated that the ultimate, which is unceasing (rgyun chad med pa), can neither be taught, denied, nor seen by the Buddha or anyone else. Two sayings are then cited from the Bka' gdams pa teachers Dge bshes [Rgya] Yon bdag and Dge bshes Lcags ri ba, describing how the tenets of the doxographical schools (grub mtha', *siddhanta), in particular the Madhyamaka tradition of Nagarjuna (klu sgrub kyi dbu ma), take apart fixed ideas about reality . The Bla ma is quoted for saying that the philosophical tenets are all mental constructs and that it is difficult to comprehend views that have not arisen from deep meditation. Similarly, the Precious One (rin po che) is quoted as saying that although the Bka' gdams pas generally cherish the view, 1089 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.6lb1-62a1, DK.B.Sa.2.3a5-3b5, DK.D.Sa.2.3ar3bi, DK.Q.Sa.2.399a6-399bs, DK.R.Sa.2.3b6-4b4, DK.S.Sa.2.4a3-5a2, DK.T.Sa.2.3n-3b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The segment begins by laying out the key points of each of the four empowerments (dbang, *abhi�eka). The vase empowerment (bum pa'i dbang, *kalasabhi�eka) serves to tum around ordinary attachment, replacing it with the conviction of actually being the deity (lha'i nga rgyal) and transforming the five afflictive emotions (nyon mongs pa, *kle§a) into the five types of knowledge (ye shes, *jfilina). The secret empowerment (gsang ba'i dbang, *guhylibhi�eka) has the purpose of generating bliss (bde ba, *Zinanda) in the practitioner. The insight-knowledge empower­ment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang, *prajfilijiilinlibhi�eka) is aimed at generating unbinding bliss (zag med kyi bde ba, *anlisravlinanda). Finally, the fourth stage, here called the precious word empowerment (tshig dbang rin po che, *ak�arlibhi�eka), introduces dharma­kaya to the practitioner. It is also noted that it is, in fact, only the fourth empowerment that constitutes the actual path to Awakening. Having been matured by receiving the four empowerments, the practitioner employs the liberating methods of the Generation and Completion Stages of the deity practice, which reveal the nature of the mind to be buddha (bde bar gshegs pa, *sugata). This nature of the mind is the mind that is the dimension of ultimate reality (chos kyi dbyings kyi sems, *dharmadhlitucitta), the mind whose nature is great bliss (bde ba chen po'i bdag nyid, *mahlisukhatman ). It is then described how the practice of visualizing the deity in the Generation Stage gives rise to tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *samatha) and insight meditation (lhag mthong, *vipasyana), in the process of which eighty inherent conceptual-emotional states (rtog pa'i rang bzhin brgyad cu) are eliminated. This gives rise to a non-conceptual state, which results in experiencing co-emergent joy (lhan cig skyes pa'i dga' ba, *sahajlinanda). These attainments are accompanied by many outer and inner progessive signs of attainment. At this stage, the yagzhas entered the first degree of meditative absorption (bsam gtan dang po, *prathama dhylina) and from there onwards the bla ma can lead the student into the 109° Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.62a1-62b4, DK.B.Sa.3.3bs-4bi, DK.D.Sa.3.3bz-4a4, DK.Q.Sa.3.399bs-400a1, DK.R.Sa.3.4b4-6a1, DK.S.Sa.3.5az-6a5, DK.T.Sa.3.3b-4n, Phyag chen mdzadvol.

In order to tum the mind away from this life and practice the Dharma, the practitioner needs the good fortune to meet a faultless teacher (bla ma, *guru) and a faultless Dharma. A faultless result cannot come about without these conditions. If these conditions are in place, the practitioner begins the practice by contemplating impermanence, whereby the mind is made to turn away from this life. Contemplating the shortcomings of smJisiira turns the mind away from sai71siira in its entirety. Cultivating kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening produces the wish to attain bud­dhahood for the benefit of all the mothers of one's previous lives who are stuck in sai71si5.ra. All the practices undertaken thereafter, such as gathering the requisite of beneficence (bsod nams kyi tshogs, *pwy,yasa1!1bhiira), meditating on the Generation Stage, reciting mantras, etc., have the purpose of strengthening the twofold resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta). The first form of bodhicitta is the relative (kun rdzob, *saiJivrtti ), where all appearing objects (phyi bzung ba'i yul) -whether outer perceptions or inner states -are regarded as being nothing but dreamlike and illusory, while the inner perceiving mind (nang 'dzin pa'i sems) is regarded as being without defining characteristics, not produced by any cause or condition, unborn and unceasing. 1091 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.62b4-6, DK.B.Sa.4.4b1-s, DK.D.Sa.4.4a4-4b1, DK.Q.Sa.4.400a1_4, DK.R.Sa.4.6a1-s, DK.S.Sa.4.6as-6b4, DK.T.Sa.4.4n-4b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

Thoughts simply emerge out of the mind and dissolve back into it again, like waves on the ocean. The nature of the mind (sems kyi rang bzhin, *cittasvabhiiva) is radiance ('od gsal ba, \"\"prabhiisvara), which is not established as truly existent with any independent nature whatsoever (ci'i ngo bor yang ma grub pa). Just at the moment when a new thought consciousness (blo, *buddhi) surfaces, the meditator should look at whence it has been born (gang nas skyes), into what it subsides (gar 'gag), and how it abides (ci !tar gnas pa). Such investigation will give rise to a feeling of certainty in the meditation and when this understanding has sufficiently increased, the meditator then rests the unfabricated knowledge in its own self-presence (rang gsal, *svavyakti). Through repeated practice, this state of fresh awareness can gradually be prolonged, so that it becomes like the uninterrupted flow of river or the shining tip of a candle that is completely undisturbed by the wind.

The Prajniipiiramitii view (pha rol tu phyin pa) is to see the emptiness of all phenomena and ultimately not to observe any phenomenon at all. The Secret Mantra ap­proach (gsang sngags, *guhyamantra) is the method for putting this view into practice (don dngos lam du byed pa). A quotation is then given from Tailopa, declaring that self-aware­ness (rang gi rig pa, *svasm11vedanii) is knowledge of reality and apart from that there is nothing else to teach. Following the quotation, the segment carries on with a series of brief declarations about the view, meditative experience, meditation, conduct, and the result. The view (lta ba, *darfona) is non-duality . Meditative experience (nyams myong, *anubhuta) is an uninterrupted stream. Meditation (sgom pa, *bhiivanii) is impartiality (phyogs su ma !tung ba). The conduct (spyod pa, *carya) is to be without anything to be refuted and any­thing to be established. The result ('bras bu, *phala) is to be without hopes and fears.

The saying begins by stating that a practitioner who seeks certainty is profound regardless of which sort of practice he undertakes. The practitioner's path is then laid out with refe­rence to the approach of the Bka' gdams pa tradition and the Tantric practice system of Mi la ras pa. Concerning the Bka' gdams pa tradition, the segment first gives a short outline of the approach of Dge bshes 'Brom Ston pa Rgyal ba'i 'byung gnas (1004/1005-1064). It should be noted that the passage does not cite this famous Bka' gdams pa master with his full name, but only refers to him with the epithet Dge bshes Ston pa. It says that Dge bshes Ston pa was very knowledgeable of the Secret Mantra teachings, that he divided practitioners into three types called \"the three persons\" (skyes bu gsum), and that he constantly cultivated kindness and compassion. The segment also states that when the teachings of the bka' gdams tradition (bka' gdams kyi bstan pa) are spreading 'nowadays', this promulgation is done in accordance with the framework of 'Brom ston pa's system of the three persons. Attention is then drawn to the Tibetan translator and master Lotsa ba Rin chen bzang po (958-1055), who was a contemporary of AtiSa. The story is told that he formerly met with sixty (Indian) scholars (pm:ufi ta), probably referring to his extensive studies and translation work in Kashmir and in his hometown Mtho' !ding in the Mnga' ris - Gu ge region of Western Tibet. Yet, it is said that he never received any instruction on cultivating kindness and compassion (byams snying 1je, *maitrlkaru�ie), but it was first when he met Atifa in Western Tibet that he obtained such instructions and thereafter attained accomplishment. Hence, starting with the three yogis (rnal 'byor pa gsum) right down to Dge bshes Jo bo,1100 the Bka' gdams pa doctrine has been systematized through the framework of the three persons (skyes bu gsum) with its central teaching on kindness and compassion. The segment then gives an outline of the stages of the path (lam rim) according to the Bka' gdams tradition. It is taught that, at the outset, it is indispensable to engender the 1100 The transmission line indicated in this phrase remains somewhat obscure. The expression \"starting with three yogis\" (rnal 'byor gsum man chad nas) might refer to Atifa's three main students, namely Rnal 'byor pa, Dgon pa ba, and 'Brom ston pa, or perhaps to some other threefold group of Atifa's students who commonly are referred to with the title yogi (rnal 'byor pa); such students include Rnal 'by or pa Shes rab rdo rj e, Rnal 'by or pa Byang chub rin chen (1015-1077), Rnal 'by or A mes, and Dgon pa ba Dbang phyug rgyal mtshan (see SHERPA, 2004:209 fn. 521 ). The other expression \"right down to Dge bshes Jo bo\" (dge bshes jo bo yan chad) is equally uncertain. The epithet Jo bo, \"venerable,\" is often used with respect to Ati§a, but it then usually appears in the form \"the venerable master\" (jo bo rj e), which is not the case here. Moreover, if the epithet is taken as referring to Atifa, then the three yogis would have to refer to teachers who preceded Ati§a, but the doctrine of the three persons is stated in the preceding passage and elsewhere in the corpus to have been a systematization introduced by Atifa's students; see, e.g., segment DK.A.Nga. I, where the doctrine is ascribed to the 'Brom ston pa's three students known as \"the three brethren\" (sku mched gsum), viz. Po to ba Rin chen gsal, Spyan snga ba Tshul khrims 'bar, and Phu chung ba Gzhon nu rgyal mtshan. Consequently, it would seem that Dge bshes Jo bo here is employed to designate one ofBsod nams rin chen's Bka' gdams pa teachers."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 489 relative resolve for Awakening (kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems), to contemplate imperma­nence (mi rtag pa, *anitya) and actions and their results (las dang 'bras bu, *karmaphala). It is emphasized how and why these practices remain of great importance on every succes­sive stage of the path. Without progressing through all the stages of the path, even if a glimpse of the original nature (gnyug ma, *nijasarr1vid) should occur, it would be of little benefit if attachment (chags pa, *sariga) to things and people persists in the practitioner. In light of this, it is significant to have trained the mind (blo sbyangs) thoroughly in kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening, because even without any direct realization of the original nature, the practitioner who has cultivated such good qualities will invariably make progress without setbacks. Thereupon, the segment gives a short presentation of the original nature (gnyug ma, *nijasmf1vid) in terms of its appearance (ngo bo, *rupa) as something that is beyond the characteristics of things, its result ('bras bu, >l'phala) in terms of its relationship to dharma­kiiya and how the form-kiiyas (gzugs sku, *rupakiiya) emerge from the meditative experi­ences of bliss, presence, and non-thought, and its cause (rgyu, *hetu) which lies in the experience of bliss-presence (bde gsal) that arises from the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo ).1101 At this point, Mi la ras pa is cited as saying that the practice of Inner Heat is of utmost importance, since it is difficult to hold the right view when it is not a view that has been derived from meditation. The path of the three persons is then laid out in the framework of the Prajnapiiramita system (pha rol tu phyin pa'i bzh ed pa), i.e., in accordance with the Common Mahayiina teachings. The highest person (skyes bu mchog) trains his mind in kindness, compassion, and the resolve for Awakening, and thereupon realizes the highest view, being that of the Madhyamaka school. The middling person (skyes bu 'bring) practices the approach of the middling person and then strives to understand impermanence. The small person (skyes bu chung ngu) focuses on preventing rebirth in the lower existences by heeding the teachings on actions and their results (las 'bras, *karmaphala). By understanding that the whole of saqisiiric existence is enmeshed in suffering, the small person may progress to the approach of the middling person and thus strive for individual liberation rather than just aiming for a good sarrisiiric rebirth. However, eventually it is necessary for every type of practitioner to strive for the highest and complete Awakening, and to this end the Paramitii path (pha rol tu phyin pa'i lam) of the Common Mahiiyiina is insufficient. Instead, the practitioner needs to rely on the Secret Mantra methods consisting of the Generation and Completion stages. The Generation stage effects the realization of union (zung 'jug, *yuganaddha) of subject and object, while the Completion stage brings about realization of buddhahood. It is briefly outlined how the small, middling, and highest practitioner variously achieves such a vision with varying degrees of success. A brief reference is here made to the meaning of visuali­zing the five buddha families (rigs lnga, zpancakula), their five goddesses (!ha mo lnga, *pancadevi), and the surrounding sixteen male and female bodhisattvas (byang chub sems dpa' bcu drug). 1101 See the similar explanation given in segment DK.A.Tha.13."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"490 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum The question is then raised what difference there really is between the Paramita and the Secret Mantra approaches. It is explained that the Paramita approach, on the one hand, utilizes a general idea (don spyi'i rnam pa, *arthasamanyakara) of the emptiness of per­ceived objects by relying on logical arguments. When it is understood that perceived objects are empty, it is conversely concluded that the perceiving mind likewise is empty. The Secret Mantra approach, on the other hand, does not involve such investigation of objects and mind, but instead entails a method of looking directly at a moment of mind as it arises, searching for its source, its place of abiding, and its destination when it dissolves. The Secret Mantra practitioner thereby reaches the conclusion that the mind is unborn and without any identifiable steps of arising, remaining, or dissolving. The nature of the mind is here the object for highest knowledge (ye shes kyi spyod yul, *jiianagocara) and not an object for the conceptual mind (rnam rtog gi blo'i yul). Unlike the Paramita path where the meditator rests the mind on a general idea of emptiness, the Secret Mantra practitioner relies on a direct experience as the path, which is brought about by utilizing the special yogic methods of causing the winds to enter the central channel, seeing the inseparability of the winds and the mind, and thereby making the mind emerge as a non-conceptual presence (shes pa gsal la mi rtog pa). At this point, a capable bla ma should instruct the student to realize that the experience of non-conceptual present awareness is actually direct knowledge of the mind itself, and through such instruction the meditator becomes able to reach certainty (nges shes). With sustained practice, this certainty turns into the so-called Vajra-Like Meditative Absorption (rdo rje lta bu'i ting nge 'dzin, *vajropama[1 samadhi[1), which according to Mahayana doctrine is the highest meditation that eliminates all remaining obscurations and brings about complete Awakening. The segment ends with an explanation of three types of path (lam rnam pa gsum), namely the path of abandoning the basis (gzhi spong ba'i lam), the path of transforming the basis (gzhi sgyur ba'i lam), and the path of knowing the basis (gzhi shes pa'i lam). The first is the Paramita path where the practitioner abandons all afflictive emotions and creates a remedy against these in his in his mind-stream in the form of knowledge (rig pa, *vidya). The second pertains to one aspect of the Secret Mantra path, where the practitioner transforms all phenomena into the celestial palace, the deities and goddesses, turns food into nectar, himself into a deity, and the afflictive emotions into the five types of know­ledge. The third is another aspect of the Secret Mantra path, at which level there is nothing to abandon, nothing to cultivate, and nothing to transform. Here everything is understood as being subsumed within the mind (sems su 'dus), given that simply everything is a mental projection (sems kyi rnam 'phrul), and the unborn nature of the mind itself is understood to be radiance ('od gsal ba, *prabhasvara). A few final sentences are devoted to laying out this understanding in terms of meditative experience. The segment has no colophon.

It is here clarified that the term \"the co-emergent mind as such\" denotes the nature of the mind (sems kyi rang bzhin nam ngo bo, *cittasvabhii.va(i [sva]rupo vii.), whereas \"the co-emergent perceptions\" signify the conceptuality that has arisen therefrom (de las byung ba'i rnam par rtog pa, *tatutpannavikal pa). Thereupon, the segment presents \"three dharmas to be realized\" (rtogs par bya ba'i chos gsum) and \"three dharmas to be experienced\" (nyams su blang ba'i chos gsum).1103 The three dharmas to be realized are: the co-emergent experiences are not anything at all, yet they arise as a multiplicity of experiences; although these arise as a multiplicity, they are in fact not anything; and the non-duality thereof cannot be expressed in words. The three dharmas to be experienced are: at first, the yogf should relax the body and the mind in the co-emergent mind as such without any effort and without any aim to be accomplished; in the middle, he should leave the mind in a fresh, non-artificial state free from any doubt; in the end, he should understand all sensations to be unborn. Finally, the segment briefly discusses the contemplations (bsgoms pa, *bhii.vana or *smJijna) of death ('chi ba, *marm:za), the shortcomings of sa1J1Sii.ra ('khor ba'i nyes dmigs, *saY(lsii.rii.dfnava), kindness, compassion and the resolve for Awakening (byams snying rje byang chub kyi sems, *maitrfkarw:iabodhicitta), and profound emptiness (zab mo stong nyid, *gambhf rasunyatii.), along with some additional remarks specifically on the contemplation of death.

The first three verses have nine syllables per line, whereas the remaining five verses have eleven syllables per line. The poem describes how the bla ma, who is a buddha-emanation (bde gshegs sprul pa), introduces the nature of the mind, producing in the student an experience beyond words. All dualistic concepts become spontaneously disentangled and dissolve into the inexpressible expanse of the dharmakiiya. Thereby, unbinding bliss surges in the body and encompasses all. Nonetheless, the meditator maintains an attitude of complete non-attachment, whereby the meditative experiences become uninterrupted like the flow of a river, naturally giving rise to the result of being totally without hope and fear. With the practice of guru yoga, the student conti­nues to hold the bla ma above his head and turns all experiences into the path. The attitude of non-attachment must be applied to all forms of suffering, happiness, pers onal rela­tionships, and places.

Having visualized herself in the form of the deity, the meditator should focus on the nature of the mind and observe that the mind neither is born at the outset, that it does not abide in the middle, and that it does not cease at the end. Also, it should be seen that the mind cannot be established as any object or thing possessing a shape or form. Having analyzed the mind in this way, the meditator should lucidly enter into a meditation that is unconstructed and non-artificial (ma bcos pa). Thereby, the mind will arise as radiance ('ad gsal, '\"prabhiisvara), the body will become ablaze with bliss, all defining charac teristics will resolve themselves. At that point, there will be no difference between meditation (mnyam bzhag, *samiipatti) and post-meditative attainment (rjes thob, *anupriipta), which is compared to snow falling into water or meeting an old friend. Meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought will appear, the movement of the breathing will cease, no faults will be found in thoughts, and the disturbances of drowsiness and agitation will loosen their grip over the practitioner. By meditating in this manner repeatedly throughout many short sessions, night and day will seem the same and in the end the various states of buddhahood will emerge, which is the result of the path.

It further provides a transmission lineage for the instruction, starting with the Indian teachers Vajradhara, Tilopa, and Naropa, and then goes on to the Tibetan Bka' brgyud teachers Mar pa, Mi la ras pa, and Bsod nams rin chen.

The text contains an eclectic collection of passages mainly dealing with the meditative practices of the Secret Mantra and Mahiimudrii paths.

It ends (DK.A.Ha.1.2a5): lsrid pa bar dor pha ma 'i 'du shes mi skye bas mngal du mi 'jug go//.1113 The first segment is contains a short teaching on the interim (bar do, *antariibhava). A practitioner, who has fully perfected the Generation and Completion stages, has the ability to choose after death whether to enter into a new rebirth or not to be reborn and instead attain buddhahood in the interim. Someone who has only perfected the Generation stage has the ability to choose his next rebirth from parents belonging to any social caste (rigs, *var!ia) and attain buddhahood in that life. Four types of interim are then listed: the interim of reality (chos nyid kyi bar do), the interim of rebirth and death (skye shi gnyis kyi bar do), the interim of dream (rmi lam bar do), and the interim of becoming (srid pa bar do). These four types of interim are then differentiated with regard to the type of physical or mental body (lus, *deha) they involve; the different types of afflictive emotions with which they are mixed (bsre ba); how they variously entail three minor interims (bar do chung ngu) wherein radiance, realization, or non-conceptuality emerges; and how they relate to progressive stages of Tantric practice.1114 The segment has no colophon.

It is said that the most talented meditator is guided by a thorough understanding of the view, whereas the mediocre meditator is guided on the basis of the meditative practice itself. There are two interrelated aspects to meditation (sgom pa, *bhavanii): to seek medita­tion on the basis of the view (!ta thog la sgom tshol ba) and to seek the view on the basis of meditation (sgom thog nas lta ba tshol ba).1116 The practitioner should rest in a meditative awareness of the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittatii) that is present (gsal ba, *vyakta) and free of conceptual grasping ('dzin med). Being present prevents the extreme nihilism, while being free of conceptual grasping rules out the extreme of eternalism. If a feeling of bliss arises, it has no cause. There should neither be pride of evaluating the meditation as being positive nor fear of thinking of it as being bad. The mind as such becomes distorted through such concepts, and consequently the meditator needs to rest directly in knowledge (rig pa, *vidya) that is non-conceptual. The segment ends by laying out fifteen steps (rkang grangs bco lnga) for meditating on the nature of the mind, focusing on various facets of non­conceptuality and the nature of awareness. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.Ha.3: The segment begins (DK.A.Ha.3.2b7): /Ina mo gu ru/ snang ba 'di sgyu mar mthong bas sgyu [us/.

It is said that to see experiences (snang ba, *avabhasa) as hallucination (sgyu ma, *maya) is the yoga of the Illusory Body; to see illusions as empty is the yoga of Radiance; and to see these as having no difference is the yoga of union. This explanation is identical to the one given in segment DK.A.Cha.25. Thereupon, four verse lines are cited, which seem to paraphrase points from Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara.

Further, he must regard his own body as being the illusory body of the deity and must accomplish ability in the Completion Stage practices (rdzogs rim) of the method path (thabs lam). He must complete the recitations of secret mantra, which create the necessary basis for performing the activities of Awakening without obstructions. He must observe the mind undistractedly. A practitioner who is deeply engaged in Dhanna practice in such a thorough manner will automatically be protected by the Dharma protectors and the c},iikinfs. The practitioner should offer gtor ma ( *bali) to the protectors and <}iikinfs, whereby he entrusts them with the activity of removing obstacles. If obstacles were to arise, he is instructed to regard all spirits or ghosts ('dre) as simply being his own thoughts (rang gi rnam rtog).

The observances are divided into those of the body, the speech, and the mind, and they subsume the vows of the other vehicles. In terms of the lower vehicles (theg pa 'og ma), the Tantric observances require the abandonment of actions inflicting harm on others (gzhan la gnod pa), which is accomp­lished by avoiding the ten negative actions of body, speech, and mind. In terms of the Great Vehicle (theg pa chen po, *mahiiyiina), the Tantric observances demand that the practitio­ner views all sentient beings as being his former mothers and acts for their benefit with body, speech, and mind. The observances that are specific to the Secret Mantra practice (gsang sngags, *guhyamantra) include seeing oneself and others as manifestations of the deity , reciting the mantra, and meditating on the mind as unborn radiance. In this manner, it is said to be important for the practitioner to check whether or not what needs to be abandoned indeed has been given up and what needs to be developed indeed has been developed.

To begin with, the yogi must strive never to transgress the Tantric observances (dam tshig, *samaya) associated with the Generation and Completion Stages. Without revealing his identity, the Tantric yogi occasionally needs secretly to enter the town in order to check whether he still finds it special and likes being there. If he still feels so, he needs to return to his solitary retreat in the wilderness. However, if his mind is able to remain stable under such circumstances, he is ready to enter into the Conduct of the Knowledge Vow (rig pa brtul zhugs gi spyod pa, *vidyiivratacaryii). This is the special conduct that was practiced by the great Indian siddhas Tilopa, Naropa, and Ghai:itapa.

Given that the poem makes concrete reference to Lha sa as Tshul khrims snying po's dwelling place (gnas gzhi, *sthiiniisraya), the poem is likely to have been written during or after the late 1150s or 1160s, when Tshul khrims snying po ( 1116-1169) stayed in Lha sa and became involved in renovating temples and Buddhist monuments there. 1138 The poem has no colophon, but -being the final part of text Ha -the segment is followed by the short printing colophon of the 1520 xylograph. 1134 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga.115b2-116a1, DK.B.Ha.16.6br7a4, DK.D.Ha.16.7a3-7b1, DK.Q.Ha.16.415a3_1, DK.R.Ha.16.12a6-13a3, DK.S.Ha. l6.l lb1-12a3, DK.T.Ha.16.7n-7b, Phyag chen mdzadvol.

Several of the segments give comparisons between the Bka' gdams pa tradition and the Tantric approach of Mi la ras pa. It is notable that the text shows many overlaps with parts of other texts in the Manifo ld Sayings corpus, particularly with texts DK.A.Nga, DK.A.La, and DK.A.Sa, as noted below. The text ends in segment DK.A.A.14 with a significant colophon, possibly derived from an earlier source, which states that it marks the endpoint of a textual compilation (bka' 'bum) of Bsod nams rin chen's sayings. Another colophon in segment DK.A.A.15 outlines three transmission lineages for the teachings of the textual compilation. For the transmission that ensued after Dags po Lha rje Bsod nams rin chen, the lineage masters are those of the Tibetan Karma Ka1Ji tshang tradition reaching right down to the fifteenth century with several teachers postdating the fifth Karma pa, De bzhin gshegs pa (1384-1415). The lineage thus arrives at an epoch that is a mere century or less prior to the creation of the Dags Iha sgam po xylograph print (DK.A) in 1520.

The explanation on higher discipline, which is longer than the remarks given on higher mind and higher insight, contains a discussion of how to uphold the three sets of vows (sdom pa gsum) as an interrelated set (rten 'brel skor cig).

The first is the term 'insight' (shes rah, *prajfia), which is subdivided into insight into the ultimate (don dam pa'i shes rah, *paramarthaprajfia) and insight into the relative (kun rdzob kyi shes rah, *sa7Jivrtiprajiia). The latter is briefly explained. The second is the term 'selflessness' (bdag med pa, *nairatmya). A distinction is drawn between the selflessness of the individual (gang zag gi bdag med, *'pudgalanairatmya) and the selflessness of phenomena (chos kyi bdag med, *dharmanairatmya). The segment briefly discusses the differing degrees of realization of these two forms of selflessness achieved by fravaka practitioners (nyan thos) of the small vehicle and followers of the Mahayana. The third term is 'exclamation', 'call' or 'lamenta­tion' ('a dad), here distinguished as a lamentation of renown (snyan pa'i 'a dod), a lamenta­tion of happiness (bde ba'i 'a dad), and a lamentation of fame (grags pa'i 'o dod). All three exclamations are said to consist in pointing out in one way or another that the buddha­nature, the inborn knowledge, is to be found within the practitioner's own mind and need not be sought elsewhere. Fourthly, a distinction is drawn between insanity (smyo ba, *unmatta) and sanity (ma smya ba, *anunmatta); the former consists in exclusively being concerned with the present life, while the latter is said to consist in abandoning negative actions and adopting positive behaviors. Fifthly, the difference between being skillful (mkhas pa, *kusala) and unskillful (mi mkhas pa, *akufala) is discussed in terms of whether the practitioner merely seeks a better rebirth, which is to be unskillful, or whether he seeks complete liberation from SaJ[lSara, which is to be skillful. At this point in the segment, a slightly longer explanation is given, which seems to pertain to the distinction of being unskillful and skillful (kufalakufala). Implicitly, however, the explanation seems to concord with teachings that usually pertain to the distinction of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *Samatha) and insight meditation (lhag mthang, *vipasya­na), although these latter terms are not employed in the passage. On the one hand, [in terms of being unskillful], it is said that its cause is a pure disci­pline (tshul khrims rnam par dag pa), its characteristic is a one-pointed focus (dmigs pa rtse gcig tu gnas pa), its experience is bliss and non-thought (bde ba mi rtog pa), and its result is the pacification of thoughts (rnam rtag nye bar zhi ba). The result is said to vary depending on which aspect of meditative experience is strongest. A dominant experience of non-thought leads to the formless realm, a dominant experience of clarity or presence (gsal ba, *vyakti) leads to the form realm, whereas a dominant experience of bliss leads to the desire realm. On the other hand, [in terms of being skillful], its cause is the insight of listening and reflecting, its characteristic is a pure mind, its experience is presence and non-thought, and its result is the dharmakaya. At this point follows a detailed discussion of the distinction between meditative experience (nyams, *anubhava) and realization (rtags pa, *avabadha), along with their interrelation. Several clarifying remarks are here given about the three meditative experiences of bliss (bde ba, *sukha), presence (gsal ba, *vyakti), and non­thought or non-conceptuality (mi rtog pa, *nirvikal pa)."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 505 The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[These] compiled sayings of the precious Bia ma Lha rje were instructed to master Sgom tshul and Sgom chung. He, in turn, taught them to Pho ro ba, the teacher (slob dpon) of the attendant (spyan snga) from Stod lung valley.\" The colophon thus describes a transmission lineage of these sayings (gsung sgros). First they were taught by Bsod nams rin chen (bla ma Iha rje rin po che) to his two nephews Dags po Sgom tshul and Dags po Sgom chung. Thereafter, either both nephews or only the latter of them taught the sayings to one Slob dpon Pho ro ba, whose identity remains unknown. The colophon supplies the information that Pho ro ba was the teacher of an unnamed 'attendant' (spyan snga) from Stod lung valley (gtod [sic.] lungs kyi spyan snga'i slob dpon). Segment DK.A.A.3: The segment begins (DK.A.A.3.3b7): llb la ma dam pa rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ /dge bshes lcags ris ba la/. It ends (DK.A.A.3.7ai): 'khor ba dang 'brel pa chod pa ga na 'ong/ dgongs mdzod gsung//. 1142 The first lines of the segment (DK.A.A.3.3br4a4) are identical to the last part of segment DK.A.La.1.3as-7-The segment also has a parallel in segment DK.A.Ki. I 7. The part that is identical with DK.A.La. I narrates a story about how Bsod nams rin chen once requested an instruction from Dge bshes Lcags ri ba on how to utilize thoughts as the path (rtog pa lam du khyer ba). Lcags ri ba first tells the background for this transmission, tracing it back to Rin chen bzang po, one *Pm�yajfiabodhi, Dge bshes Phu chung ba, and Dge bshes Glang ri thang pa. When it comes to presenting the actual instruction, the present segment, however, deviates from segment DK.A.La. I. In the present segment, it is first stressed how the practitioner needs to be skilful in the methods of realization (rtogs pa'i thabs la mk has). He must understand that there is nothing to abandon and nothing to cultivate among the factors of sa111siiric bondage (kun nas nyon mongs kyi chos, *sa1?ikle§a­dharma) and the factors of purification (rnam par byang ba'i chos, *vyavadiinadharma). Rather, all phenomena are merely concepts (rtog pa, *vikalpa) and all concepts are mind (sems, *citta). Hence, realizing the mind to be dhannakiiya liberates all phenomena. Thus, thoughts actually serve as the fuel for the fire of insight (shes rab kyi bud shing) and hence need not be abandoned. The next part of the segment (DK.A.A.3.4ar4b6) is identical to the first part of segment DK.A.La.1.1 b3-2b1). Here it is taught how a great meditator (sgom chen pa) should relate to different types of thoughts while meditating, either by overcoming them as soon as they are encountered (phrad '}oms pa), by pursuing them subsequently (phyi bsnyags pa), or by impressing them upon his mind (mdo sprul pa). These behaviors are clarified further through a series of analogies. Next follows the view of Dge bshes Phu chung ba, a passage (DK.A.A.3.4b6-5a1) that is partly similar to segment DK.A.La.1.3b1-2. The passage discusses how methods (thabs, *upiiya) and insight (shes rab, *prajfiii) should be weighed differently. 1142 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.85b6-88b3, DK.B.A.3.3br 7ai, DK.D.A.3.3b6-7bz, DK.Q.A.3.417b2-420b6, DK.R.A.3.5b2- l lbs, DK.S.A.3 .5b3-l 2a2, DK.T.A.3.3b-7b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

These include: (1) misunderstanding an intellectual form of empti­ness as constituting the nature of phenomena (stong pa nyid shes bya 'i gshis la shor ba); (2) misunderstanding emptiness as a retrospective means for enhancing activities (stong pa nyid rgyas 'debs la shor ba); (3) failing to apply remedies against afflictive emotions due to misunderstanding emptiness as a remedy (stong pa nyid gnyen por shor ba); and (4) misunderstanding emptiness as the path (stong pa nyid lam du shor ba) without seeing that it also pertains to the result of buddhahood. The explanations given on these points include a mention of the practice system of Great Perfection (rdzogs chen). This explanation is followed by a new saying by the precious one (rin po che) detailing differences in weighing the view over meditative experience and vice versa. The passage compares the position of the Bka' gdams tradition with the practice of Secret Mantra. Another saying by the precious one (rin po che) explains the necessity of concepts or thoughts (rnam rtog, *vikalpa) in meditative practice. The bodhisattva who follows the Mahayana needs to rely on concepts to train in radiance ('od gsal gyi rtsal sbyong ba) once he has accomplished the meditative absorption (ting nge 'dzin, *sanzadhi) of the four levels of meditation (bsam gtan bzhi, *catvari dhyanani). The practitioner of Secret Mantra needs to rely on concepts to train in the Generation Stage practices until he reaches the level of the special Tantric conduct of the [knowledge]-vow (brtul zhugs kyi spyod pa, *vratacarya). Hence, thoughts and concepts ought not to be seen as errors. Next, a question is posed as to whether a great meditator (sgom chen pa) is still exposed to illness (na ba, *vyadhi). It is clarified that an advanced practitioner remains susceptible to physical sickness, but that he must realize that illness is just a concept, all concepts are the mind, and the mind is dharnzakaya. An illustrative citation from the Indian Tantric master *Kuddalapada or *Kotali (tog tse pa or tog rtse pa) is here given. A new saying by the bla ma goes on to discuss the benefits of concepts in spiritual practice and how they must be utilized on the path to enhance realization and give rise to all good qualities. For example, it is explained that it is by using the concept of seeing all phenomena as the bla ma that the yogf gives rise to unceasing blessing. The final saying introduced in the segment is attributed to the precious one (rin po che). It discusses key points of Dharma practice and includes references to several of Bsod nams rin chen's Bka' gdams pa teachers, namely Dge bshes [Rgya] Yon bdag, Dge bshes Sgre pa, and Dge bshes Glang ri thang pa. It also cites the Hevajra Tantra. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.A.4: The segment begins (DK.A.A.4.7a5): /bla ma chen po na ro pa'i bzhed pas/.

The segment first presents the teaching of Naropa saying that the Secret Mantra path consists of empowerment for maturing the immature and the Generation and Completion Stage practices for liberating those who have been matured. Two approaches are then distinguished, namely meditating in a single sitting (gdan thog gcig tu sgom pa) where these stages are practiced in unison and practicing the two stages stepwise (rim gyis pa) one after another. Next, the segment gives a comparison of the approach taught by AtiSa (jo bo rje) and the logicians (mtshan nyid pa), on the one hand, and the practice system taught the bla ma [Bsod nams rin chen], on the other hand, concerning how to cut off (gcod pa) misconcep­tions. It is here said that the bla ma's approach is based on the teachings of the Indian Mahasiddhas, the heart texts (snying po skor) by the Great Brahmai:ia [Saraha], Nagarjuna, and so forth, along with the transmission lineage that stems from Buddha Vajradhara. References are also given to the Discipline Chapter ('dul ba'i le'u) of the Hevajra Tantra. Concerning the instantaneous (cig car ba) an d gradualist (rim gyis pa) approaches, the Ela ma [ Bsod nams rin chen] declares that instantaneous practitioners are exceedingly rare and that he himself is a gradualist.1144 The segment ends with a short explanation on how Secret Mantra practice is taught step by step in the Bka' gdams traditi on.

If a practitioner has truly achieved the absolute resolve for Awakening, the relative resolve will naturally be present and he is able to perform activities for the benefit of others without conceptualizing such actions. It is then shortly explained how a bodhisattva with due diligence performs actions benefiting others. In particular, it is shown how a practitioner of the Secret Mantra approach of the Mahayana (theg chen gsang sngags) first receives instruction from a realized teacher. The yogf then enters into solitary wilderness retreat to practice these instructions. Having attained meditative experiences and realization, the realized practi­tioner is then aided by all the efiikinfs and Dharma protectors (chos skyong, *dharmapala) in performing beneficial activities.

It ends (DK.A.A.6.lla,): dad 'dun gyi gang zag rnams la skye bar gyur cig//.1146 The sixth segment is identical to segment DK.A.Nga.7. The segment contains a detailed exposition of the stages of the path, which makes multiple references to Buddhist philosophical and epistemological doctrinal terms. To begin with, the individual striving for the Dharma must abandon attachment to mundane things, attachment to sarri­siiric existence in general, never give up on caring for all sentient beings, and entertain no notions of things existing as real. These qualities are achieved by contemplating death, suffering, compassion, and emptiness. With this in mind, the person develops faith in and pays respect to the bla ma and the three jewels. Although various negative tendencies have become deeply ingrained in the mind due to long habituation, delusion may be cut, as is illustrated by the three analogies of an infant (byis pa chung ngu'i dpe), a lion cub (seng ge phru gu'i dpe), and hair that seem to appear in space for a person suffering from cataract (rah rib can gyi nam mkha 'i skra shad kyi dpe). Perceptions (snang ba, *avabhasa) and the mind (sems, *citta) should be understood as being inseparable, which is illustrated by the three analogies of water and ice (chu dang chab ram gyi dpe), sandal wood and its fragrance (tsan dan dang dri'i dpe), and musk and its fragrance (gla rtsi da ng dri'i dpe). Dharmakaya pervades all percepti ons, as illustrated by the three analogies of oil found in sesame seed (til la mar gyis khyab pa'i dpe), silver found in silver ore (dngul rdo la dgnul), and butter found in milk ('o ma la mar gyis khyab pa'i dpe). Perceptions appear while they do not truly exist, comparable to smoke (du ba), clouds (sprin), and fog (khug sna). They appear dependently on various causes and conditions, as compared to reflections in a mirror (me long gi gzugs brnyan), the moon reflected in water (chu nang gi zla ba), and the analogy of a precious jewel (nor bu rin po che'i dpe). Thus, though unreal, perceptions appear to the deluded mind like dreams, being mental projections. This is what is meant by the relative (kun rdzab, *sal!lvrti), where the image of an object-generality (don spyi'i rnam pa, *arthasdmiJ.nyakara) comes to be viewed as constituting a real object (yul, *vi�aya). With such understanding, the practitioner enters into the practice of Secret Mantra (gsang sngags, *guhyamantra), becoming matured by receiving empowerment and blessing 1146 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.90b1-93b2, DK.B.A.6.9arl l a1, DK.D.A.6.9brl lb3, DK.Q.A.6.422b3-425b2 (double pagination 424 and 425 on a single folio), DK.R.A.6.1 5as-18b6, DK.S.A.6.15b2-19a+, DK.T.A.6.9b-l lb, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The practice gives rise to the three meditative experiences of bliss, presence, and non-thought (bde gsal mi rtog), which in turns produces conviction (yid ches, *sm1ipratyaya), trust (dad pa, *fraddha), and devotion (gus pa, *bhakti). Relying on these, the practitioner becomes able to sustain the practice for a long time. Thereby, many ascetic qualities of shaking off (sbyangs pa'i yon tan, *dhutagur:ta)1147 appear in body and mind. The vital force (srog, *prti�ia) enters the central channel (dhU ti, *avadhati), by force of which the five signs (rtags Inga) and the eight benefits (phan yon brgyad) emerge. All the forms of meditative bliss (bde ba, *sukha) that are felt in the body and the mind belong to tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *iamatha), whereas the five signs and eight benefits amount to the union of tranquility and insight (zhi !hag zung 'brel). When the meditation has achieved rest without the slightest distraction, the first level of meditative absorption (bsam gtan dang po, *prat hamadhyana) has been attained and this constitutes the actual practice of meditation (dngos gzhi, *maula). Meditation (sgom pa, *bhavana) may thus be explained as the joy of meditation (bsam gtan gyi dga' ba, *dhyanananda) that is perceived by direct bodily cognition (lus kyi rnam par shes pa'i mngon sum). At this point, the bla ma introduces the student to the direct percepti on (mngon sum, *pratyak�ti) of the mind's emptiness (sems kyi stong nyid, *cittasunyata) and the mind is ascertained as being unborn (skye med, *nirjata or *anutpanna). If the student is unable to ascertain this correctly, which is called \"appearing yet not ascertained\" (snang la ma nges pa), he will enter the non-analytic cessation (so sor brtags min gyi 'gag pa, *apratisa1Jikhyanirodha) and following the mundane path will block the possibility of further rebirth. If, however, recognition and certainty (nges pa) is brought about, he attains a direct realization (mngon sum, *pratyak�a) of non-conceptual emptiness (rtog pa dang bra! ba'i stong nyid, *nirvikalpasunyatii,). At this juncture, two quotations are given from the bla ma (here referring to Mi la ras pa) and Atifa (Jo bo rje) to illustrate what a lack of realization looks like . If the practitioner realizes that all phenomena are contained within the nature of the mind and that the nature of the mind is non-duality , dharmakaya, then he achieved realization of the nature of all phenomena. A scriptural quotation is cited to illustrate this point. The realization of the true nature of the mind (sems kyi chos nyid, *cittadharmata) constitutes what is called the unbound vow (zag pa med pa'i sdom pa) or the direct realization of the first bodhisattva level (sa dang po, *prathamabhumi). This is what is called 'reliable' [cognition] (tshad ma, *pramar:ta). Another scriptural quotation is given to described the non-conceptual nature of self-awareness (rang rig rtog pa med pa). When the yogf realizes the inner nature of the mind, he automatically realizes the outer nature of phenomena as well, and that is what is called direct yogic cognition (rnal 'byor gyi mngon sum, *yogipraktyak�a). This nature is known as the original knowledge (dang po shes pa, *adifnana) and the natural mind (tha 1147 See fn. 577."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"510 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um mal gyi shes pa, �priikrtajniina). It is this direct seeing of the emptiness that is the nature of the inherently pure mind, dhannakiiya, the state of truth. Although realization thereof has only just begun, it is now on its way, as illustrated by the analogies of the new moon (zla ba ts hes pa), a lion cub (seng ge phru gu), and an infant (byis pa chung ngu'i dpe). The meditator experiences this by placing the mind in a non­artificial state and repeatedly ascertaining the nature of what is being perceived. Yet, he should not regard it as a virtue to be able to rest for a long time therein or that the state should remain unperturbed, because if he does so the meditation itself turns into a meditation of bondage ('ching ba'i bsam gtan). The nature of the mind is strictly speaking an uncontrived mind (sems ma bcos pa). The attainment of such realization is without arising or ceasing, present at all times, uninterrupted, unchanging, and all-pervading. It cannot be adequately expressed by anyone. The meditation does not involve any focus or effort at the outset, does have any resting point in the middle, and is without any thought of arrogance at the end. Never being separated from the experience of the co-emergent, the non-binding bliss becomes uninterrupted, whereby the body and the mind become fluid, and the yogf attains the ascetic quality of shaking off (sbyangs pa'i yon tan, *dhittagu�ia). Never becoming separated from the resolve of Awakening, motivated by kindness and compassion, he realizes the union of method and insight. The segment ends with the prayer: May the meditative experience instructed by the genuine bla ma and cultivated by oneself arise in those who persevere with faith and striving! The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.A.7: The segment begins (DK.A.A.7.1 la1): /lbla ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ bskyed rims la brtan pa chung ngu thob pa nil. It ends (DK.A.A.7. l la4): gsang ba'i drod sems nyid spros bral nam mkha' lta bur rtogs pa 'byung gsung//.1148 This is a short segment that explains three levels of attainment of stability (brtan pa, *dhrti) in the Tantric practices of the Generation Stage (bskyed rims, *utpattikrama) and the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim, *sa7J1pattikrama). In brief, the practitioner who has attained a small degree of stability in the Generation Stage will see himself as the deity , understanding the five aggregates (phung po lnga, *paiicaskandha) in their real nature to be the five buddhas Vairocana, etc. The yogf who has attained a middling degree will see all beings just as he sees himself [as the deity]. The one with a high degree of stability will see himself and others as being like illusions, dreams, or rainbows. The practitioner who has attained stability in the Completion Stage will successively experience the levels of heat (drod, u�man), including outer heat, inner heat, and secret heat. Correspondingly, he will no longer feel his body, no longer feel the movement of breath, and will realize the mind to be free from all conceptual entanglement (spros bral, ni�prapanca), like space. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.A.8: The segment begins (DK.A.A.8.11 a5): /yang rin po che 'i zhal nas/ spyir thos pa'i shes rab kyis chos thams cad go yul du byed/.

The explanation on the insight of cultivating contains brief definitions of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *§amatha) and insight meditation (lhag mthong, *vipasyana). It also explains the meditative process through the analogy of tying the wild elephant (glang po che smyon pa) of the mind to the post of the meditative focus (dmigs pa, *iilamhana) with the rope of awareness (dran pa, *smriti). Thereupon, the segment lays out the stages of accomplishments in the framework of the five paths (lam Inga, *pancamarga), i.e., the path of gathering the requisites (tshogs lam, *sm?ihharamarga), the path of preparation (shyor lam, *prayogamarga), etc. At the highest level, consciousness (rnam par shes pa, *vijnana), which is the seed of existence (srid pa'i sa hon, *hhavabfja), ceases and dharmakaya, great bliss, is actualized. It is said that this is the explanation given in accordance with the treatises of the Paramita path (pha rol tu phyin pa'i lam gyi gzhung). Thereupon, the segment briefly presents the stages of the path according to the Secret Mantra tradition (gsang sngags). It draws a theoretical comparison between these two approaches, which is supported with a scriptural quotation from an unnamed Tantra depicting a dialogue between the Buddha and MafijusrI. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.A.9: The segment begins (DK.A.A.9.12a2): //yang rin po che'i zhal nas/ phyag rgya chen po don gsum pa nil. It ends (DK.A.A.9.12b2): /p hyag rgya chen po don gsum pa'o//.1150 The ninth segment explains Mahamudra as the \"third meaning\" (don gsum pa), signifying Mahamudra as the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa). The meaning of Mahamudra is laid out with a series of explanatory terms. Thereupon, the segment instructs that in order to realize Mahamudra the practitioner must begin by visualizing himself as the deity. During the daytime, he should then meditate on the hla ma above his head, while during the night he should meditate on the hla ma sitting on a lotus having eight petals in his heart center. By melting together with the hla ma, the yogf should let his mind rest in its natural state. This is called to rest in non-observation (mi dmigs pa, *anupalahdhi) and non-cognition (yid la mi hyed pa, *amanasikara). In this manner, all arising thoughts are turned into the meditation. From time to time, the practitioner should additionally meditate on the channels and winds (rtsa rlung) in order to enhance the practice. The segment has no colophon . 1149 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.93bs-94b2, DK.B.A.8.11 a5-12a1, DK.D.A.8.11b6-l2b4, DK.Q.A.8.425b5-426bz, DK.R.A.8.1 9a5-20bs, DK.S.A.8.l9b3-2la3, DK.T.A.8.l lb-12b, Phyag chen mdzadvol.

The segment starts by presenting what is to be abandoned (spang bya, *varjayitavya) on the path and what is to be cultivated (blang bya, *grhftavya). This expl anation is given in a rather technical manner by laying it out through the Abhidharmic framework of the four conditions known as the causal condition (rgyu rkyen, *hetupra­tyaya) , the governing condition (bdag po'i rkyen, *adhipatipraty aya), the focal condition (dmigs pa'i rkyen, *alambanapratyaya), and the immediately preceding condition (de ma thag pa'i rkyen, *samanantarapratyaya). The governing condition involves relying on a spiritual teacher (dge ba'i bshes gnyen, *kalya!Jwnitra) and the segment explains that the teacher may either be a person (gang zag), a teaching (bka}, a perception (snang ba), or knowledge (rig pa) . The qualifications of the teacher as a person are briefly explained. The focal condition is non-delusion and the segment presents its features as insight within the sub-topics of the four buddha-bodies (sku, *kaya). It is also explained how the practitioner should develop insight by practicing meditation. A short explanation of the correct sitting position for meditation is given, along with a short outline of how to foster the insights of listening, understanding, and cultivation during the meditation session. The immediately preceding condition here refers to the state of buddhahood that is achieved through insight. The notion of Buddha is then taught in the context of seeking refuge (skyabs su 'gro ba, *fara�iagamana) in the three jewels and the six perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa, *piiramita). Having listed the causes and results of the path, the segment teaches its stages in the form of the five paths (lam Inga, *pancamarga), detailing the steps of realization. It also presents the path via the thirty-seven factors of Awakening (byang chub kyi phyogs kyi chos sum cu rtsa bdun, *saptatri1?1fad bodhipak0ya dharma�1), which are listed with brief definitions. The segment ends with a discussion of insight and the role played by thoughts (rnam rtog, *vikalpa) on the path and how to treat them. The segment has no colophon.

To this, the Miidhyamikas reply\" \"Your ultimate (don dam, *paramiirtha) is our relative (kun rdzob, *sm?ivrti),\" meaning that the Miidhyamikas (here following the view of Santarak�ita's Madhyamakiilm71kiira, the most popular Madhyamaka treatise in Tibet at the time) assert all phenomena to be mind only on the relative level. The Miidhyamikas add the satirical comparison that this means that \"your mother (a ma) is our wife (chung ma).\" For the Miidhyamikas, the ultimate is without any claim involving the four extremes of existence, non-existence, both, or neither. A reply to this position is then put forth by the followers of the Piiramitii tradition (pha rol tu phyin pa), presenting a consequential counterargument (thal 'gyur, >rprasmiga). The Piiramitii adherents argue against the Miidhyamikas that it would not be tenable to make any doxographical claim even on the relative level, such as that of the Cittamiitra view. Instead, the Piiramita followers state that the present moment of consciousness (shes pa skad cig ma 'di) is entirely without defining characteristics (mtshan nyid med pa) and the proper philosophical position is one of complete non-observation (mi dmigs pa, *anupalabdhi). At this point, the followers of Secret Mantra (gsang sngags pa, *guhyamantrika) join the debate and argue that their positions agrees with and yet surpasses each of the preceding traditions, i.e., the Cittamiitra, Madhyamaka, and Paramita. It is shortly explained how this may be the case. For example, regarding the Cittamiitra view, the Secret Mantra followers also asserts that the wisdom of self-awareness is beyond conceptuality and that it is present in the mind of the Buddha, but he further asserts -unlike the Cittamiitra -that such self­awareness does not have ultimate existence and is unborn. Moreover, the Secret Mantra system exceeds the Madhyamaka based on the farmer's significance given to meditative experiences (nyams myong, *anubhiiva) and it exceeds the Piiramitii tenets in terms of the special Tantric approach of ascertaining the nature of the mind on the basis of meditative expenence. A particular feature of the Secret Mantra system is its possession of special methods (thabs, *upiiya), namely the yoga of Inner Heat (gtum mo, *cii!1tfali). Moreover, it is characterized by insight (shes rab, *prajiiii), referring to knowledge without birth (skye ba med pa'i rig pa), a path without ceasing ('gag pa med pa'i lam), insight without abiding (gnas pa med pa'i shes rab), and a result without attainment (thob pa med pa'i 'bras bu). The successful practice of Inner Heat gives rise to good qualities in the form of the five signs (rtags lnga) and the eight benefits (phan yon brgyad). The segment here lists the five signs as: (1) smoke-like (du ba lta bu), (2) mirage-like (smig rgyu lta bu), (3) fire-fly-like (srin bu me khyer lta bu), (4) candle-flame-like (mar me lta bu), and cloudless-sky-like (sprin med pa'i nam mkha' lta bu). It lists the eight benefits as: (1) the ability of the body to hold together by means of the earth element (sa yis lus zungs thub), (2) the ability to lubricate by means of the water element (chu yis snum), (3) the arising of heat by means of the fire element (me yis drod skye), (4) [bodily] lightness and movement by means of the air element (rlung gis yang zhing g.yo ), (5) having not sensation of existence by means of the space element (nam mkhas yod par mi tshor), ( 6) [to gain] luster and clarity by means"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"514 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum of the moon (zla bas mdangs gsal), (7) to become invisible to others by means of the sun (nyi mas gzhan gyis mi mthong), and (8) to become unimpeded by anything by means of the combination of all the above benefits (thams cad kun sun po'i phan yon ci la yang thogs rdugs med pa). Finally, the segment teaches how afflictive emotions (nyon mongs pa, klefa) exist in the form of wind and that such afflictions cease when the winds are made to enter into the central channel. At that point, the practitioner can no longer by harmed by ghosts (yi dwags, *preta) or by diseases caused by the four elements ('byung bzhi'i nad).

It ends (DK.A.A. l 2. l 8a3): /dge ba bcu dang du !en pa de yin no//.1153 The segment first teaches the three hindrances (sgrib pa, *avara!w) for Awakening, namely the cognitive hindrance (shes bya'i sgrib pa, *'jneyavarm:ia), the afflictive hindrance (nyon mongs pa'i sgrib pa, *klesavarm:za), and the hindrance of actions (las kyi sgrib pa, *karmavarm:za). The different manners in which these hindrances are suc­cessively to be purified are presented according to the Bka' gdams pa tradition and accord­ing to the approach of Bia ma Mi la. Followers of the Bka' gdams pa undertake their purification in the order in which the hindrances are listed above, whereas Mi la ras pa taught that the cognitive hindrance is to be purified first. The segment agrees with both of these positions as valid alternatives. A scriptural quotation is then given from the Sm7idhinirmocanasutra, describing how the appropriating consciousness (Zen pa'i rnam par shes pa, *adanavijnana) is profound and subtle, and accumulates all seeds (sa bon, *blja). The textual passage is commented upon in some detail. Having explained the functioning of consciousness in accordance with the Yogacara view, the segment goes on to present the path of Awakening and the removal of the hindrances according to this view. The segment ends with a short explanation of the purification of the hindrances according to the Secret Mantra tradition, where reference is made to the notions of radiance ('od gsal, *prabhasvara), the interim (bar do, *antara­bhava), as well as to the four powers of purification (stabs bzhi).

A notion of being 'unmistaken' (ma nor ba) is then introduced, stressing the need for meeting an unmistaken teacher (bla ma ma nor ba), encountering an unmistaken teaching (chos ma nor ba), practicing an unmistaken path (lam ma nor ba), and attaining an umistaken result ('bras bu ma nor ba). The segment then lays out the stages of such a path in brief. It begins with the contemplations of impermanence (mi rtag pa, *anitya) and the shortcomings of saf!1sara ('khor ba'i nyes dmigs, *smJisaradznava), followed by cultivation of the attitudes of kindness (bymns pa, *maitrl), compassion (snying rje, *karu(ia), and the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta). Next, the practitioner gathers the requisite of beneficence (bsod nams kyi tshogs, *pu(lyasw?ibhara), meditates on the Generation Stage (bskyed rim, *utpattikrama), and does recitations (bzlas pa, *japa). He meditates on all outer perceived objects as being unreal like dreams, and on the inner perceiving mind as being real (bden pa, *satya) yet unborn , unceasing, and unchanging. Next, the difference between the mind of a sentient being and of a Buddha is discussed as consisting in whether or not the nature of the mind has been realized. Finally, a short presentation of the nature of the mind is given, with particular focus on the non-duality of the mind (sems, *citta) and thoughts (rtog pa, *vikalpa), and on the mind's nature as being radiance ('od gsal ba, *prabhasvara). It is also taught in brief how a meditator should rest in this nature with faith, diligence, and devotion, perfecting the practice over a long period of time. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.A.14: The segment begins (DK.A.A.14.19as): /yang rin po che sgam po pa'i zhal nas/ nga la blta rgyu sems nyid gcig pu las med/. It ends (DK.A.A.14.19b1) with the colophon: llphyogs bcu'i rgyal ba kun gyi sku gsung thugs/ /yon tan 'phrin las kun gyi sras gcig pu/ !khams gsum 'gro ba'i dpal mgon sgam po pa'i/ lbka' 'bum dpag bsam ljon shing legs par rdzogs//.1155 The segment consists of a short saying of just five sentences attributed to Sgam po pa, the precious one (rin po che sgam po pa). The saying defines Sgam po pa's view (!ta ba, *dar§ana) as only pertaining to the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittat a), which is like space (nam mkha' !ta bu). The meditation (sgom pa, *bhavana) is the vivid experience thereof (gsal bar nyams su myong ba). The conduct (spyod pa, *carya) is to act without doing any 'action' while not becoming separated from this experience. The result ('bras bu, \"\"phala) is to become fully acquainted therewith. Following the saying, the segment ends with a textual colophon (cited in Tibetan above) consisting of a four-line verse: \"This is the good end of the manifold sayings (bka' 'bum), a wish-fulfilling tree, by Sgam po pa, the glorious protector of the three realms, the only son of all the bodies, speech, mind, qualities, and activities of the Victorious Ones (rgyal ba, *jina) of the ten directions.\" The colophon describes that the end of present segment 1155 CoITelated passages: DK.a.Kha.lOlbn DK.B.A.14.19a5-19b1, DK.D.A.14.19b6-20a2, DK.Q.A.14.433as-433b1, DK.R.A.14.33a6-33bs, DK.S.A.14.33b4-34a2, DK.T.A.14.19b-20n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Since the colophon only marks the end of the compilation without any indication of the compilation's beginning, it opens up a question of the compilation's extent, i.e., how many of the text passages or segments preceding this colophon should be understood as being included in the compilation. Given that the term \"manifold sayings\" or \"collected works\" (bka' 'bum) is used, it is clear that the colophon refers to more than a single segment, i.e., to more than segment D K.A.A.13. It is possible to interpret the extent of the compilation as covering the whole of text DK.A.A or even as spanning a larger part of the 1520-xylograph DK.A up to this point. Comparison with the earlier handwritten manuscript DK.a may to some extent help to clarify this question. First of all, the series of segments that constitute text DK.A.A in the 1520-xylograph are likewise found in the same series in manuscript a (DK.a.Kha.83b6-10lb3). However, in manuscript DK.a, the series of segments has no overall title at the beginning as seen in DK.A.A (Chas rje dags po lha rje'i gsungl bslab gsum rnam bzhag la sags pa). Also, manuscript DK.a does not contain the above-cited colophon found at the end of the present segment in the 1520-xylograph (DK.A.A.13). Since the colophon is not attested by manuscript DK.a, it either suggests that the colophon is specific to the 1520-xylograph or that it was incorporated into the 1520-xylograph from an earlier source other than manuscript DK.a. The first alternative that the colophon was created specifically for the 1520-xylograph is illogical, since the xylograph does not end at this point but continues with further texts. The subsequent texts are likewise attributed to Bsod nams rin chen and it would consequently be senseless to refer to this point of the xylograph as constituting the end of the compilation (bka' 'bum). The second alternative is that the colophon was created in an earlier source for the series of segments that make up text DK.A.A in the 1520-xylograph, referring to those as a compilation (bka' 'bum) of Sgam po pa's sayings. This mini-corpus carries the name \"The Wish-Fulfilling Tree\" (dpag bsam ljon shing, *kalpavrk�a) or it is characterized as such. In this regard, it should be noted that the general order of segments overall in manuscript DK.a differs starkly from the text arrangement found overall in the 1520-xylograph. Likewise, an earlier non-extant archetype for the 1520-xylograph, to which the colophon may be ascribed, did probably not exhibit the text arrangement of the 1520-xylograph. Hence, in conclusion, it may be hypothesized that the colophon marking the end of the compilation (bka' 'bum) refers only to the compilation of the fourteen segments that now make up text DK.A.A, being a series of fourteen segments that also are found in the same order in manuscript DK.a. It should though be stressed that the hypothesis has the caveat that the concrete text arrangement of this non-extant archetype is unknown and that the beginning of the said compilation consequently cannot be known with certainty.

The colophon starts by saying (cited in Tibetan above): \"01!1 svasti! There are three successions of bla ma lineages for this compilation of manifold sayings (bka' 'bum) - a wish-fulfilling tree that satisfies the hopes and aspirations of all beings, like a king of all wish-fulfilling jewels - [containing the sayings] of the Dhamw master, the protector Candraprabha Kumara (zla 'od gzhon nu), who is highly renowned under that name.\" The beginning of the longer colophon thus characterizes the compilation of sayings (bka' 'bum) as being those spoken by the Dharma master Candraprabha Kumara, i.e., Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen. Thereupon, the segment carries on by listing three transmission lineages. The first transmission lineage is described as \"the lineage of the multiple spoken cycles of teachings on the two stages of the Secret Mantra Vajrayiina [tradition]\" (gsang sngags rdo rje theg pa'i rim pa gnyis kyi skor mang du gsungs pa'i brgyud pa). The lineage teachers of this transmission are then listed: (1) Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang) and the Wisdom :Qakin1 (ye shes mkha' 'gro ma, *jfiiinarjiikinf); (2) the great man, the emanation, lord Tailopa (tai lo pa); (3) the great scholar Naropa (nii ro pa); (4) the master, the great one of Lho brag valley (lho brag pa), (i.e., Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros); (5) the great Bla ma Mi la ras pa; (6) the protector Candraprabha Kumara (zla 'ad gzhon nu) (i.e., Bsod nams rin chen); (7) Sangs rgyas sgom pa; (8) the two nephews (khu dbon gnyis, literally \"the uncle and nephew\", i.e., Tshul khrims snying po and Shes rab Byang chub); (9) the glorious Dus gsum mkhyen pa (i.e., the first Karma pa, 1110-1193); from him the succession continues in the following stages: (10) the protector of beings the great Ras pa ('Gro mgon Ras chen, 1148-1218); (11) the bodhisattva (rgyal sras, *jinaputra) Sporn brag pa [Bsod nams rdo rje] (1170-1249); (12) the Mahiisiddha (grub chen) Karma Pak$i (the second Karma pa, 1204-1283); (13) the siddha (grub thob) U rgyan pa [Rin chen dpal] (1230- 1309) and Ela ma Snyan ras [Dge 'dun 'bum]; (14) the Dharma master Rang byung rdo rje (the third Karma pa, 1284-1339); (15) Rgyal ba G.yung ston [Rdo rje dpal] (1296-1376) and Rtogs ldan Mgon po [Ye shes] rgyal mtshan (dates unknown); (16) Dhanna master Rol pa'i rdo rje (the fourth Karma pa, 1340-1383); (17) Rtogs ldan Mkha' spyod dbang po (the second Zhwa 1156 Correlated passages: DK.B.A.15.19b1-20as, DK.D.A.15.20ar20b5, DK.Q.A.15.433b1-434a4, DK.R.A.15.33bs-35a6, DK.S.A.15.34ar35as, DK.T.A.15.20n-20b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The segment's listing of this lineage ends by stating that the latter teacher gave this oral transmission joyfully, presumably thereby transmitting it to the person who created the written compilation (bka' 'bum) in question. It is notable that the listed lineage mainly pertains to the Karma Karri tshang tradition of the Bka' brgyud school. The second transmission lineage is listed as: (1) Buddha Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang); (2) [Bodhisattva] Ratnamati (Blo gros rin ch en); (3) Savari Dbang phyug (sha ba ri dbang phyug); (4) Maitripa (mai tri pa); (5) Mar pa; (6) Mi la ras pa; and (7) Dags po Iha rje [Bsod nams rin chen]. Though the segment does not clarify which instruction was passed through this lineage, it would seem that the lineage pertains to the special Mahamudra lineage of Maitripa. The third transmission lineage consists of a complex of four different teaching transmis­sions known as \"the Four Instruction Lineages\" (bka' babs bzhi'i brgyud pa). The Four Instruction Lineages refer to four Tantric transmissions that were gathered by the Indian master Tilopa (a.k.a. Tailopa) from a number of gurus. (I) The first transmission is listed as follows: (1) Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang); (2) Ratnamati (blo gros rin chen); (3) Acarya Nagarjuna[garbha] (slob dpon klu sgrub); (4) Matailgi (ma tang gi pa); (5) Tailopa (tai lo pa); (6) Naropa (na ro pa); (7) Mar pa; (8) Mi la; and (9) Snyi sgom [Bsod nams rin chen]. The segment does not provide any further information about this transmission, but the list of gurus is generally speaking the one that is associated with the instruction on the Five Stages (rim lnga, *paficakrama) of the Father Tantras (pha rgyud), which involve the yogas of Transference ('pho ba, *sarrikranti) and Body-Entering (grong 'jug, *puraprave§a). (II) The second transmission is stated as: (1) Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang); (2) Vajrapani (phyag na rdo rje); (3) the Great Briihmm;,a Saraha (bram ze chen po sa ra ha pa); (4) Luipa (lu hi pa); (5) Qingipa (<;ling gi pa); (6) Tailopa (tai lo pa); (7) Mar pa; (8) Mi la; and (9) the precious Dharma master [Bsod nams rin chen] (chos kyi rje rin po che). This seems to refer to the instruction on the Mahamudra practice of the Tantras. (III) The third guru lineage is listed in the segment as: (1) Po1Jibhi Heruka (<;iorri bhi he ru ka); (2) Birvapa (bir ba pa); (3) Kambala (la ba pa); and (4) Indrabodhi the younger (indra bo dhi chung ba). This probably refers to the transmission for the instructions on the yogas of Radiance ('od gsal, *prabhasvara), Dream (rmi lam, *svapna), and Illusory Body (sgyu lus, *mayadeha). (IV) The fourth lineage is: (1) Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang); (2) Sumati Samantabhadri (su ma ti kun tu bzang mo); (3) Thanglopa (thang lo pa); (4) Kan:i.aripa (kar �ia ri ba); (5) Tailopa (tai lo pa); (6) Naropa (na ro pa); (7) Mar pa; (8) Mi la; (9) the Dharma master Bsod nams rin chen ; (10) Tshul khrims snying po; (11) Khams pa dbu se (i.e., the first Karma pa Dus gsum mkhyen pa); (12) 'Gro mgon ras pa chen po; (13) Pong brag pa (i.e., 1157 It may be recalled in relation to this book's study of hagiographies that Mkha' spyod dbang po was the author of the Large Hagiography (Rnam thar chen mo) of Bsod nams rin chen."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 519 Sporn brag pa); (14) Karma pa (i.e., Karma Pak�i); (15) U rgyan pa; (16) Snyan ras; (17) Rang byung ba (the third Karma pa); (18) Rgyal G.yung mgon rgyal ba; (19) (Karma pa) Rol pa'i rdo rje; (20) Zhwa dmar pa [Mkha' spyod dbang po]; (21) [Karma pa] De bzhin gshegs pa (1384-1415); (22) La phyi ba [Mdog ston Nam mkha' rgyal mtshan] (15t h century); and (23) Bla ma Chos rin pa (15th century). This seems to be the transmission of the instructions on the yogas of the Mother Tantras (ma rgyud), namely Inner Heat (gtum mo, *cO.(u/iilf), the Interim (bar do, *antarabhava), and Sexual Union (las kyi phyag rgya, *karmarnudra). It should be underlined that the segment does not name the actual instructions related to each lineage, aside from giving the general designation \"the Four Instruction Lineages\" (bka' bahs bzhi'i brgyud pa).1158 Otherwise, the segment only refers to these as 'traditions' (lugs). It may also be added that the name \"the Four Instruction Lineages\" (bka' bahs bzhi) is traditionally said to form the etymological basis for the later Tibetan name Bka' brgyud (\"the transmission of the [four] instruction [lineages]\", i.e., bka' bahs bzhi'i brgyud pa), which became the general name for Bsod nams rin chen's lineage in the later Tibetan tradition. The segment ends with the short printer's colophon of the 1520 xylograph. 6. 31 DK.A.Ki: Sayings of the Dharma Master, the Doctor from Dags po: Instruction on the Twofold Nature and Instruction on the Two Armors (Chos rj e dags po lha rj e 'i gsungl gnas lugs gnyis kyi man ngag dang go cha gnyis kyi man ngag bzhugs so) 29 folios, 27 segments, 9 colophons. The title given to the text in the 1520 xylograph (DK.A) suggests that the twenty-seven segments of the text form two overall cycles of instructions. The first cycle, entitled Instruction on the Twofol d Nature (Gnas lugs gnyis kyi man ngag), consists of segments 1-14. These segments contain Tantric yoga instructions that fundamentally are concerned with meditational practices focused on \"the nature of things\" (dngos po'i gnas lugs, *mulaprakrti). The nature of things is a term derived from the Yoga manual Ka dpe, wherein the nature (gnas lugs, *prakrti) is presented with respect to the body (!us) and the mind (sems), thus forming a twofold nature (gnas lugs gnyis). Accor­dingly, segments 1-14 provide teachings on the yoga of Inner Heat (gtum mo), the cakras and channels, the yogas of Illusory Body (sgyu !us) and Radiance ('ad gsal), meditation on the ultimate nature, explanations on the four buddha bodies, instructions on Awakening in the process of dying ('chi ka) and the interim (bar do), and the yoga of Transference ('pho ba). The second cycle, entitled Instruction on the Two Armors (Go cha gnyis kyi man ngag), consist of segments 15-27. The cycle presents a series of contemplative sayings, most of which are concerned with Mahamudra. The first few segments deal with the so-called two 1 tss For the Four Instruction Lineages with some minor difference in naming the gurus in each transmission, see KRAGH (201la:132)."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"520 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum armors (go cha gnyis) that must be adopted to guard the practice, namely the armor of the view (lta ba'i go cha) and the armor of insight (shes rah kyi go ch a). Several of the segments discuss how thoughts should be made part of the path (rtog pa lam du 'khyer ha). Some of the segments are written in the form of notes and give short definitions of various contemplative terms. Other treated topics include the stages of the Secret Mantra path and motivational advice. The text ends with a homage to the teacher, which is said to have been composed by Bsod nams rin chen's older nephew Dags po Sgom tshul. Segment DK.A.Ki.1: The segment begins (DK.A.Ki. l.lb1): /bla ma rin chen !ta bu yil lzhabs kyi padmo la btud de/. It ends (DK.A.Ki.1.3a1) with the colophon: /gtum mo dgu bskor gyi zhal gdams lags so/.1159 After a six-line verse of homage to the bla ma and the non-dual reality, the segment starts by directly quoting the first thirteen lines of the \"Inner Heat Instruction Text\" (gtum mo'i ka dpe) said to contain the yoga transmission of Naropa.1160 The cited lines describe how Naropa received a prophecy telling him to find and rely on Tailopa as his guru. He went east, found Tailopa, and requested instruction. Concer­ning the Generation Stage, he learned what is termed \"the nature of things\" (dngos po'i gnas lugs, *miilaprakrti), the path (lam, *miirga), and the result ('bras bu, *phala). The nature of things is first explained in relation to the body (lus, *deha), presented under the five headings: (1) the fivefold Awakening (byang chub rnam Inga), (2) the chan­nels (rtsa), (3) bodhicitta (byang chub sems), (4) unclean substances (mi gtsang rdzas), and (5) thought (rnam rtog).1161 Following the quotation of these lines from the Ka dpe, the segment explains the nature of things (dngos po'i gnas lugs) pertaining to the mind (rang sems). This is accomplished through quotation of two well-known passages from songs and works by Tailopa. The path (lam, *miirga) is the presented in terms of the Generati on Stage (bskyed rim) and the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim) with brief mention of their subdivisions. Next, the segment lays out the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo) and its result by presenting three key points (gnad), paraphrasing the corresponding verses on these points from the Gtum mo'i ka dpe.1162 The first is the key point of the body (lus kyi gnad), which covers explanations on the right body posture for the yoga exercise and the fourfold breathing technique (rlung sbyor) constiting of inhaling (rngub, *iisviisa), holding (dgang, *bhara), releasing (gzhil ba, 1159 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.15a1-16a3, DK.B.Ki.l.lb1-3a1, DK.D.Ki.l.lb1-3b2, DK.Q.Ki. l.434as-435b3, DK.R.Ki.1.1 b1-4as, DK.S.Ki. l.lb1-4b2, DK.T.Ki.1.1 b-3b, Phyag ehen mdzod vol.

The second is the key point of the object (yul gyi gnad) , namely outer objects (phyi), the four wheels ('khor lo, *cakra) within, and the manner in which concepts subside (rnam par rtog pa ngang gi 'gag). The third is the key point of time (dus gnad). Time is divided into the phases that are marked by the changing of the strength of the breath from the right side to the left side and vice versa. These phases are listed as sleep (gnyid, *nidra), dream (rmi lam, *svapna), meditative absorption (snyoms 'jug, *samiipatti), and the natural state (tha mal, prakrta). Each state is associated with a specific yogic practice focused on a particular cakra. In conclusion , the segment lays out the signs and stages of the accomplishment of the practice. The segment ends with the brief colophon (quoted in Tibetan above): \"This was the Instruction on the Cycle of the Nine [Aspects] of Inner Heat.\" Segment DK.A.Ki.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Ki.2.3a7): Ina mo gu ru/ de nas dngos po'i gnas lugs la gnyis tel.

These are verses dealing with the nature of things (dngos po 'i gnas lugs) of the body (lus) and of the mind (sems). The nature of the body is again explained through five points. (1) The fivefold Awake­ning (byang chub rnam Inga) presents the stages of embryology and their relation to visualization steps of generating the deity in the framework of the five complete Awake­nings (mngon par byang chub pa, *abhis017ibodhi). (2) The channels (rtsa) are explained with reference to the four wheels ('khor lo, *cakra), the central channel, and the two side­channels. (3) The third point of bodhicitta (byang chub sems) is omitted, while (4) the fourth point of unclean substances (mi gtsang rdzas) and (5) the fifth point of thought (rnam rtog) are treated only very briefly. The nature of things with respect to the mind is presented in the form of a word-by-word commentary on the quotations from Tailopa given in segment Dk.A.Ki.!. Finally, the segment gives an abbreviated explanation of the path (lam) and the key point of the body (lus gnad). The segment ends with a short colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"Instruction on the Cycle of the Nine [Aspects] of Inner Heat.\" Segment DK.A.Ki.3: The segment begins (DK.A.Ki.3.4as): /l'khor lo drug gi gdams pa lags sol/ na mo gu rul lus dpag bsam gyi sdong po la/.

In the navel (lte ba), there is the Emanation Cakra (sprul pa'i 'khor lo, *nirmii!wcakra) having sixty-two wisdom channels as its petals. In the heart (snying ga), there is the Dharmacakra (chos kyi 'khor lo) with eight channels. In the throat, there is the Enjoyment Cakra (longs spyod kyi 'khor lo, *sa171bhogacakra) with sixteen channels. At the top of the head (spyi bo), there is the Great Bliss Cakra (bde ba chen po'i 'klwr lo, *Mahiisukhacakra) with thirty-two channels. It is said that a \"king of the mind\" (sems kyi rg yal po, *cittariijan) resides in each of these cakras, whose names are Tilaka1165 (navel), Vasantau66 (heart), the Drop of the Intellect (yid kyi thig le, *manastilaka), and the Drop of Knowledge (ye shes kyi thig le, *jfianatilaka). If the practitioner wishes to see these kings, he must unlock the door of concepts and behold the respective king's countenance, which will bring the practitioner ordinary and highest accomplishments (dngos grub, *siddhi). Each cakra is, moreover, associated with a specific key point pertaining to yogic prac­tice. Thus, the navel cakra is related to the key point of Inner Heat (gtum mo'i gnad), the throat cakra to the key point of Dream (rmi lam gyi gnad), the heart cakra to the key point of sleep (gnyid kyi gnad), and the head cakra to the key point of meditative absorption (snyoms jug, *samiipatti). Two additional bodily points are here mentioned, including the 'vajra-jewel' (rdo rje nor bu, *vajrama!ii) which usually is a Tantric euphemism for the tip of the penis, and the point between the eyebrows (smin mtshams, *bhruvor madhye). A series of interlinear notes in the segment give short explanations on all the above points. With regard to the just mentioned series of key points, the notes clarify that these key points are related to specific yoga practices. Thus, the navel cakra is the focus for the practice of Inner Heat (gtum mo). The throat cakra is the focus for the yoga of Dream (rmi lam). The heart cakra is the focal point for Radiance ('ad gsal). The cakra at the top of the head along with the vajra-j ewel are the foci for practices of 'bliss' (bde ba), probably referring to sexual union with a kannamudrii partner (las rgya). The point between the eyebrows is employed in practices dealing with sleep (gnyid). A few final remarks explain how to unlock the navel cakra in the practice of Inner Heat and behold the king of the mind residing there. The segment has no colophon.

I) describing Naropa's encounter with Tailopa and the instruction he was given on the nature of things (dngos po'i gnas lugs), the path (lam), and the result ('bras bu). To this is added a brief quotation from a GuhyasamCija text (gsang ba 'dus pa). A prose passage then presents the nature of thing (dngos po'i gnas lugs) related to the body and the mind. As for the body, an explanation is given of the three channels, their joining at the navel, and the four cakras. The Ka dpe verse presenting the five points on the body (lus) is cited. For the nature of things related to the mind, the segment quotes the same two passages from Tailopa's teachings as seen in the segment DK.A.Ki. I. To present the path (lam), the three key points of body (lus), object (yul), and time (dus) are laid out. For the body, the Ka dpe verses outlining the correct sitting position are cited at length, following by a quotation from the Cathurpf!ha (gdan bzhi) explaining six practices (sbyor ba drug). Further quotations from a Vajratjakinftext (Rdo rje mkha' 'gro), the Hevajratantra (Kyai rdo rje), and the Paficakrama (Rim lnga) of the GuhyasamCija are given to illustrate the principles of yogic Kumbaka (bum can) breathing with its four steps. The key point of the object (yul gyi gnad) is only briefly explained with reference to the four cakras, while the explanation on the key point of time (dus kyi gnad) discusses how different yogas are focused on different cakras at different times of waking, [sexual] union (snyoms 'jug, *samCipatti), sleeping, and dreaming. A quotation from the Cathurp�tha Tan­tra is given to back up the explanation. The final part gives a brief outline of the stages in which the results arise ('bras bu skye ba'i rim pa), teaching the attainments of the ordinary and highest accomplishments (dngos grub, *siddhi). The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"This was taught by Tailopa to Naropa, who taught it to Mar pa, who taught it to Bla ma Mi la, who taught it to the protector Candraprabha Kumara (zla 'od gzhon nu).

The practitioner thinks about all the happiness and suffering that he has experi enced in the past or that he experiences in the present and concludes thatthey all, no matter when they occurred, are just dreams. In this way, he forms an intensedecision and yearning to see all as dreams and to dream the dreams. Yet, it is underlined that these are no ordinary dreams (tha mal pa'i rmi lam). Rather, the dreams to be dreamt are wondrous, astounding dreams of seeing the pure Buddha lands (sangs rgyas kyi zhing khams, *buddhak�etra), seeing the faces of the meditational deities (yi dam lha'i zhal,*i�_tadevatamukha), traveling to the celestial realms (lha'i yul, *devade§a), traveling to theVajra seat [in Bodhgaya] (rdo rje gdan, *vajrasana), touring our world of Jambudvipa('dzam bu'i gling), flying through the skies (nam mkha' la 'phur ba), or dreaming that the body is consumed by fire or that one dives effortlessly under water. When a firm decision and yearning to dream in this manner has been formed throughout long time, it is bound to have an effect also in the nightly dreams while the practitioner sleeps in his bed. The second point, called \"letting the sleep come which has not yet come\" (gnyid mi 'ong ba 'ong bar bya ba), is to visualize a smooth, white ball of light, in size like the outer digit of the thumb, between the eyebrows when feeling sleepy and lying down to sleep, and then to let the consciousness merge with the ball. This needs to be done gently, since if the focus is too strong, it would prevent the yogi from falling asleep. After a while, the practitioner falls asleep and begins to dream in a habitual manner, in that the consciousness produces dreams from the impressions accrued during the daytime, comparable to the manner in which having watched some disturbing spectacle before falling asleep will produce dreams about this spectacle. The third point, called \"recognizing the dream as such\" (rmi lam la der ngo shes pa), means that the dreamer, having relied on the visualizing of the ball of light while falling asleep, needs to maintain a sufficient level consciousness in the dream state to be able to recognize whatever dreams arise as being dreams. In other words, the dreamer relies on this technique in order to enter into lucid dreaming. The fourth point, called \"multiplying\" (spel ba), is to train in lucid dreaming by multiplying the number of whatever appears in the dream, turning what appears as a single object into two objects, three objects, and so forth. When the dreamer has achieved familiarity with multiplying, he arrives at the fifth point, called \"purifying the dream\" (rmi lam sbyang ba), where the dream turns the dream into a meditation. Outer landscapes and places are to be seen as the celestial palace of the deity (zhal yas khang, *vimana), beings are turned into the deities of the 11ia1:i4ala (yi dam dkyil 'khor gyi lha tshogs) with their various body colors, hand implements, etc. All of these celestial appearances must be regarded as unreal and illusory or illusory (sgyu ma), like rainbows or the reflection of the moon in water. The dreamer should then turn the dream into meeting the deities, listening to teachings and instructions from them, and feeling that intense non-binding bliss surges in the body and makes it quiver.

It is described that such a person, due to his intense engagement in the experience of dreaming, naturally will begin to experience everything in the waking state as dreams as well. The same result may be attained, if the practice [of Illusory Body] is done by training in looking at the practitioner's reflection in a mirror (me long nang gi gzugs brnyan la bslab pa). With sustained practice, signs of perfection or 'conviction' (yid ches pa'i rt ags) will begin to arise along with visions or dreams of receiving prophecies [of spiritual attainment] from the meditational deity (yi dam lha'i lung bstan, *i�fadevatavytikara�ia). The promise issued here is backed up by a reference to the second chapter of the second section of the Hevajratantra (brtag pa phyi ma'i le'u gnyis pa), which promises buddhahood within three months and six days after having perfected the Tantric conduct (spyod pa, *carya). On the other hand, it is said that a practitioner having a lazy attitude (le lo can) is bound to attain buddhahood in the interim (bar do, *antarabhava) following his death. Such a practitioner engages in the practice of recognizing dreams during his sleep, but never becomes fully able to recognize all experiences in the waking state to be dreams as well. However, when that individual manifests the illusory body (sgyu lus) that naturally appears in the interim, he is destined to attain buddhahood. Given that such a practitioner is capable of attaining states of lucid dreaming every month of his life, he will also be able to recognize the interim of death for what it is. He will spontaneously recognize that he has died, that he has gone through the states of dissolution (thim pa) of the elements in death, which are similar to the stages of falling asleep, and that he has now appeared in the illusory body (sgyu lus) of the interim, which is no different from the mental body (yid kyi lus, *manodeha) experienced in dreams. Just like the living practitioner trained in turning the dream body into the body of the deity , the deceased practitioner will at that point be able to transform the interim body into the deity and attain the enjoyment state (longs sku, *smJ7bhogakaya) in the interim.

The bed may be soft and comfortable, and the practitioner may wear warm comfortable clothes. He should then visualize a lotus flower having four petals in the heart cakra, on the petals of which stand four syllables. In their middle is a central seed syllable.

Without losing this state of radiance, the practitioner should attempt to carry through the whole night's sleep. If he wakes up during the night and feels he has lost the state, he should repeat the meditation and go back to sleep. Once the yogf wakes up in the morning, he should repeat the visualization and again meditate for some time in the state of radiance and bliss. If the practitioner practices in this manner, he becomes able to rest in radiance without there being any difference between sleeping and being awake. The segment ends by saying that for this practice the state of dream is an adversary condition ('gal rkyen ), and hence when dreams arise, the practitioner should turn them into a suppor­tive condition (mthun rkyen) by observing the nature of the mind (sems kyi ngo bo) in the dream.

It is said that such meditation is without any conceptual proliferation (spros pa dang bra[ ba, *ni�prapafica), an expression that in Tantric practice also denotes a meditation without any visualization, mantra, or specific yogic technique. Throughout day and night, the meditator should rest in the yoga that is like the flow of a river (chu bo rgyun gyi rnal 'byor). While sitting in meditation, the yogf rests in a state that is clear and present yet non-conceptual (gsal la rtog pa med pa), knowing that what is perceived has no inherent nature (snang la rang bzhin med par shes). It is like the sun rising in the center of the empty sky. In the post-meditative phase of subsequent attainment (rjes thob, *anuprii.pta), all perceptions appear to the practitioner as hallucinations or magical illusions (sgyu ma, *mii.yii). Though they appear, there is nothing real to be perceived; all is unreal like rainbows. With such high realization, the practitioner achieves buddhahood right then and there in this physical body. This is the non-abiding nirvii.f}a of the Great Vehicle. With this achievement, he will manifest the pure enjoyment body (slang spyod rdzogs pa'i sku, *sarribl wgakiiya), in which form he will teach the Dharma [in the pure realms] to bodhisattvas who have achieved the bodhisattva levels (sa, *bhumi). He will also manifest in emanation bodies (sprul pa'i sku, *nirmiif}akiiya), in which he will teach the Dharma to sa1J1Siiric sentient beings. The segment ends by explaining that buddhahood cannot be reached by only meditating on the Generation Stage (bskyed rim). Even if the practitioner has reached the eighth bodhisattva level, he still needs to rely on a spiritual teacher (dge ba'i bshes gnyen, *kalyiif}amitra) until he has realized the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim). It is only through meditation belonging to the Completion Stage that buddhahood will be reached.

As death approaches, the dying practitioner should lie on the right side and focus the mind on one syllable after the other. This is carried out in agreement with the stages of dissolution (thim pa) of the physical elements, one into the other, which gradually takes places when dying. The bodily and inner signs of each stage are here described in the segment in fine detail. Thus, the element of earth dissolves into water, water into fire, fire into wind, wind into conscious­ness, and consciousness into radiance ( 'od gsal). If the practitioner is able to remain fully aware throughout the process by focusing the mind clearly on the visualized syllables in the navel cakra, he is able to maintain full awareness right into the natural appearance of radiance ('od gsal) that arises after the physical death. Thereby, he will achieve dharma­kaya, the absolute state. Success in the practice at death becomes achievable given the practitioner's solid familiarity with the similar visualization and dissolution process that appears in the yoga practice of the Radiance of sleep (gnyid 'od gsal).

It ends (DK.A.Ki.10.12 b3): /bar do'i gdams pa zab mo'o//.1173 The segment's title heading (cited in Tibetan above) says: \"Here is the Instruction on the Interim.\" The segment provides a very detailed teaching on the interim (bar do, *antarabhava) and advices the practitioner how to practice therein. Three phases of the interim are taught here. The first phase is the key point of recognizing radiance ('od gsal ngos bzung ba), the nature of the mind that appears right after dying, by having become proficient during one's lifetime in meditating on radiance. It is explained that radiance exists naturally within every sentient being. When a being has reincarnated into a physical body, radiance abides within that body which is made of the four physical elements. As the body dies, the physical elements dissolve one into the other and at the end of this process, consciousness (rnam par shes pa, *vijiiana) dissolves (thim pa) into light (snang ba, *aloka). This is an experience of emptiness (stong pa), whose inward sign (nang rtags) is a feeling of smoke (du ba) while the outward sign (phyi rtags) is a vision of light like seeing the moon rising. The energies or 'winds' (rlung, *vayu) in the secondary channels gather together in the two side channels and then start to become absorbed into the central channel. Thereby, the winds that make up thoughts or concepts (rnam rtog gi rlung) cease, causing thirty-three types of concepts related to anger to terminate. Since the nature of the mind thus begins to reveal itself, this phase is referred to as 'light' (snang ba, *aloka). Thereafter, the light dissolves into the phase called \"the rising [of light]\" ([snang ba] mched pa, *[aloka]vrddhi). This is an experience of deepened emptiness (shin tu stong pa), whose inward sign is a feeling like the light of a firefly and whose outward sign is a vision of an intense red light, like seeing the sun rise. At this point, the winds are increasingly absorbed into the central channel, causing forty types of concepts related to desire to terminate . Since the nature of the mind has begun to reveal itself more fully, this phase is called \"the rising\" (mched pa, *vrddhi). Next, the phase of rising dissolves into the phase called 'arrival' (thob pa, *labdha). Arrival is an experience of great emptiness (stong pa chen po), whose inward sign is a feeling like a feeble candle light and whose outward sign is a vision of deep darkness, as if everything turned black. Now the channels and their winds automatically fuse into the cen­tral channel, whereby seven moments of ignorance dissolve. This is called 'arrival', since the nature of the mind here emerges more vividly. In terms of meditative practice, these three phases are said to represent tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *iamatha). In terms of radiance, they are said to reflect the radiance experienced in meditative absorption (bsam gtan gyi 'ad gsal). Finally, the phase of 'arrival' dissolves into radiance itself ('od gsal, *prabhasvara), which is the experience of all-emptiness (thams cad stong pa). The inward sign is a feeling 1173 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.22a1-24a3, DK.B.Ki.10. 10arl2h DK.D.Ki.l0.l0<14- 12b1, DK.Q.Ki.1 0.44lb5-443b6, DK.R.Ki.10.15a6-l8b4, DK.S.Ki.10.16ai-20a3, DK.T.Ki.10.10n-12b, Phyag ch en mdzad vol.

The merging of the radiance of meditation (bsam gtan gyi 'od gsal) and the natural radiance (rang bzhin gyi 'od gsal) is what is called \"non-conceptual wisdom\" (mi rtog pa'i ye shes, *nirvikalpajffiina). In meditative terms, this is truly what is called insight meditation (!hag mthong, *vipasyana). In terms of radiance, this is what is called natural radiance (rang bzhin gyi 'od gsal). The practitioner who is able to remain therein due to his earlier familiarity therewith from having experienced it in meditation while still alive, he will not enter into the city of the interim (bar do'i grong khyer). The most talented practitioner thus achieves buddhahood in this life and produces the two form bodies (gzugs sku, *rz:tpakiiya) that appear in order to benefit other beings. This was the key point of recognizing radiance in the first interim (bar do dang po'i 'od gsal ngos bzung ba). The second phase is the key point of recognizing the illusory body (sgyu !us ngos bzung ba). In terms of the so-called impure illusory body (ma dag pa'i sgyu !us), a meditator who has practiced the path will wake up in interim at a point in time approximately three and a half days after the natural radiance first appeared. He experiences himself as having a body that appears similar to the deceased body of his former life. The segment here explains the abilities and qualities of this body . Yet, a practitioner may also appear in the interim with what is called a pure illusory body (dag pa'i sgyu !us), namely in the illusory form of a deity (lha'i sku sgyu lus) or even just in the form of a light like a rainbow ('ja' tshon !ta bu cig). Such a practitioner may meditate on radiance while being in the form of the deity or may meditate on radiance without any form. In this way, advanced practitioners of mediocre talent attain buddhahood in the interim, whereupon they manifest the form bodies that appear in order to bring benefit to others. This was the key point of recognizing the illusory body in the second interim (bar do gnyis pa sgyu !us ngos bzung ba). The third phase is the key point of blocking entrance into the womb. The parents of the deceased person's future rebirth appear to the deceased while they are having intercourse. To avoid being sucked into this vision and thereby entering into the womb of rebirth, the yogi may first try to prevent this from happening by contemplating the immense suffering of saf!!sdric rebirth and then meditate on the form of the deity or on radiance. Alternatively, he may visualize the male lover as being his guru (bla ma) and the female lover as being the guru's female partner (bla ma 'i yum), thereby avoiding any sensation of sexual arousal, anger, or jealousy. Thinking with devotion of the teacher, he can then visualize himself as the deity and meditate on radiance. Alternatively, he may attempt the same by imagining the couple having sex to be in the form of the deity in union and thereby avoid feelings of attraction and repulsion. Alternatively, he may attempt to think of the couple as being illusory, dream-like, not existing with inherent natures, a deluded perception appearing due to the mind's habitual tendencies, like the reflection of the moon in water or the reflection in a mirror. With this in mind, he again meditates on himself as the deity and then focuses on radiance. If the practitioner is successful with blocking rebirth at the end of the first week in the interim, it will be much easier to do so when a similar vision reappears at the"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"530 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum end of the second week, and so forth. In this way, he might remain in the interim for up to forty-nine days and strive to attain buddhahood in this state. If in the end he has been unable to attain buddhahood in the interim, the time has come to secure an optimal rebirth by selecting a suitable womb (mngal bsdam pa). The practitioner should visualize himself in the form of the deity and give rise to a strong wish to benefit others. Using the power thereof to select the optimal rebirth, he should seek rebirth in a supreme form like the king of the gods or like a king on earth, and strive to attain buddhahood in that life.

A necessary preliminary is first to accomplish some degree of ability in holding the breath (rlung sbyong ba) with the pot-like breathing technique (bum pa can, *kumbhaka), so that the practitioner can hold the breath for a duration from 36 up to 108 measures. Once this ability has been attained, the practitioner can begin to train in the Transference practice ('pho ba sbyong ba). Sitting in meditation posture and blocking the bodily orifices by visualizing nine sylla­bles, the yogi then visualizes a seed syllable in the navel cakra, representing the mind. The central channel rises up in the body to the top of the head. While holding the breath, the yogi then cites a mantric syllable whereby the mind-syllable is sent up through the central channel and pierces through the skull at the top of the head. Thereupon, the mind-syllable is again lowered while the yogi relaxes the mind and the breath. When the practitioner has become proficient in performing the ejection of the consciousness through the top of the body in this manner, he will be able to perform 'pho ba at death even if sixty years have gone by without practicing the technique. When the signs of dying appear, the practitioner should first attempt to prolong his life by performing a life-ransom ritual ('chi slu). If that is of no avail, then he should perform the Transference practice. The segment has no colophon.

It is explained that there are four basic conditions in which dreams may diffuse or extend ('�yams pa), leading to the problem that the practitioner is unable to control (zin pa) the dream, i.e., remain in a state of lucid dreaming. One such condition is diffusion due to delusion ('khrul 'byams), which may be overcome by firmly gathering the winds (rlung drag po bzung). A second condition is diffusion due to a stream of preceding impressions (sngar gyi rgyun la 'byams pa), which may be removed by making a firm decision to control the dreams. A third condition is diffusion due to waking up (sad 'byams), whereby the dream is interrupted once the dreamer begins to take control of it. This has to be avoided by firmly deciding not to wake up inadvertently from the dream. The fourth condition is diffusion due to forgetting to control the dream after a while, and this is again prevented by firmly deciding to keep the control of the dream. The four conditions are briefly subdivided into twelve sub-kinds and a further distinction is given between dreams that turn toward the path and dreams that do not tum toward the path. Finally, it is told that the best method for controlling dreams is to work in every meditation session with holding the breath in the pot-like breathing (bum pa can, *kumbhaka) and then to lie down to sleep while keeping the breath in the abdomen in the navel region.

The instruction (man ngag) is delivered in four points. The first point is to identify uncontrived knowledge (ma bcos pa'i ye shes ngos bzung ba), which naturally appears very briefly between moments of conceptual thought, between falling asleep and starting to dream, and between the phase when the dying body has terminated and the phase of the interim after death begins. Each of these passing phases is referred to as a kind of interim (bar do, *antarabhava), respective called the interim between subsequent moments of consciousness (shes pa snga phyi'i bar do), the interim between sleep and dream (gnyid dang rmi lam gyi bar do), and the interim of dying ('chi ba 'i bar do). The second point is to learn to rest in this uncontrived state (ma bcos pa'i ngang la gnas pa) once it has been identified, prolonging the experience. The third point is to experience everything as being of same flavor (dngos po thams cad ro mnyam pa) by utilizing the instruction of mixing what is before and what is after (snga phyi gcig tu bsre ba'i man ngag).

Finally, when everything is experienced as being of the same flavor (ro mnyam pa), the result is comparable to space ('bras bu nam mkha' !tar). The state or 'body' of great bliss (sku bde ba chen po) found in all outer and inner phenomena is realized without any act of cognition (yid la mi byed pa, *amanasikiira). This is buddhahood. It is explained that such an achievement is derived from different stages of practice. Meditation on the Generation Stage (bskyed rim) leads to the attainment of the emanation body (sprul sku, *nirmii'.lakiiya). Meditation on radiance ('od gsal) leads to realizing the dharmakiiya (chos sku). The medita­tion on union (zung 'jug, *yuganaddha) produces attainment of the enjoyment body (longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku, *sm11bhogakiiya). The realization of the three bodies as being insepa­rable (sku gsum dbyer med du rtogs pa) is the attainment of the body of great bliss (de ba chen po'i sku, *mahiisukhakiiya).

The two armors, which are the armor of the view (!ta ba'i go cha) and the armor of insight (shes rab kyi go cha), have been mentioned in passing once before in the bka' 'bum, namely in segment DK.A.Dza. l. Here, however, they make up the central theme of the text. Following a homage verse to the bla ma, it is said that the practitioner needs to cut the bonds to this life, abandon what is to be abandoned (spang bya, prahatavya), and develop what is to be developed (blang bya, pratigrhftavya). These points are briefly explained with reference to the four conditions, i.e., the causal condition (rgyu'i rkyen, *hetuprat yaya), the dominant condition (bdag po'i rkyen, *adhipatipratyaya), the focal condition (dmigs pa'i rkyen, *alambanapratyaya), and the immediately preceding condition (de ma thag pa'i rkyen, *samanantarapratyaya). The explanations thereon are partly similar to those found in segment DK.A.A.IO. To accomplish such a path, it is stated that the practitioner needs to rely on a teacher (bla ma, *guru), who may assume either of two forms. On the one hand, the teacher may appear as thoughts, and the practitioner therefore ought to regard thoughts with gratitude and utilize thoughts as the path (rtog pa lam du 'khyer ba). On the other hand, the teacher may appear as a person, who is someone capable of transforming adverse conditions, who­se wishes or prayers (gsol ba 'debs) are powerful, who is without delusion, and who is able to instill insight in the student. With these preliminary instructions in place, the text now turns to its main topic, namely the two armors. It says that the yoga of the co-emergent (lhan cig skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga) is put into practice (lam du 'khyer) by means of the two armors (go cha gnyis), being the armor of the view (lta ba'i go cha) and the armor of insight (shes rab kyi go cha). The armor of the view mean s to bring forth the right understanding of the mind in terms of four points. (1) The first is to understand the characteristics of awareness (shes pa'i mtshan nyid, *jiianalak�a(ia), seeing its non-arising as dha rmakaya (skye ba med pa chos sku), its non-ceasing as sambhogakaya ('gag pa med pa longs sku), its non-abiding as nirmti(iakaya (gnas pa med pa sprul sku), and the inexpressibility of the unity of these aspects as svabhavikakaya (ngo bo nyid kyi sku). (2) The second is to understand the special characteristics (khyad par gyi mtshan nyid, *vise�alak�m:ia) thereof, that is to say, the particular implication, namely that thoughts and ideas are not to be removed or abandoned, but that they should be understood to be part of the four buddha bodies (sku, *kaya), given that they are all mind. (3) Thirdly, the characteristics of its activity (byed pa'i mtshan nyid, *karm;.alak�a(ia) needs to understood in the manner that although realization leads to the four buddha bodies, the nature of things is nonetheless illusory, given that the things do not involve any doer or agent (byed pa po, *kartr). (4) Finally, the characteristic of the appearance [of the mind] (ngo bo nyid kyi mtshan nyid, *svabhavalak�a(ia) is explained as denoting that realization has always existed within, having the form of the four buddha bodies. All phenomena are subsumed under these four characteristics and knowing this is the armor of the view."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"534 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum The armor of insight refers to the process of realizing the view by practicing meditation. The segment first explains how to sit in the correct meditation posture. When sitting thus, the practitioner should bring forth the right motivation of bodhicitta. Then he should observe the mind with insight and pronounce the following words out loud three times: \"It has no birth, no end, no staying. The mind is not a thing.\"1179 This constitutes the insight of listening (thos pa'i shes rah). The meditator should then look at the mind and observe each of these points for himself, which brings out the insight of understanding (bsam byung gi shes rah). The logic behind each statement is briefly explained in the text. Finally, the meditative experience that ensues from such analysis is a feeling of the mind being like the center of the clear sky. That is the insight of meditation (sgom byung gi shes rah). It is here underlined that the meditator must regard any thought that arises as wholly natural and necessary and he should think of each thought with gratitude. In this way, thoughts be­comes quiet in and of themselves, and that is the technique to be employed for making thoughts part of the path (rtog pa lam du 'khyer ba). With repeated and sustained practice, the meditator will increase the achieved level of insight, which will lead him through the four yogas, namely the yoga of one-pointedness (rtse gcig gi rnal 'byor), the yoga of freedom from conceptual proliferation (spros brat gyi rnal 'byor), the yoga of the same flavor of various things (du ma ro gcig gi rnal 'byor), and the yoga of great meditative absorption (mnyam bzhag chen po'i rnal 'byor). The segment ends with a brief colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the instruction on bringing thoughts onto the path, called the natural mind.\" Segment DK.A.Ki.16: The segment begins (DK.A.Ki.16.15b1): bla ma rin po che la phyag 'tshal loll /bla ma 'i zhal nasl than cig skyes sb yor sgom pa 'i dus na/. It ends (DK.A.Ki.16.16ai): de las med/ 'bad nas bsgoms gsungl/.1180 The segment contains a short outline of the two armors (go cha gnyis, *dvayasm1111 aha), which respectively are said to represent the outer (phyi) and inner (nang) aspects of practicing the yoga of the co­emergent (lhan cig skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga). The armor of the view (lta ba'i go cha) is never to stop practicing positive actions (dkar po 'i chos spyod) and never to give in to even the smallest negative action (sdig pa phra zhing phra la 'dzem pa). The armor of insight (shes rab kyi go cha) is to let the mind rest undistractedly, while neither seeing the attain­ment of a deep and pleasant meditative absorption as a good quality nor seeing the lack thereof as a fault. When the mind rests undistractedly, thoughts simply do not arise, but when the mind is distracted (yengs pa) thoughts do arise. When a thought arises, the meditator should look directly at it and see that it neither entails birth, abiding, nor ter­mination, that it is without any identifiable independent nature of its own, that it is simply 1179 In Tibetan: skye ba med pal 'gag pa med pal gnas pa med pal sems dngos po med pa'o//. 118° Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.47a3-47bi, DK.B.Ki.16.15brl 6l4, DK.D.Ki.16.15b4-l6a2, DK.Q.Ki.1 6.446br447l4, DK.R.Ki. l 6.24a6-25ai, DK.S.Ki.1 6.26a3-26b4, DK.T.Ki.16.15b-16n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The instruction and its wording are closely parallel to a similar instruction given in segments DK.A.La.! and DK.A.A.3. First, it is pointed out that the meditator does not need to harbor any hope for buddhahood, since the three buddha bodies exist inherently within himself, and he also need not entertain any fear of sa17isara, since smJisara entails nothing to be abandoned and since it, in fact, constitutes the fuel or firewood (bud shing) for kindling the fire of insight. Thereafter, three methods for how to deal with thoughts in meditation are taught, namely to quell them as soon as they are encountered (phrad '}oms) by seeing them as being unborn, to pursue them (phyi bsnyag pa) through analysis of their source, or to entertain them (or, literally, \"let them emanate\") in spite of their being non-existent (med sprul pa). These instructions are here explained in brief, in the same manner as they were summarized above under segment DK.A.La. I. Finally, three analogies are presented to illustrate how thoughts may be useful to the meditator. These are the analogies of the wild spreading of a bush fire (nags la me mched pa), the melting of snow that falls into a lake (kha ba bahs ts had chur ro gcig tu 'gro ), an d the sense of recognition experienced when meeting an old acquaintance (sngar 'dris kyi mi mthong ba). These analogies are presented in the same manner as summarized in segment DK.A.La.!.

The question is asked what it is that is 'co-emergent' or, literally, \"arises together\" (gang dang 1181 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.47b1.5, DK.B.Ki.17.16�-16b2, DK.D.Ki.17.16ar l6b1, DK.Q.Ki. l 7.447a4-447h DK.R.Ki.l 7.25a1-25b4, DK.S.Ki. l 7.26b4-27b2, DK.T.Ki.17.16n-16b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Thus, it is here probed what is meant by the literal meaning \"arising together\" or \"born together\" (*saha-ja), or -perhaps more appropriately for the present context -by the literal meaning of the Tibetan translation of the term, namely \"arisen (skyes) as a pair (lhan cig)\" or \"born (skyes) as a pair (than cig).\" The answer given is that what arises together is knowledge (rig pa, *vidyii) and being empty (stong pa, *sunya). These two aspects are neither identical nor different. Rather, the meaning is that knowledge, presence (gsal ba, *vyakti), and bliss (bde ba, *sukha) are all 'yoked' or 'joined' together (sbyor ba, *yoga) within emptiness (stong nyid, *sunyatii) . It is in this sense that it is called \"union arising as a pair\" (than cig skyes sbyor), if the term should here be translated strictly in accordance with how the segment interprets it. Following this semantic exegesis, the segment gives an explanation of the two armors (go cha gnyis). The armor of the view (lta ba'i go cha) is again presented in the framework of the characteristics of awareness (shes pa 'i mtshan nyid), the special characteristics (khyad par gyi mtshan nyid), the characteristics of activity (byed pa'i mtshan nyid), and the characteristic of the nature (ngo bo nyid kyi mtshan nyid). These features are explained along the same lines as was done in segment DK.A.Ki.15. The armor of insight (shes rah kyi go cha) consists in the three insights of listening, understanding, and meditating. These are generally to be practiced in the manner explained previously (DK.A.Ki.15), but the explanation of the insight of meditation (sgom pa'i shes rah, *bhavaniimayf prajfiii) is here presented with a little twist. Similar to segment DK.A.Ki.15, meditation is here taught with reference to the four kinds of yoga (rnal 'byor rnam pa bzhi). Here, however, these yogas are given additional explanation and the instruction on how to handle thought attributed to Dge bshes Lcags ri ba in segment DK.A.Ki.17 is brought in. Thus, the yoga of one-pointedness (rtse gcig gi rnal 'byor) consists in remaining without distraction (ma yengs par 'dug pa). When this has been achieved, the meditator must lead thoughts onto the path (rtog pa lam du longs) either by quelling them as soon as they are encountered (phrad ]oms) or by pursuing them [through analysis of their source] (phyi bsnyag). Thereby, the yogfunderstands that it is not the right way of practice to attempt to be wholly without thoughts; rather, thoughts should be viewed as being. very helpful. This is the second level, the yoga of being free from conceptual proliferation (spros bral gyi rnal 'byor). By making this experience undistracted, outer perceptions (phyi'i snang ba) are cut off and become indistinct and ephemeral (ban bun tsam). This is the yoga of the same flavor of the manifold (du ma ro gcig gi rnal 'byor). Becoming well-trained therein, 'awareness' or 'knowledge' (rig pa, *vidyii) becomes completely naked (gcer bu 'ba' zhig). That is the completion of training and the attainment of dhannakiiya, and this is the yoga of being meditation-less (sgom med kyi rnal 'byor). These explanations teach the two armors of the view and insight. It is said that the instructions of a true teacher are always accompa­nied by meditative experience (nyams myong). In brief, all thoughts are mind and to rest the mind in a state that is completely without arising, ceasing, or abiding is non-distraction (ma yengs pa, *avik�epa or *avik�ipta).

The first key point is called \"three features\" (ngo ho gsum), which are to be effortless at the outset, to be uncontrived in the middle [of the meditation session], and to realize that any perception or feeling that arises at the end is simply one's own mind. The second key point is called four observances (dam tshig bzhi), pertaining to four Tantric precepts (dam tshig, *samaya) to be upheld. Afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, *kle§a) are not something to be eliminated, since they are one's own mind. The remedies (gnyen po, *pratipak�a) are not something to be relied upon, since the mind is without duality. There is no need to hope for buddhahood, since buddha is just one's own mind that has become realized. There is no need to fear sm!isiira, since its true nature (de bzhin nyid, *tathatii) does not exist as something to be cultivated or meditated upon (sgom du med). The third key point is called three pitfalls (gol sa gsum), which are listed as the pittfals of hoping for buddhahood, fearing smJisiira, and feeling attachment to what appears to be real things (dngos por snang ba). The fourth key point is called four methods of resting [the mind in meditation] (bzhag thabs bzhi). The first is to rest [the mind] in an uncontrived manner, just like water becomes clear when left undisturbed. The second is to rest the unceasing six collections [of consciousness] (tshogs drug, *�a_tkiiya) in their own natural state (rang lugs su), just like the sun when it is unobscured by clouds.

To begin with, the segment states that when a realized teacher (bla ma rtogs ldan) and a talented student meet, the teacher bestows the four ripening empowerments (dbang, *abhi­�eka) and teaches the two liberating methods of the Generation Stage and the Completion Stage. The meditation related to these two stages of Tantric practice produces bliss in the body (!us bde ba) and in the mind (sems bde ba), whereupon five inner signs (nang du rtags rnam pa lnga) appear along with five external benefits (phyir yang phan yon brgyad). The segment explains each sign in some detail, describing the steps in which the winds merge into the central channel, into the mind, and into radiance. It also explains the specific medi­tative experiences associated with each stage. The whole process is said to culminate in the emergence of timeless knowledge (ye shes, '\"jiiiina). Thereafter, the segment turns to a presentation of the three terms 'cause' (rgyu, *hetu), 'path' (lam, *miirga), and 'result' ('bras bu, *phala). These notions are discussed both with regard to the process of falling deeper into SG1?1siira through the performance of negative actions as well as with regard to the spiritual process of liberation. Without any segue, the segment next defines the three Mahamudrii terms \"natural mind\" (tha mal gyi shes pa, *priikrtajiiiina), \"uncontrived\" (ma bcos pa, *akrtima), and \"imma­nent\" (gnyug ma, *nija). Next, another set of three terms are defined, viz. \"non-conceptual\" (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa), \"knowledge\" or \"wi sdom\" (ye shes, *jiiiina), and \"empty\" (stong pa, *siinya). Then a distinction is drawn between the mind's characteristic (mtshan nyid, *lak�a7Ja), nature (rang bzhin, *svabhiiva), and appearance (ngo bo, *rupa). Thereafter, an explanation of Tantric practice is provided. For the Generation Stage (bskyed rim , *utpa ttikrama), two ways of generating the deity are laid out, namely the tech­nique known as \"instant complete recollection\" (skad cig dran rdzogs) and the technique called \"the three procedures\" (cha ga gsum). The benefits of mantra recitation (bzlas pa, *jiipa) are briefly presented. During the visualization, the practitioner must mentally uphold a conviction of the true nature (chos nyid kyi nga rgyal). If realization is achieved through this process, it is called \"the white panacea\" (dkar po chig th ub). Finally, the accomplish­ments achievable by different levels of practitioners through meditating on the Generation Stage are listed. The appearance (ngo bo, *rupa), etymology (nges tshig, *nirukti), and divisions (dbye ba, *bheda) of the Generation Stage are briefly stated. A discussion of the order in which the hindrances (sgrib pa, *iivara!ia) are purified by Tantric practice is given in accordance with opinions from the Bka' gdams pa tradition and from Ela ma Mi la. The segment agrees with both opinions and explains how each is right in its own way. This is followed by a more detailed explanation of the various hindrances. This part of the segment (DK.A.Ki.20.19a1-20a5) is wholly parallel to segment DK.A.A. l 2.U85 Next, the segment opens up an explanation on the importance of gathering the two necessities (tshogs, *sarr1bhiira) when practicing the stages of the path (lam rim). Then follows a brief listing of the right conditions for developing tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, 1185 For a more detailed overview of these opinions, see the summary of segment DK.A.A.12."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 539 *tamatha), namely the bla ma's blessing (bla ma'i byin rlabs), right circumstances (rten 'brel), having gathered the necessities (tslwgs bsags pa), and having shaken off or purified negative actions (sdig pa sbyang ba).1186 The segment then moves into pointing out the appearance of the mind as such (sems nyid kyi ngo bo), saying it is uncontrived and unadul­terated (ma bcos ma bslad pa), clear and pure (rnam par gsal ba dag pa), present at all times (dus thams cad pa), and uninterrupted (rgyun chad med pa). A distinction is drawn between when [the mind] is perceived and is ascertained (snang la nges pa) and when it is perceived but is not ascertained (snang la ma nges pa). The former is a full realization of the mind as such as being without any duality , an experience that feels like the deep and clear autumn sky (a season when there are no or few clouds in the Tibetan highland). The explanation of the phase when the mind is perceived but is not ascertained (snang la ma nges pa) is not made explicit in the segment. However, what follows is an explanation of meditative experiences (nyams su myong ba, *anubluiva) that arise when the meditator is able to rest in the mind without distraction (ma yengs pa), and as is evident in other parts of the Manzfold Sayings giving explanations on these two facets of ascertainment and non­ascertainment, the presentation of meditative experiences pertains directly to the phase when the mind is perceived but is not ascertained (snang la ma nges pa). The segment here teaches that when the meditator rests undistractedly, the meditative experiences of bliss (bde ba, *sukha) and non-thought (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa) arise, which are the meditative experiences of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *fomatha) . A question is posed whether these meditative experiences fluctuate, so that they are there at times while they are not to be found at other times. It is then clarified that thinking about this as a problem poses a risk, because it may turn the meditation into a cause for entering a sa1J1siiric state. Thus, focusing too much on seeking the experience of non-thought or non-conceptuality (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa) may lead to such meditation becoming the cause for becoming reborn in the meditative sa1J1siiric realms called the form realm (gzugs khams, *rupadhiitu) and the formless realm (gzugs med khams, *iinlpyadhiitu) or for entering into the state of cessation ('gog pa, *nirodha). Instead, as the meditator trains himself in the practice, he must first train in (bslab) a state of awareness or knowledge that is utterly lucid (rig pa gsal sing ba). Thereafter, he should train in a state in which the awareness is undistracted (shes pa ma yengs pa). Having become fully accustomed to this, certainty (nges shes) will emerge. With this, any thought or concept that arises in the meditation can unfold freely ('phro ba 'phror 'jug pa) without that the meditator loses sight of the nature of the mind as such (sems nyid kyi ngo bo ma shor ba). At this level, the thoughts that arise are simply recognized as being dharmakiiya and they do not in any way obstruct the natural state of the mind. This point is further explained via an analogy (dpe, *upamii) of the sky and clouds. The sky is naturally empty and pure and whatever clouds and mist appear in the sky always diss olve back into the sky again. Just as the clouds appear as being different from the color 1186 See fn. 571."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"540 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum [of the sky], similarly various conceptual states, such as weariness (ngal) and so forth, may arise [within the nature of the mind as such]. When thoughts are viewed in this manner, they become an aid to the meditation (grogs su 'gro ba), enhancing the experience. If, however, thoughts are not able to unfold freely, this poses a setback, because it runs the risk of becoming a cause for being reborn in the formless realm. In that case, the meditator needs occasionally to meditate on the Generation Stage of visualizing the deity, where the deity is generated in one go by using the technique called \"instant complete recollection\" (skad cig dran rdzogs). This is to be followed by meditation focusing exclusively on radiance ('od gsal, *prabhiisvara). The feeling of utter lucidity (gsal sing nge ba) that arises therefrom is a meditative experience (nyams myong, *anubhiiva) and to remain undistracted therein (ma yengs pa) is to settle [the mind] (gnas pa, *sthiti). To look at this state with insight and see that it is not established as any identifiable thing or form (ngo bo, *rupa) is realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha). To let mentally go off this life is the purpose (dgos pa, *prayojana). The segment ends with a short added saying in verse with an eleven-syllable meter attributed to the bla ma, perhaps here referring to Mi la ras pa, given the peculiar poetic wording of the verse. The verse indicates the features of the nature of phenomena (chos nyid, *dharmata), awareness (rig pa, *vidya), the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittata), and wisdom or knowledge (ye shes, *jfiana) along with instructions on how to relate to each in meditation.

It says that to begin with the bla ma matures (smin par byas) the student by bestowing the four empowerments (dbang, *abhi:;eka) and thereupon the student has to liberate (grol bar byed) himself by meditating on the methods (thabs, *upaya) that are included in the Generation and Completion Stages (bskyed rdzogs gnyis) of Tantric practice. The Completion Stage is subdivided into two levels. The first is called \"involving elaborations\" (spros bcas), which covers the meditations on the channels, winds, and drops (rtsa rlung thig le). The second is called \"without elaborations\" (spros med), which refers to the yoga of the co-emergent (skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga) or Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po). The four yogas of Mahii mudra practice are then compared to the five paths (lam Inga) taught in the system of the Common Mahayana. Here, the yoga of one-pointedness (rtse gcig gi rnal 'byor) is said to correspond to the path of accumulation (tshogs lam, *sa'!1bha-1187 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.52bs-53b1, DK.B.Ki.21.2la6-22ai, DK.D.Ki.21.2lbr22a4, DK.Q.Ki.21.449br450bi, DK.R.Ki.2 l .34ar35a2, DK.S.Ki.2 l .36ad7bi, DK.T.Ki.21.21 b-22n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

According to the system of stages taught in the Secret Mantra tradition, Mahiimudrii corresponds to the path of non-training (mi slob pa'i lam), while according to the Piiramitii tradition it corresponds to the path of perfection (mthar phyin pa'i lam). The saying ends in several sentences stressing the need for practicing meditation with diligence. The segment also includes a second saying, which seems to be part of the same textual passage and which therefore have been considered forming a single segment in the present analysis of the corpus. This second saying is attributed to the bla ma. Its style of writing tends to use a form of doctrinal shorthand with many abbreviated sentences, making it necessary to read several things into the sentences in order to make them sensible. It thus differs in style not only from the preceding saying, but also from the majority of other sayings in the compilation, which typically are written in clear, simple and straightforward prose. Like the preceding saying, this saying too deals with stages of the Tantric path. First it is explained that [meditation on] the selflessness of the individual (gang zag gi bdag med, *pudgalanairiitmya) is linked with the Generation Stage (bskyed rim), while [meditation on] the selflessness of phenomena (chos kyi bdag med, *dharmanairiitmya) is associated with the Completion Stage. On the path of accumulation (tshogs lam), there is recognition or identification [of these two forms of selflessness], on the path of seeing (mthong lam) there is direct perception (mngon sum du byed) [thereof], while on the ten bodhisattva levels (sa bcu, *da§abhumi) the ascetic qualities of shaking off (sbyong ba 'i yon tan, *dhutagw:ia or *dhutagw:ia) appear spontaneously (rang snang) in the post-[meditative phase] (rjes). Thereupon, the saying briefly explains a number of meditative experiences, namely mental and bodily bliss (lus sems bde ba), presence (gsal ba), lucidity (gsal sing nge), non­conceptuality (mi rtog pa), clarity (dwangs pa), and subtleness (phra ba). Some of these brief explanations are given in the form of short analogies. The segment ends by listing a number of signs (rtags) of inner accomplishment, such as taming negative behaviors, absence of pride or arrogance, having only few and small attachments, feeling weariness with sa7Jisiira, and refraining from involvement in action and result (las 'bras, *karmaphala).

Suffering is not explained with a simile but is stated to have its root (rtsa ba) in the tendency to take things as being real (dngos 'dzin). Likewise, relative truth (kun rdzob bden pa) is given no simile but is said to be incontrovertible, thereby stressing the need for the yogf to keep in mind the cause and effect of actions.

The meditator of the highest aptitude (dbang po rab) settles [into the nature of the mind] (bzhag pa) on the basis of the view (lta thog tu). One of middling aptitude ('bring) settles on the basis of meditation (sgom thog tu). One of lower aptitude (tha ma) settles on the basis of Dharma activities (chos spyod). As for meditation (sgom pa), it is possible either to seek meditation on the basis of the view (lta thog nas sgom 'tshol ba) or to seek the view on the basis of meditation (sgom thog nas lta ba 'tshol ba). Here only the latter approach is taught. The meditator must settle directly into a non-conceptual awareness of the mind as such, which is vivid yet without identifiable features. The experience of vividness (gsal ba) avoids the extreme of nihilism (chad pa'i mtha'), while the experience of non-identifiability ('dzin med) prevents the extreme of eternalism (rtag pa'i mtha'). The mind as such should remained undistorted by ideas (rtog pa), and the meditator must not evaluate the experience as being po sitive or negative. Instead, the yogf should rest directly (lhan ne) in an awareness (rig pa) that is self-lucid (rang gsal) and non-conceptual (mi rtog pa). By settling the mind in this way, non-conceptual wisdom (rtog med kyi ye shes) will emerge, free of direction (phyogs med) and self-liberating (rang grol).

Various similes are used for illustrating how these experiences feel, e.g., sunshine, birds leaving no traces behind when flying in the sky, the flow of water, and the like. The sequence culminates in a state that is meditation-less (sgom med) and self-liberating (rang grol). The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above) saying: \"The instruction on the meditation on the nature, which is the heart practice and commitment (thugs dam) of the precious one (rin po che), was written down at the hermitage of Copper Valley (zangs lung dgon pa).\" It should be noted that Zangs lung dgon pa is a smaller retreat place in the vicinity of the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage, where Bsod nams rin chen is said to have achieved realization.119° Following the colophon, there is poem which provides a summari­zing instruction (likewise cited in Tibetan above): \"Since perception is seen as illusory, [it is] the illusory body (sgyu lus). When that illusion is known to be empty, [it is] radiance ('od gsal). Since those two have no difference, [it is] union (zung 'jug). However, if emptiness [is believed to apply] even on the relative [level], [it is] a misguided insight ('cha! ba'i shes rah). \" Segment DK.A.Ki.24: The segment begins (DK.A.Ki.24.22b1): /Ina mo gu ru/ bla ma rin po che'i zhal nas/ pha rol tu phyin pa'i lugs kyis/. It ends (DK.A.Ki.24.26b1): lbdag gis bsod nams las shes bya// ces gsungs so//. 1191 The twenty-fourth segment begins with a long saying attributed to the precious teacher (bla ma rin po che). It is there taught that, on the one hand according to the Prajffiip aramita tradition (pha rol tu phyin pa'i lugs), realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha) is produced on the basis of the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta), [seeing things as] illusion-like (sgyu ma lta bu, *mayavat), and [understanding them to be] empty (stong pa, *sitnya). The Mantra tradition (sngag kyi lugs), on the other hand, maintains that realization is produced on the basis of [seeing] the body as the deity (lus lha), the speech as mantra (ngag sngags), and the mind as the true nature of things (yid chos nyid). The speaker of the saying then declares that by using his own approach for putting the teachings into practice (nged rang gi chos kyi 'khyer lugs 'dis), the practitioner is bound to move upwards (yar 'gro ba) and will not go down (mar mi 'gro ba). Relying on this, the most talented practitioners will achieve buddhahood, the middling ones will be reborn in one of the five noble places ('phags pa'i gnas Inga), i.e., in the highest celestial realms, while lesser practitioners will achieve rebirth in the [lower] god realms. Thereupon, the saying gives a doctrinal outline of how to view reality. The various outer and inner perceptions (dran rig sna tshogs) should be understood as constituting rel ative reality (kun rdzob, *sa7Jivrti), whereas the appearance of the mind as such (sems nyid kyi ngo bo) is ultimate reality (don dam, *paramartha). The meditative experience of this nature as it is right now (da lta'i ngo bo'i nyams) leads to buddhahood. It is here underlined that emptiness and compassion should not be separated and, in fact, concepts or thoughts 1190 See fn. 280 and 833. 1191 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.54ii6-58as, DK.B.Ki.24.22br26b7, DK.D.Ki.24.23a3-27a5, DK.Q.Ki.24.45 la5-455b7, DK.R.Ki.24.36br43b,, DK.S.Ki.24.39az-46a5, DK.T.Ki.24.23n-27n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

The very nature of concepts as such is dharmakaya. The realization thereof is, however, not something that can be attained just on the basis of the teacher's spoken word, because realization is beyond the realm of the intellect. It cannot be adequately expressed by anyone else and it exists only within oneself as one's own co­emergent nature (lhan cig skyes, *sahaja). Once the practitioner has learned to settle therein, the meditative experience (nyams su myong ba, *anubhava) that all concepts are of the same flavor (ro gcig, *ekar asa) arises and this is what leads to full realization. The segment then describes how such realization is pervasive (khyab pa, vyiipti), unchanging (mi 'gyur, *acala or *nirvikara), present at all times (dus thams cad pa, *sarvakiilika), and uninter­rupted (rgyun chad pa med pa, *asamuccheda or *nirantara). Thereupon, the segment moves into a discussion of the relative (kun rdzob, *sarf1vrti) and the ultimate (don dam) according to the interpretations presented by the venerable one (rje btsun), possibly referring to Mi la ras pa, and the Bka' gdams teacher Bya yul ba. This is connected with the claim that buddhahood can be reached in a single lifetime, if the practitioner adopts the Secret Mantra approach. A comparison is given of how the term 'awareness' or 'knowledge' (rig pa, *vidya) is variously interpreted in the Mind-Only (sems tsam pa, *cittamatra) and the Secret Mantra traditions. The first saying ends with a discussion of how the nature (ngo bo) is uninterrupted (rgyun chad med pa) and how mis­understandings (shor ba) of the meditative experience thereof may arise. At this point, another quite long saying commences with a question as to what differ­ence there is between the Piiramita approach and the Secret Mantra approach. The question is first answered very briefly by stating that the difference is a matter of whether the path is long or short. Thereupon, the saying quickly moves into debating a whole series of other topics, which is a passage that appears to be somewhat disconnected and written in a rather complex style of writing, making it a difficult saying to capture adequately merely in the brief summary form attempted here. It should be noted that the saying return s to the overall topic of comparing the two above-mentioned approaches towards the end of the saying, and it therefore seems likely that the many topics raised in between are intended as leading up to this comparison. To begin with, the approaches of Naropa and Maitripa are compared, saying that the former involves meditation (sgom, *bhavana), whereas the latter does not. This is followed by a discussion of realization (rtogs pa) and non-realization (ma rtogs pa), particularly as to whether full realization is achievable while still alive in the living body. Next, it is debated how beginners and more advanced practitioners look upon perceptions (snang ba) as either adverse or helpful circumstances. References are here given to the view presented in Nagarjuna's Yukti�a�tika (dbu ma rig[s] pa drug bcu pa) and the opinion held by the Ela ma, probably referring to Mi la ras pa, which leads into a discussion of sameness (mnyam pa, *sama).

This is a complex discussion, which makes references to how these traditions variously view the role of the basis (rten, *iidhiira or *adhi�[hiina) and the method (thabs, *upiiya) for realization. The discussion turns to debating the status of vows (sdom pa, *sm?ivara) in these traditions, at which point the opinions of the Bka' gdams teacher Dge bshes Sgre pa, the Ela ma [Mi la ras pa], and the Precious One (rin po che) [Bsod nams rin chen] are compared. The segment ends with a discussion of reality as posited by the Bka' gdams pa and the Secret Mantra tradition, which includes a point concerning the status of clairvoyance and special powers (mngon shes, *abhijnii) and a quotation on this issue from the Hevajratantra.

First, it quotes the venerable bla ma (bl a ma rje btsun), perhap s referring to Mi la ras pa, who states that the term \"co-emergent knowledge\" (sa ha dza'i ye shes, *sahajajniina) is equivalent to the term \"natural knowing\" or \"natural mind\" (tha ma! gyi shes pa, *priikrtajniina), which he says is the term that is used [in Tibet] nowadays. After the quotation, an explanation follows on how to recognize (ngo shes par byed pa) this feature of the mind. Relying on the teacher's instructions (bla ma'i gsung), the practitioner should settle (bzhag) into the natural mind in a manner that is uncontrived (ma bcos par), undis torted (ma bslad par), naturally relaxed (rang dgar), and letting the mind be as it is (rang sor). When settling the mind in this manner, the meditator becomes able to realize the mind as being without birth, end, or remaining, seeing that it is not a thing and also realizing that perceptions of what is seen and heard (snang grags) are similar in nature to the mind. Thus, the yogfwill rest undistractedly (yengs pa med pa) in the true nature of the mind at all times. He sees that the unborn mind as such and perceptions are without duality, related like water and waves. Meanwhile, his spiritual conduct remains a conduct that maintains strict aware­ness of the cause and effect of actions and their results (las 'bras, *karmaphala). At this point, the segment turns into a new saying, which presents the two stages of the Secret Mantra path (gsang sngags kyi lam). First, the Generation Stage (bskyed rim, *utpa ttikrama) is said to lead to the realization of the meaning of union (zung 'jug gi don) in the best practitioners, whereas it produces a reversal of clinging to things as being ordinary (tha mal gyi zhen pa zlog) in middling and lesser practitioners. Moreover, the best practitioners may accomplish a direct vision of the deity (lhar mthong) relying on the Gene­ration Stage, while middling practitioners may use it to attain certainty of illusion (sgyu mar nges) and lesser yogfs may attain conviction (mos pa, *adhimukti). Also, lesser practi-1192 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.58as-58bs, DK.B.Ki.25.26br27b1, DK.D.Ki.25.27a5-27bs, DK.Q.Ki.25.455b7-456a7, DK.R.Ki.25.43b1-44bs, DK.S.Ki.25.46a5-47<L+, DK.T.Ki.25.27n-27b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Secondly, the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim, *sm71pattikra111a) enables the best practitioners to realize the mind as [taught in] the Madhyamaka [system] (dbu ma), the middling ones to realize the nature of the mind (sems kyi ngo bo) as being birthless (skye med), and the lesser practitioners to train in the yoga of one-pointedness (rtse gcig, *ekarasa) by relying on the Completion Stage involving elaborations (spros bcas), i.e., by practicing the Tantric yogas of Inner Heat, etc. Also, it is said that when the best practitio­ners perform the Completion Stage practices, they realize the nature of the mind as it truly is, the middling ones no longer sense the coming and going of the breath (dbugs 'gro 'ong) , whereas the lesser ones question whether or not the body is at all present. The segment has no colophon. Segment DK.A.Ki.26: The segment begins (DKA.Ki.26.27b,): //rin po che'i zhal nas/ dbyings dang ye shes gnyis nil. It ends (DK.A.Ki.26.28a1): de la rgyun du goms par byed pas sgom lam mthar phyin pa 'i 'bras bu 'i lam nw/.1193 The twenty-sixth segment contains a saying attributed to the Precious One (rin po che), which defines and analyzes a series of terms that are used for distinguishing between the appearance of things and their real nature. To begin with, the distinction between 'expanse' (dbyings, *dhiitu) and 'knowledge' or 'wisdom' (ye shes, *jiiiina) is drawn, where expanse signifies the characteristics of all phenomena (chos thams cad kyi mtshan nyid) whereas knowledge denotes the radiance that is the pure mind as such (sems nyid rnam par dag pa 'ad gsal ba). Next, a distinction is made between how 'phenomena' or 'Buddhist teachings' (chos, *dharma)1194 may be non­profound (mi zab pa, *agambhfra), middling ('bring po, *madhya), or profound (zab pa, *gambhzra). The non-profound refers to the teaching on the cause and effect of actions and their results (las 'bras bu, *karmaphala), the middling is the illusory dream-like nature of all phenomena of SaJ?isiira and nirvii':ta, while the profound is the inborn nature (gnyug ma, *nija), which is bottomless like a deep ocean. Next, yet another distinction known from the Indian Buddhist siistra treatises is brought in, namely the distinction of phenomenon (chos, *dharma), host-phenomenon (chos can, *dharmin), and the nature of the phenomenon or the phenomenon as such (chos nyid, dharmatii). In the present saying, these terms are given a somewhat unusual interpretation, in that the phenomenon is explained as the object of the mind (blo'i yul, *buddhivi,Jaya), the host-phenomenon is said to be the perceiving mind (der 'dzin par byed pa'i shes pa), while the phenomenon as such is stated to be the purity which has never been truly existent (ye nas ma grub pa'i rnam par dag pa). The inseparability of these three is said to be Mahiimudrii, which is briefly explained with reference to the third Tantric empowerment (dbang gsum pa), the two accumulations (tshogs gnyis), and the 1193 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.58b5-59a5, DK.B.Ki.26.27b1-28a1, DK.D.Ki.26.27bs-28as, DK.Q.Ki.26.456ar456b6, DK.R.Ki.26.44b5-46a1, DK.S.Ki.26.47a4-48a3, DK.T.Ki.26.27b-28n, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

The segment's title ascribes its authorship to Bsod nams rin chen's older nephew, Dags po Sgom tshul. The first part of the poem consists of eleven four-line verses, having seven syllables in verse-lines abc and eight syllables in verse-lined. All the verses, except the final verse, end with the words \"[I] prostrate and give praise to ... \" ( ... la phyag 'tshal bstod) in the fourth verse-line. Verses 1-5 pay homage to the first five members of the Bka' brgyud lineage, including Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang), Tailopa, Naropa, Mar pa, and Mi la ras pa. Verses 6-10 pay homage to a teacher only identified with the epithet \"the incomparable precious master\" (mnyam med rje btsun rin po che), presumably referring to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen. These verses laud how the teacher benefits sentient beings in various ways, describing him as an emanation (sprul pa, *nirmita or *nirmitaka) of Vairocana (rnam snang mdzad), Avalokitesvara (spyan ras gzigs), and the healing buddha Bhai�ajyarajan (sman pa'i rgyal po). The eleventh verse expresses a dedication (bsngo ba, *pari�iiima) of the merit arising from this prayer with the wish that all sentient beings may be freed from the illnesses of the afflictive emotions (nyon myongs, *kle§a). The second part of the poem consists of ten four-line verses, having seven syllables in each line. The meter of verse-lined thus differs from the eight syllables found in verse-line d in the first part of the poem. Verses 1-10 again all end with the words \"[I] prostrate and give praise to ... \" ( ... la phyag 'tshal bstod) in verse-line d. The verses pay homage to the teacher, focusing on him as a precious guide for sentient beings, on the qualities of his unborn mind, on the aspects of dharmakaya, saryibhogakaya, nirmii�akaya, the indivisible four buddha bodies, the guru as possessing of the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga ldan), and as being the holder of the six forms of clairvoyance (mngon shes drug).

The text begins with a segment which describes the practice stages involved in meditating on a Tantric deity. It then turns to two segments that briefly lay out the practices of Mahiimudrii meditation. A brief explanation of the stages of the Common Mahiiyiina path follows presented in the framework of the so­called \"four Dharmas of Sgam po pa\" (Dags po'i chos bzhi), followed by a segment contai­ning a spiritual poem. The remainder of the text mainly gives very detailed yoga instruc­tions with particular focus on the practices related to the Interim stages (bar do, *antarii­bhava) and Transference ('pho ba, *sarrikriinti). Segment DK.A.Khi.1: The segment begins (DK.A.Khi.1.lb1): /bla ma rin po che la phyag 'tshal lo/ lgyad gyi nor bu Ito na yodl. It ends (DK.A.Khi.1.2b1) with the colophon: lbka' tshoms gyi le'u'o//.1198 The segment contains a poem written in verse-form with numerous interlinear glosses in note form in prose. The poem consists of 47 verse-lines with seven syllables in each line. The poem seems quite cryptic when the verse-lines are read on their own, given that the verses employ numerous allegories to describe certain Tantric visualizations. However, when the interlinear notes written in smaller script are read together with the lines, the proper interpretation quickly becomes clear. The poem describes a meditation on a Tantric deity, going through the various steps of generating the deity, blessing the visualization, and identifying oneself with the deity. Thereupon, the inner visualization of channels is briefly indicated and the yoga of Inner Heat (gtum mo) is shortly described. The winds of the afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, *kle5a) are gathered into the central channel beneath the navel and consumed in the fire of insight. This process causes the white bodhicitta to melt in the cakra of great bliss (bde chen gyi 'khor lo, * mahiisukhacakra) at the top of the head, making it descend down into 1198 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ga.129a5-129b4, DK.B.Khi.1.1 b1-2b7, DK.D.Khi. l.lb1-3a1, DK.Q.Khi.1 .458a1-458b6, DK.R.Khi.1.1 b1-3b4, DK.S.Khi.1.1 b1-3b3, DK.T.Khi.1.1 b-3n, Phyag chen mdzodvol.

This later doctrine known as \"Fivefold Mahiimudra\" (phyag chen lnga ldan) or as \"the profound path of the Fivefold Mahamudrii\" (zab lam phyag chen lnga ldan) has its textual source in root-texts by Bsod nams rin chen's student Phag mo gru pa Rdo rje rgyal po (1110-1170) and his student 'Jig rten gsum mgon Rin chen dpal (1143-1217). The five points taught in this system are: (1) engendering the resolve for A wakening ( byang sems phyag chen), (2) deity practice (lha sku'i phyag chen), (3) devotion to the teacher (mos gus phyag chen), (4) Mahamudra practice on the actual nature (gnas lugs phyag chen), and (5) dedication of merit (bsngo ba 'i phyag chen).1200 Although the present segment of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum also bears the name \"fivefold Mahamudra,\" it must be stressed that the five points taught here differ entirely from the five points seen in the later systems. The Mahamudra teaching of the present segment is therefore likely to be a work that predates the \"fivefold Mahiimudra\" texts of Phag mo gru pa and 'Jig rten gsum mgon, sharing the same name as these later texts but not their fivefold structure. The present segment begins by stating that the Mahiimudra instruction (phyag rgya chen po'i man ngag) here has five features (rnam pa lnga), viz.: (l) realization endowed with the view (rtogs pa !ta ba dang ldan pa); ( 2) meditation endowed with meditative experience (sgom pa nyams myong dang ldan pa); (3) conduct endowed with same flavor (spyod pa ro snyoms dang ldan pa); (4) instruction (*avaviida) endowed with a transmission lineage (gdams ngag brgyud pa dang ldan pa); and (5) certainty endowed with dispelling of errors (nges shes skyon bsal ba dang ldan pa). The remainder of the segment explains each of the key words in these five points one by one, i.e., 'realization', 'view', 'meditation', 'meditative experience', etc. Some words receive more detailed treatment than others.

Realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha) refers to the insight that sa7J7st1ra and buddhahood (sangs rgyas kyi rang bzhin, *buddhasvabhiiva) share the same 'cause' (rgyu, *hetu) or basis, given that both are subsumed within the inborn mind (gnyug ma'i sems, *nijacitt a). This insight arises when the practitioner looks at his own mind as being the bla ma (rang sems bla mar shes pa). In extension thereof, it is understood that the mind (sems, *citta) and perceptions (snang ba, *avabhiisa) are equally Mahiimudrii and without any separation or difference (tha mi dad). They are linked like sesame and sesame oil, or like water and ice. The view (lta ba, *darfona), which is derived from realization, is to be without clinging to anything whatsoever (zhen pa med pa, *asakta), to have neither hope for buddhahood nor fear of the hell realms. Meditation (sgom pa, *bhiivanii) should not descend into any particular direction or identifiable structure, but should consist in resting in an inexpressible state . The mind should neither be directed outwards nor withdrawn within, but the meditator should let it rest directly in its own natural state (rang lugs). Meditative experience (nyams su myong ba, *anubhava) should be uninterrupted (rgyun chad med pa) and wholly without distraction (yengs ba) even though there is nothing to meditate on (bsgom du med). The awareness should be overflowing (me re ba), supple (idem pa), suspended (phyang po), blissful (bde ba), and vividly present (gsal ba). The seg­ment here goes on describing these meditative experiences in somewhat more detail, also with reference to how they are situated in daily life experiences. The conduct (spyod pa, *caryti) should be wholly unbiased (phyogs su ma !hung ba). The experience of same flavor (ro snyoms) is the reverse (go log) of the behavior of ordinary people, to be without a care for conformity with the world ('jig rten pa dang tshul mi mthun par bya). The instruction (gdams ngag, *avaviida) or transmitted tradition (man ngag, *iimntiya) means never to give up the venerable teacher (bla ma rje btsun) despite having realized one's own mind to be the Buddha, never to stop performing positive actions despite having realized perceptions to be the mind, always to avoid negative actions despite having no fear for the hell realms, never to criticize any teaching (chos, *dharma) despite having no hope for buddhahood, never to be proud regardless of how many good qualities of meditation have arisen in oneself, always to train in soli tary retreat (dgon pa) despite having realized that there is no difference between sa7J7siira and nirvtiria, and never to cease having com­passion for sentient beings despite having realized there is no difference between self and others. A transmission lineage (brgyud pa, *pararJ1parti) means to take refuge in, pray to, and perform marir;lala offerings to, and seek the blessing (byin brlab) from the lineage starting with the Buddha and reaching down to the contemporary teachers (bla ma rje btsun pa).

Dispelling of errors (skyon bsal ba, *do�iipakar�a-fta) is eightfold: (1-2) if hope or fear arises, there is an error of not having realized the view; (3-4) if any sense of something to be meditated upon and an act of meditating arises, there is an error of lacking a one-pointed mind; (5-6) if there is a sense of something to be developed and something to be eliminated, there is an error of not having done the meditation to its full conclusion; (7-8) if attachment to material things or gatherings of friends or relatives arises, there is an error of not knowing how to tum [thoughts] into the path (lam du 'khyer ba).

Despite the similarity in their titles, the two works, however, do not share the same contents in any way. The segment is partly parallel to segment DK.A.Ki.15. Moreover, it is wholly identical to segment DK.A.A. IO, except for the very beginning of the segment, which constitutes a highly abbreviated form of the explanations found at the beginning of segment DK.A.A. l 0. The present segment opens with a verse paying homage to the bla ma and then lists the four conditions (rkyen bzhi), i.e., the causal condition (rgyu'i rkyen, *hetupratyaya), the governing condition (bdag po'i rkye n, *adhipatipratyaya), the focal condition (dmigs pa'i rkyen, *iilambanapratyaya), and the immediately preceding condition (de ma thag pa 'i rkyen , *samanantarapratyaya). Without relating these conditions to what follows (as it is done in segment DK.A.A.IO), the segment then briefly states that a wrong teacher (log pa'i bshes gnyen) is deluded and has attachment to hopes and fears, whereas a genuine teacher (yang dag pa'i bshes gnyen) is non-deluded, without hope and fear, and possesses special abilities to make wishes [come true], transform adverse circumstances, and induce under­standing.

The explanation given in the present segment is though slighter longer than those found elsewhere. To turn one's Dharma to the Dharma (chos chos su 'gro ba) is said to necessitate tho­rough and sustained contemplation of the impermanence (mi rtag pa, *anitya) of every­thing outer and inner. Having thoroughly realized this impermanence, the aspiring practi­tioner must leave behind all material possessions, family, and friends, and enter into solitude to practice in retreat. The segment firmly stresses that as long as the practitioner has not fully accepted the fact that everything is impermanent and that sa'!'lsiira inevitably involves negative actions and only will bring more suffering, it remains fundamentally impossible truly to tum one's Dharma to the Dharma. To tum the Dharma into a path (chos lam du 'gro ba) means to cultivate attitudes of kindness and compassion for others, to train in the relative bodhicitta, and to understand that all outer and inner phenomena are illusory like dreams, since they only are perceived through the coming together of various conditions. With such understanding in hand, the path removes the practitioner's delusion (lam 'khrul pa sel ha). Meditating on imperma­nence (mi rtag pa bsgoms pas) removes the delusion of clinging to this life (tshe 'di la zhen pa'i 'khrul pa sel), meditating on action and their results (las 'bras, *karma phala) removes the delusion of harboring wrong views (lta ha ngan pa'i 'khrul pa), meditating on the shortcomings of sa'!'lsiira ('khor ba'i nyes dmigs, *sarpsariidfnava) removes the delusion of being attached to sa'!'lsiira ('khor ba la chags pa'i 'khrul pa), meditating on kindness and compassion (byams snying rje, *maitrfkarw:ie) removes the delusion of the lesser vehicles (theg dman gyi 'khrul pa), and meditating on things being like dreams and magical illusions (rmi lam sgyu ma lta bu, *svapnamiiyopamii) removes the delusion of taking things to be real (dngos por 'dzin pa'i 'khrul pa). As the practitioner progresses to successively higher stages of these meditations, delu­sion arises as knowledge ('khrul pa ye shes su 'char ha).

The poem's first part consists of 90 verse-lines, having nine syllables in each line. This part of the poem admonishes the reader to practice the Dharma. It is said that the practitioner is stuck in sa171siira, wandering through life after life, and it is now needed to listen to many spiritual instructions (man ngag). The time for seeking liberation (thar pa, *mok�a) is right now, since life is uncertain and one may die any moment. Hence, the practitioner should abandon the mundane activities of this life and devote himself to practicing the Dharma. Without being enslaved to sleep and laziness, he must meditate one-pointedly on emptiness and compassion. Settling the mind in the state of meditative equanimity (mnyam pa'i ngang), the meditator should behold the pure sphere of reality (chos dbyings, *dharmadhiitu). The meditative experiences of non-thought, bliss, and presence must be cultivated, and the self- arisen uncontrived nature should be the basis for the yogi's conduct. The result will be the four buddha bodies (sku bzhi, *catu(1kiiya) and the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga, *paficajfiiina). The view, meditation, conduct, and result should be practiced as integrated parts of the path, all being based in a proper understanding of emptiness. A key point raised here is to eliminate attachment (chags pa, *raga), including attachment to spiritual things such as the deity or the Dharma. It is pointedly noted that all forms of attachment pose obstacles to the path (lam gyi bar chad byed), regardless of whether it is the rich man's attachment to a thousand ounces of gold or the poor man's attachment to a needle and a thread. As long as desires and attachment persist, the practitioner should endeavor in practicing positive actions (dge ba, *ku§ala) with body, speech, and mind, venerating the teacher and the three jewels with faith, and praying to the meditation deity (yi dam lha, *i�_tadevata). Notably, no matter how much meditation on the meaning of the profound teachings is undertaken, it is a key point continously to engender compassion for sentient beings. The practitioner must give up laziness and strive in his practice. He must meditate on the instructions, understand the unborn nature of everything, perform the conduct of viewing all activities to be like illusions, and not permit even the smallest downfall in the practice. Observing the three sets of vows (sdom gsum), one should practice Mahiimudra. In short, there are many outer signs of practicing the meditation on reality within, namely a pure conduct that avoids negativities of all sorts.

Whatever difficulties arise, the yogi keeps in mind that sentient beings are caught in delusion and that one ought to have compassion for others. He remembers that although he takes things to be real, they are, in fact, not so, and if he continues to train in this way, he cannot be harmed by anything. It is crucial that he always remembers the futility of wealth and too many engagements in mundane affairs, and that he keeps in mind that he is going to die. There are three ways in which yogis may die: the best one dies like a madman (smyon pa !ta bur), the middling one dies like a wild deer (ri dwags lta bu), while the lesser one dies like a king (rgyal po lta bur). The meaning of this is to have only few and small desires, to be content, to be without pride, to reduce afflictive emotions and to increase realization. In conclusion, the yogi should be without care for wealth and fame. This concludes the first part of the poem. The second part of the poem consists of twenty-two verse-lines of varying length, having either seven or nine syllables per line in no discernible pattern. The poem's second part begins by emphasizing the practice of bodhicitta and the importance of being a bodhisattva. The basic principles for practicing are then that in the beginning adverse conditions will harm the practitioner and should therefore be avoided altogether. Later on, however, these adverse conditions, if encountered, become challenges that strengthen and aid the practice. Hence, in the beginning the practitioner should practice in isolation, avoid­ing gatherings of people. Then follows a series of verses that stress the difficulty in obtaining a human rebirth and receiving instructions, the weight of impermanence, and the need for practicing right now. If the practitioner continuously venerates the three jewels, relies on the teacher, listens to his instructions, and practices the path in a gradual manner (rim gyis, *kramelJ,a), results will quickly be attained. Hence, the practitioner should control the mind and meditate. The segment ends with a short colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This] instruction by the Dharma master, the splendid true teacher Sgam po pa, is a condensation of spiritual practice (nyams Zen bsdus pa 'o ).

The instructions form a distinct text, The Treasury of Secret Oral Instructions (Zhal gdams gsang mdzod ma), whose writing style is very polished and highly structured. In this regard, it differs considerably from the other segments in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum dealing with the yogas, which are manuals written in an unstructured style of simple prose. Further, the present text makes many references to the Tantras, thereby striving to show a scriptural authority and basis for the yogas of Naropa, whereas other yoga segments in the bka' 'bum tend mainly or only to draw on the yoga manual known as \"the instruction text\" (bka' dpe). The present segment takes as it starting point the notion of \"interim\" (bar do, *antarabhava) and arranges the various yoga practices around this concept. The way in which the segment uses this notion differs considerably from how the notion occurs elsewhere in the bka' 'bum.1205 In most other segments giving teachings on the interim, these teachings only concern the interim that begins with dying and lasts until becoming reborn into a new SaJ?Jsaric body. The instructions given in that context are focused on achieving liberation in the afterlife or, if that is not possible, preventing an undesirable rebirth and attaining a useful rebirth. In the present segment, the interim between death and rebirth is only one out of three types of interim phases, the two other being the interims of life and of dream. Hence, the present segment explains the notion of interim as a broader concept that comes to encompass any state of being, whether alive, sleeping, or dead. In this way, it is possible to incorporate all the different yoga practices and their various existential foci into a single conceptual framework. The yogas are here presented as practices of mixing (bsre ha, *mifra) and transference ('pho ha, *sm11kranti), which likewise is a manner of presentation that is not found widely in the yoga instructions of Dags po'i bka ' 'bum, with the exception of text DK.A.Tsa. It might here be noted that while the later Bka' brgyud traditions generally referred to the yogas with the label \"the six doctrines of Naropa\" (na ro'i chos drug or na ro chos drug), there are some Tibetan masters who used the label \"mixing and transference\" (bsre 'pho) as a general name for the yogas, e.g., the famous 'Brug pa Bk a' brgyud master Kun mkhyen Padma dkar po (1527-1592). The latter name would thus agree with the presentational scheme found in the present segment and in text DK.A.Tsa. 1204 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka.122a3-l32b4, DK.B.Khi.6.9a4-l9h DK.D.Khi.6.9a5-20a5, DK.Q.Khi.6.463a5-473a2, DK.R.Khi.6.14bs-32a3, DK.S.Khi.6.14br33b2, DK.T.Khi.6.9n-20n, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

This introductory passage briefly sums up the teachings on the interim (bar do'i rnam bzhag, *antariibhavavyavasthiina) given by Naropa, which are here listed in five very condensed points. These five points consist of three kinds of interim (bar do, *antariibhava), three kinds of body (lus, *deha), three kinds of preceding event (sngon du 'gro ba, *purvmJigama), three kinds of transition (mtshams sbyor, *pratisandhi), and three kinds of blending (bsre ba, *mifra). The introductory verses list the items belonging to these five triplets, which are going to be explained in detail below. Thereupon, the verses pay homage to the teacher Zhe sdang rdo rje (being the Tantric name of Mi la ras pa) and describe Naropa's instructions in general terms by employing the metaphor of a lotus flower and its nectar, which grows out of the ocean of the Tantras. The segment's second passage (DK.A.Khi.6.9b2-l0a2) narrates the transmission history of these instructions. First, the story of Naropa is told in bri ef, reporting that Naropa was born in Kashmir (yul kha che), became a pm:uj,ita learned in the five sciences, accomplished a recitation of a hundred thousand seven-syllable mantras of the deity CakrasmJivara, and then received a prediction (lung bstan, *vyiikarm:w) saying that he should go east and find Tailopa, who had been Naropa's teacher in seven former lives. Naropa and Tailopa finally met in the temple of Odantapuri, whereupon Tailopa gave to Naropa the stream of the four teachings on the instructions (gdams ngag gi bka' bzhi bahs pa). These four are comprised of (1) the stream of a teaching on the instructions from the master Nagarjuna (slob dpon klu sgrub kyi gdams ngag gi bka' gcig bahs), (2) the stream of a second teaching on the instructions from the great Briihma(ia Sarahapada (bram ze chen po sa ra ha pa 'i gdams ngag gi bka' gcig bahs), (3) the stream of a third teaching on the instructions from the master Kr�i:iapada (slob dpon nag po pa'i gdams ngag gi bka' gcig bahs), and (4) the stream of a fourth teaching on the instructions from the .QakinI Sukhasiddhi *Bhavyabhadra (mkha' 'gro ma sukha sid dhi skat pa bzang mo'i gdams ngag gi bka' gcig bahs pa). To obtain these teachings, Naropa had to stay with Tailopa for twelve years, in the span of which he under­went twelve life-threatening trials and hardships. Naropa, in tum, taught the transmissions to Bla ma Mar pa in the course of twelve years, while staying at the temple of VikramaS\"fla. Mar pa gave them to Bla ma Rngog [Chos sku rdo rje] after he thrice offered Mar pa all his possessions. This little history ends with an admonition saying that the instructions have only been taught to those who definitely will practice them but not to anyone who will not practice them. The segment's third passage (DK.A.Khi.6.l0a2-l0b2) lays out Naropa's presentation of the interim (bar do rnam gzhag bca' ba, *antariibhavavyavasthiina) in five triplets, making fifteen points in total. Citing two lines from the Hevajratantra (II.ii.30ab),1206 the teaching 1206 See Snellgrove (1959 .Il:48-49): yathii miiyii yathii svapnaf!1 yathii syiid antariibhavaqill .

SNELLGROVE (1959.1:91). The Dags po 'i bka' 'bum's quotation of the verse ends with the reading srid pa yin rather than srid yin pa. It might be noted that such a reading variant, perhaps a deliberate adjustment,"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"558 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum begins by stating that there are three interims (bar do, *antarabhava): (1) an interim of birth and death (skye shi bar do, *janmamarm:iantariibhava) lasting a life time, (2) an inte­rim of dream (rmi lam bar do, *svapniintariibhava) lasting from one begins to dream until one wakes up, and (3) an interim of becoming (srid pa bar do, *bhavantariibhava) lasting from one dies until one has arrived at a new body of reincarnation. These three states involve three different kinds of body (lus, *deha), namely: (1) a body formed by karmic ripening (rnam smin lus, *vipiikadeha) found in the interim of birth and death, (2) a body formed by habitual tendences (bag chags kyi lus, *viisaniideha) found in the interim of dream, and (3) a mentally [projected] body (yid kyi lus, *manodeha) found in the interim of becoming. Each interim has a particular antecedent, i.e., a phenomenon that precedes it (sngon du 'gro ba, >rpilrvm71gama): (1) the interim of birth and death is preceded by the radiance of all phenomena (chos thams cad 'od gsal), 1207 (2) the interim of dream is preceded by deep sleep (gnyid mt hug po), and (3) the interim of becoming is preceded by the radiance of death ('chi ka'i 'od gsal). Further, each interim has a certain spiritual practice or mundane event that is the transition (mtshams sbyor, >rpratisandhi) leading into it: (1) the meditative experience of the third Tantric empowerment (dbang gsum pa 'i nyams, i.e., sexual intercourse) leads into the interim of life and death, (2) an intense aspiration ('dun pa drag pa, *tfvracchandatii) leads into the interim of dream, and (3) [seeing the intercourse of] one's future parents (rang gi pha ma) leads into the interim of becoming. Finally, there are three manners of mixing (bsre ba, *mi.fra) with the interims: (1) since desire is predominant ('dod chags shas che ba, *utsadaraga) in the interim of birth and death, desire and meditation are mixed ('dod chags dang bsam gtan bsre ba yin); (2) since delusion is predominant (gti mug shas che ba, *utsadamoha) in the interim of dream, delusion and meditation are mixed (gti mug dang bsam gtan bsre ba); and (3) since dislike is predominant (zhe sdang shas che ba, *utsadadve�a) in the interim of becoming, dislike and meditation are mixed (zhe sdang dang bsam gtan bsre ba). These constitute the fifteen points of the teaching on the interim. The segment's fourth and final passage (DK.A.Khi.6. lObr l 9b2) gives the explanation on how to put the three types of interim into meditative practice (bar do nyams su Zen pa). This involves two instructions (man ngag, *iimniiya). The interims may either be practiced by makes the Tibetan version seem as if it reads bar ma'i srid pa in the sense of srid pa'i bar do (*bhavantarabhava) rather than bar ma'i srid yin pa as reflecting the Sanskrit original syad antarabhava1!1. The reading variant would thus agree better with the present segment's purpose of quoting the verse, namely to show that there is a scriptural basis for teaching a triple set of interims, namely the state of birth to death (skye shi bar do , here. equalled with the verse's mention of illusion, maya, sgyu ma), the state of dream (nni lam bar do = svapna, nni lam), and the state of becoming, i.e., from death till rebirth (srid pa'i bar do= *bhavantarabhava\"' syad antarabhava1!1, bar ma'i srid [p a}). 1207 This is how this antecedent is explained in the commentarial passage. In the introductory passage of the segment, this antecedent is stated to be \"tha t all phenomena are empty\" (chos thams cad stong pa)."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 559 relying on the instruction of mixing (bsre ba, *mifra), which is the method for reaching buddhahood through meditation, or the interims may be practiced by relying on Transfer­ence ('pho ba, *s0111kranti), which is the method for reaching buddhahood without meditating. As for mixing (DK.A.Khi.6.l0brl6b3), the yogf mixes the interim of birth and death with the practices of the Generation Stage and the Completion Stage of the deity practice (skye shi bar do la bskyed rdzogs gnyis kyi man ngag dang bsre) (DK.A.Khi.6.10bd 2b7). A necessary prerequisite (sngon du) for such mixing is to have trained thoroughly in the body and the winds (!us dang rlung sbyang ba ), because otherwise the practices would either produce physical illness or fail to create the desired meditative experiences (nyams myong), a point that is illustrated in the segment with an analogy of preserving curd (zho) in a leather sack (zho rkyal). The segment here briefly outlines how the yogf should arrange six daily sessions in the course of three days with practice of breathing exercises as the prerequiste for training in the body and the winds. Having completed this preliminary practice, the yogf enters into the practices of the Generation Stage (bskyed rim, *utpattikrama) where he visualizes the deities of any chosen ma�1tjala in an extensive, abbreviated, or middling manner (rgyas bsdus bar ma) as taught in texts on the Generation Stage (bskyed rim gzhung). The meaning of the practices of the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim, *s01?1pattikrama) is first narrated in the segment with an analogy of a road and three wild beasts, which is meant to illustrate how a week-long session of practicing the Completion Stage can cause the wisdom inherent in the body to overcome the three mental poisons of desire, anger, and delusion, and bring about realization of their non-conceptua­lity (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa). The analogy includes another citation from the Hevajratantra. The actual instruction on the Completion Stage is then taught through three key points. The first is the key point of the [right] time (dus kyi gnad), which involves a short explana­tion on when and how to meditate on the winds entering the central channel. The second is the key point of the body (lus kyi gnad), where the correct sitting position and mental appli­cation is shortly presented in five analogies known from the Instruction Manual (bka' dpe). The third is the key point of the object (yul gyi gnad), which is an explanation of the channels and cakras along with an instruction on how to meditate on Inner Heat (gtum mo). The gtum mo practice will produce sensations of heat (drod), then bliss (bde ba), and finally non-conceptuality (mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa) within a span of three to six months. It is stressed in the segment that it is highly important to undergo such training for six to seven months before attempting to perform other yogas, including the meditation on Illu­sory Body (sgyu lus) and Radiance ('od gsal). With such training in hand, these practices will be easy to achieve. When the yogf begins to undertake the practice of the other yogas, he will still perform the practice of Inner Heat occasionally before letting the other prac­tices become his main focus. The performance of this overall sequence of practice is what is meant with mixing the instructions on the Generation and Completion Stages in the interim of birth and death."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"560 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum The practices of mixing (bsre ba) also include a second aspect, namely the mixing of dream and meditation (rmi lam dang bsam gtan bsre ba) in the interim of dream (DK.A.Khi.6.13a1-14a3). The segment here gives a detailed presentation of the five points of the yoga of Dream (rmi lam). In brief, the first is to prepare the notion of dream (rmi lam gyi 'du shes sngon du btang ba) by contemplating and striving firmly to see all waking experiences and feelings to be entirely dream-like . The second is to use a method for not letting [unconscious] sleep set in (gnyid mi 'ong bar bya ba'i thabs), where the yogflays down to sleep while visualizing a flower having four petals and five syllables in the throat cakra, or alternatively a small white ball of light in the place between the eyebrows. These visualizations are intended to heighten the dreamer's level of awareness in the sleep, thereby allowing him consciously to enter into lucid dreaming. The third is to recognize the dream as dream (rmi lam la rmi lam du shes pa) by relying on a previously formed firm intention to do so, similar to how intense habits and impressions formed during the day may give rise to particular dream scenarios in the night. Once the yogf has learned how to enter into lucid dreaming and such a dream has occurred, the fourth point is to increase the dream (rmi lam spel ba) by increasing the number of images exponentially so that the effulgence of the images spread everywhere, filling the world with light. The fifth point is to purify the dream (rmi lam sbyang ba) by transforming dreams into liberated images, turning worlds into mm:i4ala palaces, beings into deities, and so forth. This will gradually produce medita­tive experiences of bliss-emptiness (bde stong gi nyams myong). These are the various meditations that the yogfperforms for as long as he lives. When he lies down to sleep (nyal ba'i dus su), he may feel the experience of Inner Heat rising up and enter into that, whereby he will practice Inner Heat in his dream (rmi lam la gtum mo sgom). Or he may feel the experience of Dream rising up, in which case he may put aside the practice of Inner Heat and meditate on Dream (gtum mo bzhag nas rmi lam sgom). Gradu­ally, he strives towards letting the meditative experiences extend beyond the meditation session so that he attains an achievement in which there is no difference between medita­tion and post-meditation, though it is underlined that this is very difficult to accomplish. Next, the segment (DK.A.Khi.6.14ad6b3) explains how these meditative experiences will allow the yogf to mix them into the interim of becoming (srid pa bar dor bsre), whereby he may either recognize dhannak iiya in the first phase of the interim (bar do dang po) by relying on the radiant light of death ('chi ka 'i 'od gsal), or he may recognize the state of union (zung 'jug gi sku) in the second phase of the interim (bar do gnyis pa) by relying on the impure illusory body (ma dag pa'i sgyu lus), or he may close the door of rebirth into the six sa-rrtsiiric existences ('gro drug gi sgo dgag pa) in the third phase of the interim (bar do gsumpa). The segment here explains the stages of dying, including the various outer and inner signs of each step and the visualizations to be done, and gives advice on how the meditator and nurse (nad g.yog pa) should place the body and observe with the mind. Quotations are given in support of these explanations from the fourth chapter of the Vajrapaiijaratantra (gur). If the meditative experience of the yogf's preceding practice is firm, it is possible for"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 561 him to recognize the nature of the mind as dharmakaya when the process of dying culminates in the appearance of radiance of death ('chi ka 'i 'od gsal). To prepare for dying, the segment also describes a meditation with a visualization that gently simulates the stages of dying. If the meditator is unable to recognize dharmakaya in the radiance of death during the first interim phase (bar do dang po), he will enter into the second interim phase (bar do gnyis pa), where he may remain for up to seven week-long intervals, i.e., for a maximum of up to forty-nine days. During this time he may recognize the impure illusory body (ma dag pa'i sgyu lus) as being the body of union (zung 'jug gi sku). The deceased person wakes up in the interim state after a period of unconsciousness lasting around three and a half days. He will remember his former life and the people he knew and realize that he is dead. At this point, he should meditate on the mental body (yid kyi !us) that he has in the interim as being the body of the deity, e.g., Hevajra. Given his earlier deep meditative experiences of his mind being bliss-emptiness, he is able to immerse himself in a deep meditative absorption in the interim, which may last up to several days. The result thereof will be the attainment of the body of union (zung 'jug gi sku). If the yogi is unsuccessful therewith, he will enter into the third interim phase (bar do gsum pa), where he will have to attempt to block the door of rebirth into the six courses of sa171saric existence ('gro drug gi sgo dgag pa). At first he will have a premonition of where he is going to be reborn, his future parents, and his future life. However, this rebirth can be prevented if he firmly avoids feeling any desire and dislike to the mother and father. To avoid this, he should view the father as his guru and the mother as his guru's female partner, and should think that he requests the guru and his female partner for empowerment and instructions. Alternatively, he can visualize the future parents as the deity Hevajra in union. If he is unable to keep the door to rebirth shut, he will eventually enter into a new rebirth. Here he should make strong wishes to be born in a beneficial life as the child of Dharma practitioners. If he makes such wishes while again seeing the future parents as the teacher and his partner or as the deity, then he will be led to a good rebirth. In these various ways, the practices of mixing the interim of life and death with the instruction of the Generation and Completion Stages and the practices of mixing the interim of dream with meditation are the meditations in which to train in the present life. Based on the meditative experiences derived therefrom, it becomes possible to recognize dharma­kaya in the first interim phase when the radiance of death appears, or to recognized the body of union in the second interim phase when the impure illusory body appears, or to block the door of rebirth in the third interim phase. These are all the methods for attaining buddhahood through meditation (bsgoms nas sangs rgya ba'i thabs) by relying on the in­structions of mixing (bsre ba'i man ngag). The second instruction (man ngag, *amnaya) for putting the three types of interim into meditative practice (bar do nyams su Zen pa) is the practice of Transference ('pho ba, *sary1-kranti), being the method for reaching buddhahood without meditating (ma bsgoms par sangs rgya ba 'i thabs). The segment (DK.A.Khi.6. l 6b3-l 9b2) presents three kinds of Trans­ference: (1) Transference through training (sbyangs te 'pho ba), (2) Transference using a"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"562 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum forceful method (btsan thabs su 'pho ba), and (3) Transference through manipulating the body (!us bcos te 'pho ba). The practice of Transference through training (sbyangs te 'pho ba) begins with training in the winds (rlung sbyang ba). The segment explains the right sitting posture and how to hold the breath in the technique called pot-like breathing (bum pa can, *kumbhaka). The practitioner must train in holding the breath in the abdomen for an extended period of time. A counting technique is taught where one circles the right hand over the right knee three times and then snaps the fingers; this movement equals one measure and each measure should be counted with a malii held in the left hand. The technique is said to have origi­nated with the Indian master (slob dpon) Vagisvaraklrti (Ngag gi dbang phyugs grags pa, who flourished at Nalanda in the early eleventh century). Using this technique, the best practitioner should become able to hold the breath for 108 measures, the middling one for 72 measures, and the lesser one for 36 measures. Once the practitioner has become able to hold the breath with the kumbhaka technique for at least 36 measures, he is ready to proceed to the next part of the practice. The next step is then to train in the technique of Transference ( 'pho ba sbyang ba) for up to seven days. The sitting position is the same as above and the nine places on the body considered orifices should be blocked by visualizing particular mantric syllables at each place.120 8 A visualization of the channels focus on the navel cakra is then explained along with a technique for gradually elevating the consciousness up through the body to a point on top of the brain and right below the skull, and thereafter making it descend down through the body again to the navel cakra. The segment also describes the physical signs that accompany the successful practice. It is said that once the practice has been accom­plished, it will be available to the yogi no matter how many years pass by before death comes and the practice thereby becomes actual. When some day the signs of the beginning of the death process have clearly ap­peared, 1209 the practitioner may begin to apply the technique of the actual Transference ('pho ba dngos). First, the practice is done for some time in the manner that it was originally trained in order to refresh the technique. Then the dying practitioner visualizes several wind ma�u;falas at various points of the body and visualizes a small hole at the top of the skull. When the consciousness ascends up through the body, it is hurled out through the top of the skull and enters into the heart of the deity, who has been visualized above the head, and the yogi then sees himself as becoming the deity. This is the practice of Transfer­ence through training (sbyangs te 'pho ba). The second technique taught here is called Transference using a forceful method (btsan thabs su 'pho ba, *ha.thayogasm71kriinti), which should be used in case of sudden death if 1208 Although described as orifices (sgo, lit. 'doors') some of the listed places do not belong to the usual bodily orifices (i.e., eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, urinal tract, anus), namely the spot between the eyebrows and the navel. 1209 The segment gives a quotation from the Caturp�thatantra (gdan bzhi rtsa rgyud) to illustrate this point."},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 563 there is little or no time to perform the Transference through training. The segment teaches two different methods. In both cases, the body is sitting upright and the larynx is manipu­lated. In one technique, the yogf focuses his awareness on a small ball of white light between the eyebrows. In the other technique, the yogf ejects his consciousness up through the top of his head using a simplified visualization and sends it into the he art of the deity visualized above his head. The third technique is called Transference through manipulating the body (!us bcos te 'pho ba), which may be employed if neither of the two above techniques can be applied. When an ordinary person is dying, one approach is to place the body in the lion-like resting pose (seng ge nyal stabs), in which the Buddha lay when he passed away. This will prevent rebirth in the three lower realms. Another approach is likewise to lie in the lion-like resting pose, but to this is added the visualization of the bla ma and the deity in front of the dying person. Using a simplified visualization, the dying person ejects the consciousness from the navel cakra up through the top of the skull and into the heart of the deity and thereby becomes the deity. These meditations on mixing (bsre ba) and transference ('pho ba) are the techniques for putting the three interims into practice. In other to create conducive conditions for these practices, the yogf should observe the various kinds of Tantric conduct (spyod pa, *cwya) to the extent possible, which are taught in chapter fifteen of the Vajrapaiijaratantra (Gur). These were the oral instructions (zhal gdams pa) of the bla mas. The segment ends (DK.A.Khi.6.19b2_7) with a long colophon (cited in Tibetan above), which says: The yogf holding the transmission of the four teachings (bka ' bzhi babs pa), Tai­lopa, who is renowned for being an [Awakened] emanation (sprul sku, *nirmii�w­kiiya), taught these [instructions to] Naropa.

The colophon is notable in that it directly attributes the text to the hand of Candraprabha Kumara (zla 'ad gzhon nu), who it refers to with the first person pronoun \"I\" (bdag). The name Candraprabha Kumara evidently refers to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen. Yet, it is difficult to determine merely on the basis of the colophon whether this attribution of authorship is authentic. Generally speaking, the epithet Candraprabha Kumara seems first to have come into use as a name for Bsod nams rin chen shortly after Bsod nams rin chen's demise. As discussed in the preceding part of this book, it was possibly initiated by Phag mo gru pa's eulogy of Bsod nams rin chen composed at the occasion of Bsod nams rin chen's funeral, wherein Phag mo gru pa poetically compared the deceased master to the bodhisattva Candraprabha Kumara known from the Samiidhiriijas(itra.1211 It may be the case that the text truly was composed by Bsod nams rin chen and that the colophon was added to the text at a later point of its transmission; it may be that the colophon is authentic in its attribution in which case the present use of the name Candraprabha Kumara would constitute a unique attestation of Bsod nams rin chen using this name with reference to himself; or it may be that the text was composed later along with its colophon and that the authorship attribution consequently is inauthentic.

It is an instruction on the channels and winds (rtsa rlung gi man ngag), which is here referred to as \"the flow and burning of the a-stroke\" (a thung gi 'bah bsr eg). First, the segment describes the inner visualization of channels, cakras, and syllables. Thereupon, it instructs the yogi how to make the inner fire of the visualized a-stroke in the navel-cakra rise up and consume the higher cakras, causing a downward flow of bodhicitta, which leads to an experience of bliss-emptiness.

It commences by listing three alternative ways of referring to these instructions, viz. \"the Inner Heat of the tradition of this instruction\" (gdam ngag 'di yi lugs kyi gtum mo), \"the flow of heat through a forceful method\" (drod btsan thabs su dbab pa), 1214 and \"drawing out the winds from the bodily channels\" (!us kyi rtsa la rlung zug dbyung ba). The segment then briefly lists how practicing with the winds and channels may heal a number of bodily ailments caused by disturbances in the winds. It briefly instructs the practitioner how to sit in the right bodily posture while locking the arms against the thighs, how to control and hold the breath in the abdomen, and how to manipulate the posture through different positions of the legs and hands.

First, it briefly lays out the history (lo rgyus) of the Indian transmission of the practice, saying that the practice of Inner Heat was first taught by the deity Heruka (i.e., Hevajra) to his consort Nairatmya (bdag med ma). She taught it to Ela ma Tailopa, who taught it to the Tantric master Slob dpon Qorpbhipa. Next, the segment presents how the practice are to be carried out (dgos ched, *karya).1216 The correct sitting position (!us kyi gnad) and the inner visualization (sems kyi gnad) are briefly explained in accordance with the instructions given in the relevant texts of the 1213 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.199b6-200a6, DK.B.Khi.8.20b3-2la3, DK.D.Khi.8.21a2-2lb4, DK.Q.Khi.8.473 br474a3, DK.R.Khi.8.33�-33h DK.S.Khi.8.34b3-35hJ, DK.T.Khi.8.21 n-21 b, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Thereupon, a series of countermeasures (log gnon) are presented, which are said to remedy different physical problems that may arise during the practice. These problems include cases when the blood rushes the wrong way (khrag log); when the winds wrongly surge to the upper body (rlung stod du log); when the winds wrongly surge to the lower body (smad du log); when the experience of heat reverses (drod log); when the bodily micro-organisms (srin [bu], *krmi) become agitated (srin log); how the yogi should focus when moving about ('gro ); and how the yogi should focus when lying down to sleep (nyal). For each case, it is recommended to counter the problem or situation by focusing on a specific mantric syllable, bodily exercise, or breathing exercise. The segment has no colophon.

It ends (DK.A.Khi. l 0.22b4) with the brief colophon: /bla ma'i gtum mo rnam gsum mo.1217 The segment summarizes the so­called sixteen doctrines (chos bcu drug) of Bla ma Naropa's instructions into three general types of Inner Heat practice (gtum mo, *ciiFrJiili). The first type of Inner Heat is called the Action Practice of Inner Heat (las kyi gtum mo). Here the practice consists in visualizing the a-stroke syllable (a sh ad), a simple vertical stroke, in the secret place (gsang gnas, *guhyasthiina). During the meditation, the stroke turns into a flame that flares up and burns away all habitual tendencies (bag chags, *viisanii) and negative energies (gdon, *graha). The explanation is supported by a scriptural quota­tion from the Sa'!iputatantra. The second type of Inner Heat is called Blazing Inner Heat ('bar ba 'i gtum mo). First an explanation is given on the key point of the body (lus kyi gnad), referring to the correct bodily posture for performing the yoga. This is followed by the key point of the channels (rtsa'i gnad), where a brief outline is given of the two side channels and the central channel. Next, the segment explains the key point of the winds (rlung gi gnad). These are the breaths and vital energies that flow in the channels. These winds are related to the process of dualistic perception where perception is divided into a perceiver ('dzin pa, *griihaka) and something perceived (gzung ba, *griihya). The winds (rlung, *viiyu) are compared to hor­ses (rta), while the awareness or consciousness (rig pa, *v idyii) which moves through the body on the winds is comp ared to men (mi) riding the horses, i.e., horse-riders. Finally, the passage explains how the yogi must persevere in the practice with great discipline until the channels and winds have come under control and become honed and workable (las su rung ba, *karma(iya). This achievement is indicated by the appearance of the smoke-like sign (rtags du ba lta bu) and the experience of heat (drod, *upnan), suggesting that the winds have started to enter into the central channel. Once this level has been reached, the yogi may begin to focus on the third type of Inner Heat practice, which is called the Inner Heat of Mahiimudrii (phyag rgya chen po'i gtum 1217 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.200b5-201 b6, DK.B.Khi.10.21 b3-22b4, DK.D.Khi. l 0.22�-23a5, DK.Q.Khi.10.474br475bi, DK.R.Khi.1 0.34b5-36b4, DK.S.Kh i.10.36a1-38bi, DK.T.Khi.10.22n-23n, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

Here the yogi exerts no control over the sense faculties, he does not focus on the inner fire, he does not focus on the channels, and he does not control the winds. Rather, he rests meditatively in a natural state, wherein four experiences of vision (!ta ba), emptiness (stong pa), bliss (bde ba), and union (zung 'jug) spontaneously arise inwardly without depending on anything extrinsic (gzhan la ma ltos pa). The segment ends with a short colophon (cited in Tibetan above) stating: \"These are the teacher's three kinds ofinner Heat.\" Segment DK.A.Khi.11: The segment begins (DK.A.Khi. l 1.22b4): zhabs rjes gsang spyod ma zhes bya ba 'all /bla ma rin po che la phyag 'tshal lo/ /dang po byang chub kyi serns gsum/.

The practitioner is instructed to begin by engendering the threefold resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta) and visualizing himself appearing instantly as the deity (lha, *devatii). He should then make a physical footprint (zhabs rjes) on the ground in front of himself. While focusing his mind on the footprint, the mantra of emptiness (sunyatii) should be recited thrice and the yogi should think that out of the state of emptiness the footprint emerges as a representation of the teacher (bla ma, *g uru). A series of visualizations follow, where the practitioner focuses on seed syllables (sa ban, *bfja), purificatory lights shining out and returning, and that the teacher and all sentient beings assume the form of the deity. Other lights invite all buddhas and bodhisatt­vas as well as all <;fiikas and rjdkinls who dissolve into the footprint. Thereupon, the practi­tioner performs ritual worship of the footprint and prays to it using the seven-branch service (yan lag bdun pa), wishing for the perfection of meditation, insight, and realization. The ritual ends with a dedication of merit (dge ba bsngo) and wishing prayers (smon lam). An additional purificatory ritual may be performed at the end using the hundred-syllable man­tra (yi ge brgya pa) in order to dispel doubts and obstacles and to purify failed Tantric observances (dam tshig nyams pa). It is explained that this ritual can be performed in the case that the teacher no longer is present and the yogi wishes to perform worship, pray for his blessing, and purify his Tantric bonds. The practice may be enhanced by having the footprint ritually blessed with a consecration ritual (rab gnas, *prasthiina). Finally, it is stated that since this use of a foot­print is a secret practice (gsang spyod, *guhyacarya), it should not be revealed to others. The segment ends with a short colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"This was the instruction of using a footprint.

It begins by making clear that learning the practice of 'pho ba is important, since the practitioner never knows when death will come and it may come before he reaches perfection in his other practices.

The purpose of examining such signs of imminent death ('chi ltas brtags) is to establish whether and when there may be a need for commencing the yogic practice of Transference ('pho ba). It may be added that the said signs are not regular physiological indication, as may be determined by a physician shortly before the coming of death, but rather they are omens in the form of shapes that appear visually when the yogf gazes into a cloudless sky or when he observes his shadow while using particular mantras and mudras at certain times 1221 Correlated passages: DK.a.Nga. l 56aH, DK.B.Khi.14.26b1.2, DK.D.Khi.14.27<4-s, DK.Q.Khi.14.478b1-479ai.

In some cases, it is said to be possible to prevent the predicted death by performing so-called death proxy rituals ('chi blu), where the danger of death is ritually transferred onto a surrogate drawing or a figurine representing the person who is close to dying. The second part of the segment (DK.A.Khi.15.27ar27b1) briefly mentions two methods for Transference ('pho ba, *smJikriinti). Here the dying yogfeither ejects the consciousness into the Pure Land of Sukhiivatf (bde ba can) or into the heart of the deity who is visualized in front of the meditator. The segment also outlines a bodily posture that may be used for facilitating Transference in a dying person and it gives a short explanation on the various forms of Sa7Jisaric rebirth that result if the consciousness leaves the dead body via this or that bodily orifice. The segment adds a quotation on Transference practices from the Vajra­paiijara Tantra (rdo rj e gur) and states that these practices are also presented in the Indian Cakrasm?ivara literature. It ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the instruction of the great Naro[pa], which [gives] rise to the actualization of buddhahood.\" Segment DK.A.Khi.16: The segment begins (DK.A.Khi.16.28a1): /b la ma grub thob rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ /bar do 'chi ka ma 'i man ngag bri/.

Regarding the three interims, instructions are given on mixing (bsre ba 'i man ngag) and on identifying the illusory body (sgyu !us ngos bzung ba). First, the various aspects of mixing (bsre ba, *mifra) are presented for each of the three interims. The first interim is the interim from birth to death (skye shi bar do), where the yogf strives to realize radiance ('od gsal) by mixing the path and the nature (lam dang rang bzhin bsre ba). This interim is transitioned (mtshams sbyor) by the third empowerment (dbang gsum pa), which is associated with the meditative experience of co-emergent knowledge (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes nyams su myong ba). The second interim is the interim of dream (rmi lam bar do), where the yogf strives to realize the nature of dream (nni lam) by mixing day-and night-time experience (nyin mtshan bsre ba). This interim is transitioned (mtshams sbyor) by refraining from close association with too many people and other activities and by forming a firm inner resolve to accomplish the practice of dream. 1223 For an annotated English translation, with further references, of an extensive passage on a range of various similar prediction practices for examining portents of death found in a twelfth­century Indian Tantric text from the non-Buddhist Jaina tradition, namely Hemacandra's Yo gasastra, see QUARNSTROM (2002:112-134). 1224 Correlated passages: DK.cx.Nga.157b1-l59a6, DK.B.Khi.16.28a1-29b5, DK.D.Khi.1 6.28b4-30bi, DK.Q.Khi.1 6.480a5-48 lh DK.R.Khi.16.46br49b4, DK.S.Khi.16.47br50h DK.T.Khi. l 6.28b-30b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

The interim is transitioned (mtshams sbyor) by the sexual Tantric kannamudra practices associated with the second empowerment (dbang gnyis pa), understanding all phenomena to be illusory, and not harboring any kind of attachment or envy. These practices will enable the yogf to avoid feeling sexual attraction and envy towards the parents of future rebirth in the interim of becoming. Moreover, with regard to mixing (bsre ba, *mifra), the segment provides a series of further details for each interim. As to how the interim between birth and death should be mixed with the interim of dream, an instruction is given on how to perform the practice of dream yoga (rmi lam). The yogf learns to fall asleep while remaining lucidly aware by relying on a visualization of syllables in the throat cakra. As sleep sets in, the yogfwill first -before the onset of dreams -perceive the mind's radiance ('od gsal), which is dharma­kaya. Thereupon, dreams begin to arise and the yogf trains in recognizing that he is dreaming. He trains himself by manipulating the dreams, seeing anything scary in the dream as mere illusion. When the dreams cease to arise in the state of deep sleep, the yogf again perceives the mind's natural radiance ('od gsal), which is dharmakaya. Finally, when the yogfwakes up, he should again meditate on the experience of dream and reality , seeing all phenomena as dreams. In this manner, he mixes the path and the real nature (lam dang rang bzhin bsre ba), the dream and the real nature (rmi lam dang rang bzhin bsre ba), as well as day and night (nyin mtshan bsre ba). Following these yogic dream instructions, the segment presents how these practices are linked with the processes of dying ('chi ba). As the various bodily elements dissolve one into another at death and the breathing stops, the consciousness enters the state of radiance ('od gsal), which emerges as dharmakaya. If the yogfis able to recognize this state for what it is, he realizes buddhahood there and then. The segment refers to this state as \"the interim with complete qualities\" (yon tan rdzogs pa 'i bar do) and as \"the pure illusory body\" (dag pa'i sgyu lus). If unable to rest therein, the yogfis instructed to let himself arise from within this state in the illusory form of the deity (lha 'i sku sgyu ma), which the segment refers to as \"the interim of entering in the manner of sa111sara\" ('khor ba lugs su 'jug pa'i bar do) and \"the impure illusory body\" (ma dag pa'i sgyu lus). As this impure illusory body is incine­rated (bsregs) by the fire of radiance ('od gsal gyi me), the yogf meditates on non-duality (gnyis med, *advaya), which constitutes the stage called union [still] entailing training (slob pa'i zung 'jug, *saik�ayuganaddha). As the illusory body then dissolves (thim) into the state of radiance, there is no longer anything to meditate on, which is the stage called union of no training (mi slob pa'i zung 'jug, *a§aik�ayuganaddha). For the yogf who is not successful in attaining these levels, the segment provides a final instruction on identifying the illusory body (sgyu lus ngos bzung ba 'i man ngag), as illustrated with a quotation from a Tantra saying that those who wish to recognize the interim (bar do) should train in seeing things as being like illusions (sgyu ma lta bu).

The segment ends with a short colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the instruction on the interim (bar do 'i man ngag). [This] instruction [stemming] from the bla mas who have attained accomplishment throughout the generations of the transmission lineage, being a practical guidance (dmar khrid) which has been transmitted in a lineage from one generation [of practiti oners] to another, was [here] written down as a means to avoid forgetting it (brjed byang). \" Segment DK.A.Khi.17: The segment begins (DK.A.Khi.17.29b4): //c hos rj e dags po lha 1je 'i gsung/ bar do gsum gyi gdams pa lags// /bla ma grub thob rnams la phyag 'tshal lo! lm khas pa chen po na ro pas/.

It commences by quoting the first five verse-lines from the text \"Mar pa's Eight Verses\" (Mar pa'i tshigs bead brgyad ma), which introduce the Indian teacher Nampa and the instruction he received on the three interims. Having cited the verses, the segment then states that it will explain the meaning of these lines (shes bya ba 'i don ni 'di lta ste). It should be noted that text DK.A.Ci in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum provides a full commentary on these verses by Mar pa. The three interims explained here include the interim between birth and death (skye shi bar do), the interim of dream (rmi lam bar do), and the interim of bec oming (srid pa bar do). For each interim, the segment identifies the type of body (lus, *de ha) it involves, the type of mixing (bsre ba) to performed by the practitioner in each case, and the kind of attainment that may be achieved. These explanations concord with what was said about the three interims in previous segments dealing with this topic, e.g., in segments DK.A.Tsa.5, DK.A.Tsa.10, DK.A.Tsa.11, DK.A.Tsha.3, and DK.A.Khi.6. The present segment, however, makes some additional remarks on the mental poisons (dug gsum) of desire ('dod chags), anger (zhe sdang), and delusion (gti mug) by relating each to a particular interim, to a particular type of meditative experience, and to a particular risk of sm?isliric rebirth. Desire ('dod chags, *raga) is said generally to lead to rebirth as a hungry ghost (yi dags, *p reta), the yogi transforms (bsgyur) it into the meditative experience of bliss (bde ba, *sukha), but if attachment to meditative bliss becomes strong, it may lead to rebirth as a god in the desire realm ('dod khams kyi lha). Anger (zhe sdang, *dve�a) generally leads to rebirth as a hell-being (dmyal ba, *naraka), the yogi transforms anger into the meditative experi ence of radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhasvara), but if he grows attached to this form of 1225 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.13'16-14a1, DK.B.Khi.17.29b5-30a5, DK.D.Khi.1 7.30br3la3, DK.Q.Khi.1 7.481 br482a7, DK.R.Khi. l 7.49b4-50b4, DK.S.Khi.17.50b3-5lh DK.T.Khi.17.30b-3ln, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

The segment ends by admonishing the practitioner that it consequently is very important that the meditator regards all meditative experiences as belonging to his own mind (rang gi sems), that he realizes that the mind is birthless (skye med), and that he thus avoids clinging to meditative experiences. If the yogi is able to prevent such weaknesses, he is able to transform the meditative experience of bliss into sary1bhogakaya, the experience of radiance into nirmii.lJ,akaya, and the experience of non-conceptuality into dharmakaya. The inseparability of the three kiiyas is the body of great bliss (bde ba chen po'i sku, *mahn­sukhakaya). The segment has no colophon.

The former is the stage of traversing the path (lam) and it lasts for as long as the practitioner needs to maintain effort in upholding non-distraction (ma yengs par skyong ba). The latter is the stage when all habitual tendencies (bag chags, *vnsana) have been purified; it begins when the stream of conceptuality (rtog pa, *vikalpa) has been cut off. The segment then says that there are two different ways of presenting union (zung 'jug, *yuganaddha). The tradition of the Practice Lineage (sgrub brgyud kyi lugs) speaks of the union of meditative experience (nyams su myong ba, *anubhava) and birthlessness (skye med, *anutpanna).

These are summed up in four sets of four. The first set of four is called the four hidden [points] (sba ba bzhi). This includes explanations on generating the deity and the proctective circle ('khor lo). Next, the yogi is taught to visualize the inner channels (rtsa). The yogi then produces fire in the secret place (gsang ba 'i gnas) in the abdomen and, finally, he learns to control the winds (rlung). The second set is the four assisting conditions (rkyen bzhi). These are the conditions that facilitate bliss (bde ba'i rkyen) by avoiding mundane activities (while being in the retreat), facilitate clarity (gsal ba 'i rkyen) by not suppressing the senses, facilitate non-conceptuality (mi rtog pa'i rkyen) by being without attachment, and facilitate non-duality or indifference (gnyis su med pa 'am/ tha mi dad pa 'i rkyen) by remaining at ease an d non-artificial.

Text DK.A.Gi contains three seemingly unrelated works, apart from the fact that the first two works deal in different ways with issues that may be seen as being somewhat extraneous to the practitioner's inner spiritual practice. 1229 Usually the phrase snang ba gsum po refers to the three stages of the after-process of dying called 'light' (snang ba, *iiloka), 'rising [light]' ([snang ba] mched pa, *[iiloka]vrddhi), and 'arrival' (thob pa, *labdha), which in the present context might possibly also include certain corresponding phases of the deity practice. However, the instructions on these three stages are usually associated with the Completion Stage practices (rdzogs rim) and not with the Generation Stage (bskyed rim). Since the title of the present segment indicates that its explanations of results only pertain to the Generation Stage practices, it is possible that the phrase snang ba gsum po here might refer to something else, namely, an unspecified element of bskyed rim deity practice. 1230 The Complete Awakenings (mngon par byang chub pa, *abhisaf!1bodh i) are five steps of generating the deity, which correspond to stages of embryology. See the explanations and further references given in the summary of segment DK.A.Ki.2. 1231 The phrase gtsang ma'i gnas must be a metrical verse equivalent of the term gnas gtsang ma (§uddhiiviisa), which in the Indian Abhidhanna literature is the name for five levels of the Form Realm (gzugs khams, rilpadhiitu). The phrase should not be confused with the pure realms (dags pa 'i zhing khams) of the Buddhas. 1232 The printer's and scribal colophon of DK.A.Khi.20 is reproced in DK.R.Khi.20.52bs 7."},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"576 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum The first work is a little treatise (bstan bcos, *sastra) entitled Th e Ambrosia Rosary of Good Counsel (Gros 'debs bdud rtsi 'phreng ba).

The colloquial language (phal skad) used in this text stands apart from the more stylized literary form of Classical Tibetan or Dharma language (chos skad) seen applied in various degrees in other parts of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum.1233 Consequently, the present work is significant in terms of understanding the linguistic range of Tibetan writing styles employed in the material of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, which is related to appreciating the literary attitudes and strategies adopted by the writers of the texts. The second work is a text called An Examination of the Four Ghosts ('Dre bzhi rtsad gcod), which discusses superstitious beliefs in different kinds of ghosts, stressing that the yogf should neither believe in ghosts nor be afraid of them. It then teaches a few meditation techniques that utilize beliefs in ghosts in order to aid the practiti oner's other contemplative practices. It ends with a short explanation on the nature of the mind. It may be noteworthy that the title of the text contains the word 'cutting' (gcod). Hence, the teachings given here might be regarded as a variant form of gcod practice, comparable to such gcod practices known in other Tibetan contemplative traditions of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, in particular teachings on Pacification (zhi byed) stemming from the Indian master Pha Dam pa sangs rgyas (died 1117) and the female Tibetan teacher Ma gcig slab sgron (ca. 1055-1149).

A true practitioner shies away from all such things, is content with the bare necessities, and seeks a practice retreat in the isol ation of the wilderness (ri khrod kyi dgon sa). If he gets sick, he gets sick like a dog. If he dies, he dies like a dog. Like all past buddhas, bodhisattvas and accomplished lords among yogfs (rnal 'byor gyi dbang phyug grub pa thob pa) who abandoned their prosperous lives at the royal palaces, practiced austerities, and underwent countless hardships, it is said that we practitioners must practice the Dharma without harboring hopes. There is no accomplishment without hardship (dka' spyad). As the yogf stays alone on a mountain for month after month, it does not help to hope for being heard by others, for gaining fame and respect, or for reaching special meditative experiences and qualities. Even if others were to request teachings, what could the practitioner possibly teach to them besides instructing them in desires and clinging, given that the inner negative habituation is so strong? Being a teacher like that is evil. The way of acting of the Bka' brgyud pas is not to care at all for fame or lack of fame, for respect or disrespect, for one's own happiness or suffering, but only to practice. The segment here quotes the master Ras chung pa (rje btsun ras chung pa), who was another student of Mi la ras pa. His saying describes how to deal with obstacles (bar chad) . It is notable that quotations attributed to Ras chung pa are very rare in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum, making the present quotation rather unique. The segment then admonishes the practitioner to stay in retreat and tame his own mind. If he talks with others, he should only mention his own shortcomings. If someone praises him, he should praise others. His only wealth should be noble qualities and meditative experiences. His mind should completely free from deceit. If he encounters someone of negative verbal or bodily behavior, he must avoid entertaining critical or bad thoughts, and should merely think to himself that this person's behavior might be some secret spiritual instruction that this person has received. As a follower of the Mahayana, the practitioner must think compassionately of such people, remembering that they were his own helpful parents in former lives. In essence, it is said, a Mahayana practitioner cannot allow the slightest leeway for harboring anger but must apply himself to the practice of patience and endurance (bzod pa, *k�anti), no matter what difficulty or insult others inflict on him. It is simply meaningless to enter the door to the Dharma and then carrying on criticizing others. One can never truly know the intentions of others and who might be a saint within. Speaking in a direct voice, the segment admonishes: Offer what is good to others and keep what is bad to yourself. Even if you understood all the three baskets of the teachings (sde snod gsum, *tripi_taka), do not prattle like a parrot. You will thereby only end up like a"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"578 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum physician who knew all remedies but who died without taking any medicine.

No matter how great your generosity, how pure your conduct, or how many special powers you have attained, these mean nothing if they do not bring you liberation from SaJ?1Siira by realizing the nature of the mind. For attaining such realization one has to devote oneself to a teacher (bla ma) with a proper transmission lineage, receive his blessing, and practice the instructions (gdams ngag). These were a selection of the various sentiments and varied advice given in the text. The segment ends with a short colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"This counsel for the mind, which on the spot lists all faults an d shortcomings, a mirror for seeing one's own faults, is entitled Th e Ambrosia Rosary of Good Counsel.\" Segment DK.A.Gi.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Gi.2.8b7): /chos rj e dags po lha rj e'i gsung/ 'dre bzhi rtsad gcod bzhugs sol/ lbla ma dam pa rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ /'dre bzhi gcodpa'i gdampa 'di la don gnyisl.

The first type is called naturally occurring ghosts (lliun gyi grub pa'i 'dre), which refers to mundane spirit rulers (srid pa'i mes po), such as the god Brahman (!ha tshangs pa), the lord of the land (sa bdag) 'Phags pa, and other kinds of ruling spirits (gdon thams cad kyi mes po). The segment argues that such beings do not really exist and that they therefore cannot inflict any harm. The second type is called mundane ancestral ghosts (srid pa khungs kyi 'dre), such as guardians (mgon po), goddesses (lha mo), or kings (rgyal po) that have been handed down from one's parents. The segment again argues that such beings are not real. The third type is called conceptual ghosts (rnam par rtog pa'i 'dre). These refer to assu­ming that certain living people are ghosts (mi ma shi bar 'dre ru bzung), such as witches (ma mo) or possessors of evil eyes (mig mthong mkhan po), and believing that they will harm one. Here as well the segment argues that ideas are unreal and that such ideas therefore also cannot be held responsible for inflicting concrete harm. The fourth type is called ghosts who were humans (mi las gyur pa'i 'dre), like when a witch (ma mo) claims that people who have died turn into ghosts that may bring harm or benefit. The segment argues against this belief in light of that it does not fit logically with the Buddhist teaching on reincarnation into the six realms of smrisiira. The segment then 1235 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ga.127ar129a5, DK.B.Gi.2.8brl la3, DK.D.Gi.2.9a6-l lh DK.Q.Gi.2.491 a4-493as, DK.R.Gi.2.14b1-l 8bi, DK.S.Gi.2. l 5a1-l 9a1, DK.T.Gi.2.9n-1 1 b, Phyag chen mdzod vol.

After discussing these four types of ghosts, the segment moves on to an examination of evil spirits (gdon, *graha) and great evil spirits (gdon chen po). It says that all evil spirits are simply ideas or thoughts (rnam par rtog pa, *vikalpa) that subside in the body in the form of winds (rlung, *vayu). Thus, when wind moves in the energy channel of delusion (gti mug gi rtsa, *mohanarji), it is the evil spirit of serpents (klu gdon, *niiga). When it moves in the channel of anger (zhe sdang gi rtsa, *dve.Janiir/i), it is in the nature of ruling spirits (btsan) and male malevolent spirits (pho gdon). When it moves in the channel of desire ('dod chags kyi rtsa, *riiganarji), it is demonesses (bsen mo) and female malevolent spirits (mo gdon). In other words, all such evil spirits just amount to the three mental poisons (dug gsum) and thoughts (rnam par rtog pa). As for the great evil spirits (gdon chen po), these are spirits that are said to produce intense, subtle, or even hidden emotional states and thoughts, which in turn may give rise to illnesses or harm. Again, the segment argues that such beings do not exist and that, in fact, beliefs in such spirits simply refer to various forms of conceptuality (rnam par rtog pa, *vikalpa). The text here quotes a passage attributed to Naropa making a similar statement. Concepts, emotions, and thoughts are ultimately not rooted in reality but in conceptuality and are baseless. Next, the segment turns to explain a few contemplative foci (gnad du bsnun pa)1236 with regard to beliefs in ghosts and spirits, particularly aimed at realizing their lack of reality. The meditator should sit in a comfortable meditation posture, engender the resolve for Awakening (byang chub kyi sems, *bodhicitta), visualize himself in the form of his chosen deity (rang yi dam !ha), visualize the teacher (bla ma, *guru) and the Three Jewels (dkon mchog, *ratna) above his head. He should then pay homage to them with devotion while wi shing that he through this practice will become free from the superstition of believing in ghosts and spirits. Having done so, he should rest the mind in an unfabricated state wherein no duality is upheld between the thought of ghosts and his own mind. With firm focused, he should abide in this meditative state uninterruptedly. He should understand that ghostly apparitions ('dre !tar snang ba) are simply projections of his own mind, that the mind is empty, and that there thus is no separation between percepti ons and the mind (snang sems dbyer med). When the yogi experiences a frightening perception (yul 'jigs pa'i snang ba) and uses this technique, he is able to tum it into a meditative experience, realizing the perception of ghosts as an experience of dhannakaya. Again, the segment quotes a passage attributed to Naropa, which outlines a similar contemplative practice. If the yogi is unable to calm down his fears of ghosts relying on the above method, an alternative meditation is given next, aimed at approaching ghosts as deities ('dre lhar khyer ba). The practiti oner should again imagine himself in the form of a Tantric deity (yi dam) and visualize the deity's seed syllable (sa bon) in the heart cakra. The syllable emits a powerful light, which forces all harmful spirits (gnod byed, *apakara) to assemble in front of him. He should then visualize them all as assuming the form of the deity (yi dam lha) 1236 On the phrase gnad du bsnun pa, see fn. 805."},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"580 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum and think that the light shining from his own heart strikes them, causing them to abolish all their evil and harmful intentions, rendering them completely peaceful. While maintaining a firm conviction of truly being the deity (yi dam lha 'i nga rgyal chen po dang ldan pa), the practitioner then recites the deity's mantra in a very powerful manner (drag tu). Through this meditation, all evil intentions in the ghosts become fully pacified and they are promp­ted to support and aid the meditator in his endeavors. The segment here quotes another pas­sage attributed to Naropa describing such a meditation. The segment finally outlines how the yogf living alone in the wilderness needs to relax his body and mind. He should remain in a state of radiance ('od gsal) even during his sleep. No matter which good or bad thought arises in his mind, the yogf must make sure to let it liberate itself in a state of non-artificiality . The segment ends with a detailed colophon (cited in Tibetan above) stating the circumstances of the teaching: This instruction on vanquishing ideas of ghosts is entitled An Examination of the Four Ghosts. Regarding this instruction, it is told that the master Sgam po pa at one time stayed with his followers in the Dpal gyi stabs lung valley, when a huge unnatural display of gods and ghosts appeared. All his followers huddled together in the back of the sleeping hut, whereupon [Sgam po pa] spoke this teaching. Having then performed a large fire pilja at this place, all the gods and ghosts were subdued.

It gives a short teaching on the nature of the mind in five points (don rnam pa lnga). It first lists these points and then explains them in brief. The five points are as follows: (1) To know all possible perceptions to be the real nature of things (snang srid chos nyid du shes pa), meaning that appearances (snang ba) should not be conceptualized as being real entities (dngos po). (2) To grasp space as mind (nam mkha' sems su bzung ba), meaning that the mind as such (sems nyid) is in any way a sub­stantial entity (dngos po med par sang nge ba). (3) To know Samantabhadra as the father (kun tu bzang po pha ru shes pa), which denotes being without clinging or aversion. ( 4) To know Samantabhadra as the mother (kun tu bzang mo ma ru shes pa), which is to settle the mind in its own mode without observation or concept.

Text Dk.A.Ngi is a compilation of seven smaller works containing explanations on various types of Tantric fasting and rejuvenation practices (bcud Zen, *rasayana). These teachings involve recipes for various substances and drinks aimed at restoring health and longevity , giving special powers, and enhancing meditative experi­ences. It is possible that the practices described in the course of the various segments should be seen as constituting a progressive series, given that the earlier segments explain practices that involve fasting with some intake of food while the latter practices instruct in fasting practices with nearly no intake of solid food and only allowing intake of small amounts of water. Some of the segments contain cross-references to earlier segments, suggesting that at least some of the segments were written as integral parts of the compila­tion. Although the general title of the text in DK.A ascribes these works to Bsod nams rin chen, using the bodhisattva epithet Candraprabha Kumara, the segments contain no internal evidence that suggests them to have been authored by him.

It ends (DK.A.Ngi.1.5a1): bdud rtsi dag la mos pa bsod nams che/.1239 The segment commences by presenting three general levels of rasayana practices, on which Mahamudra yogis rely. The first level is called outer rasayana (phyi'i bcud Zen), denoting the Indian and Tibetan medicinal traditions (rgya bod kyi sman 'gyur tshad). The second level is inner rasayana (nang gi bcud Zen), referring to the Tantric visualized offerings of the so-called five nectars (bdud rtsi lnga). The third level is secret rasayana (gsang ba 'i bcud Zen) con­sisting of the yogi's view, meditation, and conduct (lta sgom spyod gsum). Additionally, there is a rasayana that employs mantric syllables, namely the application of the mantra: mJi a� hu17i. The segment then moves into giving a detailed and quite complex recipe for making pills or tablets (ril bu) described as nectar (bdud rtsi).

The resulting nectar pills (bdud rtsi) may be mixed with medicine (sman) or with other listed substances, in which case the compound is said to cure illnesses related to imbalances in the three humors of bile, phlegm, and wind. It may also cure poisoning, blood related diseases, and infections. When mixed with other substances, it may also be used to cure several specified bodily dis orders, such as insomnia, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Ultima­tely, the compound may bring about inner results of meditative experiences, spontaneous understanding of the teachings, spiritual powers, and even Awakening. The segment explains that this is possible, because wind (rlung, *viiyu) is the root of all meditative experience and these nectar pills can be used to affect the winds. Having discussed these effects, the segment narrates a short story of how Padmasam­bhava (pad ma 'byung gnas) once explained the many benefits derived from the five nectars (bdud rtsi lnga, *paiicilmrta) to the king and the practitioners at Bsam yas monastery. Having outlined the various good results, the segment ends the story by relating various powers and effects with the duration throughout which the yogi sustains himself on nectar. These durations range from six months, ten months, three years, five years, six years, and so forth up to thirteen years. Depending on the duration of the practice, the yogi attains powers starting with the power to cure leprosy, gaining wealth-granting powers, bodily strength, clairvoyance, the ability to make miracles, up to attaining buddhahood.

The explanations for making each of these substances are written in verse with lines of seven syllables each. The last part of the segment is written in mixed verse and prose. As for making pills, the yogi should enter a solitary retreat, stay away from heat, and avoid eating or drinking salty, sour, and putrid things. He must take it easy and eat food made of white barley. The ingredients should be prepared on a clean flat grinding stone. He should then mix nectar of the five meats (sha lnga bdud rtsi rnam pa lnga), the three medicinal fruits, honey and molasses, and amrta. The mixture should be shaped into pill form and be collected in a suitable vessel. The same recipe may be adapted to tum the substance into flour, broth, paste, or balm, as explained in some detail in the segment. These blessed substances are said to give special powers for accomplishing spiritual qualities, removing obstacles, and ordering activities to be done by the cj,akinfs. When the substances are mixed with sulfur and certain mantras are recited over them for particular lengths of time, they tum into particular medicines (sman) for curing leprosy, infections, colds, fevers, epidemics, jaundice, and a number of other diseases. They also hold the power to ward off ghosts and spirits, to make cj,akinfs and gods come to one's aid, and they can be worn in talismans (ga'u) for protection against illnesses.

In order to remove obstacles that may shorten the yogf's life, such as the five poisons and other negative influences that harm the mind, he should go to a solitary place (dgon pa) near a plantain tree (chu shing, *kadali) or some other place that is undisturbed by people. The food to be used for the ritual should be cooked and placed in a suitable vessel. On an appropriate astrological date, the practitioner should perform bali offerings (gtor ma) to the teacher and the deities in the evening. He should then put garlic (sgog pa) in the food and eat a handful of the gruel (chan spar). Next, the segment describes a meditation where the practitioner should visualize himself in the form of a white goddess holding a golden sword and a nectar vase. The goddess is a wisdom rjiikinl (ye shes kyi mkha' 'gro ma, \"<'j iiiinarjiikinf) and the meditation is categorized as being the secret siidhana (gsang sgrub) of the decapited form of Vajraviiriihl (phag mo dbu bead ma, *variihl chinnamwy,rja). When mental poisons arise in the mind, the yogi should visualize that he -in the form of the goddess -cuts off his own head with the sword. By thus severing the inner inner channels (rtsa, *narji), the five mental poisons are cut and become transformed into the five wisdoms. The goddess' entire body becomes filled with splendor and bliss. The goddess then pours nectar from the vase into the decapited neck of her torso, filling up her body with a soothing white sensation. Thereafter follows a yoga practice, where the yogi holds the breath in the abdomen (bar rlung), making the energy winds flow into the central channel. Meditating on himself as the goddess, the yogi recites the goddess' mantra, with her blessing turning his mind into the blazing radiance of the five wisdoms, causing him to attain buddhahood. The yogi should continue this meditation for a week, while fasting and only imbibing unsalted boiled water in the evenings. When hunger arises during the first week of practice, he should rub his body with butter mixed with garlic, myrobalan fruit (a ru ra), and shin kun (unidentified). When inner wind (rlung, *viiya) rises during three weeks of practice, he should drink a stock made from boiled bones and salt, and he should continue to rub his body with butter. These countermeasures ought to suffice if difficulties should arise before proficiency is attained in the practice. The segment then gives a series of practical advice on what the yogi should do in the case of loss of appetite, painful ribs, constipation, and other difficult side effects. The reme­dies variously include eating myrobalan, applying butter on the body, eating a little butter, washing the body and applying oil to the skin, and the like. In this manner, the yogi conti­nues the bskyed rim practice for a month, only eating a handful of gruel (chan spar) every third day. The practice is said to equalize the physical elements ('byung ba ro snyoms pa). Having explained the practice, the segment outlines the signs (rtags) that appear on outer, inner, and secret levels, indicating that the stream of the physical elements has been interrupted ('byung ba rgyun gcod pa). The outer sign that the physical elements (phyi 'byung ba) have been interrupted is that a sensation of purity, lightness, and bliss appears in the body. Also, the senses become vivid and the yogi no longer feels any need for eating.

The segment ends by describing the transmission history of the practice. It narrates that in India a master named *Mahasmasana (dur khrod chen po) performed the practice of the goddess Viiriihl in the cremation ground called the Cool Grove (bsil ba 'i tshaZ, *.fftavana). Having run out of provisions, he had to go to a village to beg for food. That night he recei­ved the instruction presented here in a vision of the white form of the goddess Viiriihl. He then performed this rasiiyana practice (bcud Zen) for three months with only one measure of rice ('bras rdog po gcig), whereafter clairvoyance and the various signs appeared. Mahasmasan a gave the transmission to the *PiikinfNirgrantha (mklza' 'gro ma gcer bu ma), whereafter it was handed down in a lineage consisting of Bram ze mi rigs, Bal bo dza, Skal ldan chen po, Bun po, Rdo rje, and 'me'.

First, a recipe is given for cooking a broth consisting of melted butter (mar gyi shun mar), three hot peppery spices (tsha ba gsum), salt (tshwa), barley flour, and bone, which is to be prepared in a pot that is not made of copper (zangs). When starting the practice, the yogf should first perform water-based bali offerings (chu gtor) in order to accumulate merit and pay homage. He should then rub butter on his body and if he feels hungry in the evening he might eat a little on the first day. Thereafter, he must stop eating staple foods, such as roasted barley flour (rtsam pa). The following morning, he should make a sucking motion with the tongue in order to alleviate hunger while performing a visualization of white and red bodhicitta filling up all the inner channels an d the whole body.

First, a recipe is given for preparing a dried substance made of five medicinal fruits (a ru ra lnga), white sulphur (mu zi dkar po), salt (tshwa), white garlic peel (sgog skya shun pa), molasses, bone, and butter. Mixing a small amount of the substance with cold water and blessing it in the same manner as described above (the segment makes an internal reference here), the yogffasts while performing recitations and visualizations, only drinking the cold water mixture in the morning and in the evening. It is stated that after eleven days of practice, the body becomes light and the mind becomes very clear. The yogf follows the same rules of conduct as described above. After two months of practice, the yogf can entirely eliminate the need for any staple food (rtsam pa), salt (tshwa), milk ('o ma), tea (ja), and beer or wine (chang). Thereupon, the segment describes a few additional remedies to be applied in the case of different difficulties, and it then turns to presenting a Tantric visualization involving the deity and mantric syllables to be performed as a blessing while doing this cold-water-based rasiiyana practice. Part of the inner practice is focused on a white medicinal goddess (sman gyi lha mo), who decapitates herself with a sword and fills up the inner channels with nectar in a partly similar manner as the visualization described in segment DK.A.Ngi.5. A further part of the visualization involves imagining lights shining out and returning, which purify all sentient beings from negative actions and hindrances and removes the yogf's own obstacles, illnes-1245 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.110a2-ll 134, DK.B.Ngi.7.9b6-10bs, DK.D.Ngi.7.IOarl la3, DK.Q.Ngi.7.502ar503ai, DK.R.Ngi.7.16a3-18a3, DK.S.Ngi.7.16a1-l 7b4, DK.T.Ngi.7.lOn-l In, Phyag chen mdzad vol.

According to the general title given to text DK.A.Ci in the 1520 xylograph, the work is a commentary on eight verses dealing with Tantric yogas ascribed to Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros, the teacher of Mi la ras pa. The text's first segment contains a root-text in eight verses explaining the yogas of Naropa. This is followed by five short segments giving instructions on yogas, some of which are mentioned in the root-text. These practices include the yogas of Dream (rmi lam), an instruction on a condensed practice of the yogas of the Five Stages (rim Inga, *paiieakrama), Illusory Body (sgyu lus), Inner Heat (gtum mo), and a series of bodily yoga and breathing exer cises referred to as methods for engendering the resolve for Awakening (bodhieitta).

There are 32 verse-lines in total, revealing that each of the eight verses consists of four lines. Here follows a rough translation in prose of the eight verses in full: 1246 Correlated pas sages: DK. a. Kha.19 5b4-l 96a3, D K.B. Ci .1.1bz-2a5, D K.D. Ci.I .

The great scholar Nampa relied on [his] teacher through­out twelve years. [Here are] the instructions he received [sitting] at [his guru's] feet. [A person] exists throughout three interims: the interim between birth and death, the interim of dream, and the interim of becoming. The practices are twofold: mixing and transference. Mixing is the me-thod for reaching buddhahood by medi­tating. Transference is the method for reaching buddhahood without meditating. In the interim between birth and death, [the practitioner] should meditate on mixing the Generation Stage and the Completion Stage [practices of] channels and winds. When sleeping, [the practitioner] should first mix dream with the meditation on the instruction on radiance. When dreaming, [he] should mix [it] with meditation. Relying on a meditative experience [attained through such training], when [the yogi] dies, ignorance will arise as radiance at the beginning of the interim of beco­ming. Having attained a stable meditative experience of the channels, winds, and dream, [the yogi] may at that time dissolve [himself] into radiance and will thereby attain the dharmakaya. [However,] due to clinging, the second interim [may] arise. By [meditating with] clarity on the impure illusory body, [the yogi] attains the pure illusory body. If this is not attained because of clinging, the third interim [arises], where [he] will [enter one of] the doors to the six courses of existence and be reborn due to desire and aversion. By [relying on] the Generation and Completion [stages of meditation], the doors of desire and aversion can be closed. The teacher, who is like the Buddha, stated that there is no [need] to doubt [whether or] not buddhahood will be attained. Transference [includes] transference through training, transference through a forceful method, and transference by manipulating the body. The teacher said that [transference leads to] buddhahood without having meditated. The instruction [entitled] The Eight Verses made by lord Mar pa is finished. The segment has no colophon. It should be noted that lines and topics from these verses are quoted a number of times in other parts of the bka ' 'bum. According to the general title of text DK.A.Ci, the five subsequent segments of the text are all supposed to provide a general commentary ('grel pa, *vrtti) to these verses. However, it should be noted that the 'commentary' is not a direct commentary on the actual words of the verses as is usually suggested by the genre term 'grel pa (vrtti), but the segments are rather a compilation of yoga instructions related to some but far from all points mentioned in the verses. The verse lines dealing with the three interims (bar do) are not explained in the present text, but these topics have been quoted and explained previously in segment DK.A.Khi.17. Likewise, the practice of Transference ('pho ba) mentioned in the last verses is not commented upon in the subsequent segments. Hence, it would seem that the only direct point mentioned in the verses being commented upon below is the practice of Dream (rmi lam). It may therefore be rather imprecise that the text (DK.A.Ci) in the 1520 xylograph has been given its general title that characterizes it as a 'commentary' on Mar pa's Eight Verses.1248 In the earlier handwritten golden manuscript (DK.a.Kha.195b4-199b6), no such general title is affixed to the text describing it as a commentary. Rather, in that 1248 Regarding the invention and addition of titles to text in the xylograph of 1520, see KRAGH (2013c:377-379 and 384-386)."},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 589 redaction, the segments appear in the same series as in DK.A.Ci, including the 'first' seg­ment containing Mar pa 's Eight Ve rses, and the series are preceded and succeeded by segments that in the 1520 xylograph were compiled separately to create text DK.A.Khi. Hence, there is good reason to believe that the latter segments of DK.A.Ci ought not to be seen as an actual, direct commentary on segment DK.A.Ci.1. Segment DK.A.Ci.2: The segment begins (DK.A.Ci.2.2as): //rmi lam gyi man ngag lags// //b la ma rnams la phyag 'tshal lo/ Ide la chos kyi phyag rgyas bdag byin gyis brlab pa la bzhi/. It ends (DK.A.Ci.2.3a6): Ide ni rmi lam du 'khyer ba ste tshe 'di la bslab pa 'o//.1249 The segment starts by saying that there are four ways for the yo gl to bestow self­blessing (bdag byin gyis brlabs pa, *sviidhi�_thiina) by relying on the reality seal (chos kyi phyag rgya, *dhannamudrii), i.e., the experience of absolute reality through all daily activi­ties. Thereupon, the segment states that the first of these four ways is to use the experience of dream as a spiritual path (rmi lam du 'khyer ba), being the instruction that is given in the current segment. The segment, however, does not clarify what the three remaining ways of self-blessing are in this context, but it would seem that here these might refer to the instruc­tions given in the three subsequent segments dealing with the yogas of the Five Stages (rim lnga), Illusory Body (sgyu lus), and Inner Heat (gtum mo). The segment presents the practice of Dream yoga (rmi lam, *svapna) in four points. The first point is called \"catching the dream\" or \"recognizing the dream\" (rmi lam bzung ba). This point first instructs the yogi in the aspirational mental preparations that are to be carried out throughout the day and the evening before going to sleep. Then it explains how the yogi should visualize a ball of white light between the eyebrows while falling asleep, how he should tum ordinary dreams into lucid dreams in which the dreamer knows he is dreaming, and how he should contemplate the nature of dream after waking up in the morning. The second point is called \"training in the dream\" or \"purifying the dream\" (rmi lam sbyang ba). It consists in techniques for strengthening the sense of the lucid dream being unreal. These techniques involve manipulating a given dream by doing extreme things in the dream that in reality would be impossible, such as leaping into water or fire without getting hurt, jumping into an abyss, or traveling instantly to faraway places, such as the celestial realms, to go sightseeing in India, to press down the sun and moon with one's feet, or the like. The third point is called blessing the dream as illusory and getting rid of apprehension (sgyu mar byin gyis brlab cing/ ya nga ba spang ba). Whenever the slightest apprehension is felt in a dream due to taking the dream as being real, the yogi should here examine such fear and question it, given that its object is entirely unreal. The dreamer may again challenge himself by doing something seemingly scary, such as leaping into fire, in order to check whether any fear remains. 1249 Correlated passages: DK.a.Kha.196a3-l97a3, DK.B.Ci.2.2as-3a6, DK.D.Ci.2.2a2-3�, DK.Q.Ci.2.503b1-504a7, DK.S.Ci.2.2b3-4b1, DK.T.Ci.2.2n-3n."},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"590 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum The fourth point is called meditating on the real nature of the dream (rmi lam gyi de kho na nyid sgom pa).

These Five Stages are here listed as: (1) vajra recitation (rdo rj e'i bzlas pa, *vajrajiipa), being a designation that here would seem to include the generally known terms body isolation (lus dben pa, kiiyaviveka) and speech isolation (ngag dben pa, viigviveka), although the latter terms do not occur in the present segment; (2) mind absorption (sems la dmigs pa, *cittanidhyapti), also known else­where as mind isolation (sems dben pa, cittaviveka); (3) illusory body (sgyu lus, *miiyii­deha); (4) radiance ('od gsal, *p rabhasvara); and (5) union (zung 'jug, *yuganaddha). After a short introductory paragraph stating that the author has written down these instructions in order to avoid forgetting his teacher's explanations, the segment begins by presenting how the practitioner should sit and enter into the meditation on the Generation Stage by visualizing the seed syllable, the deity's palace and seat, the deity in union, inviting the wisdom-aspects, and consecrating the visualized aspects. Having laid out the inner visualization of cakras, lotus flowers, and syllables, the segment then instructs in the practice of vajra recitation (rdo rj e'i bzlas pa, *vajrajiipa). At this stage, the yogf gently controls the breathing while meditating on the three Mantric syllables Olfl iif:t halfl and their respective colors in a fashion synchronized with the breath. Thereupon, the yogffocuses the mind on an increasingly smaller a?z syllable, which here constitutes the practice of mind absorption (sems la dmigs pa, *cittanidhyapti). From this point on, the yogf leads the medi­tation into the practices of Illusory Body (sgyu lus, *miiyadeha), Radiance ('od gsal, >rp ra­bhasvara), and Union (zung 'jug, *yuganaddha), all representing different levels of experi­encing non-duality. Having briefly presented these stages, the segment explains how the meditator should rise again from this meditative abs orption by reapplying the visualization of the deity and the syllables.

The practitioner is instructed to construct a cabin or hut having a window in the eastern direction. In the hut should be hung four mirrors and four swords that make it possible to create light reflections. On the western wall, he should hang a drawing or painting of the deity Vajrasattva (rdo rj e sems dp a} having one face and two hands. As the morning light of the rising sun hits the Vajrasattva picture through the eastern window, the mirrors and swords should be arranged in such a manner that they reflect the image manifold onto the walls of the cabin, resulting in the room being filled with multiple illusory forms of the deity. The teacher instructs the practitioner to meditate on the appearing yet illusory nature of the deity while sitting in the cabin. In the post-meditative phase, the student should keep this experience in mind while regarding all phenomena and daily activities as being entirely illusory. This will produce an inexpressible state of mind in which no difference is found between meditation and post­meditation. All perceptions emerge as hallucinatory, lacking any form of independent nature, giving rise to experiences of eradication (spangs pa) of the tendencies of taking things to be real, attainment (thob pa) of actualizing radiance, and realization (rtogs pa) of the illusory nature of self-awareness. The segment further explains that such realization is threefold. First and foremost, buddhahood is certain to be reached already in the present life. Secondly, the practitioner will attain the meditative abs orption of the space-repository (nam mkha' mdzod kyi ting nge 'dzin, *gaganagafijasamiidhi). Thirdly, by receiving empowerment from buddhas during dreams, the empowerment substances (dbang rdzas, *abhi�ekadravya) will miraculously appear right in the yogf's own hands even in the waking state.

These three techniques were also listed and explained previously in segments DK.A.Tsa.5and DK.A.Khi.10. The first stage is called the Action Practice of Inner Heat (las kyi gtum mo). Using the kumbhaka breathing technique (bum can), the yogi visualizes a fiery a-stroke in the navelcakra. Causing the bodily winds (rlung, *vayu) to flow into the central channel beneath the navel, the inner awareness (nang rig pa) emerges as knowledge (ye shes, *j T'fiina). In the process thereof, the fiery syllable produces heat (drod, *llpnan). The yogi must keep up the practice until the sign (rtags) of heat has clearly appeared. The second stage is called Blazing Inner Heat ('bar ba'i gtum mo). Here, the yogi fo­cuses on that the fire from the a-stroke blazes up within the central channel, reaching the aperture at top of the head (tshangs pa'i bu ga). The practitioner should continue with this stage of the practice until three 'measures' (tshad) have been fulfilled, namely until mastery or skill (las su rung ha, karma(iya) has been achieved in controlling the channels (rtsa, *nacji), the winds (rlung, .*vayu), and the mind (sems, *citta). Interlinear notes here explain that these measures respectively denote that the body feels light and that it after a while is no longer felt at all, that all perceptions are understood to be mind, and that realization emerges as knowledge (ye shes, *jnana). The third stage of the practice is called the Inner Heat of Mahamudra (phyag rgya chen po'i gtum mo). At this point, the yogi no longer applies the mind to any reference point of conceptual cognition (yid la mi byed pa, *amanasikara), focusing neither on the channels nor on the winds, and applying no other artificial technique. Instead, he rests directly in reality (de nyid, *tattva). The meditative experience of the practice needs to be carried into all aspects of daily life and conduct, fully ascertaining the nature of the mind even while dreaming at night. The segment ends by promising that when these methods are used, their various results are bound to be produced, including the experience of heat, the cessation of conceptuality, the emergence of knowledge, and the attainment of buddhahood.

The verses are composed in a highly metaphorical style, e.g., mentioning the four continents being pulled together, the ocean crashing onto rocks, hoisting a great banner, reversing the flow of a water spring, leaping in the manner of a tigress, etc. The actual meaning of the verses would remain entirely unclear if it were not for a series of interlinear notes (mchan bu) that identify each metaphor with a particular yoga body movement. From these notes it thus becomes clear that the first series of longer verse-lines gives instruction in the well-known yoga exercise for expelling stale winds followed by the kumbhaka breathing technique, which the segment refers to as the instruction for holding [the wind] (bzung ba'i man ngag). As for the exercise, the yogf sits straight in meditation posture, points the tip of the tongue up into the palate, and rolls the eyeballs up backwards. Focusing on the mantric syllable hit7J1, he then causes the wind (rlung) to rise up from below reaching the heart cakra. He then thrusts the body forward into a shaking convulsion while expelling a series of sounds, hag hag. Extending the arms, he then inhales and pushes the breath into the abdomen, holding it there from above and below. The second series of shorter verse-lines explains what it calls the instruction for block­ing the channels (rtsa mig dgag pa'i man ngag). Here a series of bodily yoga motions are listed, including three repetitions of what is called rotating (gcu) the water pitcher (cliu snod), three repetitions of expelling like a dog (i.e., the above-mentioned forward shaking motion with the sound hag hag), and three repetitions of the lion pose involving a thrusting movement. Finally, the verse-lines explain a yoga technique for making the wind pervade the body (lus la khyab par bya ba). Here the yogf must do three repetitions of rotating (gcus) the larynx by rolling the head anti-clockwise starting in the downward direction of the left shoulder. After the three repetitions, he should stop the movement and rest, which will cause the wind to spread throughout the body. The segment ends with a short colophon (cited in Tibetan above) saying: \"[These were] the profound instructions of the Ela ma rin po che Dags po lha rje.\" The colophon is followed by the standard short printer's colophon pertaining to the 1520 xylograph. The printer's colophon is, moreover, followed by a brief note giving the name of the scribe (likewise cited in Tibetan above): \"The letters [of the text describing] what is to be known were made by the fingertips of Dkon mchog skyabs [sitting] on the high throne of E.

As proposed in KRAGH (2013c: 376 n. 45), the throne ofE (e'i khri) might refer to the abbatial throne of Bo dong e monastery (Bo dong e dgon pa, TBRC G244) located in Bkra shis sgang in Lha rtse county. 6. 36 DK.A.Chi: The Oral Instruction of Master Sgam po pa entitled the Jewel Rosary fo r the Highest Path (Rje sgam po pa'i zhal gdams/ lam me hog rin po che 'i phreng ba ces bya ba bzhugs pa lags so) 12 folios, l segment, l colophon. The final text in the part of Dags po'i bka ' 'b um contai­ning what has here been designated \"miscellaneous sayings\" (gsung thor bu) is one of Bsod nams rin chen's more well-known works in the West, namely The Jewel Rosary fo r the Highest Path (Lam mchog rin po che'i phreng ba). It was in the form of this this little text that Bsod nams rin chen for the first time ever came to be introduced to the Western audience, namely by Walter Y. EVANS-WENTZ's (1878-1965) English translation of the text made in collaboration with the Sikkimese Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup (1868-1922) under the title \"The Supreme Path of Discipleship: The Precepts of the Gurus,\" published in 1935 within Ev ANS-WENTZ's book on Tibetan mysticism entitled Tibetan Yogas and Secret Doc­trines. The text has in recent years been published in several translations in a number of Western languages, including, inter alia, those by COLSMAN (1986, German), KUNSANG, SCHMIDT & CHOKYI NYIMA (1995 English), KARTHAR (1996 English), and DOCTOR (1998 Danish). The text is a general guide to Buddhist practice consisting of 28 groups of things to be practiced or avoided. It somewhat sternly points out all the many faults and pitfalls of misunderstanding, moral inconsequence, and spiritual hypocrisy that the practitioner might find himself to be afflicted with if he takes a hard look at himself and, as such, the present work bears a certain resemblance to another Rosary ( 'phreng ba) text in the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum, namely the small tract entitled The Ambrosia Rosary of Good Counsel (Gros 'debs bdud rtsi 'phreng ba, DK.A.Gi. l ). Tough these segments share a common focus on bringing to mind possible faults in the practitioner, their writing styles differ. Segment DK.A.Gi. l is characterized by prose written in a heavy colloquial style of language, where­as the present segment features an organizational principle of using lists. In brief, the present text describes the mindset of an authentic yogi by presenting how the practitioner must relate towards a variety of circumstances, outer as well as inner, with attitudes of renunciation and spiritual determination. The basic sentiment is that a yo gl must renounce mundane life in every form and live for practicing meditation in the wilderness with diligence, strength, determination, and firm devotion.

The homage charac terizes these teachers as being adorned with the pure conduct of the precious Bka brgyud lineage (bka' brgyud rin po che). The author then states that he for long time has reflected upon (brnag par byas) the stream of sayings (gsung gi rgyun) that has come from these Bka' brgyud transmissions (bka ' brgyud de dag). Based on his direct experience and the [sayings] from the transmission lineage (dngos dang brgyud), he has put these instructions (gdam ngag, *avaviida) into writing in the form of this text entitled the Jewel Rosary fo r the Highest Path. The text is structured in 28 units, each of which contains a list of ten or more points to be practiced or avoided. These points are as follows: (l) Ten points of throwing away [what is valuable] ( 'phangs pa 'i chos bcu, *dafa k,Ji pta­dharmii(i), which should be kept in mind (rjes su dran par bya ba, *anusmrtavya) by the person who has the proper disposition for practicing the Dharma (rten gyi gang zag) and who wishes to attain liberation and buddhahood. This passage describes how the practi­tioner risks depreciating and throwing away ( 'phangs, *k,Jipta) ten special things by not practicing the Dharma conscientiously and seriously. These special things include the pure and free rebirth as a human being (mi lus) which is difficult to obtain (myed par dka ' ba) and difficult to keep (ldan par dka ' ba); the lifespan as a human (mi tshe) which is short and fleeting; the nature of the mind (rang sems) which is dharmakiiya (chos sku); the genuine teacher (bla ma dam pa); the religious vows and Tantric precepts (sdom pa dam tshig); realization (rtogs pa) gained thanks to the bla ma's care and kindness; the profound instructions (man ngag zab mo) of the accomplished siddhas (grub thob ); sentient beings (sems can) who were one's own parents (pha ma rnams) in one's former lives; and the possibilities offered throughout the three main phases of a human lifespan.

The inner mind as such (nang gi sems nyid, *adhyiitmacittata) should be understood as being empty (stong pa, *silnya), since it is without a Self (bdag med). Thoughts (rnam rtog, *vikalpa), appearing in between these two (bar gyi), should be understood as being adventitious, since they arise due to conditions. The body composed of the four material elements ('byung bzhi'i lus) and the speech (ngag) should be understood as being impermanent (mi rtag pa), since they are conditioned ('dus byas). All the joys and sufferings of sentient beings should be understood as being the incontrovertible results of actions (las 'bras, *karmaphala), since they have arisen from actions. Suffering (sdug bsngal) should be understood as being a spiritual teacher (dge ba'i bshes gnyen), since it is the cause for renunciation (nges par 'byung gi rgyu, *ni[1sara�iahetu). Happiness (bde skyid) should be understood as being a demon of attachment, since it is the root for sm71siira. Social gatherings ('du 'dzi, *sm71sarga) should be understood as being obstacles for [gathering] beneficence (bsod nams bar chad), since they are adverse circumstances for [practicing] the Dharma. Obstacles (bar chad, *antar­iiya) should be understood as being the guru taking the form of enemies and hindrances (dgra bgegs bla ma), since they are exhortations for spiritual practice (dge sbyor).

No matter how much effort one devotes to gaining land, subjects, and dominions in this life, all places an d associates amount to nothing at the time of death. If one has entered the Dharma with faith, it is senseless to do actions that go against the Dharma, given that such actions only become the cause for rebirth in the lower realms.

In like manner, the segment here lays circumstances and behaviors, such as performing negative actions with-out regard for the Dharma, deceiving others, being a leader of less intelligent men, failing to strive for the benefit of others with pure motivation, striving for one's own benefit with regard to the eight mundane concerns, engaging in huge undertakings that do not lead to accomplishment, to depreciate genuine teachers and the Buddha's teachings out of pride, hanging out in villages having abandoned one's practice, failing to maintain insight into the real nature due to becoming distracted by ideas of social gatherings, and using the belong-ings of temples and monasteries without due care. (19) Reversely, the text lays out ten things of great benefit to oneself brought about thanks to oneself (rang drin rang la che ba'i chos bcu). This list includes practicing the Dharma when having eradicated desire and anger; relying on a genuine teacher when having left behind family life, friends, and relatives; studying the teachings when having given up activities of social gatherings; staying in solitary retreat when having left behind neighbors and acquaintances; being firm in non-attachment when having cut the ties of sensual pleasures; being satisfied with the bare necessities when being without hopes and desires for nice things; consistently adhering to the precepts when having gained independ­ence without delegating things to others; accomplishing the lasting happiness of Awake­ning when being without concern for any temporary happiness of this life; putting empti­ness into practice when having abandoned all tendencies of taking things as being real; and"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"602 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um striving for the union (zung 'jug) of the gatherings of spiritual requisites without leaving the body, speech an d mind in their usual modes. (20) Next, the segment identifies ten right things (yang dag pa 'i chos bcu) withreference to practitioners of weak, middling, and keen aptitudes (dbang po, *indriya), including for each type their proper understanding of the right view (yang dag pa'i lta ba,*samyagdnti), the right meditation (yang dag pa'i sgom pa, *samyagbhiivana), and theright conduct (yang dag pa'i spyod pa, *samyagiiciira). The practitioner of weak aptitude(dbang po tha ma) should have conviction in the workings of action and result (right view), rest the mind one-pointedly on the focus (right meditation), and carefully watch overactions and their results as if protecting his own eyeballs (right conduct). The practitioner of middling aptitude (dbang po 'bring) should realize the four unions (zung 'jug bzhi) of perception-emptiness (snang stong), presence-emptiness (gsal stong), bliss-emptiness (bde stong), and knowledge-emptiness (rig stong) (right view), rest in a meditative concentration focused on these four unions (right meditation), and act while considering all phenomena to be mere dreams and magical illusions (right conduct). The practitioner of keen aptitude (dbang po rab) should realize the inseparability of the object of viewing, the act of viewing, and realization (right view), rest in an non-referential state wherein what is meditated upon, the act of meditating, and the meditative experience are inseparable (right meditation), and act in a manner that is without acting towards anything or anybody (right conduct). Finally, the cessation and pacification of all self-clinging and afflictive emotions are the signs of proficiency (drod rtags) in the practice for all three kinds of practitioners. (21) Ten serious confusions in practitioners (chos pa 'i 'khrul pa bcu): not to rely on a teacher who practices properly in accordance with the Dharma but instead to follow a charlatan who merely is skilled in talking; not to seek the instructions of the Hearing Lineage (snyan brgyud) of accomplished practitioners (grub thob) but instead to strive for pointless teachings in logic (rigs pa'i chos);1256 always to be engaged in extensive prepara­tions for planning to stay somewhere without ever getting around to spending one's life on letting go off sensory perceptions; not to contemplate the meaning of the Dharma in soli­tude but instead to explain the Dhanna to crowds of people; not to be generous in giving away any leftovers of enjoyable things, but instead to accumulate wealth and things with avarice and cunning; not to guard the vows and Tantric precepts properly, but instead to let completely go of body, speech, and mind without a care; not to familiarize oneself with the meaning of realizing the true nature, but instead to exhaust one's life on undertaking all sorts of projects of little meaning; not to tame the bad habit of delusion in one's own being 1256 The 1520 xylograph (DK.A.Chi.1.8b6) here reads rig pa'i chos (\"teachings of knowledge\"), which has been emended to rigs pa 'i chos (\"teachings in logic\"). Alternatively, the xylograph's spelling rig pa'i could be interpreted as intending rig pa'i gnas (vidyiisthiina), \"fields of learning\" or \"sciences,\" thereby constituting an admonishion not to get lost in studies of the five outer sciences (vidyii, rig pa) of medicine (cikitsiividyii, gso ba'i rig pa), logic (hetuvidyii, tan tshig gi rig pa), language (§abdavidyii, sgra'i rig pa), and fine arts and crafts (Silpakarmasthiinavidyii, bza'i las kyi gnas kyi rig pa)."},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 603 but instead to try to tame the wild, infantile minds of others; not to protect and maintain the meditative experiences that have arisen in one's mind, but instead protect and maintain one's involvement in this life; and not to apply diligent effort given all the good conditions and connections one has been given in this life, but instead not to care and be indolent. (22) Thereafter, the segment presents ten necessary things (dgos pa'i chos bcu) related to an attitude that is needed at the outset (dang po), an action that is taken in the middle (bar du), and a different attitude that is adopted in the end (tha mar). Each point is also explained with an analogy . For example, what is needed at the outset is a conviction of fearing rebirth and death, which is compared to how a wild deer strives to flee from trap. Similarly, the text here presents analogies for having relentless diligence in the middle and delight in the end; at the outset to know that time is short, to meditate without distracti on in the middle, and to know that there is nothing to be done in the end; to generate certainty about the Dharma at the outset, to develop certainty about one's own mind in the middle, and to achieve certainty about non-duality at the end. Finally, the last needed thing is to aim for ultimate reality (de kho na nyid, *tattva). (23) Reversely, the segment lays out ten things that are not needed (mi dgos pa'i chos bcu), namely study and contemplation (thos bsam) once realization of the mind being empty has arisen; purification of negative actions once one has understood that awareness (rig pa, *vidya) is untainted (dri med, *vimala); still gathering the spiritual prerequisites once one has reached the natural path (rnal ma'i lam); cultivation of the method path once one can maintain the immanent state (gnyug ma'i ngang); meditation on non-conceptuality once one has understood thoughts to be reality as such (chos nyid, *dharmata); reliance on remedies once afflictive emotions has been seen as rootless; efforts to stop or develop any­thing once perceptions and sounds have been seen as illusory; transference ('pho ba) once one has realized one's own mind to be birthless (skye med) ; and accomplishing one's own benefit once one has become able to turn anything into benefit for others. (24) Ten really outstanding things (khyad par 'phags pa'i chos bcu) include: a free and endowed human rebirth compared with all other forms of rebirth; a person who practices the Dharma compared with various bad people who have no Dharma; the vehicle of the heart meaning (snying po'i don gyi theg pa) from among all other sorts of spiritual paths; even a single moment of insight derived from meditation in comparison to all insight derived from learning and reflecti on; even a single moment of unconditioned positive action in comparison to all the conditioned positive actions; even a moment of non­referential meditation (dmigs med kyi ting nge 'dzin) in comparison to all the meditations involving a point of reference (dmigs byas); even a moment of unfettered bliss in compari­son to all the forms of happiness leading to bondage; even a moment of realization in comparison to all the happinesses derived from meditative experience; even a moment of conduct free of artifice in comparison to all forms of artificially planned behaviors; and to be without conceptualization and clinging to anything in comparison to all actions of giving away and offering material wealth and riches."},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"604 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum (25) Ten qualities that remain excellent no matter what is done (ji !tar byas kyang legs pa'i chos bcu): The person whose mind has turned to the Dharma is excellent, regardless of whether or not he manages to do further actions. The person whose conceptual imputations and denials have been resolved is excellent, regardless of whether or not he manages to meditate. The person who has cut the ties of sensual pleasures is excellent, regardless of whether or not he manages to become fully free from attachment. The person who directly realizes reality is excellent, regardless of whether he dwells in an empty cave or holds a high position involving many possessions. The person who understands perceptions to be illusory is excellent, regardless of whether he lives alone in the wilderness or wanders about in the country aimlessly. The person who achieves mastery over the mind is excellent, regardless of whether he abandons sensory pleasures or keeps supporting himself on them. The person who possesses the resolve for Awakening is excellent, regardless of whether he practices in solitude or serves the benefit of others in a crowd. The person with unflagging trust and devotion is excellent, regardless of whether or not he stays together with the bla ma. The person who has studied a lot and understood the meaning is excellent, regardless of whether he encounters accomplishments or obstacles. The person who attains the highest realization is excellent, regardless of whether or not he possesses signs of ordinary accomplishment (thun mong gi grub rtags). (26) Thereupon, the segment give an extensive list of ten good qualities of the true Dharma (dam pa'i chos kyi yon tan bcu). First of all, these qualities cover the teachings (chos, *dharma) that appear in the world ('jig rten du 'byung ba), including the teachings on such topics as the ten beneficial actions (dge ba bcu), the six perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa drug po), emptiness, the factors of Awakening (byang chub kyi phyogs kyi chos), the four truths of the noble ones ('phags pa'i bden pa bzhi), the four levels of meditative absorption (bsam gtan bzhi), the four formless absorptions (gzugs med pa'i snyoms par 'jug pa bzhi), and the various Mantra methods for maturing and liberating (sngags kyi smin grol). The segment also lists many other manifestations in the world ('jig rten na 'byung ba) as being qualities of the Dharma (dam pa'i chos kyi yon tan). These include the four classes or castes (rigs bzhi, *caturvan;a), mentioning specifically the high castes (rigs che zhing mtho ba) of k�atriyas (rgyal rigs), briihma!1S (bram ze'i rigs), householders (khyim bdag gi rigs) along with various types of celestial beings belonging to the realm of desire ('dod khams), the form realm (gzugs khams), and the formless realm (gzugs med pa). Further, it mentions the different types of accomplished practitioners, namely stream-enterers, once­returners, non-returners, arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and omniscient buddhas. Next is the fact that Awakened beings compassionately manifest the two form-kiiyas (gzugs sku gnyis) in order to perform benefit for sentient beings for as long as beings remain trapped in sa17isiira, as well as how Awakened bodhisattvas manifest things that are needed by sentient beings by means their wishing prayers (smon lam). The segment here also list the shortlasting periods of happiness that may appear in the lower realms and in unfree places (mi khom pa 'i gnas) as a result of positive actions. Other mentioned facets include how negative persons (skyes bu ngan pa) may become positive (skyes bu dam pa) by relying on the Dharma; how"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um 605 even those who have committed very negative actions eventually can attain good rebirths and liberation by relying on the Dharma; how anyone with mere faith, trust and joy in the Dharma become worthy of others' rejoicing and respect; and how provisions naturally appear for practitioners even after they have left behind all possessions, abandoned the lives of being householders, gone forth, and live hidden away in solitary retreat in the wilderness (ri khrod dgon pa). (27) Ten things that are mere labels (ming tsam gyi chos bcu): The basis (gzhi, *iidhiira) is a mere label (ming tsam, *niimamiitra), since the way it is (gnas lugs) cannot be shown (bstan du med pa). The path (lam, *miirga) is a mere label, since there is neither a goer nor an act of going on the path. Realization (rtogs pa, *avabodha) is a mere label, since there is neither an act of seeing nor a seer in the way things are. Meditative experience (nyams myong, *anubhiiva) is a mere label, since there is neither meditation nor a meditator in the immanent state. Conduct (spyod pa, *iiciira) is a mere label, since there is neither some­thing to be done nor a doer in the fundamental nature. The Tantric bond (dam tshig, *samaya) is a mere label, since there in reality is neither something to be observed nor an observer. The gathering of the two spiritual requisites (tshogs gnyis, *dvismJ1bhiira or *dvayasm!ibhiira) is a mere label, since there in fact is nothing to gather and no gatherer. The two hindrances (sgrib pa, *iivara�ia) are mere labels, since there actually is nothing to purify and no purifier. Sa111siira ('khor ba) is a mere label, since there in reality is neither something to be eliminated nor an eliminator. The result ('bras bu, >rp hala) is a mere label, since there really is nothing to achieve nor any achiever . (28) Finally, the segment presents ten things that involve spontaneous accomplishment in highest joy (bde ba chen por lhun gyis grub pa 'i chos bcu). These take the form of ten reasons as to why there is spontanous accompli shment in highest joy (bde ba chen por limn gyis grub). The reasons given are: the fact that the mind of every sentient being abides in dharmakiiya; the fact that there are no conceptual characteristics (mtshan ma 'i sp ros pa med pa) within the basis, the sphere of phenomena as such (gzhi chos nyid kyi dbyings); the fact that there are no conceptions of partiality (phyogs ris kyi sp ros pa med pa) within realiza­tion (rtogspa), which is free of extremes and beyond the intellect; the fact that there are no conceptions of a focus (dmigs pa 'i sp ros pa med pa) within the meditative experience (nyams myong) that is without conceptual cognition (yid la bya ba med pa); the fact that there are no conceptions of cultivating and abandoning (blang dor gyi sp ros pa med pa) in the conduct that involves nothing to do and no effort (bya bral rtsol med kyi spyod pa); the fact that there are no conceptions of subject and object in dharmakiiya, which is the inseparability of Awakened space and knowledge (dbyings dang ye shes dbyer med pa); the fact that there are no conceptions of birth, death, or transference (skye shi 'pho 'gyur gyi sp ros pa med pa) involved in the enjoyment bodies (longs sku, *sm?1bhogakiiya) that emerge from self-arisen compassion; the fact that there are no conceptions of conditioned dualistic perceptions involved in the emanation bodies (sprul sku, *nirmii�akiiya) that emerge from self-evolving compassion; the fact that there are no conceptions of an intrinsic"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"606 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum Self (bdag lta) in the Buddha's teachings; and the fact that there is no fragmentation or partiality in the measureless Awakened activities of compassion.

It is notable that the colophon names Bsod nams rin chen by his regular monastic name instead of employing an honorific epithet such as Dags po Iha rje, Sgam po pa, or Zla 'od gzhon nu. In fact, this is a feature that only is shared with the colophon of text DK.A.E, the Dags po thar rgyan. All other colophons and passages in the corpus that mention Bsod nams rin chen invariably refer to him by an honorific epithet, which may be less likely for a Tibetan monk to use with reference to himself. Hence, there is a higher probability that the colophon of the present text may reflect the actual hand and authorship of Bsod nams rin chen.1260 Nevertheless, it should be remarked that the writing style of the text differs significantly from the styles attested in the other works of the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um, which stylistically sets it apart. Moreover, the treatise's opening passage mentions several times the sectarian name Bka' brgyud (also in plural form), which is not a term that appears frequently elsewhere in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum. These features might betray that the work is of later provenance, written by the hand of a Bka' brgyud practitioner of a subsequent generation, who could have ascribed the overall message of the work to Bsod nams rin chen in that the text was seen as representative of the intended thought of Bsod nams rin chen's yogic transmission and style of practice. A clear conclusion on this point, however, cannot be reached at the present stage of textual scholarship on the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum. 1259 The reading rnying bsgom should be emended to rnyi bsgom or rnyi ba bsgom.

Dags po 'i bka' 'bum: Eulogies (Bstod pa) Appended at the end of the miscellaneous works and before the corpus' two larger texts on the Stages of the Path (lam rim), the extant paper print of the 1520 xylograph contains two eulogies (bstod pa) of Sgam po pa and his two lineage-holder nephews. Neither eulogy is marked by an alphabetical text-label, but the texts have here for the sake of reference been labeled DK.A.* Ji and DK.A. *Nyi. 1261 It is possible that the two eulogies were added to the xylograph at a slightly later date, possibly in the latter half of the sixteenth century. This may be indicated by their slightly differing page layout and the fact that these are the only two texts in the corpus lacking an alphabetical text label. 1262 According to its colophon, the first eulogy composed by Phag mo gm pa (DK.A.*Ji) was printed in 1519, i.e., in the year leading up to the publication of the 1520 xylograph. 1263 Yet, it remains unclear exactly when it was added to the Dags po' bka ' 'bum xylograph. It might have been added in 1520 when the carved blocks of the corpus were ready to be printed or it could have been added at a later date, perhaps in the 1560s or '70s when Sgam po Bkra shis mam rgyal, who according to the colophon sponsored the printing of the eulogy in 1519 when he was seven years old, was serving as the l Th abbot of the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage. However this may be, it remains a fact that this particular eulogy was not included in the Mang yul gung thang xylograph (xylograph DK.B) produced in 1572 having the 1520 xylograph (DK.A) as its prototype (Vorlage). The second eulogy (DK.A.*Nyi) composed by Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal (1513-1587) is undated. It has a layout and printing style similar to the Shes bya ma eulogy (DK.A.*Ji) and may consequently have been printed at the same place and time, i.e., in 1519. However, the colophon of the text gives the author's name by using his well-known nom de plume \"Sgam po pa manga la'i ming can,\" meaning \"the Sgam po pa having the name Mangala\", where the Sanskrit word maligala corresponds to Tibetan bkra shis, thereby referring to the author's monastic name Bkra shis rnam rgyal chos kyi dpal bzang. If the eulogy were composed in 1519 or 1520 when the author was merely seven or eight years old, it is not certain that he had already received his monastic name and it is conse­quently not clear that he would already then be making use of this particular nom de plume. The nom de plume is a signature that otherwise only is known in the author's relative late works, e.g., in the colophon of his Mahiimudra work Phyag rgya chen po'i khrid yig chen 1261 It should be noted that text DK.A. *Nyi is reprinted in the later xylograph DK.B, where it has received the alphabetical text-label Of!1 (DK.B.Om). Moreover, DK.B adds two other eulogies to the series (DK.B.Ah and DK.B.Huryi) but omits the Sgam po pa eulogy by Phag mo gru pa (DK.A.*Ji). These two are a short praise of the masters of the Bka' brgyud transmission lineage within the Karma Ka111 tshang tradition, composed by the seventh Karma pa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454-1 506), and a praise of the Dags lha sgam po hermitage entitled Ri bo sh an ti 'i gnas bstod. 1262 For the argument concerning the possible later inclusion of these texts, see the discussion of the printing of Phag mo gru pa's eulogy Shes bya ma in fn. 313. 1263 For a discussion thereof, see fn. 313."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 609 mo gnyug ma'i de nyid gsal ba (TBRC W23179, pp. 116-117). Thus, the colophon's formulation seems to suggest a later composition date than 1519 or 1520. In any case, like the Shes bya ma eulogy, the second eulogy might have been added to the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum xylograph in 1520 if it was written at such an early date, or at some later date. It is at least notable that -unlike the Shes bya ma eulogy - the present eulogy was included in the Mang yul gung thang xylograph of 1572 (DK.B) and consequently must have been included in DK.A by that year. 7. 37 DK.A.* Ji: What Should be Known (Shes bya ma bzhugs) 3 folios, 1 segment, 1 colophon.

Dags po'i bka ' 'bum: Stages of the Path (Lam rim) The final section of the Manifold Sayings of Dags po (Dags po'i bka ' 'b um) includes two larger works written in literary style rather than in the style of oral sayings or instructions. These two works may be classified as belonging to the genres called \"Stages of the Path\" (lam rim, *margakrama) or \"Stages of the Teachings\" (bstan rim, *sasanakrama).1270 The general purpose of such genre works is to provide a universal survey of the steps of the bodhisattva path as it has been taught in the Common Mahayana approach. In the Indian Buddhist tradition, some of the most famous works giving such surveys include the Yoga­carabhilmi, Maitreya-Asailga's Mal11iyanasm!1graha and Mahayanasiitrala1?1kara, the Abhisamayalm71kara, and Buddhaghosa's Theravada manual Visuddhimagga. These Indian texts are all works of the fourth and fifth centuries CE. A number of later Indian treatises outlining the path have also exerted particular influence on the ensuing Tibetan tradition, such as Kamalaslla's Bhiivanakrama and Atifa's Bodhipathapradlpa. It is though notable that none of these works are explicitly referred to in their titles by the later Tibetan labels lam rim or bstan rim, and it is therefore evident that the concept of an independent lam rim or bstan rim genre is a distinct Tibetan tradition. Early Tibetan exemplars of these genres include writings by Gro lung pa Blo gros 'byung gnas (l l 1h-121h centuries), Bsod nams rin chen (1079-1153), Phag mo gru pa (11 10-1170), and Sa skya Pary<fi ta (l I 82-1251).1271 The most famous Tibetan lam rim treatise of later times is undoubtedly Rje Tsong kha pa Blo bzang grags pa's (1357-1419) Lam rim chen mo. The Dags po'i bka ' 'b um ends with two treatises that may be regarded as lam rim or bstan rim texts. The first text is the most well-known Mahayana treatise ascribed to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, namely the work that in Tibetan has come to be known by the shorthand title Dags po thar rgyan and which in English has become known as The Jewel Ornament of Liberation. Overall, this is the largest text in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum corpus, consisting of 131 double-sided folios in the Dags lha sgam po xylograph of 1520. The treatise provides a full overview of the Buddhist Mahayana path, primarily based on the teaching style of the Tibetan Bka' gdams pa tradition. The text makes only very few references to the other aspects of Bsod nams rin chen's broader teaching and instruction tradition, such as his Mahamudra meditation system and the Tantric yogas stemming from Naropa. There is consequently a rather considerable difference in emphasis, style and con­tents between the Dags po thar rgyan and the other works in the corpus. The second text in the final part of the corpus is a smaller treatise entitled Scriptural Sunshine (Bstan bcos lung gi nyi 'od, 27 folios). This work is less organized in its structure in comparison to the Dags po thar rgyan and lays its main emphasis on providing quota­tions from the Indian Buddhist scriptures on a series of doctrinal points. It seems that the text's main purpose is to function as a handy repository of quotations of key scriptural 1270 On the distinction between these genres, see JACKSON (1996:229-230), who classifies the present works as belonging to the genre of Stages of the Teachings. 1271 For details, see the article by JACKSON (1996)."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 613 passages. It might be expected that the scriptural passages cited in this treatise are identical to the many textual passages cited in the Dags po thar rgyan and other parts of the corpus, but surprisingly this is only the case with regard to a small number of quotations. Conse­quently, it is not possible to regard the Scriptural Sunshine treatise as constituting the key textual reference 'library' of the corpus. This would otherwise have been a distinct possibility, when it is kept in mind that a physical library of manuscripts and books did not exist at the Dags Iha sgam po hermitage during the life time of Bsod nams rin chen.1272 Given the two texts' character of being treatises composed in a highly literary style of Classical Tibetan language, using ample scriptural quotation, and dealing with topics that are limited to doctrines of the Common Mahayana, these texts stand ap art from nearly all the other works in the corpus. The corpus' only other writing that generally shares these features is the Teaching to the Gathering text (tshogs chos) entitled Legs mdzes's Teaching to the Gathering Given by the Protector Candraprabha Kumara (Mgon po zla 'ad gzhon nus mdzad pa'i tshogs chos legs mdzes ma, DK.A.Ca). Similar to the two present works, text DK.A.Ca uses a high volume of scriptural quotations and is focused primarily on doctrinal topics belonging to the Common Mahayana teachings, although it includes more material belonging to the Mahamudra and Tantric teachings than is the case with texts DK.A.E and DK.A.Va�.1273 The writing style of the Tshogs chos text is though more vernacular and less literary than the present works. Yet, there does generally seem to be some textual linkage between these three works, which remains a point demanding further textual investigation. 8. 39 DK.A.E: Exposition of the Stages of the Mahayana Path of the Two Streams of Bka' gdams pa and Mahamudra entitled the Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Libera-tion (Dam chos yid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po che 'i rgyan zhes bya ba bka' phyag chu bo gnyis kyi theg pa chen po 'i lam rim gyi bshad pa bzhugso) 131 folios, 22 segments, 1 colophon. The first lam rim text on the Stages of the Path in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum is the work that generally has come to be considered Bsod nams rin chen's opus magnum, namely The Jewel Ornament of Liberation. This is the English title under which the book has become known to Western readers in the form of the English title of Herbert V. GUENTHER's English translation from 1959. In Tibetan, the shorthand title for the work is Dags po thar rgyan. The full title of the text, translated and cited above, is though considerably longer. As made explicit in the longer title, the treatise provides a general exposition (bshad pa) of the stages of the Mahayana path (theg pa chen po'i lam 1272 Regarding the date of creating the earliest manuscript library at the hermitage in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, see the discussion in KRAGH (2013c:389-390). 1273 For discussion of the scriptural quotation patterns in corpus, see the section of \"Scriptural Effects\" in KRAGH (2013b:l 377-1379, particularly fn. 39)."},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"614 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum rim).1274 The doctrines presented in the work mainly belong to the teachings of the Bka' gdams pa tradition, but a few references are also given to Bsod nams rin chen's Mahiimudrii teachings, particularly in the book's chapter on the perfection of insight. The title of the work refers to the confluence of these two traditions as \"the two streams of Bka' gdams pa and Mahiimudrii\" (bka ' phyag chu bo gnyis). Following Herbert V. GUENTHER's English translation in 1959, 1275 the text has since been translated many times into Western languages. These include the translations by LABINGER (1980, excerpt only), GUENTHER (1989, German), HOLMES & HOLMES (1995, English), LHUNDRUB (1996, German), GYALTSEN & CHODRON (1998, English), RINCZEN (1998, Polish, excerpt only), BRUYAT & the Padmakara Translation Committee (1999, French), and SCOTT (2000, Dani sh). Regarding the authorship of the work, the text's colophon, found at the end of the work, states explicitly that it was composed or compiled (bkod pa, *racita) by the doctor Bsod nams rin chen (lha rj e bsod nams rin chen) in response to a request by the monk Dar ma skyabs (bande dar ma skyabs), and that the scribe (yi ge pa) wrote down the words of the text was the same Dar ma skyabs: Hereby ends the explanation of the stages of the Mahayana path entitled Th e Wish­fu lfilling Gem of the True Te aching Adorning the Precious Liberation, which was put together by the doctor Bsod nams rin chen in response to a request by the monk Dar ma skyabs. The writing of the letters was made by the same Dar ma skyabs.1276 Similar to text DK.A.Chi, the present work thus refers to Sgam po pa with Bsod nams rin chen's monastic name rather than by using any honorific epithet. This may suggest a higher likelihood of the colophon having been composed, at least in part, by Bsod nams rin chen's own hand. There are, however, several problems in asserting the work to have been composed by Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (1079-1153). Although the later Tibetan tradition at least since the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries has regarded Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen to be the author, the distinct possibility of a different later author -perhaps bearing the same monastic name -needs to be kept firmly in mind. Three such problems surrounding the traditionally asserted authorships have previously been raised (KRAGH, 2013c:388-391). The first problem is that the highly polished literary 1274 In the older handwritten manuscript, the title of the text is at one attestation given in slightly variant form in the internal title reference at the end of chapter one (DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan.2b2): dam chos yid bzhin nor bu mdo sde thar pa rin po che'i rgyan, meaning \"The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Sutras [of] Precious Liberation.\" This variant title is, however, not seen at the end of other chapters of the text, where the manuscript cites the title in the same form as it occurs in DK.A.E. 1275 For a scholarly review of the translation, see SEYFORT RUEGG (1962). 1276 DK.A.E.22.13 la3_4: dam chos yid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po che rgyan zhes bya ba/ th eg pa chen po'i lam gyi rim pa bshad pa 'di ni bande dar ma skyabs kyis bskul ba'i ngor/ Iha rj e bsod nams rin chen gyi bkod pa rdzags sol/ yi ge pa yang da r ma skyabs kyi bgyis pa'o//."},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 615 writing style of the text stands apart from the other works of the corpus. The second problem is that the text does not seem to have been mentioned or cited elsewhere in the Tibetan literature of the period, which seems highly unlikely if the founder of the Bka' brgyud tradition truly had composed such an important key-text for the tradition. The third problem is that the work includes a very large number of Tibetan quotations from Indian Buddhist scriptures and treatises, that similar quotation patterns are not found in other early works of the Dags po tradition, and that it is virtually impossible to explain how Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen could have composed a literary treatise with so many quotations while living nearly all his life in environments where there were no access to larger collections of Buddhist texts. To these previously raised problems (KRAGH, op.cit.) can be added a fourth problem, namely that the name of the Buddhist monk requesting the composition of the treatise and serving as the scribe of the text, viz. Bande Dar ma skyabs, is not a name that is directly known in the circle of peers and students surrounding Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen. The name Bande Dar ma skyabs begins with the epithet Bande. This epithet has occasio­nally been used as a general title for Tibetan monks at least since the eleventh century, given that it is frequently attested in colophons of Tibetan translations of Indian Buddhist texts made during that epoch. Bande is probably a loanword from medieval Newari vande or bande, meaning 'venerable'; the Newari word seems to have been derived from Sanskrit vandya, 'venerable'.1277 The Tibetan semantic equivalent of the title is btsun pa, which has variously been used as Tibetan translations for Sanslait bhadanta, vandya, and bha,t.taraka. In short, the epithet bande suggests an ordained monk (dge slang, bhik�u). The name Dar ma skyabs, meaning \"prosperous refuge\" (*sm!1pattifarm:za?), is not attested anywhere else in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus. The first part of the name, Dar ma meaning 'prosperous', was by no means unusual in the twelfth century. In fact, Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen is stated in the hagiographical literature to have been named Dar ma grags in his boyhood prior to becoming a Buddhist monk.1278 The only direct student of Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen having a name featuring the word Dar ma is the founder of the ensuing 'Ba ' rom Bka' brgyud tradition, 'Ba' rom pa Dar ma dbang phyug (1127-1199). There is, however, no attestation of Dar ma dbang phyug being known as Dar ma skyabs or similar. Notably, the name Dar ma skyabs is attested as the name of a student of Bsod nams rin chen's student Phag mo gru pa rdo rje rgyal po (1110-1170). The gsung 'bum of Rdo rje rgyal po contains a short Mahiimudra meditation instruction, whose colophon states: \"[This instruction] was written by the precious Dharma Master Phag mo gru pa for the sake of Dar ma skyabs of Lha sa (lha sa ba Dar ma skyabs).\"1279 Accordingly, there seems to have been 1277 For an analysis of the word bande, see LIENHARD (310-313). 1278 See DK.A.Ga.2.19b1: sa mo lug gi lo la ngo mtshar ba'i bltas mang po dang bcas te sku 'khrungs/ mtshan dar ma grags shes btags shing/. 1279 The colophon occurs at the end of the segment entitled Lhasa ba dar ma skyabs la gdams pa, which is part of the text entitled Gdams pa gsal byed me long so gs gdams pa mams kyi skor la chos"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"616 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum a practitioner from Lhasa by the name Dar ma skyabs, who received meditation instruction from Rdo rje rgyal po, probably some time after Rdo rje rgyal po became a meditation master in his own right in the late 1140s and before he passed away in 1170. It is hypotheti­cally possible that this person Dar ma skyabs also met Bsod nams rin chen, requested the latter to compose the Dags po thar rgyan as a lam rim treatise, and served as the scribe for the writing of the text. However, aside from the mention of the name Bande Dar ma skyabs in the Dags po thar rgyan's colophon, there is no other attestation of Bsod nams rin chen and Dar ma skyabs having met. Hence, further evidence is needed in order to identify the monk Bande Dar ma skyabs listed in the colophon of text DK.A.E as being a person who with any sense of historical certainty can be placed in the circle of Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen. It should, moreover, be noted that the name of the author Lha rj e Bsod nams rin chen might refer to a later person by the name Bsod nams rin chen, which by no means was a unique name, given that many later Tibetan Buddhist monks have had that name. Yet, the epithet Lha rj e, meaning 'physician' or 'doctor', seems to point specifically to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, since he was educated as a physician in his youth and commonly is known as \"the doctor from Dags po\" (Dags po lha rj e). Moreover, the fact that the text (DK.A.E) contains several references to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen's teacher Mi la ras pa tightly links the work with Sgam po pa. A satisfactory solution to these problems sur­rounding the authorship of the treatise requires further textual analysis of the overall Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus and its transmission history, as well as better identifications of refe­rences to the Dags po thar rgyan treatise in other works of the ensuing period, which could better corroborate the reception history of the text. Regarding the structure of the text, the treatise provides an exposition of the bodhisattva path according to the Common Mahayana teachings in six main topics and twenty-one chapters. The chapters are build up around a series of outline verses (sdom, *uddana) that appear at the beginning of each chapter. This feature is reminiscent of the structure of some earlier Indian treatises, such as the Yogacarabhumi. The topics and chapters shall be outlined in the following summary. Segment DK.A.E.1: The segment begins (DK.A.E.1. lb1): /'phags pa 'jam dp al gzhon nur gyur pa la phyag 'tshal lo/ lrgyal dang de sras rnams dang dam pa 'i chos rnams dang/.

The homage is followed by a verse of adulation of the Buddha, the bodhisatt vas, the teachings, and the teacher. Also, the author states his intention to write this composition on the precious Dharma (dam chos rin chen), which he -while paraphrasing the title of the work -compares to a wish-fulfilling gem (yid bzhin nor bu lta bu). He states that he bases himself on the kindness (drin) of the master Mi la [ras pa] (mi la rj e).1281 Following these introductory verses, the writing style changes to prose and the actual exposition then begins by first giving a short outline of the key features of SaJJISiira and nirvil'.fa. The text here describes how sentient beings are caught in SaJJISiira and suffer due to delusion ('khrul pa, *bhriinti). It underlines how the practitioner ought to strive for the highest Awakening (bla med kyi byang chub, *sambodhi), which brings liberation from samsiira. Next, the text gives its first outline verse (sdom, *uddiina). This verse enumerates the six key topics that are to be presented in the treatise, thereby laying out the basic structure of the work. The six key topics include: (1) the cause (rgyu, *hetu) for Awakening; (2) the support (rten, *iidhiira), referring to the person (gang zag, \"'p udgala) who can attain Awa­kening; (3) the condition (rkyen, tp ratyaya) that spurs the individual to attain Awakening; (4) the methods (thabs, *upiiya) for attaining Awakening; (5) the result ('bras bu, *phala) of the path, which is the ultimate Awakening that is accomplished when following the path; and (6) the Awakened activities ('phrin las, *karman) of a buddha aimed at benefiting sentient beings. Having listed these six overall points, the text provides a second outline verse (sdom, *uddiina), which further specifies each of these key points: (1) the cause is the buddha­nature (bde gshegs snying po, *tat hiigatagarbha);1282 (2) the support is the precious human body (mi lus rin chen); (3) the condition is the spiritual teacher (dge ba'i bshes gnyen, *kalyii'.famitra); (4) the method is his instructions (gdams ngag, *avaviida); (5) the result is lb1-8a5, the Punakha xylograph (WlKG3680) folios lb1-7b5, the unidentified TBRC xylograph (WlCZ1013) folios lb1-6a3, and the Si khron mi rigs dp e skrun khang book (Chengdu, 1989) pp. 3-16. The Mi rigs dp e skrun khang book (Beijing, 1992) was not available to me at the time when producing these page references.

English translations: GUENTHER (1959: 1-13), GYALTSEN & CHODRON (1998:44-55). HOLMES & HOLMES (1995) was not available to me at this time. 1281 Several of the Western translations of the text, starting with GUENTHER (1959: 1 ), interpret the phrase mi la rj e as a dvandva compound referring to Mi la ras pa (mi la) and Atifa (rje). These modem translators have thus taken the adjective 'venerable' (rje) as a short form of the epithet jo bo rj e , \"the venerable lord,\" which is the usual Tibetan epithet for Atifa. That is a possible interpretation, although it may not stand out as the most obvious reading. 1282 The regular Sanskrit term is tathagatagarbha (Tibetan de gshegs snying po), but the Tibetan form of the word employed here -which occurs frequently in Tibetan writings on this topic - is bde gshegs snying po. Hypethetically speaking, this latter Tibetan form actually corresponds to the non­attested Sanskrit form *sugatagarbha."},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"618 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum the state of complete buddhahood (rdzags pa'i sangs rgyas kyi sku, *sambuddhakiiya); and (6) the Awakened activities are non-conceptual actions of benefit for sentient beings (rtog med 'gro don mdzad pa). These are the points to be presented in the main body of the treatise (lus rnam bzhag bstan pa), which are to be presented in detail (yan lag rgyas par 'chad). The remainder of the first chapter moves on to explain the first of the above points, namely the cause (rgyu, *hetu). It is taught that the cause is the buddha-nature (bde gshegs snying po, *tathiigatagarbha). It is here argued that even inferior persons (gang zag dman pa, *nihlnapudgala) are able to attain the highest Awakening (bla med kyi byang chub, *niruttarabodhi) if they apply themselves with effort to achieving this goal, because every sentient being (sems can thams cad, *sarvasattva) possesses the cause for buddhahood (sangs rgyas kyi rgyu, *buddhahetu), namely the buddha-nature (de bzhin gshegs pa'i snying po, *tathiigatagarbha). To prove this point, the chapter provides four often-cited scriptural quotations establi­shing that the buddha-nature is found in all sentient beings. The text attributes these quota­tions (explicitly indicated as such with the Tibetan quotation marker ces) to the following scriptures: (1) the Samiidhiriijasntra, (2-3) the longer and the shorter versions of the Mahiiparinirvii(iasutra, and (4) the MahayiinasutriilaJ?ikiira. Nonetheless, apart from the quotation from the latter siistra treatise, the three sutra quotations are, in fact, not found in the actual canonical scriptures in the exact wording in which they are quoted here.1283 There are a number of possible explanation for the lack of correspondence between the quoted passaged and the Sutra scriptures. It is possible that the scriptural quotations are entirely apocryphal. It is possible that they are found in other scriptures than those men-tioned here and that they have been misattributed to the wrong sources. It is possible that the passages were originally derived from the cited Sutras but that they were taken from other versions of those texts than the ones now found in the Tibetan canon xylographs; this latter option might even include that the passages were originally drawn from the sutras in other language versions, such as the Chinese translations of the texts. Or, it is possible that the cited passages are mere paraphrases that only are meant to sum up the meaning of longer passages found in the given sutra texts. Having stated these scriptural quotations, the first chapter next proceeds to present three logical arguments (rgyu mtshan) for proving that sentient beings indeed are endowed with the buddha-nature (sangs rgyas kyi snying po can). The stated arguments are: (l) because the dharmakiiya, i.e., emptiness, pervades sentient beings; (2) because there are no divi­sions in the nature of things (chos nyid, *dharmatii), i.e., in reality (de bzhin nyid, *tatha­tii) ; and (3) because every sentient being possesses a particular spiritual predisposition (rigs, 1283 The absence of the passage attributed to the Samiidhiriijasutra in the Tibetan version of the sutra scripture has previously been noted by STEARNS (2010:398 fn. 568) in a different context. The passage that is here attributed to the smaller Parinirvii!iasutra is, however, found in the Ratnagotra­vibhiigavyiikhyii D4025.88a5, as has been pointed out by PARK (2011 :95 fn. 2)."},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 619 *gotra). The chapter quotes verse 1.28 from the Ratnagotravibhaga as being the textual basis for these three reasonings. When explaining the notion of the spiritual predisposition, the chapter gives another outline verse (sdom, *uddana) that lists the possible predispositions for buddhahood (sangs rgyas kyi rigs, *buddhagotra) as being of five types. These are: (1) a predisposition for lacking a predisposition (rigs chad kyi rigs), (2) an indeterminate predisposition (ma nges pa'i rigs, *aniyatagotra), (3) a fravaka predisposition (nyan thos kyi rigs, *fravakagotra), (4) a pratyekabuddha predisposition (rang sangs rgyas kyi rigs, '\"p ratyekabuddhagotra), and (5) a Mahayana predisposition (theg pa chen po'i rigs, *mahayanagotra). The remain­der of the chapter presents these five categories in detail. The text's division of predispositions into five types may be notable, since it has been argued by Hidenori S. SAKUMA (2007), discussing a different context, that such a fivefold gotra division strictly speaking only originated in 71h-century Chinese Buddhism and that it is not expressly found in Indian sour ces. Whether or not this might imply a Chinese influ­ence on Tibetan tathagatagarbha thought, the fivefold division generally seems to be com­mon in Tibetan writings, at least in Tibetan works that postdate the present text. In terms of the broader relationship between the Dags po thar rgyan (DK.A.E) and the rest of the Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum corpus, it may be noted that references to the tathagata­garbha notion are exceedingly rare in other parts of the bka ' 'bum. Elsewhere, it only features sporadically in segments DK.A.Nya.6 and DK.A.VaJ:Tl.1.3b1, whereas in the Dags po thar rgyan the tathagatagarbha concept is presented very prominently as the most basic and foundational notion in the doctrinal structure of the entire treatise. Moreover, while the Dags po thar rgyan in the first chapter makes copious direct and indirect references to the Indian treatise Ratnagotravibhaga (Rgyud bla ma), citations of this work are seldom made in the remainder of the bka' 'bum. In fact, other texts of the corpus only include three quotations from this Indian source, found in segments DK.A.Ca.19 and DK.A.Ca.20. This stands in contrast to the view of some later Tibetan histories, where the claim is made that Bsod nams rin chen should have stated to his student Phag mo gru pa that the Ratnagotra­vibhaga is the basic scripture for his Mahamudra doctrine.1284 The first chapter ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the first chapter on the cause (rgyu, *hetu) in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Ador­ning the Precious Liberation.\" Segment DK.A.E.2: The segment begins (DK.A.E.2.7a1): lrten ni mi !us rin chen me hog/ Ices pa la/.

From the internal evidence of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum itself, it may be added that segment DK.A.Da.7 identifies the \"texts teaching Mahiimudrii\" (phyag rgya chen po ston pa 'i gzhung) as being the Indian realization songs (Dohii), the three text-cycles of the new Tantras (gsar ma skor gsum), and other such works (sogs). It is notable, however, that the segment does not mention the Ratnagotravibhiiga.

The support is the precious human body (mi lus rin chen or mi lus rin po che). Although all sentient beings of any sm11siiric realm are endowed with the buddha-nature, the sentient beings who find themselves in a situation wherein they are able to reach Awakening are, in fact, only those beings who are reborn in a physical body (lus, *deha) that is free and endowed with favorable circumstances (dal 'byor) for practicing the Dharma. An outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) lists five headings under which the chapter explains this point: (1) having the leisure (dal ha, *k�a�ia) to practice the Dharma, given that a human is free from eight inopportune circumstances; (2) being endowed ('byor ha, *sampat) with ten favorable circumstances; (3) having faith (dad pa, *fraddhii) in the form of conviction (yid ches, *sampratyaya) of the Buddha's teachings; (4) having faith in the form of the wish ('dod pa, *icchii) to attain Awakening; and (5) having faith in the form of developing a bright and pure mind (dang ba, *p rasiida). The two prior headings pertain to the precious human rebirth that is difficult to obtain (rnyed par dka ), while the latter three headings describe the mindset needed for practicing the Dharma. The chapter then lays out the eight inopportune circumstances (mi khom pa brgyad, *a�fiik�a�iya) and the ten favorable circumstances including five obtained by oneself (rang gi 'byor pa, *iitmasampat) and five that are dependent on others (gzhan gyi 'byor pa, *p ara­sampat). Thereupon, it briefly presents the division of different types of practitioners known as \"the three persons\" (skyes bu gsum), which is a doctrinal system drawn from Ati8a's Bodhipathapradfpa (Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma). Finally, the segment explains the three types of faith (dad pa, *fraddha) mentioned above. Throughout the chapter, numerous quotations are given from dozens of Indian Buddhist scriptures and treatises in order to support and embellish each point. The chapter ends by stating that the individual (gang zag, *p udgala) who is endowed with such a human rebirth and these three kinds of faith possesses the necessary support (rten, *iidhiira) for reaching Awakening. The chapter's colophon (cited in Tibetan above) says: \"[This was] the second chapter on the support (rten, *adhara) in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation. \" In terms of the broader relationship between the Dags po thar rgyan and the other works in the corpus, the theme of the precious human body (mi lus rin chen) possessing leisure, being endowed with opportune circumstances (dal 'byor), and being hard to obtain (rnyed 1285 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan.6bi-lla2, DK.B.E.2.7a1-llb(?)

It is frequently mentioned as a basic point for contemplation to be practiced by the yogi in order to generate the right motivation for practicing the Dharma. First and foremost, the topic is repeatedly raised in the texts belonging to the Teachings to the Gathering genre (tshogs chos ). 1286 Yet, the topic also comes up briefly in a number of other contexts.1287 It should though be noted that none of these passages employs the many scriptural citations seen in the present chapter.

The teacher functions as the necessary condition (rkyen, *p ratyaya) for the practitioner, who possesses a precious human body and thereby is able to practice the path. Without the support and guidance obtained from an authentic spiritual teacher, it is said to be exceedingly difficult to enter the path leading to Awakening, since numerous negative tendencies are so thoroughly ingrained in the practitioner's mind and since he is naturally obstructed by the ripening of various harmful actions done repeatedly in the multitude of previous lives. 1286 See segments Dk.A.Ca.I, DK.A.Ca.6, DK.A.Ca.7, DK.A.Ca.8, DK.A.Ca.IO, DK.A.Ca.17, DK.A.Ja.17, DK.A.Ja.19, and DK.A.Nya.8. 1287 See DK.A.Dza.10, DK.A.Dza.16, DK.A.Wa.2, DK.A.Wa.6, DK.A.Wa.16, DK.A.Zha.9, DK.A.La.3, DK.A.Ki.22, DK.A.Khi.5, DK.A.Gi. l, and DK.A.Chi.

The first point is a statement of the reasons ('thad pa, *upapatti) as to why it is necessary to rely on a spiritual teacher. This point takes the form of a few scrip­tural quotations (lung, *iigama), a logical reasoning (rigs pa, *yukti) arguing that the practi­tioner would not know how to practice the path without the instruction of a teacher, and three analogies (dpe, *upamii) comparing the spiritual teacher to a guide (lam mkhan), a bodyguard (skyel ma), and a ferry man (mnyan pa). The second point is a categoriz ation (dbye ba, *p rabheda) of spiritual teachers into four types, namely the spiritual teacher who is an ordinary person (so so skye bo, *prthagjana), a bodhisattva who has reached a high bodhisattva level (sa chen po la gnas pa'i byang chub sems dp a', *mahiibhamisthitabodhisattva), a buddha in his emanation body (sprul pa'i sku, *nirmii'.lakiiya), and a buddha in his enjoyment body (longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku, *sm?ibhogakiiya). It is argued that the type of spiritual teacher whom the practitioner is able to encounter depends strictly on practitioner's own spiritual advancement. The third point is a presentation of the defining characteristics of each of the four types (phye ba so so'i mtshan nyid) . In this framework, the chapter lays out the qualities of a buddha, the ten powers of caring for others (rjes su 'dzin pa'i dbang bcu) found in advanced bodhisattvas, and the characteristics of an authentic spiritual teacher who is an ordinary person. The latter set of characteristics is variously explained as consisting of eight, four, or two positive traits. These qualities are presented on the basis of textual passages from the Bodhisattvabhumi, the Mahiiyiinasutriilaf!Ikiira, and the Bodhicaryiivatiira. The fourth point pertains to the different ways in which the practitioner should venerate, serve, and rely on the spiritual teacher (bsten pa'i thabs, *sevopiiya) by showing him respect, feeling devoted, and receiving his teachings with due care and understanding. Finally, the fifth point briefly lists the benefits (phan yon, *anu5a1?isa) derived from encountering and relying on a proper spiritual teacher. The chapter ends with the colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the third chapter in Th e Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, concerned with relying on a spiritual teacher (dge ba 'i bshes gnyen bsten pa).\" Generally speaking, the chapter's topic -particularly its explanation on the proper qua­lifications of a spiritual teacher (dge ba'i bshes gnyen, *kalyii'.lamitra) -is shared with at least five passages in other parts of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum.1293 It should, however, be underlined that the details of how the qualities are explained differ to somewhat between these various passages. None of the other segments accords precisely with how the topic is presented in the Dags po thar rgyan.

The explanation of this key topic is, however, so extensive that it carries on throughout chapter four to chapter nineteen of the text. The fourth chapter begins by reasoning that although the practitioner is endowed with the buddha-nature, has previously attained a precious human body in a number of earlier reincarnations, and may even have met with proper spiritual teachers in his former lives, he nonetheless has still not attained buddhahood due to four hindering factors. These factors are attachment to the sensual pleasures of this life (tshe 'di 'i spyod yul la chags pa), attachment to the happiness that may be attained in the higher states of sm1isaric existence (srid pa'i bde ba la chags pa), attachment to the happiness of the peace of nirviifta (zhi ba'i bde ba la chags pa), and a lack of knowledge of the right means .to attain buddhahood (sangs rgyas sgrub pa 'i thabs mi shes pa). The effective way to overcome these hindrances is to listen to and cultivate the instructions (gdam ngag, *avaviida) of a spiritual teacher. An outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) then sums up the teacher's instructions in four broad categories, which are to be presented in the course of the following chapters, viz. (1) instruction on the contemplation of impermanence (mi rtag pa sgom pa'i gdam ngag) (chapter 4), (2) instruction on the contemplation of the detrimental character of sar[lsiira along with the functioning of actions and their results ('khor ba'i nyes dmigs las 'bras dang bcas pa sgom pa'i gdam ngag) (chapters 5-6), (3) instruction on the cultivation of friendli­ness and compassion (byams pa dang snying rj e sgom pa 'i gdam ngag) (chapter 7), and (4) instruction on engendering the resolve for the highest Awakening (byang chub mchog tu sems bskyed pa 'i gdam ngag) (chapters 8-19). Each of these instructions is said respectively to remedy one of the four hindering factors that have hitherto prevented the practitioner from achieving buddhahood. The topic presented in the remainder of the fourth chapter is the spiritual teacher's instruction on the contemplation of impermanence (mi rtag pa sgom pa). The teaching on impermanence is first supported by two scriptural quotations, in which the Buddha declares the transitory nature of everything composite. Thereupon, an outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) specifies three headings for the contemplation on impermanence: (1) its subdivisions (dbye ba, *p rabheda), (2) the contemplative methods (sgom thabs, *bhiivanopiiya), and (3) the benefits (phan yon, *anufar[lsa) derived from contemplating impermanence. Regarding the subdivisions, impermanence is said to pertain to the outer world and the sentient beings who inhabit it; to the character of general and subtle phenomena; and to others and oneself. 1294 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan.15llt;-20b4, DK.B.E.4.15br21 b3, DK.D.Nyi.4.16b1-22bi, DK.S.Nyi.4.26br37a2, and DK.T.Nyi.4.15b-2lb, NGMPP microfilm L150/5 folios l3b4- l8b6, Rtsib ri 'i par ma vol.

Next, the meditator should consider the impermanence of all living beings by contemplating the certainty of death in others (gzhan mi rtag pa) as well as the certainty of his own death (rang mi rtag pa). The latter is explained in further detailed by laying out contemplations of death ('chi ba bsgom pa), the signs of death ('chi ba'i mtshan nyid bsgom pa), the constant loss of life span (tshe 'dzad pa bsgom pa), and the separation experienced in death ('bral bar bsgom pa). A detailed contemplation of the certainty of death (nges par 'chi ba) and its consequences follows, presented in great detail via three triads of arguments and pertinent analogies. Finally, the chapter presents the benefits of contemplating death and impermanence, primarily consisting in that the practitioner fully overcomes attachment to the present life (tshe 'di la mngon zhen ldog pa). This form of contemplation is, moreover, said to restore faith, be an aid for diligence, and to serve as a supporting factor for realizing the ultimate equality of everything, being an insight that arises when all attachment and aversion has ceased.

An outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) sums up this contemplation under three headings: (l) the suffering that is intrinsic in everything conditioned ('du byed kyi sdug bsngal), (2) the suffering of perpetual change ('gyur ba'i sdug bsngal), and (3) the suffering of suffering (sdug bngal gyi sdug bsngal). The chapter explains these three forms of suffering (sdug bsngal gsum po) through a series of analogies combined with pertinent scriptural quotations from Indian sources. The first type of suffering is the bondage that is involved in existing as a sentient being having the five aggregates (phung po, *skandha), which intrinsically attract suffering like an infectious disease. The second type of suffering is the misery felt in the inevitable loss of all forms of ordinary gain or happiness. The third type of suffering, which is presented at great length in the chapter, consists of all the concrete physical and mental encounters with misery and suffering that a sentient being constantly undergoes in the various forms of sa111siiric existence. The text here provides a detailed presentation of the three lower forms of rebirth (ngan song, *durgati), namely those as a hell being (dmyal ba, *naraka), a hungry ghost (yi dags, \"'p reta), and an animal (dud 'gro, *tiryaiic). Each lower existence is explained in terms of its subdivisions (dbye ba), location (gnas), its sufferings (sdug bsngal), and the life span (tshe) that beings have in that realm of existence. These explanations are derived from Vasubandhu's Abhidhannakofa and other Indian works. The text also supplies quotations from these sources. Thereupon, the chapter gives a description of the three higher forms of rebirth (bde 'gro, *sugati), viz. birth as a human (mi, *manu�ya), half god (lha min, *asura), and god (lha, *deva), likewise detailing the suffering encountered in those types of existence. The presentation of the suffering experienced as a human being includes a rather detai led synopsis of the Buddhist teaching on embryology, outlining the weekly development of the human fetus in the womb as taught in the Garbhiivakriintisutra. In comparison to the Siltra, the present chapter, however, places a great deal stronger focus on the pain these developmental stages induce.1297 The chapter concludes with a series of scriptural quota­tions emphasizing the need for the practitioner to turn the mind completely away from sa111siira, given the great mass of misery and suffering that sai11siira inevitably involves. The chapter ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the fifth chapter in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Te aching Adorning the Precious Liberation, teaching the suffering of sa'!1siira ('khor ba'i sdug bsngal bstan pa).\" The topic of contemplating the suffering and shortcomings of sa111siira is frequently mentioned in other parts of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum, but nowhere does this contemplation 1297 For studies of the embryological stages taught in the siitra, see Y AMABE (2013) and KRITZER (2013) with further bibliographical references."},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"626 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum receive as detailed treatment as attested here.1298 One such context is the Bka' gdams pa teaching on the three types of persons (skyes bu gsum) who practice the Buddha's teachings, where the small person (skyes bu chung ngu) is said to be motivated to practice the Dharma due to feeling apprehensive of the suffering experienced in lower rebirths in smJisiira. Furthermore, the contemplation of SmJisiiric suffering is often mentioned as a motivational method for engendering diligence in the practitioner and for turning the mind away from saf!isiiric existence in its entirety.

Action (las, *karman) includes the mental aspect of intention (sems pa'i las, *cetaniikarman) and the ensuing intentional verbal and bodily actions (bsam pa'i las, *cetayitviikarman). An outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) first lists the headings of the present chapter, organizing the presentation into a sub-division (dbye ba, *bheda) of action, its defining features (mtshan nyid, *lak�afta), its appropriation (bdag gir bya ba, *svfkarafta), its accompanying features (bgo skal spyod pa, *piir�ada), how it is possible for big results to come about from a tiny cause (chung las cher smin), and the enduring nature (chud mi za ba, *avipraftiiSa) of the result of action. The sub-division of action divides action into the cause and result of non-beneficial action (bsod nams ma yin pa'i las rgyu 'bras, *apuftyakannaphala), the cause and result of beneficial action (bsod nams kyi las rgyu 'bras, *puftyakannaphala), and the cause an d result of immovable action (mi g.yo ba'i las rgyu 'bras, *iinifijyakannaphala). The non-beneficial actions are presented in the form of the ten negative actions (mi dge ba bcu, *dasiiku§ala), which are thoroughly explained in the chapter. These include killing, taking what has not been given, sexual misconduct, telling lies, slandering, saying hurtful things, engaging in useless talk, covetousness, ill-will, and upholding erroneous views. The results of each of these negative actions are taught in the form of its ripening result (rnam par smin pa 'i 'bras bu, *vipiikaphala), the result that correlates with its cause (rgyu mthun pa'i las, *ni�yandaphala), and its dominant result (dbang gi 'bras bu, *adhipatiphala). 1298 Other segments in the corpus that briefly mention this theme in a variety of contexts include DK.A.Nga.I, DK.A.Ca.3, DK.A.Ca.4, DK.A.Cha.30, DK.A.Ja.18, Dk.A.Dza.15, DK.A.Dza.16, DK.A.La.3, DK.A.La.5, DK.A.Sa.1, DK.A.Sa.11, DK.A.Ha.16, DK.A.A.6, DK.A.Ki.10, DK.A.Ki.22, DK.A.Khi.2, DK.A.Khi.4, and DK.A.Chi.

Also, an explanation of the ripening result of action is given with regard to the type of afflictive emotion (nyon mongs pa, *klefa) involved in the action, the action's frequency (grangs, *sm71khya), and its object (yul, *vi�aya). Next, the chapter briefly presents beneficial actions in the form of the ten positive actions (dge ba bcu, *dafakufala), namely giving up the ten negative actions and doing their opposites. A slightly more expansive synopsis is given of immovable actions, signifying the existential effects of practicing meditative absorption (snyoms 'jug, *samapatti). The prac­tice of such meditative concentration (bsam gtan, *dhyana) may lead to rebirth as a god in the form realm (gzugs khams, *rupadhatu) or in the formless realm (gzugs med khams, *arupyadhatu). These meditative states and the associated celestial realms are briefly laid out, detailing the seventeen classes of gods of the form realm and the four levels of the formless realm. The appropriation (bdag gir bya ba, *svfkara�w) of action and its result is explained as meaning that the result of an action ripens in the stream of being belonging to the same person who committed the action and not to someone else. In other words, the principle of action and result is strictly individual and personal. The accompanying features of action (bgo skat spyod pa, *par�ada) means that there is a fixed correlation between the nature of the action and its result in the sense that a positive action invariably produces a positive result, whereas a negative action always brings about a negative result. The point that big results can arise from a tiny cause (chung las cher smin) is said to refer to the fact that even a single action can produce a very long-lasting result, e.g., rebirth in a hell realm for thousands of years, if the character of the action is intensely positive or negative. Finally, the enduring nature and inevitableness (chud mi za ba, *avipra�afa) of the result of action means that an action is always going produce a result at some point in time, even if that result might first occur in a very distant future, unless a counter-action has been done to eradicate the negative outcome. Hence, the chapter concludes that the practitioner ought to be terrified by the misery of sary1sara and should uphold strong belief in the principles of actions and their results that govern the workings of sm71sa1a.

These spiritual qualities function as remedies (gnyen po, '1-p ratipak�a) against any attachment that the practitioner might entertain towards reaching personal hapiness in the peaceful state of nirvii1:ta, given that such attachment would be uncharacteri stic for a follower of the Mahiiyiina. First, friendliness -also often rendered in English with 'kindness' -is summed up under six headings in an outline verse (sdom, *uddiina). These include: its sub-division (dbye ba, *bheda) along with its objects of reference (dmigs yul, *iilamhanavi�aya), the form it takes (rnam pa, *iikiira), the contemplative methods (sgom thabs, *hhiivanopiiya) for cultivating it, the measure of its perfection ('byongs tshad), and the good qualities (yon tan, *gu!ia) that are derived from it. The sub-division of friendliness is threefold based on its object of reference: friendliness with reference to sentient beings (sems can la dmigs pa'i hymns pa), friendliness with refe­rence to phenomena (chos la dmigs pa'i byams pa), and non-referential friendliness (dmigs pa med pa'i hymns pa). It is stated that the explanations given in the present text only pertain to the first type of friendliness. The form or nature of friendliness is the wish that all sentient beings may be happy. As for the contemplative methods employed to cultivate it, the text gives a relatively detailed presentation on how to meditate. The meditator here contemplates all the help and benefit that he or she has previously received from sentient beings who have been his or her mothers in former lives and that the practitioner consequently should wish every form of happiness to all sentient beings in return. Its measure of perfection is said to be that the advanced practitioner only desire s the happiness of others and fully forgoes any thought of happiness for him-or herself. The good qualities derived from having cultivated friendliness is first and foremost an inexhaustible accumulation of beneficence (bsod nams, *pu!1ya).

Secondly, the chapter presents compassion (snying rj e, *kant!w) as summed in another outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) consisting of the same six headings. The sub-division of compassion is likewise according to its object of reference, i.e., the same three forms mentioned in the case of friendliness. Compassion takes the form of wishing that all sentient beings are free from suffering. The contemplative method employed to cultivate compassion is again to think of all sentient beings as having been one's mother in previous lives, then to consider all the many sufferings that a mother undergoes, and finally to wish all sentient beings to be completely free from all suffering. These contemplations are presented in detail in the chapter. The measure of having perfected compassion is that the advanced practitioner no longer feels that he is better or more important than others and he constantly maintains the desire to liberate all sentient beings from SOf!Lsiira. Finally, the text describes the good qualities derived from compassion, particularly an inexhaustible accumulation of beneficence.

An outline verse (sdom, *uddana) enumerates twelve headings for these explanations:the basis (rten, *iidhiira), its nature (ngo bo, *svanlpa), its divisions (dbye ba, *bheda), focis (dmigs pa, *iilambana), motive (rgyu, *nimitta), the source for receiving it (blang yul,*samiidiinavi�aya), the ritual for obtaining it (cha ga, *vidhi), its benefits (phan yon, *anusm71sa), the faults involved in losing it (nyes dmigs, *adznava), the causes for losing it('char rgyu), the methods for restoring it (bcos thabs, *vifodhanopiiya), and the trainingneeded to cultivate it (bslab bya, *sik�itav ya). These explanations are spread out overchapters eight to nineteen. Chapter eight only covers the first of the above twelve points, namely the proper basis orreceptacle (rten, *adhiira) for engendering the resolve for Awakening. What is called thebasis or receptable here signifies the kind person who is able to engender the resolve. That person's character must exhibit the traits of the Mahayana predisposition (theg pa chen po'i rigs, *mahayanagotra) and these traits must have become activated (rigs sad pa). The person must have taken refuge in the Three Jewels (dkon mchog gsum la skyabs su song ba) and should uphold one or another of the seven sets of Pratimok�a vows (so sor thar pa'i sdom pa rigs bdun). These qualifications are justified in the text with reference to the Bodhisattvabhumi, the Bodhipathapradfpa, and the Abhidharmakofa. In particular, the chapter provides a very detailed explanation on going for refuge (skyabs su 'gro ba, *SaralJBTJigamana) in the Three Jewels (dkon mchog gsum, *triratna), i.e., the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. An outline verse (sdom, *uddana) enume­rates the topics covered by this explanation as consisting of the following nine points: the division (dbye ba), the receptable (rten), the object (yul), the time (dus), the motivation (bsam pa), the ritual (cho ga), the effect (byed pa'i las), the training (bslab bya), and the benefits (phan yon). The division (dbye ba, *bheda) of different types of Buddhist refuge includes a general form of taking refuge (thun mong gi skyabs 'gro) and a form that is particular (khyad par, *vise�a) to followers of the Mahayana. The receptacle (rten, *afaya) is the person wishing to take refuge, either due to fear of smJisara or due to the Mahayana attitude of wishing to liberate others from sm?isara. The object (yul, *vifaya) of the refuge is the Three Jewels, which may refer to a concrete object placed in front of the practitioner, the intended object signifying the meaning and qualities that these objects represent, as well as the ultimate object of refuge, which is buddhahood. The time (dus, *kala) denotes the duration for how long the practitioner takes refuge. The duration may either be for as long as the practitioner lives or it may be until he has attained full and complete Awakening. The proper motivation (bsam pa, *abhipriiya) for taking refuge is either fear of sa171sara or the wish to liberate others. the Punakha xylograph (Wl KG3680) folios 53b6-6lbi, TBRC xylograph (WICZI013) folios 40br 47a1, and the Si khron mi rigs dp e skrun khang book (Chengdu, 1989) pp. 117-133.

As for the effect (byed pa'i las, *kiira�w) of taking refuge, it is promised that the refuge will protect the practitioner against all sorts of miseries, bad rebirths, and wrong views, while the special Mahayana refuge will protect against stooping to the path of the Hfnayiina. Thereupon, the chapter gives a longer presentation of the training (bslab bya, *sik0i­tavya) that should be observed by the practitioner upon having taken refuge. This includes venerating the Three Jewels, e.g., by making offerings to them; never to forsake them; to take refuge repeatedly and to recollect the qualities of the Three Jewels; not to take refuge in other gods; to avoid inflicting harm on sentient beings; not to follow the teachings of non-Buddhist schools (mu stegs can, *tfrthika); and to treat symbols of the Three Jewels with care and respect. The chapter then lists various benefits (phan yon, *anusm1isa) that are derived from taking refuge, such as reaching liberation and Awakening, purifying negative actions, removing various obstacles, accumulating great beneficence, and avoiding bad rebirths. Finally, the chapter presents the third requisite that the person must possess in order to be able to engender the resolve for Awakening, namely that he or she must have taken and observe one of the seven sets of Priitimok0a vows. In brief, these sets of vows include the conduct of a monastic practitioner, such as a monk or a nun, as well as the conduct to be upheld by a lay practitioner. The need for taking and upholding such vows is laid out in some detail. The chapter ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the eighth chapter in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, on taking refuge and holding vows (skyabs su 'gro zhing sdom pa gzung ba).\" The topic of taking refuge is not explained in detail in other parts of the Dags po'i bka' 'bum, although the importance of taking refuge is mentioned in passing in a few seg­ments. 1305 The topic of religious vows (sdom pa, *sm11vara) that regulate the practitioner's behavior is clearly important to the instructions presented throughout the Dags po 'i bka' 'bum, because there are numerous segments that raise this point in passing.1306 Nevertheless, the only other passages in the corpus that contain detailed explanations of vows are the five segments that discuss the topic of the three sets of vows (sdom gsum).1307 Those segments differ from the present chapter, given that the three sets of vows not only include the priitimok0a vows for outer conduct but also pertain to the vows of inner and secret conduct of the Mahiiyiina and Mantrayiina teachings. 1305 See segments DK.A.Nga.!, DK.A.Cha.22, DK.A.La.3, DK.A.Sa.

While the preceeding chapter laid out the necessary basis (rten, *iidhiira) that consisted in the individual possessing the Mahayana predisposition, taking refuge, and upholding the outer Priitimok�a vows of a monastic or lay practitioner, the present chapter enters into an exten­sive explanation of the actual resolve for Awakening (byang chub tu sems, *bodhicitta) and its initial creation in the practitioner in the form of the ritual for receiving the bodhisattva vow. From among the twelve headings covering the text's teaching on bodhicitta listed at the outset of chapter 8, the ninth chapter covers points two to eleven, including: the nature of bodhicitta, its divisions, foci, motive, the source for receiving it, the ritual, its benefits, the faults involved in losing it, the causes for losing it, and the methods for restoring it. The form or nature (ngo bo, *svari'ipa) of the resolve for Awakening is defined as, \"the wish to attain complete and perfect Awakening in order to benefit others\" (gzhan gyi don du yang dag par rdzogs pa'i byang chub 'dad pa). This definition is derived from the Indian Abhisamayiilm?1kiira treatise. The divisions (dbye ba, *bheda) of bodhicitta are laid out in three different models. The first model presents bodhicitta via twenty-two similes (dpe'i sgo nas dbye ba) taught in the Abhisamayiilary1kiira. The similes are arranged in the progressive steps of the five paths (lam lnga). The second model is based on a distinction of four stages (sa mtshams kyi sgo nas dbye ba) of bodhicitta cultivation taught in the Mahiiyiinasiitriilm?1kiira, including ascertainment (mos pa), exalted conviction (!hag pa 'i bsam pa), a mature stage (rnam par smin pa), and the stage of buddhahood where the hindrances have been fully eliminated (sgrib pa spangs pa). These steps follow the doctrine of the Yogaciirii treatises, starting with the Bodhisatt vabhilmi. The third model is a twofold division according to defining characteristics (mtshan nyid kyi sgo nas dbye ba), namely into the ultimate bodhicitta (don dam byang chub kyi sems) and the relative bodhicitta (kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems). These two forms of bodhicitta are here presented with reference to the Sary1dhinirmocana­sutra and the Mahiiyiinasutriilary1kiira. Having defined the ultimate bodhicitta in brief, the chapter moves into an extensive teaching on the relative bodhicitta. It is stated that the relative bodhicitta consists of two aspects, the aspiring bodhicitta (smon pa'i sems) and the applied bodhicitta ('jug pa'i sems). Differing interpretations of these two aspects are briefly discussed comparatively between the Indian tradition of Nagarjuna and Santideva said to 1308 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan.44b4-59b2, DK.B.E.9.47b6-63b5, DK.D.Nyi.9.49ar 65ai, DK.S.Nyi.9.85arl 14b1, and DK.T.Nyi.9.48n-64n, NGMPP microfilm Ll50/5 folios 4Jb4-55b2, Rtsib ri 'i par ma vol.

Next, the chapter analyzes the resolve's foci (dmigs pa, *iilambana). These include Awakening (byang chub, *bodhi) as well as benefit for sentient beings (sems can gyi don, *sattviirtha). The segment here draws its explanations mainly from the Bodhisattvabhilmi and the Mahiiyiinasiltriilm11kiira. Regarding the motive (rgyu, *nimitta) for engendering the resolve for Awakening, reference is made to the Dafabhilm ikasittra and the Bodhisattvabhillni, citing such reasons as having faith in the Buddha, seeing how sentient beings suffer, and feeling inspired by spiritual teachers. The source for receiving the bodhisattva vow (blang yul) is said primarily to be a spiri­tual teacher (slob dp on, *iiciirya). The aspiring bodhisattva should go and meet a good teacher in order to obtain the vow, even if the journey might be long and arduous. The qualities of an authentic teacher are briefly defined. If, however, the travel to meet the teacher in person is too dangerous for the practitioner's life or chastity, the segment also explains how it alternatively may be possible to receive the bodhisattva vow in virtual form simply in front of a Buddha image or by visualizing buddhas and bodhisattvas. In these matters, the chapter draws on Ati5a's Bodhipathapradlpa, the Bodhisattvabhitmi, and Santi­deva's Sik�iisamuccaya. Thereupon, the segment moves into a comprehensive explanation of the ritual (cha ga, *vidhi) by which the practitioner obtains the bodhisattva vow and thereby ritually engen­ders the resolve for Awakening. The chapter explains in detail the two main ritual traditions for this ceremony that are used in Tibet, namely the tradition of Mafijusrl-Nagarjuna­Santideva and the tradition of Maitreya-Asaliga-Gser gling pa (the Indonesian Dharmakirti of Suvarl).advlpa). 1309 The ritual steps of each tradition are laid out in detail, with inclusion of several underlying theoretical points concerning worship, the weight of negative actions, purification, and other issues pertinent to the ritual steps. The benefits (phan yon, *anufa1!1sa) of engendering the resolve for Awakening are listed in the form of those that are countable and those that are uncountable. The segment here describes how excellent a person the practitioner becomes by developing this lofty ideal . Thereupon, the downsides (nyes pa, *do:ja) of losing this resolve once it has been engendered are stated, given that such loss leads to negative rebirths, failure in benefiting others, and defeat in the attempt to attain high spiritual levels. The last part of the chapter lays out the mistakes that may cause the practitioner to lose the resolve ('char rgyu), either by excluding any sentient being from the spiritual aspiration, forsaking the training, or by committing highly negative actions that cause harm to others. Further, the chapter teaches the method that the practitioner must apply to restore the bodhisattva vow in case the resolve has been weakened or lost (bcos thabs, *vifodhano­piiya). This is simply done by retaking the bodhisattva vow in the same manner as it was 1309 The former tradition denotes a ritual that is derived from Santideva's Sik0asamuccaya and Bodhicaryavatara, while the latter tradition is based on the Bodhisattvabhilmi."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"634 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum previously done.

This point constitutes the twelfth heading from among the twelve headings listed in the uddiina verse at the beginning of chapter eight. The instructions on the trainingare covered in segments 10 to 19. The tenth segment describes in brief the issues involved in forming the aspiring aspect(smon pa'i sems) of the relative bodhicitta (kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems, *sm7ivrtti­bodhicitta). An outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) at the beginning of the chapter enumerates five aspects of the aspiring bodhicitta. The first aspect is that the aspiring bodhisattva should avoid excluding any sentient being from his or her resolve to attain Awakening (sems can blos mi btang ba). It is explained that such an all-inclusive attitude of complete impartiality is the method needed to avoid losing the bodhicitta ideal.

Otherwise, he will not only have weakened but will have fully lost the bodhisattva vow. It is also explained that one issue at hand here is the problem that the practitioner may decide to give up the aspiration to reach Awake­ning for the sake of liberating others and may instead decide to follow the Buddhist paths of friivakas and pratyekabuddhas which only result in personal liberation for the practitioner himself without leading to ensuing Awakened activities aimed at liberating others. The problem at hand also pertains to committing actions that bring serious harm to other beings, which likewise undermines and violates the bodhisattva's good intention to benefit others. The second aspect is to keep in mind the benefits and spiritual developments that are produced by upholding the bodhicitta motivation (sems de 'i phan yon dran bya). It is stated that such recollection is the method needed to avoid weakening the bodhicitta ideal. The segment refers to a scriptural reference given in Atifa's Bodhipathapradfpa, where it is said that the Ga1:1i;favyuhasiitra presents the many benefits obtained by engendering the resolve for Awakening. The segment then sums up the Siitra's teaching in 130 similes by categori­zing them under four general headings. The segment recommends the practitioner to perform such recollection practices continuously in connection with the regular meditation sessions. The third aspect is to gather the two requisites (tshogs gnyis bsags par bya ba, *saf!ibhiirasmJibhrta), i.e., the accumulation of beneficence (bsod nams, *p unya) and knowledge (ye shes, *jniina). This is the method needed to strengthen the bodhicitta ideal. The principles of these accumulations are briefly explained with reference to the ten Dhar­ma practices ( chos spyod bcu ), 1313 the four bases for gathering [disciples] ( bsdu ba 'i dngos po bzhi, *catuJ:tsm?igrahavastu), 1314 and the insight purifying the three elements of subject, object, and action ('khor gsum yangs dag tu shes pa). The fourth aspect is to train in bodhicitta repeatedly (yang yang byang sems sbyang ba), which is said to be the method needed to increase the bodhicitta ideal. This involves 1313 The ten Dharma practices (chos spyod bcu, dafodhii dharmacaritam) include: (1) transcri­bing the teachings (lekhanii, yi ge 'bri), (2) making offerings (piijanii, mchod'), (3) practicing genero­sity (diina, sbyin pa), (4) listening to the teachings (§rava�ia, nyan), (5) reading them (viicana, klog), memorizing and internalizing them (udgraha, len pa), teaching them [to others] (prakiifanii, 'chad'), reciting them (sviidhyiiya, kha ton byed pa), contemplating and understanding them (cintanii, sems pa), and cultivating them through meditation (bhiivanii, sgom pa). This well-known set of practices is, for example, taught in the fifth chapter of the Indian Yogiiciira treatise Madhyiintavibhiiga (Dbus dang mtha' rnam par 'byed pa) in the following verse lines (NAGAO, 1964:63, verses V.8cd-1 0ab): saf!!yuktii dharmaca ritai[1 sii jiieyii da§abhi(1 puna(1 II V.8 !/lekhanii pfijanii diinG1!1 §rava�W'!1 viica­nodgraha(i I prakiifoniitha sviidhyiiya§ cintanii bhiivanii ca tat II V.9 II ameyapui:zyaskandhm,n hi caritan tad dasiitmakaJ?1 I (Sanskrit text based on the electronic Gretil edition).

The fifth aspect is to decide always to avoid four negative actions and always to em­brace four positive actions (dkar nag chos brgyad blang dor), which are the methods needed to avoid forgetting the bodhicitta ideal. Based on the Kasyapaparivartasiltra, the segment lays out the four negative actions: to be deceitful towards spiritual teachers and others worthy of respect, to cause regret in others where no regret is due, to speak nega­tively to a bodhisattva out of anger or dislike, and to act in deceitful ways towards sentient beings. The four positive actions to be adopted are never knowingly to tell lies even if it is done in order to save oneself, to guide sentient beings to do wholesome actions in general and to embrace the wholesome actions of the Mahayana in particular, to regard a bodhi­sattva who has properly engendered the resolve for Awakening to be a spiritual teacher like the Buddha and everywhere to speak positively about this person's good qualities, and to uphold an exalted attitude towards all sentient beings while being completely without deceit. The segment explains these actions in some detail. It ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the tenth chapter in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, on training in the aspiring resolve for Awakening.\" Detailed instruction on the topic of training in the bodhicitta of aspiration is not found elsewhere in the Dags po'i bka' 'bum corpus.

Without gomg into detailed explanations of these facets as such, the segment simply correlates the three trainings with the six perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa, >rp aramitii) of the bodhisattva path. This is done by referring to a verse from the Mahiiyiinasiitriilm71kiira. Thus, the training in higher discipline is said to encompass the perfections of generosity (sbyin pa, *diina), discipline (ts/ml khrims, *Sfla), and endurance (bzod pa, *k:jiinti); the training in higher mind (i.e., medita­tion) denotes the perfection of meditation (bsam gtan, *dhyiina); and the training in higher understanding is correlated with the perfection of insight (shes rab, *p rajiiii). The perfec­tion of drive (brtson 'grus, *vfrya) is said to pertain to all three types of training. An outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) and a siitra quotation then list the six perfections and state that these perfections are what constitute the bodhisattva's training in the applied bodhicitta . The current chapter exclusive gives a general outline of the perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa, *piiramitii) as a whole set of terms and practices, while the subsequent six chapters explain the six perfections one by one in detail. Another outline verse then lists five points under which the perfections will be explained universally in broad terms. The explanations that follow are mainly based on the Mahiiyiinasiltriilm71kiira. The first point is the precise number (grangs nges pa, *ni5citasm11khyii) of the perfec­tions being six, which is explained with reference to temporary and lasting benefits in the form of good rebirths and full Awakening. The second point is the precise sequence (go rim nges pa, *ni§citiinukrama) of the perfections, meaning that the six perfections are taught progressively based on their subtlety and difficulty . The third point (mtshan nyid, *lak:ja!w) is the defining features of the perfections, namely that they eliminate adverse factors that hinder spiritual Awakening, give rise to non-conceptual knowledge, fulfill all wishes, and develop sentient beings. The fourth point presents a series of etymologies (nges tshig, *nirukti) of the Sanskrit names of each of the perfections -i.e., generos ity (diina) and so forth -as well as of the term 'perfection' (piiramitii) itself, drawn from the Mahiiyiina­siitriilm11kiira. The fifth and final point briefly explains two possible sub-divisions (rab tu dbye ba, >rp rabheda) of each perfection, either into a sixfold manner taught in the Abhisa­mayiila1?1kiira or in a twofold way taught in the Mahiiyiinasiltriilm71kiira.

Brief explanations on the six piiramitiis as a set of six occur in just two other segments. 1317 Instead, the most frequent mention of the piiramitiis elsewhere in the corpus is when the segments speak of the Piira­mitii approach as a whole forming a distinct tenet system. Those segment then refer to this approach as the \"Piiramitii path\" (pha rol tu phyin pa'i lam), the \"Piiramitii tradition\" (pha rol tu phyin pa'i lugs), or simply as \"the Piiramitii\" (pha rol tu phyin pa). In all such cases, the Piiramitii system is invariably contrasted with the Secret Mantra approach (gsang sngags, *guhyamantra). Doxographical comparisons of this kind are, however, found no­where in the present Dags po thar rgyan treatise. Sei:ment DK.A.E.12: The segment begins (DK.A.

All six chapters are built up around the exact same internal structure with seven headings: (1) a consideration of the faults of lacking the particular piiramitii an d the benefits derived from having it (skyon yon bsam pa); (2) its basic nature (ngo bo, *svabhiiva); (3) its sub-divisions (phye ba, *p rabheda); (4) the defi­ning characteristics of each sub-type (so so'i mtshan nyid); (5) how to increase it (spel ba, *vardhana); (6) how to perfect it (dag par bya ba, *visuddha); and (7) its results ('bras bu, *phala). The first of the six perfections (pha rol tu phyin pa drug, *�at piiramitiib) is the perfec­tion of generosity (sbyin pa'i pha rol tu phyin pa, *diinapiiramitii), which is the topic of the present chapter twelve. As for the faults (skyon, *do�a) caused by lacking generosity, the segment stresses that a miser will always be reborn poor and feel dejected. Such a person is likely to be reborn as a hungry ghost (yi dags, *preta). Also, a miser is incapable of benefiting others and cannot attain spiritual Awakening. The opposite is the case for a bodhisattva who has perfected generosity. The segment provides several quotations from Indian Buddhist Sutras and treatises to illustrate these points. 1317 See segments DK.A.Ja.2 and DK.A.Ja.12, where the six piiramitiis are taught with the first piiramitii as an explanatory model for the remaining perfections. Additionally, segment DK.A.Ja.17 mentions the six piiramitiis as set in passing. 1318 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan.64a1-69bi, DK.B.E.12.68br 75a2, DK.D.Nyi.1 2.70b3-76b5, DK.S.Nyi.12.123b3-134b5, and DK.T.Nyi.12.69b-75b, NGMPP microfilm L150/5 folios 59br65a6, Rtsib ri 'i par ma vol.

The definition is here drawn from the Bodhisattvabhumi's chapter on the perfection of generosity (the Danapafala chapter). Generosity is sub-divided into the giving of alms and other material things (zang zing, *iimi�a), the giving of security (mi 'jigs pa, *abhaya), and the giving of Dharma (chos). The segment defines and explains these three in detail along with discussing improper forms of giving that are to be avoided. It here draws its instructions mainly from the Bodhi­sattvabhilmi, the Bodhicaryavatara, and the Mahiiyanasutrala171kara. This part makes up the majority of the chapter. Next, the segment teaches how to increase generosity in that the practitioner applies inner attitudes of knowledge (ye shes, *jfiana), insight (shes rab, *p rajfia), and dedication (bsngo ba, *pari(1amana). Knowledge means adopting the view that the subject, object, and action of generosity are empty, unreal, and illusion-like. Insight signifies that the act of generosity is done by the bodhisattva without any hope or expectation of reward, whether material or spiritual. Dedication denotes that the bodhisattva does not regard the positive action as his own, but instead dedicates it for the spiritual Awakening of all sentient beings and thereby makes it impersonal. The segment explains these points by drawing on passages from the Bodhisattvapifaka, the Bodhisattvabhumi, the PrajfWparamita Sm71caya­gatha, and the Ak�ayamatipariprcchasutra. How to perfect (dag par bya ba, *visuddha) the perfection of generosity is taught with reference to Santideva's Sik�asmnuccaya and the Ratnaciltj,apariprcchasutra. It is here explained that generosity has become perfected when it is thoroughly linked with an understanding of emptiness and a pure motivation of compassion. Finally, the segment ex­plains the results of the perfection of generosity, first and foremost, to consist in the attain­ment of full Awakening, and secondarily as resulting in obtaining spontaneous wealth and enjoyment and possessing the ability to help others strive for liberation and Awakening. Several scriptural passages are cited to support this point. The chapter ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the twelfth chapter in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, on the perfection of generosity.\" The Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus includes three other segments that teach the topic of generosity .1319 Each of those segments deals with particular facets of the more el aborate explanation given in the present chapter, but none of them contains a teaching that is fully comparable to the Dags po thar rgyan on this point.

The chapter is structured along the same seven points employed in the preceding chapter on generosity. Regarding the faults (skyon, *do,Ja) of lacking discipline even if the practiti oner has the good quality of generosity, the segment raises the problem that such a practitioner will be hindered by inferior rebirths in the lower realms as the karmic results of doing negative actions caused by lacking discipline and good ethics. As a consequence, it will be impos­sible for the practitioner in future lives to encounter the Dharma and practice the Buddhist path. Oppositely, the practitioner who upholds a pure discipline and ethics is ensured to obtain higher rebirths in good circumstance that will enable him or her to continue practicing the Dharma and thereby progress towards the final result of achieving buddha­hood. The segment cites several sutra passages to illustrate this point. Drawing on the Discipline Chapter (Sflapa_tala) of the Bodhisattvabhz�mi, the segment thereupon defines the basic nature (ngo bo, *svabhiiva) of discipline (tshul khrims, *Slla) as entailing four positive qualities (yon tan, *gu�ia). These are: (1) that the bodhisattva receives vows in a proper fashion from another person holding these vows, (2) that he has a pure motivation, (3) that he -by relying on the required confessional rites -restores any vow that has been broken, and ( 4) that he exerts conscientious care not to break the vows [again]. Next, the segment states and explains the three sub-types of discipline (phye ba, *p rabheda), as known from the Bodhisattvabhumi. The first is the discipline of vows (sdom pa'i tshul khrims, *saY(lvarasfla). This includes the discipline encoded in the seven sets of Priitimok,Ja vows as well as a series of negative actions that bodhisattvas generally have to avoid, as taught in Santideva's Sik,Jiisamuccaya, the Akasagarbhasi\"\"itra, the Bodhisattva­bhumi, and the Sa1!1varavi1?15aka. The second type is the discipline of gathering beneficial actions (dge ba 'i chos sdud pa 'i tshul khrims, *kufoladhannasm!1griihakary1 sflam), which is presented with a lengthy quotation from the pertinent passage of the Bodhisattvabhumi's Sllapa_tala chapter. The third type is the discipline of acting for the benefit of sentient beings (sems can gyi don byed pa'i tshul khrims, *sattviirthakriyiisfla). Again, the segment cites the Bodhisattvabhumi and adds to this an explanation of how the bodhisattva should learn to identify and avoid impure motivations and foster pure motivations in all activities of body, speech, and mind. For the latter teaching, the segment cites several sutra scriptures. The chapter ends by briefly explaining the points of how to increase and perfect disci­pline, along with stating the temporary and ultimate results of discipline. These topics are by and large a short summary of the same instructions given in the chapter on the perfection of generosity.

Accordingly, the corpus does not contain any comparable exposition of the perfection of discipline.

The chapter exhibits the same internal structure in seven points as found in the preceding chapters. The main fault (skyon, *do�a) of lacking endurance an d patience is said to be the poten­tial destruction of all accumulated beneficial actions of generosity and worship along with the friendships formed thereby, given that a single outburst of anger can destroy the entire basis for all of these. It therefore constitutes a major potential setback on the bodhisattva's spiritual path. Oppositely, the good quality (yon tan, *gu7Ja) of possessing endurance and patience is said to involve happiness, satisfaction, and steady spiritual progress. The basic nature (ngo bo, *svabhiiva) of endurance (bzad pa, *k�iinti) is taught through the definition given in the K�iintipafala chapter of the Bodhisattvablnl mi. There, endurance is defined as an attitude of pure compassion, free from any hope of reward, which patiently bears with and forgives any wrongdoing by someone else. Next, the segment sub-divides (phye ba, *p rabheda) endurance into three types and explains these at length. The types are the same categories taught in the Bodhisattvabhitmi, namely ( 1) the endurance of patiently bearing wrongdoings inflicted by others (gzhan gnod pa byed pa la ji mi snyam pa'i bzod pa, '1'pariipakiiramar�a�1iik�iinti); (2) the endurance of accepting sufferings (sdug bsngal dang du Zen pa'i bzod pa, *du(ikhiidhiviisaniik�iinti); and (3) the endurance of resolving to comprehend the Dharma (chos la nges par sems pa la mos pa 'i bzod pa, *dharmanidhyiiniidhimok�ak�iinti).

There are two larger segments in the Manifold Sayings that are concerned with identifying and uprooting faults and hypocrisies in the practitioner, and both these passages touch on the need for cultiva­ting patience and forgiveness and avoiding anger.1323 Otherwise, the only other context in which patience is raised is when discussing the qualities required in a good spiritual teacher (dge ba'i bshes gnyen, *kalyii!iamitra), namely that the teacher must have sufficient patience to deal with the questions and queries of his students.1324 Segment DK.A.E.15: The segment begins (DK.A.E.15.83b6): /!b rtson 'grus kyi pha rol du phyin pa la/ sdom nil.

The fault of lacking drive is said to be failure in developing qualities and benefiting others. Oppositely, it is with drive that the bodhisattva reaches the far shore of full Awa­kening. Drive is then defined as enthusiasm for what is wholesome (dge ba la spro ba, *kufolam utsiiha!i) and it is said to counteract three forms of laziness (le lo, *kusfda), which the segment explains in detail. Next, three sub-types of drive are laid out, namely the armor­[like] drive (go cha'i brtson 'grus, *saYJiniihavfrya), the drive of engagement (sbyor ba'i brtson 'g rus, *p rayogavfrya), and insatiable drive (chog par mi 'dzin pa'i brtson 'grus, *asaiJ1tu�favfrya). These three forms are explained in detail with quotations from several siltras and sastras. The segment then outlines the increase and perfection of drive along with its temporary and ultimate results, along the same lines as in the preceding chapters.

This is segment DK.A.Ca.6, which lists and explains the same three forms of drive as found in the present chapter, viz. the armor-like drive, the drive of engagement, and the insatiable drive. There is only a minor variation in the Tibetan name for the third type with no semantic difference, given that segment DK.A.Ca.6 calls it chog mi shes pa 'i brtson 'grus while the present segment calls it chog mi 'dzin pa'i brtson 'grus. Neither segment identifies the textual source for this threefold division, but it is notable that it differs from the threefold grouping of drive that is commonly seen in Indian Yo gaciira treatises, including the Bodhisattvablnlmi. In the latter text, drive is divided into the armor-[like] drive (smJmiihavfrya, go cha 'i brtson 'grus ), the drive for gathering bene­ficial qualities (ku5aladharmasm71griihakm?1 [vfryam], dge ba'i phyogs kyi chos sdud pa), and the drive devoted to acting for the benefit of sentient beings (sattvarthakriyayai [vfryam], sems can gyi don bya ba).1328 The manner of sub-dividing drive that is shared between segment DK.A.Ca.6 and the Dags po thar rgyan would seem to point to a common textual or oral source for these two parts of the corpus.

It contains the same seven points as the preceding chapters, but the present chapter is considerably more subs tantive. The faults (skyon, *do�a) of not practicing meditation is that the aspiring bodhisattva too easily gets drawn into distractions (rnam par g.yeng ba, *vik�epa) and as a result will suffer from afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, *klefo). Also, he will neither be able to give rise spiritual understanding (shes rab, *p rajiia) nor to spiritual powers and clairvoyance (mngon 1326 Following the chapter colophon, xylograph DK.B has a short carver's colophon inserted into the text at this point, pertaining to the wood carving of the xylograph.

Conversely, the practitioner who has become accomplished in meditation is free from such problems and fosters those good qualities (yon tan, *gu�ia). The basic nature (ngo bo, *svabhava) of meditation is explained through the definition of meditation given in the Dhyiinapa_tala chapter of the Bodhisattvabhumi, namely to restthe mind (sems gnas pa, *cittasthiti) with one-pointedness (sems rtse gcig pa, *cittaika­grya) on what is beneficial (dge ba, *ku§ala). At this point, the segment enters into a very detailed explanation of how to overcome distractions (rnam par g.yeng ba, *vik�epa), given that skill in meditation is said to depend on overcoming the distractions that hinder meditative abs orption. It seems that this lengthy instruction falls outside the general seven-point structure seen in all the paramita chapters in the text. The additional teaching draws mainly on Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara, but also has excerpts from the Abhidharmako§a and several Mahayana sutras. The overcoming of distraction is equaled with isolation (dben pa, *p ravivekya). It is by isolating the body from social relations and enjoyable things ('du 'dzi, *sm?isarga or *ami�a) and by isolating the mind from conceptuality (rnam par rtog pa, *vikalpa) that the meditator enters into non-conceptuality (rnam par mi rtog pa, *nirvikalpa). Relations to people and enjoyable things ('du 'dzi, *sm?isarga) are defined as the distractions found in children, spouse, friends, relatives, followers, and possessions. The distraction of these things is rooted in attachment (chags pa, *saizga). The segment then presents the negativity of such attachment to material things, people, and good reputation by citing several sutra passages. Isolation (dben pa, *p ravivekya) is defined as being free from relations to people and things ('du 'dzi) and it is said to arise from dwelling alone in the wilderness (gcig pur dgon par gnas pa). The wilderness (dgon pa, *ara�iya) is, for example, a cremation ground, a forest, an open plain, or some other form on uninhabited area. The segment here lists at length the many advantages that the meditator gains from dwelling with focused mind in meditation retreat in such places. Further, the meditator needs to isolate the mind from thoughts and conceptuality. In this regard, the segment instructs how the retreatant should contemplate the fundamental need for refraining from all further involvement in saJJisara with the outer and inner movements of body, speech, an d mind, wholly abandoning physical negative actions, idle and foolish speech, as well as all emotional states tainted by afflictions. Once the practitioner has entered wholeheartedly into retreat and there overcomes all distractions, he becomes able to enter into deep meditative absorption (bsam gtan, *dhyana). He then needs to train therein continuously. To do so, it is important that the meditator applies the right contemplative remedy (gnyen po, *p ratipak�a). The segment lists six different remedies whose applications depend on the practitioner's specific tempe­rament. 1330 The remedy against sexual desire ('dad chags, *raga) is meditation on unattrac-1330 These six remedies partly correspond to the five foci purifying the practitioner's temperament (caritavifodhanam iilambanam, spyad pa rnam par sbyong ba'i dmigs pa) taught in the second Yo gasthiina of the Sravakabhiimi.

The remedy against anger and hatred (zhe sdang, *dve�a) is meditation on kindness and friendliness (hymns pa sgom pa, *maitrf­bhiivanii). The remedy against deludedness and stupidity (gti mug, *moha) is meditation on causality and dependent arising (rten 'brel sgom pa, *idm71pratyayiipratftyasamutpiida­bhiivanii). The remedy against jealousy and envy (phrag dog, *fr�yii) is meditation on the similarity of self and others (bdag gzhan mnyam pa sgom pa). The remedy against pride and conceit (nga rgyal, *miina) is meditation on exchanging oneself for others (bdag bzhan rj e ba sgom pa). The remedy against a temperament with equal measures of the different afflictive emotions or against a state of mind disturbed by many thoughts is meditation on the breathing (rlung sgom pa, *iiniipiinabhiivanii). The segment lays out each of these meditation techniques in brief. In particular, the segment gives a detailed teaching on the links of dependent arising (rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba, '\"p ratftyasamutpiida) in its outer and inner forms. At the end of the explanation, the segment states that aside from such remedies, there also exist other meditation techniques which neither involve rejecting, following, or transforming the afflictive emo­tions. These are the techniques of the Secret Mantra tradition (gsang sngags kyi lugs), being the instructions taught in the tradition transmitted by Mar pa and his disciples (mar pa yab sras kyi phyag srol dang bzhed pa), the instructions on the yoga of the co-emergent (lhan cig skyes sbyor, *sahajayoga), and the instructions on the six doctrines of Nampa (dpal n'a ro pa'i chos drug). After this extensive digression, the segment returns to the general seven-point exposition of piiramitii of meditation. Regarding the sub-divisions (phye ba, *p rabheda) of meditation, the segment enumerates and explains three kinds of motivation for practicing meditation, which have been taught in the Dhyiinapa_tala chapter of the Bodhisattvabhilmi: (1) medita­ting for the sake of remaining happy in the present life (mthong ba'i chos la bde bar gnas pa'i bsam gtan, *dntadharmasukhavihiiriiya dhyiinam); (2) meditating for the sake of building up good qualities (yon tan sgrub pa'i bsam gtan, *git(Wnirhiiriiya dhyiinam); and (3) meditating for the sake of acting for the benefit of sentient beings (sems can gyi don byed pa'i bsam gtan, *sattviirthakriyiiyai dhyiinam). The chapter ends by briefly outlining the way of increasing and perfecting meditation, and states the temporary and ultimate results to which it leads. Finally, there is the closing colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the sixteenth chapter in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Ador­ning the Precious Liberation, on the perfection of meditation.\" The perfection of meditation (bsam gtan gyi pha rol tu phyin pa, *dhyiinapiiramitii) is a topic that as such is not treated elsewhere in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum. The only context in which reference is made to the term *dhyiina (bsam gtan) is the point of warning medita­tors against becoming attached to meditative abs orption and meditative experiences. In segments voicing such warning, it is explained that the meditator can achieve the four levels of meditation concentration (bsam gtan bzhi, *catviiri dhyiiniini) but attachment"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"646 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um thereto runs the risk of leading to rebirth in the form realm (gzugs khams, *rupadhatu).1331 In the Dags po thar rgyan, the topic of giving warning is not included in the present chapter on the perfection of meditation, but is instead treated in chapter 6 on action and result (las dang 'bras bu, *karmaphala) when discussing the category of immovable actions (mi g.yo ba 'i las, *iiniffjyakarman). Moreover, the topic of ties to people and enjoyable things ('du 'dzi, *sm71sarga), which is discussed at length in the present chapter, is only raised briefly in two other segments of Dags po'i bka' 'bum corpus without any detailed analysis.1332 Segment DK.A.Kl?: The segment begins (DKA.E.17.94b4): //shes rab kyi pha rol du phyin pa la/ sdom nil. It ends (DK.A.E.17 .108b6) with the colophon: /dam chos yid bzhin gyi nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan las/ shes rab kyi pha rol du phyin pa'i le'u ste bcu bdun pa 'o//.1333 The seventeenth segment contains the treatise's large chapter on the perfection of insight (shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa, *p rajffiiparamita). Like the prece­ding chapters, the chapter's internal structure also consists of seven points, but the seven points of the present chapter differ slightly. The seven points are: (1) the fault of lacking insight and the benefit of having it; (2) the basic nature of insight; (3) its sub-divisions; (4) the defining characteristics of each sub-type; (5) what is to be known by insight (shes par bya ba, \"rjffeya); (6) its cultivation (goms par bya ba, *abhyiisa); and (7) its results. On the one hand, regarding the fault of possessing the other piiramitas but lacking the perfection of insight, the chapter underlines that it is only through insight that the bodhi­sattva attains the omniscience of a buddha. Without it, he could not lead others to Awake­ning and would be like a blind man without a guide. On the other hand, being endowed with insight, the bodhisattva has direct knowledge of reality, is liberated from sm!isiira, and can lead others to full Awakening, just like a seeing person can guide those who are blind. The segment also stresses the need for developing the first five piiramitas in unison with insight, while avoiding to develop just one without the other. Insight without generosity, etc., brings no benefit to others, whereas generosity, etc., without insight remains stuck in sm71siira. The proper combination of these qualities is compared to the working together of feet and eyes that is needed when going somewhere. 1331 The passages on this topic that explicitly include the term bsam gtan are segments DK.A.Tsa.7, DK.A.Tsa.9, DK.A.Zha.6, DK.A.Ra.l, DK.A.Sa.3, DK.A.A.3, DK.A.A.6, DK.A.Chi.I, and DK.A.E.6.

The first type is mundane knowledge ('jig rten pa'i shes rab, *laukiklpraj fiii), designating learning in medicine, logic, language, and crafts. The second type is lower supramundane insight ('.jig rten las 'das pa dman pa 'i shes rab, *lokottarii nihlnaprajfiii), referring to in­sight into the nature of the aggregates attained by friivakas and pratyekabuddhas. The third type is higher supramundane insight ('jig rten las 'das pa chen po'i shes rab, *lokottarii mahiiprajfiii), being the insight into the emptiness of reality (stong pa nyid, *sunyatii) attained by Awakened bodhisattvas and buddhas. Starting from the segment's fifth point onwards, the chapter deviates from the internal seven-point structure seen in the preceding chapters. The fifth point, which makes up the most substantial part of the chapter, is a philosophical exposition of insight's object of knowledge, i.e., what is to be understood by the bodhisattva's higher insight into reality (shes rab shes par bya ba). The exposition is divided into six sub-topics. The first sub-topic is a refutation of existence (dngos par 'dzin pa dgag pa, *bhava­griihakaprati�edha). The segment here introduces the two kinds of Self or essence (bdag, *iitman), namely an individual self (gang zag gi bdag) and a substantial essence in pheno­mena (chos kyi bdag). To refute the existence of an individual Self and establish the essencelessness of the individual (gang zag gi bdag med, *p udgalanairiitmya), the segment relies on Nagarjuna's Ratniivall (Rin chen 'phreng ba) and the Madhyamaka argument showing that a real thing cannot arise from itself (rang las skye ba), from something other (gzhan las skye ba), from both itself and other (gnyis ka las skye ba), or from any of the three times of past, present, and future (dus gsum las skye ba). The segment also lays out an alternative way of refuting the individual Self by analyzing whether the Self exists in the body (rang gi lus, *svadeha), in the mind (sems, *citta), or as a name (ming, *niiman). To refute the existence of a substantial essence in phenomena and establish the essence­lessness of phenomena (chos kyi bdag med, *dharmanairiitmya), the segment makes refe­rence to the Yogiiciira treatise Vi1?15atikii and the Lankiivatiirasiltra, as well as to Nagar­juna's Ratniival!. The argument is presented that an outer perceived object (phyi gzung ba'i yul) does not exist. The atomist views of the Va ibhiisikas and Sautriintikas are here criticized, arguing that atoms can be neither singular (gcig ma grub) nor plural (du ma ma grub). It is then argued that outer physical objects (phyi gzung ba'i yul) do not exist but everything is mind (sems tsam, *cittamiitra) and all phenomena are therefore only experi­ences (snang ba, *avabhiisa), i.e., deluded projections of the mind (sems kyi 'khrul snang). The mind which is the inner perceiver of objects (nang 'dzin pa'i sems) also does not exist (ma grub pa). A refutation of the existence of the mind is presented in reliance on Nagar-1334 For the full definition given in the Abidhidharmasamuccaya and a comparison to similar definitions in other Indian Abhidhanna and Yogacara works, see Jowita KRAMER (2013: 1003)."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"648 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum juna's Ratnavalf, giving the argument that an independent, indivisible moment of mind (skad cig, *k�a!ia) cannot be established. It is then explained that the practitioner needs to search for the mind (btsal) to investi­gate whether the mind abides (gnas pa) outside of the body, within it, or between the two.The meditator looks to see whether the mind possesses any defining characteristic, such as a shape (gzugs) or color (kha dog). Not finding any real object that can be identified, the meditator understands that the seeker itself is unidentifiable, beyond thoughts and words. A series of quotations from Mahayana siltras and Santideva's Bodhicaryavatara are then given to support this point. A quotation is also given from Tailopa. Finally, it is concluded that since a perceived object does not really exist, a perceiving mind also does not exist. This constitutes the transcendence of knowledge and knower. The second sub-topic is a short refutation of non-existence (dngos med du 'dzin pa dgag pa, *abhavagrahakaprati�edha). It is argued that non-existence could only be said to exist, if there were something opposite to it, namely if the two kinds of Self first existed and thereafter did not exist. Yet, since there never has been any existence, there likewise never has been any non-existence. This point is supported with quotations from Saraha, the Lankavatarasutra, and Nagarjuna's Ratnavalf. The third sub-topic lays out the faults of believing in non-existence (med par 'dzin pa'i skyon). Through a series of scriptural quotations and passages from Nagarjuna' s Mula­madhyamakakarika and Ratnavalf, it is argued that belief in non-existence is very negative, because it amounts to a highly destructive kind of nihilism. The fourth sub-topic discusses the faults of believing in both existence and non­existence ('dzin pa gnyis char gyi skyon). It is argued that both types of belief are ignorant, since belief in existence is eternalism (rtag pa'i mtha}, while belief in non-existence is nihilism (chad pa'i mtha). The point is supported with a verse from Nagarjuna's Ratnavalf. The fifth sub-topic is a short presentation of the path leading to liberation (grol bar 'gyur ba 'i lam), which is the Middle Path (dbu ma 'i lam, *madhyama pratipad). The value and meaning of this path is highlighted through a series of scriptural quotations. The sixth sub-topic presents the nature of liberation, which is nirva!w (grol ba'i rang bzhin mya ngan las 'das pa). This point takes the form of a little discussion of whether nir­va!w should be seen as being exi stent or non-existent. It is concluded that nirva!w is neither, but that it is beyond concepts and verbalization. Reference is here made to several Madhya­maka treatises and Mahayana sutras. Having concluded the extensive presentation in six sub-topics of what is to be known by insight (shes par bya ba), the chapter returns to its overall sevenfold structure. The sixth point in this structure is the cultivation (goms par bya ba, *abhyasa) of insight. The cultivation is said to consist of four steps. The first is a preparatory stage (sngon 'gro, *p urvalJigama), where the mind comes to ascertain its real nature (sems rnal du dbab pa). Following a short quotation from a Prajiiaparamita scripture describing the general proce­dure of meditation, the segment states that this is called the preparation for Mahamudra (phyag rgya chen po'i sngon 'gro). By here using the term Mahamudra for the first time in"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 649 the treatise, the text clearly indicates that the following explanations on the cultivation of insight are linked with Bsod nams rin chen's Mahtimudrti teachings. The second step in the cultivation of insight is the practice of meditative abs orption (mnyam bzhag, *samahita). This practice is here to be done in accordance with the tradition of Mahtimudrti instruction (phyag rgya chen po'i khrid lugs). The meditator should settle the mind effortlessly without conceiving of anything existing, not existing, something to be developed, or something to be removed (yod med blang dor ci la yang mi sems par 'bad rtsol dang bral bar bzhag go). Following this very concise instruction, the segment autho­rizes the mentioned procedure by giving a longer series of quotations from Indian teachers who are traditionally associated with the Mahiimudra lineage, including Tailopa, Nagarjuna, *Sabari (ri khrod dbang phyug), and Saraha. This is followed by more quotations from other teachers and scriptures, such as Ati8a, VagISvara, and the Prajfiiipiiramitti siitras. It should be noted that the mere brief attention given here to stating actual instructions for Mahtimudrti meditation with a lot more emphasis put on providing authoritative quotations from Indian works that verify this method as being correct and authentic in the view of the Indian tradition seems almost apologetic. It thus differs starkly from other parts of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus where no such sentiment is seen, and it might indeed be indicative of a relatively late date for the Mahtimudrti part of the Dags po thar rgyan treatise. In other words, the passage would seem to have been written at a time after critiques of Bka' brgyud Mahtimudrti had been raised by masters of other Tibetan traditions, such as the critique written by Sa skya Pai:i<;li ta in his Sdom gsum rah dbye. The defensive tone of the explanations given here are, in fact, completely in line and character with Tibetan Mahtimudrti writings of the 151h-l61h centuries, which usually include long self­justifying passages intended to prove the correctness and Indian roots of the Mahamudrti contemplative system by furnishing numerous scriptural quotations. The third step in the cultivation of insight is the so-called ensuing attainment (rjes thob, *pr�fhalabdha), referring to the phase of daily life following after a session of meditative abs orption. It is said that the meditator will come to see everything as hallucinatory and illusion-like (sgyu ma lta bu, *mtiyopama) and that the practitioner from within this awareness should put great effort in accumulating beneficial actions (bsod nams, *p w;ya), for example by performing deeds of generosity (sbyin pa, *dtina), etc. This explanation is supported with quotations from the Prajfitiptiramittisarricayagiithti and the Samtidhiriija­siitra. It is further said that when the practitioner has fully cultivated (goms pa) insight, the two phases of meditative absorption and ensuing attainment (mnyam rj es gnyis) become indistinguishable (tha mi dad du 'gyur), which renders the practitioner to be completely without any self-aggrandizement (rlom sems dang bral bar 'gyur, *manytipagata). The segment then sets off with a series of scriptural quotations praising the great benefit and merit found in such genuine practice and realization. It also extolls how all forms of Buddhist practice are subsumed within it, including the taking of refuge, engendering the"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"650 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um resolve for Awakening, practicing the Generation Stage of Secret Mantra, making offerings,and performing the six perfections of generosity and so forth.1335 The fourth and final point taught in the context of the cultivation of insight is an expla­nation of the signs indicating the complete cultivation of insight (goms rtags). These signs include exerting great care and conscientiousness with all that is beneficial, an inner weak­ening of the afflictive emotions, the feeling of compassion for sentient beings, a sustained wish to put great effort in practicing the Dharma, a natural inclination to stay away from all distractions, and being without feelings of attachment or desire for the things and affairs of this life. The explanation is supported with a quotation from Nagarjuna's Ratnavall. Having thus taught how to cultivate insight, the segment turns to the final point of its sevenfold structure, namely the results of insight ('bras bu, zphala). The ultimate result (mthar thug, *ni�,tha) is the attainment of complete Awakening and buddhahood. The immediate result (gnas skabs, *avastha) is that everything good and positive takes place. The segment ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the seventeenth chapter in The Wish-Fulfi lling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, on the perfection of insight.\" The term 'insight' (shes rab, zp rajiia) is clearly of paramount importance for all the mystical practices taught throughout the whole Dags po 'i bka ' 'bum corpus, because it pops up repeatedly in a great number of different contexts. There are numerous passages that 1335 David P. JACKSON (1994:20-24) has discussed this passage, arguing that the statement that all forms of Buddhist practice are subsumed within the the perfection of insight implies a 'simultaneist' viewpoint (cig car ba) and that all the foregoing gradualist teachings (rim gyis pa) were only intended for the spiritually ill-equipped. Also, JACKSON argued (ibid.) that some of the scriptures quoted in this part of the text originated as apocryphal Chinese Buddhist texts, and that there is simi­lar reliance on some these scriptural passages in medieval Chinese Chan Buddhist works as well as in medieval Tibetan Rdzogs chen texts. It should though be noted that the Dags po thar rgyan passage in question actually does not employ the terms 'instantaneous' (cig car ba) and 'gradualist' (rim gyis pa), and that JACKSON consequently reads his interpretation into the passage, which there­fore remains just one possible way of interpreting the meaning. Regarding the citations of apocryphal scriptures, JACKSON (1994:24) rightly raises the problem of the textual transmission of these texts in Tibet: \"The presence of these quotes does, however, raise several questions: Where did sGam-po-pa receive these traditions from? Did he have direct access to Chinese materials that had been suppressed in the late 81h century? Or did he merely learn them from some intermediate source, such as from the writings of one of the early Tibetan Ch'an-influenced \"simultaneist\" (cig car ba) traditions such as are recorded in the bSam gtan mig sgron of gNubs Sangs-rgyas-ye-shes? It seems unlikely that he would have come upon them merely through a random reading of Sutras.\" JACKSON does not answer these questions in his book and the task of finding pertinent information therefore still remains. It should though be noted that the questions need to be considered while keeping firmly in mind that the Dags po thar rgyan's many quotations almost certainly do not date from the time of Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, but either are likely to have been inserted into an original smaller version of the work at a later stage of transmission, or the Dags po thar rgyan as a whole should be seen as being a later composition that was not authored by Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen."},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 651 simply mention insight briefly in passing, in some cases adding a few words of definition or clarification.1336 Moreover, belonging to the triad o f the three trainings (bslab pa gswn, * tisra(1 sik�iif1), insight is in a few passages briefly explained as the training in higher insight (!hag pa shes rab, *adhiprajiia) when these trainings are laid out in the context of discus­sing the three sets of vows (sdom gsum). 1337 Insight also occurs as part of the binary set ofthe two armors (go cha gnyis, *dvayasm7miiha), consisting of the armor of the view (lta ba 'igo cha) and the armor of insight (shes rab kyi go cha).1338 Further, insight is a frequent component of Tantric symbolism, given that it is the quality associated with the left side­channel as well as with the third Tantric empowerment called the insight-knowledge em­powerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang, *prajiiiijfiiiniibhi�eka).1339 There are also instances that speak of insight as a separate path, sometimes called \"the insight path\" (shes rab kyi lam), as opposed to the Tantric \"method path\" (thabs kyi lam).1340 Yet, none of these many passages provides any detailed exposition of the perfection of insight (shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa, \"\"p rajfiiipiiramitii) as found in the present chapter.

In the overall structure of the work, these explanations still belong to the text's exposition of bodhicitta, in that the path and levels are taught within the framework of what needs to be practiced in terms of the applied bodhi­citta. In other words, the current and the following chapters of the text analyze how the six perfections are pragmatically to be cultivated and perfected throughout in the course of various spiritual stages. More specifically, the eighteenth chapter contains an exposition of the Buddhist path (lam gyi rnam par bzhag pa, *margavyavasthana), laying out the structure of the five paths (lam lnga, *p aifcamarga). It begins by first correlating its explanation thereon with the treatment of the same topic found in Atifa's Bodhipathapradzpa. The first of the five paths is the path of accumulation (tshogs lam, *saryibharamarga). On this path, the practitioner, who possesses the Mahayana predisposition (rigs, *gotra), engenders the resolve for Awakening, receives teachings, and practices the Dharma until he reaches the stage of knowledge called 'heat' (drod). The segment briefly indicates the four internal stages of the path of accumulation, the reason for its name, and how it relates to the first twelve of the 37 factors of Awakening (byang chub kyi phyogs kyi chos, *bodhipak�ya dharma(1). The second is the path of preparation (sbyor lam, *p rayogamarga). Here, the practi­tioner undergoes successively deeper stages of meditative insights into the nature of reality though without yet achieving a complete direct realization. These are meditative experi­ences that still belong to the category of tranquility meditation (zhi gnas, *samatha). The explanation covers the four internal stages of the path, the reason for its name, and how it includes the five powers (dbang po lnga, *paifcendriya) from among the 37 factors of Awakening. The third is the path of seeing (mthong lam, *darfonamarga). This level entails the direct perception of the four truths of the noble ones ( 'phags pa 'i bden pa bzhi, *catvary aryasatyani). It denotes the actualization of insight meditation (lhag mthong, *vipasyana). The segment here gives a short outline of these truths with their sixteen aspects. It also states the reason for the name of the path and mentions that it includes the seven limbs of Awakening (byang chub kyi yan lag bdun, *sapta bodhyaligani) from among the 37 factors. The fourth is the path of cultivation (sgom lam, *bhavanamarga). It includes the mun­dane path ('jig rten pa'i lam) and the supramundane path ('jig rten las 'das pa'i lam) of meditative cultivation, both of which are laid out in brief. The segment also states the reason for the path's name and that it includes the eightfold path of the noble ones ('phags pa'i lam yan lag brgyad, *arya�rango marga(1) from among the 37 factors. The fifth is the path of perfection or the path of fulfillment (mthar phyin pa 'i lam, *ni�,thagatamarga). This is the highest level that follows upon the vajra-like meditative absorption (rdo rj e !ta bu'i ting nge 'dzin). The segment shortly explains this absorption and the highest knowledge that arises from it. The segment ends with a colophon (cited in"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 653 Tibetan above): \"[This was] the eighteenth chapter in The Wish-Fulfi lling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, teaching an exposition of the path.\" Along similar lines to the exposition of the present chapter, elsewhere in the corpus segment DK.A.A.IO gives a short correlation between the five paths and the 37 factors of Awakening. A general survey of the five paths is also found in segment DK.A.Ha.14. Other segments in the corpus that deal with the topic of the paths only do so in comparison to the Secret Mantra approach or the steps of acc omplishment according to the Mahiimudrii teachings.1342 Segment DKA.E.19: The segment begins (DK.A.E.19.111 b2): //l am Inga po de dag las du yang ce na/ sdom nil.

As stated in an outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) at the beginning of the chapter, these levels include: the level of a beginner bodhisattva (las dang po pa 'i sa, *adikarmikabhumi), the level of practicing with ascertainment (mos pas spyod pa'i sa, *adhimukticaryiibhiimi), the ten bodhisattva levels (byang chub sems dp a 'i sa bcu, *dafo bodhisattvabhiimaya?1), and the level of a fully Awakened buddha (sangs rgyas kyi sa, *buddhabhiimi). After briefly outlining the beginner level and the level of practicing with ascertainment, which belong to the paths of accumulation and preparation, the segment moves into a more detai led explanation of the ten bodhisattva levels. The exposition of the bodhisattva levels starts with a general presentation (spyi'i chos). Here, the basic nature (ngo bo, *svabhiiva) of a bodhisattva level is defined as denoting the mind-stream of a bodhisattva learner who is endowed with meditation involving direct realization of the essencelessness of phenomena. Also, the term 'level' or 'ground' (sa, *bhiimi) is explained with an etymology (nges tshig, *nirukti) as meaning that which provides a basis for good qualities. A series of analogies is provided to illustrate the literal meaning of the term, and an argument is stated as to why there are ten levels. Thereupon, the segment turns to a detailed presentation (bye brag gi chos) of each bodhisattva level. Every level is here explicated in nine points, covering the topics of the level's name, an etymology of the name, what has to be prepared in order to attain it, what is developed on the given level, what is perfected, what kind of realization it entails, what is 1342 A segment explaining the five paths in relation to the Secret Mantra system is DK.A.A.8, while three segments correlate the five paths and the four yogas of Mahiimudra, viz.

With all these points taught for each of the ten levels, it is evident that the present chapter offers a rather detailed exposition of the topic at hand. Here the explanation shall only be summed up in general. The first bodhisattva is named 'the joyful' (rab tu dga' ba, *p ramuditii). The bodhisattva approaches this level by getting rid of all crookedness (gya gyu, *ku.tila) and by engaging in ten good qualities (chos bcu), namely the ten perfections in general and generos ity in particular. While resting in meditative absorption (mnyam bzhag, *samahita), the bodhi­sattva on this level for the first time attains direct realization of emptiness. This ultimate meditative quality remains the same throughout all the ensuing bodhisattva levels with no further gradations in the level of meditative realization. However, the realization is progres­sively deepened for the bodhisattva in terms the stage of ensuing attainment (rjes thob). During the ensuing attainment (rjes thob) of the first bodhisattva level, the bodhisattva perceives emptiness as being all pervading (kun tu 'gro ba), which leads to realizing the sameness (mnyam pa nyid, *samatii) of self and others. The bodhisattva overcomes 82 types of afflictive emotions and eliminates fear. Such a bodhisattva is apt to be reborn as a human monarch on the Jambudvzpa continent and will thereby inspire sentient beings to give up stinginess with his profound conduct of never-ending generosity. The second level is called 'the stainless' (dri ma med pa, *vimalii), since it is on this level that the bodhisattva perfects ethics and discipline (tshul khrims, *Sll a). The bodhi­sattva approaches this attainment by practicing all good forms of ethics and discipline. In the ensuing attainment, the bodhisattva perceives emptiness as being of highest import (mchog gi don, *agryartha) and therefore resolves deeply to strive for it in every way. The bodhisattva eliminates sixty kinds of afflictive emotions in their manifest form (mngon gyur), leaving only their seeds (sa ban, *bija) for future purification. A bodhisattva of the second level is apt to be reborn as a human monarch on three other continents and will thereby in spire sentient beings to stop doing negative actions with his good example of pure conduct. The third level is called 'the illuminating' ( 'od byed pa, *p rabhakarf), since its medita­tive absorption is very bright. The bodhisattva approaches this level through insatiable striving in studying the Dharma and teaching it to others without any hope of personal gain. On this level, the bodhisattva perfects the piiramita of endurance and patience (bzad pa, *k�anti), but he also practices the other paramitas. In the ensuing attainment, the bodhi­sattva realizes that the Dharma is the highest value since it corresponds to its cause, which is the highest reality. Accordingly, such a bodhisattva will be willing to undergo incredible difficulty for the sake of learning even a single Dharma verse. A bodhisattva of this level is apt to be reborn as a celestial king of the gods, such as Indra, whereby he will lead sentient beings away from desires. The fourth level is called 'the flaming' ( 'od 'phro ba, *arci�matf), since the flames of its knowledge consume hindrances. The bodhisattva approaches this level by going into retreat and living in solitude (dgon par gnas pa), thoroughly reducing his existence to a bare"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 655 minimum of needs, alway s being content, and strictly upholding a pure discipline. Here the bodhisattva perfects the piiramitii of drive (brtson 'grus, *vfrya) while also practicing the other piiramitiis. In the ensuing attainment, he experiences that reality is completely with­out features and possessions (yongs su 'dzin pa med pa, *aparigraha) and therefore puts a stop to all kinds of craving for things (chos la sred pa). The bodhisattva is apt to be reborn as a celestial leader of the Suyama gods of the desire realm (rab 'thab bral), thereby freeing sentient beings from wrong views. The fifth level is called 'difficult to master' (shin tu sbyang dka ' ba, *sudwjayii). The bodhisattva approaches this level by avoiding association with all householders and disturbing places that he might otherwise have gone to for the sake of selfish gain or personal benefit. On this level, the piiramitii of meditation (bsam gtan, *dhyiina) is perfected, while the bodhisattva also engages in the other piiramitiis. In the ensuing attain­ment, the bodhisattva sees that reality entails no distinct streams of being (rgyud tha dad pa) and he therefore realizes the ten kinds of sameness (mnyam pa nyid, *samatii). The bodhisattva is apt to be reborn as a celestial leader of the Tu�ita gods (dga' ldan gnas kyi lha) of the desire realm, whereby he conquers wrong views. The sixth level is named 'actualization' (mngon du gyur pa, *abhimukhf), since it is on this level that the bodhisattva fully accomplishes insight and thereby attains the non­abiding nirvii�ia. The level is approached by perfecting the six piiramitas and abandoning all hope for the limited kind of personal nirva1:1a reached by friivakas and pratyekabuddhas. The bodhisattva here perfects the piiramitii of insight (shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa, *p rajfiiipiiramitii), while also practicing the other perfections. In the ensuing attainment, he sees that reality involves neither bondage (kun nas nyon mongs pa, *sm71kle§a) nor purifi­cation (rnam par byang ba, *vyavadiina). The bodhisattva is apt to be reborn as a celestial leader of the Sunirmita gods (rab 'phrul) of the desire realm, quelling the self-conceit of beings. The seventh level is called 'far reaching' (ring du song ba, *duraligamii). It is ap­proached by overcoming all belief in a Self (bdag tu 'dzin pa, *iitmagriiha). The bodhi­sattva perfects the piiramitii of methods (thabs, *upiiya) while also practicing the other piiramitiis. The ensuing attainment is a thorough realization of non-differentiation (tha dad med pa, *avinirbhiiga). The bodhisattva is apt to be reborn as a celestial leader of the Va§avartin gods (dbang bsgyur lha) and becomes highly skilled in the realizations of the four truths of the noble ones attained by friivakas and pratyekabuddhas. The eighth level bears the name 'immovable' (mi g.yo ba, *acalii). The bodhisattva approaches it by fully knowing and understanding others' behavior through his special powers of clairvoyance (mngon shes, *abhijiia). On this level, the piiramitii of wishing prayers (smon lam, *p ra�iidhiina) is perfected while still practicing the other nine piiramitiis. In the ensuing attainment, the bodhisattva sees that all phenomena are beyond concepts and space-like (nam mkha' dang 'dra ba), and consequently feels neither fear nor anxiety. This is the attainment of the endurance (bzod pa, *k�iinti) of unborn reality , wherein there is neither increase nor decrease.

He is apt to take rebirth as the god Brahman ruling over a thousand realms, enabling him to attend to the needs ofarhats and pratyekabuddhas. The ninth level is called 'good intellect' (legs pa'i blo gros, *siidhumatf), since the bodhisattva here perfects analytical knowledge (so so yang dag par rig pa, \"\"p ratism71vit).The segment briefly enumerates the four types of analytical knowledge, namely complete knowledge of the Dharma, the meanings of its words, derivative analyses, and rhetoric. The bodhisattva approaches this level by making and fulfilling uncountable wishing prayers. The level is the perfection of the piiramitii of power (stabs, *bala). In the ensuing attain­ment, the bodhisattva masters all forms of knowledge and he is apt to take rebirth as the god Brahman ruling over a thousand world systems of a thousand realms, able to answer the questions of all beings. The tenth bodhisattva level is called 'the Dharma cloud' (chos kyi sp rin, *dharma­megha), since the bodhisattva on this level causes the Dharma to fall like a soothing rain. The level is the perfection of the piiramitii of knowledge (ye shes, *jniina). The bodhisattva has complete knowledge of the workings of action and result, and he is able to manifest himself in any form in order to fulfill the needs of beings. He is apt to take rebirth as Mahefvara, the king of all gods, thereby giving guidance to all spiritual seekers. He attains an endless number of meditative absorptions and manifests an endless stream of emanation bodies of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddha realms. To underline this point, the segment cites Candrakirti' s Madhyamakiivatara, which -it should be noted -is a text that was very rarely studied or quoted in Tibet prior to the fourteenth century. Finally, the segment explains the level of buddhahood (sangs rgyas kyi sa, *buddha­bhumi) as being the level on which both the hindrance of afflictive emotions (nyon mongs kyi sgrib pa) as well as the hindrance for knowledge (shes bya 'i sgrib pa) have been eliminated in their entirety. The bodhisattva traverses the ten bodhisattva levels throughout three uncountable aeons before finally manifesting the level of a buddha. The segment here quotes the Bodhisattvabhumi's presentation of the three uncountable aeons. The chapter ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the nineteenth chapter in The Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, teaching an exposition of the levels.\" The topic of spiritual levels in general and the ten bodhisattva levels in particular is occasionally mentioned in other parts of the corpus. 1344 Only three other segments in the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum give overall teachings on the ten bodhisattva levels and none of those instructions are as detailed as the one found here.1345 1344 For segments with passing references, see: DK.A.Cha.22, DK.A.Za. l, DK.A.A.6, DK.A.Ki.7, DK.A.Ki.21, and DK.A.Khi.20. 1345 The three segments giving more detailed surveys of the ten blnlmis are: DK.A.Cha.2, DK.A.Dza.12, and DK.A.Ha.14."},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 657 In a survey of Tibetan literature on the levels (sa) and paths (lam), Jules B. LEVINSON (1996:261) has stated that the earliest Tibetan text on this topic that he was able to identify was Sgam po pa's Dags po thar rgyan. His observation, however, seems to be based in the presupposition that the text was composed in its entirety by Sgam po pa in the mid-twelfth century , which seems highly unlikely. Moreover, LEVINSON's view has in the meantime been superseded with the publication in recent years of many newly found Tibetan medieval works on the topic, such as the two Abhisamayiilm?1kiira commentaries by Rin chen bzang po (958-1055) and Rngog Blo ldan shes rab (1059-11 09).1346 Segment DK.A.E.20: The segment begins (DK.A.E.20.12lb5): // 'bras bu rdzogs sangs rgyas kyi sku/ lz hes pa la/.

The twentieth segment then returns to the penultimate point among the overall topic headings for the treatise listed in the outline verse (sdom, *uddiina) at the beginning of the first chapter (DK.A.E. l). The penultimate topic is the result of the path ('bras bu, \"'phala), namely the state of perfect and complete buddhahood (rdzogs sangs rgyas kyi sku, *sambuddhakiiya). This topic is presented in seven points that are first enumerated in a new outline verse at the start of the twentieth chapter: the nature of buddhahood, the meaning of the word buddha, its sub-divisions into states (sku, *kiiya), their exposition, the reason for their num­bers, their general characteristics, and their special features. The nature (ngo bo, *svabhiiva) of buddhahood is the perfecti on of renunciation (spangs pa phun sum tshogs pa, *p rahii!iaSaf!Ipad) and the perfection of knowledge (ye shes phun sum tshogs pa, *jfiiinasm?1pad). The segment explains these two qualities in detail with reference to a variety of opinions regarding the nature of a buddha's knowledge stated in Indian Buddhist sources. The lengthy discussion entails differing interpretations of the complete knowledge of things as they really are (ji !ta ba mkhyen pa'i ye shes, *yathiibhitta­parijfiiina) and complete knowledge of things in their variety (Ji snyed pa mkhyen pa'i ye shes, *yiivadbhutaparijfiiina), and whether a buddha possesses only the former or both of these, given that the latter kind of knowledge is relative in nature while a buddha is ultimate. 1346 Both the mentioned commentaries were published in 2006 in vol. l of the Bka' gdams gsung 'bum phyogs bsgrigs thengs dang po (TBRC WlPD89051). 1347 Correlated passages: DK.a.Ka-Thar-rgyan.11 Oa4-116a5, DK.B.E.20.121 bs-1 28bs, DK.D.Nyi.20.1 24a4-13la4, DK.S.Nyi.20.218a4-230a5, and DK.T.Nyi.20.1 23n-130n, NGMPP microfilm Ll50/5 folios 102as-107h Rtsib ri 'i par ma vol.

Following that, a saying from the master Mi la ras pa (rje btsun mi la) is cited. According to this view, the Buddha is ultimately purely the dharmakaya and the dharmakaya is unborn and free from all conceptual proliferations (spros bral, *ni�prapaiica). Without conceptual labels being applicable, it actually cannot be said that the Buddha possesses any knowledge at all (ye shes mi mnga'o), and consequently the debate on whether the Buddha is endowed only with ultimate knowledge or also with relative knowledge is futile and beside the point. The literal meaning of the word (sgra 'i don, *§abdartha) 'buddha' is briefly outlined as meaning someone who has 'awoken' (sangs) from the sleep of ignorance (ma rig gnyid) and 'unfolded' (rgyas) a complete understanding (blo ). The sub-divisions (dbye ba, *bheda) of buddhahood are said to be threefold, namely the three buddha-bodies: the dharmakaya (clws kyi sku), the sm11blwgakaya (longs spyod rdzags pa'i sku), and the nirmd(iakaya (sprul pa'i sku). The segment gives a somewhat de­tailed presentation (rnam bzhag, *vyavasthana) of these kiiyas. Regarding the number of the three kiiyas (grang nges), it is argued that there are three, since the dharmakiiya fulfills the buddha's own benefit, whereas the two form-kayas (gzugs sku, *rupakiiya) fulfill the benefit of others, appearing respectively to partly Awakened beings who have already been purified but still need teachings as well as to ordinary beings who have not yet been purified and are in need of teachings. Next, the segment presents the individual features of each of the three kiiyas (so so'i mtshan nyid). The dhannakiiya is taught as having eight characteristics (mtshan nyid brgyad), which are explained. The segment here also cites a view of the dharmakiiya pronounced by the teacher Mi la ras pa (bla ma mi la). The sa111bhogakiiya also possesses eight characteristics, which are presented as features of the pure realms of Buddha Vairocana and other Awakened beings. The nirmii7Jakaya similarly has its own set of eight characteristics, pertaining to how buddhas manifest in the world. Finally, it is said that there are three special features (khyad par, *vise�a) that characte­rize all three kiiyas, viz. their sameness (mnyam pa'i khyad par), everlastingness (rtag pa'i khyad par), and appearance (snang ba'i khyad par). The chapter ends with a colophon (cited in Tibetan above): \"[This was] the twentieth chapter in Th e Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the True Teaching Adorning the Precious Liberation, teaching the result that is perfect buddhahood.\" The topics of buddhahood and the three buddha-bodies occur frequently throughout the Dags po'i bka ' 'b um corpus. A few segments treat the notion of buddha in general terms and discuss the relationship between the terms 'sentient being' (sems can, *sattva) and 'buddha' (sangs rgyas).1348 The buddha concept is also significant with regard to how the practitioner should view the teacher (bla ma, *guru), in that he is advised to see the teacher as the 1348 For general expositions of the term 'buddha', see segments DK.A.Ca.3, DK.A.Ca.15, DK.A.Da.l, and DK.A.Khi.2."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 659 Buddha himself. 1349 The explanatory structure of the three buddha bodies is particularly frequent in the corpus. Several segments give short explanations on the three kiiyas, most of which are shorter than the teaching provided by the Dags po thar rgyan.1350 Some of those expositions are given in accordance with the Secret Mantra approach, where the three kCiyas are employed as a spiritual path (lam, *mi'irga) or as results to be attained during the interim (bar do, *antarabhava) after death.1351 Yet, the by far most common reference to the kayas in the corpus is given in the context of identifying the nature of the mind with the dhannakiiya. Numerous of those passage are structured along the Mahiimudra teaching, wherein the co-emergent mind as such (sems nyid lhan cig skyes pa) is identified with the dhannakaya, while co-emergent experiences (snang ha lhan cig skyes pa) are said to be the light of dhannakaya .1352 It should be noted that this latter kind of teaching on the kiiyas are not found in the Dags po thar rgyan, whose presentation of the topic is more in line with Common Mahayana teachings.

The causes for these spontaneous Awakened activities are the former beneficial aspirations and actions performed while the bodhisattva was still consciously practicing the path in a conceptual manner. To illustrate how these activities function effortlessly and without conceptual, personal intent, the segment quotes a verse from the Ratnagotravibhiiga, which provides nine analo­gies for the buddha activities. The nine analogies are: (1) the multiple reflections of the king of the gods, Indra, that spontaneously appear through the heavenly palaces due to the reflective qualities of their crystal walls; (2) the celestial drum that miraculously appears in the heavens to warn the gods about their own eventual death and ultimate impermanence ; (3) a rain cloud in the summer that naturally gives water to the crops; (4) the lord of the gods, Brahman, who appears elsewhere to the other gods without actually ever leaving his own abode; (5) the warm rays of the sun that naturally make the flowers bloom and which simultaneously are reflected manifold in many pools of water; (6) a wish-fulfilling gem that has the power miraculously to grant any wish; (7) an echo that arises without intention in response to a sound; (8) the sky that encompasses and enables everything; and (9) the earth that naturally supports all and lets it grow.

It seems that Sgam po here implies the monastery of Dags Iha sgam po. The name ofthe compiler is only indicated as \"the King of Medicine\" (sman pa 'i rgyal po,*bhai�ajyarajan). While this generally is not an epithet that is specifically associated withSgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, it is notable that he is the only major physician or healer(!ha rj e) associated with this monastery. It is remarkable that the title \"King of Medicine\"(sman pa 'i rgyal po) also is a general epithet for the healing buddha (sangs rgyas sman bla, *bhai�ajyaguru). In fact, the phrase sman pa 'i rgyal po was used in that sense withreference to Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen and other gurus of the lineage in verse ten of apraise to the teachers composed by Bsod nams rin chen's elder nephew Dags po Sgomtshul.1363 It therefore seems likely that the title here is meant to denote Bsod nams rin chen. It is though quite unlikely that he would have used such a high title about himself, if Bsod nams rin chen were the author of the colophon itself. The colophon also states a specific date of the text's composition, namely the 251h lunar day of the month named Abhijit (dro zhun zla ba, i.e., the seventh Tibetan lunar month) of the male wood-tiger year (shing pho stag gi lo). Since the pertinent sixty-year cycle (rah byung) is not stated along with the name of the year, it is in principle possible for the year name to refer to any of the seven male wood-tiger years that occurred between the second sexagenary cycle during Bsod nams rin chen's life and the eighth sexagenary cycle leading up to the printing of the text in 1520. The year reference may thus denote any of the years 1134, 1194, 1254, 1314, 1374, 1434, or 1494 CE. If Bsod nams rin chen's authorship of the text is posited, the date would have to correspond to July 18, 1134 CE, when Bsod nams rin chen was 55 years old. However, as will be argued below, the text's use of a particular poetic device makes it more likely that the work was written some time after 1270. If so, it is only the latter series of male wood-tiger years that remains possible dates of composition, namely 1314, 1374, 1434, or 1494. Hence, it shall here be argued that the work should be dated as belonging to the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries. In this context, it is also worth underlining that the treatise was not included in the older Lha dbang dp al 'byor manuscript (DK.a), being a compilation that likewise is datable to the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries. The Scriptural Sunshine treatise is mystical in nature. Its central concern is to provide an overview of the path of a Buddhist mystic and in that sense it too may be regarded as a lam rim text of sorts.

The focus of the latter text is purely inward, being centered directly on the nature of its mind (sems don, *cittiirtha) and meditative ab sorption (sgom, *bhiivanii) therein. Unlike the many mystical segments in the Dags po'i bka' 'b um corpus that consist of oral sayings by the teacher (bla ma), the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od is highly literary in nature. The opening and closing parts of the text are written in high lexicon style with florid poetic devices in complex meters. The main body of the text is tightly structured along the kind of point-by-point organization (sa bead) that is typical of later Tibetan scholastic siistra treatises (bstan bcos) and commentaries ('grel pa, *vrtti). The design of the text might accordingly give rise to the expectation that its contents likewise would be intricately doctrinal in nature, appropriate for a well-educated scholar-monk with the likings of a Tibetan bookworm (a so-called dp e cha ba). Yet, surprisingly, the topic treated in the text is -as mentioned -purely contemplative and mystical. The first part of the text is a motivational piece arguing why the practitioner ought to meditate. The second part is instructional, teaching in detail how to practice deep medita­tion involving no outer form or ritual but being solely concerned with resting directly in the nature of the mind (sems kyi gnas lugs). Still, the text's approach to imparting its contemplative instruction s on mysticism differs from the other meditational texts in the corpus. The author's own writing has here been kept to an absolute minimum, for it merely consists of a series of sort headings placed at the beginning of every part of the text. Each heading is a kind of maxim, or brief statement, which in a sentence or two declares an essential point to be explained. The maxim is then followed by a long series of quotations of pertinent passages from Indian Buddhist works, whether it be sutras, siistras, tantras, dohiis, or gltis. The literary effect of such hyper­extended use of quotation is that it nestles the author's intention within a reading of trans­lated scriptures, which from the viewpoint of Tibetan Buddhists are considered original, valid, and bona fide. With the most stunning feature of the text being its extensive use of scriptural quotations, the work is comparable to the medieval European Latin genre of the florilegium, a genre term that is loosely translatable as \"a bouquet of flowers.\" European florilegia texts were medieval anthologies of scriptural excerpts drawn from the Bible or writings by the Church Fathers and Antique philosophers, arranged topically under short organizational headings. Before the days of printing and wider access to low-cost books, florilegia functioned as handy mini-libraries of scripture in limited anthological form that allowed for cost-efficient copying.1364 The commensurate use of scriptural excerpts in the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od, being a text produced in the era before the onset of xylographic printing in Tibet in the fif­teenth and sixteenth centuries, 1365 raises the question of what use the work might have had 1364 For discussion of the fforigium comparison with further bibliographical references, see KRAGH (2013b: 1379) and KRAGH (2013c: 391 ). 1365 For an outline of the history of printing in Tibet, see KRAGH (2013c:365-370), EHRHARD (2010), and SCHAEFFER (2009:90-119)."},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"666 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum as a reference archive of scripture for the Dags po tradition in general and the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus in particular between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is notable that the Bstan bcos lung gi nyi 'od is one of a triad of quotation-rich texts inthe corpus. These three works are the Mgon po zla 'od gzhon nus mdzad pa 'i tshogs chos legs mdzes ma (DK.A.Ca), the Dags po thar rgyan (DK.A.E), and the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od (DK.A. Varp). Of the ca. 1,412 quotations found throughout the entire corpus, this tri ad of texts accounts for no less than 1,099 of these quotations (78%). Among the three texts, it is the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od that has the highest number of quotations per folio, nearly double the ratio of the two other quotation-rich texts, 1366 which renders especially this compilation of prime importance for source critically analyzing the quotation patterns in the corpus. Since quotation is the very hallmark of the work, special attention has been given to the issue of scriptural sources in the below summary of the text. Regarding the use of the sunshine metaphor (nyi 'od) in both versions of the text's title, it is possible that the metaphor in this epoch was commonly associated with works dealing with the topic of Buddhist scriptures. At least, it may be noted that a thirteenth-century treatise giving a major survey of the texts of the Buddhist canon also employed the sun­shine metaphor in its title. This is the work by Bcom ldan Rig pa'i ral gri (1227-1305) entitled Sunshine on the Ornament: An Arrangement of the Teachings (Bstan pa rgyas pa rgyan gyi nyi 'od).1367 In the 1520 xylograph of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum, on the one hand, the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od has been placed as the final text in the corpus. Thus, the two lam rim texts -viz. the Dags po thar rgyan and the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od -close the corpus, as indicated by the two works' labels, e and vw7i. The labels spell the Sanskrit word evarJi, which is the opening word of every Buddhist siltra. The two syllables are often used in conjunction to indicate a pair or, as here, as closing pair. On the other hand, in the Sde dge xylograph (DK.D) along with two modem publica­tions which reflect the Sde dge arrangement, the order of the two final texts of the corpus has been reversed, so that Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od is placed as the penultimate work while the Dags po thar rgyan is the ultimate text. These publications do not use the text labels e and varJ7, but have instead designated the texts Ji and Nyi respectively. Segment DK.A.Vam.1: The segment begins (DK.A.Varp.1.lb1): In a mo gu ru/ sarvabudhabodhisatvabhya{t I sems don snying po 'i gnas lugs gsal byed lung gi nyi 'od ces bya ba sangs rgyas thams cad kyis phrin las cig tu bsdus pa'i sdom/.

As noted by the authors ( op.cit.:52), the extant manuscripts have several different variations of the title. Most of them contain the sunshine metaphor, though the text also was known as \"a flower on the ornament\" (rgyan gyi me tog); see the text's colophon in SCHAEFFER & VAN DER KUIJP (2009:277)."},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum 667 'dab stong rgyas pa'i gnyen/ lrdo rj e'i don mchog sbrang rtsi'i dpal 'dzin pa'i! dad can rkang drug dga' ba bskyed phyir bsdebs!/ I/par 'di nyid/ rje nyid kyi dbon pol sp yan snga chos kyi 1je! bsod nams lliun grub zla 'ad rgyal mtshan dpal bzang pas/ ri bo slwntir/ bka' brgyud kyi bstan pa spel ba'i bslad du par du bgyis pa'o// //yi ge 'di nyid a phyags bla 'brang nas/ /kun dga' rin chen dp on slob gum gyis bris/ /bkra shis dpal 'bar 'dzam gling brgyan du slwg// shubhm71/ manggalm71 bhavantu//.1368 Text DK.A.Vaf!l consists of just a single large segment. It is not divided into any sepa­rate sayings (gsung), teaching sessions (chos tshan), or chapters (le'u). It is a treatise that clearly exhibits authorial and textual unity in terms of its internal structure, stylistic form, and contents. Overall, the work is structured along separate points (sa bead) of explanation, which are ordered according to numbers, as is typical of later Tibetan scholastic treatises. The structure shall be laid out in the following summary of the text. The text commences with a short opening section (DK.A.Vaf!l. l b1-2a3) expressing homage (phyag 'tshal) and stating the intention to compose the work (dam bca '). Following a short single-sentence Sanskrit salutation to the guru and all buddhas and bodhisattvas, the alternative title of the work is given: \"Scriptural Sunshine Illuminating the Essential Nature that is the Meaning of the Mind\" (sems don snying po'i gnas lugs gsal byed lung gi nyi 'od). The comes an homage to feet of the bla ma, followed by two poetic verses saluting the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the teacher (bla ma). In the verse dedicated to the teacher, the author displays his poetic skill by employing a complex meter and an unusual poetic device. The verse consists of four lines (piida) with fifteen syllables (ak�ara) in each line. Each piida, in turn, consists of seven metrical units (gm:za), i.e., morae, with two syllables in each unit, plus an ultimate single syllable. The gwias exhibit the rhetorical figure that in the European tradition is known as anadiplosis, consisting in the repetition of words in successive metrical units, so that the following unit begins by repeating the final word of the preceding unit. In the Indo-Tibetan tradition of poetics, this figure of repeated concatenation is a special type of yamaka trope, namely the so-called cakraviila-yamaka, also known as SG1J1da�_ta as it is called by Dai:i�in.1369 For example, in the present verse, the Tibetan first line reads (with hyphens added to indicate gm:za units): kun-mkhyen mkhyen-rab rah-tu gsal-zhing zhing-'dir rnam-dag dag-pa 'i thugs. If the symbol 'x' indicates a non-repeated word and a capital letter A, B, C, etc. implies a repeated word-structure, the anadiplosis pattern of the given line is: A-B B-C C-D x-E E-x x-F F-x x. Given the complexity of the meter and the device, it is evident that the literary style used in the verse was drawn from a literary tradition of formal poetics (snyan ngag, *alaryikarasiistra). It is unlikely that it was modelled on indigenous Tibetan traditions of folk song or poetry. 1368 Correlated passages: DK.D.Ji.1.lb1-27a3, DK.S.Ji.l.lb1-47h and DK.T.Ji.l.lb-27n. The text is not found in DK.a, DK.B, DK.P, DK.Q, and DK.R. The text has, moreover, been published in 1550 as a separate xylograph by the printer Lha btsun rin chen mam rgyal at the Brag dkar rta so hermitage in Mang yul gung thang; for the extant copies and reproductions of that print, see fn. 492. 1369 On the cakravala-yamaka trope in Indian poetics, see SbHNEN (1995:507, type B5)."},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"668 Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'b um As noted by NEWMAN (1996:412) as well as VAN DER KUIJP (1996:393), the study of poetics really first started in Tibet with Sa skya Pai:ic,iita's (1182-1251) treatise Mkhas pa rnams 'jug pa'i sgo composed between ca. 1220 and 1230, and the subsequent Tibetan translation in the years 1267 to 1270 of Dai:ic,iin's poetic treatise Kavyadarfa (Snyan ngag me long, D4301) produced by Shong ston Rdo rje rgyal mtshan, Dpang lo tsa ba Bio gros brtan pa (1276-1342), and the Nepalese scholar Lak�mTkara (VAN DER KUIJP, 1996:395). The sm7ida�fa figure is described in Dai:ic,lin's text in verses 3.5 1 and 3.52 (SOHNEN, 1995: 507).137° Consequently, the author's use of this rather technical rhetorical device in the opening verses of the text betrays the supposed dating of text in 1134 during the life of Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, revealing instead that it is highly unlikely that the work was written prior to the translation of Dai:ic,lin's Kavyadarsa around the year 1270. As concluded above, the text's composition date in a male wood-tiger year means that it was in all likelihood composed in the 14th or 15th century , in one of the wood-tiger years of 1314, 1374, 1434, or 1494. Following the salutation verses, the author adds a third verse expressing that he is going to write (bri) this work, embodying the sunshine of the satras, tantras, sastras, and instructions (man ngag), in order to illuminate spiritual darkness in himself and others. The principal topic of the treatise is then stated (DK.A.Varµ.2a3. s ) as exclusively being the cultivation (bsgom pa, *bhavana) of the mind as such (sems nyid, *cittata), and to this end two things are to be known, namely: (1) the reasons why the practitioner needs to put the nature of the mind into practice (sems don nyams su Zen dgos pa 'i rgyu mtshan), and (2) how it is to be practiced (de la nyams su blang bar bya 'o). The entire treatise is organized around these two topics, which constitute the basic headings (sa bead) in the overall structure of the work. The first half of the treatise (DK.A.Varµ.2a6-9a6) then presents the reasons why the practitioner needs to put the nature of the mind into practice (sems don nyams su Zen dgos pa'i rgyu mtshan). The explanation thereon unfolds in the course of three sub-points. The first sub-point (1.1) (DK.A.Varµ.2a6-4a6) is an argument showing that the root of all negative and positive qualities is the mind (skyon yon thams cad kyi rtsa ba sems yin pa). This first sub-point may be explained to illustrate the general writing style that is employed throughout the whole text. The point begins by making a short statement in prose. In this case, the statement says: \"Since all negative and positive qualities along with all happiness and suffering of sa-rr1sara and nirvil7J-a are based on the mind or arise from the mind, it is the mind as such that has to be cultivated. \"1371 The statement functions as a brief maxim that is placed at the head of a sub-section of the treatise. The remainder of the sub-section then consists of a series of quotations of pertinent passages from Indian Buddhist sources, which are meant to illustrate or el aborate the given 137° For an edition, study, and translation of the third chapter of Dai)c;lin's Kiivyiidarsa, see DIMITROV (2011). 1371 DK.A.Varp.2a7: !dang po ni 'khor 'das kyi skyon yon bde sdug thams cad sems la brten pa'am/ sems las byung ba'i phyir sems nyid sgom par bya ba yin tel."},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"Chapter 5: The Dags po'i bka' 'bum maxim on the basis of authoritative Buddhis t scriptures.

The end of each quotation is clearly marked by the Tibetan quotation marker particle ces in its appropriate sandhi form . The source indications show how the work's author attributed the cited.textual passages to specific Buddhist scriptures. A thorough source critical study of the quotations against the mentioned sources would be required to verify the listed source attributions, but that task falls outside the scope of the present summary. It is notable that the treatise contains no quotation from any indigenous Tibetan Bud­dhist writing. Rather, the selected passages have either been drawn from the general body of the Tibetan Buddhist canon of Mahayana siitras, siistras, and tantras, or from the mystical writings and poems of the Indian Mahiisiddhas, who were considered particular important to the Indian heritage of the Tibetan Bka' brgyud lineage. Virtually all the identified source attributions of siitra passages quoted throughout the work belong to the Tibetan Bka' 'gyur canon. Accordingly, the author probably considered all the cited siitras to be of Indian origin, even if some of these translations, according to modern scholarship, may have originated from East Asia and have been translated into Tibetan from Chinese. 1372 As for the quoted Tantras, with the exception of a half-verse stemming from a Rdzogs chen source,1373 all the identified source attributions to Tantras stated in the entire text belong to the Gsar ma tradition of scriptures without inclusion of any Rnying ma Tantras. The text's first maxim that all positive and negative qualities derive from the mind is corroborated with quotations of seventeen scriptural passages. These include: ( 1) a long prose passage attributed to the Chos yang dag par sdud pa'i mdo;1314 (2) a short prose 1372 See fn. 1335 regarding the problem of quotations of Chinese apocryphal texts in the Dags po thar rgyan raised by David P.

This was Sgam po Bkra shis rnam rgyal (1513-1587), the seventeenth abbot, who in the second half of the sixteenth century composed a large Mahiimudrii treatise called \"Mahiimudrii Moonlight\" (Phyag chen zla ba 'i 'od zer).1425 Notably, he wrote his work after the 1520 printing of the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum at the hermitage. Following the opening sections of his text, the first chapter of the Phyag chen zla ba'i 'od zer discusses the reasons why the practiti oner needs to meditate on the nature of the mind (sems don sgom dgos pa 'i rgyu mtshan). This topic is treated under three points, viz. showing that everything is mind (chos thams cad sems su bstan pa), the problems encountered if the nature of the mind is notcultivated (sems don ma bsgoms pa'i skyon), and the good qualities obtained by cultivating [the mind] (bsgoms pa 'i yon tan).1426 It is evident that this structure is adopted directly from the first half of the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od. The latter half of the Bstan chos lung gi nyi 'od (DK.A.Varµ.9a6-26b2) then treats the treatise's second overarching topic, which is how the nature of the mind is to be practiced (de la nyams su blang bar bya 'o ). This topic is presented in three key points (2.1-3), each of which has additional sub-points. The first key point (2.1, DK.A.Varµ.9a1-15a1) is concerned with the basis that is to be ascertained by the right view (gzhi lta bas gtan la phab pa). This key point is, in turn, explained in four sub-points. The first sub-point of the ascertainment (2.1.1, DK.A.Varµ.9b1-l Oa1) instructs that all phenomena are one's own mind (chos mams rang gi sems su bstan). The maxim teaching this point says: \"All phenomena in sm?uiira and nirviil}a -those that appear to the senses as well as those that are verbalized -are [merely] one's own mind.\"1427 The pointing out instruction is then elaborated through a potpourri of thirteen scriptural passages: (1-3) three verse passages attributed to the Lang kar gshegs pa;1428 (4) a short prose passage attributed to the 'Jam dp al rnam par rol pa'i mdo;1429 (5) a verse attributed to the Phal po che'i mdo;1430 (6) a short prose sentence attributed to the Sa bcu pa'i mdo; 1431 (7-9) three verse 1425 For details of the author and the text, see fn. 97.

First, it says: \"Well, on the one hand, the above instantaneous approach (gcig car) is the method for practicing, but on the other hand the purity that ensues from having practiced is achieved gradually (rim gyis).\"1598 This argument is supported with a quotation attributed to the Lang kar gshegs pa.1599 Secondly, it states: \"Or, these two differing approaches were addressed separately to those of sharp and dull aptitude. \"1600 With this, the treatise comes to the third and final key point (2.3, DK.A.Varµ.24ar26b2) in its treatment of how the nature of the mind is to be practiced. The third key point is an explanation of the manner in which the result of the path will manifest ('bras bu mngon du byed pa'i tshul). The result is presented in two sub-points. The former sub-point (2.3.1, DK.A.Varµ. 24ar25b1) concerns when the result will ap­pear.

The system meticulously reproduces Tibetan words with inclusion of all silent letters but does not indicate their phonetic value. For instance, the name of the famous medieval author is transliterated Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen, but is pronounced Gampopa Sonam Rinchen. While Tibetan transliteration with its precise reproduction of Tibetan orthography is advantageous for Tibetan scholars, it might b e burdensome for readers lacking a working knowledge of Ti be-tan writing. Here, a helpful tool is the online converter of transliterated Tibetan words to their spoken phonetic form: www .thlib. org/reference/transliteration/phconverter.php A few minor modifications have been applied to the Extended Wylie transliteration scheme in places where it was quintessential to account for non-standard wri-ting forms used in the old manuscripts at hand. Details thereof are given in footnote s 648, 676, and 922. Moreover, the use of technical transliteration was fully avoided in the Th eoretical Preamble in order to place the methodological considerations in an interdisciplinary context of the humanities. To facilitate effective textual navigation within the Dags po'i bka ' 'bum corpus, a newreference system has been established. Thus, the reference DK.A.Tha.13 .27bs implies: The Dags po'i bka ' 'b um corpus (abbreviated DK), the Dags lha sgam po xylograph (siglum A), the text bearing the Tibetan alphabetical label Tha from among this xylograph's forty works,internal segment 13 from among that particular text's 41 segments, folio 27b (recto and verso folio-sides being indicated by the letters a and b), folio-line five. For the sigla in use, see the List of Abbreviations on page 690. Individual works from the Tibetan Buddhist canon are cited with the use of a siglum followed by a text number from a particular canon edition's catalog, which precedes a page­reference to a folio and line number. For instance, the citation D 127. l 2'4-7 refers to the Sde dge edition (siglum D), text 127 being the Samiidhi-riijasutra, folio l 2a and lines 4-7. A similar reference system is used for the Chinese Buddhist canon with the siglum T denoting the Taisha edition. For further details thereon, see likewise the List of Abbreviations. Secondary sources have been cited by stating the author name, the year of publication, and a page reference. Full bibliographical details are found in the bibliography at the end of the book. References to primary sources in Tibetan, how-ever, have been furnished with full bibliographical detail directly in the footnote where the reference occurs. For this reason, primary sources are not included in the bibliography. Additionally, in most cases, the identification code used by the Tibe-tan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC) has also been provided for Tibetan citations, allowing further consultation of bibliographical as well as historical details on the TBRC homepage (www.tbrc.org)."},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"Throughout the book, technical Buddhist terms are given in English followed by the Tibetan original word in parentheses.

In a few cases where the pertinent Tibetan sources are direct translations of Sanskrit texts supplying attested Tibetan-Sanskrit correlations, the Sanskrit term features without an asterisk (*). However, in the majority of cases where the discussed Tibetan terms are concretely derived from indigenous Tibetan works with no actual Sanskrit basis other than the Tibetan text's general use of standard Tibetan Buddhist terminology, the supplied Sanskrit term has been marked with an asterisk sign in order to highlight the hypothetical character of the linguistic correspondence.
