We have three main sources for a record of this period, they are the Lalitavistara, which originally seems to have belonged to the Sarvāstivāda sect;1 the Mahākhandaka, which is part of the Theravāda Vinayapiṭaka, and the Mahāvastu, which apparently formed the substance of the Vinaya of the Lokottaravāda sect.2 The three works cover somewhat different time spans, the first of them, the Lalitavistara (An Elaboration of the Play [of the Buddha]), ends after the first discourse has been delivered. The Mahākhandaka (The Great Chapter) continues up and till the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. The Mahāvastu (The Great Story), on the other hand, ends somewhat earlier, with the donation of the Bamboo Wood by King Bimbisāra. Embedded into these narratives there are certain teachings, which now form the earliest recorded discourses of the Buddha, and it is those that are presented here. That there were many other teachings   1 See The Lalitavistara and Sarvastivada by E. J.

Not all of the teachings exist in all three records: the Lalitavistara, for instance, breaks off after the first discourse and so there is no record of any teachings after that.4 The Mahāvastu does not know of The Instruction About Burning (Ādittapariyāya), which is recorded in the Pāḷi text, and on the other hand where the latter has only a summary of the discourse given to King Bimbisāra, the Mahāvastu records the full discourse. There are other variations, and though on the whole the Mahāvastu, which is much longer, has more detail than the Mahākhandaka, it records the second discourse as though it followed straight on after the first. However, we can see from the Pāḷi text that this is not so, but must have come about a week later; and what is recorded as the first miracle performed before Uruvelakassapa by the Pāḷi text is said to have been the last one by the Mahāvastu.   3 See the section entitled Further Attainments below for clear examples. It is for this reason the book is entitled The Earliest Recorded Discourses of the Buddha. 4 Except for a set of 44 verses, which do not form so much a discourse as a summary of some of the main points in the teaching. They are included in this collection because of their intrinsic interest."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction - 3 I have not made a detailed comparison of the texts, though such an examination would be well worthwhile and needs to be undertaken. Here however I have only occasionally pointed out some major differences and have been more concerned with providing a clear and readable rescension of the teachings, which were so important to the establishment of the new doctrine, and in spite of the variations there remains a core of teachings at the heart of these discourses which is common to all the Buddhist traditions. The first discourse deals with the Four Noble Truths; the second with the constituent parts and the doctrine of non-self; the third with the sense-spheres and the three main pollutants; and the fourth with insight into the phenomena of rising and ceasing and conditional origination. As can be seen in this short collection are found some of the most foundational and distinctive teachings of the Buddha. I have retained the narrative framework, albeit in a somewhat abbreviated form,5 because it seems to me important that these teachings were not given in abstraction, but were taught to meet and convince real individuals who were questing for the Truth. It is not an accident that the middle way was taught to the group-of-five   5 When passages have been omitted from the original texts they have been clearly marked in the text."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction - 4 former ascetics, as that answered their most important doubt, which they expressed when they first met the Buddha at Similarly, that the third discourse was addressed to fire-worshippers and showed what a real fire was is not coincidental, but was meeting them on common ground, and was intended to show how their fire-imagery can still lead them to the truth if correctly applied.

Then the Gracious One, knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the minds of those brāhmaṇas and householders, addressed the monks (saying): “The fool, monks, though he declares he has arrived at (the view of) not-self (thinks) his feelings, perceptions, (volitional) processes, or consciousness are ‘my self’; but again I do not say thus:"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Fourth Discourse - 56 ‘I am the maker here, or the one who makes, the animator, or the originator, or the one who puts (them) down, he who puts down these processes here and takes (them) up elsewhere.’ The processes arise and the processes cease, they arise with causes, and they cease with causes, with causes for the process of rebirth, [thus] monks, does the Realised One [explain] ‘self’ and ‘the one who takes up’. I declare there is a falling away and a rearising of beings. I see, monks, with my divine eye which is purified and surpasses that of (normal) men beings falling away and rearising: beautiful and ugly, well born and low born, base and excellent, I know that beings are born according to their actions, but again I do not say thus: ‘I am the maker, or the one who makes, the animator, or the activator,50 or the originator, or the one who puts (them) down, who puts down these processes here and takes (them) up elsewhere.’ The processes arise and the processes cease, they arise with causes and conditions, and they cease with causes and conditions.

So not having approached either of these two extremes, monks, the Realised One teaches the Dhamma which is a middle practice (thus): Because of ignorance there are (volitional) processes, because of (volitional) processes: consciousness, because of consciousness: mind and body, because of mind and body: the six sense spheres, because of the six sense spheres: contact, because of contact: feeling, because of feeling: craving, because of craving: attachment, because of attachment: continuation, because of continuation: birth, because of birth: old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair.
