Several questions had arisen during the retreat, and Zopa Rinpoche was kind enough to meet with me to answer them. Specifically, I was puzzled by the Eight-line Praises to Heruka and Vajrayogini, .verses that I had recited daily for decades, but whose meaning was a mystery to me. Rinpoche gave a brief answer, but said that since other people in the area also did that practice he would like to explain it to the group. I was delighted, for I hardly expected that he would offer to teach. Thus followed what Rinpoche called \"a chat about Heruka,\"· in which he explained emptiness in depth, and the Three Purifications. Only on the last day or two did he t;llk about practicc::s specific to Heruka and Vajrayogini: left side conduct and the Eight-line Praises. Later, I transcribed and edited these teachings to form this book. Although Rinpoche wanted to explaiJ?. the hand offering, time was limited, so he referred me a teaching he had given on this practice at Tushita Retreat Centre, Dharamsala, in 1990 a~d recommended that it be included in the book. I clarified questions that arose while edit-ing this book with Rinpoche in the summer of 1999. Please, this book is to be read only by those who have received ini-tiation into the Highest Yoga Tantra practices of Chakrasamvara or Vajrayogini. 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA I recommend reading it slowly, stopping to think about each para-graph. Take the opportunity to apply Rinpoche's teachings to your life right now. The text of the sadhana is written in italics, with the commentary below.

Receiving a precious human body is rare; it happens just once. This perfect human rebirth is highly meaningful. With it you can achieve the happiness of this life and whatever else you wish for. If you wish to again attain a human rebirth, you can. In addition, if you wish to have a body endowed with the eight favorable qualities, you can create its causes during your present precious human life. In The Brief Lam-rim, I Lama Tsang Khapa praised the precious human body as the best and only basis for achieving the supreme path. Therefore, it is essential that you create all i:he causes for such a body and life, without omitting any. In addition, you should try to purify any obstacles to this through cherishing the practice of confession with the four opponent powers in your everyday life. Lama Tsang Khapa said, \"I the yogi practiced this way. I request you who seek liberation to practice this way.\" Thus he emphasized that to realize the three principal aspects of the path, to attain the supreme path, and to actu-alize th.e two tantric stages and the Mahamudra clear light, you 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA should first obtain the body that has the complete characteristics and the eight qualities. In this life you have the opportunity to create the causes for each of these qualities. In this life, you can also create the cause for the perfect body that has the four Mahayana Dharma wheels, which are: 1. Living in a conducive environment where necessities for practicing the Mahayana are easily found; 2. Being under the guidance of a virtuous friend who practices and teaches the Mahayana in general and who reveals r_he Vajrayana teachings in particular; 3. Having great aspiration for the Mahayana path so that you joyfully engage in virtuous actions with your three doors; and 4. Possessing qualities of upper rebirth, for example, long life, attractive appearance, and knowledge. In order to actualize the path, it is important to have each of these good conditions. This time you have been born from the womb in the Southern Continent of this human world, with a body constituted of six ele-ments-bone, sperm, and marrow received from the father and skin, blood, and flesh received from the mother. In the six realms of cyclic existence, this human body is the only one with which you can achieve enlightenment in one brief lifetime. Thus, the human body that you have received now is unbelievably precious, because you have the foundation for practicing the path of Secret Mantra, particularly the wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness, which is the direct cause of the dharmakaya. In addition, if you wish to attain enlightenment 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MOTIVATION in the pure land of Heruka or Vajrayogini, iri Shambhala, or in other pure lands where the opportunity to practice tantra and become enlightened exists, you can create the cause with this perfect human body. Human beings in the Northern Continent live a fixed age of one thousand years. They are unbelievably wealthy and have incredible enjoyments, making it extremely difficult for them to realize that samsara is suffering in nature. Thus, it is nearly impossible for them to renounce samsaric suffering and its causes and to aspire for liberation. Lacking this deep understanding of the nature of suffering in cyclic existence, they cannot develop great compassion toward other sentient beings, and without compassion, they cannot generate bodhicitta. On the other hand, human beings of this Southern Continent see and experience all kinds of suffering and happiness. Our world, the Southern Continent, is called la-ki sa-pa, a place where the force of karma is more powerful and its effects felt more strongly and some-times sooner than in others. Thus, if we create negative karma in the early part of our life, it can be experienced later in this life. If we cre-ate good karma in the early part of our life, the result can be experi-enced later in the same life. Therefore, if we practice Dharma, the karma is very powerful; the merit we create is very powerful and can bring quick results. If we practice Dharma in the Southern Continent with this body, we can achieve realizations quickly. Because we see so much suffering-our own and that of others-we can easily generate the mind that wants to be free of samsara and our renunciation is strong. Similarly, developing strong compassion and bodhicitta is comparatively easy. Because our compassion is stronger, our bodhicitta is stronger, and thus we can quickly attain 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA the realizations of the path to enlightenment. The Southern ContinentJhas twenty-four holy places where Heruka and Vajrayogini and countless dakas and dakinis abide. Practicing the body mandala causes those innumerable dakas and dakinis in the twenty-four places to enter your body and to bless your channels, winds, drops and chakras. The minute .you do the body mandala meditation, they see you, no matter how far away they are, and quick like the mind, they enter your body to bless the channels, winds, drops, and chakras. Blessing the channels, winds, drops, and chakras makes them serviceable so that they function exactly as you visualize when you do practices such as the Six Yogas of Naropa. In that way, you can fully release, or open, the Knots in the chakras. In your meditation, you can bring the winds from the 72,000 channels in your body and the right and left channels into your central chan-nel. When the winds enter, abide, and absorb in your central channel according to the twenty-five absorptions, the drops melt. You can control the drops and move them up and down. This enables you to absorb the gross mind and actualize the subtle mind and extremely subtle mind, the clear light, and transform it into the wisdom of bliss and emptiness. In this way, you can become enlightened in this very life during this degenerate time. For all these reasons, this human body born in the Southern Continent is unbelievably precious, more precious than anything else in this world. You possess nothing comparable to this precious human body. Seeing that, you must also know that it is not sufficient to use it just to avoid rebirth in the lower realms and be reborn in the upper realms. Nor is it sufficient to achieve liberation from samsara just for yourself. You must attain full enlightenment in order to free all sentient 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MOTIVATION beings from all suffering and lead them to enlightenment. It is not just one sentient being that is continuously tortured by the three types of suffering by being under the control of karma and delusion-countless sentient beings in each realm suffer in this way. Therefore, you need to attain enlightenment quickly to be able to free them from all suffering and its cause and lead them to enlightenment as soon as possible. Countless sentient beings depend on you to liberate them from their samsaric sufferings and bring them to enlightenment. Even though limitless Buddhas and bodhisattvas exist, until certain people meet you, their problems are not solved. You see many examples of this in your life. Until certain people meet you, they do not meet the Dharma, even though numberless Buddhas and bodhisattvas abound. This shows that countless sentient beings depend on you for help, to be liberated from samsaric suffering and to attain enlightenment. You cannot ignore them. From your side, you should train yourself to be willing to suffer in the lowest, unbearable hell realm for eons equal to the number of atoms in the earth if necessary to benefit others and actualize the path to enlightenment. You should think, \"I can experi-ence this for others, even to benefit just one sentient being.\" When thinking of others, you should feel that it is totally unbearable that even one sentierlt being, your kind mother, should suffer in samsara for even a second. Then, when you consider that there is not just one but innumerable sentient beings whose minds are obscured and who are experiencing unbearable suffering in samsara, you know that you must attain enlightenment as quickly as possible. 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA THE DISADVANTAGES OF CYCLIC EXISTENCE Death is definite to happen, but the actual time of death is uncertain. You have been experiencing the general sufferings of samsara and the sufferings of the three lower realms in particular from time without beginning. Reflecting on this deeply cracks your heart: \"Even the Buddha's omniscient mind cannot see the beginning of my samsaric suffering. If I do not practice the method of liberating myself from all samsaric suffering, if I do not make an effort to free myself from sam-sara, I will have to experience the general sufferings of samsara and the suffering of the lower realms in particular again and again. I will experience without end oceans of human suffering, oceans of demigod suffering, oceans of god realm suffering, oceans of hell realm suffering, oceans of hungry ghost suffering, and oceans of animal suf-fering. My future will hold only the endless suffering that my delu-sions and karma force me to experience again and again.\" If you think like this, you will never be able to sleep. You will be unable to eat, or if you can, thinking of all the suffering to come will make you vomit. You have experienced every suffering and every pleasure in sam-sara before. There is nothing new left. You have experienced every-thing infinite times. Whatever pleasures exist in the human realm, you have experienced them all countless times during your infinite rebirths as a human. Similarly, you have experienced infinite times the sensual pleasures of the desire realm gods. By developing the con-centration that comes through renouncing the desire realm and its sense pleasures, you have been reborn in the form realm and experi-enced its peace and happiness numberless times. By generating the concentrations that come from renouncing the happiness of even the 14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MOTIVATION form realm, you have also been born limitless times in the various levels of the formless realm-infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness and the peak of samsara; by renouncing the happiness of the lower formless realm levels, you have attained the one above, finally attaining rebirth at the peak of samsara, the highest samsaric realm, countless times. But so far, you have not generated renuncia-tion for all of samsara, including the peak of samsara. When you realize full renunciation, you will enter the path to liberation and begin to actualize the true path and true cessation, but so far, this hasn't happened. Now, before death comes, you must try to liberate yourself from all of samsara. BODHICITTA Still, attaining liberation from samsara is not the ultimate meaning of your life. The ultimate goal of your life is to be useful to and benefi-cial for other sentient beings. The greatest benefit you can offer all sentient beings is to free them from all suffering and its cause and lead them to full enlightenment. To do this, you must first achieve full enlightenment yourself. Therefore, before death comes, you must not only liberate yourself from, samsara, but also attain full enlightenment for the benefit of all your kind mother sentient beings, who equal in extent the limitless sky. Your kind mother sentient beings are completely under the con-trol of past karma and delusion, and on top of that are experiencing the suffering of pain, the suffering of change-teml?orary samsaric pleasure-and pervasive compounded suffering. In addition .they are continuously creating more causes for samsara, particularly those for 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA rebirth in the lower realms, the realms of unimaginable suffering. Sentient beings spend their entire lives completely trapped in the hallucinations of the appearance of inherent existence and the con-cept grasping inherent existence as true. This solid, fixed concept is extremely hard to change or eliminate. Thus, they are completely overwhelmed by the wrong concept of inherent existence and live in hallucination twenty-four hours a day, every day of their lives, from birth until death. They live in samsara in total hallucination. In addition, they are completely overwhelmed by and under the control of other wrong concepts, such as the wrong concepts of per-manence, pleasure, and purity. The concept of permanence appre-hends impermanent phenomena as permanent. It makes sentient beings cling on to everything, thinking it will last forever. The concept of pleasure makes sentient beings believe that samsar-ic pleasure, which is only suffering in nature, is happiness. If you ana-lyze pleasurable feelings you will discover that they are unsatisfactory and suffering in nature, but to the hallucinating mind they appear as pleasurable and sentient beings believe them to be real happiness. The concept of purity makes sentient beings believe that their body, which is composed of dirty things, is pure. Trapped in this hallucination and completely overwhelmed by this wrong concept, they think their bodies are beautiful and get attached to their own and others' bodies. If you analyze you will see that before food goes inside your body, you think it is clean, but when it comes out, it is dirty. In other words, the body makes anything that goes inside it filthy. That shows that the nature of the body is impure. However, to your hallucinating mind, it appears clean and pure, and your wrong concept believes that it is so. Because of these wrong conceptions, attachment arises, and in 16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MOTIVATION dependence upon attachment, anger arises. This shows how these wrong concepts create the cause for samsara and produce suffering. This is the process through which you and all other sentient beings suffer in samsara. Even gods and human beings born in fortu-nate circumstances are not free from suffering. So, even one of your kind mother sentient beings suffering in samsara as a hell being, human, deva, and so forth is intolerable for you. Seeing sentient beings suffer in samsara for even one second is unbearable. You can't stand it at all. But it is not just one sentient being that suffers like that. Countless hell beings who are your kind mothers are suffering; countless hungry ghosts are suffering, countless animals are suffering, countless kind mother human beings are suffering, countless kind mother gods and demigods are suffering. Therefore, you must free them from all this suffering and lead them to enlightenment as quick-ly as possible. To do this most effectively, you must attain enlighten-ment as soon as you can. For that reason, listen to these Mahayana teachings on the path of Highest Yoga Tantra, the practice of mother tantra, which contains the skillful means to achieve enlightenment in the shortest possible time. Milarepa, Gyalwa Ensapa and many other yogis in the past achieved enlightenment in one brief lifetime by practicing Heruka. You are extremely fortunate to have the opportunity of practicing the path of Heruka at this time. Many great yogis traveled this path to develop their minds and attain full enlightenment quickly. Think, \"I too can do this. Therefore, to learn the method of quickly attaining enlightenment, I will listen to the teachings on the practice of Heruka and will meditate on Heruka for the benefit of all my kind mother sentient beings.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"TWO INTRODUCTION We're going to just have a chat about Heruka, not fixed teachings on the topic. Chodron asked a few questions about some aspects of the practice, so I thought that if I gave the answers to a group, more people would understand and have the opportunity of engaging in these meth-ods that enable you to attain enlightenment quickly. She asked about the meaning of the mother tantra path and the Eight-line Praises. I have not yet seen a complete commentary with a full explanation of the words of the Eight-line Praises for both Heruka arid Vajrayogini, only a part of it. Nevertheless, I thought to go over the meditation that goes with the Eight-line Praises so that you can do it when you recite them. If you know the benefits of this meditation, reciting the Praises will not be a burde~ but enjoyable, like going swimming, lying on the beach, or eating ice cream. Reciting the Praises will become very important. Many great practitioners empha-size this practice, as they do the benefits and meditation of the left-side conduct that is part of the mother tantra samaya. In addition, the hand offering is a special practice of both Heruka and Vajrayogini for rebirth in the pure land. What you do before eating food is put hot soup and momos in the palm of your hand, visualize deities on your fingers and make offering. When the food has been blessed, put it on 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUI<A your head. In this way, you don't need to buy hair cream; you use dal instead! Anyway, I'm joking. But these will be the bits and pieces of our chat about Heruka. But before proceeding with that, I want to discuss the meaning of Heruka, which is extremely profound. Then we will meditate together and after that go into the other topics. Some years ago, when I was in Spain, one of the students made an appointment for me to meet the queen. I wondered what present to give her, and it came out beneficial to offer her a large, beautiful poster of Heruka. The queen of Spain seemed delighted to receive this picture of Heruka, and I think it fit her mind. If she was pretend-ing to be very happy, that would be different, but she appeared to be happy, and asked me, \"What is the meaning of Heruka?\" I was stunned, because I never expected her to ask that. Of course, I could not.explain emptiness right away because it wouldn't mean anything to her. For her to have some feeling for emptiness, I would have to explain suffering and the evolution of samsara, the twelve links. So I started explaining the twelve links, and whatever I said, she respond-ed, \"I understand. I understand every single word.\" I'm not sure whether she was being diplomatic or if it was true. I would be very surprised if she weren't just being polite. It would be difficult to understand everything after just one explanation! She is a very kind person. The whole family is very intelligent and nice, especially her sister, who I met the next year. Her main job is to help countries in difficulty by sending medicines, food, and so on. No one in the family wears anything made from animals skin or furs. The queen dresses simply, not in official dress. I had to make an effort to think, \"This is the queen.\" Otherwise, you see her as simple, not as 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"lNTROOUCf!ON a queen.

Ru stands for the selflessness of persons, found by abandoning the self fab-ricated by the network of wrong views that cause us to perceive an inher-ently existing self of persons.

Now we'll go into the above in more depth. 24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE THREE PURIFICATIONS HE stands for the mind, which is the source of everything, and for the selflessness of phenomena, found by examining the fabricated nature of the causal mind. HE indicates the essence of the cause, the mind-the source, or origi-nator, of all. It refers to the extremely subtle mind, which always abides at your heart. This is the source of all. ''All\" means samsara-what appears to us now-and liberation, which is beyond samsara. Samsara ranges from the hell realms to the god realms, and liberation includes the full enlightenment of Buddhahood. All of this existence, all of these phenomena, arise from this extremely subtle conscious-ness. They are all manifestations of the pure and impure extremely subtle wind and mind, which are of one essence but labeled different-ly because of their different functions. The relationship of the extremely subtle wind and mind is described as \"one nature with dif-ferent isolates\" or as \"one nature, but nominally different.\" According to Highest Yoga Tantra, the extremely subtle pure or impure mind is the source, or originator, of all. these phenomena. This mind doesn't have self-existence. Its lack of self-existence is called the selflessness of phenomena. Two types of selflessness exist, the selflessness of persons and the selflessness of phenomena, which principally refers to the aggregates that are the base of the label \"I.\" Of these, HE shows the selflessness of phenomena. Ru stands for the selflessness of persons, found by abandoning the self fabricated by the network of wrong views that cause us to perceive an inherently existing self of persons. 2,5"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA Ru indicates the selflessness of persons. The person is empty of self-existence but decorated with a nee of superstitious concepts holding the person as self-existent. How do superstitious concepts holding the person as inherently existent fabricate a self?2 Here, an example from your childhood is useful. When you were learning the alphabet, for example, the letter M, first the teacher drew some lines on the blackboard. Although you saw the lines, since you hadn't yet been taught that these lines were the let-terM, since your teacher hadn't yet told you, \"This isM,\" you didn't have the appearance that this design was the letter M. You didn't have the appearance, the projection, that fabricates that this is M. This is because your mind hadn't yet labeled \"this is M\" and believed in it. Therefore, you just saw the lines but you didn't see that this is M. However, the moment your teacher said that this was M, you believed it and your mind labeled this design Jv1.. You believed that it is M and afterwards it appeared to you as M an? you saw it as M. Thus, from this example, you can see how the M came from your mind, from labeling; how the appearance of M is fabricated, or projected, on that design by your mind. In reality, M comes into existence by being merely labeled by the mind. The M that exists, the conventionally existent M, is what is merely labeled by the mind. That is the reality of how M exists; there is no other M besides this merely labeled one. However, after your mind has merely labeled M, when the M appears back to your mind it doesn't appear as if it has been merely labeled by your mind. It appears back to you as if there is something extra there, an M there that hasn't merely been labeled by your mind, an M that exists from its own side. 26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE THREE PURIFICATIONS In reality, an M that exists from the side of its base is not there. There are four lines that make up the M, but M is not on the first line, nor the second, the third, or the fourth. There is no M on any of those pieces. If you look for M, you cannot find it even on the collec-tion of the lines together. M doesn't exist on any of those lines indi-vidually, or on the collection of them arranged together in this way. The four lines that are arranged in that particular fashion are the base that is labeled M, but they are not M. Because they are the base, they are not M. The base that is labeled M and the label M3 do not exist separately, but they are different. That is, they are one in nature but they are not exactly the same-the lines are the base of the label and M is the label, that is, the labeled object. If you searched for the M and found it on those lines, the M would inherently exist. An inherently existent M is one that can be found on its base. That would mean that M existed from its own side and was not merely labeled by mind. However, when you search, you discover that this is totally false; completely untrue. There is no inherently existent M that can be found on its base. In fact, we cannot find even the merely labeled M, the M that does exist, on this design. If we can't find the merely labeled M, the one that does exist, there on the base, how can we find an inherently existent M? How can we find an M that is not merely labeled by mind there? There is no way. The M that is not merely labeled by mind does not exist, there or anywhere else. It does not exist there on that base, that design of four lines, or anywhere else away from that base. The M that appears to us as not merely labeled by mind does not exist at all.

Actually, even now, every time you write a letter of the alphabet, first you see the base, then your mind labels, for example, M. Your mind makes up the label. First you write the base-that design of lines-and due to that particular design on the paper, your mind makes up the label M. You create the idea, the name, the label M.

The enemy that you see-the person who appears so mean to you-is in your mind. What some people understand when they hear \"everything is in your mind\" may not be quite right. We are not denying the existence of external objects and people; what we are denying is that they exist in the way they appear and in the way we believe them to exist.

Thinking in this way about other things as well is useful, because they do not exist there the way they appear to exist. The way they appear to us is not the reality of how they exist. For that reason, it is helpful to meditate, '~1 these things appearing from there, these things that appear to exist on their base, are just in my mind.

What makes you apprehend things as not merely labeled by mind? Now we come to the meaning of \"self fabricated by the network of wrong views.\" This network of wrong views, or superstition, refers to the concept of inherent existence, or self-existence. Seeing other designs doesn't cause you to make up the label M. Only seeing that particular four-line design causes you to decide on the particular label M. For your mind to label M, you have to see something first, and that particular design is the reason that your mind labels M. The rea-son is the base. First you see the base, then you make up the label M. After that, you see the label. Even though the M is merely labeled by your mind, what makes you see the M there on that design, on the base? In other words, what makes the M appear and you to believe that it is not merely labeled by mind, that is, that it exists from its own side? It is the negative imprint left on your mental continuum by past ignorance, the con-cept of inherent existence.

The wisdom of great bliss not only realizes the nature of the object. It also realizes that all inherently existent objects are completely non-existent. This wisdom sees that the inherent exis-tence that appears on merely labeled phenomena is non-existent and totally empty. In addition, the wisdom of great bliss enters into emptiness in one taste, uninterrupted by even the subtle dual view, the appearance of inherent existence.

Student: You said that all the phenomena we now perceive do not exist. What does exist? Rinpoche: What exists is that which is merely labeled by the mind in dependence upon a valid base. Now, if I were to simply say, \"What exists is that which is merely labeled by the mind,\" it could create confusion. Why? Because the things we see in a dream are also merely labeled by the mind, but they don't exist. Similarly, all the objects in a hallucination don't exist either-they, too, are merely labeled by the mind. Therefore, to make it clear, we have to add the phrase \"in dependence upon a valid base\" or \"in relation to a valid base.\" This gives the complete idea. Being merely labeled by mind is not suffi-cient for something to exist. That alone does not make something exist. You need a valid base. However, a base alone is also not suffi-cient for something to exist. It has to be a valid base. For example, there can be a round red fruit, but it is not a valid base to be labeled elephant because it cannot function as an elephant.

That which does exist is extremely subtle. The proof that an object exists is that it is merely labeled by the mind in dependence upon a valid base. We have to be satisfied with that. There is nothing more there than that which is merely labeled by the mind in dependence upon a valid base, and this is sufficient for something to exist. People, actions, and objects perform functions that exist in mere name, and we can experience their effects-happi-ness or suffering. Although karma exists merely in name, we still experience happiness and suffering as the results of virtuous and non-virtuous actions respectively. Karma functions and affects our lives. For example, the tea that exists is that which has merely been labeled by the mind and it is totally empty of existing from its own side. The tea that appears as existing there, from its own side, is total-ly non-existent. Yet, the tea exists in mere name and can produce effects. When we drink it, it has an effect. If it is very delicious tea, it has a very good effect; if it is horrible tea, it has a bad effect! In this way we have the coming together of emptiness and dependent aris-ing. When you analyze and look for ultimately existing phenomena, you discover that they do not exist, but when you do not search ana-lytically for the ultimate nature of phenomena, they appear and affect our lives. So, they do exist. Student: With conceptual mind, we create this view of emptiness that is based on a philosophical system. Isn't that system ultimately non-existent conceptually? Is emptiness ultimately existent? Can we say that ultimately nothing exists, but ultimately everything exists? A geshe who 36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CoMMENTARY ON THE THREE PURIFICATIONS has realized emptiness can still stub his toe on a rock, can't he? Rinpoche: Nothing is ultimately existent, be it emptiness or the view of emptiness. If something exists, it must exist conventionally. That is the only type of existence that is possible. Thus, emptiness, like all other phenomena, exists conventionally. The fact that ultimately nothing exists means that nothing exists inherently, including empti-ness. When we think of emptiness, we have an idea of real emptiness existing from its own side. That is the refuted object. Emptiness is also merely labeled, and thus it, too, is empty. Although nothing ultimately exists, things do exist conventionally. The geshe who has realized emptiness can stub his toe on a rock if he doesn't practice mindfulness! The geshe exists and the rock exists, but neither of them exists inherently, there on their bases. What someone experiences when he stubs his toe or bangs his head depends on his level of mind. There are many different levels of realization of emptiness-those of aryas, arhats, and Buddhas. I can-not say one hundred percent, because I am not someone who has realized emptiness and then stubbed his toe on a rock, but my guess is that the mind of the person who has realized emptiness reacts differ-ently from that of the person who hasn't. The person who hasn't real-ized emptiness doesn't see the rock or his I as empty. He holds on to the rock, his body, and his I as real and existing from their own side. But the person who has developed the wisdom realizing emptiness sees everything as an illusion. That makes a big difference as to how he experiences and reacts to stubbing his toe. Gen Jampa Wangdu mentioned that according to his experience, after realizing emptiness, you don't immediately see everything as illu-sion.4 He said that once you have initially realized emptiness, if you 37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A CHAT AllOUT HERUKA meditate on emptiness strongly every day, after fifteen days you will start to see things as like an illusion, as similar to a dream. Of course, that would make a huge difference to your life, because whenever a problem happened, you would see it as an illusion, like a dream, as nothing real. For example, if someone praised you and someone else criticized you, you would not grasp what they said as real and there-fore wouldn't develop attachment to the one or aversion to the other. Student: His Holiness the Dalai Lama said that he did not begin to understand emptiness until he was thirty years old. Even now he says he hasn't realized emptiness. Of course, he is modest, hut what he said interests me. Rinpoche: His Holiness has said that although bodhicitta is extremely difficult to realize, he has strong faith in it. In Bodhgaya, and on a few other occasions, His Holiness has mentioned that the under-standing that everything is empty comes to him for short periods. He has also said that it is extremely difficult to realize emptiness. Many years ago.at Drepung Monastery, His Holiness was giving teachings on the lam-rim and the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras, and once, in between sessions, he said, \"I don't have gross delusions. The subtle defilements, t~at needs to be checked.\" This came out in a break between teachings. I'm not sure how many people noticed. This is not well known, but I thought to mention it because His Holiness has taken an ordinary aspect. That means that whatever hap-pens to ordinary people-problems, mistakes, sickness, and so forth-also happens to him.

Student: According to the meaning of HE in Highest Yoga Tantra, everything comes from the very subtle mind. Please explain this. How do tables, windows, and all these other things come from the very subtle mind? Rinpoche: According to Highest Yoga Tantra, things manifest from the pure or impure extremely subtle mind. Samsara manifests from the impure extremely subtle wind and mind. For example, in past lives, you got angry. That anger left imprints on your mental continuum. Because of that, even though you weren't angry yesterday or this morn-ing, suddenly anger arises tonight. If you don't apply the meditations to protect your mind and control anger, then when the conditions come together, anger arises. Because the imprints of anger are there on your consciousness, when you meet a particular object or person, anger arises. Anger, that gross, violent thought manifests out. In a similar way, the gross mind manifests again from the subtle mind when you go from one rebirth to the next. In past lives, you created much karma that left imprints on your mind.

When that clear light ends and your mind passes into the bardo, the intermediate state, again a more gross mind starts. What that gross mind experi-ences in the intermediate stage or in another rebirth is due to the imprints left on the mind-stream in previous lives. The gross mind absorbs into the extremely subtle mind at the time of death and again comes out of that extremely subtle mind in the next rebirth. In this way, you experience the results of past lives' karma in future lives. This is how imprints are carried from one rebirth to the next. It is not only the gross mind that carries the imprints. From the extremely subtle wind and mind at the time of death come gross wind and mind in the bardo and next rebirth. After the consciousness enters the fertilized egg, the gross mind experiences the results of the past karmic imprints. If you think about this, you will understand how everything comes from the very subtle mind. This is what I think, but it needs to be checked. I hope what I've said doesn't make it sound as if I have realized emptiness. I hope that by giving teachings I'm not opening the door into the big hells. 40"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"FOUR PRACTICING IN DAILY LIFE Rising yoga is one of the yogas that you practice in the .break time. When you get up in the morning, arise from emptiness and generate bodhicitta motivation as your attitude for living. Cultivating the motivation of love and compassion is one of the five powers taught in the section about integrating practice for an entire lifetime in The Seven Points ofThought Transformation. Think, \"From now on, until enlightenment is achieved, .until my death, especially this year, this month, this week, today, I will never allow myself to be under the control of the self-cherishing thoughi: and I will never separate from bodhicitta for even a second.

To do this, I must achieve full enlightenment mysel£ Therefore, today I will make all my activi-ties and actions virtuous.\" You can think briefly like this when you get up in the morning. Or, you can think more elaborately by meditating on the shortcom-ings of self-centeredness and the benefits of cherishing others, coming to the conclusion that you must attain enlightenment to be able to benefit all sentient beings and generating the following motivation: \"Therefore I'm going to do. all my activities of body, speech, and 41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA mind with bodhicitta motivation.\" You can then engage in virtuous actions such as prostrating, making offerings, and meditating, and normal activities such as walking, sleeping, sitting, and working, your reason for doing all of these being to attain enlightenment in order to benefit all sentient beings most effectively. There are two motivations for doing an action, one being the motivation at the time of the action (timely motivation), the other being the motivation before doing it (causal motivation). If you culti-vate bodhicitta in the morning, it becomes the causal motivation for all the activities you do from then on during that day. By training your mind with effort in bodhicitta each day, it will gradually transform into the thought to benefit others, and one day naturally, without any effort, you will be able to live your life with bodhicitta arising spon-taneously. All your daily life actions will be transformed into virtue. This was the reason for Kedrubje's praise of his guru, Lama Tsong J9lapa, \"Even your breathing in and out benefits all sentient beings.\" In the same way that you generate bodhicitta in the morning, you can also make a strong determination to meditate on emptiness. When you wake up, you can think, \"Everything, including I, action, object, and all other phenomena from form until enlightenment-hell, liberation, samsara, happiness, problems, virtue and non-virtue, and so forth-appear to the mind as real, from there. But they do not exist in the way that they appear.\" These phenomena appear to your mind as being there on the base. They are all decorated by the imprint of ignorance, fabricated, or projected, by your mind. How? Because of negative imprints left on your mental continuum by the past concept of inherent existence, all these things appear inherently existent. It's like what happens to a person whose mind is affected by 42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"PRACTICING IN DAILY LIFE disease or drugs or who is wearing blue glasses. Someone whose mind is unaffected realizes that the snow mountain is white; one with a non-defective valid cognizer sees a white snow mountain. But one whose mind is affected by drugs or disease or who is wearing blue glasses has the view of a blue snow mountain. He has that projection, that hallucination, that view of a blue snow mountain. His halluci-nating mind projects that view. In reality, no blue snow mountain exists; there is no blue color there. The teachings often give the example of a piece of rope appearing like a snake. You believe it is a snake and become terrified, when in fact there is no snake there. A woman in Singapore or Malaysia told me that once, near her house, she saw a piece of rope. She went to pick it up, but it was a snake! It was the other way around! She thought it was a rope and discovered it was a snake. Because it looked like a rope, her hallucinating mind made up the label rope. Her con-cept projected rope. Then rope appeared and she saw a rope. But the rope didn't exist anywhere at all. When you do retreat on the Heart Sutra or train your mind in emptiness daily, view things in a variety of ways so that you don't become bored with just one technique. In the morning, make the plan, ''I'm going to practice meditation on emptiness.\" Decide at that time what you are going to practice the rest of the day, or during the breaks if you are doing retreat. By the way, break time does not mean you take a break from virtue. You don't get even a second's break from samsara, so you shouldn't take even a moment's break from virtue! For the benefit of yourself and other sentient beings, you need to practice Dharma constantly-this precious human life may be the only chance you'll get. If you take rebirth in the lower realms, not only will 43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA you be overwhelmed by unimaginable suffering for an incredible length of time, but you will also have not the slightest opportunity to practice Dharma. Even future rebirth in the deva or human realms is no guarantee that you'll have the opportunity to practice Dharma. For these reasons, it is important to use every moment of your life to practice, that is, to transform your mind, as much as you possibly can. In other words, break time simply means a break from sitting meditation. Meditation practice is divided into session time and break time. The breaks are another type of meditation time. When in the morning you make a strong determination to prac-tice mindfulness of emptiness during the rest of the day, it becomes easier to do so. Maintain awareness that \"The I, action, and all phe-nomena appear as something real, there on the base, but this is all fabricated, or projected from negative imprints left on,my hallucinat-ing mind. Everything I perceive is projected by my hallucinating mind. None of it is there; it does not exist at all.\" Think of the exam-ples that I explained before. In this way, practice the mindfulness that all these things are pro-tections of your hallucinating mind and appear because of negative imprints left on your consciousness by previous ignorance. Practice this mindfulness with whatever appears in front of you right now. For example, you are looking at me and a real Lama Zopa appears from there. When you look at the flowers on the altar, real flowers appear from there. All existent objects-even the mind itself-appear as real, existing there, from the side of the base. They are all projected by your hallucinating mind because of the negative imprints that have been left on it. You do not need many words to practice this mindful-ness. The most important thing is to practice it one-pointedly. When 44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"PRACTICING IN DAILY LIFE you do, the understanding that all these things are not true will arise in your heart. You will understand that they do not exist in the way that they appear to you. They are not there. Emptiness arises in your heart. This is an extremely effective way to practice mindfulness in everyday life. Then, the next day, practice a different technique. For example, think of other beings' point of view-how they see you, how they see everything. That also helps you understand that your view is com-pletely wrong. Things appear to you and you apprehend them as one hundred percent real, just as they appear, but this is not what all the Buddhas, arhats, or arya bodhisattvas see. What they discover in meditative equipoise on the nature of reality is not this. What they discover is that all this is completely non-existent. Buddhas, arhats, and arya bodhisattv~s see that everything-!, action, and object-is totally empty of the way that it appears to your mind, totally empty of existing in the way that you believe. Those who have perceived reality directly see the total opposite of what appears to you. They see that everything is totally empty. In the view of ignorance, everything exists from its own side, but in the view of wisdom, the reality of phenome-na is emptiness. Wisdom realizes that nothing exists from its own side. Another day, practice mindfulness of things being merely labeled by mind. For example, while walking, ask yourself, \"What am I doing?\" Answer, ''I'm walking.\" Ask yourself again, \"Why do I say I'm walking?\" You will s~e that there is no reason at all other than the body is doing the action of walking. That is the only reason. Because the body is walking, your mind labels and believes, \"I'm walking.\" Thus, the I is merely labeled by mind. Here, you can see dearly that the base, the aggregates, and the label, I, are different. You see the 45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA difference between the base, the aggregates, and the label, I, very clearly, and suddenly, the label I becomes very subtle; so subtle that it seems almost non-existent. It's not that it doesn't exist, but suddenly, to your mind, it is as if it doesn't exist. You can differentiate the base, the aggregates, from the label, I, but much more than that, suddenly, for your knowledge, the label I seems like it is non-existent. It is not non-existent, but it becomes so subtle that it seems as if it is. When the limbs of the body are moving, you call it \"walking.\" The action walking is merely imputed by the mind's making up the label \"walking.\" Here again you can see clearly that the base (the limbs of the body moving) and the label (walking) are different. Similarly, certain marks on the ground indicate that some people passed that way .. In dependence upon this, your mind makes up the label \"road.\" Without those marks, there's no reason for you to make up the label \"road,\" nothing to cause your mind to make up the label \"road.\" However, when you see the base-those marks on the ground indicating that other people have gone that way-it causes your mind to make up the label \"road.\" The base and the label \"road\" are differ-en.t. Road is merely imputed by mind. Be mindful of this process with every object you encounter and every action you do throughout the day. Similarly, what causes you to make up the particular label \"tree\"? There is no reason other than your seeing that particular phenome-non tha,t has a trunk, branches and leaves and can be used to make things or burned to make fire. Seeing that particular phenomena causes your mind to make up the label \"tree,\" not \"fire,\" \"water,\" \"wind,\" or \"earth.\" You see the base, and your mind merely imputes the label \"tree\" in dependence upon it. Aside from the tree that exists 46"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PRACTICING IN DAILY LirE by being imputed in this way, no other tree exists. There is no tree existing from its own side.

But there Jis a tree at Vajrapani. In fact, there are lots of trees here! However, there is no tree stuck on the base. The tree appearing from there-the tree that cannot be differentiated from the base-is the refuted object. That is what you need to realize is empty, totally non-existent. As it is totally non-existent, you have to realize that that is how it is. In such ways, train your mind in emptiness by thinking of subtle dependent arising, how everything is merely labeled by mind. Practice awareness of this. You can choose any of these methods, depending on which you find more effective. Another way is to see the object of ignorance, the object of the concept of inherent existence, as false and empty. This applies to the I, action, object, all phenomena-anything that appears in your view. Here you practice differentiating the label from the base. You see the label-whatever phenomenon-is empty. It is not that it's non-exis-tent. It exists but it's empty; it is empty of existing from its own side. Think of the examples. After realizing that what you labeled rope is really a snake, how do you feel about that object? When you realize that it's a snake, how do you feel about the rope that you labeled before? How do you see that rope? Or use another example. After someone dies, people still talk about that person. However, that per-son does not exist.

In other words, conventionally existent phenomena appear one way-as truly existent-but they do not exist as they appear. Similarly, dream objects appear real but do not exist in the way they appear. In daily life, this mindfulness practice will help you when you face problems or difficulties. If a problem happens-for example, some-one criticizes you-look at it like a dream. What is happening isn't real. It is like having a problem in a dream. A different feeling arises in your heart; it is like someone causing you a problem in a dream but you are aware that it is a dream. How do you feel about that? How do you feel when you dream that someone is criticizing or abus-ing you, and at the same time you are aware that it is a dream, that it is .not real. It doesn't bother you. It doesn't disturb your mind or cause anger to arise. Why? Because you know it's not real. Similarly, you can practice mindfulness that this is like an illusion created by a magician. Here, the magician is your own ignorance. What is like an illusion is the I, action, object, and all other phenom-ena appearing as not merely labeled by mind but as something real, appearing from there. In reality, there is no real enemy, no real prob-lem, no real I who experiences problems.

Holding illusory appearances to be true makes you weary. Therefore, when you meet with disagreeable circumstances, See them as illusory-This is the practice of bodhisattvas. All the various sufferings and problems you have in life are like a child dying in a dream. You dreamed that you got married and had a child, and later that child died. You had a dream of your whole life; so many things happened, so many problems occurred. Even your body became old and your hair turned gray in the dream. But you didn't recognize it as a dream and instead believed it was true. As a result, you suffered so much. Even though Togme Zangpo spoke only of a child dying in the dream, he implies that your whole life with all its problems are like thirty, forty, or eighty years in a dream. It is very useful to reflect on this verse when you have problems in life, and reciting it is better than reciting a mantra, because you understand what it means. This is why it is very effective to recite a verse or a Dharma text to remind yourself of what to practice when problems arise. It changes your view of life by changing your concept. If your concept is that you are suffering or having problems, you feel miserable. If you change this concept, you have peace. All this gives you an idea of how to meditate on emptiness.

Sometimes it may seem as if you are just saying the words \"inher-ent existence\" or \"emptiness\" without much understanding of what they mean. However, even if you cannot get the exact idea of empti-ness in your meditation and it all seems like just a bunch of words, continue to meditate on emptiness by relying on and using these teachings. Since those words are unmistaken, each time you think of them, you leave a positive imprint on your mind. Even if you cannot practice precise meditation or concentration on emptiness, if you reflect on the unmistaken words, especially those of Lama Tsang Khapa's teachings, you still leave positive imprints on your mind-stream. Then, sooner or later, when the conditions of strong guru devotion, strong purification, and the collection of strong, extensive merit come together, then, one day, unexpectedly, experiences and realizations will happen.

When a problem is right in front of me, I try to remember emptiness, but the problem still seems enormous. What are some other tools I can use to counteract anger and avoid creating more negative karma? Rinpoche: If you meditate on emptiness, it doesn't help? The problem arises while you're meditating on emptiness? The problem arises while it's empty? Maybe I'm also involved in the problem! When you meditate on emptiness, the anger will stop because emptiness is a remedy for all the delusions. Why? Because it. is the antidote to ignorance, which is the foundation of all the other delu-sions. Therefore, the minute you meditate on emptiness, anger will stop. Anger arises when you believe in the false object, the false I, the false enemy-all these things that do not exist. When you believe that they are true and that they really exist, anger arises. When you medi-tate on emptiness, you look at the truth of the I, the truth of the other person, and you find that no foundation for anger exists. Thus emptiness is the most powerful antidote to the delusions. If anger arises after you have meditated on emptiness it is because there is no continuation of the meditation. Since the mindfulness of emptiness 51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA has stopped, anger can arise. First, you have to remember to use a meditation technique when you have a problem, Often the problem is forgetting to use the tech-nique. But once you remember the technique and use it, it works. If you do not remember to apply a meditation technique, the delusion will usually overwhelm you. The first technique I recommend is to think about karma. This brings you back to the fundamental philosophy of Buddhism-no creator other than your own mind exists. Buddhists do not believe in God. Buddhists do not believe that there is a creator of your life who has a separate mind from yours. This basic Buddhist tenet differenti-ates Buddhism from other religions that believe in a creator God. From the Buddhist viewpoint, no external being who creates your life exists. There is no other creator besides your own mind, your own karma. Whatever happens in your life comes from your own mind. Your aggregates (this association of body and mind, which includes your senses), the way you view objects of the senses (forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects), and the feelings that arise by the senses contacting these objects are suffering in nature. Your whole world comes from your mind because of the imprints of past karma-the positive, negative, and neutral karmic imprints left on your mind-stream. The events and experiences of your life are manifestations of those hrmic imprints. Because of karmic imprints, you now have a human body, human aggregates. Your feelings of happiness or suffer-ing are also due to the ripening of particular karmic imprints. Ulti-mately, all your experiences come from your mind. Your aggregates, your senses, your view of sense objects, and the feelings you experience through contacting them arise from karma. 52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"PRACTICING PATIENCE Karma is the mental factor of intention. Where does karma come from? From ignorance. When we speak of the twelve links of depend-ent arising, ignorance is the first. From it comes karma, and from karma come all the results you experience. All these come from your mind, not only from karma-the mental factor of intention-but also from the ignorance that is the root of samsara, the concept of an inherently existent I. This is how your happiness and suffering evolve. If your meditation on emptiness is not yet firm, then thinking about karma can be a very powerful way to stop anger. The minute you think about karma, there is no place in your mind for anger because you see there's nobody and nothing to blame. Thinking of karma is putting into practice the basic Buddhist philosophy that there is no creator other than your mind. You need to apply that philo-sophy in your life. You shouldn't just leave it as philosophy, written in a notebook that you keep on the top shelf of your bookcase, but remember and apply it in your daily life, especially when you have problems. The philosophy of karma is very effective not only to dis-cuss as a philosophy but also to use in your life to calm your mind; The moment anger arises, your mind believes in a creator. You think that someone else is creating your problem. \"The problem I'm experiencing came from that person.\" That is similar to believing in an external creator. You hold two contradictory attitudes-you talk about and believe karma and the philosophy of Buddhism, but when you encounter a difficulty in your daily life, you think that there is an external being who created it! Instead of practicing that there is no creator, you practice that there is a creator because the problem came from somebody else. \"That person created my problem.\" In daily life, you become just like practitioners of other religions; you practice that 53"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA there is a creator. Even though you do not use the word \"God,\" you believe that there is a creator, somebody else who created your prob-lem. With this as the basis, anger arises. But the minute that you think that you are the creator, that your mind is the creator, that whatever you are experiencing comes from karma you yourself have created, you know that there is nothing external to blame, so there is no basis for anger to arise. The wish to retaliate and harm someone else is based on the belief that the other person is harming you, that you are an innocent victim who has nothing to do with the problem. GENERATING COMPASSION AND THE BENEFITS OF DOING SO Thinking about karma first is powerful because it sets the foundation. On top of this, meditate on emptiness or compassion or any of the other techniques. In the sixth chapter of A Guide to the Bodhisattva's '\\.%y of Life, Shamideva said: Previously I must have caused similar harm To other sentient beings. Therefore, it is right for this harm to be returned To me who is the cause of injury to others. Thinking in this way is useful. It stops the mind that thinks that we should be able to harm others but should not receive any harm from them. That thought is very illogical. That is why Shantideva advised us to think, \"I deserve to receive this harm. That is, it is natural for me to receive· harm, because I harmed others in the past.\" In the same 54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"PRACTICING PATIENCE text, Shantideva also said: Having been instigated by my own actions, Those who cause me harm come into being. If by these (actions) they should fall into hell, Surely isn't it I who am destroying them? In other words, think, \"Who started all this? It's not the other person. I started it because my karma-the harmful actions I did in previous lives-made this happen. In the past, I mistreated this sentient being, and that made the connection for me to receive harm now. My karma has persuaded this person to harm me now. By the other person harm-ing me, he is creating negative karma, and that will cause him to take rebirth in the lower realms.\" Question yourself: \"Didn't my action insti-gate what will be a very unfortunate situation for the other person?\" Thinking like this will help you generate compassion for the other per-son, and when your mind feels compassion, there is no room for anger. In this way, you use the fact that the person is harming you to develop compassion for him. You use the problem to generate com-passion and bodhicitta for him. By generating bodhicitta, you will be able to actualize the entire Mahayana path to enlightenment, includ-ing the six paramitas, the surra path and the tantra path. You will be able to cease all the mistakes of mind, complete all realizations of the path, and attain enlightenment. Depending on this person who is harming you, you will receive all these benefits. Due to his kindness and your generating compassion for him, in the future you will be able to free all sentient beings from suffering and bring them to full enlightenment. Being able to offer such incredible benefit to all 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA sentient beings in the hltu're is due to the kindness of this person. By his harming you, he causes you to generate compassion, which is the root of the Mahayana path. You can also think, \"This person is so preCious and kind because due to him I can receive all the benefits of practicing patience. Developing compassion for this one sentient being now will enable me to generate compassion for all sentient beings later.\" This person is so kind and precious because he is helping you to stop harming all sentient beings and have compassion for them. By your ceasing to harm them and benefiting them instead, sentient beings will receive much peace and happiness. The opportunity for you to offer all this peace and happiness to all sentient beings comes from this one person who gave you the chance to practice patience. The Dharma contains many different ways of thinking to coun-teract anger. We have already discussed thinking of karma, cultivating compassion, and remembering the benefits of practicing patience. There are others as well. You should apply the ways that are most effective for your mind. In The Door of Liberation, Geshe Wangyal translated into English a collection of advice from the Kadampa mas-ters. Included in it are six techniques for practicing patience. You may want to write them down or memorize them so that you can use them when the need arises. Shantideva explained, as did Pabongka Dechen Nyingpo in Liberation in Your Palm, a technique that is very effective for using the harm received from another person to develop compassion for him. If someone beats you with a stick, you usually do not get angry at the stick because it has no freedom; it is under the control of the person. Similarly, the person harming you is under the control of her anger. 56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"PRACflCING PATIENCE She isn't free; she has become a slave of her anger. Therefore, this per-son, who is not free and who is controlled by her anger, is only an object of compassion. Don't just leave it at that, but take the responsi-bility of pacifying that person's anger. \"I must do something to pacify her anger by whatever means I can find to help her mind.\" If at the moment there is nothing you can do to help directly, then pray to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha to pacify her anger. I NEED SOMEBODY TO HATE ME His Holiness the Dalai Lama normally encourages us to meditate on the kindness of the angry person, to see that he is as precious and kind as the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Guru. Why is that person kind? If nobody ever gets angry at you, you can never develop patience. Think, \"If everybody loved me, if nobody ever got angry at me, I would never be able to develop patience, that precious and essential quality of mind on the path to enlightenment. Therefore, I need somebody to be angry at me. I really need this in my life. It's so important that somebody be angry at me.\" That person's anger is not precious to that person, but it is for you. For the other person, his anger is torture. It throws him into the lower realms. \"For that person, his anger. is terrible, but for me, his being angry at me is so precious, so essential.\" Normally, you say you need somebody to love you. You feel that need so deeply inside. But in the same way, think that you need somebody to hate you-having somebody dislike you is even more imp~rtant than having somebody love you. Why? Because somebody loving you does not help you actualize the path to enlightenment, does not help you cultivate th_e 57"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA qualities needed to benefit all sentient beings. But if somebody harms you and you use that experience to transform your mind into patience, the path to enlightenment lies open in front of you. If you practice patience, your anger evaporates and other sentient beings do not receive harm from you. Through your great patience, they receive only peace and happiness from you. Thus, the angry person is most kind because he gives you the precious opportunity to do this. His being mad at you is like a wish-fulfilling jewel. THE DISADVANTAGES OF ANGER Reflecting on the disadvantages of anger is also useful. Anger destroys your merit. It destroys not only your happiness now, in this life, but also your long-term happiness, your opportunity to attain liberation and enlightenment. Anger is a great obstacle to your realizing bodhi-citta, because you can't have great love and compassion for sentient beings if you can't stand them. In addition, depending on who you get angry at, your receiving realizations may be delayed for many thousands of eons. A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Wily of Life mentions that getting angry once delays realizations by one thousand eons. However, this person being angry at you gives you the opportunity of practicing patience. Think, \"Due to this, I will be able to overcome my anger. I'll be able to complete the paramita of patience, fulfill the two collections, cease all obscurations in my mind, and realize the entire path to enlightenment. I'll be able to free all sentient beings from suffering and lead them to enlightenment.\" All this infinite bene-fit that you can offer to all sentient beings comes from practicing patience for that person, and that depends on her harming you. So you 58"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"PRACflCING PATIENCE can see that her anger at you is very important and necessary in your Dharma practice. When you are upset, you can also think about impermanence and death. You could die today, so what's the point of getting angry? Thinking in this way is very powerful. Also, think that the angry per-son could also die at any time. This helps you let go of your anger and generate patience and compassion for the other person. Practicing patience does not mean withdrawing or hiding. It does not mean avoiding finding solutions to problems. You have responsi-bilities, so you have to use your compassion and wisdom to solve problems as much as possible. As His Holiness says, when it is beyond your capacity to solve a problem, you have to rely on higher objects, the Triple Gem, for aid, but otherwise, use your own abilities and do whatever you can do yourself. Most importantly, cultivate patience, the ability to remain calm in the face of problems and harm. To do this, use whichever techniques are most powerful for you. 59"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"SIX MEDITATION ON THE THREE PURIFICATIONS Earlier, I explained the text of the,Three Purifications. Now we will do a short meditation on this. PURIFICATION OF THE MINp SHRI HERUKA HE stands for the mind, which is the source of everything, and for the self lessness of phenomena, found by examining the fabricated nature of the causal mind. The meaning of HE is the selflessness of phenomena-the emptiness of the aggregates, and in particular the emptiness of the extremely subtle mind, which is the creator of all samsara and nirvana, of all phenomena. Before meditating on the emptiness of the mind, we'll meditate on the emptiness of external phenomena. Look at the forms, the objects of the visual sense consciousness, that appear to you. Look around here-all the forms that you see are merely labeled by your mind. That is how they exist; that is what form is. But in your view, do all these forms appear as merely labeled 61"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA by mind or not? Check. Analyze. Do all these forms-colors, shapes, what is called this and that, all these things that are objects of your visual consciousness-app~::ar to you as merely labeled by your mind or not merely labeled by you mind? [Meditation.] When you examine, you find that they appear as not merely labeled by mind. Open your eyes and look at some of the forms around you and check: do they appear as merely labeled by the mind or as not merely labeled by mind? They appear as not merely labeled by mind. Any form that appears to your mind to exist from there-\"from there\" means on the base-is the refuted object. That is a hal-lucination. All these forms are empty; the forms that appear to be not merely labeled by the mind do not exist. [Meditation.] Let's use another technique to identify the refuted object. Again, look at the forms around you. There is a ceiling appearing from its own side. There is a light appearing from the side of the light. The beams and pillars appear from their own side. The carpet appears from its own side. So does the table. Whatever you look at appears to exist from its own side. When you don't analyze, you don't see all these things as coming from your mind, you don't see them as merely labeled by your mind. All these things around you, whatever you look at, appears from its own side. Another way of expressing this is to say that all these phenomena appear \"there, on the base.'; The table is there on the base of the table; the carpet is there on the base of the carpet. There is a light on base of the light. Everything is there on its base. All these forms are the refut-ed objects. All these are hallucinations. All these are fabricated or pro-jected by your own superstitious mind, ignorance, the concept of inherent existence. 62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MEDITATION ON THE THREE PURIFICATIONS To summarize, we used two techniques to identify the refuted object: 1. We examined things to see if they appeared as merely labeled by the mind or as not merely labeled by the mind, and 2. We recognized that they appear there on the base, as existing from their own side. All these are the refuted object; they are all hallucinations. All these inherently existent things that are there on their bases are fabricated, or projected, by the negative imprint left on the mental continuum by the superstitious mind, ignorance, the concept of inherent exist-ence. All these things that you have believed to be true, to exist just as they appear to you, all these phenomena that appear to be there on their bases do not exist. Think, \"Every day of my life, this is what I have believed. All the time, I have been apprehending things in this way. Actually, in reality, all these things are just in my mind. They are not there. Nothing is there on its base. All these phenomena that appear to me and that I believe to be there on their bases are not there. They are just fabricated by my own concept. In reality, there is nothing there.\" Meditate intensively on this. [Meditation.] Everything that appears from there as not merely labeled by the mind, including the base, does not exist. In other words, the base, the parts of each phenomena, down to the atoms of which it is com-posed, all appear to be real, to be out there, existing independently of the mind that labels them. When you think of atoms, you think of real atoms-there's an atom on the base of the atom. There's a real atom appearing from there. Even this is totally empty. It is not there. 63"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA Think, \"Even the atoms appearing as something real from there are just a hallucination of my own mind, a projection of the negative imprint of ignorance. They are not there. There's nothing there, not even real atoms appearing from there.\" All forms are totally empty of existing from there. They are empty of existing from their own side. Concentrate strongly on this. [Meditation.] Now use. the same technique to meditate on sound. Pay attention to whatever sounds you hear and analyze these objects of auditory consciousness-coughing, cloth moving, and so forth. How do they appear? The sound that exists is that which is merely labeled by the mind, but does it appear as merely labeled by the mind or as not merely labeled by the mind? If it appears as not merely labeled by the mind but as real sound appearing from there, that is the refuted object. That is a hallucination. Meditate on the meaning of hallucina-tion-it means that that sound doesn't exist at all. It is totally empty. That inherently existent sound does not exist at all. [Meditation.] Listen to the sounds of the insects. They appear to be real sounds appearing from there. That is the refuted object and is a total halluci-nation. Meditate on the meaning of hallucination-that is, while you are recognizing it as a hallucination and labeling it as a hallucination, contemplate the meaning of hallucination. It means non-existent. All those inherently existent sounds do not exist at all. They are totally empty. [Meditation.] There is sound. There is something here, but there is no real sound appearing from there. That kind of sound doesn't exist. [Meditation.] Try to differentiate the base of the sound from the label sound. The sound that cannot be differentiated from its base is the refuted object. That is a hallucination. That doesn't exist. To clarify, for us 64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MEDITATION ON THE THREE PURIFICATIONS sentient beings, the particular function of the auditory consciousness is not to see forms, smell scents, or contact tangible objects such as soft and rough. The particular function of the auditory consciousness is to listen and hear. The particular object that the· auditory con-sciousness hears is the base. After the auditory consciousness hears that base, the mind makes up the label sound. For instance, for the mind to be able to make up the particular label \"interesting sound\" or \"disturbing sound,\" the auditory consciousness has to hear some-thing first; it has to contact that particular phenomenon. Otherwise there is no reason for your mind to make up the label \"interesting sound\" or \"unpleasant sound.\" The phenomenon that your auditory sense hears is the base. After that, your mind makes up the label sound. Sound is the label, the phenomenon that the auditory sense hears is the base. What causes your mind to make up the label sound is the base. Without the base, your mind cannot label sound. Thus there is the base-the object that your auditory consciousness hears-and there is the label-sound-that comes into existence after the base has been heard. [Meditation.] This is similar to the example of the letter M. First, you see the base, the design of lines; after that, your mind makes up the label M. Then you see the M. In the same way, first you see the aggregates, then you see the label, person. For example, first you see your moth-er's body, that particular shape and color with those particular charac-teristics. She performed a particular function-she gave birth to you. First seeing the base-her aggregates-gives you the reason to choose the particular label \"my mother.\" After that, you see your mother. It is the same with sound. The bell is rung and your auditory sense hears that phenomenon. That makes you choose the particular label 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA \"sound of bell.\" Mter you create the label \"sound of the bell,\" you believe in it. You may think that you label \"sound of bell\" at the same time as the auditory consciousness hears the base. If that were the case, there would be no cause to inspire your mind to choose the particular label sound. If there were not a specific cause, you could label any-thing as the sound of a bell. Labeling \"sound of the bell\" wouldn't depend on the bell ringing. When someone beat a drum, you could label \"sound of bell.\" After you label \"sound\" on a suitable base, an object of the auditory sense, it appears back to you as if there were a sound there on the base. Even though the sound is merely labeled by your mind, it appears to your mind as if it exists from its own side, there on the base. Now examine the sounds that you hear-insects buzzing, people coughing. All these sounds appearing from there are fabricated by the negative imprints of your superstitious mind, ignorance, the concept of inherent existence. None of them are there. They are just your own concept, just in your own mind. They are completely empty. Meditate on emptiness by relating this to each sound. [Meditation.] Sounds exist-the sounds of people moving and insects buzzing and so forth-but sounds appearing from there, sounds existing on their bases, that part is in your mind. It is just your own concept. They are not there. They are empty. If you are able to hear the sound that is empty, the sound that doesn't exist from its own side, that is the correct view.

When you're meditating on the emptiness of smell, if someone farts, it only benefits you. It helps you meditate on emptiness. That strong smell, that real smell appearing from there, is the refuted object. It is a hallucination. It is totally empty. It doesn't exist from there. It is false.

According to the view of wisdom, a non-existent I is doing the non-existent action of drinking non-existent tea. Here, non-existent means non-inherently existent. It does not mean totally non-existent. This is similar to what the Heart Sutra h . \" \" d\" c means w en It says,. no eye, no nose, no tongue an no rorm, no sound, no smell.\" \"No\" applies to the inherently existent I, the real I from there, the real action of drinking from there, the real tea appear-ing from there.

Both focus on the same object, but mental fac-tors perform mainly the function of perceiving specific aspects or qualities of the object. Consciousness, on the other hand, functions to cognize the essence of the object. Due to this function, which is the base, the mind makes up the label consciousness. There is the base, and there is the label consciousness. But when it appears to your mind, it appears as if the consciousness is there on the base, as if there is a real consciousness on the mind that does that particular function. Although real consciousness appears from there, it is not there. It is just in your mind. It is just your concept. That consciousness is false. Therefore, it is totally empty; it doesn't exist there.

[Meditation.] Your wisdom sees emptiness, which is similar to space. Nothing exists from its own side, not even an atom. Just in case ordinary space and not emptiness appears to you, think that even space is empty. It doesn't exist from its own side at all. I often mention this during the wisdom initiation. When you think of space, it does not appear as merely labeled space. Rather, real space appears from there. That space is the refuted object. It is a hallucination. That means that space is totally non-existent. So here, you can get some idea of emptiness. Even space does not exist from its own side. Nothing whatsoever exists-from its own side. [Meditation.] We have just meditated on emptiness. Now, the subject (yul-chen), the wisdom realizing emptiness, experiences the greatest bliss, infinite bliss, unlimited like the sky.

[Concluding meditation.] Every time you meditate on emptiness, unbelievably powerful purifi-cation occurs. Just having doubt about the nature of reality-\"Things might not be inherently existent\" or \"Maybe things don't exist from their own side\" -is said to break samsara into pieces. The Condensed Sutra says that simply having interest or faith in emptiness or the wish to realize it purifies the ten non-virtuous actions. I cannot remember if it also purifies the five uninterrupted actions. In one sutra it says that if you compare the merit of practicing the first five paramitas-generosity, ethics, patience, joyous effort, and concentration-for ten thousand eons with that gained by listening to teachings on empti-ness, the latter creates the greater merit; explaining teachings on emptiness to others creates much more merit than listening to teach-ings on emptiness for ten thousand eons-in this case, I think that 76"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MEDITATION ON THE THREE PURIFICATIONS the profit is mine, my business profit!-and meditating on emptiness for even one second creates much more merit than explaining teach-ings on emptiness for ten thousand eons.

Without identifying the refuted object, there is no way to med-itate on emptiness. Accurately recognizing the false object, the refuted object, gives you an unmistaken view of emptiness, and reflecting on the emptiness of each category of phenomena as we just did gives you great merit. This also becomes meditation on the Heart Sutra, the ··essence of all the Buddha's Prajnaparamita teachings, the Wisdom Gone Beyond.

Not only during sitting meditation but also during the break time, visualize yourself as the deity you are practicing. Hold the divine identity (divine pride) of yourself as that deity. Practicing pure appearance and divine pride are fundamental practices in all four ~lasses of tantra. Practicing pure appearance (clear appearance) and pure view (divine pride) involves stopping the impure (ordinary) appearance and impure (ordinary) concept respectively. For example, if you visualize your enemy, the person you hate and wish would die, as the deity, you no longer have a problem with him or her. Why? Because you have transformed the object. Before, it was an impure, ordinary person; you had an ordinary view or concept of him, so it was easy to get angry. But when you transform that person into the pure appearance of the deity, your view of him changes. Visualize your enemy as the most wrathful deity, Yamantaka. You don't get angty at Yamantaka, do you? Then, there's no question of getting mad at a peaceful deity such as Tara, who is calm and smiling. This is incredible psychology. By transforming the object into something pure, your negative emotional reactions and ordinary, troubling, impure 79"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA thoughts and delusions won't arise. The philosophical texts speak of three conditions causing a con-sciousness to arise-immediate condition, objective condition, and dominant condition. Here you are working with the objective condi-tion, the object of your perception. Transforming this into the pure appearance of a deity helps your mind; it purifies your mind. You can then easily transform your thoughts and have pure, useful, and bene-ficial thoughts, which protects you from creating negative karma and thus from rebirth in the lower realms of samsara. You also create merit, and right at that moment, you experience peace. All those other ordinary, superstitious thoughts and troubling emotions are stopped because you are visualizing the object as pure. In addition, cultivating pure appearance and pure view results in enlightenment. When you are enlightened, you will have all the qual-ities of a Buddha and the four purities, which are: 1. Having a completely pure holy body of a deity; 2. Seeing the environment, the place where you are, as pure, that is, as a mandala, which is a manifestation of the deity's wisdom; 3. Having completely pure enjoyments, with no higher bliss to experience; and 4. Engaging in completely pure actions, such as liberating sentient beings from suffering and leading them from happiness to happiness to enlightenment. This is the ultimate goal and result of practicing pure appearance and pure view. The kind of emotional thought arising in you-pure or impure-80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEITY PRACTICE depends upon how you look at the object, whether you see it as ordi-nary and impure, or as pure. This is how it normally works in your daily life. The way you look at things affects your mind. How your mind looks at sense objects, how it thinks of them-in other words how your mind creates them-reflects back on you, having either a negative or positive effect. Depending on this, ordinary thoughts or pure thoughts arise. The kind of thought that arises makes you look at the object in a particular way, and that again has an effect back on you, causing a particular emotion or attitude to arise. It is like a cir-cle. The kind of life you experience-ups and downs, suffering feel-ings and pleasant feelings-depends on how your mind creates the object, what kind of concept or interpretation your mind projects on the object. Then, when your senses meet the object, it affects back on you and you experience different feelings, pleasant and unpleasant. The key is your own mind. Your mind is like a key, or perhaps a TV remote control, which can open the door to enlightenment or the door to samsara. The whole secret is your mind, how you think. How your life will turn out this hour, today, from now on, depends on what you do with your mind, what kind of thoughts you generate. The other night we talked about patience, and I explained how everything comes from your mind. How people treat you, whether or not they help you, all comes from your mind. This relates to the twelve links-what you experience comes from your consciousness (the third link), which arises from your karma (the second link), which comes from your ignorance (the first link). In your daily life, what makes you encounter problems, what makes you believe that something is beneficial or harmful, is your mind. But normally, you do not see things that way. Normally, you never think that good 81"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA opportunities and success come from your own mind. However, when you look deeper, you'll see that the evolution is indeed like that. Your experiences come from your mind, from your karma. Your mind is the creator. Looking at things in this way only helps. It immediately cuts off all the unreasonable expectations you project on others, thus stopping the disappointment, frustration, and anger that you experi-ence when things do not work out the way you want or expect. Viewing things in this way stops many of your life's problems; they do not occur when you are aware of the role your mind has in creating your experiences. But when you think purity and happiness come from the side of the object and not from your mind, difficulties always arise. This is connected to the practice of guru devotion as well as to your daily life's interactions with other people. Both individual problems and world problems come from not relating experiences to the mind, to karma, thinking instead that they come from outside, from things or other people. In fact, if something is harmful or helpful, desirable or undesirable, a success or a failure, it all has its origins in the mind. Your thought makes up the good and the bad that you believe about another person. Therefore, if you have a problem with some-body, if you change the way you look at that person, your upset will go away, even if the other person does not change his or her attitude or behavior towards you. This is an example of transforming the way you look at an object in relation to tantric practice. The practice of transforming the way you think of an object also exists in the lam-rim teachings, in the part about thought transformation. Here, in relation to tantra, you visualize your enemy as the deity. This does not mean that Yamantaka or what-ever deity you're visualizing appears to your eyes.

You have, instead, a pure thought on a pure object. That pure thought plants the seed of enlightenment, purifies the mind, and creates merit, thus enabling you to attain the four complete purities-pure body, environment, enjoyments, and activities-of the result.

If people bring you food, see yourself as the deity and enjoy it as such. Second, think of all sounds as the deity's holy speech, the mantra. Whether someone praises you or criticizes you, whether you hear an interesting sound or an unpleasant one, think of it as the deity's holy speech. Third, whatever thought, memory, or concept arises in your mind, think of it as the deity's holy mind, as non-dual bliss and emptiness in nature.

In this way, since your mind likes happiness, it is able to keep the feeling of bliss and emptiness longer. When your mind is continuously occupied by bliss and emptiness, less opportu-nity exists for the delusions and superstitious thoughts to arise. In this way, you utilize whatever you see, hear, or think in the path to enlightenment. You use these experiences to achieve enlightenment for sentient beings. Extensive benefit comes from doing this practice, especially in the break times. In the practice of Highest Yoga Tantra, try to focus on everything causing great bliss within you. Try to transform everything you see, hear, or think about so that it causes great bliss. Then, use that bliss to understand emptiness. This is an important point. When you have sense enjoyments, think that you, the deity, are making offering to you, the deity. In this way, you enjoy the sense objects and also use that experience to develop the bliss that realizes emptiness. Thus, your enjoyments will increase ydur concentration on bliss and emptiness. Then you will become like a snow lion, who has no fear of being attacked by other animals. All other wild animals have enemies, so they are always afraid, constantly aware, and can never relax.

This mantra is the root, secret, sublime mantra of the hero and heroine. It should be recited seven times.\" In other words, when you meet your guru, the vajra master, it is good to recite the Eight-line Praises either seven times or three; at least once. Doing so will inspire you and make your mind joyful. When you go on pilgrimage and see holy objects, representations of the holy body, speech, or mind, such as paintings, stupas, or texts, you should recite and practice these praises. There are three special holy places of Heruka, one each for the holy body, holy speech, and holy mind. One is Mount Kailash, an unbeliev-ably precious place. Another is Tsari, also in Tibet. It is said that if you circumambulate this mountain barefoot, because of the hardship you happily endure, you will purify so many obscurations that you will attain clairvoyance.

This is one of Rinpoche's secret life stories. If you practice Heruka and Vajrayogini, it is not essential to make pilgrimage to these places. Of greatest importance is doing the prac-tice, especially that of the body mandala, wherever you are. The main thing is to practice the complete path of Heruka and Vajrayogini on the pasis of bodhicitta, understanding emptiness and keeping pure samaya with the guru, the qualified virtuous friend. One very high Sakya Lama, Drogon Chogyal Pagpa-the guru of Kublai Khan, who gran~ed him supreme authority over Tibet-wanted to leave Tibet for pilgrimage in India. His disciple, a great yogi named Ling Repa, requested him not to go but to stay in Tibet. He said, ''All the holy places are in your body-in your chakras. You don't have to go away. If you want to purify and create merit by going on pilgrimage, do it in your chakras, in the holy places in your body.\" Therefore, meditating on your own vajra body is the main thing, but if you are able to go to the external holy places, they do bless your mind, chakras, channels, winds, and drops. You also purify and col-lect merit by making pilgrimage to holy places.

It is not so difficult to gain realizations there because you receive blessings more quickly and it is. therefore easier to tame your mind. Heruka's man-dala-perhaps the holy body mandala of Chakrasamvara's mandala-is there. Bathing in or drinking water from Lake Manasarovar, which is near Mount Kailash, purifies negative karma and liberates you from the lower realms.

BENEFITS OF RECITING THE EIGHT-LINE PRAISES Before reciting the Eight-line Praises, visualize yourself as Heruka. Think that you are the embodiment of all the dakas and dakinis, the essence encompassing all the Buddhas of the ten directions. Then recite the Eight-line Praises. In this way, you will collect extensive merit and benefit in that very moment by making offering· to and praising the Buddhas. The Tibetan words Pal Korlo Dompa mean Shri Chakrasamvara in Sanskrit. Pal is Shri and means glorious. Korlo Dompa is Chakrasamvara; Shri Chakrasamvara means all the chakras or wheels of existence united, or integrated, into one.

The wisdom of great bliss non-dual with emptiness arises as, or takes the form that is labeled, Heruka. This is the meaning of Chakrasamvara. From this meditation you understand that chakra refers to all phenomena being integrated into one. That is, the empty nature of all phenomena is integrated into one.

All the time, Heruka will happily abide within you. You will always be with the great hero Heruka and enjoy great bliss. You will become a fortunate being, an object of Heruka's compassion and love. This helps to increase the bliss because it enables you to receive the blessings of Heruka Father and Mother. To attain enlightenment, you have to cease the gross mind because it does not continue to enlightenment. Even the gross minds of the arhats and arya bodhisattvas who realize emptiness directly do not go on to enlightenment. Only the extremely subtle consciousness continues on to enlightenment, so you must be able to make that mind manifest. The extremely subtle mind of clear light that has been transformed into the entity of the transcendental wisdom of inseparable bliss and emptiness is the direct cause to attain the dharmakaya of a Buddha.

Second, offer confession of all the negative karma, obscurations, and degenerated vows and commitments that you have accumulated from beginningless rebirths. Third, from the bottom of your heart, make whatever requests you may have for this and future lives. From your side, meditate that Guru Heruka has completely accepted your requests. Pabongka Dechen Nyingpo explained that thinking in this way is not fatiguing as is going on pilgrimage to faraway places with great hardship. It is not time-consuming as is making thousands of offer-ings to the holy objects of Buddha's hOly body, speech and mind. It does not require tormas or other external substances as do protector pujas and offerings to the landlord spirits.

When sick people used to come to see Lama, he would put his mala on their back and recite the Eight-line Praises. That made me think, because I had not seen other lamas do that. It was not a normal practice. But when I read the benefits of the Praises, I understood why Lama treated sick people by reciting the Praises. It is an impor-tant healing technique, similar to doing pujas for the sick. When you recite the Praises, all Buddhas, dakas, and dakinis enter you and bless the sick person, eliminating their spirit harm or contagious disease. 91"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"ACHAT ABOUT HERUKA Pabongka Dechen Nyingpo said to cherish this practice as a means of achieving success in whatever you do and whatever you wish for in this life, future lives, and the intermediate state. If you are completing a Dharma practice or project, if you want to help the living or the deceased-whatever you want to be successful-doing this practice of the Eight-line Praises is worthwhile. The Heruka Root Tantra states that all the dakinis will be will attracted to and like the person who recites the Eight-line Praises. \"Whether you recite it at the beach, near a pond, in the mountains, at a crossroads, at a well, on the road, in a house, or in a swimming pool, all the dakinis will be happy and will all pay attention to you. They will eliminate all your obstacles and help you gather all the con-ditions· that you need. Even though the dakas and dakinis of the ten directions may be far away, they will always pay attention to you without distraction and will bless you. If you make prostrations, it will become an offering to all the Buddhas. You will also enjoy with the great hero, Heruka. Heruka, Vajra Varahi, and the messenger yoginis will abide in your heart. The Heruka Root Tantra says that other people who were born at the same time as the person reciting the Eight-line Praises will also collect merit. Beings who see Heruka practitioners, hear their voice, remember them, touch them, or make connection with them-whether it is an animal or a human being-will definitely collect great merit. These are the condensed benefits of doing this practice. To summarize, when you do the practice of the Eight-line Praises, think that Guru Heruka enters your heart.

Especially confess the heaviest negative karma, those created in rela-tion to your gurus in this and previous lives-not following their advice, disturbing their holy minds, harming their holy bodies, or criticizing or turning away from them. Confess all the unkind thoughts and mistakes in relation to the guru, especially the heaviest one, degenerated samaya vows.

I pray for the people who rely upon me and those for whom I promised to pray. If you are going to do a long .retreat, pray for it to be successful and free from obstacles. At this time, you can pray for someone who is extremely ill, dying, or having many problems. From your side, think your heart Guru Heruka completely agrees and promises. ONE ESSENCE All the Buddhas of the ten directions are one essence, one holy mind. Pabongka Dechen Nyingpo uses the example of all streams and rivers flowing into the ocean. When all those different forms of water come into the ocean, they become one. Similarly, when you become enlightened, you become one with all the Buddhas, one mind. Some lamas follow this way of thinking, while other lamas say that the Buddhas have separate mental continua. I find the way Pabongka Dechen Nyingpo explained it more comfortable and easier to accept. Thinking that all the Buddhas have separate mental continua is more difficult for me. The ultimate guru, the dharmakaya, the transcen-dental wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness, is eternal. It is the primordial savior (liberator), the originator (source) without begin-ning or end, that pervades all existence. 94"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"BENEFITS OF THE EIGHT-LINE PRAISES In Christianity, God is explained as being eternal, with no begin-ning and no end.

The ultimate guru is the completely pure, extremely subtle mind that is the wisdom of simultaneously-born great bliss realizing empti-ness non-dually. This pervades all phenomena and is without begin-ning or end. When any sentient being becomes enlighteried, their mind becomes this. All the countless Buddhas are manifestations of this. Thinking like this, you can understand why the ultimate guru, the dharmakaya, is called the source, originator, 9r creator.

There are many reasons for and benefits of this practice. Nagarjuna's Root Wisdom says, \"Whatever has emptiness has every-thing.\" This is a literal translation. It means that if things ll.re empty, they can perform functions and have effects; while empty, they func-tion. What functions do they have? Arising, abiding, and disintegrat-ing. After a thing arises, or is born, and before it ceases, it abides; that phenomenon continues. For example, in our lives, we are born and we die, and in between, we abide, or exist. Even though ~ur life changes every split second, it is said to abide because there is the con-tinuity of a similar type of phenomenon. Causative phenomena arise due to causes and conditions, disinte-grate due to causes and conditions, and abide due to causes and con-ditions. Emptiness, on the other hand, is not like that; it is not under the control of causes and conditions. The emptiness of a clock, for example, has a beginni~g and an end. It begins when the clock comes into existence and ends when the clock is destroyed, but it is not under the control of causes and conditions. When Nagarjuna said, ''Any phenomenon that has emptiness has everything,\" he meant that because something is empty, empty of existing from its own side, it 109"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA exists. If it were not empty, it could not exist. Everything comes into existence out of emptiness. Your~life, your self, all phenomena come from emptiness. Because they are empty, they are able to arise, abide, and disintegrate. Because they are empty, they are able to perform various functions and have effects-various types of suffering, tempo-rary happiness, or ultimate happiness. Generally speaking, the right hand signifies method and the left, wisdom realizing emptiness. The left, therefore, signifies that all ani-mate and inanimate phenomena-all living beings and their environ-ments-come from emptiness. They exist because they are empty; they do not exist from their own side. When practicing tantra, you meditate that all animate and inanimate things are manifestations of the . transcendental wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness. This is also included in the meaning of left-side conduct. All meditational deities and pure lands, deities and mandalas, are the play, or the manifestation, of the transcendental wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness. They are all transformations of this wisdom, so they too come from the left side. For this reason, one of the moth-er tantra samayas commits us to begin all actions with our left ·side. This helps us remember emptiness. Once we went to meet Kyabje Song Rinpoche at the London air-port. As he stepped onto the moving walkway, he put his left foot on first and said, \"Oh, this time the left-side conduct happened!\" Even to the ordinary view, he was no doubt a great yogi, but in reality, he was an enlightened being, Heruka. There is no need to speak of his practice of the vows. His holy mind was beyond that. He did not need vows and samaya to help him to practice Dharma because his mind was already completely subdued. 110"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"LEFT-SIDE CONDUCT We were all sitting on chairs waiting for his luggage when an older lady, a tourist, came to shake Rinpoche's hand. Of course, Rinpoche did not normally shake hands with people, but in this case he did. He said, \"This also becomes meaningful,\" meaning that the lady received some benefit from holding his hand. Remember what the Root Tantra said when discussing th~ benefits of reciting the Praises-anybody who sees or touches the Hetuka practitioner purifies negative karma and creates merit. Eve.n a person born on the same day as a Heruka yogi collects merit. When a Chakrasamvara practitioner crosses a bridge, any insects beneath it receive benefit that will result in libera-tion. If this is so, there's no question that any people, animals, or insects that are in the same area as a yogi who has realized the mean-ing clear light get purified. When Kyabje Song Rinpoche and Lama Yeshe were around, we received great benefit just being near such great lamas who, even to the ordinary view, were highly realized yogis. Because of their realiza-tions, just being around them, we purified much negative karma. Therefore, this lady who came out of the crowd and shook hands with Song Rinpoche received great benefit; much of her negative karma was purified. It was a simple occurrence, but if yoti were to explain it in depth, the commentary would be huge! You would have to explain all Rinpoche's realizations, which would mean explaining the entire path to enlightenment. Because Kyabje Song Rinpoche came to the West, many people had the opportunity of meeting the Mahayana and Vajrayana teach-ings and receiving initiation into the Lower Tantras and Highest Yoga Tantra. Rinpoche gave many initiations and teachings. In particular, apart from Gomo Tulku, Song Rinpoche was one of the few lamas 111"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA who gave initiation into and taught Chod practice in the Gelug tradi-tion. Lama requested him to give it at the Dharma Celebration in 1982, and from then on, the Gelug tradition of Chod began in the West. Anyway, I'm just telling you some stories. You can practic~ left-side conduct in many daily situations. I remember to do it when eating, but not at other times. However, if you make a plan, it is easy to remember. For example, when you begin eating, pick your fork or spoon up with your left hand and eat a few spoonfuls. When you pick up your bell and vajra, start with your left hand. When you begin some work, touch the object or begin the task with your left hand. This does not mean that you only ever use your left hand and leg and that your right hand and leg are paralyzed! It just means that you begin an activity with your left. If you watch, you will see some practitioners of Heruka or Vajrayogini do this. When you start walking, take the first step with your left foot. You can apply this to many circumstances in your daily life, and each time you do, it helps you remember emptiness. Many benefits accrue from practicing the mother tantra samaya vow of left-side conduct. The commentary does not enumerate them; I made the following numbers up. 1. You will accumulate the merit needed to attain enlighten-ment more quickly. You will not need to spend countless eons completing this. 2. You will not need to practice many paths but will be able to integrate everything into one. The left side signifies the tran-scendental wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness, which is what makes this path extremely profound and special. 112"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"LEFT-SIDE CONDUCf 3. You will be able to draw to yourself the mudras, or mes-senger dakinis, who will enable you to actualize the clear light and thus the transcendental wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness. To generate this path into which everything is integrated-the transcendental wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness-you need to be one of the fortunate ones. who can draw to themselves· the special mudras, or messengers, because practicing with them makes the path much quicker. As well as physical mudras, or consorts, mind mudras exist. Mind mudras are ones you visualize during the secret and wisdom initiations, for example. Physical mudras are the, mantra-born, field-born, or simultaneously-born mudras~ Different commentaries may define these mudras in differenJ ways. According to the Lama Chapa commentary, mantra-born mudras are human beings who have realizations of the generation stage; field-born mudras have realizations of the completion stage up to and including the impure illusory body; and simultaneously-born mudras are female beings who have realized the actual clear light, the state of union, or full enlightenment. 4. The yoginis abiding in the special places, such as the twenty-four holy places, see from afar that you have . a special yoga practice. They will come to meet you and will predict when you will attain enlightenment. Thus, the left-side conduct is highly admired to create the cause for Vajrayogini and the dakinis in the holy places to guide you. 5. It creates the cause to have the outer, inner, and great Kacho.

If you are a highly realized prac-titioner, like Lama Yeshe or Song Rinpoche, then even if physically you are here, it is like being in the pure land. You have overcome the cycle of death and rebirth by realizing the meaning clear light-the inner pure land, the inner Kacho -and will become enlightened in this life. The outer Kacho is Vajrapani Institute, among the redwoods, so one benefit of left-side conduct is always being at Vajrapani Institute!

I noticed that when we used to offer tsog, Kyabje Song Rinpoche would bless it in both hands. He was probably doing this meditation. By doing this practice, you will avoid many shortcomings and cre-ate much merit, resulting in happiness for yourself and others. If you eat with attachment, with every spoonful you take, you receive the vice of transgressing one of the secondary bodhisattva precepts. Pabongka Dechen Nyingpo said that the karma of transgressing a. sec-ondary bodhisattva precept is 100,000 times heavier than breaking a root pratimoksha vow. Kyabje Song Rinpoche mentioned that if somebody who has taken initiation does not bless the food before eat-ing it, the karma is sixteen times heavier than a monastic breaking all four root pratimoksha precepts. Thus, by doing the hand offering, you avoid such heavy vice. By doing this food yoga, you will not experience untimely death, ulcers, or the incurable phlegm disease in which hair grows in your throat. You will not be harmed by poison or receive pollution from the wrong livelihood of not being worthy of receiving offerings· that 115"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"A CHAT ABOUT HERUKA others give you with faith. Each time you eat, you will receive the exten-sive benefits of offering to the deity with the mind of guru yoga seeing the deity and the guru as being the same in nature. Doing the hand offering also creates the cause to attain the outer and inner Kacho. First generate bodhicitta motivation. Then generate yourself as Chakrasamvara. Think of the food being between your two hands. Begin as you do for blessing the inner offering by dispelling the inter-ferers. Recite OM KHANDAROHI HUM HUM PEY and emanate wrathful Khandarohi from your heart to do this. Then purify the food into emptiness. In the center of your right hand is a white HO, which transforms into an eight-spoked white wheel marked in the center with a white HO, which becomes Vairocana in nature. In the palm of your left hand there is a red HA, which transforms into a eight-petaled red lotus marked in the center with a red HA, which becomes Amitabha in nature. Between your two hands your wisdom of bliss and emptiness appears as the syllable AH, which transforms into an extensive skull-cup that is white on the outside and red within. Inside this skullcup are the five meats and the five nectars. Above them, in the center, is a sun disc on top of which is a blue HRI, which becomes Akshobhya in essence.6 Then recite HA. HO HRI three times. This purifies the faults of color, smell, taste, and potential. All the bad color, smell, taste, and potential are destroyed, and the substances become nectar. On the right side of the HRI is a white OM, on the left side a red AH, and in front a blue HUM.

Books like this show you how to put the teachings into prac-tice and integrate them into your life, whereby you get the happiness you seek. Therefore, anything containing Dharma teachings or the names of your teachers is more precious than other material objects and should be treated with respect. To avoid creating the karma of not meeting the Dharma again in future lives, please do not put books (or other holy objects) on the floor or underneath other stuff, step over or sit upon them, or use thein for mundane purposes such as propping up wobbly tables. They should be kept in a clean, high place, separate from worldly writings, and wrapped in cloth when being carried around. These are but a few considerations. Should you need to get rid of Dharma materials, they should not be thrown in the rubbish but burned in a special way. Briefly: do not incinerate such materials with other trash, but alone, and as they burn, recite the mantra OM AH HUM. As the smoke rises, visualize that it pervades all of space, carrying the essence of the Dharma to all sentient beings in the six samsaric realms, purifying their minds; alleviating their suffering, and bringing them all happiness, up to and including enlightenment.

Rinpoche's own description of his early years may be found in his book, The Door to Satisfaction (Wisdom Publications). At the age of ten, Rinpoche went to Tibet and studied and meditated at Domo Geshe Rinpoche's monastery near Pagri, until the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959 forced him to forsake Tibet for the safety of Bhutan. Rinpoche then went to the Tibetan refugee camp at Buxa Duar, West Bengal, India, where he met Lama Yeshe, who became his closest teacher. The Lamas went to Nepal in 1967, and over the next few years built Kopan and Lawudo Monasteries. In 1971 Lama Zopa Rinpoche gave the first of his famous annual lam-rim retreat courses, which continue at Kopan to this day. In 1974, with Lama Yeshe, Rinpoche began traveling the world to teach and establish centers of Dharma.
