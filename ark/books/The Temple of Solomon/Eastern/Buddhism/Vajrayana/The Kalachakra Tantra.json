It presents the series of initiations authoriz­ing practice of the first of two stages involved in the tantra, the stage of generation- the period of imaginative appearance as an ideal being. A system of daily practice required of those who have received initiation is also included. Discussed are the process of preparing the student for initiation and the actual stages of the seven initiations that authorize practice of visualization of a practitioner as a deity - or ideal, altruistically active being-in a mandala, an ideal environment. This is the first time that a tantric initiation ritual has been explained in detail in a Western language. The initiation. ritual is translated, interspersed with commentary from His Holi­ness the Dalai Lama, temporal and spiritual leader of Tibet, mainly from a ceremony conducted in Wisconsin in 1981. The Kalachakra initiation was offered for the first time in the West by His Holiness the Dalai Lama during July of 1981 (the year of the Iron Bird) at Deer Park, a small rural site outside of Madison, Wisconsin, that is the home of a Tibetan Buddhist monastery and temple. The i�itiation was organized and sponsored by the Deer Park Buddhist Center and friends, a Buddhist organization under the direction of the Venerable GesheSopa. ·"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 The Kiilachakra Tantra During the process of the initiation, the Dalai Lama, as is customary, gave copious commentary detailing the proper attitude and motivation of the recipient and the individual steps of visualization and of reflection on profound and subtle topics that are at the heart of the initiation, or authorization, process. His explanations offered during the ceremony, as well as others given privately to me in preparation for serving as his translator, bring the basic initiation ceremony to life, rich with meaning and contextualization. The special tantric techniques for transforming body, speech, and mind into completely altruistic expression are thereby made lucid and accessible to interested readers. The Introduction first describes the general Great Vehicle view on purification into a state of altruistic service as well as the special tantric practice of deity yoga that is founded on compassion and realization of emptiness. Next, it describes the process of initiation for the stage of generation, outlining and explaining the many steps in the ritual. It also provides background on the history of the Kiilachakra Tantra and intro­duces the authors and texts.

According to explanations standard in Tibetan Buddhism, 2 even in the Low Vehicle3 schools of tenets-Great Exposition School4 and Sutra School -in which the mental and physical continuum of an enlightened being is said to be completely severed at the time of death, there is a period, subsequent to enlightenment, of far more effective interaction with others, as was the case with Shakyamuni Buddha. According to the Great Vehicle schools of tenets-the Mind Only School and the Middle Way School-which hold that the continuum of mind never ends, the primary aim of Bodhisattvas is to bring about the welfare of. other sentient beings and the means to accom­plish this is their own enlightenment, the gaining of authentic freedom. For, with the attainment of a Buddha's enlighten­ment, there is gained a limitless, unending, spontaneous capacity to help others effectively. What distinguishes someone as a Bodhisattva is to engender an altruistic intention to become enlightened, which, through training, has become so spontaneous that it is as strong out-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"14 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins side as it is within meditation. This is called bodhichitta, literally \"mind of enlightenment\" but more like \"mind toward enlightenment\", \"mind directed toward enlighten­ment\". As Maitreya's Ornament for Clear Realization (mngon rtogs rgyan, abhisamayiilamkiira) says:5 Mind generation is asserted as a wish for complete Perfect enlightenment for the sake of others. This has been formulated into a definition of bodhichitta or, as I translate it, \"altruistic intention to become enlightened\": a main mental consciousness induced by an aspira-tion for [bringing about] others' welfare and ac­companied by an aspiration to one's enlighten­ment.6 It is an attitude endowed with two aspirations, the first for others' welfare and the second for one's own highest en­lightenment as a Buddha, the latter being seen as a means for accomplishing the first. Even though one's own enlighten­ment must be accomplished first in order to bring about others' welfare, service to others is prime in terms of moti­vation. The enlightenment of a Buddha is seen as a means to bring about others' welfare because a Buddha, being omniscient, knows all possible techniques for advancement and knows in detail the predispositions and interests of other beings. Between the two bodies of a Buddha, Truth Body and Form Body7 (the latter including the Complete Enjoyment Body and the Emanation Body), Bodhisattvas primarily seek Form Bodies, since it is through physical form that the welfare of others can be accomplished, this being mainly through teach­ing what is to be adopted in practice and what is to be discarded in behavior. Though Truth and Form Bodies necessarily accompany each other and thus are achieved together, the Bodhisattvas' emphasis is on achieving Form Bodies in order to appear in myriad forms suitable to the interests and dis­positions of trainees and to teach them accordingly. Some Bodhisattvas' motivation is described as like that of a king, for they see themselves as first becoming enlightened"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Altruistic Purification 15 and then helping others. Others' motivation is described as like that of a boatman since they strongly want to arrive at the shore of the freedom of Buddhahood in the company of every­one else. Again, others' motivation is described as like that of a shepherd in that they want to see others safely enlightened before they become enlightened, like a shepherd returning home at the rear of the flock. The only realistic mode is said in Tibetan traditions to be the first, the king-like motivation, since there is no state superior to Buddhahood for accom­plishing others' welfare. Hence, the description that Bodhi­sattvas put off final enlightenment as Buddhas in order to be of greater service to sentient beings is considered to be an exaggerated statement expressing the greatness of their al­truistic, shepherd-like motivation. Buddhahood, with such altruistically oriented knowledge and activity, is the final aim- \"final\" in the sense that it is the path of no more learning, there being no further development of new levels of understanding or compassion. It is a begin­ning in the sense that for the first time one can serve others to one's full capacity, forever, unceasingly, as long as there are beings who need to be helped, and that is forever. This heroic effort to bring about others' welfare is conceived in terms of there being (1) a basis for such purification and transformation within us, (2) objects of purification, (3) a path that serves as a means of purification, and (4) a fruit of that purification. THE BASIS OF PURIFICATION The basis of purification is the Buddha nature, which is viewed in two ways. One is the clear light nature of the mind, a positive phenomenon, and the other is the emptiness of inherent existence of the mind, a negative phenomenon, a mere absence of inherent establishment of the mind, which is a precondition for its transformation. Both of these aspects are said to be expressed in the famous statement from Dharma­kirti's Commentary on (Dignaga's) \"Compendium [of Teachings] on Valid Cognition\" (tshad rna rnam 'grel, pramiirJavarttika):8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"16 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins The nature of the mind is clear light. The defilements are adventitious. \"Adventitious\" (glo bur ba) here does not mean \"uncaused\" but instead means that the defilements do not subsist in the very nature of the mind. Since desire, hatred, and ignorance do not reside in the very nature of the mind -because the nature of the mind is clear light -the defilements can be removed without destroying the mind. The clear light nature of the mind in its first sense as a positive phenomenon is also emphasized in Maitreya's Sub­lime Continuum of the Great Vehicle (rgyud bla ma, uttaratantra), but it has its fullest exposition in Highest Yoga Tantras such as the Guhyasamaja Tantra and the Kiilachakra Ta ntra. In these systems it is described as the fundamental innate mind of clear light-fundamental in the sense that its continuum exists forever, that is to say, both while one is afflicted and, after enlightenment, while unafflicted. It also is described as the ali-good (kun tu bzang po, samantabhadra) and as the basis-of­all (kun gzhi, iilaya) in that it is the basis of all the phenomena both of cyclic existence and of nirvana. 9 At first, it may seem surprising that a system emphasizing suffering as much as Buddhism does should also have a doctrine of a basic good­ness or basic purity of the mind, but such a foundation is essential for the radical transformation of the condition of suffering into a state of freedom. The second way of conceiving the Buddha nature is as the absence of inherent existence10 of the mind. This does not refer to a non-existence of the mind, nor does it refer to its lacking definition or nature, for the definition of conscious­ness is \"that which is luminous and knowing\".\" Rather, it refers to the mind's not existing under its own power, the mind's not being established by way of its own character, the mind's not existing from its own side. This is the emptiness of the mind, which is an existent quality of the mind while at the same time being the final nature of the mind. For instance, when analyzing to determine whether a table exists in its own right, .one investigates whether it is exactly the same as its parts or completely different from its parts (one of these two being required if the table exists in its own right), one does not"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Altruistic Purification 17 find such a table, but rather finds a non-finding of the table. This non-finding is the emptiness of the table. Its emptiness is a mere absence of the table's existing from its own side; this emptiness exists and can be realized, first conceptuaHy and eventually directly. In terms of the mind, its emptiness also can be settled by way of many approaches, examining its production by causes, its production of effects, its relationship with the beginning, middle, and end of a moment of mind, and so forth. When, through these approaches, one realizes the emptiness of irt­herent existence of the mind, one can for the first time under­stand that the mind, and other phenomena, are falsities, appearing to exist in their own right but not existing in their own right. The conflict between appearance and fact is under­stood, this distortion being seen as having two aspects. One is the false appearance even to non-conceptual sensory percep­tion of objects as if they inherently exist; the other is concep­tual assent to that false appearance. This error is endemic in that not only do we innately, without any training, conceive phenomena to exist in their own right but also, even in raw sense perception, phenomena appear in a false aspect due to faults embedded deep in our minds (though not in the nature of the mind). From this point of view all phenomena except emptiness are called san:zvt:ti-satya, \"truths-for-a-concealer\", truths for a concealing consciousness, san:zvrti being primarily under­stood as that which covers, that which obscures. \"Truth\" here is specified as meaning that which exists the way it appears, and only an ignorant consciousness takes objects such as tables or a mind to exist the way they appear. These objects are truths for ignorance; they are objects that are taken by ignor­ance to exist the way they appear. For a non-Buddha, only emptinesses exist the way they appear in direct perception and thus emptinesses are the only truth; this does not mean that other phenomena do not exist. Both emptinesses and all other phenomena exist, objects of knowledge - existents -being what are divided into two classes: truths-for-a-concealer and ultimate truths. Empti­nesses are ultimate truths in that they are objects of an ultimate"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"18 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins consciousness and exist the way they appear in direct percep­tion. However, an ultimate consciousness is not the final consciousness, a Buddha's omniscient consciousness, but is a non-conceptual \"reasoning consciousness\", so called because it is gained from having analyzed, through approaches such ·as those mentioned above, whether an object exists from its own side or not Thus, both the clear light nature of the mind and the empti­ness of inherent existence of the mind are the Buddha nature, the nature of the mind that allows for transformation into Buddhahood. The Buddha nature is, therefore, the basis of purification and transformation in that it is that from the company of which defilements are removed. T!'fE. OBJECTS OF PURIFICATION The-defilements that are removed are primarily the two types of distortion just mentioned; they are called afflictive obstruc­tions and obstructions to omniscience. The afflictive obstruc­tions prevent liberation from cyclic existence, the round of powerless, repeated birth, aging, sickness, and death. The primary afflictive obstruction is the igorance conceiving that phenomena - persons and other phenomena - inherently exist, but also included are the unsalutory consciousnesses that such ignorance induces - desire, hatred, pride, enmity, belligerence, miserliness, laziness, and so forth. All of these depend on ignorance for their very existence; without ignor­ance and with wisdom they cannot exist. They are called afflictions (nyon mongs, klesha) because they afflict, they dis­tort oneself. The most common illustration is the distortion of the face that anger brings about, but not just desire and hatred are afflictions/distortions; ignorance is the basic affliction. It is the basic bondage, the basic distortion. From its super­imposition of an exaggerated status of phenomena, and entirely dependent upon it, the other distortions arise, seeming to be in the very fabric of life but actually not. An even deeper distortion is the second type of object to be purified, the obstructions to omniscience. This is described as the appearance of objects as inherently existent and can only"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Altruistic Purification 19 be removed after the afflictive obstructions have been eradi­cated. Since the primary motivation of Bodhisattvas is to help others, they mainly want to remove the obstructions to omnis­cience, for these are what prevent full knowledge of liberative techniques and subtle knowledge of others' minds; however, they must first remove the afflictive obstructions, subsequent to which they can gradually do away with the basic false appearance of phenomena that prevents, obstructs, and hin­ders knowledge of all. THE MEANS OF PURIFICATION Based on its twofold analysis of the nature of the mind, Great Vehicle Buddhism holds the belief that these basic errors can be removed. However, discussion, dialogue, and argument are not sufficient for their removal. Although discussion and so forth are important aspects of many persons' gaining the wisdom that phenomena do not inherently exist, realization that arises merely from such is not sufficient. A powerfully concentrated mind is also necessary. The path of developing a wisdom consciousness realizing the absence of inherent exis­tence to the point where it can serve as an actual antidote to the afflictive obstructions depends upon developing one­pointed concentration and then alternating such one-pointed, fixed concentration with analytical meditation so that even­tually analytical meditation, rather than harming stabilizing meditation, serves to induce a greater degree of stabilizing meditation, and vice versa. It is said that a calm abiding of the mind- a stability of mind-that is induced, not by stabilizing meditation, but by analytical meditation, far exceeds that induced only by stabilizing meditation. Still, such a meditative stabilization that is a union of calm abiding and special insight is also not sufficient. The empti­ness of inherent existence, which is the object of this con­sciousness of meditative stabilization, is being seen through the medium of a conceptual image called a meaning-generality. Gradually, the meaning-generality of emptiness is removed, one's consciousness and the emptiness of inherent existence that is its object become less and less dualistic, and finally one"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"20 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins achieves direct perception of emptiness i(l a totally non-dual­istic cognition. It is non-dualistic in five senses: 1 there is no conceptual appearance 2 there is no sense of subject and object- subject and object are like fresh water poured into fresh water 3 there is no appearance of inherent existence 4 there is no appearance of conventional phenomena; only emptiness appears 5 there is no appearance of difference- although the empti­nesses of all phenomena in all world systems appear, they do not appear to be different. 12 Even this degree of perception of emptiness only removes artificially gained afflictive obstructions, that is, apprehen­sions of inherent existence gained through the fortification of study, analysis, and systems of philosophy. It is not sufficiently powerful to remove the innate afflictive obstructions - the ignorance, desire, and so forth that even animals and babies have, For this, repeated meditation on the reality already seen is needed; one must re-enter direct perception of emptiness again and again. Much like washing dirty clothing, the grosser levels of dirt are cleansed first, and then gradually the more subtle. In time, all of the afflictive obstructions are removed, but this process is not sufficient to remove the obstructions to omniscience, which are primarily the appearance of objects as if they exist in their own right and the predispositions in the mind that bring about this false appearance. The same wisdom consciousness must be sufficiently empowered and enhanced through the Bodhisattva practice of the altruistic deeds of giving, ethics, and patience in what are described as limitless ways over a limitless period of time. Attitudes of altruism and the concordant deeds that such motivation induces finally somehow empower the wisdom consciousness so that it can remove the basic distortion, the false appearance of pheno­mena. In the sutra system presentations, this entire process is said to take three periods of \"countless\" eons. In Highest Yoga Tantra, it is greatly enhanced through utilizing subtler"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Altruistic Purification 21 levels of consciousness such that Buddhahood can be accom­plished in one lifetime. THE FRUITS OF PURIFICATION Although in this way the distortions of desire, hatred, and the ignorance conceiving objects to exist in their own right are removed, love, compassion, faith, and so forth are not thereby extricated because they do not depend for their existence on ignorance, no matter how much they may at times become involved with ignorance, afflictive desire, and so forth, and thus they are not removed when ignorance is removed. Love and compassion have valid cognition as their support, and since it is a quality of the mind that, once developed, such mental phenomena do not require the same effort for their production again, they can be developed limitlessly.13 The most basic distortions impeding full development-the obstructions to omniscience that are the appearance of objects as if they exist in their own right-are removed when altruism and altruistic deeds so enhance wisdom that no trace of false appearance remains. In this sense, altruism is in the service of wisdom, but also wisdom is in the service of altruism in that, concordant with Bodhisattvas' fundamental motivation, the full enlightenment gained through this more advanced type of wisdom allows complete, spontaneous, altruistic display in forms more numerous than the sands of the Ganges to help sentient beings in accordance with their interests and dis­positions. Buddhahood is not a state of total non-dualism as was the case with meditative equipoise on emptiness. Out of the five dualisms listed above, three exist in Buddhahood. There is no conceptual appearance, but there is a sense of subject and object in terms of realizing conventional phenomena, although not in the perspective of the omniscient consciousness's real­ization of emptiness, which is totally non-dualistic. There is no appearance of inherent existence but conventional pheno­mena appear-it is not that just emptiness appears-and thus there is appearance of difference; both the emptinesses ofall"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"22 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins phenomena in all world systems appear and those pheno­mena also appear. Within totally non-dual realization of the emptiness of inherent existence, a Buddha also perceives con­ventional phenomena, acting in myriad ways to bring about others' attainment of the same state. This is freedom from bondage and freedom for effective altruistic endeavor."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2 Deity Yoga: The Special Tantric Technique Because people are of different capacities, dispositions,· and interests, Shakyamuni Buddha taught many different paths.14 He set forth sutra and tantra; within sutra, he taught· four different schools of tenets -Great Exposition School, Sutra School, Mind Only School, and Middle Way School- and within tantra, he set out four different sets of tantras-Action, Performance, Yoga, and Highest Yoga (literally \"Unsurpassed Yoga\").15 Within the four schools of the sutra system he described three varieties of paths - for Hearers, 16 Solitary Realizex:s, 17 and Bodhisattvas.

THE DIFfERENCE BETWEEN THE S0TRA VEHICLES ' \"'Vehicle\" (theg pa, yiina) has two meanings: 1· Since ya means to go, and na indicates the means of going, a vehicle is comprised of those practices which carry one to a higher state-those practices which when actualized in the mental continuum cause manifestation of a higher type of mind. 2 Somewhat unusually, \"vehicle\" can also refer to the desti­nation -that place or state at which one is aiming. This is because just as a vehicle can bear or carry a certain load, so the state of Buddhahood-the goal of the Bodhisattva Vehicle ' -can bear or carry the welfare of all sentient beings, whereas · the state of a Low Vehicle Foe Destroyer (dgra bcom pa, arhan)19 can bear much less. 20 Since \"vehicle\" has these two meanings, the distinction be­tween the two Buddhist Vehicles- Hearer and Solitary Rea­lizer (being Low Vehicle) and Bodhisattva (or Great Vehicle)­must occur either within the sense of vehicle as the means by which one progresses or within the sense of vehicle as the destination or state to which one is progressing, or both. Irr the interpretation of Low Vehicle and Great Vehicle according to the Middle Way Consequence School,21 con­sidered to be the acme of philosophical systems by most , Tibetan schools, there is a tremendous difference between the tWo in the sense of vehicle as that to which one is progressing. In the Low Vehicle, practice culminates in one's becoming a Foe Destroyer, one who has overcome the foe of ignorance but ·'is hot omniscient and thus is not a Buddha. Unlike a Buddha, ·a Foe Destroyer does not have the ability spontaneously to manifest in various forms in order to help all beings. Since the states of being a Buddha and a Foe Destroyer are very differ­ent. there is a significant difference between the Low and Great Vehicles in the sense of vehicle as that to which one is"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Deity Yoga 25 progressing: the respective goals of Buddhahood and Foe Destroyer hood. With this difference in goal, there must also be a difference in the two vehicles in the sense of. the practices by which one progresses to these goals. The difference between the Low and Great Vehicles in terms of the means of progress can occur in only two places-method or wisdom, these two comprising the entire path, in that method mainly produces the Form Body of a Buddha and wisdom mainly produces the Truth Body. 22 In the Consequence School's interpretation, the Low and Great Vehicles do not differ with respect to wisdom in that both require realization of the subtle emptiness of in­herent existence of all phenomena such as body, mind, head, eye, wall, consciousness, etc. 23 Although the Low and Great Vehicles do differ in terms of how wisdom is cultivated-how many reasonings one uses for getting at the subtle emptiness, Bodhisattvas using myriad reasonings and Hearers and Soli­tary Realizers only a few24 - in terms of the object of the wisdom consciousness, the subtle emptiness of inherent exis­tence, there is no difference between the emptiness a Low Vehicle practitioner realizes and the emptiness a Mahayanist realizes. In this sense there is no difference in wisdom. Since wisdom in the Low and Great Vehicles does not differ in terms of the type of emptiness being cognized, the differ­ence between the two vehicles must lie in method. 25 \"Method\" here specifically means motivation and the deeds that it impels. No matter how much compassion a Low Vehicle prac­titioner may have, his or her primary motivation is to release oneself from cyclic existence26. However, in the Great Vehicle the primary motivation is the altruistic aspiration to highest enlightenment27 induced by great love and compassion in which one takes on the burden of the welfare of all beings. Thus, there is a significant difference between the Low and Great Vehicles in terms of method, even though not in wisdom.28 Hence, the Low and Great Vehicles differ in both senses of vehicle, as the means by which one progresses as well as that to which one progresses."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"26 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PERFECTION VEHICLE AND THE MANTRA VEHICLE In the Great Vehicle itself, there are two vehicles-the Perfec­tion Vehicle and the Mantra (or Tantra) Vehicle. 29 The Perfec­tion Vehicle is sutra Great Vehicle, and the Mantra Vehicle is mantra or tantra Great Vehicle. Do the sutra Great Vehicle and the tantra Great Vehicle differ in the sense of vehicle as that to which one is progres­sing? The goal of the sutra Great Vehicle is Buddhahood, and Tantrayana cannot have another goal separate from Buddha­hood as there is no attainment higher than the Buddhahood that is described in sutra as attainment of the Truth and Form Bodies. Sutra describes a Buddha as a being who has removed all obstructions and attained all auspicious attributes, a being who has no movement of coarse winds or inner energies;30 thus such Buddhahood has to include the attainments of even Highest Yoga Mantra, 31 the primary aim of which is to stop the movement of all coarse winds and manifest the most subtle consciousness - the mind of clear light - simultan­eously appearing in totally pure form.32 Hence, the Vajra­dharahood often mentioned as the goal of tantra and the Buddhahood described in sutra are the same. 33 There being no difference between the Perfection Vehicle and Mantra Vehicle in terms of the goal- the destination -they must differ in the sense of vehicle as the means by which one progresses. They must differ either in terms of method or wisdom or both. If the difference lay in wisdom, there would be many problems because the Perfection Vehicle contains Nagarjuna's Middle Way teachings on emptiness, and there would have to be some other more subtle emptiness than that which Nagarjuna establishes with many different reasonings in the twenty-seven chapters of his Treatise on the Middle Way (dbu ma'i bstan bcos, madhyamakashiistra), whereas there is none. Thus there is no difference between sutra and tantra in the view, which here refers to the objective view, that is, the object that is viewed (yul gyi Ita ba) -emptiness or ultimate truth -not the realizing consciousness, since sutra Great Vehicle and Highest Yoga Tantra do differ with respect to the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Deity Yoga 27 subtlety of the consciousness realizing emptiness. Specifically, in Higi1est Yo3a Tantras such as the Kiilachakra Tantra, more subtle. enhanced consciousnesses are generated to realize the same emptiness of inherent existence. Still, because the object realized is the same whether the consciousness is more subtle or not, the \"objective view\" is the same.·'4 In this way, between the sutra and tantra Great Vehicles there cJnnnt .be any difference in the factor of wisdom in terms of the object that is understood by a wisdom consciousness. Hence. the difference again has to lie in method. In both the sutra and tantra Great Vehicles, the basis of method is the altruistic intention to become enlightened for the sake of all sentient beings; because of this, the motiva­tional basis of the deeds of the path is the same. The other main factor of method has to do with the deeds induced by that motivation. In sutra Great Vehicle these are the practices induced by the altmistic aspiration-the perfections of giving, ethics, and patience. However, since these are also practiced in tantra, the difference cannot be found there either. Further­more, tantra has an even greater emphasis than sutra on the deeds of the perfections in that a tantric practitioner is com­mitted to engage in them at least six times during each day.35 Moreover, the distinction could not be made on the basis of speed of progress on the path because within the four tantra sets-Action, Performance, Yoga, and Highest Yoga Tantra­there are great differences in speed and in sutra Great Vehicle there are five different modes of progress, slow to fast. In addition, the difference must not lie in some small or insigni­ficant feature, but in an important one36 The profound distinction occurs in the fact that in tantra there is meditation in which one meditates on one's body as similar in aspect to a Buddha's Form Body whereas in sutra Great Vehicle there is no such meditation. This is deity yoga,37 which all four tantra sets have but sutra systems do not.

A Bodhisattva enters into meditative equipoise directly realizing emptiness with nothing appearing to the mind except the final nature of phenomena, the emptiness of inherent existence; the wisdom consciousness is fused with that emptiness. Even though, unlike their tantric counter­parts, sutra Bodhisattvas do not specifically imagine that the stage of meditative equipoise is a Buddha's Truth Body,39 meditation similar in aspect to a Buddha's Truth Body does occur in the sutra system in the sense that the state of medita­tive equipoise on emptiness mimics a Buddha's exalted wis­dom consciousness in its aspect of perceiving the ultimate. However, the sutra Perfection Vehicle does not involve medi­tation similar in aspect to a Buddha's Form Body. There is meditation on Buddhas and so forth as objects of offering, etc., but there is no meditation on oneself in the physical body of a Buddha.40 Such meditative cultivation of a divine body is included within the factor of method because it is mainly aimed at achieving a Buddha's Form Body. In the sutra system the sole means for achieving a Buddha's Form Body is, on the basis of the altruistic intention to become enlightened, to engage in the first three perfections - giving, ethics, and patience -in \"limitless\" ways over a \"limitless\" period of time, specifically three periods of \"countless\" great eons (\"countless\" being said to be a one with fifty-nine zeros). Though the Mantra Vehicle also involves practice of the perfections of giving, ethics, and patience, it is not in \"limitless\" ways over \"limit­less\" periods of time. Despite emphasis on the perfections, practice in \"limitless\" ways over \"limitless\" time is unneces­sary because one is engaging in the additional technique of meditation on oneself in a body similar in aspect to a Buddha's Form Body.41 In other words, in the tantric systems, in order to become a Buddha more quickly, one meditates on oneself as similar in aspect to a Buddha in terms of both body and mind. This practice is significantly distinctive and thus those systems which involve it constitute a separate vehicle, the Tantra Great Vehicle."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Deity Yoga 29 In deity yoga one first meditates on emptiness and then uses that consciousness realizing emptiness - or at least an imitation of it - as the basis of emanation of a Buddha. The wisdom consciousness itself appears as the physical form of a Buddha. This one consciousness thus has two parts- a factor of wisdom and a factor of method, or factors of (1) ascertain­ment of emptiness and (2) appearance as an ideal being- and hence, through the practice of deity yoga, one simultaneously accumulates the collections of merit and wisdom, making their amassing much faster.42 The systems that have this practice are called the Vajra Vehicle because the appearance of a deity is the display of a consciousness that is a fusion of wisdom understanding emptiness and compassion seeking the welfare of others- an inseparable union symbolized by a vajra, a diamond, the foremost of stones as it is \"unbreakable\". 43 Since the two elements of the fusion- compassionate method and penetrat­ing wisdom- are the very core of the Perfection Vehicle, one can understand that siitra and tantra, despite being different, are integrated systems. One can understand that compassion is not superseded by but essential to tantra and that the wisdom of the Perfection Vehicle is not forsaken for a deeper understanding of reality in the Tantra Vehicle. Summary Let us summarize the points made in this discussion. The difference between the vehicles must lie in the sense of vehicl� as that by which one progresses or that to which one pro­gresses. The Low Vehicle differs from the Great Vehicle in both. The destination of the lower one is the state of a Hearer or Solitary Realizer Foe Destroyer and of the higher one, Buddhahood. Concerning \"vehicle\" in the sense of means by which one progresses, although there is no difference in the wisdom realizing the subtlest nature of phenomena, there is a difference in method - Low Vehicle not having and Great Vehicle having the altruistic mind of enlightenment (that is, the altruistic intention to become enlightened) and its attend­ant deeds.

With­� method they differ not in the basis or motivation of the · deeds, the altruistic intention to become enlightened, nor in · having the perfections as deeds, but in the additional tech­nique of deity yoga. A deity is a suprarnundane being who himself or herself is a manifestation of compassion and wis­dom .. Thus, in the special practice of deity yoga one joins one's own body, speech, mind, and activities with the exalted body, speech, mind, and activities of a supramundane being, manifesting on the path a similitude of the state of the effect. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FOUR T ANTRA SETS Within the Mantra Vehicle, there are many ways of differen­tiating varying numbers of tantra sets. Dzong-ka-ba, in his CreatExposition of Secret Mantra, follows a system of division into four tantra sets - Action Tantra, Performance Tantra, Yoga Tantra, and Highest Yoga Tantra.44 These four are dif­fe.tentiated not (1) by way of their object of intent since all four ate aimed at bringing about others' welfare, nor (2) by way of the object of attainment they are seeking since all four seek the full enlightenment of Buddhahood, nor (3) by way of merely having different types of deity yoga since all four have many different types of deity yoga but are each only one tantra set. Some say that the four tantra sets are for the different castes; however, the trainees of all four tantra sets are drawn from all levels of society, and, furthermore, not all persons of any level of society are suitable as practitioners of tantra. Others say that the four tantra sets are for persons following particular non-Buddhist deities; however, it is not necessary to take up a non-Buddhist system that has what, for Buddhism, is a wrong view on the status of persons and other phenomena before entering into the Mantra Vehicle; also, absurdly, someone wh9 initially assumed Nagarjuna's view of the emptiness of ml\\erent existence could not be a main trainee of any tantra set if it we� neceS$ary first to assume a wrong view."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Deity Yoga 31 Others, seeing that tantra involves the usage of desire, hatred, and ignorance in the path in order to overcome those and seeing that practices are geared for persons having one or the other affliction predominant among their negative states, say that the four tantra sets are for persons dominated by particular types of afflictive emotions. However, although a certain afflictive emotion in a tantric practitioner may be predominant in the sense of being stronger than the other afflictive emotions, tantrists are simply not dominated by afflictive emotions. Rather, they are especially motivated by compassion, intent on the quickest means of attaining highest enlightenment in order to be of service to others. With regard to trainees of Highest Yoga Tantra, the Seventh Dalai Lama Gel-sang-gya-tso (bskal bzang rgya mtsho, 1708-57) says in his Explanation of the Rite of the Guhyasamaja Mandala (gsang 'dus dkyil 'khor cho ga'i rnam bshad):45 Some see that if they rely on the Perfection Vehicle and so forth, they must amass the collections [of merit and wisdom] for three countless great eons, and thus it would take a long time and involve great difficulty. They cannot bear such hardship and seek to attain Buddhahood in a short time and by a path with little difficulty. These people who claim that they, therefore, are engaging in the short path of the Secret Mantra Vehicle are [actually] outside the realm of Mantra trainees. For to be a person of the Great Vehicle in general one cannot seek peace for oneself alone but, from the viewpoint of holding others more dear than oneself, must be able, for the sake of the welfare of others, to bear whatever type of hardship or suffering might arise. Since Secret Mantrikas are those of extremely sharp faculties within followers of the Great Vehicle, persons who have turned their backs on others' welfare and want little difficulty for themselves are not even close to the quarter of Highest Secret mantra ...

Rather, the quicker path is sought due to being particularly moved by compassion; a Mantra practitioner wants to achieve enlightenment sooner in order more quickly to be of service to others. The Dalai Lama has said in public lecture that proper contemplation of the difficulties and length of the Sutra path generates greater determination and courage; this must be because contemplat­ing one's own altruistic activity over great periods of time undermines the thresholds of impatience, anger, and dis­couragement. It is a ridiculous position that the trainees of Mantra, who are supposed to be the sharpest of all Bodhi­sattvas, would be discouraged in the face of a long path and, from that depression, seek a short path. The altruism of Mantrikas is even more intense than that of practitioners of the Perfection Vehicle. In this vein, Dzong-ka-ba, in refuting the position of the Indian scholar Ala�akalasha that the Guhyasamiija Tantra is taught to those in the merchant caste whose desire and hatred are great but whose ignorance is slight, says:46 In general, the chief trainees of the Great Vehicle must have strong compassion. In particular, the chief trainees of Highest Yoga wish to attain Bud­dhahood extremely quickly in order to accomplish the welfare of others due to their being highly moved by great compassion. Therefore, it is non­sense to propound that they must have very great hatred. Similarly, the Mongolian savant Jang-gya Rol-bay-dor-jay (Ieang skya rol pa'i rdo rje, 1717-86) says in his Clear Exposition"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Deity Yoga 33 of the Presentations of Tenets, Beautiful Ornament for the Meru of the Subduer's Teaching (grub pa'i mtha'i rnam par bzhag-pa gsal bar bshad pa thub bstan /hun po'i mdzes rgyan):41 It is said in the precious tantras and in many com­mentaries that even those trainees of the Mantra Vehicle who have low faculties must have far greater compassion, sharper faculties, and a superior lot than the trainees of sharpest faculties in the Perfec­tion Vehicle. Therefore, those who think and pro­pound that the Mantra Vehicle was taught for persons discouraged about achieving enlighten­ment over a long time and with great difficulty make clear that they have no penetration of the . meaning of tantra. Furthermore, the statement that the Mantra Vehicle is quicker than the Perfection Vehicle is in relation to trainees who are suitable vessels, not in terms of just anyone. Therefore, it is not sufficient that the doctrine be the Mantra Vehicle; the person must be properly engaged in the Mantra Vehicle. Far from being taught for those who are unable to proceed on the Perfection Vehicle, the four tantras were expounded for persons of particularly great compassion, and thus the posi­tion that the four tantra sets are for persons dominated by different types of afflictive emotions such as desire or hatred is impossible. Others say that the four tantra sets are for persons holding the views of the four schools of Buddhist tenets. This position is equally unfounded since the Mantra Vehicle is part of the Great Vehicle both from the viewpoint of school of tenet- the view of the Mind Only School or of the Middle Way School being required - and from the viewpoint of path, a Bodhi­sattva's altruism being necessary. 48 Rather, the four tantra sets are differentiated by way of their main trainees being of four very different types. Their main trainees have (1) four different ways of using desire for the attributes of the Desire Realm in the path and (2) four different"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"34 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins levels of capacity for generating the emptiness and deity yogas that use desire in the path. 1 Four Ways of Using Desire in the Path Based on descriptions of the four tantra sets found in Highest Yoga Tantras, it is said that in Action Tantra the desire in­volved in male and female looking or gazing at each other is used in the path; in Performance Tantra the desire involved in male and female smiling at each other is used in the path; in Yoga Tantra the desire involved in male and female embrac­ing and touching each other is used in the path, and in Highest Yoga Tantra the desire involved in sexual union is used in the path. When desire arising from looking, smiling, holding hands or embracing, and sexual union is used in the path in conjunction with emptiness and deity yogas, desire itself is extinguished. Specifically, desire such as for sexual union leads to sexual union and, thereby, the generation of a blissfully withdrawn consciousness that the practitioner then uses to realize emptiness. The realization of the emptiness of inherent existence, in turn, destroys the possibility of desire. The process is compared to a worm's being born from moist wood.and then turning around and eating the wood. In put­ting together the example and the exemplified, the wood is desire; the worm is the blissful consciousness; the consump­tion of the wood is the blissful consciousness's destruction of desire through realizing emptiness. The reason why a blissful consciousness is used is that it is more intense, and thus . realization of emptiness by such a consciousness is more powerful. The process is most easily explained in Highest Yoga Tantra. In Highest Yoga Tantra, consciousnesses are divided into the gross; the subtle, and the very subtle. According to the system of the Guhyasamaja Tantra, a Highest Yoga Tantra that is parallel in importance to the Kiilachakra Tantra, the most subtle is called the fundamental innate mind of clear light; the subtle are three levels of consciousness called the minds of radiant white, red (or orange), and black appearance; the �oss are· the five sense consciousnesses and the mental con-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Deity Yoga 35 sciousness when not manifesting one of the above subtler levels. Through stopping the gross levels of consciousness, the more subtle become manifest. The first to manifest is a mind of radiant white appearance (\"radiant\" means vivid, not radiating from a center to the outside) that is described as like a clear· night sky filled with moonlight, not the moon shining in empty space but space filled with white light. All conceptuality has ceased, and nothing appears except this radiant white appearance. When that mind ceases, a more subtle mind of radiant red or orange increase dawns; this is compared to a clear sky filled with sunlight, again not the sun shining in the sky but space filled with red or orange light. When this mind ceases, a still more subtle mind of radiant black near-attainment dawns; it is called \"near-attainment\" because one is close to manifesting the mind of clear light. The mind of black near-attainment is compared to a moonless, very black sky just after dusk when no stars shine; during the first part of this phase it is said that one remains conscious but then becomes unconscious in thick blackness. Then, with the three pollutants of the white, red, black appearances cleared away, the mind of clear light dawns; it is the most subtle level of consciousness. The various systems .of Highest Yoga Tantra seek to mani­fest the mind of clear light, also called the fundamental innate mind of clear light, by way of different techniques. One of these techniques is to use blissful orgasm (but without emis­sion) to withdraw the grosser levels of consciousness, thereby manifesting the most subtle level of mind. This very powerful and subtle mind is then used to realize the emptiness of inherent existence, thereby enhancing the power of the path­consciousness realizing emptiness so that it is more effective in overcoming the obstructions to liberation and the obstruc­tions to omniscience. This is how the desire for sexual union is used in the path in Highest Yoga Tantra; in this tantra set, the usage of desire in the path is explicitly for the sake of enhancing the wisdom consciousness realizing emptiness by way of actually generating subtler and thus more powerful consciousnesses that realize it. The difficulty of using an"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"36 The Killachakra Ta ntra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins orgasmic blissful consciousness to realize anything indicates that it would take a person of great psychological develop­ment and capacity to be able to utilize such a subtle state in the path. It also indicates how, without the contextualization of how and why sexual union is used in the path, the practice could be mis-used or misinterpreted. In the three lower tantras, it is said that even though such subtler consciousnesses are not generated from the desire involved in looking, smiling, and touching, the blissful con­sciousnesses that are generated are nevertheless used in re­alizing emptiness. In this way, the Mongolian scholar Nga­wang-bel-den (ngag dbang dpal /dan, born 1797) says in his Presentation of the Grounds and Paths of the Four Great Secret Tantra Sets, Illumination of the Texts of Tantra (gsang chen rgyud sde bzhi'i sa lam gyi rnam bzhag rgyud gzhung gsa/ byed):49 The three lower tantras involve using in the path the bliss that arises upon looking at, smiling at, and holding hands with or embracing a meditated Knowledge Woman [consort]; however, this is not done for the sake of generating a special subject [a subtle consciousness] realizing emptiness, for such is a distinguishing feature only of Highest Yoga Tantra. Nonetheless, most of [Dzong-ka-ba's] followers explain that this does not mean that the bliss [consciousness] that arises upon looking, smiling, and so forth does not realize emptiness. The utilization of the subtlest level of consciousness allows Highest Yoga Tantra to be faster for someone who is capable of practicing it, and thus only through Highest Yoga Tantra is it possible to achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime. 2 Four Capacities for Practice In addition to the four different ways of using desire for the attributes of the Desire Realm in the path, the four tantra sets correspond to four different levels of capacity for generating the emptiness and deity yogas that use desire in the path. The tantric path centers around emptiness yoga and deity yoga, and practitioners have different needs or mind-sets with rela-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Deity Yoga 37 tion to successfully implementing these yogas. Those who make use of a great many external activities in actualizing emptiness and deity yogas are trainees of Action Tantra. However, this does not mean that Action Tantra lacks yoga, for it has a complex and very powerful yoga for developing a meditative stabilization that is a union of calm abiding and special insight;50 rather, it means that the main trainees of Action Tantra also engage in many ritual activities such as bathing, for they find that these activities enhance their medi­tation. Those who equally perform external activities and internal meditative stabilization are trainees of Performance Tantra; those who mainly rely on meditative stabilization and use only a few external activities are trainees of Yoga Tantra. Those who do not make use of external activities and yet have the capacity to generate the yoga of which there is none higher are trainees of Highest Yoga Tantra. · Still, Highest Yoga Tantra involves a great deal of ritual as will be seen in the initiation ritual and daily practice rite translated in this book; the point being made here perhaps is that Highest Yoga Tantra does not involve ritual bathing and so forth in the way that Action Tantra, etc., do. · This division of the four tantra sets by way of the capacity of their main trainees refers to their ability to generate the main · yogas - the emptiness and deity yogas - of their respective systems within an emphasis on external activities, with balanced emphasis on external activities and internal medita­tive stabilization, with emphasis on meditative stabilization, and with no such external activities. The division is not made merely by way of persons who are interested in such paths, for some persons become interested in paths that they do not presently have a capacity to practice. As Dzong-ka-ba says:51 Also, though trainees in general are more, or less, interested in external activities and in cultivation · of yoga, there are instances of interest in a path that does not fit a person's faculties; thus, the main trainees of the four tantra sets cannot be identified through interest."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"38 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins SUMMATION The distinctive tantric practice of deity yoga, motivated by great compassion and beginning with emptiness yoga, is carried out in different ways in the four tantra sets.

The techniques are geared to the levels of capacity of trainees as they proceed in their practice over the continuum of life­times, the variety of vehicles and forms being a representation of Buddha's compassionate knowledge.

Therefore, it is customary for a lama, preceding an initiation, to lecture on the stages of the path common to both the sutra and tantra paths. At the Kalachakra initiation in Madison in 1981, His Holiness the Dalai Lama first lectured for three days in a large auditorium on recognition of the suffering nature of life, generation of an altruistic intention to become enlightened, and the view of the emptiness of inherent existence. An eloquent example of this type of teaching, necessary and integral to tantric practice (not just a precursor) is to be found in the Dalai Lama's Kindness, Clarity, And Insight52 in the chapter entitled \"The Path to Enlightenment\" (pp.118-156). The emphasis on recognizing suffering and generating compassion is not just brought over from sutra practice but is essential to tantra itself.

All these transmigrating beings, deluded by illu-sion, grasp suffering from suffering. (For the Dalai Lama's commentary on this, see pp. 196-197) Also, the compiler of the tantra, Manjushnl<irti, illustrates his compassion with protective wishes: 53 And: And: Just as those of the lineage of sages along with Ravi came to attain knowledge-wisdom from this [tantra], So may sentient beings dwelling in the three forms of cyclic existence become the same through the kindness of the Kiilachakra [Tantra]. In just the way that my mind-vajra dwells through­out the earth for the sake of liberating sentient beings, So may it dwell in the three forms of cyclic existence of sentient beings through the force of Kala­chakra. May the Bodhisattvas above [the earth] who supremely frighten the demi-gods dwelling in the class of demons, The wrathful kings as well as their consorts who dwell in the directions and intermediate direc­tions in the worlds of humans, And the kings of hooded serpents under the earth who at all times bind up the groups of evil spirits and unvirtuous ones -May all of them protect unknowing worldly beings in all respects each day."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Motivation 41 Still, despite the fact that compassion is the basic motiva­tion for the practice of tantra and integral to its practice, the best presentations of how to cultivate compassion are found in the Sutra Great Vehicle.

Otherwise, innate false superimpositions on phenomena of a goodness or badness beyond that which they actually have will lead to the biased and distorted states of desire and hatred. The process of culti­vating such wisdom involves meditating on the selflessness of persons and on the selflessness of other phenomena. The following description of these practices is based, for the most part, on the concise and lucid explanation of the perfection of wisdom in the Fifth Dalai Lama's Sacred Word of Mailjushri ('jam dpal zhallung). 54 Meditation on both the selflessness of persons and of phenomena is framed around four essential steps: 1 ascertaining what is being negated 2 ascertaining entailment 3 ascertaining that the object designated and its basis of desig­nation are not inherently one 4 ascertaining that the object designated and its basis of desig­nation are not inherently different. FIRST ESSENTIAL: ASCERTAINING WHAT IS BEING NEGATED With respect to the selflessness of a person, specifically of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Emptiness Yoga 49 yourself, the first step is to identify the way we innately misconceive the I to exist inherently. If you do not have a fairly clear sense of an inherently existent I, you will mistake the refutation as negating the I itself rather than a specific reifica­tion of the I. Shantideva's Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds (byang chub sems dpa'i spyod pa Ia 'jug pa, bodhisattvacharyii­vatiira, IX.140) says: Without contacting the superimposed existent, Its non-existence cannot be apprehended. If an image of the object of negation does not appear well to the mind, the meaning of the selflessness that negates it cannot be ascertained. The Ge-luk-ba order of Tibetan Buddhism makes a clear differentiation between the existent self and the non-existent self as it is posited in each of the four major Buddhist schools of tenets-Great Exposition School, Sutra School, Mind Only School, and Middle Way School. This assumes a dual meaning to the term \"self\"-the first, existent one as the person or I and the second, non-existent one as a reification of the status of any object, the reification here being inherent existence (rang bzhin gyis grub pa, svabhiivaszddhi). This distinction is upheld through the observation that when the I is apprehended, there are basically three possibil­ities with respect to how it is being conceived in relation to the other meaning of \"self\", inherent existence: 1 You may be conceiving the I to be inherently existent. 2 Or, if you have understood the view of the Middle Way School, you may conceive the I as only being nominally existent. 3 Or, whether you have understood the view of the Middle Way School or not, you may conceive the I without qualify­ing it with either inherent existence or an absence of in­herent existence. Though uneducated common beings do not propound either inherent existence or nominal imputation, the I does appear to them to be inherently existent, and because they sometimes assent to that appearance - though without reasoning - they"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"50 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins also have a conception of an inherently existent L Also, they, like all other beings, even including those who have been educated in wrong systems of tenets, have consciousnesses that do not engage in conceptions of inherent existence, such as when just conceiving of themselves without any particular attention. Therefore, it is not that all consciousnesses conceiv­ing I in the continuum of a falsely educated person are wrong or that all consciousnesses conceiving I in the continuum of uneducated persons are right. Rather, both the uneducated and the falsely educated have the misconception of an in­herently existent I as well as consciousness conceiving an I that is not qualified by being either nominally imputed or inherently existent. Still, neither the falsely educated nor the uneducated can distinguish between an imputedly existent I and an inherently existent I. Both must become educated in the Middle Way view of non-inherent existence and imputed existence in order to overcome their innate tendency to assent to the false appearance of the I as if inherently existent, existing from its own side, or existing under its own power. This is the imme­diate purpose of meditation on selflessness. The first step in this meditation is to gain a clear sense of the reified status of the I as inherently existent. Even though such a misconception of I is subliminally always present, a condi­tion of its obvious manifestation is required. Therefore, the ·meditator remembers a situation of false accusation that eli-cited a strong response or remembers a situation of happiness that did the same, trying to watch the type of I that manifested and how the mind assented to its ever so concrete appearance. Since watchfulness itself tends to cause this gross level of misconception of the I as inherently existent to disappear, the first essential is recognized as very difficult to achieve. One has to learn how to let the mind operate in its usual egoistic way and at the same time watch it, keeping watchfulness at a minimum such that the usual conception of a very concrete and pointable I is generated. The demand for watchfulness is mitigated by the need to allow what is usually unanalyzed to operate of its own accord. When success is gained, the meditator has found a sense of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Emptiness Yoga 51 an inherently existent I that is totally convincing. As the Dalai Lama said while lecturing to Tibetan scholars in Dharamsala, India, in 1972, one has such strong belief in this reified I that upon identifying it, one has the feeling that if it is not true, nothing is. It would seem, therefore, that the first step in developing the view of the Middle Way is the stark and intimate recognition that for the meditator the opposite of that view seems to be true. In the face of this particular consciousness, mind and body are not differentiated, and the I is not differentiated from mind and body. However, the I is seen to be self-established, self-instituting, under its own power, existing in its own right. It is not that you have the sense that mind, body, and I cannot be differentiated; rather, for that consciousness, mind, body, and I simply are not differentiated. For instance, for ·a consciousness merely apprehending a particular city, say, Chicago, the ground, buildings, and people of that city are not differentiated. These are the bases of designation of ChiCago, which seems inextricably blended with them and yet has its own thing. Recognition of such an appearance with respect to the I and recognition of your assent to this appearance constitute the first essential step in realizing selflessness, emptiness. With this identification, analysis can work on that object; without it, analysis is undirected. From the viewpoint of the Ge-luk­ba tradition of Tibetan Buddhism it would seem that most Western attempts to penetrate emptiness fail at this initial step, tending either to assume that the phenomenon itself is being refuted or that a superficial, philosophically constructed quality of the phenomenon, rather than one innately miscon� ceived, is being refuted. SECOND ESSENTIAL: ASCERTAINING ENTAILMENT Whereas in the first step the meditator allows an ordinary attitude to operate and attempts to watch it without interfer­ing, in the second step the meditator makes a non-ordinary, intellectual decision that must be brought gradually to the level of feeling. Here, you consider the number of possible"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"52 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins relationships between a phenomenon designated and its basis of designation. Phenomena designated are things such as a table, a body, a person, and a house. Their respective bases of designation are four legs and a top, five limbs (two arms, two legs, and a head) and a trunk, or mind and body, and a number of rooms arranged in a certain shape. The meditator considers whether within the framework of inherent existence these two -phenomenon designated and basis of designation -must be either inherently the same or inherently different or whether there are other possibilities. If there seem to be other possi­bilities, can these be collapsed into the original two - being inherently the same or being inherently different? Nagarjuna is interpreted as listing five possibilities and Chandrakirti two more beyond the five: 1 inherently the same 2 inherently different 3 the object designated inherently depends on the basis of designation 4 the basis of designation inherently depends on the object designated 5 the object designated possesses the basis of designation either as a different entity in the way a person owns a cow or as one entity in the way a tree possesses its core 6 the object designated is the special shape of the basis of designation 7 ·the object designated is the collection of the bases of desig-nation. The last five can be collapsed into the first two as refinements of them: The third and fourth are forms of difference; the first aspect of the fifth is a form of difference; the second, a form of sameness of entity; the sixth and seventh are variations of sameness. Hence, it is claimed that all possibilities of inherent existence can be collapsed into the original two. Conventionally, however, it is said that the I and its basis of designation, mind and body, are different, but not different entities, and the same entity but not the same. This is tech­nically called being one entity and different isolates 55 -essen-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Emptiness Yoga 53 tially meaning that conceptuality can isolate the two. Why not consider this an eighth possibility? If the relationship of being one entity and different isolates is within the context of inherent existence, then this possibility is internally contradictory since within the context of inherent existence whatever is inherently the same is the same in all respects, making different isolates impossible. However, if the relationship of being one entity and different isolates is within the context of conventional existence, then there is no need to include it here in this list of possibilities within inherent existence. The list of possibilities, therefore, does not include all pos­sibilities of the existence of a phenomenon designated- such as the I-and its bases of designation- such as mind and body -because the examination here is concerned only with whether the I exists in the concrete manner it was seen to have during the first essential. If it does exist so concretely, you should be able to point concretely to it when examining it with respect to its basis of designation. Since this decision - that inherent existence involves the necessity of the phenomenon designated being either one with or different from the basis of designation - is the anvil on which the sense of an inherently existent I will be pounded by the hammer of the subsequent reasoning, the second essential is not an intellectually airy decision to be taken lightly. It must be brought to the level of feeling, this being done through considering that anything existent is either one or different, as the great eighteenth century Mongolian scholar jang-gya (Ieang skya rol pa'i rdo rje, 1717-86) says in his Presentation of Tenets (grub mtha'i rnam bzhag.)56 A chair is one; a chair and a table are different; a chair and its parts are different; tables are different, etc. The yogi must heroically set standards that intelligently limit the possibilities so that the subsequent analysis can work, causing disbelief in such an inherently existent I. Upon coming to this decision, you begin to doubt the existence of the self-instituting I identified in the first essen­tial.

The emotionally harrowing experience of challenging your own long believed status has begun. THIRD ESSENTIAL: ASCERTAINING THAT THE I AND THE AGGREGATES ARE NOT ONE The next step is to use reasoning to determine whether the I and the mental and physical aggregates could be inherently the same or inherently different. Reasoning, here, is a matter not of cold deliberation or superficial summation but of using various approaches to find one that can shake yourself to your being. Since this is the case, the seeming simple-mindedness and rigidity of the reasonings suggested must be transcended. A series of approaches, rather than just one reasoning, is used on the assumption that certain of the reasonings would not work for some people. The first is a challenge from com­mon experience: If the I were one with the body, how could we speak of \"my body\"? If the I were inherently one with the mind, how could we speak of \"my mind\"? Should we also speak of the body's body? Or my I? Still, the Fifth Dalai Lama does not seem to expect that this will be sufficient; he continues with a citation from Nagarjuna on the same reasoning: If, upon thinking thus, [your attempt at under­standing] is merely verbal and you do not gain strong conviction, contemplate the following. Nagarjuna's Treatise on the Middle Way (rlsa shes/ dbu ma'i bstan bcos, madhyamakashiistra, XXVII.27) says: When it is taken that there is no self Except the appropriated [aggregates], The appropriated [aggregates] themselves are the self. If so, your self is non-existent. The interpretation among Ge-luk-ba scholars is not that Nagarjuna thought that beings commonly conceive the I to be"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Emptiness Yoga 55 one with body or one with mind. Rather, his thought is that if the I inherently exists, then oneness with its basis of desig­nation would be one of only two exhaustive possibilities. Nagarjuna's reference is not to ordinary misconception but to a consequence of inherent existence, such concreteness requir­ing a pointable identification under analysis. The rules for inherent existence, therefore, are not the rules for mere existence. Within the context of concrete existence, sameness of entity requires utter oneness in all respects. Thus, the question is not whether beings ordinarily conceive of such oneness, since it is not claimed that we do, but whether the rules of concrete, pointable existence- the way we experi­ence the I as was discovered in the first essential - are appro­priate. More Reasonings Permutations of the same reasoning need to be considered; the mere presence of the reasoning is clearly not expected to be convincing. For these permutations to work, the meditator must have gained belief in rebirth. If the I and the body are one, after death when the body is burned, the I also would be burned. Or, just as the I transmigrates to the next life, so the body also would have to transmigrate. Or, just as the body does not transmigrate, so the I also would not transmigrate. If due to having meditated on such reasonings, you come to think that the I is probably not the same as the body but is probably one with the mind, you are instructed to consider the following fallacies. Since it is obvious that the suffering of cold arises when the I is without clothes and that the suffer­ings of hunger and thirst arise when the I lacks food and drink, these would- if the I were merely mental -be mental in origin, in which case you could not posit a reason why the same suffering would not be experienced in a life in a Formless Realm. Since the mind would be one with the I, it would still have to make use of gross forms such as food and clothing. The above permutations of oneness will have prepared the mind for reaching a conclusion upon reflecting on a few more reasonings. First, the selves would have to be as many as mind and body, that is to say, two; or, put another way, the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"56 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins selves would have to be as many as the five aggregates, five. This may seem extraordinarily simple-minded, but the requirements of such pointable, analyticil.lly findable exis­tence- not the requirements of mere existence- are the anvil. The meditator is attempting through this analysis, not to describe how he or she ordinarily conceives such an inherently existent I, but to subject such an I to the hammering of probing reasoning based on consequences of such inherent existence. The second additional reasoning revolves around the en­tailment that the I would have inherently existent production and disintegration, in which case it would be discontinuous. The third depends upon a belief in rebirth and thus reflects the type of reasoning, in reverse, that many use against re­birth. Its concern is not explicitly with the I and the mental and physical aggregates that are its bases of designation but the relationship between the I of this life and the I of the last life. It is: If they were one, then the sufferings of the former life would absurdly have to be present in this life. If they were different, which by the rules of inherent exis­tence would make them totally, unrelatedly different, remem­brance of former lives would become impossible. Moral retri­bution would be impossible. Undeserved suffering would be experienced. Such difference would make a mere-I, the agent that travels from lifetime to lifetime, engaging in actions and experiencing their effects, impossible. Oneness of the I and its bases of designation- the mental and physical aggregates- is impossible. FOURTH ESSENTIAL: ASCERTAINING THAT THE I AND THE AGGREGATES ARE NOT INHERENTLY DIFFERENT The meditator has been so disturbed by the analysis of one­ness that he or she is ready to assume difference. However, the rules of inherent existence call for the different to be unrelatedly different, again the assumption being not that persons ordinarily consider the I and its bases of designation to be unrelatedly different but that within the context of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Emptiness Yoga 57 inherent existence, that is, of such pointable, solid existence, difference necessitates unrelatedness. The Fifth Dalai Lama says: Now, you might think that the I and the five aggre­gates cannot be anything but different. Chandra­kirti's Supplement (VI.120ab) says: There is no self other than the aggregates because, Apart from the aggregates, its conception does not exist. The inherently different must be unrelated. There­fore, just as within the aggregates you can identify each individually, \"This is the aggregate of form,\" and so forth, so after clearing away the five aggre­gates you would have to be able to identify the I, \"This is the I.\" However, no matter how finely you analyze, such an I is not at all to be found. The I, self, or ultimate reality that is left over when all else is removed is exactly what many Hindus are seeking to find; therefore, they would loudly exclaim the contrary: Something is found separate from mind and body. But would this be the I that goes to the store? Would this be the I that desires? Hates? Still, the question is not easy to settle, and it does not appear that easy answers are wanted. Rather, deeply felt conviction is needed. REALIZATION OF SELFLESSNESS AND DEITY YOGA With such conviction, the decision reached is that the I cannot be found under such analysis; this shows, not that the I does not exist, but that it does not inherently exist as it was identi­fied as seeming to in the first essential. This unfindability is emptiness itself, and realization of it is realization of empti­ness, selflessness. Incontrovertible inferential realization, though not of the level of direct perception or even of special insight (/hag mthong, vipashyana), has great impact. For a beginner it gener­ates a sense of deprivation, but for an experienced meditator it"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"58 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins generates a sense of discovery or recovery of what was lost. The perception of this vacuousness - the absence of inherent existence- carries emotional overtones, first of loss since our emotions are built on a false sense of concreteness and then of discovery of a lost treasure that makes everything possible. From a similar point of view, the emptiness of the mind is called the Buddha nature, or Buddha lineage, since it is what allows for development of the marvelous qualities of Buddha­hood. In tantric deity yoga, the mind realizing emptiness and motivated by compassion is used as the basis of emanation of a deity such as Kalachakra. The compassionately motivated wisdom consciousness itself provides the stuff of the deity. At the same time as it is appearing as a deity - an ideal person altruistically helping beings - it maintains ascertainment of the absence of inherent existence of the deity. Thereby, the two collections of merit (altuistic deeds) and wisdom (realiza­tion of emptiness) are accumulated simultaneously, the two aspects of compassion and wisdom being contained within the entity of one consciousness. Thus, deity yoga is founded on the very heart of the sutra path of the Great Vehicle, compassion and realization of emptiness. Tantric initiation authorizes those who have some experience of compassion and a degree of understanding of emptiness to practice deity yoga."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"5 History of the Kalachakra Tantra According to traditional, sacred history, on the fifteenth day of the third month, a year after his enlightenment, Shakya­muni Buddha appeared at Vulture Peak in the attire of a monk, setting forth the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in One Hundred Thousand Stanzas, and simultaneously he appeared at Dhanyakataka in South India as Kalachakra, setting forth the Kalachakra Tantra58 The tantra was preached inside a huge, many levelled monument (mchod rten, chaitya); the location, Dhanyaka�aka, is identified by George Roerich59 as Amara­vati in the Sattenpalle Taluka of Gun�ur District, Madras, South India. 59 The tantra was expounded at the request of King Such­andra, 60 an emanation of Vajrapat:U, who thereupon compiled the tantra in its long form, said to be twelve thousand stanzas. King Suchandra was from Shambhala, which G. Tucci61 says \"tradition places near the river Sita (viz. Tarim),\" East Turke­stan. 62 After hearing the tantra, the King returned to Sham­bhala, wrote a long exposition of it, and propagated Kala­chakra Buddhism as the state religion. The next six kings of Shambhala maintained the tradition, and the eighth king, Manjushrikirti ('jam dpal grags pa) ini­tiated so many persons (reportedly thirty-five million seers)63 into the Kalachakra mandala that he, and subsequent kings,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"60 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by feffrey Hopkins were called kulika (rigs /dan), \"one who bears the lineage\". Based on the long root tantra, Kulika Maiijushnl<irti com­posed a shorter tantra of five chapters, which has one thou­sand forty-seven stanzas. 64 Named the Condensed Kalachakra Tantra (bsdus rgyud, laghutantra), it is what is currently called the Kiilachakra Tantra, the longer version not being extant Kuli.ka Manjushrikirti was followed by Kulika Pundarika who composed the currently most famous exposition of the tantra, commonly called the Great Commentary on the \"Kiila­chakra Tantra\", the Stainless Light ('grel chen dri med 'ad, vima­laprabhii). It is still extant and most likely served as the basis for the subsequent literature. Another eight hundred years after Kulika Pundanl<a, a Moslem invasion weakened the kingdom, this being in 624 A.D. 65 Nevertheless, the lineage of Kulika Kings continued such that the Indian master Chilupa66 from Orissa travelled to Shambhala and became an expert in the tantra and in Kulika Pu�9arika's Great Commentary. He returned to India in 966 A.D., and disseminated the teaching, bringing it to promi­nence there. The author of The Blue Annals, the Translator from Go, Shon-nu-bel ('gas Ia tsii ba bzhon nu dpal, 1392-1481) argues cogently that the Kiilachakra Tantra had reappeared in India long before that time, since, among other reasons, Chilupa:67 ... had read (it) in the vihara of Ratnagiri (Rin­�hen ri-bo) which had been left undamaged by the Turu�khas, and was of the opinion that, in general, for the (attainment) of Enlightenment the Maha­yana Guhyamantra (gsari.-sri.ags) was necessary, and that the text had to be studied with the help of the commentary by the Bodhisattvas. Accordingly he proceeded in search of the Kalacakra (so the Kalacakra must have been in existence at that time). Thus it has to be admitted that the system of Kalacakra seems to have reached Aryadesa [India] at an early date and that (the system) became known to many people in the time of Kalacakra­pada, father and son."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Histon; of the Kiilachakra Taritra 61 It is likely that Kalachakrapada the greater (\"Kalacakrapada, father\" in the above reference) is Chilupa himsel£.68 Helmut Hoffman reports that Chilupa defeated in debate \"Pandit Nadapada, called Na-ro-pa by the Tibetans\" who was then abbot of Nalanda, \"which was, together with Vikramashila, the most important centre of Buddhism in those days.\"69 Chilupa initiated Na<;lapada, who became known as the Lesser Kalachakrapada. 70 Hoffman concludes: 71 It would seem that the whole further tradition of Kalacakra derived from these two, not only in India but also in Tibet. Na<;!apada, in turn, initiated Atisha into the Kalachakra system, and among Atisha's students was the famous Kala­chakra master Pi-to-pa, also called Pindo Acharya. 72 In the histories, there is agreement that the Kiilachakra Tantra came to be widely known in India from 966 A.D. with Chilupa's return and \"became effective in India under King Mahipala of Bengal (c . 974-1026.)\"73 That even according to the traditional, sacred history the Kiilachakra Tantra was absent in India for such a long period of time has led to the suspicion that it was written in a Central Asian country. Lokesh Chandra says: 74 The Kalacakra is one of the last Sanskrit works to have been written in a Central Asian land whence· it is said to have travelled into India. With Chilupa's efforts, the system was developed in India, 75 spawning numerous compositions on various aspects of the tantra; beyond Kulika Purydarika's Great Commentary, Lokesh Chandra lists forty-seven works by twenty-two authors (including six anonymous works). 76 Sixty years after Chilupa's return, the Kiilachakra Tantra was introduced into Tibet, this being in 1026,77 and quickly gave rise to a flourish­ing tradition.

Aside from these areas, however, it appears not to have spread to China, Korea, Japan, or Southeast Asia, and thus the only practitioners today with a full transmission of initiation are in the Tibetan cultural region. Within that, due to Communist takeovers, the only lamas giving initiation are among the Tibetan refugees or in Bhutan and Sikkim. The tantra has become particularly associated with the Dalai Lamas, some of whom have given the initiation to huge masses of people. The present Dalai Lama has given the initi­ation nine times in large public gatherings. For many Tibe­tans, receiving the Kalachakra initiation from the Dalai Lama or another lama is a major event in their lives. The present Dalai Lama gave the Kiilachakra initiation twice in Tibet at his summer palace, the Nor-bu-ling-ga, in 1954 and 1956, each time to approximately one hundred thousand persons. He has given it six times in India - at Thekchen Choeling, Dharam­sala, in 1970 to thirty thousand; in Bylakuppee, Kamataka State, in 1971 to ten thousand; in Bodh Gaya, Bihar State, in 1971 to one hundred thousand; in Leh, Ladakh, in 1976 to forty thousand; in Derang, Bomdila, Arunachal Pradesh, in 1983 to five thousand; in Tabo, Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, in 1983 to ten thousand. The Dalai Lama also gave the Kiilachakra initiation once in the West, near Madison, Wisconsin, in 1981 to fifteen hundred persons.

SHAMBHALA IN THE FUTURE The current, twenty-first, Kulika is said to have ascended to the throne in 1927, and the reign of the twenty-fifth and last Kulika, called \"Rudra With A Wheel\", will begin in 2327- the reign of each Kulika being one hundred years. 87 In the ninety­eight year of his rule, the year 2425, which according to the Kalachakra calendar is 3304 years after Shakyamuni Buddha's passing away, a great war will be waged from Shambhala during which the barbarians will be defeated. 88 After that, Buddhism will again flourish for eighteen hundred years; thus, in the 5104th year after Shakyamuni Buddha's passing away the period of his teaching will finish, the length of time being 104 years longer than in the Sutra system. Although Chilupa travelled to Shambhala, it is sometimes described as like a pure land, a place beyond the reach of ordinary travel, a land that appears only to those of great merit. Through making prayeT-wishes persons can be reborn in Shambhala whereby they can enjoy the Kulikas' continual preaching of doctrine. Also, initiation is said to establish predispositions for rebirth in Shambhala not only for the sake of maintaining practice of the Kalachakra system but also for being under the care and protection of the Kulika Rudra With A Wheel when the great war comes. Thus, Shambhala is a beacon of hope in a world of tragedy for many Tibetans, Mongolians, Bhutanese, Sikkirnese, Nepalese, and Ladakhis."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"6 Initiations and Mandalas Having practiced the paths of recognizing the suffering con­dition of ordinary life, of developing great compassion and an altruistic intention to become enlightened, and of engender­ing the view realizing the emptiness of inherent existence, a practitioner is ready to receive initiation. Initiation is a multi­faceted process, the meanings of which are explained in great detail and even read into the term for initiation (abhi�heka). Through imaginatively treating the term \"abhisheka\" in many different ways by erasing letters, adding letters, and sub­stitutmg others, it comes to have the meanings of cleansing, purifying, authorizing, empowering, gaining lordship, depositing potencies, sprinkling, pouring, casting, bestow­ing behavior and release, and causing possession of a blissful mind. Through considerable alteration, �heka becomes snayi, which means cleansing. Just as dirt is cleaned away, so defile­ments of the mental and physical aggregates, constituents, and senses and sense fields are cleansed. Or, sheka can become shuddhe, which means pure. Just as a king is ritually bathed on assuming rule in a Vedic rite called abhi�heka, so the mental continuum is purified through cleansing defilements. Similarly, abhi�heka can become adhikara, which means authority. Just as a king is authorized to engage in royal activities through an inaugural ceremony called abhi�heka, so one is authorized to hear the tantras, cultivate the tantric paths, teach the tantras, and to engage in activities to accomplish"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Initiations and Mandalas 67 feats (dngos grub, siddhi). Or, it can become vasha or vashin{ (i.e., vashin), which mean power. The initiate is empowered with respect to all feats and activities according to wish. Or, it can become lshvara, lord. Just as through being in­augurated as a king one gains dominion as lord of the king­dom, so abhi�heka has the sense of attaining a rank of control over everything and gaining a lordship of good qualities. Or, abhi�hikta can become shakti, which means potency, and apak�hepana, which means to posit or deposit. Initiation deposits potencies for aftaining all the good qualities of the grounds, paths, and fruits. Or, abhi�hirrzcha, which means to cast or sprinkle; through being sprinkled with water, the initiate is cleansed. Or, abhishikta becomes nishikta, which means \"poured\"; through initiation the potency for exalted wisdom is poured into the clean vessel of a mental continuum purified through the Bodhisattva vows. Or, with initiation, one gains the seed producing the fruit through the seed's being cast in .the basis-of-all (the very subtle mind of clear light). Or, �hirrzcha can turn into chary a, which means deeds or behavior, and �hekta can become mukti, which means release. In this sense, initiation bestows the Secret Mantra style of behavior and the release that is its fruit. Or, it can become sukha, which means bliss, and yukta, which means to possess. In this sense, initiation causes the initiate to possess a blissful mind. Clearly, esthetic delight is taken in constructing creative etymologies that accord with important meanings of the initiation process. However, it is not that the term for initia­tion determines what initiation means but that the various facets of initiation themselves are used to create meanings of the term. Thus, these etymologies give considerable insight into the actual meanings and purposes of initiation. Initiation means. to cleanse and purify defilements; to authorize students to hear about and cultivate the tantric paths and to achieve special feats; to empower the attainment of beneficial quali­ties; to set potencies for attaining levels of the path and the fruits of those paths; to sprinkle water; to pour potencies and cast seeds into the mental continuum of the initiate; to convey a new style of behavior and its attendant releases from dis-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"68 The Killachakra Tantra: lntroductio11 by Jeffrey Hopkins torted states; and to cause initiates to be endowed with a blissful mind.

Four greatly high initiations 12 vase initiation 13 secret initiation 14 knowledge-wisdom initiation 15 definitive word initiation. These same fifteen initiations are also treated as eleven. This is done through taking the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood as seven and then treating the vase, secret, and knowledge-wisdom initiations in the high and greatly high initiations as merely three, as well as including the pro­visional word initiation from among the high initiations in the knowledge-wisdom initiation in that same group. This, added to the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood, makes ten, and the definitive word initiation is the eleventh.

' In addition, there is a final initiation of a vajra master lord. From among the fifteen initiations, the first seven authorize students to practice the stage of generation of the I<alachakra system, and the remaining eight authorize practice of the stage of completion. Just as in order to practice the stage of completion it is necessary first to practice the stage of genera­tion, so in order to receive the last eight initiations, it is necessary first to receive the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood. The first seven initiations establish potencies in practi­tioners' mental continuums for purifying impure appearances and impure conceptions. Impure appearances are appear­ances, to the mental consciousness, of ordinary phenomena such as a body made of flesh, blood, and bone; impure con­ceptions are conceptions of oneself, based on ordinary appearance, to be ordinary. During the stage of generation} practitioners develop clear appearance of themselves as the deity, or ideal being, Kalachakra together with a consort and other deities. When such meditation is successful, all ordinary appearances of bodies made of flesh, blood, and bone and houses made of wood and so forth vanish from the mental consciousness (not the sense consciousnesses) such that all that appears is divine - god and goddess, called a resident mandala, living in an environment and abode called a resi-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"70 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins dence mandala. These mandalas are depicted in pictures that serve as blueprints for imagination; the pictures show the landscape, the house (palace), companions, and yourself as Ka.Iachakra, for instance, in the manner of union with your mate. It is understood that you are engaged in altruistic activi­ties, emitting helpful light rays and emanations into the en­vironment, teaching, and so forth. In this way, you have the abode, body, resources, and activities of a deity, an ideal being whose very substance, as explained earlier, is the wisdom consciousness continuously realizing the emptiness of inherent existence, motivated by great compassion. Through developing, in the stage of generation, clear ap­pearance of pure body and pure mind, ordinary appearances are stopped for the mental consciousness. Also, based on clear appearance of pure mind and body, the meditator has a sense of divine personhood or selfhood; the person that is desig­nated in dependence upon such vividly appearing pure mind and body is an ideal person, a deity. Thus, successful medi­tators have a conception of themselves as ideal beings, not inherently existent but merely designated in dependence upon pure mind and body. For deity yoga to succeed, two prime factors are needed: clear appearance of a divine body and pride in being that deity. With success in visualizing the deity, both mind and body appear to be pure; hence, the sense of self that the meditator has in dependence upon purely appearing mind and body is of a pure self, a divine self. Divine pride itself is said to harm or weaken the conception of inherent existence which is at the root of all other afflictions in cyclic existence including afflicted pride. About divine pride, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama says in his introduction to Tantra in Tibet:90 ... initially one meditates on an emptiness, and then, within the context of the mind's continuous ascertainment of emptiness, the meditator believes that he is using this mind as the basis [or source] of appearance. At that time, the sense of a mere I designated in dependence on the pure resident -the deity -and residence -the palace and sur-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Initiations and Mandalas 71 roundings - is a fully qualified divine pride. As much as one can cultivate such pride, so much does one hann the conception of inherent existence that is the root of cyclic existence. Due to the initial and then continuous practice of realizing the emptiness of inherent existence, the meditator realizes that the person is merely designated in dependence upon pure mind and body and is not analytically findable among or separate from those bases of designation. Thereby, divine \"pride\" or sense of self itself serves as a means for eliminating exaggerated conceptions of the status of phenomena including the person. Because identification of oneself as a divine being is within the context of the emptiness of inherent existence­of oneself not being analytically findable among or separate from pure mind and body and of only being designated in dependence upon pure mind and body - afflictive pride, which would be ruinous, is not just not produced, it is counteracted. Identity takes on a new meaning. MULTIPLE DEITY MEDITATION During the stage of generation, meditators achieve clear appearance of themselves as deities. However, they do not just imagine themselves to be one deity but individually imagine the different components of their psycho-physical continuum to be deities residing within a mandala, all a manifestation of their own compassionately motivated wisdom consciousness. They imagine their five constituents­earth (hard things such as bone), water (fluids), fire (heat), wind (inner currents), and space (hollow places) - to be deities. They imagine their five aggregates- fonns, feelings, discriminations, compositional factors, and consciousnesses -to be deities. They imagine their ten winds (inner currents) as well as their left and right channels to be deities. They imagine their six sense powers- eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mental sense powers- as well as their respective objects­visible fonns, sounds, odors, tastes, tangible objects, and other phenomena- to be deities.

The four groups of phenomena- body, speech, mind, and pristine consciousness (bliss)- are related respectively with the four faces of Kiilachakra- white, red, black (or dark blue), and yellow. Therefore, the students receive the first two initi­ations concerned with body, the water and crown initiations, from the white face; the next two concerned with speech, the siik ribbon and vajra and bell initiations, from the red face; the next two concerned with mind, the conduct and name initiations, from the black face; and the final permission ini­tiation concerned with pristine mind or bliss, from the yellow face. Kiilachakra's body with black face faces east; thus in pic­tures of the mandala or of the deity the bottom of the picture is the east, the top is the west, the right side from the main deity's viewpoint is the south, and the left side is the north (thus from the viewpoint of someone looking at the picture, the right side is north and the left side is south). The white face is to the north, the main deity's left; the red face, to the south or right; and the yellow face, to the west or back. As the pictures, called tang-gas (thang ka), depict Kiilachakra, his black, or blue, face is facing forward; white, to his left; yellow to the back; and red to the right. The mandala has four sets of doors on its four sides which serve as approaches to the four faces of Kiilachakra. Given that the students receive the seven initiations from these faces and that the mandala has four doors corresponding to them, the students move from door to door of the mandala to receive the respective initiations. First, at the eastern door, the students request all seven initiations. They then proceed to the northern door for the water and crown initiations, next to the southern door for the silk ribbon and vajra and bell initiations, next to the eastern door for the conduct and name initiations, and finally to the western door for the permission initiation."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Initiations and Mandalas 75 THE RESIDENCE AND RESIDENT MANDALAS The term \"mandala\" ( dkyil 'khor, marJtjala) has many mean­ings. 91 Our world is conceived as residing on mandalas or spheres of wind, water, and so forth; here \"mandala\" refers to the four elements that are the fo undation. In a context such as \"being directed toward entry to a path of the mandalas (or spheres) of the bad transmigrations,\" \"mandala\" refers to birth-places. In \"the mandala of the retinue of Bodhisattvas\", \"mandala\" means the circle of a retinue. A drop of perfumed water can be called a \"mandala\" ofperfumed water. A garland or series of light rays is called a mandala of light. The earth, or foundation, under a fence is called a mandala, as in \"Con­struct the mandala.\" \"Sun mandala\" or \"moon rriandala\" just mean sun and moon but can refer to theirroundshape. In \"Bow down with (the body) having five mandalas, \" \"mandalas\" refer to the five limbs-two arms, two legs, and head. \"Man­dala\" also refers to an inestimable mansion that is the residence of deities, as well as to the resident deities. In addition, it can refer to the combination of divine residence and residents. In the initiation ritual for Kalachakra, \"mandala\" mainly refers to a divine residence as well as to the circle of deities. Still, it is also used frequently to refer to the world system in glorified aspect, as in the offering of \"mandala\" to the lama. In the context of offering, the term does not refer to the divine residence or to the resident deities, but to the offering that one is making to the lama, the offering being the entire world system visualized in complete purity. Occasionally, the term refers to symbolic representations of the elements, as in man­dalas (or spheres) of earth, water, fire, and wind, and the term is also used to refer to the square board on which the students drop a stick in order to indicate their lineage and the type of feat they should work at achieving. In the usage \"Kalachakra mandala\", however, the reference is only to the divine resi­dence and the resident deities. RESIDENCE MANDALA The principal residence mandala is a large building that sits on a raised foundation. The building, a palace, has four walls with double doors in the center of each. The outer walls,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"76 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins which are those of the body mandala, are transparent and in five layers, like five layers of colored glass; the colors, from outside to inside, are yellow, white, red, black, and green. You are outside, coming up the stairs to the platform or foundation on which the entire building sits. You proceed to the eastern doorway, the one depicted at the bottom of the picture. The doors open to the first level, and you step inside into the body mandala, seeing that half-way in is another set of similar, five layered walls, these being those of the speech mandala. This building within the building again has four double doors, and since it is raised above the body mandala, there are stairs leading up to the doors. It is about four feet above the body mandala level. You proceed up the stairs; the doors open, and you enter the speech mandala, seeing that halfway inside it is another set of walls, which this time are in three layers -black, red, and white. These are the outer walls of the mind mandala. This third building within the larger building again has four double doors, and since it is raised above the speech mandala, there are stairs leading up to the doors. Again, it is about four feet above the speech mandala level. You proceed up the stairs; the doors open, and you enter the mind mandala, seeing that halfway inside it is a square plat­form but with no walls, this being the pristine consciousness mandala. You notice that halfway inside it is another square platform, this being the great bliss mandala. The building thus has five levels- the body, speech, mind, pristine consciousness, and great bliss mandalas - with three sets of walls, these being for the first three levels. (The walls all reach the same height with a single roof over the entire build­ing.) Each of the four walls of the body, speech, and mind man­dalas has an elaborate doorway. Let's go back down and outside to look at the eastern doorway of the bottom level, the body mandala. First, notice the ground; it is black, corres­ponding to the black face of Kalachakra that faces the east. Similarly, in the south the ground is red since Ka!achakra's red face faces south; in the west the ground is yellow in"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Initiations and Mandalas 77 correspondence to the yellow face, and in the north the ground is white corresponding with the white face. Notice the entryway at the eastern door, wider than the doorway, with a three storied portico above the entryway. Each of the stories of the portico above the entryway has four pillars across the front, thereby creating three room-like alcoves on each story. In eight of these nine alcoves are god­desses of offering; the middle alcove in the first story on the eastern side has a black wheel of doctrine with a buck and doe to the right and left. The first story sits on the roof of the entryway, smaller than the entryway itself, leaving space on the two ends for someone to stand. In that space on the floor of the first level, on each end, is a lion standing on an elephant and pressing down on its head. The lions appear to be helping to hold up the next floor. On the next floor as well as the top floor, in the equivalent space are male figures called shiila­bhanjika.92 Those at the ends of the second floor of the portico appear to be helping to hold up the next floor, and those on the third floor appear to be helping to hold up the roof. The three levels each have victory banners, and there are tail-hair fans, mirrors, bells, and hanging emblems. On top of the roof, in the middle, is a vase, and on the ends are victory banners. The same type of entryway, with three story portico, is at each doorway of the body mandala. The only difference is that in the south the middle alcove of the first story has a wonder­ful red vase in the center with a conch and a lotus to the right and the left. In the north the middle alcove of the first story has a large white drum in the center with a staff and a mallet to the right and the left. In the west is a yellow bodhi tree in the center with a male semi-human to the right and a female semi-human93 to the left. Notice that the colors of the things in the middle alcoves of the first stories of the four porticos correspond to the basic colors of the four quadrants of the mandala, which as you will remember, correspond to the respective faces of Kalachakra, who stands up on the fifth level of the mandala. Look up at the top of the wall; see the red jewel-studded frieze; the jewels are triangular, square, and so forth. Above"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"78 The KiUachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins the frieze is an open area, depicted as blue in the picture, with a ledge above it. There, sea monsters spew strings and half­strings of pearls from their mouths. The area is adorned with mirrors, tail-fans, bells, half moons, .garlands of flowers, and so forth. Above, on the outside is an ornamental ledge from which an ornamental jeweled design hangs. On it, is another ledge in the shape of half lotus petals. On it, are victory banners and emblems. That is the outside wall of the body mandala; the walls of the speech and mind mandalas are the same. Now, look down at the base of the outside wall. A white apron surrounds the entire building; it is where goddesses of offering reside. On the white apron, at the comers made by the entryway stand half-moon vajras, and at the four comers, again outside, stand crossed vajras of variegated color. Let's go back inside the body mandala. Notice that next to the outside wall there is a corridor the color of the ground, being black in the east. Next to it, is a raised white area where gods and goddesses reside; it has a small roof above it. On the other side of it, next to the wall of the speech mandala, is another area the color of the ground in that quadrant. This pattern of a corridor, a white area for gods and goddesses, and an area again the color of the ground of that quadrant is the same in the body, speech, and mind mandalas. Now let's go on up to the mind mandala. Halfway inside the mind mandala is the square, pristine mind mandala; again, notice that it does not have its own walls and is raised up above the mind mandala, about four feet. It is within the mind mandala, so to speak. It is surrounded by a balustrade of green vajras, on which are four black pillars on each side, making sixteen. The four in the east are marked with black swords representing Amoghasiddhi; the four in the south are marked with red jewels representing Ratnasambhava; the four in the north are marked with white lotuses representing Amitabha; the four in the west are marked with yellow wheels represent­ing Vairochana. Again, halfway inside the pristine consciousness mandala is the raised, square mandala of great bliss, surrounded by a balustrade of black vajras. In its center is a green lotus with"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Initiations and Mandal�s 79 eight petals. In its center is a white moon disc, on which is a re·d sun disc, a black rilhu disc, and a yellow killilgni disc (riihu is a planet, and killilgni, literally, fire at the end of an eon, may be the fiery tail of that planet); these form the seat or basis on which Kalachakra and his consort Vishvamata stand. In total, there are seven hundred twenty-two deities situated throughout this five tiered mandala. 94 When the stage of generation is cultivated in its most expansive manner- and this is preferable- the entire residence and resident mandalas are imagined in meditation, first gradually, one by one, and then when the meditator is accustomed to it, all at once. The process is much like moving into a complicated apartment complex or moving to a house in the suburbs in a complex development and eventually coming to know the entire area through gradually taking the lay of the land, so to speak, to mind. Next we should go through the entire building, identifying everyone inside. However, first, let's go back outside and get familiar with the area outside the building. Remember that the ground, as well as the roof of the resident mandala, is black in the east, red in the south, white in the north, yellow in the west, and blue in the center. Notice that the area outside the body mandala right over to the four tiered perimeter is filled with articles of offering - lotuses, vases, and so forth. The four tiered perimeter itself is composed of earth, water, fire, and wind -yellow, white, red and gray-blue; these are discs that underlie the mandala. A full moon is rising from the southeast, depicted in the picture in the southeast comer on the earth perimeter. The sun is setting in the southwest, depicted in the picture in the southwest corner on the earth perimeter. Also, notice that between the fire and wind peri­meters there are eight great cemeteries, depicted in the picture as four red wheels in the principal directions and four white wheels in the intermediate directions. There is also a cemetery above, depicted as an additional wheel in the east (the bottom of the picture), and a cemetery below depicted as an additional wheel in the west (the top of the picture). Again, outside the space perimeter is a vajra fence, and outside it, blazing light. That is the entire residence mandala."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"80 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by feffrey Hopkins RESIDENCE MANDALA Let's go back inside the eastern door, up the stairs to the speech mandala, and again up the stairs to the mind mandala.

Mandala of Great Bliss Seeing the mandala of great bliss, you recall the earlier de­scription of the seat as a green lotus with eight petals and that in its center is a white moon disc, on which is a red sun disc, a black riihu disc, and a yellow kiiliigni planet -these being the seat, or basis, on which Kalachakra and his consort Vishva­mata stand. Kiilachakra. Take a good look at Kalachakra, the central deity. It is important to keep in mind that Kalachakra, no matter what aspect is displayed, is a compassionate appearance of a wisdom consciousness realizing the emptiness of inherent existence. The nature of the glorious Kalachakra is, therefore, great bliss since a supramundane deity is someone who has brought to full development the capacity of the most subtle, innate, blissful consciousness to realize emptiness. Kala­chakra's body is fully aspected,95 emitting pure light rays of five colors-blue, red, white, yellow, and green. 96 His body is blue in color. He has three necks- black in the center, red to his right, and white to his left - and four faces. The black face in the center, facing east, is fierce, with exposed fangs. Let's walk around the corridor of the mind mandala so that we can see the other three faces clearly. Going to the left, we come near the southern door of the mind mandala; from there we see that his right face is red and exhibiting desire. Proceeding on, we see that his back face is yellow and dwelling in medita­tive stabilization. Proceeding on, we see that his left face is white and very peaceful. All of the faces have three eyes.

This is called a mandala offering, the word \"mandala\" refer­ring not to the resident and residence mandalas of Kalachakra but to a whole sphere of offerings. In this offering, which is repeated many times during the course of the initiation ritual, everything of value is offered to the lama in glorified form in order to indicate the value that the students place on receiving the doctrine and to indicate that the teaching which has tech­niques helpful throughout the course of lives is far more important than any material object, the benefit of which is limited, at maximum, to one short life. Also, by giving to the lama/Ka!achakra everything to which the students are attached, they relieve their minds of excessive energy investment in superficial material goods and temporary attachrrients, allow­ing their minds to focus, with great power, on the teachings received. How could someone who is not willing to give everything away enter into meditative equipoise on the empti­ness of inherent existence in which nothing except the vacuity that is the absence of inherent existence appears, not even one's own body? Then, the students readjust their motivation so that they do not enter into the practice of Mantra for superficial purposes, such as merely for better health in this lifetime, or even for deeper but still self-centered purposes such as liberation from cyclic existence for themselves. Rather, the motivation is to bring about the welfare of other beings (although once al­truism is the motivation, one's own welfare is achieved as it could not be otherwise). The fact that the ritual begins with a reformation of motiva­tion towards altruism suggests the central and fundamental importance of love and compassion. Also, that this readjust­ment is actually done in the ritual and not just assumed indicates a stark appraisal of the need continually to redirect the mind away from ingrained selfishness; it suggests that the mind, unless trained, reverts to selfishness and self-centered­ness. With motivation altruistically formed, the students are ready to take birth as a child of the lama, who is viewed as"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"94 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins being Kalachakra. This process is called an \"internal initia­tion\" and is performed once during the enhancement ritual and four times during the actual rite of the seven initiations authorizing practi<;e of the stage of generation. Much of tantric practice is structured around mimicking ordinary, uncon­trolled processes in a manner that serves to purify those pro­cesses and bring them under control. In this case, the process of taking rebirth is being mimicked, purified, and brought under control. · In ordinary rebirth, 107 a being in the intermediate state between the last life and the new life sees its father and mother lying together. If the being is to be reborn as a male, he desires the mother and wants to separate from (get rid of) the father. If the being is to be reborn as a female, she desires the father and wants to separate from (get rid of) the mother. When the .being, out of wanting to copulate, begins to embrace the one ·that is desired, he or she perceives only the partner's sexual organ, due �o which he/she becomes frustrated and angry. In . the midst of desire and anger, the being of the intermediate state dies and thereupon enters the womb, and is reborn in the sense that conception takes place. Entry into the womb is by way of passing through the father's body. First the being of the intermediate state enters, according to one tantric explanation, through the father's mouth or, according to another tantric explanation, through the top of the father's head. Having entered into the father's body, the being of the intermediate state passes through the body.and emerges by way of his penis in the mother's vagina. With the four factors necessary for rebirth -presence of the consciousness of an intermediate state being, presence of semen, presence of ovum (called \"blood\"), and a karmic con­nection between father, mother, and intermediate state being -complete, rebirth is taken. Here in the internal initiation (probably called \"internal\" . because it takes place in the womb of the consort who is called \"mother\", yum), the students imagine that they take rebirth in the pattern just described. They are drawn into the mouth of the lama (who is always understood to be Kalachakra) by light that radiates out from the seed syllable hu� at the heart of"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Enhancement 95 the lama, and having entered his mouth, they pass through his body into the mother's vagina and dissolve in her womb. The dissolution in the mother's womb specifically refers to medita ting on the emptiness of inherent existence; not only are all the old coarse appearances of a body made of flesh, blood, and bone withdrawn, but also the vacuity that is the absence of their inherent existence is actualized in vivid reali­zation. Previously, the motivation of great compassion was established; now, the wisdom realizing emptiness is also ·present. This wisdom consciousness realizing emptiness and im­pelled by compassion now becomes the \"substance\" of the students' reappearance in divine, or ideal, form. Rather than being subjected to rebirth impelled by the afflictive emotions of desire and hatred that are based on the ignorance conceiv­ing of oneself and other phenomena as inherently existent, as is the case in ordinary rebirth, in this repetition of the birth process the students are impelled by great compassion and founded on the wisdom realizing rea lity. In the womb, the wisdom consciousness first appears as a seed syllable, hu�, that turns into a vajra. The vajra then transforms into a Kala­chakra, an ideal being with a face, arms, legs, and so forth. The visualization as an ideal being is then further enhanced, or fortified, by imagining thc1t light rays from the seed syllable at the lama's heart draw all enlightened beings into his mouth, who, in pa ssing through his body, melt into an ambrosia that is a light-like fluid called the \"mind of enlightenment\" (byang chub kyi serns, bodhiclntta) at his heart, and then emerge as this ambrosia-light into the womb of the mother, anointing the students. Since enlightened beings are manifestations of a non-dual bliss consciousness- the most subtle consciousness that is by nature blissful- realizing the emptiness of inherent existence, when the students in the mother's womb are anointed with the ambrosia-light that the enlightened beings have become, they are fo rtified with this very nature. The students now have not only a wisdom consciousness realizing emptiness but also a blissful consciousness realizing empti­ness. This exalted wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and emptiness that has been generated is the internal initiation."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"96 The Kiilachakra Ta ntra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins The steps leading up to this are causal factors of the initiation; the actual initiation is the exalted wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and emptiness that is generated. The term \"mind of enlightenment\" has as its broadest referents the conventional mind of enlightenment, which is the altruistic intention to become enlightened, and the ulti­mate mind of enlightenment, which is a wisdom conscious­ness in the continuum of a Bodhisattva directly realizing emptiness. However, the term \"mind of enlightenment\" is also used, as it is here, to refer to semen or, more accurately, to the white and red essential fluids that both males and females have. This usage of the term \"mind of enlightenment\" in tantric discourse to refer to the essential fluid does not cancel out its meanings as the altruistic intention to become en­lightened or the wisdom directly realizing emptiness, for altruism and realization of emptiness are the very basis of the basic tantric meditation of deity yoga, as is obvious from the course of this ritual. 108 Rather, the term is used, additionally, in specific circumstances, to refer to the essential white and red fluids. In this case, the reference is to a purified form of semen -: ambrosia-light that contains the very essence of all en­lightened beings. For psychological reinforcement to occur, the ambrosia-light is imagined as a composite of the qualities of enlightened beings. Being anointed with it and absorbing it into oneself thereby serve not only to reinforce and enhance the wisdom and compassion that have already been meditated but also to engender a bliss consciousness like that which fully enlightened beings have. Whereas Sigmund Freud was primarily concerned with exposing sexual attractions and so forth masked in other forms, this system self-consciously reenacts those ordinary impulses in order not just to sublimate but to transfom1 them by removing the ignorance conceiving inherent existence that is their basis. That the internal initiation is performed not just once but five times during this series of initiations and that initiation is taken again and again during a practitioner's lifetime indicate that such transformation is not considered to be an easy matter.

Repetition is not merely to repeat what one did before, but a chance to make progress through deeper realiza­tion or movement to a subtler level of consciousness. Repeti­tion is another opportunity and also an acculturation of mind and body to a way of life founded on valid principles rather than impelled by afflictive emotions. Having received the internal initiation, the students emerge from the mother's womb and are set back on the seat by a pillar outside the eastern door of the mandala. Presumably, the doors of the mandala have remained closed, the nature of the mandala being such that the students were drawn into Kiilachakra's mouth by passing through the wall of the eastern side and have returned in the same way. Also, the students are yet to see the inside of the mandala, and thus while passing to and from the lama/Kalachakra, did not get a chance to look at the inside of the building. Despite their not yet having put on the blindfold and despite the fact that the walls are trans­parent, the inside of the mandala is not seen. In the next step of the enhancement ritual, the students make a supplicaton, or request, for the rituals of (1) taking refuge in the Three Jewels -Buddha, doctrine, and spiritual community, (2) taking the Bodhisattva vows, and (3) taking the Mantra vows and pledges. The lama responds by speaking to one of the students - every student imagining himself or herself to be that person. Implicitly accepting the request, the lama speaks of the greatness of the Mantra path, thereby causing the student to become more firmly interested in Mantra. Then, the rituals of taking refuge, the Bodhisattva vows, and the Mantra vows are conducted. It is important to note that although the basic procedure of the entire initiation has already been enacted - the student has imagined generating a blissful consciousness realizing emptiness and has used it as the \"substance\" for reappearing in ideal form- this very same procedure will be repeated again and again. At this point, it is almost as if the students, having already become a Buddha"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"98 The Killachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins with all the enlightened beings of all time having dissolved into them, then reenact the first step of the path, taking refuge in Buddha, his doctrine (specifically true cessations of suffer­ing and paths to those cessations), and the spiritual com­munity that helps practitioners to such refuge. If the students had actually become Buddhas during the internal initiation, this, of course, would be sufficient, but since such has been done only through imagination, the process can be repeated with many permutations pertaining to the over-all pattern of the path. Having taken refuge and the vows, the students are blessed into a magnificent or heightened state through the visualized setting of radiant syllables in their bodies, which are still visualized as Kalachakra. The visualization is further en­hanced by the lama's touching a vajra to the student's heart, throat, and top of the head. From the outside, the lama is touching the student with a substance- here, a vajra- and the students imagine being heightened into greater radiance; a combination of factors from without and from within is re­quired. The students imagine that all ill-deeds and unfavor­able factors of body, speech, and mind are thereby purified as are all predispositio.ns that would cause such in the future. Again, if the mere ritual were considered to be totally effica­cious, there would be no need for the rest of the ritual, but this not the case. Rather, the students are becoming acculturated to a process, a pattern, of purification. Then, a tooth-stick- an old fashioned toothbrush -is drop­ped onto a square board called a mandala to determine what type of feat (dngos grub, siddhi) the students should work at achieving. When the stick is dropped upright on the board, it falls onto one of four quadrants, in the middle, or off the board. Where it falls (as long as it falls on the board - three times off the board disqualifies a person for initiation for the time being) determines the class of feats that the students can work at most successfully. Just as a toothbrush is used for cleaning the teeth, so the mantra that is used in connection with the toothbrush speaks of cleansing body, speech, and mind through ideal body, speech, and mind that are identi-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Enhancement 99 fied, in entity, with the four doors of liberation -signlessness, wishlessness, emptiness, and non-activity. In brief, signlessness refers to objects' not being established by way of their own character as produced by causes and conditions. Wishlessness refers to objects' not being estab­lished by way of their own character as producing effects. Emptiness is the fact that the entities of objects are not estab­lished by way of their own character. Non-activity refers to the fact that the activity of objects' performing functions is not established by way of its own character. In this way, all four doors of liberation refer to the emptiness of inherent existence of any particular object from four different points of view -their causation, their producing effects, their entities, and their performing functions. It is indeed validly established that impermanent objects are caused, produce effects, exist, and perform functions; however, none of these is inherently established. The four doors of liberation are to realize this absence of inherent establishment. Further purification of body, speech, and mind is imagined through taking three handfuls of water. Then, since the stu­dents' dreams during the evening of the enhancement and before the actual initiation ritual are important, protective kusha grass is given for mattress and pillow, as is also a protective thread. These are to defend the mind against inter­fering influences. The assumption seems to be that our minds are subject to the influence of autonomous forces (autonomous complexes in Carl Jung's vocabulary) and that their power must be thwarted. That the greatest protection is said to be love suggests that an angry defensive posture gives these autonomous forces more power, whereas sympathetic love serves to de-autonomize such forces. Sympathetic love even toward what actually are internal forces reduces the distance betWeen that part of one's mind conceived to be oneself and those parts that have been separated off as autonomous com­plexes; it also could ameliorate outside forces.

Vajrasattva is then invoked to bless the stu­dents' body, speech, and mind into magnificence. This is followed by the students' becoming more enthusias­tic for the Mantra doctrine by hearing about its rarity, its power to cleanse bad karma, and its efficacy in bringing about full enlightenment as a Buddha. The enhancement ritual con­cludes with advice from the lama on analyzing the dreams that occur in the last part of the night around dawn. Dreams at this time are considered to have more meaning than those earlier in the night, which are often too greaty influenced by the previous day's activities to indicate deep predilections. The concern with dreams is here specifically for indications of the students' relationship to the lama and to the initiation. Omens of a good relationship and success with the practice are valued; ill omens are to be dissolved through meditation on emptiness, cultivating love, repeating mantra, and so forth. Still, whether the dreams are good or bad, the students are advised not to over-reify their status and thereby become inflated or deflated. Even good omens do not exist by way of their own nature and should not become objects of attachment by assenting to their seeming inherent existence. Bad omens, being without inherent existence, are subject to transforma­tion and thus should not be considered as sources· for dis­couragement. The concept of the Buddha nature -the luminous and knowing nature of the mind and the emptiness of inherent existence of the mind -underlies all these transformative processes. The students' status is enhanced, elevated, and glorified through making conscious use of their everpresent basically pure nature, not through mere recognition of this underlying mode of being but through also actively reshaping their manifestation from it."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"8 Procedure of the In itiations ENTERING AND SEEING THE MANDALA The students are outside the closed doors on the eastern side of the mandala - the doors in front of the main, black face gf Kalachakra. Wanting to go inside, they request admission and ask again to take refuge, the Bodhisattva vows, and the Mantra vows. The lama (Kalachakra) responds by first giving the students articles of clothing and a head-piece that sym­bolizes the crown protrusion. These are given to make the students feel more like a deity. As was discussed earlier, in the practice of the stage of generation, the appearance to the mental consciousness of an ordinary body composed of flesh, blood, and bone is to be stopped and replaced with an appearance of pure mind and body. Designated in dependence upon such pure mind and body is a deity, an ideal person. To increase this sense of a not inherently existent but designatedly existent, ideal, altruistic person, the students, even externally, are made to look like a deity by putting on a deity's clothing. It is said that many persons fear imagining themselves in divine form;109 thus, playfully putting on a deity's attire must help participants not only in identifying the attire of a deity but also in getting over the sense of oddness. -Since the students are to be let into the mandala but are not yet ready to see it, blindfolds are distributed by the lama's"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"102 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins assistants. Then the students re-imagine themselves as Kala­chakras, and the lama apdresses them, asking them who they are and what they want. The students answer by declaring their altruistic nature as Bodhisattvas or those aspiring to become Bodhisattvas and by declaring their interest in using in the path of Secret Mantra the bliss that arises from desire. The students supplicate the lama/Kalachakra as a great being who can show the path out of suffering; the lama res­ponds by conducting the ceremonies of going for refuge, taking the Bodhisattva vows, and taking the Mantra vows in the same way as these were done during the enhancement ritual. The altruistic nature of the endeavor is illustrated by the students' repeating: I will liberate those not liberated [from the obstruc­tions to omniscience]. I will release those not released [from cyclic exis­tence). I will relieve those unrelieved [in bad transmigra­tions] And set sentient beings in nirvana. Consonant with this altruism, the students declare their intention to practice the all-encompassing yoga, which has two aspects: (1) the conventional altruistic intention to become enlightened, which is all-encompassing in that it is concerned with establishing an altruistic relationship with all sentient beings, and (2) the realization of the ultimate nature of all persons and phenomena, their absence of inherent exis­tence. In this practice, the conventional mind of enlighten­ment - the aspirational intention to become enlightened, which is the thought, \"I will attain Buddha hood for the sake of all sentient beings,\" substantializes in the form of a white, round, flat moon disc at the heart. Similarly, the ultimate mind of enlightenment, in which the emptiness of inherent existence of all phenomena and one's own mind are of one taste, that is to say, of one undifferentiable entity, substantial­izes as a five-pointed vajra standing on the moon. As we will see, the students are led again and again through exercises in which the deepest affective attitude, compassion,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 103 and the deepest intellectual realization, the wisdom of empti­ness, are used as the basis of appearance in form. The sugges­tion is that in ordinary life attitudes of selfishness, jealousy, enmity, desire, and so forth are the stuff of our appearance. To get control over this process of appearance and to reform it in the healthiest possible way, students are again and again instructed to generate compassion and to reflect on the nature of phenomena and then reappear with those attitudes- con­sciousnesses, in Buddhist vocabulary - as the bases out of which they or, as in this case, pure objects appear. The objects are then symbols, not in the sense of referring to something else, but in the sense of manifesting what they symbolize within constant exhibition of what they symbolize. Compas­sion and wisdom do not disappear with their appearance as moon and vajra; rather, they continue within appearance in form. This is the extraordinary feature of tantra. In the ritual text, these activities are said to be done \"outside the curtain\". Since the mandala has no curtain, the reference here is to the curtain that surrounds the model of the mandala drawn with colored sands. The drawn mandala is kept inside a curtain out of sight of the students just as, in imagination, the students are outside the closed doors of the mandala. The doors now open, this being illustrated by the assistants' opening the curtain around the sand mandala. Since the students are still blindfolded, they are led inside by the lama who has come down from the fifth level of the mandala and is holding a vajra in his hand. Each student imagines that he or she takes hold of the vajra and is led into the mandala. Still blindfolded, the students circumambulate the mandala three times and then go back outside through the eastern door. Obeisance is paid in series to Akshobhya, Amogha­siddhi, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Vairochana. For Akshobhya, who is fused with Kalachakra, the student turns into Akshobhya and makes a supplication; the same is done for Amoghasiddhi, again at the eastern door. Upon going to the corresponding doors by entering the mandala and then going back out at the proper door, obeisance is paid to the other three. Having become similar to the principal deities of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"104 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins the five lineages, the students are sworn to secrecy, sworn to keeping the vows, qnd to keeping the word of the lama as long as it accords with the doctrine (seep. 242). By this time, the students have imagined themselves in divine form several times. A different version of this practice is now done. The students imagine themselves in the fierce form of Kalachakra, called Vajravega, and then imagine syl­lables at important places in their bodies that are stirred into greater radiance and activity by light rays from the lama. Light rays from the heart of the lama also extend out to all the Buddhas in all world-systems who appear, filling all of space, as Kalachakras and Vajravegas. These, in turn, all enter into the student -each student imagining that all dissolve into himself or herself. Such imaginations suggest that ordinary consciousness is split into a thousand parts that need to be drawn together. Even imagination of fully enlightened beings elsewhere is to be drawn into oneself; energy is to return to its source. Tantra is described as using imagination as the path, and the tremen­dous reinforcement of personality traits that is accomplished through imagining and identifying with an ideal being and then drawing all such ideal beings in all world-systems into oneself is obviously built on a very active and creative use of imagination. One cannot half-heartedly imagine oneself as composed of compassion and wisdom, thinking that there are real incarnations of compassion and wisdom elsewhere, for those very beings are drawn into oneself. One has to face up to the identification. The power of positive thinking, of imagin­ing situations of supreme success, is basic to the process. It is obvious that Buddhahood, the goal corresponding to this process, is not withdrawal into nothingness, as it often is described in the West, but is a dynamic expression of know­ledge, compassion, and power. Such intense combination into oneself of all ideal beings can be too exciting; thus, it is followed with a calming. This is accomplished by putting a tlower, mantrafied with om ii h Jz z :mz on the student's head. Then, a protective ritual of syllable imagination at important points in the body is done; again, the need for protection suggests that the heightened state is"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 105 subject to interference from autonomous complexes that have to be thwarted. Then, in what could only seem to be anti-climactic if it was not kept in mind that deity imagination is to be performed in a multitude of ways in connection with permutations of the path structure, the students lift their blindfolds to see if any particular color appears in the line of sight the first moment after lifting the blindfold. Through the association of activi­ties of pacification, increase, subjugation, and so forth with certain colors, the lama is able to read the type of activity that the student should work at achieving. Then, the lama, ringing the bell that is in his hand, speaks from within the power of the truth, calling on the stUdents' lineages to be shown when they drop a flower on the mandala board, through which the lineage of the student is known. The students take off the blindfold and manifestly see the mandala, described in chapter six of the Introduction. The students celebrate what they have seen in song, \"Samaya ho� hoh ho/.1 ho�.\" INITIATION Now the students are ready for initiation. First, they make a request for all seven initiations, after which the lama clears away interferences (as was just said, the frequency of this activity suggests the perniciousness of the autonomous com­plexes that undo attempts to live within a heightened psycho­logical state). Then, the lama performs an ablution, cleansing the students' ears, nose, mouth, and body, makes an offering to the now cleansed students, and fumigates the area with incense. As explained earlier (see pp. 72-73), the seven initiations authorizing practice of the stage of generation are in four groups, corresponding to the four faces of Kalachakra and the four groups of factors to be purified. The structure of all the initiations is the same, with the exception that the second initiation at each face does not require an internal initiation. Roughly there are nineteen steps:"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"106 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins 1 the student, at the appropriate door, faces the appropriate face of Kalachakra and makes offering, called \"offering mandala\". 2 a request for the initiation is made. 3 internal initiation (required for the first, third, fifth, and seventh initiations): a) the student is drawn into the mouth of the lama, passes through his body into the womb of the Mother, and melts into a drop that dissolves into emptiness. b) a seed syllable appears and transforms into a symbol, which transforms into a deity corresponding to the face of Kalachakra toward which the student is facing - the deity being embraced by the appropriate consort. c) the actual deity is drawn by the lama into the body of the student imagined to be that deity, who thereby becomes the actual deity. (The actual deity is called a \"wisdom­being\" and the imagined deity is called a \"pledge being\".) d) Light from the heart of the lama/Kalachakra draws in all of the male and female Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions. e) The lama makes offering to all the Buddhas and Bodhi­sattvas who are now nearby. f) The lama asks them to bestow initiation, and the male and female Buddhas and Bodhisattvas respond by enter­ing into absorption with their respective mates, where­upon they melt into ambrosia-light that enters the lama through his crown protrusion. g) The ambrosia-light passes through his body and emerges into the womb of the consort, the Mother Vishvamata, anointing the student, thereby conferring initiation. h) The student emerges from the womb and is set back on the initiation seat at the respective door . . 4 Obstructors are cleared away from both the students and · the initiation substance- the water, crowns, etc. -with a mantra, o� a� hu� ho� ham k�ha� and by scattering water from a conch. 5 The appropriate factors of the students - the five constit­uents, five aggregates, and so forth (see chapter six of the Introduction) - as well as the initiation substance are"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations . 107 purified in emptiness by way of reciting and reflecting on the meaning of the mantra o� shunyata-jilana-vajra­svabhavatmako 'ham, \"I have the essential· nature of In­divisible emptiness and wisdom.\" 6 The corresponding factors of the students and the initia­tion substances each appear from within the emptiness of inherent existence as syllables, which transform into sym­bols, such as vajras, which transform into deities, usually embraced by their respective mates. 7 The actual deities are drawn into these imagined beings, whereby the latter become the actual deities. 8 The deities into which the initiation substances have transformed are conferred initiation by the five Mothers from within the mandala. This is done by pouring water from vases into their bodies through the top of their heads; when their bodies are filled, a little water at the crown of their heads transforms into a deity -the latter process being called \"seal-impression\". 9 Offering is made to the deities which were the initiation substances, whereupon they become absorbed with their partners, due to which they melt, turning again into the initiation substances -the fluid of the vases, the crowns, and so forth. What started out as the initiation substance and turned into a deity now turns back into the initiation substance but in a heightened, glorified form. 10 Light rays from the heart of the lama draw into the sur­rounding area the initiation deities-the male and female Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; he makes offering to them. 11 The lama requests the initiation deities in space to confer initiation on the students. 12 The initiation deities in space thereby develop an inten­tion to confer initiation, but the actual conferral in the Kalachakra system will be done by deities from the mari­dala itself -the five female Buddhas, the five male Bud­dhas, and so forth. Each initiation will be conferred in its respective way -by touching the student with water, by putting on a crown, and so forth. 13 Since initiation is about to be conferred, a poetically thril­ling expression of the auspiciousness of the occasion is"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"108 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins made. 14 A rain of flowers falls on the students. 15 The lama/Kalachakra declares that initiation will be con­ferred and does so through appropriate deities from within the mandala by touching the students' crown protrusion, right and left shoulders, upper arms, thighs, and hips with the respective initiation substance - water, crown, and so forth. Through the touch of these special initiation sub­stances, a special bliss consciousness realizing the empti­ness of inherent existence is generated in the student; this exalted wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and emptiness is the entity of each initiation. 16 A water initiation is conferred as an appendage to each initiation (except the first, which is, itself, a water ini­tiation). The same declaration of conferring initiation is made, and the same five places are touched with water, thereby generating an exalted wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and emptiness. 17 The initiation is completed by the respective factors of the students- constituents, mental and physical aggregates, and so forth - actually turning into the corresponding deities. Doubles from the same deities in the mandala separate from them and dissolve into those deities, and all of the initiation deities assembled in space dissolve into those same deities which are purified appearances of the students' constituents, aggregates, and so forth. 18 Offering is made to the students in their divine state. 19 The meaning of the initiation and the purification that the initiation has either effected or established predispositions for effecting in the future are announced. Basically, each initiation has three phases: (1) the cleansing and purifying of the students and initiation substances by clearing away obstructors and dissolving them into empti­ness, (2) the heightening of the initiation substance through its re-appearance as a deity who melts and then transforms back into the initiation substance, and (3) the heightening of the students through their re-appearance as deities who then, by being touched with the initiation substance, engender a special bliss consciousness realizing the emptiness of inherent"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 109 existence, after which doubles of the corresponding deities dissolve into the students to whom offerings are made. (The offerings have a nature of bliss and emptiness; they appear in the aspect of offering; and their function is as objects of use of the six sense powers in order to generate special uncontami­nated bliss.110 The bliss, in turn, is used to realize the empti­ness of inherent existence. Rather than being suppressed, the senses are fulfilled with pleasant objects so that a blissful consciousness realizing emptiness can be produced. Not only is a blissful consciousness stronger, but also a ripenmg of the mental continuum has undoubtedly occurred through allow­ing the power latent in sensuous desire to become manifest.) Through imagination, body, speech, and mind are accultur­ated to a process of purification that centers around generation of a blissful, and thus powerfully withdrawn, consciousness that is used to realize the nature of phenomena. The students begin from their position in cyclic existence with abject sup­plications to the supramundane Kalachakra and in the end become Buddhas themselves. The lama/Kalachakra even makes offerings to the students. The process is reminiscent of a Tibetan scholar's description of why Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings are called \"wheels of teaching\": \"Shakyamuni turned down to students just those teachings of practices by which they could revolve upward to his state.\" CORRESPONDENCES AND ALIGNMENTS OF THE SEVEN INITIATIONS Each of the seven initiations is compared to a specific activity or stage in childhood.

The silk ribbons are long adorn­ments hung from the crown that was put on during the second initiation; thus they are somewhat similar to ear-rings that hang from the ears. There seems to be nothing in the initiation similar to piercing the ears, and there seems to be no parti­cular correspondence with the Shaktis unless a female servant pierces the ears of a child.

This initiation cleansing the avenues through which the wind that is the basis of speech moves is compared to a child's laughing and talking.

Permission Initiation The seventh, and last, initiation purifies bliss. The permis­sion initiation, conferred by Vajrasattva and Prajnaparamita, purifies the pristine consciousness aggregate and pristine consciousness constituent, both of which refer to blissful and non-conceptual states. The initiation, in which the students are told to teach doctrine to the various types of sentient beings, is compared to a father's telling a child what to read and so forth. Just as a father gives reading to a child, so the lama gives the Kalachakra Tantra to students but for them to teach others. For the permission initiation, the two seed syllables, the symbols that those syllables become, the two deities, the deities that are on their crowns as \"seal-impressions\", and the factors that they cleanse are: han:z vajra blue Vajrasattva Akshobhya pristine with Dharmadhat-consciousness vishvari aggregate k�ha� vajra blue Akshobhya pristine Prajnaparamita consciousness with Akshobhya constituent In the mandala, Vajrasattva resides on Kalachakra's head, and Prajnaparamita is fused with Kalachakra's consort, Vishva­mata. TRANSFORMATION With each internal initiation, the students are reborn in an ideal fashion. The internal initiations purify stages of development in the womb.111b The first internal initiation,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"118 The Kalachakra Ta ntra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins received from the northern, white, very peaceful, body face of Kalachakra, corresponds to the development of the students' physical constituents and aggregates in the womb. These are the bases of purification to be purified by three activities of the lama (who is in the Vajra Body aspect of Kalachakra): 1 generating the students as Vajra Body deities 2 making them indivisible from the actual Vajra Body Deity, called a Wisdom-Being 3 conferring initiation with the mind of enlightenment which is the melted form of all the Buddhas of the ten directions. In this way, the first internal initiation purifies the process of the initial development of the students' physical constituents and aggregates in the womb and establishes seeds that serve as antidotes to such uncontrolled development. In the same pattern, the second internal initiation, received from the southern, red, desirous, speech face of Kalachakra, corresponds to the development of the students' winds and channels in the womb - the winds and channels being the foundation of speech. The third internal initiation, received from the eastern, black, fierce, mind face of Kalachakra, cor­responds to the development of the students' sense powers and action faculties in the womb. The fourth internal initia­tion, received from the western, yellow, meditatively stabi­lized, pristine consciousness (bliss) face of Kalachakra, cor­responds to the development of the students' aggregate of pristine consciousness and constituent of pristine conscious­ness in the womb. (A wind of pristine consciousness is said to circulate in the womb immediately after conception). These four internal initiations purify, or establish potencies for purifying, the respective development of the students' body, speech, mind, and bliss in the womb-state. The seven initiations themselves are modelled on impor­tant events in childhood, after emergence from the womb. The water initiation corresponds to a mother's washing her newborn child; the crown initiation corresponds to fixing up the hair on the top of a child's head; the silk ribbon initiation corresponds to piercing the ears of a child and hanging on adornments; the vajra and bell initiation corresponds to a"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 119 child's laughing and talking; the conduct initiation corres­ponds to a child's enjoying the five sense objects of the Desire Realm; the name initiation corresponds to naming a child; the permission initiation corresponds to a father's giving reading and so forth to a child. Just as conception and birth are re-lived in each internal initiation, so in the seven initiations significant or even peak child}1ood events are re-enacted. Of the seven comparisons, at least four - washing the newborn child, fixing up the hair on the top of a child's head, piercing the ears of a child and hanging on adornments, and naming- are so important in the development of a child as to be marked by rites of passage.112 The other three events are also transitional; a child's first laughing and first talking (which do not occur at the same time) are pivotal events in the development of a child as experienced by the child, for the gaining of sufficient control to laugh autonomously and then to utter words under one's own control are events of enormous proportions for a child. With the initial experience of such control is a sense of wonder, of completely being involved in these activities. Also, a child's enjoying the five sense objects of the Desire Realm, whether it be the first occasion (which then would be five occasions corresponding with the five objects) or whenever such enjoy­ment occurs, is a time of interested fascination and non­conceptual enjoyment. A father's giving reading to a child also marks an introduction to the activities of one's lineage; a child approaches the first enactment of the family duties with the wonder of entering a new world. 113 These events are cited as comparisons for the seven initia­tions so that, in reinvoking and reenacting them, the wonder, non-conceptuality, and absorption integral to them can be reexperienced. Then, the wondrous, non-conceptual, ab­sorbed consciousness is to be experienced in a new context of using it to realize the emptiness of inherent existence. The power and focus of such a consciousness is put to use in penetrating the nature of persons and other phenomena. Also, these childhood experiences, still pivotal in our adult experience of ourselves and the world around us, are reframed away from unclear non-conceptuality to clear non-concep-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"120 The Ka/achakra Tantra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins tuality that understands, realizes, and comprehends the nature of objects. When a practitioner can use such happily non-conceptual consciousnesses in the path, the conscious­nesses become exalted wisdoms of undifferentiable bliss and emptiness. This means that a blissful consciousness and a consciousness realizing the emptiness of inherent existence, which are usually separate, come together in one conscious­ness; the bliss consciousness (not consciousness of bliss but bliss itselO realizes emptiness. From the viewpoint of the substances used in the seven initiations, the freshness and enjoyment of being touched with water, a crown, a silk ribbon, vajra and bell, a thumb ring, a bracelet, and the five hand-symbols are used to develop a powerful consciousness realizing the nature of phenomena. The comparison with important events in childhood and the usage of a happy, enjoying consciousness in the path suggest that peak experiences of childhood need to be re-evoked and that such happy, fresh minds need to be reframed so that they are endowed with a capacity to realize the nature of pheno­mena, the emptiness of inherent existence, rather than just being caught up in unclear non-conceptual happiness. The Four Drops Basic to this process of utilizing pivotal states and cleansing transformation of them into path-consciousnesses is a presen­tation, in the Kalachakra system, of four drops that are bases of potential and of defilement, and hence bases to be utilized and purified. There are two sets of four drops; the first set is located at (1) the forehead (or crown), (2) throat, (3) heart, and (4) navel; the second set is located at (1) the navel, (2) secret place (the base of the spine), (3) center of the sexual organ, and (4) tip of the sexual organ.114 The drops themselves are material, the size of a mustard seed and composed of the basic white and red constituents. The two sets of drops are coordinated in that (1) the drops at the forehead and the navel produce the state of wakefulness, (2) the drops at the throat and the base of the spine produce the state of dreaming, (3) the drops at the heart and the center of the sexual organ produce the state of deep sleep, and (4) the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 121 drops at the navel and the tip of the sexual organ produce the state of absorption (bliss). One drop at the navel contains within it two different predispositions producing the waking state as the fourth of the upper set of drops and producing the state of absorption as the fi rst of the lower set of drops. At the time of wakefulness, the winds - upon which con­sciousness is mounted as on a horse- of the upper part of the body collect at the forehead, and the winds of the lower part of the body collect at the navel. Due to the collection of the winds in those places and due to each drop's containing pure and impure potencies, mere appearances of objects and appear­ances of impure objects are respectively produced. At the time of dreams, the upper winds collect at the throat and the lower winds collect in the secret region, whereby mere sounds and mistaken speech are produced. At the time of deep sleep, the upper winds collect at the heart and the lower winds collect at the center of the head of the sexual organ, whereby non-conceptuality and unclarity are pro­duced. At the time of absorption of male and female, the upper winds collect at the navel and the lower winds collect at the tip of the sexual organ, whereby bliss and emission (of semen for men and \"arousal fluid\" for women) are produced. As is evident, the drops produce effects respectively with regard to body, speech, mind, and pristine consciousness (non-conceptuality and bliss) and hence are called drops of exalted body, speech, mind, and pristine consciousness and drops of body, speech, mind, and pristine consciousness, respectively. The organization of the seven initiations into the four groups of body, speech, mind, and pristine conscious­ness or bliss is, therefore, done in terms of cleansing the impure factors of these four. Through cleansing, that is, removing, the capacity in the drops at the forehead and the navel to produce the appearance of impure objects, the mere appearance of objects can be utilized in the path, whereby there come to be appearances of empty forms. Through cleansing the capacity in the drops at the throat and the base of the spine to produce mistaken speech, mere sounds can be utilized in the path, whereby they become invincible sound. Through cleansing the capa-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"122 The Kalachakra Ta ntra: Introduction by jeffrey Hopkins city in the drops at the heart and the middle of the head of the sexual organ to produce unclarity, non-conceptuality can be utilized in the path, whereby it becomes non-conceptual exalted wisdom. Through cleansing the capacity in the drops at the navel and the tip of the sexual organ to produce emis­sion, bliss can be utilized in the path, whereby it becomes immutable great bliss. Through developing these in higher and higher forms, they become the exalted vajra body, speech, mind, and pristine consciousness (bliss) of a Buddha. In the Kalachakra system, all obst.'ll::-tions are included in the obstructions of these four types in the sense that the very subtle wind and mind that abide in these drops are bases of infusion of the predispositions for the respective obstructions. In other words, the material of the drops does not constitute the obstructions and does not serve as the basis for the karmic infusion of the obstructions. Rather, the very subtle wind and mind that are located in these two sets of four places are the bases infused by our deeds with karmic potencies. In Highest Yoga Tantra, the potencies that produce impure environments and beings by way of the very subtle wind and mind that exist in the basic or ordinary state are purified by paths of skill in means, whereby they are transformed into the Form Body and the Truth Body of Buddha. In particular, in the Kalachakra system, the potencies producing impure states through the four types of drops serve as causes for the vajra body, speech, mind, and bliss of a Buddha through being purified by the path. Initiation is an introduction to this process of purification of defilement and utilization of what is basically present. OTHER CORRELATIONS Entities Of The Initiation In the water initiation, the students' crown, right and left shoulders, upper arms, thighs, and hips are touched with water, and the students drink the water. 114·' Thereby, physical defilements of their five impure constituents are cleansed, and great bliss is generated in mind and body. The bliss consciousness ascertains emptiness such that a special exalted"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 123 wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and realization of emptiness is generated in the students' continuums. That exalted wis­dom of bliss and emptiness is the entity of the water initiation; all of the other steps are causal factors producing it, not the actual water initiation. In the crown initiation, the students' five places are touched with the crown which is also worn, whereby all defilements of the appearance and conception of the five mental and physical aggregates as being ordinary are cleansed, and great bliss is generated in mind and body. The bliss consciousness ascer­tains emptiness such that a special exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness is generated in the students' continuums. That exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness is the entity of the crown initiation. It can be imagined that when the crown is put on the head, ambrosia streams forth from it filling the body, cleansing it and generating the exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness. In the silk ribbon initiation, the students' five places are touched with silk ribbons which are also tied on their fore­head. From them, ambrosia streams forth, filling the body, cleansing defilements of the ten winds and generating the exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness that is the entity of the silk ribbon initiation. In the vajra and bell initiation, the students' five places are touched with vajra and bell which are also set on their head and then given into their hands. From vajra and bell, ambrosia streams forth, filling the body, cleansing defilements of the two channels and generating the exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness that is the entity of the vajra and bell initiation. In the conduct initiation, the students' five places are touched with a thumb ring which is also worn on the thumb. From it, ambrosia streams forth, fi lling the body, cleansing defilements of the sense powers and their objects and generat­ing the exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness that is the entity of the conduct initiation. In the name initiation, the students' five places are touched with bracelets which are also worn on the arms.

It is called a \"name initiation\" because through the purification of the action faculties and their activities, one becomes suitable to be a basis for the name ·Ak!?hobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amoghasiddhi, Arni­tabha, or Vairochana. In the permission initiation, the students' five places are touched with five hand-symbols - vajra, sword, jewel, lotus, and wheel- which are also given into their hands. From them, ambrosia streams forth, filling the body, cleansing defile­ments of pristine mind (bliss) and generating the exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness that is the entity of the permis­sion initiation. Then, just as a universal monarch controls all four conti­nents through a jewelled wheel, a wheel is given to the student as a causal factor for turning the wheel of doctrine. A conch is given for the sake of proclaiming the sound of doctrine. Also, a book of the Kiilachakra Tantra is given so that the students can fill themselves with its meaning and thereupon tum the wheel of Kalachakra doctrine for others. Then, a bell repre­senting the emptiness of inherent existence is given as a reminder of the realization of the status of all persons and all phenomena within which the teaching of doctrine is to be done. Just as a father gives reading and so forth in accordance with the family lineage, so the lama/Kalachakra calls on the students to teach the Buddhist doctrine. That this is to be done in accordance with the dispositions and interests of trainees is indicated by giving the five hand symbols representing the five lineages. Just as the four internal initiations are concerned with puri­fying the process of development of body, speech, mind, and bliss in the womb, so the corresponding four groups into which the seven initiations are divided are concerned with purifying the process of development of body, speech, mind, and bliss in childhood after leaving the womb. Since it is explained that the bliss constituent is completed at age six­teen, 114b the period of childhood development that is the focus of these seven initiations presumably is to age sixteen."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 125 The seven initiations also are correlated with the first seven Bodhisattva grounds, each one establishing potencies for achieving the respective level. Just as each of the seven initia­tions is an entity of the exalted wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and emptiness, so each Bodhisattva ground is a higher and higher level of meditative equipoise directly realizing emptiness, the wisdom consciousness serving as a basis, or ground, for the flowering of numerous, beneficial qualities. Nevertheless, to achieve any of the seven Bodhisattva grounds, practitioners must receive the higher initiations and practice the stage of completion. The first six initiations also authorize practitioners to work at achieving feats respectively by way of the five Mothers, the five Buddhas, ten Shaktis, the principal Father Deity and Mother Deity, the male and female Bodhisattvas, and the male and female Wrathful Deities. They also establish potencies in the mental continuum for achieving the five Mothers, the five Buddhas, and the ten perfections, as well as for binding the wind from the right and left channels in the central channel, achieving vajra sense powers and sense fields, and over­coming the four demons through the four irnmeasurables. The first two initiations establish potencies for vajra body; the next two, for vajra speech; the next two, for vajra mind; and the last (although unmentioned) for vajra bliss. All seven initiations together cleanse defilements of ill-deeds, authorize cultivating the stage of generation and the achievement of the final worldly feats of the Highest Pure Land, set potencies in the continuum for the collection of merit, and bestow practices and releases related with the stage of generation. Practitioners who have received the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood cultivate a stage of generation that is able to purify both the external and internal bases of purification. The bases of purification are the external worldly environment and the channels, winds, and drops of a person; these are called, respectively, the external Kiilachakra and the internal Kiilachakra. For this, meditative cultivation of either a com­plete mandala of body, speech, and mind, or of just the mind mandala (which here means the top three levels of the man-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins dala), or of a mandala of five or more deities is needed. A simple meditation of just Kalachakra or of just Kalachakra with consort is not sufficient to fulfill the stage of generation. This meditative cultivation of the path, the means of purifica­tion, is called the alternative Kii/achakra as is initiation also. Such a stage of generation is said to serve as a means of ripening roots of virtue for fully generating the stage of com­pletion. ALTRUISTIC TRANSMUTATION Through being introduced, during the initiation, to utilizing the Buddha nature- the luminous and knowing nature of the mind and the emptiness of inherent existence of the mind- as a basis of physical, verbal, and mental manifestation, practi­tioners make a transition to a new mode of life, away from being driven by afflictive emotions and to a state of validly founded freedom that is in the service of altruistic expression. Practitioners have been authorized to practice and have been introduced to the practice of deity yoga, the very appearance of altruistically motivated wisdom in physical form, mimicking a Buddha's manifestation in numerous Form Bodies from within the Truth Body. Tantric practice, although using the model of the goal -Buddhahood with Truth and Form Bodies- in the path, is still in process toward the goal of altruistic perfection. In other words, that the model of the final state is used in the path does not mean that the goal is conceived as actually being fully manifest in the present state. Rather, the process of the path is modelled after the goal-state. Also, despite using desire in the path, it is clear from the numerous cleansings that have occur­red in this ritual that tantric practice is still aimed at cleansing the afflictive emotions of desire, hatred, and so forth as well as the entire process of cyclic existence through mimicking its processes in a profoundly different context. There are \"upward mimickings\" of Buddhahood and \"downward mirnickings\" of the uncontrolled processes of cyclic existence. A prime technique in both of these is to evoke blissful, non­conceptual experiences that are usually associated with un-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Procedure of the Initiations 127 clarity and to utilize those powerful consciousnesses in a clear, insightful way penetrating the nature of phenomena so that afflictive emotions are impossible. Also, that altruism is at the very heart of the process is clear from the fact that the initiation begins with an adjustment of motivation toward altruism and ends with authorization to teach by way of the wise altruism that takes account of individual predispositions and interests. APPENDAGES Of the two appendages to the permission initiation, the main is the second, the vajra master initiation. It is preceded by four branches- giving mantra, eye medicine, mirror, and bow and arrow; let us discuss these first. Mantra is given because both common feats and the un­common feat of Buddhahood depend upon mantra practice. Common feats of pacification of illness, etc., increase of intel­ligence, lifespan, etc., subjugation, and ferocity are accomp­lished based on the usage of mantras during the stage of generation. These are called provisional mantras in relation to the definitive mantra, an actual exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness, through which the supreme feat of Buddhahood is accomplished. Then, since the view of the emptiness of inherent existence is essential to mantra practice, both provisional and defini­tive, eye medicine, mirror, and bow and arrow are given to establish predispositions in the mind, respectively, for real­izing emptiness conceptually, for realizing that all appearing and occurring phenomena are like illusions in that they appear to exist inherently but do not, and for realizing empti­ness directly. The dramatic experience of realizing emptiness through the medium of an internal image (not just discursively putting together words about emptiness but incontrovertibly realizing it) is like the experience of seeing after having cata­racts removed. The experience of phenomena as like illusions is like seeing objects in a mirror. The totally non-dual experi­ence of emptiness in which the emptiness of inherent exis­tence and the wisdom consciousness realizing it are fused is"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"128 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins like an arrow piercing its target deeply. These analogs are given so that students will imaginatively enact states that are similar to the wisdom experiences being sought, thereby con­ditioning the mind in those directions. The metaphors bring home some sense of what it would be like to see without a film of ignorance, what it would be like to see everything as dis­cordant with its appearance, and what it would be like for the mind to pierce into emptiness. The students are directed to imagine that they have attained the \"eye\" seeing the reality of the emptiness of inherent existence, that they have attained realization -subsequent to meditative equipoise on empti­ness - of phenomena as like reflections, and that they have attained direct realization of emptiness. Imagining such establishes potencies for actually doing so. In the vajra master initiation, the main appendage, the initiation substances are a vajra and a bell. These, along with the students, dissolve into emptiness. The students and the vajra reappear as Vajrasattvas, and the bell reappears as the goddess Prajnaparamita (\"Perfection of Wisdom\"). All of them become the actual deities by drawing the Wisdom Beings (the actual deities) into themselves. The deities are conferred initiation, whereupon those that are the new appearances of the initiation substances melt and tum into vajra and bell. The vajra is first given to the student as a symbol of the exalted wisdom of great bliss, and then the bell is given as a symbol of the wisdom realizing emptiness. These two- great bliss and the wisdom realizing emptiness - are to be gener­ated as one consciousness, the great bliss consciousness itself realizing emptiness. That great bliss wisdom consciousness itself appears as a divine body, called a great seal divine body. Technically speaking, the \"apprehension aspect\" (bzung rnam) of the great bliss consciousness appears as a body, but this is explained as meaning that the consciousness itself appears as a deity. The appearance factor of the great bliss consciousness appears as a divine body, and the ascertainment factor continues to realize the emptiness of inherent existence. In this way, the factors of altruistic method and wisdom of the final nature of pheno-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Procedu,-e of the Initiations 129 mena are contained in one consciousness. This is the one undifferentiable entitv of method and wisdom in tantra -deity yoga. The entitv of the vajra master initiation is just this appear;:mce of the blissful wisdom consciousness realizing emptiness in divine fonn. As a master initiation at this point, it authorizes students to teach Action, Performance, and Yoga Tantra. (The initiation authorizing students to teach Highest Yoga Tantra comes after the four high and four greatly high initi ations). The vajra, representing bliss, is associated with mind. The bell, al though representing the wisdom realizing emptiness, is associated with speech in that the wisdom realizing empti­ness is the dominant condition giving rise to a Buddha's effortlessly and spont: meously teaching whatever is appro­priate to whatsoever trainees. Also, the emptiness of inherent existence is the main topic taught through the speech of all Buddhas since it must be realized (and that realization must be enhanced with altruistic method) to bring about the state of perpetual help and happiness of Buddhahood. The sound of the bell is considered to proclaim the meaning of the empti­ness of inherent existence. The great seal, representing a divine body, is associated with body. Thus, the three pledges of vajra, bell, and seal are concerned with body, speech, and mind. By taking the initiation, the students pledge to be mindful of such great bliss, realization of emptiness, and its appearance in divine form through holding vajra and bell and crossing them at the heart. In this context, \"great bliss\" does not refer to the bliss arising from embracing a consort, etc., for those bliss con­sciousnesses realizing emptiness are the entities of the four high and four greatly high initiations that authorize practice of the stage of completion The harmony between the stage of generation and the stage of completion is that in both blissful consciousnesses are utilized to realize the mode of being of phenomena and to become the stuff of new appearance.

Self-entry is performed by practitioners who have already received initiation, for the sake of purifying infrac­tions of vows and so forth; practitioners themselves imagine all of the lama's activities involved in entering into the man­dala and receiving initiation. Because the section on the seven initiations authorizing practice of the stage of generation was written mainly in terms of practitioners performing self-entry, it has been supple­mented with material from the Initiation Rite of Kalachakra, Stated in an Easy Way ( dus 'khor dbang chog nag 'gros su bkod pa) by Lo-sang-tsul-trim-den-bay-gyel-tsen (blo bzang tshul khrims bstan pa'i rgyal mtshan), a late nineteenth and early twentieth century scholar from Kam Province (khams) known also as f>re-wo Kang-sar-Gyap-gon Rin-bo-chay (tre bo skyabs mgon khang gsar rin po che)Y6 This latter text was written"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":". 132 The Kiilachakra Ta ntra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins solely for the sake of adapting the former text to conducting an initiation ceremony. The latter text does not contain the prior ritual of enhancement of the student and hence is not com­plete even in terms of what the initiator must perform for students. However, Kay-drup's text covers all of the stages involved in an initiation ritual, ranging from the rite for taking over the land where the ritual is conducted to the greatly high initiations. Other aspects of the ritual are not complete in Kay-drup's text but can be found in Lo-sang-tsul­trim-den-bay-gyel-tsen's. For instance, Kay-drup's Mandala Rite seldom gives full descriptions of deities, indicating these with ellipses; these, therefore, have been supplemented from Lo-sang-tsul-trim-den-bay-gyel-tsen's Initiation Rite. Thus, the two texts together contain the entire rite. However, since there are seven initiations with a great deal of repetition, both texts tend to cite in full only once material requiring repetition. To give a more complete picture of the process of initiation, in the translation here, all of these repeti­tions have been stated in full rather than merely indicated by ellipses. The portion of Kay-drup's Mandala Rite translated in this book concerns the initiations for the stage of generation and, specifically, those parts involving the student, not the preced­ing sections during which the lama is making preparations. Kay-drup's text is divided into six parts, of which the sections in the sixth part concerned with authorizing students to prac­tice the stage of generation are translated here. The six parts of the text are: 1 the qualifications of a master who confers initiation, 261.2 2 the qualifications �f a student on whom initiation is con­ferred, 262.1 3 divisions of types of mandalas in which initiation is con­ferred, 262.7 4 the number and order of the initiations that are conferred, 264.2 5 the time of conferral, 265.7 6 the ac�ual rite for conferring initiation, 266.1.

The first topic is handled in a single line of text. The second topic is again subdivided into four parts: 1 rite for the place, 266.3 2 rite of enhancement, 282.5 3 actual rite, 305.6 4 rite of conclusion. Among many subdivisions of the rite of enhancement, the second topic, is the rite of enhancing, or preparing, the stu­dent (Kay 295.1/Bu 184.1). 117 It is the first activity performed with the students who are to receive initiation, and thus the translation in this book begins here. The enhancement of the student has six parts: 1 adjusting the motivation and conferring the internal initia­tion, Kay 295.1/Bu 184.1 2 making a supplication and causing [the student] to appre­hend the doctrine, Kay 296.1/Bu 185.1 3 assuming the vows and blessing, Kay 296.6/Bu 185.6 4 casting the tooth stick and giving handfuls of water and so forth, Kay 298.4/Bu 186.7 5 setting the six lineages and evoking Vajrasattva, Kay 299.2/ Bu187.5 6 generating enthusiasm through explaining doctrine and giving advice on analyzing dreams, Kay 299.4/Bu 187.7. Although in Kay-drup's text there are other steps following the enhancement of the students, in practice those are done prior to the enhancement of the student so that the actual initiation ritual can be conducted immediately after the en­hancement, on the next day.

In 1984 he was appointed head of the Ge-luk-ba order.

His next younger brother, Ba-so­cho-gyi-gyel-tsen (ba so chos kyi rgyal mtshan, 1402-1473) became a famous adept in the Ge-luk-ba order. 121 Kay-drop, before becoming Dzong-ka-ba's disciple, was a learned scholar of the Sa-gya-ba order of Tibetan Buddhism. Ge-luk-bas look on Kay-drup's conversion as an important indication of the strength, cogency, and persuasiveness of Dzong-ka-ba's intellectual prowess and personality. Kay­drop wrote important works on logic and epistemology, on the views on emptiness in the Mind Only School, Autonomy School, and Middle Way School, and so forth as well as on the tantric systems of Hevajra and Guhyasamaja, and wrote proli­fically on the Kalachakra system (see p.63).

Kay-drup is thereby seen as carrying out, over a continuum of lives, an intense and altruistically motivated dedication to the fur­therance of Buddha's doctrine, especially that of Kalachakra, his very life being an exemplification of the giving of doctrine, the supreme form of giving.

That this is so is established by scripture and reasoning and is clear, in implicit form, in his biography. However, let us speak a little here about his biography in accordance with the perspective of how common trainees perceive it. Past Lives While the Teacher Shakyamuni Buddha was dwelling in the world, this foremost lama was born as a novice, called Kama­lashila (padma'i ngang tshu/), under the Superior Kashyapa. He came to be familiar with all three scriptural collections -discipli.ne, sets of discourses, and manifest knowledge- and was endowed with the courage of knowledge and release. For this_ reason, even in his life as Kay-drup, the foremost Dzong­ka-ba appeared in a dream, speaking the Kashyapa Chapter Sidra ('os srung gi le'u, kashyapaparivarta), whereupon Kay­drup generated special realization. The dream-appearance rekindled predispositions established from his earlier hearing the same teaching while a student of Kashyapa. Furthermore, the foremost Kay-drup earlier took rebirth as Maiijushnl<irti, the compiler of the Condensed Kalachakra Tantra, 123 and also as famous scholars and upholders or the three scriptural collections in India. When he took rebirth as the Indian scholar Abhayakara, he composed the Ocean of Means of Achievement (sgrub thabs rgya mtsho), and so forth, as. directed by Manjushri. Among those many books was a work entitled Ornament to the Subduer's Thought (thub pa 'i dgongs rg yan, munimatalamkara), 124 which is one of the twenty-one commentaries on Maitreya's Ornament for Clear Realization (mngon par rtogs pa'i rg yan, abhisamayalan:zkara) but also is a commentary on Buddha's thought in general. Morever, when this foremost lama took rebirth as the pa�­qi�a Rik-bay-ku-chuk the Greater, he was under the care of the glorious Chandrakirti, thereby coming to eradicate the bonds of extreme views. At a certain point, Chandrakirti said, \"In the future, the venerable Manjushri will take birth as a monk in an outlying area. You also should take birth there, achieve his word, and spread the teaching.\" The outlying area"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"142 The Kiilachakra Tantra: In troduction by Jeffrey Hopkins is Tibet, and Manjushri took birth as Dzong-ka-ba.125 Scholarship Through the force of his having trained in the topics of know­ledge over many lives and through the force of his being under the care of the venerable Manjushri, in this life also, even in his youth, his analytical intelligence was unimpeded with respect to the meaning of the three scriptural collections and the four tantra sets. Due to this, he became a great opener of a chariot-way at the head of all scholars. How was this manifested? When this foremost lama was sixteen years old, the great scholar Bo-dong-chok-lay-nam-gyel (bo dong phyogs las rnam rgyal, 1376-1451) announced that he would refute the Treasury of Reasoning (rigs gter) of Sa-gya Pandita Gun-ga­gyel-tsen (sa skya pandita kun dga' rgyal mtshan, 1182-1251), 126 and asked what Sa-gya-ba could answer him. Everyone was discouraged and did not dare answer. At that point, the patron of the Jang-ngam-ring-ba Monastery (byang ngam ring pa) called together all the scholars, saying, \"Bo-dong-wa is refuting the venerable Sa-gya Pandita; therefore, who among you can pluck out the feathers of this bad bird? To whoever can I will give a great reward.\" All of the scholars gathered at Jang-ngam-ring-ba Mona­stery. In the middle of their assembly a seat was made for Bo-dong-chok-lay-nam-gyel, and the patron himself sat on the throne. With all of the scholars in front of him, Bo-dong systematically refuted Sa-gya Pandita's Treasury of Reasoning; since none of the scholars could respond, it was decided after the first day that the text was fraught with self-contradiction. The patron then quizzed them on who could put up a defense, and the next day this great being Kay-drup, who was only sixteen years old, dispelled all of the faults imputed to Sa-gya Pa�cp�a and with stainless reasoning thoroughly refuted the tenets that Bo-dong-chok-lay-nam-gyel himself posited. When Kay-drup made it so that he could not even answer, Bo-dong could only say that these were inner contradictions of the tenets of the Sutra School (mdo sde pa, sautriintika) that Sa-gya Pancp�a was explicating. Kay-drup accomplished other such feats of scholarship in"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Author of the Mandala Rite 143 debate, defeating, for instance, the scholar Yak-ba (g.yag pa) in the assembly hall. Through having trained in the fields of knowledge over many lives, no scholar could compete with him. Encountering Dzong-ka-ba When Kay-drup first met the foremost Dzong-ka-ba, like the Bodhisattva Always-Crying (rtag tu ngu, sadaprarudita) when he saw Dharmodgata, from merely seeing Dzong-ka-ba's glo­rious form the hairs of his body powerlessly rose, tears of faith streamed from his eyes, and he spontaneously uttered words of praise. Due to former connection, as soon as they met, unparalleled firm faith was engendered. That night while dreaming, he became sunk and confused in an omnipresent thick darkness for a long time; then from the east appeared a great wheel with hundreds of swords standing on end and with their handles turned to the center. At the tips of the swords were many hundred of suns, and in the center of the wheel in the midst of a rainbow was the venerable Manjushri, with orange body, holding a sword and a book, adorned with jewelled adornments, so youthful that looking knew no satisfaction. Happily, Manjushri came to Kay-drup and dissolved into him, whereupon a great sun dawned, immediately clearing away all darkness. The lattice­work of its radiance filled the entire world. That was his dream. The next dav when he met Dzong-ka-ba, he reported his dream and asked what it meant. The foremost Dzong-ka-ba answered, \"You saw your lama and tutelary deity as undiffer­entiable. You are a jewel-like person who is a special, intended trainee of Mantra. Just as you saw me as the venerable Man­jushri, so I am in fact, but persons of low intelligence see me as ordinary. You will bring great help to many trainees.\" Then, the foremost Dzong-ka-ba asked, \"Who is your tute­lary deity?\" Kay-drup replied, \"Orange Mar1jushri and Rak­tayamari.\" Dzong-ka-ba continued, \"In general whether you take Rak­tayamari, Kr�hr:ayamari, or Bhairavil as your tutelary deity, Manjushri looks after you since these three are increasing"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"144 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins degrees of ferocity of Maiijushr i; however, since my trans­mission is looked after and blessed by Manjushri, you should take Bhairava as your tutelary deity [since the fiercest form is most effacacious). .. There are many special purposes; others do not understand the importance of these.\" Then, without having to be asked, Dzong-ka-ba immediately conferred the initiation of Vajrabhairava. From that point on, Kay-drup performed the daily rite without break. This lama in time became a foremost spiritual son of the venerable Dzong-ka-ba. 127 Through the force of his partaking continually of the ambrosia of Dzong-ka-ba's speech, he attained the rank of a great opener of a chariot-way, endowed with non-erroneous knowledge of the three scriptural collec­tions and the four tantra sets. Through the force of his great compassion such that he had affection for all beings the way a mother does for her sole child, many fortunate trainees were filled with the ambrosia of his good explanations. Also, in order that future trainees might understand that the body of the path leading to liberation and omniscience­the tracks of passage by the previous Conquerors - is as the foremost Dzong-ka-ba indicated it, in general he made many commentaries on Buddha's word and their commentaries and in particular wrote many treatises clarifying extremely dense diamond-like phraseology and very profound topics of ex­pression in the word of Dzong-ka-ba. He made these as plain as an olive set in your hand. His writings comprise the nine volumes of his Collected Works [that contain fifty-eight separate treatises). In brief, without consideration for goods, service, or style, he, out of consideration solely for the teaching and sentient beings' welfare, performed countless acts of explanation, debate, and composition concerning the Conqueror Buddha's teachings.

In this case, the com­mentator is His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama has published his autobiography129 and John F.

It gives a glimpse of the importance of this prominent world religious . figure throughout the Tibetan cultural region. Liushar Thupten Tharpa was a member of the Tibetan cabi­net at the time of the escape to India in 1959, often called \"Foreign Minister\" in a cabinet that did not assign particular portfolios.

He gave this account at the University of Virginia in 1975 and carefully made cor­rections later after his return to India. He had been known in the west as Thupten Tharpa Liushar but directed me to put the family name, Liushar, first. Al­though he had lived according to the Westernized version of his name in New York, now, in retirement, he had decided to do it his way as a Tibetan. His presence naturally commanded respect, one of his compatriots in the Tibetan government telling me that he derived his power from mantra; indeed his lips were in slight, almost constant motion even as he listened to others talk. My fondest memory of my old friend, who passed away in 1984, involves a discussion I had with several Tibetan scholars at the monastery in new Jersey. I had expressed the opinion that the view of the absence of inherent existence did indeed seem to be supreme, but that a combination of it with a view that conventionally subject and object are of the same entity was very attractive to me. The scholars were silent at my suggestion of a combination of the views of the Consequence and the Mind Only Schools, but later in the temple Liushar Thupten Tharpa motioned to me to come look at a page of one of Dzong-ka-ba's texts. The line was a direction to practi­tioners to view themselves and all the other deities of the mandala, as well as the residence mandala, as one entity, manifestations of the same compassionately motivated wis­dom consciousness. I started to take the text to the scholars, but he took my arm with one hand and put a finger of his other hand to his lips.

Therefore, he said, \"From now on, you must take great care, great caution ... I am almost fifty-eight years old and will not be able to do the work of politics much longer.\" People did not pay much attention at the time, but during the next year when he actually became fifty-eight, he died. That was in 1933. The night of his death, word went out that he had died, and the government workers as well as a great mass of other people gathered at his summer palace. The very next morning, the clouds in the sky were arranged like a rainbow pointing east; everyone thought, \"He must be taking rebirth in the east.\" For about two years we engaged in vast offerings, prayer making, and so forth for the sake of his taking speedy reincar­nation. According to custom, we took the remains of the body ofthe Dalai Lama to the Potala, the big palace just on the edge of Hla-sa, and put them in a large golden stupa in a huge chapel. There are many such reliquaries in this room, the largest of which are those of the Fifth and Thirteenth Dalai Lamas, about fifty feet high and gilded with gold. It took us two or three years to make the reliquary for the Thirteenth Dalai Lama's remains and to build a little temple for it on the west side of the Potala next to this main chapel. We spread word throughout the country for parents of new-born babies to notice whether the child had any special features, whether prior to its birth the parents had any unusual dreams, whether there were special signs associated with the birth, or whether the child had special knowledge, and to inform the government when such occurred. Since, for the identification of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, the oracle had advised consulting a lake southeast of Hla-sa in which the details of his birthplace appeared clearly, we did the same this time. We say that this lake, situated up in a mountain range, is the place of residence of the Glorious Goddess (dpalldan lha mo). Ra-dreng Rin-bo-chay (ra sgreng rin po che), who was the regent, headed a party that went to see what would appear. The regent performed various rites, at the conclusion of which those in the party saw many buildings in the lake. It was like"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Author of the Commentary 149 watching a movie; they could see everything. They saw a three-tiered, blue-roofed temple, like a pagoda. There was a roadway, a small villager's house, and then another small house. This turned out to be an exact picture of the place where the Dalai Lama was born. Having seen this, the regent held a meeting and explained what he had seen, including three big letters which had appeared in the lake-\" A,\" \"Ka\", \"Ma\". Everyone wondered and compared thoughts about what this could mean. Subse­quently, the government sent lamas to the four directions of Tibet to investigate and see what they could find. People came to these lamas and government officials with special children who had been born in that period. The actual Dalai Lama was born in Am-do province in an area we call Si-ling which on Western maps is listed as Kokonor, \"Blue Lake.\" Though in Tibet, Kum-bum, the birthplace of Dzong-ka-ba, founder of the Ge-luk-ba order, was controlled by China. It took about two hours by horse to go from Kum-bum monastery to the Dalai Lama's birthplace. Because a Chinese type building had appeared in the lake and they figured that such a scene could only be found in an area controlled by China, a lama called Ge-tsang (ke'u tshang) had gone to Kum-bum with five or six government officials. His party pretended to be on pilgrimage, not openly seeking the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. Asking here and there if any special children had been born recently in the area, they heard from several people that there was one born to parents who had had many special dreams prior to the birth of the child and around whose house rainbows had appeared at the time of birth. Continuing their pretense of being on pilgrimage, the party went to this house and asked, \"Will you please give us a place to stay for a few days?\" The Dalai Lama at that time was about three years old and, as soon as he saw them, came running up as if he knew them, but they just pretended that it did not mean anything and were only friendly in a normal way to him.

The letter was sent to the central government, which asked them to investigate again. They did and answered back, \"There is no mistake.\" The body of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama had been put in a reliquary in the new temple in the Potala Palace beside which were two wooden columns. Two objects like elephant tusks about a foot high grew out of the floor by the eastern pillars; pictures were taken, and I presume they still can be seen nowadays. These were interpreted as signs that he had been born in the east. Also, despite the fact that it was winter, flowers grew forth on the Dalai Lama's platform-like throne in an outdoor amphitheatre where lectures are given. It was winter, no one was planting seeds or bringing water, but flowers grew forth. People were amazed and wondered why this was. We understood only later that as they were \"dragon flowers,\" it was a sign that in the year of the Dragon, which was 1940, the Dalai Lama would ascend the throne. At this time, the people of Hla-sa started singing, apparently without any reason, something like, \"To long-life lake lady, beautiful flower.\" \"Long-life\" (Tse-ring, spelled tshe ring) indicated the father's name, which was Tse-ring, and the \"Lake Lady\" (Tso-mo, spelled mtsho mo) is the name of his mother, Tso-mo. There were many such signs, but we did not pay any attention at the time. Upon receiving direction from Hla-sa, the party continued their investigation. With them, the investigators had brought two rosaries, a small drum, and a walking stick that had belonged to the previous Dalai Lama and also similar items that had not. The child was first shown two identical black"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Author of the Commentary 151 rosaries, and he picked up the right one. Then he was shown two identical yellow rosaries, and once again his preference fell on the right rosary. After this, the child was shown two small drums, of which the actual drum was far poorer than the second drum, which was beautifully carved and had dazzling flappers attached to it. The investigators thought that the child would choose the more attractive and larger drum, but he chose the correct one and started playing it. He picked up one walking stick and looked at it but put that one down and picked up the other one, the right one. So he picked out exactly the right ones. They were amazed and believed that he was the Dalai Lama. They sent word back to Hla-sa describing all that had occurred. The decision about the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama has to be correct, so the government wanted to analyze even more. In front of a very important and valuable image from the time of King Song-dzen-gam-bo (srong btsan sgam po, 569-650) the regent spun two balls in a cup; the balls were made of mois­tened ground parched barley, little dough balls wrapped around paper that had the names of the two principal candi­dates written on them. That which spun out of the cup first was broken open, revealing the name Hla-mo-don-drup (lha mo don grub), the name given to the Fourteenth Dalai Lama by his parents. The other ball of dough contained the name of the second candidate. This mode of prophecy confirmed that they were unmistaken, and thus it was finally decided that he was the incarnation. At that time in Si-ling, the main city of the Blue Lake area, there was a terrible governor, Ma-bu-fang, who happened to be not a Buddhist but a Moslem. Thus, the party had to be secretive, not letting on that they thought that this was the actual Dalai Lama. They told the governor, \"We are looking for the incarnation of the Dalai Lama and have a child here who, like several others, is unusual. To analyze this, we wish to invite him to Hla-sa. After further analysis, we will identify from among them the correct one, but we have not been able to come to any decision.\" However, the governor thought, 'This just might be the Dalai Lama,\" so he answered, \"If you think that he is the Dalai Lama, you had better decide right"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"152 The Kalachakra Tantra: Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins no�.\" The governor sent word to the parents to come with their child. He picked up the child, put him on his lap, and asked, \"Are you the Dalai Lama?\" The Dalai Lama said, \"Yes, lam.\" The governor sought some means to prevent the search party from taking him; so he passed word to Kum-bum monastery that he would send the child there for them to decide whether he was in fact the Dalai Lama. They spent two years deciding, and in the end we had to pay Ma-bu-fang a huge sum of money. He was first presented with a hundred thousand Chinese silver dollars and was later given three hundred thousand Chinese silver dollars along with one whole set of the canon, both the teachings of Buddha and their Indian commentaries- printed in letters of gold. In 1940 we were finally able to invite the new Dalai Lama to 'Hla-sa. The trip was over the plains, and as we did not have any roads or cars and so forth, all had to be on horse. We had a chariot, carried by mules, made for him. It took two months on the road. There were escorts sent out from Hla-sa to meet him at various places, and I was sent out as the escort for the third in the escort series. ·, I met him one pass beyond Nak-chu, about seven or eight days from Hla-sa by horse. As the meeting place was just over il pass, we crossed it and waited. We prepared offerings, tents, and a throne, making a place for the party to stay for that and the next night. First we welcomed him in a tent. He was presented with a �etter stating that it had been formally decided that he was the Dalai Lama. He was only five years old at that time but was not like other children at all; it was very amazing. Then in Nak-chu itself the central government had made extensive preparations for welcoming the Dalai Lama at the big monastery. There were two or three thousand people, and he was put on a very high throne with his father and mother off to the side on a much lower platform. Other children would not be able to stay in such a place for a long time; they would want to go to their mother and so forth, but people were coming to see him, and he had to spend two hours there. He just sat still for two hours. Other children at least would"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Author of the Commentary 153 have looked around, watching what was going on very care­fully. However, it was as if he had seen it all before, not paying any attention. I was amazed, very much amazed. Every day we spent two or three hours on the road, only a little time each day travelling. Two or three days from Hla-sa, a great tent community was set up for the government officials, the noble families, and so forth to meet him. Three monks who had been his servants also met him. One is something like a butler, taking care of his food, seeing that it is prepared, and presenting it to him. Another solely takes care of his clothing, seeing that it is clean, taken out, prepared, put away. The third prepares all of the religious articles that are necessary for rites and rituals. These are the three main servants; their positions are very high. The religious servant had brought with him a tang-ga, a painting of the Glorious Goddess, which is kept in a red case with a cap on it. From the time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, the tang-ga itself has been considered to be the same as the Glorious Goddess herself. Never opened, it is always left rolled up. It is kept with the Dalai Lama wherever he goes - he is never separate from it. The servant had placed it near the opening of the tent, and as the Dalai Lama passed by, he grabbed it, took it inside the tent, and immediately opened it up. It is usually never seen but they saw it at that time. Then he rolled it back up and put it back in its case. Everyone was amazed at what he had done. He was brought into Hla-sa itself to the main temple to pay respect to the images and then was immediately taken to the summer palace, not the Potala, which is the winter one, but the Nor-bu-ling-ga. During the first month of the Tibetan year in 1941, which would be in the second month of the Western calendar, he was invited to his main residence, the Potala, and the actual investiture was done at that time. On the day he was installed, the two tutors were there, one being the regent Ra-dreng and the other Dak-tra Rin-bo-chay. The regent gave the Dalai Lama the name Jay-dzun-jam-bel­nga-wang-fo-sang-ye-shay-den-dzin-gya-tso-si-sum-wang­gyur-tsung-ba-may-bay-day-bel-sang-bo131 that day when he was installed.

His head was shaved like a monk, with a little longer hair on top; then this was cut as the sign of his having become a novice monk. The abbot asked at that time, \"Do you go homeless?\" \"Yes, I go homeless.\" He assumed residence in the Potala and began studying. Even though he was very young, it was almost as if he did not have to be taught the alphabet and so forth. Other children would need a place to go, others to play with, and so forth, but all that he had were these three old servants - any other child would stay a while and then find it very difficult, saying, \"I want to go to my mother. \" He did none of this. Sometimes his mother did visit, but otherwise, he was alone, reading books in his room. Occasionally they would send in his brother who was just a little older than he. When the Dalai Lama was thirteen years old, it was time for him to go to visit the monastic colleges at Ore-bung and Se-ra. This was like entering into the monastic college and becoming a more studious monk. Each of the colleges made great pre­parations for him. He spent three weeks in Ore-bung and two in Se-ra to mark his entry into formal study of philosophy. He had two main tutors and eight excellent ge-shays, Doctors of Philosophy, to discuss the topics back and forth. All of these remained with him wherever he stayed, in the winter or the summer palace. At age sixteen, the Chinese first invaded eastern Tibet in Kam Province. Although the Dalai Lamas are usually installed as the head of the government at the age of eighteen, everyone thought that the Dalai Lama should take over the government immediately because it was such a dangerous time. Thus, at a very young age, he took responsibility for the government, a tr emendous burden since this was the periL)d that the Chinese came into Tibet. Throughout, he continued his studies and at twenty-five, in 1958, became a ge-shay. In order to do so, he had to debate in front of the other. ge-shays at Ore-bung monastery.

This was in 1959, and subsequent to it he was given the title of a highest rank ge-shay. It was just a month after becoming a ge-shay that he had to escape to India, . where he has stayed until now. There are about eighty thousand refugees in India, and their place of hope is the Dalai Lama; there is no one else. In conversations with the Indian government we, as his representatives, have arranged for settlements for Tibetans. Thus, even though we are refugees, we are in quite a good situation. We have in­dependence to engage in our own religion and do what we want as if it were our own country. Those left in Tibet are in a very bad situation of suffering. There is nothing that we can do for them now, but the Dalai Lama has assumed the burden of freeing them from misery. He has been able to make visits to Japan, Thailand, and Europe, not as a head of government, but as a private citizen. His idea of visiting, especially the West, is to exchange ideas, to find out what Western ideas are and for him to present some Eastern ideas. Therefore, perhaps there is hope that when he comes to America, you can ask him about the Buddhist doc­trine. By the way, of the three letters in the lake, \"A\" stood for Am-do, which is the province where the Dalai Lama was born. \"Ka\" stood for Kum-bum monastery, which was nearby. Most people felt \"Ma\" referred to his mother, but I asked the Dalai Lama in 1974 what he thought it meant, and he said that as a child he was called Hla-mo-don-drup, an unusual name for a male child because it means \"Goddess Siddhartha\". \"Ma,\" a feminine ending in Tibetan, referred to that name. The above is a record of what I have heard and the little that I actually experienced in the search for the fourteenth Dalai Lama. Those interested in more information can consult two reliable sources: one, His Holiness the Dalai Lama's memoirs, My Land and My People, and the other, a book by Sonam Wangdu, a member of the search party led by Ge-tsang Rin­bo-chay, entitled The Discovery of the 14th Dalai Lama.132"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Dalai Lama 's Commentary on the Kiila chakra Initiation Rite: Stage of Generation"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Note This is a commentary by His Holiness the Dalai Lama on Kay-drop's Mandala Rite of the Glorious Kalachakra: lllumi­nation of the Thought (dpal dus kyi 'hor lo'i dkyil chog dgongs pa rab gsa/).

The differentiation between these two vehicles is by way of vastness of thought, that is, of motivation; due to it there is a difference also in path, or method; due to that there is, in turn, a difference in the fruit that is attained. This is how the two vehicles are distinguished. Concerning the Great Vehicle or Vehicle of Bodhisattvas itself, its sub-divisions- the Perfection Vehicle and the Mantra Vehicle - both require the motivational attitude of altruism and the practice of the six perfections, and both lead to the attainment of the fruit, which is unsurpassed enlightenment.

From between these two vehicles, what is being explained here is the Mantra Vehicle. With regard to mantra, according to the Vajrapaizjara Tantra, an explanatory tantra, there are four sets of tantras, although other texts speak of various divisions of the tantras into six sets, five sets, and so forth. When four are described, they are Action, Performance, Yoga and Highest Yoga Tantra. Among the four tantra sets, Action Tantra is so called because in the practice of yoga there is more emphasis, relative to the other tantra sets, on external activities of ritual bathing and main­taining cleanliness even though internal meditative stabiliza­tion is indeed cultivated. Performance Tantra is so called because of there being equal performance of external activi­ties and internal yoga. Yoga Tantra is so called because between external activities and internal yoga, the latter is principally emphasized. Highest Yoga Tantra [literally, Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra) is so called in that since it exceeds even Yoga Tantra in terms of principally emphasizing internal yoga, there is nothing superior to it. What is being explained here in this initiation is a text of Highest Yoga Tantra . In general, all the tantra systems have as their basis the attitude of altruistic mind generation and the deeds of the six perfections, which are described in the Perfection Vehicle. The distinctive feature of the Secret Mantra Vehicle comes in terms of additional techniques for quickly developing the meditative stabilization that is a union of calm abiding and special insight - one-pointed meditative stabilization realiz­ing emptiness. This mainly is achieved through deity yoga. From one point of view, tantra is more powerful than s�tra in terms of collecting merit in that yoga is sustained within visualizing one's body as divine. From another point of view, there also is a difference between the Perfection and Mantra Vehicles in terms of the subject, or substratum, the selfless­ness of which one is realizing in meditation. For, here in Mantra, one realizes the emptiness not of a gross phenome­non such as an ordinary body but rather of a subtle phenome-"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Background 163 non that is appearing to one's internal mind- a 'divine body. This mode of procedure of the path in which there is a yoga of non-duality of the profound and the manifest - the manifest being imaginative observation of a circle, or mandala, of deities and the profound being the wisdom realizing such­ness- is the general path in the three lower tantras- Action, Performance, and Yoga Tantras. Highest Yoga Tantra, in addition to all these features of the Perfection Vehicle and the three lower tantras, has special techniques for concentrated focusing on important points of the body, through which more subtle levels of mind are mani­fested and transformed into entities of the path. The uncom­mon profound distinction of all types of Highest Yoga Tantra texts- the distinctive feature in terms of which the uncommon potency of the Highest Yoga Tantra path is developed- is in the explanation of practices for generating the fundamental innate mind of clear light as an entity of the path. As techniques for manifesting the fundamental innate mind of clear light, some Highest Yoga Tantra texts speak of concentrated focusing on the winds for internal currents] of the body; some put emphasis on the four joys; and others speak of merely sustaining non-conceptual meditation. The Guhyasamaja Ta ntra, for instance, speaks mainly of putting concentrated focusing on the winds; the Chakrasarm.1ara Tantra and the Hevajra Tantra speak mainly of the four joys; and the tech nique of manifesting the clear light by way of non-con­ceptual meditation is mainly found in the great completeness (rdzogs chen) of the Nying-ma Order and the great seal (phyag rgya chen po, mahlmwdra) tradition of the Ga-gyu-ba Order. All of these are modes of practice described in valid and reliable source-texts within Highest Yoga Tantra. To become fully enlightened as a Buddha, it is necessary to practice Mantra and, within Mantra, Highest Yoga Mantra; otherwise, it is not possible to attain Buddha hood. The reason for this is that to actualize the effect state of the two bodies of a Buddha- Form Body and Truth Body- it is necessary medita­tively to cultivate a path that accords in aspect with those two bodies. Even in the Perfection Vehicle, it is necessary to"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"164 The Kiilachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary achieve a cause that is concordant with the effect. The main point is that in order to attain the Form Body of a Buddha it is necessary to have a substantial cause of similar type for a Form Body; also, for the Truth Body it is necessary to have a sub­stantial cause of similar type. Since this is the case, our coarse body, which is a fruition [of past karma], cannot serve as a substantial cause of similar type for a Buddha's Form Body. Also, the mentally imagined divine body that appears to a yogi practicing Yoga Tantra, Performance Tantra, or Action Tantra cannot serve as a substantial cause of similar type for a Buddha's Form Body, nor can even an actual body achieved, for instance, through the practice of Yoga Tantra. What can serve as such a substantial cause of a Form Body? A Buddha's body is one undifferentiable entity with that Buddha's mind; the form [or body! that is of one undifferenti­able entity with a Buddha's subtle mind cannot be a coarse form. The Form Body that is of one undifferentiable entity with a Buddha's subtle mind is itself a very subtle entity, and thus as its substantial cause of similar type a body that has a very subtle nature must be achieved at the time of the path. In Highest Yoga Tantra, this is achieved (1) in the Guhyasamiija system by way of an illusory body, (2) in the Kiilachakra system by way of empty form, or (3) in mother tantras by way of a rainbow body of light. Without such a mode of achieving a subtle body at the time of the path, a Buddha's Form Body cannot be achieved. Hence, a mode of achieving even the substantial cause of a Buddha's Form Body is not set forth in the three lower tantras or in the Perfection Vehicle, and a mode of achieving the uncommon substantial cause of a Buddha's mind is also not set forth in the three lower tantras or in the Perfection Vehicle. The reason for specifying \"uncommon substantial cause\" for the latter is that a common substantial cause of a Buddha's mind, a coarse wisdom consciousness realizing emptiness, is set forth in the three lower tantras and in the Perfection Vehicle. Thus, it can be said that they have a mere cause of a Buddha's omniscient consciousness; however, the uncommon substantial cause must be the mind of clear light, and the three lower tantras and the Perfection Vehicle do not set forth a"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Background 165 means of achieving the fundamental innate mind of clear light. Therefore, without depending in general on Mantra and in particular on Highest Yoga Mantra, Buddhahood cannot be attained. Similarly, the nirvana that is the extinguishment forever of all adventitious defilements in the sphere of reality through the power of their antidotes is the Buddhist interpre­tation of liberation, of peace, and those defilements must be extinguished in the sphere of reality only through the tech­nique of ascertaining empti ness and meditating on it. There­fore, the liberation explained in Buddhist texts can be attained only through a Buddhist pa th. Moreover, among the Buddhist systems, the actual Buddhist liberation can be attained only through relying on the view as explained in the Consequence School. As Nagarjuna's Fundamental Text Called \"Wisdom\" (dbu rna rtsa ba'l tshlg /e'ur byas pas shes rab bya ba, prajnimiimamula­madhyamakakiirlkii, XVIII.Sa) says, \"Through extinguishing [contaminated] actions and afflictions, there is liberation.\" Through meditating on the reality of the emptiness of inherent existence, actualizing it, and again and again familiarizing with the meaning of reality that has been directly perceived, the adventitious defilements are extinguished forever in the sphere of reality. That sphere of reality - into which the adventitious defilements are extinguished forever - is itself liberation, nirvana. This can be achieved only by one who has perceived the meaning of the reality of the emptiness of in­herent existence. Even within Buddhist schools, those of the Great Exposition School, the Sutra School, the Mind Only School, or the Autonomv School cannot actualize this. In this light, it is said that a Foe .Des trover as explained in the systems of manifest knowledge (chos mngon pa, abhldharma) is not a Foe Destroyer. Therefore, just as to attain Buddhahood Highest Yoga Tantra is needed, so to attain liberation from cyclic existence the view of the Consequence School is needed. Highest Yoga Tantra itself is divided into father and mother tantras, and certain scholars also speak of non-dual tantras, citing the Kalachakra Tantra as an illustration. However, ac­cording to others who do not assert non-dual tantras that are"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"166 The Kiilachakra Ta ntra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary not included among father and mother tantras, the Kiilachakra Tantra is a mother tantra, the reason for this being as follows. The Kiilachakra Tantra has as its main object of discussion the six branched yoga [individual withdrawal, concentration, stopping vitality, retention, subsequent mindfulness, and meditative stabilization], among which the immutable bliss of the sixth branch, meditative stabilization, is the final object of achievement. Because the Kiilachakra Tantra emphasizes just this immutable bliss, it is called a mother tantra. Again, the reason why the first group calls the Kiilachakra Tantra a non-dual tantra is that they identify as its main object of discourse the state of union -a combination of empty form and immutable great bliss, immutable great bliss being in­duced by way of an empty form of the Great Seal. This state of union, or non-dual body and mind, is described in a very clear way in the Kiilachakra Tantra, unlike its hidden descrip­tion in the Guhyasamiija Ta ntra, and thus they say that the Kiilachakra Tantra is a non-dual tantra. The Kiilachakra Tantra has many such unique profound distinctive features. In general, Highest Yoga Tantras speak of a stage of generation and a stage of completion, of which the latter is primary. Within the stage of completion itself, there are two levels- one involved with withdrawing the winds or inner energies into the central channel and the other occurring in dependence upon having accomplished that withdrawal. In the Kalachakra system, the initial branches of the six branched yoga are mostly means of withdrawing the winds inside the central channel, and thus, given this emphasis on the phase of withdrawing the winds, the Kiilachakra Tantra provides profound techniques for the preliminary levels. Moreover, the Kiilachakra Tantra has a special connection with a country, Shambala, as its general religion and thus from this viewpoint also is unique. For, other Highest Yoga Tantras have their origin in relation to individual persons or adepts, as was the case with the Guhyasamiija Ta ntra and the King Indrabhuti. The Kiilachakra Ta ntra, however, has been intimately connected with the country of Shambala -its ninety-six districts, its kings, and retinue. Still, if you lay out a map and search for Shambala, it is not findable; rather, it"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Background 167 seems to be a pure land which, except for those whose karma and merit have ripened, cannot be immediately seen or visited.

Perhaps, if, in the future, spacecrafts improve to the point where they can proceed faster than light, it might be possible to arrive there, but the tickets might be expensive! In fact, we can consider the tickets to be meritorious actions, and thus it takes someone rich in merit to arrive there. PREPARATION FOR INITIATION Although conferral of blessings does not necessarily require a mandala, an initiation must be conferred in dependence upon a mandala. The Kalachakra initiation for the stage of genera­tion must be given in connection with a mandala of colored particles, and since this is the case, the area where the man­dala is to be constructed must initially be made serviceable. To do this, the area first is analyzed; then, if it is suitable, it is set off, cleansed, and taken over. Such steps are included in the rite of taking over the area, after which come the stages of preparation. During the preparation, vases are needed; thus, there is a preparation or enhancement of the vases. Similarly, since there are the mandalas of the residence and the resident dei­ties, a preparation or enhancement of the deities is done. After that, there is a preparation or enhancement of the stud­ents, making the continuums of the students fit to be vessels for the conferral of initiation. All of these constitute the topics of the stages of preparation. In practice, the enhancement of the students is, for convenience, put just before the actual conferral of initiation.

Most of you know the importance of kindness - the special kind of altruism, called bodhichitta in Sanskrit- and of wisdom, called prajnii. These two mental developments are the ground or foundation without which we cannot perform any tantric practice. Therefore, both myself as well as you listeners must develop at least some experience of these two minds. With regard to wisdom, things appear as if independently existent but in reality do not exist that way; we should under­stand that things do not exist in accordance with their solid mode of appearance. Then, with regard to altruism, human society could not survive, could not exist, without kindness. If we think properly, the entire human society is based on kindness; all human relations are essentially centered in kindness. In the field of religious practice, the feeling of kind­ness is the key point. Also, it is very important to realize the nature of suffering. As long as we have this type of physical body under the influence of contaminated actions (las, karma) and afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, klesha), something will be wrong-this will be wrong or that will be wrong. It is important to realize that the phenomena of cyclic existence have a nature of suffer­ing. Another important realization is that of impermanence. Things are always changing. You should understand that this"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Motivation and Internat Initiation 171 is their nature. With these thoughts in mind, we will proceed with the initiation. The most important factor is good motivation. We have already attained a good, useful human body; we have an opportunity to accomplish something of great impact, You should think that you will do something meaningful wj.th this human body already attained. To do something meaningful with it, you should not be selfish but should generate as much as possible an altruistic attitude. Altruism is most important. Now, the next question is how to serve other people, how to · help other beings - not just humans but all sentient beings. According to Buddhist teaching, events depend upon our own karmic force; for the wanted happiness to occur and the unwanted suffering not to occur, persons need an unmistaken mode of accumulating karma. Therefore, helping others is mainly in terms of explaining to others what is to be adopted in practice and what is to be discarded from our behaviour. As a sutra says: The Subduer [Buddhas] neither wash ill-deeds away with water, Nor remove beings' sufferings with their hands, Nor transfer their realizations to others. Beings are released through the teachings of the truth, the final reality. Furthermore, to be able to teach unmistakenly what is to be adopted in practice and what is to be discarded, these topics cannot be obscure to oneself. As Dharmakirti's Commentary on (Digniiga's) \"Compendium ofValidCognition\"(tshadma mam 'grel, pramiirJavarttika) says:3 In order to overcome suffering [in others) The merciful manifestly engage in methods. When the causes of what arise from those methods are obscure [to oneself), It is difficult to explain them [to others). If what is to be taught is beyond your ken, you cannot pos­sibly teach it. All possible techniques of practice must be known."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"172 .The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary In addition, you need to know, exactly as they are, the various dispositions and interests of those whom you would teach. If you do not know their dispositions and interests, even though your attitude is good, it is nonetheless possible to do harm due to the teaching's not being appropriate. There­fore, as long as your mind is polluted by the obstructions to omniscience such that you are prevented from knowing all objects of knowledge, you cannot fully bring about others' welfare. , This' being the case, Bodhisattvas consider their real enemy to be the\" obstructions to omniscience. If Bodhisattvas had a choice either to get rid of the afflictive obstructions prevent­ing liberation from cyclic existence or to get rid of the obstruc­tions to omniscience, they would choose the latter. However, since the fact is that the obstructions to omniscience are pre-, dispositions left by the afflictive obstructions, without re­moving that which deposits these predispositions there is no - way to remove the predispositions; thus, it is necessary to remove first the afflictive obstructions and then the obstruc­tions to omniscience. Hence, to bring about others' welfare, it is necessary to remove entirely both obstructions - to libera­tion and to omniscience. That level, or ground, at which the afflictive emotions as well as their predispositions have been removed forever is called Buddhahood, a state endowed with the exalted wisdom knowing all aspects of objects of know­ledge. The purpose is to bring about sentient beings' welfare; the means to accomplish this is your own Buddhahood. This sequence of thought is how you come to determine that you must attain Buddhahood for the sake of others. The attitude generated is called bodhichitta, the altruistic intention to become enlightened, and must be cultivated continually, at least in a fabricated way. You should think, \"I will rely upon the path of unified Siitra and Mantra and, within that, on Highest Yoga Tantra- specifically the path of the Kalachakra Tantra -as a technique for easily achieving such Buddhahood.

This describes the mistaken motivation of seeking the happi­ness of this life, such as entering a mandala in order to prevent disease or to achieve success in a certain venture. A request for initiation with this motivation is mistaken. Those wishing for merit are other than them. There are those who, seeking a future lifetime of high status within cyclic existence, want merit and therefore seek to enter a mandala. This, too, is mistaken. The line also can be inter­preted as referring to those who, seeking liberation from cyclic existence for themselves, want merit and therefore enter a mandala; this also is mistaken. Others seek the welfare of others in the world. The intelligent should enter the mandala With many acts of faith Seeking the aim of what transcends the world. Those altruistic persons who have the faith seeking that which transcends the world, the state of the Three Buddha Bodies, are fit to enter a mandala and should be allowed to do so.

At this time consider in meditation that the lama and the principal deity of the mandala are not different. I am not saying that you should consider me to be God. When doing Mantra practice, one meditates on oneself as a deity and on one's lama also as a deity. Identify well the meaning of those words so that the students generate awareness of the need to enter the mandala with a thought seeking the non-abiding nir­vana [not abiding in the extremes of either cyclic exis­tence or solitary peace] - that which transcends the world- the best of the three motivations.

Do not just withdraw all appearances; also become mindful of the emptiness of inherent existence of all appearing and occurring objects of knowledge, as illustrated by yourself. The altruistic intention to become enlightened, which was earlier cultivated, still remains, and now, in addition, you are think­ing, \"All phenomena, as illustrated by myself, are empty of inherent existence.\" This mind itself serves as the \"substance\" of your appearance as Kalachakra with one face and two arms. The mind, impelled by compassion and realizing the empti­ness of inherent existence, transforms into a hum that itself transforms into a vajra that in tum transforms i�to a Kala­chakra, not with all the faces and arms of the principal deity of the mandala but with just one face and two arms. From hum and a vajra they are generated as Kala­chakras with one face and two hands. Then, light rays at the heart of the lama as Kalachakra draw in all the Ones Gone Thus- Buddhas- who have the nature of the exalted wisdom of non-dual bliss and emptiness. They enter the lama's mouth, dissolve into light at the heart of the lama, called the mind of enlightenment; that descends into the Mother's womb, conferring initiation on the students who are visualizing themselves as Kalachakras in the Mother's womb. The students, in addition to their wisdom realizing emptiness appearing as Kalachakra, also are experiencing the special exalted wisdom of great bliss. Think that such bliss is gene­rated through the internal initiation. The light from the seed syllable at my heart invites in all Ones Gone Thus; they enter my mouth, and at my heart the fire of attraction [i.e., their mutual joy in each other ] melts [their bodies into light called] the mind of enlightenment, which emerges through the vajra path.

They emerge from the Mother's lotus and are set on their individual places. There are three levels of doors within the mandala, corres­ponding to the three levels rejated with exalted body, speech, and mind. At this point, you are outside the outermost set of doors at the level of the exalted body mandala. Earlier it was explained that prior to initiation you are not allowed to medi­tate on yourself as a deity, but now that you have received the internal initiation, the process of meditating on yourself as a deity has begun. The procedure of this imaginative meditation accords with the type of social structure in earlier India so that it easily could appear to their minds. It has connection with the later initiation of a vajra master, in which the student becomes like a representative or royal replacement of the lama.

Once this is the nature of cyclic existence, it is something that we do not want. The student is asking the lama as Kalachakra, the teacher of the means of release from such fright, to pay heed to himself or herself. The means, as explained earlier, is to purify utterly the two obstructions - those to liberation and to omniscience - in dependence upon the Vajra Vehicle, the path of Secret Mantra. You are saying that you want this. Since, for that, it is neces­sary to keep properly the pledges and vows, you are also asking the lama to bestow the pledges and vows.

Through the power of Vajra Mantra The Buddhas arising in the three times-Those having the vajras of exalted body, speech, and mind-Thoroughly gain the peerless exalted wisdom. Those with the vajras of exalted body, speech, and mind are Buddhas since the level of undifferentiable body, speech, and mind is Buddha hood. Thus, the Buddhas of the past, present, and future having an essence of undifferentiable body, speech, and mind have gained, gain, and will gain the thoroughly pure, peerless, exalted wisdom of Buddhahood in depend­ence upon the power of the path of Secret Mantra. In brief, the Buddhas of all times- those with an essence of exalted vajra body, speech, and mind- gain, in dependence upon the path of Secret Mantra, an exalted wisdom of funda­mental innate clear light, free from all obstructions, the exalted wisdom of the final sphere of reality possessing the two purities - natural purity and purity from adventitious defilements. Since this wisdom has no equal among the exalted wisdom of those still learning, it is \"peerless\". Through the power of Secret Mantra, they have gained, gain, and will gain such an omniscient Wisdom Truth Body of a Buddha. Buddhahood - the undifferentiability of exalted body, speech, and mind - is attained in dependence upon the path of Mantra. How is this done? Our present coarse consciou!;­nesses are not suitable to be the substantial cause of a Bud­dha's omniscient consciousness. That which can serve as such a cause is the most subtle fundamental innate mind of clear light. Nothing else can serve as the direct substantial cause of an omniscient consciousness. Since this is the case, the most"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"180 The Ka/achakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary subtle fundamental innate mind of clear light must be gener­ated as an entity of the path, as an entity of virtue. This can only be done through a technique of Highest Yoga Mantra in which concentrated emphasis is put on focal points of the body. Without such a technique, there is no way to generate the fundamental innate mind of clear light as an entity of the path, and the three lower tantra sets-Action, Performance, and Yoga Tantras- as well as the Perfection Vehicle do not identify the fundamental innate mind of clear light and do not speak of techniques for generating it into an entity of the path. They only speak of accumulating the collections of merit and exalted wisdom in the context of coarser levels of conscious­ness. As long as one cannot generate the subtlest level of con­sciousness as an entity of the path, the omniscience of a Buddha cannot be achieved. Furthermore, one is seeking such omniscience mainly for the sake of other sentient beings. As Maitreya's Ornament For Clear Realization (mngon rtogs rg yan, abhisamayiila�iira) says:5 \"[Altruistic] mind generation is the wish for complete perfect enlightenment for the sake of others.\" Thus the object of intent of one seeking the omni­science of Buddhahood is the welfare of other beings. Now, between a Buddha's Wisdom Truth Body and Form Bodies, it is Form Bodies that actually appear to trainees and thereby bring about their welfare; there is no way for the Wisdom Truth Body to help others through actually appearing to them. Hence, what is mainly being sought are the Form Bodies of a Buddha. The substantial cause of such Form Bodies cannot be our present body composed of flesh, blood, bone, and so forth. The Perfection Vehicle speaks of achieving a mental body that arises in dependence upon factors called the level of the pre­dispositions of ignorance and uncontaminated karma and that has similitudes of a Buddha's major and minor marks. The Perfection Vehicle says that this special mental body serves as the substantial cause of a Buddha's Form Bodies, but when examined closely, the \"level of predispositions of ignor­ance\" refers to the obstructions to omniscience, and thus this mental body is achieved from impure causes. Therefore, being"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Supplication and Faith 181 itself produced from impure causes, it cannot serve as the substantial cause of a Form Body that is of the same entity as a Buddha's omniscient consciousness. The substantial cause of a Buddha's Form Body that is of the same entity as an omniscient consciousness must be achieved in an uncommon way in dependence upon Highest Yoga Mantra. In the Kalachakra Tantra this is a great seal empty form; in the Guhyasamaja Tantra, an illusory body; or, in another way, it is a rainbow body. Without such a technique, there is no way that our coarse body can serve as the substan­tial cause of a Buddha's Form Bodies. Our own coarse body, speech, and mind are very different from each other; still, even now we have subtle body, speech, and mind that are undifferentiable. Highest Yoga Mantra, with great emphasis, speaks of taking the subtle body, speech, and mind - that in our ordinary state are undifferentiable in terms of their entity and that occur together with defilement­as the basis of practice and transforming these into the exalted body, speech, and mind of the effect stage, Buddhahood. Without the path of Highest Yoga Mantra, there is no way to manifest clearly our subtle body, speech, and mind such that they can perform activities. For instance, to generate our present, subtle mind which has the capacity to comprehend objects such that it manifestly performs the function of com­prehending objects, the practice of Highest Yoga Mantra is needed, and similarly to develop fully the capacity of our present subtle body- that is to say, our very subtle winds or inner energies - to appear in whatever form one wants, the path of Highest Yoga Mantra is required. To use well the very subtle wind and mind, it is necessary to stop coarse levels of wind and mind. \"Wind\" is most likely a special type of energy. In this subtle presentation, mind and wind are one undifferentiable entity; mind, or consciousness, is so named from the viewpoint of knowing objects, and wind, or energy, is so named from the viewpoint of engaging or moving toward objects. In the Kalachakra system, there are descriptions of ten or twelve types of winds - the greater number being due to sub-dividing the downward-voiding wind into three types. The wind called dhanamjaya (nor las"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"182 The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary rgyal) causes the body to change from one moment to the next and thus is said to be present even in a corpse. The coarser levels of wind and mind are forcibly stopped whereby the subtle levels can be used. For stopping the coarser winds and minds, there are no operations or drugs; it is to be done through the power of meditative stabilization or through special physical exercises. Further, it is said that if one is having difficulty in accomplishing this, the channel at the wheel of enjoyment in the throat can be pressed such that the clear light manifests; however, there is the danger that instead of merely manifesting the clear light, one will die! Thus, some of the techniques are very dangerous; similarly, if wind yoga is not cultivated well, there is danger of illnesses. Even for usual meditators, if wind or breath yoga is not done well, you can develop headaches or eye pain. Since this is the case, it is important to train gradually under the guidance of an experi­enced, qualified teacher. By way of using such techniques of Highest Yoga Mantra, the coarser levels of wind can be restrained and stopped- not just stopped by the force of karma as at the time of death, but through the power of yoga, through the power of techniques. When coarse wind and mind become inactive, the subtler wind and mind become active. Since this cessation of coarse levels is not by the power of karma but through the power of their being deliberately restrained in dependence upon a new technique, then when a subtler consciousness manifests, it is not unclear but clear, aware. A prime technique is kundalini, utilizing of the refined essence of the body. To do this, it is necessary to ignite the inner heat called the Fierce Female (gtum mo, charJqali). For this, a consort- a Great Seal Woman (phyag rgya ma, mahamudra) -is used. The final purpose is to generat�, as an entity of the path, the very subtle mind of clear light which can serve as the substan­tial cause of an omniscient consciousness, an exalted knower of all aspects. This is why the technique of forcibly eliminat­ing the coarser levels of wind and mind is taught, for which one needs to gain control over the spreading out and gather­ing in of the red and white constituents, for which, in turn, the technique of using a consort is taught."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Supplicati011 and Faith 183 In brief, the direct substantial cause for achieving a Wisdom Truth Body and the direct substantial cause for achieving a Form Body can be achieved only in dependence upon Secret Mantra .

Even in countries of great material progress there is much pain; in countries of little material development there are many varieties of pain. Then, in old age there is the suffering of more illnesses and, as death approaches, the suffering of death. After death, there again is the suffering of definitely having to wander in any of the six transmigrations. That we undergo such suffering is not without causes and conditions. What causes it? All these transmigrating beings, deluded by illu-sion, grasp suffering from suffering. What actually is suffering is not understood to be suffering but, out of obscuration, is mis-identified as happiness and clung to. Similarly, what is not an inherently existent self appears to be an inherently existent self and is, out of obscura­tion, conceived to be so. Through this ignorance misconceiv­ing the nature of persons and of other phenomena, actions are done through which good and bad karma that propels life­times in cyclic existence is accumulated, and the round of suffering continues. Similarly, although one wants happi­ness, out of ignorance one does not know how to achieve it, and even though one does not want suffering, due to being obscured with respect to the causes of suffering one engages, as if intentionally, in achieving the very causes of suffering. In this way, what are to be adopted and to be discarded are reversed, one suffering leading to another. The eyes of those attending a magical show are affected by the magician's mantra, and, due to this obscuration, generate attachment when they see illusory horses, elephants, and so forth that appear. In a similar way, due to the obscuration of the conception of inherent existence, beings exaggerate the status of good and bad phenomena and are thereby led into desire and hatred and thereby into accumulating actions (las, karma).

Still, the mere existence of such a method does not bring about release from suffering; the method must be generated in your continuum- it must be implemented through effort. At this juncture, we have a good opportunity which therefore must not be wasted. Though some become humans in cyclic existence, few have a spiritual attitude. Fewer, through the force of the virtue of being attracted to Buddha, enter into the prime vehicle. Still fewer engage their entire intelligence in culti­vating the glorious Vajra Vehicle. Even more, those wishing Buddhahood who enter into the states of the supreme bliss are, alas, extremely rare. [300] Within cyclic existence, those who have a human life-support are few since a life of high status as a human is achieved only from having created good causes. From among those few, those who have encountered a spiritual system and whose minds have turned toward it are even fewer. Again, among them, those who have entered into the Great Vehicle teaching and are seeking the enlightenment of a Buddha are even fewer. Among them, those who have faithful interest in the Secret Mantra Vehicle are even more rare; such beings hardly occur. Then, those who not.only have faithful interest in the Secret Mantra Vehicle but who practice its path properly to achieve Buddhahood are even more rare. Hence, at this point we have gained a human body, en­countered Buddha's teaching and, within it, the Great Vehicle teaching, and furthermore have faithful interest in the Secret Mantra Vehicle.

Since you vajra students are proceeding on this path, you will, in not long, become \"self-arisen beings of great fortune\" in that when the Wisdom Truth Body is actualized, the Form Body is simultaneously actualized without depending on any other conditions or agents, independently. In this sense, the Form Body is called \"self-arisen\". Similarly, the Truth Body is also called \"self-arisen\" in the sense that the emptiness that is the object of the Wisdom Truth Body has abided beginning­lessly whether the Ones Gone Thus arise or not and thus the suchness of phenomena remains of its own accord. Further­more, the mind of clear light that remains of one undifferenti­able entity with that suchness - the exalted wisdom of the fundamental innate mind of clear light - is beginningless in terms of its entity. The undifferentiable entity of the object­suchness -and the subject - the fundamental innate mind of clear light - is the basis of emanation or creator of all Buddhas.

In your thought, do not allow your mind to be polluted by other conceptions; just be mindful of Kalachakra, and within that, think, as much as you can, of the altruistic intention to become enlightened and the view of emptiness. If you cannot do that, first cultivate faith and compassion, and look straight­forwardly at mind.itself. If you usually sleep too heavily, it will lighten your sleep to use a point of imagination higher up in the body. Again, if you sleep too lightly, using a point of imagination lower in the body will make your sleep more heavy. Engage in techniques so that you fall asleep within a vir­tuous attitude. Then, it is explained that from among the four periods of the night, there is a possibility of analyzing the dreams around dawn·in the fourth period. In general, around us there are many mysteries, many facts, that are not seen with the eye. Because we have a coarse physical body, when it is very active, it is difficult to have direct contact with these mysteries, but when we become semi-conscious - when our consciousness becomes more subtle-there is a diminishment of the coarse consciousnesses that depend on the coarse phy­sical body, and it is easier to make connection with such mysteries. This is why various portents of future events and so forth appear during dreams. If you have deeper meditation, you can know these things through certain meditative experiences, but for ordinary people the only alternative is through dreams. I will give you an oral transmission for a mantra to be repeated tonight. Give the six syllables [o� ah hu� ho� ham k�hah I for the sake of repetition.

In general, if, from among the four constituents of earth, water, fire, and wind, the earth consti­tuent is particularly thick in the body, there are cases of not having clear dreams. If a dream did occur, experiencing fright or mental discomfort is considered to be slightly negative. Also, even though finding many flowers in a dream brings pleasure, if the flowers are red, then it is not good; however, there are exceptions, such as when performing rites to achieve certain activities. Also, even though you may have come upon a temple, if it was not brilliant but decayed, dirty, or dilapi­dated or, even though you may have come upon an image, if it was not magnificent bu t covered with dust, these are bad. On the other hand, dreams of things that please the mind are better. Still, it is said that even if you had a good dream, you should not develop pleasure in it that involves attach­ment. Similarly, even if you had a bad dream, you should not be too concerned about it. If you had no dreams, it is neutral. There are ways of overcoming bad dreams; the main tech­nique is to meditate on emptiness, but also, in situations of fright and discomfort, it is important to take specific cogni­zance of the object - the person or being who is the source of"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"208 The Kiilachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary the fright or displeasure-and then cultivate compassion and love. This is the best method of overcoming the problem. The being who is trying to harm you is like yourself in wanting happiness and not wanting suffering. Thus, the best protec­tion is to think, \"Just as I want happiness, so this being wants happiness. May this being attain happiness, may this being come to possess happiness!\" According to my own experience, reciting mantra and doing visualizations do not have much effect during a nightmare, but as a last resort, remembering compassion and altruism toward that object brings immediate peace. The best protec­tion is to protect ourselves - this means to protect ourselves from anger, hatred, and fear by remaining always with the courage and determination of compassion. Now as an additional means to overcome bad dreams, I will scatter water, simultaneously reciting the mantra om iih hun:z ho� han:z k�ha�. During this, visualize that all bad effects are cast away by the force of the mantra and the wisdom under­standing emptiness. STRUCTURE OF THE INITIATION For an initiation to occur, there are many things that the lama must perform and many that the student must do. What have I done? First I have cultivated self-generation as Kalachakra using the full mandala rite of exalted body, speech, and mind. Then, the vases were transformed [into deities who then reappeared as vases] after which I did generation of the deity, Kalachakra, in front. There are two varieties of generation or imagination of the deity in front - one with the deity as the same entity as oneself and the other with the deity as a differ­ent entity. This being the Kiilachakra Tantra, the Kalachakra as whom one is imagining oneself and the Kalachakra imagined in front are seen as different entities. Then, to refurbish vows that have been taken, one performs self-entry into the mandala; if the Dalai Lama had been stupid [and transgressed a vow], he would have restored the vows by performing the rite of self-entry into the mandala. Next are a supplication for the sake of the student and an expression of"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Structure 209 the power of truth. Then, there is a giving of food-offerings to obstructing spirits who might interrupt the initiation, and there is meditative cultivation of a wheel of protective deities. Those are what the lama must do. I now am maintaining conception of myself as the principal deity of the mandala, Kalachakra; after performing self-entry into the mandala, I have maintained the \"pride\" of being the principal deity. The students have to make obeisance, rinse their mouths, and then make mandala-offerings, these having just been done.

HISTORY OF THE KALACHAKRA TANTRA According to one interpretation, the Kiilachakra Tantra was first spoken by the Teacher, Shakyamuni Buddha, at the time of the full moon in the third month of the year after his having shown the manner of becoming completely and perfectly en­lightened. 20 According to another interpretation, Shakya­muni, having showed the manner of becoming completely and perfectly enlightened, turned the three wheels of doctrine, aad then one year beforc- his passing away set forth the Kala-"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"210 The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary chakra Tantra. About this, the root Kalachakra Tantra says: Just as the Teacher [set forth] the mode of the Perfection of Wisdom at Vulture Peak So at the shipa of Dhanyakataka ('bras spungs) he set forth all the modes of [this] Secret Mantra. A literal reading of this passage indicates that just as, for example, Shakyamuni set forth many styles of teachings such as the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras at many places- Vulture Peak and so forth - so at Dhanyakataka he turned a wheel of doctrine of Secret Mantra with the Ka/achakra Tantra as the principal tantra. In the country of Sharnbala, Shakyamuni Buddha set forth specifically this tantra for many trainees - both gods and humans, illustrated by King Suchandra (rgyal po zla ba bzang po). The Kalachakra Tantra itself has twelve thousand stanzas; King Suchandra composed a commentary sixty thousand stanzas in length. Occasional citations of the root tantra in Kulika Pu�qa­rika's Great Commentary on the \"Kalachaka Tantra\", the Stain­less Light (dri med 'od, vimalaprabhil) and in other commen­taries and the Brief Explication of Initiations (dbang mdor bstan, shekhoddesha) were translated into Tibetan, but the root tantra itself was not translated. Then, after seven religious kings, King Maii.jushrikirti ('jam dpal grags pa) allowed many trainees such as Siiryaratha (nyi ma'i shing rta) to enter the mandala and thereby to be ripened, blending all of these persons into one vajra lineage; hence from that point, the religious kings were given the title kulika (rigs /dan), \"one who bears the lineage\". It was indicated in the root tantra itself that in the future someone named \"Kirti\" would make a shorter version of the tantra, and, just so, Kulika Maii.jushrikirti con­densed the main points of the tantra into the present one of five chapters having over one thousand stanzas, called the Condensed Kalachakra Tantra. Since his doing this was pro­phesied in the root tantra itself, the Condensed Kiilachakra Tantra is accepted as an actual tantra. Later, Kulika Pu�qarika composed a commentary on the Condensed Kalachakra Tantra, called the Stainless Light, which"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Structure 211 is twelve thousand stanzas long. These two, the Condensed Kiilachakra Tantra and Stainless Light, were translated into Tibetan, and explanations of the Kiilachakra Tantra are based mainly on these two texts. Among commentaries by Tibetan scholars, the commentaries of annotations on the tantra itself and on Kulika Puf)darika's Stainless Light by the Sa-gya scholar Bu-dbn Rin-chen-drup (br1 stan rin chen grub, 1290-1364) are the best. Two translations of the tantra were made into Tibetan, one by the Translator Ra Oor-jay-drak-ba (rva lo tsii ba rdo rje grags pa) and one by the Translator Oro Shay-rap-drak ('bra /o tsii. ba shes rab grags). The main transmissions of explanation are from Ra and Oro, these being combined in Bu-dbn Rin-bo­chay. The oral transmission of the tantra that I have is this one, which was passed down from Bu-dbn Rin-bo-chay to the present to my kind root lama, Ling Rin-bo-chay. I received the transmission of the explanation of the tantra from Ser-gong Rin-bo-chay, who has two different transmissions of expla­nation. I am still a student of the Kiilachakra Ta ntra, an elder student perhaps. TOPICS OF THE TANTRA With respect to the subjects of the five chapters of the Conden­sed Kiila.chakra Tarrtra, first, what is Kalachakra- \"Wheel of Time\"? What is \"time\"? What is the \"wheel\"? \"Time\" refers to immutable bliss, and \"wheel\" to various empty forms. In the Kiilachakra Tantra , two types of emptiness are described ­aspected and unaspected. The unaspected emptiness is exact­ly the emptiness described in the treatises of the Middle Way School (dbrt mapa, miidhyamika)-the emptiness of inherent existence. The mind of clear light that takes this emptiness as its object probably is also called an unaspected emptiness. This is like, for example, the usage of the term \"concordant ultimate\" for a wisdom consciousness tha t realizes empti­ness.21 \"Aspected emptiness\", on the other hand, refers to empty forms. Hence, whereas the object of negation of unaspected emptiness is inherent existence, the object of negation of"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"212 The Kiilachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary aspected emptiness is material phenomena composed of par­ticles. Therefore, \"aspected emptiness\" refers to various forms, or physical objects, that are beyond materiality. On the basis of what are these various empty forms achiev­ed? They are achieved in terms of the mind. In the Kalachakra Tmztra, wind yoga is described, but there is not an emphasis on wind yoga as there is in the Guhyasamaja Ta ntra and the Heruka Tantra [also called the Chakrasamvara Tantra], for empty forms are not achieved by way of wind. Thus, taken together, the term \"Kalachakra\" refers to a union in one entity of immutable bliss and empty form. This explanation is primarily in terms of the effect stage of Buddha­hood, the time of the final object of attainment. Since, to actualize such an effect through paths of practice, it is neces­sary to have a basis in dependence upon which the paths are practiced, there come to be external, internal, and alternative Kalachakras. The external Kalachakra refers to all of the environment ­the mountains, fences, homes, planets, constellations of stars, solar systems, and so forth. The internal Kalachakra refers to the person's body having a nature of channels, winds, and drops of essential fluid. The alternative Kalachakra refers to the methods for purifying the impure factors of the external and internal Kalachakras - these being the bases of purifica­tion - and thereby bringing about transformation into a Kala­chakra of the effect state of Buddhahood. Again, within the alternative Kalachakra - the path - there are the divisions oi (1) the stage of completion, which brings the path to comple­tion and is comprised of the six-branched yoga; (2) the stage oi generation, which matures one for the practice of the stage of completion, and (3) the initiations authorizing one to listen to, think about, and meditate on such paths oi the stages of generation and completion. These three Kalachakras - external, internal, and alternative -are the subjects discussed in the five chapters oi the Collden­sed Kiilachakra Tantra. The iull meaning oi the external, in­ternal, and alternative Kalachakras is contained in the ten letters of the root mantra of Kalachakra, lzam kslzalz ma Ia va ra ya.

Also, there is an eleventh symbol, the nada Ia wiggly line rising from the dot on top]. The explanations of the formation of the mantra and of its meaning are complicated, but in brief, when these ten letters are associated with the external Kalachakra, they symbolize the four elements, Mt.

The vajra master who confers initiation in dependence upon such a mandala must, as is said in the Kalachakra Tantra, have attained initiation, be maintaining properly the pledges and vows, be skilled in the tantra and activities of the mandala, have done prior approximation [of the state of the deity) and thereupon received permission to confer initiation, and so forth. There are many such qualifications. We will say that I am just in the process of coming to have the minimum qualifi­cations. The students, also, should have faithful interest from the depths of their hearts in the altruistic intention to become enlightened and in the correct view of the emptiness of in­herent existence. Even if they do not have experience of these, they should have the thought - from the depths of their being, \"These are really needed; these are really good.\" In addition, the students must have faithful interest in Mantra. The place where initiation is to be conferred is this fully qualified area in Wisconsin - isolated, clean, and quiet. And if you are hungry, you can go over to the corn field and eat some corn! The time is preferably at the full moon of the third month of the Kalachakra system (thus to know this system well, it is necessary to know astrology- the houses, constellations, and so forth); otherwise, it can be the full moon period of any of the twelve months. Tomorrow is the full moon of the fifth month. Usually, in Hla-sa the fifteenth day of the fifth month is a day of celebration of the general prosperity of the world. Although we did not plan it this way, it is a happy coincidence."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"216 The Kiilachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary The initiations being conferred are those ripening the con­tinuum for the stage of generation - the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood.

When done properly, the initiations are given in estimation of what is needed at the particular time, whereas when treated just as a public cere­mony they are all given at one time.

All of these feats arise in dependence upon training in the paths of the two stages - the stage of generation and the stage of completion. To achieve any of these, your mental continuum first has to be ripened through initiation; then, it is necessary to train in the stage of generation. To achieve the supreme feat, it is also necessary to train in the stage of completion. Thus, all of these arise in dependence upon the condition of having received initiation; hence, initiation is, so to speak, the source of all feats.

Next, there is a supplication, the words of which were ex­plained yesterday. The essence of the meaning is that you are requesting the deity to let you enter the mandala and to bestow the pledges and vows for progressing to the levels of liberation and omniscience. Then, make supplication three times with: The sole liberator from the ocean of cyclic existence, Which is frightful with sea monsters and so forth­The crocodiles of birth, aging, and death-Is you, 0 Great Joyous Teacher of mine. 0 great protector, I am seeking The firm mode of great enlightenment.

When practicing Mantra in a mandala, it is necessary to have clear appearance of yourself as a deity and the pride [or con­ception] of yourself as a deity. The chief of these two is the pride of being a deity for which it is necessary to have clear appearance of yourself as a deity. In the process of doing so, you are not refuting the ordinary appearances seen by your eyes. Rather, you are not allowing ordinary phenomena to appear to the mental consciousness and, instead, are causing divine appearances to shine forth. When, by stopping ordin­ary appearances for the mental consciousness and developing clear appearance of yourself as a deity, such clear appearance becomes steady, the appearance of ordinary mental and phy­sical aggregates, ordinary constituents, and ordinary senses and sense fields ceases. Instead, divine mental and physical"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"220 The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary aggregates, divine constituents, and divine senses and sense fields appear. At this point, an awareness thinking of oneself, \"1\", as designated in dependence on such pure mental and physical aggregates, pure constituents, and pure senses and sense fields dawns. In this way, these Mantra practices, in addition to the practice of method and wisdom in the Perfec­tion Vehicle, bring together many techniques for quick development. In order to promote mindfulness of the clear appearance of yourself as a deity and pride in yourself as a deity, you put on various articles of apparel and so forth of a deity.

Such a Fortunate One is one whose predispositions for the Bodhisattva path have been activated, one whose Bodhisattva lineage has been manifested. Still, even if the Bodhisattva lineage has not been manifested in the sense of your having actually generated great compassion, you are in the process of activating that lineage of the Great Vehicle. With the second answer, \"Great bliss,\" you are indicating that ·within the Great Vehicle, your interest is in Secret Mantra. When I ask the questions and you answer, if you answer perfunctorily without any feeling, it will be no more than play; instead, you need to generate feeling in your mind and then answer from that feeling. [The lama asks about the student's lineage and interest:) 0, who are you? What do you want? To tfie lama's question the student answers: A Fortunate One am I. Great bliss. Through [the answer] the [student's Great Vehicle) lineage and interest [in Secret Mantra) are known. Now the students make a supplication in three stanzas, the first two being from Naropa's commentary [on the Brief Expli­cation of Initiations] and the third being from Kulika Pun<?a­rika's Great Commentary. Then, [the student] makes supplication: I go for refuge to the feet of you, Remover of the frights of cyclic existence, Unsullied by the faults of cyclic existence, Essence of all excellences. In this context of Secret Mantra, how are the frights of cyclic existence removed? In the Low Vehicle, a Hearer who engages in practices devoid of desire removes the frights of cyclic existence through viewing the attributes of the Desire Realm one-pointedly as faulty and thereby turning away from them. In Mantra, however, that which removes the frights of cyclic"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"224 The Kiilachakra Ta ntra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary existence is a practice using the attributes of the Desire Realm in the path. Thus, the very entity of the path removing the frights of cyclic existence involves using the attributes of the Desire Realm in the path but in a manner such that one is not sullied by the faults of cyclic existence. Due to assistance from special method and wisdom, even though one makes use of the attributes of the Desire Realm, the faults of those actions' impelling rebirth in cyclic existence are not incurred. Without such method and wisdom, partaking of the attributes of the Desire Realm serves as a cause inducing more suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death. For me there is no other refuge From the inexhaustible frights of cyclic existence. Therefore, being very compassionate, Be kind to me today. Frightened by awful cyclic existence, from today I especially go for refuge to the Conquerors, With pure body, speech, and mind also to your lotus feet, definitely removing the frights of cyclic existence. You especially go for refuge to the Buddhas and go for refuge to the lotus feet of the lama. Because the lama, being a com­posite of all of three refuges, has the capacity, through his or her blessings, of removing the frights of cyclic existence, you go for refuge with pure body, speech, and mind- bowing down with the body, praising through speech, and being respectfully faithful in mind. Having made that supplication, take the two vows as before on the occasion of the student's preparation. 25 Ne�t is to take the Bodhisattva vows.

How is Buddhahood attained? Each individual must make effort at it. Therefore, the earlier Bodhisattvas, as techniques for attaining Buddhahood, initially generated an altruistic intention to become enlightened and then trained in the six perfections whereby they became fully enlightened. Therefore, you should think: \"Just as the earlier Bodhisattvas generated an altruistic intention to become enlightened, so I also will generate such an intention. Just as they trained in the Bodhisattva deeds, so l will train in those deeds. Thereby I will atta in Buddhahood. That is what I will do.\" A combina­tion of this aspiration to Buddhahood for the sake of others and training in the Bodhisattva deeds is needed. It is just as Shantideva says in his Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds (byang chub sems dpa'i spyod pa Ia 'jug pa, bodhicarya­vatiira):26 Just as the earlier Ones Gone to Bliss Generated an altruistic intention to become enlightened And dwelt by stages in the learnings of Bodhisattvas, So I also for the sake of helping transmigrators Will generate an altruistic intention to become enlightened And train in stages in the learnings of Bodhisattvas. Create strong determination in your mind to generate an altruistic aspiration for supreme enlightenment-this mind of aspiration serving as the basis for the Bodhisattva deeds - and strong determination to take the Bodhisattva vows as well as to train in all the Bodhisattva deeds. In the stanza that is recited, the first line, \"I go for refuge to the Three Jewels,\" is the taking of refuge. The second line, \"Individually disclose all ill-deeds,\" is a disclosure, within a sense of contrition, of the ill-deeds that you have done and accumulated since beginningless time. The third line, \"Admire the virtues of beings,\" is a joyous admiration - from the depths of your heart, without any jealousy or competitive­ness- of your own and others' roots of virtue that have been accumulated. The fourth line, \"And mentally take up the enlightenment of a Buddha,\" is the statement that you -with refuge, disclosure of ill-deeds, and admiration of virtues as precursors - will, no matter what happens, attain Buddha-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"226 The Kiilachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary hood for the sake of all sentient beings and for that purpose will take the Bodhisattva vows and will train properly in them. However, those who do not feel that they can take the Bodhisattva vows should not think that they are taking them; they should merely think to generate this good altruistic in­tention to become enlightened. Identify well for the students and cause them to under­stand in detail the thought of how to assume the com­mon and uncommon Great Vehicle vows in stages and the meaning of keeping the vows. Then, the students repeat [after the la ma] three times: I go for refuge to the Three Jewels, Individually disclose all ill-deeds, Admire the virtues of beings, And mentally take up the enlightenment of a Buddha. Through that the [Bodhisattva] vows common [to the Si:ltra Great Vehicle and the Mantra Great Vehicle] are taken. With the second repetition, generate an even stronger wish to generate an altruistic intention to become enlightened, to take the Bodhisattva vows, and to train in the Bodhisattva deeds. Then, at the end of the third repetition, when you finish saying, \"And mentally take up the enlightenment of a Bud­dha,\" one-pointedly think that the pure Bodhisattva vows have been generated in your continuum. As is said in Shantideva's Engaging in the Bodhisattva Oeeds27 there is great benefit in even generating the aspirational fom1 of the altruistic intention to become enlightened; hence, there is no need to say that taking the Bodhisattva vows and there­upon training in the deeds are of inconceivable benefit.

I will firmly keep individually The three forms of ethics- the ethical precepts, The composite of virtuous practices, And bringing about the welfare of sentient beings. Then, with respect to the pledges of the five Buddha lineages:28 For the five-pointed vajra [lineage of Akshobhya] I will maintain vajra, bell, seal, and lama with the crown of my head. Literally, the text reads, \"the desirous vajra\" ('dod pa'i rdo rje); however, \"desire\" here is a term for \"five\", the connection being that there are five attributes of the Desire Realm -pleasant visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tangible objects. The lineage of the five-pointed vajra is that of Ak�hobhya, and the pledges that correspond to this lineage are to keep (1) the vajra, which symbolizes the exalted wisdom of great bliss, (2) the bell, which symbolizes the wisdom realizing emptiness, and (3) the great seal, which here refers to a divine body-the appearance of the apprehension factor of such bliss and wisdom realizing emptiness as a deity. You are saying that you always will keep these, without forgetting them, and not only those, but also will maintain (4) proper reliance, with the crown of your head, on the lama who teaches the modes of those three. For the jewel [lineage of I<atnasambhava] I will give gifts; for the wheel [lineage of Vairochana] I will keep the pledges of the supreme Conquerors."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Outside the Curtain 229 The uncommon pledges to be kept by a practitioner of the jewel lineage, that of Ratnasambhava, are to train always in the ten aspects of giving - giving to others wealth such as precious substances, iron, copper, cattle, horses, elephants, and so forth as well as one's mate and children, one's own flesh, etc. The wheel lineage is that of Vairochana. A practitioner of this lineage is especially to maintain the pledges of the supreme Conquerors, the five Ones Gone Thus - that is to say, to use the five fleshes and five ambrosias, which have the nature of the five male and female Ones Gone Thus, and to take care of the body and sense powers. Vairochana is the factor of purification of the form aggregate, and the five fleshes and five ambrosias are used as means of enhancing the.body, which is the basis of bliss. Similarly, asceticism that makes the body deteriorate is to be avoided. For the sword [lineage of Amoghasiddhi) I will make offerings; for the bright lotus [lineage of Amitabha) I will maintain restraint. For the sword lineage of Amoghasiddhi, the uncommon or emphasized pledges are to make offerings-external, internal, secret, and of suchness - to high objects such as gurus, Bud­dhas, Bodhisattvas, and so forth. The lotus lineage is that of Amitabha, practitioners of which especially should keep the pledge of restraining from, or abandoning, the bliss of emis­sion, even though making use of a consort, and thereby main­tain pure behavior. So that sentient beings may be liberated, I will, for the [Vajrasattva) lineage of the progenitor of Conquerors, generate enlightenment. The lineage of the progenitor of Conquerors is that of Vajra­sattva- also called Vajradhara- the lineage of the one-pointed vajra. A practitioner of this lineage puts particular emphasis on generating enlightenment. That is to say: Unsurpassed enlightenment is a state of the full perfection or development of the capacity of the most subtle wind and mind. As a means for accomplishing this, the most subtle mind that we naturally"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"230 The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary have is to be generated into the path as an undiJferentiable entity of method and wisdom, of compassion and the wisdom realizing emptiness, the feat of the great seal. Since highest enlightenment is to be achieved in this way, one who has the lineage of Vajrasattva puts emphasis on generating the very subtle consciousness itself into an entity of path- undifferen­tiable method and wisdom -as a technique for attaining such enlightenment. What is the purpose of keeping these pledges? It is for the sake of (1) liberating from the obstructions to omniscience those beings who, even though they are free from the obstruc­tions to liberation from cyclic existence, are not free from the obstructions to omniscience, (2) liberating those who, never­mind the obstructions to omniscience, are not free from the obstructions to liberation, (3) relieving those who, nevermind removing either the obstructions to omniscience or the ob­structions to liberation, are under the influence of afflictive emotions such that they are in a state of deprivation from happiness in bad transmigrations as hell-beings, hungry ghosts, or animals. In brief, you should think, \"I am taking these vows in order to set each and every sentient being in the non-abiding nir­vana of Buddhahood. Taking the lama and the deities of the mandala as witnesses, I will train in the path of Highest Yoga Mantra in order to bring help and happiness to all sentient beings, and to do that I am taking the Mantra vows.\" I will liberate those not liberated [from the obstruc­tions to omniscience]. I will release those not released [from cyclic exis­tence). I will relieve those unrelieved [in bad transmigra­tions) And set sentient beings in nirvana. In brief, Mantra vows are kept in order to be able to set all sentient beings in the non-abiding nirvana of Buddhahood.

Next is the giving of the twenty-five modes of conduct, which are to refrain from the five ill deeds, the five secondary ill deeds, th� five murders, the five malices, and the five desires. 29 Harmfulness, untruth, and others' mates30 are to be abandoned; likewise are others' wealth and the drinking of beer. These are the five ill deeds, 31 vajra nooses, des­troyers of your virtue. These are given with the name of [Shakyamuni and so forth] gurus of gods and humans - having arisen at the time [of his teaching].

The five malices are to have malice for friends, leaders, gurus, the Spiritual Community, or those who trust and rely on you. The five desires are to be mentally captivated by pleasant visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tangible objects, viewing them as singly advantageous without being aware of their disadvantages. Practitioners are to refrain from these twenty-five. The student accepts them by saying three times: I will forever keep These twenty-five modes of conduct, Destroying the frights of cyclic existence In accordance with the word of [Shakyamuni and so forth) the chief of the various [beings). [320) Next is to generate the mind of the all-encompassing yoga; this means to generate the conventional and ultimate minds of enlightenment. This is the most important part. First, we should think about being kind and altruistic, other-oriented, as much as we can, through reasons and through whatever approach is effective. In brief, it is as Shantideva says in his Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds about the opposite of altruism:34 If one does not switch One's own happiness for others' suffering, One will not achieve Buddha hood And will not have happiness even in cyclic existence. If we are not able to switch our self-centeredness, in which we think only about our own happiness and neglect others, for an attitude of emphasizing others' happiness, not only will we not be able finally to achieve Buddhahood, but also for the time being we will be uncomfortable and have to undergo many various sufferings even while remaining in cyclic exis­tence."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Outside the Curtain 233 Obviously, even in our present situation, through anger and hatred we cannot achieve real lasting world peace. Though many talk about good topics such as disarmament and arms control, how can these goals be achieved through hatred? It is impossible. They can be achieved only through a peaceful mind -through love, kindness, and mutual trust. Through hatred we cannot develop mutual trust, and without trust how can such beautiful goals be achieved? You can make a huge document with a huge pen, but nobody will respect it if something is wrong in your heart. So, all of these things can be achieved only through a good heart. Thus, on the levels of the individual family, the nation, and the world, peace is achieved through good motivation, a warm heart, real human feeling. Even if a couple has promised to live together for the rest of this life, once anger and hatred develop and grow, the result is divorce. These unnecessary things come because of hatred, because of a lack of kindness, lack of love, lack of understanding, lack of mutual respect. This is very clear. We must develop kindness with strong determination. Then, think that this attitude of kindness -which you have developed such that you are strongly and vividly moved to help all sentient beings-transforms into a moon disc at your heart. Without such feeling, it is nothing just to visualize a moon disc. Therefore, we must develop a determined feeling, which then can be transformed into a moon disc. This is the part of the all-encompassing yoga concerned with the con­ventional mind of enlightenment. The other part is concerned with realization of emptiness.

That is definite. If they exist the way they appear, then when the objects designated are sought, they should become clearer and clearer.

This is related particularly with keeping from the first root infraction of the Mantra vows-to deride the lama. Then, the lama grasps the right hand of the student and sets [the student] particularly in the pledge [to keep from] the first infraction: From henceforth, I am your Vajrapax:U. You must do what I tell you to do. You should not deride me, and if you do, without forsaking fright, the time of death will come, and you will fall into a hell.

In general, the Form Body of a Bud­dha, as is said in Shii.ntideva's Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds, appears variously to trainees - through the force of having collected the two accumulations of merit and wisdom­naturally, spontaneously and without striving, in accordance with the dispositions and interests of trainees. It is not that a Buddha has a particular form whether there are trainees or not. The Form Bodies of a Buddha depend upon the situations and needs of trainees. Some even say that Form Bodies are included in the continuums of trainees; whether this position is literally acceptable or not, it prompts understanding of the nature of Form Bodies. The purpose of the appearance of a Form Body is as an object of observation of meditation by a womb-born being with the six constituents of earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness; thus, the appearance of a particular Form Body is related with a meditator and accords with the situation of that practitioner. Now, in the case of Kii.lachakra, the mode of practice of the Kiilachakra Tantra is related with meditation of the cosmic factors of the external Kii.lachakra mentioned earlier. There­fore,-the particular form of divine body upon which a practi­tioner meditates is related with such meditation.

I will not go into greater detail about Kalachakra now. You should think that you have encountered and seen the entire mandala just as it appears in the painting - having a nature of light.

With this as the basis, Highest Yoga Tantra sets forth techniques for perfecting the Buddha qualities of exalted body, speech, and mind. In the Kalachakra system there is reference to four factors­body, speech, mind, and bliss. 45 It also speaks of four drops in a person's body.

The drop at the crown of the head that produces the waking state has the capacity of causing various appearances of objects. In our ordinary state as a sentient being, that is to say, as a non-Buddha, it produces appearances of impure objects. Through the process of the path, one makes use of this capacity for the mere appearance of objects by activating it and overcoming the factor that brings about impure appearances; when this is done, various pure forms - subtle and gross-appear by way of the activated capacity of the drop that produces the waking state.

To urtderstand Mantra well, it is helpful to understand the"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Water Initiation 271 meaning of this stanza: Something auspicious resides in the essence of all beings. This can be explained in terms of the clear light as object - the emptiness of inherent existence-and in terms of the clear light as subject- consciousness. In terms of the clear light as object, the reality of the mind- its empti­ness of inherent existence- which resides in, or pervades, the heart of all consciousness is the nature of all the stable and moving phenomena of cyclic existence and of nirvana, the mode of subsistence of all pure and impure phenomena and thus the essence of all. · The great bliss consciousness that is of the same undifferen­tiable entity as the reality of emptiness appears as the deity, Ak�hobhya, whose lineage is supreme among the five line­ages. Among the five mental and physical aggregates that are the basis being purified, the aggregate of consciousness is the chief, the others being secondary; thus, among the five Con­queror lineages Ak�hobhya is chief since he is associated with purifying the aggregate of consciousness. The exalted wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and the emptiness of inherent exis­tence of the mind - which has become devoid of obstructions -is the definitive Ak�hobhya, the definitive Kalachakra. Since this great bliss consciousness is that generating all pure sentient beings- Buddhas, Ones Gone to Bliss- it is the progenitor of all the sentient, the basis of emanation or pro­genitor of all pure sentient beings and their environments. Furthermore, its appearance as a deity with a face, arms, and so forth is Ak�hobhya, or Kalachakra, who is the supreme, the lord, of all of the other Buddha lineages. Today, an auspi­ciousness has been created through generating such a great bliss consciousness in your continuum. Then, in terms of the clear light as subject, the essential auspiciousness is the fundamental innate mind of clear light which we have. had since beginningless time. It also is called the Buddha nature. The Kalachakra Tantra speaks of this es­sence when it says, \"Sentient beings are Buddhas; other great Buddhas do not exist in the worldly realms.\" Similarly, the Hevajra Tantra says: Sentient beings are just Buddhas,"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"272 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Tlu• Dalai l.ama's Commentary But they are defiled by adventitious stains. When those are removed, they are BudJhos. Likewise, the Vajrapanjara Tantra, an explanatory tantra [of the Hevajra cycle], sa ys: Aside from the precious mind There are no Buddhas, there are no sentient beings. Just as the entity of even dirty water is not polluted by filth, so the nature of the fundamental innate mind of clear light is not polluted by defilements. Thus, the mind of clear light of an impure sentient being is not polluted by the afflictions; it is the Buddha nature, which is the \"substance\" that is trans­formed into a Buddha's Wisdom Truth Body Hence, Buddha­hood is not to be sought from the outside. Since this is the case, as long as you do not understand that the fundamental innate mind of clear light is your nature, you are a sentient being, and when you have final understanding that it is your nature, you are a Buddha. Moreover, the Hevajra Tantra says: Buddhas are not to be found elsewhere In any of the realms of the world. Just sentient beings are just complete Buddhas. Buddhas are not demonstrable elsewhere. This is called \"cyclic existence\"; This is just nirvana. Due to obscuration, it has the form of cyclic existence; Without obscuration, cyclic existence is just pure. The one fundamental innate mind of clear light is called cyclic existence and is called nirvana. Then, what kind of state is called cyclic existence? What kind of state is called nirvana? The difference depends upon whether you have obscuration about your own nature or not. The fundamental innate mind of clear light abides in or pervades the heart of all sentient beings. It also is the final essence and creator of all environments a;,d beings, the basis of emanation of all of cyclic existence and nirvana. For, all phenomena - environments and beings - are the sport or"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Water Initiation 273 artifice of the fundamental innate mind of clear light, called the basis of all. It is the basis of emanation of all five Con­queror lineages and thus \"the supreme lord of all lineages\" since the fundamental innate mind of clear light is divided into the five exalted wisdoms from which the five Conqueror lineages appear. It also is the \"progenitor of all the sentient\" in that it is what produces all pure and impure sentience, the final basis of designation of all persons. \"Great bliss\" has two connotations. One meaning refers to a blissful consciousness that arises through the force of the melting of the essential constituent at the time of the path, and the other refers, in the basic state, to the mind of clear light which, because it has a nature of non-conceptuality, is free from the pollution of conceptuality. With this as background, you can put together the particular explanations in the Kalachakra Tantra, the Guhyasamaja Tantra, the Hevajra Tantra, and the Chakrasan:zvara Tantra as well as the systems based on these tantras - the great seal (phyag rgya chen po, mahamudra) as taught in the Ga-gyu-ba order, the view of the undifferentiability of cyclic existence and nirvana in terms of the causal continuum of the basis-of­all that is a union of manifestation and emptiness as found in the Sa-gya-ba order, the Ge-luk-ba presentation of the funda­mental innate mind of clear light according to the Guhya­samaja system, and the great completeness of the Nying-ma order in which all appearances of en vironments and beings are decisively settled as the artifice, or self-effulgence, of basic mind from within the division of mind (sems) and basic mind (rig pa) -everything not passing beyond the sport of this basic mind. All of these practices come down to the same final thought. With understanding and analysis of many texts of the Middle Way School and of Highest Yoga Mantra, all of these are seen as coming together in the same basic thought. However, if you are not familiar with these texts, you might think that these systems are radically different just from see­ing and being amazed at their di fferent vocabulary. 52 The mind of clear light is present right now in our mental continuum.

Through these, for the time being, conceptuality stops, and a non-conceptual aware­ness is generated. Even if you are not able actually to do this, you should mimic the state in imagination. Stopping distraction to the outside, develop whatever understanding you can of the mere luminous and knowing nature of the mind and, even more, of subtler consciousness, and then within that state become mindful of the reality of the mind, its emptiness of inherent existence. Still, when we contemplate the reality of the mind, even though it is neces­sary to induce ascertainment of the emptiness of inherent existence, experience of the mind - the factor of luminosity and knowing- which ascertains the emptiness of inherent existence dawns. Therefore, it probably is the case that in meditative equipoise one is set in equipoise on the mere factor of luminosity and knowing [and not just on the empti­ness of inherent existence). Today you have been initiated into generating this funda­mental innate mind of clear light as an entity of immutable bliss of undifferentiable method and wisdom in the sense that this has been generated in your continuum. This is what you are to think; this is the auspiciousness. You should listen to the stanza within reflecting on this meaning. The Vajra Worker raises up the vase.

Being without contradic­tion or taint and not subject to unbiased dispute, his teaching is unwavering. In another way, \"highest supreme\" can be taken as true paths from among the four noble truths -the wisdom directly realizing the meaning of suchness, emptiness, and thereby acting as a direct antidote to the obstructions that are to be abandoned due to which it is \"highest\" and \"supreme\".

When the ten Bodhisattva grounds of the Perfection Vehicle are put together with the two stages of generation and com­pletion of Highest Yoga Mantra, the stage of generation takes a practitioner through the seventh Bodhisattva ground, and the stage of completion, through the eighth, ninth, and tenth grounds. The seven initiations in the pattern of childhood, which are means of ripening the mental continuum for the practice of the stage of generation, are, therefore, aligned with the first seven Bodhisattva grounds. In the Perfection Vehicle, the attainment of the first Bodhi­sattva ground is simultaneous with attaining the path of a Superior ('phags pa, aryan), but in Highest Yoga Mantra a Superior path is attained only with the eighth ground during the stage of completion. Thus, the correspondence of the stage of generation with the first seven grounds is from the point of view that when the stage of generation is finished, the coiiec­tion of merit that has been achieved is equal to that of a seventh ground Bodhisattva of the Perfection Vehicle. Since even a first ground Bodhisattva has realized emptiness direct­ly, a practitioner of Highest Yoga Mantra who has finished the stage of generation is lesser in that respect, but from the viewpoint of having accumulated the collections of merit, such a Mantrika is equal to a seventh grounder.

For example, if you look at a green leaf before putting on yellow sun glasses, you see that it is green; then, even though after putting on the sun glasses, it appears to be yellow, right from its appearance as yellow this very appearance serves as a condition for your thinking that the yellowness of the leaf is due to the glasses, that the leaf is not yellow. Seeing the yellow leaf serves as a condition for the ascertainment that the leaf dbes not exist as it appears. In the same way, once you have developed good understanding in your mind that phenomena are dependent-arisings and thus are empty of inherent exis­tence, then, upon the undeniable appearance of objects as if they inherently exist, that very appearance serves as a condi­tion inducing ascertainment that except for appearing that way, those objects do not inherently exist. From the very appearance of objects as if they exist in their own right, ascertainment of the emptiness of their existing that way is found. When encountering objects, instead of coming under the influence of their appearance as if they inherently exist, that very appearance serves to assist ascertainment that those ob­jects do not inherently exist. Similarly, during meditative equipoise, the consciousness ascertaining the meaning of emptiness is a blissful one that has arisen upon the melting of internal essential constituents. When that blissful conscious­ness one-pointedly ascertains emptiness, subsequent to such meditative equipoise whatever appears dawns not only as the sport of emptiness but also as the sport of bliss due to the force of the earlier one-pointed, strong consideration of emptiness and bliss as undifferentiable during meditative equipoise.

Rather, within letting the senses encounter their ob­jects, you do not come under the influence of conceptuality. That is the essential meaning and purpose of the conduct initiation.

For the success of such practice of mantra, special potency needs to be developed by way of the view realizing emptiness. Hence, in.order to establish predispositions for the initial realization of empti­ness through the route of conceptual meaning-generalities on the path of accumulation and the path of preparation, eye medicine is given after the giving of mantra. Then, in order to establish predispositions for perceiving all phenomena as like illusions after rising from such meditative equipoise on emptiness, a mirror is given. Then, in order to establish predispositions for directly perceiving emptiness after prac­ticing a union of such meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, bow and arrow are given. After that, the actual vajra master initiation is conferred. During the first part, you repeat the mantras upon the lama's saying them. First, instantaneously visualize your­selves as Kalachakras. With the initial repetition of the mantra, a series of mantra letters at the heart of the lama, who is visualized as Kalachakra, emerges from his mouth and enters into your mouth and is set at your heart. With the second repetition it becomes undifferentiable from the mantra series at your heart, and with the third repetition becomes firm, such that you thereby receive all the magnificent blessings of the mantra.

GIVING EYE MEDICINE The purpose of giving eye medicine is to establish predis­positions for engendering special realization of the emptiness of inherent existence, this realization being through the medium of a meaning-generality [i.e., a conceptual image] on the paths of accumulation and preparation. The students imagine that on each of their eyes is the black syllable pram; these are considered to contain all of the student's ill-deeds and obstructions and, in particular, factors preventing per­ception of reality.

To establish predispositions so that you can actualize such reali­zation, a mirror is given. Think that: From al:l a mirror arises. Then, show it. Phenomena are like reflections, Luminous and clear, without befoulment, Unapprehendable, and inexpressible, Arisen from causes and actions (/as, karma).

GIVING BOW AND ARROW Next a bow and arrow are given. Just as an arrow pierces its target deeply, so when you continually become accustomed to perceiving the emptiness of inherent existence through the medium of a conceptual image, finally all pollutions of dual­istic appearance are extinguished such that your conscious­ness realizing emptiness and emptiness itself are like water put in water - subject and object having become one undifferentiable entity. Yogic direct perception realizing suchness is thereby achieved. Thus, bow and arrow are given as a means of ripening your continuum so that such realization will be generated speedily.

Furthermore, the !antra says,67 \"Upon having thoroughly bestowed vajra and bell, the doctrine of purification is to be indicated with thoroughly supreme compassion.\" Through its explicit mention of bestow­ing the pledges of vajra and bell, it is implicitly under­stood that it is also necessary to bestow the seal pledge.

Therefore, while such is not mentioned in the [Kiilachakra] Tantra, they hold it to be the case through faults of their own mind, and although such a master initiation [as described in the Kiilachakra Tantra] is attained, since it is said that this just allows one to be a master authorized to explain, etc., Yoga Tantra and below, [they would absurdly have to hold] that although one attained the master initiation indicated [in the system of Guhya­samiija and so forth] through that stanza, one would not be fit as a master authorized to explain, etc., Highest Yoga Tantra. Thereby they would, with great striving, be taking upon themselves the very heavy karmic obstruction of abandoning the doctrine, [holding that] \"There is no fully qualified vajra master initiation in other classes of initiations, such as those of Guhya­samaja, Hevajra, and Chakrasan:zvara.\" Therefore, here [in the Kalachakra Tantra the term] \"seal pledge\" refers not to a seal that is a Knowledge Woman [a consort] but to the divine body great seal [i.e., imagi­nation of oneself in divine form].

You should give this body as well as wealth for the sake of sentient beings; you should not [selfishly) keep it. 0 Child of good lineage, the Conqueror says that [through this) you will become a Buddha and otherwise will not even over limitless eons. 68 In that way, indicate the pledges in their provisional and definitive senses. The statement in the tantra be­ginning with \"Water (chu)\" and ending with \"are to be thoro11ghly bestowed (rab sbyin bya)\"69 is a summari­zation of the meaning explained earlier: \"In that way the master thoroughly bestows on the student the seven - the water initiation and so forth.\" [348] The import is not that, when conferring initiation, the master should speak these words to the student. Such statements are explained in two ways, provisionally and definitively. For example, in the Guhyasamaja Tantra one statement such as, \"If [you) kill the groups of Ones Gone Thus, [you] will attain the highly supreme feat,\" must be explained in many different ways, these being called the six modes and four ways. Here, in the statement of these pledges, it is said that those of the vajra lineage- that is to say, those of the �hobhya lineage- \"definitely should take life\". In its provisional sense, this means that those of the Akshobhya lineage, motivated by compassion, could - under special circumstances -kill per­sons who are harmful to the teaching or who hate sentient beings and are about to commit hideous non-virtues but cannot be restrained by other means. In its definitive sense, this means that those of the Ak�hobhya lineage should bind the white mind of enlightenment, which is the basis of bliss, in the crown protrusion and should take the life of the winds that bring about emission.

In its definitive sense, this means that those of the Amoghasiddhi lineage should speak the thoroughly non-abiding false word of the unconquerable short a at the heart upon withdrawing the winds in the central channel. In the Guhyasamiija Tantra, it is said that one should speak false words in the sense that since whereas phenomena do not inherently exist they appear to inherently exist, one should speak of the emptiness of in­herent existence which does not accord with the false mode of appearance of phenomena. It is said that those of jewel lineage of Ratnasambhava \"should steal others' wealth\". In its provisional sense, this means that those of the Ratnasambhava lineage, whose pre­dominant affliction is great miserliness, under special circum­stances could- in order to overcome it- steal others' wealth in order to use it in helping sentient beings. In its definitive sense, this means that those of the Ratnasambhava lineage should steal the wish-granting jewel of the immutable drop at the throat, this being like the statement in the Guhyasamiija Tantra that one should take Buddhahood without its being given since it is something that cannot be given but must be achieved oneself. It is said that those of the lotus lineage of Amitabha \"should steal others' mates\". In its provisional sense, this means that those of the Amitabha lineage, in order to help a sentient being who is particularly attached to his or her mate and, due to which, is accumulating bad karma, could - under special circumstances and for the sake of helping that person - take his or her mate. In its definitive sense, this means that those of the Amitabha lineage should steal the great seal woman with immutable bliss, possessing all the supreme aspects, at the forehead.

It is said that those of the Vairochana lineage symbolized by the wheel should make use of intoxicants, the Buddha lamps­the five fleshes and the five ambrosias - and all good objects. In its provisional sense, this means that those of the Vairo­chana lineage could use the substances indicated in the pledges without any attachment. In its definitive sense, this means that those of the Vairochana lineage should, with in­nate joy, bind at the navel the essence of all the faculties and constituents, the one like ambrosia, without emission. It is said that those of the Vajrasattva lineage symbolized by a curved knife \"should not deride the sky-lotus of any woman\", those of low type and so forth. In its provisional sense, this means that those of the Vajrasattva lineage should not deride a woman of any of the five lineages even if she be lowly. In its definitive sense, this means that those of the Vajrasattva lineage should use seals [consorts) but within binding, without emission, the white mind of enlightenment that is the basis of bliss. That all of these activities are to be done within being motivated by compassion and altruism and for the sake of accumulating merit is indicated by the statement that, \"You should give this body as well as wealth for the sake of sentient beings; you should not [selfishly) keep it.\" Through training in such a unified practice for accumulating the collections of merit and wisdom, one abides in the principles of the Mantra path, whereby Buddhahood can be easily achieved. Without it, through practicing merely the path of the Perfection Vehicle even over an immeasurable period of eons, Buddhahood can­not be attained.

According to the prevalent interpretation of the Thera­vadins, this is the 252Sth year since Shakyamuni Buddha passed away. Within the sixteenth cycle this is the iron-female-bird year. According to the Kalachakra system, this is the middle month of summer; in coarser terms the month of ii.on (snron, jye��ha), and in finer terms the chu-d6 (chu stod, purva�hadha) month, the fifteenth day. The sun is in the house of conjugality. According to another system of calculation, this is the month of great earth-male-monkey in the waxing phase. According to the Kalachakra system, this is the vowel ! and consonant t; in terms of constituent, it is earth; in terms of the desirous attributes, it is odor; in terms of planet, it is Venus (Friday); at such a time activities of increase and explaining doctrine are favored.

If, having received the vows, you do not keep them properly due to coming under the influence of the afflictive emotions, this will serve as a condition for the onset of suffering. There­fore, you should keep the vows properly. There is purification of root infractions for those dwelling with the seven initiations and posses­sing the qualities [of intention of restraint in the future by way of repeating their deity's mantra thirty-six thousand times]. 73 If a root infraction does occur, it needs to be purified through developing a strong force of regret for having done the infrac­tion as well as a strong intention to restrain from that action in the future. Those who have received just the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood should repeat the mantra of the deity, on which the flower has fallen, thirty-six thousand times, whereby it is said that the infraction will be purified."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"360 The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary Those having the vase and secret initiations [purify infractions) through the force of assuming a [special] mode of conduct. For those having the higher [initiations) there is no purification [through just those means). Those who have also received the vase initiations and the secret initiations can purify infractions through engaging in earnest and special accumulation of merit. For them it is not sufficient just to repeat the mantra of their deity; rather, they must make special effort at accumulating collections of merit and earnest training in ethics. Those who have received initiations higher than the vase and secret initiations- that is to say, the knowledge-wisdom initiation and above -cannot purify infractions merely by repeating mantra or assuming a special mode of conduct, but can do so through also receiving the magnificent blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas after assuming a special ethical mode of conduct. As one's status becomes higher and higher due to receiving higher initiations, the responsibilities be­come greater and greater such that even small deviations incur great fault. Even though the infraction is the same, greater fault is incurred by those with the higher initiations, and thus there are different means of purification. Those for whom a root infraction has occurred should, for the sake of purifying that infraction, enter into this mandala, But despite having attained permission [that is, restored the vow] your name becomes lesser in the assembly. For the sake of purifying a root infraction, one should re-enter the mandala and receive initiation, thereby restoring the vows, but due to having earlier incurred fault one's position in the assembly of yogis becomes lower. Then, what constitute root infractions? From disturbing the mind of the glorious lama, childish beings come to hold the first'4 root in­fraction."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Advice to Abandon the Root Infractions 361 If you do not follow the word of the lama from whom you receive the glorious Kalachakra initiation - with the priviso that the word of the lama accords with the doctrine - and thereby disturb the lama's mind, this constitutes the first infraction. Kulika Pu�C;iarika's Great Commentary on the \"Kala­chakra Tantra\", the Stainless Light says that not following in­structions by the lama that do not accord with the doctrine is without fault. As is said, \"Act in accordance with virtuous doctrine; act in discordance with non-virtuous doctrine.\" With apology and explanation of the reasons, you should refrain from doing what does not accord with the doctrine; it is not suitable to take the lama's absence of accordance with the doctrine as a condition generating disrespect and lack of faith. Through deviating from his word, there is another; likewise, through anger at brothers [and sisters] there is the third. If you transgress the precepts set forth by the lama without any regard for them, there is the second infraction, different from the first. The third is, out of anger, to speak fault of or become belligerent toward vajra brothers and sisters- those who have received initiation from the same lama, either be­fore, later, or at the same time. Through forsaking love there is the fourth; from losing the mind of enlightenment there is the fifth . The fourth infraction is to lose your love .for sentient beings. With regard to the fifth infraction, the most excellent means for achieving complete perfect enlightenment is the exalted wisdom of immutable bliss, and the essential constituent, which is white like the kunda flower and is called by the name \"mind of enlightenment\", is the basis of that bliss. Hence, if a practitioner does not keep this white \"mind of enlighten­ment\" without emission and instead becomes attached to the bliss of its being emitted outside, thereby allowing its emis­sion, this constitutes an infraction. Similarly, losing the"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"362 The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary aspirational altruistic intention to become enlightened is also a root infraction. The sixth is to deride the tenets [of the Perfection Vehicle]; the seventh is from giving the secrecies to unripened persons. The sixth infraction is to deride the Perfection Vehicle as useless merely because through its practice alone Buddhahood cannot be achieved. The seventh is to give the secrecies to those whose continuums have not been ripened by initiation or who do not have faith. From afflicting your [mental and physical] aggre­gates there is the eighth; again, the ninth is non-faith in the [natural] purity of phenomena. The mental and physical aggregates of a yogi, which are such that they allow practice of the exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness, are very valuable. Hence, it is the eighth infraction to afflict your own mental and physical aggregates with the intention of causing your body to deteriorate. The ninth is to not have faith in the mitural purity of phenomena, their such­ness or mode of subsistence, which is the emptiness of in­herent existence. If you do not have faithful interest in the view of emptiness of either the Mind Only School or the Middle Way School and tum away from it, this constitutes an infraction. Deceitful love is the tenth, and [having] qualn:s about the bestowal of the bliss devoid of names and so forth is the eleventh. \"Deceitful love\" means that there is a discordance between your mouth and your heart. If in your heart you harbor dislike but, out of a wish to deceive, in your mouth you pretend to be sweet and loving, this is the tenth infraction. \"The doctrine devoid of names\" is emptiness, and thus to abandon the exalted wisdom of immutable bliss and emptiness, not making effort at the means to realize it, is the eleventh infrac­tion."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Advice to Abandon the Root Infractions 363 From speaking fault about pure sentient beings there is the twelfth; forsaking pledges that have been attained is another [the thirteenth]. \"Pure sentient beings\" here are yogis; to speak fault of them is the twelfth infraction. Neglecting pledges requiring one to make use of seals, vajra, bell, and so forth with the sense that these are not needed in one's training constitutes the thir­teenth infraction. Deriding any woman is the fourteenth. These are for those abiding in the Vajra Vehicle. In general, women are very kind and, in particular, assist greatly in the generation of the exalted wisdom of bliss and emptiness. Therefore, all women are to be respected with discrimination of them as like your mother. If, opposite to that, you deride any woman, this is the fourteenth root infraction. These are precepts to be kept by those who have entered a mandala of the Mantra Vehicle and have received the Mantra vows.

These authorize persons to hear, think about, and meditatively cultivate the stage of generation. Then, when students come to have the qualifications necessary to be a suitable vessel for cultivating the stage of completion, at that point the four high initiations and the fourth greatly high initiation are needed. Moreover, if someone not only cultivates the two stages - of generation and completion ­which are the meaning of the Kiilachakra Tantra, but also is to teach the entire tantra to others, that person also needs all four greatly high initiations as well as the initiation of a vajra master great lord. The initiations for the stage of completion are, for the time being, not needed; later, when such are appropriate in terms of students' development, they can be considered. Since you have attained initiation, or authorization, for the stage of generation, your focus should be on cultivating that stage in practice. Furthermore, as much as the stage of genera­tion is cultivated in a vast way, so much more profound is the practice. The most condensed version of meditative cultiva­tion of the stage of generation is self-generation in a mandala of exalted mind, but even this is difficult for some. Thus, a very short self-generation as Kiilachakra can be done in con­nection with the six session yoga.

It is not absolutely necessary that you recite the words of the rite; it is sufficient to reflect on the meaning. The six session yoga is a compendium of all the practices that need to be performed three times during the day and three times during the night; you need to reflect on their meaning. This is like recharging a battery. If you leave it for a long time. without recharging it, then on the day when you want to use it, it cannot help. Similarly, cultivation of the six session yoga does not necessarily bring about great progress but, at minimum, maintains what you have. Thus, it will be good if you are able to recite and reflect on the six session yoga in connection with self-generation as Kalachakra. If, gradually, you ascertain the meaning of the topics, it is not absolutely necessary to recite the words; rather, you can do reflective meditation on the meaning of the topics, causing each of the topics to appear to your mind. Meditation that is a unification of stabilizing and analytical meditation is needed. The main practice is deity yoga. When clear appearance as a deity and the \"pride\" of being that deity develop to the point where you are able to remain in such clear appearance and \"pride\" for four hours without interruption by other concep­tions-given that you have no physical malady, etc. -you have developed the stage of generation well. At that point, on whatever object of observation in the body you set your mind, since wind and mind operate together, the winds gather at th'at place. Even now when we perform such imaginations in connection with the winds, the top of the head can start itching, and so forth. When, in that way, the stage of generation is fully cultivat­ed, you are to mix your mind entirely with cultivation of the stage of completion. The stage of completion in the Kiilachakra Tantra is the six-branched yoga, which need not be explained here. At the point of the sixth branch in the stage of completion, called the branch of meditative stabilization, one attains a union of immutable bliss and empty form.

At that point, as the basis of immutable bliss, one has completed twenty-one thousand six hundred units of the essential constituent called the \"mind of enlightenment\", and in dependence upon that, one has actualized twenty-one thousand six hundred periods of immutable bliss, through which twenty-one thousand six hundred karmic winds have ceased and twenty-one thousand six hundred material factors of the body have been consumed. In the next moment the state of the Four Bodies of a Buddha is actualized. To practice such paths of the stage of generation and the stage of completion, it is necessary first to attain pure initia­tion. To attain pure initiation, it is necessary to have experi­ence of the altruistic intention to become enlightened. Also, the view of emptiness is needed since, as explained during the initiation, it is involved throughout the beginning, mid­dle, and end of the process of initiation. When the view of emptiness is conjoined with the altruistic intention to become enlightened, the view of emptiness can serve as an antidote to the obstructions to omniscience. To have such an altruistic intention to become enlightened - that is to say, to develop a wish to set all sentient beings in the state of Buddhahood in which all suffering and its causes are extinguished- previously it is necessary to develop in full form compassion that takes cognizance of the sentient beings who are tortured by suffering as well as to have full knowledge of the types of suffering through which they are tortured. Since this is the case, you need initially to identify, in terms of yourself, the general and specific types of suffering in cyclic existence and thereby develop a state of not wanting these sufferings. In order to develop a strong awareness not wanting such general and specific sufferings of cyclic existence and wishing to be liberated from them, it is necessary, as inner divisions of that process-the one being coarser than the other - to overcome attraction to the appearances of this lifetime before overcoming attraction to the appearances of future lifetimes."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"376 The Kalachakra Tantra: The Dalai Lama's Commentary This being the case, mental training must be done step by step. These initiations have brought together factors for the dependent-arising of your cultivating such an entire series of paths. The most important thing is our daily life. As I always express, we as human beings now have a very good oppor­tunity; thus, we must be good, honest persons. This is most important. Then, as practitioners we must sincerely practice what we believe; if we implement these ideas in our daily life, we will get the benefit whereas if they remain as mere know­ledge, we will not benefit. Therefore, it is very important to put these into practice. Also, a beginner should not expect too much right from the beginning. Too much expectation will lead to failure. At the start, you must realize that inner development will take time; it is not at all easy. According to my own experience, it takes time. Then, determination- constant effort- is extremely impor­tant. Whenever we face an unsatisfactory situation, we should not lose our wilL our courage. If we have courage, we can overcome any obstacle. Therefore, our own will and deter­mination are very important. If there were another way through which real permanent peace could be brought, the practice of dharma would not be very important. However, if we cannot find another means to bring ultimate happiness, then there is no alternative other than the spiritual way. We must make a strong determination to practice. At the same time, we must have deep respect for non-Bud­dhist religions. All religions essentially have the same mes­sage of compassion and human improvement.

Due to ignorance we sometimes develop feelings, \"This is my tradition,\" \"This is my religion,\" \"This is my teacher.\" Such is very, very unfortunate; we must remain genuinely non-sectarian. As practitioners, we must blame ourselves rather than others. When some unfavorable thing happens, we should point inward, not outward, \"They did this,\" \"They did that.\" To blame the outside is absolutely wrong. Is this clear? As Buddha said, \"You are your own master.\" For instance, as far as I am concerned, my own future depends on myself. I cannot rely on others for my future; whether it is good or bad depends entirely on myself. If I do something wrong, I will face the ultimate consequences; Buddha cannot. Similarly, your future depends on yourself. Thus, we must be good, honest, sincere, truthful, courageous, and warm-hearted human beings. Through that, our future will be bright.

Those who want the good should not remain attached to the mere marvels of what appears during this lifetime as if such were the essence, but should, as their activity, achieve the great final aims of this and future lifetimes [liberation from cyclic existence and the great liberation of Buddhahood].

In addition, those who have entered into a mandala of any of the two higher tantra sets [Yoga and Highest Yoga Tantra)5 and have attained initiation should review6 daily the root and secondary pledges and vows.

[See n.108 of the Introduction.] 5 Both of these involve taking Mantric vows, and thus the six session yoga must be done for both of these. 6 The meaning of \"review\" is to take each of these to mind, consider what is supposed to be done, and correct oneself."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"The Guru Yoga of Kiilachakra 385 gross contravention of Mantra is a heavier fault even than performing all four defeats of the vow of individual liberation, [killing a human, stealing, sexual misconduct and lying about spiritual attainments] maintenance of the six sessions without break is very important.

Seeing that the responsibility for freeing them from suffering, as well as its causes, and of causing them to possess happiness has fallen on yourself, you should develop the wish to actu­alize the state of union [of exalted body and mind, Buddha­hood,] in just the short lifespan of the degenerate era in order to set those sentient beings in the supreme state of union which does not abide in the extremes of cyclic existence and [solitary] peace. Conjoined with the force of this precious altruistic inten­tion to become enlightened which involves the two aspira­tions [of seeking others' welfare and of seeking your own enlightenment as a means to achieve that], you should visu­alize well - in accordance with what appears in the quint­essential instructions - the objects of refuge in space directly in front of yoursel£. 11 Fulfilling the causal collection for the 11 According to one system, there is a large lotus seat with five smaller seats on it.

This order was founded by the savant and yogi f>zong-ka-ba (1357-1419) from the easternmost region of Tibet. It came to have great influence throughout a region stretching from Kalmuck Mongolian areas near the Volga River (in Europe) where it empties into the Caspian Sea, through what are now Outer and Inner Mongolia and the Buriat Republic of Siberia as well as many parts of Tibet and Ladakh. f>zong-ka-ba established a system of edu­cation with large universities eventually in three areas of Tibet but primarily in Hla-sa, the capital, which was like Rome for the Catholic Church; young men came from all of the above-mentioned regions to Hla-sa to study, usual­ly (until the Communist takeovers) returning to their native lands after completing their studies.

Hence their minds become greatly broadened· with respect to suchness. Hinayanists use only brief reasoning to establish suchness by valid cognition, and since they do not establish emptiness the way Mahayanists do, do not have a mind broadened with respect to suchness . . This difference arises because Hearers and Solitary Realizers strive to abandon only the afflictions (the obstructions to liberation], and cognizing a mere abbreviation of the meaning of such ness is sufficient for that. Mahayanists are intent on abandoning the obstructions to omniscience, and for that it is necessary to have a very broadened mind of wisdom opened to suchness. 25 The Dalai Lama's introduction in Ta ntra in Tibet, p.55. 26 'khor ba, samsiira. 27 byang chub kyi sems, bodhichitta. 28 Tantra in Tibet, pp.98-99."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"480 The Kiilachakra Tantra: Notes 29 phar phyin kyi theg pa, pnramitayiina and sn8ags kyi thegs pa, mantrayima.

Note also that the goddesses surround­ing Kalachakra and Vishvamata in the mandala of great bliss are called Shaktis (nus rna), a term otherwise not used, to my knowledge, in Buddhist tantra. The borrow­ing of terminology from other systems was perhaps an effort to acclimate non-Buddhists to a Buddhist tradition. 91 This paragraph is drawn from Bu-don's Extensive Expla­nation of (Anandagarbha's) \"Rite of the Vajradhiitu Mandala, Giving Rise To All Va;ras\": Wish-Granting Jewel (rdo rje dbyings kyi dkyil 'khor gyi cho ga rdo rje thams cad 'byung ba zhes by a ba 'i rgya cher bshad pa yid bzhin gyi nor bu), Collected Works, (New Delhi: International Academy of Indian Culture, 1966), volume 11, 190-.5-191.2. 92 The Apte Sanskrit-English dictionary identifies the femi­nine form of this word, shiilabhanjikii, as a courtesan, and thus, perhaps, these are attendants of the goddesses. 93 These are demi-gods; they are called \"semi-humans\" probably because they look enough like humans that one might wonder whether they are humans.

For very interesting discussions of initiation in relation to rebirth, see Mircea Eliade, Rites And Symbols Of Initiation, The Mysteries of Birth and Re­birth . (New York: Harper and Row, 1965). In his introduc­tion (xiii-xiv), Eliade says: Initiatory death provides the clean slate on which will be written the successive revelations whose end is the formation of a new man ... This new life is conceived as the true human existence, for it is open to the values of spirit .. All the rites of rebirth or resurrection, and the sym­bols that they imply, indicate that the novice has attained to another mode of existence, inaccessible to those who have not undergone the initiatory ordeals, who have not tasted death . Initiatory death is indispensible for the beginning of spiritual life. Its function must be understood in rela­tion to what it prepares: birth to a higher mode of being. Here also, the dissolution of all ordinary appearance in a manner that mimics dying is necessary for rebirth on new principles. About the new birth, Eliade (xiv) says: The initiatory new birth is not natural, though it is sometimes expressed in obstetric symbols. This birth requires rites instituted by the Supernatural Beings; hence it is a divine work, created by the power and will of those Beings; it belongs, not to nature (in the modern, secularized sense of the term), but to sacred"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"488 The Kiilachakra Ta ntra: Notes history. The second, initiatory birth does not repeat the first, biological birth. To attain the initiate's mode of being demands knowing realities that are not a part of nature but of biography of the Supernatural Beings, hence of the sacred history preserved in the myths. Here in Great Vehicle Buddhism, however, the know­ledge requires is of the natural state of things without the distortions of ignorance and the other afflictive emotions. Thus, it seems to me that the initiatory birth does indeed repeat the biological birth but within knowledge of the mode of being of phenomena, such that subsequent life is formed, not out of distorted knowledge of nature, but out of distortionless knowledge of the nature of things. It is not, therefore, a mere repetition but one within new knowledge of the ultimate and conventional natures of mental and physical phenomena. Knowledge of such reality is not part of ordinary life, and the new mode of being as known in deity yoga does indeed require pas­sage to a new, sacred mode of manifestation, but the realities known through initiation are fundamental to ordinary life, albeit unknown. The Kalachakra initiation accomplishes \"passage from the profane to a transcendent state\", as Eliade (p.104) says in his chapter entitled \"Patterns of Initiation in Higher Religions\". In its highest form, it also accomplishes pas­sage from profane distortion to the most ·ordinary state, the fundamental innate mind of clear light, naturally latent in all experience but needing to be made manifest. In this sense, the sacred or divine life is at the very essence of the profane, made profane only by distortion. 108 Similarly, the term \"compassion\" (snying rje, karul'fii) is sometimes used in Highest Yoga Tantra additionally to refer to \"bliss\", but this does not cancel out its other meani�g as the wish that all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. Karu'Jii is etymologized as \"stopping bliss\" (bde 'gog) by adding an anusvara (�) to the first letter k, making kam, which means \"bliss\" (bde ba) and taking runa (not found in the Apte dictionary) as meaning \"stopping\" ('gog pa).

This explanation is shared by all four sets of tantras, but from the specific viewpoint of Highest Yoga Tantra, compassion protecting migrators can be con­sidered the wisdom of great bliss. This interpretation is devised in terms of a contextual etymology of the Sanskrit word for 'compassion', karuna, as 'stopping pleasure'. When anyone generates compassion- the inability to bear sentient beings' suffering without acting to relieve it, pleasure, peacefulness, and relax­ation are temporarily stopped. Thus, in Highest Yoga the word 'compassion' (karuna) is designated to stop­ping the pleasure of the emission of the vital essence and refers to the wisdom of great bliss (mahilsukha).

Newland of the University of Virginia pointed out in a colloquium, according to Ge-luk-ba explanations, those Bodhisattvas who have the most compassion are most capable of experiencing the great bliss of Highest Yoga Tantra. Consider also the term \"the path that has an essence of emptiness and compassion\" (slang nyid snying rv snying po can gyi lam) [se Nagarjuna's Precious Garland, stanza 396, for something similar], which is interpreted in four ways. It is interpreted in a manner common to the Perfec­tion Vehicle as the path of the realization of the emptiness of inherent existence and of the compassion that is the wish that sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering - these two aspects affecting each other but not present in the same consciousness. It is interpreted in a manner common to the three lower tantras as the deity yoga in which the ascertainment factor of the consciousness ascertains the absence of inherent exis­tence and the appearance factor altruistically appears as a divine body -the two factors of wisdom and method thereby being present in one consciousness. It is inter­preted in a manner common with all Highest Yoga Tantras as the exalted wisdom of undifferentiable bliss and emptiness - a fusion of a bliss consciousness and a wis­dom realizing the absence of inherent existence. In an interpretation exclusive to the Kalachakra system, it is interpreted as the undifferentiable entity of empty form (form empty of, that is, without, material particles) and supreme immutable bliss. From the viewpoint of the Kalachakra system, all four interpretations are acceptable; it is not that just because the term has a meaning exclu­sive to the Kalachakra Tantra, it is limited to that meaning in the Kalachakra system. 109 See Tsong-ka-pa, Yoga of Tibet, pp.47, 58-59. 110 For mention of the nature, aspect, and function of the offerings, see Practice In The Manner Of The Very Con­densed Clear Realization Of The Supreme Superior, The Ocean Of Conquerors (jinasamudra) (phags mchog rgyal ba"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Notes to the Introduction 49il rgya mtsho'i mngong rtogs shin tu bsdus pa'i tshul du t�yam$ su len pa). by Gung-tang Gon-chok-den-bay-droh-may (gung thang dkon mchog bstan pa'i sgron me, 1762-1823), Collected Works of Gun-than dkon-mchog bstan-pa'i sgron-me, Vol. 7, (Ngawang Gelek Demo, 1975), 226.3� 228.4; my translation of this was distributed at the Ji.na· samudra initiation by the Dalai Lama in Los Angeles .in 1984. 111 These identifications are from Nga-wang-bel-den (ngag dbang dpal/dan, 1791-?), ll/umination of the Texts ofTantra, Presentation of the Ground and Paths of the Four Great Secret Tantra Sets (gsang chen rgyud sde bzhi'i sa lam gyi mam bzhag rgyud gzhung gsa/ byed), (rgyud smad par khang edition, no other data), 79.2-79.3. 111a In the conduct initiation, the sense powers are paired not in accordance with their respective objects but in accor· dance with the lineage of the deities that represent them such that deities of the same lineage are coupled.

Turner, among many other points, speaks of the potential of these inter-transitional states (p. 97): Liminality may perhaps be regarded as the Nay to all positive structural assertions, but as in some sense the source of them all, and, more than that, as a realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and relations may arise. As we have seen, in the Kalachakra initiation, .the stu­dents offer everything of value to the lama/Kalachakra, then dissolve everything, including themselves, in emptiness, out of which they re-appear in new altruisti­cally directed, validly founded, dynamic being. The liminal period of disappearance in emptiness is indeed a period of \"pure possibility\" read for \"novel configura­tions of ideas and relations\". The dissolution into empti­ness evinces a principle emphasized by Turner (pp.98-99): A further structurally negative characteristic of transi­tional beings is that they have nothing. They have no status, property, insignia, secular clothing, rank, kin­ship position, nothing to demarcate them structurally from their fellows. The situation is, therefore, a mixture of extreme poverty and richness of potential; Turner finds such ambiguity and paradox (p.97) to be integral to the transitional state of the initiant.
