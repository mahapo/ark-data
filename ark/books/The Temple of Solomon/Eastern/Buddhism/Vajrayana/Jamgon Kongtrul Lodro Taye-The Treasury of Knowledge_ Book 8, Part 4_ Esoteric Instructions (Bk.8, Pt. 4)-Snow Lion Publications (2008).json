Eighty-four mahasiddhas and other adepts appeared as well. Treatises, esoteric instructions, and other teach-ings proliferated. The benefi t to beings was incalculable. Not only that, innumerable scholars and adepts also appeared in Tibet, the Land of Snows. In upholding the doctrine, some of them adhered to the exclu-sive esoteric instructions of their own traditions, and some of them prop-agated the dharma through impartial teaching traditions, their activity of training disciples depending on whether or not the time was right. Among those, Jamgön Kongtrul Yönten Gyatso [Lodrö Tayé] was pre-eminent among the scholar-adepts of later times in his work of spreading the impartial (rimé) doctrine and in his enlightened activity. In general, his Five Great Treasuries, and in particular the great treatise, the treasury called The Encompassment of All Knowledge, bring together and set forth in one place the intended meaning of all the source texts and esoteric instructions without bias or partiality. In his own autobiography this great scholar-adept says:Previously, Lama Ngédön had insisted that I write a treatise on the three vows. He said that if I did so he would write the com-mentary. But everyone has done a treatise on the three vows, and I thought that if I were to write a treatise it should be one with a more comprehensive format that would help people who have not studied much. So in between meditation ses-sions I had been writing the root verses of The Encompassment of All Knowledge, a treatise on the three trainings. Later, when I showed this to my lord guru, he gave me great encouragement, TOK_8-4_Final.indd 9TOK_8-4_Final.indd 97/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTOK_8-4_Final.indd 10TOK_8-4_Final.indd 107/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"foreword \u0003 11saying, “This has certainly come from the gurus’ blessings and the power of the ̃›kinıs opening up your energy channels.

Of these forty chapters, the present work comes from Book Eight on the training in meditative absorption; it is the fourth chapter called A Detailed Presentation of the Process of Meditation in Vajray›na Emphasiz-ing Esoteric Instructions. There are nine sections: the esoteric instructions of the Eight Great Chariots of the Practice Lineage—Early Nyingma, Kadam, Lamdré, Marpa Kagyu, Shangpa Kagyu, Zhijé, Jordruk, and Dorjé Sumgyi Nyendrup—and a supplement on the fragments and branches of guidance systems. Here, the comprehensive meaning of the esoteric instructions of each of those schools is presented in a few, intel-ligible words. Now this chapter has been translated in its entirety into English by Lotsawa Sarah Harding, with the generous and dedicated sponsorship of the Tsadra Foundation. This will have an extraordinarily benefi cial eff ect on the Buddha’s doctrine in general, and especially for sentient beings. I therefore encourage you to study it and to carefully practice as best you can.Written by the one named Thrangu Tulku in between the sessions of teaching an explanation of omniscient Dolpopa’s Mountain Dharma, Ocean of Defi nitive Meaning in the mountain ravines of Colorado.—July, 2007TOK_8-4_Final.indd 11TOK_8-4_Final.indd 117/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"TOK_8-4_Final.indd 12TOK_8-4_Final.indd 127/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PREFACEKhyabjé Kalu Rinpoché visited Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1986 to con-secrate the Bodhi Stupa that had been constructed at his dharma center. Many of his lamas and students were gathered for the occasion, as well as visiting teachers and the general public. It was a joyful reunion for many of us who were scattered in the ten directions and rarely had the opportunity to come together. Although in no position to represent anyone, I nevertheless found myself inspired by the auspicious occasion to off er “our” everlasting translation service in whatever way he saw fi t. I felt that much of the talent that Kalu Rinpoché himself had fostered in his students was not being put to use, and that naturally they were looking elsewhere for ways to be of service. But, I said, “we” would rather work for him, even—or especially—after he was gone. He simply nodded. I thought, how easy it is to express my deep gratitude in this way. Later during that same tour, Rinpoché did a radio interview in San Francisco in which he announced that he had formed a committee to translate the entire Buddhist canon! When he returned to the dharma center his eyes were sparkling with mischief and he demanded, “Now how many people know?” That was how it began. Rinpoché bestowed the ambitious name of “The International Buddhist Translation Committee” (Dragyur Dzam-ling Kunkhyab) and sought to gather translators, scholars, and medita-tion masters of all Tibetan Buddhist traditions to work together. Luckily, he was talked down from the original idea of translating the Buddhist Canon, and chose instead the masterpiece by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé, The Treasury of Knowledge. Hardly less daunting, it has taken many translators many years to begin to present an approximation of this great work. It started in Bodhgaya, the site of the Buddha’s enlightenment, with three-month TOK_8-4_Final.indd 13TOK_8-4_Final.indd 137/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgetranslation conferences in 1987 and again in 1988. After that, Rinpoché decided to have the work continue throughout the year at his monastery in Sonada, Darjeeling. There, people were to “translate during the day and meditate on the nature of mind at night.” After some years only the hardiest remained, eventually producing the fi rst three books in the series. Kalu Rinpoché passed away in 1989 without seeing the fulfi llment of his wish, just as he had warned on many, many occasions. Now the time frame seemed to stretch infi nitely into the future, and most of us had other lives to lead in order to sur-vive. Then Kalu Rinpoché’s worthy lineage successor, Bokar Rinpo-ché, Karma Ngedon Chokyi Lodrö, took up the cause. He hesitated to change Kalu Rinpoché’s game plan in any way, but the urgency called for practicality. At a gathering in his monastery in Mirik, on the occasion of con-ferring the Shangpa Kagyu transmissions at the request of the young incarnation of Kalu Rinpoché, Bokar Rinpoché urged the translators to complete this work that had been so dear to his guru. He feared that at this rate it might not even be completed within the lifetimes of the very translators to whom it had been entrusted by Kalu Rinpoché. With the generous and timely support of the Tsadra Foundation, a new phase of work began, with individual translators working on indi-vidual sections of the Treasury in their own homes and with all the amenities (such as electricity). Now with new direction, the remaining sections have been adopted by able translators and are well under way. With Bokar Rinpoché all but insisting, and dear friends at Tsadra Foundation pointedly encouraging, I rejoined the Treasury project after many years of other work. Of the available sections, I chose the fourth part of Book Eight in the meditation section: the esoteric instructions of the eight (and counting) practice lineages of Tibet. For obvious reasons I thought this would be the most interesting and exciting. It serves me right, succumbing to the lure of the mystical. It might as well have been the Buddhist canon. It was too easy to underestimate how much information Jamgön Kongtrul could pack into 189 pages, and to underestimate the depth and breadth of these esoteric practices. In truth, each of the sections in this current book deserves a separate treatment by a scholar-practitioner specialized in the particular lineage, with years of practice and study behind her.

The multi-layered complex of philosophi-cal and contemplative practice opens up into a distinct spiritual path for everyone. This vast wealth of eclectic knowledge is the context that supports the profound teachings of tantra, or esoteric Buddhism. These teachings are said to off er a quick and easy way to discover one’s own nature through a variety of curiously eff ective techniques. The esoteric or secret quality of the tantras, however, is only revealed by direct contact with masters who embody an awakened state of mind. Then the practi-tioner sees directly the living teaching, and is in turn seen by the guru in his or her unique capacities and needs. It is this relationship that powers the development of spiritual growth. For that reason the direct instruc-tions transmitted within such relationships are the most prized of all the Buddha’s doctrines. Although the immediacy of these directives in the intimate situation of guru and disciple carries the real impact, the most precious of the esoteric instructions from the greatest of the masters have been recorded and passed down through successions of teachers, who have further imbued these enduring teachings with the power of their TOK_8-4_Final.indd 17TOK_8-4_Final.indd 177/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeown realizations. It is the records of such teachings that are described in this volume. Esoteric Instructions is one small section of Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé’s Encompassment of All Knowledge (Shes bya kun khyab) and his own commentary to it, The Infi nite Ocean of Knowledge (Shes bya mtha’ yas pa’i rgya mtsho). Together they are known widely as The Treasury of Knowledge (Shes bya mdzod). At three volumes, it was the shortest of what became known as his Five Great Treasuries (mDzod chen lnga), massive collections of Buddhist teachings that he sought out or com-posed during his long and astonishingly productive lifetime (1813-19001) in Eastern Tibet.According to the opening verse above—the requisite author’s resolve to complete the work2—Jamgön Kongtrul’s intention was to make the range of Buddhist subjects easily accessible to everyone. Buddhism in Tibet had been developing since at least the eighth century, and by the nineteenth century had grown into a vast and intricate web of philoso-phies and practices, any portion of which required a lifetime of study to master. Kongtrul felt that too much was at stake, too much could be lost, if these were available only to the scholarly elite. However, in creating a simple and intelligible work with the less than modest aim of encompassing all knowledge, he apparently underestimated his own “intellectual capacity.” Although such declarations of incompetence are standard rhetoric in Tibetan compositions, Kongtrul’s frequent refrain suggests a humble genius. His humility and devotion for other masters and literally all Buddhist teachings were among his remarkable qualities. It was the vast scope of his knowledge, however, and his truly bound-less intellect (the meaning of “Lodrö Tayé”) that must have made The Treasury of Knowledge seem to him a short and clear work for the average person. Some readers may not have such a perspective. It started simply enough as a request from another lama to compose a short treatise (Skt. Ÿ›stra) to present the three sets of vows (trısa ̇vara) in the Tibetan Buddhist system: those of personal liberation (pr›timok ̋a), of awakening mind (bodhicitta), and of the awareness holder (vidy›dhara). Ethical behavior is indeed the foundation of all Buddhist practice and has been since the time of the Buddha. This particular threefold configuration standardized in Tibet refl ects the threefold development in the Buddhist teachings of the elders (Pali, therav›da), the great vehicle (Skt. mah›y›na), and the indestructible vehicle (vajray›na), one of many TOK_8-4_Final.indd 18TOK_8-4_Final.indd 187/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 19arrangements that attempt to systematize the doctrine. Tibetan Buddhists are known for practicing all three approaches together on the spiritual path. A treatise on this subject could conceivably encompass the entire path, and in fact there are many such texts by other great Tibetan mas-ters.3 It is partially for that reason that Kongtrul decided to expand the basic format of his composition to cover another threefold scheme that has been present since the earliest times of Buddhism: that of the three higher trainings in ethics (Ÿıla), meditative absorption (sam›dhi ), and wisdom (prajñ›). These three categories comprise all Buddhist doctrine, as represented in the earliest canon of teachings, called the Three Baskets (tripi ̨aka). Kongtrul stated these intentions in his autobiography:4Previously, Lama Ngédön had insisted that I write a treatise on the three [levels of] vows. He said that if I did so he would write the commentary. But everyone has done a treatise on the three vows, and I thought that if I were to write a treatise it should be one with a more comprehensive format that would help people who have not studied much. So in between medi-tation sessions I had been writing the root verses to The Encom-passment of All Knowledge, a treatise on the three trainings. Jamgön Kongtrul kept to this plan, as indicated in the full title of the root verses: The Encompassment of All Knowledge: A Treatise That Eff ectively Presents the Three Trainings, A Treasury of Precious Scripture Compiled from the Approaches of All Vehicles.5 He first composed the root verses (k›rik›) in the classical Indian style, making it easy to memorize for pedagogical purposes, but diffi cult to understand without a commen-tary. These root verses, written in lines of nine syllables each, run for 154 pages in the modern three-volume edition.6 Kongtrul wrote them while on retreat in 1863 at his hermitage of Kunzang Dechen Ösal Ling, near the great Kagyu monastery of Palpung in Kham, Eastern Tibet.7 Though he did innumerable such retreats, his later life seems to have become ever more engaged with satisfying the spiritual needs of patrons, monastics, and laypeople, and his later collections were created amidst a fl urry of such activities. One fi nds him complaining of increasing obscuration in practice during this time. In addition, local war and power politics were threatening all around him.8 Yet apparently the focus aff orded him by meditation retreat did enable him to successfully encompass all knowl-TOK_8-4_Final.indd 19TOK_8-4_Final.indd 197/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeedge into 154 pages of short verse. Kongtrul was perhaps still hoping that Lama Ngédon9 would write the commentary, but when he showed his work to his close associate and guru, the great master Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo (1820-1892),10 things changed: Later, when I showed this to my lord guru, he gave me great encouragement, saying, “This has certainly come from the gurus’ blessings and the power of the ̃›kinıs opening up your energy channels. Therefore, make this Treasury of Knowledge the fi rst of your fi ve great treasuries. You absolutely must write your own commentary to it.”11Kongtrul began the commentary in 1864 during a three-month writ-ing session aff orded him by the abbot Lama Tashi Özer.12 He resumed work in 1865, all of this during the most troubled period in the Dergé district.13 At this time he had decided to gather together his collection of hidden treasure teachings, or terma,14 and also call that by the ambi-tious name of “treasury,” in accordance with Khyentsé’s prophecy. This prophecy would eventually be more than fulfi lled as the other treasuries followed in due order: The Treasury of Kagyu Mantra, The Treasury of Precious Treasure Teachings, The Treasury of Precious Key Instructions, and The Extraordinary Treasury or its expanded form called The Treasury of Extensive Teachings.15 Thus there are fi ve (or six) treasuries, as well as innumerable other writings by Jamgön Kongtrul, altogether compris-ing more than ninety volumes. These and similar collections formed the basis for extensive religious ceremonies in which the blessings and permission to engage in the practices were transmitted through reading and empowerment (abhi ̋eka) to large gatherings over many months. There are several good surveys of the treasuries in English,16 although The Treasury of Knowledge is the fi rst to have been considered for transla-tion in its entirety.17 Writing a treatise in the formal Buddhist sense is a much more demanding enterprise than, say, just writing an introduction to one. Treatises are meant to clarify and explain the direct teachings of the Buddha, not to be one’s own creative ideas. In that sense, calling this treasury a treatise was an apt choice in regard to Kongtrul’s aspirations for clarity and accessibility. He carefully followed all the requisites for treatise composition, as he documented clearly right at the beginning.18 TOK_8-4_Final.indd 20TOK_8-4_Final.indd 207/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 21The Infi nite Ocean of Knowledge is written in the style of a word com-mentary, in which each word or phrase of the root verses is expanded and elucidated by explication. The commentary follows precisely the structure of the verses. An outline is also imposed on it, one that is not necessarily obvious in the original verses. In fact, one often wonders in Tibetan literature of this kind if the structure is premeditated or created afterwards. In the case of The Infi nite Ocean of Knowledge, the basic out-line is beautifully symmetrical, with ten “books” (Tib. gnas), each one containing four “parts” (Tib. skabs), usually progressing from the general to the more specifi c or profound. Thus, although a treatise should not explicitly contain personal opinions, one could say that location is every-thing. Kongtrul mentions that there are ten books to be equal in number to the ten perfections, and lays them out in a logical progression.19 The interesting choice of the Tibetan term gnas, “abode” or “dwelling place,” for chapter20 reminds one of another great prototypical Indian treatise often quoted by Kongtrul: The Mah›y›na Highest Continuum Treatise.21 There, the work is divided into seven “vajra feet” (vajrapada), which the Tibetan translator chose to call immutable abodes (Tib. rdo rje gnas). The term is glossed as “a dwelling place of that which is realized, which is like a vajra,” because it is diffi cult to penetrate and only known through one’s own awareness. “The dwelling place is the words; the vajra is the meaning that dwells in the words.”22 The signifi cance of the order in that treatise is itself a profound teaching. In any case, much can be learned from the outline of the current text, as with all of Kongtrul’s treasuries.Book I deals with cosmology according to various Buddhist systems and the causes of cyclic existence (sa ̇s›ra). Book II concerns the advent of the Buddha, his life and enlightenment. Book III is about the Bud-dha’s doctrine, and Book IV concerns the spread of that doctrine, fi rst in India and then in Tibet. Book V covers the three levels of ethical dis-cipline. This is the fi rst of the three higher trainings, and forms the core of the treasury and fulfi lls its original intention. Book VI focuses on the topics of study that are undertaken at the outset of the spiritual path and includes secular areas of knowledge as well as all of the religious vehicles, culminating in an exposition of tantra. This leads into the higher trainings of wisdom in Book VII. Wisdom (pr›jña) is normally listed as the third of the three higher trainings after meditation, but here it is presented fi rst as the means for gaining certainty in the Bud-dhist view so that this may support actual meditation. It is in Book VIII TOK_8-4_Final.indd 21TOK_8-4_Final.indd 217/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethat all the various methods for meditation are presented in due order, beginning with calm abiding (Ÿamatha) and higher insight (vipaŸyana) in part one, then meditation in the philosophical vehicles in part two, and then the elements of tantric practice as they are presented in the Buddhist tantras in part three. Part four of Book VIII is on the esoteric instructions (Tib. man ngag) of tantric practice, and is translated in full in the present volume. Book IX concerns the paths and levels that are traversed during these studies and practices, and Book X describes the fi nal fruition.After the publication of the Treasury of Knowledge, Kongtrul bestowed the reading transmission to a group of about twenty lamas, incarnate masters, and scholars, including his master Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo. This was one of only four times that this transmission occurred.23 It took about ten days, combining an oral explanation with the reading trans-mission of both the root text and its commentary. After the concluding ceremonies, Khyentsé Rinpoché praised it and called it “a treatise for the ages.”24 And so it would seem. Though encyclopedic in scope, The Treasury of Knowledge is a true trea-tise and not technically an encyclopedia.25 The root text is the closest thing to an index by which one could locate a subject, and the preferred method to facilitate that was simply to memorize the root verses and then be able to call up the commentary.26 The question of the uses and usefulness of this text in respect to the current book on esoteric instruc-tions will be examined in the following sections of the introduction.This BookIn the progression of forty parts within ten books, the groundwork for the vast and profound subject of tantric practice is laid in the fourth part of Book VI, which concerns the subjects of study and presents the theoretical bases of practice. A thorough reading of that section, which has been translated as Systems of Buddhist Tantra, or at least a working knowledge of the subject matter, is truly a requirement for appreciat-ing the two parts on actual tantric practice. All of the teachings pre-sented in The Treasury of Knowledge are of fundamental importance, but the special teachings that developed in Tibet were based in the tantras and became known as the vajray›na in Sanskrit (Tib. rdo rje theg pa, TOK_8-4_Final.indd 22TOK_8-4_Final.indd 227/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 23“indestructible vehicle”) or secret mantra (Tib. gsang sngags). This is the Tibetan specialty and the sole subject of the current work. Despite his best intentions to simplify the subject matter, Jamgön Kongtrul never-theless assumes a great familiarity on the part of his readers.Book VIII gets right down to the subject matter of meditation, with the last two parts specifi cally concerning tantric meditation. These two parts are divided according to the sources. The fi rst concerns teachings derived from actual tantras said to have originated with the Buddha in India, and is translated as The Elements of Tantric Practice.27 The second, presented here, emphasizes the salient points or esoteric instructions. Basically, these are records of personal teachings by masters, either of Indian or Tibetan origin, that simplify tantric or other meditations by providing pertinent examples and helpful hints to the disciples, based on the master’s own experience. Although originally oral in nature, they have been codifi ed and passed down through specifi c lineages from teacher to student, or sometimes directly in visionary experiences.These have also been called “key” or “pith” instructions. The Tibetan term is man ngag (pronounced “mé-ngak”), which was used to translate the Sanskrit word ›mn›ya. Sometimes man ngag was also used as a trans-lation of upadeŸa, though this is more properly gdams ngag in Tibetan. This suggests that very often these two terms are interchangeable, and yet it also raises the question of their distinctions, if any, as genres of literature. In Sanskrit, ›mn›ya is defi ned as “sacred tradition, sacred texts handed down by repetition; that which is to be remembered or studied or learnt by heart; received doctrine.” It derives from › plus the root mn›: “to utter, mention, allege; to cite, quote, to commit to memory, hand down in sacred texts.” Similarly, upadeŸa is given as “pointing out to, reference to; specifi cations, instruction, teaching, information, advice, prescription, original enunciation,” and so on. It derives from the prefi x upa plus the root diŸ: “to point out to, to indicate,” and so on.28 The distinctions are not noteworthy, so a look at the Tibetan usage might be helpful. According to contemporary Tibetan teachers, the two are often con-sidered synonymous.29 It does seem, however, that man ngag tends to have a specifi c sense of directives that are intimately geared toward the person. The whole phrase would literally be “uncommon” or “extraor-dinary speech” (Tib. thun mong ma yin pa’i ngag), with “uncommon” referring to the disciples.

Here are some examples: Instructions in visualization techniques often state that one should instantly recall the deity (Tib. skad cig dran rdzogs). But how does one really suddenly see a deity manifest in emptiness? The esoteric instruction tells us, “like a fi sh jumping out of water.” Or how should one perceive all phenomena? “As refl ections in a mirror.”31 In some sense, all instructions can be man ngag, as in this example from another source: “to make milk tea, pour the milk in your cup fi rst so that it will blend well.”32 This example brings up the question of whether such directives are actually “esoteric.” This word, from the Greek for “inner,” refers to ideas or doctrines intended for a select few, with a secondary meaning of “secret.”33 Following this line of inquiry, man ngag were described in interviews as secret in the very sense of being uncommon and for a select few, though not in a sense of being forbidden. The word therefore seems to be quite useful here. In the case of this book, the foregoing defi nitions are particularly appropriate since the teachings presented here assume a background of basic instruction that could then be individually aug-mented by esoteric instructions.34 The transmission of such instructions fl ows through specifi c lineages (though they often intersect), so Kongtrul chose to arrange them into eight sets according to a system that he made quite famous, that is, the Eight Chariots of the Practice Lineages of Tibet. Thus each chapter of the present book is self-contained and not progressive as are other books within The Treasury. There is no particular hierarchy in the order of pre-sentation, which is solely chronological.35 Nevertheless, this very arrange-ment—that of displaying all the lineage teachings side by side, equal but separate and distinct—is a signifi cant methodology in itself, and one that defi nes all of Kongtrul’s great collections. This signifi cance is inextricable from Kongtrul’s acceptance and appreciation of all Buddhist teachings without bias or contention. His treasuries, and those of other contemporary masters such as Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo, became the literary basis for what has been termed the nonsectarian movement, or rimé (Tib. ris med), in the nineteenth century. The text translated in Esoteric Instructions may be Kongtrul’s earliest expression of this style; one Tibetologist has mentioned that The Treasury of Knowledge “appears TOK_8-4_Final.indd 24TOK_8-4_Final.indd 247/10/09 1:59:00 PM7/10/09 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 25to be the earliest statement of nonsectarian thought.”36 However, other large collections of teachings were certainly on the scene at that time, and some were even included in Kongtrul’s treasuries.37 It is the impartial and comprehensive scope of Kongtrul’s work and his collaboration with others of similar mind that is notable and that has earned him the reputation as the founder of a movement. This simple methodology of collection and compilation without judgment is, in my opinion, Jamgön Kongtrul’s real contribution to the so-called nonsec-tarian movement. In light of the near-destruction in modern times of the Tibetan culture and its literary heritage, this work has been vital. It has meant that these vast collections of works have been preserved and are now available for future generations. But rimé was not a reactionary alternative set in opposition to other biased factions, as it has often been portrayed in modern scholarship. Why did Kongtrul create these massive collections—even the relatively short selection found in Esoteric Instructions—that no one person could hope to practice in their entirety? What is the connection with sectarian-ism? How should we approach these practices? These questions will be explored below. I will not attempt to summarize the actual meditation practices presented in each lineage, for that has been masterfully done by Kongtrul himself. The fact that it is already a summary and that Kong-trul only gives enough information for a general sense of each lineage, and certainly not enough to engage in any of the practices, only begs the foregoing questions. Nevertheless, I have tried to help the reader with endnotes as needed, since just being translated into the English language is not necessarily suffi cient. A brief historical overview of each lineage based on an earlier section of The Treasury of Knowledge (Book IV, Part 3) is presented as an introduction to each of the chapters. A Brief History of EverythingEsoteric Instructions is organized according to what Kongtrul calls the Eight Great Chariots of the Practice Lineage (Tib. sgrub brgyud shing rta chen po brgyad). This seems to be the fi rst occurrence of an organizing principle that he would use many times over. To understand his inten-tions we could look at another of his treasuries with the same format: The Treasury of Precious Key Instructions. It diff ers from Esoteric Instructions in that it is a collection of actual instructions gathered impartially from TOK_8-4_Final.indd 25TOK_8-4_Final.indd 257/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeother sources, rather than his own summary of them. Conceivably one could even use Esoteric Instructions as a kind of descriptive index by which to then locate the actual lineage instructions in The Treasury of Precious Key Instructions. Kongtrul created a very extensive record or catalogue of contents (Tib. dkar chag) that is appended to the treasury, entitled Catalogue of the Treasury of Precious Instructions, a Collection of the Ripening and Liberating Essence of the Eight Great Chariots of the Practice Lineages: An Ocean of Auspicious Renown.38 In that text, he sets the cosmic stage by fi rst quoting the Net of Magical Manifestation of MañjuŸrı: 39The buddha is without beginning or end;The original buddha is without bias.This is the fi rst occurrence of the term rimé (Tib. ris med) in this text, and our fi rst hint that it has a much broader meaning than “nonsec-tarian,” if it even means that at all. It is followed by a description of the unifi ed state of reality that manifests all variety without restriction. After a summary of the sources of the dharma in India and the great masters and adepts who “mainly approached through the three meth-ods of explication, debate, and composition to maintain the scriptural doctrine,” Kongtrul introduces the classifi cation of the main sources for those teachings as they were assimilated into Tibet:Here in Tibet, there were the ten great pillars that upheld the lineage of explanation, and their followers, who maintain the explanations, and the lineage holders of the chariots of the great practice lineages, who principally engaged the excellent path of practice and thereby maintained the victorious doctrine.40The ten great pillars that upheld the lineage of explanation (Tib. bshad brgyud ’degs pa’i ka chen bcu)41 is a parallel construction and comple-mentary idea to what had originally been called “the eight great pillars that upheld the lineages of practice” (Tib. sgrub brgyud ’degs pa’i ka chen brgyad). In tracing this history, Kongtrul indicates his earliest source for the eight-chariot idea in a brief explanation of the way in which this doctrine came from India to Tibet:42 TOK_8-4_Final.indd 26TOK_8-4_Final.indd 267/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 27In general, here in these snowy ranges, there appeared many major and minor traditions drawn from the long traditions of the practice lineages. However, the main ones that can be condensed by type or that have gained a footing are known as the Eight Great Chariots. As was said by the great learned adept Prajñ›raŸmi:43 Prophesied by the Victor, the lord of beings in the snowy land, [Who taught] exclusively the single doctrine of the full intention For his Royal Highness the ruler,Is the second Teacher in these snowy ranges.The great editor-translator Bagor Vairocana,The heir of the victors, Up›saka Dromtön,The great scholar-adept Khyungpo Naljor,The great bilingual Lama Drokmi,The mighty yogin, honorable lord Marpa,The Indian Dampa who dwells on levels of attainment,The translator Gyijo, and the scholar-adept OrgyenpaAre the eight great pillars that upheld the practice lineages in the North.Coming perfectly from the glorious Buddha Vajradhara,Eight great pillars of practice lineages in this snowy region Are the legacy of former adepts.Those who desire freedom should follow their paths.44Somewhere along the way, eight pillars became eight chariots, and the discussion now generally concerns the teaching lineages rather than the specifi c individuals who inspired them. In Esoteric Instructions, as else-where, Kongtrul enumerates these eight chariots as (1) Nyingma, (2) Kadam, (3) Lamdré, (4) Marpa Kagyu, (5) Shangpa Kagyu, (6) Zhijé and its branch of Chöd, (7) Dorjé Naljor Druk (or Jordruk), and (8) Dorjé Sumgyi Nyendrup. He does not list Lamdré (the Path with Its Result) as Sakya, even though that teaching is now largely transmitted within that tradition, nor Dorjé Naljor Druk (Six-Branch Vajrayoga) as K›lacakra, from which it derives. Nor does he assign Dorjé Sumgyi Nyendrup (Approach and Attainment of the Three Vajras) to the Marpa Kagyu, even though its originator, Orgyenpa, was a lineage holder in that tradi-tion. It is clear that this framework concerns only the crucial meditation TOK_8-4_Final.indd 27TOK_8-4_Final.indd 277/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeteachings themselves as they were transmitted from India through a long line of practitioners. It is not at all concerned with sects. That, of course, is why they are called practice lineages. If some of them were successful in being assimilated later in monastic centers and becoming sects in their own right, that is incidental to Kongtrul’s approach. Together, the ten pillars and the eight chariots form one way to classify and thereby cope with the amazing array of exegetical and practical instructions that bom-barded Tibet in the formative centuries of Buddhist assimilation. There were in fact many creative ways in which the Tibetans tried to classify the bounteous dharma that arrived on their snowy ranges. One might easily get the impression that, because the classifi cation systems with which we are now familiar are so revered and ubiquitous, they must have been inherited from India. However, textual evidence suggests that there was a “process of creative appropriation.”45 The classifi cation of tantras in particular, though such attempts certainly existed in India,46 was pursued with the special urgency of one culture trying to make sense of the relatively rapid infusion of another. The two well-known systems for classifying tantric ritual according to “vehicles” (y›na) or approaches—that is, the nine vehicles of the ancient Nyingma system and the four vehicles used by the other, new schools—were developed in Tibet according to doctrinal and ritualistic categories that made sense to Tibetans. Studies of early texts reveal that even these were not settled for perhaps centuries, and that there was originally a bewildering variety of systems.47The process of classifi cation did not end, however, in those early cen-turies. Another doxographic decision of considerable import was made by Buton Rinchen Drup (1290-1364) as he determined which Bud-dhist texts would be included in the Kangyur (translations of Buddha’s words) and the Tengyur (translations of treatises)—the so-called Tibetan Canon. A strict but arbitrary standard was imposed based on linguis-tics that excluded those tantras for which no Sanskrit original could be confi rmed.48 Many of the tantras most important to the Nyingma were thus left out, to be collected later by Ratna Lingpa (1403-1478) into an alternative canon, The Collected Tantras of Nyingma (sNying ma rgyud ’bum).49 These early decisions, though promoting the continuity of Bud-dhism in Tibet in a major way, contributed to tensions between sects. It is evident that the work of compilation was of utmost importance in determining the direction that Buddhism was to take in Tibet.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 28TOK_8-4_Final.indd 287/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 29From the second half of the fi fteenth century through the seventeenth century, changes in Central Tibet created another form of synthesis. The brilliant Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), founder of the Gelukpa lineage and himself an avid eclectic and systematizer, had placed great emphasis on monastic discipline and education. Giant monasteries, such as Sera, Dre-pung, and Ganden, grew up around Lhasa, where monks could pursue scholarship en masse. It also must have been signifi cant that the advent of xylographic printing occurred during this time, with Tsongkhapa overseeing the fi rst printing. To facilitate scholarship and streamline the subject matter of study, the great institutions developed manuals (Tib. yig cha) corresponding to the establishment of fi xed curricula. This was followed by a new genre called Collected Topics (Tib. bsdus grwa) writ-ten in actual debate format (Tib. tshad ma), which by then had become the primary methodology for gaining certainty of Buddhist subjects in those monastic colleges. On top of this, the Gelukpa monasteries also developed a hierarchical system of monastic degrees to validate scholastic achievement and perhaps to inspire scholarly ambitions.50 The end result was the creation of a unifi ed body of teachings that incorporated all the important elements of Indian Buddhist doctrine and a highly trained erudite monastic assembly able to defend these doctrines through rea-soning. It has sometimes been suggested that the stylized debate format became somewhat stultifying as a pedagogical tool, fostering memoriza-tion and repetition with little true inquiry. Whether or not that is so, one could perhaps say, along with one modern Gelukpa scholar who has fi rst-hand knowledge, Georges Dreyfus, that they “put little emphasis on the immediacy of experience, insisting instead on the truth of doctrines.”51Meanwhile, back at the highlands of Eastern Tibet, there were always some scholars who did value the immediacy of experience as well as the benefi ts of study. The work of collecting and commenting on medita-tions and yogic practices continued with masters such as Mikyö Dorjé (1507-1554), Padma Karpo (1527-1592), and the great T›ran›tha (1575-1635), who was a particular inspiration to Jamgön Kongtrul. All of these, of course, followed in the tradition of the masterful Nyingma writer of an earlier century, Longchenpa Rabjam Drimé Özer (1308-1363), who codifi ed the philosophical and practical applications of the Great Com-pletion (rdzogs chen)—the pinnacle of the nine-vehicle approach—into a cohesive system. All this academic commentary on the yogic tradi-tions prepared the way for the nineteenth-century renaissance in Eastern TOK_8-4_Final.indd 29TOK_8-4_Final.indd 297/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTibet. Kongtrul relies heavily on the work of such former masters and quotes or borrows from them extensively.The development of high scholasticism in Central Tibet that culmi-nated around the time of the establishment of Tibet as a country (1642) under the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, Ngawang Losang Gyatso (1617-1682), had a far-reaching impact on the rest of Tibet, partly due to political machinations. The Dalai Lama incarnations had a close association with the Gelukpa monasteries. Others who had not supported the rise of the central coalition were targeted and in some cases the monasteries with which they were associated were suppressed. For example, the Jonangpa sect associated with T›ran›tha, and so dear to Kongtrul, was banned outright, its monasteries converted to Geluk and its publications taken out of circulation. In this case, it was reportedly because of religious heresy, though it is clear that it was due more to the toxic mixture of politics in religion. Jonang monasteries survived in Eastern Tibet and are currently thriving, partly because the source texts were not actually destroyed and were later recovered. It seems even the most confi dent of factions could not bring themselves to defy the precepts against dis-respecting even suspicious dharma; fortunately superstition is stronger than suspicion.The emphasis on the particular expression of learning coupled with the lack of political support resulted in a decline of the non-Gelukpa schools during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This period is regarded as fraught with sectarian rivalries and elitist scholarship, all of it laced with power politics. It is often suggested by modern scholars that it was this sect-crazed environment that eventually led to the unbiased approach of Kongtrul and his contemporaries, who exemplifi ed inclu-siveness. Certainly these developments had an infl uence on them, and set an impressive example of how not to be. But in reading Kongtrul’s accounts of his own purposes and motivations, there is very little of an antagonistic character, and very much of a genuine devotion for all teachings and a concern to keep the Buddhist vow of tolerance. Such sectarian troubles are barely mentioned.In any case, it was in the second half of the nineteenth century that Jamgön Kongtrul and many other masters concurrently exhibited an incredibly open attitude to all teachings and shared a concern for their preservation. Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol (1781-1851) is an early example. His personal inspiration derived from the inseparable triad of Padmasam-TOK_8-4_Final.indd 30TOK_8-4_Final.indd 307/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 31bhava, AtıŸa, and Tsongkhapa, the sources of the Nyingma, Kadampa, and Gelukpa lineages, respectively, which would seem to indicate that his open-mindedness was more than alternative in nature.52 In Kham, the cluster of sublime masters that centered around the monasteries of Palpung, Dzongsar, Dzogchen and so forth includes such great names as Jamgön Kongtrul, Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo, Chokling Rinpoché, Dza Patrul, Zhenga, Mipam Gyatso, and many others.53 Whatever the confl uence of factors and infl uences were, an incredible energy and excitement occurred at this time and at this place in Eastern Tibet, with a proliferation of dharma activity that seems almost unprec-edented since the early days of Buddhist infl uence. In addition to the enormous compilations and compositions of Kongtrul and Khyentsé, there were revelations of hidden teachings of earth and mind, construc-tions of stupas and temples, intensive retreats, constant rituals, and vig-orous scholarship. Zhenga and Mipam Rinpoché especially contributed to a revival of scholarship that could stand equal but distinct from the great monasteries of Central Tibet, which had perhaps inspired them.54 They promoted an inclusive approach that bypassed sectarian dispute by returning to the study of source materials and commentaries rather than studious debate. This was presented as a return to the classical past when Buddhism was being introduced in the thrill of translation and study of original texts.55 Together, these attitudes and activities that were characterized by deliberate inclusiveness gathered a strength and momentum that moved the direction of Buddhism in Tibet. Thus, the “Rimé movement.”What Is Rimé Really?Although this approach has been contrasted and compared with the so-called Gelukpa synthesis, it is very diff erent from it in nature, and not only because of its focus on meditation practices. For one thing, rimé is not a synthesis at all. As the anthropologist Geoff rey Samuel has observed, the methodology and ideology served diff erent purposes:If Rimed [rimé] is considered as a synthesis, it is so in a quite diff erent manner from the Gelukpa position. Tsongk’apa and his successors sought to narrow down, to defi ne, to bring together in a single set of teachings all that was essential within TOK_8-4_Final.indd 31TOK_8-4_Final.indd 317/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTibetan Buddhism. Even the various new Tantric traditions were to be reduced as far as possible to a common framework. The Rimed approach was quite the opposite. All methods were to be gathered together and made available. Any one might contain the liberating potential appropriate to one or another student. Nor, as we have already seen, did the Rimed move-ment have any common philosophical standpoint.56 The development of the scholarly tradition that focused so intently on doctrine helped to systematize the teachings of the explanation lineages (Tib. bshad brgyud), but may have neglected the practice lineages (Tib. sgrub brgyud). This became the job of the great compilers of the rimé movement. Learning had been well served, but both learning and prac-tice together had always defi ned the ideal Buddhist. In the Catalogue of the Treasury of Precious Key Instructions, Jamgön Kongtrul reaffi rms the preeminence of the direct experience of meditation practice with a string of quotations, including the following from the Tenth Ma ̊ ̃ala of K ̋itigarbha:57Meditating in absorption will cut through all doubts.Without that realization, nothing else can do it.Therefore meditation in absorption is the best.The learned ones should pursue that.He then goes on to say, All the profound dharma that is very meaningful is contained in this Treasury, and if those with intelligence ensure its con-tinuation by means of practicing it themselves and proliferat-ing and explaining it to others, it will take on great meaning, both immediately and over the long run. Kongtrul worried about some of the practice traditions being lost and considered it his main task to preserve them. Those traditions that were well established did not concern him so much.58 In a way, his work was complementary to the work of synthesis that had already taken place, rather than corrective of it. He mentions this rationale in his Autobiog-raphy when describing The Treasury of Precious Key Instructions:59TOK_8-4_Final.indd 32TOK_8-4_Final.indd 327/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 33With an attitude of deep faith in the Eight Great Chariots of the Practice Lineages, I made great eff ort to seek out the suc-cession of the ripening empowerments and liberating instruc-tions that had come from those long traditions. Although I might not have the chance to practice them all, the guru’s spiritual instructions should not be wasted. For that reason I felt that even if the more famous traditions were individually widespread, the continuity of some of the very rare [transmis-sions] were in danger of being cut off and should be preserved at least as word lineages. I also think that just hearing once these essential doctrines of sutra and mantra gives meaning to this human existence. With this altruistic motivation I col-lected the essential root texts of the Eight Chariots and the most profound of their quintessential ripening empowerments and liberating instructions into one treasury. In the Catalogue, he was more specifi c about which traditions were threatened:The continuity of the Shangpa teachings, Zhijé, Dorjé Sum-gyi Nyendrup, and some others are extremely rare and nearly going extinct. With the noble aspiration of hoping to ben-efi t the continuity of the teachings of empowerment, reading transmission, and guidance, and in order to give meaning to my great diligence and exertion of eff ort, and so that the frayed rope of those long lineages would at least not break, we must pay some attention to them.60Preservation, however, is only one salutary eff ect of the unbiased col-lection of practice materials. Another consideration concerns the basic concept of the skillful nature of Buddhist teachings—that there is a ver-sion of theory and practice that is perfectly suited to each individual according to his or her inclinations and abilities. This is an important organizing principle in many teachings, such as the “stages of the path” (Tib. lam rim) teachings found in the Kadampa section and others of the present volume. Illustrating this idea, it is often said that the Bud-dha ⁄›kyamuni taught 84,000 diff erent dharmas for the same number of diff erent problems. Since it is not known which one will benefi t which TOK_8-4_Final.indd 33TOK_8-4_Final.indd 337/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgebeing, it is best to collect them all, so that no one will miss her or his unique opportunity. In seeming contradiction to that, another operating principle is that exposure to the vast array of techniques virtually forces one to accept that they are more or less the same, and therefore are all equally valid Buddhist teachings. The diff erences that are fi ne-tuned to the individual are, after all, very minor and the similarities in being viable techniques on the path to awakening are dominant. Each tradition is profound and brilliant in its own right, once it is glimpsed. It must be seen to be believed. But if a person comprehends only a single philosophical presentation or one esoteric instruction and becomes fi xated on it as truth, then the rumors of alternatives will seem strange and erroneous. Prejudice is always a result of ignorance. Jamgön Kongtrul saw this in others and found it in himself, as we see in the following passage from his Autobiography:61These days even famous lamas and geshés have a very meager vision or pure perception of the entirety (phyogs med) of the sage’s doctrine other than just for that of their own traditions and a few sources. Most people, high and low, have done few studies and have little familiarity with the dharma. In particu-lar, in these later times there are indeed many who, while they themselves do not live forthrightly and lack a religious out-look, yet with the arrogance of power proclaim which dharma traditions are good and which bad, which lineages are pure and which impure. To say nothing of other traditions, they even shun their own traditions with unfounded fears, like a blind yak that startles himself. Even I, one who yearns for the dharma from the depths of my heart, did not accomplish my desires because I did not have the courage of my convictions and became ineff ectual. But from this point on, progressively the lotus of faith in all doctrines without bias (ris su ma chad pa) and all doctrine holders of the sage’s doctrine unfolded freely and fully (phyogs med). My knowledge of the dharma has also fl ourished. I have not committed the grievous act of rejecting the dharma. This came about from the kindness of my precious lord guru himself.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 34TOK_8-4_Final.indd 347/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 35This is a rare occurrence in his autobiography where Kongtrul criticizes sectarianism in others, and yet even here he turns this criticism on him-self and divulges his own weaknesses. It hints at another benefi t of cul-tivating an open-minded approach, namely, that seeking out one’s own hidden biases is itself an integral practice of the spiritual path of insight and leads to positive results as he describes. But the point here is that for someone credited with founding an alternative movement, or worse yet, a “school,” this statement hardly suffi ces as a manifesto of a rimé philosophy. It seems strange that nothing more on the subject is to be found in an extensive autobiography of the founder of a movement.Western scholarship has indulged in a kind of psychological analy-sis of Kongtrul’s behavior. Incidents and hardships from his early life are cited as the forces behind his stance. It is particularly mentioned, for example, that he was compelled to retake his monastic vows at the Kagyu monastery of Palpung, though he had already received them from a Nyingma preceptor. Kongtrul refers to this unfortunate incident only once in his autobiography, compared to the hundreds of times he attests to his devotion to the preceptor of his new vows, his guru Situ Pema Nyinjé.62 It is diffi cult for the reader to locate a sense of damaged psyche. And if there were such a thing, a more predictable psychologi-cal response would have been to take a stance against such injustices by opposition, rather than by embracing all those sects and sectarians. Though such diffi culties certainly aff ected him, one must be careful not to impute a foreign and “normal” psychological response to this master who was anything but normal. This brings us fi nally to contemplate what rimé (ris med) really meant to Jamgön Kongtrul and how he used the word. He did not seem to defi ne it anywhere, and certainly not as a well-formulated political stance. Rather, it seems to be a somewhat ordinary expression that Kongtrul used so much that it became a kind of catchword for his attitude. Ris means “part,” or “region,” and med is a negation. It is a contraction of ris su med pa, “not in parts,” the opposite of ris su chad pa, “cut in parts,” and a synonym of phyogs med, “without directions.” In other words, it means “whole,” “entire,” or “intact,” and in usage could be translated as “unlimited” or “without regard for categories.”A search of every title with the word ris med in the holdings of the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center turned up twenty-two texts.63 A quick survey revealed that most of them are histories, biographies, cata-TOK_8-4_Final.indd 35TOK_8-4_Final.indd 357/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgelogues, aspiration prayers, songs, or praises (the doxography of doxol-ogy!) that simply cover many masters or lineages. Yet the given subject heading was ris-med while the usage was often listed as “sect name.” A close reading of one text that seemed the most promising to reveal some sort of statement of rimé philosophy by Jamgön Kongtrul turned out to be mainly concerned with tracing the history of Buddhism from India and its development in Tibet, including the beginnings of the Tibetan race. Among the many systems of both practice and philosophy, it also gives a decent short treatment of Tibet’s “other” religion, Bön, making it truly pluralistic. Before reading it, I would have translated the title as something like “Beautiful Necklace of Clear Thought: A Brief Mention of the Sources of the Nonsectarian Doctrines.” Reading with new eyes, I see now that the literal translation might just as well be “A Brief History of Everything.”64What, then, is Jamgön Kongtrul’s rimé position? It is clearly not con-cerned with sects. I believe the hint is in the above statement, “I have not committed the grievous act of rejecting the dharma,” and elsewhere, “Rejecting the Buddhist teachings is a heavy burden which I have no wish to carry.”65 In general, the Buddhist approach has always taught tolerance for all religions and is even renowned for that tolerance. In the specifi c understanding of the causes and eff ects of actions, to reject or denigrate teachings of the Buddha, in particular, is thought to have very serious consequences. It is included in the vows of refuge, the very fi rst level of discipline adopted when becoming a Buddhist. The late great master Dezhung Rinpoché, who was a paragon of unbiased devotion with deep roots in the Sakya tradition, said in a talk in 1983:66First of all, one who despises another Buddhist school despises the Buddha. He impairs the transmission of the Dharma. The presence of the Dharma is jeopardized by such an attitude, and one becomes cut off from its transmission. This is so because one’s refuge vows are based upon reliance on the Enlightened One, his Teachings, and the Holy Community. If one rejects Dharma, one breaks one’s refuge vow and thereby becomes cut off from the Dharma. By rejecting this Dharma that is the only door to happiness for beings and oneself, one accumulates inexhaustible sin.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 36TOK_8-4_Final.indd 367/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 37In the vows of refuge in the dharma, even disrespecting a single syllable of the alphabet impairs the vow. More particularly, harboring such views of disrespect radically opposes the discipline and spirit of vajray›na. Many of the root downfalls in that approach address it specifi cally. Jamgön Kongtrul describes the second root downfall:67 To transgress the Buddha’s teachings, in a general sense, means to transgress what was taught by the Victorious One. To disre-spect and reject the teachings, even when due to lack of under-standing of them, qualifi es as a downfall.And the sixth root downfall:68To disrespect spiritual teachings, in its general sense, means to disparage [one’s own or] other religions out of desire for personal gain.We can understand Kongtrul’s great concern for not breaking these sacred pledges when we read his description of what that means:If practitioners transgress pledges and do not restore them, the transgressions become the root cause for their fall into the hell of Unceasing Torture or another hell; thus, they are called root downfalls.Beyond the question of specifi c vows, bias goes against the very idea of vajray›na. This is expressed in the concept of “pure perception” or “sacred outlook” (Tib. dag snang), which is based on the idea that the intrinsic nature of all beings is actually the fully awakened awareness of a buddha. This reality is only temporarily obscured by affl ictive emotions and ignorance. The approach of secret mantra purports to be imple-menting this true state right now. In other words, in the practice of the spiritual path one integrates the predicted result of that path while one is still practicing it. This is only logical, since that resultant awak-ened state is already present as the ground of being. The methods are to realize oneself and one’s surroundings as manifesting this intrinsically pure state; to see with pure perception that all of one’s experiences are sacred. This is the rationale for the three stages of vajray›na practice that TOK_8-4_Final.indd 37TOK_8-4_Final.indd 377/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeone fi nds described in these esoteric instructions: the creation phase of visualizing oneself and others as deities in a pure land, the completion phase of yogic practice where bliss and emptiness are experienced based on the subtle body that is in itself the pure cause of awakening, or in the great completion practice of direct experience of primordially pure intrinsic awareness and spontaneous presence. This is directly implied in the sacred pledges of vajray›na, where it applies to one’s perceptions of gurus, companions in practice, and women (who apparently need to be singled out for special attention in this matter of pure perception). It is a way of experiencing everything as primordially and ultimately good without regard for categories (ris med). In terms of the doctrine, when one has access to many teachings it is easy to see that they are all worthy of respect, and certainly all to be included in this sacred outlook. If even the most ordinary or seemingly fi lthy substances are to be experienced as having “equal fl avor” (Tib. ro mnyam), then what need is there to mention all the slightly diff ering versions of Buddhist teachings? Any other attitude contradicts all levels of discipline and is counterproductive to the intent of Buddhist practice. Dezhung Rinpoché said,One whose Dharma career is tainted by narrow-mindedness and attachment to one’s own interests while rejecting those of others will never overcome the many obstacles to the attain-ment of wisdom or insight.69Unfortunately, pure perception as a concept is wide open for innocent misinterpretation and not-so-innocent abuse. It has been used to suppress criticism, to coerce obedience to dubious gurus and practices, to discour-age inquiry, and generally stands in opposition to the use of discriminat-ing intelligence. This is true particularly in the West, where two factors obfuscate the problem: our lack of cultural models of devotion except as a kind of idol worship, and a propensity for investigative inquiry. When the latter is suppressed in the name of faith, we leap to the former, that is, the opposite extreme of blind devotion that relegates discernment to the deep recesses of denial. This, of course, is fundamentalism. It is the opposite of an unbiased approach, which really requires the eyes to be wide open. It is a tragic irony that the two approaches are so intimately TOK_8-4_Final.indd 38TOK_8-4_Final.indd 387/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 39connected that attempts at openness often precipitate prejudice, either as backlash or as an indiscernible mutation of pure perception into poor perception. The latter occurs when the abstract concept is used to label experiences as a way to disengage from them, like a smiley-face stamp of approval.70 Kongtrul quotes AvalokiteŸvara:71Wise people respect qualities, not buddhas or mighty lords and the like. To have respect where there is an absence of qualities is folly, and arises from nonvirtuous karma.The victorious ones and their heirs, he continues, have emphasized reli-ance on the dharma and not on individuals.72 But even so, without the actual deep appreciation of the beauty of interdependence, the arising of the many exquisite forms of emptiness, pure perception remains shifty as a concept. The path of vajray›na, though practiced as the result, attempts to instill this on the experiential—rather than conceptual—level, where such misappropriations are less likely. It is diffi cult to articulate pure perception in the context of an unbiased approach, which is perhaps exactly why Kongtrul took the route of simply presenting many, many options. That approach both helps to engender pure perception through knowledge, and displays the pure beauty of diversity to those already possessed of pure perception, such as Kalu Rinpoché:Each of these lineages transmits the peerless word of Buddha by way of lineages of sages and adepts who are like pure gold. They transmit uncorrupted authentic Dharma that can lead beings to liberation from cyclic existence, to ultimate spiritual realization.73The distinct transmissions of practice that are presented in this vol-ume each provide such a training, while remaining potentially eff ec-tive methods for awakening to the truth. Kongtrul does not mix them together because they are each complete and internally coherent. It is recognized that rimé does not particularly advocate a sort of mix-and-match approach of one’s favorites nor a blending of all techniques and doctrines into a new, ultimate dharma. When asked about the possibility of a new religion of all truths, the fourteenth Dalai Lama said,74TOK_8-4_Final.indd 39TOK_8-4_Final.indd 397/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeI think that diff erences in faith are useful. There is a rich-ness in the fact that there are so many diff erent presentations of the way. Given that there are so many diff erent types of people with various predispositions and inclinations, this is helpful.Describing the rimé movement as “inclusive” may lead to the wrong impression. It does not mean a kind of synthetic movement wherein all the teachings and lineages are melded together in a universal approach. Nor should it be viewed as an attempt to absorb all “other” customs into one’s own, regarding them as not contradictory but also as not complete without one’s own favorite. Diana Eck, working with the Harvard Plu-ralism Project, describes three kinds of reactions to religious (and other kinds of) diversity. Exclusivism occurs when other traditions are simply regarded as wrong, or worse, totally dismissed or attacked. Inclusivism is a kind of liberal acceptance into the fold, but still clings to a hierarchical scheme with one’s own religion at the top. This is really a more subtle way of denying autonomy and denigrating another’s faith. Pluralism, on the other hand, is fully engaging in dialogue with other belief systems and appreciating them through mutual understanding, while not abne-gating one’s own tradition. In defi ning pluralism, she says:75 Third, I would insist that pluralism is not simply relativism. It does not displace or eliminate deep religious commitments, or secular commitments for that matter. It is, rather, the encoun-ter of commitments. Some critics have persisted in linking pluralism with a kind of valueless relativism, in which all cats are gray, all perspectives equally viable and, as a result, equally uncompelling. Pluralism, they would contend, undermines commitment to one’s own particular faith with its own par-ticular language, watering down particularity in the interests of universality. I consider this view a distortion of the process of pluralism. I would argue that pluralism is the engagement, not the abdication, of diff erences and particularities. While the encounter with people of other faiths in a pluralist society may lead one to a less myopic view of one’s own faith, pluralism is not premised on a reductive relativism, but on the signifi cance and the engagement of real diff erences.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 40TOK_8-4_Final.indd 407/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 41The descriptions in Esoteric Instructions and the collections in The Trea-sury of Precious Key Instructions grouped according to the Eight Great Chariots of the Practice Lineages do not suggest either exclusivism or inclusivism. Here the means for enlightenment are simply laid side by side for the reader to discern, an act of deep faith in the notion that all of them would be of great benefi t. There was, of course, a reaction as this approach gained popularity and was perceived as a threat to some establishments. In Tibet of the late nineteenth century, where information traveled via rumor and Khampas were regarded mainly as bandits, it must have seemed that Kongtrul and his cohorts were up to no good. There was a strong and perhaps sin-cere reaction from certain teachers who regarded this apparently eclectic approach as the wrong way to go about practice. Sometimes, also, sloppy eclecticism—which rimé was not, but might be perceived as—can incite as much of a religious fundamentalist reaction as secularism does, as we can see in the modern world. But in Tibet the main culprit was the usual mix of power politics with religion, for never the twain were sepa-rated. It is signifi cant that Jamgön Kongtrul’s universality itself spawned a sectarian reaction. He must have known that this would happen but could not help but proceed. Gene Smith takes note of this unfortunate consequence:76Their innovation called into question the extent to which the synthetic eff ort may eff ace the very traditions it seeks to pre-serve. And yet the esteem with which Kong sprul, Mkhyen brtse, and their collaborators continue to be regarded are a testimonial to the tact and judgment they possessed. Although the nonsectarian movement did engender reactionary intoler-ance and occasionally the denigration of other traditions of Buddhist practice, even these sectarian responses were couched in the language of eclecticism and unity. These confl icts and troubles have left their mark even today in sectar-ian squabbles that constantly bubble up to the surface, even though the surface presents itself as happily nonsectarian. Far removed from the confl ict in time and space, Western scholars and practitioners have insisted on perceiving the sincere devotional approach that has been termed rimé as a movement, a philosophy, a school, a sect in itself, a TOK_8-4_Final.indd 41TOK_8-4_Final.indd 417/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeNyingma-Kagyu alliance, an anti-establishment stance, an anti-Gelukpa plot, or a crazy wisdom lineage. Is this co-opting of a basically straight-forward idea impossible to avoid? When students in a class on Buddhism in Tibet were presented with the histories and instructions of the eight lineages, it was taken as evidence of Tibet’s sectarian tendencies. Invari-ably some tried to assess their relative worth, creating a hierarchy of profundity. Lately, in the Tibetan Buddhist scene in America, there has been an imagined confl ict between “pure Buddhism” and “American Buddhism,” even though both are meaningless, random designations that are nowhere to be found in any real people. When trenches are dug, people fall into them. Rimé becomes another exclusive club to assure one’s own superiority.In my opinion, considerable damage has been done in portraying rimé as a school or a sect set in opposition to other factions, however unintentionally. In doing that, we make it into precisely its opposite. This is not to say that many complex and sectarian factors did not exist in Tibet. But at the very least, let us exclude Jamgön Kongtrul from the sides being drawn up in our stubborn penchant to hold categories in highest regard. Dezhung Rinpoché said:77 All these attitudes are commonly found among Tibetan Bud-dhist monks and laypeople. These attitudes may be common, but they are not Buddhist. The great Kagyu master and propo-nent of the Nonsectarian (Tib. ris med) movement, Kongtrul Rinpoché, stated that a wise person will have faith in the teach-ings of all orders and will love the Dharma found in each, just as a mother cherishes all her children. A wise person’s mind is vast like the sky, with room for many teachings, many insights, and many meditations. But the mind of an ignorant sectarian is limited, tight, and narrow, like a vase that can only hold so much. It is diffi cult for such a mind to grow in Dharma because of its self-imposed limitations. The diff erence between the wise Buddhist and the sectarian Buddhist is like that between the vastness of space and the narrowness of a vase. These are the words of Kongtrul Rinpoché.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 42TOK_8-4_Final.indd 427/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"introduction \u0003 43Using Esoteric InstructionsJamgön Kongtrul has given us many suggestions on why he collected these teachings, but we must still discern how to actually use them. Despite the many aforementioned benefi ts of such grand collections, the stupendous array and seeming divergences of the Buddhist teachings and traditions can be confusing. That is particularly true in the present case, where by defi nition the instructions are designed for very personal use in practice. The only advice that Kongtrul left regarding The Treasury of Precious Key Instructions was intended for the preceptors who would be bestowing the collection in a transmission, rather than for the aver-age practitioner. In the Catalogue, he illustrates the principle of subject-appropriate teachings by means of an example: “the great medicine of the gradual realizer will turn to poison for an instantaneous realizer, and the great medicine of the instantaneous ones will become poison for the gradualist.”78 He continues with how to engage the Treasury: In general, each of the teaching systems of the Eight Chariots of Practice Lineages includes the complete process for attain-ing enlightenment, so they are exclusively special, exalted, profound approaches. Therefore, according to the individual’s interest and mental capabilities, give the instructions of each chariot as a whole or bit by bit, and so on. Even selecting the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions as one likes can only be effi cacious.79 It is reassuring to know that one’s spiritual master would be able to make these choices and that she or he could hardly go wrong. So perhaps the best use of this book, Esoteric Instructions, would be to bring it to one’s teacher and ask for instructions. It can also function as a survey of one’s particular lineage in which to fi nd good ideas, since a practitioner is often unaware of what to request. Those already engaged in a particu-lar Buddhist path could enhance their knowledge of their approach by reading the pertinent chapter, and they will fi nd much of it familiar from previous experience. In general, it is suggested that a person will do better by following one particular tradition. There are many popular analogies to illustrate this, such as that mixing too many foods will not be delicious, and that in starting to dig many wells, one will never reach TOK_8-4_Final.indd 43TOK_8-4_Final.indd 437/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe deep water. Khyabjé Kalu Rinpoché, in many ways the successor of Jamgön Kongtrul, said: In general, to have faith in all the traditions is a sign of pro-found understanding of the teachings. However, it is absolutely necessary to engage in one given tradition, to receive detailed instructions in it, and to be introduced to its essential practices; and then, it is proper to practice mainly those teachings.So, regardless of the school or lama from whom we receive teachings, we should try to adopt an impartial attitude and devote ourselves to practice with total aspiration. Otherwise, merely remembering some phrases here and there, taking in only certain aspects of the teachings, and playing at being prac-titioners will make it quite diffi cult for us to gain any signifi -cant benefi t.80On the other hand, The Treasury of Knowledge treatise in general car-ries the stated purpose of making the doctrine available to those with little study. More specifi cally, the esoteric instructions are described as directives to simplify the meditation practices. So in theory it would be very helpful to become familiar with the range of techniques presented here. As mentioned before, they are not suffi ciently described to put into practice without further instruction, but there is more than enough to develop a tremendous appreciation and even awe at the brilliance of this vehicle in all its manifestations, and in this way to come to an authenti-cally unbiased valuation of all the lineages—pure perception based on knowledge, without regard for categories. Then, in deeply practicing one’s own path, one will fi nally fully understand all paths, and become a true pluralist, such as Kalu Rinpoché:81 All spiritual traditions, whether Christian, Hindu, Judaic, Islamic, or Buddhist, teach that the understanding of what we are at the deepest level is the main point. This understanding of the nature of mind sheds light from within and illuminates the teachings of all traditions. In every tradition, whoever gains fi rsthand, experiential understanding of mind and retains that kind of awareness is led to a world view that would not have been possible prior to this direct experience.

Even a realized being who is not involved in a particular spiritual tradition would have, while living in the ordinary world, an extremely benefi cial infl uence.AcknowledgmentsI sought help from knowledgeable sources and relied on the former work of other translators for each of the Tibetan Buddhist lineages represented here. It is important to acknowledge them all in context.Chapter 1 on the Nyingma tradition had been roughly translated many years ago by Lama Drupgyu and the translation committee. In reworking it, I relied mainly on Gangteng Tulku Rinpoché, a Nyingma Lama in the Padma Lingpa tradition of Bhutan, with whom I have stud-ied for years. Chapter 2, the Kadampa, had also been translated by the committee years ago. Some general questions were ably answered by Lama Tenpa Gyaltsen, who was helpful throughout, and some details on texts by Tenzin Dorjee at Geshe Gyaltsen’s center. For Chapter 3 on the Lamdré lineage I was helped incalculably by Cyrus Stearns, who both shared his early translation of the chapter and off ered detailed help with my endless questions. Anything accurate in that chapter is due to his knowledge of the teachings in that lineage.Chapter 4, on the Marpa Kagyu, is quite extensive, and fortunately I found help from many quarters. The excellent translation of the six yogas section by Elizabeth Callahan was of immense benefi t and could hardly be improved upon. Similarly, the translation of the m›hamudr› section by Ari Goldfi eld, also enhanced by the teachings of Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, was generously made available. Questions were answered by those two lots›was, as well as by Khenpo Tsultrim himself, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoché, Ringu Tulku Rinpoché, Lama TOK_8-4_Final.indd 45TOK_8-4_Final.indd 457/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTenpa Gyaltsen, and probably others that I am forgetting. The sections on the Pakmo Drupa, Drigung, Drukpa, Rechung, and Kamtsang tra-ditions were not previously translated, as far as I know. Answers and helpful notes were kindly provided on the Drigung section by Drupon Thinley Ningpo Rinpoché. For the Drukpa Kagyu, I took advantage of papers and comments by two monks from Bhutan while they were students at Naropa University: Lama Kinley Wangchuk and Loppon Sonam Bumden. For Chapter 5, on the Shangpa Kagyu, I was fortunate to possess all the texts in that tradition as well as to have personal familiarity with it. An early translation by Matthew Kapstein proved to be very helpful as well. I had translated Chapter 6, on the systems of Zhijé and Chöd, many years earlier for the translation committee and it had gone through some revision by the group. During that fi rst attempt, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoché had patiently answered my many questions. Without contem-porary practitioners of Zhijé, I revised my old translation based on the available commentaries. In the meantime, I had done considerable work in the Chöd tradition and was hopefully able to improve on that section as well. For Chapter 7, on the Six-Branch Yoga, I had hoped to seek the advice of Bokar Rinpoche, an expert on the K›lacakra tradition, but his untimely death precluded my complacent expectations. Cyrus Stearns again came to the rescue with his earlier translation and citations. Recent publications of important K›lacakra texts were very timely for this dif-fi cult and specialized subject. Transcripts of Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso were also helpful. Chapter 8 is on Orgyenpa’s instructions called Dorjé Sumgyi Nyendrup. If there are experts on this tradition, I did not fi nd them. Luckily, Jamgön Kongtrul had collected a number of sources in his Treasury of Precious Key Instructions. Chapter 9 is a brief descrip-tion of ⁄›ntigupta’s six transmissions, which can be found in works by T›ran›tha. These are just some of the sources on which I have depended. In many ways, I would like to express gratitude to all translators of Tibetan texts—all of them treasures in special ways. I feel as if I am standing on their shoulders and that our eff orts are cumulative. Specifi cally, the previous publications of The Treasury of Knowledge that were produced in the most diffi cult of circumstances have provided a good foundation on which to build.

Occasionally I have resorted to translating certain technical terms into Sanskrit, either because that word has come into common usage (e.g., “karma,” “guru,” etc.), or because I couldn’t fi nd a good enough English term (e.g., “dharmak›ya,” “vajray›na,” etc.). In the former cases, I have dispensed with diacritical notations for any term that now appears in the American Heritage Dictionary (fourth edition). For all other cases, including names of persons, places, or texts of Indian origin, and terms given in Sanskrit by the author himself, I have used the standard system of spelling and diacritics. Unfortunately, there is no standard system for indicating pro-nunciation of Tibetan, so for personal names and occasional technical terms in Tibetan I have simply rendered them into what I think is the easiest way for English-speaking people to pronounce, borrowing the umlaut from German and accent aigu from French (perhaps adding to the problem). The scholarly system for notation of Tibetan developed by Turrell Wylie can be found in the endnotes, bibliography, and index. With the exception of the Introduction, where Sanskrit dominates, all terms and text names have been given fi rst in Tibetan, and in Sanskrit only if appropriate. Jamgön Kongtrul often shortened the names of texts beyond recognition, or used popular alternative names. The use of brackets in the text titles in the endnotes indicates the parts of a title that were not included in Kongtrul’s original, so that future scholars can more easily see my assumptions and mistakes. About that, I admit that the opportunity for errors in this book is immense, and I suspect they are TOK_8-4_Final.indd 47TOK_8-4_Final.indd 477/10/09 1:59:01 PM7/10/09 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgemore numerous than the stars on a winter night in the Rockies.

The earlier dissemination (snga’ dar), when Buddhism was fi rst established, occurred during the royal dynastic period of the eighth and ninth centuries. Then, after a period of suppression, a new infl ux precipitated a renaissance of Buddhism beginning in the tenth century, called the “later dissemination” (phyi dar). The lineages that began in the earlier dissemination became known as Nyingma ( rnying ma), the “old” or “ancient ones,” in contrast to all the other lineages, which belong to the later Sarma (gsar ma) or “new” lineages. The Nyingma adhere to a ninefold scheme that orders the teachings into nine successive vehicles. The fi rst three are the sutra vehicles called, in Sanskrit, Ÿr›vaka, pra-tyekabuddha, and bodhisattva. The three vehicles of the outer tantras are kriy›yoga, upa- or cary›yoga, and yogatantra. The three vehicles of the inner tantras are mah›yoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga. This last has three further divisions into the mind class (Tib. sems sde), the space class (klong sde), and the esoteric instruction class (man ngag sde).According to Jamgön Kongtrul, whose historical interest here focuses mainly on practice lineages, the basis of the doctrine known as Ancient Secret Mantra is the long or sequential lineage of precept teachings (bka’ ma) that originated during the early dissemination.* He cites the pri-mary sources for this tradition as the Net of Magical Manifestation or Guhyagarbha Tantra for the mah›yoga, the Gathering of Intentions Sutra for anuyoga, and the two traditions of the mind class, the eighteen tan-tras of mother and child, for the atiyoga.

Kongtrul identifi es six main transmissions (bka’ babs) of these inner tantra teachings. The fi rst began with the vajra master Guru Padma-sambhava from U ̃ ̃iy›na, known as the Second Buddha and an ema-nation of Buddha Amit›bha. He was invited to Tibet by the Buddhist king Trisong Deutsen (705-755) to build the fi rst monastery, Samyeling. There, although it seemed to the public that he taught only the Garland of Views of the Esoteric Instructions, in fact he gave inconceivable trans-missions and instructions to the fortunate disciples, such as the Eight Transmitted Precepts. In addition he bestowed the Luminous Clarity Great Completion (’od gsal rdzogs chen), which condenses the essence of all dharma, and the instructions on peaceful and wrathful guru, and so forth. Since he perceived that most of these were not helpful at the time, he hid many teachings as treasures (gter ma) for future generations. The second transmission of the inner tantra teachings began with the great translator Vairocana (eighth century), known as the fi rst bilingual master of Tibet. King Trisong Deutsen sent him to India, where he met the awareness-holder ⁄rı Si ̇ha and requested the “eff ortless vehicle.” He received the eighteen instructions of the mind class of the great com-pletion, as well as all of the empowerments and esoteric instructions of sixty tantras, and teachings of the space class. He met twenty-one other teachers, and then the master Prahevajra, or Garab Dorjé, in the great charnel ground, where he received the essential lineages of 6,400,000 great completion teachings, reaching realization simultaneously. Back in Tibet he gave these teachings secretly and translated fi ve of the eighteen mind class teachings. Of the successions of his fi ve main disciples, two traditions that are currently well known are that of Nyang Yeshé Jungné and Aro Yeshé Jungné. The third is the transmission from the Indian Master Vimalamitra (fi fth-sixth century), the crown jewel of the fi ve hundred great scholars of India. In Tibet he gave the esoteric class instructions of the great comple-tion to Nyang Tingdzin Zangpo and translated the remaining thirteen mind class teachings with the Tibetan translator Yudra Nyingpo, a dis-ciple of Vairocana. Nyang gave the precept lineage to Lodro Wangchuk, and the written lineage was later discovered by Dangma Lungyal. He also received the precept lineage, and passed it to Zhangtön and others.

The treasure revealer Padma Lendreltsal (1291-1315) recovered instructions known as the Æ›kinı Innermost Essence, and transmitted them to Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé (1284–1339) and Shoi Gyalsé Lekpa, also known as Kum›rar›ja (1266-1343). The former brought forth the Karma Innermost Essence from the expanse of his enlightened intention, and the latter gave instructions to the omniscient Longchenpa Drimé Özer (1308-1363). He, in turn, revealed the treatises of the Guru’s Further Essence, the Profound Further Essence, and the Æ›kinı’s Further Essence. He also composed the Seven Great Treasuries, the Trilogy on Natural Ease, and many others.Fourth is the lineage of Nup Sangyé Yeshé (832-962), who studied with masters from India, Nepal, and Gilgit. He transmitted the four main scriptures of anuyoga, including the Gathering of Intentions Sutra, with the stages of the path and all of its empowerments, explanations, and esoteric instructions. Nup also transmitted boundless spiritual instructions, such as the cycle of Yamantaka. The lineage was spread mainly by his son, Yönten Gyatso, and most of the wrathful mantra were hidden as treasure.The fi fth is the lineage of Ma, Nyak, and their successors. Most of the tantric and practice precepts, notably the Net of Magical Manifestation and the teachings of Yangdak Heruka and Vajrakıl›ya, were fi rst spread by Ma Rinchen Chok, one of the fi rst seven monks of Tibet. He trans-lated and explicated the Guhyagarbha Tantra, producing many learned scholars and adepts who established the tradition. There is a well-known saying that the vajray›na doctrine fell fi rst to Nyak, in the middle to Nup, and in the end to Zur. Nyak Jñ›nakum›ra gathered the four great rivers of precepts from Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Vairocana, and Yudra Nyingpo. He passed all the teachings to his eight disciples with the name Pal, particularly to Palkyi Yeshé of Sogpo, from whom it was received by Nup Sangyé Yeshé. Nup Namkhai Nyingpo received the whole cycle of Yangdak Heruka from HÒ ̇kara in India. His successors hold the So system of instructions, which has continued to the present. Also Khön Lui Wangpo received all the instructions, including those of Yangdak Heruka and Vajrakıl›ya, which have continued through the Sakya lineage until now. Many other great adepts followed. In fact, most of the great translators of the new schools were descendents of the Nyingma lineage of awareness-holders.

They became famous as the three generations of Zurpas. Their descendents have continued to spread these lineages up to the present. Sixth is the treasure tradition that appeared later. Guru Padmasam-bhava predicted his karmicly destined physical substitutes, and hid the eighteen kinds of treasures as his verbal substitutes, such as those of the Guru and of Mah›karu ̊›. The enlightened intentions of his mind were entrusted to his karmic spiritual heirs and sealed with prayers. When the time was right, these treasures were discovered by their future ema-nations such as Nyangral Nyima Özer (1124-1192) and Guru Chökyi Wangchuk (1212-1273), known as the two supreme treasure revealers of the upper and lower treasures. There were many treasure revealers with the name Lingpa, primarily these eight: Sangyé, Dorjé, Rinchen, Padma, Ratna, Kunkyong, Dongak, and Tennyi. The awareness-holder Gökyi Demtruchen (1337-1408) and others discovered the Northern Treasures, and there were twenty-one treasure-revealers of Nuden, primarily Dudul Nuden Dorjé (b. 1655). During the time of Jamgön Kongtrul, which he refers to as the degen-erate times, there continued to be great treasure revealers such as Orgyen Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa (1829-1870). Kongtrul remained confi dent that those dharma lords and their disciples would continue to uphold the holy dharma through to the fi nal bad times. Although the doctrines of discipline and sutra will no longer exist, bits and pieces of the secret mantra vajray›na doctrine will continue to spread. Such is the continu-ity of the vast enlightened activity of liberation for the sake of all those beings that are diffi cult to tame.

However, the basis of all of them can be subsumed into two meditation techniques: with or without character-istics. That is because even the three phases of creation, completion, and great completion8 can be subsumed into two: (1) appearance and that which is manifest, has characteristics, and is objectifi ed; and (2) empti-ness and that which is unmanifest and without characteristics. This is also expressed in The Three Stages: 9TOK_8-4_Final.indd 69TOK_8-4_Final.indd 697/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThe phase of meditation with characteristicsAnd the meditation of suchnessAre taught as the two distinct kinds of meditation.Extensive Explanation [2]The second part, the extensive elucidation of the meaning, has three parts: the meditation sequences of mah›yoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga.Mahāyoga [a]This section has two parts: with characteristics and without characteris-tics. The fi rst of these also has two parts: an overview and an extensive explanation.Meditation With Characteristics [i]Overview [aa]The Magical Manifestation tradition has two systems with characteristics: method and liberation.10In the system of the Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva,11 which is the main source for tantra mah›yoga,12 there are two meditation meth-ods with characteristics: the path of certainty through methods, and the path of total liberation through wisdom. As it states in the Explanatory Tantra of the Oceanic [Magical Manifestation]: 13The paths of liberation and methods are fully presented.The former principally uses the special methods of amazing deliberate conduct14 to bring about the swift attainment of the result. The latter principally employs the three kinds of wisdom15 to liberate the bonds of ordinary being into reality itself.Extensive Explanation [bb]This has two parts: an explanation of the path of method and an expla-nation of the path of liberation. This fi rst also has two parts: an explana-tion of the upper door and of the lower door.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 70TOK_8-4_Final.indd 707/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"nyingma \u0003 71Th e Path of Method [1']Th e Upper Door [a']The common technique of the upper door in the path of method uses six chakras.The special technique involves Samantabhadra and Samantabhadrı,And the pure union of melting and controlling of great pervasion.When we divide the path of certainty through methods, there are the two approaches of the upper door [of one’s own body] and the lower door [of another’s body]. As is said in The Three Stages, there are “oral instructions about upper and lower doors.”16The upper door practice is further divided into the common and special techniques. The common upper door applies the union of blaz-ing and dripping based on the six chakras (Skt. cakra),17 generating the pristine awareness of bliss in the four chakras as a progressive training.18 This is taught in the Oceanic [Magical Manifestation]: In two sets of three chakras in three life trees,The sky cow is milked by the radiation of fi re and energy. This is renowned as the upper door.19The special [technique] was taught in the thirteenth chapter of the [Secret] Essence Tantra.20 The esoteric instruction of Samantabhadra is to target the vital point of the va ̇-shaped vital essence drop21 of pristine awareness essence that is based on the gathering of the fi ve quintes-sences in the heart chakra. The esoteric instruction of Samantabhadrı is to target the vital point of the a ̄-shaped vital essence drop of the fi ve mothers in the navel chakra. The esoteric instruction of pure union is to target the vital point of the a ̇-shaped vital essence drop of the vora-cious ̃›kinıs in the throat chakra. The esoteric instruction of the great pervasion is to target the vital point of the ha ̇-shaped lunar vital essence drop of Samantabhadra in the head chakra.22Thus, the meaning of the warming and descent of the vital essence as set forth in these approaches and in the T›r› esoteric instruction of energy currents,23 the root text and commentaries of the Secret Innermost Essence of Vimalamitra,24 and so on, are found in the oral teachings of the Zur forefathers25 and the Omniscient Drimé Özer.26 According to TOK_8-4_Final.indd 71TOK_8-4_Final.indd 717/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethem, training in the union of melting and controlling causes all discur-sive thought to dissolve into the expanse of nonthought. Enlightenment occurs in the great bliss without reference or limitation.Th e Lower Door [b']The lower door with four branches refi nes all at once.In the practice of the lower door, the descent, retention, reversal, and pervasion of the vital essence from union based on both the “space” [of the female] and the “secret” [of the male] instantly generates the pristine awareness of inseparable bliss-emptiness. It is the path of skillful meth-ods for the instantaneous realizer. Furthermore:Approach and close approach;Attainment and great attainment.In general, concerning the four branches of approach and attainment,27 there are the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of the path, the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of attainment, and the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of union. Here, we are discussing the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of union. The branch of approach is to fi rst seek a qualifi ed partner, exam-ine the channels, arouse, increase pleasure by following the treatises on desire, and so on. The branch of close approach is encouragement by the mutual exchange of the four signs;28 delighting in nonduality through the practice of the four mudras (Skt. mudr›)29 by means of the three per-ceptions.30 The branch of attainment is when, having entered into union in this way, the vital energy current moves in the heightened passion, causing the red aspect to descend and the white aspect to melt.31 As the bodhicitta falls, the four joys arise in sequence.32 Then the two sexual fl u-ids meet at the tips of the private parts of the male and female. This is the practice of experiencing coemergent pristine awareness with the actual entity [or substance of sexual fl uid]. The branch of great attainment is when the white and red constituents blend into one and are drawn up through the male’s vajra like a spider’s thread. As it ascends through the TOK_8-4_Final.indd 72TOK_8-4_Final.indd 727/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"nyingma \u0003 73navel, heart, throat, and head chakras the four stable joys of ascent are experienced.33 Finally, it spreads [throughout the body].Energy channels (rtsa; Skt. n› ̃ı) pervade the whole body, bodhicitta pervades all of the energy channels, and the pristine awareness of joy pervades all of that. At that point, the ten perfections34 and all of the qualities of the stages and paths35 automatically reach completion and one arrives at the fruition at once. This is for the instantaneous realizer on the path of skillful methods. From the Extensive Sutra: 36Spontaneous accomplishments in abundanceAre bestowed by the sublime secret empowerment.Th e Path of Liberation [2']The explanation of the path of liberation has two parts: a general divi-sion of the two types of individuals and the particular case of a gradual realizer.Th e Two Types of Individuals [a']The path of liberation has gradual and instantaneous realizers.If we divide the path of liberation, there are two kinds of practitioners: instantaneous and gradual. As is stated in Sequence of the Path,37 there is “the long-term or gradual and the instantaneous.”As for the instantaneous, there are a few individuals of exceptional faculties who attain realization, familiarity, and consummation all at once. These are called the instantaneous realizers. As it says in the High-est Magical Manifestation: 38In the yoga of the great vital essenceThe three meditations are completed all at once.Those who practice realization, familiarization, and consummation by stages are called gradual ones. Their way of realizing and familiarizing will be explained next.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 73TOK_8-4_Final.indd 737/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"74 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e Gradual Realizer [b']This has two parts: the cause that is the view, characterized as know-ing, and the consequent condition, characterized as the entrance into the meditative absorptions, including the fruition of the path—the four awareness-holders.39 Th e Cause: View [i']In the former, the view goes before.The former, the gradual realizers, train as follows: The attachment to the dual fi xation of samsara (Skt. sa ̇s›ra) and nirvana (Skt. nirv› ̊a), including projections about it, are taken as the object of evaluation. The axioms40 of evaluation are referenced in The Sequence of the Path: Suchness: fi ve actualities, manner, and words.That is to say, the view of the abiding nature is ascertained through (1) the axioms of fi ve direct actualities of previous occurrence, (2) the axioms of the fi ve manners that are consistent with those, and (3) the axioms of the fi ve kinds of words. The view having thus gone before, one then enters into meditation.41Th e Condition: Meditative Absorption [ii']The second has two parts: devotional meditation and defi nitive completion.Devotional Meditation [aa']Meditative absorption is devotional meditation and...Even if one is unable to train until reaching the ultimate fi ve experi-ences of meditative absorption in each of the paths, one could at least approximate the general meaning by meditating in a way that simulates the path through devoted intent to this or that.

Vimalamitra’s commentary Meditative Stability in the Mudras44 states:Wavering, attainment, familiarity, stability, and culmination:These fi ve are the way that experiences of meditative stability arise.Meditation Object [2\"]The explanation of the path of the object of this meditation has two parts: the general overview and the particular explanation.General Overview [a\"]There are fi ve objects of meditation that correspond toThe three stages of birth, intermediate state, and death:Great emptiness, compassion-illusion, single mudra, elaborate mudra, and assembly practice.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 75TOK_8-4_Final.indd 757/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThe path of the object of meditation is described in the [Secret] Essence: 45The way that the stages of existence are ripenedIs laid out in the fi ve branches of entrance.Since all things are refl exive awareness,Death is the ultimate truth,In between [death and] birth is the relative,The three stages of rebirth signify the nondual.The paths to refi ne the three stages of birth, the intermediate state (bar do), and death all at once are taught defi nitively as follows: Great empti-ness is the path corresponding to the luminous clarity at the moment of death. Great compassion is the path corresponding to the intermediate state. Single mudra, elaborate mudra, and the attainment of the mandala clusters46 are the paths corresponding to the three stages of birth. [These refi ne the four kinds of birthplace:] spontaneous birth, which depends on a place, heat-and-moisture birth, which depends on fl avor, and both womb-birth and egg-birth, which depend on the coming together of a father and a mother.Particular Explanation [b\"]This section has two parts, an overview and an extensive explanation.

Having attained profi ciency in eight measures of clarity and stability,Mandalas, clusters, numbers, and faces and arms emanate.When embodied beings experience the transition of death and the sequence of outer and inner dissolution is complete,47 the luminous clar-ity of the dharmak›ya48 of the death state arises. In order to integrate that experience into the spiritual path, one meditates in the absorption of such-ness so that all things subsumed in sensory phenomena are [recognized as] the unembellished dharmak›ya. When one fails to recognize this luminous clarity in the death state, the illusory-like mental body of the intermediate state occurs. In medi-tation, the habitual patterns49 formed from that situation are refi ned away by meditation in nonreferential all-arising absorption, the essence of which is the great compassion pervading space. So long as one is not liberated in the intermediate state on that basis, the next stage is conception in the mother’s womb through actual birth. The habitual patterns formed then are refi ned by the subtle and coarse methods of the single mudra. The situation of the intermediate exis-tence, when one is about to enter into a birthplace due to the condition of growing attachment to whatever place one is to take birth, is refi ned by the subtle absorption of the cause, the essence of which is medita-tion on a seed syllable alone. Those, then, are the trainings in the three absorptions.50The situation from the time that [consciousness] itself intermingles with the father and mother’s seminal fl uids until the awakening of the sense organs to the external world at birth is refi ned by training in the coarse form of the deity, such as the four actual enlightening factors, the three rites, and so on. The training in these creation phase practices accords with the manner of the four kinds of birthplace.51 The four measures of clarity are clear, luminous, vibrant, and vivid.52 The four measures of stability are unwavering, unchanging, completely unchanging, and utterly unchangeable.53 Once one has gained profi -ciency in these eight measures of clarity and stability, the habitual pat-terns arising from birth until maturity are refi ned by the four trainings TOK_8-4_Final.indd 77TOK_8-4_Final.indd 777/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgein the elaborate mudra, as indicated in the Sequence of the Path: There are mandalas, clusters, numbers, And faces and arms.In the elaborate mudra one emanates mandalas, one emanates clusters [of mandalas], one emanates numbers [of deities], and one emanates faces and arms [of the deities]. These four respectively comprise (1) the extensive, medium, and condensed mandalas of peaceful and wrathful deities; (2) one, three, or fi ve [mandala] clusters; (3) numbers of one thousand, twenty-four thousand, and a spontaneously present incon-ceivable number of peaceful deities, and one thousand four hundred and fi fty, seventy-six thousand eight hundred and fi fty, and a spontane-ously present inconceivable number of wrathful deities; and (4) faces and arms of the deities that are also in extensive, medium, and con-densed styles.On this, the great pa ̊ ̃ita Rongzom54 explained that one could con-dense the meaning of all the deity yogas with characteristics into three: the yoga of blessing, the yoga of imaginative construction, and the yoga of completion.The fi rst of these is to meditate that one’s own suchness (de kho na nyid) is blessed by the suchness of the deity. This is like using alchemy to change iron into gold. The second is to create the form k›yas out of pure bodhicitta. This is like making statues and such by correctly melting gold or other substances. Third is for a yogin who has realized natural purity to completely emanate55 [the deities] in an instant of meditative absorption. This is like the eff ortless appearance of a refl ection in clear water. It is said that the entire extent of secret mantra practice can be subsumed into these three yogas.Five excellences lay the foundation of practice, And four branches of approach and attainment straighten the approach.Awareness-holder of the desire or form realms is accomplished in six months or so.The dissipating fi ve paths purify the habitual patterns of samsara.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 78TOK_8-4_Final.indd 787/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"nyingma \u0003 79Completing the fruition, they cause the ripening of the higher paths,Which is the cause of attaining the four types of nondissipating awareness-holder.If one is trained in the elaborate mudra, the method that refi nes the habitual patterns of the time from maturity through old age56 is the assembly practice of the cluster groups. The place where one does the practice, the time of practice, the practice materials that one uses, the teacher and entourage from whom one receives the practice, and the method of the practice mode should be the fi ve excellences57 that lay the foundation of practice. The four branches of approach and attainment at the time of practice straighten the approach. It states in the Sequence of the Path: The fi rst half-month, seeing the face is close approach:Clarity of the deity, emanating and absorbing, [indicates] a suit-able vessel.The fi fteenth day onwards is attainment:Alternating emanating and absorbing attains it.When the number of days is complete and signs arise,The spiritual power from mantra repetition is the great attain-ment.Once the conditions and practice materials are assembled, as soon as one enters into the practice it is called approach. Once one has thus entered, up to half a month is the close approach. The last half [of the retreat time], except for the last day, is called attainment. And the very last evening when the spiritual powers are received is known as great attainment.58 Likewise, the results of attainment are taught in terms of the time it takes to accomplish the state of an awareness-holder. One will accom-plish the fruition of being an awareness-holder in six months, if prac-tice is done together with the addendum,59 or whatever length of time is appropriate to one’s particular capabilities. This was indicated by the words “or so” in the root text. Depending on whether one uses the action- mudra or the awareness-mudra,60 the common spiritual powers of the creation phase are the attainment of the awareness-holder of similar TOK_8-4_Final.indd 79TOK_8-4_Final.indd 797/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge status to either the desire realm or the form realm.61 The special spiritual powers of the practice of the peaceful assembly are accomplished in six [months] in the best of the best cases, in one year at the best, in fourteen months average, and in sixteen months in even the worst cases. The awareness-holder with control over life span applies to those of sharp faculties, while the awareness-holder of complete maturation applies to those with dull faculties. It states in the Secret Essence: 62 In thirty days times six,Or twelve, fourteen, or sixteen [months],The ultimate accomplishment of empowered awareness-holder will be attained.63In the practice of the wrathful deities, the time for accomplishment is even shorter: the best practitioner will become accomplished in two months, the middling in three months and six days, and even the lesser in six months. In the Sequence of the Path it states:For thirty days times six,Or sixty or ninety plus six,Meditate on the mandala of great Bhairava.Great emptiness, compassion, the single mudra, and the elaborate mudra—these four constitute the path of accumulation, while the assembly practice constitutes the path of application. These fi ve dissipat-ing64 paths correspond to cyclic existence in the three stages of birth, the intermediate state, and death, and thereby purify its habitual patterns. Nurturing the potential of the family65 will bring the result to comple-tion. And since the path of the assembly practice causes the attainment of the deity’s form of bliss-emptiness, in terms of the supreme spiritual powers, it quickly lays the foundation of the path of application, and hence brings about the maturation of the higher paths. By that, one is able to enter the completion phase, which becomes the perpetuating cause for ultimately attaining the four types of awareness-holder sub-sumed in the three nondissipating paths: those of seeing, meditating, and the ultimate.66TOK_8-4_Final.indd 80TOK_8-4_Final.indd 807/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"nyingma \u0003 81Completion Phase [bb\"]Secondly, the way of training in the completion phase:In completion phase, drawing energy-mind into the central channel is great emptiness.Meditate on luminous clarity day and night by two ways of placement.Compassion arises from liberation in illusory forms of emptiness.The divine form of melting bliss seals,The single form proliferates, and clusters emanate throughout space.The assembly practice and three mudras are the perpetuating causeOf attaining the nondual k›ya of the path of training.To explain the main pillar of the path in terms of the completion phase, one must explain the fi ve yogas of the path, such as great emptiness, and so on. (1) The Yoga of Great Emptiness The habitual patterns of the death existence are integrated on the path by the process of drawing the energy-mind into the central channel. The foundation is the view that has been ascertained. Then in a place where meditative stability will not be interrupted, awareness settles in a state of uncontrived fresh awareness by means of the seven-point pos-ture of Vairocana.67 This is the placement meditation of the kus›li.68 Recalling the view gained from previous study and contemplation and resting in that state is the analytic meditation of the pa ̊ ̃ita.69 Resting in the equipoise of nonconceptual absorption by whichever of these two methods of placement is appropriate is the daytime yoga. At night, the two esoteric instructions for recognizing luminous clarity in sleep and in meditation sessions are combined. By means of practicing these day and night in conjunction, one trains in reaching the ultimate fi ve meditative experiences.70TOK_8-4_Final.indd 81TOK_8-4_Final.indd 817/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge(2) Compassion Illusion This is the way to meditate on the path that is consistent with integrat-ing the intermediate existence on the path. From previously stopping the mind in the state of great emptiness and luminous clarity, the appearance of forms of emptiness arise, such as smoke, mirages, fi refl y-like, white, red, and black. All of the waking appearances of daytime yoga and the dream appearances of the night are seen as illusion, like moons refl ected in water, and so they are liberated. Then great, nonreferential compas-sion arises unobstructed. One trains, familiarizing oneself with that.(3) The Yoga of the Single Mudra In order to refi ne the habitual patterns of the fi rst stage of a person’s life, one practices the path that is consistent with that. Great compassion is projected towards all appearance without partiality and, like the arising of refl ections in clear water, the single mudra of the deity’s form concur-rent with melting bliss arises by itself in meditative absorption, and seals all appearance.(4) The Yoga of the Elaborate Mudra In order to refi ne the habitual patterns of a person’s middle stage of life one practices the path that is consistent with that. The previous appearance of a single deity increases more and more until all appearance becomes nondual deities in the form of principal deities with entourages and clusters actually emanating throughout space, proliferating, distinct, and completely arising. One familiarizes oneself with that.(5) The Cluster Assembly Practice In order to refi ne the habitual patterns of the third stage of a person’s life, one practices the path that is consistent with that. By means of one or three or fi ve clusters, whatever is appropriate, one practices in a similar way to the creation phase with elaboration, or by relying on the unelaborated yoga in which the male and female [yogins] and the father-mother central deities are assembled,71 or practicing the extremely unelaborated yoga of the union of the father, unchanging great bliss, and the mother, emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects.72 In any case, the perpetuating cause is whichever of the three mudras was appropriate to practice in relation to the categories of excellent, mid-dling, and lesser faculties.

Meditation Without Characteristics [ii]Meditation without characteristics is settling into the suchness of reality.Once one has reached the culmination of the descending and ascending pristine awareness,74 one should meditate in the manner of no medita-tion on the unimaginable pristine awareness of Samantabhadrı75 without characteristics. The body without movement like the sovereign moun-tain; speech without utterance like a mute; mind nonconceptual like the sky—settle into the suchness of reality. The emptiness of no mental con-structions whatsoever is the ultimate pristine awareness of Samantabhadrı herself. The appearing aspect distinguished in the transparent brilliance of inherently luminous awareness is the basic ground pristine aware-ness of dharmak›ya Samantabhadra. Those two inseparable—the evenly pervading intrinsic awareness with no outside, inside, or in between—is the inseparability of basic space and pristine awareness, the nondual Samanta mother-father, the native mind of great completion. Anuyoga [b]The explanation of the sequence of meditation in scriptural anuyoga76 has three parts: the path of skillful methods, the path of liberation, and the explanation of the general path of defi nitive completion.Th e Path of Skillful Methods [i]In anuyoga, the path of upper and lower skillful methods produces great bliss.As mentioned in the Summation of the Meaning: 77 The essence is skillful methods and wisdom.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 83TOK_8-4_Final.indd 837/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTwo paths are specifi ed: the defi nitive path of skillful methods and the totally liberating path of wisdom.

That is called “entrance that is consistent with the meaning.”81Display of Signs [bb]The entire environment and its living inhabitants are the divine palace and mandala circle. It is created totally complete and distinctly clear just by the utterance of the seed syllables or individual generative mantras, like fi sh suddenly leaping out of limpid water.

Th e Mind Class [i]This has two parts: the view, breakthrough to basic space (dbyings su la zlo ba), and the meditation, resting in equipoise.Th e View: Breakthrough to Basic Space [aa]In the mind class, all relative phenomena, however they appear,Are the expression of reality fully complete in the awakening mind.This conveys to basic space free of identifi cation as appearance or awareness.There are three well-known classes of great completion divided accord-ing to the diff erence in degree of profundity in how they make natu-rally occurring pristine awareness into the path. In the fi rst of these, the mind class, defi ning characteristics are destroyed and one achieves breakthrough or total conviction. The mind class practitioner thus trains in the context of consciousness, which is what is to be abandoned. Phenomena (chos, Skt. dharma), however they appear, are not stamped objectively by the seal of reality (chos nyid, Skt. dharmat›). Rather, rela-tive phenomena (chos can, Skt. dharmin), however they appear, are real-ized to be fully contained within the reality of awakening mind, and are merely its object or display. This conveys one to the basic space, which is free of identifying appearance separately from awareness.86Th e Meditation: Resting in Equipoise [bb]Therefore, appearance is mind, and mind is pristine awareness.By resting in the natural state, delusion is directly liberated in itself.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 86TOK_8-4_Final.indd 867/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"nyingma \u0003 87Since there is no experience of meditation nor of its absence,One rests in dharmak›ya, the awareness-emptiness of natural appearance without bias.Therefore, in the practice of meditation, one knows all appearances in this way to be the natural expression of mind, and mind itself to be naturally occurring pristine awareness. Then one settles directly into the natural basic ground of mind’s essence without contrivance or calcula-tion. Thereby deluded appearance is directly liberated in itself without being rejected. Since the object of meditation is realized to be empty, there is no experience of meditation. Since delusion has collapsed in on itself, there is no experience of the absence of the ultimate meaning of meditation.87 Therefore natural appearance is experienced without bias within the state of awareness-emptiness, the dharmak›ya. Free of an object to rest in or an agent who rests, there is resting in the state of spontaneously present great equipoise. On these occasions, one fi rst severs discursive thought at its root. In the middle, one searches for mind’s hidden condition.88 Finally, one investigates the arising, abiding, and departing of thought. The abid-ing of thought arises as the ornament of mind. Mental activity dawns as the play of mind. These two inseparable is the breakthrough to the state of equipoise. By such means, calm abiding and higher insight are duly accomplished. Then, once one has investigated external appear-ance, internal awareness, and the inseparability of these two, one must practice [diligently], like rock meeting bone, using the vital points of the esoteric instructions that have been imparted by a guru experienced in pointing out mind’s nature and such, and who has assessed the disciple’s mental type and level of cognition.Th e Space Class [ii]In the space class there are four sections: a presentation of the conclusive points of the view and meditation, an explanation of the vital points of meditation and the four methods, a summary of the method of place-ment, and an explanation of the four common meditative experiences.

The sequence of meditation is currently well established in the tradi-tion of ripening empowerments and liberating instructions. The leading statement in the source text, the Vajra Bridge,90 contains the conclusive points:Homage to the unmistaken, uncontrived, unimaginable, free of intellect.This lays out in summary the meaning of this source text. The view is unmistaken, the meditation is uncontrived, the activity is unimaginable, and the fruition is free of intellect. Since the view, meditation, activity, and fruition of this tradition are subsumed and completely contained in this, the initial statement alone liberates those of excellent faculties. This very meaning fully contains the basis of the spiritual instructions of the space class.Vital Points of Meditation and Four Methods [bb]Natural openness, unwavering, drawing up, and not touching;These four vital points are the modes for pristine awareness, basic space, bliss, and reality.They make the clarity, emptiness, and so on of the four empowerments into the path.Those of middling faculties are liberated just by the blessing of the guru’s transmission. During empowerment, the distinctive quality of this itself is conferred in the four empowerments91 and one reaches the ultimate experiential realization. Those of dull faculties must meditate on the stages laid out in the guides to experience. To summarize those conclusive points: the four TOK_8-4_Final.indd 88TOK_8-4_Final.indd 887/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"nyingma \u0003 89modes possessed of the four vital points make the meaning of the four empowerments into the path. The natural openness of the senses is the vital point of clarity. The unwavering lamps are the vital point of empti-ness.92 Drawing up the downward-clearing energy currents is the vital point of bliss. And the lips not touching93 is the vital point of insepara-bility. With these are the mode of pristine awareness, the mode of basic space, the mode of bliss, and the mode of reality.94 We can make the con-nection with the vital points of the four modes or four symbols as they are presented in the vajra verses as follows: In the four empowerments, the fi rst pristine awareness makes the clarity of the vase empowerment into the path, the second makes the emptiness of the secret empower-ment into the path, the third makes the bliss of the wisdom empow-erment into the path, and the fourth makes the reality of the fourth empowerment into the path.Th e Method of Placement [cc]To summarize, rest in reality without deliberate activity.If one were to summarize the method of placement in equipoise of this tradition, it would be subsumed into three: liberation from activity, lib-eration from resting, and naked liberation. The signifi cance of those, moreover, is subsumed in this: with the profound vital point of being free of any reference point, rest within the state of reality without delib-erate activity.Four Common Meditative Experiences [dd]Experiences of abiding, unwavering, evenness, and spontaneous presenceAre posited by Garab as the four experiences of the mind and space paths.Having meditated on those profound vital points, various defi nite and indefi nite experiences arise and ultimately the pristine awareness of real-ization becomes more and more clear and stable. The sequence of pos-sible experiences is endless and cannot be estimated. However, in terms of the generic manner of arising, fi rst there is the experience of abiding TOK_8-4_Final.indd 89TOK_8-4_Final.indd 897/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgein which the conscious mind remains undivided during the meditation session without pursuing an external object. Second is the experience of unwavering meditative absorption without any conditions such as sink-ing or agitation. Third is the experience of evenness in which one rests in the sky-like equipoise of the equal fl avor of samsara and nirvana. In the subsequent cognition, one integrates the illusory-like nature of all things and obtains the total confi dence of fearlessness. Fourth is the experience of spontaneous presence, the absorption that goes beyond meditation sessions and breaks, the falling away of intellect and of phenomena. These “four experiences” (nyams bzhi ) of the mind and space paths were posited by the great awareness-holder Garab Dorjé.95Th e Esoteric Instruction Class [iii]The explanation of the sequence of meditation in the esoteric instruc-tion class of atiyoga has two parts: an overview and an extensive explanation.Overview [aa]Primordially pure trekchö and spontaneously present tögal areEsoteric instructions that make the reality of emptiness and appearance fall away.The esoteric instruction class of atiyoga is far superior to the two lower classes. One achieves breakthrough by the destruction of eff orts to ana-lyze and diff erentiate between good and bad thoughts. Thus, the antidote is approached from the direction of pristine awareness. In this esoteric instruction class of the great completion, the sequence of meditation is as follows: From the side of emptiness, primordially pure intrinsic awareness becomes free of elaboration, causing the phenomena of emp-tiness to fall away. From the side of appearance, spontaneous presence purifi es corporeal form in luminous clarity, causing the very reality of phenomena to fall away.96 The oral instructions for these two stages are primordially pure trekchö (khregs chod) and spontaneously present tögal (thod rgal).

As enhancement one does yoga such as the threefold sky.The pristine awareness of nondual union is original liberation free from accepting and rejecting, conveying one to the state where all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are the reality free of fi xation [even] to emptiness. Through this vital point, intrinsic awareness that makes no distinction whatsoever between samsara and nirvana manifestly arises as the objec-tive fi eld of reality. Then refl exive awareness matures as the forms of interlinking continuums97 and causes liberation directly on that vital point, like sparks from striking the point [of a fl int]. Just such an aware-ness itself has anyway never been encumbered in its essence by any kind of samsaric phenomena and so has exhausted the causes of taking on existence. Thus it is “original liberation” (ye grol ). Without contriving any kind of antidote, whatever arises is all free, like a snake’s coils naturally unwinding, without recourse to any outside means of liberation. Thus it is “natural liberation” (rang grol ) .All of the eight groups of consciousness, moreover, are not divided into subject and object, but are by nature liberated in the very moment of arising in great immediacy.98 Thus it is “naked liberation” (gcer grol ) .Not abiding in the three times or in any knowable object, it is “libera-tion from extremes” (mtha’ grol ) .Abiding in that way within the four great modes of liberation, one will gain certainty in the distinctive quality of this very path of naturally occurring pristine awareness—one’s own intrinsic awareness. Through that, the enlightened perspective of utterly transparent99 pristine awareness, Samantabhadra—that original, primordial, alpha-pure way of abiding just as it is—is now recognized directly in and of itself. This is “recognition directly in one’s own nature.”TOK_8-4_Final.indd 91TOK_8-4_Final.indd 917/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThat very awareness, which is not aff ected by objectifi cation, is not polluted by subjective fi xation, and is not engaged in rejecting or rem-edying; that awareness just as it is never departs from the naturally occur-ring pristine awareness of dharmak›ya. Thus, it is “decided directly upon one thing.”Whatever appears, whatever arises, all of it fi rst arose as the expres-sion of reality. Right now it abides within that reality. Ultimately, it will naturally subside within reality. Thus, “have confi dence directly in liberation.”100 To enhance these [realizations], one should do the yogas such as in the spiritual instructions of the outer, inner, and secret threefold sky.101Tögal, Crossing Over [2']This has three parts: The uncommon preliminaries that accomplish the proximate cause of the falling away of the corporeal, the main practice of the four visions that convey one to the level of falling away, and the conclusion that leads to the straight road of the esoteric instructions.Preliminaries [a']The sound of four elements, delineating samsara and nirvana,And preliminaries of three doors is the training with three leaders.The initial meditation in tögal is training in the meaning of the sounds of the four elements with the three k›yas acting as leader. It says in the Reverberation of Sound Root Tantra: 102The sequence of training in the three k›yasMakes the sense-pleasures of the elements foremost.Excellently train in the sounds of earth, water, fi re, and air,And defi nitely become accomplished.103Then there is the training in the conduct that delineates the gap between samsara and nirvana (’khor ’das ru shan) with intrinsic awareness as the leader. It states in the naturally arisen Tantra of the Single Child of the Doctrine: 104TOK_8-4_Final.indd 92TOK_8-4_Final.indd 927/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"nyingma \u0003 93Accordingly, the most fortunate one Who desires to enter the extreme secret meaning itselfMust begin with the activities of the preliminariesIn order to reverse compulsive attachmentOf the body, speech, and mind.Then there is the training in the preliminaries of the three doors with the mind as leader. At the end of the former and latter, one “falls into the natural state.”105 Through this training with the three leaders, on the common level the sins and obscurations of the three doors are refi ned away and obstacles are pacifi ed. As the supreme purpose, one is liberated in the space of enlightened body, speech, and mind. As is said:Here there are two purposes,Analyzed into divisions of common and supreme.Th e Main Practice [b']Three vital points of physical support, basic space guidance, andObjective visionary appearances; specifi cally from the path of four lamps, Four visionary appearances will convey to the level of falling away.For the main body of the practice one relies on the continuum of non-dissipating pristine awareness. For physical support, the vital point of the body is not to waver from the sitting postures of the three k›yas.106 For guidance, the vital point of basic space is not to waver from the gazes of the three k›yas.107 For visionary appearance, the vital point of the objective fi eld is to sit with the breathing relaxed, not separating aware-ness from basic space. One practices with these three vital points, or nine, if one counts the subdivisions. Specifi cally, the objectively appear-ing visions are classifi ed into “four lamps” (sgron ma bzhi ). The four visionary appearances will come from meditation based on those as the path. Ultimately they will convey one to the level of the falling away of phenomena.The four lamps are the watery lamp of the far-reaching eyes, the lamp of the basic space of awareness, the lamp of empty vital essence spheres, TOK_8-4_Final.indd 93TOK_8-4_Final.indd 937/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeand the lamp of naturally occurring wisdom.108 The fi rst of these four is the gateway that causes arising, since it is through the eyes that one sees the external manifestation of the radiance of the awareness aspect. The second is the ground from which the inner basic space arises externally as the radiance of clarity. The third is the support that activates the arising forms. And the fourth is the unerring abiding nature of higher insight, the very nature of awareness arising as quintessence and not as [gross] object. Concerning these classifi cations, it says in the [Great] Natural Arising [of Intrinsic Awareness]: 109In the mandala of the empty skyFour lamps uncontrivedManifest clearly by unimpeded ultimate nature.The lamp of the basic space of awareness arisesIn the center of the space of the empty sky asThe body of light, the inherent nature of basic space.Unimpeded, it manifests clearly without impediment.The k›ya of Mind endowed with fi ve pristine awarenessesArises in the manner of interlinking chains.

As indicated by this, the awareness of higher insight views the vajra chains and through gradual familiarization trains in the stages of the four visionary appearances. The visionary appearance of the direct perception of reality opens the doors of pure realms. From that, the spheres mature into forms as one approaches the visionary appearance of the increase of meditative experience, which will result in the nirm› ̊ak›ya.

Then, once all appearances are purifi ed in the mandala of the single great essence sphere, whatever mentally designated phenomena there are will fall away and even the fi xation on reality itself will fall away and one will behold the visionary appearance of the dharmak›ya.110 As it is taught in the Reverberation of Sound: Seeing with the direct perception of realityTranscends the limits grasped by mental assumptions.The increase of appearances of meditative experience,Eclipses deluded appearances andActualizes the pristine awareness of the intermediate state.The visionary appearance of awareness reaching full measureTranscends the appearances of the path of realization of the three k›yas.The visionary appearance of reality falling awayCuts the continuity of cyclic existence in three realms.Conclusion [c']Three restings grasp the extent, strike with the nail of three attainments.Demonstrating the measure of liberation with fourfold confi dence is breakthrough.The aids or props for reaching the full measure of the four visionary appearances are the three unwavering states of the body that nail the vital points, the three unwavering states of speech that clear the path, and the three unwavering states of mind that ripen into the maturity of fruition. These three [sets of three] unwavering states should be the foundation. The three restings of the body make one free of activity. Through the three restings of the energy currents one grasps the extent of the unborn. The three restings of appearance cause one to gain confi dence in irrevers-ibility. With these three [sets of three] restings111 one grasps the extent, and if practice reaches its full measure, one attains control over birth and can actually benefi t others.

AtıŸa had been the senior teacher at the monastic university of VikramaŸıla for many years, and had studied with numerous great mas-ters. He came reluctantly to Tibet in 1042 at the age of sixty, intending to stay for only three years. He spent the next twelve years until his death teaching in Tibet, emphasizing primarily the madhyamaka philosophy and the monastic discipline of the vinaya. He brought together scrip-ture and spiritual instructions in his composition A Lamp for the Path to Awakening, a great treatise that fully presents the stages of the path for the three types of individuals. Boundless openings to the sacred dharma are contained within that work.Jamgön Kongtrul describes three lineages that developed from AtıŸa’s teachings: the general precept lineage or “Kagyu,” and the two particular traditions of the Old and the New Kadampa.* AtıŸa had innumerable students in India and Tibet, but the fi rst Tibetan disciple, the one who had carried the invitation to him, was the translator Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa (1011-1064). He attended him for nineteen years and obtained nearly all of his instructions as well as those of other masters. This root lineage became known as Naktso Kagyu. Rongpa Chaksorwa and others also received many mantric instructions from Naktso and, as proph-esied, built a monastery in Rong Laksor. A special lineage fi rst arose from “Rong’s four boys,” as the fi rst disciples were known.

Ngok Lekpai Sherab (the uncle of Ngok Loden Sherab) established the monastery of Sangpu Neutok in 1073. AtıŸa thus precipitated boundless dharma activity. The Old Kadampa is the precept lineage of Dromtön Gyalwai Jungné (1005-1064), AtıŸa’s main disciple. It is known as the Precious Kadam Embodying Seven Deities and Dharmas, a reference to its practice of four exalted deities and the Three Baskets. Dromtön’s three main disciples were Potowa, Chen-ngawa, and Puchungwa. The three great teaching systems of scriptures, spiritual instructions, and esoteric instructions that they transmitted produced lineage-holders who were all great bodhisat-tvas. It is clearly an excellent, unerring path to enlightenment. There are six scriptures for study in this tradition: the Garland of Birth Stories and the Selected Sayings of the Buddha, which develop faith; Asaºga’s Levels of the Bodhisattva Path, part of the Levels of Yoga Practice, and Mai-treya’s Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras, which develop meditation; and ⁄antideva’s Compendium of Trainings and the Way of the Bodhisattva, which develop conduct. Potowa Rinchen Sal (1027/1031-1105) transmit-ted these to his pair of students Langri Tangpa (1054-1123) and Sharawa Yonten Drak (1070-1141). The latter passed them on to Tumtön Lodrö Drak (1106-1166), who established the monastery of Nartang, where this explanation system is maintained. Another system of explanation based on the spiritual instructions of the four noble truths was passed from Dromtön’s second disciple, Chen-ngawa Tsultrim Bar (1038-1103), to his student Ja-yulpa Zhönnu Ö (1075-1138) and others. Known as the Chen-nga Kagyu, it became an excellent system focused on the practice lineage. It is thought to be currently held by the Dakpo Kagyu. The eso-teric instructions of the Sixteen Vital Essences, with their empowerments and guidances, as well as AtıŸa’s “precious volume,” fell to Pu chungwa Zhönnu Gyaltsen (1031-1106). They were passed down through a one-to-one lineage until the time of Zhönnu Lodro of Nartang. From then they opened up and were absorbed into the Kamtsang Kagyu lineage and the Gelukpa lineage through Gendun Drup (1391-1474), the fi rst Dalai Lama.The New Kadampa refers to what is now called Gedenpa or Gelukpa. The masters of the Old Kadampa had already spread their teachings throughout Tibet and Kham, establishing monasteries and centers every-where. Take, for example, the fact that the four thoughts that turn the TOK_8-4_Final.indd 98TOK_8-4_Final.indd 987/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"kadampa \u0003 99mind and other instructions of the stages of the path are the beginning practice in every teaching system of old and new schools. In later times, however, the Kadampa establishments themselves declined somewhat. Then an emanation of MañjuŸrı, Tsongkhapa Lozang Drakpa (1357-1419), appeared like the Buddha coming for a second time. He taught primarily from the Kadampa system of scriptural explanation, but also incorporated the signifi cance of the profound esoteric instructions from all three systems. His seminal work, The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, is the life force of the instructions. The quali-ties of this holy one are unimaginable. Even the yogini Machik Lapdrön (1055-1153) predicted that there would never be another like this holy being or like the Gyalwang Karmapa for as long as the Sage’s doctrine remains. His activities were also incredible, like the establishment of the Great Prayer Festival and many other deeds. In short, Kongtrul says, the fact that the Buddhadharma remains in Tibet as predicted is due entirely to the benefi cence of the great Tsongkhapa.To sum up, the Kadampa tradition started with the teaching of Jowo Jé AtiŸa, was opened up by Dromtönpa Rinpoché, extended and propa-gated by his three disciples, and had become truly widespread by the time of Langri Tangpa, Sharawa, Ja-yulpa and others.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 99TOK_8-4_Final.indd 997/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"TOK_8-4_Final.indd 100TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1007/10/09 1:59:02 PM7/10/09 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Esoteric Instructions of the Kadampa....

Also the completion phases of those are fi rst, the guide to the view; second, compassion pervading space; third, the fi ve recollections; and fourth, the common and special six dharmas.The media for expression are the Three Baskets or canonical collec-tions of Vinaya, Sutra, and Abhidharma, and the subject matter is ethi-cal discipline, meditative absorption, and wisdom, which comprise the three higher trainings.3 These are practiced according to the sequence of the doctrine exactly as it is taught in the precious excellent speech of the Buddha, and not in word only.Specifi c Explanation of the Special Esoteric Instructions [2]...the special esoteric instruction system isFive recollections: guru, deity, mantra, compassion, and emptiness.As extensions of that, the relative and Ultimate sixteen vital essences are integrated on the path.Of the three Kadam traditions,4 the holders of the tradition of esoteric instructions that descend from Puchungwa5 particularly uphold what the exalted T›r› told the victor Dromtönpa:6Remember the source of refuge, the guru.The body is the nature of the deity.Through speech, continuously repeat the mantra.Consider each and every being as your parent.Discern the emptiness of the abiding nature of mind.Once these fi ve arise,Purify all roots of virtue.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 102TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1027/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"kadampa \u0003 103The topic of this instruction is the recollection of the fi ve practices of the guru, deity, mantra, compassion, and emptiness. As an extension of that, the fi fteen relative vital essences and the one ultimate vital essence—six-teen altogether—are integrated on the path. Those fi fteen relative vital essences are fi ve vital essences of the environment as support, six vital essences of the supported beings, including the gods, and the four vital essences of the root and lineage gurus.7Th e Stages of the Path to Awakening with Th ree Systems Combined into One [3]The third section has four parts: a general explanation of the manner of instruction, a specifi c description of the stages of the path, a presentation of the way to include all of those, and a supplementary comment on the special branches. Th e Manner of Instruction [a]Three traditions combined into one: the stages of the path to awakeningHas four greatnesses and reliance on a root spiritual mentor.The system that combines into one the practices of the three traditions from the source texts, the spiritual instructions, and the esoteric instruc-tions is called the stages of the path to awakening. While uniting the presentation of all the dharmas on the methods to attain enlightenment directly or indirectly, the root of the practice does not fall outside the two kinds of awakening mind (Skt. bodhicitta). Therefore, it is the very thing that an ordinary individual practices as the single initial stage. The combining of the esoteric instructions into the stages of the path is taught in the Ornament of True Realization,8 where it says, “⁄r›vakas who are seeking peace....”The author of the source text for these instructions is the single god of the Snow Ranges, the Glorious Great Lord AtıŸa himself. He com-posed many of the sources for this tradition, but the one that is like the root of the total and complete body of the path is A Lamp for the Path to Awakening.9 This primary text is said by the great learned masters of this tradition to be endowed with fourfold greatness: (1) It has the great-ness of [inspiring the] realization that there is nothing contradictory in TOK_8-4_Final.indd 103TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1037/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe doctrine, because it presents all the excellent speech of the Buddha from anything in the great or lesser vehicles as the path by which a single individual can attain enlightenment. (2) It has the greatness that all the excellent speech of the Buddha will arise as personal instructions, once one has found certainty in the vital points of this path. One need not accumulate the karma of rejecting the dharma by seeking the vital points of practice elsewhere, since the explanations of the sutras, tantras, and commentaries are the dharma. (3) It has the greatness that one will easily understand the entirety of the victors’ intentions based on this sacred esoteric instruction. (4) And it has the greatness of reversing the bad intelligence that thinks one should learn some parts of the excellent speech of the victors but that some are unnecessary. This great malprac-tice is automatically prevented by just knowing that these instructions teach the direct and indirect methods of enlightenment and that there-fore one should practice them.10This profound dharma tradition is also called “the stages of entering the doctrine,” “the stages of the path for three persons,” “the stages of the awakening path,” and “the aid to entering the great chariot.” To accomplish buddhahood, henceforth one only needs to enter into this great path tradition.Having entered this dharma, in order to present it one must fi rst cor-rectly rely on a qualifi ed virtuous spiritual mentor. This is the root of all paths and the source of all happiness. The way to do this was mentioned briefl y above.11Th e Stages of the Path [b]This has three parts: training in the stages of the common path for a person of small scope, training in the stages of the common path for a person of medium scope, and training in the stages of the exceptional path for a person of great scope.Th e Stages of the Common Path for a Person of Small Scope [i]Contemplating human life, impermanence, and suff ering of bad existences,Desiring one’s own emancipation, one goes for refuge in the Three Jewels.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 104TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1047/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"kadampa \u0003 105The eight concerns are naturally liberated and faith is totally pure.This is the meditation on the stages of the path for a person of small scope.Once one has received the instructions from a virtuous spiritual mentor and begins meditation on the stages of the path, if a genuine desire to fi nd the meaning of one’s life arises then that is the inner inspiration for accomplishing it. In order to induce that, one meditates on the precious human life with its eight freedoms and ten endowments,12 contemplat-ing—by means of causes, examples, and numbers—how diffi cult it is to obtain. Then, if the attitude of pursuing this life is not reversed, an intense pursuit of the next world will not arise. So next one actively med-itates on the impermanence of this fl eeting body that has been obtained and how one will wander in bad existences after death. At this point, one will feel afraid of the suff erings of bad existences. When a genuine attitude of desiring release from cyclic existence is born, it will produce a heartfelt confi dence in the qualities of the Three Jewels, who can pro-vide a refuge from suff ering. And so one will abide by the common vows of going for refuge. One’s previous impulsive pursuit of this life and lip service to the next life will be reversed, and the next life will take precedence while the activities of this life will become mere accessories. The fetters of the eight worldly concerns, such as pleasure in possession and displeasure in dispossession,13 will be liberated in their own ground. With totally pure inspired faith,14 the stages of the path for a person of small scope will be born in one’s mindstream. In the beginning one should meditate until this defi nitely becomes part of one’s being. Th e Stages of the Common Path for a Person of Medium Scope [ii]Believing in cause and eff ect, seeing the problems of samsara,With an attitude of genuine desire to eliminate its cause, karma and affl iction,One pursues emancipation, certainty of release, and pure discipline.This is the meditation on the stages of the path for a person of medium scope.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 105TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1057/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeNot content with just that, one induces by many methods the faith that believes in karmic cause and eff ect, which is the basis of all positive action. With that stabilized, one exerts the eff ort to engage in virtue and reject nonvirtue, continually engaging the path of the four pow-ers.15 Then one contemplates again and again the general and specifi c problems of cyclic existence (Skt. sa ̇s›ra) until one sees its defects. Once one recognizes that karma and affl ictive emotion are the causes that produce cyclic existence, the attitude of genuine desire to eliminate them arises and one then pursues emancipation. That path entails the three trainings16 in general and specifi cally the proper maintenance of whatever ethical discipline one has personally undertaken. If that is the case, then seeing the problems of cyclic existence will be the cause that produces the genuine attitude that desires the certainty of release from it. With that, one’s ethical discipline will be totally pure and the stages of the path of a person of medium scope will be born in one’s being. One should take up that practice and meditate.Th e Stages of the Exceptional Path for a Person of Great Scope [iii]Great love and compassion for all mother sentient beingsEngenders the awakening mind. Six perfections and four modes of attractionEnact one’s own and others’ welfare with totally pure noble intention.This is the meditation on the stages of the path for a person of great scope.Not content with even that previous stage, one must train in the third stage, the basis of the path to attaining buddhahood. One brings to mind [the thought], “Just as I have fallen into the ocean of existence, so too have all beings, all of whom have been my mothers [in many lifetimes].” In cultivating the awakening mind that has love and compassion as its root, one must exert oneself in whatever causes it to arise. Without that, practicing the six perfections and two phases17 is like making a roof without a foundation. When some semblance of that experience arises to some degree, then the aspiring mind of awakening is reinforced in ceremony and one endeavors in its precepts. One should make the TOK_8-4_Final.indd 106TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1067/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"kadampa \u0003 107aspiring mind as stable as possible. Then, in listening to the great eff ec-tiveness of the bodhisattva conduct, one distinguishes between what to reject and what to engage and develops a desire to train in that. When that has arisen, the vows of engagement are taken in ceremony and one trains in the six perfections, which ripen one’s own mindstream, and the four means of attraction18 and so on, which ripen the mindstreams of others. In particular, one should guard against the root downfalls even at the risk of one’s life and endeavor not to be tainted by the lesser and medium dissipations or infractions. If one is so tainted, one must make eff orts to restore [the vows].The last two perfections deserve special study. In becoming skilled in ways to maintain meditative stability, meditative absorption will be accomplished. One should do whatever it takes for a totally pure view of the two kinds of nonself19 to arise in one’s mindstream. Once it is found and one settles into that view, the knowledge of how to maintain it is generated. This kind of meditative stability and wisdom together are termed calm abiding and higher insight.20 Since there is no other angle besides these two, once one has taken the bodhisattva vows, they will happen within the training of those precepts. By training in that way, one will always be engaged in tremendous benefi t for oneself and others. The noble intention will be unwaveringly pure, and the stages of the path of a person of great scope will arise in one’s being. Meditate with great persistence in this purpose.These paths, however, should not be separated. Meditation on the lower paths will increase one’s desire to attain the higher, and hearing of the higher should enhance one’s desire to accomplish the lower. When meditating on them, after examining one’s thoughts, one must have an equitable attitude. If it seems that devotion to the spiritual men-tor who guides one on such a path has diminished, it will cut off the roots of all good things, so one must strive at the ways of service. Similarly, if the strength of one’s enthusiasm for practice is weak, contemplate the freedoms and endowments, or if the strength of one’s attachment to the reality of this life increases, meditate mainly on impermanence and the problems of bad existences. If it appears that one has drifted past the lim-its of the avowed precepts that one holds, then emphasize meditation on karmic cause and eff ect. If weariness with cyclic existence is modest, then the pursuit of freedom will become mere verbiage, so think about the problems of cyclic existence. If one does not have the strength of intense TOK_8-4_Final.indd 107TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1077/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeconviction to work for the welfare of sentient beings no matter what, then the root of the mahayana will be severed, so cultivate the aspiring awakening mind and its causes. If, after one has taken on the vows of the heirs of the victors and learned the conduct, the fetters of fi xating on attributes appear to be extremely strong, use rational consciousness to destroy the conceptual frame of reference that fi xates on attributes and cultivate the emptiness that is like the sky and like illusion.21 If it hap-pens that one’s mind does not dwell on the visualization and becomes a slave to total distraction, cultivate mainly the aspect of abiding in one-pointed concentration. So it has been taught by the previous masters. With these illustrations, even those situations that were not explained will be comprehensible. In short, it is taught that, without becoming partial, one needs to utilize everything appropriate to enhance virtue in one’s being.How to Include All of Th ose Paths [c]The Buddha’s words that are intended for higher states, defi nite goodness, and mahayanaAre considered to be included in this path of three stages.The reason for the necessity of all the dharma spoken by the Buddha is that it is solely for accomplishing the welfare of sentient beings. That which can be accomplished is twofold: the temporary higher states and the ultimate defi nite goodness of liberation. From the full extent of the teachings, it is those included in the actual instructions for the person of lesser scope or in the cycles of dharma in common with it that are intended for the accomplishment of the fi rst. What distinguishes a per-son of lesser scope is that he or she pursues the abundance of higher states in the next life without putting much emphasis on this life, and practices to accomplish the causes of that. It states in A Lamp for the Path: 22Know that those who by whatever meansSeek for themselves onlyThe pleasures of cyclic existenceAre persons of lesser scope.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 108TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1087/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"kadampa \u0003 109There are two kinds of defi nite goodness: emancipation that is merely liberation from samsara, and the state of omniscience. From the full extent of the teachings, it is those included in the actual teachings for the person of medium scope or in the cycles of dharma in common with it that are intended for the vehicles of Ÿr›vaka and pratyekabuddha.23 A person of medium scope is one who has given rise to weariness with the whole of existence and makes the emancipation of personal liberation from existence the goal. To that end, such a person engages the methods of the three trainings. In A Lamp for the Path24 it says:Those who seek peace for themselves alone,Turning away from worldly pleasuresAnd avoiding negative actionsAre said to be of medium scope.There are two methods for accomplishing omniscience: the mahayana of the perfections and of secret mantra. Those are both included in the dharma cycle of the person of great scope. A person of great scope is one who is compelled by great compassion to eliminate all the suff ering of sentient beings and therefore makes buddhahood the goal. Therefore such a person trains in the six perfections and the two phases of creation and completion, and so on. From A Lamp for the Path: 25Those who, through their personal suff ering,Truly want to genuinely exhaust All the suff ering of othersAre superior persons.It is for such individuals who attain awakening by both the methods of the perfections and mantra that they were taught.In general, this classifi cation into three kinds of person is mentioned often in the Summary of Ascertainment26 and the commentary to the Abhidharma Treasure27 and so on. There are two kinds of person of small scope: those who are dedicated to this life and those dedicated to the next life. Here, it is the second one. Moreover, it is one who has actually entered the unerring methods for attaining the higher states. Therefore, it is held that the entire extent of the well-spoken word of the Buddha is included in this path that applies the three attitude stages of individuals.

This being so, while not guiding people in the path of the person of small scope whose goal is the attainment of just mundane happiness, nor in the path of the person of medium scope whose goal is the attainment of their own mere eman-cipation from cyclic existence, some have made the paths common to those two a preliminary for the teaching of the path of a person of great scope. By making them branches of the training of the path of the great person, there occurs a further arrangement into common and uncom-mon paths that one should know.If one thinks, however, that it is suffi cient only to do the stage of the path of a person of great scope, there are two great necessities for guidance that distinguish each of the three kinds of persons. One is to conquer the arrogance of claiming for oneself the status of a great person in whom the attitude shared with those of small or medium scope has not arisen. Second is that there is great benefi t in all three attitudes, from best to least.Concerning the need to develop one’s attitude by stages, the protec-tor N›g›rjuna advised giving guidance in the paths of higher states and defi nite goodness by stages:29 First the teachings of the higher states,Afterwards, defi nite goodness occurs.That is because after attaining higher states,Defi nite goodness will come by stages.Also Noble Asaºga said:30And in order that bodhisattvas might bring about by stages the perfect accomplishment of what is virtuous, they fi rst present the simple dharma to those sentient beings that have child-like intelligence, and simple instructions and follow-up teach-ings that engage them. Once the bodhisattvas realize that the students have come to posses medium intelligence, they pres-ent medium dharma and medium instructions and follow-up teachings that engage them. After the bodhisattvas realize that they now posses vast intelligence, they present the profound TOK_8-4_Final.indd 110TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1107/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"kadampa \u0003 111dharma and subtle instructions and follow-up teachings that engage them. This, then, is how the conduct for the welfare of those beings falls into order.And in the Lamp Summary [of Conduct], firyadeva states:31After fi rst training in the ideas of the vehicle of the perfections, one should practice the necessary stages for engaging the man-tra. To summarize the meaning of that:For sentient beings with the karma of beginnersTo enter the ultimate truth,This method was taught by the perfect BuddhaLike the steps of a ladder. Th e Special Branches [d]The special branch is the enhancement of compassionBy the kinds of mind training to exchange oneself for others.The meditation subject at the root of the path of a person of great scope, which is the ultimate end of the three stages of the path, is relative awak-ening mind and the meditative absorptions of love and compassion. The enhancements are the types of mind training instructions of exchanging oneself for others. Furthermore, all of the guiding instructions that came directly from Lord Dromtönpa have also become special branches of the stages of the path to awakening. As for mind training, the quintessence of the practices is found in Entering the Way [of the Bodhisattva],32 the Compendium of Trainings,33 and so forth. The meaning is summarized in experiential guides such as those of the more famous Indian source texts composed by the three gurus of Lord AtıŸa, such as Guru Dharmarak ̋ita’s Wheel of Sharp Weapons and Peacock Overcoming Poison,34 Maitriyogin’s Vajra Song of Conquering Self-Fixation,35 and Serlingpa’s Smashing Down Concepts and Eighteen Dharmas to Integrate on the Path.36 There is also Ja Chekawa Yeshé Dorjé’s Condensed into Seven Points,37 and other instruction guides such as the Great Stages of the Doctrine38 and the Kadampa’s Hidden Guide.39TOK_8-4_Final.indd 111TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1117/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"TOK_8-4_Final.indd 112TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1127/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"3: LAMDRÉLineage HistoryThe great Indian adept known as VirÒpa was empowered in the ema-nated mandala of the goddess Vajra Nair›tmy› and attained the realiza-tion of the sixth bodhisattva level.* He formulated the Vajra Lines and created the instruction cycles of the Path with Its Result based on the Hevajra Tantra Trilogy for the benefi t of K›h ̊a. This is the fi rst of the nine cycles of the Path with Its Result.There is considerable divergence in identifying the other eight cycles. According to Jamgön Kongtrul, they are (1) the creation phase practices of Nine Profound Methods and the completion phase Like the Tip of a Lamp Flame by the great adept Padmavajra (Saroruha), based on the root Hevajra Tantra in Two Parts; (2) The Commentary on Awakening Mind by N›g›rjuna, based on the Guhyasam›ja Tantra; (3) Realizing Coemer-gence by Æombi Heruka, based on the Hevajra Tantra in Two Parts; (4) The Completely Perfect Path of Mudra by IndrabhÒti, based on the Vital Essence of Pristine Awareness; (5) The Inconceivable by Kudd›la, based on the Sampu ̨a Tantra; (6) Olapati by K›h ̊a (K ̧ ̋ ̊ac›rin), based on the Cakrasa ̇vara; (7) Unwritten Mah›mudr› by V›gıŸvara, based on the Guhyasam›ja (Hevajra and T›r› in other sources); and (8) Straighten-ing the Crooked by K ̧ ̋ ̊a Utsi ̨a the Immortal, based on all the mother tantras. These teachings of the nine cycles of the path were transmitted in Tibet to the great guru Drokmi Lots›wa Sh›kya Yeshé (993-1077). Drokmi had fi rst mastered all the teachings of ethical discipline, the perfections, and secret mantra under the master ⁄›ntipa and had received the Cycles of the Path from Gayadhara (d. 1103) and Vıravajra. He received the very *Synopsis based on The Treasury of Knowledge, Book 4, Part 3 (TOK 1: 520-526).

This was known as the tradition of the Hevajra esoteric instructions, now famous as Lamdré, or the Path with Its Result. The other eight cycles are called the Later Path with Its Result.Drokmi can be considered the primary source of the secret mantra in the later dissemination of dharma in Tibet, since the other two great translators in that position, Marpa Lots›wa and Gö Lots›wa , also stud-ied under him. In addition to the quintessential nine cycles of the path, he had obtained a vast number of teachings in India, including esoteric instructions from each of the masters of the six gates at N›land› Univer-sity. There he also received the transmission of VirÒpa’s very extensive explanation of the tantra with very concise esoteric instructions. This is known as the Path with Its Result without Root, because it was not based on the Vajra Lines. It is also known as the Hevajra commentarial tradition. Later esoteric instructions are also included in the Precious Excellent Words of the Path with Its Result. The transmission of the teachings of the Path with Its Result spread from Drokmi’s spiritual and physical sons. The main three transmis-sion lineages were from Drokmi’s sons Indra and Dorjé, and from his spiritual sons Drom Depa Tönchung and Sekar Chungwa, or Setön. Of the latter’s disciples, the Zhangtön brothers were the superior recipients, the Zhama siblings were the middling recipients, and Segom Jangyé was the inferior recipient. From the Zhama siblings, there was a male lineage descended from the brother Khönpuwa Chökyi Gyalpo, a female lineage from the sister Machik Zhama (1062-1149), and four combined lineages through later disciples. From among a total of eighteen well-known lin-eages, only the traditions of Zhama and Sakya survived for an extended period. Only the Sakya remains today.The Sakya lineage is traced through Sakyapa Kunga Nyingpo or “Sachen” (1092-1158), who was the exceptional upholder of the lineage of Zhangtön Chobar (1053-1135), the eldest of the brothers who were the superior recipients of Setön. This was the lineal transmission, and there was also a direct transmission from VirÒpa under extraordinary circum-stances. It is said that VirÒpa, with a retinue of four, came for one month and bestowed four profound dharmas that were not to pass from within the compound, including the Path with Its Result.

The former passed away to the pure realm without discard-ing his body, but the latter lived a long life. In a direct vision of Sachen he received the extremely direct transmission of the Path with Its Result, the Clarifi cation of the Meaning through Symbols. Then it was sequentially transmitted by Sakya Pa ̊chen (1182-1251), Chogyal Pakpa (1235-1280), and others. Later it spread into the traditions known as Ngor, Dzong, Bodong, Geluk, and numerous others.The chief among those was the Explication for the Assembly (tshogs bshad), which Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo (1382-1456) received from the great adept BuddhaŸrı (1339-1419/32). That lineage continues up to the present. The lineage from Ngakchang Zungkyi Palwa (1306-1389) is known as the Path with Its Result of the Dzong tradition. The omni-scient Kunga Namgyal (1432-1496) came from that tradition and spread the transmission known separately as the Gangkarwa (from the name of his monastery).The Explication for Disciples (slob bshad) is the Precious Excellent Words received by Tsarchen Losal Gyatso (1502-1566) from Doring Kunpangwa (1449-1524), a disciple of Dakchen Lodro Gyaltsen (1444-1495). The Tsar tradition branched off from this. In short, those great scholar adepts upheld and spread the doctrine of the Sakya tradition, causing the enlightened actions of the creation and completion phases of Hevajra to expand like a lake in summer, even in these end times.

For that reason there exist an endless number of manuals and explanatory systems about these teachings by many learned and accomplished individuals, such as the Yellow Volume of Jetsun Drakpa.4 Nevertheless, the summarized meaning of these very instructions that Lord Sachen5 gave to Gyura Aseng6 was the fi rst Tibetan source text and seems to be like the root of the teaching. Therefore at this occasion also we will draw out the mean-ing somewhat in a combined summary of the essential points in keeping with this source.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 118TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1187/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 119Th e Meditation Topics [2]This has three parts: a presentation of the path of samsara and nirvana in common, a presentation of the worldly path of the “stiff wheel,”7 and a presentation on reaching the culmination of attainment when the practice is engaged.Th e Path of Samsara and Nirvana in Common [a]Overview [i]First, the path of samsara and nirvana in common has fi ve.Extensive Explanation [ii]This has fi ve parts: the path presented as the three appearances, the path presented as three continua, the path presented as four authentic quali-ties, the path presented as four transmissions, and the path presented as fi ve interdependent connections.Th ree Appearances [aa]Impure, yogic experience, and pure—These three appearances provide the path’s foundation.The three appearances (snang ba gsum) are the impure appearance, the appearances of yogic experience, and pure appearance. Each of those has three further divisions through which it can be known: the cause of that appearance, the individual to whom that appearance arises, and the essential nature of that appearance itself. This provides the foundation of the path.The impure appearance encompasses the problems of cyclic existence, the freedoms and endowments of human life that are diffi cult to obtain, and the belief in karmic cause and eff ect. Meditation on these three sub-jects delineates the path that is held in common with the Ÿr›vakas.8 The appearance of yogic experience encompasses both those of com-mon and uncommon yogins. Common yogins give birth to common experiences in their mindstreams. The meditations that give rise to them are the three meditations of love, compassion, and the awakening mind.

The meditations that give rise to that are knowing that once one has entered the profound path of vajray›na and meditated, unimagi-nable visionary experiences will arise and that all of them are subsumed into fi fteen.9 This knowledge cuts through all doubts. Then at some point when those experiences arise they are maintained just as they occur by means of recognizing them individually. The pure appearance encompasses recollection of the unimaginable qualities of a buddha, such as the ornamental wheel of inexhaustible body, [speech, and mind], and thinking “I too will become like that,” thus engendering exceptional enthusiasm in meditation. In short, once one has thoroughly refi ned one’s being through the vehicle of the per-fections, making oneself a suitable vessel for the path of the vajray›na determines the foundation. Therefore, this path of three appearances is shared with the path of the perfections.10Th ree Continua [bb]One maintains the view of samsara and nirvana inseparable in the causal continuum.As the method continuum, one meditates on the profound path connected with the four empowerments.The qualities of fi ve k›yas and awarenesses arise in the result continuum.All practice without exception is known through the three continua.The view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana is maintained in the causal continuum of the universal ground.11 As the method contin-uum of the body, one meditates on the path in connection with the four empowerments.12 Ultimately, in the result continuum, the qualities of the fi ve k›yas and fi ve pristine awarenesses arise.13 This is a way to know all vajray›na practice without exception through the threefold division of ground, path, and result. First, the causal continuum: For those who have refi ned their mind-stream through the vehicle of the perfections and been moved by great compassion, the quickest path to enlightenment is indeed the vajray›na. However, if one wonders whether or not one has the good fortune to practice it, one does have it. To wit:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 120TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1207/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 121Depending on cause, family, renunciations, and conditions,Individuals are posited according to four aspects.14Certainty is created with these thoughts: Because in general all sentient beings have the cause, buddha nature; because, in particular, from the perspective of the proximity of accomplishment, they fall into the defi -nite family of one of the fi ve buddha families determined by means of color, shape, and so on; because whatever affl ictive emotion to be aban-doned is greatest in them determines their defi nite buddha family;15 and because due to conditions they defi nitely fall into the two types—less fortunate gradual realizers and fortunate instantaneous realizers—never-theless both of them will ultimately be suitable to practice the vajray›na. That is the practice of the causal continuum. The method continuum is the ripening empowerment and meditation on the two phases16 of the liberating path. The result continuum is the ultimate result, the attain-ment of the fi ve k›yas and fi ve pristine awarenesses.In this way all of the practices of the secret mantra without exception can be understood in the context of these three—ground, path, and result—because there is no secret mantra teaching that is not included therein.Again, if one takes the two phases as the main methods, then the causal continuum would be to receive the empowerment and make oneself a worthy vessel for meditation on the path, and the method continuum would be the meditation on the two phases of the path. The result con-tinuum would be the attainment of the fi ve k›yas that result from that.Four Authentic Qualities [cc]Scripture, narrative, esoteric instruction, and experiential practice: These four authentic qualities...The term “cutting through doubts” (spros pa gcod) should be applied to this [understanding of authenticity]. The four authentic qualities are stated in the Sampu ̨a: 17 Through authenticity of treatise, the master,Adherence to scripture, and awareness of immanent suchness,TOK_8-4_Final.indd 121TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1217/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThe secret meaning and its entityShould be known from the lineage of one-to-one, Received from the mouth of the sublime guru.To lay the meaning of this out in stages: Because the authenticity of the scripture (lung) of the authentic word (bka’) of the sugata occurred fi rst, it is the authenticity of scripture. Based on that, the treatise emerged [proclaiming that] the limit of an entity is interdependent origination, so it is the authenticity of the narrative (lo rgyus). Since those instructions are taught by the guru, it is the authenticity of the esoteric instructions of all the vajra guru masters. Since those must be brought into practice just as they were taught, what ascertains the fi rst three authentic qualities is the meditation experience of the yogin him- or herself authentically following them.18 As for the order of practicing those, fi rst one must practice the authenticity of the guru, as Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen said:19 At fi rst, to establish the authenticity of the guru, meditate until devotion in the guru is deeply felt.Then, one must put into practice the teachings of that guru for authentic experience. Those [two stages] accomplish the intention of the mighty yogin, which is the authentic treatise. And the supreme one of all authentic qualities that achieves the Buddha’s intention is the authentic scripture.The essence of the four authentic qualities is that since exceptional conviction arises in oneself, nothing else has the power to steal one’s interest. The way that they cut through doubts is in the causal contin-uum (of the three continua), [that is, by aff ecting] the affl ictive emotion that is the cause of the six types of beings, and the resulting six types of beings.20 Furthermore, the way that the four authentic qualities ascertain all the experiences of path and result should be learned from the explanations of the source text.21 Four Transmissions [dd]...and four transmissions cut through doubts.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 122TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1227/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 123It is said that all doubts about the instruction are cut through by means of the four authentic qualities and the four transmissions as soon as they are explained. The four transmissions are (1) undiminished river of empowerment, (2) unimpaired lineage of blessing, (3) unmistaken sequence22 of instruction, and (4) a satisfi ed attitude through devotion.The fi rst of those four has three parts: the undiminished nature of empowerment at the time of the cause, at the time of the path, and at the time of the result.Second, secret mantra is endowed with four culminations (mtha’): it is the culmination of practice, the culmination of meditative experience, the culmination of blessing, and the culmination of accomplishment.Third, when gathering the constituents23 through the three ways of gathering, one must know them to be one’s path and interdependent connection, just as one knows that even a dangerous, narrow bridge that is diffi cult to cross is indeed one’s path when [chased by] the manifesta-tion of obstacles such as marauding cannibal-demons or when experi-ences of fear and terror arise. Fourth, since those experiences also befell one just as the guru had taught when saying, “things like this will happen,” an exceptional con-viction arises and one develops an irreversible belief that the guru is a buddha. As for the manner of cutting through doubts, those practices of the three continua that were presented above must be possessed of the four transmissions. If any one of these four is missing, then the instructions of this tradition will not be wholly complete. Those four, furthermore, are based on the transmission of the guru ancestors. This is the way to be certain.Five Interdependent Connections [ee]Outer, inner, secret, suchness, and ultimate—Five interdependent connections demarcate the path.There are fi ve interdependent connections (rten ’brel ). The outer inter-dependent connection is obvious external appearances such as [those produced by] the reversal of energy currents and visual appearances. The inner interdependent connection is making the emanating and gather-ing of energy-mind in the palaces of the channel syllables.24 The secret TOK_8-4_Final.indd 123TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1237/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeinterdependent connection is the actualization of the four mandalas, such as the constituent elixir mandala, in the transcendent path. As for the suchness interdependent connection, on the fi rst spiritual level and above, the outer signs arise in the vital essence drops, the inner signs arise in the energy currents, and the signs of suchness arise as qualities in the mind. The ultimate interdependent connection is the dissolution of the four pulsations25 at the thirteenth level.The way those fi ve demarcate the path is that the fi rst two interdepen-dent connections demarcate the worldly path and the last three demarcate the transcendent path. Alternatively, the outer interdependent connec-tion demarcates the path of accumulation, the inner interdependent con-nection demarcates the path of application, the secret interdependent connection demarcates the path of seeing, the suchness interdependent connection demarcates the path of meditation, and the ultimate interde-pendent connection demarcates the path of no more training.In regard to this, each of these fi ve—the three appearances and so on—present a complete perfect path to enlightenment. That is because they each present the Path with Its Result common to samsara and nir-vana. Or, adding these fi ve together, it presents a single complete per-fect path. A single individual on the path to enlightenment requires these four: establishing the basis of the path, the main body of the path, cutting through the doubts about the path, and demarcating the path. Therefore they were presented in due order. Even though each of the fi ve presents a complete perfect path, there is a need to teach all fi ve. The path of the three appearances is taught because it is explained that “all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are set forth as the arising of three appearances in three diff erent circum-stances.” The path of three continua is taught in order to understand that “all phenomena are included in the single continuity of one’s own mind.” The four authentic qualities are taught because the path is quickly traversed with the arising of exceptional conviction. The path of the four transmissions is taught in order to understand that a single individual’s enlightenment is based on the exceptional transmission of the guru ancestors. And the path of fi ve interdependent connections is taught in order to understand that to traverse the levels to buddhahood through the path of vajray›na, the fi ve interdependent connections must be complete and in alignment.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 124TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1247/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 125Th e Worldly Path [b]This has two parts: an overview and an extensive explanation.Overview [i]The worldly path of the stiff wheel has two:The seven esoteric instructions and dispelling obstructions of the path.Extensive Explanation [ii]This has two parts: the seven vital points of esoteric instruction and a presentation of dispelling obstructions of the path.Th e Seven Vital Points of Esoteric Instruction [aa]The seven points are (1) the vital point of freedom26 in the impartial path through the three ways of gathering the constituents, (2) the vital point of knowing the immediate cause of meditative absorption through the three ways of mental abiding, (3) the vital point of knowing anything at all to be meditative absorption through the three experiences, (4) the vital point of maintaining whatever occurs as it is through the three warmths, (5) the vital point of knowing the particular meditative absorp-tions through the three ways of guidance on the path, (6) the vital point of knowing the demarcations of the path through the three gatherings of the constituents, and (7) the vital point of freedom from both hope and fear through the three interdependent connections. Freedom in the Impartial Path through the Th ree Ways of Gathering the Constituents [1']Three gatherings of the constituents apply to the seven impartials.The three ways of gathering the constituents are (1) those with karmic propensity gather their own constituents by themselves, (2) those with devotion gather the constituents through blessing, and (3) those with TOK_8-4_Final.indd 125TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1257/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgediligence gather the constituents through exerted eff ort. When applied to those with karmic propensity, the seven impartials are that (1) the impartial awakening of the karmic propensity (2) leads to the impartial reversal of the energy currents, (3) leading to the impartial blazing of the fi re of inner heat, (4) leading to the impartial opening of the channels, (5) leading to the impartial gathering of the constituents, (6) leading to the impartial occurrence of dissipating clairvoyance, (7) which leads to the impartial arising of nondissipating clairvoyance. Applying those seven in a similar way to devotion and to diligence, it makes twenty-one.Moreover, when the gathering of the constituents occurs in ordinary individuals, those lacking the esoteric instruction might depreciate it by saying, “it is not the gathering of the constituents,” or might exaggerate by saying, “it was done by bad spirits.” But if one understands these three ways of gathering, one will become free of those deprecations and exaggerations. Knowing the Immediate Cause of Meditative Absorption through the Th ree Modes of Mental Abiding [2']Three modes of mental abiding are realized as the immediate cause of meditative absorption.The three modes of mental abiding are the mental abiding through reversing the energy currents, the mental abiding through self-blessing of energy-mind, and the mental abiding through combining together with the support.27 These three aspects of reversing the energy currents, and so on, arise appropriately from residual karma, devotion, or diligence as described above. From that, physical experiences, mental experiences, and so on cause unimaginable meditative absorptions to arise. There-fore, the reversal of the energy currents, and so on, should be known as the immediate direct cause and the residual karma, and so on, as the indirect cause. Knowing Anything at All to Be Meditative Absorption through the Th ree Experiences [3']Whatever arises of three experiences is meditative absorption.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 126TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1267/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 127Of the three kinds of meditation experience, body experiences are the leaping and jumping, and so forth, that occur due to the force of medi-tation causing the energy currents to be reversed inwards. Mind expe-riences are experiences of dread and despair, desire, and aggression, and so on that occur due to having hit the vital point of the channel syllables. Dream experiences are to dream of horses and other expres-sions of natural movement due to hitting the vital point of energy cur-rents. Those lacking esoteric instruction explain the discomfort of the body and the suff ering of the mind and such that occur as the normal course of affl ictive emotions. Dream experiences are explained as nor-mal dreams and are not known to be meditative absorption. But in this tradition, whatever arises as the three experiences coming from the gathering and projecting of energy-mind is known exclusively as meditative absorption. Maintaining as It Occurs Whatever Arises through the Th ree Warmths [4']What has arisen is maintained as it occurs, whether or not the three warmths [arise in order].The three warmths28 are the warmth preceded by thought, the warmth of gathering the nine constituents,29 and the warmth of blazing and gather-ing. The cause is the interdependent connections of the energy currents and mind coming into alignment, whether or not in order, and the result is the arising of the warmths, whether or not in order. The recog-nition of any of those as being without characteristics and maintaining that [recognition is what is meant by] maintaining as it occurs.30Knowing the Particular Meditative Absorptions through the Th ree Modes of Guidance [5']Three modes of guidance distinguish the particular experiences.There is guidance by energy currents, guidance by constituent elixir, and guidance by channel syllables. They are called the three modes of guid-ing that are like a captain. The experience that is born from that guid-ance is the gathering of the constituents. At the fi rst gathering, there is TOK_8-4_Final.indd 127TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1277/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgegreat discomfort of the channels and energy currents. At the middle, the discomfort diminishes. At the fi nal gathering, one is free of discomfort and gains the ability to dispel harmful conditions, such as the physical disturbance from the elements and so forth. These are the particular experiences of being guided by energy currents. At the fi rst gathering, the meditative absorption is unclear and unstable. At the middle, it is clear and more stable. At the fi nal gathering, there is no diff erence between formal meditation and post-meditation, and one cannot be aff ected by external conditions. These are the particular experiences of being guided by constituent elixir. At the fi rst gathering, indefi nite deluded appear-ances arise, evoking dread and despair. At the middle, indefi nite visual appearances arise, experiences and visual appearances of the six realms. Finally, the very defi nite lucid appearances arise, causing one to think that the experiences of meditative absorptions up to the pinnacle of exis-tence have occurred. These are the particular experiences of being guided by the channel syllables. In this way, those three diff erent meditative experiences come about from the three individual modes of guidance, and one should know the particular distinctions.These three modes of guidance on the path are demarcated by the three gatherings of the constituents on the worldly path and by the four culminations of accomplishment on the transcendent path. Although these two ways certainly occur, here I have explained by simply applying the three gatherings.Knowing the Demarcations of the Path through the Th ree Gatherings of the Constituents [6']The demarcations are known by applying three examples to three gatherings.This is how the demarcations are known by applying three examples to the three gatherings: At the fi rst gathering of the constituents, the force of meditation causes the energy currents to go to all the vital points of the channels. This slightly loosens the channel knots, causing discomfort in the channels and energy. It is like the example of the winter wind with its sharp biting edge. At the middle gathering, the knots are loos-ened more and the energy-mind becomes slightly limpid, quieting the discomfort of the channel energy. For example, it is like the diminished TOK_8-4_Final.indd 128TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1287/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 129sharpness of the spring winds. At the fi nal gathering, the channel knots are more and more loosened and the energy-mind becomes very limpid, producing the many qualities of meditative absorption. The example is the wind in summer, free of its biting edge. In this way, when there is great discomfort in the channel energy, the quieting of discomfort, and the occurrence of boundless qualities of meditative absorption, one knows undoubtedly that one has arrived at the fi rst, middle, and fi nal stages of gathering in order. Freedom from Both Hope and Fear through the Th ree Interdependent Connections [7']Three interdependent connections contain all causes and conditions, freeing one from hope and fear.The three interdependent connections are the interdependent connec-tion of reversing the energy currents, the interdependent connection of visual appearances, and the interdependent connection of dreams. The fi rst is when the energy currents are reversed inwards due to the force of meditation, causing the body to jump and leap and so forth.The second has three parts. The visual appearances associated with the body’s channels are visions such as mountain cliff s, due to the energy-mind entering the constrictions of the thirty-two knots in the right and left channels.31 The visual appearances associated with the channel syl-lables are visions such as the six realms, due to the energy-mind gather-ing in the syllables of the six realms. The visual appearances associated with the constituent elixir are visions such as the fi ve buddha families, due to the elixir’s quintessence gathering together into the heart-syllable bhrum, and others. Third, the interdependent connection of dream is when those visions as the primary cause and the state of sleep as the condition make those visions occur in dreams.What causes those three interdependent connections to occur are the physical channels, the channel syllables, the constituent elixir, and the energy currents. Those are all contained as part of one’s own body and do not depend on any external causes and conditions. Therefore, one does not hope for the spiritual power of seeing visual appear-ances of buddhas and such, or fear obstacles such as being attacked by TOK_8-4_Final.indd 129TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1297/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge cannibal-demons.

What type of person is affl icted by obstructions or obstacles? There are two kinds of yogins who fall into the partiality of either method or wis-dom, and one yogin of total integration. Of these three, it is the fi rst two types that can be affl icted with obstacles, but not the last. Thus, a yogin who is partial to skillful methods has four obstacles and eight protections from them. The four obstacles are (1) on entering the path, there is the obstacle of worldly concerns; (2) once having entered it, there is the obstacle of external devils; (3) when the mind is somewhat stabilized, the devils’ increasing force is an obstacle; and (4) when there is great stability, there is the obstacle of not recognizing meditative absorp-tion. The eight protections are, for the fi rst obstacle, (1) fi rm faith. For the second obstacle, (2) protection circles, (3) repetition of mantra, and (4) mantra knots. For the third obstacle, since (5) all phenomena are the appearance of mind itself, and (6) mere refl ections, (7) they are never divorced from the nature of the ocean of suchness. And for the fourth obstacle, (8) the knowledge of the dependent nature of interdependent connections. Those eight protect the practitioner.The four obstacles for those who are partial to wisdom are (1) the obstacle of generating experiences and suff ering, (2) the obstacle of man-ifested forms, (3) the obstacle of uttered sounds, and (4) the obstacle of changing views and tenets. The eight protections are that when those four are done by external devils, one is protected by the four tests32 as the antidotes, and when done by internal devils, they are averted by the symbols of the four empowerments.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 130TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1307/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 131The fourteen common protections are protection against the six con-taminations,33 the six emissions of vital essence,34 and the two obscu-rations.35 Concerning the seventy great vital points of clearing away obstructions, it is said in the Summary: 36For discomfort in the channels, total release is most valuable,Discomfort in the energy currents is averted by reinforcement.For paralysis of energy currents, the three aspects ofTotal release, blessing, and bliss meditation are taught.Total release for discomfort in the channels is to direct the conscious-ness to the place where it occurs, and by drilling the awareness into it, it is pacifi ed. Reinforcement for discomfort in the energy currents is to inhale the energy current inside and press down on its location. When it seems to become impossible, one inhales again and presses. There are three methods of fi xing paralysis of the energy currents. Total release is the same as above. There are six kinds of blessing: (1) the blessing of the holy guru, (2) the blessing of the favored deity, (3) the blessing of the outer and inner ̃›kinıs, (4) the blessing of the mahayana sutras and profound tantras, (5) the blessing of the variety of appearance, and (6) the blessing of profound interdependent connection. Two kinds of bliss meditation are taught: based on the upper waves of enjoyment and based on the lower secret union. The six instructions for dispelling obstructions are, in relation to the view, (1) meditation on expelling poison, (2) relying on elixir, and (3) directed attention. In relation to meditative stability, they are (4) the meditation on expelling poison, (5) relying on elixir, and (6) total release. These can be learned in detail from the explanations of the source text in the section on the six instructions.Removing obstruction with the mandala circle refers to uniting with the supreme bliss-emptiness of the blazing, wavering, and stabilizing of the vital essence by means of the path of the mandala circle. As stated in the Summary: 37Vital essence blazes and wavers and stabilizes,These three aspects produce bliss-emptiness supreme.Discomfort in the vital essences occurs during blazing—Joining [the energy currents] it is stabilized.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 131TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1317/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThe four animal movements reverse it,And the waverings of vital essence in the body are stopped.In order to suff use it everywhere and stabilize it,Rotate the body like a pestle andThrow the energy lasso with the four limbs.The conduct of a small child stabilizes it.Thus it is taught that these methods will remove however many obstruc-tions there are on the path and bring supreme spiritual powers.Summary [2']In summary, the path of four empowerments has eight views and culminations of attainment.Faults are qualities, and obstacles are taken up as spiritual powers.When whatever appears is understood as experience, one is naturally liberatedTo summarize the points of the practice in the instructions on the Path with Its Result, once one has been made into a worthy vessel in the four empowerments, such as the vase empowerment, one meditates on the four paths, such as the creation phase. From this, the four views arise, such as the three essential natures, on the worldly path. On the tran-scendent path, one reaches the four culminations of accomplishment. Thus, these eight views and culminations summarize the necessity for meditation on the path.The four views are as follows: (1) the view of the vase empowerment in connection with meditation on the mandala is the three aspects of the essence—the experiences of the apparent aspect, the empty aspect, and the union aspect—which are primarily the experiences of nonconceptu-ality. These three each possess three characteristics: they are reality (chos nyid, Skt. dharmat›) free of mental imputation, a relative nature (chos can, dharmin) that has no connection to ignorance, and diff erent facets of that singular essence.(2) The view of the secret empowerment is the four naturally occur-ring pristine awarenesses in which clarity is primary. Due to the inter-dependent connection of some of the particular channel energies and TOK_8-4_Final.indd 132TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1327/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"lamdré \u0003 133vital essences dissolving in the central channel, a semblance of intense affl ictive emotion appears. This is the pristine awareness on the path of naturally occurring affl ictive emotion. A semblance of intense discur-sive thought is the pristine awareness of naturally occurring discursive thought. The appearance of a mixture of lofty and lowly experiences is the pristine awareness of naturally occurring mixed-up blankness.38 The arising of the pristine awareness of clarity-emptiness without center or limit is the great naturally occurring pristine awareness of the path, luminous and light. (3) The view of the empowerment of wisdom is the four joys in descending sequence, in which bliss is primary. This becomes sixteenfold when each is subdivided from the point of view of place, time, what is to be abandoned, and the essential nature.(4) The view of the fourth empowerment is the four joys in ascending sequence, in which nondual bliss-emptiness is primary. These are the epitome of the result that is in accord with the cause, the fully ripened result, the results of human actions, and the result of freedom.The four culminations of attainment are the ultimate results of attain-ment from meditation on the paths of the four empowerments. From the fi rst through the sixth spiritual level, the culmination of attainment of the vase empowerment is called “the inseparability of samsara and nir-vana” (’khor ’das dbyer med) because it is mainly the wisdom of realiza-tion of the equality of samsara and nirvana. From the seventh up to the tenth level, the culmination of attainment of the secret empowerment is unmixed and completely perfect, in which the individual mastery of the four correct awarenesses [enables one] to teach the dharma without mixing it up, in harmony with the ideas and language of each sentient being. At the eleventh and twelfth levels, the culmination of attainment of the wisdom empowerment is bliss-emptiness of lesser extent, because the range of bliss-emptiness is measurable. At the lower half of the thir-teenth level, the culmination of attainment of the fourth empowerment is called bliss-emptiness of greater extent because the range of pristine awareness is immeasurable due to the ability of moment-by-moment awareness to pervade all that is inanimate and animate. To summarize all the methods for dispelling obstructions: knowing that faults such as the affl ictive emotions and so on are one’s path and auspicious connection, they are taken as the eight qualities.39 Gathering TOK_8-4_Final.indd 133TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1337/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe energy-mind in the syllable ksha in the navel, the forms of obstacles such as being attacked by cannibal-demons are taken as spiritual powers.

The entire variety of greatness for oneself is perfected. When the support, the four mandalas, is transformed then the univer-sal ground itself, the supported, is also transformed. Then the stains along with their habitual patterns are permanently abandoned and the fi ve k›yas—the four k›yas and the extremely pure and obscuration-free svabh›vikak›ya—are actualized. The uncommon transformation is that the physical channels transform into the nirm› ̊ak›ya, the channel syl-lables into sa ̇bhogak›ya, the constituent elixir into dharmak›ya and great bliss, and the core energy current of pristine awareness transforms into the svabh›vikak›ya. At that time, without wavering from the state of the equalness of space and pristine awareness, there occurs the greatness for others: the unceasing activity for whoever needs to be tamed according to the con-stitution, capability, and interest of each being. The greatness for both self and others is to become enlightened together with the entourage as one group.In short, the practice of the three appearances provides the foundation of the path, the three continua make up the main body of practice, the four authentic qualities and the four transmissions clear up doubts about practice, and the fi ve interdependent connections demarcate the path.

This is the way of guidance in the extensive path.To condense that into the middling path, there are five topics with their subdivisions: What causes the birth of meditative absorption, what the meditative absorption is, its benefits, dispelling obstructing phenomena, and how to measure the levels of the path. Since there are no vajra lines concerning this, it is known as the “Path and Result without Root” (rtsa ba med pa’i lam ’bras).Bestowal of the prediction of practice and the application of the basic words of its own source text40 [to the three continua], application of them to the path, application of them to the esoteric instructions for common practice, and the application of them to the result is the concise path.There are what are known as the four great pillars of the path for the practice of those paths and for the generation of successful realization and the fi ve dharmas for the birth of realization. Of those, the four great pillars are to lead according to the source text, to lead by six vital esoteric instructions, to lead by eleven vital esoteric instructions, and to lead by means of the three faculty levels: superior, moderate, and inferior.41 Of those, here we have been discussing the system of guidance accord-ing to the source text, which is currently the most famous tradition of guidance.These profound instructions are famous as being the completion phase of the Hevajra Tantra. They are not found, however, in the words of the actual teaching of that tantra. They do appear in the very clear exposition in the same terms in the early translations of the Heruka Galpo Tantra,42 the fragmentary section of the Rampant Elephant Tan-tra,43 and the Stainless Confession King Tantra.44 Therefore, it is actually the same kind of system as in the general highest yoga completion phases of the two traditions of the six dharmas.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 135TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1357/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"TOK_8-4_Final.indd 136TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1367/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"4: MARPA KAGYULineage HistoryThe lineage of esoteric instructions that started in Tibet with Marpa the Translator is traced to the great Indian adept Tilopa (or Telopa, as Kongtrul has it, 988-1086).* He received the teachings from two sources: a long or lineal succession and direct transmission. There are a number of confl icting versions of the famous four transmissions of lineal succes-sion. Kongtrul cites Telopa himself, who gives his four human gurus as Cary›pa, from whom he received the inner heat practice; N›g›rjuna, from whom he received illusory body and luminous clarity instructions; Lav›pa, from whom he received dream yoga; and the ̃›kinı Sukhasiddhı, or Subhaginı, who bestowed the instructions on the intermediate state and transference. In addition to these, Telopa heard instructions on the practice of wisdom based on another’s body from the middle IndrabhÒti and on entering the residence of another’s body from Mata ̇gi.Concerning the direct lineage, Telopa himself said, “Telopa has no human guru—my guru is the Omniscient One.” In other words, Telopa heard the instructions of the four tantra classes directly from the Bud-dha Vajradhara. Then Vajrayoginı entrusted him with the treasury of the Three Gem Cycles of the hearing lineage, which contains all the quintessential instructions. In the presence of Telopa, the great pa ̊ ̃ita N›ropa (1016-1100) per-formed twelve great hardships and ultimately internalized the entire meaning of secret mantra based on words and symbols, and became an adept. His student was Lhodrak Marpa Chökyi Lodro (1002/12-1097). Marpa traveled to India three times, spending a total of sixteen years *Synopsis based on The Treasury of Knowledge, Book 4, Part 3 (TOK 1: 526-533).TOK_8-4_Final.indd 137TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1377/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeand seven months attending N›ropa. During that time he received the instructions, explanations, and empowerments of many tantras, primar-ily Hevajra and Guhyasam›ja. In particular, on his third visit he spent six months at the hermitage of Pu ̋pahari, or Pullahari, during which time he received the complete hearing lineage of Cakrasa ̇vara from a direct manifestation of Telopa. He also studied with many other Indian adepts. His two main masters, N›ropa and Maitrıpa, empowered him as a regent of the victorious ones to convert Tibet. So this Master Great Translator commands two great teaching traditions of explanatory tan-tras and practice lineages. Marpa had innumerable disciples and many lineages originated with the Marpa Kagyu. Four major transmissions are distinguished here: the Four Pillars, the Rechung Kagyu, the Dakpo Kagyu, and the Kamtsang Kagyu. The Four Pillars were Marpa’s main students: Ngogtön Chödor of Zhung (1036-1102), Tsurtön Wang-ngé of Dol, and Metön Tsönpo of Tsangrong, who received mainly the exposition transmission. The fourth was Mila Shepa Dorjé (1052-1135), who received mainly the trans-mission of the practice lineage. The great Milarepa was known as “the single earring of the snow lands,” and was identical to the mighty adepts of India. He is known to have actualized the ultimate state of unity in a single lifetime, and tamed innumerable human and nonhuman beings. His name is famous throughout the world. Of his many excellent dis-ciples, the holders of the hearing lineage, who are like the sun and the moon, are especially exalted. The Rechung Kagyu originated with Milarepa’s heart-son who was like the moon, Rechung Dorjé Drakpa (1083-1161). He was adopted by the pair Machik Drupai Gyalmo and Tepupa Drimé Shenyen and they bestowed the quintessence of the heart-treasure instructions. These were brought back from India and formulated as The Later Dharma Cycle of the Formless Æ›kinı (Lus med mkha’ ’gro’i chos skor phyi ma). The Treasury of the Hearing Lineage was passed mainly to Gyalwa Khyung Tsangpa (b. 1115) and from him to Machik Angjo. From her the lineage continued through to Drogön Tsangpa Gyaré (1161-1211), who founded an extensive teaching tradition in the Drukpa Kagyu. Other practices originating with Rechungpa continued in many of the other lineages.The Dakpo Kagyu originated with Milarepa’s disciple who was like the sun, the monk Tsojé or the Incomparable Dakpo Lhajé, also known as Gampopa (1079-1153). He taught his regular disciples the Kadampa TOK_8-4_Final.indd 138TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1387/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 139stages of the path and the meditative absorption from the sutra tradition that is adorned with the name mah›mudr›. He taught the uncommon mah›mudr› of the mantra connected to Lama Mila’s path of methods to his extraordinary disciples. “Four Great” lineages descended from his four main disciples: the Barom Kagyu from Barompa Darma Wangchuk (1127-1199/1200), the Pakdru Kagyu from Pakdru Dorjé Gyalpo (1110-1170), the Kamtsang Kagyu from Khampa Usé, or Lord Dusum Khyenpa (1110-1193), and the Tsalpa Kagyu from Zhang Tsalpa Tsöndru Drakpa (1123-1193). At the main seat of Gampo, the succession was held by Dakpo and his two nephews, their student Dakpo Duldzin, later by the great scholar-practi-tioner Tashi Namgyal (1512-1587), and others in a continuous succession up until the present. This is known as the Dakpo Kagyu, making fi ve lineages.“Eight Lesser” or later lineages originated from the students of Glori-ous Pakmo Drupa (Pakdru Dorjé Gyalpo). These are the Drigung Kagyu from Jikten Sumgön (1143-1217), the Taklung Kagyu from Tangpa Tashi Palwa (1142-1210), the Tropu Kagyu from Drogön Gyaltsa (1118-1195), the Lingré Kagyu from Lingré Padma Dorjé (1128-1188), the Martsang Kagyu from Chöjé Marpa Druptop, the Yelpa Kagyu from Yelpa Yeshé Tsek (1134-1194), the Yazang Kagyu from Zarwa Yeshé Sengé (d. 1290), and the Shuksep Kagyu from Nyipu Gyergom Chenpo (Tsultrim Sengé, 1144-1204). These are known altogether as the “Four Pairs and Eight Singles.” Each one of them was a thriving hub of scholar-practitioners with boundless dharma transmissions, seats, and activities.The Drukpa Kagyu is the lineage of the students of Tsangpa Gyaré, who was the spiritual son of Lingré Padma Dorjé. His principal disciple, Götsangpa Gönpo Dorjé (1189-1258), gave rise to the Upper Druk lin-eage. Gyalwa Yangönpa (1213-1287/8) was in this lineage. Lorepa Darma Wangchuk (1187-1250) produced the Lower Druk. Nine “lions” held the seat of what was known as the Middle Druk.The Karma Kamtsang Kagyu is the lineage headed by the Karmapa incarnations, beginning with Glorious Dusum Khyenpa (1110-1193), the Great Adept Karma Pakshi (1204-1283), and Omniscient Rangjung Dorjé (1284-1339), and continuing up to the present. Within that there are also other great successions, such as that of the Tai Situ, Gyaltsap, Zhamar, Pawo, and Dreho incarnations. This is the root lineage. There are also two main branches of Kamtsang Kagyu: the Zurmang TOK_8-4_Final.indd 139TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1397/10/09 1:59:03 PM7/10/09 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeand Nedo. The Zurmang tradition began with Masé Tokden Lodro Rinchen (b. 1386), also known as Trung Masé, who was a student of the fi fth Karmapa Dezhin Shekpa (1384-1415). He received the transmission of the Cakrasa ̇vara Hearing Lineage. The succession of the incarna-tions of his students that have held the seat of the dharma lineage con-stitute the Zurmang Kagyu. The Nedo Kagyu are the holders of the teachings originating with the great master Karma Chakmé (R›ga Asya, 1613-1678), a disciple of the tenth Karmapa Choying Dorjé (1604-1674) and the Sixth Zhamar Gar-wang Chokyi Wangchuk (1584-1630). In accordance with the aspirations of Karma Chakmé, the Nedo Kagyu developed into two systems, one emphasizing the Kagyu that is the Nedo root dharma lineage, and one emphasizing the Nyingma transmission of his student Palyul Rikdzin Kunzang Sherab (1636-1698) and Padma Rikdzin (1625-1697). Kongtrul makes special mention of Situ Panchen Chökyi Jungné (1700-1776), the previous incarnation of his own teacher. He credits him with revitalizing the doctrine of the practice lineage, which had become a mere “refl ection” of its former self by his time. But this vener-able lineage that N›ropa called “longer than the source of the river” is destined to endure. According to the prophecy of Lord Marpa, as long as the victor’s doctrine survives, the lineage of experience and realization will continue unbroken.

These texts also explain each of those two as threefold:7Know that coarse, subtle, and very subtleAre their common and inseparable stages.[Th e Abiding Nature of the Mind] [1']The abiding nature of the mind is explained by Ronyam Dorjé, the student of Lord Marpa’s student,8 as follows:The abiding nature of mind-itself is presented as threefold.It involves the pristine awareness of three lights.Its inherent nature is explained as the essence of the coarse aspect.The emptiness of everything, taught as the fourth emptiness,Is the subtle aspect, and the very subtle aspectIs manifest awakening, the mind of awakening.The three lights9 manifest in a progressive order from pure mind. The coarse mind evolves from that, possessing the eighty natural concep-tions.10 After the reverse progression of the three lights has stopped and everything dwells only in emptiness, it is the subtle mind. The ultimate mind of awakening that is free of fi xation on the characteristics of the emptiness experience, named “manifest awakening” (mngon par byang chub), is luminous clarity. It is explained as the very subtle mind. Therefore, the mind that is referred to as the stained causal continuum TOK_8-4_Final.indd 146TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1467/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 147(rgyu’i rgyud) is the subtle aspect, and the stainless causal continuum is the very subtle aspect of mind.[Th e Abiding Nature of the Body] [2']In a similar way, the three of the body are described in the same source:The abiding nature of the body is ascertainedTo be coarse, subtle, and very subtle.All the aggregates, constituents, and sense fi eldsThat have the inherent nature of the support and supportedMandalas of deities are ascertained to be coarse.The channels, energy currents, and bodhicittaAre ascertained to be essentially subtle.The single bliss existing in the support and supported—That coemergence is taught as the very subtle. The coarse body is that physical impure body of aggregates, constituents, and sense fi elds that is the object of refi nement into emptiness during the initial stage of creation phase meditation. The subtle body is the channels, energy currents, and vital essences that are accomplished as the deities of the mandalas of Body, Speech, and Mind.11 The very subtle body is the native body that is inalienable from the coemergent three vajras or three k›yas at the time of fruition.How are these the bases of refi nement? The coarse is the imputed basis of refi nement, the subtle is the short-term basis of refi nement, and the very subtle body is the ultimate basis of refi nement. Of those, the meaning of the latter may be summarized by saying that the abiding nature of the mind is luminous clarity by nature, unre-stricted, undivided, and free of all elaboration—the realm of reality (chos dbyings; dharmadh›tu). The Liberative Essence12 describes this same thing as inseparable profundity and clarity.13 Native mind and the naturally abiding affi nity (rigs) are also this very thing. The nature of this has already been mentioned many times.14As for the abiding nature of the body, [the Hevajra Tantra] says:15 In the great bliss of the yogini’s bhaga16The Teacher with thirty-two major marks,TOK_8-4_Final.indd 147TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1477/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"148 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeAnd endowed with eighty minor marks,Is present in the aspect called “seminal fl uid.”Without that, bliss would be lost.[Without bliss, that becomes naught.]17Because it lacks capability, it is dependent.Bliss comes from deity yoga.This itself is not the thing of buddhas.18Nor is it a manner of non-thing.It has the form of faces and arms—The form of sublime unchanging bliss.19Therefore all beings are coemergent.The term “seminal fl uid” (khu ba) refers to what is produced from rela-tive awakening mind (byang sems; bodhicitta),20 the quintessence of the channels, energy currents, and vital essences that is the apparent support of sublime unchanging bliss. Being beyond the reality of atoms, it is the essence of pristine awareness. This is the native body itself. The victor Rangjung Dorjé21 explains:Channels, energy currents, and vital essences are interdepen-dently originated, arising from the appearances of mind.22 Those appearances are produced from relative bodhicitta. Since [those channels, etc.] become the support for coemer-gent pristine awareness, they are taught as the abiding nature of the vajra body.Concerning that, the Seventh Lord [Karmapa Chödrak Gyatso]23 said that the innate nature, lacking the stains of the eight groups of con-sciousness, abides as the four k›yas and is the fully developed affi nity without a beginning in time. This is the same vital point as the position taken by lord Rangjung.In this way the abiding nature of these two—body and mind—is impossible to separate, like water from ice. So it is called the union of two k›yas at the time of the ground.

The path of liberation has both creation and completion phases. Completion phase is further divided into with and without characteristics, or skillful methods and liberation, and so on. All of these are described above or below in this text. Here, it is time for the explanation of the completion phase paths of skillful methods and liberation and, more specifi cally, the path of skillful methods known as the Six Dharmas of N›ropa. On what tantras are these completion phases based? The past gurus have said:These instructions are based on the father tantra Guhyasam›ja, the mother tantra Mah›m›y›, the essence Hevajra, the quintessence Cakrasa ̇vara, and the oath-bound guardian Catu ̄pı ̨ha.26The statement that these instructions are based on these exceptional fi ve great root tantras and their concordant tantras and branches is just an approximation. In fact, these instructions are the ultimate completion phase of the entirety of tantric mah›yoga and especially of the nondual tantras. The following reasons were posited by Mikyö Dorjé27 and his spiritual heirs: It is because the cycle of father tantras such as Guhyasam›ja contain very extensive presentations on the energy currents and TOK_8-4_Final.indd 149TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1497/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeclearly teach the instructions on illusory body and luminous clarity; the mother tantra cycles of Cakrasa ̇vara and Hevajra contain very extensive presentations on the channels and vital essences and clearly teach the yogas of inner heat and action-mudra; the yogas of dream and intermediate state come from the Vajra ̃›ka Tantra,28 Sa ̇vara Origin Tantra,29 and others; the Sampu ̨a, Catu ̄pı ̨ha, and so on clearly teach the instructions on transference; and especially, the root and condensed tantras of the nondual K›lacakra Tantra30 and the Trilogy of Bodhisattva Commentaries31 give very extensive and clear presentations on all three—channels, energy currents, and vital essences—and on the yogas of inner heat, action-mudra, and so forth.The root scripture for this is the teaching of the pristine awareness ̃›kinı, Perfect Words [Esoteric Instructions of the Æ›kinı].32 Marpa composed commentaries on the meaning of its secret words. The main sources are those composed by Telo and Naro, such as the ones known as the former and latter Authoritative Texts on Six Dharmas.33 There appeared about thirty such major and minor indisputable Indian works that form the main source of these teachings. Then there is the related authentic sup-portive literature from the dharma cycle of the Cakrasa ̇vara Hearing Lineage, such as The Vajra Lines of the Hearing Lineage34 and The Four Scrolls of the Hearing [Lineage].35There are diff erences in the positions of the former masters as to the classifi cation and summary of these instructions. Those of Lama Ngokpa36 et al. summarize the essence of the six dharmas into mixing and transference according to N›ropa’s Eight Verses: 37The intermediate states of birth and death, dream,And the intermediate state of existence remain three,38But in practice are subsumed into two: mixing and transference.Mixing is the means for awakening through meditation,And transference is the method of awakening without meditation. Thus they can be called lineage instructions of the “three illusions” (sgyu ma gsum) or the two instructions for “mixing and transference” (bsre ’pho). Lord Marpa’s Stream of Elixir39 groups them in sets of four or eight:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 150TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1507/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 151Inner heat and illusory body are for awakening through medi-tation.

Based on inner heat, dream, luminous clarity, and transference, the diligent will attain awakening in this life. The method for the lazy to attain awak-ening in the intermediate state of existence is through the instructions on the intermediate state.According to Lord Gampopa,47 (1) inner heat is awakening through meditation, (2) dream is to awaken through making illusion the path, (3) luminous clarity is to awaken by making deep sleep the path, and (4) transference is how to awaken without meditating. Entrance trans-ference is an auxiliary. Counting dream and illusory body as one, and making the intermediate state a branch of that, there are six dharmas, or alternatively, they are condensed into four root dharmas.All the followers after that unanimously agree with The Latter Text on Austerities48 and others that contain the enlightened intention of N›ropa and his spiritual descendents, and they hold the teachings of Gampopa et al. to be supreme. Therefore there are six dharmas: four root dharmas with two branches.Th e Individual Main Topics [2']This has three parts: connecting that which refi nes with that which is to be refi ned, delineating the four modes, and a detailed presentation of the meditation topics.Th at Which Refi nes and Th at Which Is to Be Refi ned [a']The four states are what is to be refi ned, and the path that refi nes themIs the four root dharmas with their two branches.For a living person to attain awakening in the current body in a single lifetime, the stains of habitual patterns of the four states49 that are to be refi ned must be refi ned away. That is, they must be made into the path of the four k›yas. The special instructions for the path that refi nes in that way are exactly these four sets of teachings—inner heat and so on. For that reason they have been posited as the root dharmas, as it says in the Latter Authoritative Text: 50TOK_8-4_Final.indd 152TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1527/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 153Sleeping, dreaming, sexual union,And ordinary time; for these fourThere are practices of four times.They should be known from the guru’s oral teachings.The practices of the intermediate state and transference are taught as branch dharmas. Including those two, we have the basis for the defi ni-tion of the so-called Six Dharmas of N›ropa. So which of the states is refi ned by which dharma? The Concise Illumination of the Five Stages states:51Sleeping, dreaming, sexual union,And ordinary time; for these four,Identifying them with the four chakrasAnd understanding the channels, vital essences, and mind....Taking up that idea, Lama Ngokpa et al. say: During ordinary time, mind—the sovereign—abides at the navel, during dreamtime at the throat, during sleep at the heart, and during sexual union it abides at the crown of the head. As it states here, the mind abides at the navel during ordinary time. Its essence is to have an idea of things, which involves many thoughts. That state is refi ned by the esoteric instructions of illusory body and serves as the path of the nirm› ̊ak›ya. The ordinary time is synonymous with “the time of waking apart from others” since it is not tainted by the other three states.During dreamtime the mind abides at the throat. Its essence is that the energy currents create existent or nonexistent forms. That state is refi ned by the esoteric instructions of dream and serves as the path of the sa ̇bhogak›ya.

What is called “the state of the fourth apart from others” is synonymous with the state of sexual union. The state of movement [of vital essence]52 also refers to that. Since the force of the habitual pattern of that movement causes the arousal of desire for the desire [realm], there is no diff erence in those two. Since it is fourth in the enumeration, following the waking state, it is also referred to as “the fourth.”Delineating the Four Modes [b']The literal meanings of the Six Dharmas have a textual tradition of both sutra and mantra.Their general meaning is common and special; their hidden meaning is experience and realization.Ultimately, they are concordant with training and the actual experience beyond training.To apply the analysis of the four modes precisely to those Six Dharmas, fi rst one develops an understanding by hearing the literal meaning of the Six Dharmas: (1) The bliss of pristine awareness fi ercely burns (gtum) and conquers affl ictive emotion. (2) All phenomena of samsara and nirvana appear only as illusory body. (3) Dream indicates by example that all apparent phenomena appear to our deluded perceptions but do not truly exist. (4) The abiding nature of all phenomena is luminous clarity free of all the extremes of elaboration. (5) Because of our deluded concepts of dualistic appearances, we wander in between (bar ma dor) samsara and nirvana. (6) The practice of the holy dharma of unmistaken sutras and tantras transfers (’pho ba) one onto higher and higher levels and paths. You should know that the two perspectives of the scriptural traditions of sutra and mantra could be applied separately to each of those as well.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 154TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1547/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 155The general meaning of the Six Dharmas is the experience gained through refl ection: (1) Ca ̊ ̃›lı (inner heat) is to bond with the pledge-mudra.

(4) One refi nes luminous clarity through apprehending the instant visualization and the subsequent dissipation.53 (5) The intermediate state is cut through by recognizing it. (6) The pristine awareness of the moment of death transfers [the con-sciousness] up.Each of those also has two: the meaning found commonly in tantras and esoteric instructions, and in the special pith instructions of the vital points in the hearing lineage.The hidden meaning of the Six Dharmas is that which is realized through meditation: (1) The great creative energy of bliss, warmth, and nonthought is consummated. (2) Energy-mind54 matures as the deity’s illusory form. (3) Energy-mind arises as the deity’s form just from the four empties.55 (4) One’s own nature is recognized through example and actual luminous clarity.

We will describe the essence of each of them in sequence.The name “inner heat” (gtum mo, ca ̊ ̃›lı) is used to describe the esoteric instructions on inner heat, the meditation method, the union of bliss and emptiness that arises from it, and the means of expression that teaches those two. There are many applications of the name; however, all others are imputations. The real inner heat is the coemergent pris-tine awareness of bliss-emptiness and so that is called its essence. Such distinctions between real and designated should be applied to the other dharmas as well.The essence of illusory body is the coemergent pristine awareness of appearance-emptiness. Although they are a union, one cannot realize it unless ultimate truth has been actualized. So the real illusory body is the manifestation of the illusion-like pure body from the three lights occurring in reverse order,56 together with the pristine awareness energy currents, arising out of luminous clarity. The essence of dream is the coemergent pristine awareness of intrin-sic awareness (rig pa) and emptiness. Mere optical illusions appear and yet are none other than one’s own mind. Thus they are held to be awareness-emptiness.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 156TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1567/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 157The essence of luminous clarity is the coemergent pristine awareness of clarity-emptiness. The three consciousnesses57 or three emptinesses are totally pure and everything is empty. Its clarity is not the clarity that comes from external conditions but rather it is like a gem that shines with its own light. This is explained in The Five Stages.58 The essence of the intermediate state is said to be the coemergent pristine awareness of the three times. This is because, as explained in the Vajra Garland,59 although we imagine that we arise, abide, and cease in the intermediate state, it is just the subtle body of energy-mind.The essence of transference is the coemergent pristine awareness of inseparability. This is because one may consider the essence that is free of a transferred object and a means of transference as the indivisible three k›yas or the inseparability of the three vajras.The addition of the term “coemergent pristine awareness” (lhan cig skyes pa’i ye shes) to all of these indicates that those very unions [of bliss and emptiness, etc.] are not something that arise in former and latter stages, but that they abide simultaneously. This is called “coemergent.” In Coemergent Spiritual Power60 it states:When something arises simultaneously with anythingIt is called coemergent.Thus, “coemergent” is described as being like the equal fl avor of phe-nomena and reality. In the same way, since all of those six dharmas are in essence the transcendent path, they are referred to as “pristine aware-ness” (ye shes, Skt. jñ›na).Which means of purifi cation is applied to which object of purifi ca-tion? The esoteric instructions of inner heat as the means of purifi cation are applied to the pristine awareness aggregate and pristine awareness constituent, and so on, as the object of purifi cation. Once they have been refi ned, the result of purifi cation is the actualization of the sixth or Vajrasattva family spiritual powers and the jñ›nak›ya (pristine awareness body).61Applying this to the other dharmas, the esoteric instruction of illu-sory body refi nes the aggregate of form, the constituent of earth, and so forth, and actualizes the tath›gata family spiritual powers and the nirm› ̊ak›ya. The esoteric instruction of dream refi nes the aggregate of feeling, the constituent of fi re, and so forth, and actualizes the padma TOK_8-4_Final.indd 157TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1577/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"158 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgefamily spiritual powers and the sa ̇bhogak›ya.

Vajragarbha’s Commentary66 states:Because it burns, it is described as “inner heat.”And from Saroruha’s Commentary on the Diffi cult Points of Hevajra: 67Inner heat is that which eradicates the affl ictive emotions of exis-tence from the roots.And N›ropa’s Diffi cult Points states:68Because it performs fi erce burning actionsIt is called “heat.”“Female” (the feminine particle mo) means that it swiftly gives birth to the coemergent pristine awareness of bliss-emptiness.69 As it states in Abhay›kara’s Source Commentary: 70Ca ̊ ̃ (from the Sanskrit ca ̊ ̃›lı) is the defi nite realization of the inherent essence of consummate wisdom, and › is great compassion. Those are called the guide to the penultimate state, hence “inner heat.”Specifi cally, there are three designations: fi erce a (a gtum), short a (a thung), and stroke a (a shad). The fi rst is according to its function: con-quering affl ictive emotion. The second is its intrinsic nature: unborn. The third is its shape: the last part of a is like a brush stroke.71 There are a great many lists of the divisions of inner heat, but the glorious Khachö Wangpo set forth just three: outer, inner, and secret. His source for that was the Tantra That Equals Space: 72Whoever desires the pristine awareness of refl exive awarenessShould investigate the particulars of ca ̊ ̃›lı: First, natural ca ̊ ̃›lı,Second, fi erce ca ̊ ̃›lı,Third, ca ̊ ̃›lı of joining.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 159TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1597/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"160 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThus, three kinds are clearly presented here: Natural ca ̊ ̃›lı is that the nature of all phenomena is emptiness, so that is the outer inner-heat. Fierce ca ̊ ̃›lı is the short a in the navel, so it is the inner inner-heat. Joining ca ̊ ̃›lı is the union of emptiness that is sublime in all aspects and the supreme unchanging great bliss. The fi rst one severs conceptual elaborations about the view, the second brings the meditation topic into practice, and the third joins with the state of supreme, unchanging great bliss. Therefore, in general, the meditation sequence of a single indi-vidual follows that order. But there are also particular cases where one would fi rst practice the inner inner-heat and then, as an enhancement of that, train in the outer inner-heat and the secret inner-heat.It is also possible to draw forth the experiences of the latter ones [fi erce ca ̊ ̃›lı and joining ca ̊ ̃›lı] when meditating on the former [natural ca ̊ ̃›lı], once there is the ability to join with the supreme inner-heat and successfully receive the introduction [of mind’s nature]. Not waver-ing from the certainty of the meditation on secret inner-heat carries the outer and inner inner-heat as auxiliary practices of the path. This becomes a very amazing practice, as it guides practitioners according to the level of their faculties.Of those, what is called “ca ̊ ̃›lı that realizes the outer meaning with certainty” refers to coemergent union and other stages in the guidance of mah›mudr› and the experiences that arise from it. Lord Gampopa even spoke of it as the inner heat of mah›mudr›. This is in fact the ultimate inner heat, but there is no fault in referring to it as “outer meaning.” Since it presents primarily the discernment of emptiness it is consistent with the defi nitive meaning of both the middle and the fi nal turnings of the wheel [of the dharma]73 and is thus even more distinguished. It also has the same meaning as the mantray›na practice of dissolving all the eighty natural conceptions into emptiness through the force of mental visualization. It is because of this commonality with sutra and mantra that it is described as “ca ̊ ̃›lı that realizes the outer meaning with certainty.”74 In the expression “space-ca ̊ ̃›lı of most hidden secret meaning,” the outer meaning of space is the emptiness that is the intrinsic nature of all phenomena, as stated in the Supreme Glory: 75Everything has the characteristic of space;Yet space itself has no characteristic.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 160TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1607/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 161The inner is the space of dhÒti that will be explained. The secret is the bhaga of the vajra queen. The suchness is explained in the K›lacakra: 76 Pervasive space endowed with the vajra of space.Here, the inner space is the source of phenomena77 within the unre-stricted avadhÒti, the expanse of space that contains the entire extent of the three realms. It is the realm of luminous clarity free of obscura-tion. The refl exive awareness of pristine awareness undivided by dualistic thinking, the absolute vajra, unchanging bliss, engages [with that inner space] in the practice of yoga. That is the ca ̊ ̃›lı of space. It is described as “secret” or “hidden” in the Vajra Garland.78 This means that it has the quality of being secret or hidden from those without the karmic fortune to be able to realize it.Why is the nonduality of emptiness endowed with all aspects and unchanging bliss referred to by the term ca ̊ ̃›lı ? The meaning can be found in the profound tantra:79 The blazing of inner heat in the navelBurns the fi ve tath›gatas.By burning Locan› and the others,80The moon of ha ̇ drips.81The term is consistent in both etymology and function: the word “navel” (lte ba) signifi es the middle or core of all phenomena, and “cen-tral” (dbu ma) means that all extremes are abandoned. “Inner heat” (gtum mo) is the refl exive awareness of pristine awareness, since it severs all conceptual thought and bestows nonconceptual pristine awareness of great bliss. “Blazing” (sbar ba) is made manifest through the force of the yoga. It signifi es clearing away the stains of fi xating to the actual true existence of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fi elds. This has actually been spontaneously cleared away since forever in the chakra-wheels of tath›gatas, so “burns” (bsreg pa) applies to all thought for-mations that are not of the fi ve masculine or feminine buddhas of the fi ve families or the host of bodhisattvas. The word “drip” (’dzag pa) or “radiate” (’phro ba) is used to show that this process reveals bodhicitta (byang sems), the excellent moon of great bliss that is the eternal illusory display of all existence.

The Secret Elixir Tantra83 makes divisions such as “dense” (stug po) ca ̊ ̃›lı, and so forth. And there are many more ways to classify it: action and pristine awareness; ordinary and supreme; with or without characteristics; relative and absolute; ground, path, and fruition; sub-stance, mantra, and pristine awareness; the three inner heats of channels, energy currents, and vital essences; and so forth.Specifi c Inner Profound Vital Points [2\"]This has three parts: The object that is targeted, the method of how to target it, and the benefi ts of this targeting.Th e Object Th at Is Targeted [a\"]What is targeted are the three channels and four chakras.In general, based on the yoga of channels, energy currents, and vital essences, these paths actualize the pristine awareness of coemergent bliss and emptiness and cause the accomplishment of the state of union, Vajradhara.84 For that reason one must become knowledgeable in the arrangement of these channels, energy currents, and vital essences. How-ever, here I will not elaborate for fear of being wordy. It was presented before in mere token fashion in the exploration of the stages of study.85 For a thorough study, one should learn from the precious tantras and, in particular, the source commentaries on their intent that are equivalent to those tantras, such as The Profound Inner Reality.86 Here is a summary of the meditation object of whichever profound yoga and whatever object or support is to be targeted, from Telopa’s Lamp That Illuminates the Esoteric Instructions of Fourfold Suchness: 87What are the supports?

Since binding them immov-ably is the foundation of all paths of liberation and skillful methods, one should know how they are used in yogic practice. The main technique is to join the upper and lower energy currents in the vase [of the abdomen] by employing the four applications and the fi ve vital points. As it says in the Sa ̇vara Origin Tantra: 88TOK_8-4_Final.indd 163TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1637/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"164 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeConcentrate on uniting the upper and lowerCirculating energy currents.When accustomed to that application,You will attain a state of stability.There are four ways that those applications control the energy currents: (1) control of the duration as the inhalations get closer according to the measure of one’s own fi ngers89 (2) control of the numbers as the breaths become fewer (3) control of the force as the external movement becomes more gentle and relaxed (4) control of the benefi ts as the length of time increases that it stays in its own place, such as the navel, without moving out.Of these, the fi rst three also occur in some species of animals, so it is not the authentic yogic state.

Based on that, the movement of concepts is bound without emission.94 That, then, is the meditation of the pristine aware-ness of coemergent bliss and emptiness. Since this body is produced from the full development of the semen and ovum in the womb, the red and white bodhicittas are the main constituents. The rest of the body parts are manifestations of those two.95 Of those two bodhicittas, the white abides mainly at the top of the head and the red mainly at the navel. The quintessence of the red aspect that was obtained from the mother is the short a of inner heat. It has four characteristics: (1) It is the red color of the totally pure nature of the sun.

(4) It is emptiness by nature, because the realm of reality is the essence of the perfection of wisdom. The quintessence of the white aspect that was obtained from the father is the essence of bodhicitta as the letter ha ̇. It also has four characteristics: (1) It is white, because it is an aspect of the moon constituent. (2) It is iridescent like the surface of a pearl, since it is connected to the ca ̊ ̃›lı that is the intrinsic nature of wisdom. (3) It is glossy, because bodhicitta has the potency of elixir.

Parts of it pervade the body in general, and in particular the four chakras. A melted aspect of the white aspect dwells in each of the four chakras. They have the quality of acting as support for the arising of the four joys of Body, Speech, Mind and pristine awareness that occur when the stains of the four constituents of body, speech, mind, and bliss are refi ned. A stream of melted aspect issues from the upper chakras that has the ability to generate that kind of quality. After the sixteen joys based on the sixteen white aspects occur, the coemergent joy arises. The red aspect resides at the navel, but aspects of it pervade the chakras. So in each of the four chakras there resides individually a melted aspect of the red aspect that has the quality of acting as the support for the arising of the bliss of the three vajras that occur when the stains of motility, darkness, and buoyancy96 are refi ned. A stream of its melted aspect issues from the upper chakras that has the ability to generate that kind of quality. After the twelve (three times four) joys97 based on the twelve red aspects occur, the coemergent joy arises. What is the reason for calling the white and red constituents “bodhi-citta”? Bodhicitta has three aspects: cause, path, and result. (1) The causal bodhicitta is the beginningless and endless bodhicitta that has been present in the mindstreams of sentient beings since forever. (2) The path bodhicitta is of two kinds: general and hidden. The gen-eral meaning is the bodhicitta (“awakening mind”) of the two truths proclaimed in the causal vehicle. The hidden meaning is the bodhicitta that is the unobscured quintessence of the constituent that abides since forever. By binding the vital points98 of the unobscured vajra body, that bodhicitta melts and through the power of interdependent connection the bodhicitta of the two truths arises in the mindstream. Thus, the quintessence of white and red is bodhicitta. Of these two bodhicittas, general and hidden, the latter one is sublime. The general is bodhicitta of merely the mind, that which is the supported, and therefore it cannot become the irreversible and unchanging bodhicitta. The hidden is the bodhicitta of both the supported mind and the body, the support, and thus it becomes both [irreversible and unchanging]. (3) The resultant bodhicitta is Vajradhara itself. In brief, the essential red and white bodhicittas reside in the navel and the top of the head TOK_8-4_Final.indd 166TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1667/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 167as a and ha ̇. At the time of being a samsaric person who proclaims “I,” the dualistic fi xation of the self-entity of an individual and of phe-nomena is created. However, the interdependent connection created by the blazing and melting from binding the vital points of the support [the body] causes the pristine awareness of the two nonselves to arise naturally. One attains the self of nonself—the dharmak›ya, which is the assurance of Vajradhara, and the form k›yas, which are the assurance of the tath›gatas. Then without moving anywhere else one accomplishes the state where enlightened activity is omnipresent and constant. This is taught in the Vajra Garland.Th e Yoga of Inner Heat [cc\"]At the time of the ground, inner heat resides at the navel or secret place as substance, mantra, and pristine awareness.It ignites through visualizations, energy currents, and skillful methods.The uncommon, inner inner-heat that produces unchanging bliss has three phases: the time of the ground, the time of the path, and the time of the fruition. [Th e Time of the Ground] [(1)]Most tantras say that at the time of the ground inner heat resides at the navel. The Oral Teachings of MañjuŸrı99 says it is at the secret place. Vajragarbha’s Commentary100 explains that it is in both. These and other views are not contradictory because, as stated in that commentary, it is “like the moon’s form in water or in the sky.” That is to say, like the moon in the sky, the real inner heat resides in the navel, and like the moon’s refl ection in water, an image of inner heat arises in the secret place. So either the navel or the secret place is acceptable, or it appears to be in both places. What is its essence? There are three explanations: substance, man-tra, and pristine awareness. Inner heat as substance is explained in four ways: as vital essence in Cakrasa ̇vara, as fi re in the Vajra Garland, as energy current in theVital Essence of Mah›mudr›,101 and as channel in Vajragharba’s Commentary, since the lower end of the right channel has been referred to by the name “tummo” (gtum mo).TOK_8-4_Final.indd 167TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1677/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"168 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeAn explanation of inner heat as mantra is found in the Vital Essence of Spring,102 where it accords with teachings on the intrinsic nature of short a:The form of the letter a in the navelIs well known as “short.”Inner heat is described as pristine awareness in the [Cakrasa ̇vara] Abhi-dh›na Tantra: 103 This fi re of pristine awareness, once it is stirred by the karmic energy currents....So from among all those modes of explanation, what is, in fact, the essence? Here, in the context of the two truths, it is reasonable to say, from the point of view of the relative truth, that the actual thing is the vital essence and its functional power is essentially fi re. This is because this very thing is described as the quintessence of the rakta [or red vital essence] that was obtained from the mother, and as such it is the root of all the body’s warmth and the ruler of all the constituents of the red aspect. Also because it has the functional power of burning and melting, for when it is ignited the habitual patterns of the aggregates, constitu-ents, and sense fi elds are burned up and the great blissful bodhicitta melts. The other descriptions are assigned from the perspective of its individual features: energy currents because they are the contributing condition for igniting inner heat, channels because that is its place or support, and mantra because that is what blesses the inner heat, and so on. In terms of the ultimate truth, since inner heat is really the essence of pristine awareness, even though relatively it has the nature of vital essence, in fact it is held to be pristine awareness.

In general it is aroused by the karmic energy currents. In particular, the Ocean of Æ›kas105 says that it is ignited by the energy currents in the right and left channels, which are the intrinsic nature of the letters of the vowels and consonants [of Sanskrit]. The Vajra Garland says that it is ignited by the energy in the central channel alone. The K›lacakra says that it is ignited by the mixing of the vital energy current with the downward-clearing energy current in a mass or bundle.106 (3) It is ignited by skillful methods, by relying upon methods using one’s own body and another’s body.The essence of the blazing fi re is clear and unimpeded since it transcends the phenomenal nature of atomic particles, which are gross. It is expe-rienced in meditative equipoise as a direct object of individual refl exive awareness. It is the power and force of energy current yogas and such. It elicits the four joys and four emptinesses while burning up the habitual patterns of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fi elds. It is what serves as the dominant condition for the fi re of pristine awareness. Although it is not an external fi re, it has the ability to warm like fi re because of the force of the yoga’s blessing.The degrees of blazing are the lesser, medium, and great blazing that occur in the three stages of entering, abiding, and dissolving.The essence of that path, or the actual path, is the pristine awareness itself that occurs due to the bliss of the total blazing of the inner heat fi re. Since inner heat is said to be the antidote to conceptual thought, it must be pristine awareness that is the actual antidote because mere warmth does not have that ability. Concerning that, pristine awareness has three aspects: nonthought, bliss, and clarity. (1) The pristine awareness of nonthought: The appearance of inner heat’s blazing stops the movement of energy currents and the engage-ment with objects by the sense faculties. Once such emanating thoughts are brought to an end, one abides in total nonthought. (2) The pristine awareness of bliss: Blazing inner heat melts the bodhi-citta and the joy that is generated illustrates the pristine awareness of bliss.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 169TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1697/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"170 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge(3) The pristine awareness of clarity: When all dualistic thoughts are purifi ed within the central channel, the pristine awareness of the union of bliss-emptiness or clarity-emptiness arises through the progressive and reverse sequence of the three lights in the stages of visualization.[Th e Time of Result] [(3)]It is explained that discriminating pristine awareness has the func-tion of conquering the hordes of devils and so on, as it says in the K›lacakra: 107The fully expanding fl ames of pristine awareness totally burn up all the hosts of devils along with their objects.Th e Specifi cs of Practice [ii\"]This has two parts: the explanations of total liberation through the upper door and the path of great bliss of the lower door.Total Liberation through the Upper Door [aa\"]For that, meditate on the path of total liberation using the upper door of one’s own bodyWith the vital points of body, time, and object.There is bliss, heat, nonthought, and pristine awareness, with enhancement.To accomplish pristine awareness of bliss-emptiness in that way through the yoga of channels, energy currents, and vital essences, one should fi rst practice the total liberation of the upper door that relies on one’s own body as the method.

Or that there is appearance without intrinsic existence. Hence “illusory body (sgyus lus).”118 The general divisions of illusory body are explained under seven head-ings: example illusions, appearance illusions, dream illusions, interme-diate state illusions, luminous clarity illusions, emanated illusions, and pristine awareness illusions.(1) Examples: These are given in the sutras where it says, “Those who create illusions emanate forms...” and so on.119 Using substances and such, magicians can cause horses, elephants, and so on, to suddenly appear even though they do not, in fact, exist.(2) Appearance illusion: As in the Root of Wisdom,120 “like dreams, like illusions...” and so on, all phenomena are like dreams and illusions, appearing while having no true existence.(3) Dream illusion: The Commentary [on Valid Cognition]121 states:They have bodies, but since they are subtleThey are not obstructed by anything.As it says, the body in a dream comes from habitual patterns and is com-posed of subtle energy-mind, but it is not obstructed by anything.(4) Intermediate state illusion: The Abhidharma Treasury122 says, “facul-ties are intact and movement is unhindered,” and so on.

There are threefold divi-sions into the illusory body of beginners, of the third stage,125 and of union; and of outer meaning, hidden meaning, and union. There is a fourfold division into literal meaning, general meaning, hidden mean-ing, and ultimate illusory body. From those and other divisions, I now off er a brief presentation of the esoteric instructions from this precious lineage.Th e Meditation [2\"]This has three parts: impure illusory body, pure illusory body, and totally pure illusory body.Impure Illusory Body [a\"]The practice is to see that impure phenomena are like the eight examples.The esoteric instructions of the vital points of practice in this teaching tradition must be accomplished by stages. The fi rst of three stages is known as impure illusory body. The meaning of this name “impure illusory body” (ma dag pa’i sgyu lus) is expressed in the fi rst progressive division of the Vajra ̃›ka Tantra: 126In the three realms, all the beings Without exception are like illusion.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 175TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1757/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"176 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeInanimate and animate beingIs without a frame of reference.Visible and tangible thingsAre all just like illusions.The appearances of impure things in the three realms—inanimate or animate, visible or tangible—all appear, like an illusion, but have no true existence. They are therefore impure illusions. For those who do not realize that, these esoteric instructions were taught as a method for getting rid of the fi xation on attributes that results from attachment to the true existence of things. The general training is described in the Pure Gold of the Six Dharmas: 127So, fi rst you should view all external appearances as being like the eight examples of illusion. All of these forms and such appear to the deluded mind but there is nothing out there, as in a dream or an illusion. They arise from conditions, like echoes or refl ections. They are impermanent, like dewdrops and water bubbles. They appear but have no intrinsic nature, like mirages and rainbows. By training in that way and becoming accus-tomed to it, you will discard any ideas based on appearances. As it says, one ascertains through these examples of illusion, dream, and so on, that this whole appearance of samsara and nirvana—the exter-nal and internal things included in the environments and their inhabit-ants in the three realms—are appearing without any true existence, and one meditates on that.The specifi c training is to establish that one’s own body is form-emp-tiness, similar to a refl ection; speech is sound-emptiness, similar to an echo; and mind is awareness-emptiness, similar to an illusion. Since this topic is found in the Perfection of Wisdom sutras and in the tantras, it is a teaching common to both sutra and tantra.Pure Illusory Body [b\"]The pure is to train with the display of the deities, mantras, and pristine awareness.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 176TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1767/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 177Transformation of the impure appearances of the environment and its inhabitants into the pure mandala of deities is the reason that this is called “pure illusory body” (dag pa’i sgyu lus). This is held in common among all the lower sections of tantra, but it is greatly distinguished from the path of the perfections. It is the way of the profound mantra to teach that the aggregates, constituents, and sense fi elds all exist originally as the intrinsic nature of the deity. In order to realize that very thing, which has not been previ-ously realized, one must ascertain the manner of being. Then by medi-tating, the special meditative absorption of illusory display will develop. Visualizing the environment and its inhabitants as the deity will refi ne away the attachment to ordinary appearance and then ascertaining the illusory-like empty appearance of even the deity will refi ne any thoughts of attachment to the supremacy of the deity. That is the sequence.Therefore, one regards all appearances of one’s own body and the environment and its inhabitants as a support palace and supported man-dala of deities; all sounds as the innate sound of profound mantra; and all mental comings and goings as the play of pristine awareness. At the same time, one meditates on those too as being like an illusion—not truly existing other than as one’s own imputation. The way those are illustrated by the three examples is consistent with what was taught before in words from the Five Stages.128In this Kagyu tradition, ascertaining that whatever appearances arise in the impure environment and its inhabitants are all illusion is impure illusory body, and transforming those very appearances to those of dei-ties and ascertaining the same thing is pure illusory body, conventionally speaking. The explanations on the fi ve stages in the Guhyasam›ja Tantra explain that the illusory body at the end of the three isolations129 is the impure, and the illusory body that is one part of the union refi ned by luminous clarity is pure illusory body.130 Totally Pure Illusory Body [c\"]This has three parts: understanding, practice, and removing doubts.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 177TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1777/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"178 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeUnderstanding [i\"]The totally pure has time, method, cause, manifestation, and essence:Five distinctions...Pure illusory body is posited as “pure” simply because one clarifi es ordi-nary appearances, meditating on them as the deity. However, since it is a meditation that is essentially conceptual imputation, it is not really totally pure. Here, this is “totally pure illusory body” (rnam dag sgyu lus) because the body produced from the quintessence of energy-mind, like the appearances in mirror divination, is not conceptually imputed. This is the illusory body of the hidden meaning unique to the highest mantra, the main stage of the path of self-blessing by energy-mind.There are several diff erent explanations of “self-blessing” in the tan-tras.131 However, self-blessing of illusory body in the Guhyasam›ja and self-blessing of forms of emptiness132 in K›lacakra have the same mean-ing. Both illusory bodies and forms of emptiness share the following: (1) distinctive time: they arise after gross and subtle appearances and thoughts have subsided (2) distinctive method: they occur from stopping dualistic energy-currents and thoughts in the central channel (3) distinctive cause: they are produced from the extremely subtle quintessence of energy-mind (4) distinctive manifestation: they are seen as clear appearances with-out imputation like those in mirror divination (5) distinctive essence: they are the appearance of pristine awareness that is totally sublime and beyond the phenomenal nature of subtle atoms.For reasons such as these, the Eighth Lord Mikyö Dorjé and his heirs held them to be “totally equivalent.”The basis for the practice of the illusory body that is the hidden mean-ing unique to the highest tantra, the preliminaries for its practice, the way it is practiced, the distinctions in the methods of the two stages of creation and completion, and so forth, that are summed up in the positions of the precious Kagyu were explained before.133 Now, in the hidden meaning of ca ̊ ̃›lı, once one has perfected the blazing appear-TOK_8-4_Final.indd 178TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1787/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 179ances, the four supreme joys will arise from the continuous melting bliss of the blazing and dripping from the dissolving of pristine awareness-energy into the supreme avadhÒti. That engenders a distinctive mental isolation, which in turn produces a pseudo-illusory body with fi ve dis-tinctions. Then the real luminous clarity eliminates the stains and the ultimate illusory body with distinctions is produced. It is that which is called the k›ya of union or sa ̇bhogak›ya. On this subject, Lord Tepuba said:Example illusory body is the refl ection in a mirror. Real illu-sory body is the aggregate without obscuration. Illusory body’s own essence is the marks and signs of the pure vowels and con-sonants. The quality of illusory body is that it is the support for overcoming devils and actualizing enlightenment. Once that occurs, that form will remain for as long as space remains.That is a perfectly complete teaching on illusory body as cause, path, and resultant body. In the Lamp Summary of Conduct134 it is explained that this hidden meaning of illusory body is not [present beginning with] creation phase through the end of mental isolation. In the mantra tradi-tion it is a required component in the accomplishment of the form k›yas in the full awakening in one lifetime. Practice [ii\"]This has two parts: the illusory body of meditative equipoise and the illusory body of postmeditation. Th e Illusory Body of Meditative Equipoise [aa\"]This has three parts: the three isolations as preliminary supports; based on those supports, the main practice without characteristics; and with characteristics.Th e Th ree Isolations as Preliminary Supports [(1)]...and three isolations that have preceded.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 179TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1797/10/09 1:59:04 PM7/10/09 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeBoth the yogas that do not use elaborations and characteristics and those that do use elaborations and characteristics are foundations for accom-plishing meditative absorption. Isolation of body is the basis for the isolation of speech, the vajra repetition.135 Isolation of mind develops from that. Once these three isolations have preceded, the stages of illu-sory body that develop from emptiness or bliss arise automatically. In this context, making a connection with the special vital points in the yoga without characteristics brings the three doors [of body, speech, and mind] to rest without movement. In the yoga with characteristics, the vital points and functions of the body are bound. The speech is the vajra repetition of energy vase-breathing.136 In the mind, impressions subside within melting bliss. This is slightly diff erent than the three isolations and the way to practice them described in the Guhyasam›ja. However, both make the same vital point: that the arising of meditative absorp-tion, which is the actual thing to be accomplished, is a function of the energy currents entering, abiding, and dissolving in the central channel. In addition, this tradition is a profound esoteric instruction for those of lower or intermediate faculties.Th e Main Practice Without Characteristics [(2)]Without characteristics, through the force of blessings,Illusory body is born from the pristine awareness of mah›mudr›And manifests to intrinsic awareness.Those who practice the yoga without characteristics should remain in the aforementioned three isolations in a solitary place. From within that state, one off ers unconditionally one’s body, enjoyments, and roots of virtue and arouses total devotion to the guru. That will sever mental elaborations of the three times. Resting in that equipoise, the force of the blessing will pacify the characteristics of the two obscurations in their own place and the pristine awareness of mah›mudr› will actually mani-fest. Focusing on that itself, meditation leads to the mental concentra-tion, which controls the energy currents.

From mind with energy currents, the illusory form—which is illustrated by the twelve examples of illusion— adorned by the major and minor marks, arises as direct manifestation to the pristine awareness of individual refl exive awareness. Not only that, this will cause the sense of unhindered perception of all the pure and impure worlds and beings in the three times.

In either case, once one has become well accomplished in the basic foundation of the root yoga with its distinctive qualities of the three isolations, one may unite in action-mudra with a qualifi ed aware-ness partner or with a pristine awareness-mudra emanated by meditative absorption. With this impetus, the cause of the nondissipating body, the primordially abiding affi nity itself, arises with luminous clarity as the three vajras [following] the progressive and reverse manifestations of the three lights. This makes one free of obscuration.

This form that is the intrinsic nature of the minds of all buddhas and not clothed in the characteristics of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fi elds, appears only to pristine awareness. It is the quintessential form of emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects, its unimpeded luminous clarity arising like a rainbow. If meditative experiences, signs, and certainty do not arise, one should undertake enhancing practices, such as using laq-dye or the physical exercises of sword and mirror, and also practice.137 This process is the hidden meaning freely elucidated in the general commentarial tradition of the Kagyu in an unbroken continuity up to the present. It is the position of the Eighth Lord and others that there are two presentations concerning this instance of illusory body: in conjunc-tion with Guhyasam›ja primarily, when it is based on the three isola-tions, and in conjunction with the intentions of Cakrasa ̇vara, Hevajra, and Guhyasam›ja, when it is based on the mudras.

Therefore it is not generally presented in the practice guides, but hidden elsewhere. Scholars who are bloated by mere book learning cannot understand these points properly and are totally lost.Dream [cc']Dream yoga, the measure [of progress on the path], has two parts: a general presentation of the meaning of the name and arrangement of the divisions, and a specifi c explanation of the practice.Th e Name and the Divisions [1\"]The measure, dream, is divided into example, meaning, and the end of time.Dream yoga is the measure of [progress on] the path because the level of success on the path of recognizing the three illusions140 can be identi-fi ed through the stable or unstable experiences in dreams. It is called “dream”141 because it deals with the arising of the very form of habitual patterns or the apprehension of energetic forms of objects.142There are several divisions: (1) example dream: the actual dream (2) real dream: daytime appearances (3) dream at time’s end: the intermediate state.From the perspective of essence there are (1) dreams of beginners (2) dreams of yogins (3) dreams of noble beings. Also:(1) minor dreams: the fragmented appearances during sleepTOK_8-4_Final.indd 183TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1837/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"184 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge (2) intermediate dreams: unstable appearances of the intermediate state (3) major dreams: the stable deluded appearances of the waking state. Here the presentation will concern example dream. Dreams arise due to the particular ways that the energy currents and mind congregate in the channel locations. The essence of dream is that it is the arising of various appearances of habitual patterns within the sleeping state. The body in that dream may or may not separate from this gross body.143 In either case, it is essentially a body of energy-mind. Since it mimics the habitual patterns of the present body it is also called the habitual body. That time of dreaming is double delusion,144 because the power of the habitual patterns of this delusion, the current waking rela-tive appearances, give rise to various appearances in the dream that do not exist even on a relative level. The instructions that enable one to take the dream state as the path are known as “dream instructions” (rmi lam gyi gdams pa).Th e Practice [2\"]The esoteric instructions of recognizing, training, and combiningAscertain appearance, including death, to be like that.In the beginning, in order to take dreams as the path, one must embrace two vital points: unbroken mindfulness in the day and the rigorous tech-niques of esoteric instructions at night. There are four impediments to recognition: excessive emptiness, excessive sleepiness, excessive wakeful-ness, and excessive complacency. Once these are dispelled by remedial esoteric instructions, the dream is recognized to be just that, and that is dream recognition [or lucid dreaming]. Moreover, like the dream, all phenomena are essentially empty and as such can appear as anything at all. Thus the two truths are combined. The dream practice in the causal vehicle is to think, “How amazing—these refl ected forms arise interde-pendently with no separation between the relative phenomenon (chos can, Skt. dharmin) and its nature (chos nyid, Skt. dharmat›).” The dream practice in this context of the completion phase is when one can arouse dreams themselves as mah›mudr› illusory body deities.

One refi nes the illusion by deliberately forcing the knowledge that it is not real, and attains mastery in the meditative absorption in which one trains in worldly and transcendent liberating actions.145In the end, one blends dreams and luminous clarity. Using the eso-teric instruction for combining dreams with a meditation on suchness, the illusion-like daytime appearances blend with the dream appearances of the night, and then dreams will arise as illusory bodies. One must mix and integrate146 those illusory bodies in the luminous clarity [that arises during the meditative stabilities] of instant and subsequent dissipation. In particular, one applies the example of night dreaming to the actual appearances of the day to ascertain their unreality and then meditates on that. By that one ascertains that the death appearances are dreams. Meditating in that way obviates the diffi cult passage of the intermediate state. Just as in a sleeping dream it might appear that one has died and wandered in the intermediate state and again taken rebirth, and yet none of that was real, in the same way the death and intermediate state and rebirth of actual appearance occur but they are merely like that, without any true nature. Ascertaining that is the breakthrough.Luminous Clarity [dd']The fourth, luminous clarity, the heart of the path, has two parts: a gen-eral presentation of the meaning of the name and the arrangement of the divisions, and a specifi c discussion of the meditation topics.Th e Name and the Divisions [1\"]Luminous clarity, the heart, is twofold: example and actual, experience and realization,Or classifi ed as four or fi ve, such as natural, and so on.The yoga of luminous clarity (’od gsal ) is the heart of the path because the root of all practice is to realize that the abiding nature of all phenom-ena is naturally luminous clarity. The meaning of the name is that the inherent luminosity (rang ’od) of the abiding nature clarifi es [or illumi-nates] (gsal ) without restriction. Or “luminous clarity” is used because TOK_8-4_Final.indd 185TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1857/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"186 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeeven though there is no intrinsic nature, there is spontaneously present luminous appearance (snang ba).147Of many divisions, the twofold ones are the most prominent: example and actual; experience and realization; day and night; thin and thick; mother and child luminous clarity, and so forth. But there are also divi-sions into four or fi ve, such as natural luminous clarity and so forth, as in The Concise Illumination of the Five Stages, where it speaks of four kinds of luminous clarity: natural, of meditative absorption, concept-less clarity, and ultimate. Ronyam Dorjé’s Guhyasam›ja Commentary148 describes fi ve:Natural luminous clarity is illustrated; the luminous clarity of sleep illustrates it; one familiarizes with luminous clarity of the path; connects with luminous clarity at the time of death; and the luminous clarity of dharmak›ya is the result. The Latter Authoritative Text149 presents fi ve kinds of luminous clarity and the times when they arise:This luminous clarity is of fi ve kinds:Natural luminous clarity,Luminous clarity arising as consciousness,Luminous clarity of meditative absorption,Luminous clarity of suchness, andLuminous clarity of realization.150The times of those are fi ve:The time of death and of abiding in the central channel,When in meditative equipoise and in sleep,When meditation and postmeditation become one taste,When higher insight is realized.In short, the reality of the basic ground, which is free of extremes such as eternalism and nihilism, is objective luminous clarity. The realization of that reality just as it is is subjective luminous clarity. This simple layout comes from both sutra and mantra sources, so it is called “general lumi-nous clarity.” What is taught in the mantra highest tantras is called “hid-den meaning luminous clarity.” There are several arrangements because TOK_8-4_Final.indd 186TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1867/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 187diff erent names are used according to contexts. The example pristine awareness that is born during an empowerment and the luminous clar-ity of creation phase are similar to luminous clarity. All that arises from completion phase practice is genuine luminous clarity. The real luminous clarity that is presented on this occasion is a spe-cial real luminous clarity that is made evident. Once the actual illusory body or a similitude is gathered in the two meditative absorptions, lumi-nous clarity is made evident. That is the luminous clarity of training or beyond training, and there is no better luminous clarity than this. Th e Meditation Topics [2\"]This has three parts: the time of the ground, the time of the path, and the time of the result.Th e Time of the Ground [a\"]In practice, luminous clarity at the time of the ground is introduced.Here we will present what must be practiced from among those divi-sions. First, the nature of luminous clarity at the time of the ground must be introduced for what it is. The minds of all sentient beings are naturally luminous clarity. That pervading principle of all phenomena is called “the primordial luminous clarity of the basic ground” (gzhi gdod ma’i ’od gsal ). Concerning this there are many philosophical positions according to intellectual abilities. The Sautr›ntikas151 assert that luminous clarity is consciousness merely being aware of its own object. The Cittam›trins152 believe that it is refl exively aware, refl exively illuminated consciousness without subject-object dualism. The M›dhyamikas,153 such as Pakpa Namdrol and Haribhadra,154 make the mind’s emptiness of true exis-tence the natural luminous clarity and then teach that itself as the bud-dha nature affi nity.155 In the fi nal wheel of Dharma and the commentary on its viewpoint, the Highest Continuum, it is explained that the natural luminous clarity of mind and buddha nature are identical. This is not the same as the Cittam›trins, who believe that luminous clarity is the obscured neutral universal ground. Here it is held to be virtuous. TOK_8-4_Final.indd 187TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1877/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"188 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThere are many defi ning characteristics, but in short, since the essence of mind is naturally pure of any stains it is called “luminous clarity.” If you wonder what the diff erence is between this and the mind’s nature of luminous clarity as asserted by the Cittam›trins and lower philosophical schools, the Highest Continuum156 states:Since it is subtle, it is not an object of study.Since it is the absolute, it is not thinkable.Since it is the profound nature of phenomena, It is not the realm of meditation by the worldly and such.There is a great diff erence in being or not being the object of worldly people’s study, refl ection, and meditation.In this context of the profound path of skillful methods of highest tan-tra mantra, there are four distinctive assertions about the mind’s nature of luminous clarity: appearances as mind, mind as refl exive awareness, refl exive awareness as great bliss, and great bliss itself as united with emptiness. As for the stains that obscure that luminous clarity, in the causal vehicle it is, of course, held that once the objects [of attachment] are disproved,157 from that time on the mind that fi xates on them is relin-quished and cast off . Here in the highest tantra vehicle, it is by seeing the nature of mind that the obscuring stains are relinquished as a mat-ter of course. It is not asserted that affl ictive emotions are relinquished once objects are disproved. This position is illustrated by the example of people affl icted with jaundice who perceive a white conch as yellow. Even if they know that in truth it is white, that knowledge does not prevent the yellow appearance. When the jaundice clears up, the mind that perceives yellow ceases automatically. The method to see natural luminous clarity is taught in the “First Concise Account:”158Just as fi re that is always present in woodIs not seen by means of cutting or splittingBut twirling the rubbing stick on its base by handMakes what abides there become visible,In that way, the luminous clarity of mindWill not be seen by means of conceptual meditation.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 188TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1887/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 189It becomes visible by the joiningOf purifi ed left and right channels.Thus, the luminous clarity of mind will be seen based on the profound completion phase yoga that binds the dualistic energy-mind of the right and left channels in the central channel. This, then, is the so-called ground luminous clarity, and it is clearly introduced by saying “mind’s nature is thus.”Th e Time of the Path [b\"]At the time of the path, vital points of the support and supported are bound;Outer, inner, and common manifest awakenings are manifest.Of the fi ve occasions, sleep time is taken as the example.The arising of illusory body with instant or subsequent dissipation Stabilizes recognition...In ascertaining luminous clarity at the time of the path, the general technique is to rest evenly in the very essence of luminous clarity. Telopa said:159Rest relaxed within the uncontrived native state;Bonds are released and freedom is sure.This and other such instructions are expressed unanimously by the mighty adepts. Accordingly, with the body in the seven-point posture of meditative stability, the mind rests without support, relaxed and uncon-trived. This will create the unerring yogic direct perception of empti-ness.160 This is the ultimate esoteric instruction of the completion phase found in the profound tantras. The reason is that once the vital points of the vajra body, which is the support, are bound, the mind, eyes, and energy currents remain in a state of nonthought. Because of the special interconnection between body and mind, the movement in the right and left channels is stopped and immobilized within the central channel, causing the direct experience of mah›mudr›, emptiness with aspects.161Therefore the luminous mind, which is the supported, is realized as empty appearance arising as the mah›mudr› of forms of emptiness. This, TOK_8-4_Final.indd 189TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1897/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"190 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeagain, depends on the dissolution of the energy currents of the right and left channels in the central channel, the supreme support. There is no more profound method for aff ecting this dissolution than resting the mind once it is uncontrived and relaxed. Therefore, in all the esoteric instructions of highest tantra, this is called “the esoteric instruction of withdrawal” in the presentations.162 There is a special instruction for using a direct forceful method to identify luminous clarity. Through the profound meditative absorption in which the pure mandala of the environment and its inhabitants dis-solves into luminous clarity, the energy currents of the moon, sun, and r›hula163 are held at the heart center, causing luminous clarity to arise at the end of the three lights. If one trains in this right before going to sleep, one will easily recognize luminous clarity in sleep. If one recog-nizes that, one will also recognize the luminous clarity at death. There-fore it is known as the esoteric instruction that combines the three types of luminous clarity.In addition, binding the vital points of the support and supported164 will reveal the luminous clarity of the outer, inner, and common mani-fest awakenings.165 Outer manifest awakeningThe predawn sky is naturally totally pure; it transcends even the darkness of the interval when the moon’s light has set and the sun’s light has not yet risen. Likewise, having transcended the elaborated, unelaborated, and even the middle—illustrated by the sun, moon, and interval—the strength of wisdom does not conceive of anything at all like beginning, end, or in between. This teaching is held in common with the causal vehicle and is called the “outer manifest awakening.”Outer and inner [manifest awakenings]In terms of recognizing luminous clarity based on another’s body, the arising of the sun of warmth, skillful methods with passion, is the expe-rience of increase. The arising of the moon of bliss, wisdom without passion, is light. And the center, the interval that is neither one of those, is full culmination.166 Beyond that is the experience of great bliss, from which arises the luminous clarity of an instant in which the three times are not conceived in any way. Since this is also in creation phase, it is not the experience of the pristine awareness of luminous clarity that comes about from the force of actualizing the four empties internally,167 TOK_8-4_Final.indd 190TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1907/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 191but is nevertheless the manifest awakening through the force of connec-tion with an awareness-consort. Therefore, it is referred to as common to both outer and inner manifest awakenings. That is because in addi-tion to the presence of all the pure manifest awakenings described in the causal vehicle, luminous clarity is recognized at the climax of the three lights based on a spiritual partner.Inner manifest awakening In the fi rst awakening, the karmic energy currents for the most part dissolve into the wind energy currents,168 and one sees light with fi ve colors like a mirage. The second is when concepts associated with desire dissolve and there is the [experience of] light, like the arising of moon-light in a cloudless sky. The third is when anger dissolves and there is the increase of light, like the arising of sunlight. The fourth is when stupidity dissolves and there is the culmination of light, which is like the pervasion of darkness of the interval [between moonlight and daylight]. The fi fth is when all consciousness dissolves, and there is an instant of luminous clarity free of darkness. Since it is free from the darkness of perceived and perceiver (or subject and object), the luminous clarity of reality manifests to the eyes of nonconceptual pristine awareness. It is like someone without eye disease seeing through the true nature of illusory strands of hair.The Eighth Lord, Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, gave special oral instructions in this context for “manifest awakening when the consciousnesses are absorbed” (rnam shes sdud pa mngon byang) and “manifest awakening when pristine awareness arises” (ye shes ’char ba mngon byang).Now, as for applying this to practice, fi rst one develops the recogni-tion of the causal luminous clarity that has not yet been recognized. From the Oral Teachings of MañjuŸrı: 169The minds of embodied beings are refi ned When thoroughly familiar with experiences That occur in mere moments of death, faint, sleep,Yawning, and sexual union.In general, there are fi ve occasions that are explained in connection with the arising of luminous clarity. Of those, take the luminous clarity at the time of sleep as an example. The training is to recognize the emptiness of TOK_8-4_Final.indd 191TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1917/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"192 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeeverything, which is the last of the four empties, by uniting [meditation on] the fi ve seed-syllables in the avadhÒti.170 The essence of that luminous clarity is the sleep that occurs after the moments of consciousness before sleep has dissolved and before dream thoughts and energy-infl uenced sleep, during which there arise moments of consciousness in dreams that are similar to the earlier daytime states of consciousness that dissolved as one fell asleep. For ordinary people, that sleep in between daytime consciousness and dreams is obscured by stupidity. But for yogins it is the nonconceptual dharmak›ya—the pure pristine awareness of nondual bliss-emptiness—arising as luminous clarity like the core of a candle fl ame or the brilliant autumn sky. Nevertheless, since the three lights are impure, these are not the fi nal experiences of luminous clarity that are a direct perception of the ultimate truth. Therefore this should be known as example luminous clarity.171 Concerning example and real luminous clarity, example luminous clarity is that which is free from the manifestations of the two obscura-tions that are based on the delusion of sleep. It occurs through the force of gathering the energy-mind in the heart center by means of two kinds of meditative stability, and so forth. Real luminous clarity is ground luminous clarity freed from incidental stains. It occurs when the power-ful luminous clarity of the path has eliminated even the seeds of the two obscurations, which are the factors to be eliminated during the paths of seeing and meditation in relation to the delusion of sleep.In this way, when sleep has been refi ned by luminous clarity, the seeds of concepts of the aggregates and constituents are killed off . Then, like Lav›pa, if one performs the conduct of a bhasuku, one will achieve the illusory-like form in this very life.172 The methods for stabilizing luminous clarity once it has been rec-ognized by the esoteric instructions for recognizing are as follows. The interdependent connection or method of absorption of energy-mind causes the inner heat to blaze. This brings about the realization of the bliss-emptiness of the melting bodhicitta. One arises as the illusory form following the signs of energy-mind of the three lights with luminous clarity. In order to manifest the real luminous clarity, the very subtle energy-mind must enter into luminous clarity by means of the three types of conduct and the two types of meditative stability. The three types of conduct will be explained below.173 TOK_8-4_Final.indd 192TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1927/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 193The two types of meditative stability will be explained according to the Five Stages and the Lamp Summary of Conduct. The instant [medita-tive stability] (ril ’dzin) is withdrawal all at once, as illustrated by the vanishing of the condensation that forms when one breathes on a mirror. Subsequent dissipation (rjes gzhig) is the gradual withdrawal as illus-trated by the ice on a river or pond. Once the illusory body is allowed into luminous clarity through those two kinds of meditative stability, it will re-arise as a body that follows a reverse order of manifestation. That support of the trained illusory body will manifest the illusory body without training. As stated in the Full Awakening of Vairocana: 174This rainbow-like bodyWill be obtained by meditating on this very thing.To put this into practice, one trains in the joining and re-arising of the two types of meditative stability, with the three gates of oneself and all sentient beings as inseparable from the three vajras and their indestruc-tible sounds. That will dispel the manifest aspects of the two obscura-tions contained in the supported vital essences and their mount, the karmic energy currents. Then the clear autumn sky of luminous clarity will arise like the sky at dawn, free from the three adulterating condi-tions.175 When familiarization with that is perfected, the recognition of luminous clarity will be stable.Th e Time of the Result [c\"]...and the actual result is perfected.The guru points out just how one’s own mindstream is luminous clarity primordially present as the ground. Using the daytime and nighttime luminous clarity as the path, one will perfect the realization of the actual result, the abiding nature. That is the resulting luminous clarity. It is the same as the stage of union that is stated in the Latter Authoritative Text: 176From the actualization of luminous clarity,From that, union arises.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 193TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1937/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"194 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThis shows that the perfection of luminous clarity is [the state of primor-dial] union. In this context, the exalted Marpa says:Example luminous clarity is the pristine awareness that mani-fests by relying on another’s body, that of a wisdom consort. Real luminous clarity is the pristine awareness that arises when the universal ground dissolves into luminous clarity in the interval of full culmination. The essence of luminous clarity itself is that it is the space-pervading vajra awakening of all buddhas. The excellent quality of luminous clarity is that it frees from all tendencies to perpetuate bad states by clearing away the veiling darkness of full culmination, and it produces the dharmak›ya and rÒpak›ya, which abide neither in samsara nor nirvana.Those few words of vast meaning convey the whole corpus on the cause, path, and result of luminous clarity in its entirety.Intermediate State [ee']The intermediate state yoga that provides assurance has two parts: a general presentation of the meaning of the name and its divisions, and a specifi c explanation of the meditation topics.Th e Name and the Divisions [1\"]Of all intermediate states, existence is assurance.This yoga provides assurance about the path because it actualizes the state of union in the intermediate state of existence (srid pa bar do) through the single-minded assurance that was created by the practices of luminous clarity and illusory body. It is called “intermediate state” (bar do) because it does not fall into either side or because it abides in the middle between (bar) the former and the latter. It is classifi ed in numerous ways, such as the following. The exalted Milarepa listed six intermediate states: (1) the ultimate intermediate state of realityTOK_8-4_Final.indd 194TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1947/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 195 (2) the natural intermediate state of the path (3) the appearing intermediate state of birth and death (4) the intermediate state of dream and sleep (5) the fi nal intermediate state of existence (6) the rebirth intermediate state of a continuum.Milarepa also taught a division of eight intermediate states to Gampopa: (1) the intermediate state of view (2) meditation (3) conduct (4) dream (5) creation and completion (6) vital points (7) three k›yas (8) result.Lord Rechungpa taught six: (1) view (2) meditation (3) result (4) with and without passion (6) with and without faults (7) the intermediate state of words and meanings.Lord Khachöpa177 referred to four: (1) the unifi ed intermediate state of the four k›yas (2) the refl exive awareness intermediate state of pristine awareness (3) the temporal intermediate state of intrinsic nature (4) the unerring intermediate state of interdependence.The Easy Guide to the Wish-fulfi lling Heart of the Intermediate State178 gives four:Eradicate the intermediate state of birth and cessation,Equalize the intermediate state of self and other,Recognize the intermediate state of coming and going,Steer clear of the intermediate state of being and nonbeing.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 195TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1957/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"196 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeOf all these, Lord Marpa’s summary of three is widely known:The appearing intermediate state of birth and death, The dream intermediate state of sleep,The fi nal intermediate state of existence.The fi rst two of these are practiced as the path in the four root dharmas. So of all those divisions of the intermediate state, the topic of the expo-sition at hand, that is, the yoga that provides assurance, relates to the intermediate state of existence.The Compendium of Abhidharma179 states:Like the rising and falling of scales in a balanceIs the death transference and rebirth [of consciousness].This is saying that the cessation of death existence and the deluded inter-mediate state existence occur at the same time. So once beings have died and not yet taken birth, it is referred to as the “intermediate existence.” The characteristics [of a being in the intermediate state] are described in the Lamp Summary of Conduct: 180Beings totally relinquish their aggregates by stages as they enter the mandala of ultimate truth.

After they remain in the interim of transference for seven days, the virtu-ous or unvirtuous karma that comes from their own thoughts multiplies. Having obtained the causes and conditions, like a watermill again and again they will take rebirth as the fi ve kinds of beings and experience the subsequent suff ering of cyclic existence.

[Recognition of Luminous Clarity in the First Intermediate State] [a\"]At the time of death, the four elements and all coarse and subtle appear-ances and thoughts dissolve. The four empties along with the outer and inner appearing signs arise. When that happens, it is blended with pre-vious experiences from dharma practice, such as direct realization that happened during the instant or subsequent dissipation practices in rec-ognizing luminous clarity. Especially during the arising of the three lights and luminous clarity, one settles directly into the view that was introduced by the guru. If energy-mind dissolves into the central channel at the heart center during the luminous clarity of death, the elaborations of dualistic appearances will of course be completely quelled and something like the cloudless sky will arise. At that time, for those whose previous familiarization was excellent, it will be like meeting an old acquaintance or a traveler return-ing home. But even if one can settle in equanimity once that is recog-nized, it will not become the realization of the abiding nature without sustaining it by settling directly in the view with which one has earlier cut through doubts. Therefore, in this life one must exert oneself in the child or path luminous clarity,182 which is to ascertain the view of empti-ness and blend that in the meditation of great bliss.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 197TOK_8-4_Final.indd 1977/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeOf course most people maintain that the ground luminous clarity of death is the mother and the meditation on the path luminous clarity during day and night is the child. According to the view of Lord Marpa, Mila, and others, however, the mother is the natural luminous clarity that is the abiding nature of all phenomena, while the child is the lucid arising of meditative absorption in this waking state that comes from the interdependent connection of the gathering of the fi ve quintessences. That is because there is a connection between what is created and what creates it. In any case, if one is able to combine one’s familiarity with the four empties from the gathering of the vital energy in the central channel now in the waking state with the luminous clarity of deep sleep, then one will be able to blend the mother and child luminous clarity during the basic death state through the force of the energy currents. If one can do that, then one will undoubtedly recognize the arising of the intermediate states subsequent to that, and so it is a most sublime method of recogniz-ing the intermediate state.Once the dissolution process concludes, the white and red vital essences blend. The potency of the channels, energy currents, vital essences, and mind and all of the quintessences coalesce in the center of the heart and the meditative absorption of emptiness, clarity, and great bliss is born. At that point the heat of inner heat, fanned by the energy currents of pristine awareness, burns up all obscurations. The vital essence of quintessential bodhicitta stirs. For yogins and yoginıs who have practiced the path lumi-nous clarity, the power of their previous familiarity robs all the strength from delusion and obscuration in the supreme central channel. The r›hula of vajra pristine awareness devours all manifesting seeds of the dualistic sun and moon.183 Meditating at that point, the essence of the luminous clarity of the realization that arose during whichever was the primary meditation—bliss, clarity, or nonthought—based on the luminous clar-ity of the previously mentioned occasions will at this time be intensifi ed. The two obscurations will be conquered instantly by its power and one will attain freedom over the perfection of the two accumulations, like a wealth lord enjoying his wealth. Then, as is said, “bliss is sa ̇bhogak›ya and clarity is nirm› ̊ak›ya and nonthought is dharmak›ya.” This refers to enlightenment in the essence of the three k›yas as explained in the direct guides on the fi ve stages by previous masters. This is the infallible interdependent connection between the vajra body and mind.

But in this context, since the luminous clarity of death mainly accomplishes the dharmak›ya, we take it to mean that.[Refi ning the Energy of Illusory Body in the Second Intermediate State] [b\"] That same luminous clarity of the fi rst intermediate state occurs at the time of death for all sentient beings possessed of six constituents.184 However, those without some familiarity with the vital points of the esoteric instructions fail to recognize it or, if they do, they cannot remain with it. In those circumstances, the group of the fi ve gathered quintes-sences comes apart and disappears. Then consciousness and its mount, the vital energy current (srog rlung), leaves through whichever of the nine orifi ces is appropriate.185 As soon as awareness separates from the corpo-real body, it immediately raises up as a mental body of the intermediate state. That birth is the actual defi ning moment of the intermediate state of existence. The defi ning characteristics [of the beings in this interme-diate state] are as described before. On this occasion, most beings will be stricken by four frightening sounds,186 three terrifying abysses,187 and other such unspeakable horrors that are the apparent delusional mani-festations of the habitual patterns of unwholesome minds. For people who have created some merit, those perverse appearances will not arise. Rather they will have pure visions of being welcomed by gods rendering service and such, and will proceed from one pleasantry to the next.To make that intermediate state into an experience of the path, it must be recognized. In order to recognize it by means of the six defi nite signs, such as possessing miraculous action and so on,188 one must apply whatever dharma practice one is familiar with—whether Ÿr›vaka train-ing, mahayana awakening mind, mantra creation phase, yogic view, and so on—to whatever positive or negative appearances arise. Just recalling that training will protect from fear and automatically liberate from dan-ger. Therefore, one should not stray into those usual deluded appear-ances for even a moment. Keeping awareness in its true mind-state will strengthen consciousness and provide control over the energy currents. At that time, deluded appearances may arise fl eetingly, but they will be taken as the path.

Therefore, one should think, “right now is the intermediate state,” and integrate that with dharma practice. Par-ticularly when frightening or painful kinds of circumstances occur, one can imagine that they are the deluded appearances of the intermediate state. Then one either rests within that state of suchness or meditates intently on their illusory nature, the lack of true existence. From time to time, one applies intermediate state training intently in the present moment, such as by examining whether the six defi nite signs of the intermediate state are present or not. Recognizing the intermediate state and meditating on it as the path are more eff ective than other methods. As Lord N›ropa taught:In this intermediate state, the body, which combines energy and mind, is a most excellent support because the phenomena consistent with the sa ̇bhogak›ya have been present in it since the beginning. Furthermore, consciousness in a dream is seven times clearer than during daytime appearances, and the inter-mediate state consciousness is seven times clearer than in the dream, so it is easier to change. Since the consciousness has no support, it is diffi cult to stabilize mindful intention. But if one can maintain mindfulness, traversing the path will be trouble-free. Meditating for one session in that intermediate state may be liberating.However, an individual of the highest capacity need not depend on this kind of technique. It is taught in the Lamp Summary of Conduct and Oral Teachings189 and others that in place of the intermediate state that occurs at the end of the dying process for others, these [people of highest capacity] will attain a sa ̇bhogak›ya illusory body and become enlightened on the basis of that. That process is to identify the stages of death with its three lights and rest in equipoise for a while in that luminous clarity. Then, as the three lights in reverse order are about to arise, to revive oneself by the recollection that will incur the arising of the illusory body. That is, to arise instantly in the illusory body of the empty appearance of the dei-ty’s form. Again, since that is refi ned by the ultimate luminous clarity, it surpasses the intermediate state existence of impure cyclic existence.

That is why the previous masters said, “the lazy awaken in the intermediate state.”[Choosing Rebirth by Blocking the Entrances to Wombs] [c\"]Those who are not liberated in the second intermediate state will wan-der in the intermediate state anywhere from one week at the least to seven weeks at the most. Since they have no body in the intermedi-ate state existence they become very distressed and then, as four-name vagabonds,190 their consciousness is dragged around by energy currents and habitual patterns. Out of control, they seek a place to take birth, devouring smells.191 Roaming around the entrance to wombs, the fi ve karmic energy currents stir and the fi ve toxic emotions gather. From the interdependent relationship of mind and appearance there may arise the fi ve light-paths of perfection,192 the good and bad wombs of six types of beings, or the appearances of four types of birthplace. When these happen, one focuses on the vital points of whatever dharma practice is familiar. As the cause, one will uncontrollably enter the light-paths of perfection. As condition, it brings to mind the meditative absorption that inhibits the notions of one who enters and the entry place in those who would take birth at this rebirth juncture. If nothing prevents it, then the choice of womb entrance will be as stated in the Verses on the Path of Method: 193Fourth is choosing a womb entrance.Those whose training is very weak In birth, death, and dream intermediate states,If they cannot attain awakening in the intermediate state,Should apply instructions for choosing a womb.As impetus, do this:Form a strong resolve with thoughtsOf miraculously taking birth In the pure land of BlissOr in the Lotus pure land.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 201TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2017/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"202 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeForm a resolve by thinking,“Even if I must enter a mother’s womb,May I take a meritorious bodyThat can benefi t sentient beings,Or be a Brahmin or world ruler.”Wherever you direct your thoughtsIs where you will undoubtedly go,Like [the fi ring of] a catapult or mechanism.One should engage with the same attitudeAs the bodhisattvas.

It is called “transference” (’pho ba) because one traverses to another state, or because it takes one somewhere despite the lack of inherent nature. The Latter Authoritative Text explains eleven divisions:There is a great deal of division in transference:Transference as training, and meditative absorption,TOK_8-4_Final.indd 202TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2027/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 203Transference by exertion and vital energy,Transference by physical exertion,Transference of consciousness to the guru,Transference in forceful methods,Transference to dharmak›ya without elaboration,Transference to rÒpak›ya with elaboration,Transference to the sa ̇bhogak›ya,Transference to the nirm› ̊ak›ya,Transference to the ̃›kinı that is pleasant.Many early works give three divisions as the transference of dharmak›ya, sa ̇bhogak›ya, and nirm› ̊ak›ya. Another threefold list is transference as training, transference of physical adjustment, and transference in forceful methods. Again, there is transference by substance, the force of energy currents, and meditative absorption. Twofold divisions are trans-ference to a higher state and entrance into a residence; and with or with-out a support, and so on. Lord Khachö Wangpo spoke of three divisions: “ultimate transference of the ultimate great secret, innate transference of the native state, and luminous appearance transference of magical display.” There are limitless such divisions.The purpose of this path is very significant, as stated in Oral Teachings: 194Using this ritual, any sentient beingWill become liberated by it,Even those who commit acts of immediate consequenceOr ignorantly kill a Brahmin every day.However, this refers to those who may have committed sinful actions in this life but again take empowerments and keep their sacred pledges properly, fi rst practice creation phase, and then do the special comple-tion phase applications of channels and energy currents. Common evil-doers who do a bit of energy training and transference visualization will not gain the genuine results of the training, though some benefi t will accrue due to the blessings of the visualization. Transference is said to be the instruction for awakening without meditating. This means that with the especially profound esoteric TOK_8-4_Final.indd 203TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2037/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"204 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeinstructions of transference, even great evildoers who would otherwise fall into bad existences can sometimes postpone the results of negative action and take an excellent rebirth in a higher realm that supports man-tra practice. From that point of view, with the special support for accom-plishing buddhahood, one will attain just that. There is also the idea that one will accomplish it gradually through practice, based on that support. Is that the same thing? It says in Oral Teachings: In case you do not attain the three k›yas,You will most likely become an awareness-holderAnd gradually attain mah›mudr›.Thus one attains the state of awareness-holder through transference, and in that life as awareness-holder meditates on the rest of the path and attains a state such as the fi rst spiritual level that can be referred to by the conventional term “buddha.” It is also explained as carrying this intention.To accomplish the authentic yoga of transference, one refi nes the yoga of vase-breathing, causing the downward-expelling energy current to ignite the blazing fi re of inner heat. Using the force of the energy cur-rent, one must be able to move the indestructible energy-mind at the heart from its own abode as far as the crown of the head (gtsug tor) and pierce it. The Vajra ̃›ka states,The limits of abiding must be purifi ed.Once purifi ed, if the existence to be transferredGoes elsewhere, it is meaningless.Binding the doors of vase-breathing,The apertures of the doors will be purifi ed.This is also taught in the Catu ̄pı ̨ha and Sampu ̨a tantras. According to the explanation by Bhavabhadra,195 this means that the abode of joy and pain is the body and its limit is the ultimate central channel. If that channel is not purifi ed by training with fi re, energy, and resolve in the yoga of inner heat, then transference will not be accomplished and one will become exhausted for nothing.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 204TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2047/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 205Th e Meditation Sequence [2\"]Is transference in luminous clarity, illusory body, and creation phase.Lord Rangjung and others describe transference from the perspective of the Former and Latter Authoritative Texts as threefold: the highest transference in luminous clarity, the intermediate in illusory body, and the lowest in creation phase. [Transference in Luminous Clarity] [a\"]One becomes familiarized with the profound vital point of uniting the wisdom that realizes the abiding nature just as it is and the meditative absorption that abides one-pointedly within that state. Then, as death approaches, when the signs of the progressive dissolution of the elements arise, one rests eff ortlessly without resting or a place to rest, directly upon the unmistaken view of suchness that is free of any reference to the three spheres: transferring, something to be transferred, and a destina-tion. That will blend inseparably with the luminous clarity of the basic ground, like pouring water into water. Death, which is designated as the fi rst intermediate state, is thus enlightenment in the dharmak›ya.[Transference in Illusory Body] [b\"]This is for those of intermediate faculties who will not recognize the luminous clarity at the end of the three lights and the dissolution process of the death phase, or who might recognize it but cannot remain in it. They should revive themselves with their previous impetus by thinking, “I will rise up in the illusory body of sa ̇bhogak›ya,” and rise up as the deity’s illusory form at the end of the three lights in reverse order. That itself also involves refi nement through the process of ultimate lumi-nous clarity. Once one manifests the illusory form of union—like a fi sh leaping out of the water—totally transcending the intermediate state of cyclic existence, it is called awakening in the sa ̇bhogak›ya intermedi-ate state. In this lineage, the previous masters have asserted that the fi rst two transference practices and the fi rst two intermediate state practices are no diff erent.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 205TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2057/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"206 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge[Transference in the Creation Phase] [c\"]The third has four parts: transference that is mental training, transfer-ence that is physical adjustment, transference with forceful methods, and transference of entrance to a residence.

One must then abandon transference when it is untimely and only apply the activity when the time has come.198[Transference Th at Is Physical Adjustment] [ii\"]When training has not been fi nalized but one suddenly faces death, one prepares by generating the resolve to awaken and devotion in the pres-ence of a blessed support. Taking the posture of the tath›gata when entering nirvana and applying the seed-syllable of nonarising,199 one enters into a pure realm. This is said to be a profound instruction that produces tremendous benefi t for ordinary people and animals.[Transference with Forceful Methods] [iii\"]Those whose previous bad karma will defi nitely cause them to be mur-dered or something like that should apply the vital point of the body, yogic exercise; the vital point of the mind, transcendence of the three times;200 and the vital point of the speech, the application of two and a half vowels and consonants.201 One will instantly take a special support [in the next life] for practicing mantra.[Transference of Entering a Residence] [iv\"]It is explained that an auxiliary is entering from residence to residence.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 206TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2067/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 207The Concise Illumination202 states: The conclusive, quick path is transference.Entering a residence is an auxiliary.This is an auxiliary of transference to a higher pristine awareness. It is called “entering a residence” (grong ’jug) because the consciousness moves from the residence of one’s own body and enters into the residence of another’s unimpaired body that has died. This instruction is taught in a great many of the highest tantras. But an individual who undertakes this must be someone who has appropriately obtained the empower-ment, properly maintained the vows and pledges, and trained in the creation phase, which is just like transference in general. In particular, it is taught in the root tantras and their commentaries, such as Vajra ̃›ka, Catu ̄pı ̨ha, and Sampu ̨a, that for all three kinds of transference—the special transference, one’s own consciousness entering another’s body, and ejecting another’s consciousness that enters into one’s own body—one needs abilities. One must have the ability to block the energy cur-rents after placing letters at the nine orifi ces; the ability to insert the vital energy into the avadhÒti once those orifi ces are refi ned through vase breathing; and the ability to evoke the hÒ ̇ letter of consciousness with its mount of the subtle vital energy at the heart through the force of igniting the short a in the yoga of inner heat. Why are those required? Once one sees that a body does not serve the welfare of oneself or others, one takes a better one. This applies to such cases as exchanging a support that is of an inferior class for a good class, a sick one for a healthy one, an old one for a young one, and so forth. Based on the new body, the impetus of the path is extended. Since it is the latter body that accomplishes it, this is also called “entering a residence to extend the path.” The practice of this is described in Vajra Lines of the Hearing Lineage: 203With mastery of energy mind, and stability of creation and completion,Propel the consciousness seed-syllable into a fl awless corpse.And in the Six Dharmas Combined,204 N›ropa sings [to Marpa]:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 207TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2077/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"208 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeWhen your body reaches its time limitThe vital point is to use a qualifi ed object, the other condition.In between, the seed-syllable rides the horse of energy currents.Through yogic exercise, the vital essences, energy currents, and mindVacate your body like an empty house.The other’s body is the very essence of nirm› ̊ak›ya.This is called “instructions for entering a residence.” Translator, are your energy currents workable?Thus, fi rst one trains, then checks it, and fi nally applies the activity.

One’s root guru is thus whoever was the source of one’s mah›mudr› realization, and that practice system has not deteriorated right up until the present.

There is not the slightest quality that was not there before that needs to be newly created and added because the essence of the qualities has existed inherently since forever. For these reasons, the buddha nature constituent is empty of artifi cial, incidental stains that have the characteristic of being completely separable from that essence. But the constituent is not empty of the unsurpassed buddha qualities, such as the ten powers, that are its own genuine nature and have the characteristic of being completely inseparable from it. For example, when a jaundiced person sees a white conch shell as yellow, the conch itself is empty of the projected yellow but not empty of the white. Thus the desire to remove stains and the desire to add qualities are both obscuring conceptualizations of hope and fear and ought to be abandoned. The genuine suchness is the ordinary mind of the present moment, appear-TOK_8-4_Final.indd 210TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2107/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 211ance and emptiness inseparable, neither true nor false. Without corrupting it with acceptance or rejection, one should look at just that suchness with the wisdom of one’s own refl exive awareness and meditate. The “view” (lta ba) is to know and see with discernment. “Medita-tion” (sgom pa) is to rest one-pointedly within that without distraction. Concerning how to do this, the honorable Rangjung said:213Everything is neither true nor false,The wise deem it all to be like water-moons.This ordinary mind itselfIs called essence of the victors, the realm of reality. And in order to clarify further, glorious Khachö Wangpo said:This simple clarity of appearance-awareness in the present momentIs the very face of the relative truth of phenomena.If you know the vital point of this uncontrived norm,Then the ultimate truth is also just this.Scholars of scriptural sophistry cite the two truthsWith many references and reasonings but miss the point.Holding the two as diff erent violates the nondual.The relative truth is the incidental stains, like the yellow projected on the conch. The ultimate truth is the buddha nature, like the white of the conch. That is, there is only an appearance perceived by a confused subject. Other than that, the object of the conch itself has no white or yellow to be added or removed. Therefore, the esoteric instruction is to rest undisturbed in the uncontrived state. In short, what are called “samsara” and “nirvana” are posited only from the perspective of mere appearances in relative reality. The inherent nature of them both is luminous clarity free of elaboration, which is said to be “buddha nature” (bde bar gshegs pa’i snying po, Skt. sugatagarbha). Therefore, in the defi nitive meaning, mere appearance and its inherent nature are not divisible into separate things, like fi re and its heat.For that reason, the Mother [Perfection of Wisdom sutras] say such things as, “Form is empty; emptiness is form,” and so on.214 The honor-able Rangjung said:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 211TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2117/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeMah›mudr›, the abiding nature free of elaboration,Is empty of all characteristics of conceptual elaboration.Without fi xation on its clarity, this pure inherent nature Is called the buddha nature.Concerning this, the dharma lord Sakya Panchen215 asserted:Mah›mudr› is not designated in the tradition of the perfec-tions. The pristine awareness of mah›mudr› only arises from empowerment.Adhering to this position, the bigshots broadcast much meaningless chatter, but as the master Jñ›nakırti stated in Entry into Suchness: 216The other term for the Mother Perfection of Wisdom is mah›mudr›, because it is the very essence of nondual pristine awareness.Not only did he explain the use of the term in both the perfection of wisdom taught in the sutras and the mah›mudr› of mantra, he also explained the designations of the names:Those of the highest faculties who thoroughly exert themselves in the perfections can be truly possessed of mah›mudr›, even as an ordinary person, through meditating on calm abiding and higher insight. With this genuine realization, the signs of irreversibility will manifest.Sahajavajra also explained it in a similar way, which will come up below.217 Dakpo Rinpoché induced the realization of mah›mudr› even in beginners who had not received empowerment. Therefore this is the tradition of the perfections. These are instructions arising primarily from the Kadampa tradition. The esoteric instruction found in the second part of Joined Coemergent Mah›mudr›218 written by the lord and those of this present system are similar in all respects.

With this in mind, the honorable Lord Mikyö Dorjé said:The authentic spiritual power of mah›mudr› in the Kagyu, the lineage of the great N›ropa that began with Vajradhara, is only attained by actualizing the example and authentic ulti-mate pristine awareness by means of the higher three supreme empowerments. The system of guidance in calm abiding and higher insight taught these days that is shared with the causal vehicle of the perfections comes from the lineage of the protector AtıŸa. It is the esoteric instruction of The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment. Lord Gampopa and the protector Pakmo Drupa have given this the name of “joined coemergent mah›mudr›” (phyag chen lhan cig skyes sbyor) just for the sake of those disciples in the degenerate age who would like a “really high” vehicle. It has been the practice of most of Dakpo’s heart disciples to present the mah›mudr› instructions after having fi rst bestowed the empower-ment. This is the position of the customary path held in common by sutra and mantra.[Th e Mantra Tradition] [bb]In general, the conventional designation of the term mah›mudr› (phyag rgya chen po, “great seal”) is used only in the mantra vehicle. It means this: the state of union is “seal” (phyag rgya, Skt. mudr›), while its inherent nature that pervades all phenomena is “great” (chen po, Skt. maha[nt]) because no phenomena are beyond it. Here, the entire extent of outer appearances is the union of appearance and emptiness; the entire extent of inner awareness is the union of awareness and emptiness, and the entire extent of feelings when appearance and awareness meet is the union of bliss and emptiness. Of these, the fi rst two are called “emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects” (rnam kun mchog ldan gyi stong nyid) and the last is called “supreme and unchanging great bliss” (mchog tu mi ’gyur ba’i bde ba chen po). The name mah›mudr› is also used to describe emptiness and great bliss individually:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 213TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2137/10/09 1:59:05 PM7/10/09 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"214 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeBeyond the reality of subtle particles,Of the nature of magical mirror images, She who is endowed with the supreme of all aspects,To Lady Mah›mudr› I bow.And:Mah›mudr› is unchanging bliss.The total perfect meaning is this: emptiness endowed with all aspects is the object to be known. When the knowledge of this emptiness in its entirety as unchanging great bliss is the knowing subject, then both object and subject are said to blend into one. From the Supreme Original Buddha Tantra: 220Refl ections arising from emptiness are the cause,Bliss born from the unchanging is the result.The result seals the cause,And the cause also seals the result.And:The k›ya of knower and known as one.Initially, the time that this is actualized is when the fourth empower-ment is received. Ultimately, the realization is when one obtains and consummates the state of Vajradhara endowed with seven aspects.221 Coemergence is twofold: Natural coemergence is the beginningless and endless existence of Vajrasattva in all animate and inanimate things, without any distinction of before or after. The coemergent bliss of melt-ing is produced from the four joys arising successively from the sexual union of method and wisdom. This causes the engagement with the former, actual coemergence, so the same language is used.The meditation method is not the mere conceptual meditation used on the path of inference, with the nonaffi rming negation that is the result of logically analyzing and not fi nding anything.

The meaning can be summed up by the phrase “maintain luminous clarity directly upon appearances.” Those skilled in this method will purify conceptual fi xation on the reality of appearances and transform all appearance into forms of emptiness. The forms of emptiness—such as smoke and so on that appear during dark retreats and other practices—are merely signs and indications on this path of methods that cause the realization of the abiding nature itself that was not yet realized. What one must actually realize with absolute certainty is that all of these ordinary appearances, right here and now, are themselves forms of emptiness in every respect.Therefore, the teachings about there being nothing to add to the luminous clarity of buddha nature from the Highest Continuum223 and the way to meditate on the mah›mudr› of inseparable appearance-emp-tiness in the mantra tradition must both be the same view of abiding nature as the middle way (dbu ma, Skt. madhyamaka).

It has no bias in any direction whatsoever and is free from all extremes of elaboration such as exis-tence, nonexistence, eternalism, or nihilism. Therefore it is beyond the object of expression in speech or thought. From the beginning it has not experienced bondage through delusion or liberation through realization. Its vital point, which does not exist as a specifi cally characterized phe-nomenon,227 pervades like space throughout all phenomena of samsara and nirvana. This is the abiding nature—mah›mudr›, the perfection of wisdom, buddha nature, the original buddha, the causal continuum, and so forth—many names are used in the sutras and tantras. It is nondual profundity and clarity, the absolute truth, the totally pure ground of purifi cation, and the very essence of mind that has been explained and will continue to be explained. It is the abiding nature of all that is to be known.Th e Mode of Delusion [ii']The mode of delusion appears but is not real;Natural, perfectly pure luminous clarity is the vajra of mind. When its natural expressive energy is not aware of its own essence, the affl icted mind stirs from the universal ground. On the strength of that, aware-ness is taken to be a self and its refl exive appearance is taken to be an object; [this is] the basic subject-object split. Under the power of this dualistic perception, various karmic action and habitual patterns are accumulated, turning into an interlinking chain of delusion and end-less drifting in cyclic existence. This mode of delusion is relative truth. It is the incidental stains of the mind that are to be refi ned away. Since they do not abide as its basic character, they appear and yet are not truly existent. Therefore, one can become liberated through the antidote of self-recognition.

That is, its unborn basic char-acter is dharmak›ya, its unhindered radiance is sa ̇bhogak›ya, and its expressive energy arising as anything at all is nirm› ̊ak›ya. All three are essentially inseparable and spontaneously present since forever. This is the way it is. By recognizing it, [one realizes that] the native state of all phenomena, suchness free of accepting, rejecting, adopting, or removing anything in the wheel of infi nite basic space is the abiding nature of the ground. This is the recognition of the view of mah›mudr›.Path Mahāmudrā: Th e Way to Traverse the Levels and Paths through Naturally Occurring Calm Abiding and Higher Insight [c']This presentation has three parts: a presentation of the meditative absorption of practice, cutting off the treacherous path of strayings and deviations,228 and a description of the way the stages of the four yogas arise.Meditative Absorption [i']At the time of the path, coemergent mind itself is dharmak›ya,Coemergent appearance is dharmak›ya’s light.No distraction, no meditation, without fabrication in the native state.At the time of the path, making the meaning of the view that one has ascertained into yoga is called mah›mudr› meditation. The great chari-oteers who founded this system laid out this process: in order to give rise to meditation that has not arisen before, one engages in [two sets of] four preliminary practices.229 Once it has arisen, it is brought to the path by three introductions. Then there are the ways to enhance it and generate good qualities.

Train-ing in these until signs of their accomplishment arises, one’s mind will turn towards the dharma and dharma will become the path.[Th e Introduction to Mind’s Nature] [bb']The Inconceivable Coemergence Tantra230 states:Mind itself is coemergent with dharmak›ya.Appearance is coemergent with dharmak›ya’s light.Appearance and mind inseparable are coemergent.In accordance with the mighty spiritual adepts who commented on the meaning with limitless vajra speech, it is maintained that the introduc-tion to coemergence is subsumed into three: (1) Coemergent native mind itself is dharmak›ya. That is introduced with calm abiding and higher insight. Calm abiding is practiced both with and without support. In higher insight there are three stages: reveal-ing the essence, recognition, and introduction. These will dispel delu-sion on the path.(2) Mind’s own expressive energy is coemergent with thought. The three methods of practicing with the abiding or moving of thoughts, back-to-back thoughts, and cutting through ego-fi xation will cause the thought process to blend with dharmak›ya.(3) Mind’s own radiance—appearance—is coemergent with dharmak›ya’s own light. One conclusively distinguishes the refl exive appearances of uncontrived awareness and the deluded appearances of fi xated mind. Realizing reality itself to be the play of the native state, delusion will arise as pristine awareness.

Through these ways of resting, all the concep-tual elaborations in the three times are naturally liberated and subside into reality. This is the meaning of the three doors of total freedom. Cutting Off the Treacherous Path of Straying and Deviation [ii']Liberation from four strayings and three deviations.When meditating like this, fi xation on the emptiness of all phenomena is to stray in the basic nature. Being satisfi ed with the attainment of just a little understanding and experience of emptiness, and so discontinu-ing accumulation of merit and purifi cation, is to stray on the path of emptiness. Once one has made emptiness the path, hope of fruition at some later time without understanding that the thing to reject and its antidote are inseparable is to stray in the antidote. And one can stray in the intellectually fabricated sealing of appearance with emptiness. These are the four areas of straying based on higher insight.If one gets attached to the three experiences of bliss, clarity, and non-thought, then one will cycle into the three realms respectively and devi-ate from the spiritual path. These are the three deviations to avoid based on calm abiding. One must also escape the treacherous paths where emptiness, compassion, and cause and eff ect rise up as enemies.Th e Way the Stages of the Four Yogas Arise [iii']Beyond the four joys and three conditions, three ways of arisingMake the connection and one traverses the four stages of yoga.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 220TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2207/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 221Since the four joys are just an example of pristine awareness, real pristine awareness goes beyond them. Since the three conditions of bliss, clarity, and nonthought are meditative experiences, the innate countenance of realization transcends them. It is beyond even the objects of the three kinds of wisdom: the understanding from listening, the experience from contemplating, and the experiential perceptions from meditating. Once one has arrived at the vital point of meditation that is untouched by the mind of the big three affl ictive emotions, the stages arise in any of three ways: gradually, by leaps and bounds, or all at once. With that connec-tion, one will eff ortlessly traverse the inner levels and paths by way of the four yogas: one-pointedness, freedom from elaborations, one taste, and nonmeditation—each with the division into lesser, medium, and greater, making twelve in all.232The stages of these four yogas are described in the Ali Kali Inconceivable Secret Tantra: 233The absorption of the majestic lion234Clarifi es consciousness as unmoving, one-pointed, and radiant.Refl exive pristine awareness is awakened from within.Stabilized patience eliminates the suff ering of the lower realms.Second, by the illusory-like absorption,235In the great equipoise free of elaborations,The inconceivable arises as the creative energy of absorption.Attaining warmth is gaining control over birth.Third, by the absorption of heroic behavior,236The tenth level realization of the single taste of many arises.

There are various ways of explanation found among all the extensive and concise arrangements done by the great spiritual adepts who hold the Kagyu lineage. Mainly, by dividing each of the four yogas into the understand-ing, experience, and realization of mah›mudr›, one gets twelve divi-sions. Each of those is further divided into lesser, middling, and greater degrees of attaining stability, making thirty-six in all. Alternatively, the four yogas each have mundane and supermundane calm abiding, and mundane and supermundane higher insight, making sixteen divisions. Dividing each of those by greater, medium, and lesser degrees of attain-ing stability, which become the three categories of excellent, low, and average, it makes forty-eight in all. To wrap up it all up into one, the omniscient Chen-nga Chökyi Drakpa240 said:In this context the four yogas according to the system of guid-ance in the mantra tradition of mah›mudr› are explained as the pristine awareness of mah›mudr› that is the essence of the four descending and ascending joys. In terms of the system of guidance common to both sutra and mantra, it refers to the mode of arising of mah›mudr› experiences similar to these four joys. Concerning the terms “understanding” (go ba), “experience” (nyams), and “realization” (rtogs), the Eighth Lord Mikyö Dorjé stated in his Hundred Thousand Expressions of Mah›mudr›: 241 The view and meditation of whatever is to be realized has three parts: understanding, experience, and realization. Understand-ing occurs when what is to be realized becomes an object of wisdom through hearing and contemplating the terms and concepts. Experience occurs when what is to be realized is held as the frame of reference and then becomes the object of wisdom resulting from meditation in the abiding aspect of that mental focus.

Cutting off all doubts about this meaning, one will reach an irrevocable understanding through the direct introduction. One gains experience of this through the meditation of settling the mind without contrivance directly in its own state, the abiding nature. This is enhanced by the conduct that arises automati-cally as a result of unhindered emptiness and compassion in union. The realization of the intrinsic nature of the abiding nature manifests, and when it is perfected, that is the fruition. Buddha is found in the mind. By encountering the very face of the three k›yas, dharmak›ya mah›mudr› is no longer a wish for the future but is attained right now.This gradual path accords with Dakpo Rinpoché’s dream visions and Milarepa’s prophecies. Dakpo Rinpoché said, “With these Kadampa teachings I can benefi t many beings,” and, “Now whatever bit of good I have done for sentient beings is due to the kindness of the Kadampa lamas.” Once he dreamt that by beating a drum many wild deer came to listen and he fed them milk.242 These and other reasons caused him to remain with this system of guidance. This is because we have reached the age where degeneration is rampantly increasing and there are progres-sively fewer individuals with the fortune to practice the extraordinary vajray›na. However, those of lesser fortune and duller faculties can be guided by the gradual stages of the path of the three types of individuals and ultimately evolve into disciples of the highest fortune and become worthy recipients of the extraordinary mantra. They can gain liberation in one lifetime or, even if not, a great many of them will see the mean-ing of mah›mudr› and thereby enter the irreversible path through this method. This is the intention.

In addition, when the fortunate ones are taught mantra’s pro-found path of method, these instructions are named “instructions at the time of the cause,” or “foundational teachings.” About this, the great reverend one of Jonang243 said such things asThese days the so-called abiding nature mah›mudr›Is a meditation sequence in the sutra tradition of the fi nal turning.For the diff erent levels of faculties it is congruent with mantra,And so it becomes like a lamp for beings.It is similar to the path with result practitioners’ three appearances.244Th e Mantra Tradition [2']The mantra tradition arises from the path of skillful methods.The famous “great bliss mah›mudr›” (bde chen phyag rgya chen po) comes from the traditional methods of the highest inner tantras. It arises from the paths of skillful methods, which include the conferral of the supreme empowerment, the self-blessing, the stages of mudra practice, and so on. The mighty Marpa said:The essence of the completion phase is that great bliss arises based on bliss.And from the second chapter [of the Hevajra Tantra], “The Examina-tion of Illusion,” it says:245In this yoga of the completion phaseBliss is called “great bliss.”The etymology is that since pristine awareness really arises it is called “completion phase” (rdzogs rim). The one from Pu ̋pahari [N›ropa] said:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 224TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2247/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"marpa kagyu \u0003 225It is impossible for pristine awareness not to arise when at this time your body is put in this posture and your mind is focused like this.These are the divisions: The bases of refi ning are the waking state with many ordinary thoughts, deep sleep, the dreaming of many dreams, and sexual union with an ordinary person. The refi ning agents are mah›mudr› based on inner heat, mah›mudr› based on luminous clarity, mah›mudr› based on illusory body, and experience based on action-mudra. Thus according to this teaching it will be realized from the meditation on the instructions of the Six Dharmas of glorious N›ropa, and so forth.Th e Essence Tradition [3']The essence is the descent of vajra pristine awarenessSimultaneously ripening and liberating those of highest faculties.More profound than the previous two, this path to forcefully realize the profound essence is extraordinarily amazing and incredible. Just the descent of blessings in the vajra pristine awareness empowerment bestowed by a realized guru on a fortunate student of the highest and sharpest faculties awakens ordinary mind in his or her innermost heart, causing realization and liberation to occur at the same time. Since it does not depend on elaborate techniques or strenuous training, it is this that really occurs in the prolifi c246 liberation stories and legends of the great spiritual adepts of the four greater and eight lesser Kagyu lineages who had arrived at the higher levels. And this is the way it is described in IndrabhÒti’s Accomplishment of Pristine Awareness: 247Conferral of the vajra pristine awareness empowermentThat attains the sublime excellent pristine awareness ofThoroughly abandoning all thoughtBrings accomplishment of the supreme spiritual power.If you have all genuine pristine awarenessesBut still take empowerments elsewhere, Using mandalas that are drawn,This will damage your sacred pledge.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 225TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2257/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"226 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThe suff erings of damaged pledgesAre that your body and likewise your mindAnd all functions will deteriorateAnd very quickly death will come.

Miracles of accomplishment pervaded all the realms. The root of all these dharma doors that are revealed con-tinuously throughout the three times is this: Individuals of lesser intel-lect should train their mindstreams with the four preliminary teachings. Those of medium faculties should train in the postures as the vital point of the body, the vital energy control as the vital point of the energy cur-rents, visualization as the vital point of the mind, and the physical train-ing as the vital point of yogic exercise. The root of all four of these is the yoga of inner heat with its bliss-heat. When that occurs, individuals of the highest faculties are introduced to the three k›yas and guided on the genuine path of instantaneous mah›mudr›. Furthermore, [when N›ropa said to Marpa], “In the lower fl oor of Pullahari, unhindered nirm› ̊ak›ya rains down,” it was the symbolic indication for the introduction to nirm› ̊ak›ya in relation to relative awakening mind. “In the middle fl oor of Pullahari, sa ̇bhogak›ya indi-cates with symbols” was the symbolic indication for the introduction to sa ̇bhogak›ya in relation to energy control. There was no symbolic indication for the introduction to dharmak›ya in relation to the vital point of the natural resting in the native state because that transcends designations. The infi nite realization of mah›mudr› is naturally occur-ring pristine awareness.

It is also one that he took on as his own personal practice, and he consid-ered himself a direct heir to the lineage. The fi rst Tibetan and therefore founder of the lineage was Khyungpo Naljor of the ancient Khyung clan that had produced many great adepts. Khyungpo Naljor was born in a Tiger Year probably in the late tenth century and is reputed to have lived for one hundred and fi fty years, but the precise dates vary widely. Kongtrul identifi es four branches and miscellaneous subsidiaries.*The long lineage originates with Khyungpo Naljor receiving the “quin-tessence of the mind” of one hundred and fi fty scholar-adepts. These included four root gurus, thirteen especially exalted gurus, and two ̃›kinıs, Niguma and Sukhasiddhı, who had heard the dharma directly from the buddha Vajradhara. Although Khyungpo Naljor had already studied and mastered the traditions of Bön and Nyingma, he went in search of the profound teachings of sutra and tantra from India. He accomplished the practice of the fi ve tantric deities (rgyud sde lha lnga) in the fi ve centers of his body. These are Hevajra, the culmination of inner heat; Cakrasa ̇vara, the culmination of action-mudra; Guhyasam›ja, the culmination of illusory body and luminous clarity; Mah›m›y›, the cul-mination of dream; and Vajrabhairava, the culmination of enlightened activity. He established his seat at Zhang-zhong in the Shang region of *Synopsis based on The Treasury of Knowledge, Book 4, Part 3 (TOK 1: 533-538).TOK_8-4_Final.indd 233TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2337/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"234 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeWestern Tsang. Henceforth he was known as the Guru of Shang, and the holders of his lineage became known as the Shangpa Kagyu. Khyungpo Naljor’s teachings can be subsumed into three: those of exegesis, debate, and practice. Of all of these, it is only the essence of the last one—the stages of practice—which has lasted until the present day. This is known as the fi ve dharma cycles that are the root of the Golden Dharmas of Niguma and Sukhasiddhı. That is, the fi ve cycles of Niguma, Sukhasiddhı, Vajr›sana, Maitrıpa, and R›hula, along with various miscellaneous precepts. Khyungpo Naljor had fi ve principal early disciples and one later one who were foremost among eighteen thousand spiritual friends. The fi ve early ones were Me-u Tönpa, Yarpo Gyamoché, Ngultön Rinwang, Tökön Chögkar, and Zhangom Chöseng. The later one was Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsöndrü (1110-1170?). The transmission of the one-to-one lin-eage of the secret words of Vajradhara fell only to Mokchokpa. From him, one by one, it was transmitted to Wöntön Kyergangpa (or Chokyi Sengé, 1143-1216), Sangyé Nyentön (or Rigongpa, 1175-1255), and Drogön Tönpa (or Sangyé Tönpa, 1207-1278). The vajra seal that limited it as a one-to-one lineage was lifted by the “seventh jewel” of that lineage, Drogön Tönpa. From then on Tibet was fi lled with followers of this lineage. Foremost among them were Tsangma Shangtön (1234-1309), Samdingpa Zhönnudrup, and Jakchen Gyaltsenbum (1261-1334). These three scholar-adepts established the foundation of the lineage and wrote down the instructions. Shangtön’s disciple Khyungpo Tsultrim Gönpo and others become known as the Later Seven Jewels of an amazing lineage. Many lineages came from the seats of Jakchen and Samding, and some spread from Tönpa’s disciple Tashipal. These are all termed “the long lineages.”The direct lineage of Shangpa Kagyu is so called because direct trans-missions of teachings from the ̃›kinı Niguma were received by the great master Tangtong Gyalpo during three separate visionary experiences. Tangtong Gyalpo, “King of a Thousand Plains,” also known as Tsön-dru Zangpo (1361?-1485), was famous for the amazing iron bridges he had built throughout the Himalayan regions as well as his rich legacy of teaching instructions. He had received the hearing lineage known as Upper Rigong from Jangsem Jinpa Zangpo (fourteenth c.) in the long lineage from Muchen Gyaltsen Palzang, a disciple of Shangtön.

First, Niguma appeared in person at Riwoché in Tsang and gave guidance in the six dharmas, mah›mudr›, the three integrations on the path, deathlessness, and guru-protector inseparable. Second, she conferred the individual empowerments at the foot of a juniper tree at demon fort at Lower Dok. Third were the instructions of Khecarı, which occurred by means of unlettered symbols. These transmissions—the early, middle, and later—came through indi-vidual lineages from Mankarwa Lodrö Gyaltsen (fi fteenth c.) and others, and are an unbroken lineage of precepts up to the present time. The very direct lineage originated with the glorious Kunga Drolchok (1507-1566). He received guidance more than a hundred times in twenty-fi ve lineage traditions. These included the direct lineage from a pure vision of the Vajra Queen Nigupta (Niguma) in which she revealed her real face and bestowed the special oral instructions twice, and the long lineages from Jakchen, Samding, Tangtong Gyalpo, and many others. He granted the guidance system over a hundred times and established many fortunate disciples in the stages of attainment. Thus Kunga Drol-chok held the transmissions of the long lineage and the direct lineage, as well as the amazing very direct lineage due to being adopted by the ̃›kinı. The roots of the Shangpa hearing lineage are the pure Golden Dharmas, which are adorned peripherally by incisive oral instructions of the direct lineage possessed of the ̃›kinı’s moist breath. These are found in the Profound Meaning Expanded and other texts by the Lord of Secrets Drolwai Gonpo, better known as T›ran›tha (1575-1635). The exceptionally exalted system refers to the lineage of precepts of Niguma’s Vajra Lines. It possesses three exceptional qualities that make it superior to others: (1) The holders of the lineage were exceptional because they were exclusively bodhisattvas who are at the fi nal stages of existence and the lineage was never interrupted by ordinary individuals. (2) The oral instructions are exceptional because the Vajra Lines that were set down by the ̃›kinı of pristine awareness are unerring in meaning and uncorrupted in letter. They have not been affl icted with the com-positions and alterations derived from the intellectual analyses of ordi-nary people. (3) The blessings are exceptional because even during this end-time of degeneration one can actually observe them ripening into the fruit of attainment in those with diligence and undamaged sacred pledge, such that it is not just the leftovers of exegesis and debate.Six-armed Mah›k›la, known as the Swift Wisdom Protector, is an TOK_8-4_Final.indd 235TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2357/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"236 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeexample of another transmission within the Shangpa tradition. In earlier times the Upper Tradition pervaded almost everywhere. Later, the Lower Tradition of Rigong also expanded greatly, from the seat of Rigong throughout Pakmodru, Kamtsang, and the Four Assemblies traditions. From Samding it spread separately in the southern Chöd lineage, and from Jakpa there were upper, lower, and middle lineages. These were received by the master Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) from Jakchen Jampa Pal (1310-1391), and by Gelekpal from Muchen Namkhai Naljor (fourteenth c.). It spread throughout the three provinces of U, Tsang, and Kham, as far as China and Mongolia. There were other later teaching lineages as well, such as those of Mah›karu ̊ika from Khyergangpa, the secret practice of Hayagrıva, and Nyentön’s yogic exercises for deathlessness. These spread extensively throughout most of the other schools. Jamgön Kongtrul may indeed have saved many of these teachings by incorporating them in his collections and by instituting their practices in his retreat center at Palpung, as well as by adopting them as part of his own path. In doing so, he became a major lineage holder of the Shangpa tradition. One of his successors as lineage holder and as retreat master at Kunzang Dechen Ösal Ling was the master Norbu Tondrup. In turn, Norbu Tondrup’s successor in both positions was the well-known con-temporary master Kalu Rinpoche (1905-1989), whose eff orts in spread-ing these profound teachings in East and West has truly consummated Kongtrul’s work. There is no danger now of this lineage disappearing, as cloistered retreats on many continents continue these practices.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 236TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2367/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Esoteric Instructions of the Shangpa Kagyu....

The Shangpa Kagyu developed from the teaching system of Khyungpo Naljor,1 a king among scholar-adepts. The Shangpas retained incon-ceivable traditions of practice and explanation in sutra and mantra and performed vast enlightened activity in exegesis, study, meditation, and practice.

As it says in the Vajra Lines [on the Six Dharmas of Niguma]: 9Having fi rst been matured by four empowerments, faithful and diligent,Weary of impermanence and defi ciencies,Whoever strives at this supreme pathWill awaken in six months, a year, or in this lifetime.Inner Heat [bb]With fi erce and gentle breathing exercises of inner heat, the root,Consume it as food, wear it as clothing, spread it as a seat, and ride it as a horse.In the six dharmas, which are the root of these Golden Dharmas, the fi rst is the natural blazing of bliss-heat, the defi ning characteristic of the path of method.

By means of the two yogas of one’s own and another’s body as method and wisdom, there arise the four descending dissipating joys and the four ascending nondissipating joys that do not move or change. This stabilizes the coemergent pristine awareness of bliss-emptiness. In this, one fi rst tames the wild channels and wild energy currents by applying the fi erce “wild fi re of inner heat,”11 and then forcefully gener-ating the heat. This is inner heat’s own preliminary practice. Then the main practice, called “eating the food,” is the gentle yoga of the blazing TOK_8-4_Final.indd 240TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2407/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"shangpa kagyu \u0003 241and melting of the “springtime drops”12 in connection with the four-fold vase-breathing. The branches—“wearing the clothing,” “spreading the seat,” and “riding the horse”—are practiced in connection with any activities.13 The concluding practices are taking the empowerment of existence14 and naturally liberating obstructions. Then the fullest benefi t is derived from the inner heat of the guru’s blessing. It is accomplished through these practices.Illusory Body [cc]Devotion, the deity’s form, and the six classes arise as illusion.The defi ning characteristic of illusory body, which is the natural libera-tion of attachment and aversion, is this:15Although appearing, its intrinsic nature is not real;This is the defi ning characteristic of illusion.This is a yoga that liberates attachment and aversion naturally in its own ground through the understanding that all phenomenal sights and sounds are illusory. For its instructions, those of the highest faculties rely on the friendship of a holy guru, those of medium faculties are guided without interruption by other words,16 and those of lesser facul-ties develop meditative absorption on a single seat. The fi rst of these three involves both integrating on the path one’s devotion to the guru and integrating the knowledge that whatever appears is unreal. The sec-ond involves both integrating one’s own body appearing as the empty appearance of the deity’s form and integrating whatever appears as illu-sion. In the third, once free of the four challenges,17 meditating in the absorption with eight vital points causes the six classes of beings to arise as illusion. Then one integrates sickness and negative spirits as illusion and produces the six groups of qualities.18 The natural arisings of illusion without attachment will occur automatically from those.Dream [dd]Through lucid dreaming, four empowerments, and nine unerring vital points,TOK_8-4_Final.indd 241TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2417/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"242 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeDreams are recognized, refi ned, and ascertained; liberating actions are mastered.The defi ning characteristic of dream, which is naturally pure double delusion, is this:Double delusion, lacking validity, arises as bliss.This is the defi ning characteristic of dreams.19All double delusions arise without valid existence, so all the delusions of dreams just dissipate on their own in this special yoga. In these instruc-tions, fi rst one learns to recognize whatever dreams arise based on the vital point of lucid dreaming [or grasping that it is a dream while dream-ing], by practicing the four empowerments of vital essences20 and the nine unerring vital points.21 Then one clears away the obstructions of excessive delusion, excessive wakefulness, excessive euphoria, and exces-sive emptiness through devotion, accumulation of merit, and so on.22Once dreams are lucid at will, one refi nes the mind by means of the body, refi nes the body by means of the mind, [refi nes by means of medi-tation on the goddess] Nair›tmy›, and by purposeful intent. When the skill with dreams is thus energetically refi ned, they are blended with luminous clarity.One trains in increasing and emanating the four elements and sentient beings, large and small, that one encounters and in increasing and ema-nating worldly and transcendent beings for subduing them. One trains in transforming the four elements and sentient beings, large and small, and various deities, which are all transformed into empty appearance free of attachment. Thus one accomplishes the naturally arising deity’s form possessed of three characteristics: bliss without attachment to it, clarity without concept of it, and appearance without intrinsic nature.Appearing objects are ascertained through clear understanding with no reference point, clear seeing of whatever is imagined, and the mental body fl ying through space, which are connected with those of high-est, medium, and lowest faculties, respectively, and through the three instructions on clarifying the appearance of a visualized object.

To bring this into spiritual practice, one sets the foundation by four preliminary practices: (1) [the contemplation of] impermanence and weariness is the root, (2) the conduct and sacramental substances are the branches, (3) the path of method and natural radiance are the leaves, and (4) supplication creates the fl owers.The main practice is to recognize deep and light luminous clarity through three means of grasping it.24 It is integrated on the path night and day by the natural arising of the three k›yas. The training in the blending of inseparable clarity and emptiness, sitting meditation and postmeditation, day and night, and bliss and emptiness causes the sequential development of luminous clarity. The fi rst realization of lumi-nous clarity is the inseparability of clarity and emptiness, second is the inseparability of bliss and emptiness, third is profound tranquility free of elaboration, and fourth is the ultimately inseparable luminous clarity.

Those fi rst four dharmas are known as “blending illusory body”27 or the four root dharmas.Transference [ff ]There is transference of suchness, union, blessing force, and Higher through the path of the unerring celestial realm. The defi ning characteristic of transference, which is buddhahood with-out meditation, is this:Remembering it at the point of death, one is awakened;This is the defi ning characteristic of transference.28This is a yoga that causes one to traverse to the celestial realm by merely remembering it at the point of death. The instructions for it are the transference of suchness of dharmak›ya, the transference of union with the yidam, the force of blessing of the guru, and the transference higher through the path of the unerring celestial realm (Skt. khecara). These are the four doctrines in the source text, Vajra Lines.29 There is also the supplemental instruction on transference, “Skylight of Pristine Awareness.”30Intermediate State [gg]By dharmak›ya, sa ̇bhogak›ya, nirm› ̊ak›ya and the unerring general point,One is liberated in the three intermediate states according to level of faculties.The defi ning characteristic of the intermediate state for attaining the sa ̇bhogak›ya of the victors is this:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 244TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2447/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"shangpa kagyu \u0003 245Appearance-emptiness, free of attachment, the great bliss k›ya,This is the defi ning characteristic of sa ̇bhogak›ya.31This is a yoga for actualizing the great bliss k›ya that is inseparable appearance and emptiness free of attachment.

Of the many ways to guide a fortunate individual, here we are considering the one included in the Five Golden Dharmas that were Vajradhara’s actual instructions to the awareness ̃›kinı Niguma. They are known by the name “amulet box” (ga’u ma) because the scholar-adept Khyungpo Naljor valued them so highly that he put them on a paper scroll inside a Nepalese amulet box like a heart and hung it around his neck.32The preliminaries are to practice the profound method of devotion to the guru and to accomplish faultless calm abiding through the three TOK_8-4_Final.indd 245TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2457/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"246 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgemethods of settling body, speech, and mind in their natural condition while developing higher insight through seeking the mind, and so on.In the main practice, a sly glimpse33 of pristine awareness is introduced by the descent of blessings of the vajra-sealed secret words and one deci-sively determines the nature of mind itself by means of the liberation of the four faults in their own ground. The four faults are (1) although one’s own mind and the dharmak›ya are beyond unity and separation, it is too close to recognize; (2) although it arises in oneself, it is too profound to grasp; (3) although just recalling it suffi ces, it is too easy to believe; and (4) although the three k›yas arise in oneself, it is too good to accept. These are the four faults from which one is liberated. The concluding practice is the conviction that the ordinary mind that was from the beginning the unity of clarity and emptiness is itself the naturally arising three k›yas—its emptiness is dharmak›ya, its clarity is nirm› ̊ak›ya, and the union of those is sa ̇bhogak›ya. Once such cer-tainty has been born, one maintains within the settled state of just that. The enhancement practices are to rely on immeasurable devotion, immeasurable compassion, and the special methods of blending the energy currents with ordinary consciousness, with the luminous clar-ity of the deity’s body, and with unity consciousness. The uncommon clearing away of obstructions is to make an eff ort not to get caught up in one’s experiences and not to lean toward either appearance or empti-ness. In this way, one ascertains the three measures of natural arising34 and actualizes the natural liberation of the four k›yas.This is amulet box mah›mudr› or the so-called “three naturally settled states” (rang babs rnam gsum). It is the trunk of the excellent wish-fulfi ll-ing tree of the Five Golden Dharmas.Th e Th ree Integrations on the Path [iii]Whatever appears is the guru, appearance and sound are deity and mantra,Appearance is mind, illusion, and dream.

(3) Understanding appearance as mind and mind as illusion and dream, one trains in the yogas of day and night.35The ways to practice are to exert eff ort in devotion based on the three convictions and on the union [of appearance and emptiness];36 pure per-ception based on having the six constant vital points;37 and the medita-tive absorption in clarity-emptiness free of fi xation on the validity of the doors of perception. If done like this, devotion arises based on the guru, from that comes [appreciation of his or her] kindness, from that the accumulation of merit, and from that the three k›yas arise naturally. Pure perception based on the yidam leads to the accumulation of merit, and from that the mah›mudr› of the deity’s form arises naturally. [Realizing] appearance as one’s own mind produces [the realization] of illusion, from that dream, and from that luminous clarity occurs as a natural arising. Through these three practices, the natural arising of clarity, emptiness, and great bliss as the three k›yas will be actualized in a matter of months or years.

In The Ocean of Pristine Awareness Tan-tra41 it says:This body and mind are indivisible,Mutually dependent as support and supported.This should be known as the vital point of all.This means that one fi rst thoroughly refi nes the channels, vital essences, and energy currents with the thirty-two yogic exercises for accomplish-ing deathlessness. Once those are done, the body must be apprehended as being on the path of liberation. The master VirÒpa said:Through a great share of meritOne certainly obtains a human body.From the blessing of the guru’s speechIt goes forth on the path of liberation.The main body of the practice is described by the reverend lord Mokchokpa:42Sutras, tantras, esoteric instructions, and experiences teachThe vital point of deathlessness, awakening without meditating:How this body of karma fully ripeningArises as a naturally pure awareness body.Visualize the fully ripening karmic body as the deity’s formTOK_8-4_Final.indd 248TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2487/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"shangpa kagyu \u0003 249And meditate without fi xation on it.It is itself inseparable from mind.No essence of mind is established,So where is something that dies?“Death” is just a concept.The hosts of concepts are nonexistent phenomena of samsara and nirvana.According to this and other statements, since one’s own mind in essence has no real existence whatsoever, it was always unborn. Therefore the great natural liberation of deathlessness is attained. As for this body of fully ripening karma, since it is a conglomeration of inert matter, it is not a basis on which to attribute the designations of birth or death. In fact, the body even arises as a mere appearance of mind. When one gains con-fi dence in the realization that the mind is unborn and undying, then the body appears as the deity’s form in mah›mudr› and one becomes bound to basic space without erring into the path of deluded appearance. By this kind of instruction one discovers the k›ya of union in this lifetime. Even just hearing it can cause one to get enlightened in the intermediate state as the sa ̇bhogak›ya of the victors.

Currently, the individual vajra lines for Niguma’s Six Dharmas, mah›mudr›, integration on the path, unerring, and deathlessness are extant. The fi rst two and the last of these are the transmitted word of Vajradhara. The remaining two exist as vajra line treatises spoken in the fi rst case by Niguma, and in the latter case by VirÒpa.49 This has occurred in other lineages as well. For example, the vajra lines of the Cakrasa ̇vara Hearing Lineage are the transmitted word of the Buddha, whereas the Vajra Lines of the Path with Its Result and the Vajra Lines of Non-Elaboration and others appear to be treatises.50 In this system of instructions, even the supplications and numbering of the verses for visualization were established by the awareness ̃›kinı herself in the Testimonial, so it is free of the suppositions, fabrications, and alterations of later individuals. Thus it is most exceptional and exalted. In general, the long tradition of the Shangpa Kagyu was divided into three: the extensive, abbreviated, and very abbreviated paths.

As is said:If you do not recognize the three bodies through the instructionsYou simply follow after delusion.Fully ripening, habit, and mental bodiesAre the victor’s k›yas if grasped through vital points.Until samsara is emptied,The uninterrupted welfare of beings continues. The three bodies are the fully ripening karmic body, the habit body, and the mental body. An exposition of them is found in the scholar-adept Khyungpo Naljor’s Instructions for Unerring Three Intermediate States.51 There, the yogin’s bases of refi nement are the three intermediate states. The refi ning agents are creation and completion, dream, and luminous clarity. As it states in the Display of Pristine Awareness Tantra: 52 Those three bodies in the intermediate statesAre refi ned by creation and completion, dream, and luminous clarity.And in Hevajra: 53Just as illusion and dream,Just as the intermediate states...The three intermediate states that are the bases for refi nement are the intermediate state between birth and death, the intermediate state of dream, and the intermediate state of existence. The intermediate state between birth and death lasts from the time of being born until dying, during which one has a fully ripening karmic body. Why is it called fully ripening? The virtue and nonvirtue that one has accumulated ripens as TOK_8-4_Final.indd 251TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2517/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"252 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgevarious kinds of pleasure and pain that one experiences, so it is called the body of fully ripening karma. The second, dream intermediate state, lasts from the time that one falls asleep until one wakes up, and is the habit body. Why is it called the habit body? The various habitual pat-terns of this life come up in one’s dreams, so it is the dream body of habitual patterns. The third is the intermediate state of existence that lasts from death until one takes another birth, and it is the mental body. Why is it called the mental body? While consuming odors as its food, the mind, like a phantom, has full powers and is unobstructed by material-ity, so it is a mental body.Secondly, that which refi nes them: The mah›mudr› of the deity’s form refi nes the fully ripening body; the emanation, transformation, and so on, of dreams refi nes the habit body; and luminous clarity refi nes the mental body. Alternatively, each of those bodies has body, speech, and mind as the bases of refi nement and they are refi ned by the three experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonthought. The result obtained is the inseparable three k›yas. This way, those of highest faculties are enlightened in the fully ripening body, those of medium faculties are enlightened in the habit body, and those of the lowest faculties are enlightened in the interme-diate state due to the practice that was done during the fully ripening and habit bodies that acted as a seed.54 This was all taught clearly by the scholar-adept Khyungpo, Nyentön, and others. Thus, if one masters the fully ripening body through the methods in the instructions, then the habit body and, by that, the mental body will be mastered in turn. Therefore, fi rst of all one should practice with this fully ripening body, which is the nature of channels, energy currents, and vital essences. Then one practices the esoteric instructions with method based on one’s own body, the yoga of the blazing and dripping of a and ha ̇, and the yoga of wisdom based on another’s body, joining with khagamukha.55 Refi ning and controlling the bodhicitta, it will travel from the tip of the “jewel” to the crown of the head by means of the four dissipating ascending joys and the four nondissipating descending joys. When the body is completely fi lled it becomes the rainbow body or vajrak›ya. The speech becomes the harmonious song of the invincible n›da, and the mind without concept is the dharmak›ya. Since this is actual, complete enlightenment, it was given the designation “highest faculties enlightened in the fully ripening body.”TOK_8-4_Final.indd 252TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2527/10/09 1:59:06 PM7/10/09 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"shangpa kagyu \u0003 253Those of medium faculties practice illusory body through recollection and purposeful intent during the daytime, and the recognizing, refi ning, increasing, and transforming of dreams at nighttime, by which the natu-ral purity of this double delusion is refi ned. Therefore this is given the designation “medium faculties enlightened in the habit body.”Those of lowest faculties practice during the fully ripening and habit bodies together. When this acts as a seed, those of highest, medium, and lowest [subdivisions within the lowest faculties] will be enlight-ened during one of the sequence of three intermediate states [of death]. This is given the designation “lowest faculties enlightened in the mental body.” [Th e Very Abbreviated Path] [cc]As is said:The three bodies are the three k›yas of the victor,One’s mind is undying and naturally liberated.How wonderful!

Despite the existence of textual sources for both the history of the lineage and its practices, there do not seem to be actual practitioners at this point. Its subsidiary, Chöd (gcod) or Severance, on the other hand, is practiced far and wide in all sects, although not itself a sect. Severance is consid-ered a branch of Pacifi cation because it also traces some of its precepts to Dampa Sangyé. It is most famous as the lineage begun by the great Tibetan yoginı Machik Lapdrön (1055-1153), and for supposedly being the only Tibetan lineage that spread back into India. Dampa Sangyé, however, also had an enormous infl uence in Tibet. Kongtrul, like others before him, associates him with the Indian master KamalaŸıla.* KamalaŸıla is reported to have attended fi fty-four male and female adepts. He mastered the eight common spiritual powers, such as subsist-ing on refi ned essences, and so he is said to have lived for fi ve hundred and seventy years. He encountered buddhas face-to-face as numerous as the stars in the sky, such as the twelve sugatas and thirty-six gurus of the heavenly realms, and attained the supreme spiritual power. Known throughout Tibet and China by the name Pa Dampa Sangyé, he came to Tibet fi ve times. On all those occasions he would intuit the exact character and faculties of each individual and liberate him or her through a few appropriate instructions. Thus there is no single primary source or systematic tradition that one could ascribe to all of these meth-ods. Nevertheless, according to Kongtrul, the main source texts of Paci-fi cation include the Ali Kali Great River Tantra and Mah›mudr› Symbol *Synopsis based on The Treasury of Knowledge, Book 4, Part 3 (TOK 1: 538-548).

Consistent with Dampa’s own life example, his main methods were the three levels of vows as the support, ascetic exertion as the path, and activities for the welfare of others as the fruition. The name applied posthumously to those teachings is the Holy Dharma Pacifi cation of Suff ering. It is said that other teachings fi rst refi ne away the cause of suff ering—affl ictive emotions—thus averting suff ering as a consequence. In this system, the result—suff ering—is confronted directly and affl ictive emotions are dispelled as a natural consequence of that. For this reason it is considered an extraordinarily profound method. It is believed that the appellation is based upon the phrase from the Heart Sutra, “the mantra that totally pacifi es all suff ering.”Machik Lapdrön is the undisputed progenitor of the Severance lineage, combining at least three sources of her unique system: the Severance precepts from firyadeva the Br›hmin, Maitreya, and other Indian mas-ters through Dampa Sangyé; her own realizations of the teachings in the wisdom literature (prajñ›p›ramit›); and direct revelations from the bodhisattva T›r›. The system called Sacred Dharma Severance of Evil Object (dam chos bdud kyi gcod yul ) is essentially the sutra teachings on the perfection of wisdom that are consistent with the approach of vajray›na. In this teaching system, the four devils that bind one in cyclic existence are the material devil (thogs bcas), the immaterial devil (thogs med), the devil of exaltation (dga’ spros), and the devil of infl ation (snyems byed kyi bdud). But it is the last one, the conceptual mental infl ation of self-fi xation, which must ultimately be severed. Just as one must identify the objects in the landscape in order to cut down trees, the devil of infl ated concepts is the object of severance in the perfection of wisdom. After Dampa Sangyé came to Tibet, he saw a ̃›kinı apparition of four ravens swooping towards him. Those turned out to be the four ̃›kinıs: Lapdrön of Yé, Majo Jangchub of Nyaltö, Zhangmo Gyalting of Tsang, and Nyonma of Lhasa. Machik Lapdrön experienced the view of empti-ness when she was reciting the Perfection of Wisdom sutras. She was a yoginı by nature and her mindstream was liberated by a single word of heart advice spoken from Dampa. The famous Severance Object is the realized dharma born from the experience and intention of Machik herself, based on the intended meaning of the perfection of wisdom.

There were an unimaginable number of instructions that she propagated, and some of them have continued to exist up until the present time. There are many classifi cation systems, but more inspiring are the six examples with which Kongtrul illustrates the greatness of Severance in his short history: (1) This Severance is like White Snow Mountain Kailash: whether snow falls upon the snow mountain or does not fall it is still white. In the same way, whether a Severance yogin has developed the intelligence of studying or has not done very well, it is fi ne. (2) It is like the lion, which is overwhelming in a group and also fearless when alone. Just so, it is fi ne to do Severance accompa-nied by many and fi ne to do it wandering around alone.(3) It is like the sound of a great drum: it is fi ne when accom-panied by the sound of other instruments and when it is not; just so, it makes no diff erence in this practice whether one has other friends practicing virtue or not.(4) It is like the spring of spiritual powers: the waters of spiri-tual attainment are equal to however many people drink from them. Just so, in this tradition there is training that is appropri-ate to the intellectual level of the individual. (5) It is like chunks of broken gold or turquoise: if they are big then their value is great, but if they are small then the value is commensurate. Just so, if one knows the vast cycle of Sever-ance there are immeasurable benefi ts, but if one knows a small amount it still benefi ts oneself and others.(6) It is like the hair of a fi ne horse: it does not matter what color the hair is on a well-formed superior horse with an excellent gait. Just so, it does not matter if an individual who consummates the practice of Severance Object is superior or inferior, they have more blessings than anyone else. Machik Lapdrön and her spiritual descendents leave an unusually exten-sive legacy of teachings and transmissions, which only seem to increase with time.

It states in a sutra:TOK_8-4_Final.indd 260TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2607/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"zhijé and chöd \u0003 261Dharma that pacifi es the suff ering and misery of beings with many dispositions.And from a Dh›ra ̊ı: 4The noble son or daughter who desires the pacifi cation of outer, inner, and secret suff ering ...And from a King Tantra: 5Pacifying the suff ering of the three suff erings,Removing three, limitless beings obtain three freedoms,Are defi nitely liberated from all obscurations,And dwell in space-like equalness. Based on such teachings, Dampa Sangyé initially set forth the Three Lamps of Pacifi cation.6 The Lamp of Conduct7 contains the meaning of the Vinaya, the collection on discipline. It principally teaches the training in higher ethical conduct, physical actions, and the semantic meaning of the thirty consonants. The Lamp of the Path8 contains the meaning of the Abhidharma, the collection on phenomenology. It prin-cipally teaches the training in higher wisdom, verbal utterances, and the semantic meaning of the sixteen vowels. The Lamp of Mind9 contains the meaning of the Sutras, the collection of discourses.10 It principally teaches the training in higher meditative absorption, mental images, and the semantic meaning of the fi fty-fi ve sounds: the fi fty consonants and vowels, the four neutral letters, and the a within them all. These are also subsumed under practices for inferior, medium, and superior faculties. Since this was seemingly the fi rst of all the spoken mysteries of Dampa Sangyé, all of the instructions promulgated in Tibet from then on also came to be known by the name “Pacifi cation.”There are limitless methods for actual realization connected with the vital points of practice and instruction in the individual lineages of this profound dharma. They could, however, be arranged according to gen-eral ground, path, and fruition. It says in the Lamp of the Yogic Path: 11Myself and all living beingsAre primordially unborn luminous clarity,TOK_8-4_Final.indd 261TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2617/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"262 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeBut confused by the winds of ignoranceWe experience the suff ering of cyclic existence.Where do the three suff erings come from? They come from karmic actions and affl ictive emotions. These depend on the mind or energy current of coemergent ignorance.12 That itself, having primordially passed into peace in the great unborn luminous clarity, is the ground for refi ning away the defi lements. The three poisons that are the root of the three suff erings13 are removed in the best cases through realization, in moderate cases through meditational experience, and in inferior cases through devoted supplication. Thus limitless beings obtain the three kinds of total liberation of Ÿr›vakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, or the actualization of the three k›yas of the victorious ones. This unerr-ing method is the path that refi nes. Having been released from all bonds of emotional and conceptual obscurations, dwelling in the equalness of the space-like ultimate realm of reality is the fruition of refi ning.

In this case, the name was designated based on such passages as “the mantra that utterly pacifi es all suff ering,”15 which were taught in order to immediately pacify suff ering such as having an inferior or sickly body due to previous karma. From the Lamp of Conduct: 16To beings tormented by suff ering,Explain immaculate, comforting pacifi cation.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 262TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2627/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"zhijé and chöd \u0003 263In general, all of the sacred dharma is the same in pacifying suff ering.

In essence, it is called “the perfection vehicle that is consistent with the mantra vehicle.” It is the special instruction that combines all the sutras and tantras into a single vital point.Th e Th ree Transmissions [c]This has three parts: the instructions of the fi rst transmission, the mid-dle, and the later lineages.

By shooting like an arrow, falling like a thunderbolt, spinning like a wheel, and settling like a butter lamp, the ten qualities such as “seeing the root”18 are brought to perfection. When the most excellent pristine awareness arises, the four k›yas and fi ve pristine awarenesses will be spontaneously present.The general subsequent practice to all of these is to integrate the inter-mediate states as the path. Appearances are the intermediate state of illusion, and by practicing accordingly, the signs will arise in the inter-mediate state of habitual dreaming. Once that arises, one develops skill in the painful intermediate state of dying. When that develops, libera-tion from the deluded intermediate state of existence is certain.The manner of liberation is this: The obscuration of affl ictive emotion is purifi ed by the experience of meditative equipoise in something, and the confused clinging to reality is expended. Through that vital point, the three realms are transcended. The obscuration of knowledge is puri-fi ed by the experience of post-meditation and one is no longer confused by mere appearances.

In the fi rst, one comes to the recognition of the pristine awareness of one’s own aware-ness through four endeavors that integrate characteristics, lack of charac-teristics, utter lack of characteristics, and the breakthrough to space. One enters directly into meditative absorption by four kinds of meditative sessions: long, short, partial, and continuous. Meditation is enhanced by four vital energy exercises and four thought severances. Mah›mudr› is recognized through the two placements. Nonmeditation is ascertained by two breakthrough experiences. In the second, knowing [four things] integrate the mind on the path: the viewed object, the viewing method, the measure of seeing, and the benefi ts. The manner of existence, of being, of appearing, and of being empty20 set the foundation of a sending session.21 Four miscellaneous points capture the juncture of meaning: knowledge without foundation, essence without support, experience without change, and the natural liberation of characteristics.

In the So system23 the main instruction concerns seeing awareness nakedly, along with the three vital points. It says in the Symbol Tantra: 24The sevenfold posture causes energy-mind to enter the abode.The vital point of the body is to establish practice through training with the physical postures and gazes. The vital point of energy currents is to fi ll up by settling in fresh exhalation, inhalation, and abiding of the breath. The vital point of the mind is to settle by pressing and placing through great all-pervasiveness in superior cases, the encounter of nakedly see-ing in moderate cases, and various methods of pressing in inferior cases. There are also three methods of introducing them: those of superior faculties are introduced to pristine awareness in a forceful way, those of moderate faculties are introduced by examples and words, and those of inferior faculties are introduced by relying on persuasive words.Obstructions of dullness and agitation are cleared away by check-ing the success of reversing the spills, leaks, and overfl ows. Practice is enhanced with the realization of the unity during meditation and post-meditation of essence, nature, and characteristics. It is taught that one should practice with these ten clinchers of prac-tice:25 the clincher of the key instruction of certainty in changeless view; the clincher of the key instruction of fast, straightforward meditation; the clincher of actual fruition of ultimate stability; the clincher of the equal fl avor of surprise circumstances;26 the clincher of being like a skill-ful doctor realizing success; the clincher like a wheel weapon cutting through good and bad thoughts; the clincher like arriving at the golden land of ultimate experiential realization; the clincher like a precious jewel that fulfi lls desires and needs; and the clincher of the intermediate state practice of bliss-warmth at the point of death.

The last is divided into two: the forceful severing of discursive thoughts in medi-tative equipoise, and the post-meditation practice of taking discursive thoughts as reality. A great many such guidance systems arose, but later only these guidances of the Kam system continued to exist.Th e Last Transmission [iii]This has two parts: a general presentation of the cycle of practice, and a specifi c explanation of the red guidance.Th e Cycle of Practice [aa]Principally, in the last, the system of the bodhisattva Kunga,There are white, red, and black guidances...The principal or root teaching of Pacifi cation is the last transmission, which is from the instructions to the four-direction yogins, and is the system of the guru bodhisattva Kunga.28 This teaching consists of instructions on the perfection of wisdom that are consistent with the secret mantra. The root is conferred to the mindstream, the essential meaning is introduced, and one is adorned with methods of numerous, great interdependent connections. Then one practices all the Buddhist teachings at one time on one seat. This key instruction is called the Practice Cycle of the Immaculate Drop.29 In the Great Gradual Path of Zhikpo Nyima Sengé30 it says:This is a mah›mudr› teaching presenting the three immaculates;This key instruction presenting three practices called “drop”Is a wonderful presentation of three guidance systems of the three teaching cycles.Initially, this consists of a preliminary empowerment which ripens the support that was not ripened before.

The word empowerment that ripens the affl ictive mind (yid) is the lineage suffi cient to meet in that it is the vital point of resolving by antidotes and traversing the paths and stages by relying on the four vital points of the seed-syllables.On the path, the white guidance concentrates solely on mind train-ing, the red guidance concerns the practice of the fi ve or three paths, and the black guidance brings about the realization of the types of letters. All of them produce results by way of exertion.Furthermore, those of superior faculties behold the actual unadulter-ated abiding nature of the native mind beyond duality, causing instanta-neous enlightenment. This is the vital point of nakedly seeing awareness in the white guidance. Those of medium faculties refi ne the vital essence of the three gates equally, and by consummating the path of the guru’s four k›yas, attain the four k›yas in crossing over (thod rgal ). This is the vital point of the sole suffi ciency of devotion in the red guidance. Those of inferior faculties attain the fi ve paths by engaging gradually. This is the vital point of the instruction on subtle cutting through (phra chod) in the black guidance.To make the guru’s blessing the path, initially when the guru is sup-plicated as dharmak›ya, unrestricted realization arises. In the middle, when the guru is supplicated as sa ̇bhogak›ya, unrestricted qualities arise. Finally, when the guru is supplicated as nirm› ̊ak›ya, unrestricted benefi t for beings occurs. Afterwards, when the guru is supplicated as the mah›sukhak›ya, unfl uctuating buddha activity occurs.There are also four word collections: the sutras and tantras with their practices, the transmissions with the hearing lineage, the immaculate with the subtle vital essence; and the minute examinations with the col-lection of explanations. These are all common sections of teaching.Th e Red Guidance [bb]This has three parts: explanations of the preliminaries, the main practice, and additional subsidiary methods.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 270TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2707/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"zhijé and chöd \u0003 271Th e Preliminaries [1'] ... in the cycle engendering experience.In the red guidance, the general preliminary severs attachment.The special accomplishes the path’s foundation, accumulates, and purifi es.In general, the direct guidance that was made from those explanations is the red guidance on the practice of yoga of fi ve paths that is from the cycle of engendering spiritual experience.

In the main practice, the manner of uttering sounds is integrating the letters on the path.38 The special visualization of the four empower-ments is the meditation sequence on the four chakras. The special basic introduction is the practice in both meditative equipoise and post-medi-tation. And the special permission blessing transmission is the four ways of invoking the guru’s realization that perfects the levels and paths in one stroke. In the subsequent activity, while guarding against the four stains of reversing the spills, leaks, and overfl ows, the retreats are set by the four indicators of essence, signs, qualities, and amount.The fi ve paths also need to be produced by way of exertion. Three examples are that cutting through misconceptions while depending on a master is like a Ÿr›vaka, practicing and accomplishing by oneself is like a pratyekabuddha, and heroically accomplishing the welfare of others is like a bodhisattva. The three types are monastic, layperson, and mendi-cant. The three times are long, short, and medium. The three systems of conferring empowerment are single, turned, and parallel in conjunction. These twelve divisions are crucial to avoid spills and leaks in the practice. The Gradual Path states:In all the esoteric instructions, training in time, support, and sys-tem of practice,The guru recognizes the object and sets up whatever connections are auspicious.Carrying an unbearable load is the source of sickness, the holy ones teach.This path did not occur previously in India and Tibet, but is the special teaching of Dampa Rinpoché.

The essence of one’s own mind is by nature totally pure. Taking that itself as the directive on the path, and with the guru’s blessing as a preliminary, the incidental defi lements are purifi ed and ultimately the pristine awareness of intrinsic awareness is liberated within basic space. This is dharmak›ya. In addi-tion to that, its nature is the root of clarity, which is limitless perfection. By obtaining control of awareness, the pure k›ya adorned with the marks and characteristics manifests to the perception of those to be tamed. This is sa ̇bhogak›ya. In addition, the defi ning characteristic of mind is inseparable appearance and emptiness. From within that, the deeds of skillful methods appear in whichever way appropriate to whomever is to be tamed. This is nirm› ̊ak›ya. The inseparability of those three is the mah›sukhak›ya.

The birth of qualities comes through the lineage.Additional Subsidiary Methods [3']Clearing obstructions, enhancement practice, and the crucial approach to accomplishment.One to one, one three, and one to one.For the yogin who practices in this way, clearing away obstructions occurs by clearing away the obstructions of imbalance in the four ele-ments, eliminating proliferation through methods and wisdom, and clearing away the four stains on each path. Realization is enhanced by invoking the guru with devotion and the ̃›kinıs’ secret words on the four vital points of expertise. The “one to one” crucial approach to the way of accomplishment is to attend and please the guru, since dur-ing mind training one cannot be on one’s own. “One three” means that by completing mind training, three things are accumulated, three causes abandoned, and the three blessings received. Having fi rst done the three yogas, one engages in the three practices of austerities, sub-sequent activities, and equal fl avor. Until the fi nal success on the path, this is the pinnacle of the stages of accomplishment. “One to one” again means that one has reached the ultimate accomplishment of heroic self- confi dence40 and engages solely in altruistic activity.

The meaning of “severance” (gcod) is explained by Br›hmin firyadeva in the short source text:41To sever the root of mind itself, And sever the roots of fi ve toxic emotionsAnd sever extreme views, disturbed meditation, And hopes and fears about results in activity—To sever all infl ation—That is the defi nition of “Severance.”The term “object” (yul ) is explained in the Abhidharma Treasury: 42From unforsaken latent tendenciesAnd direct contact with objectsAnd improper concepts Affl ictive emotions arise...That which is to be severed is affl ictive emotion. When affl ictive emo-tions originate from latent tendencies and external objects and improper concepts, the yogin directly engages the object, which conjures up habit-ual patterns. The affl ictive emotions that were preceded by improper concepts are then severed right there directly upon the object. Hence it is called “severance object” [or “the object to be severed”] (gcod yul).Alternatively, it is widely held to mean “activity object” (spyod yul)43 because it puts into practice the meaning of the phrase [found in the Per-fection of Wisdom sutras], “In this way one should train in performing TOK_8-4_Final.indd 276TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2767/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"zhijé and chöd \u0003 277the activity of the profound perfection of wisdom.” Also, in the Heart Essence of Profound Meaning: 44Mahayana dharma overwhelming the four devils,Neither inhibiting nor indulging samsara and nirvana, the gist of the perfections,Making negative conditions the path; the approach of the Lord Mother45Who taught the severance instructions to those who wish to befriend adversity.Thus when it bears the name through being analogous to what is described in the highest yoga tantras of secret mantra, such as Cakrasa ̇vara, Hevajra, and so on, it is the sequence of activity that enhances the path by means of instructions in the vital points of method and wisdom, such as the “secret activity,” “awareness activity,” “public activity,” “victorious in all directions,” and so on.46 When it bears the name through dissimi-larity, in terms of being a remedy, it refers to instructions in the causal vehicle of the perfections. In order to integrate on the path the truths of causal origination and resultant suff ering from the reversed application of what to practice or abandon of the four truths,47 the instructions on practicing the profound vital points of the remedial reverse meditation and equal taste are given. This is called “severance of evil object” (bdud kyi gcod yul). From The Collection: 48In fact ultimately there is nothing to sever.To conquer cowardice, severance is explained.In these instructions, the Guru’s Secret Severance, the Meaning Precept Lineage Severance, Dampa’s Pacifi cation, and N›ro’s Secret Conduct are known as the four basic sources of Indian teachings that fl ourished in Tibet.49 Of these, the lineage descending from Dampa produced “male” and “female” severance,50 of which the female severance has the further designation of being principally from Machik herself.51 Machik realized nonorigination instantly by merely seeing the extensive and intermediate [texts on the perfection of wisdom] of the middle turning of the wheel of dharma, and the instructions of severing egotistical delusion were born in her heart.

Famous even now, this unbroken tradition of ripening and liberating instructions has the sutras on the perfection of wisdom (prajñ›p›ramit›) as the scriptural source of its view and the various methods which dis-tinguish the mantra vehicle. Therefore it is accepted as the combination of sutric and tantric realization. In the Collected Verses [of the Perfection of Wisdom],52 the meaning of this doctrine is presented as four reasons to practice:Through four reasons a wise and strong bodhisattvaWill be unmoved by four devils that are diffi cult to resist:Abiding in emptiness, never forsaking sentient beings,Acting according to one’s word, and possessing the sugatas’ blessing.These four—the view that abides in emptiness, the compassion that never abandons sentient beings, the bodhisattva’s discipline of acting according to one’s word, and the sugatas’ blessings—are the root of practice. Of these, the practice of receiving the blessings of the sugatas is going for refuge and supplication to the guru and lineage. From the short source text:53Off er to the guru and the Jewels Vast off erings of real and unreal mental appearances,Prostrate and confess negative actions,Then respectfully go for refuge and arouse awakening mind.Acting according to one’s word is not senseless bragging but adhering to the promises and abstentions sworn after having given rise to awakening mind.

Machik said:Give generously with an awakening mind.Since everything is the naturally occurring mind,Be without partiality towards apparently existent phenomena.Rest in great expansive nonself.The view of abiding in emptiness is fi rst of all to stop regarding the aggre-gates that compose one’s own being as the self and then to not conceptu-alize about the existence and characteristics of others as objects.

According to the great source text61 there are one hundred empowerments of the transforming lama, one hundred empowerments of the transforming buddha, and one hundred empowerments of the transforming ̃›kinı.

Machik’s Severance Object consists of many systems, such as the sutra tradition, the combination of the realization of sutra and tantra, the pure vision of the later severance revealed treasures (gter ma), and so on. Since the root practice of them all is related to the four main points mentioned before, we could summarize as follows: In the exceptional preliminary practice, gathering the accumulations internally through the body, the devotional supplications bring down the vital blessings. In the main practice, by focusing exclusively on awareness, one searches for the faults within the mind. When this is straightened up, the methods of settling are presented. Based on “Opening the Door to the Sky,”63 the meaning of the Mother is introduced: the guidance on meaning reveals it, the guidance on words establishes the meditation, and the guidance on experience cultivates the meditation. These methods are also taught in the Great Collection of Precepts: 64Placing your body however it is comfortable,Thinking has no object; you won’t fi nd it.Better to rest within nonthought.And:65Since everything is naturally occurring mind,A meditator does not meditate.Whatever arises, however it arises, all feelings of arising—Let them rest: clear, steady, and relaxed.As for the general manner of introduction, there are countless meth-ods, such as the introduction to the sixteen kinds of emptiness from the TOK_8-4_Final.indd 282TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2827/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"zhijé and chöd \u0003 283instructions of seeing the face of the Great Mother, the introduction to the six perfections from the revealed treasures of the female severance tradition, and also the introduction of appearance as mind, mind as emptiness, emptiness as coemergence, and coemergence as dharmak›ya.

To forcefully enhance the production of experience and realization, one should go by the four modes of travel to a haunted place with the right characteristics and actively engage the path of delib-erate conduct.

This is enhanced by concentrating on the outer gods and demons and the inner ego-fi xation as the extreme of nonself. Through this, initially ego-fi xation and discursive thinking will rise up as the very embodiment of emptiness, as mentioned before.

The two who appeared later were Vanaratna (1384-1468) and Buddhaguptan›tha (ca. 1530-1610).More specifi cally, seventeen lineages of the Six-Branch Yoga are iden-tifi ed: (1) the esoteric instructions on the Six-Branch Yoga of the great translator Gyijo Dawai Özer along with the lesser tantra and commen-tary specifi cally on the Six-Branch Yoga; (2) the Six-Branch Yoga in the tradition of the translator Ma Gewai Lodrö; (3) the Six-Branch Yoga of the translator of Trom, Padma Özer; (4) the Six-Branch Yoga that the glorious Lord AtıŸa received from K ̧ ̋ ̊›bhijñ›; (5) the Six-Branch Yoga known as the Dro Tradition [of Dro Sherab Drak], which was the Six-Branch Yoga of the lineage descending from the great Kash-miri pa ̊ ̃ita Soman›tha; (6) the Six-Branch Yoga that the translator Ra Chörab received from the pa ̊ ̃ita SamantaŸrı; (7) the Tsami Tradition itself, which is the tradition of the Yogam›l› composed by the transla-tor Tsami Sangyé Drak, transmitted through Selo [Zhönnu Tsultrim] and Nyötön Öpa; (8) the Six-Branch Yoga that Rechung Dorjé Drakpa (1083-1161) received from Amoghavajra. Three lineages came through the glorious Galo that are in the lineage of Tsami but were not the same as the Yogam›l› tradition. They are (9) the Six-Branch Yoga of the K›lacakra’s own tradition that Galo gave to Zhang Tsalpa and others, (10) the Six-Branch Yoga of the mother tantra Hevajra that Galo gave to the great Sakyapa Lama, and (11) the Six-Branch Yoga of the father tantra Guhyasam›ja that Galo gave to Geshé Kyura Akyab. Even though Galo received these all from Tsami, the methods of instruction in the Yogam›l› and Galo traditions are quite diff erent and so are counted separately. (12) The great Kasmiri pa ̊ ̃ita ⁄›kyaŸrı gave the translator Chal Chökyi Zangpo the Six-Branch Yoga using esoteric instructions of N›ropa’s great commentary on the Hevajra Tantra. (13) The great ⁄›kyaŸrı also gave it to the dharma lord Sakya Pa ̊chen, making it spe-cial with the Six Vajra Verses of the hearing lineage. (14) The pa ̊ ̃ita VibhÒticandra received the Six-Branch Yoga in the tradition of the adept Anupamarak ̋ita from the master Ratnarak ̋ita. This is known as the long lineage of VibhÒti.

Although at fi rst he meditated on the esoteric instructions of both the Ra and Dro traditions, mainly the latter, later on he attained mastery without depending on any other lineage. In any case, he formu-lated the Six-Branch Yoga of the Litany of Names (N›masa ̇gıt›).These seventeen lineages were all received by the great Kunpang Tukjé Tsöndru (1243-1313), an emanation of the kalkins. In this tradition those currents are brought together into one, but since he also received the traditions of four actual disciples of the direct transmission of VibhÒti, they may be counted as twenty traditions. There were many other lin-eages as well.Later, when the great East Indian scholar Vanaratna traveled to Tibet, he gave Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu Pal (1392-1481), Chen-nga Chökyi Drakpa (1453-1524), and others the complete oral instructions of the tradition of the great adept Anupamarak ̋ita, together with the direct transmission of the hermit lord ⁄avari. Even later, ⁄›ntigupta’s disciple Buddhaguptan›tha gave the exceptional oral transmission of ⁄›ntigupta’s Six-Branch Yoga to his disciple T›ran›tha, the great Jetsun of Jonang. Kongtrul distinguishes one special tradition that was spread by two great masters: the fi rst was the great omniscient Dharma master Sherab Gyaltsen Pal Zangpo, known as Dolpopa (1292-1361), who was held to be an emanation of the kalkin Pu ̊ ̃arıka and had been prophesied in the scriptures. The second was Jetsun Drolwai Gönpo, or T›ran›tha (1575-1635), who deliberately took birth at the end of the age of strife, and who had reached the level of a second Vajradhara in regard to pro-found secret topics. Those two who distinguish the path tradition of this chariot represent a precept tradition (bka’ brgyud) of second kalkins that is more marvelous than the others. It is the great transmitted precepts of this practice lineage that are presented here.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 291TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2917/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"TOK_8-4_Final.indd 292TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2927/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The Esoteric Instructions of Jordruk, “The Six-Branch Yoga”....

Experiences and Signs....Jordruk, “The Six-Branch Yoga” [G]The explanation of the meditation sequence of the Six-Branch Yoga (sbyor drug, Skt. ̋a ̃aºgayoga) has fi ve parts: (1) a statement about its greatness in regard to the source, (2) an overview summarizing the points of approach and attainment, (3) an extensive explanation of the meaning of each branch of the Vajrayoga, (4) a presentation of other supplemen-tary branch yogas, and (5) a brief discussion of the connection between cause and result and the experiences and signs of the result.Th e Greatness of the Source [1]Six branches are plainly presented in the extensive root tantras,The vajrayoga that is the fi nal destination of completion phase.The hidden meaning in the vajra words of so many other king con-densed tantras is presented clearly without concealment in the Glorious K›lacakra Tantra. This is the sublime meaning that is plainly presented with one intention and one voice in all of the extensive root tantras, such as the Supreme Original Buddha.1 It is called the Six-Branch Yoga of Mah›mudr›, the ultimate pinnacle of all completion phase practice, renowned as the profound path of vajrayoga. Its essence is taught in the K›lacakra Root Tantra2 and the Guhyasam›ja Latter Tantra: 3 Withdrawal, meditative stability, Vital energy control, retention,Recollection, and absorption—These are accepted as the six branches.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 295TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2957/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"296 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThe glorious Ocean of Æ›kas4 also has the six branches as the medita-tion topic, the conduct that enhances it, and the result that is obtained, teaching the complete path and result by means of these eight topics. Also the Cakrasa ̇vara Root Tantra,5 the [Æ›kinı Vajra] Tent,6 and the [Hevajra Tantra] in Two Parts7 fully present the meaning, though in an unclear manner. What is more, this is the very path that is presented in all tantras.Overview of Approach and Attainment [2]Practicing with threefold confi dence,The complete deity’s form with fourfold disregard is the approach,The main practices of withdrawal, meditative stability, vital energy control, and retention are near attainment,Through recollection of desire, great passion is the attainment,And in meditative absorption, the sublime pristine awareness body is great attainment.8How is one guided along this path? One needs to practice with three kinds of confi dence, as taught in Stainless Light: 9The Blessed One spoke of three types of confi dence for this mantra vehicle:First is the period of confi dence in the tantra,Next there is confi dence in the guru,And after that confi dence in oneself.With these three, the path of genuine buddhahood will be totally complete.Confi dence in the tantra means confi dence that these are the esoteric instructions of defi nitive meaning derived from the precise words explic-itly presented in the defi nitive pure tantras that came directly from the mouth of the perfect Buddha, whose meaning has been expounded by authentic scholar-adepts. Confi dence in the guru is confi dence that such a teaching has come from the Buddha directly to oneself in an unbroken lineage of gurus who have attained spiritual powers based on this path, or who have had TOK_8-4_Final.indd 296TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2967/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 297special experiences in accordance with this tantra, such that there has been no degeneration in its blessings. Confi dence in oneself is to gain confi dence in meditative experience, the tantra, and the esoteric instruction, as one’s own meditation leads to the arising of experiences in harmony with those explained in the tantra, and [those experiences] have occurred just as the guru said they would. When one has these three kinds of confi dence, the reason for dharma will be understood and one will gain the initial inspiration10 from which arises the pure path to the attainment of supreme spiritual powers. The uncommon preliminaries along with the main practice are included in the four branches of approach and attainment. The K›lacakra Condensed Tantra states:11Approach through the fi ve elixirs and so on, the ocean vajras,12 the mantra repetition, and so on. Near attainment comes through withdrawal and so on, and the elixir born from the vajra and lotus.Attainment occurs in meditation upon the equal fl avor of the three vajras, such as joy and so on, and the water-born lotus.Great attainment defi nitely occurs from the union with wisdom whenever there is no emission and by the subtle yoga.13In general, there are many divisions of the four branches of approach and attainment in the main practice of the completion phase. However, at this point we should calculate one time what the four branches of approach and attainment are in terms of the completion phase prelimi-naries and main practice in conjunction.14 Since the fourfold disregard in the preliminaries lays the foundation of the deity’s form in the comple-tion phase, it is the branch of approach. That very deity’s form dur-ing withdrawal, meditative stability, vital energy control, and retention constitutes the branch of near attainment. Recollection of the passionate desire of the three mudras is the unchanging bliss of great passion, the branch of attainment. And since meditative absorption accomplishes the actual sublime form of pristine awareness, it is the branch of great attain-ment.15 The meaning of the fi rst verse of the tantra above is explained in Stainless Light: 16TOK_8-4_Final.indd 297TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2977/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"298 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeHere the beginner should fi rst approach through the ritual of the means of accomplishment (grub thabs, s›dhana). Regarding the statement “approach through the fi ve elixirs and so on,” the external fi ve elixirs are feces and so on. “So on” refers to cow, dog, and such.17 Eating these in order to please the deity is the approach. The fi ve inner elixirs are the fi ve aggregates. “So on” refers to the fi ve senses, which are the fi ve lamps. To disregard those is the approach—it is the total renunciation of bodily and material craving. Through that approach, the deities will bestow the supreme spiritual power. It is not through eating feces and such. “The ocean vajras” refers to the disregard for physical enjoy-ment, the disregard for vocal enjoyment, the disregard for mental enjoyment, and disregard for the enjoyment of emis-sion, which is restraint (vows) of body, speech, mind, and pure conduct. That is what it means. Through this the deities will bestow the supreme spiritual power, not because of attachment to the enjoyments of existence.Possessing this fourfold disregard is the same as what is called in general terms “reliance on three isolations” (dben gsum bsten pa): isolation of the body from activity, of the voice from expression, and of the mind from thought. Since the six branches of the main practice are the yogas of the four vajras, and the preliminaries that establish the foundation for that must include the four kinds of disregard, they are therefore termed “ocean vajras” (chu gter rdo rje). Disregard for the physical enjoyment is the preliminary that lays the foundation for the yoga of the Body vajra using withdrawal and meditative stability. Similarly, disregard for vocal enjoy-ment is for the Speech [yogas] of vital energy control and retention, disregard for mental enjoyment is for the Mind [yogas] of recollection, and disregard for enjoyment of emission is for the yoga of absorption in pristine awareness vajra. As for the meaning of those terms, “approach” (bsnyen pa) is so called because one will grow close to the supreme spiritual power, such as when the road that takes one to the city is in sight. “Near attainment” (nye bar sgrub pa) means nearer to that accomplishment, as when one is prepar-ing to travel that road. “Attainment” (sgrub pa) is just the beginning of TOK_8-4_Final.indd 298TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2987/10/09 1:59:07 PM7/10/09 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 299engaging in the uncommon cause of attaining the result, like entering the road and traveling upon it. “Great attainment” (sgrub pa chen po) means unhindered engagement with the result, like entering the city gates. Th e Meaning of Each Branch of Vajrayoga [3]This has six parts: withdrawal, meditative stability, vital energy control, retention, recollection, and meditative absorption.Withdrawal [a]The vital points of gazing and binding the functions Sever all connections individually, drawing consciousnesses inward.The faculties of pristine awareness interact with fi ve alternate objects.The cessation of the mandalas of method and wisdom completes the ten signs.Furthermore, as occurs in the King of Tantras: 18In the approach, the ten aspects of the fi rst yoga use the Cakrin’s wrathful gaze into space.With the gaze of an u ̋nı ̋acakrin19and the vital points of binding the bodily functions, all connections between the ordinary fi ve sense organs and their fi ve objects are individually severed and the consciousnesses that stray to objects are drawn inside. Five other faculties that are the nature of pristine awareness then interact with fi ve alternate objects that are the nature of luminous clarity. As it says:20In withdrawal within the body, the ten physical subjects and objects are not engaged.Those stages of yoga cause the right and left channel mandalas of method and wisdom to cease within the central channel, and the ten signs are quickly completed. The great adept ⁄avaripa said:21TOK_8-4_Final.indd 299TOK_8-4_Final.indd 2997/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"300 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeHaving the threefold immobility Introduces the ten energy currents into the dhÒti.22Outer and inner thoughts stop and the ten signs occur.This is the branch of individual severance.Now, many past masters have cited the K›lacakrap›da Transmission,23 which says, “All should be understood as sixfold.” Applying this idea, all the branches are explicated using a sixfold system: (1) the meaning of the individual name, (2) the time for meditation, (3) the branches of the meditation techniques, (4) the valid signs of meditation, (5) divisions of what is purifi ed and what purifi es, and (6) the results obtained from the meditation. Th e Meaning of the Name [i]First the meaning of the name “withdrawal” (so sor sdud pa; praty›h›ra): Praty- means “individual” and ›h›ra means “withdrawal,” “rejection,” “consumption,” “severance,” or “acceptance,” depending on the context. Here it means withdrawal. Through grammatical linkage it becomes praty›h›ra, “individual withdrawal.”24 The meaning is as explained above.Th e Time for Meditation [ii]The fi rst time for doing the meditation on the initial withdrawal is immediately after the energy current moves from the left nostril to the right, when the earth energy falls. If one meditates at that time, since the movements from the right [nostril] are the circulation of the sequen-tial withdrawal [or dissolution] of the elements,25 it becomes the special interdependent connection for impure appearances to absorb into space. Regardless, beginners should pursue meditation at all times except when sleeping.Th e Meditation Techniques [iii]The essence is to have the ability to withdraw the energy currents into the central channel by means of nonconceptuality with threefold immo-bility. The two yogas, daytime and nighttime, are for the purifi cation TOK_8-4_Final.indd 300TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3007/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 301of the twofold divisions into method and wisdom, such as the develop-ment and destruction of the environment, the birth and death of its inhabitants, the two declinations [of the sun] in a year, the two phases of the moon, day and night, right and left movement of the constituents, the balance and imbalance in the movements of time-conjunctions and energy currents,26 and so on. Therefore, one defi nitely needs both day and night yogas. As stated in the [Guhyasam›ja] Latter Tantra: At night, the yoga with smoke and so forth, and again during the day, blazing in the sky and so forth....In particular, the vital point is that the night yoga gathers the fi ve man-dalas on the right into the central channel and the day yoga gathers the fi ve on the left, causing the ten defi nite signs of day and night and so forth to arise. This is the main signifi cance. Th e Valid Signs of Meditation [iv]There are ten objective signs of the meditative absorption of withdrawal. The four signs of the night yoga are given in the [K›lacakra Condensed] Tantra: 27In emptiness, there is smoke, mirage, brilliant immaculate sky light, and lamp fl ames.The six signs of the day yoga in the Tantra are28Blazing, moon, sun, vajras, lightning, and spheres will be seen.The ten signs are defi nite signs included within whichever one of those ten is appropriate. But since the signs of indefi nite form are limitless, they are referred to as “seeing various images.” Furthermore, they are called signs because they are the cause of the birth of the confi dence that the pristine awareness of ultimate truth resides in oneself and that by meditating on the path it will be actualized. They are not signs that are merely relative deluded appearances.The consciousness that perceives such signs is a valid cognition (tshad ma). The K›lacakra Tantra states:29TOK_8-4_Final.indd 301TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3017/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"302 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeWhatever the frame of reference for the deity, it has two aspects: direct and inferential.Direct [valid cognition] is union with thatness, causing many forms of the sa ̇bhogak›ya, like stars in the sky.As is taught, the valid cognition of the creation stage is inferential, but all valid cognition of the Six-Branch Yoga is direct. In terms of the defi n-ing characteristics of valid cognition, there are four: sensory direct valid cognition, mental direct valid cognition, yogic direct valid cognition and refl exively aware direct valid cognition. But in terms of essence there is a single direct valid cognition. Therefore all direct valid cognition dur-ing each of the six yogas does fully include the four parts of direct valid cognition. However, in this situation the sensory direct valid cognition is primary and, of the fi ve eyes,30 its sensory basis is the fl esh eyeball. As stated in Stainless Light: Here, since at fi rst the beginner yogin lacks clairvoyance, the fl esh eye sees various things.The Sanskrit term for eye is ak ̋a, but it also means all the sense organs. Thus it is not taken as only the basis of seeing images of form but is applied to the entire apprehension of the form, sound, smell, taste, and sensation of emptiness. This pertains similarly to the topics below.Divisions of What Is Purifi ed and What Purifi es [v]The ground of the stains that are to be refi ned in all six yogas is nothing but the reality of buddha nature, so there is nothing to divide. However, to classify that which is to be purifi ed, in general there are thirty-six aggregates and constituents. Of those, what is to be purifi ed in con-nection with withdrawal is the single set of six constituents of pristine awareness, such as the aggregate of pristine awareness and so forth.31 There are ten divisions in the agent that purifi es, which is the yoga of withdrawal itself. By virtue of there being a sequential arising of ten signs, there are ten divisions of higher or lower levels of experience and realization.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 302TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3027/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 303Th e Results of Meditation [vi]The immediate result is the attainment of [the power of] true words32 and the effi cacy of mantra. The [K›lacakra Condensed Tantra] says:33Through withdrawal, the yogin who is totally free of objects is blessed by all mantras.The ultimate result is that at that time of attaining the state of complete awakening, infi nite mandalas of the sixfold set of the pristine awareness constituent appear as deities such as Vajrasattva.Meditative Stability [b]The branch of meditative stability stabilizes the images of emptiness.34 With form and mind resting in equipoise, the fi ve branches of meditative stability are complete;Apparent images are endowed with three certainties and fi ve properties.As stated in Stainless Light: 35Meditative stability in the various forms that are the single unity of the ten objects and subjects. This means resting in equipoise with one-pointed mental focus on the luminous clarity of images of emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects,36 allowing one to attain control of abiding and moving [of thought] as desired. When the fi ve branches of meditative stability such as conception, analysis, and so forth37 are well completed, infi nite appear-ing images with fi ve properties arise endowed with the three certainties. The certain object is the great vital essence sphere, the certain time is throughout meditation and post-meditation, and the certain manifesta-tion is with all marks and characteristics.This also has the six topics, such as the meaning of the name, and so on.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 303TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3037/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"304 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e Meaning of the Name [i]Dhy›na in Sanskrit means unwavering attention on a point of refer-ence.38 That also means to take control of the point of reference, such as when a door bolt that is well secured prevents the door frame from shift-ing or warping, allowing one to control opening and closing the door.Th e Time for Meditation [ii]The best time is at the culmination of withdrawal, but if not, then at the time that stable manifestations of the signs of luminous clarity arise. Th e Meditation Techniques [iii]From the Short Presentation on Empowerment: 39 Form will be seen as a dream.Meditate constantly on that form.Thus the essence of meditative stability is the absorption of one-pointed focus on the manifest signs of luminous clarity. The branches of that are taught in the [K›lacakra] Condensed Tantra: 40Meditative stabilities are the one-pointed mental focus of dis-cernment, conception, analysis, joy, and unwavering bliss.(1) Discernment41 is the mind in one-pointed focus on the ten signs of luminous clarity. (2) Of conception it is said, “So-called conception (rtog pa) is apprehen-sion (’dzin pa) of an entity.” Therefore, knowing the defi ning character-istic of the form of emptiness that bears the name of entity is conception. However, the manner of knowing the defi ning characteristics is not just through ideas but through direct experiences. (3) The branch of analysis is the experiential certainty of mind itself arising as forms of emptiness without any overlay of elaborated charac-teristics whatsoever from dualism or subject-object concepts.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 304TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3047/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 305(4) The mental bliss that is evoked by meditative absorption occurs in two stages: focused internally and focused externally. Focusing externally is the arising of experiences of happiness and joy, like fi nding unprec-edented great contentment. That is the branch of bliss.42 (5) The branch of unwavering bliss is the internal focus on the experi-ence of that very absorption arising as bliss. With that as the stimulus, one is pervaded by the special bliss of an utterly pliant body—an added benefi t of unwavering bliss. First discernment alone arises. Then with conception it occurs as two-fold. Similarly, it becomes threefold with analysis, fourfold with joy, and fi vefold with unwavering bliss. With just that, the branches of meditative stability have fully arisen in one’s mindstream. Therefore if one sustains the continuity of that very experience and meditates, the qualities of consummation will quickly arise.Th e Valid Signs of Meditation [iv]The Tantra says:The forms of the buddhas in the center of it are the many sa ̇bhogak›ya forms totally free of object.This presents the uncommon signs of meditative stability. Consolidated by the ten signs, the images of the entire three existences are much greater than seen before at the time of withdrawal. Those multicolored images of various forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations are seen marked by many vital essence spheres and have a form endowed with fi ve properties called radiant, minute, glittering, vibrating, and durable.43 Many images of buddhas arise in the center of the spheres. Since that too is realized to be the pure appearance of mind itself, all relative karmic appearance naturally arises like illusion. From the [Guhyasam›ja] Latter Tantra: Mind, through stable meditative stability, even abandons utterly the external entities.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 305TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3057/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"306 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeThe valid cognition is the same as for withdrawal, but the sensory base for it is the divine eye, and for that reason one also achieves the fi ve clairvoyances.44 Divisions of What Is Purifi ed and What Purifi es [v]The basis of purifi cation is the same as explained in the section on with-drawal. To classify that which is purifi ed, it is divided into a single set of six aggregates and constituents of space, such as the aggregate of con-sciousness.45 That which purifi es is the branch of meditative stability itself. It has ten divisions: the fi ve branches of meditative stability as subjects, and the fi ve forms of emptiness that are their objects.Th e Results of Meditation [vi]It says in the Tantra: 46Lord of men, fi ve kinds of clairvoyance will be attained, puri-fi ed by applying meditative stability.The immediate result of the culmination of meditative stability is the naturally arising occurrence of the fi ve clairvoyances. The ultimate result is that the sixfold set of the space constituent47 is actualized as the Victor Ak ̋obhya and the other deities.Vital Energy Control [c]The branch of vital energy control causes the karmic energy currents to cease within the dhÒti.Refi ning the channel pathways, vital energy enters into the dhÒti.If unable to bind it with the vase breath, forceful methods are to block itAt the lower door, release it upwards, and taste the inner elixir.Blazing blends the vital and downward-clearing energies and immortality is attained.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 306TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3067/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 307There are two versions of this: the real branch of vital energy control with full characteristics, and the analogous vital energy control that is to be accomplished by beginners. For the time being, it will be explained with reference to the latter.The instructions from the lineage of the great pa ̊ ̃ita ⁄›kyaŸrı48 and the two traditions of Ra49 and Dro50 are combined into a single instruc-tion known as the Six Vajra Lines: (1) The preliminary refi nes the channel pathways through vajra repetition. (2) Once refi ned, the yoga of fi lling and expelling with gentle breath-ing exercise directs the vital energy into the central channel. (3) Once it enters, the yoga of forceful vase-breathing binds the vital energy in the central channel. (4) When it has not entered the central channel and one is unable to bind it, the yoga of forceful methods binds the paths of sun and moon and blocks it. When it is blocked at the lower door by the forceful methods, it is released upwards by the yoga. (5) By the yoga of utilizing the uvula, the potency of inner elixir is tasted.51 (6) The yoga of blazing inner heat blends vital and downward-clear-ing energy and accomplishes immortality.

That is the need for vital energy control.Th e Duration of Meditation [cc]When meditating on the yoga, one should continue until the energy cur-rents fl ow exclusively in the central channel. With that, one will achieve the power to retain and reverse the coarse bodhicitta. In reference to a person of sharp faculties being able to accomplish that in six months, the [K›lacakra] Tantra says:55By six months for diligent ascetics the sensation of lower bliss will balance and become the mind of the path.Th e Essence of Vital Energy Control [dd][The K›lacakra Tantra] states:56In vital energy control, the pathways are both deposed and the vital energy totally enters the central channel and becomes pure.This is a meditative absorption that causes the energy currents of the right and left channels to be stopped, the energy currents that circulate in the channels of feces and urine below are also stopped in the conch-bearing channel.57 Similarly, the vital energy that circulates in the central channel and the downward-clearing energy current that circulates in the conch-bearing channel are gathered into one.How to Meditate on Vital Energy Control [ee]The practice is the vajra repetition. It is presented in the K›lacakra Tantra: 58Through moon, sun, “a” and so forth and “ka” and so forth, the three movements abide and there is repetition of the Body vajra, and so forth.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 309TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3097/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"310 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeFilling [or inhaling] and expelling with the gentle breathing exercise straightens out the deviation of breath.

By half a month, the yogin possessing yoga will cheat the death-bringers and death-omens. The main practice of fi lling and vase-breathing are also presented:59The mouth too is closed, and from the two nostrils all outer energy currents are drawn in by the force of the vital energy [exercise] and like immaculate lightning, joined with the downward-clearing energy currents.

During vital energy control, the ten mandalas of the left and right energy currents had previously come to abide in the central channel. Now, as a continuation of that, the same vital energy and downward-clearing energy currents that were blended in one mass enter into the indestructible vital essence or imperishable vital essence in the central channel. There, the energy currents with the characteristics of coming and going dissolve or vanish. Of course, that can occur in the six chakras, but the ultimate location of this is the forehead chakra. Therefore when the vital energy or energy current enters there and stabilizes without emission, the branch of subsequent mindfulness commences. The six topics, such as the meaning of the name and so forth, apply here also.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 312TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3127/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 313Th e Meaning of the Name [i]Dh›ra ̊a in Sanskrit can refer to both retaining (’dzin pa) and to the object that is retained (gzung bya), so there are various translations.

In the analogous branch of retention, it is the same as for the branch of vital energy control.Th e Meditation Techniques [iii]There are fi ve parts:Th e Object on Which Retention Is Performed [aa]It is the energy current of bliss, which is the energy current connected to the indestructible vital essence.Th e Need for Meditation [bb]It is for the purpose of binding the bodhicitta so that it does not move and to accomplish the blazing manifestations of inner heat, the root of the arising of the special forms of emptiness that actually elicit unchang-ing bliss.Th e Duration of Meditation [cc]The duration is for as long as it takes to master the ability to stop the energy currents in the fi ve or six chakras however one wishes with the vase-breathing.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 313TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3137/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"314 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e Essence of Retention [dd]In general, the essence of retention is the dissolving of the upper and lower, and the right and left energy currents into the vital essence in the central channel at the places of the fi ve or six chakras. In particular, it is the meditative absorption of mental focus on the nondissipating vital essence stabilized at the forehead once the vital energy fully enters the vital essence at the forehead.How to Meditate on Retention [ee]For a beginner, the way to meditate on analogous retention is just as was previously explained. Real retention involves the energy current held at the central channel, which was the right and left and vital and down-ward-clearing energy currents that were formerly blended together in the six chakras by the yoga of vase-breathing. That energy current now dis-solves into emptiness in the manner of entering the vital essence, which causes the inner heat to blaze. Regarding this, there are many cases where most of the tantric com-mentary that presents retention does not mention an arrangement of more than four chakras. Where there is a tenfold division, the explana-tion includes the chakra at the crown of the head (gtsug tor, Skt. u ̋nı ̋a), indicating the necessity of practicing retention even at the crown. There-fore there are two methods: one for attaining what was not previously attained at the fi ve chakras of navel, heart, throat, head, and crown of the head, and another for stabilizing and increasing more and more what was already attained. The so-called forehead vital essence should be understood as the place where a branch of the central channel curves down from the crown of the head to between the eyebrows.65The secret vase-breathing is not actually mentioned in the commen-tary on the tantra, but it is there implicitly. Since it will clear away obstructions and enhance the previous practices, it should defi nitely be done. It is not counted separately because it is applied as part of the vase-breathing at the crown of the head.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 314TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3147/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 315Th e Valid Signs of Meditation [iv]In general, this is the same as the previous branches, but in particular the K›lacakra Tantra says:66Until one sees a black circle radiating immaculate light rays in the channel of time. This is remarkable by virtue of the black circle67 arising in the central channel, the manifestation of blazing inner heat, and the imperishable vibration. The valid cognition is the same as for vital essence control [that is, primarily mental direct valid cognition]. Divisions of What Is Purifi ed and What Purifi es [v]The divisions of what is purifi ed are the single sixfold set of the constitu-ent of fi re, and the aggregates and constituents such as the aggregate of feeling.68 To classify that which purifi es, the path of retention itself, it says in the Stainless Light: Retention of vital essence has ten aspects by dividing entering and leaving in the lotuses of the navel, heart, throat, forehead, and crown. Accordingly, there are ten divisions of higher and lower experiential real-ization of retention.Th e Results of Meditation [vi]The immediate results are mentioned in the K›lacakra Tantra: 69The force of retention weakens devils and affl ictive emotions and such, and the ten powers are engaged.Thus, the suff erings of the aggregates, such as old age and sickness, are cleared up. By understanding the nature of affl ictive emotion, one is able to make it into the path.

As taught there, the real recollection does not depend on physical train-ing or control of the energy currents and so forth. This is for the situa-tion when the knots in the channels of the six chakras have already been released, one has mastery of the bliss energy currents, and one can enjoy the blazing appearances of inner heat whenever one likes. Therefore, it is suffi cient to practice simply according to the explanation in the actual presentation of the tantra.Furthermore, real recollection is to accomplish primarily the various images of emptiness and bliss by recollection in either action-mudra, awareness-mudra, or mah›mudr›, depending on the diff erence in the thinness and thickness of the vital essence of persons of the three levels of faculties.Analogous recollection is for beginners to stabilize the blended vital and downward-clearing energy currents by practicing the physical pos-tures. As a branch of that, one refi nes the energy currents through reten-tion, reversal, and so on, and learns the physical yoga exercises of binding the physical functions. Having done that, the main practice is to blend the three—the meditated action-mudra, the hand-mudra of one’s own body, and the action-mudra of another’s body—with the mah›mudr› of forms of emptiness. Meditation on the blazing and dripping based on inner heat is a branch of that.73 Now, the six topics, such as the meaning of the name and so forth:Th e Meaning of the Name [i]Anu is translated as “subsequent,” and sm ̧ti as “recollection” [or “mind-fulness”]. The term anu can apply both to inferior (dman pa) and to superior (lhag pa), but in this case, it has the meaning of superior. Thus anusm ̧ti or subsequent recollection means superior recollection. Recol-lecting again what was previously cultivated in meditation, it is intense recollection (shin tu dran pa). It refers to the vigorous eff ort of meditat-ing again and again on the forms of emptiness of mah›mudr›.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 317TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3177/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"318 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e Time for Meditation [ii]Once retention has been perfected and one has mastered the channels, energy currents, and vital essence, the defi nite time for recollection is when the appearance of inner heat arises as infi nite forms of deities endowed with all sublime aspects.Th e Meditation Techniques [iii]This has fi ve parts:Th e Object on Which Recollection Is Performed [aa]In general, the object is all the channels, energy currents, and vital energy. Mainly, it is the forms of emptiness of the blazing appearance of inner heat, plus the vital essence of the four or six chakras, which is the support, and the melting bliss, which is what is supported.Th e Need for Recollection [bb]It is in order to really accomplish unchanging bliss that one learns the bliss of melting without emission.Th e Duration of Meditation [cc]One should keep meditating until the fi rst moment of unchanging bliss arises. Even after unchanging bliss has already arisen, it is not that one abandons the continuity of recollection and meditates on a new path with diff erent visualizations, but rather that the continuity of recollection itself transforms into that of [the sixth branch], meditative absorption. Th e Essence of Recollection [dd]The essence is the single-pointed absorption in the recurring arousal of melting bliss without emission that results from meditative equipoise in a nonconceptual and unconfused manner on subtle and coarse forms of emptiness of the manifestations of the three worlds—primarily the TOK_8-4_Final.indd 318TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3187/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 319forms of emptiness of the mother-father deities in union that are the blazing appearance of inner heat. This applies whether or not one relies on an actual mudra partner.How to Meditate on Recollection [ee]The K›lacakra Tantra says:74There is a variety according to divisions such as inferior and so on, but primarily the three methods of accomplishment,The three mudras and three states, by virtue of three modes of progress, are the action, the conceptual, and the sublime.Accordingly, in the initial state of dull faculties and thin vital essence, when one is unable to completely elicit the four joys without relying on an action-mudra partner, one meditates on the recollection that combines the three practices of action-mudra, awareness-mudra, and mah›mudr› into one. Then there is a jump75 in the faculty level, and at this intermedi-ate stage one’s faculties become moderate and the vital essence thickens somewhat. Once this state occurs, when one is still unable to completely elicit bliss through mah›mudr› alone but can do without an action-mudra partner, then one should abandon the action-mudra practice and meditate on the recollection that combines the two practices of aware-ness-mudra and mah›mudr› into one.Again there is a jump in faculties, which now become acute. For the state in which the bodhicitta has become quite thick, one can completely elicit the bliss of melting through mah›mudr› alone. While one has not yet attained unchanging bliss, one should meditate on the recollection that relies solely on mah›mudr›. These [three levels of recollection are all described] with reference primarily to meditative equipoise. The connection with the behavior of deliberate conduct in post-meditation is indefi nite.Regarding these three states, there is also the view that maintains the “application of four mudras,” “application of three mudras,” and “appli-cation of two mudras,” and the progression called “application of three,” “application of two,” and “application of one.”76 TOK_8-4_Final.indd 319TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3197/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"320 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e Valid Signs of Meditation [iv]Every occasion in which the four joys are completely elicited, the ema-nation of infi nite blazing appearances of inner heat arise in increasingly enhanced ways. Even if one tried to emit the white jasmine bodhicitta,77 it would not be emitted, but would forcefully reverse itself upwards from the tip of the jewel. Even one’s own body appears as the light mandala of forms of emptiness. The images of emptiness of the pure and impure three existences radiate and absorb continuously. As for valid cognition, all four kinds of direct valid cognition are pres-ent, but since it is the pristine awareness of intrinsic awareness involved in experiencing sublime inner bliss, it is primarily refl exively aware direct valid cognition.Divisions of What Is Purifi ed and What Purifi es [v]The divisions of what is purifi ed are the single set of the element of water, six aggregates and constituents, such as perception and so on.78 The agent that purifi es is the branch of recollection, which has ten divi-sions. As stated in the K›lacakra Tantra: 79Thought, desire, physical plague, a mouth with dry lips, aversion to food,Trembling, insanity, idiocy, a befuddled mind, a deep swoon,Ten brilliant forms, such as vajra-bearing smoke, which to the body of a living creature in the world are totally clear and cer-tain.Who desires victory over those disturbing situations?Thus, when each of the forms of emptiness in the tenfold division of signs sequentially elicits bliss, it is equivalent to the state of contempla-tion.

The experience of bliss-emptiness is unceasing.The ultimate result is that the mandala of the sixfold set of the water constituent is actualized as the deity Amit›bha and so on.Meditative Absorption [f]The branch of meditative absorption is the unity of the forms of empti-ness and unchanging bliss.Transformation into meditative absorption of melting bliss without emission is accomplished.In the real one, through the arising and reversal of the ten signs of mah›mudr›,The forms of emptiness of melting bliss are bound at the tip of the jewel,Causing the seminal fl uids and energy currents to cease.Beginning with the fi rst immutable instant until the twelfth spiritual level,Breathing ceases and unchanging joy increases proportionally.This is union, the embodiment of wisdom and method.The K›lacakra Tantra says:81This is meditative absorption in the form of pristine aware-ness by virtue of unchanging bliss that is the embodiment of wisdom and method.In accordance with this, the meditative absorption of union is the culmi-nation of melting bliss without emission, accomplishing the transforma-tion of the vital essence substance into forms of emptiness, that into a vital essence, and that into unchanging bliss.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 321TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3217/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"322 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeWhile the real meditative absorption is mostly similar to the practice of recollection of mah›mudr›, practicing with many diff erent action-mudra partners is taught as a method for advancement. Practicing in that way, once one is able to generate the complete melting bliss in forward and reverse order through the totally complete ten signs of mah›mudr›,82 then it will not be long until the vital essence of the pre-vious instant will transform into a form of emptiness in the next. Also, the form of emptiness that is the blazing of inner heat together with the blazing of the action inner heat consumes the vital essence.83 With that kind of melting bliss, the [resulting] form of emptiness is bound at the tip of the jewel.84 When that happens it blocks one action current that is a portion of the ten energy currents, one white [vital essence drop] in the area of the jewel, and one red [vital essence drop] in the area of the crown of the head. Hence consciousness—the phenomena made up of three elemental constituents of the seminal fl uids (sperm and ovum) and the energy currents—dissolves into the forms of emptiness of pris-tine awareness. Through this, one attains the fi rst instant of unchanging pristine awareness comprised of emptiness, bliss, and clarity. From that point on, each previous instant of pristine awareness changes to one progressively more sublime and as each one is attained, one should know that it is the successive instant of meditative absorption. In this manner up through twelve spiritual levels,85 the movement of 21,600 breaths of the karmic energy current ceases and the unchanging joy increases proportionally. At the end of the culmination of meditative absorption, one attains the embodiment of wisdom and method, the union k›ya or pristine awareness k›ya. This is the attainment of the lesser level of bud-dhahood and the fi rst level of a vajra-holder.86Now, as for the vital energy as a form of emptiness: since it is free of being corporeal form and is essentially pristine awareness, it is not sub-ject to fl uctuation. Therefore it has been established as “the vital essence stabilizing.” Moreover, since it is completely bound at the end of its descent, the energy current is fi rst blocked after the ascent. Then one portion of the red aspect stabilizes at the top of the head, causing the red to blaze downwards. That condition causes one portion of the white to stabilize at the jewel. In this, the binding of all 21,000 instants takes place only in the jewel. At fi rst the place of stabilizing is, of course, the jewel for the white and only the top of the head for the red. There, all those that have been stabilized stack up on the previous ones, so that it appears TOK_8-4_Final.indd 322TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3227/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 323to be fi lling up gradually. From this process, there are references of from “half-fi lled secret chakra” to “crown chakra completely fi lled and stable” and “the red also stabilized in each place from the crown to the jewel.”As for the energy currents, while certainly a portion will be stabilized along with the white and red [aspects] in the crown and the jewel, pri-marily those that were previously located above the heart were controlled by the vital energy and those involved with the functioning of darkness (mun pa can) and r›hu (sgra gcan) dissolve at the navel. Those that were previously located below the navel and mainly controlled by the down-ward-clearing energy current, the energy currents of darkness, the one named fi re, and fi re of time, dissolve at the heart and cease.These are the main locations. In general, the three constituents of male and female seminal fl uids and the energy currents all become blocked in every part of the body.Now, the six topics, such as the meaning of the name and so forth:Th e Meaning of the Name [i]Sam›dhi is meditative absorption. It also has the connotation of total adherence to a state of equipoise, and is therefore free of subject-object dualism. So it refers to the mind abiding in a state where subject and object are undiff erentiated.Th e Time for Meditation [ii]The time for this meditation is at the culmination of the branch of recol-lection, when one is able to immediately produce unchanging bliss.

[When it is conceptually] divided into two isolated aspects, it is wis-dom that is unchanging bliss, and skillful method that is the pristine awareness k›ya endowed with the supreme of all aspects. Meditative absorption is the experience of union without any aspect of dualistic appearance from perceiving these two separately. The culmination of melting bliss without emission is the catalyst for stopping one karmic energy current. One tenth of the three channels dissolves into the central channel.87 The individual movements of the white and red constituents are “stabilized,” that is, immobilized, within the central channel. In that way when the channels, energy currents, and constituents are henceforth indestructible and become unceasing forms of emptiness, the pristine awareness that is essentially one with that is called unchanging bliss. Thus it is said, “forms of emptiness are known by bliss; great bliss is known by itself.”How to Meditate in Meditative Absorption [ee]From the K›lacakra Tantra: 88Here, the yoga of coemergent pristine awareness that is peace, the singular, undiminished bliss is great attainment.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 324TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3247/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 325And from the K›lacakrap›da Transmission: With mind resting fi rmly without wavering in the equal tasteOf meditation with reference to forms of emptinessAnd without reference in bliss, All things arise as bliss.The unchanging bliss of the vital essence that was previously trans-formed, and the melting bliss without emission produced by the descent and reversal of vital essence that will be transformed later but is not now transformed turn into a single group. The mind within this state of bliss is utterly passionate towards the forms of emptiness, causing the melting bliss without emission to be experienced again and again. In post-meditation, one should always practice the conduct with elabora-tion, or practice whatever is appropriate as a way of enhancement or advancement.89 Th e Valid Signs of Meditation [iv]The signs of this branch start from the genuine perception of one realm of worlds in the ten directions that was not previously perceived in its ultimate signifi cance, up to the genuine perception of the signifi cance of 24,000 world systems. The valid cognitions are the complete set of four valid cognitions. However, with respect to the uncommon specialty, it is the yogic valid cognition, since this branch is analogous to the pristine awareness of the exalted ones.Divisions of What Is Purifi ed and What Purifi es [v]In the divisions of what is to be purifi ed, it is the single sixfold set of aggregates and constituents connected with the earth constituent, such as the aggregate of form and so on.90Meditative absorption as that which purifi es can be divided into twelve by dividing [two aspects into] the six chakras in which the karmic energy currents cease. Alternatively, it is said that there are ten medita-tive absorptions because the ten energy currents cease. Thus there are ten stages by distinguishing the total cessation of the ten energy currents, TOK_8-4_Final.indd 325TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3257/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"326 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgesuch as the downward-clearing and so on, that have the attribute of never again arising.Th e Results of Meditation [vi]The immediate result is described in the K›lacakra Tantra: 91Then, through the purifi cation of meditative absorption, in a few days one will achieve the pristine awareness k›ya.If one meditates without interruption from the fi rst arising of meditative absorption, one can actualize the level of the genuine truth of the true nature in three years and three fortnights.

These are the yoga of sleep, the recogni-tion of luminous clarity at death, the instructions of transference at the moment of passing away, recognition in the intermediate state through purposeful intent, and blending meditative equipoise and post-medita-tion by meditating in sessions. The demarcations of the spiritual levels and paths, and the arrangement of the results, is extremely important, but they are explained only generally.The branch of preventing the yogas from diminishing and causing their increase concerns the removal by general and specifi c remedies of the obstructions of devils that harm both body and mind, the obstruc-tions of meditative absorption that harm mainly the mind, and the obstructions of the physical disturbance of the elements and their con-sequences that harm mainly the body.

If we apply cause and eff ect as a pair, the fi rst fi ve branches would be the causal path, because they cause the accomplishment of forms of emptiness. Meditative absorption would be a branch of the eff ect because it is the accomplish-ment of unchanging bliss.

However, here we are discussing the uncommon context. While the other aspects are held to be virtuous, from the point of view of this ultimate defi nitive meaning, [methods that] possess the characteristic of being causes of relative cyclic existence are not very virtuous. These are conceptual meditation, fi xation on the bliss of action-mudra as ultimate, and meditation on the nonconceptual emptiness at the end of analysis. They are not, in fact, the ultimate man-dala of great bliss and emptiness. In this path, at fi rst one accomplishes the absolute mandala of forms of emptiness, so it is virtuous at the beginning. In the middle, since one stops the karmic energy currents that cause conceptual thought, it is virtuous in the middle. And in the end, one accomplishes the absolute unchanging vital essence, so it is virtuous in the end. There are those three, and during all three phases—beginning, middle, and end—it is virtuous because it is the actual appearance of genuine pristine awareness that is nonconceptuality acquitted of analysis. In general, the meaning of virtue is identifi ed as bliss and its causes.Thus, those virtuous at the beginning accomplish uncommon medita-tive absorption of calm abiding and higher insight. Those virtuous in the middle blend energy and mind early on, and later open the entranceways of the chakras. Those virtuous in the end achieve the unchanging pris-tine awareness k›ya.

The middle two branches are the tantric behavior of vajra fi re, because the inner heat of pristine awareness is accomplished. The fi nal two branches are the deliberate behavior of bodhicitta, because unchanging melting bliss and unchanging vital essence are accomplished. Furthermore, there are applications of the three bases of channels, TOK_8-4_Final.indd 328TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3287/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"jordruk \u0003 329energy currents, and vital energy; the three states of inferior, middling, and superior; the four vital essences of body, speech, mind, and pristine awareness; the four states of waking, dreaming, sleeping, and deep sleep; the four branches of approach and attainment; the four yogas of shape, mantra, dharma, and purity; the four unions; and the four k›yas and four vajras.Since the last ones are well known, their meaning will be explained. Withdrawal and meditative stability are the yogic methods for accom-plishing the vajra Body because a tath›gata’s Body is the nature of a form of emptiness. Vital energy control and retention are the yogic methods for accomplishing vajra Speech, because a buddha’s Speech is the inde-structible vibration itself arising as all sound and speech. Recollection is the yogic method to accomplish vajra Mind, because a victor’s Mind is emptiness endowed with all aspects. Meditative absorption is the yogic method for accomplishing the pristine awareness vajra, because the pris-tine awareness vajra of the conquerors is the ultimate great bliss itself. In those sequences, the object to be accomplished is the form of emp-tiness. The way it arises is as follows: During withdrawal it is merely an image. In meditative stability that itself is understood to be the mind free of elaboration. In vital energy control it arises as forms of emptiness. In retention it arises as the quintessence of the vital essence drop. In recol-lection it arises as the essence of the blazing and dripping inner heat.

In withdrawal they are abandoned in the way of nonconceptuality. In meditative stability they are abandoned through realization of them as the essence of mind. These only happen on the basis of forms of empti-ness. In vital energy control they are abandoned by means of stopping the right and left movement in the channels. In retention those two are abandoned in the manner of disappearing in their own place. Those two branches slightly suppress subject-object dualism. In recollection they are abandoned by way of sealing with bliss-emptiness.

The visual experiences are the arising of whatever signs are appropriate, while the mind automatically rests in a nonconceptual state. The physical experiences are the jumping, shak-ing, and pain. The vocal experiences are various mantras and utterances occurring in the state of equipoise, while various mental experiences such as joy, regret, anger, and desire occur in post-meditation.

In the approach, one practices withdrawal and meditative stability; in attainment, one practices vital energy control and retention; and in the great attainment, one practices recollection and meditative absorption. Thus they correspond to the practices of the Six-Branch Yoga.After Orgyenpa had completed his training in sutra and mantra, he became an eminent scholar in the K›lacakra tantras, commentaries, and esoteric instructions that he had received from the K›lacakrin Sangyé Dorjé, a holder of the Rong lineage tradition. He had discovered the ultimate realization from his teacher Götsangpa (1189-1258). He traveled many times to sacred places such as J›landhara, and in particular he had been to the land of U ̃ ̃iy›na in the west. With charisma he overcame many obstacles and fearful apparitions through his view and deliberate conduct. In the central part of U ̃ ̃iy›na, in DhÒmatali (DhÒmasthira), the ̃›kinıs of the four families in the four directions blessed him.

Then she revealed herself as really Vajrayoginı and gave him the complete instructions. The previously encountered four ̃›kinıs along with Si ̇hamukha also gave him some instructions. After returning to Tibet, his fi rst disciple was Yazangpa, just as pre-dicted by the ̃›kinı. In response to the requests of Rinpoché Khar-chuwa, he composed the primary text of this tradition, the Vajra Verses. To request these instructions, Rinpoché Karchuwa had off ered a man-dala consisting of a gold coin for every verse of visualization instruction. He then composed a brief memorandum. His attendant, Tokdenpa Dawa Sengé (thirteenth c.), compiled all the esoteric instructions into a volume. Later this became the primary system of guidance. The lord himself was queried by Golungpa Zhönnu Pal, who wrote down his answers. The learned and virtuous Butrapa Sönam Özer did not fi nd a clear curriculum, so Zurpukpa Rinchen Palzang (b. 1263) composed a big commentary. The learned Shangtön (1234-1309) and Nyedo Kunda Döndrup (b. 1268) wrote a complete explanation of the Vajra Verses. These four are known as the four great commentaries. From Sönam Özer the lineage passed to the Dharma lord Gangpa and continued until glorious guru Sönam Gyaltsen. The lineage also disseminated from the spiritual heirs of Nyedo [Monastery], and many traditions arose. From among those, the second victor, the omniscient Dharma lord Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé (1284-1339), heard the entire instruction from the great adept Orgyenpa, and from that created an illuminated excellent path that is superior to the others in its signifi -cance. Then Karmapa Rolpai Dorjé (1340-1383) and other incarnations in the lineage succession studied it and spread it widely.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 332TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3327/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Dorjé Sumgyi Nyendrup,“Approach and Attainment of the Three Vajras”....

Then by meditating at the time of the path on the yoga of the inseparable three vajras, the principle (bdag nyid) of the three secrets will be actual-ized at the time of the fruition. As it is taught in the Vajra Verses:5 Refi ning the channels purifi es the body’s stains. Refi ning the energy currents purifi es the stains of speech.

First one gathers the necessities from proper livelihood and performs the common preliminary practices. Then the upper, lower, and middle energy currents are bound according to the esoteric instructions of the three postures: the upper posture for the upper energy current, the lower posture for the lower energy current, and the middle posture for the middle energy current. By exerting eff ort day and night in this yoga, the ten root and branch energy currents and all discursive thought will enter the avadhÒti and be halted, binding the relative and ultimate bodhicitta. This causes nonconceptual meditative absorption to arise. One sees limitless signs of forms of emptiness appearing, such as smoke and so on. The measure of attainment is the supreme gift of words: the attainment of words of truth. Then when the fi ve branches of meditative stability,7 such as discernment and so on, are consummated, one attains the fi ve clairvoyances.8Th e Attainment of Vajra Speech [ii]Attainment of vajra Speech purifi es speech energy currents.Using vital energy control, downward-clearing, joining, and vajra repetition,Entering the vital essence accomplishes all great activities.What is to be refi ned are the 21,600 energy currents that are the intrinsic nature of speech. They are purifi ed by the branch of attainment in vital energy control and retention, or the attainment of vajra Speech. When the visions of the forms of emptiness are stabilized, one does the medita-tion on the esoteric instructions concerning the energy currents of vital energy control above, the downward-clearing energy currents below, and the joining energy currents in between.

The energy currents are made into the path by having no frame of reference, which is sought in the basic ground by applying the energy currents of the fi ve elements. One meditates on the seat and sequential stacking of the elements by applying the lower downward-clearing energy current. The seed syllables are created by applying the upper vital energy control currents. The implements are created based on the middle energy current. Once one has attained mental control over those energies, in retention one does the yoga of raising the deity’s form by applying the joining energy current; the vajra repetition of Body, Speech, and Mind, with no bead-counting, by means of vital energy control; and the silent repetition for the peaceful and other activities by applying the four energy currents of water, [and so on]. In this, “vital energy” (srog) refers to the upward-moving energy cur-rent, and “control” (rtsol ba) is the practice of guiding it that makes energy currents into the path. So by the yoga of blocking the vital energy, when the coming and going of the sun and moon9 have been blocked, the all-knowing pristine awareness energy current will become manifest. This is called “vital energy entering the vital essence” (srog thig ler tshud pa). Holding the energy-mind in the syllable ha ̇ is called “retention” (’dzin pa). This is the result of vital energy control. It enables the accom-plishment of all twelve great activities10 just by thinking of them.Th e Great Attainment of Vajra Mind [iii]Great attainment of vajra Mind purifi es mind and vital essence.The blazing of three fi res in the heightened passion of method and wisdomRefi nes the refuse and achieves unchanging bliss.The mind and the “seven-births” vital essence11 are what is to be refi ned. They are purifi ed and become immutable by recollection and meditative absorption in the branch of great attainment, or the great attainment of vajra Mind. Consuming the fi ve-plus-fi ve elixirs12 outwardly, inwardly, and secretly generates the body’s strength. Applying the binding of upper, lower, and middle energy currents causes the pristine awareness fi re of inner heat to blaze and burn up the seeds of the six realms that are TOK_8-4_Final.indd 336TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3367/10/09 1:59:08 PM7/10/09 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"dorjé sumgyi nyendrup \u0003 337in the six chakras of space, wind, fi re, water, earth, and pristine aware-ness. From this, the force of the four joys in both progressive and reverse order destroys the knots of the chakras. Liberated from the obscurations of the four states,13 the ignorance that is the root of cyclic existence is eliminated and recollection is perfected.As enhancement of this practice, the mutual exchange in the union of method and wisdom, where spiritual partners join body and mind as method and wisdom, causes the blazing of the three fi res in the height-ened passion. These are the fi re at the time of youth, the fi re of medita-tive absorption, and the fi re that arises from practicing union. By this means, r›hula swallows the sun and moon and all residue is transmuted into quintessence. Finally, after the energy-mind is progressively blocked starting from the secret place, the refi ned essence of bodhicitta and the energy currents is stabilized in the crown chakra, and one achieves unchanging great bliss, the culmination of the branch of meditative absorption.How the View Is Introduced [b]The view is the way it is, meditation is the three vajras, andThe fruition is purifying the three obscurations and introducing the three k›yas.The introduction to the view of the basic ground is this: The three k›yas abide spontaneously in the essence of mind itself since forever. How do they abide there? They abide in three ways: appearance the way it is, emptiness the way it is, and union the way it is. The last two are intro-duced as dharmak›ya and the fi rst is introduced as dharmat›k›ya. The introduction to meditation on the path: The three k›yas are introduced as the path through the meaning of the names, the manner of experience arising, the measure of attainment, and the necessity of practice in each of the three: withdrawal and meditative stability for vajra Body, vital energy control and retention for vajra Speech, and recollec-tion and meditative absorption for vajra Mind. The introduction to the fruition: Practicing the approach and attain-ment of the three vajras results in the purifi cation of the three-times-three obscurations,14 which introduces the three k›yas obtained in one body in one lifetime.

Interestingly, it does not describe the tradition presented here in the esoteric instructions, that of ⁄›ntigupta. On the other hand, this lin-eage is often described by Kongtrul’s hero and predecessor T›ran›tha, who was a direct recipient of the transmission through his Indian guru Buddhaguptan›tha, a disciple of ⁄›ntigupta. In The Seven Instruction Lineages, T›ran›tha gives the history of each of the lineages of teachings that converged in the one master, ⁄›ntigupta.

Higher insight is developed through the eight cycles of introduction, such as the introduction to the mind’s natural luminous clarity.7 Clearing away the obstructions of drowsiness and agi-tation in the fl ow of thoughts, practice is enhanced by bliss, clarity, and nonthought.[Inner Heat] [c]As a preliminary, refi ning the path of the channels through energy cur-rents, channels, and vital essence blesses the channels.

One should cultivate illusory waking state, illusory dream, and illusory intermediate existence along with the supplementary branch of transference of Body, Speech, Mind, and pris-tine awareness.

Instant and subsequent dissipation are the enhancement.[Action-mudra] [e]The special preliminary is the guru yoga and off ering to the pure realms,11 which cleanses the channels in the four chakras. The main practice is engaged once one has become accustomed to the four applications of energy currents.12 The path is cultivated through the ten vital instruc-tions, such as sublime drawing up, drawing up through the channels, drawing up through the branches, and so on.

The term “and [more]” in the root text is a connective particle as the last word, meaning that there is more. As illustrated by the Six Guid-ances of Mitra,17 and all kinds of red instructions, there are yet an enor-mous number of minor guidance systems of esoteric instructions that developed in the Land of Snows. It would be impossible to describe them individually, but there is nothing that could not be subsumed into the concise meaning of two stages, or into the two practices of calm abiding and higher insight, or into the two practices of emptiness and compassion.Clearing Away Obstructions and Enhancement Practices [2]Clearing away obstructions and enhancing is crucial in all completion phase [practices].Clearing up the obstructions of the channels, energy currents, and vital essence in the path of method, and clearing up the obstructions to calm abiding, such as drowsiness and agitation, and the obstructions to higher insight, such as errors and deviations, in the path of liberation, as well as developing devotion, compassion, and particular conduct whenever appropriate increasingly enhances the benefi ts of practice. These are cru-cial instructions for completion phase practice in general. However, they can be found extensively in the individual guidance systems, and will not be described here.This was the fourth chapter of the detailed presentation of the sequence of meditation in vajray›na emphasizing the esoteric instructions.This concludes the commentary of the eighth book on the divisions of the sequence of training of higher meditative absorption from The Encompassment of All Knowledge: A Treatise That Eff ectively Presents the Three Trainings, a Treasury of Precious Scripture Compiled from the Approaches of All Vehicles.TOK_8-4_Final.indd 344TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3447/10/09 1:59:09 PM7/10/09 1:59:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"APPENDIX ONEOutline of Book Eight, Part Four: Esoteric Instructions[Chapter 1: Nyingma] 63I.

According to Nesar Karma Tashi Chöpel’s Account of the Passing and Funeral Observances of the All-Seeing Lord, the Venerable Jamgön Ngag-gi Wangchuk Yönten Gyatso, he died around midnight on the twenty-seventh day of the eleventh month of the Earth Pig year (f. 12a-b). This would place his death sometime in January of 1900, shortly before the new Tibetan year of the Iron Mouse.

Palpung was founded in 1727 by the eighth Situ, Chökyi Jungné (Chos kyi ’byung gnas, 1699-1774), and has remained the seat of the important Tai Situ line of incarnations. The area above the monas-tery was called Tsadra Rinchen Drak (Tsa ’dra rin chen brag), “The Jewel Cliff that is like Tsari” (the inspiration for Tsadra Foundation). This area was revealed as sacred ground by Kongtrul and a three-year retreat center was built there, which is back in operation today after a thirty-year hiatus. It is here that Kongtrul Rinpoché often stayed in retreat and guided many others in retreats.

Associated with Dzongsar mon-astery, he was a scholar, compiler, treasure revealer, and all-around brilliant master, who was considered an emanation of the bodhisattva of wisdom, MañjuŸrı.

This agrees with a defi nition given by the late great translator Herbert Guenther in The Royal Song of Saraha (30), who trans-lated it as “signifi cant communication,” though only in reference to upadeŸa. He quotes Karma Phrin-las-pa (Do-h› skor-gsum, f. 58b): “man-ngag means to point out an important topic in a few words, or to elucidate the meaning of existence by having singled out the means of its understanding” (cited in Smith, 281, n. 95). 31 These examples and the foregoing descriptions are from Gangteng Tulku Rinpo-ché, a Bhutanese Nyingma master in the Peling (Pad gling) tradition, interviewed on 11/7/05. 32 Ringu Tulku Rinpoché, who preferred “key instructions” for this reason. 33 Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, 2nd ed., 624: “Gr. esßterikos, from esßteros, inner, comp. of esß, within.” This is often used to describe vajray›na Bud-dhism in general, in comparison to other “exoteric” kinds of Buddhism.

Mantra (sngags, Skt. mantra), or often “secret mantra” (gsang sngags), refers to the practices based on the tantras, and is here synonymous with vajray›na (rdo rje theg pa), “the indestructible way” or vehicle. Kongtrul has explained the meaning of mantra and its distinctions from tantra in an earlier section of The Treasury of Knowledge (TOK 2: 560-766; Book 6, notes to pages 29 to 68 \u0003 369TOK_8-4_Final.indd 369TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3697/10/09 1:59:09 PM7/10/09 1:59:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"370 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgePart 4, translated as Systems of Buddhist Tantra [SBT]). Briefl y, the Sanskrit term mantra means “to protect the mind” and can also mean “secret utterance,” as in the more popular usage of it as a kind of incantation. The essence of mantra is the union of emptiness and compassion. Kongtrul states, “All aspects of secret mantra and the pristine awareness of great bliss are referred to as mantra. Applications of secret mantra (the collections of [rituals] for the activations and powers) are known as tantra” (SBT, 86-7). 2 For a discussion on the divisions of tantra, see the chapter by that name in SBT, 89-98. Generally “outer” (phyi ) refers to the fi rst two tantric systems of the fourfold division, that is, action and conduct tantras, because they are mostly concerned with outer physical and verbal practices such as ablution. “Inner” (nang) refers to yoga and highest yoga tantras because they are concerned primarily with con-templation and interiority. Highest yoga tantra (rnal ’byor bla med or bla med rgyud, Skt. anuttaratantra) is said to be for recipients of the highest faculties. In the Nyingma tradition, highest yoga tantra is represented by mah›yoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga. Most of the esoteric instructions in this book fall into this category. 3 ring lugs: this really just means a lineage tradition, but is sometimes contrasted with a short lineage (nye brgyud) of direct visionary experience of teachings from a past master. 4 sgrub brgyud shing rta lam srol chen po brgyad: a system of classifi cation emphasized by Jamgön Kongtrul (1813-1900) and Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo (1820-1892).

The tantric texts translated from Sanskrit prior to the end of the tenth century and during the early spread of Buddhism in Tibet are known as the tantras of the early translation. This period is also known as “the early dissemination of the doctrine” (bstan pa snga dar), in contrast to the “later dissemination” (bstan pa phyi dar). 7 yo ga rnam gsum: These are the last three vehicles in the Nyingma traditional ninefold scheme (theg pa dgu). The fi rst three are the sutra vehicles of the Ÿr›vakas, pratyekabud-dhas, and bodhisattvas. The three vehicles of the outer tantras are kriy›yoga, upayoga or cary›yoga, and yogatantra. The three vehicles of the inner tantras are mah›yoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga, which correspond roughly to highest yoga tantra (bla med rgyud; Skt. anuttaratantra) in the fourfold system of the new traditions (see note 2 above). Tibetan texts generally keep the Sanskrit terms for the three yogas, although the TOK_8-4_Final.indd 370TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3707/10/09 1:59:09 PM7/10/09 1:59:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Tibetan equivalents are rnal ’byor chen po (“great yoga”), rjes su rnal ’byor (“yoga of passion”), and shin tu rnal ’byor (“extreme yoga”). The views, practices, and conduct of all the tantra sections, including the three yogas, are described in some detail in the sixth book of the Treasury of Knowledge (TOK 2: 736-66 or SBT, 301-57). This should be studied as background to the following description of the esoteric instructions. 8 Creation phase (bskyed rim) and completion phase (rdzogs rim) are the two main aspects in vajray›na practice of deity visualization and yogic meditation on the energetic body. Great completion (rdzogs chen) is the ultimate realization. The three of these can be said to encompass all mantra practice.

See The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism (NSH 1: 480-81). 10 The Beijing edition of the text (Text 1) has thabs srol gnyis (“two traditions of method”), but Khentse’s edition (Text 2) has thabs grol gnyis, which reading seems to be suggested by the commentary, and was also confi rmed by Gangteng Tulku Rinpoché (GTR). 11 rDo rje sems dpa’ sgyu ’phrul drwa ba, Skt.

There are eighteen principal tantras in the mah›yoga system: fi ve root tantras, fi ve of expression, fi ve concerning conduct, two that are like continu-ations, and one major tantra which is like the condensation of all the others. This last one is the Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva, the root text for all the mah›yoga tantras. The Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva itself consists of eight major texts and four explanatory tantras (TOK 2: 761; SBT, 350). It is thus of primary importance in mah›yoga and its depth and profundity have warranted much study over many centuries. For a complete list of all eighteen tantras plus subdivisions, see SBT, 518-9, nn. 2-4; Tulku Thondup, Masters of Meditation and Miracles, 360, n. 32; and Tulku Thondup, Buddha Mind, 30-1. 12 rgyud mah›yoga: The three inner tantras are often associated with three diff erent types of source texts, and appended with those names. Thus it is “tantra mah›yoga,” “elucidated” or “scriptural anuyoga” (lung anuyoga), and “esoteric instruction ati-yoga” (man ngag atiyoga). Mah›yoga is called tantra because it presents in their entirety the ten topics (dngos po bcu): the view, conduct, mandala, initiation, pledges, activation rituals, powers, contemplation, off erings, and mantras and mudras (SBT, 505, n. 22). 13 bShad rgyud rgya mtsho, or sGyu ’phrul rgya mtsho, “Oceanic Magical Manifestation” (TK-NGB, vol.

Again, it is the conduct of a yogin who has brought under control (brtul ) ordinary actions conditioned by passions and has adopted (zhugs) the special behavior intended for overcoming dualism. See BE, 243. 15 shes rab gsum: the wisdom or discernment of listening or studying (thos pa), of contemplation or refl ection (bsam pa), and of familiarization or meditation (sgom pa). These three lead to the experience of certainty. 16 This quotation is attributed to the Explanatory Tantra of the Oceanic Magical Mani-festation in NSH 1: 277. Upper and lower doors refer respectively to the higher chakras and the secret or sexual chakra of one’s own body or in that of one’s sexual partner in tantric practice. Also see Longchenpa, Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions, f. 453. 17 The six chakras or “channel-wheels” forming the upper door of one’s body (rang lus steng sgo ’khor lo drug) are energy centers situated within the meditator’s own body where the channels converge. They are (1) the sky chakra at the crown center (gtsug tor nam mkha’i ’khor lo); (2) the great bliss chakra at the head center (spyi bo bde chen gi ’khor lo); (3) the enjoyment chakra at the throat center (mgrin pa longs spyod kyi ’khor lo); (4) the dharma chakra at the heart center (snying ka chos kyi ’khor lo); (5) the emanation chakra at the navel center (lte ba sprul pa’i ’khor lo); and (6) the bliss-maintaining chakra at the secret center (gsang chen bde skyong gi ’khor lo) (NSH 2: 150). 18 rim gyis pa: a “gradualist.” This training of the “upper door” is for a person who is best suited for a gradual or step-by-step practice. The “lower door” is for an “instantaneous one” (cig car ba), a practitioner capable of attaining instant results. These categories are described below. 19 The “three life trees” (srog shing gsum) refers to the three channels (rtsa, Skt. n› ̃ı) in the energetic or subtle body through which the vital energies or “winds” (rlung, Skt. pr› ̊a) move. They are the central channel (dbu ma, Skt. avadhÒtı), the channel to the right of it (ro ma, Skt. rasan›), and that to the left (rkyang ma, Skt. lalan›). “Sky cow” (nam mkha’i ba) refers to the syllable ham that is visualized in the great bliss chakra in the head center in practices of inner heat (gtum mo, Skt. ca ̊ ̃›lı). Typi-cally, the fi re that is visualized as a letter in the navel center blazes up and causes the ham to secrete white seminal fl uid. Thus it is “milked.” The secretion drips down and causes the experience of bliss in the four lower chakras (GTR, personal communication, 7/24/03). Also see nn. 21, 22 and 30 below. 20 [dPal gsang ba] snying po’i rgyud; Skt.

Chapter thirteen referenced here is entitled “The Essential Extremely Secret Esoteric Instructions” (shin tu gsang ba man ngag gi snying po). 21 thig le, Skt. tilaka or bindu: According to Kongtrul (SBT, 181), “the term ‘vital essence’ denotes the essence or seed of great bliss.” It also can mean a drop or sphere. In teachings concerning the subtle or vajra body, it refers to the essence of the seminal drops, and is also called bodhicitta (“awakening mind”). Then it is specifi cally referring to the vital essence as substance (rdzas). 22 The vital essence, which is the seed of great bliss, is visualized in the shape of “seed syllables” (’bru yig) of the Tibetan alphabet in the various locations within the central channel of the vajra body. The practitioner concentrates on a diff erent chakra in each of these practices. These are basically the names of esoteric instructions with a minimal description. Kongtrul’s intentions are to survey the esoteric instructions, rather than provide enough material for actual practice, or even comprehension (!). 23 sGrol ma rlung gi man ngag: a branch commentary maybe found in the sNying ma rgyud ’bum (GTR). However, I have been unable to fi nd it there. 24 Bi ma’i gsang thig: not located under this name. It is probably a way of referring to the Bi ma’i snying thig cycle, with its commentary by Longchenpa, perhaps a variant title imbedded in some of the many small texts buried in the larger collection. 25 Zur pa mes dbon: Kongtrul identifi es the three forefathers or three generations of the Zur family lineage earlier in the Treasury as Zurpoché, “the Great Zur” (Lha rje Zur po che ⁄›kya ’byung gnas, tenth-eleventh c.), Zurchungpa, “Zur the Younger” (Zur chung Shes rab grags, 1014-1074), and Dropukpa, “Lord of Secrets” (gSang bdag sgro phug pa [⁄›kya seng ge], 1074-1135).

They are (1) approach (bsnyen pa), (2) close approach (nye bsnyen), (3) attainment (sgrub pa), and (4) great attainment (sgrub pa chen po). 28 brda bzhi: conventionally, the four symbols or signs are clarity, bliss, nonthought, and indivisibility, as mentioned later in this book. In the current subject of “encour-agement” (bskul ) in tantric sexual practice (Skt. karmamudr›), they refer to the exchanges of four phrases between male and female consorts. These are badzar samaya stom, badzar samaya ho, ragaya ham, and ragaya mi. See Dodrup Jigmé Ten-pai Nyima, Key to the Precious Treasury (mDzod kyi lde’u mig) in the NKG edition, Tibetan folio 38a.

Again thank you to Tulku Thondup Rinpoché for this. 30 The three perceptions (’du shes gsum), as explained by Kongtrul in Fully Spreading the Light of Wisdom (f. 395), his commentary to the treasure text The Wisdom Essence of Oral Instruction on the Stages of the Path (Zhal gdams lam rim ye shes snying po), are (1) both the yogin and his or her awareness consort visualize themselves as deities in union, (2) perform the mutual blessing of the space and secret as a vajra and lotus, and (3) have the same wish to accomplish the state of Vajrasattva, great bliss, for the benefi t of others by relying on this method. (Thanks to Elizabeth Callahan for fi nding this reference.) 31 dmar cha dkar cha: “red and white aspects,” or khams dkar dmar, “white and red constituents,” refers to the vital essence, conceived of as drops, that are particu-larly associated with the two procreative potentials in the sexual fl uids (khu rdul ). They are also code-named “bodhicitta” (byang sems) or “awakening mind.” The red aspect, or essence of female ovum (khrag), is inherited from the mother at conception, and the white aspect or essence of sperm (khu ba) is inherited from the father. They merged at the time of sexual intercourse to form the physical basis for the consciousness of the intermediate being conceived in them at conception. Throughout fetal development, these essences remain at the navel, the energy-center from where the body develops. At birth, they separate; the white settles at the head, and the red, four fi ngers below the navel. These are the original vital essences, representing method (great bliss) and wisdom (emptiness), respectively. They always remain at those physical places as supports for life, until death dis-rupts them. In yogic practice such as this, it is the sub-product of the original that moves. 32 dga’ bzhi’i rim ’grod: as the stream of white vital essence from the upper part of the head falls through the chakras in the central channel, the practitioner has an experi-ence called “joy” (dga’ ba) at each occurrence. These four experiences are named initial joy (dang po’i dga’ ba), supreme joy (mchog dga’), special joy (khyad dga’), and coemergent joy (lhan cig skyes pa’i dga’ ba). This is called the “four joys in order,” meaning in descent, as opposed to in reverse, as follows (see note 33). 33 mas brtan pa’i dga’ bzhi: the four joys experienced in reverse as the bodhicitta rises up again during this practice. It is a realization that occurs in the practice of inner heat, from the teachings of the completion phase of the mother tantras of highest yoga. If the bodhicitta is stabilized, it ascends in reverse up from the tip of the penis through the four chakras of the navel, heart, throat, and head, generating four joys (BD). 34 pha [rol tu] phyin [pa] bcu: the ten spiritual perfections or transcendent practices (Skt. p›ramit›) are the more common set of six: (1) generosity (sbyin pa), (2) moral-ity (tshul khrims), (3) patience (bzod pa), (4) diligence (brtson ’grus), (5) meditation (bsam gtan), and (6) wisdom (shes rab), plus the additional four: (7) method (thabs), (8) power (stobs), (9) aspiration (smon lam), and (10) pristine awareness (ye shes).

Kongtrul does not elaborate on this “instantaneous enlightenment” (cig car ba), associated with the Chinese Ch’an tradi-tion of Hva-shang and supposedly expelled in the eighth century. 39 rig ’dzin bzhi: an awareness-holder (rig pa ’dzin pa or sometimes rigs pa ’dzin pa, Skt. vidy›dhara) is a realized being of high attainment, the result of practice in the vajray›na. Kongtrul defi nes the word as follows: “‘Awareness’ (rig pa) means the pristine awareness of great bliss of supreme subject-object nondualism. ‘Hold’ (’dzin pa) means a way of re-illuminating that very thing that was there all along” (TOK 2: 135-6). According to the Nyingma tradition, there are four higher levels of awareness-holders corresponding to the ten or eleven stages of the bodhisattva path. They are (1) the awareness-holder who is ripening [or “with corporal residue”] (rnam smin rig ’dzin), (2) the awareness-holder with control over life span (tshe dbang rig ’dzin), (3) the awareness-holder of the great seal or mah›mudr› (phyag rgya chen po rig ’dzin), and (4) the awareness-holder of spontaneous presence (lhun gyis grub pa rig ’dzin). 40 gtan tshigs, Skt. hetu: defi ned as “a section or verse of lines that ascertain the mean-ing” (don gtan la ’bebs byed kyi tshig phreng gi tshigs sam dum bu ste) (BD 1: 1036). Also “proof,” “reasoning,” etc. 41 (1) sngon byung dngos lnga’i gtan tshigs, (2) rjes ’jug tshul lnga’i gtan tshigs, (3) tshig lnga’i gtan tshigs. These are not the usual logical reasonings but particular to the mah›yoga system. Dudjom Rinpoche says, “The abiding nature of the continuum of the ground is established as the view which is to be realized, but it is not estab-lished by the ostensible reasoning of sophistry. Rather it is established by the three kinds of all-embracing valid cognition and should be realized by the direct percep-tion of intrinsic awareness” (NSH 1: 275). Note that these are diff erent than the four sets of axioms in the mah›yoga section of book six in this Treasury (TOK 2: 739-43; SBT, 317-21 and 508, n. 29).

Dharmak›ya Teacher spoke the meaning of the unborn to Wisdom Ocean. Sa ̇bhogak›ya spoke the enlightened perspective symbols to Ripening Ocean. Nirm› ̊ak›ya spoke the expres-sive words to Devotion Ocean. Vajrak›ya spoke the vajra to Indivisible Vajra. Abhisa ̇bodhik›ya spoke the blessing of intrinsic awareness to Vic-tor Ocean. By these [fi ve] speeches the communication was made. (2) The fi ve manners are that for the highest of the sharp faculties, all appearing and resounding entities reveal the continuum meaning in a man-ner consistent with the speech of the previously occurring fi ve k›yas. In sequence, then, the axioms that are consistent with the speeches of the Teacher as dharmak›ya, sa ̇bhogak›ya, abhisa ̇bodhik›ya, vajrak›ya, and nirm› ̊ak›ya are (a) the axiom of the meaning of the unborn is the illustration of the unborn, like the sky. (b) The axiom of the enlightened perspective symbols is the identifi cation of obscuration, like the refl ected form in a mirror. (c) The axiom of actual clarity of refl exive awareness is nonconceptual inherent clarity, like the heart of the sun. (d) The axiom of indivisible vajra is the inseparability of sound and emptiness, like an echo. (e) The axiom of the expressive words is that all minds engage with it, like Brahma’s voice. These are similar to when former great masters experienced all phenomena as the guru and scripture. (3) The fi ve words are the actual expressive words that teach those fi ve manners. The words that teach the inherent appearance of the unborn are words of dharmak›ya. The symbolic words of the concealed intention are the words of the sa ̇bhogak›ya. The words that teach the indivisible vajra-like nature are the words of the vajrak›ya. The words and letters that teach the inherent appearance of pristine awareness are the nirm› ̊ak›ya words. 42 For example, the practices commemorating Padmasambhava done on the tenth lunar day or of the ̃›kinıs done on the twenty-fi fth day fulfi ll all these parts in a single session (NSH 2: 24, n. 351). 43 Lam [rim] chung [ba] or sGyu ’phrul drwa ba’i lam rnam par bshad pa chung ngu by Buddhaguhya (DZ, vol. 1; NKG, vol. 23).

In this way there are fi ve stages.” These stages are refi ned by the three absorptions of creation phase, as described below (GTR). 46 phyag rgya gcig spros bcas tshom bu tshogs sgrub: the single mudra is a deity on its own. The elaborate mudra is a more complex visualization of a single deity. The mandala clusters or gathered-assembly mudra is a group of deities. See also SBT, 507, nn. 20-22. 47 thim rim: these are the appearances of the signs of death—the dissolution of the physical elements and the arising of the three lights or appearances: light, increase, and attainment. 48 chos sku (Skt. dharmak›ya): the body or dimension of reality or truth. This term is equivalent to the ultimate reality and refers to the all-pervasive, inconceivable dimension of the awakened state. 49 bag chags (Skt. v›san›): trace; propensity; latency; or habitual patterns—the residual eff ects of karmic actions that remain as part of the consciousness until conditions cause them to manifest. This is the basic function enabling the experience of karmic results. 50 ting nge ’dzin gsum: these three meditative absorptions or sam›dhi are the fi rst phases of visualization practice. The practices correspond to the experiences of death, intermediate state, and conception respectively, and therefore can purify or recreate those experiences. The absorption of suchness (de bzhin nyid kyi ting nge ’dzin) in emptiness, associated with wisdom, is to remain in meditative equanimity, free from concepts, in an all-pervasive state like space. All-arising or “total vision” absorption (kun nas snang ba’i ting nge ’dzin) is the arising of impartial compassion, associated with methods, like a magical illusion, directed toward all beings who lack understanding of reality. The union of these two (as wisdom and method) produces the absorption of the cause (rgyu’i ting nge ’dzin), the coarse and subtle symbols, consisting of the visualization of a seed syllable, which is the essence of intrinsic awareness (rig pa) and the seed of the deity to be visualized. See Kongtrul’s Sunlight (f. 12a), or Creation and Completion (38). 51 These are sequences of visualization practice corresponding to the experiences of birth in diff erent manners.

Here, what I am calling “the fi ve dissipating paths” are (as described in the immediately preced-ing section on the objects of meditation) great emptiness as the path corresponding to the luminous clarity [at the moment of] death; great compassion as the path cor-responding to the intermediate state; and single mudra, elaborate mudra, and the practice of the assembly clusters corresponding to the three stages (rim pa) of birth. In the traditional fi ve paths, the fi rst two (accumulation and application) are said to be dissipating or defi led (zag bcas) while the last three beginning with the path of seeing are nondissipating or undefi led (zag med). In any case, the main point here is that the fi ve practices, although technically associated with the fi rst two paths that are dissipating, lay the foundation for the higher three nondissipating paths.

Then, that will produce the result of the path of no more training (mi slob pa’i lam), another name for the path of consummation. However, there do exist two divisions within the path of seeing which might be the reference here. They are (1) the path of no obstacles (bar chad med pa’i lam), in which the object to be abandoned and the antidote are still in some confl ict, and (2) the path of total liberation (rnam grol lam), when that is overcome and one is about to pass over to the path of training (ATG, 9/27/05). 74 yas brtan dang mas brtan gyi ye shes: the pristine awarenesses that arise concurrent with the experiences of joy as the bodhicitta descends and ascends through the chakras.

Since the teachings referred to here are seen as a prerequisite for the vajray›na, it is a shared or common teaching. 11 kun gzhi (Skt. ›laya): literally the ground or foundation (gzhi ) of everything (kun). According to mahayana, it is the substratum or indeterminate level of the mind where karmic imprints are stored. The “causal continuum” (rgyu’i rgyud) is the original ground of being to be recognized as enlightenment itself. In this context, the two words are being used as equivalent. 12 dbang bzhi: the four empowerments or initiations of highest yoga tantra are the vase empowerment (bum pa’i dbang), the secret empowerment (gsang ba’i dbang), the pristine awareness through wisdom empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang) and the fourth or word empowerment (bzhi pa’i tshig gi dbang). For extensive discussion see TOK 2: 656-82 or SBT, 217-37. 13 sku (Skt. k›ya): the buddha bodies or dimensions of the state of total awakening. They are categorized as two, three, four, or fi ve. When fi ve are mentioned, they are the body of reality (chos sku, Skt. dharmak›ya), body of perfect enjoyment (longs spyod rdzogs pa’i sku, Skt. sa ̇bhogak›ya), emanation body (sprul pa’i ku, Skt. nirm› ̊ak›ya), immutable vajra body (rdo rje’i sku, Skt. vajrak›ya) and the essence body (ngo bo nyid sku, Skt. svabh›vikak›ya). In the Nyingma tantras, the list of fi ve in the fruitional dharmas includes the body of complete enlightenment (mngon par byang chub pa’i sku, Skt. abhisa ̇bodhik›ya) in place of the essence body. The fi ve pristine awarenesses (ye shes lnga, Skt. pañcajñ›na) are the awareness of the expanse of reality (chos dbyings kyi ye shes, Skt. dharmadh›tujñ›na), mirror-like awareness (me long gi ye shes, Skt. ›darŸajñ›na), discriminating awareness (so sor rtog pa’i ye shes, Skt. pratyavek ̋a ̊›jñ›na), awareness of equality (mnyam nyid kyi ye shes, Skt. samat›jñ›na) and awareness of accomplishment (bya ba grub pa’i ye shes, Skt. k ̧ty›nu ̋ ̨h›najñ›na). 14 From Entrance to Tantra (rGyud la ’jug pa) by Garvarıpa (Garbha ri pa), according to Gorampa (CS).

Ga, f. 104a1-2 (where the last line is diff erent). It is included in the Hevajra Tantra Trilogy (see note 2), and is one of the thirty-six root tantras found in IndrabhÒti’s commentary. It is a shared or common (thun mong ba) explanatory tantra, and although some lamas consider it an explanatory tantra of the Hevajra, Buton (Bu ston, 1290-1364) and others consider it an explanatory tantra of many tantras, particularly of Sa ̇vara. Kongtrül considers the Sampu ̨a to be an explana-tory tantra shared by both the Cakrasa ̇vara and the Hevajra systems (EMC). 18 According to Dezhung Rinpoche, the four authentic qualities (tshad ma bzhi ) are that of the teacher, of direct experience, of the scripture (Hevajra Tantra), and of the treatise, i.e., theVajra Lines (The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception, xxxiii). 19 From Drakpa Gyaltsen’s auto-commentary to Rin chen snang ba called Commentary on the View of Samsara-Nirvana Inseparable (’Khor ’das dbyer med kyi lta ba’i ’grel pa), in The Yellow Volume (Pod ser), 203. 20 rigs drug: this refers to the causes and the actual experiences of birth in the realms of gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings. 21 gzhung bshad: a term for the commentaries on VirÒpa’s Vajra Lines (CS). 22 sarga: (legs) le’u’am rab byed, but in the Lamdré itself, the term sarga is explained as sequence or order (go rim), etc. (CS). 23 khams, Skt. dh›tu, a word with many uses, here refers to the vital energy. Gathering the constituents (khams ’dus pa) of vital energy refers to yogic energetic practices. Wherever visualization is focused, the vital energy gathers there. Through this kind of practice, the vital energy currents are said to gather and then enter, dwell, and fi nally dissolve in the particular chakra upon which one is focused. In ultimate yogic practice the energies enter and dissolve into the central channel, discursive thought is arrested, and the experience of nonconceptual bliss-emptiness occurs. 24 rtsa’i yi ge’i pho brang: In the Lamdré teachings, “channel syllables” (rtsa yig) refers to crooked channels that have the approximate shape of syllables. The energy cur-rents (rlung) and bodhicitta (byang sems), or “energy-mind,” which are also referred to as elixir (bdud rtsi ), gather in these rtsa yig as a result of certain practices. Since the ̃›kas and ̃›kinıs (which are actually another term for bodhicitta and energy currents) gather in these key locations, the rtsa yig are referred to as “palaces” (pho brang) of the ̃›kas and ̃›kinıs (CS). 25 ’gros bzhi: The four empowerments (dbang) in sequence bring about the dissolution of these four in sequence: (1) channels (rtsa), (2) letters (yi ge), (3) elixir constituents (khams bdud rtsi ), and (4) energy currents (rlung). ’Gros is the pulsation of these four into and out of the three channels (’jug ldog), whereas dissolution (thim) is when they have entered into the central channel and never exit again (CS). The thirteenth level (sa bcu gsum pa) is the ultimate state of buddhahood. Three additional levels (sa, Skt. bhÒmi ) were added later to the traditional ten spiritual levels that map the path to enlightenment to refl ect the increase of qualities. In the Lamdré tradition, they are the eleventh level of incomparable pristine wisdom (dpe notes to pages 120 to 124 \u0003 391TOK_8-4_Final.indd 391TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3917/10/09 1:59:10 PM7/10/09 1:59:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"392 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgemed ye shes), the twelfth level of great pristine awareness (ye shes chen po), and the thirteenth level of the vajra holder (rdo rje ’dzin pa).

The vital essence originally in the chakras and channels and the vital essence that has expanded and moved into the channels due to meditations blend together (CS). 28 drod: literally “warmth” or “heat,” generally refers to a level of profi ciency in which one is “warming up” or attaining an increasing degree of experiential realization. It also refers specifi cally to the fi rst of four stages in the path of application (sbyor lam). When it refers to the practices of inner heat, as in the third case here, then the meaning is quite literal. 29 khams dgu: the nine or often ten essential constituents. Five of the essential con-stituents are the fi ve vital energy currents of earth, water, fi re, wind, and space, which are also referred to as the fi ve ̃›kinıs. The essential physical constituents of feces, urine, blood, reproductive fl uid, and fl esh are also referred to as the fi ve elixirs, or as the ̃›kas or the enlightened bodies of the tath›gatas. Sometimes the vital energy current of space is considered to be all-pervasive, and so the reference is to just nine essential constituents (CS). 30 byung rgyal: this means not to examine or scrutinize whatever or however much occurs (gang byung mang byung ste ma brtags pa). 31 The mind (sems) riding on the vital energy (rlung) moves through the channels (rtsa) of the subtle, energetic body. According to the esoteric instruction tradition of the Hevajra tantra (i.e., lam ’bras), the thirty-two knots (bdud pa) are arranged in twelve groups, corresponding to the twelve spiritual levels. The fi rst and last of these twelve locations have one knot, and the ten in between have three knots each, making a total of thirty-two. When these knots are released as a result of the vari-ous practices, the yogin experiences the realization of the respective spiritual levels. The “constrictions” (dog sa) are in the channels, in this case corresponding to the thirty-two knots (CS). 32 sad pa bzhi: (1) testing by means of experiences, (2) testing by means of meditative absorption, (3) testing by means of mantra, and (4) testing by means of the view and [culmination of] accomplishment (nyams kyis sad, ting nge ’dzin gyis sad, sngags kyis sad, lta grub kyis sad).

When Ronyam Dorjé was on his way to India to study the Guhyasam›ja Tantra, he met two Indians coming to Tibet to study it with Marpa, so he returned with them to Tibet. However, Marpa had died by this time, so he received the instructions from Tsurtön Wang-ngé. Ronyam Dorjé wrote the Guhyasam›ja Commentary (’Dus pa’i ’grel pa) quoted later in this section (TOK 3: 356), and also mentioned in BA, 418. 9 snang ba gsum: the three lights or three “appearances” or “experiences” in progressive or arising order are light (snang ba), increase of the light (snang ba mched pa), and culmination of light (snang ba thob pa). When the true nature of mind as luminous emptiness is not recognized, it shifts to three coarser phases of appearance in reverse order: culmination, increase, and light. Alternative designations for the three lights are great empty (stong pa chen po), very empty (shin tu stong pa), and empty (stong pa).

The rest of this section may be found verbatim in the Commentary to the Prayer of Mah›mudr› (Nges don phyag rgya chen po’i smon lam gyi ’grel pa grub pa mchog gi zhal lung) by the eighth Tai Situ (ff . 16-17), including the missing line from the Hevajra Tantra (see note 17). This would lead one to believe either that Kongtrul borrowed it from Tai Situ’s commentary, or that both of them were relying on the same third source. 16 btsun mo’i bhaga: btsun mo can be “queen,” “princess,” or “lady,” but in this context refers to Vajrayoginı (RT, personal communication, 10/14/03). The text retains the Sanskrit word bhaga, which has very many referents but seems to have been used in Tibetan translations and commentaries primarily for the vagina. 17 bde ba med na de med ’gyur: this line from the Hevajra Tantra (Toh. 418) is missing here. 18 In the Hevajra Tantra it reads, “therefore it is not the thing [or being] of buddhas” (de phyir sangs rgyas ngos po min, rather than de nyid sangs rgyas ngos po min). 19 In the Hevajra Tantra it reads, “sublime bliss is formless” (mchog du bde ba gzugs med pa rather than mchog tu mi ’gyur bde ba’i gzugs). 20 Relative awakening mind or bodhicitta here is referring to the vital essence (thig le) within the channels of the subtle body. The quintessence or pure refi ned extract (dwang ma) of that is the seminal fl uid (khu ba). 21 Rangjung Dorjé (Rang byung rdo rje, 1284–1339), the third Karmapa, was one of the greatest masters of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, a student of Orgyenpa (Grub chen U rgyan Rin chen dpal, 1230–1309/1312) and Kum›rar›ja (1266-1343). The activities of Rangjung Dorjé were extremely widespread. He founded many mon-asteries and composed some of the most important texts of theory and practice in the Kagyu tradition.notes to pages 145 to 148 \u0003 395TOK_8-4_Final.indd 395TOK_8-4_Final.indd 3957/10/09 1:59:10 PM7/10/09 1:59:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"396 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge 22 sems kyi snang ba: an alternate translation would be “radiance of mind.” 23 Chödrak Gyatso (Chos grags rgya mtsho, 1454–1506), the seventh Karmapa patri-arch.

Mah›y›nottaratantraŸ›stra) (Toh. 4024). 26 In some systems highest yoga tantra is divided into the three categories of father (pha rgyud), mother (ma rgyud), and nondual tantras (gnyis med rgyud), although the categories are not universal. Here, Guhyasam›ja (gSang ba ’dus pa, “The Secret Assembly Tantra”) is the father tantra and the mother is Mah›m›y› (sGyu ma chen po, “Great Illusion,” but usually the Sanskrit is retained). Hevajra (Kye’i rdo rje) and Cakrasa ̇vara (’Khor lo sdom pa) are called the essence or “heart” (snying po) and the quintessence (yang snying), and are also mother tantras.

Due to the force of dualistic attachment from not recognizing the innate nature of those three, the six collections of consciousness become unclear and withdraw into the universal ground, which is the state of deep sleep. From that, the mental consciousness and its formations emerge as the state of dreaming.

Because of this close association, the two are inseparable in practice and the two terms are used as one. Sems in this case also refers to byangs sems or bodhicitta in Sanskrit as an energy-substance that moves through the subtle body, equivalent to vital essence (thig le, Skt. bindu). 55 stong pa bzhi: four levels or degrees of emptiness; the luminous clarity of the four empties: “empty” (stong pa), “great empty” (stong pa chen po), “very empty” (shin tu stong pa), and “all empty” (thams cad stong pa). In this case, it is the four empties of luminous clarity: light, increase, culmination, and full culmination (luminous clar-ity itself). Once one has attained the four lights, then gradually emptiness dissolves into luminous clarity and from within the state of luminous clarity just energy current with mind arises as the deity’s form (KTGR, “Tibetan Transcripts,” 10). 56 “The three lights in reverse order (lugs ldog gi snang gsum) refer to the emergence from luminosity. There are three lights that arise as one moves toward luminosity (i.e., light, increase, and attainment). They arise in reverse order as one emerges from luminosity (i.e. attainment, increase, light.) The reverse three lights and the pristine awareness pr› ̊a are the matrix from which the practitioner arises in pure form that is like an illusion, which is the actual illusory form” (KTGR, The Six Dharmas of N›ropa, 123). “Consciousness dissolves into light, light dissolves into increase, increase dissolves into culmination, culmination dissolves into luminous clarity, into pristine awareness emptiness... from within the state of empty lumi-nous clarity, together with the pristine awareness energy currents, the illusion-like deity’s body manifests” (KTGR, “Tibetan Transcripts,” 12). 57 rnam shes gsum: the consciousness of the three lights, namely, light, increase, and culmination. The three consciousnesses are of light, increase, and culmina-tion that ultimately seem to dissolve into emptiness. The state of three conscious-nesses becomes the totally pure three emptinesses and everything is empty.

There are many teachings in vajray›na describ-ing the pre-and post-natal development of the human body, which is seen on two levels of coarse and subtle at the same time. The subtle body and its intimate relationship with the mind forms the context of all completion stage practices and is considered the actual ground for enlightenment, so it is thought important to understand it. For Kongtrul’s descriptions, see TOK 2: 631-44 (SBT, 169-84) and, more extensively, CPR, ff . 32-107. 96 Motility (also translated as “passion” or “creativity”) (rdul, Skt. rajas); darkness (or “immobility”) (mun pa, Skt. tamas); and buoyancy (or “lightness” or “clarity”) (snying stobs, Skt. sattva) are three qualities (yon tan, Skt. gu ̊a) borrowed from the ancient Hindu S› ̇khya school. According to that school, they are the three main constituents of the universal or primal substance or “nature” (rang bzhin, Skt. prak ̧ti ) that evolve into all categories of existence. Furthermore, lightness is associated with the white constituent and motility with the red. Here, however, they are all ascribed to the red aspect, and can be associated with desire, hatred, and stupidity (KTGR). See CPR, f. 85b. 97 dga’ ba bzhi gsum bcu gnyis (bzhi is mistakenly omitted in text 2, RT). This is four chakras plus the three joys of desire, hatred, and stupidity being perfectly pure (KTGR). 98 gnad bcings pa: I have preferred gnad here as in text 2, vol. 4: 42, over the gnas in text 1. As Kongtrul explains, “A special feature of the vajray›na is that the such-ness of mind—the supported—is made manifest by binding the functions of the body—the support” (CPR, f. 32b). Binding the vital points of the body refers to yogic methods where one focuses intently on particular points of the body, such as the chakras or the vital essence within, to bring about specifi c experiences and ultimately the actualization of pristine awareness. Binding the vital points or vital essence counteracts the habitual tendency for the emission of the white and red constituents (khams dkar dmar ’pho ba’i bag chags), which is the cause of cyclic existence. 99 ’Jam dpal zhal lung, Skt.

There are ten main energy currents or “winds” (rlung) in the subtle body. The life-force or vital (srog ’dzin) energy current is the source of all ten energy currents, and is present in all parts of the body, but is based in the central channel, upon which all channels depend, and lies right in the center of the body. It is connected to and supports the universal ground. During life, this energy current generates the conception of self and all conceptual constructs and is known as the affl icted mind. The downward-clearing (thur du sel ba) energy current dwells below the navel where the three main chan-nels meet and fl ows downward. Its function is to regulate the voiding or withhold-ing of refi ned and residual constituents such as feces, urine, semen, and blood. See CPR, ff . 68b-70a. 107 Dus ’khor [bsdus rgyud], Skt.

There he says, “When the energy current dissolves in the heart center and only energy-mind arises from special emp-tiness as the deity, it is the real illusory body. When just the energy current dissolves normally (rang gar) and only energy-mind arises as the deity, it is posited as the concordant illusory body. The way this illusory body is illustrated by the twelve examples is the same as [described] before. [In the Five Stages] N›g›rjuna states: ‘A refl ection in the mirror should be known as an illusory body. The colors are like a rainbow. It pervades like a water moon.’ The form is instantly complete, like one’s refl ection in the mirror. The colors are clear and unmixed, like a rainbow. A single one pervades everywhere, like the moon’s refl ections in water. These are the three examples that illustrate [illusory body]” (TOK 3: 265-6). 129 dben pa gsum: isolation of body, of speech, and of mind. See the “Practice” part of the following section. 130 “Union” is translating zung du ’jug pa, which literally means “entering into a pair.” In this instance, it refers to the union of pure illusory body and actual luminous clarity, the highest freedom and realization. One part (ya gyal ) of this is the illusory body aspect. 131 bdag (or rang) byin gyis brlab pa, Skt. svadhi ̋ ̨h›na, is an aspect of the phase of completion. As mentioned, there are many explanations. In describing it as one of three main aspects of the causal phase of completion (with mandala circle and mah›mudr›), Kongtrul states that whether or not one is meditating on the actual central channel, it is the meditation where one visualizes usually either fi re or vital essence drops or letters, etc., in the central channel, because wherever one focuses the mind, the energy currents will gather there (TOK 2: 686; SBT, 243-4). In this case, based on the Guhyasam›ja Tantra, self-blessing is equivalent to the third of the fi ve stages, the stage of illusory body. Also see note 139. 132 stong gzugs is short for stong pa nyid kyi gzugs bsnyan, an image or refl ection of emptiness. These perceptions are not empty of something; they are the form of emptiness.

In general it is a name for breathing practices associated with visualized syllables. There are many types of vajra repetition, but the general designation is of a way to practice mantra silently rather than an actual recitation. Here it is the stage of speech isola-tion (ngag dben) in the fi ve-stage format of the completion phase in the Guhyasam›ja Tantra (see note 139). In this, the principal energy currents, especially that of the life-force (srog), are made to enter, abide in, and dissolve in the central channel. Essentially it is a practice to purify the energy currents. 136 rlung bum pa can: a technique of breath retention that holds the upper and lower energy currents in the abdomen, like in a vase. Here it is the way to practice vajra repetition in the isolation of speech. 137 I was not able to fi nd information on these special practices. 138 The fi ve stages in the Guhyasam›ja Tantra are (1) speech isolation (ngag dben) or vajra repetition (rdo rje’i bzlas pa); (2) mind isolation (sems dben); (3) illusory body (sgyu lus) or self-blessing (bdag byin rlabs); (4) luminous clarity (’od gsal ); and (5) union (zung ’jug).

If it does not separate, it is limited by the physical body (KTGR). 144 nying ’khrul: delusion on top of delusion, or double delusion.

This text is often quoted as a source for extrinsic emptiness (gzhan stong) philosophy, for example in the Mahayana Highest Continuum. 180 sPyod bsdud [pa’i sgron me], Skt. Cary›mel›pakapradıpa, by firyadeva (Toh. 1803), f. 80b5-7. 181 theg dman gyi bstan bcos mdzod: The original Abhidharmapi ̨aka (“Basket of Higher Knowledge” or “Phenomenology”) of the Sarv›stiv›din canon consisted of seven trea-tises (bstan bcos, Skt. Ÿ›stra), of which only one can be found in Tibetan transla-tion. However, Vasubandhu’s Abhidharma Treasury (Chos mngon pa’i mdzod, Skt. Abhidharmako ̋ak›rik›, Toh. 4089) is believed to summarize all these texts. 182 The luminous clarity that one is practicing in the six dharmas and other completion phase practices is called luminous clarity of the path (lam) or of the child (bu), in relationship to the inherent and primordial luminous clarity of the ground (gzhi ), which is called the “mother” (ma). When, through cultivating the path, the ground luminous clarity is recognized and integrated, it is called mother and child meeting (ma bu ’phrad pa) or mother and child uniting (ma bu sbyor ba). 183 “Sun and moon” refers to the right and left channels, and “r›hula” to the central channel. When the energy currents move through the right and left channels, they are considered deluded or dualistic, but when they are brought into the central channel, dualistic conceptions dissolve. 184 khams drug ldan: these are the elements of earth (sa), water (chu), fi re (me), wind (rlung), space (nam mkha’), and consciousness (rnam shes) or pristine awareness (ye shes). Having these six constituents, a being is fi t to be a buddha. 185 It is taught that the orifi ce through which the consciousness departs is determined by the realm into which the being will be born, which of course depends on its karma. The nine orifi ces through which the consciousness can transfer (rnam shes ’pho ba’i bu ga dgu) are the crown aperture (tshangs bug), the point between the eye-brows (smin mtshams), the eyes (mig), the ears (rna ba), the nose (sna), the mouth (kha), the navel (lte ba), the urinary tract opening (chu lam), and the anus (bshang lam). 186 ’jigs pa’i sgra bzhi: the expression of the four energy currents, they are the roar of collapsing mountains, the sound of blazing forests, the crashing of tumultuous seas, and the shrieking of a gale like the winds at the end of time (Kangyur Rinpoche, Treasury of Precious Qualities, 280-1). 187 ya nga’i g.yang sa gsum: the embodiment of hatred, desire, and confusion, the three chasmic precipices are white as ash, dark red, and black (ibid., 281). 188 nges pa’i rtags drug: the usual list, however, is of fi ve defi nite signs that one is in the intermediate state of existence: (1) one leaves no footprints, shadow or sounds from the body, (2) one can move unimpeded through matter, (3) one has miraculous power, (4) one’s voice is not heard by relatives, and (5) one cannot see the sun or notes to pages 190 to 199 \u0003 411TOK_8-4_Final.indd 411TOK_8-4_Final.indd 4117/10/09 1:59:11 PM7/10/09 1:59:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"412 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgemoon (because there is no inner sun and moon of bodhicitta).

However, because of the near contemporary dates with Kongtrul, I am inclined to think this refers to the Oral Teachings of MañjuŸrı (’Jam dpal zhal lung, Skt. MañjuŸrımukh›gama, Toh. 1853), which has been quoted several times earlier. 190 ming bzhi ’khyams po: the four names refer to the four non-form aggregates (Skt. skandha) of feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. 191 dri za: interpreted here as a descriptive activity, the intermediate state being or disembodied consciousness is traditionally called a “smell-eater” (Skt. gandharva), which is also the name for spirits who take sustenance from odors. 192 rnam byang ’od kyi lam lnga: that is, of perfection or enlightenment, the total purity from obscuration. 193 Thabs lam tshigs bcad ma by Dorjé Gyalpo (rDo rje rgyal po, 1110-1170). 194 Zhal lung: probably ’Jam dpal zhal lung, Skt.

They are mental syllables because they are not actually recited. 198 That is, at the actual time of death. Continuing to practice transference after one has successfully generated the signs of accomplishing it is said to shorten one’s life and possibly result in accidental suicide. 199 skye med kyi yig ’bru: the stainless white “a” (KTGR). 200 dgu gsum in both texts should be dus gsum (KTGR). 201 dbyangs gsal phyed dang gsum pa’i sbyor ba: This passage is quite obscure and I am unable to fi nd textual reference to it. dbyangs gsal means vowel and consonant, and usually refers to the vowels and consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet.

There are dif-ferences in the second and fourth lines of the song as presented here. In Marpa’s biography, line 2 reads “the sacred object is the qualifi ed body of another” (gzhan lus mtshan ldan dam pa’i yul instead of gzhan ldan yul gyi gnad) and line 4 reads “through contingency of energy current chakras” (rten ’brel rlung gi ’khor lo yis instead of thig le rlung sems ’khrul ’khor gyis). See Tsang Nyön Heruka, The Life of Marpa the Translator, 95-7. 205 lhan cig skyes pa (Skt. sahaja) means literally “occurring together since the beginning” (thog ma nas mnyam por byung ba). It is translated as “coemergent” or “connate” and, by extension, “innate,” “inherent,” or “natural” (sahaja was also sometimes translated as rang bzhin gyis in Tibetan). Lhan cig skyes sbyor can be translated as “joined coemergence.” On this term, Kongtrul quotes Gampopa: “The triad of mind, concepts, and dharmak›ya fi rst emerged together. Since the instructions join them in one, shouldn’t one say ‘joined coemergence’?” (sems dang rnam rtog chos sku gsum/ dang por lhan cig skyes pa ste/ gdams pas gcig tu sbyor ba’i phyir/ lhan cig skyes sbyor mi zer ram/) (DZ, vol. 18, f. 431). 206 Reading dbang las skyes pa’i for ba las skyes pa’i (TOK 3: 375), as it appears in the same exact description of sutra and mantra mah›mudr› in Kongtrul’s Catalogue (DZ, vol. 18, f. 430). 207 Dwags po rin po che (“Precious One from Dakpo”) is Gampopa (sGam po pa bSod nam rin chen, 1079-1154).

He became a monk at VikramaŸıla Monastery, where he received the ordination name of Maitrıpagupta and studied with ⁄›ntipa and others. He was evicted from the monastery on the grounds of having been seen drinking beer in the company of a woman. Later he became a student of the peer-less yogin ⁄avari (TOK 2: 527).

Before his time, the yoga tantras and highest yoga tantras were known only through mystic visions beheld by a few adepts, and these did not endure. After Saraha, these tantras spread far and wide and their transmissions continued without interruption. For this reason, he is acknowledged to be the fi rst known pioneer of the tantras and the forefather of tantric adepts. He is an important source for the transmission of mah›mudr› in the Kagyu lineage. 210 De kho na nyid bcu pa, Skt.

The monastery originally followed the Sakya tradition, but during the time of the Omniscient Dolpopa (Kun mkhyen Dol po pa, 1292–1361) it became the seat of an independent tradition, the Jonangpa, where the renowned extrinsic emptiness (gzhan stong) philosophy devel-oped. T›ran›tha was considered an incarnation of Kunga Drolchok (Kun dga’ grol mchog, 1507-1565/6), another great master of the Jonang school, and Kongtrul regarded himself as an incarnation in this line. T›ran›tha, like Kongtrul, practiced and taught a wide variety of tantric teachings from diff erent lineages, and was unbiased (ris med) in his approach to realization, although the same might not be said for those who opposed him.

Also see Chapter 5 of this book. 244 The three appearances (snang ba gsum) are explained in the Path with Its Fruition (lam ’bras) teachings (see Chapter 3 in this book). They are impure appearance (ma dag pa’i snang ba), the appearances of yogic experience (rnal ’byor nyams kyi snang ba), and the pure appearance (dag pa’i snang ba). Impure appearances describe the stage of things as they are known in the world when there is no analysis of the nature of genuine reality. Appearances experienced by yogins describe the stage where appearances are experienced as illusory, at the stage of some analysis into the nature of genuine reality. Completely pure appearances describe the stage where appearances are realized to be of the nature of space, at the level of thorough analy-sis into the nature of genuine reality. The three appearances form a sutra explana-tion that is in harmony with vajray›na teachings, and therefore Lord Jonangpa compares them to the sutra mah›mudr› tradition (KTGR). 245 sGyu ma’i brtag pa’i le’u gnyis pa, from the Hevajra Tantra, Part Two, Chapter 2, verse 34ab. rnal ’byor gyis should read rnal ’byor ’dis (EMC). 246 rngul tsam should be rdul tsam, meaning “many” (TR). 247 Ye shes grub pa, Skt.

During practice on the path, the fi ve special after-eff ects (lag rjes) are (1) meditation on relative awakening mind produces realization of ultimate awakening mind, (2) meditation on the yidam exhausts ordinary appearance and leads to meeting the pure deity, (3) meditation on the exemplary guru leads to realization of the ultimate guru, (4) meditation on mah›mudr› divests one of hope and fear about samsara or nirvana so that one can realize mah›mudr›, and (5) dedication accomplishes the welfare of oneself and others without eff ort. The fi ve practices pacify the fi ve nega-tive spirits (gdon), respectively: the male negative spirit that is the cause of anger, the lord of death spirit that is the cause of pride, the avitarka spirit that is the cause of stupidity, the god spirit that is the cause of jealousy, and the female negative spirit that is the cause of desire. The fi ve kinds of beings that are subdued (’dul ) are, respectively, hell beings, humans, gods and demigods, animals, and hungry ghosts. The fruition of the fi ve practices is the purifi cation of the fi ve affl ictive emotions resulting in the fi ve k›yas that embody the fi ve pristine awarenesses: mirror-like, equality, all-accomplished, realm of reality, and discriminating awareness. I wish to thank the Drigung lama Drupon Thinley Ningpo Rinpoché for this detailed information. 251 Phyag chen lnga ldan: the Fivefold Mah›mudr› is the special Drigung Kagyu system structured around those fi ve topics just mentioned.

For discussion of variants see Kapstein, “The Shangs-pa Kagyu: An Unknown Tra-dition of Tibetan Buddhism,” 143, n. 8, and Zangpo, Timeless Rapture, 404, n. 35. Roerich (BA, 728) puts his birth at 1086. Khyungpo Naljor established his seat at Zhang-zhong, in the valley of Shang (Shangs) in Western Tsang, from which the lineage derives its name.

These two women are considered the foremost among Khyungpo Naljor’s one hundred and fi fty gurus. Niguma was reputed to be the sister or spiritual partner of N›ropa, an uncertainty arising from scanty information and the indeterminate usage of the term lcam or lcam mo (“lady,” “sister,” “wife,” etc.). Most encounters with her have been described as taking place in dreams or visions, so any “historical” information is dubious. Sukhasiddhı was a disciple of the adept VirÒpa (BA, 731), although this is not the same VirÒpa responsible for the Lamdré tradition, but rather Eastern VirÒpa (Shar phyogs Birwa pa). See below for the other masters named here. 4 a’i stong ra: the hollow or empty interior practice involves visualizing and recit-ing the syllable a (pronounced as in English “ah”) as it moves through the central channel and throughout the whole body (the hollow interiors) as purifying elixir.

Vajr›sana) referring to Bodhgaya in India. There were at least four suc-cessors to that title: (1) Pu ̊y›karagupta, (2) Ratn›karagupta, (3) Abhay›karagupta, and (4) Tsa mi Lo ts› ba. There is much confusion around this, and both Tibetan and Western writers have avoided it by simply calling him/them Dorjé Denpa or Sanskritizing it as Vajr›sana. One Tibetan author, Ka ̄tok Rikdzin Tsewang Norbu (1698-1755), who tried to sort it all out, posits Pu ̊y›karagupta as Khyungpo Naljor’s guru. See Biographies of Some Holy Ones (Mar mi dwags po jo bo rje yab sras sogs dam pa ’ga’ zhig gi rnam thar sa bon dus kyi nges pa brjod pa dag ldan nyung gsal ) in Selected Writings of Ka ̄-thog rig-’dzin Tshe-dbang nor-bu, vol. 1, ff . 669–705. (Thanks to Cyrus Stearns for providing his translation of the relevant section.) In any case, the story of Khyungpo Naljor’s Dorjé Denpa or Vajr›sana can be found in the biographies of the Shangpa lineage. There are supplications to both Vajr›sanas—Pu ̊y›karagupta and Abhay›karagupta—in Kongtrul’s sup-plications to the lineage (rnam thar gsol ’debs). The “Vajr›sana-Abhaya” specifi ed here is apparently the famous ›c›rya Abhay›karagupta (ca. 1100), who is known for serving as abbot at Vajr›sana, VikramaŸila, and N›land› monasteries in India. He was inspired and authorized by the deity Vajrayoginı, and wrote many profound and vast treatises on tantra (BA, 1046-7). 47 Rin chen rgya mtsho’i rgyud: this is the tantric basis for much of the distinctive Shangpa teachings, particularly those of the Five Tantric Deities.

Niguma’s Vajra Lines and other source texts of the Five Golden Dharmas are contained in the text entitled Vajra Lines on the Six Dharmas of Niguma (Ni gu ma’i chos drug rdo rje tshig rkang) in Shangpa Texts, vol. 6, ff . 161-231. This text contains Niguma’s vajra lines on the Six Dharmas (161-71), followed by a commentary; the vajra lines on mah›mudr› (192-6) [this is not the same as the vajra lines on mah›mudr› in Shang pa mgur mtsho, DZ, vol. 12, 467-9 and translated in Zangpo, Timeless Rapture, 47-8]; and the root text on the three integrations (ff . 196-203). Then follows the s›dhana of White Khecarı (203-4) attributed to Dıpa ̇kara ⁄rijñ›na and of Red Khecarı (204-10) attributed to Lama R›hula. Then there are the root texts on deathlessness of the body (ff . 210-25), called “Deathlessness Attained” (’chi med grub pa) attributed to VirÒpa, translated by the Indian Lalıtavajra and Marpa Lots›wa, and the deathlessness of the mind (225-31), called “Glorious Deathless Great Pristine Awareness” (dPal ’chi med ye shes chen po) bestowed by the ̃›kinı in the teakwood forest, translated by Lots›wa Lendarma Lodrö, and edited by him and Rinchen Zangpo. This last is given the name of vajra lines as well. All of these were received by Khyungpo Naljor after he off ered 500 golden coins each time. 50 Lam ’bras rdo rje tshig rkang: The Vajra Lines of the Path with Its Result is VirÒpa’s Vajra Lines (see Chapter 3 in the present volume). This seems to refer to the fact that these teachings were not written down in India, but passed down through a series of Indian teachers and several generations of Tibetans as oral instructions, until they were fi nally written down. (See Stearns, Luminous Lives, 8-16, and David-son, Tibetan Renaissance, 183-94). TheVajra Lines of Non-Elaboration (sPros med rdo rje tshig rkang) have not been identifi ed, but must also have been composed later and thus considered a treatise. The Vajra Lines of Niguma and those of the Cakrasa ̇vara Hearing Lineage (bDe mchog snyan brgyud; see Chapter 4) were for-mulated immediately upon being received from Buddha Vajradhara by Niguma and Telopa, respectively, and thus are considered Buddha’s word (bka’, Skt. vacana).

This is indicated also by the statement concerning the uncorrupted nature of Niguma’s Vajra Lines. 51 ’Chug (or ’Phyug) med bar do gsum gyi gdams pa in Shangpa Texts, vol. 8, ff . 187-207.

The whole verse reads: Just as illusion and dream, Just as the intermediate states, So, with the application of continuous familiarization, Are the mandalas considered to be. 54 Here ends the section on the abbreviated path that was taken from Instructions for Unerring Three Intermediate States. In this last line I have used the slightly diff erent original (Shangpa Texts, vol. 8, f. 191) for the sake of clarity. 55 kha ga mu kha: khaga is “bird” in Sanskrit, and both this and khecara (“moving in the air, fl ying”) are listed in M-W as derivatives of kha, “cavity, hollow, cave, cavern, one of the nine apertures of the body,” etc., and hence moving (car) in space. Here it seems to imply action-mudra (karmamudr›), the spiritual partner in tantric sexual practice.

Both Kunga Drolchok (Kun dga’ grol mchog, 1507-1566) and his reincarnation T›ran›tha (1575-1634) were known as the “reverend lord of Jonang” due to their associations with the Jonang monastery, the seat of the sect associated with the K›lacakra tantra and the philosophical viewpoint of extrinsic emptiness (gzhan stong). The monastery of Jonang was established in Jomonang in western Tibet by Kunpang Tukjé Tsöndru (1243-1313) and was entirely distinct from that of Khyungpo Naljor in Zhang-zhong, but because of these two great masters the two lineages are often associated. It seems most likely that the reference here is to T›ran›tha, who fi gures most prominently in Kongtrul’s own writings. T›ran›tha wrote extensively on the instructions of the Shangpa lineage, for instance in the text known as Profound Meaning Expanded (Thang rbdal ma).

According to Machik’s Complete Explanation (90), the appellation “father” (pha) might have been fi rst used by Machik Lapdrön’s grandson and lineage-holder: “Tönyön Samdrup developed exceptional faith in Dampa Rinpoché and would say, ‘My father is Dampa Rinpoché.’ Three times a day and three times a night he would pray intently to both his Father Dampa (Pha Dam pa) and his One Mother (Ma gcig). Thus Dampa became known to everyone as Pa-Dampa.” He is often identifi ed as the Indian scholar KamalaŸıla (See TOK 1: 538), and is said to have lived for 570 years. He traveled fi ve times to Tibet, teaching the three main tradi-tions of Ma, So and Kam in central Tibet during his fourth visit (TOK 1: 539).

With a life span of 570 years, Dampa Sangyé’s exact dates are hard to come by, although his death date is often given as 1117. His identity as KamalaŸıla and also sometimes as Bodhidharma is similarly problematic. In The Religious History of Pacifi cation and Severance (RHPS), Khamnyön Dharma Sengé reports that when a group of the faithful asked his name, Dampa replied, “In India I am called Pa ̊ ̃ita KamalaŸıla, in Tibet I am known as Dampa of India. This learned pa ̊ ̃ita is a spiritual adept. Previously I’ve come many times to Tibet. Now again I have arrived in Tibet” (f. 434). Gö Lotsawa (1392-1481) also identifi es him as one KamalaŸrı (BA, 907). However, with respect to his identity as KamalaŸıla, Buton tells the grisly story of “four Chinese butchers, sent by the Hva-shang, killed the teacher KamalaŸıla by squeezing his kidneys,” a sad event that happened during the life of King Trisong Deutsen, making his identity with Dampa Sangyé temporally inconsistent. (Bu ston, The History of Buddhism in India and Tibet, 198). Of course, this is only one of many problems with Dampa Sangyé’s identity and life span. 2 a’ li ka’ li is the Sanskrit alphabet of sixteen vowels and thirty consonants, in which resides profound levels of meaning.

For some descriptions of diff erent types of conduct, see BE, 489-90, n. 39. 47 “spang bya becomes blang bya and vice versa in gcod” (TR). In the traditional teach-ings on the four noble truths, the fi rst and second truths (suff ering and its cause) are what is to be abandoned, while the third and fourth (cessation and the path) are to be practiced. In the profound practice of Chöd, it is the opposite. 48 The Collection (Tshom[s]) usually refers to Ma gcig gi bKa’ ’tshoms chen mo, “Machik’s Great Collection of Precepts” (DZ, vol. 14, ff . 7-16) found in Source Texts of Sever-ance Object (see note 44 above).

Sometimes these four are cited diff erently, with firyadeva mentioned in place of the precept lineage of Severance. For example, in the Slightly Abridged Defi nitive Explanation of Severance, Karma Chakmé says, “The four source rivers of Indian Severance are firyadeva’s Grand Poem, N›ropa’s Equal [Taste] and Secret Conduct, Pa Dampa’s Pacifi cation, and Orgyen Padma’s Severing Illusion” (f. 231). This is basically the same, since the ultimate meaning precept lineage of Severance refers to the so-called sutra lineage, which, in all three sub-lineages, descends from firyadeva the Br›hmin. Kongtrul seems only to be emphasizing the lineage transmis-sion rather than the textual aspect.

He was a contemporary of N›ropa, and he or his successor, K›lacakrap›da the Younger, is sometimes identi-fi ed as N›ropa. Kongtrul describes Naropa as the Elder’s disciple. 24 Praty-›h›ra has been translated in Tibetan as so sor sdud pa or sor sdud, and is some-times translated into English as “specifi c withdrawal,” “individual withdrawal,” and “retraction.” The dictionary defi nitions are drawing back (troops from a battle), retreat; withdrawal (especially of the senses from external objects); withdrawing (of created things), re-absorption or dissolution of the world (M-W, 677). 25 The dissolution is in the order of earth, water, fi re, air, and space. 26 dus sbyor, Skt. lagna: In the K›lacakra system of calculating time, a healthy person takes 21,600 breaths in one solar day. In that time, there are twelve movements or time-conjunctions. Each time-conjunction thus equals 1,800 breaths or movements of energy. Kongtrul says that a time-conjunction is the basis for all calculations of time (MW, 159). A time-conjunction (or “ascendant”) occurs whenever the sun enters a constellation of the zodiac, and so the sun has twelve time-conjunctions in a year. In a single day a new time-conjunction occurs approximately every two hours, whenever a new constellation appears on the horizon (OSL, 676). The bal-ance in the outer and inner timing, a major motif of the K›lacakra Tantra, aff ects the quality of life. See Kongtrul’s discussion in MW, 161-2. 27 [bsDus pa’i] rgyud, Skt.

The forms of K›lacakra and the consort ViŸvam›t› are themselves forms of emptiness. Kongtrul defi nes this as the very embodiment of the union of emptiness and com-passion, or bliss (see “The Mantra Tradition” of m›hamudr› in Chapter 4). Else-where in the Treasury he states that the understanding of this term in the K›lacakra system holds for all other tantras, and so he defi nes it at some length while refuting alternate views, as follows:Furthermore, if the form endowed with the supreme of all aspects were possible whether or not the pristine awareness of great bliss had arisen, then in either case the pristine awareness of freedom from all dualistic elaborations would mean merely the cessation of all dualistic appearances. Then there would be no other appearances at all and it would become emptiness. If that is what you think, it is wrong. That freedom from elaboration itself arises as all aspects of the three realms of samsara and nirvana, such as the circles of the mandalas and so forth. Such arisings, moreover, are not the appearances of the relative truth, nor appearances due to karma, nor deluded appearances. They are appearances of pristine awareness, or appearances of reality (chos nyid; dharmat›), or primordial appearances. Thus, when form, sound, and so on arise in an analogous aspect, one might suspect that [such appearances] are phenomena made of sub-atomic particles. Realizing [this tendency, the great masters] men-tion again and again that these [appearances] transcend the phenomena of sub-atomic particles. Concerning this explanation of emptiness, some have said, “This is not the real ultimate emptiness but the emptiness of being empty of particle phenomena that they believe.” This is talk that prejudicially pollutes the profound meaning. This fully aspected empti-ness is taught as emptiness with visualization (dmigs pa). It is not visual-ization with elaboration, nor with characteristics, nor with concepts, nor with eff ort. Visualization here means to experience by actually seeing. Therefore, it is the actual direct appearance of nondeluded pristine aware-ness. Since this is the real emptiness, the realm of reality, it is generally known as the ultimate truth.
