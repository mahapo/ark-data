This volume, which serves as a prelude to Kongtrul's survey, describes four major cosmological systems found in the Tibetan tradition -those associated with the Hina­yana, Mahayana, Kalacakra and Dzog-chen teachings. To suit the capacities of different grades of beings, Buddha taught four levels of cosmology: the numerically definite cosmology of the individual way; the cosmo­logy of infinite buddhafields of the universal way; the special cosmological system of the Kalacakra Tantra; and dazzling non­cosmological system of the Dzog-chen system, which dispenses with the dualistic perspective, revealing the creative principle to be awareness alone. Each of these cosmologies shows how the world arises from mind, whether through the accumulated results of past actions or from the constant striving of awareness to know itself. This detailed and thorough account of worldviews that present conceptions of space and time which differ significantly from Western ideas is at once illuminating and challenging.

In his autobiography he tells how, at the age of thirty-six, he received the Kalacakra Tantra and many other teachings from Jamyang K yentse Wangpo. This was the turning point in his career. Afterwards he said, \"Nowadays, even well-known lamas and geshes have only a partial understanding of a few texts of their own system of tenets. Apart from that they have little insight, appreciation or comprehensive understanding of the variety of the Buddha's teachings. Most people have little fa miliarity with the teachings and often do not remain impartial. Those in positions of power, despite lacking the ete of Dharma, speak forcefully of the superiority or inferiority of a particular teach­ing. Not to speak of appreciating other systems, they are ap­prehensive even of their own system. They are as full of suspi­cion as a blind yak that runs from its own imagined fears. \"In my own case too, although I cherished the Dharma whole­heartedly, I was not mentally strong enough to make my own decisions. Consequently, I was unable to fulfill my aspirations. But from this time on, the lotus of unbiased devotion towards the wide variety of teachings and their teachers blossomed and my understanding gradually developed. Thus, my not having committed the heinous deed of discarding the Dharma is due only to the kindness of this precious lama.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"It is worth noting here that to be \"sectarian\" in the sense of exclusively dedicating yourself to the study and practice of one particular school is not necessarily a negative thing. Most Ti­betan lamas train in this way. This is positive sectarianism. Negative sectarianism is to follow one tradition exclusively, while looking down on other traditions. I have no doubt that by studying Kongtrul's works readers will be inspired to emulate his great qualities of humility, dedi­cation, patience and nonsectarianism. Therefore, I congratulate the International Buddhist Translation Committee at Samdrup Dargye Choling Monastery for preparing this English transla­tion of the first four chapters of Kongtrul's Sheja Kunkhyab.

The au­thor of the work is Kongtrul Lodro Taye, an outstanding scholar of nineteenth-century Tibet. The English translation of this work has been conducted by an international group of translators inspired and organized by the Venerable Kalu Rinpoche, founder of the project and himself a recognized incarnation of Kongtrul Lodro Taye. Kalu Rinpoche's life and work have given spiritual inspira­tion and insight to people throughout the world. Born in Tibet in 1905, he spent the early part of his life studying Buddhist philosophy and practicing meditation under the tutelage of the greatest teachers of his day. He mastered their teachings through many arduous years of intensive meditation in retreat; first the traditional three-year, three-month retreat, and then a solitary period of twelve years spent in remote caves in the Tibetan mountains. After leaving Tibet in the 1950s, Kalu Rinpoche worked tirelessly to provide spiritual guidance to others. He first taught in Bhutan and India, and later became instrumental in spreading the teachings of the Buddha to all corners of the world. Although Kalu Rinpoche spoke only Tibetan, persons of all cultures were profoundly touched by his words. His compas­sionate concern for the welfare of people from all races and cultures was completely open and impartial. Though ordained as a monk in a religious tradition that was once dominated by"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 Myriad Worlds men, he consistently treated men and women with equal re­spect. He shared the treasure trove of Buddhist meditation with everyone and encouraged all people to regard those precious teachings as their own. Although he spent his life practicing and teaching Buddhism, he always showed sincere respect for all religious traditions. Some people considered him to be a special, extraordinary individual, but it was his directness, sim­plicity, warmth, humor, and boundless concern for others that most deeply touched those who met him. The translation of The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, a text that touches on every topic within the range of Buddhist knowl­edge, is one of Kalu Rinpoche' s most ambitious projects, for which he requested translators, scholars, and meditation mas­ters of the various Tibetan traditions to work together. Kalu Rinpoche explained the importance of this work as follows: The world is currently experiencing unprecedented mate­rial development and the discovery of new scientific knowl­edge, creating good fortune and well-being for everyone. At such a time as this, the unsurpassable wisdom of Buddhism can bring immense happiness and benefit to humanity. This wisdom is contained in the great treatise The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, written by Kongtrul Lodr6 Taye (1813-1899), the nonsectarian master of all Buddhist teachings whose life was prophesied by the Buddha. If this great work is translated into English, the nature of all existence and nirvana will ap­pear as vividly as a reflection in a clear mirror in the minds of the most learned people in the world, as though the ex­panse of their understanding were illuminated with sunlight. It was his wish that the completion of the English translation would lay the foundation for the translation of this text into many other languages. During the winters of 1988 and 1989, Rinpoche invited his students from many countries to gather at Bodhgaya, the site of the Buddha's enlightenment, for three­month sessions of translation. He then encouraged the partici­pants to continue their work full-time at his main seat, Samdrup Dargye Choling Monastery, in Sonada, West Bengal. Rinpoche passed away in May of 1989, dying exactly as he had lived, his mind perfectly calm and clear in the radiant peace of meditation. Shortly before his death, he expressed his deep hope that this project would be continued and completed. He"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Preface 11 entrusted this responsibility to his spiritual heir, the Venerable Bokar Rinpoche, and to his personal secretary and nephew, Lama Gyaltsen Ratak. Under their direction, a small commit­tee of core translators has striven to complete this project as Rinpoche intended. These persons have been the joyful wit­nesses to the return to this world of the reincarnate Kalu Rinpoche, born as the son of Kalsang Drolkar and Lama Gyaltsen Ratak on September 17, 1990. He currently resides at his monastery in Sonada, where he occasionally appears at the translators' house, as though to check on the progress of the work. About the Translation Venerable Kalu Rinpoche originally suggested three principles to follow in the translation of this work: literal, accurate, and accessible. He felt that our efforts should be aimed at translat­ing the actual text into English (tshig bsgyur-translating the words) rather than at interpreting the text in English (don bsgyur-translating the meaning). Secondly, he was more in­terested in an accurate translation than one that sacrificed ac­curacy for elegance. Finally, he encouraged us to use a vocabu­lary that would be accessible to the average educated reader rather than a highly technical vocabulary that depended on prior training in Buddhist or East Asian studies. Reasonable and sensible as these principles are, we found that they some­times conflicted with each other. We found ourselves forced to make choices and compromises with these aims for reasons outlined below. The reader will ultimately decide the extent to which our endeavors have been successful. The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge is a compilation that draws on a variety of texts-scriptures (siitras and tantras), treatises (sastras), and works by Tibetan scholars and masters. Not only do the styles of the source texts differ, but context and meaning vary so widely that a given Tibetan term cannot be translated by the same English word throughout. The aim of a strictly lexical or literal translation thus received its first blow. To fol­low that principle blindly would have meant significant sacri­fices in both accuracy and accessibility. We have tried to main­tain consistency wherever context and meaning were similar."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"12 Myriad Worlds The glossary of technical terms at the end of this volume should help the interested reader to follow our translation choices. A second blow to the aim of literal translation came when we realized that Kongtrul's overly condensed compilation was intended for the well-read and well-educated Tibetan reader. Kongtrul is concise to the point of being telegraphic. A literal rendering in English would have been virtually unreadable, let alone comprehensible. Thus, the translation had to be supple­mented with additional words to meet the demands of reason­able syntax and grammar in English. Our aim here was to keep interpolated material to a minimum in order to preserve as much as possible the style in which Kongtrul writes. An interpretive translation was also impractical. Several parts of the text are sufficiently complex that they exhausted both our knowledge and that of our consultants and resources. When we approached Kalu Rinpoche with these kinds of problems, he pragmatically replied, \"An archer can shoot his arrow only to the limits of his physical strength, no further!\" We have done our best to provide reasonable readings for such passages. The task of elucidating this text through commentary we have left to others. With a few exceptions, we have rendered Sanskrit and Ti­betan technical terms into English. The absence of foreign words in the translated text increases its accessibility to the reader. We also feel that important names and terms need to be ex­pressed directly in English and not shielded by exotic and of­ten difficult to comprehend expressions. Only in this way will these concepts and ideas truly come into our thinking and un­derstanding. This approach led us to make significant decisions about the translation of some difficult terms. More conserva­tive scholars and translators may well criticize these decisions but the discussion engendered by such criticism can only con­tribute to the further clarification of our understanding of Bud­dhism and how best to express it in English. Where the subject matter is very technical, we have tried to be as precise as possible by employing terminology that in our estimation best conveys the intended meaning. We have also attempted to maintain internal consistency in the vocabulary. Less technical terms, while perhaps more accessible, would have"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Preface 13 diluted or distorted the meaning. We hope the reader will re­member that philosophy is difficult in any language. In order to capture as much of the meaning as possible and to convey it in clear English while retaining the flavor of the original, we had to refine and sharpen our own understanding of the concepts involved and the ideas expounded in the text. This refinement often led to our redoing sections of the text as we appreciated deeper levels of structure and meaning. We also had to keep an open mind and discover how to be truly sym­pathetic towards the author and how to appreciate his work even when the subject matter challenged our own views. This sympathy and appreciation steadily deepened in the course of the translation as we came to see more and more clearly what Kongtrul was setting out. When our own understanding failed, we relied on Tibetan commentaries and oral explanations from knowledgeable and respected scholars and lamas. These re­sources were indispensable in helping us to arrive at a proper understanding of this text. Some points of the text were given very different explanations by different scholars. In such cases we chose what, to us, made most sense in the context. We don't claim to have provided a definitive rendering free from errors and freely invite the reader to point out areas where he or she feels we may have been mistaken. Translation always involves three steps: understanding, in­terpretation, and transmission. As we have just outlined, we took as much care and effort as possible in arriving at a sound understanding of the text. We then balanced our own under­standing and interpretations with the text itself to provide the reader with as much material as possible for his or her own interpretations yet still be reasonably clear. And finally, we en­deavored to express the meaning in clear, accessible English as faithful to the original words and style as possible. The translation was undertaken by a group, rather than by an individual. There are many advantages and disadvantages in this approach. Given the scope of Kongtrul's scholarship, we feel that this collaborative effort was both essential and en­riching. The range of viewpoints and skill present among the translators lead to a deep exchange of perspectives which cer­tainly contributed to the quality of the final result."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"14 Myriad Worlds Acknowledgments At every stage of the translation of Myriad Worlds, the commit­tee has sought the advice of Tibetan and Western scholars and meditation masters.

Rong-gyab is a small hidden valley that is considered to be one of the twenty-five sacred places of eastern Tibet, a place where the enlightened activity of the Buddha family manifests. Kongtrul' s adoptive father was Sonam Pel (bSod-nams 'Phel), a lay tantric practitioner of the Bon religion, and his mother was Trashi Tso (bKra-shis 'Tsho). In his autobiography,1 Kongtrul says that his natural father was Yungdrung Tendzin (gYung-drung bsTan­'dzin), an illustrious lama of the Kyungpo, or Garuda, clan whose lineage was on the verge of becoming extinct; the conti­nuity of such a precious lineage was ensured by the union of his mother with Yungdrung Tendzin. Kongtrul provides a lengthy account of the divine origin of the ancestors of the K yungpo clan, whose descendants include some of the most outstanding figures of both the Buddhist and the Bonpo tradi­tions, such as Milarepa/ Kyungpo Neljor,3 and the first Kar­mapa, Dusum K yenpa4 among the Buddhists, and the tert0n5 Loden Nyingpo (Blo-ldan sNying-po) and Trashi Gyaltsen (bKra-shis rGyal-mtshan) among the Bonpos.

At the age of four, Kongtrul found a meditative text on White Mafijusri. He imitated the monks who chanted the text and in that way was able to recite it himself while pointing at the words. His playtime pantomimes included giving em­powerments, building temples, making sacrificial cakes and offering them to the guardians, and so on. Kongtrul learned the letters of the Tibetan alphabet as soon as they were shown to him. While he was still a child, he had numerous visionary expe­riences. Once, while lying in his mother's lap, he had a vision of an ascetic holding a standard and three blazing spheres. On another occasion, he dreamed of a soothsayer who made a cryp­tic prophecy about him; the soothsayer's words seemed to in­dicate the direction of Shechen (Zhe-chen) and Pelpung ( dPal­spungs), the monasteries that Kongtrul would enter years later. Kongtrul mentions in his autobiography that as soon as he could think, he had great faith in Guru Rinpoche, the great master from Oddiyana who dispelled obstacles that had blocked the spread of Buddhism in Tibet. With pride, he would proclaim to the other children that he was the emanation of Guru Rinpoche. He was overjoyed when he heard that a practitioner in the area had gained recognition of the nature of the mind, and he yearned to find somebody who could teach him how to bring about this experience. He had an intense desire to recognize the dream state, and by means· of the force of his desire, he actually acquired the ability to do so. In short, his childhood games, dreams, and thoughts reflected a deep propensity for the spiritual life and an innate high regard for all people. In 1815, Sonam Lodro (bSod-nams Blo-gros), the twenty-sec­ond abbot of Menri (sMan-ri) Monastery/ visited Kongtrul's village; he cut a tuft of his hair and named him Tendzin Yungdrung (bsTan-'dzin gYung-drung), a name that Kongtrul used until he became a monk. Kongtrul was trained in the Bon tradition by his adoptive father and by Yungdrung Puntsog (gYung-drung Phun-tshogs), the yogi and master of the Bon hermitage of Tarde (Thar-bde), close to his native area. By the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"18 Myriad Worlds age of eight, he knew all the divinities of the Bon pantheon and was proficient in the rites of Bon, but it was to the peaceful and wrathful forms of Guru Rinpoche that he was primarily at­tracted. Having received the appropriate instructions, he en­gaged in a retreat to practice the \"transference of conscious­ness,\" and after three days, he developed the signs that indi­cate the accomplishment of that practice. Soon after, he dreamed of flying in the sky with crossed legs, a dream that was to re­peat itself throughout his life. Furthermore, he showed interest and skill in religious dance and painting even from his child­hood. By the time he was a teenager, he already had knowl­edge of the identification of herbs and minerals, which he learned from Karma Puntsog (Karma Phun-tshogs). He con­tinued this training and later became one of the best physicians and alchemists in Tibet. Around that time, a once wealthy and highly respected fam­ily living in his area fell into miserable conditions, losing its possessions and reaching the end of its line of descendants. This dramatic change of circumstances became the \"teacher\" that revealed to Kongtrul the impermanent nature of wealth and possessions, producing in him a genuine inclination to disen­gage from worldly affairs. Then, around 1827, his father Sonam Pel and other kinsmen were imprisoned by the Dege (sDe-dge)8 authorities for alleged complicity in a political assassination. In the wake of this turmoil that reduced the area to poverty, his mother encouraged Kongtrul to enter the monastic life. Shortly afterward, Kongtrul met Tsepel of the Kangsar fam­ily (Tshe-'phel Khang-sar-tshang), the governor of Chode (Chos­sde) Fortress, who was impressed by the intellect and talents of Kongtrul and requested him to be his secretary. Once, while they were at the summer residence of the governor of Dege, Kongtrul was introduced by his patron to Jigme Losel ('Jigs­med Blo-gsal), a teacher at Shechen (Nyingmapa) Monastery. During a conversation with the youth, the teacher was greatly impressed by Kongtrul's knowledge of the Bon doctrine and his ability to articulate it. The teacher advised Kongtrul's pa­tron to send him to study at Shechen. The patron agreed and sent Kongtrul to study at Shechen with the outstanding master Gyurme Tutob Namgyel ('Gyur-med mThu-stobs rNam-rgyal)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 19 Although he had been trained exclusively in the Bon reli­gion, Kongtrul did not experience any difficulty in the Bud­dhist environment. To test Kongtrul's intelligence, his teacher taught him the mother-son, enemy-friend relationships of Chi­nese astrology/ which he readily understood, demonstrating a remarkably brilliant intellect. Kongtrul was taught The Mirror of Poetry,10 a famous textbook used to teach vocabulary and com­position, and he continued to study various Tibetan and San­skrit grammars, such as the Candrapa, Kiilapa, and SarasvatlY He received the empowerment of White Mafijusri, the deity symbolizing wisdom, and the transmission of the Mafljusrz­nama-sarrtgUHantra (Chanting the Names of Mafljusrz Tantra),12 which he recited daily for the rest of his life. In 1831, he started to receive the transmissions of the teachings and practices of the Nyingma school. In 1832, Kongtrul received full ordination as a Buddhist monk from Tutob Namgyel, according to the \"Eastern Vinaya\" (sMad-lugs), the tradition followed by both the Nyingma and the Gelug schools, whose lineage had been introduced by Santarak�ita and rekindled by Lachen Gongpa Rabsel (Bla-chen dGongs-pa Rab-gsal) following the suppres­sion of the Buddhist doctrine by Langdarma (Glang-dar-ma). That same year, Kongtrul made a pilgrimage to the power place of Senge Namdzong (Seng-ge rNam-rdzong) with the Nyingmapa master Lama Kunzang Sang Ngag (Kun-bzang gSang-sngags). The path to their destination was snow-bound, and they were unable to eat or rest all day. Finally, they stopped to rest against a large slab of rock. The teacher said to Kongtrul, \"If one looks directly at the nature of the mind when overcome by fatigue and hunger, one will perceive nothing but the actual nature of the mind.\" They sat together in silence. Kongtrul then had a direct and indescribable experience of the nature of mind. \"Even later in my life,\" he wrote, \"there was nothing to add or develop with respect to the nature I have seen.\" Certainly, his enthusiasm for contemplation to keep alive the awareness of mind's nature continued unabated throughout his life. Kongtrul spent his first years as a monk receiving instruc­tions and transmissions of the kama and terma13 and undertak­ing retreats. Countless signs in dreams and in the waking state indicated his close spiritual affinity with Guru Rinpoche. He"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"20 Myriad Worlds studied liturgy and various scripts, old and new; never dis­tracted by senseless activities, he enthusiastically pursued each field of study. In 1833, Wangen Trulku (dBon-rgan sPrul-sku) of Pelpung Monastery, the brother of Situ Rinpoche, requisitioned the ser­vices of Kongtrul as his secretary. Regretfully, Kongtrul left Shechen Monastery and moved to Pelpung. Just before Kongtrul left, his teacher advised him to maintain a gentle attitude, al­ways to be mindful, and not to be sectarian or partial in any way. The move seemed to have no detrimental effect on him: he remarks that on his journey to Pelpung, snow fell and other auspicious signs appeared. On the first day of the tenth lunar month of that year, Kongtrul met for the first time the ninth Situ, Perna Nyinje (Si-tu Padma­nyin-byed) (1774-1853), who would be his principal Kagyu teacher. Wangen Trulku insisted that Kongtrul retake ordina­tion as a monk, probably because he did not like to acknowl­edge the validity of the lineage of the Vinaya vows that Kongtrul had received the previous year. The master who presided over the ceremony was Situ Perna Nyinje, who on that occasion con­ferred on him the name Karma Ngawang Yanten Gyatso Trinle Kunkyab Pelzangpo (Karma Ngag-dbang Yon-tan-rgya-mtsho 'Phrin-las Kun-khyab dPal-bzang-po). For this ordination, the lineage was that of the \"Western Vinaya\" (sTod-lugs), which had been introduced to Tibet in the early thirteenth century by the Kashmiri scholar Sakyasri,14 had been developed by four monastic communities, and had been followed by the Sakya and Karma Kagyu schools. On the occasion of taking the full monk's ordination for the second time, Kongtrul felt that the residue of the vows he had previously taken was still present in his mind as he took his new vows, so that he did not have the proper sense of receiving the new ordination. Some people think that this episode of his life exposed him to the intoler­ance and sectarianism that were common factors in the spiritu­ality of that time. It would seem to have been significant in directing Kongtrul's interest toward the ecumenical approach that came to characterize his life and his writings."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 21 By the age of thirty, Kongtrul had received teachings and empowerments from more than sixty masters representing all the different schools and esoteric lineages in Tibet. In those times, brilliant monks, unless they were recognized as incar­nate lamas, were taken from the monasteries to become secre­taries to the local landlords and governors. When Kongtrul' s reputation as a promising scholar started to spread, the Pelpung authorities wished to prevent the Dege government from re­moving Kongtrul in the same way that he had been taken from Shechen. This they managed to do by \"recognizing\" him as the incarnation of a learned monk, Bamteng Trulku (Bam-steng sPrul-sku), who had acted as the servant to the previous Situ during the early part of his life. Because Bamteng Trulku had been from the region of Kongpo,15 the newly recognized lama came to be called Kongtrul (\"the incarnation from Kong\"). Although Kongtrul had acquired the title of incarnate lama in this way, it was not an undeserved title. In fact, Gyurme Tutob Namgyel had proclaimed Kongtrul to be an emanation of Vairocana,16 one of the greatest translators during the first propa­gation of the Buddha's doctrine in Tibet. Many scholars and masters, such as Jamyang Kyentse Wangpo/7 came to regard him as an incarnation of a number of previous masters, both Indian and Tibetan. Among these were Ananda (Buddha's cousin), Aryadeva/8 Kyungpo Neljor, Taranatha,19 Terdag Lingpa/0 and others.21 A verse from the LaiJktlvatara Sidra was taken as a prophecy referring to him.22 Later in his life, finding himself in the unique position of being a great teacher and a high-level practitioner, Kongtrul wondered about his previ­ous lives; his own investigation led him to the conclusion that he was an emanation of Vajrapal)i, Vairocana, the discipline master Lume Tsultrim Sherab/3 and the renowned doctor Sumpa Kenpo Yeshe Peljor. 24 In any case, throughout his life Kongtrul showed himself to be an unequaled scholar and ac­complished master. At Pelpung, under the guidance of Situ Perna Nyinje and other spiritual mentors, Kongtrul made rapid progress. By the time he was in his mid-twenties, he was already a teacher of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"22 Myriad Worlds note whose guidance on spiritual matters and instruction in Tibetan and Sanskrit grammar were sought by many people. It is noteworthy that this man who became one of the foremost authorities on all subjects of Buddhist study never entered a Buddhist college or scholastic institution. From Situ, he received The Collection of the One Hundred Empowerments of Taranatha and the transmission of the Tibetan canon; Chagme Trulku (Chags-med sPrul-sku) gave him nu­merous empowerments and teachings of the higher tantras, such as Guhyasamaja and Hayagriva; and Dzigar Chogtrul ('Dzi-sgar mChog-sprul) gave him the four tantras that form the basis for the study and practice of Tibetan medicine. He became the receptacle of countless teachings. Kongtrul engaged in the various practices he was taught, one after the other, unwaveringly pursuing inner realization and invariably expe­riencing wonderful portents. For example, when in 1836 he undertook a retreat on the Five-Deity Cakrasatp.vara practice, one night he dreamed that he was entering a magnificent house. Some persons arrived carrying religious books written in gold, wrapped in silk brocade, and emanating the scent of camphor. In the courtyard of the house, he saw Liiyipa, Kr�:r:tacarya, and Gha:r:ttapa, the three most important Indian mahasiddhas with respect to the transmission of the Cakrasatp.vara Tantra. They appeared in the guise of children, dressed in a variety of cos­tumes. After a time, the three siddhas disappeared, and Kongtrul remained in the natural state of the mind. The most frequent recurrent dreams that Kongtrul had were those of Guru Rinpoche or of being Guru Rinpoche, dreams with prophetic implications that manifested during and after the spiritual practices in which he engaged. Kongtrul writes that in the latter part of his life, the visions and extraordinary experiences occurred less frequently because he used the fa­cilities that the monastic community provided for him, and therefore his mind was darkened by the force of karmic debt. A few years after he first entered Pelpung, the main seat of the Kagyu school in eastern Tibet, Kongtrul began to believe that he was a \"Kagyupa\"; he thus developed a sense of belong­ing to a particular school. Simultaneously, his attraction to the ancient tradition (Nyingma) diminished. Soon, however, he"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 23 recognized that what was occurring in his mind was a karmic obstacle. He thereupon felt regret and confessed this shift of faith. Immediately afterward, his close affinity with the ancient tradition manifested once again in various dreams. Some of these dreams revealed to him the locations of hidden teach­ings. At times, he dreamed of ancient translators who showed him unknown tantras and gave him their transmissions. His dreams at that time also revealed to him that he was an emana­tion of various ancient masters. In other dreams, he met an­cient Indian masters such as Atisa,ZS Santideva,Z6 and Candra­gomin/7 and countless Tibetan masters of the past. In 1839, Kongtrul offered all that he had been given as offer­ings while accompanying on tour the fourteenth Karmapa, Tegchog Dorje (Theg-mchog rDo-rje) (1798-1868}, to Situ Perna Nyinje in order to receive the ceremony in which the awaken­ing mind (bodhicitta) is engendered. On that occasion, Kongtrul received the name Jangchub Sempa Lodro Taye (Byang-chub Sems-dpa' Blo-gros-mtha'-yas}, \"The Bodhisattva of Infinite In­telligence.\" Kongtrul frequently performed the bodhicitta cer­emony at the request of others; this fact indicates the impor­tance that he attached to the bodhisattva ideal. During this same year, Kongtrul met for the first time Jam yang Kyentse Wangpo, received teachings from him, and developed great faith in him. When Kongtrul entered his first traditional three-year retreat, he was interrupted after a year and a half. The fourteenth Karmapa, Tegchog Dorje, was visiting the monastery and had asked to be taught Sanskrit. Kongtrul was deemed proficient enough to act as his tutor. In 1842, when he was almost thirty, Kongtrul had managed to extricate himself from outside de­mands for his time and attention. After an initial refusal, Situ Perna Nyinje finally granted him permission to reenter a three­year period of retreat. He constructed a small meditation hut, to which Situ gave the name Kunzang Dechen Osel Ling (Kun­bzang bDe-chen 'Od-gsal-gling), which was an hour's walk from Pelpung Monastery in a power place named Tsadra Rinchen Drag (Tswa-' dra Rin-chen-brag). This time he man­aged to complete his retreat without interruption, and thereaf­ter he continued to live in his hermitage. This remained his principal residence for the rest of his life and eventually be-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"24 Myriad Worlds came the site of a tiny three-year retreat center that he directed. It was here that Kongtrul composed his literary works, includ­ing The Encompassment of All Knowledge and its commentary, The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge. Kongtrul' s will to put into practice all the teachings he re­ceived from others or discovered himself, to realize them, and to have the necessary potential to transmit them to others never diminished. Consequently, he completed the preliminaries to the Mahamudra practice four times in a row. As a result, he acquired great mental clarity and experienced innumerable good omens and dreams. He lived at all times with an aware­ness of the certainty of death. Whenever his life was threat­ened by obstacles, Kongtrul overcame them by supplicating Guru Rinpoche and by engaging in various practices such as the life-extending practice of White Tara, which had been trans­mitted in Tibet by the saintly Atisa. For other types of obstacles, he practiced the rites of Vajrakilaya.28 The night he received the Long Life Vajra Meteorite29 em­powerment from Won Trulku, he dreamed of seeing the sun and moon shining together in the sky; his Direct Leap30 visions expanded, and from that time forward he recited fewer daily prayers, but he continued to recite the Mahamudra prelimi­nary, Cakrasa:rp.vara, and Varahi31 liturgies. He began to spend considerable time composing his works. At the same time, he acquired stability in the generation stage of tantra. As a sign of this stability, in his dreams he conquered spirits and enemies by transforming himself into the wrathful form of Guru Rinpoche that holds a scorpion or the forms of other deities. Kongtrul said that throughout his life, he derived wonderful signs of attainment as a result of performing the practice called The Union of the Minds of the Masters,32perhaps because of a karmic link with this unequaled hidden teaching. Often he had dreams of girls who showed him the locations of hidden treasures of teachings. In one dream, a well-dressed girl prophesied that his activity on behalf of the Buddhist doc­trine and the welfare of others would be extremely significant, and that he would ultimately discover twenty-five hidden trea­sures of teachings."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 25 Kongtrul spent the rest of his life writing, practicing, and teaching. He lived most of his time in retreat, but, realizing the role that he had to play in the maintenance and transmission of countless spiritual methods that were on the verge of extinc­tion, Kongtrul demonstrated a perfect balance between a con­templative and an active life, between learning and practice. Poverty was one of his closest companions for many years, and unlike most teachers of his day, he chose to live without ser­vants or attendants, like the great Indian sage Asanga, a pio­neer of the Cittamatra philosophy, who only in his advanced old age chose to keep a novice monk as his helper. Only Kongtrul's mother and niece (after his mother's death) shared his residence and helped with the household chores. His cir­cumstances were always modest: he complained that he almost abandoned his resolve to be compassionate to all beings be­cause of the mice and rats in his home that ate his precious books. Once he dreamed of ascending a celestial ladder to the sky, which was perhaps a sign of his having attained the bodhisattva levels of awakening. On one occasion, when performing a tantric feast of offering (ganacakra), he beheld in a waking vi­sion the face of Guru Rinpoche,large as a mountain, after which he recognized the natural state of the mind, the ordinary mind without concepts, a state in which there is nothing to be con­firmed or rejected, the experience of the unmodified state of being. That was also the first time that Kongtrul transcended the mental creations that limit the original spaciousness of the mind. Subsequently he dreamed of the eight medicine buddhas, who prophesied that in the future Kongtrul would be Buddha Well-Honored Universal Monarch (bDe-bzhin-gshegs-pa rDzogs-par 'khor-los-sgyur). His dreams also repeatedly indi­cated his previous affiliation with Terdag Lingpa and the Nyingma monastery of Mindroling. Once, he dreamed of the master Dzogchen Sonam Zangpo (rDzogs-chen bSod-nams bZang-po), an embodiment of Dromton ('Brom-ston),33who told him: \"Your practice should be that of the Great Perfection and your meditational deity the Highly Compassionate One.34 Other masters have given the same instructions!\""},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"26 Myriad Worlds At the beginning of 1847, Kongtrul engaged in the retreat of the Highly Compassionate One, following a practice called Self­Liberation from the Lower Realms. The benefits of this practice were immense: during the night, his mind remained in a state of intermingled compassion and emptiness; in the daytime, he enhanced his understanding of the scriptures while experienc­ing a rain of inner blessings. At this time, he wrote a work of praise to the eight bodhisattvas, which he called The Eight Great Clouds; that marked the beginning of his literary output. Kongtrul traveled widely in eastern Tibet, revitalizing the spirituality of the monasteries and retreat places, educating monks and laypersons by giving teachings, empowerments, and transmissions for a multitude of practices. He gave every­thing that was offered to him to Situ Perna Nyinje. The year 1849 was astrologically critical for Kongtrul. Con­sequently, he engaged in various spiritual practices to avert negative influences and obstacles. At that time, he dreamed of a green plateau, in the center of which was a throne made of white stone adorned with self-originated Chinese and Tibetan characters. On the throne was Padmasambhava, who told him: \"From now on up to the age of forty-four, because of my bless­ing, there will be no obstacles to your life. Then, you will meet me in person.\" This dream foretold that Kongtrul would meet Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa (Chogling) (mChog-gyur bDe-chen Gling-pa) (1829-1879) and receive from him a particular prac­tice to remove obstacles. From Jamyang Kyentse Wangpo, Kongtrul received, on nu­merous occasions, teachings and empowerments of all tradi­tions of Tibetan Buddhism, at times without having requested them. In particular, he received the three series of the Dzog­chen, the transmissions of the various Sakya lineages, and that of Marpa.35 In turn, Kongtrul conferred the teachings, empowerments, longevity rites, and blessings that Kyentse re­quested of him. Thus, each was both the student and the teacher of the other. It was K yentse, however, who was more the teacher; Kongtrul asked his advice on all matters, especially after the passing away of Situ Perna Nyinje. The relationship of Kongtrul, K yentse, and Chogling played an important part in the nine-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 27 teenth-century cultural renaissance in eastern Tibet. Other teach­ers, such as Mipam (Mi-pham)36 (1846-1912), Kenpo Shenga (mKhan-po gZhan-dga'),37 Adzom Drugpa (A-'dzom 'Brug­pa),38 Peltrul Rinpoche/9 and Shardza Trashi Gyaltsen (Shar­rdza bKra-shis rGyal-mtshan), a Bonpo, made important con­tributions as well, but undoubtedly the three mentioned above were the chief protagonists of the renaissance. K yentse was the inspiring force, realized in all aspects; Kongtrul was the saintly scholar who had the capacity to put everything in writing and the power of transmission; and Chogling was the unhindered mystic. That Kyentse was the inspirational force behind the re­naissance is evident in the words of Kongtrul himself; in his autobiography, Kongtrul writes that Kyentse, by merely sup­plicating Guru Rinpoche, could encounter in visions and dreams the ancient masters and tertOn and receive from them their teachings, some of which either no longer existed or be­longed to transmission lineages that had been interrupted. He thus infused with vitality those teachings that had lost their freshness through a long lineage of transmission and per­petuated the transmission of others that would otherwise have been lost. Although Buddhist scholars speak of a Rime (ris-med), or nonsectarian, movement in connection with K yentse, Kongtrul, Chogling and other masters of eastern Tibet, it is unlikely that these masters intended to create a movement that encompassed the various Tibetan traditions. These masters were, however, unbiased in their approach to the teachings in that their inter­ests were not directed exclusively toward the traditions to which they belonged. They collected, committed to writing, taught, and thereby preserved, revitalized, and propagated instruction lineages that encompassed every aspect of Buddhist teaching. Significantly, they did so at a time when, as a result of the policy of strict adherence to particular teachings that was followed by various schools and traditions, there was a real danger that many instruction lineages would disappear. Therefore, these masters had a tremendous impact on the Tibetan Buddhist tra­dition, and the results of their efforts to preserve the teachings are felt even now."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"28 Myriad Worlds The renaissance to which these masters gave rise may have occurred in eastern rather than central Tibet because central Tibet was dominated by the new monastically oriented schools. The intellectual tendency of these schools to focus on philo­sophical subtleties certainly did not predispose them to favor an approach based on synthesis; such an approach requires a certain degree of simplification and the concomitant abandon­ment of petty theological disquisitions. Eastern Tibet, which was far from the theocratic government of Lhasa and was the home of schools that tended to be experientially-rather than intellectually-oriented, was the ideal environment in which a nonsectarian revival of the teachings could flourish. The ancient Nyingma school had been severely suppressed since the second period of the propagation of the Buddhist doctrine in Tibet.40 Therefore, the teachings of the Nyingma school-and particularly the Dzog-chen system-received the lion's share of the attention of the three masters. In fact, the longest of Kongtrul's many writings is The Treasury of Precious Treasure Teachings (Rin chen gter mdzod), which contains more than sixty volumes of important cycles of the Nyingma trea­sure teachings. In The Encompassment of All Knowledge (Shes bya kun khyab), the Dzog-chen system is identified as the highest of the nine vehicles that, collectively, constitute the paths taught in the sutras and tantras. The all-embracing attitude of Kongtrul and his colleagues clearly was not intended to merge into a single system the vari­ous Tibetan Buddhist traditions, but it did have the effect of overcoming sectarianism, the sense of belonging to a school, the belief that only one tradition is valid. It is easy for a small intellect that knows only a single philosophical presentation, only one secret oral instruction, or only one system of practice, to fall prey to the idea that that is the only correct way. Being open to various traditions can free the mind from bias and par­tiality, bestowing the insight that perceives the intercon­nectedness of the various teachings and traditions, their scope, and their particular qualities: this benefit alone outweighs the danger of becoming confused when confronted by different and sometimes apparently divergent Buddhist teachings and tra-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 29 ditions. In his different discourses, even the Buddha gave contradictory explanations. The context of the explanation and the audience for whom it was intended must be considered if one is to understand the explanation fully. Kongtrul, who had become a receptacle for innumerable teachings and secret instructions of all traditions, spoke critically of contemporary teachers: Nowadays, even famous masters and scholars have very little faith in and knowledge of the various Buddhist teachings in general; their education is restricted to their own tradition, based on the study of just a few scriptures. Most people, both the influential and the ordinary, are not learned and have little understanding of the meaning of the teaching. In particular, at the present time many persons who are partial and lack the eye of understanding the doctrine arro­gantly proclaim which Buddhist tradition is good and which is bad, which teaching lineage is pure and which impure. Like the blind yak who flees imagined dangers, they are dubious and cautious of their own school, to say nothing of other traditions. Kongtrul's extreme humility is obvious in his autobiography. Nevertheless, his exceptional qualities and activities shine through clearly; he acknowledges having faith in and respect for all teachings and the authentic masters who uphold them. His faith nurtured his broad-minded approach, and in no way did he ever reject any aspect of the Buddha's teaching. Thus, he was an example worthy of being followed by any Buddhist. In 1855, Chogling recognized Kongtrul as a tertOn, or trea­sure discoverer, and gave him the name Chime Tennyi Yungdrung Lingpa ('Chi-med bsTan-gnyis gYung-drung Gling­pa). Kongtrul had great respect for Chogling, and on many oc­casions he was requested by Chogling to participate in or per­form rites involving the discovery of hidden treasures. For ex­ample, when Chogling and Kyentse recovered texts belonging to the three series of the Dzog-chen tradition from the Crystal Lotus Cave in Dzam Nang, Chogling gave Kongtrul a blazing statue of Mahakala carved by Nagarjuna out of a black rock from Cool Grove41 that bore Nagarjuna's handprint. In return,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"30 Myriad Worlds Kongtrul gave Chogling an exceptional antique statue of Guru Rinpoche. In the second lunar month of 1867, Chogling and Kyentse jointly enthroned Kongtrul, gave him the official title of treasure discoverer, and performed long-life rituals for him. Kongtrul often traveled back and forth to the twenty-five power places of eastern Tibet that had been discovered by Chogling, performing endless tantric feasts of offering or per­forming the great rites that are associated with various deities and are popular in the ancient tradition. Often he combined the great rites with the preparation of the blessing-medicine (sman-sgrub), exercising his great interest and skill in the arts of healing and alchemy. His formula for detoxifying mercury be­came famous, and his books on medicine are highly valued even today by doctors of traditional Tibetan medicine. Because Kyentse and Chogling often requested Kongtrul's presence when extracting hidden treasures from mountains, rocks, and caves, and when performing the necessary rites and tantric feasts of offering preceding or following the extractions, Kongtrul became a receptacle for the hidden teachings. On a trip to central Tibet, he taught many such teachings to the four­teenth Karmapa, Tegchog Dorje, and to Drugpa ('Brug-pa) Rinpoche/2 who hesitated to receive empowerments from Kongtrul until in his own dreams he learned the precious na­ture of such transmissions and the need to receive them. The importance of the activities of Kongtrul in the preservation of many lineages of instruction can be discerned in the impor­tance that Tibetan masters nowadays attach to the transmis­sions and empowerments contained in Kongtrul's compilation The Treasury of Precious Treasure Teachings. When Kongtrul de­cided to compile old and new hidden teachings, he sought the advice of Kyentse, who told him to take as a basis four texts that he himself had composed by collecting scattered hidden teachings, and to write a complete work on the highest tantras and Dzog-chen. In order to be empowered to write such a text, Kongtrul engaged in several retreats, until in 1856 he had nu­merous auspicious dreams in which he found precious pills belonging to the Indian Dzog-chen master Vimalamitra and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 31 some belonging to Yeshe Tsogyel (Ye-shes mTsho-rgyal), the Tibetan consort of Guru Rinpoche. He also dreamed of being seated on a throne reading a scripture written in silver that con­tained exceptional teachings. He dreamed of the dawning of the sun and the moon and of receiving a blessing from a vase that Chogling Rinpoche had discovered. All these signs he took as indications that it was time to begin composing the work. After the completion of each part of the work, Kongtrul was requested by incarnate lamas and meditators to start to confer the empowerments and transmissions that were contained in it. Rapidly, these transmissions were propagated among the monasteries and communities of practitioners throughout east­ern Tibet; as a result, they developed as had no other teachings. Kongtrul's name is sometimes mentioned in connection with diplomacy. In 1857, he was sent to central Tibet to recover the incarnation of Situ Rinpoche, who had died in 1853. There, he had to exercise his diplomatic skill with Shedra (bShad-grwa),43 the prime minister of the Tibetan government, in order to bring the young Situ, whose parents were subject to Trashi Lhunpo Monastery44 authorities, to Pelpung. On another occasion, a demand had been made by some of the Gelug monasteries of eastern Tibet that the Kagyu monasteries in the area be de­stroyed; this was demanded of the army of central Tibet, which had come into the region to repel the invading Nyarong45 army, headed by Gonpo Namgyel (mGon-po rNam-rgyal). 46 By exer­cising his skill as a doctor, Kongtrul was able to cure Dongkam Trulku (gDong-kam),47 the leader of the Dragyab (Brag-g'yab) Gelug monasteries, of a serious illness; as a result, Kongtrul succeeded in a covert diplomatic mission to save Pelpung and other Kagyu monasteries from being destroyed and their prop­erty from being confiscated. Kongtrul's services as mediator or peacemaker were requested in a number of situations: he ac­cepted these requests, but he never became a politician. He re­mained a true spiritual seeker who simply played the political role that was part of his altruistic activity as a bodhisattva in the world. Despite the importance that Kongtrul had in the Buddhist environment in eastern Tibet, at the age of sixty-one, after he had composed many of the works that cause him to be held in"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"32 Myriad Worlds the highest esteem even today, a few degenerate monks from Pelpung Monastery initiated a dispute to discredit him and the lama Won. They probably did so because they could not toler­ate Kongtrul's broad vision and all-embracing attitude toward all teachings, especially toward those of the ancient tradition. K yentse told him that what was happening was a great ob­stacle to the doctrine. Finally, the senior manager of Dege, Tsering Don drub (Tshe-ring Don-grub), was asked to investi­gate the matter. The allegations were found to be baseless. The dispute was subsequently dissolved, and the few monks re­sponsible were arrested. It was decided that Won Lama would take residence in Drentang (Dren-thang) and that Kongtrul would live at his own hermitage. The following year, Won Lama died, Kongtrul wrote, as a direct result of the obstacle caused by his students' transgression of their relationship with their master. In a letter to Kongtrul, Kyentse advised: In Pelpung Monastery, you increased the activities of teach­ing and empowerments. Yo u taught the great rites of the an­cient and new traditions, and when they were performed, you acted in them as the tantric master. You also taught the various sciences. At your hermitage you spent long periods in retreat. Now nothing worse can happen to you than what has just happened, other than your being killed. Therefore, follow the words of advice of Atisa: Stay at least a hundred miles away from the place where there is a dispute. Kongtrul said that he bore no grudge against the monks who reviled him but felt for them only compassion, recognizing that their minds had been under the influence of strong emotions and that they had broken the sacred bond with their teacher. At the same time, because they had repaid in a perverse way the kindness that Won Lama (who was one of Kongtrul's mas­ters) had shown them, Kongtrul admitted to feeling dislike for the monks and teachers who had caused the problem. From that time for about fourteen years, he did not enter Pelpung Monastery. By the end of his life, however, most of the greatest masters and incarnate teachers of the nineteenth century were among his disciples. Kongtrul died in his eighty-seventh year, on Thursday, De­cember 28, 1899; many auspicious signs appeared at that time."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"* * * Translators' Introduction 33 Kongtrul was an extremely prolific writer who composed more than ninety volumes on theory and practice according to the Nyingma, Kadampa, Sakyapa, Kagyu, and Bonpo traditions. Although he cannot be considered an innovator, he had the great merit of collecting rare teachings and information on many subjects related to Buddhism, and giving them impetus to sur­vive beyond the nineteenth century. At times, he rewrote teach­ings to make them more accessible to the minds of his contem­poraries. He represents the best effort to synthesize all knowl­edge contained in Buddhist literature in the Tibetan language after the period of doctrinal systematization that occurred dur­ing the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. These were the peri­ods during which geniuses such as Tsongkapa (Tsong-kha-pa),48 the founder of the Gelug school, and Longchenpa (Klong-chen­pa),49 the greatest Nyingma mind, appeared. One characteris­tic of Kongtrul's scholastic works is his emphasis on original Indian treatises after a long period during which monastic in­stitutions had developed indigenous works that specialized in subtly interpreting Indian treatises. Kongtrul's major works are traditionally known as the Five Great Treasuries (mDzod chen lnga), a name that Kyentse gave them when Kongtrul showed him the first draft of the first of the five, The Encompassment of All Knowledge. The four others are The Kagyu Treasury of Mantra, The Treasury of Key Instruc­tions, The Tr easury of Precious Treasure Teachings, and The Special Secret Treasury of Advice. The Kagyu Tr easury of Mantra (bKa' brgyud sngags mdzod) con­tains the mandala practices of the thirteen tantric deities, as well as ancient and new tantras (some of which were transmit­ted by Marpa the Translator), accompanied by the teachings on the completion stage of the tantra, the rites of empower­ment, and various authorizations. It consists of six volumes. The Treasury of Precious Treasure Teachings (Rin chen gter mdzod) contains empowerments, teachings, rites, and instructions on how to apply them in retreat for all the cycles of terma that Kongtrul could find. The collections begin with the Earth Trea­sures50 of treasure discoverers such as Nyangrel Nyime Ozer (Nyang-ral Nyi-ma'i 'Od-zer),51 Guru Chokyi Wangchug (Gu-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"34 Myriad Worlds ru Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug), Longchenpa, Rigdzin Godem (Rig­'dzin rGod-ldem),52 Tangtong Gyelpo (Thang-stong rGyal-po) (1385-1509); the various lingpa (Gling-pa) such as Rinchen (Rin­chen) (1340-1396), Dorje (rDo-rje) (1346-1405), Karma (Kar-ma), Perna (Pad-rna) (1450-?), Letro (Las-'phro) (1585-1656), and Chogling; and also Bonpo treasure discoverers. The second part of the work contains the cycles of teachings derived from the Mind Treasures and Pure Visions53 of discoverers such as the fifth Dalai Lama, Dorje Togme Tsel (rDo-rje Thogs-med rTsal) (1617-1682), Namcho Migyur Dorje (gNam-chos Mi-'gyur rDo­rje) (seventeenth century), and Jigme Lingpa ('Jigs-med Gling­pa). The last part of the work contains those treasure teachings whose transmissions had become rare; it contains a compila­tion of texts on minor terma with clarifications. It consists of sixty volumes. The Treasury of Key Instructions (gDams ngag mdzod) contains empowerments and instructions related to the eight practice lineages of Tibet-Nyingma, Kadam, Sakya, Marpa Kagyu, Shangpa Kagyu, Pacification [of Suffering] (Zhi-byed), the Yoga of the Indestructible State (rDo-rje mal-'byor), the Three Inde­structible States, Familiarization and Attainment (rDo-rje gsum­gi-bsnyen-sgrub)-and a ninth section dealing with miscella­neous teachings of other lineages.lt consists of twelve volumes. Finally, The Special Secret Treasury of Advice (Thun mong min gsang mdzod), whose fifteen outlines were composed by Kyentse to provide an auspicious beginning to the work, contains The Union of the Minds of the Three Roots and other teachings origi­nating from the yellow scrolls (containing treasure teachings) and mind treasures discovered by Kongtrul himself. It consists of seven volumes. In addition, Kongtrul wrote about rites, provided words of advice for students, wrote philosophical exegeses, and dis­cussed Indian and Chinese astrology, medicine, grammar, and other subjects. Kongtrul's huge literary output gives the impression that he must have spent most of his life writing. In fact, however, most of his time was dedicated to retreats and various prac­tices, and he said that he often wrote his works in the breaks between his meditations. It was because of his perspicacity in"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 35 writing and his unequaled scholarship that Kongtrul came to be known as Jamgon ('Jam-mgon), \"Gentle Protector,\" which is an epithet of Maftjusri, the bodhisattva who symbolizes su­perior wisdom. The Encompassment of All Knowledge and the Commentary The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge As Kongtrul was gaining his reputation as a brilliant teacher, the learned scholar Ngedon Tenpa Rabgye (Nges-don bsTan­pa Rab-rgyas), the first Dazang (Zla-bzang) incarnation and the founder of Tilyag (Til-yag) Monastery in the Nangchen (Nang­chen) district, requested him to write a treatise on the three Buddhist disciplines-the vows of personal liberation, the pre­cepts of awakening mind (bodhicitta), and the commitments of the mantra way. He promised that if Kongtrul wrote a root text, he would compose a commentary on it. Reflecting on the scholar's request, Kongtrul came to the conclusion that since treatises on the three disciplines were very common in Tibet, it would be more useful to write a book that contained a full pre­sentation of the various Buddhist paths, in keeping with his nonsectarian attitude toward all teachings. In fact, Sakya Pal).<;iita, by writing his famous Exposition on the Three Disciplines (sDom gsum rab dbye), had set the example for that kind of literature. Many tried to imitate him by writing commentaries on the same subject. It is probable that Kongtrul did not want to be redundant by writing yet another work of that nature. Consequently, he started to write a root text called The Encompassment of All Knowledge (Shes bya kun khyab) between meditation sessions while living in retreat at his hermitage, Kunzang Dechen Osel Ling. When Kongtrul presented the manuscript to K yentse in 1862, the latter was highly impressed and said to Kongtrul: The success of this work is certainly due to the blessing of the spiritual masters and sky-dancers who have caused your inner energy pathways to open! This is a treasury of knowl­edge and must be considered the first of your five treasuries (mdzod lnga). You must be sure to write your own commen­tary to it."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"36 Myriad Worlds It was Kyentse himself who had previously prophesied that Kongtrul would write five treasury-like works. In 1863, Kongtrul composed his own three-volume commentary to his root text, entitled The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge (Shes bya mtha' yas pa'i rgya mtsho), completing it in less than four months. The work was finally revised in 1864, with the help of Trashi Ozer (bKra-shis 'Od-zer) (1836-1910), a scholar and abbot of Pelpung. The Encompassment of All Knowledge consists of 154 pages in the modern edition54 and of 78 folios in the Pelpung edi­tion,SS and it is written entirely in verse, with each line having nine syllables. It consists of ten sections (gnas), each of which has four chapters (skabs) of uneven lengths. Because Kongtrul touches on all Buddhist fields of knowledge as well as the related secular sciences known at his time, one must ex­cuse the terse style of the composition. For the most part, it is impossible to understand the work without the aid of the commentary. The Encompassment of All Knowledge, together with the com­mentary The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, is often referred to as The Treasury of Knowledge, the first of Kongtrul's five treasuries. The commentary consists of 1936 pages in the modern edition and 992 folios in the Pelpung edition. The style is that of a \"word commentary,\" in that the words of the root verses are used and expanded upon in the commentary. Even though it is not re­markable in its style, it is relatively clear and accessible. In some parts, the contemplative approach taken by Kongtrul serves to lead the reader into a contemplative state. One's first impression of the work may be that its various subjects are surveyed superficially rather than explored in depth. This is partly true. A detailed survey of all Buddhist traditions and teachings would be endless; therefore, Kongtrul's treatment of each topic is brief. The way in which he deals with each topic, however, is anything but superficial. In fact, he dem­onstrates a remarkable gift for synthesis that is a natural conse­quence of his vast knowledge of Buddhism. The work should be viewed as an ideal starting point for further study. In The Encompassment of All Knowledge, Kongtrul examines subjects, concepts, and terminology from the perspectives of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 37 different systems. He does so in order to demonstrate both the similarities and the differences of the various systems. This approach, in which different chapters are devoted to different systems, has a number of advantages. If the meaning of a sub­ject, concept, or term is unclear in one system's exposition, for example, that meaning may be made clear in another system's exposition. An attentive reading of The Encompassment of All Knowledge will reveal the complex relationships that exist among its various subjects. The order of the chapters within the sections is significant in that it reveals the level of importance that Kongtrul attaches to each system. He generally moves from lower levels of impor­tance to higher levels, treating the subject first from the per­spective of the Individual Way, next from the shared perspec­tive of the Individual Way and the Universal Way, then from the exclusive perspective of the Universal Way, and finally from the perspective of the Dzog-chen system in particular or the Nyingma school in general. In fact, seven of the ten chapters that end the ten sections of the work utilize a Dzog-chen or Nyingma perspective. Kongtrul' s nonsectarian and all-embrac­ing attitude is exemplified by the work's ladder-like structure, in which the Individual and Universal Ways lead first to the Vajrayana and ultimately to the Dzog-chen system, the peak of all spiritual pursuits. In moving from one system to the next, Kongtrul uses quotations that come mainly from the discourses of the Buddha, the tantras, and the treatises of the Indian sages, demonstrating in the process his exhaustive knowledge of the original sources. In the philosophical chapters, Kongtrul is strictly scholastic but never argumentative and sophistic, and he never aligns himself with a particular point of view. He also defends, albeit humbly, philosophies, schools, and masters that had been at­tacked at times in the history of Tibetan Buddhism when con­servative and absolutist attitudes held sway. Thus, in his treat­ment of the philosophical systems, he accorded a place equal to-if not higher than-those of the others to the \"other empti­ness\" (gzhan-stong) school, which constitutes a link between the sutra and tantra systems and facilitates the emergence of the experiential approach to the teachings."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"38 Myriad Worlds Although Kongtrul wrote the most comprehensive piece of extant Tibetan literature, not everything that appears in The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge is his own writing. Entire pages and sections are copied from other sources, although Kongtrul of­ten simplifies the original expositions in the process. In his treat­ment of the Dzog-chen system, for example, Kongtrul uses the work of Longchenpa, and when he discusses the history of Buddhism, he draws from the works of Buton (Bu-ston) (1290-1364), Taranatha, and others. This borrowing does not, how­ever, detract from the value of Kongtrul's work: such copying was common practice among Tibetan writers. This practice also indicates the various Tibetan masters who influenced Kongtrul, one of whom was undoubtedly the brilliant and eclectic Longchenpa. Both editions of the text are presented in three volumes. The contents56 of The Encompassment of All Knowledge and the corre­sponding commentary are as follows: In the first volume, Kongtrul deals with cosmology, the life of Buddha Sakyamuni, the teaching of Sakyamuni, and the history of Buddhism in In­dia and Tibet. In the second, Kongtrul presents the three disci­plines; the minor sciences (grammar, logic, arts, medicine, po­etry, lexicography, literary composition, opera, and astrology); and the Buddhist paths and their practice. In the third, he pre­sents the relative and ultimate truths and the various philo­sophical systems; the stages of meditation within sutra and tantra, such as calm abiding and insight meditation, and the generation and completion stages of the Vaj rayana; a descrip­tion of the tantras; and explanations of the secret instructions of the eight practice lineages of Tibet. Finally, he presents the stages and the path to be traveled and the goal to be attained: the three dimensions of awakening. In particular, Kongtrul presents the oral instructions of vari­ous lineages, unfolding in very few words their experiential teachings. The editors of the Beijing edition described Kongtrul's work as follows: Without going through the trouble of finding many books, for those who wish to learn a single treatise that will free them from all ignorance, this work is like an ocean of reasoning; for those who wish to reflect it is like a boat (tak-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 39 ing one across the route) of reflection for the mind; for those who wish to meditate it is a jewel-like oral instruction; and for those who wish to engage in analysis it is like a clear crystal mirror. This Book Myriad Worlds discusses Buddhist cosmography and the gen­esis of beings who inhabit the universe. The descriptions of the universe that are given in the four chapters of the book are strik­ingly different. One universe is composed of a definite number of world-systems, one is composed of an infinite number of world-systems, and another is nothing but the play of the total and pure awareness of each and every being. Although they represent different approaches, these various cosmological sys­tems do not contradict one another; instead, they are contained one within the other, like Chinese boxes. Each corresponds to the level of spiritual maturity of the individual for whom it is intended, and thus each one is built upon the foundation of another, the higher transcending rather than negating the lower. The universe is considered from the point of view of its ori­gin and its configuration. Its origin is explained in terms of a complex, transmutable relationship between mind and matter, a connection that becomes apparent as one progresses through the text. By contrast, the conclusive Dzog-chen treatment of the origin of the universe dispenses with the dualistic perspective, revealing the \"Majestic Creative Principle of the Universe\" to be intrinsic awareness alone. The configurations of the world­systems do not vary dramatically in the various cosmologies; they differ only in that they are described as having finite or infinite numbers of world-systems. These worlds are arranged in the same basic pattern of an axis mundi (Mount Meru), with surrounding mountain ranges, four continents, and so forth. Sentient beings are classified within a single world-system model. The various parts of Mount Meru, the continents, and the oceans are inhabited by beings whose lives are progressively more refined the closer their abodes are to the top of Mount Meru, with the highest worldly states of existence found in the form and formless realms above the mountain."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"40 Myriad Worlds Kongtrul delineates four levels of cosmology: the numeri­cally definite cosmology of the Individual Way, the cosmology of infinite buddha-fields of the Universal Way, the cosmology of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time (Kalacakra), and the noncosmology of the Dzog-chen, or Great Perfection, system. The author introduces the cosmology of infinite buddha-fields in the first chapter and then narrows the focus of his discus­sion to Endurance (Saha), our own world-system, in the sec­ond chapter. In the third chapter, he begins his discussion of the perspective of the Wheel of Time; this he continues in part in the fourth chapter, where he also investigates the mecha­nisms of conditioned existence. In this way, he explains first the cosmology of infinite buddha-fields, then the numerically definite cosmologies, and finally the openness that constitutes the underlying reality of the universe, beings, and buddhas: the primordial purity of the universe that is presented in the Dzog-chen system. The Numerically Definite Cosmology When he was asked whether the world and the self were eter­nal or noneternal, both or neither, finite or infinite, the Buddha remained silent. His silence regarding such speculations about beginnings and ends was a denial of both absolutism and ni­hilism regarding the world and the self. On the one hand, this implies a denial that the world was created by Brahma or any other supernatural being, and on the other, a denial that it came into being without causes. He also denied that the world emerged as the result of the transformation of a primordial sub­stance (prakrti), as was claimed by the Indian Sarpkhya phi­losophy. In this respect, Buddhism is a truly nontheistic reli­gion in which the concept of god as creator has no place. Bud­dhist cosmology recognizes a process of creation but does not acknowledge any sort of supernatural creator. Who then created the world? The Buddhist reply is that the collective force of the evolutionary actions of sentient beings creates the world; therefore, all beings contribute to the cre­ation of the world. \"Evolutionary action\" in this context refers to the cumulative potential that remains in the mind-stream"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 41 after the performance of any physical, verbal, or mental action that is based on the underlying impulse of clinging to the idea of a self. According to the law of causality, this cumulative po­tential is able to produce specific results within the continuity of the subjective experience of each individual being, as well as producing the environment that that being inhabits. Thus, beings are related to their environments through causality, because the world is the result of the evolutionary actions of beings. In order to demonstrate that specific causes lead to specific results, Buddhist philosophy must postulate a linking factor and must also answer the question, What constitutes a person? Kongtrul briefly states the different views of various Buddhist schools regarding the nature of the linking factor. Centrists of the Consequential school, for example, regard this factor to be nothing other than the \"mere person.\" (\"Mere\" in­dicates that the person exists only in a conventional sense.) Kongtrul points out that all these views are inadequate in some way, but he does not state his own views on the subject. The creative relationship between mind and matter is the vi­tal point in Kongtrul's treatment of the creation of the world. Certain \"winds,\" or energies, are considered to be the potent agents of creation. These energies arise from the cumulative actions of beings who are about to take birth. Because they are the expressions of beings' actions, these energies are endowed with special potencies that are capable of shaping a new world. The energies of evolutionary actions thus form the bridge be­tween mind and matter. Exactly how the cumulative potential of actions becomes external energy capable of contributing to creation constitutes the great mystery of how mind can create matter. In addition to energies, other factors are involved in the creation process. According to the Wheel of Time Tantra, scat­tered particles of matter remaining in space after a previous world-system has been destroyed are the \"galactic seeds\" that coalesce to form new planets, stars, and so forth, a process stimulated by the interplay of the five material elements. The Individualist cosmology states that energies arise from the ten directions and, through pressure and friction, produce primor­dial water. This primordial water element contains the seeds"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"42 Myriad Worlds from which coarse matter arises, which is then shaped into vari­ous forms by the energy-winds generated by the past evolu­tionary actions of beings. According to some commentators on Va subandhu's Treasury of Phenomenology, generative seeds come from other world -sys­tems; according to others, the seeds are contained within the primordial water; and according to others, the residual particles remaining after the destruction of an old world-system con­tribute to the formation of a new world-system. This creative process occurs throughout the entire universe, not only within our own world-system. Although the numerically definite cos­mology is primarily concerned with a single world-system­our own-it clearly acknowledges the existence of a vast num­ber of other worlds. In this scenario, there is no absolute begin­ning to the process of a world-system coming into being. Bud­dhist cosmology explains the creation of our world as an ex­ample of a timeless process in which mind and matter inter­mingle in a ceaseless flux of life and form. Wo rlds are created and destroyed endlessly within the infinity of time and space, and there is no edge to space and no beginning to time. What ensures the continuity of this process from eon to eon? Bud­dhists reply that the particular sphere of existence of beings who have attained the fourth meditative concentration is never destroyed by the cyclic fury of the elements, and that a special wind from this sphere becomes instrumental in the creation of new worlds. It goes without saying that if the world is created by the evo­lutionary actions of beings, it is also destroyed by them. In the numerically definite cosmology, the structure of the world is quite simple: a square axis mundi, like a mountain with terraces, surrounded by ranges of mountains and four main continents. The lowest types of beings, such as hell beings and starving spirits, dwell below Mount Meru. Superior beings dwell in places progressively higher up the mountain; the realms of the highest gods are in the skies above the summit of Mount Meru. This vision of the world is closely related to the spiritual path followed by the Individualists, who seek personal salvation from the cycle of lives. From the Individualist per-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 43 spective, this world is created primarily by the evolutionary actions of beings, actions that are based on the concept of a self and the negative emotions that arise because of that concept; it is therefore a prison from which one must try to escape. It is a world of impure phenomena, an arena for the experience of suffering, which begins the moment a being takes physical form in that world. This cosmology reflects the ongoing drama of cyclic existence and the possibility of salvation from that exist­ence. Freedom from cyclic existence means transcending the phenomenal world, never again to be born into its vale of suf­fering. This is the so-called perfect peace, or nirva:r:ta, sought by the Individualists, who by virtue of their spiritual path aim to purify themselves of all defilements and become saints (arhant), and finally to extinguish themselves into a state of nonbeing, in much the same way that a flame dies out. In this cosmological system, the lower states of life are filled with intense suffering and the higher ones are filled with dis­tracting pleasures. None of these states is considered to be ap­propriate for the spiritual practice of those who seek libera­tion. Only the southern continent, which is known as the Land of Jambu, with its blend of suffering and pleasure, provides the rare circumstances in which people can conceive and prac­tice the methods that lead to liberation. For this reason, the Land of Jambu is accorded a privileged place in Buddhist cosmol­ogy. It was there that the Buddha Sakyamuni attained enlight­enment. Jarnbu is the land where the thousand buddhas of this Fortunate Age will appear. Therefore, the Land of Jambu is re­garded as the best of all possible worlds in which to be born. The Land of Jambu, in its original conception, probably re­ferred to the Indian subcontinent. Considering the description given of its inhabitants, however, the details of the Land of Jambu may apply to our entire planet. The area associated with the jambu tree, from which this name for Earth comes, seems to be a blend of ancient myth and geographical fact. The sketchy descriptions provided by Kongtrul and other Buddhist sources place the jambu tree on the shore of a lake behind a range of snow mountains due north of the center of India. This natu­rally leads to the impression that the jambu tree is associated"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"44 Myriad Worlds with sacred Lake Manasarovar, located high in the Himalayas at the foot of Mount Kailash. Providing further evidence of this connection, Kongtrul speaks of four rivers that originate in the vicinity of the lake, which might correspond to the four rivers that have their sources in the area of Lake Manasarovar and Mount Kailash. The fact that no jambu tree and associated won­ders are found in this region, however, lends support to a mythi­cal interpretation. The focus of the numerically definite cos­mology on a single world-system is attributable to the Indi­vidualist ideal of personal freedom from the chain of births that is inherent in this cosmology. To attain liberation, realization of both personal and phenomenal selflessness is required. The principal goal of the spiritual practice of the Individualist, how­ever, is the elimination of the tendency to cling to the idea of a personal self, which lies at the root of cyclic existence. Further­more, Individualists do not fully cultivate the \"skillful means\" aspect of the spiritual path: compassion and love. These two factors account for the limited vision of the universe that is held by the Individualists. To fathom the magnitude of infinite num­bers of world-systems being born and destroyed every moment requires a broader vision in one's spiritual view. It requires the courage of a bodhisattva, who cultivates great \"protecting com­passion\" for the infinite numbers of beings who, at every mo­ment, experience the misery of birth and death throughout in­finite universes. Furthermore, the sheer magnitude of the ap­parent reality of such infinite universes would be difficult to conceive if one did not cultivate the understanding that not only oneself but also all the infinite worlds and all the beings who inhabit them are empty of intrinsic existence, nothing more than the magical play of relativity and emptiness. Since the wider scope of the Universal Way is inconceivable to the Individualists, it stands to reason that their cosmology must be limited, accounting for only a limited number of world­systems. For the Individualists, the Buddha is simply a saint who is distinguished by the fact that he accumulated sufficient merit to exhibit the marks of a great being. Such buddhas can spread their beneficial and enlightening influence only within the limited sphere of a so-called third-order thousand world-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 45 system. Furthermore, only one such buddha can appear at any given time in such a system. After he has completed his work, such a buddha leaves the world and becomes extinct. This cosmology, however, is not refuted by other Buddhist schools of thought. It is intended for the benefit of individuals with a lesser level of spiritual maturity, as a basis for subse­quent higher understanding and as an integral part of a larger system of cosmology. As Kongtrul points out, every aspect of the Buddha's teaching is formulated for the benefit of a par­ticular type of aspirant, and each is therefore valid by virtue of its efficacy in directing a different type of being onto the path of freedom. The wheel of the Buddha's teaching turns as a re­sult of the force that is generated when the various needs and aspirations of living beings meet the compassion of the buddhas, but it is not a fixed, monolithic dogma. The Cosmology of the Wheel of Time Tantra The temporal and spatial presentation of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time57 and its explanation of the origin of the universe are found in the third and fourth chapters of Myriad Worlds. The Tantra of the Wheel of Time is concerned with the integration of macrocosm and microcosm into a coherent system as a basis for the type of tantric spiritual development that it teaches, and therefore it focuses on our own world-system. It does not present a cosmos that differs significantly in configuration from that described in the Individualists' cosmology. The Wheel of Time cosmology differs from that of the Individualists in that it has different names for the continents and oceans, different shapes for Mount Meru and the encircling mountain ranges, and so forth. This cosmology also introduces an important and elaborate concept of the motion of the planets and the stars in conjunction with the human breath, the four eras, and so forth, which forms the basis for a form of astrology that belongs to this tantra. This concept, as well as some terminology, was prob­ably borrowed from classical Indian thought and reworked. The Wheel of Time establishes a correspondence between the mac­rocosm and microcosm in terms of the formation of the uni­verse and fetal development, and between the configuration of the universe and the shape and size of the human body. In the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"46 Myriad Worlds fourth chapter, the process involved in the creation of the world is described in more detail and is more refined than that de­scribed in the Individualist system of Vasubandhu. The four eras (the eras of completion, three-quarters, two­quarters, and conflict) that mark the progressively descending vortex of time cycles in the Individualist system are associated in the Wheel of Time presentation with the country of Sambhala. In the third chapter of Myriad Worlds, Kongtrul cites the loca­tion of this country as being beyond the Himalayas, close to the northernmost extremity of the Land of Jambu. Wherever it may be, Sambhala is linked to the propagation of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time, one of the latest tantric systems to come to light. The first king of Sambhala, Sucandra, was said to have received the Wheel of Time Tantra from the Buddha himself at Dhanyakataka in southern India; upon returning to his coun­try, he made it the state religion. Kongtrul states that the kings of this country and their descendants will conquer the irreli­gious hordes of barbarians and reestablish the golden age throughout the twelve land masses of our world-system, one after the other. Only twenty-five kings of Sambhala are specifi­cally mentioned in the Wheel of Time Ta ntra, and the names of their descendants are not given. The twenty-fifth king of Sambhala will ascend the throne in the year 2327 C.E., and in the ninetieth year of his rule, a war will be waged from Sambhala in which the barbarians will be defeated and the Wheel of Time teaching will spread throughout the world. Kongtrul presents the information regarding Sambhala with­out commentary, relying on traditional sources. It is possible that Sambhala is not an actual place but an inner \"pure land\" symbolizing the spiritual wealth of our planet, which is con­stantly threatened by materialism. The wars periodically waged by the kings of Sambhala perhaps symbolize the desire of hu­manity to recover authentic values and spiritual insight. The Cosmology of Infinite Buddha-Fields The cosmology of infinite buddha-fields (buddha�etra) is unique to the Universal Way. Its sources can be found in a number of scriptures of the Universal Wa y, such as the Avataf!Zsaka Scrip­ture, the Saddharmapw:zqiarika, the Paiicavif!Zsatisahasrikaprajiia-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 47 paramitasutra, the Vimalakzrtinirdesasutra, and thcAcintyavimok?a. These scriptures convey the two most fundamental aspects of practice for those who aspire to the ideals of the bodhisattva: wisdom and skillful means. The transcendent wisdom (prajiiaparamita) scriptures allude to this cosmology, but they are concerned with the nature of reality rather than its various manifestations. They transmit the essential teaching that \"emp­tiness is (the ultimate nature of) form, and (the ultimate nature of) form is emptiness.\" This principle lays the foundation for the correct insight needed by bodhisattvas who are engaged in \"oceans\" of compassionate activity. The Avata1J1saka Scripture and other scriptures, however, introduce a grand cosmic play of infinite buddhas and bodhisattvas who are continuously engaged in teaching, demonstrating miracles, and practicing the ten perfections for the sake of others; they are concerned with the relative rather than with ultimate reality. The reason that this cosmology presents world-systems as buddha-fields may be found in the first chapter of Kongtrul's book. Scriptures of the Universal Way state that the infinite world-systems come into being not only because of the evolu­tionary actions of beings but also because of the interconnec­tions between buddhas and sentient beings. The scope of such vast and intricate interconnections is astounding. These inter­connections involve the compassion of the buddhas, the dis­positions and destinies of sentient beings, the natural laws of the universe, and the vows of the bodhisattvas. Through the interdependence of these factors (presumably including the creative mechanisms explained in the Individualist cosmology), myriad worlds appear in empty space. An absolute beginning of the universe is not posited in this system; instead, the uni­verse is conceived as a cycle without commencement that re­peats itself until all beings are liberated from the sufferings of cyclic existence. The text clearly states that the buddhas and bodhisattvas are instrumental in the manifestation of the universe. According to this view, the universe is therefore the ground and agency for awakening rather than a prison from which to escape. It is the playground for the miraculous powers of enlightened be­ings, the amphitheater in which the bodhisattvas practice their"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"48 Myriad Worlds skillful means to help others overcome their confusion. At this point, Kongtrul introduces the concept of \"bodhisattvas puri­fying buddha-fields\" (bodhisattviiniirrz buddhak?etraparisodhana) but does not explain it in detail. This is an important concept that is often discussed in reductive terms because its full im­port is otherwise difficult to grasp. It is explained to some ex­tent by the Buddha in the scripture The Holy Te achings of Vimalakirti (expertly translated into English by Robert Thurman). In that scripture, the Buddha states that the buddha­fields in which the bodhisattvas practice are fields of living beings. This would seem to indicate that the buddha-fields are the living beings themselves, as well as the environments that they inhabit. In the course of their practice of the ten perfec­tions, the bodhisattvas work to lead others to spiritual matu­rity by various means. Consequently, the bodhisattvas' aspira­tions to lead all others to complete awakening constitute an important condition in the process of the formation of world­systems. Once the worlds arise, the bodhisattvas enter all of them for incalculable eons in order to benefit the beings who are born in those worlds. In stark contrast to the Individualist's intention to escape the world and terminate cyclic existence by means of personal awakening, bodhisattvas actually contrib­ute to the creation of new worlds in which they may fulfill their heroic vows to liberate all beings. Beings see the purity of the realms in which they dwell according to their own levels of inner purity, but the realms themselves are pure from the very beginning. This fact is clearly illustrated in The Holy Te achings of Vimalakirti, which states that the Buddha touched the ground with his big toes and our universe was transformed into radi­ant jewels of infinite light. The Buddha then informed Sariputra that the universe is always pure, but in order to effect the spiri­tual maturity of beings, it appears to be flawed. The primary element in the buddha-fields cosmology is the infinity of space and light, which replaces the static model of Mount Meru and the four continents that is expounded in the numerically definite world-systems cosmology. The former cosmology encompasses an infinite number of worlds in space, whose arrangement lies beyond the reach of rational thought."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 49 These worlds appear in all conceivable, as well as inconceiv­able, dimensions and shapes, some resting on lotuses and jew­els, others supported solely by the blessings of the buddhas. These worlds suffuse the ten directions; millions of worlds in­terpenetrate one another, and each world contains billions of others. Billions more are contained within each atom of each world. This is a cosmology whose monumental scope serves to open the mind to the unlimited, unfathomable, nonrational aspects of the universe. As a result, the mind breaks out of the cage of fixed concepts of definite space and existence and en­ters the open space of myriad worlds without beginning or end, beyond all fixed dimensions of size and shape. This cos­mology also conveys the bodhisattva conception of enlighten­ment, which is the spiritual development of all living beings throughout the universe as the primary path of one's own search for awakening. It would have been appropriate for Kongtrul to begin his work with a description of Endurance, our own uni­verse, and to have proceeded from the particular to the univer­sal, from the limited cosmology of Mount Meru to the unlim­ited skies of the infinite buddha-fields. Out of respect for his own tradition, the Universal Way, however, he presents the mysterious space odyssey of infinite buddha-fields before ex­ploring the particular details of our own world. All that is described is contained within the \"sphere of real­ity\" (dharmadhtitu), the ultimate realm that contains everything that exists. This sphere never changes, never becomes anything other than itself. It always remains empty of true existence. The countless realms that appear throughout the universe all mani­fest within this single realm: they exist within it and are de­stroyed within it. From the point of view of their ultimate na­ture, no realms have ever appeared, have ever been inhabited, have ever been destroyed. Nevertheless, in relative terms, infi­nite world-systems arise as phantom appearances based on interdependent connections, and these worlds serve the pur­poses of enlightened beings who act as spiritual guides, realiz­ing that these realms have no ultimate reality. The unenlight­ened beings who inhabit these realms also have no ultimate reality; they cling, however, to the idea that they, their worlds,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"50 Myriad Worlds and their experiences are ultimately real. The sphere of reality and the interdependent manifestations within it can be per­ceived simultaneously only by the eye of a buddha. The place of ordinary sentient beings in this display is ex­plained by Kongtrul in the first chapter, where he states that the appearance of beings in these realms is the result of their failure to recognize their own nature--emptiness-a nature that they share with the realms into which they are born, the buddhas, and everything else that exists. The fundamental na­ture of each being is buddha-nature, the potential to awaken from the slumber of ignorance. The only difference between buddhas and sentient beings is that the former have attained freedom through their awareness of their original empty na­ture, while the latter remain imprisoned in their phantom worlds of suffering because of their lack of awareness of the empty nature of all phenomena. Misunderstanding their ac­tual condition, sentient beings wander into realms that are the products of their own tendencies. The course of the experience of cyclic existence unfolds through the twelve links of interde­pendent origination, which Kongtrul delineates in detail, tak­ing into account the perspectives of different Buddhist systems. Within the Universalist cosmology of infinite buddha-fields, which is linked with the theory of the buddha-nature (tathagatagarbha), it is apparent that the basis of the confusion experienced by beings, which has no fixed beginning in time, also forms the basis of awakening from that very confusion. In other words, one's actual state of being is the ground for both confusion and enlightenment. Each person must unearth the buddha-nature from the depths of delusion in the same way that a miner digs a precious jewel from the muck and mire of a mine. In order for that buddha-nature to reveal itself, however, two factors must coincide: the compassion of the buddhas, which takes the form of enlightened spiritual guides; and the practice of the spiritual path by sentient beings. The practice of the spiritual path is based on the understanding of one's limi­tations and potential as well as the defects of cyclic existence. For this reason, Kongtrul writes extensively on various causes and results that play a fundamental role in the deceptive state"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 51 of existence, viewing them from the perspectives of both the Individualist and the Universalist systems. Among the three dimensions of awakening (kaya), the enjoy­ment dimension (smrzbhogakaya) holds a special place in the Universal Way, reflecting the richness and fullness of the spiri­tual path of the Universal Way and its final result. The Univer­sal Way is inspired by the resolve to attain enlightenment for the sake of all living beings, and therefore the welfare of others always takes priority over other more relative aspects of train­ing, such as ethics. Thus, in pictorial representations, buddhas in the enjoyment dimension of awakening are depicted not as monks but as princes and princesses adorned with jewels and fine clothes. It is this form of the buddhas that plays such an important part in the Universalist cosmology. This form, or di­mension, is associated with the pure realm called Unsurpassed (Akani$fha). According to the teachings, the Unsurpassed realm is the \"place\" where every buddha attains enlightenment. Kongtrul, however, makes the remarkable statement that the Unsurpassed realm is \"any place\" where a being attains en­lightenment. This statement sets the stage for Kongtrul's dis­cussion of the Flower-Filled World, a world-system that con­tains our world, Endurance. Kongtrul implies that wherever a being attains enlighten­ment, an Unsurpassed realm manifests spontaneously, complete with a palace, marvelously adorned with every imaginable pre­cious ornament. The enlightened being becomes the lord of this realm, taking form as Buddha Illuminator (Vairocana), Great Glacial Lake of Wisdom, the enjoyment dimension of awaken­ing, undifferentiated from all the buddhas of the ten directions. Illuminator also holds a special place in the Universalist cos­mology, probably because he symbolizes purity of form, the form that constitutes the entire universe. The magnitude of this cosmology is apparent in the statement that within each pore of Illuminator's body, infinite world-systems appear, and within each atom of these worlds is an infinity of other worlds and infinite forms of Illuminator. Each form of Illuminator in turn contains infinite buddhas and buddha-fields. Illuminator en­compasses the entire universe, and the entire universe consti-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"52 Myriad Worlds tutes Illuminator. If Kongtrul means to say that every being who attains enlightenment becomes the embodiment of this vast display of worlds and that all these worlds are encom­passed by such a being, then in the light of the infinite number of buddhas of the ten directions, we are presented with an in­conceivable, unfathomable image of a cosmos where the par­ticular includes the universal and the universal is included within the particular; in other words, everything includes and is included within everything. Our world, Endurance, is an infinitesimal part of this grand cosmic display, the thirteenth in a series of tiered world-sys­tems that rest in an ocean of infinite world-systems, all of which rest in the palm of Buddha Illuminator. It is part of the uni­verse called the Flower-Filled Wo rld, whose dimensions are billions of times greater than the third-order thousand world­system described in the numerically definite cosmology. It is the field of influence of a single manifest dimension of awak­ening (nirmfliJakaya). A distinction is made between Illumina­tor as the central figure in Unsurpassed and his manifestations throughout the other universes in order to emphasize that in the Universal Way, the primary method of bringing disciples to spiritual maturity is to explain the doctrine to them, which can only be accomplished by a buddha who manifests in a form that is visible to all beings. In the fourth chapter of Myriad Wo rlds, Kongtrul explores the mechanisms through which beings experience the deception of cyclic existence from the Individualist, Universalist, and ex­ceptional perspectives. He divides the exceptional perspective into two parts: the mechanism of cyclic existence, based on what he calls the \" definite teaching\" (which is probably derived from the third cycle of the Buddha's doctrine); and the view of Dzog­chen, or the \"Great Perfection.\" Kongtrul states that in the first cycle of the Buddha's teach­ing, the primal cause of cyclic existence is cited as self-habit. This is basically the sense of a permanent identity, the habit of clinging to the idea of an independent self, whereas only a rela­tive self, imputed on the basis of the five aggregates, actually exists. Not only is the self regarded as devoid of independent existence, but so is consciousness, which constitutes an impor-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 53 tant basis for the designation of the self and serves as the means whereby the person experiences the outer world. In the third cycle of the Buddha's teaching, the cause of this situation is held to be fundamental consciousness. Fundamental con­sciousness is a storehouse of imprints left by the actions of a person. These imprints produce a dualistic impression of a per­ceiving consciousness and perceived phenomena, perpetuat­ing delusion. The first part of the discussion of the exceptional system em­phasizes the luminous and empty nature of the mind. The lu­minous and empty nature of the mind is the very buddha-na­ture that, when discovered within oneself, opens the gate to enlightenment. As long as this nature remains unrecognized, however, dualistic appearances continue to arise. Habitual in­volvement with these dualistic apprehensions produces \"in­stincts\" based on perceptions of external objects, subjective experiences, and the possession of a physical body. Later, these instincts express themselves in the outer world, in perceiving consciousness, and in embodied existence. Evolutionary actions performed during the course of life then produce further in­stincts that perpetuate cyclic life. The methods used to tran­scend cyclic life are not discussed extensively in these four chap­ters, since they are discussed in subsequent books of The Infi­nite Ocean of Knowledge. Kongtrul does, however, briefly men­tion the method of transcending cyclic life by terminating in­volvement in the twelve links through the realization that the idea of the self, which constitutes the first link of the chain of unawareness, is devoid of intrinsic reality. The Non-Cosmology of the Dzog-chen System In the last part of the fourth chapter of Myriad Worlds (presented as Chapter V in this translation), Kongtrul draws extensively from the Ts ig-don-dzo (Tshig don mdzod) of Longchenpa, provid­ing a concise but highly illuminating account of the perspec­tive held by followers of the Dzog-chen system. His discussion deals primarily with the mechanism of the arising of condi­tioned existence; he does not go into details about cosmology, which is not a major concern in the Dzog-chen system. The Dzog-chen presentation of the origin of cyclic existence is"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"54 Myriad Worlds unique in that it defines the universe as primordial purity. Kongtrul clearly states that the Dzog-chen system stands at the summit of spirituality. In the Dzog-chen system, the primal creative cause of the universe is neither the evolutionary actions of beings nor the interrelationships of the compassion of the buddhas and sen­tient beings, but rigpa, a state of pure and total awareness. This state of awareness is nothing other than the primordially pure ground of being itself (gzhi). Cyclic life is thus regarded as sim­ply the arousal or excitement of the pure state of awareness \"straying away from itself.\" The concept of awareness straying from itself is only a metaphor, because awareness can never stray from itself. When manifestations arise from the ground of being and are not recognized as the ground of being itself or the play of pure awareness, however, the delusion of cyclic existence begins. Failure to recognize the primordially pure nature of the ground of being is unawareness, which itself arises from intrinsic awareness. The process operates as fol­lows: first, the ground of being manifests as five pure lights, but because of their unawareness, beings view these lights as concrete objects. For this reason, appearances themselves con­stitute deception. Metaphorically speaking, when the seal that keeps the total and pure awareness in the original ground of being is broken, the creativity of intrinsic awareness arises and the entire uni­verse, which is nothing more than the manifestation of one's intrinsic awareness, springs into being. This manifestation oc­curs in eight ways, which give rise to all the myriad realms of the buddhas' dimensions and of cyclic life. As the title of one of the principal tantras of Dzog-chen states, the total and pure state of awareness constitutes the \"Majestic Creative Principle of the Universe.\" It is believed in this system of thought that if the original ground of being is primordially pure, every sentient being is enlightened all along; therefore, beings are not impeded by any real limitations. All beings are by nature endowed with the same wisdom and other qualities that are possessed by buddhas, for in the state of pure and total awareness, everything is already complete and perfect. Both freedom and deception arise as the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 55 play of the excitement of the awareness, and the ground of being forms the basis for both without belonging to either state. One's own enlightened nature must, however, become revealed through a \"reawakening.\" Drawing from Longchenpa, Kongtrul explains the method of awakening in the Dzog-chen system, calling it the \"Liberation as Ever-Perfect,\" as the pri­mordial buddha Samantabhadra. Aw akening occurs in the fol­lowing way: when objectifying thoughts, which are nothing more than the movement of pure and total intrinsic awareness, arise, one does not regard them as concrete, realizing instead that they are one's own inner radiance manifesting outwardly. When this insight dawns, the movements of thought cease spon­taneously, without any need for meditation or other artificial techniques to transform or terminate them. At that instant, full realization is attained, and the wisdom and other qualities of a buddha are manifested. Liberation as Ever-Perfect does not refer to the liberation of a buddha that has occurred in the past, such as that of Buddha Sakyamuni, but to the way in which countless beings are liber­ated right now and will continue to be liberated in the future simply by realizing their primordial purity. The basis, the path, and the ultimate result in this system are all of a singular, un­differentiated nature: total, pure awareness. Thus, the primor­dial freedom that one seeks to attain by practicing the spiritual path is something that one already possesses. Intrinsic freedom is itself the path that leads to the actualization of the goal. The different systems of Buddhist cosmology are thus directly correlated with the ways in which sentient beings are drawn into cyclic existence, as well as with the various spiritual paths that provide the opportunity to be free. In the Individualist system, cyclic existence and the worlds in which it transpires must be transcended in order to attain the perfect peace of one's own liberation. By contrast, the followers of the Universal Way also aim to transcend cyclic existence, but not in order to abide eternally in a state of static peace; instead, they attain the \"dy­namic perfect peace\" of a buddha in order to work unceasingly for the welfare of others. The Tantric Way symbolized by the Wheel of Time cosmology, however, goes a step further by teach­ing that cyclic life and transcendence of cyclic life have the same"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"56 Myriad Worlds basis; therefore, cyclic life should be transformed rather than renounced. Tantra teaches that the actualization of the perfect peace of transcendence is found within the world itself and within the body, through the understanding that life and the transcendence of life are indivisible in the ultimate reality. Kongtrul states that an understanding of the Dzog-chen view of cyclic life is essential if one is to understand the path and the result of this system. The Dzog-chen perspective holds that everything emerges spontaneously from the primordially pure nature of being, that everything always remains primordially pure, and that when this truth is recognized within one's own natural awareness (rang byung ye shes), one instantly recovers one's original enlightened nature, which has been there all along. Myriad Worlds contains invaluable material for study, reflec­tion, and the refinement of one's mind.

[I.B.l] The Title's Literal Meaning With regard to its structure, The Encompassment of All Knowl­edge is a compilation of the essentials from all treatises that present the distinct systems for spiritual development of gods and hu­mans and the Buddha's three-or nine-stage system.4 [In the title,] approaches refers to these systems. In nature, The Encompassment of All Knowledge is a compre­hensive collection of the most important explanations from the Transcendent One's own teachings and from the treatises com­menting on them. Therefore, this work is called treasury be­cause those precious teachings are contained within it, or be­cause this [treasury] is inherent within [those teachings]."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Introduction 81 In character, this treatise5 clearly, thoroughly, and effectively transmits the three trainings of higher ethics, meditation, and wisdom. It has the qualities that enable one to overcome the enemy of emotions, and to protect oneself from [rebirth in] miserable existences. It is distinct from the six [types of] flawed treatises and possesses the qualities of the three [types of] valid treatises.6 These latter words, \"treatise that effectively transmits the three trainings,\" refer principally to the subject matter [of the work]. Just as space makes it possible for an observer to discern ob­jects, the contents of this treatise make it possible for the intel­lect to discern all objects of knowledge. Therefore, the contents are an encompassment of all knowledge. Alternatively, just as space is the medium through which the universe and beings unfold, this [work] allows the three kinds of wisdom7 to unfold. This [part of the title] refers principally to [the words] that convey the contents. [I.B.2] The Five Essential Observations The resident scholars of Vikramasila Monastery8 expounded treatises by making five kinds of essential observations: (1) Who the author [of the treatise] is (2) What its scriptural sources are (3) How it is classified (4) For whose benefit it is written (5) What the import of the work as a whole is These observations may be made with regard to the present work. First, the identity of the author is stated at the end of the work; in the colophon, his various names are stated. The sec­ond is explained by [the words of the title,] compiled from the approaches of all the systems of spiritual development. The third is indicated by [the words] a treasury of precious teachings . Fourth, there are two [possible motivations for composing such a work]: to benefit oneself or to benefit others. I have not composed this work in response to others' requests. Instead, I have been motivated by the noblest intention to benefit others"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"82 Myriad Worlds and by [the wish] to refine my own understanding of all knowl­edge. This is implied by the words, the encompassment of all knowledge. Fifth, the nature of the content is conveyed by the words the treatise that effectively transmits the three trainings. [I.B.3] The Style of the Commentary, The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge A treatise may be classified [as one of] two kinds of commen­tary on the words of the Buddha: general or specific. Since this work encompasses all fields of knowledge, it should be re­garded as a general commentary. [I.C] Elimination of Doubts Concerning the Title One might question whether it is logical to give a Sanskrit title to a Tibetan treatise because it is not a translation from that language. However, there is no fault in doing so. Such a title is both logical and meaningful because this work is based on the teachings of the Buddha and commentaries originating in In­dia. This is comparable to calling Indian a person who is ethni­cally Indian but has been born in Tibet. In doing so, I have imitated the works of the Tibetan scholar Thumi, the writings of the sagacious Longchenpa, and others. Although this is like a firefly [trying to] imitate the sun, there is no wrong in my wish to emulate [these masters] because my intention is pure. [II] EXPRESSIONS OF REVERENCE This section has four parts: (1) reverence to the illustrious spiri­tual master, composed in Sanskrit; (2) reverence to the Lord of Sages (Buddha Sakyamuni), based on the three trainings; (3) praise and supplication for the fulfillment of my wishes to the Lion of Speech (Mafijusri), based on the path of the perfections9; and (4) bowing with devotion to the master and the lineage, based on the stages of the Secret Mantra path.10 J"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"[II.A] Reverence to the Illustrious Spiritual Master NamaJ.l srtmaqt-sad-guru-padaya Introduction 83 This reverence, in Tibetan dPal ldan bla ma dam pa' i zhabs la phyag 'tshallo, means \"I bow at the feet of the illustrious11 and genu­ine master.\" There are two parts [to the discussion of these words of rever­ence]: (1) their context, and (2) an explanation of their meaning. [II.A.l] Context Appropriate circumstances for expressing reverence include to serve a purpose, for a [particular] reason, to resolve contradic­tory opinions, to respond to a question, and so forth. These words of reverence are written to serve a particular purpose. The explanation of the purpose served by this reverence is based on the [words] \"I bow at the feet.\" To whom is reverence expressed? It is expressed to the illustrious and genuine mas­ter who embodies the perfection of all refuges. Who is express­ing reverence? The author of the treatise is expressing rever­ence with great devotion in thought, word, and deed. What is the purpose of expressing reverence? Those who read the praise of such a unique individual will develop faith in that person. Furthermore, discerning readers will first develop confidence in the person who expresses such respect, because by doing so, he is following [the example of] authentic masters. Conse­quently, they will consider the treatise composed by this per­son worth studying and will do so. The expression of rever­ence serves the additional purposes of completing the cultiva­tion of merit and pristine wisdom and of preventing interrup­tions to the completion of the composition.

Grounded in the [experience of the union of] emptiness and appearance, the master has travelled the path, using skillful means and wis­dom. As a result, he or she \"possesses\" (-mant) the fruition [of the path], the unity of pristine wisdom and the dimensions of awakening, and leads disciples to the same attainment. Master in [Sanskrit] is guru, which means laden with good qualities, and uttara, [which means] \"highest.\" The [Sanskrit] word sat has many meanings, but in this case denotes\" genuine.\" Since this signifies perfection, [it describes] one who is master of masters. From the King of Tantras12: An illustrious master is one in whose mind and speech the face of the Buddha is present. The Buddha [referred to in this quote] is Wheel of Time (Kala­cakra). His four faces symbolize the four successive empower­ments, the fourth of which is the co-emergent pristine wisdom [empowerment]. One who embodies this wisdom is known as an illustrious master since he or she has realized it and reveals it to disciples through speech. The above words of reverence are addressed to my own spiri­tual master from whom I have obtained a measure of his kind­ness [through receiving such instruction]. The words at the feet indicate that I bow [before him] and show reverence with heart­felt devotion. [II.

The three types of training are common denominators in the three systems of spiritual development. The sequence of the three trainings in the words of reverence above corresponds to the tradition most accessible to ordinary people, that of the proclaimers.20 Therefore, it would have been appropriate for me to compose the commentary, The Infinite Ocean of Knowl­edge, based on this tradition.21 [However, my commentary pre­sents the trainings] in the sequence followed by the Buddha's Way [the Universal Way].22"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"86 Myriad Worlds [II.

Seeing this, I have been motivated by the noble intention to benefit my­self and others, who like me have neither sufficient good fortune nor power of intelligence to comprehend even minor texts,30 let alone the voluminous scriptures of the Buddha. Due to good propensities developed in the past, we have landed on this treasure-island of precious discourses and tantras.

The first element presented should be the purpose of the trea­tise. A synopsis should then summarize what fulfills that purpose, while the explanation itself presents in detail the mean­ing of [what is summarized in] the synopsis. The connections, which should not contradict the sequence [of the subjects], and counter-arguments, which should not contradict reason, are discussed wherever appropriate. For the first of these, [purpose, Vasubandhu presented] an elaborate analysis of the purpose, the connections, [etc.,] in which each of the four points are divided into three parts.

Second is the purpose: By studying and expounding these subjects, one becomes well-versed in them. This education re­sults in the wisdom that allows one to understand the levels of the Buddha's teachings and his systems for spiritual develop­ment.

Second, the fields of knowledge that should be known by novices-those unfamiliar with these subjects-are presented in ten divisions within this work.

Fourth, these forty chapters together comprise an explana­tion of the three trainings. Training in higher ethics is explained by the fifth division; training in wisdom, by the sixth and sev­enth; and training in meditation, principally by the eighth.

Further: Many oceans of realms exceed all boundaries and rest in a vast sea of lotuses. Further: Vast oceans of realms rest within the buddhas' blessing. The existence of these realms depends upon the four elements, the actions of sentient beings, the blessings of the buddhas, and so forth. These realms appear in a variety of configurations such as intersecting, upside-down, and right-side-up. Second, distinctions according to shape11 : Some realms are round, some are triangular, Some appear square,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"100 Myriad Worlds Some are [shaped like] eight-spoked wheels, jewels, or lotuses; All are designed by the oceans of actions [of beings]. Third, [distinctions according to] size: Each of the ten world-systems from Saffron Banner up to Resplendent Lotus increases in size and qualities by factors of ten. [Certain realms] that are manifesting now, such as DelightfuP2 and Blissful, 13 are vast, whereas our own realm, Endurance, and even more so Thumb-Size14 (the realm of the buddha called Delight in Stars), and other [realms], are extremely small. The realm of All-Seeing Guide that will manifest in the future, Pure Cluster, will be immeasurably vast. There are many [descriptions] such as these. Fourth, [distinctions according to] duration15 : Some realms [endure] for just an eon, Some for ten eons, Some realms are said [to endure For] ten million eons times the number of their particles. Fifth, distinctions according to the arrangements of the decorations16: Some realms are richly embellished With the millions of realm-adornments. These diversified ornaments of various styles Appear as myriad optical illusions. Some distinctions according to the presence ofbuddhas are ex­pressed in these words17: In some realms, there are no buddhas; In some realms, there are buddhas; In some realms, there is one buddha; In some, many buddhas. [Concerning distinctions according to] light, 18 In some realms, there is no light. Beginning with this reference to realms that are dark, fearsome, and terrifying, there follows19: In some, the light of the gods, Similarly/0 [some realms are illuminated by] ... the light of palaces, ... the light of the sun and moon,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Cosmology of the Universal Way 101 ... natural light, light of trees, ... light of mountains, ... light of jewels, ... light of lamps, ... light of buddhas. Further21 In some realms, there is the light of lotuses. And: In [others], the light of fragrant waters. And: These realms have been purified through the power of bodhisattvas' vows. Whether or not [a world-system] comprises four continents forms another distinction. Our own third-order thousand world-system22 is divided into many four-continent [world­systems], whereas Blissful, as well as some other realms, are flat like the palm of a hand. Among those that comprise [four continents], there are many different sizes [of continents]. There are also distinctions regarding enjoyment. In Truly Joy­ous, for instance, the gods wish to be human. The massive mountain [that forms the axis of a four-continent world-sys­tem] can differ [from one realm to another]. Differences also exist in the forms of life: some beings have emotions, while others embody purity, and so on. Worlds exist in an inconceiv­able variety of ways. [II.

[II.B.l] Overall Explanation Within the central minute particle in the palm of his hand lies the Oceanic World-System That itself contains many world-systems, in the center of which Lies the realm called Flower-Filled World."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"102 Myriad Worlds Within the single minute particle in the very center of the palm of the hand of [the Buddha] Illuminator, Great Glacial Lake of Wisdom, lies the Oceanic World-System which rests in the cen­ter of the Enlightened One's palm. Furthermore, Great Glacial Lake of Wisdom himself manifests throughout this world-sys­tem as an enlightened teacher. The magnitude of this incon­ceivable place is the sphere of experience solely of buddhas and bodhisattvas who dwell on the [three] higher stages [of awakening]. Numerous world-systems are found within the Oceanic World-System. In the center of these lies Flower-Filled World,23 the realm of the manifest dimension of awakening of Buddha Illuminator. [II.B.2] Detailed Explanation Furthermore, [between the wind] and Unsurpassed lie one billion four-continent world-systems, A great third-order thousand [world-system]. Multiplying that by factors of one billion [Yields] Infinite Links, Continuums, Oceans, And Flower-Filled World. Each rests on an ocean and [is encircled by] an outer rim. This is the sphere of influence of one supreme manifest dimension of awakening. The extent of the realm Flower-Filled World is determined in the following way: First of all, the area that includes the four continents, Mount Meru, and the outer rim of mountains - everything from the underlying configuration of wind24 up to Unsurpassed, the peak of existence- is referred to as a four-continent world-system. An identical world-system is located in space at a distance of one thousand times the magnitude of that world-system. A to­tal of one thousand such world-systems [evenly distributed in space], encircled by a rim, is referred to as a first-order thou­sand world-system. This considered as a single unit, replicated one thousand times and surrounded by a perimeter, is referred to as a second-order thousand world-system. One thousand [second-order thousand world-systems] enclosed by a great rim"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Cosmology of the Universal Way 103 is called a third-order thousand world-system. Thus, one bil­lion four-continent world-systems is called one great thousand third-order thousand world-system. (Although teachers of phenomenology25 base their calcula­tions on the area from the heaven [called] The Pure downwards, the description given here is based on the Marvellous Life of the Buddha, the Pure Golden Light Scripture, and other sources.) The total number of world-systems comprising one Flower­Filled World is calculated by progressively multiplying by fac­tors of one billion: One billion great thousand third-order thou­sand world-systems constitutes the world-system Infinite Links. A billion of those is the world-system Infinite Continuums. A billion of those is the world-system Oceanic Infinity. One bil­lion of those is the extent of one Flower-Filled World. Each world-system rests on its own great ocean and is encircled by a rim. At the same time, one great rim encircles them all. One [arrangement] of such dimension constitutes the sphere of influence of a single supreme manifest dimension of awak­ening. To those of limited intelligence, [the sphere of influence] is taught to be only a third-order thousand world-system.

Within the great outer rim of that [arrangement of one] Flower­Filled World are the indescribable oceans of fragrant waters [descending from] the body of Great Glacial Lake, as numer­ous as the particles in all the buddha realms. In the center of these oceans are seas of scented waters filled with beautiful anthers on which rest four immense jewelled lotuses."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"104 Myriad Worlds A tiered arrangement of twenty-five world-systems is sup­ported by these [lotuses]. In the spaces between each [of these world-systems] are infinite tiers of world-systems, which de­fine their boundaries. The thirteenth of these [twenty-five world-systems] is our own third-order thousand world-system, known as Endurance. The Sanskrit term for Endurance is saha, which denotes pos­session, forbearance, or capacity. All sentient beings who have taken birth in this realm endure emotions and sufferings. In other words, beings possess these [afflictions] in great measure. \"Endurance\" also signifies the forbearance of hardship. The bodhisattvas of this realm patiently endure [hardship] with ex­ceptional courage and excel in bravery. Thus, this realm is known as Endurance.

This is a single form whose vast emanations appear throughout all the Unsurpassed realms in the pure domains and teach the Dharma in the midst of all the powerful [bodhisattvas].26 The Centrist scholar Dharmamitra explains27: This form, differentiated [from others] by vows, the power of cultivation [of merit and pristine wisdom], and intention, has attained complete enlightenment in one Unsurpassed domain alone. Therefore, the myriad forms of the enjoyment dimension of awakening that dwell in all the [other] Unsur­passed realms are solely his apparition manifesting in a vast [display].28 This four-continent [world-system] called Destructible Is surrounded by ten other four-continent [world-systems]. Our four-continent world-system, which is situated in the cen­ter of Endurance, is known as Destructible. It is said that even this [world-system] alone is surrounded by ten other satellite four-continent world-systems. Beginning from the East, these are, respectively, Well Protected, Joyful, Unbearable, Excellent Essence, Befriended, Fine Land, Lion Inhabited, Well Formed. Above is Bearing Wealth, and below, Radiant Light. It is taught that these [world-systems] are formed and destroyed together; This is the experiential domain solely of the lords of the tenth stage of awakening. The view most widely shared by Buddhist systems is that [the worlds within] any single third-order thousand world-sys­tem are formed together and destroyed [together]. Another view states that all the realms of the emanations of a single supreme manifest dimension of awakening (such as the oceans of realms that are located in the Flower-Filled World) are formed and destroyed together.

The discussion of the initial formation of our world-system has two parts: (1) a description of the environment, and (2) a de­scription of the inhabitants. [II.A.1] The Environment This section has two parts: (1) the main explanation, and (2) a supplementary discussion of the viewpoint of the proclaimers and solitary sages.2 [The main explanation] has five parts: (1) the origin of the Fortunate Age, (2) the arrangement of the mountains and continents, (3) the meanings of the names of the continents, (4) [descriptions of] the three miserable realms and the demi-gods' realm, and (5) the realm of the gods. [II.A.l.a.i] The Origin of the Fortunate Age After the age of vacuity had elapsed at the end of the previous age, Winds arose from the ten directions, creating a configuration in the shape of a cross; Rain fell from a cloud, and amidst a mass of water, A thousand lotuses were seen; thus the Fortunate Age was proclaimed. The collective actions of beings and the power of the vows to purify realms3 made by the bodhisattvas of the present Fortu­nate Age produced the following sequence of events: After the previous age had reached completion and the twenty intermediate ages [that constitute] the age of vacuity had elapsed, winds arose from each of the ten directions.4 The powerful convergence and compression of these winds created a configuration of wind in the shape of a cross - solid, ex­tremely hard, and indestructible. In the space above the wind, a thick cloud resembling a golden yoke formed. From this cloud, rain fell continuously over a long period of time. The size of raindrops ranged from large [ones to raindrops as big as the diameter of] the main shaft of a chariot. This deluge produced an immense mass of water, supported by the wind. At the cen-"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Our Universe 109 ter of this great ocean, a thousand golden lotuses appeared. Upon seeing this, the gods and goddesses of the pure domains5 knew it to be a sign that one thousand buddhas would appear, and so they declared: \"How wonderful! This is the dawn of the Fortunate Age!\" According to the White Lotus of Compassion Scripture, this age is known as a fortunate one because the gods and goddesses made this announcement. Similarly, the Blos­somed Wisdom Scripture refers to this age as \"the age when one thousand lotuses are seen.\" [II.A.l.a.ii] Arrangement of the Mountains and Continents The churning of water by wind produced a golden disc, Upon which rain fell; [this became] the great ocean. The churning by wind developed the [ocean's] elements -superior, medium, and base; These elements formed Mount Meru, the seven mountain ranges, the four continents and the outer rim. The churning of the great mass of water by the wind produced a golden foundation6 above the water while rain continued to fall uninterruptedly. As a result, a great outer ocean [which contained various elements] formed above the golden disc. In­tense churning of the ocean by winds [arising from] various directions gradually developed the three grades of elements­superior, medium, and base. The superior elements became the central, massive Mount Meru, which is made of four precious substances. The elements of medium quality formed the seven ranges of golden mountains. The base elements formed the four continents, surrounded by the eight neighboring islands and many other islands, as well as the outer rim of iron mountains. On this subject, the master Vasubandhu explains in detail that the waters [of the ocean] contained only various poten­tials for the elements, [not the actual elements]. When these seeds were driven apart by winds with special agencies, the different types [of elements] were produced. The mountains and continents all extend eighty thousand [leagues] down into the ocean. Mount Meru rises eighty thousand [leagues] above the ocean."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"110 Myriad Wo rlds The base of Mount Meru and the bases of each of the seven mountain [ranges], the four continents, and the outer rim [of mountains] extend eighty thousand leagues7 below the ocean's surface and rest on [the golden disc called] Mighty. Mount Meru rises eighty thousand leagues above the surface of the ocean. The four sides of Mount Meru are composed of crystal, blue beryl, ruby, and gold. The sky [on each side] reflects these colors. From sea level to half its height are four terraces. [Viewed from above,] Mount Meru is square, with four square slabs [of decreasing size in ascending order]. The eastern face of Mount Meru is composed of crystal; the southern, blue beryl; the western, ruby; and the northern, gold. The color of each face is clearly reflected in the sky around it. Four [square] slabs form four tiers of terraces around Mount Meru, beginning at sea level and reaching halfway up its height. Beyond it are seven golden mountain ranges, Yoke and the others. The spaces between are filled with seas of enjoyment, which have eight qualities. Beyond Mount Meru and completely surrounding it like cur­tains are seven mountain ranges, each forming a square. These seven golden mountain ranges [are named according to the shape of their peaks:] Yoke, Plough, Acacia Forest, Pleasing-to­the-Eye, Horse's Ear, Bent, and Rim. The spaces between [the mountain ranges] are filled with what are known as the seven seas enjoyed [by the nagas8], the waters of which have eight qualities: cool, tasty, light, soft, clear, odorless, harmless to the throat if swallowed, and harmless to the stomach.

The four main continents have the following shapes: semi­circular, trapezoidal, round, and square, respectively. Moreover, the eight islands have the same shape as the principal conti­nent in their respective directions. There are numerous unspecified little islands. Only these twelve land masses are mentioned in the discourses of the Buddha since these are the principal ones. The Brahma1Ja Vyasa Scripture, however, enumerates sixteen large regions that surround the Land of Jambu alone, such as SiJ11. hala, Suvan:tadvipa, Tamradvipa, Togar, Kamboja.9 Moreover, the Inconceivable Secrets of the Transcendent Ones Scripture and other sources state that there are a thousand small lands [in this four­continent world-system]. In fact, an inestimable number of little islands whose names, dimensions, and shapes are not speci­fied [in the scriptures] are located adjacent to each of the four continents. The outer rim consists of a mountain range composed of iron; A salt-water ocean fills the area as far as this range. The outer iron mountain range, [called the Horse-faced] Moun­tain Range, surrounds the continents and forms the outer bor­der or outer rim [of this world-system]. This range is composed of volcanic iron. Except for the continents, the area beyond the golden mountains as far as the outer rim is filled with salt wa­ter and is known as the Salt Water Ocean. Furthermore, the edge of this ocean touches the Horse-faced Mountain Range; the volcanic fires of this mountain range cause the ocean [to evaporate so that it does] not exceed its limits.

Between these two mountain ranges lies Cool Lake; from its four sides Four cascades flow in four directions toward the ocean. A jambu tree adorns the lake's shore, And so this continent is known as the land beautified by the jambu tree. Why is the Land of Jambu known by this name? Situated to the north of the center10 of the Exalted Land (India), in the region beyond nine black mountain ranges, stands a snow-peaked mountain range called the Snowy Mountains11 and further north, the Fragrant Mountain RangeY Between these two mountain ranges lies a lake that is the dwelling place of the naga king, Cool. The lake itself is known as CooF3 for [this rea­son:] In the past, a brahmin named Seer [encouraged a wheel­monarch14] to make offerings in order to attain [rebirth as] a god or as a wheel-monarch. [During a twelve-year period of cooking rice for offerings,] the wheel-monarch poured the warm rice-water [into a pit] where it [eventually] lost its warmth. Cool Lake formed [from this cooled rice-water]. The lake, the source of all rivers, forests, jewels, and medicines, is fifty leagues in depth and breadth. The four cascades issue from mouths on each of the four sides of the lake. On the eastern side, from a cliff shaped like an elephant's head, falls the river Ganga, drawing along with it silver particles. On the southern side, from a cliff the shape of a bull's head, falls the river Sindhu, carrying particles of blue beryl. On the western side, from a cliff the shape of a horse's head, falls the river Vak�u, carrying crystal particles. On the northern side, from a rock the shape of a lion's head, the river SWi15 descends, carrying gold particles. Moreover, each of these four rivers has five hundred tributaries, and all flow seven times in a clockwise direction around Cool Lake before continuing in the four directions toward the great ocean. At the shore of the lake stands a fruit tree called the jambu,16 which bears a sweet fruit the size of a clay pot, named \"jambu\" from the sound made by the ripened fruit falling into the wa­ter. Since this continent is adorned by this tree, it is known as"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Our Universe 113 the Land of Jambu. It is said that the niiga kings, appearing as fish, eat the jambu fruit; what remains uneaten becomes the gold of the rivers of J ambu. The names of Majestic Body and the others indicate their distinguishing features. The names of the three other continents - Majestic Body, etc. - indicate their distinguishing features. [In the eastern conti­nent, Majestic Body,] the human body is remarkably majestic. [In the western continent, Bountiful Cow,] the wish-fulfilling cow provides an abundance of wealth. [In the northern conti­nent, Unpleasant Sound,] the sun sometimes becomes covered with clouds due to the mischief of unruly nagas. Consequently, drums and stringed instruments, etc., sound unpleasant: their appealing music becomes a cacophony. For these reasons, the continents are known by their respective names. Tail-Fan Island is inhabited by cannibal demons, and the others, by humans. Among the twelve continents and islands, Tail-Fan Island, one of the islands of Jambu, is inhabited only by cannibal demons,17 while all the rest are populated by humans. The humans on these islands resemble those living on their adjacent principal continent. The Tibetan term for human, mi, principally implies mental capacity or aptitude and is derived from the [Sanskrit] manu?ya, which d .. motes aptitude or discernment. [II.A.l.a.iv] The Three Miserable Realms and the Demi-gods' Realm The hells and the world of the starving spirits are located below the earth. Animals, the inhabitants of the depths, dwell in the great ocean. Demi-gods [live] in the crevices of Mount Meru from the water's edge down. Of the six kinds of beings, the human realm has been discussed [above]; a description of the three miserable existences now follows:"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"114 Myriad Worlds The hells and [the world of] the starving spirits18 are located mainly below the surface of the earth. The eight hot hells are situated [in the lowest positions]. The most intense hot hell, Ceaseless Torture, is located twenty thousand leagues below the Land of Jambu. Above this hell, the other seven hot hells are situated one above the other: Extreme Heat, Heat, Loud Shrieking, Shrieking, Crushing, Black Lines, and Reviving. On each of the four sides of each of the eight hells are the four neighboring hells: [1] Pit of Live Embers, [2] Swamp of Filth, [3] Road of Razor Blades, [Forest with] Leaves Like Swords, Forest of Iron Spikes, and [4] River Without Ford. The eight cold hells are located beyond the neighboring hells. Their names are Blistering, Blisters Bursting, Teeth Chattering, Moaning with Cold, Wailing with Cold, Splitting Like a Blue Lotus, Splitting Like a Lotus, Splitting Widely Like a [Great] Lotus. Since the continents resemble piles of grain, much larger at the bottom, there is no inconsistency in accommodating these [hells below this Land of Jambu]. Moreover, it is unnecessary to strictly define the size of these formations since the hells, according to the Universal Way, are simply projections of one's own mind. Hells of shorter duration may be either isolated from one another or clustered together and have no fixed location. Their variety is due to specific acts particular to an individual. The Sanskrit word for hell, naraka, is constructed by affixing the negative particle na to the word raka, which means \"plea­surable.\" This implies that there is no vestige of pleasure [in the hells]. Alternatively, if raka is interpreted as \"to take,\" [the term] means \"hell\" because one is led there as a consequence of unwholesome actions. The king of the starving spirits, Lord of the Dead, lives five hundred leagues below the Land of Jambu. According to the Great Mindfulness Scripture, he rules over thirty-six [types of] starving spirits: those with drooping stomachs, those with mouths as minute as the eye of a needle, etc. [The abode of the Lord of the Dead] is their principal habitat, but they live in many other places. Furthermore, [the Mindfulness Scripture states that] J"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Our Universe 115 some starving spirits who possess miraculous powers (such as the demi-gods who are classified as starving spirits) experience splendorous lives like those of the gods. The Tibetan term for starving spirit, yi dwags, corresponds to the [Sanskrit] preta. Preta means completely gone, in other words, departed [from this life] without possibility of return. Alternatively, [yi dwags denotes] suffering greatly from hunger and thirst. Animals inhabit the sky, the water, and vast stretches of the earth. Their principal habitat, however, is the great ocean where animals such as nagas inhabit the depths, living [crowded to­gether], like fermenting grains of beer. [The abode of] the demi-gods is not explicitly mentioned in Vasubandhu's Treasury of Phenomenology. However, the Great Mindfulness Scripture states that the demi-gods dwell in crev­ices in the base of Mount Meru below the water level. A par­ticular kind of demi-god classified as an animal lives at the bottom of the ocean; the chief demi-gods- Rahu, Garland Necklace, and others-live at [different] levels above the ocean floor. The [Tibetan] term for animal, dud 'gro, means \"moving stooped over,\" because animals move around in a bent-over position. The [Sanskrit] word tiras [from which tiryafic (animal) is derived] seems to refer to the predominant postures for loco­motion since the term denotes being bent over, crooked, or hori­zontal. The Tibetan term for demi-god, lha min, is derived from the [Sanskrit] asura, meaning \"deprived of the essence.\" The demi­gods are said to lack the ambrosia of the gods. Alternatively, sura means \"god,\" to which the negative particle a is affixed to imply inferiority, [i.e., less than a god].

Below the tree lies a square stone slab known as Armoniga,22 which looks like a white blanket. Each of its sides is fifty leagues long, making it two hundred leagues in perimeter. The circular Gathering Place Where the Gods Hear the Ex­cellent Law, nine hundred leagues in circumference, is located southwest of Lovely. In its center is the golden throne on which Indra teaches the law of the gods and the seats arranged for the thirty-two Nearly as Powerful chiefs.

In Flourishing Virtue, the bliss of the gods increases greatly; no class of gods embodies greater virtue than this one. The fourth level of meditative concentration is divided into [eight heavens]: Cloudless, Merit-Born, Great Result, Not Greater, Without Distress, Manifest Richness, Good Vision, and Unsurpassed. The first three are the heavens of ordinary be­ings: Cloudless lacks a basis of billowing, clustering clouds [that all the other heavens have]. Gods are born in Merit-Born due to the merit of their unwavering [contemplation].29 In Great Result, the conditions of life (\"the result\") are superior to those of ordinary beings in other heavens. [The latter five heavens are the] \"pure domains.\" Not Greater has no qualities greater than those of the higher pure heavens. Owing to their attainment of a unique state of contemplation, the gods of Without Distress remain free of the distress of emo­tions and regret. Manifest Richness reflects perfect tranquillity and unmatched beauty. In Good Vision, the gods' outlook or vision is correct and good. Unsurpassed is so called because within this group of heavens no other heaven surpasses the qualities of this one. This heaven is also known as Final Gath­ering since it is the final form composed of particles of matter. It is said that all gods who do not possess the power of dis­cernment inhabit one area of Great Result. The gods of the fourth meditative concentration who share a common environment do not share a common fate: each god undergoes a solitary birth and death, including [the appearance and dissolution of] the celestial palace and possessions. Within the fourth level of medi­tative concentration, Not Greater to Unsurpassed are known as the pure domains because only exalted ones30 are born there. Many scriptures, such as the Descent into Lanka Scripture, as well as some tantras, concur that Unsurpassed is the abode of the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Our Universe 121 enjoyment dimension of awakening. Moreover, Asaitga's Five Treatises on the Stages states that the Place of the Great Lords, where [bodhisattvas] who have attained mastery of the tenth stage [of awakening] take birth, is located above Unsurpassed. [The heavens] double in size and grow increasingly magnificent. The dimensions and shapes of these realms are all precisely described in the Buddha's teaching on phenomenology and in other sources. Generally speaking, however, [most sources] maintain that the heavens double in size in ascending order and are proportionally more magnificent in terms of power and wealth. The term \"god\" in Sanskrit, divaukas, denotes sky dwellers or dwelling in the higher realms because the homes of these gods are in the higher realms. Another Sanskrit word for god is deva, meaning play or sport, since gods frolic about, amusing themselves. [II.A.l.b] Supplementary Discussion of the Viewpoint of the Proclaimers and the Solitary Sages One third-order thousand world-system is fathomed by the vision of the proclaimers and solitary sages, Who assert that it is composed of indivisible particles of matter. The precise arrangement of just a single second-order thousand world-system or the great thousand third-order thousand world-system as explained above is fathomed by the sublime vision of the exalted proclaimers and solitary sages. Beyond that, the configuration of the realms of the Infinite Oceans world-system remains the field of experience solely ofbuddhas and the bodhisattvas who have attained the pure stages.31 [The Treasury of Phenomenology] states: The saintly [proclaimers],32 the rhinoceros [-like solitary sages ),33 and the buddhas Have seen, [respectively,] the second-order thousand, third-order thousand, and countless world-systems."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"122 Myriad Wo rlds The proclaimers and solitary sages assert that the coarse en­vironmental world is composed of an agglomerate formed of the eight constituents of particles, that is, the indivisible minute particles of the four [elements]- earth, water, fire, wind- as well as smell, taste, texture, and form. However, they do not share the opinion held by some non-Buddhists34 that infini­tesimal, indivisible particles of matter remain in empty space following the destruction [of the world-system] of the previ­ous age. Rather, they assert that the collective actions of beings who are to take birth in this world-system produce energy­winds capable of generating the manifold [world] as their coarse result. Thus, they consider these energy-winds to be the initial cause [for the creation of the world]. This view and others will be discussed in detail below (in Chapter Four). [II.A.2] The Inhabitants, Sentient Beings This section has four parts: (1) the nature of every sentient be­ing, (2) the manner of diffusion of beings, (3) their experiences of happiness and suffering, and (4) categorization. [II.A.2.a] The Nature of Every Sentient Being The nature of each being is unobscured and undetermined. The basis for all life, the environmental world, has been de­scribed above. The nature of every being who lives in that en­vironment remains unaffected by actions or emotions and is neither virtuous nor evil. The theories unique to the Universal­ists-that fundamental consciousness,35 radiant awareness, etc., [is the nature of every being]-will be discussed in Chapter Four.

From beginningless time, every sentient being has been in a state of delusion. This instinctive unawareness of the nature of being serves as the concomitant cause that activates the pro­pensity for dualistic experience. This causes a being to wander astray in the three realms [of existence]. Initially, the four levels of absorption36 of the formless realm come into existence (beginning with Neither [Discernment] nor No [Discernment]) followed sequentially by the form realm and the desire realm. In short, beings diffuse from higher forms of life to lower; thus, all the [different] realms, from the highest down to the hells, come into existence. [II.A.2.b.ii] The Extensive Explanation Moreover, the four levels of absorption of the formless realm Are only distinctions in contemplation; they have no form or location. The formless realm refers to the four levels of meditative absorption. Some masters discuss these four levels in descending order, in keeping with the way beings first take birth [and then dif­fuse downward throughout] cyclic existence. Although that ap­proach is appropriate, the four levels are presented here in as­cending order to facilitate understanding. When an individual first achieves contemplative absorption, the thought occurs, \"This is infinite like space.\" Once this ex­perience arises, it grows and develops. This path results in a birth having the same name, Absorption of Infinite Space. The other three levels follow the same pattern: the Absorption of Infinite Consciousness is so named because of the initial"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"124 Myriad Worlds thought, \"This is infinite consciousness.\" The Absorption of Nothing Whatever is so named because of the initial thought, \"This is nothing at all.\" The Absorption of Neither Discern­ment nor No Discernment is so named because of a feeble dis­cernment, an initial thought: \"Discernment is like a sickness, tumor, or pain; no discernment is total numbness.\" During the period of the initial delusion [in which beings do not recognize their own natures] that impels them to take birth in the three realms, beings move from the highest [levels] of the formless realm levels down to the lowest. Subsequently, as beings take birth within the various realms of cyclic life, they are born wherever appropriate, according to which of the four meditative absorptions they developed in a previous existence. Some individuals who have attained the highest [of the four levels] gradually descend from one level to the one below. Oth­ers may move from whatever [state] they have attained to any other form of existence. These changes do not follow any fixed pattern. Generally speaking, however, the majority of beings who at­tain the four [levels] of this formless realm fall gradually lower and lower. [This process takes place as follows]: When a god [of the highest level] dies, the contemplation of Neither Dis­cernment nor No Discernment-the peak of existence-dis­solves, and the discernment of Nothing Whatever arises. This absorption is slightly coarser than the previous one. Since that experience feels blissful, attachment to that state develops and the god falls to that level. In the same way, at the time of death of [a god in the Infinite] Consciousness [realm], the consciousness of Infinite Space arises. That experience causes the god to be born in the equiva­lent state. This occurs because long habituation to abiding in a specific state of contemplation facilitates re-entering that state of mind. The gods of the four formless levels described here are clas­sified simply according to differences in their contemplation rather than according to higher and lower locations since they have neither fixed locations nor physical forms of particular J"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Our Universe 125 sizes. Wherever a being achieves a [specific] state of absorp­tion, that being attains the same state after death in the same place. Some specialists in phenomenology assert that the formless levels do have forms and locations in a tiered arrangement above Unsurpassed. They contend that the expression \"form­less\" is a term used simply as a negation of inferior states. Fur­ther, the Flower Ornament Scripture makes repeated use of terms that imply that the formless realm has physical structure. For example37: The formless realm has location, ... a basis, ... an environment, ... and shape. Similarly, according to Vimalamitra and Padmasarpbhava, and according to the views expressed in Early Translation38 texts such as the Great Array: The Ta ntra of Supreme Wish-Fulfillment, four [realms] such as Sky of Tiered Lotuses are located in space high above the form realm, and these serve as the basis for the forms of beings absorbed in contemplation. The form realm: In the fourth level of meditative concentration, [there are] five pure domains and three heavens of ordinary beings. Three [heavens] are located within each of the lower three levels of meditative concentration. The realm of form is so named because beings within it are free from the attachment endemic to the desire realm but still have attachment to form. This realm's seventeen heavens can be grouped into what are known as the four levels of meditative concentration. Five pure domains- Unsurpassed, etc. -and three heavens for ordinary beings, such as Great Result, are located at the fourth and highest level of meditative concentra­tion. As previously described, three heavens are located at each of the three lower levels of meditative concentrations: Flour­ishing Virtue, etc., at the third; Clear Light, etc., at the second; and Great Pure Ones, etc., at the first. At the beginning of the formation of a [new] world, if the previous world has been destroyed by fire, a god of the second"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 Myriad Worlds level of meditative concentration dies and takes birth in the empty celestial residence of Brahma [that is, on the first level]. From that point onward, beings diffuse progressively [through­out the realms] in descending order, so that all realms of exist­ence from Priests of Brahma and Group of the Pure down to and including the hells [fill with life]. In the case of the previ­ous world having been destroyed by water, [this process] be­gins by [a god] of the third level of contemplation being born at the level below, and so on. The desire realm comprises thirty-six types of beings: Six groups of gods, [humans of the] four continents, [Inhabitants of the] eight islands, animals and starving spirits, [Beings in the] eight hot hells, and the eight cold hells. The desire realm is so named because beings of this realm are preoccupied with sensual pleasures, mainly sexual intercourse, and crave coarse foods.39 It comprises the six classes of desire realm gods (dwelling in Mastery Over Others' Creations and the others), the [beings that inhabit] the four great continents (Unpleasant Sound, Bountiful Cow, Majestic Body, Land of Jambu) and their eight islands, and the eighteen [types of be­ings in the] miserable existences (the animals, the starving spir­its, and the beings of the eight hot and the eight cold hells.) Together these are known as thirty-six types of beings of the desire realm. At the time of the initial formation of the world, these existences formed as beings descended and diffused from higher states in the order explained above. The twenty existences, ten happy and ten miserable, May also be classified as twenty-eight. In other classifications, the gods of the six heavens of the desire realm and the humans of the four continents constitute the \"ten happy existences.\" The [beings of the] eight hells, the animals, and the starving spirits make up the \"ten miserable existences.\" Together these are known as the \"twenty existences of the de­sire realm.\" If the [beings of the] eight islands are counted sepa­rately, there are then twenty-eight existences within the desire realm. _j"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Our Universe 127 Although the demi-gods may be included in the category of animals, their habitat, physical form, possessions, and so on are qualitatively so similar to those of the gods that they are classified as gods. As the Five Treatises on the Stages and the Wish­Fulfilling Scripture confirm, the negative a in asura, the Sanskrit word for demi-god, denotes inferiority, not a denial of status as a god (sura). [II.A.2.c] Happiness and Suffering Within the happy existences -the form realm and the rest-Lifespans and possessions decrease the lower the level. In the miserable existences, suffering increases the lower the level. The lifespans and possessions of the gods in the seventeen heav­ens of the form realm, of the six classes of the gods of the desire realm, and of humans of the four continents decrease in the descending order described in the previous section (on diffu­sion). Conversely, the higher [realms] experience much greater lifespans and enjoyments than the lower. The intensity of suffering and the span of life experienced by beings in the miserable existences increase progressively in de­scending order: starving spirits suffer more than animals, hell beings more than starving spirits, and beings in lower hells more than those in higher hells.

Moreover, the Marvellous Life of the Buddha Scripture41 states: Through the forces of craving, becoming, and unawareness, Ordinary beings foolishly spin through the five existences­Human, god, and the three miserable existences -Just like a potter's wheel spinning 'round. This fivefold classification is based on the courses of birth and paths of migration experienced by beings. Alternatively, the five paths are explained as the path of dream, the path of instincts, the path of evolutionary actions, the path of unpredictable and deceptive cyclic life, and the path of unpredictable and distinct causes and effects. All these beings may be categorized according to the four modes of birth, Or into pure, corrupt, and indeterminate groups. All beings may be categorized according to their modes of birth, of which there are four possibilities: womb birth, egg birth, birth through heat and moisture, and miraculous birth. Gods, hell beings, and beings in the intermediate state42 are said to expe­rience miraculous birth; humans and animals experience all four modes of birth; and starving spirits undergo both womb and miraculous births. Moreover, all who are born, live, and die within this type of world of sentient beings may be included within one of three groups: the definitely pure, the definitely corrupt, and the in­determinate.

[II.B.l] The Beings of Our World-System During the time of abiding, most beings, except for animals, Experience consequences that are predetermined. After the world-system has formed completely and has entered its period of abiding, all beings of the lower realms (with the exception of the animals) and most beings of the higher realms generally experience only the consequences of virtuous or unvirtuous actions committed in previous existences. Thus, their happiness and suffering, their lifespans and enjoyments, and other aspects of their lives are all predetermined. Although animals experience the results of their previous negative actions, they have indefinite lifespans, etc. At one ex­treme, the great nagas and certain other animals live for an en­tire intermediate age44; at the other extreme, some organisms live for only an instant. Moreover, there are innumerable pos­sibilities with respect to their physical shapes and features. The domesticated animals have some vestige of happiness, but those born in the darkness of the areas between continents, as well as some other animals, are tormented by unremitting suffering. A correlation exists between the lifespans of beings in the six hot hells in descending order (beginning with Reviving) and time as experienced in the six desire realm heavens in ascend­ing order: The number of years in the lifespan of a being in a certain hell equals the number of years in the lifespan of a god in the corresponding heaven. However, what counts as one day in the life of a hell being is equivalent to the entire lifespan of a god. For example, a being in the Reviving Hell lives for five hun­dred years, during which period each day is equal to the entire"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"130 Myriad Wo rlds lifespan of the gods of the Four Groups of the Great Kings. The lifespan in Extreme Heat is said to last half an intermediate age, and that of Ceaseless Torture, one full cosmic age. Within the cold hells, the lifespan in Blistering is equal to the time nec­essary to exhaust the sesame seed stock of Magadha when it is reduced at the rate of one seed per hundred years. The lifespans of the others increase proportionally, each one twenty times more than the previous. The lifespan of starving spirits lasts five hundred years, one day in their life being equal to a month in the human realms. Asanga's Facts of the Stages states that the physical size and lifespan of a demi-god are equivalent to those of a god of the Thirty-three Groups of Gods. Within the three miserable realms there is a great variety of physical sizes. The stature of humans in Majestic Body is equal to eight cubits measured on a human in the Land of Jambu; the stature of humans in Bountiful Cow is double that of Majestic Body; and that of Unpleasant Sound is double that of Bountiful Cow. The stature of the six desire gods increases proportionally from one quarter of an earshot in the lowest heaven to one and a half earshots45 in the highest. A human being in Majestic Body lives two hundred and fifty years; in Bountiful Cow, five hundred years; and in Unpleas­ant Sound, one thousand years. For gods in the Four Groups of the Great Kings, a single day is equal to fifty human years, and they live for five hundred years. In the heaven called Thirty­three Groups of Gods, one day is equal to one hundred human years, and the gods there live one thousand years. Lifespan for gods in the heavens above the Thirty-three, up to and includ­ing Mastery Over Others' Creations, doubles from heaven to heaven in ascending order. The gods of the form realm live for ages equal to the number of leagues of their stature. Lif espans range from half an age for a god of Group of the Pure to sixteen thousand ages for a god of Unsurpassed. The gods of the four formless realms, beginning with Infi­nite Space, enjoy lifespans of twenty thousand, forty thousand, sixty thousand, and eighty thousand ages, respectively.

Lifespan decreases from incalculable to ten, And then increases to eighty thousand, and so on. During a decline, a rise, and eighteen intermediate cycles, There are fluctuations. The three continents are places where [consequences] are experienced; Jambu Land, the most distinguished, is the place of action. In this land of Jambu, humans mainly engage in evolutionary actions.46 Consequently, there is nothing fixed or definitive re­garding their lifespans, wealth, and physical size. Initially, human lifespan was measureless, but gradually it became calculable; eventually, lifespan will decrease to ten years. This long age concludes with the three periods of fam­ine, plague, and war. Specifically, when lifespan is thirty years, there will be a period of famine lasting for seven years, seven months, and seven days; when twenty years, a period of plague lasting seven months and seven days; and when ten years, a period of war lasting seven days. This entire sequence [during which lifespan decreases from countless to ten years] is termed a long decline.47 One cycle refers to a rise and decline together, i.e., the time required for lifespan to rise from ten to eighty thousand years, and then to decline from eighty thousand to ten years. Eigh­teen such periods are referred to as the eighteen intermediate cycles. Each of these cycles concludes with [periods of] famine, plague, and war. Finally, the period during which lifespan in­creases from ten to eighty thousand years is called a long rise.48 Altogether, these are referred to as the twenty intermediate ages. Because of the slower pace during the rise and decline at the beginning and end of the ages, the length of time of each is equal to one intermediate cycle, as pointed out in Purl).avardhana's Commentary [to the Treasury of Phenomenology] and other texts. The Facts of the Stages also refers to the long decline and long rise at the beginning and end of the ages as being each equal to one cycle."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"132 Myriad Worlds According to the sagacious Longchenpa, after the human lifespan has increased to measureless (during the long rise) and has then begun to decline again, the buddha Inspired49 will appear [in this world] just as the lifespan first becomes calcu­lable. This statement agrees, for the most part, [with predic­tions found in] the Universal Way [scriptures]. During both the long rise and decline as well as the eighteen intermediate cycles, the lifespans, physical sizes, and wealth of beings undergo various fluctuations. One is mistaken if one believes that human life in this world is inferior to others. Since humans of the three other continents experience [only] the results of their past [actions], they have no possibility of performing new evolutionary actions. There­fore, these places are inferior to Jambu. The Land of Jambu is a place for new evolutionary actions. Therefore, any action performed by persons born here has es­pecially powerful [effects]. Moreover, people feel sad when hearing accounts of impermanence, etc., and so are easily guided [onto the spiritual path]. For these reasons, supreme emanations of awakening-spiritual guides, including our own teacher Sakyamuni-demonstrate enlightenment in this world and become the teachers [of humanity]. Therefore, human life in the Land of J ambu is superior to that on the other continents. The Great Mindfulness Scripture50 states: Compared to the other three continents, this is a place for evolutionary action. Here, people are inspired to practice the ten virtues. Here, buddhas appear. All four places of humans depend on this one. Here, people are conscientious about the ten virtuous actions and are inspired to practice them. This is a place for pure conduct. Here, there is an awareness of birth and death. Here, there is the indestructible seat of enlightenment. 51 From the same source: Among the four continents of our universe inhabited by hu­mans, the Land of Jambu is the most important.

Then, such distinctions as the four eras and four classes arose. The genesis of humans on this continent occurred when a god in [the heaven of] Clear Light died and took miraculous birth here. A second, then a third followed, and their numbers in­creased progressively until there were many, all of whom took miraculous birth here like the first. All could travel through space, had radiant bodies, and were sustained by the nourish­ment of meditative concentration, like gods of the form realm. Later, a white earth-nectar that tasted like honey appeared. Eating copiously of this, they began to crave it. Consequently, the nourishment of meditative concentration and other quali­ties, including miraculous powers and even the earth-nectar itself, disappeared. Then appeared a creamy orange earth-food, and they ate that. Because they began to crave it, both the food and the radiance of their bodies gradually deteriorated. At that point, due to the forces of collective evolutionary actions and the natural laws of existence,52 the sun and moon began to illu­minate the world. In the same way, other earth-nectars as well as fields of sprouts appeared and disappeared. Subsequently, fields of huskless sali rice grew53; reaped in the morning the crop could grow [again] in the evening. Digestion of this rice produced bodily wastes such as feces and urine. Eating these coarse foods caused the male and female geni­tals to appear. Gradually, opposite genders became attracted to each other and engaged in sexual intercourse. Others reviled and threw mud at them, whereupon they became ashamed; regarding their sexual activity as inappropriate, they abandoned it for periods of up to seven days. Some of the most depraved individuals constructed houses in order to protect themselves from the embarrassment of being observed while copulating. Then, because people stored and hoarded the grain, even the sali rice, which required no cultivation, disappeared. In its place grew a grain with a husk. Because this grain, once harvested, had to be planted again, land was apportioned and fields were farmed. Eventually, [people] began to steal one another's crops and disputes erupted.

[His descendants] were referred to as royalty because they were lords of the fields, and also because they safeguarded [the well-being of society]. Gradually, people became predominately evil and violated the king' slaws. Regardless how stringent the disciplinary mea­sures, people failed to obey the laws, and so capital punishment was instituted. Fearing death, people began to lie and commit other evil acts. Eventually, the five forms of degeneration54 evolved, culminating in periods of plague, war, and famine. The history of our continent unfolded in four distinct eras. 55 The first era is called the era of completeness [because splen­dor and enjoyments were complete]. The second is the era of three-quarters, so called because theft and sexual intercourse reduced the splendor and wealth of the environment and its in­habitants by one quarter. Then, due to lying, the splendor and enjoyments were reduced to one half, and so the third era is re­ferred to as the era of two-quarters. The fourth and final period is the era of conflict, during which even the remnant quarter of wealth and splendor gradually diminishes due to murder and the other forms of non-virtue committed by humans. Human beings became divided into four classes56: royalty descended from the lineage of King Honored by Multitudes; brahrnins carne from those who were disillusioned by the short­comings of household life; merchants descended from those who did not steal or commit other forms of non-virtue; and the menial class carne from those who engaged in theft and other non-virtuous activities. [II.B.3] The Origin of the Wheel-Monarchs Wheel-monarchs, who [possess wheels of] gold, silver, copper, and iron, Appear in this world only when the lifespan is no less than eighty thousand years."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Our Universe 135 Some say that they reign totally over the third-order thousand world-system. Wheel-monarchs, who reign over the four continents [by vir­tue of their possession of] a gold, silver, copper or iron wheel, are said to appear in this world whenever the lifespan rises above eighty thousand years. The origin of the line of wheel­monarchs of the present age is explained as follows: According to the Supreme Essence Commentary on Transcen­dent Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines, the court of King Honored by Multitudes was established at Rajagrha.57 King Honored by Multitudes married a queen named Upper River Maiden who bore a son named Beautiful Light. Beautiful Light's queen, named Born from a Mountain, begat a son named Virtue. Virtue's queen, Voice of the Clouds, begat Perfect Virtue. Per­fect Virtue's queen, Palm Legs, gave birth to Noble Purifica­tion. These are known as the five kings of the Fortunate Age. A protuberance grew on the crown of the head of the king Noble Purification, and from it sprang [a child] named Suckle Me, 58 [who inherited the throne]. [One day] when he was stand­ing on the terrace of his residence, a gold wheel appeared in space before him. He flung the wheel with the command, \"Con­quer the East!\" The wheel moved in that direction, carrying the king's attendants upon it. In succession, [the inhabitants of] the four continents as well as [the heaven of] the Thirty-three Groups of Gods welcomed them and thus became subjects of the king. That's how Suckle Me became a great wheel-mon­arch. His physical form and his activities equalled Indra' s; how­ever, his lifespan exceeded Indra' s by one hundred and forty times. The son of Suckle Me, called Handsome, possessed a silver wheel; he gained control of three continents- the eastern, southern, and western - simply by advancing in their direc­tion. The son of Handsome, named Very Handsome, possessed a copper wheel; he gained power over the eastern and south­ern continents simply by preparing for battle. Very Handsome's son, called Having Beauty, possessed an iron wheel; he gained control of the southern continent by brandishing weapons. His son, known as Having Great Beauty, also possessed an iron"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"136 Myriad Worlds wheel; by simply brandishing weapons, he too gained control of the southern continent. 59 All subsequent wheel-monarchs held power over only a single continent. Furthermore, two wheel-monarchs never ap­peared simultaneously because buddhas, indras, and wheel­monarchs have not performed the actions that cause rivals to appear. Wheel-monarchs exhibit the characteristic marks and signs [of great beings ]60 similar to those of a buddha, but not as obvious and complete. For the most part, they are exalted ones. They appear when the [human] lifespan is not less than eighty thousand years, i.e., during the era of completeness, because all ten virtues are practiced. After the era of completeness has ended, their power and prosperity become depleted. However, there are some rulers who are referred to as wheel-monarchs because they reign over most of the Land of J ambu, even though they lack such attributes as the seven precious articles. These monarchs appear whenever [conditions are] appropriate, but only until [human] lifespan has decreased to one hundred years. Wheel-monarchs own three sets of seven articles endowed with extraordinary characteristics. The first [of these three sets] consists of the seven supremely precious articles, which are de­scribed in the Great Mindfulness Scripture61: [1] The precious wheel is made of gold, is five hundred leagues [in diameter] and has one thousand spokes. Within a day it can travel one thousand leagues. By the power of the wheel, the king's attendants, the elephant and so on, are able to travel anywhere through space up to [the heaven of] the Thirty-three and can hear what the king does not hear. The wheel eliminates rivals. It appeared from space. [2] The precious jewel has eight facets and equals the size of a large man's thigh. It illuminates the night up to a distance of one hundred leagues, and if the day is hot, it provides cooling water of eight qualities. Within a radius of one hun­dred leagues, this jewel eliminates all diseases and fulfills all wishes. It was presented by Indra.

When her husband is ab­sent, [she maintains chastity] and never succumbs to the plea­sures of the five senses. She was presented by the minister. [4] The precious minister is free of disturbing emotions and has forsaken all unvirtuous actions. He is proficient in ev­erything he does, even without training. He is like a loving parent toward all beings. [5] The precious elephant is wise and obedient. In a single day, he can circle the Land of Jambu three times. When mounted by the king, he goes wherever the king wishes, without being prompted. He defeats the king's adversaries. [6] The precious horse is bluish-green in color, like the neck of a peacock, and has qualities similar to those of th� elephant. Both [the elephant and the horse] were given by Sakra. [7] The precious general has the power to conquer all en­emies, yet he causes no harm to others. Alternatively, the seventh precious article is the precious chamberlain, who obeys the king's commands and keeps his treasury full. Ex­perts on this topic say that a gold wheel-monarch has no general because he does not need to prepare for battle; in that case, the seventh article is the chamberlain, who also serves as treasurer. Since the other three [types of wheel­monarch] must prepare for battle, for them the general is counted as the seventh. The second set of possessions, the seven semi-precious ar­ticles, consists of the following: [The first is] the sword whose mere presence intimidates those who contravene the king's laws. [The second is] the hide canopy, which is ten leagues in length and five in width, impervious to rain and unruffled by wind. It serves as a residence for the king and the members of his entourage wherever they go, providing warmth in cold weather and coolness in the heat. It was offered by a merchant and is said to be the hide of a naga that came from the ocean. [The third is] the mansion, twelve leagues in length and seven in width, which is warm in the cold and cool in the heat. God­desses gather there to play music, and from the mansion one can see whatever one wishes-the moon, the constellations, or precious gems. [The fourth is] the garment that is impenetrable to weapons and fire; it is soft and never soils, and whoever"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"138 Myriad Wo rlds wears it remains unaffected by heat, cold, hunger, thirst, and weariness. [The fifth is] the pleasure garden, where young gods and goddesses, birds and other creatures gather at the time of royal visits. [The sixth is] the bedding that frees one from dis­turbing emotions and clears the mind, and if one cultivates contemplation, it also effects liberation. [The seventh is] the pair of boots that allows the wearer to walk on water and to travel a hundred leagues in an instant, without weariness. [Additional semi-precious articles] include the thousand sons who have renounced the ten unvirtuous actions and the bow and arrow that overpower the enemy. The last set of possessions, the seven types of jewels, are men­tioned in [Haribhadra's] Discussion on the Scripture of Transcen­dent Wisdom in Ei ght Thousand Lines62: Seven substances-coral, blue beryl, Silver, gold, crystal, Pink pearl, and emerald-are [called] precious Because they are universally considered valuable. Moreover, the Questions of Gaganagafija Scripture mentions that there are wheel-monarchs who control our entire third-order thousand world-system. Further, the Scripture Revealing Dharma and its Meaning63 states: In the world -system called Source of Flowers, there appeared a ruler of humanity, a wheel-monarch called Victorious, who was sovereign of this great thousand third-order thousand world-system. [II.B.4] Features of Life There are many variations in food, hunger and thirst, color of clothing, night and day, etc. Beings in lower [realms] do not see those in the higher. Beings living in their respective realms are [nourished by a va­riety of foods]. Many kinds of food are eaten in three of the human continents, while in the northern continent only an un­cultivated grain is consumed. The gods of the desire realm live on ambrosia, and those of the form realm, on the nourishment"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Our Universe 139 of contemplation. These are some of the differences with re­spect to food. Hunger and thirst are experienced in the desire realm, but not in the two higher realms. Styles of clothing also distinguish [the different realms]. In the three continents, humans wear clothes in a variety of col­ors, whereas clothing in the northern continent is exclusively white. In the six [heavens of] the desire realm, the gods wear clothes of multi-colored cloth-white, yellow, blue, and red; in the form realm, all clothing is white. Garments in the three con­tinents are very heavy, being made of silk, cotton, etc.; garments in the northern continent and desire gods' realm are fashioned from the bark of a wish-fulfilling tree, and are soft, supple, and light. Garments in the northern continent weigh only an ounce64; [they decrease progressively in weight up to] Unsurpassed, where they are weightless. In the four continents, the distinction between night and day depends on the light of the sun and moon. Because of the natu­ral radiance [of realms] above [the highest of the golden moun­tain ranges,] Yo ke, there is no variation in light and dark; the inhabitants of these regions distinguish day from night by the opening and closing of flowers. A corpse remains after the death of a being born in any mode except miraculous birth. In the latter case, no corpse remains after death. In three of the continents, humans attach great importance to the amount of rainfall and the quality of the harvest, while humans in the northern continent and the gods feel no such [concern]. Many such features distinguish life in the higher realms. Except for those who have attained miraculous powers or those who are guided by gods of higher realms, those in lower realms are not able to travel to or to see realms above their own. However, just the opposite applies for those of the higher realms. The gods of the form realm, such as those of the Group of the Pure, can travel to the Land of Jambu. At that time, their bodies do not leave their own abodes, but emanate into our world in a [human] form as a result of having previously expe-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"140 Myriad Wo rlds rienced this level of existence. Because [the gods of] Mastery Over Others' Creations and [heavens] below it are on the same level-the desire realm-gods [of those realms] travel to our world in their own form. [II.C] The Ages of the Final Destruction and Vacuity of Our World-System This section has two parts: (1) the main [discussion], and (2) a supplementary [discussion]. [II.C.1] The Main Discussion This section has two parts: (1) an explanation of the emptying of the world-system of inhabitants, and (2) an explanation of the destruction of the environment. [II.C.l.a] The Emptying of the World-System of Inhabitants At the time of destruction, the miserable realms, beginning with the hell realms, empty. Gods and humans attain meditative concentration and are born in the form realm. As the realms empty of inhabitants, the [beings of] the lower realms move higher. When the period of abiding comes to an end and the period of destruction begins, all those in the hell realm who have ex­hausted the causes [for the hell experience] move to higher realms. Those who have not exhausted the causes [for the hell experience] remain and experience suffering when this world is destroyed. Finally they move on, and take birth in the hell of another world. No beings are born anew in the hell realms of this world; in this way the hell realms are emptied. This marks the beginning of the process of destruction; subsequently, the principal habitations of starving spirits and animals are simi­larly emptied. Next, one human being of the Land of Jambu, by his own inherent qualities, attains the second level of meditative con­centration and remains in that state. Then, arising [from that"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Our Universe 141 meditative concentration], he says, \"This is the bliss and joy that has come from isolation65!\" His words instantly pervade the Land of Jambu. Immediately upon hearing these words, others follow the same training, achieve the second level of meditative concentration, and take birth among the class of gods of Clear Light. When there is no longer a single human left in the Land of Jambu, all the humans of the eastern continent, Majestic Body, and the western, Bountiful Cow, undergo the same change. Those of Unpleasant Sound take birth in the heaven of the Thirty-three. Humans inhabiting the islands follow [a pattern] similar to those of their adjacent continent. In this way, the hu­man world empties. Subsequently, a single god announces the way to attain the second level of meditative concentration, and gradually the [gods below the second level] attain higher lev­els and are born in the form realm. They then move from lower to higher levels by attaining progressively higher meditative concentrations. When there is no longer a single being left in the heaven of the Pure and below, the destruction (emptying) of the inhabitants is complete. [II. C.l.b] Environment The heavens of the first meditative concentration and below are destroyed by fire. Space alone remains, a vacuity containing nothing at all. Again formation occurs, and again abiding, and finally destruction by fire. After the emptying of the world's inhabitants, no rain falls. Seven suns begin to blaze, eventually drying up everything from plants and trees to forests and great oceans. Finally, all becomes a single tongue of fire which burns and destroys ev­erything from the hell of Unceasing Torment up to and includ­ing the first level of meditative concentration. Below the sec­ond level of the form realm, only space remains, a vacuity con­taining nothing whatsoever. Again, as before, a new world-sys­tem comes into existence. Finally, at the completion of its pe­riod of abiding, it is similarly destroyed by fire."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"142 Myriad Worlds After seven such [sequences], a deluge at the end of the eighth Destroys the second meditative concentration and below. This sequence of formation and destruction takes place seven times; at the end of the eighth [period of abiding], a great cloud gathers in the heaven of Clear Light. A deluge pours down, dissolving this world just as salt dissolves into water. Even this [mass of water] evaporates, so that the [level of] the second meditative concentration and everything below is destroyed. Seven destructions by fires alternating with one by water occur seven times, Ending with another seven by fire. Finally, intense wind destroys the third meditative concentration and below. When the sequence of seven destructions by fire, alternating with one destruction by water, has occurred seven times, again there are seven destructions by fire. At the end of that entire process, a wind arises which pulverizes even Mount Meru, the king of mountains, and destroys the third level of meditative concentration and everything below. Because those three contemplations have imperfections, [they are destroyed]; The fourth, being free of imperfection, is not destroyed by the elements. The lower three levels of meditative concentrations are de­stroyed by fire, water, and wind because these contemplations are imperfect. The imperfection of the first level of meditative concentration, the presence of investigation and examination, resembles fire. The imperfection of the second, the presence of joy and bliss, resembles water. The imperfection of the medita­tive concentration in the third, the inhalation and exhalation of the breath, resembles wind. Because of these [imperfections], [each meditative concentration] is destroyed by [the element corresponding to its imperfection]. Because the fourth meditative concentration has none of these imperfections, it is not destroyed by external elements. How­ever, sentient beings [of this level of meditative concentration]"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Our Universe 143 are said to undergo birth and destruction together with their mentally created celestial palaces and other possessions. The earth element is not a contributing factor in [these cycles of] destruction because the environmental world itself is com­posed primarily of the element earth. [II.C.2] Supplementary Discussion This section has three parts: (1) an enumeration of ages, (2) other patterns of destruction, and (3) places that are not destroyed. [II.C.2.a] Enumeration of Ages Altogether, sixty-four great cycles of destruction occur. All these cycles of destruction and reformation of the world­system yielding a total of sixty-four great cycles occur in suc­cession. This is equal to the lifespan of the gods in Virtue In­creasing. Each of the ages of formation, abiding, destruction, and vacuity Lasts for twenty intermediate ages; together, these [four] constitute one cosmic age. The duration of the age of formation equals the time between the initial stage of [the formation] of the wind configuration and the formation of the hells. It also equals the time required for the human lifespan in the Land of Jambu to decrease from incalculable to eighty thousand years. The age of formation comprises twenty intermediate ages: one intermediate age is required for the formation of the environment and nineteen for the inhabitants. The first intermediate age of the period of abiding is the pe­riod during which the lifespan decreases from eighty thousand to ten years. Then, the period of increasing to eighty thousand and the period of again decreasing to ten, taken together, equals one intermediate cycle; eighteen repetitions of this are called the eighteen intermediate cycles. Again, the increase [of life­span] from ten years to eighty thousand or an incalculable num-"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"144 Myriad Worlds ber constitutes the final intermediate age. In total, the period of abiding lasts twenty intermediate ages. The period of destruction lasts twenty intermediate ages: the destruction of the inhabitants lasts nineteen intermediate ages and the destruction of the environment lasts for one. The period of vacuity, the period of darkness between the previous world's destruction and the next world's formation, lasts twenty intermediate ages. In summary, each of the four periods-formation, abiding, destruction, and vacuity-lasts twenty intermediate ages, which, when added together, make eighty intermediate ages; these constitute one cosmic age. These [calculations] have been made from the perspective of our [world-system,] Endurance. In general, however, the length of days and ages is not pre­cisely fixed. The Inconceivable King Scripture66 states that for the buddhas Sage of the Sakyas, Infinite Life, Vajra Conqueror, Radiant Fully Bloomed Lotus Form, Dharma Banner, Lion, Il­luminator, Dharma Radiance Fully Bloomed Flower Form, King of Wisdom Light, Moon[-like] Intelligence, and Splendor of Excellence, an age in the former buddha's period is merely a single day for the following. [II.C.2.b] Other Patterns of Destruction Such statements as that in a single age seven fires, One flood, and one wind arise, destroying the third level of meditative concentration and below, Reflect different points of view of different systems. The sagacious Drime Ozer (Longchenpa) and others assert that destruction occurs in a single great cycle [as opposed to the sixty-four cycles of destruction described above]. During this cycle of destruction, everything from the third level of meditative concentration down is destroyed by seven fires of destruction and one deluge, followed by destruction by wind, in the same order of destruction as described above. Because this is a different view according to a different system, it does"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Our Universe 145 not coincide with the view expressed in the Individualists' [sys­tem of] phenomenology. It should not, however, be considered wrong. Generally, while this third-order thousand world-system is undergoing formation and destruction, there are inestimable world-systems like ours that exist in other parts of the universe. Even now, periods of destruction, vacuity, formation, and abid­ing of world-systems in the ten directions are occurring con­tinuously, beyond measure or limit. There are also numerous different patterns of formation and destruction. [II.C.2.c] Places That Are Not Destroyed The pure realms and the Seat of Enlightenment, etc., are not destroyed, Since they are not the result of the origin [of suffering]. Are there places in this world-system not subject to formation and destruction? The pure realms of the enjoyment dimension of awakening, the natural radiance of the pristine wisdom of the exalted ones, are such places. The realms that arise from the force of the bodhisattvas' inconceivable virtue and vows to purify all realms-Blissful67 and Delightful, for example-be­long to the same category. These realms are not subject to for­mation and destruction until the activity of the buddhas has been completed. The Seat of Enlightenment, Vulture's Peak,68 and other sa­cred places are not destroyed along with this world.

[I] MAIN EXPLANATION The main explanation consists of three parts: (1) the descrip­tion of space, (2) the description of time, and (3) a conclusive summary. [LA] Space This section has seven parts: (1) the source and reason for this description of space and time, (2) Mount Meru and its founda­tions, (3} the mountains and continents, (4) the twelve lands of evolutionary action, (5) the Small Land of Jambu and its six regions, (6) the types of beings, and (7) the celestial sphere and time-conjunctions. [I.A.1] The Source and Reason fo r this Description of Space and Time The King of Ta ntras of the Primordial Buddha Refutes erroneous systems and integrates the outer, inner, And alternative [levels]."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"148 Myriad Wo rlds [The source for this description of space and time] is the Great King of Tantras of the Sacred Primordial Buddha,Z the [tantra] of the Glorious Wheel of Time, the pinnacle of all Buddhist sys­tems. This tantra refutes the erroneous descriptions of space and time based on incomplete or one-sided perspectives found in the systems of non-Buddhists and the common systems of the proclaimers and solitary sages. [The outer Wheel of Time denotes] our world-system, which reaches a height of 400,000 leagues. The inner [Wheel of Time] is the adamantine body3 which is four of one's own cubits [in height]. The alternative [Wheel of Time] consists of the four parts of the mat:t<;lalas4 [of the Wheel of Time,5] which are of equal dimensions. Based on these levels, the ultimate [Wheel of Time] (the four branches of familiarization and accomplish­ment6 or the binding of the crucial four indestructible states7) purifies what must be purified-the impurities of the four states. 8 The result of that purification is the actualization of the four pure dimensions of awakening. Therefore, these levels are unified into a single comprehensive system. The following de­scriptions of space and time are based on that integration. [I.A.2] Mount Meru and its Foundations In the center of space rest spherical foundations Of wind, fire, water, and earth, [proportional in size to the measure between] the soles of the feet and the waist. Mount Meru, its neck, face, and crowning protuberance [Are proportional to the measure between] the waist and the crown of the head. In the middle of space rests a spherical foundation of dark wind, 50,000 leagues in thickness. Above that rest the spheres of fire, water, and earth, [one directly on the top of the other]. All are completely circular, of the same thickness [as the wind], and [arranged one within the other, like bowls placed one inside the next, the upper rims of each being level]. The thickness of each of these [four spheres] corresponds proportionally to each of the four hand spans (two cubits) that the human body mea­sures from the soles of the feet to the waist."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Space and Time 149 The diameters of the spheres are as follows: the wind ex­tends 400,000 leagues; the fire, 300,000; the water, 200,000; and the earth, 100,000. All four are [semi-]spherical; their outer cir­cumference is three times their diameter. Above these stands Mount Meru, 100,000 leagues in height, [corresponding to] the one full cubit measure from the waist to the base of the neck [of a human body]. This mountain is the basis of the celestial spheres and the axis of their rotation. Above Mount Meru, its \"neck\" reaches 25,000 leagues in height; its \"face,\" 50,000 leagues; and its \"crown protuberance,\" 25,000 leagues, totalling 100,000. These [three, Mount Meru's neck, face, and crown protuberance] have no physical forms. However, the names \"neck,\" etc., are used to indicate their imaginary forms. These higher levels [of the world-system] are constituted of only the most subtle elements, whereas the lower levels are composed of all the coarse elements-earth, water, fire, wind, and space. The coarser elements are not found [at the higher levels]; only the last two-wind and space-of the five elements remain [in the higher parts of Mount Meru]. The proportions [of the upper parts of Mount Meru J corre­spond to those of the human body: the neck is six finger-widths, the face is a hand-span, and from the hairline to the crown of the head is six finger-widths. Altogether, this equals one full cubit. Thus, two cubits [is the m€'asure] from the waist to the crown of the head [of a human being]. The center is green; the east, blue; the north, white; the south, red; And the west, yellow. Each part is composed of a precious substance. The center of Mount Meru is green in color; the east side is blue; the north, white; the south, red; the west, yellow. Each part is composed of a precious substance-emerald, blue beryl, crystal, ruby, and topaz. These jewels are coarse elements formed from the six [basic] elements-space, wind, fire, earth, water, and pervasive pristine wisdom. From the [edge of the] vast upper surface hang five indestructible enclosures"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"150 Myriad Wo rlds In a concentric arrangement; the outer ones are progressively longer.

Thus,MountMeruis shaped like a porcelain cup, with a vast upper surface. Five concentric enclosures hang from the edge of this vast upper surface, like ornamental curtains, completely encircling the mountain. From the innermost outward, the enclosures are progressively longer, the outermost enclosure being even with the peak of Cool Mountain Range. As a result, the light of the sun and moon does not strike the continents within this enclosure. However, the human inhabitants there are sustained by their own natu­ral luminosity. (Details of these continents will be presented below.) The illustrious Tsuglag Trengwa taught that the central of the five [enclosures] of Mount Meru resembles a main axis and that the four remaining [enclosures] hang down, giving the ap­pearance of a five-pointed scepter. There are evidently many different models of this world-sys­tem. This explanation is based upon the most prevalent model. At the base is a ledge which forms an indestructible perimeter. The base of Mount Meru is encircled by a ledge which forms an impenetrable perimeter 1000 leagues wide. The distance between the outer boundary of this ledge and [the point on the surface of the earth sphere in a direct line below] the outer limit of the upper surface of Mount Meru is 16,000 leagues.

Sentient beings absorbed in the four [states]-Infinite Space, Infinite Consciousness, Nothing Whatever, and Neither Dis­cernment nor No Discernment-are said to live in levels from the crown protuberance of Mount Meru down to the hairline. The three realms, consisting of the thirty-one existences of our world-system [mentioned above], are formed in temporal sequence. Because the three realms have the nature of enlight­ened mind, speech, and body, their development follows a par­allel sequence: the formless realm [enlightened mind] comes into existence first, followed by the form realm and the desire realm. Furthermore, life within the desire realm comes into existence following the same sequence: life first forms below the earth, then on it, then above it."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"156 Myriad Worlds [I.A.7] The Celestial Sphere and Time-Conjunctions The celestial sphere pervades space between Mount Meru and the mountain of fire. It is a belt of wind, within which the twelve houses And the twenty-eight constellations formed first. The celestial sphere27 pervades the space between the outer cir­cumference at which the [outermost impenetrable] enclosure of Mount Meru meets Cool Mountain Range and the inner cir­cumference of the mountainous [ring] of fire [i.e., Horse-faced Fire]. The celestial sphere is a circular belt possessing the na­ture of wind that supports [all] the celestial palaces of the gods. Since it is slightly higher near Mount Meru, it has the bent shape of a bow. Near the mountainous [ring] of fire, it is slightly lower, resembling a lotus petal. It forms a complete circle [around Mount Meru]. Concerning the meaning of the word, The [Sanskrit] term gola (celestial sphere) may be translated As hollow, concave and convex, circular, heavy and light, and so forth. Translated precisely, it denotes \"that which holds up the heavens.\" The form [of the celestial sphere] is described differently by different scholars-as resembling the spokes of a wheel; rising up or spreading out; as resembling a stack of helmets, a chain, or a shield. [These descriptions] are based on reason and scrip­tural reference. The view that the celestial sphere is shaped like a cluster of boats eventually became the most prevalent. The eighth lord [Karmapa] Mikyo Dorje, with some amusement, provided a clear description of this in the Ocean of the Mind. The term \"house,\" from the [Sanskrit] rasi, denotes a gather­ing or cluster. The Fundamental Ta ntra of Mafljusri28 states that there are thirty-six houses; other sources present different enu­merations.

For a"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"160 Myriad Worlds month, the principal measure is the lunar day. Although the passing of thirty lunar days does not equal thirty solar days, the moon completes its cycle in this period. Therefore, it is nec­essary to use the lunar day as the basic measure for a month. [On the other hand], the lunar day is not used as a measure for the year. The reason is that when one subtracts the three hundred and sixty-five solar days from the three hundred and seventy-one lunar days [in a year,] an excess of six days re­mains. Because of this extra portion, [a lunar day] does not equal a day of the year. On this point, the Commentary to the Treasury of Phenomenology38 states: After the two halves of each month Of winter, spring and summer have elapsed, An extra half day remains in the month. Since it does not equal a day of the year, the learned reject [the lunar day as a measure for a year]. The house day is used as the principal unit of measure for a year. This is because a full year equals the time required for one full cycle of the four seasons of equal duration. To com­plete such a cycle, the sun must make a full revolution through the twelve house months, each consisting of thirty house days. The Vajra I)ilka Ta ntra39 states: The journey of the sun, going and returning, Is referred to as one year. Thus, the year consists of neither more nor less than three hundred and sixty house days or twelve house months. A period of twelve [solar or lunar] months, each month consisting of either thirty solar days or thirty lunar days, does not constitute a house year. Eleven days would have to be added [to a year of three hundred and sixty lunar days] for it to equal a house year. Similarly, slightly more than five solar days must be added [to a year of three hundred and sixty solar days] for it to equal a house year. The completion of the period in which the moon waxes fif­teen [days] and wanes fifteen [days] constitutes one month, known as a lunar month.

The effect of these transits on earth is the occurrence of the four seasons. When it is spring in the three southern land masses, it is summer in the eastern continents, autumn in the northern continents, and winter in the western continents. [In other words, the four seasons in the four continents] are occurring in a counterclockwise arrangement. In each of the land masses, however, the seasons occur in their natural sequence (i.e., clock­wise): first spring, then summer, autumn, and winter. Twelve time-conjunctions occur in space. One time-conjunc­tion is defined as the time it takes the planets to transit a single house. [As mentioned above, each constellation has four quar­ters;] a house is composed of nine such quarters. Eventually all the planets complete the twelve time-conjunctions. However, the statement that all the houses of the twelve time-conjunc­tions are transited [in exactly] one year applies only to the sun's movement.40 Similarly, only the sun transits the twelve time­conjunctions, whereas the houses appear in their entirety once each day. Time-conjunctions affect the quality of life. Inherent to the human body, which is composed of six elements, are the internal energy-winds of the twelve personal time-con­junctions. When these energy-winds circulate in harmony with their natural patterns, the body remains in good health. Dis­comfort results when these energy-winds are out of harmony with their natural patterns. Similarly, when the external energy­winds of the twelve time-conjunctions move in harmony with their natural patterns, the quality of the environment improves.

Moreover, [due to their influence,] the human lifespan increases from 100 years to 800,000 [years].

In addition to the above description of time, scholars with broad knowledge of the scriptures have presented explanations [on the following topics]: (1) the four eras of the Buddha's doctrine, (2) the four eras of the wheel-holders,42 lords over humanity, (3) the four eras of our world-system, and (4) the four eras of the planets entering vacuity. Numerous presentations of these subjects have been provided by Indian and Tibetan scholars; to elaborate on these would lead to an endless discussion. The following brief explanation accords with that of the eighth lord [Karmapa], the venerable Mikyo Dorje. [I.B.2.a] The Four Eras of the Buddha's Doctrine The doctrine of the Buddha endures for ten 500-year periods [following his passing from this world]. The first [era], com­posed of three periods of spiritual attainment, is considered [the era of] completeness. The second, composed of three peri­ods of spirituc:.l practice, is considered [the era of] three-quar­ters. The third, composed of three periods of theoretical teach­ing, is called [the era of] two-quarters. The fourth, the one pe­riod of time [when] only the outward appearance [of the reli­gious order] is maintained, is called [the era of] conflict. The division [of the Buddha's doctrine concerning] disci­pline43 designates the era of completeness as the period [from the Buddha's passing into perfect peace] until the occasion of the formal testimony [in the presence of the monastic commu­nity] of the first defeating act.44 The era of three-quarters is des­ignated as the subsequent period lasting until the occasion of the testimony of the second defeating act, and so on. This is essentially the same theory as that proposed by the scholar"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Space and Time 163 [Dal!l?friisena] in his Commentary to the Large, [Medium and Small] Transcendent Wisdom Scriptures.45 Similarly, the Concise Ta ntra [of the Wheel of Time]46 provides a source for this classification [of the four eras], implicit in the following: It is as the Protector of the World [taught]. [I.B.2.b] The Four Eras of the Wheel-Holders In our land, [the central of the three southern continents,] the four eras [of the wheel-holders] lasts for a total of 21,600 years. Completeness, three-quarters, and two-quarters each lasts 5,400 years. The initial stage of the conflict [era] lasts for 3,600 years. This period, added to the total of the former three eras, totals 19,800 years, the time period during which Buddhism prevails. The remaining 1,800 [years is] the time during which barbaric religions prevail. Fifty-one years after the chieftain Hidden Omnipresent One47 ascended the lion throne [of the kingdom of Sambhala], the 1,800-year period of barbarism began. It will end fifty-one years after Forceful [Wheel-Holder]48 ascends the lion throne. Force­ful [Wheel-Holder] will conquer the arrogant barbarians49with the four divisions of his army50 and convert them to Buddhism. At that point, the era of completeness will begin again, and the human lifespan will gradually increase to 1,800 years. The year that the era of completeness begins [here] corresponds to the first year of the 1,800-year barbaric period on the western of the three southern continents. At the same time, of the two sons of Forceful [Wheel-Holder], The Pure and the Chief of the Gods, The Pure will ascend to power in this land. Other kings descended from the family of the Chief of the Gods will defeat the barbarians of the western southern continent 1,800 years after the era of completeness has begun here. [This victory will mark] the beginning of the era of completeness on that continent. At that time, the 1,800-year barbaric period begins on the southern of the three western continents. At the end of that period, Buddhist kings descended from the family of Chief of the Gods will defeat the barbarians, and the era of complete-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"164 Myriad Worlds ness will begin [there]. Following this pattern, the other nine land masses, in succession, enter the 1,800-year period of bar­barism. The barbarians are [then] defeated by Buddhist kings and the era of completeness begins. Starting with Chief of the Gods, [wheel-holders] of that lineage appear in a clockwise manner through the twelve lands. When they have all made their appearance, a chieftain also known as Forceful [Wheel­Holder] will once again defeat the barbarians in this land, and the era of completeness will begin. In brief, the era of completeness is experienced in the land that is the residence of a chieftain who subdues the non-Bud­dhist barbarians. The adjacent land, in a clockwise direction, experiences the era of conflict; the next experiences two-quar­ters; and the next to that, three-quarters. [I.B.2.c] The Four Eras of Our World-System These can be understood from the description given [in the previous chapter]. The number of years constituting the eras and other details will not be discussed here. [I.B.2.d] The Four Eras of the Planets Entering Va cuity The following quote from the Wheel of Time Ta ntra51 states the duration of the four eras of the planets' entering vacuity and how this occurs: Empty, empty, space, naga, and hand, the sage, and the moon are the duration of the era of completeness. Space, empty, flavor, nine, and the sun are known as the number of years of the era of three-quarters. Empty, space, the Vedas, flavor, and snake [are] in fact the years of the era of two-quarters. Empty, space, space, eyes, qualities, and sea-treasure are the number of years of the era of conflict. At the end of these years, the group of planets dwell in pure vacuity devoid of houses. 52 A complete transit of the seven planets of the week53 (the sun and the others) and Eclipser through the twenty-seven constel­lations is known as one great planetary day. This lasts approxi-"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Space and Time 165 mately sixty-four years and seven months. One and a half plan­etary days lasts ninety-six years, ten and a half months. The Ta ntra of the Wheel of Time designates this a lesser century. A Wheel of Time year is the length of time in a one-hundred-year period that the pristine wisdom aspect is accumulated: three years and three half-months. This is calculated in the following way: one thirty-second of the 36,000 days of a century is 1,125 days; converted to years and months, this period equals three years and three half-months. A hundred-year period, which includes a Wheel of Time year, is equal to three planetary half days. The first [planetary] half­day embodies lightness; the second, motility; and the third, darkness. These are related, in corresponding order, to the ex­ternal phenomena of phlegm, bile, and wind. When these three -phlegm, bile, and wind-as internal constituents of the hu­man body, are in balance, physical health is maintained. Imbal­ance [of these constituents] causes disease and deterioration of health. Similarly, even in the world, balance [of these elements] preserves [the environment]; imbalance has a destructive in­fluence. Although there may be some imbalance [in our physi­cal health], the aspect of pristine wisdom [nevertheless enters] the central [channel in the proportion appropriate to] the Wheel of Time year. Three planetary days, together with the corresponding [two] Wheel of Time years, equals two hundred years. Each day within this period consists of sixty major clepsydra measures of time; this entire period consists of 4,320,000 major clepsydra measures. In terms of the human body, 4,320,000 breaths are taken during a 200-day period. At the end of this time, some small amount of wind will have entered the central [channel] of even an ordinary individual. In the external [universe], at the end of 4,320,000 years (a period numerically equivalent to the number of major clepsydra measures and breaths), all the planets will enter the vacuity [beyond our universe], complet­ing one great [cycle of] the four eras. Then, beginning with the specific transits, the era of completeness again arises, and so on. This cycle of the four eras thus repeats itself again and again."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"166 Myriad Wo rlds [I.C] A Conclusive Summary The Victorious One did not base his teachings on the belief that a single system is the only valid one, [But taught] in response to the interests and abilities of those he guided.

The omniscient Victorious One did not view any aspect of either the environment or the inhabitants of our world-system as ul­timately real.

Thirty [moments equals] a period; thirty periods, a solar day; Thirty solar days, a month; and twelve months, a year. Based on these units, the measurable and the immeasur-able are calculated. Sixty-four (or sixty, according to some) brief instants elapse during the snap of the fingers of a healthy individual. A single of these brief instants is the smallest unit of time. One hundred and twenty of these units equals one instant. Sixty instants equals one moment. Since there are nine hundred moments in a day, this is one nine-hundredth of a day. Thirty moments equals one period; thirty periods, one solar day; thirty solar days, one month; and twelve months, one year. Time gradually elapses in the twelve continents (the four great and the eight smaller) as the function of the inner and outer aspects of the twelve experiential elements and of the twelve links of interdependent origination. The so-called twelve houses also move in stages. Proficient [use of these units of measurement] permits calcu­lation of time periods, lifespans of individuals, etc., of measur­able durations (measured in hundreds, thousands, ten thou­sands, hundred thousands, and so on) and of that which is [con­sidered to be] immeasurable (i.e., beyond ten to the sixtieth power). [II.B.2.b.iii] Components of Wo rds Individual letters are the components of words. [Groups of words] form sentences. If examined, [words] do not capture [the essence, but are] deceptive. The [Sanskrit] vowel a and the consonant ka are examples of individual letters. A combination of two, three, or more of these letters forms a word. For example, the combination of dha and i is dhi, meaning intelligence, and the combination of three con­sonants [b, d, and dh] and two vowels is [the name] Buddha. A group of several words forms a sentence, namo buddhiiya (\"Hom­age to Buddha\"), for example.

A word conveys [the meaning of an] object; a term, the particu­larities of an object. Upon closer examination, however, a group of words, whether many or few, does not capture the essence [of what is intended to be expressed by it]. It is simply a collection of indi­vidual letters. [To use some analogies,] what appears to be a coarse rope is [just] its strands; what appears to be a camel-hair tassel [is just its] individual filaments; and what appears to be a meadow [is just] individual blades of grass.

[II] MAIN EXPLANATION The main explanation has two parts: (1) refuting non-Buddhist theories of creation, and (2} setting forth the Buddhist theories. [II. A] Refuting Non-Buddhist Theories of Creation The erroneous theories of the non-Buddhists claim that [the world] Was created by Isvara or the sage, or that it arose from the self or naturally. The scriptures of the believers,in Isvara1 state: If Isvara, like a potter [who makes his pots], had not created the manifold world,"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"172 Myriad Worlds The earth would not exist, Mt. Meru would not be, and there would be no ocean. This array of sun, moon, and stars would not be an object of sight. Since they do exist, some say, \"Isvara is the creator of life.\" This expresses the belief that Isvara, like a potter, created these worlds where beings live. On the other hand, the Secretists who adhere to the finality of the Vedas} contend that below all the worlds lives an individual-a great sage called Color of the Sun-who is the creator of the worlds. Others assert that ev­erything arose from the self3 or [non-manifest] principal.4 Ni­hilists5 claim that all worlds and beings have arisen naturally, without [depending on] causes. This is expressed in such words as these: Good lady, what learned [people] say Is misleading like the tracks of a wolf. Who created the pollen-bed of a lotus? Who designed the patterns on the peacock's [feathers]? Who sharpened the tip of the thorn? Everything arose naturally, without causes. There are many erroneous theories [concerning the origin of the world] such as these, fabricated by the confused intellects of non-Buddhist sectarians who are proponents of nihilism or etemalism. [Those who follow] these theories, like blind per­sons trying to determine the topography of a land, do not reach correct conclusions, but stray far from the truth. [II. B) Setting Forth the Buddhist Systems This section has three parts: (1) a general presentation of the causes [that create cyclic life], (2) a detailed explanation of the causes that create the environment, and (3) a presentation of the general process of creation. [II.B.1] The Causes of Cyclic Life This section has two parts: (1) creation caused by actions, and (2) the factor ensuring actions' results. j _j"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"[II.B.l.a] Creation Caused by Actions The Causes of Cyclic Life 173 It is taught in the scriptures that worlds and beings Are created by various actions influenced by subtle and proliferating [emotions]. Who created worlds and beings? The scriptures of the excel­lent teachings of the Transcendent One state that they were not created intentionally by Isvara or by any other creator. [Vasubandhu's Treasury of Phenomenology] states: The various worlds were produced by evolutionary actions. Thus, the Buddha taught that all worlds and living beings were created by collective and personal evolutionary actions influ­enced by subtle and proliferating obscuring emotions. [II.B.l.b] The Factor Ensuring Actions' Results The factor ensuring actions' results is said to be acquired or inevitable, The stream of mental consciousness, the fundamental consciousness, The mere individual, clear light, and so forth. Although an act ceases as soon as it has been done, it will in­evitably produce its effect, even after a hundred eons have passed. What is the factor that makes inevitable the causal pro­cess through which cause and result are connected? Some philosophers who have examined this subject assert that the supporting factor is something acquired or possessed. Others maintain that it is an inevitable phenomenon separate [from the cause or its result]. In either case, some sub-schools of the Analysts maintain that this supporting factor is substan­tially existent while others [maintain that it is] designatively existent. The Idealists assert that fundamental consciousness functions [as the support] upon which the instincts of evolu­tionary actions are imprinted, after which one experiences their ripening. Those who postulate the six groups of consciousness6 but not a fundamental consciousness state that [the support] is the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"17 4 Myriad Worlds continuum of mental consciousness, [itself only] a designation. Some Centrists assert that the supporting factor is designatively existent, [being the] designation of mere \"I\" or mere \"person.\" However many similar philosophical views on this subject there are, all are simply reifications based on partial understanding; they do not reflect the truth. At this point, however, we will not refute or confirm any of these theses. The Mantra perspective can be expressed in this way: A subtle, indestructible individual, the great self or person, who is radiant awareness co-existent with the six impure elements, is in every way the basis for the accumulation of actions. There are two [kinds] of evolutionary action: that which re­sults in shared perception and that which produces personal experience. The former creates the environmental world, and the latter, the inhabitants, sentient beings. The highest yoga tantra, when defining ground, path, and fruition, calls the en­vironmental world \"outer,\" the inhabiting beings \"inner,\" and the ground for the manifestation of both environment and in­habitants-pristine wisdom which accords in quality with those two-\"altemative.\" Both outer [environment] and inner [be­ings] are the pervaded elements; the alternative (pristine wis­dom) is the pervading factor. Together, these are designated as the world-system. \"And so forth\" [in the root text] indicates that many different explanations of this subject, both general and detailed, have been expounded by Indian and Tibetan scholars. [II.B.2] The Causes of the Environment This section has two parts: (1) the perspective of the Analysts and (2) the perspective of the Wheel of Time and other tantras. [II.B.2.a] The Perspective of the Analysts The Analysts and Traditionists state that the environment is created from the wind at the peak [of existence] which remains from the time of destruction, Or from five types of seeds carried from other worlds."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 175 The stream [of phenomena] is undispersed and coheres through [the effect] of concordant actions. Lasting form and time are deceptive impressions within naive minds; It is taught that the exalted ones comprehend the cessation of particles and moments. The Analyst and Tr aditionist Proclaimers, in addition to assert­ing that evolutionary actions cause the formation of the world, maintain that the cause of the first moment of the wind that creates the desire realm at [the outset] of the age of formation is the form realm wind located at the peak [of existence]. This wind is not destroyed during the previous age of destruction and has the power to [initiate] the production of various coarse results caused by [previous] actions. Moreover, a discourse of the Buddha states: Winds come carrying seeds from other world-systems. Based on that source, the environment is [said to be] created from five types of seeds: the seed of the root, the seed which opens, the seed of the seed, the seed of the tip, and the seed of the stalk. To explain, the coarse world forms when many scattered, in­divisible, subtle particles converge. The stream of phenomena, which gives the impression of lasting [over a period of time], remains undispersed by violent winds or other agents and co­heres due to the effect of the concordant evolutionary actions of sentient beings. Lasting appearances-forms such as moun­tains [composed of] many subtle particles, and years [composed of] a sequence of moments-are gross deceptive impressions in the minds of the naive. However, the exalted ones are aware of the impermanence of moments and of subtle particles. As Tsunpa Pel Leg's Seventy Particles7 states: A single hair in the palm of a hand Is not felt by anyone, But if it enters the eye, It causes great discomfort. The naive, who are like the palm of the hand, Do not understand conditioned phenomena as [a collection of] particles; But the exalted, who are like the eye, Understand this and develop disengagement."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"176 Myriad Worlds [II.B.2.b] The Perspective of the Ta ntra of the Wheel of Time Most agree that in the formation [of the world] the mind is the agent, subtle particles and the moving and stationary winds are the objects acted upon, And the [winds' motions] are the means of creation. In order that the perspective of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time may be easily understood, we will explain it in detail employ­ing the format of act, agent, and object acted upon. In the ex­ample of a potter who makes a pot, the [creation of the] pot is the act, the potter is the agent, and the clay is the object acted upon. The production process involving the belt, wheel, etc., is the means of creation. Since the act [the creation of the pot] and agent [the potter] are different in substance, the three-fold [for­mat] of act, agent, and object acted upon, posited in relation to the cause and effect of material objects, is a valid one. [As a second example,] when sense consciousness under­stands a blue appearance as blue, the understanding of blue as blue is the act. Sense consciousness to which blue appears is the agent. Blue is the object acted upon. The blue aspect [ap­pearing] is the means in the process [of understanding blue]. In relation to consciousness understanding an object, the act and the agent are identical in substance. Therefore, [in this case,] the threefold [format] of act, agent, and object acted upon is a nominal one. Of these two [examples], the former will be used here to ex­plain how the physical world is formed. First, what is the agent that corresponds to the potter? Candrakirti's8 Introduction to the Central Way9 states: The mind itself creates living beings And the great variety of worlds where they live. It is also taught that all forms of life are produced from evolutionary actions; But without the mind, there would be no action. Thus, generally speaking [the agent that creates the world] is the minds of beings in general and in particular the minds of those beings who have performed concordant actions (such as"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 177 those that impel them to be born in the same world-system). Principally, [the agent] is the radiant awareness nature of the mind of each being. What is the means of creation that corresponds to [the pro­duction process employing] the [potter's] belt and so forth? The means of creation is described in the following way: from the mind's radiant awareness which is accompanied by the three [factors] of semen, blood, and energy-winds, the three inner lights10 dawn. Following that, the eighty instinctive concep­tions arise. These conceptions activate the instincts (that were created by previous virtuous and non-virtuous actions and that are imprinted on the mind) so that they approach the stage in which the form [of the world] manifests [as their result]. At this point, energy-winds that have a similarity with conscious­ness-which are only manifestations of the [instincts created by the] actions of beings-depart from one world-system and wander in order to form another world-system, moving into the space left empty after the dissolution of the previous world­system. The motions of these energy-winds are the means of creation [of the world]. This is analogous to the movement of a person's vital energy-wind which departs from the corpse af­ter death and wanders until entering a womb in order to be reborn; the movement of this energy-wind is considered to be the means of creation of the body of a person. What are the elements acted upon, corresponding to the clay? [These are twofold]: [First are] the subtle particles that remain scattered during the period when the world-system has been emptied [of manifest form]. These particles are not perceived by the limited eye [consciousness of an ordinary person] but appear to the eye [consciousness] of a yogi.U [Second are] the supports for these particles, the energy-winds that have a simi­larity with consciousness. These two elements are analogous to the internal phenomena acted upon during the fetal devel­opment of the human body-the semen and blood of the par­ents, and the ten energy-winds. The very subtle particles that remain scattered [after the destruction of a world-system] are termed emptied since they are merely a manifestation of men­tal instincts and not the object of sense perception."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"178 Myriad Worlds Two action energy-winds, one mobile and one stationary, are referred to as \"having a similarity with consciousness\": one energy-wind wanders in order to create a new world when a previous world-system has been destroyed; the other energy­wind remains stationary and does not move elsewhere. They are said to have a similarity with consciousness not because they are of the nature of consciousness but because they dis­play an attribute in common with consciousness, just as semen and blood are said to have attributes in common with the moon and sun. What similarity do these energy-winds have with conscious­ness? Consciousness itself lacks color and shape, but due to its character of manifestation, consciousness exhibits various lights. Likewise, the nature of the two action energy-winds is that of space. Nevertheless, they manifest six lights, which can­not be perceived by the senses but are seen by the eye con­sciousness of the yogi. Therefore, the energy-winds have a simi­larity with consciousness [i.e., the lights]. These energy-winds manifest three principal lights (green, blue, and black) and other secondary ones. Ten energy-winds, such as the vital [energy-winds] and so forth, are produced from these lights. The ten energy-winds are classified into three [groups] according to their functions: holding energy-winds, churning energy-winds, and shaping energy-winds. Which of the ten energy-winds perform which functions? With regard to the microcosm [i.e., the human body], the chapter [of the Wheel of Time Ta ntra] \"Ascertaining the Microcosm\"12 states: Oh Lord of Humanity,B the body is created through time in this way: The seeds that are present in the lotus [i.e., womb] are retained by that which holds [i.e., the energy-winds related to the element of earth] and then coalesce by [the action of the energy-winds related to the element of] water. After, the body is brought to maturation by [energy-winds related to the element of] fire, tastes, and tastes14 being consumed. Its growth is caused by [the energy-winds re­lated to the element of] wind. [The energy-winds related to the element of] space also pro­vide room for growth."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 179 This process, applied to the macrocosm [i.e., the universe], is explained as follows: The pervading and gift of the gods [en­ergy-winds] (related to the water element) gather the subtle particles [that remain in space following the destruction of the previous world-system]; the naga and wealth king [energy­winds] (related to the earth element) solidify this conglomer­ate of particles. These are the four holding winds. The churning winds, the ascending and lizard [energy-winds] (related to the fire element), enhance the conglomeration of particles by their churning action. Following the churning and enhancement of the conglomeration of particles, the shaping energy-winds, the heat-accompanied and turtle [energy-winds] (related to the wind element), shape it while developing and placing it in various locations in space. The vital and down­ward-voiding [energy-winds] assist all these winds, as their nature is to facilitate [their functions]. Moreover, with respect to the microcosm, the human embryo develops from the semen and blood of the parents through the gelatin15 and the oblong16 stages to the fish [-shape]l7 and later periods of fetal development. With respect to the macrocosm, this corresponds to the mo­tions of the most refined essences of the five elements [i.e., the particles] at the beginning stage of the formation of the world when the particular sizes and shapes of the wind and the other spherical foundations have not yet formed. First, during the period of space, the subtle particles, characterized by empti­ness, remain scattered. Later, the moving and stationary vital winds (explained above) collide with the subtle particles and cause them to move and cohere. This is the period during which the most refined essence of wind is activated. Just as sparks are produced by striking stones, lightning is generated from the motion and collision of the subtle particles. This is the period during which the most refined essence of fire is set in motion. This produces water which appears like a fine drizzle. This is the period during which the most refined element of water is set in motion. The fine drizzle causes a rainbow to appear in space. This is the period during which the most refined essence of earth is set in motion."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"180 Myriad Worlds These motions produce a great body of water. When the body of water is churned [by winds], its essence becomes the coarse elements. In the microcosm, this corresponds to the turtle-shape period18 [of fetal development] during which the four limbs and the head start to emerge. [Once the coarse elements are produced,] the shaping winds form Mount Meru, the continents and so forth. This corresponds to the pig-shape period19 [of fetal development]. Gradually, the world's configuration forms in its entirety, from the wind sphere foundation up to Mt. Meru. Thus, the power of the different energy-winds produces all the various sizes, shapes, and configurations that appear within our world-system. The distinct action energy-winds themselves are the result of the different manifestations of mind imprinted with instincts [derived from] evolutionary actions. These [dif­ferent manifestations] are produced by the manifestation of the six lights that are coexistent with the six elements. How the coarse world-system is formed from the six lights [is explained] in the Glorious Ta ntra [of the Wheel of Time20], be­ginning with the statement: In the left branch is the white blaze. The lights can be explained by using a format of [two sets of] seven pairs: The green light at the zenith and the blue light at the nadir, which are characterized by the radiant awareness of total emptiness, 21 produce two energy-winds, the vital and the downward-voiding. The black blaze in the east, characterized by approaching fullness,ZZ produces the macrocosmic heat-ac­companied and six other energy-winds. The red blaze in the south, characterized by increase}3 produces the seven fires; these are the five wrathful planets-Fire of Time, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn-plus Lightning and the Horse-faced Fire. The white blaze in the north, characterized by the dawning of inner light,24 produces the seven waters: the five peaceful planets-Eclipser, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Long Tail-plus the rain and the ocean. The yellow blaze in the west, character­ized by coarseness, produces the seven earths: subtle earth, coarse earth, subtle minerals, coarse minerals, subtle stars,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 181 coarse stars, and rainbows. These are the two sets of seven pairs: the earths and winds of the west and east, and the fires and wa­ters of the south and north. There is a single pair, space and pristine wisdom, at the zenith and at the nadir. The elements of this latter pair are the pervading factors and the former four­teen constitute the pervaded field. As implied by this explanation, the shapes and the colors of the four sides of Mt. Meru and of the continents and so forth are created by the six lights. In conclusion, in the formation of a world-system, the mind is the [productive] agent, the environment and inhabitants are the objects [created], and creation is accomplished by evolu­tionary actions. Most discourses and tantras agree with this presentation.

[II.B.3.a.i.A'] General Presentation Six causes and four conditions produce conditioned phenomena; Five results are produced by these [causes]. The Individualists' system of phenomenology follows these excellent explanations."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"182 Myriad Worlds Vasubandhu' s Treasury of Phenomenology27 states: Without causes and conditions, There is no production, no product, and no producer. Various causes and conditions must interact for conditioned phenomena to arise. The scriptures elucidate six major causes and four conditions, as well as five results that they produce. The Individualists' system of phenomenology presents precise explanations based on these scriptures. [II.B.3.a.i.B'] Detailed Explanation This section has four parts: (1) the six causes, (2) the five re­sults, (3) the general classes of resultant phenomena, and (4) the four conditions. [II.B.3.a.i.B'.l '] The Six Causes The productive cause of [a particular phenomenon] is that which is other than the conditioned phenomenon. Coemergent causes are [conditioned phenomena] that are causes and results of one another. Causes of the same outcome are preceding phenomena creating later similar phenomena. Concomitant causes are mind and mental events that share five aspects. Omnipresent causes are defiled phenomena. Developing causes are non-virtue and contaminated virtue. The productive cause of [a particular] conditioned phenomenon includes all things that are other than the conditioned phenom­enon itself. When productive causes are divided into principal and secondary causes, the principal ones are effective produc­tive causes. For example, the eye faculty and [visible] form are the [effective] productive causes that produce the eye conscious­ness. The eye faculty is the [sense]-base [effective] productive cause, and form is the objective [effective] productive cause. Food acts as the [effective] productive cause of the body be­cause it has the ability to nourish the body. With respect to a seed, shoot, leaf, stalk, and so forth, the former is the [effective] l ____j"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Li fe 183 productive cause of the latter in each case because each has the capacity to produce the latter. Secondary [i.e., ineffective] pro­ductive causes cannot produce [results], but are included in this category because they do not obstruct [the production of phenomena]. Coemergent causes are any conditioned phenomena that arise simultaneously and act as causes and results of one another. The four main elements [earth, water, fire, and air] are co-emer­gent causes of one another. Mental factors and [the primary] mind are mutual [co-emergent causes]. Similarly, the charac­teristics of conditioned phenomena, such as arising and so forth, and phenomena that possess [such] characteristics are mutual causes and results. Therefore, most conditioned phenomena can be considered as co-emergent causes, comparable to travellers who journey together and help one another on the journey. Causes of the same outcome are preceding phenomena that pro­duce later similar phenomena. For example, barley [is the cause of] similar barley; rice, the cause of rice. Similarly, the five vir­tuous aggregates act as the causes for the same outcome-vir­tuous aggregates; non-virtue and obscured neutral [phenom­ena] act as the causes for the same outcome-defiled [phenom­ena]; and non-obscured, neutral [phenomena] produce non­obscured, neutral [phenomena]. Concomitant causes denotes mind or mental factors that are concordant by virtue of sharing five factors-[sense-] base, objective object, aspect, time, and substance. The six consciousnesses, together with their respective supporting [sense faculties], are concomitant and identical at the moment [of engagement] of the sense faculties. Thus, they act as con­comitant causes for one another and as co-emergent causes. [Concomitant causes] are like travellers who do everything identically-sharing food, drink, baths, bedding, etc.-while on a journey. Omnipresent causes are the common [factors] relinquished [on the path of] seeing28 that produce defiled [phenomena] as their result. The Tr easury of Phenomenology's presentation of the subtle and proliferating obscuring emotions uses the term omnipres­ent for the eleven subtle and proliferating [emotions]."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"184 Myriad Worlds A developing cause is non-virtue or contaminated virtue that has the ability to produce a developed result. [Developing causes] are like faultless seeds coming into contact with hu­midity. Neutral factors do not become developing causes; they are like rotten seeds. Even uncontaminated virtues are not [de­veloping causes] because although they have potency, they do not bring about developed [results] since craving does not ex­ist [at the stage of an exalted one]. They are like healthy seeds never exposed to humidity. [II.B.3.a.i.B'.2'] The Five Results Developed results arise after their causes, pertain to a continuum, And are unobscured and neutral. Results concordant with the causes are of a type similar to the same outcome and omnipresent [causes]. Freedom results are cessations attained through appreciative discernment. Caused results are attainments through the power of the causes. Owned results [which are exclusively] conditioned phenomena arise from non-hindering phenomena. What is the nature of the five results? Developed results are pro­duced by developing causes and arise subsequent to their causes. They pertain to the continuums of individuals, and are unobscured and neutral. Examples of developed results are higher existences [resulting) from virtue and lower existences [resulting] from non-virtue. Results concordant with [their] causes are produced by either a cause of the same outcome or an omnipresent cause and are of a type concordant [to the cause]. Examples of results concor­dant with their causes are a short life [resulting] from killing and a long life [resulting] from giving up [killing]. Freedom results refers to cessations [of obscurations] achieved through the power of analytical discrimination. [A cessation is defined as] the attainment of the exhaustion [of obscurations] by eliminating the factors that are to be relinquished by means"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 185 of appreciative discernment. The relinquishments [and] real­izations of the four [types] of exalted ones29 are examples of freedom results. Results caused by persons, [also called] results caused by the actions of persons, denotes any results produced and acquired through the power of any cause [created by a person]-crops [produced] by farming, for instance. Owned results are exclusively conditioned phenomena and arise from what is non-hindering. Such results arise from con­ditioned phenomena or things that are merely non-hindering [to their arising]. They do not [exist in] the past, but arise in the present and future. Examples are the owned results of virtue and non-virtue. [II.B.3.a.i.B' .3'] General Classes of Results It is asserted that [results] are all conditioned phenomena, as well as the attainment of freedom, And that the two unconditioned phenomena lack causes and results. The following citation provides a general definition of result­ant phenomena: What are resultant phenomena? [They include] all condi­tioned phenomena and cessations attained through analyti­cal discrimination. In general, result refers to all conditioned phenomena, as well as analytical cessations or perfect peace, the freedom from ob­scuring emotions attained by applying the remedial path. Space and non-analytical cessations (both unconditioned phenomena) are considered to be without causes or results since no causal relations exist with respect to these. Being unproduced, no causes or conditions produced [them]; being timeless, they do not have the capacity to produce a result. Developed [results] arise [from] the last [cause]; owned results from the first. Results concordant with the cause [from] the third and fifth; caused [results] from the second and fourth."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"186 Myriad Wo rlds What are the causes of the five results? Developed results arise from developing causes (the last mentioned in the section on causes) because developed results are the results of non­virtue or contaminated virtue. Owned results are results of productive causes (the first of the six causes) because they are results that are possessed by an owner. Owned results are merely non-obscured, owned [phe­nomena]. Their [productive] causes, however, are not merely non-obscuring, but also produce results. For instance, the five consciousnesses, such as the eye-consciousness and so forth, are produced by the productive causes of the ten experiential elements. Similarly, the environmental world is produced by the productive causes of actions. Results concordant with the causes arise from causes of the same outcome (the third) and omnipresent causes (the fifth) because they are similar to these causes. Results caused by a person are produced by co-emergent causes (the second) and concomitant causes (the fourth). The acts or activity of a person are none other than the nature of that person, and the results are that same person. Likewise, the agents of these causes are the causes themselves, and the re­sults are also [coemergent and concomitant causes]. If this is carefully analyzed, [it can be understood that] results caused by a person may also be produced by the same outcome, omni­present, or productive causes. [II.B.3.a.i.B'.4') The Four Conditions Except for the productive cause, the five [other] causes are causal conditions. Mind and mental factors producing results that arise immediately are immediate [conditions]. Phenomena suitable to be objects of the six conscious­nesses are objective conditions. Phenomena that do not obstruct arising are dominant conditions. Four conditions are explained in the scriptures. Causal condi­tion refers to all of the [above-mentioned] causes with the ex-"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 187 ception of the productive cause: the co-emergent, concomitant, same outcome, omnipresent, and developing [causes]. These all act as productive conditions, assisting the production of their own respective results. Productive causes are not considered to be causal conditions because unconditioned phenomena are included within the category of productive causes. Thus, to include productive causes in this category would contradict the assertion that [only] conditioned phenomena are causal conditions. Concomitant immediate conditions are the mind and mental fac­tors that bring about their own results immediately. When the [previous mind or mental factors] cease, the new ones (of the same substance and not of another concordant type) arise in­stantly without being interrupted by similar [mind and mental factors] of a concordant type. Objective conditions are conditioned and unconditioned phe­nomena that are suitable to be objects of the six consciousnesses (such as the eye [consciousness] and so forth). For example, the experiential element of form is the objective condition that is correlated with eye consciousness. A dominant condition is any phenomenon that does not ob­struct the arising of a conditioned phenomenon different from itself. The dominant condition and the productive mentioned above are mutually inclusive. More phenomena belong to this category of condition than to any other. The arising, functioning, etc., [of conditions] can be learned from [Vasubandhu's] treatise. What are the conditions that produce any specific phenom­ena? How many conditions are necessary? When and how do the different conditions function? How do the conditions [that produce] the elements and the evolutes of the elements func­tion? An elaboration of these and other subjects would be end­less. To fully understand [these subjects], one should refer to Vasubandhu' s Treasury of Phenomenology. Since at the very least an understanding of the enumeration of causes and conditions and their definitions is indispensable; these have been presented here."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"188 Myriad Worlds [II.B.3.a.ii) The Universalists' System of Phenomenology This section has three parts: an explanation of (1) causes, (2) conditions, and (3) results. [II.B.3.a.ii.A'] The Causes Productive causes which produce [a result]; assisting, co-emergent [causes]; Augmenting or same outcome [causes]; concomitant causes, sharing four factors; Defiled omnipresent causes; developing causes of the body: All may be categorized as productive causes, Which the Synthesis of Phenomenology sets forth as twenty classes. The Universalists give names to causes, conditions, and results that are similar [to those of the Individualists]. However, the causes, conditions, and results are asserted in slightly different ways and therefore are explained separately here. A cause is termed productive or essential when it has been defi­nitely ascertained to be the producer of a particular result. Phenomena that initially arise from the same [cause] and then continue to remain together while giving support to each other are called co-emergent causes or accompanying causes.30 This is comparable to two siblings who are born from the same mother and then continue to live together while giving support to each other. Co-emergent causes are of three types: external, internal, and both. The first refers to the four elements and evolutes of these elements. Each particle of the four elements has eight material particles [earth, water, fire, air, form, smell, taste, and touch]. Although the ceasing of the first moment of an earth particle and the arising of the second moment of a water particle occur simultaneously, a slight causal relationship exists between the former and the latter: they arise from the same productive cause and belong to the same conglomerate. An example in relation to an element evolute is the taste and form of cane sugar. .i l _j"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 189 The second kind, [internal co-emergent causes,] refers to mind and mental factors. Mind and mental factors are co-emergent causes because they arise from the same cause, exist together, and are the cause and effect of one another. The third, [co-emergent causes that are both internal and ex­ternal,] are [phenomena] that are [only] designated as cause and effect, like the cause and effect [relationship] of ascribing a definition in relation to the object to be defined. Causes of the same outcome or augmenting causes refers to vir­tue resulting in virtue, non-virtue resulting in non-virtue, or neutral [phenomena] resulting in neutral [phenomena]. They are increasing causes because they develop or increase [their results]. These are also called concordant causes since their [ef­fects] are necessarily of the same state and same nature. For example, in order for a desire realm [being's] emotion of at­tachment to be a concordant cause, it must produce an emo­tion of the same state-that of the desire realm. It must not produce an emotion of the two higher realms. In this way, it would be of the same state. The emotions [produced] must not be of a dissimilar type, but of the same type-attachment pro­duced as a result of attachment, for instance. Concomitant causes are causes that are similar by virtue of sharing four common factors, or causes of concordant under­standing. Both primary mind and accompanying mental fac­tors have the same productive cause, the same objective object, the same continuum with respect to the object, and a single or identical aspect (i.e., perceptual pattern). For example, the eye consciousness arises from its substantial cause, the stimulation of the instincts present in the fundamental [consciousness]. According to a different explanation, it arises from the first moment of a similar type of consciousness. Likewise, mental factors, such as feeling, which accompany that [consciousness], arise from the [same] causes. The eye consciousness focuses on visual form; its objective condition and likewise [its correlated] mental factors, such as feeling, also focus on it. The object of experience of visual consciousness pertains to the person's [ex­periential] continuum; the object of experience of the mental factors such as feeling similarly pertain to that continuum. Eye"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"190 Myriad Worlds consciousness has a perceptual pattern that perceives the as­pect of form; mental factors, such as feeling, also have a per­ceptual pattern that perceives form. Therefore, both mind and mental factors are concomitant in that they share four common factors. Omnipresent causes are emotions that produce emotions. [Omnipresent] indicates their functioning throughout the three realms. Since omnipresent causes interfere with beings' attain­ment of liberation, they are also called obstructive causes. The type, state, and other factors [of the results of omnipresent causes] are indefinite. For instance, anger may be the cause that produces desire or pride. Also, the result of the emotions of the desire realm [may] serve as the basis for the emotions of the two higher realms. Developing causes are the causes that produce the body, i.e., its development [or result]. They are also called appropriating causes since their effect is to assume a physical form. [Devel­oping causes consist of either] contaminated virtuous or non­virtuous [actions] which produce neutral results. For example, the body of a hell being is the result of non-virtuous develop­ing causes. Although the experiences of the various sufferings of hell are impelled by non-virtue, the body, the basis [for the experiences of these sufferings], is definitely a neutral [result]. Similarly, contaminated virtuous actions impel [a rebirth as] a god, but the resultant body of a god is not virtuous in itself but solely a neutral phenomenon. All these causes can be subsumed under productive causes alone. Since productive causes are causes that produce results, ineffective productive causes are not asserted in this system. Asanga's Synthesis of Phenomenology presents twenty distinct classifications of productive causes: causes for arising, [for ex­ample, the arising] of previously non-existant results; sustain­ing causes, [for example, sustaining] the body by eating food; supportive causes, like a container that holds water; causes for continuation, [for example, the continuation of] previously existant types [of phenomena]; causes for transformation, for instance, the change from childhood to adolescence; separat­ing causes, [for instance, separation] from what was previously"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 191 owned; transmuting causes, [for instance,] transmuting gold into statues of humans and gods; causes for proving, [for in­stance, proving] something as conditioned phenomena by rea­son of its having birth, abiding, and cessation; achieving causes, [for instance,] achieving the result by meditation on the path; propelling causes, [for instance,] projecting into another place and time; accomplishing causes which directly produce [their resultant] phenomena; disruptive causes; causes for the aging of any phenomena; causes for the abiding of what previously existed; causes for ascertainment, [for instance, that in a par­ticular place] there is fire by the reason [that there is] smoke; causes for non-ascertainment, [for instance, that] there is fire by reason that there is no smoke; and other causes. [II.B.3.a.ii.B'] The Conditions Causal conditions are the five causes and the funda­mental consciousness. The objective condition is the perceived object. The dominant condition is the support. The immediate condition is asserted in the third way. When four conditions are present, consciousness generates consciousness; When there are two or three, consciousness produces coarse objects. In this system, the five causes explained above-co-emergent, same outcome, concomitant, omnipresent, and developing­are considered to be categorical causal conditions. Not all the causes that fall into the five categories necessarily act as causal conditions. However, since causal conditions are included within all five categories, all five are considered as such. The Universalists' system of phenomenology also explains that the main substantial causal condition for all external and internal phenomena is the fundamental consciousness, or more specifi­cally, the developed aspect of the fundamental consciousness. The five other causal conditions are in fact cooperative condi­tions [to the fundamental consciousness]. Objective conditions are objects perceived or objective objects. The five non-conceptual sense consciousnesses clearly perceive"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"192 Myriad Worlds their respective objective conditions-the aspect of form, etc. These, therefore, are considered as the objects perceived by these consciousnesses. In the case of conceptual consciousness, the objective basis is merely the pattern of appearance or appre­hension [of that conceptual consciousness]. Dominant conditions serve as supports for all phenomena, comparable to a container that holds water, preventing it from spilling out. The general dominant condition [for phenomena] is the fundamental consciousness, and the exclusive dominant conditions are the five sense faculties which provide the bases for the five sense consciousnesses. The dominant conditions for external appearances are the specific supports, locations, and bases of phenomena. The Synthesis of Phenomenology31 lists nine types of dominant conditions: Support, propellent, co-emergence, object, Birth, location, experience of results [of actions], Mundane purity, and transcendent purity: All [act] as dominant conditions [for external appearances]. Both objective conditions and dominant conditions are included among productive causes. The immediately preceding condition is asserted in three differ­ent ways. Teachers of the [Treasury ofl Phenomenology maintain that the immediate condition has three characteristics: it is simi­lar to its resultant phenomenon; it shares the same cause; and it immediately precedes [its result]. [Some] assert that the imme­diate condition provides the opportunity for any phenomenon to arise by not hindering it and serves as an aid to its [produc­tion]. [Others] assert that the immediate condition merely di­rects consciousness towards the object. The [Universalists'] sys­tem of phenomenology accepts the last of these three assertions. When all four conditions [the causal condition, objective con­dition, dominant condition, and immediate condition] are present, consciousness generates [the subsequent] conscious­ness: the former eye consciousness produces the latter one, for example. When two or three of these conditions are present, consciousness produces the appearance of coarse objects, and coarse objects produce coarse objects. To explain, in order for consciousness to produce the appearance of coarse objects, two"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 193 conditions are necessary: the causal conditions (i.e., instincts within the fundamental consciousness) and the co-emergent condition. An example of this is formative actions impelling [a being] to take rebirth. In order for coarse objects to produce coarse objects, two conditions are necessary. However, accord­ing to those who assert that the immediate condition is a previ­ous similar type [of phenomenon], the immediate condition should also be present. In this case, three conditions are neces­sary [for coarse objects to produce coarse objects]. [II.B.3.a.ii.C'] Results Freedom results are cessations without causes. Owned results pertain to external phenomena. Developed results pertain to the continuums of beings. Caused results [arise from] creating causes; results con-cordant with causes [arise] from same outcome [causes]. Freedom results are cessations that have not been produced by causes. Analytical cessations are actual freedom results since they are superficial phenomena. The truth of cessation that is the ultimate nature [of phenom­ena] is freedom itself and is a nominal [freedom] result. The ultimate sphere of reality is considered to be a nominal result because the intrinsic dimension of awakening, itself inseparable from the sphere of reality, is referred to as a result. In fact, the ultimate sphere of reality is not a true result because uncondi­tioned phenomena cannot logically be described in terms of actual causes and results. Owned results pertain to external objects. A non-analytic view­point accepts the existence of external objects: from that per­spective, the environment and external form, sound, taste, smell, and touch are owned results. From a slightly analytical stand­point, the existence of external phenomena is not accepted. However, from that perspective, the aspect of consciousness appearing as places and the aspect of consciousness appearing as objects, etc., are considered as owned results. Developed results pertain to the [experiential] continuums of sentient beings. Examples include the five appropriated aggre-"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"194 Myriad Worlds gates integral to the body [when the existence of external ob­jects is accepted] and the aspect of consciousness manifesting [as the five aggregates, when the existence of external objects is not accepted]. Caused results include all phenomena that arise from pro­ductive causes. Results concordant with their causes include all phenomena that arise from causes of the same outcome. The main [causes, conditions, and results] have been ex­plained above-this does not, however, constitute a definitive presentation of this subject. Generally speaking, any cause that produces a phenomenon must fall into one of two categories of causes: defiled cause (i.e., the fundamental consciousness which possesses the in­stincts for cyclic life) or pure cause (the uncontaminated poten­tial). The first-the defiled cause, the fundamental conscious­ness with all the types of instincts that are potentials for cyclic life-serves as the cause of everything that is defiled in the three realms of cyclic life. The pure cause is the uncontaminated potential imprinted upon the fundamental consciousness. This cause, in Asanga's Synthesis of Phenomenology,32 is called \"the potential that arises from learning\" which indicates that the nature of the [uncon­taminated potential] is not merely a propensity developed by ordinary virtue (such as generosity and ethics) imprinted [on the fundamental consciousness]. Rather, its nature is an acquired propensity [that leads] one to comprehend the qualities of the Buddha's body, speech, and mind. In this system, the excel­lent teachings [of the Buddha] are the concordant cause for the reality dimension of awakening-the Buddha's mind. Therefore, the main [uncontaminated potential] is the propen­sity acquired from the study of these teachings and the conse­quent understanding of the profound secret aspects of Buddha's body, speech, and mind. This potential imprinted on the fun­damental consciousness eventually becomes the cause for an individual's attainment of freedom. Because it leads to freedom, this potential is said to be uncontaminated. Not ev­ery sentient being necessarily possesses this uncontaminated potential."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 195 The uncontaminated potential is also explained as either the cause present from birth or the cause that arises from educa­tion. The first is a developed aspect of the fundamental [con­sciousness] and the second is the causal aspect. For example, due to the development of the potential from learning in previ­ous [lives], in this life one is born naturally endowed with su­perlative wisdom-wisdom present from birth. A great deal of learning in this life develops the [uncontaminated] potential; cultivation of this potential leads to superlative wisdom-wis­dom arising from education. These [explanations concerning contaminated and uncon­taminated causes] supplement the discussion on results.

Thus, the wheel of twelve links continually turns."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"196 Myriad Worlds A general overview of the causes and conditions that produce conditioned phenomena as asserted by the common spiritual ways has been presented above. The ultimate view of the exceptional [systems concerning the creation of cyclic life] is presented here. The Disclosure of the Awakening Mind33 by the exalted [Nagar-juna] says: I maintain that just as sugar cane is sweet And the nature of fire is heat, The nature of all phenomena Is emptiness. Cyclic life, evolutionary actions, and their results do not ultimately exist. [Their nature] is just emptiness, lacking true status. Nevertheless, [cyclic life, etc.,] have a superficial mode of appearance: various causes and conditions perpetuate the motion of the wheel of the twelve links of interdependent origi­nation which turns around and around on the path of exist­ence. As the Exalted One's [Disclosure of the Awakening Mind34] says: I assert that the process that unfolds From ignorance to old age and death-The twelve links of interdependent origination­Is similar to an illusion or to a dream. This wheel of twelve links Turns on the path of existence. (II.B.3.b.i.A'.2'] Detailed Explanation Adherence to a self is the root of cyclic life. Emotions produce actions and suffering. These lead to [the cycle of suffering] which manifests like [dreams during] sleep. Dharmakirti's Treatise on Va lid Cognition35 states: When \"I\" exists, \"other\" is known. Self and other produce grasping and aversion. All faults arise In relation to these. The root of cyclic life and of an individual's course of experi­ence throughout it is the conception of \"I.\" This \"I\" is the con-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 197 ceived object of the instinctive self-habit that apprehends \"I\" and \"property.\" Self-habit and property-habit are the bases for all defiled views and emotions, such as desire. These gener­ate formative actions that result [in rebirth]. These in tum lead to all the suffering of existence. Furthermore, the formations of actions and emotions cause the cycle of suffering to recur continually. The cycle of suffering seems to be very real. However, if one examines it closely, one can see that it is only the magical dis­play of emptiness. It appears although it is without reality, like the dream images seen when one is asleep [or] the hairs [seen] by a person with cataracts, etc. The Exalted One's [Disclosure of the Awakening Mind36] says: Empty phenomena produce empty phenomena. Agent, action, and experienced result Are :Superficial [reality]. This, in brief, is what the Victorious One taught. Further37: Emotions and evolutionary actions create superficial reality; Actions are instigated by the mind. Mind is the sum of all instincts; Freedom from instinctual patterns is happiness. A happy mind is quietude itself; A quiet mind is not obscured. The unobscured [mind] knows reality; To know reality is to attain freedom. In his first cycle of teachings, the Buddha taught that the root of cyclic life is self-habit, and that the cause of suffering and its origin is attachment. In the middle cycle, he taught that the root of cyclic life is the fabrication of grasping identifiable char­acteristics (i.e., habitual adherence to subject and object). In the last cycle, he taught that the root of cyclic life is fundamental consciousness itself. The father tantras of the highest Secret Mantra [teach that] the bases for the origin of existence are the sets of the four emptinesses and the four elements. The mother tantras assert that cyclic life arises from the indestructible vital essence or mundane innate [bliss]."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"198 Myriad Worlds (II.B.3.b.i.B'] The Twelve Links in Relation to the Eight Consciousnesses The beginningless nature of mind is empty, clear, [and] unobstructed, But its nature is not recognized. [The fundamental consciousness,] stirred by mental creations, produces dualistic appearances [and] the consciousnesses. Feeling develops from acceptance and rejection; discernment, from objectification-habit. [Discernment leads to] mental formations which are mental factors; habitual adherence creates form. With attachment and grasping as a link, the wheel of existence turns. This subject is a vast one if treated in detail. To further one's understanding of it, one should study the clear explanations given in such [texts] as the commentary on [Karmapa Rangjung Dorje's] Profound Inner Meaning [called] the Elucidation of the Profound Meaning and the commentary on the Showing of the Essence called the Elucidation of the Philosophy of Rangjung Dorje. What follows is simply a commentary on the words of the root verses written above. The Phenomenology Scripture38 states: The sphere [of reality] without commencement Is the source of all phenomena. Because the sphere of reality exists, Cyclic life and perfect peace exist. The nature [of mindL being free of fabrications, is empty. Its character is unobscured clarity; its expression is unobstructedly manifest. This intrinsically pure nature of mind, existing from time without beginning, is the sphere of reality. It is transcen­dent reality without intrinsic objectivity. The nature of mind is not recognized: Its unborn nature is conceived as self; its unimpeded radiance is conceived as other. Thus, the unobstructed creativity [of mind] appears as subject and object. Mental formations with regard to objects and mind agitate the fundamental consciousness like waves on water. The objective object and subjective consciousness, although not dif­ferent, manifest as two and are apprehended as other and self."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 199 [This dualistic apprehension] produces [the aggregate of con­sciousness], comprised of the six consciousnesses which ap­prehend objects as external. The increased manifestations of instincts create coarse deceptive appearances. These appear to the consciousnesses as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral [objects], and as a consequence are regarded with acceptance, rejection, or indifference. In this way, the aggregate of feeling develops. The aggregate of discernment is produced by the varying degrees of the objectification-habit with respect to objects per­ceived. Discrimination of the individual features of objects causes mental formations to occur with respect to them. These lead to the [aggregate] of formations constituted by the vari­ous mental factors. These mental formations stabilize instincts, which in turn produce habitual adherence to the nature of form, its characteristics, etc. The aggregate of form develops from this adherence. The [five aggregates] have been presented here in their causal order. The Treasury of Phenomenology presents the [aggregates] in order of defilement or coarseness, beginning with [the coars­est,] the aggregate of form, and concluding with the most subtle. The Treasury39 states: The order is [presented] in terms of coarseness or defilement. Although their orders differ, the two presentations are not contradictory. [Once the five aggregates have formed,] desire and craving for an object, together with grasping to obtain the desired object, serve as the links that empower the formative actions to create existence. Consequently, one takes birth in a new life, [eventually experiencing aging and death]. In this way, the wheel of deception turns perpetually throughout cyclic life. The wheel [of the twelve links] is set in motion because one's own nature is not recognized, just like the deception that oc­curs when a magical illusion is not recognized as a magical illusion or when a dream is not recognized as a dream.

To summarize what has been said above, three different men­tal instincts imprinted on the fundamental [consciousness] cause three different deceptive appearances: objects such as form; subjects, or consciousnesses that apprehend [objects]; and one's own body. These three appear but have no reality. Thus, like dust on a mirror, instincts obscure the mind's radiant aware­ness, and [beings] wander throughout cyclic life. Maitreya's Scripture Ornament40 states: The three appear in three [aspects]. The meaning of this quotation is elucidated in the works of Drime Ozer (Longchenpa), Samantabhadra in person. The environmental world, the five objects such as form, The eight consdousnesses, and virtuous and negative actions [develop from objective instincts]. [Adherence to] the forms of the six [types of] beings, and the object, agent, and action Generate object and subject, which in turn produce emotions. [Emotions] create cyclic life without beginning or end. The outer world and the five [types] of objects that find sup­port in it-form, sound, smell, taste and touch--do not exist anywhere, externally or internally. Nonetheless, due to object­oriented instincts, objects appear to the mind as if they were externally existent. One adheres to them as [external] objects, and thus they become objects to be rejected or accepted. The constructive thought that the conceived object is external, ex­pressed as \"this is form,\" is the objective constructive thought. The group of eight consciousnesses consists of the funda­mental consciousness, defiled mind, and the six consciousnesses. Actions are instigated by these [eight] consciousnesses; these include virtuous (meritorious) and non­virtuous (negative) ones. Instincts based on these actions re­main in the mind just as ore and gold are found together. As the power of these subjective instincts increases, the eight"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Causes of Cyclic Life 201 consciousnesses apprehend their respective objects both con­ceptually and non-conceptually. This is the process of subjec­tive constructive thought. Because of body-oriented instincts, the six types of beings­the matrices for the arising of subject and object-adhere in­tensely to [their] individual forms and [their functions in terms of] object, agent, and action. Even while dreaming, they adhere to their bodies [as real]. Consequently, they experience plea­sure and pain, and the strength of the three types of instincts increases, causing deceptive subjective and objective appear­ances to manifest. Rejection or acceptance of those [deceptive appearances] increases the power of obscuring emotions, lead­ing to the accumulation of evolutionary actions. In this way, the beginningless and endless chain of cyclic life continuously recreates itself. Instincts [created] from time without beginning produced our succession of past lives. Habituation to the stream of past lives has led us into the present life. Habituation to the experiences of this present life, such as dreams influenced by the [events] of the day, forms instincts [that will manifest as] objects, sub­jects, and bodies of future lives.

Examination reveals that aging and death arise from birth, which in turn arises from grasping, which is produced by at­tachment, and so on through the other links [of interdepen­dent origination].

What is the fundamental nature of the original, primordial ground of being, before buddhas appear by realizing it and before sentient beings appear by not realizing it? To answer this, the tradition of Great Perfection states that six claims con­cerning the ground based on the perspectives of persons who adhere to philosophical tenets are mistaken: the claim that [the ground] is (1) spontaneous; or (2) indeterminate; or (3) deter­minate; or (4) transmutable into anything; or (5) can be defined in any possible way; or (6) that it is manifold and multifaceted. These six impressions of the ground are erroneous in that they are partial descriptions of the ground.

(5) The assertion that [the ground] can be defined in any pos­sible way is mistaken because if phenomena are infinite, the ground would also be infinite.

(6) The assertion that [the ground] is manifold is mistaken because such a ground would be unsuitable as the basis for authentic freedom, since a ground related to many thought constructs cannot be a primordially pure ground. These six impressions, each in its own way, are erroneous in that they give one-sided views of the ground.

The primordial purity of the original ground is the domain of a practitioner of the path [of Great Perfection] who is free from the erroneous biases of conceiving [the ground] in various arti­ficial ways and who has the correct [understanding] of the ground as primordial purity. [The primordial purity of the ground] wholly transcends words, concepts, and formulations, and surpasses the limita­tions of existing or not existing."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"206 Myriad Wo rlds The nature of the ground is primordially pure. Thus, the ground transcends the limitations of permanence or existence: it cannot be reduced to substantial or objectifiable characteris­tics. The character of the ground is spontaneous, and therefore the ground surpasses the limitation of non-existence or annihi­lation. It is radiant intrinsic awareness, the pure reality of emp­tiness itself, natural and primordial enlightenment, the immu­table wisdom of the reality dimension of awakening. Existing neither as cyclic life nor perfect peace, it remains primordially empty. It is great self-existing wisdom, primordially present like space. As [the nature of the ground] is primordial purity, isn't it il­logical for sentient beings to be deceived into cyclic life? Since beings are intrinsically free, no real stains remain to be purified and no innate deception or freedom can be identified. How­ever, beings are deceived into cyclic life because [freedom and deception], like the freedom and deception [experienced in a] dream, manifest as the simple play of intrinsic awareness, non-existent from the first moment they are experienced and therefore primordially pure. If the character [of the ground] is spontaneous, wouldn't liv­ing beings be effortlessly liberated since the goal [i.e., enlight­enment] is innate? Because [the ground] is spontaneous, the dimensions of awakening and the pristine wisdoms of the sphere [of reality] are complete in their pure nature from the very beginning. Nevertheless, an actualization [of the dimen­sions of awakening and of pristine wisdoms] in the primordial [ground] occurs [when beings], in a manner comparable to waking from sleep, become free from incidental stains. When the [ground of being] arises as manifestation within its own nature, the ground serves as the basis for both freedom and deception and is therefore called the common ground. Be­cause it serves as the basis for freedom, it is called the ground of freedom. Because it also serves as the basis for the deception of sentient beings, it is called the ground for deception. The ground's manifestation is of a single nature, but when distin­guished in terms of [serving as the basis for] freedom, decep­tion, [or both,] it is threefold. --"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 207 Here, the word primordial (in \"primordial purity\") means \"basic\" or \"fundamental\" and is synonymous with \"original,\" \"from the beginning,\" \"from the primordium,\" and so on. [II.B.3.b.ii.B' .1 '.b' .ii'] Precise Explanation of the Primordially Pure Character of the Ground Two or three pristine wisdoms are inherent to the character [of the ground of being]. Tw o or three pristine wisdoms are inherent to the primordially pure character [of the ground of being]. Two exist in this way: Intrinsic awareness is devoid of sub­stantiality and therefore indivisible from emptiness. Based on this indivisibility, the character comprises two pristine wisdoms: the pristine wisdom of the primordially pure nature, which is free of mentation, and the pristine wisdom of the spontaneous character, which is the original radiance glowing deep within. The Sixth Expanse4 states: The nature [of the ground] is primordial purity; Its character is spontaneous accomplishment. The nature aspect [of the ground] transcends the limitations of existing and not existing. The character aspect [of the ground] consists of the creative potential of the ground. The intrinsic indivisibility of these two is Great Perfection, free of limitations. The Intrinsically Free Awareness5 states: [Great Perfection] is freedom from the stains of the four limits. Three pristine wisdoms are inherent [to the ground of pri­mordial purity], as stated in Vajrasattva, Mirror of the Heart6: Know that the ground has three attributes: Nature, character, and energy. The reality dimension of awakening exists as the dimension of the originally pure nature and is therefore the basis for the aris­ing of the three dimensions of awakening which are always inherently present in it. The reality dimension of awakening does not, however, have any diversified and objectifiable at­tributes, such as face and hands."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"208 Myriad Worlds The character [of the ground] is clear [pristine wisdom], present as five lights. The three effulgences7 (of these lights) are of original innate clarity; however, they do not exist as sepa­rate entities with particular colors. The energy [of the ground] is present as intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom: its quality of knowing manifests in various ways, clearly and unobstructedly, without a dualistic experi­ence involving an observer and an observed object. These pristine wisdoms (nature, character, and energy) are inherent to the primordially pure original ground of being sim­ply as the creative potential of this ground, but they are not manifest. It is therefore consistent [to say] that two pristine wisdoms (that of the primordially pure nature and the sponta­neous character) unfold at the time of enlightenment. The Con­densed Transcendent Wisdom Scripture8 states: Without pristine wisdom, there would be no qualities to develop, no awakening, And the oceans of the buddhas' virtues would not arise. When intrinsic awareness dwells in the ground of being (i.e., is present as the inner sphere of reality), it is present at the begin­ning and the end9 as an inner glow which is not manifest as dimensions of awakening and lights. When intrinsic awareness arises from the ground, it then manifests its intrinsic effulgent luminosity. Intrinsic awareness dwelling in the heart is called intrinsic awareness dwelling in the temporary ground. However, in that case, intrinsic awareness has already arisen from the sphere of reality as cyclic life and has not yet reached the place of free­dom; therefore, it is still considered to be the manifestation of the ground. To explain, immature intrinsic awareness10 dwells, like an unhatched peacock, in the expanse of the self-radiant five lights, which is like the peacock's egg. When the manifes­tations of the path-the four visions-occur, intrinsic aware­ness arises like a rainbow in space. Once the material [body] is purified, intrinsic awareness is perfected and develops into the dimensions of awakening, like [the peacock] emerging from its egg. Consequently, the ground of the sphere of reality and the"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 209 temporary ground differ in that the former does not have a visible luminous halo and the latter does. [In summary,] the nature [of the ground] is the indivisibility of emptiness and clarity; its character is the indivisibility of clar­ity and emptiness; and its energy is the indivisibility of intrin­sic awareness and emptiness. To use examples of its presence in us, the nature, a primordially pure pristine wisdom, is present like a clear sky; the character, a spontaneous pristine wisdom, is like a limpid ocean; and the energy, an all-pervasive pristine wisdom, is like an immaculate jewel. [II.B.3.b.ii.B' .1' .c'] The Eight Wa ys the Ground of Being Manifests The spontaneity of the ground manifests as eight gates. The original ground of the primordially pure (inner) sphere of reality [is called] the youthful vase-body. When its seal breaks, the energy-wind of pristine wisdom is set in motion. The move­ment of the energy-wind of wisdom causes intrinsic awareness to emerge from the ground of being. This intrinsic awareness itself manifests as the eight gates of being's spontaneity. At that time, the manifestation of the primordially pure dimension of reality appears above, like a cloudless sky. The manifestation of the enjoyment dimension realms of clear light which per­vades the expanse of space appears directly in front. From the creativity of intrinsic awareness, the great manifestation of the ground appears below. From the creativity of intrinsic aware­ness, the manifestation of the enjoyment dimension of awak­ening appears further below; and [around it] the realms of the natural manifest dimension of awakening appear in the cardi­nal and intermediate directions. Still further below, the count­less realms that are personal perceptions of the six types of be­ings appear through the gate of cyclic life. Everything arises naturally from the display of the eight gates of being's spontaneity and is therefore called the great simulta­neous display of cyclic life and perfect peace. When inner clar­ity manifests as outer clarity [the display of cyclic life and per­fect peace], the unceasing space of [this display's] nature is in-"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"210 Myriad Wo rlds nate clarity; the manifestation of its character is the five lights, the primordial radiance; and the manifestation of its energy is the natural quality of openness, like a cloudless sky. The eight gates of manifestation are as explained in the Ta ntra of Great Beauty and Auspiciousness11: Unceasing space is [the gate through which the ground of being] manifests as energy. Unceasing appearance is [the ground] manifesting as lights. Unceasing enjoyment is [the ground] manifesting as pris­tine wisdom.12 Unceasing nature is [the ground] manifesting as dimensions of awakening. Unceasing view is [the ground] manifesting as non-duality. Unceasing method is [the ground] manifesting as freedom from limitations. The purity of pristine wisdom is the gate to perfection. Unceasing energy is [the gate] to impure [cyclic life]. These [eight] are precious wish-fulfilling jewels. 13 To elaborate, [the realms] of the enjoyment dimension of awak­ening appear from the creative dynamics of the nature [of the ground]. The natural realms of the manifest dimension of awak­ening appear from the creative dynamics of capabilities [that are the character of the ground]. The gate of cyclic life appears as a dream-like personal perception from the creativity of en­ergy. Although the manifestations of the ground unfold in these ways, deception and freedom from deception have no reality with respect to the nature of the ground's manifestations. The gates of the ground's spontaneity are inherent to the manifes­tation of the ground: this is the factor that permits the percep­tion of pure realms and impure deceptive appearances. [The ground's manifestation] is the basis for freedom, while primordial purity is the place of freedom: this is a key distinc­tion. In other words, if the nature of the manifestation of the ground is recognized, the manifestation serves as the condi­tion for freedom, and is therefore considered the basis of free­dom. If it is not recognized, the manifestation serves as the con­dition for deception and is therefore considered the basis of deception. For instance, a white conch shell can serve as a condition for the mistaken [cognition of it] as a yellow [conch"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 211 shell]. [The ground's manifestation] is not actually deception, but it is regarded as such14 when it serves as the condition for deception. Liberation as the [primordial buddha] occurs in the follow­ing way: The instant the ground's manifestations arise, one does not apprehend them as something else but rather recognizes them as one's own inner radiance. Consequently, the move­ment [of constructive thoughts] ceases in itself: at the first in­stant [of movement], the recognition that the manifestations are inner radiance causes realization to dawn. This realization defines the difference [between liberation and deception]. Immediately thereafter, deception is dispelled and pristine wisdom unfolds. At this point, the ground fully develops into the result [i.e., awakening]. This is re-enlightenment, the real­ization of primordial enlightenment within one's own nature. When self-manifestations dissolve into primordial purity, the result is awakening within the ground of being itself before anything else manifests [from the ground]. [The personifica­tion of] this awakening is the enlightened guide known as Ever­Perfect. [II.B.3.b.ii.B'.2'] How Beings Fail to Recognize the Ground of Being This section has two parts: (1) a general presentation of the aris­ing of deception, and (2) a detailed account of the formation of the body. [II.B.3.b.ii.B'.2'.a'] General Presentation of the Arising of Deception Three causes and four conditions [produce deception): when the six cognitions arise, The nature of the ground's manifestations is not realized; factors in groups of five [arise) Based on subject and object. Through the course of the twelve links of interdependent origination, [the wheel) turns. How does deception arise? [To give a brief overview,] due to the cause (the three unawarenesses) and the four condi­tions (the impure objective referent), consciousness mistakes"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"212 Myriad Worlds the appearances [of the ground] through [dualistic] apprehen­sions of subject and object. When this occurs, the uninhibited functioning of the six [types of] grasping cognition causes the six emotions15 to appear as dormant instincts which constrain intrinsic awareness. At this point, one becomes deceived with respect to the appearances of the six objects16 by not recogniz­ing that such appearances are of the nature [of intrinsic aware­ness of pristine wisdom], i.e., the basis for their manifestation. As instincts intensify, various factors, such as the aggregates, sense objects, and so forth (each in groups of five), arise through [the dualistic apprehensions of] subject and object. The twelve links of interdependent origination unfold in their sequence and propel the turning of the dream-like cycle of lives. To explain in detail, when [appearances] manifest from the ground, the creative dynamic of energy manifests naturally as cognition, which is the clarity and intrinsic awareness capable of analyzing objects. Through non-recognition of the nature [of appearances], three aspects of unawareness manifest in conjunction with appearances. The unawareness identical in nature [with intrinsic awareness], 17 the cause [for deception], is a failure to recognize that cognition is itself [intrinsic aware­ness]. Co-emergent unawareness is the simultaneous arising of cognition and a failure to recognize its actual nature. Con­ceptual unawareness is the apprehension of self-manifestations as something \"other.\" Further, four conditions contribute to deception: the causal condition is non-recognition of the manifestation of the ground as having arisen from itself; the objective condition is the mani­festation [of the ground] as [outer] objects; the dominant condition is the apprehending of [objects] as \"I\" or \"property\"; and the immediate condition is the concomitance of these three conditions. In summation, unawareness is the cause of deception, and the appearance of objects to cognition is the contributing condition. Six obscurations are produced from the nature aspect of unawarenesses. The [Tantra ofl Self-Manifestation [of Awareness]18 states:"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 213 Unawareness that is mind, as the root of cyclic life; Unawareness that becomes absorbed in the objective field that leads to deception; Unawareness-within-its-own-ground that is the basis of deception; Unawareness of constructive thought that is the grasping subject; Unawareness pursuing a path that is its own artificial creation; Unawareness of deludedness that is non-recognition; Owing to these six forms of unawareness, the [nature of the] self-manifestation is not seen.19 Unawareness causes the arising of six grasping cognitions: (1) mind and its movements; (2) consciousness knowing itself; (3} apprehension of objects; ( 4) ascertainment of objects; (5) dis­traction by objects; and (6) coarse emotions. All these are forms of intense grasping, and together they constitute the six obscurations. These factors of deception propel beings through the course of the twelve links of interdependent origination. The inter­connection between a twelve-year [cycle] and the twelve months [of a year] externally, and the twelve emotions inter­nally, make possible the twelve experiential media.20 Thus, the successive twelve links of interdependent origination evolve from the impure [factor of unawareness] in the following way. When manifestations of the ground of being arise, the cre­ativity of intrinsic awareness produces cognition which is co­emergent with non-recognition [of its own nature as the ground's manifestation]: this is \"unawareness.\" The ensuing deceptions or \"formative actions\" lead to exploration of the object's basic appearance, which is \" consciousness.\" Conscious­ness instigates the differentiations of objects by designations such as \"this is an object,\" \"this is an appearance,\" and so on. The nature of the object of designation is apprehended as \"form.\" This constitutes the primary deception of existence: \"name and form.\" Name and form give rise to the six senses, allowing cognitions to arise and develop in relation to the six types of objects. This leads to apprehension of objects, which is \"contact\" [between object, senses, and consciousness]. Contact leads to the experiences of attraction, aversion, or indifference,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"214 Myriad Wo rlds which is \"feeling.\" This evolves into attachment to objects, which is \"craving.\" Subsequently \"grasping\" arises, involving the grasper with the related act of grasping an object. The un­folding of unpredictable experiences related to various decep­tive appearances is \"becoming.\" As a result, one is born in the formless, form, or desire realms, which is \"birth.\" The cycle continues through old age and sickness until death [i.e., the links of \"aging\" and \"death\"]. This progression repeats itself again and again. This is how the sequence of the twelve links of interdependent origination that causes cyclic life first arises from the manifestation of the ground. [From one life to another,] one wanders through the various existences of cyclic life, following the successive links of inter­dependent origination. When the [manifestation of] reality21 has passed [and before the intermediate state of existence arises], unawareness of the nature of [intrinsic awareness] generates formative actions for the next life. Consciousness seeks an ern­bodied existence; after it enters a womb, name and form are developed through the phases of fetal development. The six senses develop, and the convergence of contributing factors [i.e., object, sense, and consciousness] creates contact. Then the feel­ing of pleasure or pain [is experienced], leading to craving for the experience [of feeling]. Grasping related to objects and the act of grasping are followed by intense grasping, [i.e., the en­trance into a new life], which is \"becoming.\" One is born from the womb and gradually experiences the transformations from youth to old age and finally death. All these links arise in de­pendence upon one another. During the experience of cyclic life, the five objects (such as form) arise as a result of not recognizing the five lights as a. self-rnanifestion and of apprehending these lights as [outer] objects. The five emotions arise because the nature of the five pristine wisdoms is not recognized. The five [aggregates] (such as body, mind, etc.), which are composite collections, arise from impurity [i.e., non-recognition] of the natural radiance of the reality [of the ground]. The five [mental phenomena] (such as the ever-searching mental cognition) arise from impurity [non-recognition] of the five energy-winds. The five concep-"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 215 tions of self (thought and memory conceived as the self; a multiplicity of objects conceived as the self; various currents of thoughts conceived as the self; the basic aspect of consciousness conceived as the self; and phenomena and discrimination of phenomena conceived as the self) arise be­cause the movements [of constructive thoughts] do not cease in themselves. In summation, the impure phenomena of cyclic life arise within ongoing intrinsic awareness, abide within intrinsic awareness, and are simply the play of intrinsic awareness. They have never existed outside intrinsic awareness, just as dreams never occur except in sleep. The various descriptions of cyclic life teach that [phenomena] are in fact empty forms, simply the magical play of vivid appearances that do not exist in reality. [ll.B.3.b.ii.B'.2'.b'] The Formation of the Body This section has four parts: (1) a general presentation of the formation of the body in each of three realms; (2) the develop­ment of the body in the womb; (3) the relationship between superficial and ultimate [elements]; (4) and a statement con­cerning the presence of pervasive elements. [II.B.3.b.ii.B' .2' .b' .i'] The Formation of the Body in Each of the Three Realms Object, body, and mind arise from the three bases of deception. Mental, radiant, and material bodies develop in the three realms. The cause of deception is co-emergent unawareness, the fail­ure to recognize that what arises from the ground of being is the self-manifestation [of intrinsic awareness] itself. The condi­tion contributing [to deception] is unawareness of the imagi­naries, apprehending as \"other\" [the appearances] that are [in­trinsic awareness] manifesting to itself. The basis for deception is the manifestation of clear light, [which is also a] self-manifestation. In other words, three forms of deception­in relation to objects, body, and mind-arise due to [this cause,"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"216 Myriad Worlds condition, and basis]. Since the nature [of the ground} is empty, it provides space, and thus reality becomes the basis for objec­tive deception. The character of the ground-[ clarity, manifest­ing as} the five lights-becomes the basis for deception with respect to the objective manifestations of the material body and external environment. Intrinsic awareness, creativity, and effulgence of energy are the bases for deception with respect to the mind. The initial stage of deception within the three realms is the development of beings in the formless realm. Their mental bod­ies of contemplation, constituted of the four aggregates that are mere names,ll serve as support for their mental continuums. Next appear beings of the form realm, for whom bodies of the radiant five lights serve as support for their mental continuums. Finally, beings of the desire realm appear, for whom material bodies of flesh and blood serve as support for their mental continuums. [II.B.3.b.ii.B' .2' .b' .ii'J The Development of the Body in the Wo mb Womb-birth: from the penetrating, scattering, and equalizing [properties of the] elements, The channels, syllables, energy-winds, and vital essences [form], and both the superficial and ultimate elements develop. For a being taking birth in a womb, the development of the adamantine body occurs as follows. The emotions cause the production of the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. These elements perform the function of developing the body: through their three functions of penetrating, scattering, and equalizing, these four elements gather, distribute, and mix. Initially, during the first week of embryonic development, the subtle channels of the four elements along with four seed-syllables form in the four directions. Subsequently, in the second and following weeks, the two pairs of small eyes-the physical eyes and the \"eyes of the lamp\"-form at the navel channel knot. The finest essences of flesh, blood, heat, and breath form in the four heart channels and reveal the sense-"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 217 bases of the eight consciousnesses. The four channel wheels form gradually, each one having two eyes. On the three main channels which support the five sense faculties rest three seed-syllables which serve as supports for the three doors [body, speech, and mind] and the three poisons in the impure state, and as supports for the three dimensions of awakening in the pure state. On the five channel wheels rest the five seed syl­lables23 of the heroes.24 Four hundred and seventy-two subtle channels branch out from these [five channel wheels]. Then the main and secondary energy-winds, such as the three sets (outer, inner, and secret) of five energy-winds, form. [These energy­winds] are either the energy-winds of pristine wisdom or energy-winds of evolutionary actions. The superficial vital es­sence rests within the right channel; the ultimate vital essence rests within the left; and the natural vital essence rests within the central channel. Thus, the complete body forms through the developing process of the four ultimate and four superfi­cial elements. [II.B.3.b.ii.B'.2'.b'.iii'] The Relationship Between Superficial and Ultimate Elements Through dependence on the former, the aggregates and so forth develop. The latter serve as the cause of the four lamps which reveal the four visions. [In the root verses above,] \"former\" refers to the four superfi­cial elements which serve as the support for the development of the five aggregates. \"And so forth\" refers to pristine wis­dom, since the elements act as the support for pristine wisdom. The development and formation of the aggregates is explained in the following way: The aggregate of form develops on the basis of flesh; discernment develops on the basis of blood; con­sciousness develops on the basis of heat; mental formations develop on the basis of inhalation; and feeling develops on the basis of exhalation. Flesh is the basis from which the channels are produced. The channels are the basis from which energy-winds are produced. Energy-winds produce the energy-winds of both evolutionary"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"218 Myriad Worlds actions and pristine wisdom. The energy-winds of evolution­ary actions permeate cyclic life while [the energy-winds of] pristine wisdom permeate perfect peace. Furthermore, blood leads to the production of lymph, which in tum produces the vital essences, which produce the five sense faculties, which themselves are the products of superficial ele­ments. The causes of the five sense faculties are the five emo­tions, while myriad past, present, and future constructive thoughts cause both cyclic life and perfect peace. This completes the account of the development of the four superficial elements. \"The latter\" refers to the four ultimate elements. These are based on the superficial elements and serve as the cause of the four lamps,25 through which the pristine wisdoms of the four visions26 manifest and are perceived. When the color white reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the \"water-lamp of the far-sighted [eyes],\" which arises from the water energy-wind channel. When red reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the \"lamp of emptiness which is the sphere,\" which arises from the fire channel. When yellow reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the \"lamp of the pure sphere [of intrinsic awareness],\" which arises from the earth channel. When green reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the \"lamp of self-existing wisdom,\" which arises from the path of the wind channel. [The lamp of] self-existing wisdom produces intrinsic aware­ness. The [water-lamp of the] far-sighted [eyes] generates light; the [lamp of emptiness which is the] sphere produces the di­mensions of awakening; [the lamp of the pure] sphere [of in­trinsic awareness] produces pristine wisdoms. The water-lamp of the far-sighted [eyes] leads to the [vision of the] direct per­ception of reality. The lamp of emptiness which is the sphere leads to the vision of increasing contemplative experience. The lamp of the pure sphere [of intrinsic awareness] leads to the vision of reaching the limit of intrinsic awareness. The lamp of self-existing wisdom leads to the vision of the cessation [of phenomenal] reality. The superficial channels, vital essence, and energy-winds of evolutionary actions result in evolutionary actions, in emotions,"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 219 and in the increase and decrease of the four elements. The ulti­mate channels, vital essences, and the energy-winds of pristine wisdom cause the development of pristine wisdom (the cause}, of the lights and colors (the conditions}, and of the dimensions of awakening and pristine wisdoms (the result). (II.B.3.b.ii.B'.2'.b'.iv'] The Presence of Pervasive Elements Twenty-five elements generate the effulgence and creativity of pristine wisdom. The twenty-five elements that pervade the body (five sets of five) are all naturally complete in the body and generate the effulgence and creativity of pristine wisdom, etc. As the Self-Manifestation [of Awareness27] states: Five major elements are all present in one's body: Five kinds of energy-winds create the radiance of pristine wisdom. Five kinds of fire generate the creativity of pristine wisdom. Five kinds of earth create the nature of pristine wisdom. Five kinds of water create the object of pristine wisdom. Five kinds of space provide the abode of pristine wisdom. This tantra provides an extensive explanation of these points. The five earths are present [within the body] in this way: Ever-illuminating earth co-exists with intrinsic awareness; im­mutable and impenetrable earth co-exists with the lamps; pre­cious earth, the source of everything, co-exists with the spheres; ever-limitless earth which displays appearances co-exists with both the sphere of reality and pristine wisdom. The earth of ultimate accomplishment co-exists with wisdom. The five waters are present in this way: changeless water is present in all channels; the water of clear, pure tranquillity is present in every bone; water that increases qualities is pre­sent in the blood; water of non-attachment is present in the lymph; and water of perfect non-apprehension is present within the eyes. The five fires are present in this way: the fire that pervades everything, internally and externally, is present in the lungs; the fire that illuminates everything, internally and externally,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"220 Myriad Worlds is present in the two eyes and the limbs; the fire that is uniform throughout everything is present between the skin and flesh; the fire that conceives of external and internal activities is present in the soles of the two feet; and fire that accomplishes external and internal activities is present in the palms of the two hands. The five energy-winds are present in this way: life-sustaining energy-wind is present in the life channel; the energy-wind that produces luster and radiance is present between the eyebrows; the energy-wind that co-exists with fire is present in the abdo­men; the energy-wind that pervades everything is present throughout the entire body; and the compassionless energy­wind of the evolutionary action of the eon is present between the heart and the heart membrane. The five spaces are present in this way: all-pervading space is present, inseparable from actual intrinsic awareness; object­less, clear and pure space is present, inseparable from the five lights; unmixed pure space is present, inseparable from the pure sphere of reality; space that is symbolic of ultimate [reality, mind itself], is present, inseparable from pristine wisdom [expressed] as signs-the empty spheres; and liberative space of the pure realms is present, inseparable from all the manifestations of dimensions of awakening and pristine wisdoms. Although comprehensive teachings exist concerning the lo­cation and function of the five energy-winds when each of them is divided into five, these are not included here. [II.B.3.b.ii.B'.3'] Ever-Presence of the Ground in the Deceived State Buddha-nature pervades all sentient beings. Its mode of appearance and mode of manifestation are taught in six sets of five. How is buddha-nature (the ground) pervasively present in the continuum of every sentient being in the state of deception? The Vajrasattva, Mirror of the Heart Ta ntra28 says: Buddha-nature is present in all sentient beings throughout the universe, just as oil pervades sesame seeds. The Cluster of Jewels [Tantra)29 states:"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 221 Oil is always naturally present In mustard and sesame seeds. Likewise, buddha-nature And its respective luminosity manifest In every sentient being who takes physical form. Beyond the Limits of Sound Root Ta ntra30 says: The pristine wisdom of intrinsic awareness is present in the body Like oil is present in the sesame seed. The luster and radiance of the body Are pervaded by the moisture of pristine wisdom. The Self-Manifestation [of Awareness] Ta ntra31 says: Authentic buddha-mind is present In the continuum of every sentient being As dimensions of awakening and pristine wisdoms. These and other similar references accord with the discourses and tantras of the common [systems] that teach the definitive truth. On this subject, Longchen Rabjam, [who is] Ever-Perfect [in­carnate], using logical reasoning and scriptural references, re­futes the viewpoints that buddha-nature [does not] possess the powers [of a buddha] and major and minor marks and signs [of awakening], and [refutes the viewpoints] that the scriptures that expound buddha-nature require interpretation. Longchenpa gave [three] reasons why one should appreciate [the teaching on buddha-nature]: (1) If buddha-nature is not revealed by a spiritual friend, it cannot be recognized. Because it is discovered through reliance on an authentic master, one should appreciate [the teaching on buddha-nature]. (2) [Bud­dha-nature] is a difficult topic to understand, even for the bodhisattvas dwelling on the stages of awakening, not to men­tion egocentric people. Because it is an impenetrable secret known by enlightened beings only, one should appreciate [the teaching on the buddha-nature].

Longchengpa taught this profound and secret subject"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"222 Myriad Wo rlds [of buddha-nature] comprehensively. One should study his outstanding works in order to fully understand it. This [completes] the general explanation on the ever-presence of the ground of being. The special features [of the ground of being] will now be ex­plained in detail. The modes of manifestation and appearance of the ground are taught in six sets of five: Primordially present in the pristine wisdom of the buddha-nature are five dimen­sions of awakening, five energy-winds of pristine wisdom awarenesses, five lights, five qualities of the [buddha] families, five pristine wisdom energy-winds, and five qualities of na­ture, character, and energy. Their primordial presence is indi­cated by impure manifestations: five emotions, five aggregates, five elements, five senses, five sense objects, and five natural qualities of the three doors. The Garland of Pearls32 states: Five bodies, five pristine wisdoms, Five luminosities and their five colors, Five qualities, five energy-winds of pristine wisdom, Five natures, five characters, And five energies present in the [buddha-] nature Pervade all [beings]. To elaborate on this, the pristine wisdoms of intrinsic aware­ness present from the beginning as the five dimensions of awak­ening now manifest as the five aggregates.33 The nature of in­trinsic awareness and the sphere of reality manifesting as a spontaneous form is Buddha Illuminator (Vairocana). The un­changing [nature of intrinsic awareness] is Buddha Imperturb­able (Ak!?obhya). The treasury of precious qualities [of intrin­sic awareness] is Buddha Source of Jewels (Ratnasaqiliava). The boundless light [of intrinsic awareness] is Buddha Measure­less Light (Amitabha). Being primordial enlightenment, [the nature of intrinsic awareness] is Buddha Unfailing Accomplish­ment (Amoghasiddhi). Likewise, the five pristine wisdoms are present from the be­ginning and now arise as the five emotions. 34 The dimensions of awakening, realms, and other phenomena naturally mani­festing in the state of intrinsic awareness is mirror-like pristine wisdom. The equality of everything within intrinsic awareness is the pristine wisdom of equality. The distinct manifestations"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The Primordial Purity of the Universe 223 of the [dimensions of awakening and realms] is pristine wis­dom of discernment. The [dimensions of awakening and the realms] being spontaneously present from the beginning is the pristine wisdom of accomplishing aims. That all are of a single flavor within reality is the pristine wisdom of the sphere of reality. From the five lights arise five elements.35 Intrinsic awareness being stainless is [present as] white light; intrinsic awareness being complete in all qualities is [present as] yellow light; in­trinsic awareness being the union [of all qualities] is [present as] red light; intrinsic awareness being complete in everything without effort is [present as] green light; and intrinsic aware­ness being unchangeable is [present as] blue light. These [lights] in their pure aspect are the five consorts. Five buddha families appear as the five sense faculties (which indicate their presence}.36 Pristine wisdom is inconceivably re­alized within the nature of the sphere of transcendent reality, and thus becomes indivisible from the sphere of reality. The inseparability of these two is the transcendent family. [Intrin­sic awareness] being unchanging is the adamantine family. Its completeness in qualities is the jewel family. Its being unstained by evolutionary actions and emotions is the lotus family. Its being complete in the enlightened activity or magical play of intrinsic awareness is the action family. Five energy-winds are related to the five sense objects. [In­trinsic awareness] reaching the warmth of pristine wisdom is the energy-wind that co-exists with fire. [Intrinsic awareness] serving as the basis for the arising of cyclic life [when its nature is not understood] and for perfect peace [when its nature is understood] is the life-sustaining energy-wind. [Intrinsic aware­ness] distinguishing various appearances is the energy-wind that separates the refined essence from the unrefined. [Intrin­sic awareness] pervading everything, from cyclic life to perfect peace, is the pervasive energy-wind. At the time of actualizing intrinsic awareness, [intrinsic awareness] causing cyclic life to become the basis for freedom in the state of perfect peace is the energy-wind of evolutionary action devoid of compassion. These winds are not those related to the movements [of intrin­sic awareness], but are designated [as energy-winds] with re-"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"224 Myriad Wo rlds spect to the aspect [of intrinsic awareness] and are therefore winds of the intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom. Five qualities or five insights [are primordially present] and manifest as the groups of five natural qualities of the three gates. [Intrinsic awareness] discriminating the basis of the arising of cyclic life from the basis of the arising of perfect peace is \"dis­criminating insight.\" [Intrinsic awareness] being one in ongo­ing awareness is \"comprehensive insight.\" [Intrinsic aware­ness] not departing from intrinsic awareness is \"pervading in­sight.\" [Intrinsic awareness'] presence at the time of actualiz­ing intrinsic awareness is \"presiding insight.\" As an alterna­tive [to the latter], [intrinsic awareness that] cuts the life of both cyclic life and perfect peace is the \"liberative insight.\" Since these insights are none other than intrinsic awareness, they are called self-existing pristine wisdom, because they are not forms of analytical discernment, but pertain instead to intrinsic aware­ness of pristine wisdom. If these [six sets of elements] were not present in intrinsic awareness itself, which is the ground of being, they would not be present in the directly observable body and mind. If they were not present in these [body and mind], they would not be present as external objects appearing to the mind. If they were not present in intrinsic awareness, they would be like the re­flection in a mirror of the face of a barren woman's son: his face cannot appear because the son has no face, and he has no face because he does not exist. What manifests as a phenomenon arises due to its presence in the body and mind, which [in turn] arises from being present in intrinsic awareness. This is com­parable to Devadatta's having a head, therefore having a face which can appear in a mirror. Concerning this, the Majestic Cre­ative Energy of the Universe37 states: How things appear is my38 being; How things arise is my reality; There is no phenomenon that is not me In the whole universe. From the Cluster of Jewels Ta ntra39: All manifestations appear Just like a face in a mirror."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"[II.B.3.b.ii.B'.4'] The Primordial Purity of the Universe 225 Supplementary Explanation of the Abode of Pristine Wisdom and the Ending of the Deception of [Apprehended] Objects Intrinsic awareness is present in the center of the heart, based on the three palaces. The excellent vital essences abide in the four entrances of clear light. The two eyes are the doors for the manifestation of external clarity; [Depending on] objects and fulfilling crucial means, deception is ceased, And one effortlessly attains the original place of freedom. Buddha-mind (i.e., intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom) is present mingling with the deceptive manifestation of the ma­terial body. The blessing of this presence-the pristine wisdom manifestation-arises in the following way: its actual dwelling place is the center of the glorious knot (Srivatsa) in the heart jewel; its effulgences are present in the blazing palace of the conch-shell (Bhenza), in the palace of the eyes that see, and in the palace of the channels that cause movement. Beyond the Lim­its of Sound Ta ntra40 states: In the palace of the jewel of the heart Is a composite jewel of eight facets, the entrances; Five pristine wisdoms and five dimensions of awakening, Five energy-winds and five channels of consciousness: Everything has a fivefold character. Further: Inside the head, heart, and channels, The reality of unfabricated purity is present. Beyond the Limits of Sound Ta ntra and other scriptures explain this subject in detail. The nature of intrinsic awareness is present as dimensions of awakening, like a statue in a vase. The character of intrinsic awareness is present as light, like a flame inside a vase. The energy of intrinsic awareness is present as light, like the rays of the sun. Four entrances which become four channels branch out from the clear light of the heart.

The white silk thread channel serves as the basis for apprehending external objects. The finely coiled channel serves as the basis for the self-arising [of intrinsic awareness]. The crys­tal tubular channel serves as the basis for the self-manifestation [of intrinsic awareness]. The emptiness channel of intrinsic free­dom, which inserts itself into the heaven gate at the crown of the head, serves as the basis for the dimensions of the chains [of light].41 Together, these five inner channels are the luminosities of the five pristine wisdoms. Since they naturally serve as bases, they reveal and increase the four lamps. The spheres of clear light move through the four channels of light, and based on that, clear light is cultivated: in the excellent fundamental sphere of the great golden crystal channel, the embodiment of the three aspects (nature, character, and energy) is present and supported by the heart. In the excellent path vital sphere of the white silk thread channel, the four lamps, [principally] the water-lamp, is present in the right [side of the body]. In the peak sphere of excellence of the finely coiled channel, the various visions of increasing contemplative experience are present in the left side. In the crystal tubular channel, the basis for the vision of reach­ing the limit [of awareness] is present as the basis for manifes­tation of inner clarity. In the empty intrinsic-freedom channel, the dimensions of the indestructible chains of light are present. The doors through which the visions of pristine wisdom per­vade outwardly are the two eyes. In other words, from the right eye, both the lamp of the far-sighted [eyes] and the lamp of self-existing pristine wisdom manifest as the character of the visions; this is the pristine wisdom-means that understands the phenomenal [view]. From the left eye, both the lamp of emp­tiness which is the sphere and the lamp of the pure sphere [of awareness] manifest as the character of emptiness; this is the insight of pristine wisdom that understands the noumenal [view].

Ma-bu dgra-grogs, the two cycles of five elemental energies or movements that regulate transformations in the outer world, climate, etc., and in human physiology. Each elemental energy is associated with the element that most closely represents its function and nature, and takes its name from this ele­ment: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. The creative cycle is one of generation, like the relation between a mother and son: water generates wood, wood creates fire, fire develops earth, earth yields metal, and metal dissolves to become water. The control cycle is one of subjugation: wood is suppressed by metal, fire extinguished by water, earth penetrated by wood, metal melted by fire, and water obstructed by earth. These relationships are used in astrological calculations to prognosticate and advise people regarding both the present and the future. 10. Mirror of Poetry (Skt. Kavyadarsa; Tib. sNyan-ngag me-long), by Dar:u;l.in (Dg.T. Toh. 4301).

Kama (bka' -rna) is the collection of canonical teachings. Terma (gter-ma) refers to treasure teachings, i.e., the texts, relics, and the transmissions of teach­ings concealed by Guru Padmasambhava and his consort Yeshe Tsogyel (Ye­shes mTsho-rgyal). 14.

He wrote numerous works on history as well as works of a tantric nature, such as manuals on the Kalacakra Tantra. He translated or revised about ninety of the works contained in the Tibetan cornrnentarial canon (bsTan-'gyur). He also was instrumental in transmit­ting numerous tantric teachings and lineages. Taranatha died in Mongolia, where he had been asked to visit. Although the Jonang school was suppressed after Taranatha's death by the government of the fifth Dalai Lama, his influ­ence remains strong in every area of Tibetan Buddhism. 20. Orgyen Terdag Lingpa (0-rgyan gTer-bdag Gling-pa) (1617-1682) was both disciple and teacher of the fifth Dalai Lama. His work was essential to the transmissions of the Nyingrna tradition.

Atisa was an Indian saint who in 1042 carne to Tibet at the invitation of Lhalarna Yeshe 6 (lHa-bla-rna Ye-shes-' od) and by the order ofTara, his tute­lary deity. When Nagtso the Translator invited the saint to Tibet, the abbot of Vikrarnasila made him promise to lead Atisa back after three years. When three years later they were approaching Nepal, however, they heard that the road was blocked, so Drornton ('Brorn-ston), who would be Atisa's succes­sor, asked the master to visit central Tibet. Atisa did so, greatly benefiting Tibetan Buddhism. He did not return to India, and he died at Nyetang (sNye­thang) in 1054."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"258 Myriad Worlds 26.

Longchenpa (Klong-chen-pa) (1308-1363) was the most important master in the Dzog-chen system after Guru Padrnasambhava. A great adept, philoso­pher, and writer, he became the systematizer of the Dzog-chen system. He was the author of 263 works, the most important being the Seven Treasures. 50. Earth Treasures (sa-gter) are rediscovered teachings that are usually in the form of scrolls. They are called \"Earth\" Treasures because the symbolic script of these scrolls is the tool that awakens the recollection of the teaching in the mind of the treasure discoverer. Mind Treasures (dgongs-gter) are those that emerge in the conscious mind of the discoverers, who are realized dis­ciples of Guru Padmasambhava or others. 51. Nyangrel Nyime Ozer (Nyang-ral Nyi-ma'i 'Od-zer) (1124-1192) was, along with Guru Chi:ikyi Wangchug (Guru Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug) (1212-1270), the first tertOn to appear in Tibet. These two are known as the sun and the moon, and the treasures that they discovered are known as Upper and Lower Treasures (gter-khagong-'og). 52. Rigdzin God em (Rig-' dzin rGod-ldem) (1337 -1409), the third of the great treasure discoverers. The terma he discovered and later edited are known as the Northern Treasures (byang-gter). 53. Pure Vision (dag-snang) teachings are transmitted from the state of real­ization of Guru Rinpoche and concealed in the nature of the mind of a real­ized disciple, and later awakened in his or her pure vision."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"260 Myriad Worlds 54.

Gentle Splendor (Maftjusri, 'Jam-dpal): Depicted as a sixteen-year-old youth (Kumara) to represent purity and unobstructed intellect, in the Uni­versal Way he is a tenth-stage bodhisattva identified with transcendent wis­dom, while in the tantras he is a buddha who awakened countless ages ago. Often he is seen to be the triad of son, father, and mother of the Victorious Ones. It is customary for a Buddhist author to begin a work of this genre with words of reverence to Maftjusri. 2. Highest doctrine (sad-dharma, dam pa'i chos): the doctrine of the Buddha. The Sanskrit word dharma is derived from the verbal root dhr meaning \"to hold\"- the Buddha's doctrine being \"a bearer of true and incontrovertible meaning.\" The doctrine is \"highest\" (sat) because it is the teaching of the \"Highest One\" (the Buddha). As alternative interpretations, sat denotes \"supreme\" (among all other doctrines), or denotes the virtuous (high) persons for whom the doctrine is intended. (Bu-ston' s The jewelry of Scripture, trans. E. Obermiller, p. 21). 3. Rigs brgya khyab bdag: an appellation of Vajradhara (rDo-rje 'chang). \"Fami­lies\" refers to families of buddhas. 4. jina, rGyal ba: an appellation of the Buddha. 5. Threefold greatness (chen po gsum): greatness in compassion, greatness in realization, and greatness in relinquishment. 6. Padmakara, (Lotus-Born, Pad-rna 'Byung-gnas). 7. Two understandings (mkhyen gnyis): the understandings of the noumenal (ji Ita ba) and of the phenomenal (ji snyed pa). 8. A reference to the verses of The Encompassment of All Knowledge. 9. The victorious ones and their heirs (jina-putra, rgyal ba sras bcas): the buddhas and bodhisattvas."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 36-81 261 10. The two objectives (dongnyis) are to benefit oneself (rang don) and to ben­efit others (gzhan don). The first is realized through the attainment of the re­ality dimension of awakening, i.e., the omniscient mind of a buddha. The second is realized through the attainment of the enjoyment dimension of awakening and the manifest dimension of awakening. Introduction 1. The four canonical languages: Sanskrit (sarrskrt, legs sbyar), Prakrit (rang bzhin), Apabhra111sa (zur chag), and Pisaci (sha za). 2. The three trainings (trisik�a, bslab pa gsum): the training relating to ethics, to meditation, and to wisdom. 3. At this point in the text Kongtrul writes, \"The three sixth case particles do not appear here because the Sanskrit is condensed.\" This refers to \"yana,\" \"ratna,\" and \"sudesika\" in the Sanskrit title, which are not declined. In the Tibetan title, the equivalent words end in sixth case or \"connecting\" par­ticles, i.e., \"theg pa'i,\" \"rin po che'i,\" and \"legs par ston pa'i.\" 4. The three systems or spiritual ways (triyana, theg pa gsum) found within the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition: the Individual Way, the Universal Way, and the Way of Indestructible Reality or Secret Mantra. The nine systems or spiritual ways (theg pa dgu) refers to a classification of the teachings of the above three systems particular to the Tibetan Nyingma (ancient) tradition: the Individual Way is divided into two paths-that of the proclaimers and the solitary sages; the Universal Way (also called the Bodhisattva Way) constitutes a single path; the Way of Indestructible Reality is divided into the six paths of Kriyayoga, Caryayoga, Yoga, Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga. 5. Treatise (sastra, bstan bcos). The Sanskrit word sastra is derived from sasti, \"to rule over, overcome,\" and trayate, \"to save or protect oneself.\" This ety­mology is found in the sentence, \"It has the qualities ... miserable forms of life.\" 6. Asanga's Yogacaryabhumi enumerates nine kinds of treatises, six flawed and three valid. The six flawed treatises are the following: senseless, mis­taken, overemphasizing learning, emphasizing sophists' debates, mislead­ing, and encouraging cruelty. The three valid treatises are meaningful, con­ducive to the realization of awakening, and conducive to the elimination of all sufferings of cyclic life. 7. The three kinds of wisdom (shes rab gsum): the wisdoms resulting from study, reflection, and meditation. 8. Vikramasila Monastery (rNam gnon ngang tshul): founded by King Dharmapala (770-810), it was an ancient monastic university second only to Nalanda. Although its actual site remains uncertain, it probably lay somwhere near what is now the border between Bengal and Bihar."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"262 Myriad Worlds 9. The path of the perfections {piiramitiimiirga, pha rol (tu) phyin pa'i lam): the path of the bodhisattva in which six perfections are cultivated-generosity, ethics, patience, effort, meditation, and wisdom-with the addition of the perfections of skill in means, vow, power, and pristine wisdom. 10. Secret Mantra (guhya-mantra, gsang sngags) or Way of Indestructible Real­ity (vajrayiina, rdo rje theg pa): both terms refer to the Buddhist \"Way of Trans­formation,\" also known as tantra. 11. dPalldan (srimarrr): lit. \"glory-possessing.\" 12. Great King of Ta ntras of the Sacred Primordial Buddha, the Glorious Wheel of Time: Dg.K. rGyud' bum, vol. Ka, f. 113a1-2 (Toh. 362). 13. The three disciplines (trisarrrvara, sdom pa gsum): the vows accepted as the bases of training in the three spiritual ways-the Individual, Universal, and Indestructible Reality Way. 14. Contemplation (samiidhi, ting nge 'dzin): a total mental equanimity in a state of concentration. When ting nge 'dzin indicates mind-training in general (as in the three trainings, the six perfections, etc.), it will be translated as \"meditation.\" 15. Two kinds of selflessness (dvinairiitmya, bdag med gnyis): non-self of a per­son (pudgalanairiitmya, gang zag gi bdag med) and non-self of an object (dharmanairi:itmya, chos kyi bdag med). 16. The sage who developed the philosophical system of the Saqtkhya school. 17. Perfect peace without remainder (niravase�a nirvii!la, lhag med myang 'das). Four types of perfect peace are generally presented in the Buddhist scrip­tures: perfect peace without remainder; perfect peace with remainder (*si:i:Sesiinirvii!la, lhag bcas myang 'das); dynamic perfect peace (aprati�thita nirvii!la, mi gnas pa'i myang 'das); and natural perfect peace (pralq-ti nirvii!la, rang bzhin gyi myang 'das). Perfect peace with and without remainder are explained in different ways depending on the philosophical approach. In the Individualists' philosophies, the former is the perfect peace in the mind of a saintly one (arhat) who is still endowed with his body (i.e., the remainder). The latter is the perfect peace in the mind of a saintly one who has passed away, relinquishing his body, and is thus without the remainder of the body. In the higher Universalists' phi­losophies, \"remainder\" denotes the constructive thought of intrinsic exist­ence: when a bodhisattva becomes free of that constructive thought, he or she is said to have attained perfect peace without xemainder. This is con­firmed in Nagarjuna's Jewel Garland (Ratniivali): \"The disappearance of all constructive thoughts of existence and non-existence .... \" Dynamic perfect peace is that of a Buddha, so-called because it is not bound either by the limitation of cyclic life or by the limitation of the inactivity of peace. Natural perfect peace refers to emptiness. Because all phenomena are free of true existence, their nature is said to be natural perfect peace. As Santideva' s Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life states: \"Beings are by nature in perfect peace.\""},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 82-88 263 18. The four pristine wisdoms (catvarijfilina, ye shes bzhi): the mirror-like pris­tine wisdom (adarsajiiana, me long Ita bu'i ye shes}, the pristine wisdom of dis­cernment (pratyavekfa�Jajfiana, so sor rtog pa'i ye shes}, the pristine wisdom of equality (samatajfiana, mnyam nyid kyi ye shes}, the pristine wisdom of accom­plishing aims (krtyanuffhanajfiana, bya ba grub pa'i ye shes). 19. Age of conflict (kaliyuga, rtsod /dan gyi dus): the present world-age, the last and most degenerate of the ages mentioned in classical Indian cosmology. 20. The proclaimers (sravaka, nyan thos), along with the solitary sages (pratyekabuddha, rang sangs rgyas}, are adherents of the Individual Way. Proclairners are so called because they listen to (nyan) the doctrine, practice it, and then cause others to hear (thos par byed pa}, in this case not what they have heard but what they have achieved. Alternatively, proclaimers are so called because upon hearing (thos) about buddhahood or its path, they pro­claim (sgrogs) it to others without practicing it themselves. 21. This reverence presents the three trainings in the traditional order of the proclaimers: ethics, meditation, and wisdom. 22. The commentary, The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, presents the three trainings in the order of the Buddha's Way (Universal Way): ethics, wisdom, and meditation. 23. The three ways to develop the mind of awakening: to resolve to lead all beings to enlightenment (the king-like mind of awakening); to resolve to ac­company beings to enlightenment (ferryman-like); and to resolve to follow beings to enlightenment (shepherd-like). 24. See note 9 above. 25. Bodhisattva (awakening being, byang chub sems dpa'): one who has devel­oped the authentic wish to attain enlightenment for the sake of all beings. 26. The faults of attachment (chags) and impediment (thogs): the obscurations of emotions (klesavara�Ja, nyon sgrib) and of knowables (jfieyavara�Ja, shes sgrib). 27. Transition refers to an inconceivably subtle transition ('pho ba) between the final point of the tenth stage of the bodhisattva and the eleventh stage, the state of a fully enlightened buddha. What hampers this transition is the most subtle of all obscurations, which is the last remaining imprint (bag chags }, itself related to the three appearances (sgang gsum: dkar lam, dmar lam, nag lam). 28. The four dimensions of awakening (kaya, sku}: the reality dimension of awakening (dharmakaya, chos sku); the enjoyment dimension of awakening (sai'J'!bhogakaya, longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku); the manifest dimension of awak­ening (nirma�Jakaya, sprul pa'i sku); and the essential dimension of awakening (svabhavakaya, ngo bo nyid kyi sku). 29. Three Jewels (triratna, dkon mchog gsum): the enlightened guide (the Bud­dha); his doctrine (the Dharma); and the followers of his doctrine (the Sangha). 30. Minor texts (gzhung lugs): works that expound minor sciences as opposed to the \"inner knowledge\" of Buddhist teaching. 31. Dg. K. Sems tsam, vol.

Unawareness (avidya, rna rig pa): in this context, ignorance of the funda­mental nature of things, i.e., emptiness. Generally, two types of unawareness are explained-unawareness with respect to immanent reality, i.e., empti­ness (de kho na. nyid la rmongs pa'i rna rig pa) (the root of cyclic life}, and un­awareness of the causal relatedness of evolutionary actions and their results (las 'bras la rmongs pa'i rna rig pa). 2.

Unsurpassed (Akani�tha, 'Og min): According to the master Ananda­garbha, this realm is called Unsurpassed because the enjoyment dimension of the Buddha Vairocana abides there as the king of the \"unsurpassed dei­ties,\" i.e., the bodhisattvas on the tenth stage of awakening. Scholars hold three different views concerning the nature of the realm Un­surpassed: (1} that it is the highest of the pure heavens, (2} that it is included within the pure heavens, but above the ordinary Unsurpassed, and the abode of only tenth-stage bodhisattvas, (3} that it is a realm not included within the pure heavens. Kongtrul states that Unsurpassed is not to be considered as any particular place, but transcends all world-systems. 9. The famous Prayer for Excellence, otherwise known as The Vows of Samantabhadra, is found at the end of the Entering the Realm of Reality (Gal_lif.avyuha) section of the Flower Ornament Scripture (Avata1Jisaka Sutra). It was spoken by Samantabhadra to the bodhisattva Sudhana. For centuries, it has served as a source of great inspiration to followers of the Universal Way. Dg.K. Phal chen, vol.

Taking eighteen inches as the equivalent of a cubit-the unit of length based on the length of the fore­arm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger-a yojana in the Wheel of Time would be nine miles, or 14.8 km, and a yojana in the phenomenology system would be 4.5 miles, or 7.4 km. 8.

The four insignia of the Buddhist teaching, i.e., the four tenets that char­acterize the Buddhist philosophy (catvari �r�tinamittamudra, Ita ba bkar btags kyi phyag rgya bzhi): all conditioned phenomena are impermanent (sarvasal!lskiiranityata, 'du byas thams cad mi rtag pa); defiled phenomena are suffering (sarvasasravadu�khata, zag bcas thams cas sdug bsngal ba); phenomena are empty and selfless (sarvadharmasunyasvamika, chos thams cad stong zhing bdag med pa); and nirvat:�a is peace (nirviiiJtlsiinta, mya ngan las 'das pa zhi ba). 24. The Sanskrit word ya�a seems to be derived from ya� which means \"to be quick, speed on\"; the Tibetan word, however, is gnod sbyin, \"bringer of harm.\" Yak�as are semi-divine beings, generally considered to be benevolent; however, they are occasionally classed among malignant spirits. According to The Treasury of Phenomenology, the secretive (guyhaka) ya�as who dwell on the top of Mount Meru prevent the playful gods and goddesses from falling off the side of the mountain. 25. Miraculous mode of birth (upapadukaja, brdzus skyes): an instantaneous mode of birth through which gods and hell beings are born. Miraculous birth, birth from a womb, from an egg, and from moisture and heat constitute the four modes of birth (catvari-yonidvara, skye sgo bzhi). 26.

Form Realm (rupadhiitu, gzugs khams): a divine state of existence where physical suffering and mental unrest are absent and where gods dwell in contemplation without experiencing the arising of emotions. 28. Brahma (Tshangs-pa): the creator of the universe in Hinduism; in Bud­dhism, rather than being a single god, Brahma refers to a type of god who has obtained an elevated status in the universe. Thus, for Buddhists, Brahmas are as numerous as the universes that exist. 29. Evolutionary action is generally divided into three types: virtuous, non-virtuous, and unwavering (anifijanakarma, mi g'yo ba'i las).

Exalted ones (arya, 'phags pa): those who have perceived the truth. This includes individuals on levels of realization from the path of seeing to final enlightenment. 31. The pure stages (visuddhibhumi, dag pa'i sa): the eighth, ninth, and tenth stages of awakening. They are called pure because the bodhisattvas who have reached those stages have completely purified pride. 32. \"Saintly\" denotes the attainment of arhatship (arhat, lit. \"worthy of ven­eration\"), most frequently translated into Tibetan as dgra bcom pa, \"one who has defeated the enemy\" (of the four demons-the emotions, the psycho­physical constituents, death, and the sensual pleasures). Here, the term re­fers specifically to proclaimers who have attained this level. The arhat has become free of attachment, aggression, and other mental impurities and has reached the \"healthiest\" state; it is therefore appropriate to call him or her a saintly one (from the Latin sanus, meaning \"clean,\" \"pure,\" or \"healthy\"). 33. Rhinoceros-like solitary sages (kha�gavi�iil}akalpa-pratyekabuddha, bse ru Ita bu'i rang rgyal): Like the unicorn rhinoceros that lives alone in the forest apart from the company of other animals of its kind, the solitary sages attain their own awakening in solitude without relying on a teacher and in a world where there are no buddhas. 34.

Fundamental consciousness (alayavijnana, kun gzhi rnam shes): a type of consciousness asserted mainly in the Idealist trend in Buddhist philosophy as the repository of predispositions and the source of the phenomenal world. 36.

Chapter III Space and Time in the Tantra of the Wheel of Time 1. The Tantra of the Wheel of Time (Kalacakra-tantra, Dus kyi 'khor lo'i rgyud). According to Buti:in Rinpoche, the Kalacakra Tantra was taught by the Bud­dha at Sri Dhanyakataka (Amaravati, Guntur District, in Andhra Pradesh, South India) in the year of his enlightenment to Sucandra, the King of Sambhala. Another version says that the Buddha taught this tantra in the year of his passing away into perfect peace at the age of eighty. It became widespread in India around the 966 C.E. and was introduced into Tibet in 1026. Kalacakra means \"Wheel of Time.\" \"Time\" refers to immutable bliss, and \"wheel\" to the special emptiness that this tantra teaches, the emptiness of material particles. Thus, Kalacakra means \"union of immutable bliss and emptiness.\" This multi-level teaching comprising descriptions of the universe, human body, and elaborated tantric techniques is linked to the mythical land of Sambhala where this tantra flourished."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 135-152 271 2. The original tantra of Kalacakra (said to be in 12,000 verses) was never translated into Tibetan, with the exception of a part entitled The Rite of Initia­tion (dBang mdor bstan) (Dg.K. rGyud 'bum, vol. Ka, ff. 14a-21a [Toh. 361]). However, some of its passages are quoted in related texts extant in the Ti­betan language. What is referred to today as the Kalacakra Tantra is a con­densed form (laghutantra, bsdus rgyud) known as the Great King of Tantras Issued from the Sacred Primordial Buddha, The Glorious Wheel of Time (Paramadi­buddhod-dhrta-srikalacakra-nama-tantraraja, mChog gi dang po'i sangs rgyas las phyung ba rgyud kyi rgyal po dpal dus kyi 'khor lo) (Dg.K. rGyud 'bum, vol.

'!his was composed by Maii.jusriyasas ('Jam-dpal Grags-pa), the eighth king of Sambhala, and the first to be called\" one who bears the lineage\" (kulika, rigs ldan). It is said that Maftjusriyasas was prophesied in the original tantra as the one who would write a condensed form of this tantra. 3. Adamantine body, \"vajra body\" (vajra-kaya, rdo rje Ius): the human body and particularly the internal channels and wheels of channels with energies and vital essences. 4. Mar:u;l.ala (circle, dkyil 'khor) here refers to the mystic palace and its setting where the Buddha Wheel of Time resides as the central figure surrounded by a number of deities. 5. Wheel of Time (Kalacakra, Dus-kyi-'khor-lo) here refers to the deity Kalacakra, the central figure of the Wheel of Time Tantra. 6. The four branches of familiarization and accomplishment: four stages of meditation practice in the Vajrayana: familiarization (asevita, bsnyen pa), close familiarization (upasevita, nye bar bsnyen pa), accomplishment (pratipatti, sgrub pa), and great accomplishment (mahapratipatti, sgrub pa chen po). 7. The four indestructible states (vajra) of body, speech, mind, and pristine wisdom. 8. The four states: ordinary waking consciousness, deep sleep, dream, and sexual union. 9. Kusa grass (Poa cynosuroides): a sacred grass used at certain rites of initia­tion and other religious ceremonies. 10. Centaur, literally \"man or what?\" (kirrmara, mi' am ci), here refers to a place; however, its name presumably comes from its inhabitants, mythical beings with a horse head and human body (or vice versa). They became celebrated as celestial musicians, along with the gandharvas. 11. The mountain is presumably called by this name because of the presence of the mandara tree or coral tree (Erythrina indica), which has scarlet flowers. 12. Vessel (drof}a, bre): a wooden vessel or bucket used as a measure of weight in ancient India. This mountain range apparently resembles the shape of this vessel. 13. Three attributes or qualities {gu1Ja, yon tan): motility (rajas, rdul), dark­ness (tamas, mun pa), and lightness (sattva, snying stabs). A concept prevalent"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"272 Myriad Worlds in and borrowed from the ancient Saqtkya philosophy according to which these qualities are the three constituents of prakrti (universal or primal sub­stance) and evolve into all the various categories of existence.

Magadha refers here to a city; however, Magadha was once an ancient kingdom and is now a district within the north-central Indian state of Bihar. Many of the major events of early Buddhist history, including the enlighten­ment of Buddha at the \"seat of awakening\" (rDo rje gdan), now called Bodhgaya, took place within this kingdom. 15.

Sravasti (mNyan yod): the ancient city founded by King Sravasta in the second quarter of the first millenium B.C.E. It later became the capital of the northwestern kingdom of Kosala, ruled by King Prasenajit, one of Buddha's patrons. Anathapir:u;iika, a wealthy merchant of this town, built a residence for Buddha known as the Jetavana, which became a favorite dwelling of the Buddha. In this place, the Enlightened One spent twenty-three rainy season retreats and he delivered a number of discourses on the Universal Way.

The name means \"one who bears the lineage.\" The first to receive this name was the eighth king of Sambhala, Maftjusriyasas ('Jam-dpal grags-pa}, after he was empowered by the deities of the adamantine (vajra) family. The Wheel of Time Tantra mentions twenty-five chieftains; the twenty-first, Aniruddha (Ma 'gags pa), who is reigning at present, ascended the throne in 1927. 26. Kalapa: \"composed of aspects.\" In the context of the Wheel of Time, \"as­pect\" refers to pristine wisdom. 27. The celestial sphere (go la) is a word that Tibetan translators left in San­skrit. The word is derived from the combination of the first syllable of guru, meaning heavy, and the first syllable of loghama, meaning light. \"Heavy\" denotes its ability to support the heavens; \"light,\" its ability to move. 28.

In depictions the lower part of its body is that of a dolphin and its head has a long snout and horns. Here, we have taken the liberty of translating chu srin as \"Capricorn\" because the symbol of Capricorn is a creature whose lower body resembles that of a dolphin. 30. Astrological language for the following enumeration: sky of six empty spheres indicates six zeros; naga, the number eight; and eyes, two: reading backwards, this gives twenty-eight million. 31. The planets move faster than the constellations, giving the impression that they are positioned above the stars. 32. The house where the influence of the sun is greatest. 33. The house where the influence of the moon is greatest. 34. Long Tail of Smoke (Ketu, mJug ring}, Eclipser (Rahu, sGra gcan}, Fire of Time (Kalagni, Dus me).

The sun and moon revealed the fraud to Vi!?l).U, who cut off Eclipser's head, which thereupon became fixed in the stellar sphere. Having become immortal through drinking the nectar, [he] has ever since wreaked vengeance on the sun and moon by occasionally swallowing them.

The Sarp.khya is an ancient Indian philosophi­cal school whose followers assert that all phenomena are included within twenty-five categories. They adhere to the view of permanence and follow the doctrine of the sage Kapila. The school has a theistic and non-theistic branch. The theistic Sarp.khya assert that the world and inhabitants are pro­duced through mutual dependence by Isvara, the Lord, and the primordial substance. 5. Nihilists (ucchedaviidin, chad par smra ba). In this context, the Indian school of the Carvakas (Hedonists) is implied. The Carvakas are followers of the god Brhaspati and of Juktopchenpa ('Jug stobs can pa), a student of the sage Lokaca�u.

This veil, which triggers deception, is simply an effulgence of intrinsic aware­ness which obscures intrinsic awareness itself, like the clouds which are formed by the heat of the sun and obscure the sun that created them. Because unawareness proceeds from intrinsic awareness and in its actual nature is not different from intrinsic awareness, one speaks of \"unawareness which is of an identical nature [with intrinsic awareness]\" (bdag nyid gcig pa'i ma rigpa). 18.

This refers to the four aggregates that are \"mere names\" (that is, without coarse form): the aggregates of feeling, dis­cernment, mental formations, and consciousness. These are the only aggre­gates that beings of the formless realm possess. 23. The four syllables: kham, sum, ram, yam. 24. Heroes (�aka, dpa' bo). 25. See NST, p.338. 26. See NST, p.339. 27.

Ignorance manifests as the pristine wisdom of the sphere of reality (dharma-dhatujfiana, chos dbyings ye shes); hatred manifests as mirror-like pris­tine wisdom (adarsajfiana, me long Ita bu'i ye shes); pride manifests as the pris­tine wisdom of equality (samatajfiana, mnyam nyid ye shes); attachment mani­fests as the pristine wisdom of discernment (pratyavek$iljfiana, so sor rtogs ye shes); and jealousy manifests as the pristine wisdom of accomplishing aims (krtyanu$thilnajfiana, bya sgrub ye shes). 35.
