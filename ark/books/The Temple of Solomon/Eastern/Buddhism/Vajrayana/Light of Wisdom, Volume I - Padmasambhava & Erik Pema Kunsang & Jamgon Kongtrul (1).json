In the context of recitation practice, approach is to visualize the yidam deity with the mantra in its heart center; full approach is the spinning garland of mantra syllables emanating light rays making offerings to all the buddhas in the ten directions; accomplishment is to receive their blessings, which purify all one’s obscurations; and great accomplishment is to transform the world into the mandala of a pure realm, the beings into male and female deities, sounds into mantra, and all thoughts and emotions into a pure display of innate wakeful­ness.

The Three Roots: The gurus of the three lineages are the root of the blessings of the four vajras. The yidams of the six sections of Tantra are the root of the supreme and common siddhis.

[ t u r ]In the case of the terma of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo entitled Lama Tentiyi Korsum, there is a general sadhana and also specific sadha- nas for each of the three kayas. In the case of the terma of Chokgyur Lingpa named Tukdrub Barchey Kiinsel, the general is the root cycle of teachings, while the specific are the individual sadhanas for Dharma- kaya Amitabha and so forth, as well as the application of the activities. As for root and branch, in the particular tradition of Chokgyur Lingpa, the root heart practice is Gongpa Kundu, while the branch heart prac­tices are Barchey Kihisel and Yishin Norbu Sampa LhUndrub. All of them condensed to the essential is the terma called Lama Ngodrub Gyatso.

Note, that the Tibetan equivalent for man­data is kyilkhor, which in English is “center-circle.” [epk]“Center” or manda means “essence” or sara} while la means “to take hold of” and therefore to capture the essence. Thus they explain the meaning of the word mandata. The “center” of the aggregates, elements, and sense-bases describes the “essence” kunda. This is the relative bodhichitta that forms the basis for great bliss» Taking hold of or capturing it by means of the (tummo practice of) blazing and drip­ping is explained as the hidden meaning of mandata.Alternately, the essence of all the teachings describes the view of the Middle Way. This is the ultimate bodhichitta, free from constructs, which is the natural great bliss and compassion. Taking hold of or capturing it by practicing their unity is explained as the general mean­ing of mandata. Their merging, or the combination of word and mean­ing, expresses mandata itself.Furthermore, “center” means that the natures of the aggregates, elements, sense-bases and objects, and disturbing emotions are the five families of male and female buddhas and the goddesses. “Circle” means cutting through the defilements.In the context of the common development and completion, man­data means the support and the supported, while in the context of the completion stage, mandata means the union of emptiness and compas­sion.

It is the nature of the space of the five consorts and is the perfect place, the dharmadhatu palace of Akanishtha. The syllable v a m symbolizes means, upaya, and is thus the perfect teacher, the buddha of the sixth family (Vajradhara). The bindu of the v a m syllable symbolizes union and is thus the perfect Dharma or teaching, the natural secret essence that is the continuity, tantra, of the indivisibly interconnected and uninterrupted ground, path, and fruition in which means and knowledge are a unity. The syllable ma stands for mana, cognizance, and is thus the sugata King of Consciousness. In a general way, m a is said to be the syllable that symbolizes mindfulness and is therefore smriti. Thus it is the perfect retinue because of retaining, with total recall, the meaning of tantra through the function of mindfulness. The syllable ya stands for the word yada meaning “upon a time” and there­fore is the perfect time, because it is the particle showing the time at which this text was expounded, [jo k y a b ]e and v a m symbolize means and knowledge.

The Father Tantras have the Five Stages, the Mother Tantras have the four seals, and the Nondual Tan­tras have the six unions. While the two latter will be explained below (in the following volumes), the Five Stages are as follows: the three solitudes of body, speech, and mind; illusory body; and unity. In an­other way, counting the solitude of body separately as the develop­ment stage, the Five Stages are: (1) the vajra recitation of the solitude of speech; (2) the meditation state of the solitude of mind, which is to meditate on the bindu in the heart center and then fix the mind upon it; (3) the illusory body, which is to visualize all appearances as the illusory deity and celestial palace; (4) the luminosity, which is to medi­tate on the luminosities of the three experiences and of the great emp­tiness after having gradually applied oneself to the former stages; and(5) the unity, which is to manifest again therefrom in the form of the deity, the nonduality of appearance and emptiness, [ jo k y a b ]60.

In the context of the path, “essence” is that which brings about real­ization or understanding and is indicated by the Sanskrit word sara, which means ocean. Just like the ocean is the basis from which other precious jewels and manifold things appear or originate, “essence” indicates the means, upaya, which is the accumulation of merit, [ j o ­k y a b ]71. Means and knowledge should not be separated, [ jo k y a b ]72. The natural is dharmakaya, the perfect enjoyment is sambhogakaya, and the body of emanation is nirmanakaya.

Thrangu Rinpoche explains: “The Ornament o f Realization (Abhisamayalamkara) clarifies the Second Turning of the Wheel of Dharma. The next three teachings are general works given to clarify all of Buddha Shakyamuni’s teachings. These are called the Ornament of the Sutras (Sutralamkara), Discerning the Middle and the Extremes, and Discerning Dharmas and Dharmata. The fifth work taught by Lord Mai­treya truly establishes the Third Turning of the Wheel of Dharma. It is called the U tta r a ta n tr a[epk]73. The two kayas are dharmakaya and rupakaya. The welfare of oneself, in this context, is not to be understood as meaning selfish, but in the sense that unless you realize dharmakaya you are utterly incapable of accomplishing the benefit of other beings by means of the two types of rupakaya, because the rupakaya cannot possibly manifest without dharmakaya. Once you realize dharmakaya, the rupakayas appear spontaneously. The dharmakaya is the splendor of oneself while the rupakaya is the splendor for others, [ t u r ]74. In the context of fruition, the arrival at the final stage of realization and understanding, the qualities of freedom are the thirty-two dharmakaya qualities of freedom. The qualities of maturation are the thirty-two rupakaya qualities of maturation.

The expression of awareness manifests as knowledge when the nature of mind has been recognized, as opposed to manifesting as normal delusion. This is what removes the obscurations and lets the enlight­ened qualities appear, [ t u r ]77. “The kayas as the support and the wisdoms as the supported are nei­ther separate nor different. The ultimate nature is always beyond trans­formation or change.” The rest of the quote is easy to understand.

In a further sense it is taught that everything is empty of all other things, but not of kayas and wisdoms; that is the intent of the buddhas. In brief, kaya means the two rupakayas, while yeshe is the mind within them. More­over, dharmakaya is devoid of constructs, a body of space. The sam- bhogakaya is described as the “wisdom wheel of personal perception” with a form of light, like a rainbow. The nirmanakaya is usually de­fined as the vajra body endowed with the six elements. Thus the latter two are called rupakayas, form bodies, since even a rainbow has form, while the nirmanakaya is made of flesh and blood; one is subtle, the other is coarse. In the age of the five degenerations, a buddha must appear in the coarse body of a nirmanakaya in order to be perceived by other beings. That was about the kayas.Next, about wisdom: the dharmakaya wisdom is unchanging, the sambhogakaya wisdom is all-pervasive, and the nirmanakaya is dis­tinct, individual perception. Among the five wisdoms, the dharma- dhatu wisdom refers to the state of dharmakaya; it is adorned with its four aspects, the other four wisdoms, which belong to the sambhoga­kaya state: the mirrorlike wisdom, wisdom of equality, discriminating wisdom, and all-accomplishing wisdom. The nirmanakaya wisdoms are the wisdom that knows the nature as it is and the wisdom that perceives all that exists, [ t u r ]79. Just like a huge rope lying soaked in a lake can slowly be pulled up once you get hold of one end, the enlightenment of all the buddhas is placed in the palm of the hand of the practitioner when receiving the pointing-out instruction from a qualified master and can then slowly be “pulled in” through diligent training, [ t u r ]80.

The natu­ral wrath of the tamer, the wisdom krodha, which is the knowl­edge of emptiness (prajna), the dharmakaya state of equality, spontaneously defeats the two obscurations. Without moving from that state, the means (upaya) of great compassion shows its natural expression in the form of wrathful rupakayas. Thus, through the union of these two, means and knowledge, those to be tamed experience that the tathagatas manifest in wrathfrd forms, [jo k y a b ]In yet another way of explaining the above, the tamers, the wisdom krodhas, are the five heruka families according to the Tantra Section, and Eight Sadhana Teachings or Nine Glorious Ones according to the Sadhana Section.

Jamgon Kongtriil says in his All-Encompassing Knowledge: “Mahayoga emphasizes means (upaya), the development stage, and the view that liberation is attained through growing accustomed to the insight into the nature of the indivisibility of the superior two truths.” The superior two truths in Mahayoga are purity and equality: The pure natures of the aggregates, elements, and sense factors are the male and female buddhas and bodhisattvas.

In his Buddha Nature, Thrangu Rinpoche said:In this context, the word for space is ying in Tibetan, dhatu in Sanskrit. It is the same word used in dharmadhatu, the realm or “space” of things. The word space is used because the dharmad­hatu is like the body or realm of empty space where different things, like clouds, birds, and airplanes can fly around without obstruction. This is because the nature of space is empty and non­existent. Due to this quality of openness, things can occur. Like­wise, dharmadhatu is the essence of things— empty and inconcrete— where all phenomena such as trees, houses, moun­tains, oneself, other beings, emotions, wisdom, and all experi­ences can occur openly.In this book, “dharmadhatu space” is often used as a synonym for buddha nature, [epk]110.

The three kayas as ground are essence, nature, and capacity; as path they are bliss, clarity, and nonthought; and as fruition they are the three kayas of buddhahood. The three kayas of buddhahood are the dharmakaya, which is free from elaborate constructs and endowed with the twenty-one sets of enlightened qualities; the sambhogakaya, which is of the nature of light and endowed with the perfect major and minor marks perceptible only to bodhisattvas; and the nirmana­kaya, which manifests in forms perceptible to both pure and impure beings, [tu r]166. There are three types of “tantra of words”: tantra manifest as sound is mind transmission or both the transmission of mind and symbol; tantra uttered as sound is the oral transmission of great masters; and tantra turned into symbols is the letter characters of the scriptures.

In short, heruka means “blood drinker.” [ j o k y a b ]171. The realm of the Great Sphere: Among the six types of Akanishtha mentioned by Buddhaguhya, this is the real or ultimate Akanishtha, which is called Palace of Dharmadhatu. According to the Great Per­fection, the dharmakaya realm is called the Luminous Vajra Essence. This was stated by Manjugosha [Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo].

The nature is ripened through having trained in the Dharma and the path during many former lives. By the power of that, the faculties are ripened, since the five ruling faculties of perfection have become extremely sharp. By the power of that, discriminating knowledge has ripened from the present intelligence obtained at birth.It is also held that the threefold ripening of disciples is of nature, interest, and thought. But the meaning is identical, since interest is the five ruling faculties of faith and so forth, [ jo k y a b ]175. The three types of pleasing actions are to please by means of material things, service, and practice. The last is the most eminent of the three. The first two perfect the accumulation of merit and the latter the accumulation of wisdom, [ jo k y a b ]176. Ajita [Maitreya], the Undefeatable, said: “Having first of all adorned his mind stream with the immense light of discriminating knowledge, which establishes knowable objects resulting from learning the philo­sophical root texts and so forth from a spiritual guide, the wise bodhi­sattvas will quickly engage in all the ultimate experiences of the buddhas.” [jo k y a b ]177. Separating or joining is synonymous with growing distant or close. [jo k y a b ]178. The word “space” (Tib. ying, Skt. dhatu) here refers to the dharma^- dhatu nature that is synonymous with the sugata essence. It is called “space” because of being uncompounded, beyond mental constructs, and beyond arising, dwelling, and ceasing. The use of the word “space” in this context should not be mistaken for physical space, which totally lacks a cognizant quality. The dharmadhatu space of one’s buddha nature is always indivisible from wakefulness, [t u r]179.

Explaining this quotation from the Uttaratantra, “Just as the example of the sky is all-pervading and present throughout all of the other four elements, having the nature of being without the concept of good or evil, likewise, the meaning of this is that the immaculate dharmadhatu space of the mind’s nature similarly pervades and is present everywhere throughout samsara, nirvana, and the path.” [ jo k y a b ]The Uttaratantra, literally “Unexcelled Continuity,” is one of the Five Doctrines of Maitreya, written down by the great Indian master Asanga. A translation of the Uttaratantra, The Changeless Nature by Katia and Ken Holmes, is available from Samye Ling in Scotland. For a discussion of its general meaning, see Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche’s Buddha Nature (Rangjung Yeshe Publications, 1993) and The Uttara Tantra: A Treatise on Buddha Nature (Sri Satguru Publications, 1994). [epk]181. The word “potential” (rigs) is sometimes also translated as “family” or “nature.” It is synonymous with sugata essence, tathagata-garbha, and buddha nature, [epk]182. For Jokyab Rinpoche’s details about the different Buddhist philosoph­ical schools* view about this nature, see Appendix 4, “The Sugata Essence.” [epk]183. To explain the quotation from the Sutra o f the King of Samadhi: “Pure by being free from the two temporary obscurations and crystal clear because dharmakaya does not dwell on anything whatsoever, the na­ture of mind is primordially luminous because of not being tainted by249"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Notesobscuration. It is unstirred or undisturbed by the primary and subsid­iary disturbing emotions, as well as being uncompounded by causes and conditions. This, the all-pervading sugata essence, is the original nature that is primordially present.” This explanation was according tojamdrak Rinpoche. [jo k y a b ] [ d k r ]i 84. Concerning what has been taught in all the profound tantras of Secret Mantra: the Three Outer Tantras of Mantrayana define the sugata es­sence as “profound and luminous nondual wisdom.” The Inner Man­trayana defines the ground in any of the different classifications of ground, path, and fruition as “nature” or “basic condition.” In regard to having purified the temporary defilements and having actualized the ground by the power of dispelling them, it is defined as “fruition.” [ jo k y a b ]e and v a m are what was described in the quotations [in Chapter 2]. Vajra being is the unity of emptiness and compassion and the insepara­bility of emptiness and bliss. Tantra (continuity) is the ground tantra of the indivisible two truths. The great unchanging sphere means the primordial ground of the single sphere of dharmakaya that is free from angles or comers. Luminosity is the uncompounded nature, present throughout all of samsara and nirvana. In particular, the New Schools of Secret Mantra use the phrase “ultimate coemergent wisdom,” while the Nyingma School uses “self-existing wakefulness.” This will be further explained below in the context of identifying the deity to be accomplished, [ jo k y a b ] (To appear in The Light of Wisdom, vol. 2.) [epk]185. To explain this quote from the Hevajra Tantra: “The precepts and sa- mayas of all the perfect buddhas without exception fully abide as the letters e and v a m , the empty bliss that is the unity of emptiness and compassion and the unity of development and completion:” [jo k y a b ]186. To explain the whole quotation: “That which is called ‘potential’ (rigs) is explained with the term ‘continuity of ground.’ This ground conti­nuity is taught to be the pure essence of dharmata, which is present since primordial time. Indestructible in the end, beyond dwelling in the between, and without arising in the beginning, this is proclaimed to be the primordial ground of the all-pervading and original sover­eign lord.” [jo k y a b ]Why is it called “continuity of ground” or “continuity of cause”? It is the ground or cause from which both samsara and nirvana arise,2 5 0"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Notessince samsara and nirvana are produced depending upon whether or not it has been embraced by some means. And since its nature remains unchanged and continual from sentient being to buddhahood, it is called “continuity.” [ j o k y a b ]187. The two types of potential are the naturally present potential and the developed potential, [epk]At the time of the ground, the naturally present potential is empti­ness, and the developed potential is cognizance. At the time of awak­ening the naturally present potential, one feels immeasurable interest, devotion, and joy when hearing about the nature of emptiness, and at the time of awakening the developed potential, one sheds tears out of compassion for sentient beings. An analogy for these two potentials is that the naturally present potential is present as the essence of empti­ness, like a jewel mine, and the developed potential is present as the developed qualities of the path, like cultivating a wish-fulfilling tree.At the time of the path, the two types of potential are, respectively, the five paths that are caused by the forming cause of emptiness and conditioned by the coproducing condition of compassion, as well as the ten bhumis that are caused by the forming cause of compassion and conditioned by the coproducing condition of emptiness.At the time of fruition, the naturally present potential is dhanna- kaya, and the developed potential is sambhogakaya. Hence they are of the nature of the sixty-four qualities of freedom and maturation. [ j o k y a b ]188. To explain this quote from the Uttaratantra: “If you and all sentient beings had not the potential for awakening, you would not feel weary of samsaric pain. You would not feel enthusiastic desire for the pure qualities of nirvana, nor would you even pursue the relinquishment of suffering and the attainment of happiness, or aspire for it with the desire to attain the fruition.” [ jo k y a b ]This phrase is also found in the Sutra o f the Lion’s Roar of Queen Shrimala, included in A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1983). [epk]189. To explain this quote from Uttaratantra: “Perceiving the different faults of suffering and the virtues of happiness of samsara and nirvana, the three levels of impure existence and the three types of pure nirvana result from having the potential of buddha nature.

It is because sentient beings without the potential for the two bodies of251"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Notesb u d d h a h o o d to arise w o u ld h a v e n o su c h p e r c e p tio n o r u n d e r s ta n d in g o f th e fault o f su fferin g a n d th e v ir tu e o f h a p p in e ss.” [jokyab]190. The Vajra Dome, which is the Instruction Tantra of the Two Segments says: “In the element of space, whatever exists—which means all that is pervaded by space—in the thousands of world systems—which means in the mental continuum of the sentient beings in the countless worlds of the three realms—the mind of the Awakened One, Maha- mudra, which is the union of emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects and the perfect and most eminent unchanging great bliss, always remains present, like the sky, which is beyond analogy.” This was said by Jamdrak Rinpoche.

The six classes of beings are gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings, [ t u r ]193. “Confusion arising from the presence of a basis” means being deluded while possessing the sugata essence, which is the ground of both sam- sara and nirvana. An example for this is coemergent ignorance, like a person with blurred eyesight meeting together with conceptual igno­rance, like the time of dusk, engaging in the cognition that appre­hends, due to the cause and condition of these two kinds of ignorance, the five sense objects of visual form, sound, and so forth, for instance, a mottled rope being seen to be a snake, because of the existence of snakes in a certain area, [jo k y a b ]Confusion arising from no presence, the temporary confusion, is like an eye with the blurred vision of coemergent ignorance seeing an apparition of hair in the sky, the conceptual ignorance, [ j o k y a b ] Confusion arising from indivisibility of the two [above] is like the essence of camphor having two abilities—just as confusion and libera­tion both take place from the ground—because it can be a medicine for the disease of heat and a poison for the disease of wind, and thus both samsara and nirvana appear, [ jo k y a b ]194. The single-nature ignorance is the presence of the mere quality of not recognizing the pure nature of the sugata essence, the subde cause for the cognitive obscuration in not recognizing one’s nature at the time of the space of the all-ground, which is undecided as to being pure or impure and which has not split up into the division of confusion and liberation, [jo k y a b ]252"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"NotesThe cause that is concurrent with the preceding and the proceeding is the ignorance that is accompanying or coemergent with the pure dharmata.

It is present in [or as] the all-ground consciousness, [ j o k y a b ]195. The mind consciousness, which is subtle thought occurrence, can be divided into two aspects: disturbed-mind consciousness and subse­quent cognition. (1) The disturbed-mind consciousness is gross feel­ings of like and dislike that fixate on a self-entity with regard to the all-ground by thinking “I am” and makes the consciousnesses [cogni­tions] disturbed with desire, anger, and delusion or causes weariness. (2) The subsequent mind is so-called because it is the extremely subde thought occurrence, which forms the cause for a sequence of cogni­tion. It is the six collections— consisting of the five sense conscious­nesses, such as visual cognition, in addition to the mental cognition of subde thought occurrence— that create the uninterrupted flow of a sequence of sense objects, such as visual form arising and ceasing, and place the seeds of karmic powers for accumulating disturbing emotions in the all-ground, [ j o k y a b ]All-ground consciousness, alaya-vijnana: The basis for these two aspects of subsequent cognition and disturbed-mind consciousness and the retainer of all the manifold tendencies and seeds of virtue and nonvirtue is known as the “labeling basis for confusion,” and thus it is in all the scriptural traditions defined as the all-ground conscious­ness.

The all-ground consciousness is not recognizing one’s natural face as the cognizant quality.

The related causes of outer dependent origination are root, trunk, branch, leaf, flower, and fruit. The related conditions are stabilizing earth, adhering water, maturing fire, expanding wind, accommodating space, and gradually changing time.The twelve related causes of inner dependent origination are de­scribed in a sutra: “Because of ignorance, formation arises; likewise, successively, consciousness, name and form, the six sense-bases, con­tact, sensation, craving, grasping, and becoming. Because of birth arises old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, unhappiness, and distress. Thus this great mass of total suffering arises.”The six related conditions are as mentioned above.

The eight gates of spontaneous presence, which are the self- display of awareness rising from the ground, manifested from the stir­ring of the wisdom wind, breaking the seal of the youthful vase body, the original ground space of primordial purity. At that moment the dharmakaya manifestation of primordial purity appeared above, like a cloudless sky, and the luminous sambhogakaya realms filled the ex­panse of sky straight ahead. From the expression of that, the great ground-manifestation appeared below, and from its expression below appeared the sambhogakaya manifestations, the manifestation of nir- manakaya realms in the cardinal and intermediate directions. Further below, from the gate of samsara, appeared the infinite self-manifest realms of the six classes of beings. All of this appeared naturally from the manifestation of the eight gates of spontaneous presence, and thus the great display of samsara and nirvana manifested simultaneously. Thus it has been taught, [ j o k y a b ]When the inner luminosity appeared as outward luminosity, the manifestation of essence was unobstructedly self-luminous, the mani­festation of nature was primordially radiant as five lights, and the mani­festation of compassion was self-manifest from the quality of openness, like a cloudless sky.

The Wish-Fulfilling Treasury explains:Being bound by fetters and having extremely unwholesome conduct,Not feeling weary about samsara and not possessing the slightest faith,Engaging in unvirtuous misdeeds and separating mind and Dharma,And corrupting one’s precepts and samayas—These are called the eight unfree states due to an unfortunate frame of mind.Moreover, the same text says:Being disturbed by the five poisons, deluded, and possessed by the maras,Being lazy and letting the sea of evil karma overflow,Being controlled by others, seeking shelter from fear, and pretending to be dharmic—These are the eight unfree states due to temporary conditions.

Emancipation means liberation from the three realms of samsara, as for instance the attainment of an arhat. In the context of Vajrayana, emancipation can also mean rebirth within a natural nirmanakaya realm, [ t u r ]226.

The physical misdeeds are to kill, to take what is not given, and to engage in sexual misconduct. The verbal misdeeds are to he, utter divisive talk, harsh words, and gossip. The mental misdeeds are to harbor covetousness, ill-will, and wrong views. These actions have the four factors o f object, intent, engagement, and completion. In the instance of killing, the object is to be unmistaken that someone is, for example, a human being. The intent is the desire to kill. The engage­ment is, for example, to take a weapon. The completion is that the life-faculty is interrupted. The other misdeeds are shown through this example, [jokyab]The sub-aspects of killing are to hit, beat, or oppress others and so on. The sub-aspects of stealing from others are to profiteer in business, to solicit and be pretentious, and so on. The sub-aspects o f sexual misconduct are to engage in wanton talk and so on. The other sub­aspects are shown through these examples, [jokyab]228. The ten virtuous actions are the opposites of the above ten unvirtuous actions, [jokyab]The three types o f emancipation are those o f the shravaka, pratye- kabuddha, and bodhisattva. [jokyab]229. The result of white virtuous actions is pleasure. The result o f black evil deeds is pain. Neutral actions bear no result, [jokyab]230. The ripened result (Tib. mam smin gyi ’bras bu) of these unvirtuous actions is the three lower realms. The result resembling the cause is o f two types:1. The result of experience resembling the cause, for each of the ten nonvirtues, respectively, is to have a short life span, lack necessities, have much strife in family life, meet with a lot o f slander, have no friends, hear unpleasant words, hear poindess talk, have no result from one’s hopes, always have fear, and meet with wrong views.2. The result of action resembling the cause is naturally to take delight in the particular aspects of the ten nonvirtues that one has been accustomed to in former lifetimes.The dominant result is that the environment has litde splendor, much hail and frost, abundant dust, deep undulations, briny soil, disor­dered seasons, litde crops, deep abysses, and lack of water.The result of the acting person is that the cause, though small, can be increased into many results, [jokyab]The four types o f impelling and completing, performed and accu­2 6 0"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Notesmulated, have four aspects: A white impelling karma while the com­pleting is black; a black impelling karma while the completing is white; both being white; both being black.

The Clouds of Precious Jewels is the Arya Ratnamegha Sutra, [epk]232. The five perpetuating aggregates are the aggregates o f forms, sensa­tions, conceptions, formations, and consciousnesses, [jokyab] See Ap­pendix 7, “ The Five Aggregates.”The eight sufferings o f human beings are the four major sufferings and the four subsidiary sufferings, [jokyab]These eight are: to take birth, to grow old, to fall sick, and to die; and in addition to be separated from what is beloved, to meet with what is unwanted, to fail to obtain what is desired although one strives for it, and the all-pervasive suffering of formation, [epk]233. To clarify the last clause: “ Because they have perceived with knowl­edge what is suffering, the effect o f the states o f gods and men, what is the cause o f this suffering, the karmas and the disturbing emotions o f the origin, and what is the cessation o f both the cause and effect o f suffering by means o f stopping the karmas and disturbing emotions.” [jo k yab]234. In the context of the shravakas of the lesser vehicles, the Buddha is nirmanakaya Shakyamuni, the Dharma is the four truths, and the San- gha is four: the stream-enterers, once-retumers, nonretumers, and ar- hats. [jokyab]According to the Mahayana, the Buddha is the four kayas and five wisdoms endowed with the twofold purity— the primordial purity of essence and the perfect purity o f nature. The four kayas are dharma- kaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, and svabhavikakaya, while the five wisdoms are the wisdom o f dharmadhatu and so forth. The Buddha possesses the twofold welfare: the benefit o f self, which is the qualities o f purity, peace, and realization; and the benefit o f others, which is the qualities o f knowledge, compassion, and ability, [jokyab]The Dharma has two aspects: the truth o f cessation, which is the three qualities o f inconceivability, nonduality, and nonthought; and the truth o f the path, which is the three qualities o f purification, clar­ity, and remedial power, [jokyab]The Sangha has two aspects; the three qualities o f knowledge,261"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Noteswhich are the wisdom o f the nature as it is, the wisdom o f all that exists, and the inner wisdom; and the three qualities o f freedom— from attachment, impediment, and inferior obscuration, [jokyab]235. To take refuge in the Three Jewels is the causal refuge, and to recog­nize that essence, nature, and capacity are the mandala of the Three Jewels and the Three Roots is the refuge of fruition, [jokyab]236. Having taken refuge in the Buddha, one should not bow down to non-Buddhist mundane gods. Having taken refuge in the Dharma, one should not cause harm to sentient beings. Having taken refuge in the Sangha, one should not keep the company of non-Buddhist friends. One should keep faith in, respect, and admiration for the sa­cred images, even down to a piece of a tsa-tsa; for the scriptures, even down to a single letter; and for the sacred robes, even down to a piece of saffron-colored cloth, [jokyab]One should follow sublime spiritual teachers; study, reflect upon, and practice the sacred Dharma; and having entered the gateway of the teachings of the Victorious One, one should not let the senses run rampant toward sense objects, but cherish the trainings, [jokyab]In addition, according to Ngari Panchen: (1) One should not aban­don the Three Jewels for gifts, or even at the cost of one’s life. (2) One should not seek other means even in dire need. (3) One should not omit the time for worship, (4) but establish self and others in the refuge. (5) One should pay homage to the buddha of the direction to which one is going. These five were accepted by Atisha as being gen­eral trainings, [jokyab]237. To explain the quote from this sutra: “Because of protecting the infe­rior type of person from all material and immaterial harms and from the three lower realms, such as the hells and so forth; because of pro­tecting the intermediate type of person from those who are not skilled in the means for attaining liberation from samsara and from the twenty peaks of the view of the transitory collection present in the mind of an immature ordinary person; as well as protecting the superior type of person from the lower vehicles of both shravakas and pratyekabud- dhas, they are taught to be the supreme refuge.” This was according to Jamdrak Rinpoche. Thus it is the refuge that is in conformity with the paths of the three types of individuals, [jokyab]238. The four samadhis are to focus one-pointedly on the four immeasur- ables, such as the samadhi of love and so forth, [jokyab]2 6 2"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Notes239. Concerning the strength of the cause, helper, and so forth, the Orna­ment of the Sutras says:The strength of the cause is the awakening of the naturally present potential.The strength of the helper is the strength of the spiritual friend. The strength of the root is the strength of having gathered roots of virtue.The strength of learning results from cultivating the virtues of learning, reflection, and meditation.Through this one does not adhere to the strength of the helper, but the strengths of the cause, root, and learning become more stable.This is explained as the generating of bodhichitta taught by others, [jokyab]240. (1) The bodhichitta of devoted engagement for ordinary people on the paths of accumulation and joining. (2) The bodhichitta of pure superior intention on the seven impure bhumis. (3) The bodhichitta of maturation on the three pure bhumis. (4) The bodhichitta of aban­doning all obscuration on the level of buddhahood. [jokyab]The twenty-two analogies given in the Ornament (Abhisamayalam- kara) are:These are like the earth, gold, the moon, and fire,Like a treasure, a jewel mine, and the ocean,Like a diamond, a mountain, medicine, and a teacher,Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, the sun, and a song,Like a king, a treasury, and a highway,Like a carriage and a fountain,Like a lute, a river, and a cloud—Thus there are twenty-two kinds.These twenty-two are examples for pursuing the aim and so forth up through dharmakaya. When combining them with the five paths: pursuance, intention, and superior intention are the path of accumula­tion; application is the path of joining; the paramita of generosity is the path of seeing; discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, discriminating knowledge, means, strength, aspiration, and wisdom are the nine stages of the path of cultivation; superknowledges, [the accumulations of) merit and wisdom, the thirty-seven factors condu­cive to enlightenment, shamatha and vipashyana, recall and coura­263"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Notesgeous eloquence—five altogether—comprise the special path of three pure bhumis together; and the banquet of Dharma, the singular jour­neyed path, and the possession of dharmakaya comprise the three as­pects of preparation, main part, and conclusion of the stage of buddhahood. You should know that all of them can be combined with three aspects: analogy, helper, and quality; for instance, the helper is the subject, the bodhichitta concurrent with pursuing the aim of enlightenment. The analogy is that it is like the earth, because it serves as the basis for all virtuous qualities, [jokyab]These are the two types defined according to their characteristics, aspiration, and application: the bodhichitta of aspiration is the four immeasurables, and the bodhichitta of application is the six paramitas. According to the system of Nagarjuna, the bodhichitta of aspiration is to pledge the effect, and the bodhichitta of application is to pledge the cause. According to the system of Asanga, the intention is the bodhi­chitta of aspiration, and the engagement is the bodhichitta of applica­tion. The bodhichitta of aspiration is the wish to attain buddhahood, like intending to travel. The bodhichitta of application is to train in bodhichitta, the means for attaining buddhahood, like traveling, [jo­kyab]241. The important Mahayana scriptures Bhumi Sections by Asanga consist of five sections, including the Bodhisattva Bhumi, and are found in the Derge edition of the Tangyur, no. 403 5 and following, [epk]Dharmata is the innate nature of phenomena and mind, [epk]242. The way of generating bodhichitta according to Mantrayana, such as in the context of the Lamdrey of the glorious Sakya School, is to chant the “I take refuge in the Three Jewels” and so forth immediately after the seven branches. This style of generating bodhichitta is similar to the Middle Way. [jokyab]These seven branches are: prostrating to the Three Jewels, confess­ing negative actions, making offerings, rejoicing in the virtue of oth­ers, requesting to turn the wheel of Dharma, beseeching to not pass into nirvana, and dedicating the merit to the enlightenment of all sen­tient beings, [cnr]243. The four black deeds are:To deceive a venerable person, to cause someone to regret what is not regrettable,To disparage a sublime person, and to deceive sentient beings.264"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"NotesThe four white deeds are the opposites of these, [jokyab]244. The four impure aspects are: (1) impure intention or motivation is self-interest and ill-will toward others, (2) impure materials are poi­sons, weapons, and so forth, (3) impure recipients are the non-Bud­dhist Jain ascetics and so forth, (4) impure method is what is temporarily or ultimately harmful, [jokyab]The four pure aspects are: (1) pure intention is the motivation of bodhichitta; (2) pure materials are, unlike poison, weapons, and the like, things to be given away, such as food, medicine, clothing, and so forth; (3) pure recipients of gifts are, upward, the Precious Ones and, downward, beggars and so forth; (4) pure methods are what is inge­nious and conducive to the welfare of other beings to be tamed, [jo­kyab]The four objects are: (1) one’s parents, who are the benevolent objects, (2) one’s preceptors and teachers, who are the respectable ob­jects, (3) the buddhas and bodhisattvas, who are the qualified objects, (4) the poor and destitute, who are the unprotected objects.Alternately: (1) the master and the Precious Ones are the object of qualities, (2) one’s parents are the objects that brought benefit, (3) sick people and so forth are the objects that suffer, (4) enemies and evil spirits are the sublime objects that bring harm.In another way: (1) the buddhas and bodhisattvas are the objects of qualities, (2) parents are the objects that benefit, (3) one’s master is both of those, (4) unprotected sentient beings are the objects of suffer­ing. [jokyab]245. Possessing this threefold purity means to control one’s body, speech, and mind against wrongdoing and to engage in what is virtuous, [jo­kyab]246. These four qualities are: to take the bodhichitta vows, to observe these vows, to maintain the purity of the vows, and, if violated, to restore them or make confessions. Thus they are called the four aspects of taking, observing, purity, and restoring, [jokyab]247. The seven types of Individual Liberation are male and female lay per­sons, male and female novices, monks and nuns, and candidate nuns.

The eighty subsidiary infractions are to forsake the happiness of an­other being and so forth.According to the system of Asanga, the Chariot of the Vast Con­duct, the precepts for the bodhichitta of aspiration are as follows: to never forsake sentient beings, to remember the benefits of bodhichitta, to gather the accumulations, to exert oneself in training in bodhichitta, as well as to adopt and avoid the eight black and white deeds as men­tioned above.The four precepts for the bodhichitta of application are [to avoid the following]: (i) out of desire, to have exceeding attachment to honor and gain and to praise oneself and disparage others, (2) out of stinginess, to refrain from giving material things, Dharma teachings, and wealth to others, (3) out of anger, to harm others and be unforgiv­ing when offered an apology, (4) out of stupidity, to pretend that indo­lence is Dharma and to teach that to others. The forty-six minor infractions are to refrain from making offerings to the Three Jewels and so forth, [jokyab]248.

[jokyab]249. The five notions are according to the Bodhisattva Bhumi: “It is taught that one should generate and meditate upon these five notions: culti­vate the notion that harmdoers are your beloved ones, the notion of simply following the Dharma, the notion of impermanence, the no­tion of suffering, and the notion of completely cherishing [other be­ings].” [jokyab]The nine considerations are according to the view of the master Shantideva: “To consider that others who harm oneself have no self- control, to consider the shortcomings of one’s own actions, to con­sider the shortcomings of the physical body, to consider the shortcom­ings of the mind, to consider harmdoers without making a difference, to consider those who benefit, to consider those who are most kind, to consider how to please the buddhas, and to consider what has great benefit and to be patient.” [jokyab]250. These two are the absence of the individual self and of the pelf-entity of phenomena, [jokyab]251.

[jokyab]The eight types of application that discard these five shortcomings are: faith, determination, effort, pliancy, mindfulness, conscientious­ness, attention, and equanimity. The first four discard laziness. That is to say, for the attainment of samadhi, through determination with faith and through striving one attains pliancy by generating effort and thus discards laziness. Mindfulness means not to forget the instruction. Conscientiousness means to discern the occurrence of dullness and agitation. If they do occur, attention is the application of the remedies to discard them. Equanimity means to rest with no application of conceptual thinking when they have subsided. These are progressively the remedies against forgetfulness of the instruction and so forth, [jo­kyab]252. The nine means of mental stillness are:Resting, continual resting, and repeated resting,Fully resting, taming, and pacifying,Fully pacifying, one-pointedness, and settling in equanimity.Resting is to direct the mind toward the object. Continual resting is to maintain the continuity of that. Repeated resting is to discard forgetfulness and distraction and then return to the object. Fully rest­ing is to progress further and further by resting in that way. Taming is to contemplate the virtues of samadhi and take delight in them. Paci­fying is to regard distraction as a flaw and to make dislike for samadhi subside. Fully pacifying is to pacify the causes for distraction, such as the subsidiary disturbing emotions, as well as all the mental eruptions of covetousness, sluggishness, sleep, mental pain, and so forth. To­gether with the actualization of that, one-pointedness is to attain still­ness. Following that, settling in equanimity is to attain the natural stillness in regard to the object of focus, without having to apply ef­fort. [jokyab]253.

(3-4) The two masteries over all external sentient and insentient forms by means of the conception that they are inner form­lessness. (5-8) The four masteries of emitting rays of light to gain mastery over the external colors of blue, yellow, red, and white by willing them to be absorbed within, [jokyab]The eight emancipations are the emancipation of regarding what has form to be form, the emancipation of regarding the formless as having form, the emancipation of the repulsive and clearing away hin­drances, the four emancipations of the four formless states, and the emancipation of cessation, [jokyab]“And so forth” indicates the nine serene states of successive abiding, which are the four dhyanas, the four formless states, and the serenity of cessation, [jokyab]There are coundess billions of samadhi doors, such as the vajralike samadhi and so forth, [jokyab]254. The eleven ways of benefiting others are as explained [six notes] above, [jokyab]255. The three spheres are subject, object, and action, or in the instance of giving, the thing given, the act of giving, and the recipient of the gift. [jokyab]256. Language, logic, craftsmanship, healing, and so forth, can be included within three topics: elimination, safekeeping, and all-knowing. The knowledge of language eliminates the delusion about words, and the knowledge of logic eliminates the delusion about meaning. The knowledge of craftsmanship is beneficial for external physical enjoy­ments, and the knowledge of healing is beneficial for inner physical disorders. The Three Collections (Tripitaka) are for the purpose of achieving personal all-knowing, and thus one should train in the inner topics of knowledge, such as the Vinaya, Abhidharma, Middle Way, Prajnaparamita, and so forth. As is said, “Even noble and eminent beings do not achieve omniscience unless they become learned in the five sciences. Therefore, exert yourself in them in order to eliminate [ignorance], to safeguard other beings, and to gain personal all-know­ing.” [jokyab]2 6 9"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"NotesThe five minor sciences are merely subsidiary aspects. That is to say, they are five ways of not being ignorant. When knowing calculation you are not ignorant about numbers; when knowing poetics you are not ignorant about literary embellishments; when knowing composi­tion you are not ignorant about verse meters; when knowing syn­onyms you are not ignorant about words; and when knowing dramatics you are not ignorant about types of language. When added together, these are known as the ten topics of knowledge, [jokyab] The well-spoken Words of the Buddha are of three types: words spoken personally, words spoken through blessing, and words spoken with permission, [jokyab]The treatises that explain their meaning include explanations by bodhisattvas, such as the Trilogy of Commentaries by Bodhisattvas, expla­nations by shravakas, such as the Great Treasury o f Exposition, explana­tions by ordinary beings, learned masters who have entered the path, such as the treatises renowned in India and Tibet, [jokyab]There are also treatises that summarize the extensive, treatises that elucidate the profound, treatises that revive the declined, treatises that gather the scattered, and treatises that arrange the disordered into se­quence.

The four special qualities are to be free from fixation and clinging because of not conceptualizing the three spheres, to have no expecta­tion of a reward, to increase [the virtue] by dedicating at the end, and to possess the methods of the union of emptiness and compassion. These are clarified in the text itself, [jokyab]The three levels of enlightenment are the enlightenment of the shravaka, the enlightenment of the pratyekabuddha, and the great en­lightenment, which is the state of buddhahood. [jokyab]The knowledge that does not conceptualize the three spheres is prajna, the direct insight into emptiness that does not form notions of a subject, an object, or an action related to them as having any con­crete, true, independent existence, [cnr]258. When mentioning that each of the six paramitas can be divided further into six, in the instance of generosity, generosity is the material being given, discipline is the purity, patience is to avoid being angry even when someone begs repeatedly, diligence is to give quickly, concen­tration is to focus one’s attention one-pointedly upon that, and knowl­edge is to refrain from conceptualizing the three spheres, [jokyab]270"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Notes259. T he extensive classifications m entioned in the Sutra of the Good Aeon are 121 types, beginning with the statement, “There are the six para- mitas of the perfect training of the King of Supreme Joy” and conclud­ing with, “The six paramitas of fully distinguishing sacred remains.” [jokyab]260. The four attributes of a virtuous practitioner are not to respond with anger toward anger, not to respond with insult when insulted, not to respond with accusations when accused, and not to respond with beat­ing when beaten, [jokyab]261. To explain this quotation:The generosity of not having expectation for a reward in the future; the discipline of not desiring the fruition of a rebirth among gods or human beings; the patience toward everything with or without form, having abandoned aggression toward all beings; the diligence of quickly cultivating all white virtuous qualities, in general, and all the virtues of freedom and matura­tion, in particular; the concentration that is not a mundane state of dhyana because of transcending the realms of form and the formless states; and the knowledge of emptiness endowed with skillful means of compassion—thus those who adhere to these six paramitas of generosity and so forth should practice them per­fectly. [jokyab]262. The Ornament of the Sutras says: “The first means by being in harmony with generosity; the second means teaching that to disciples by using words spoken pleasandy; the third is to act meaningfully by personally applying what should be adopted or avoided; and the fourth means to be consistent with the meaning of liberation by following it oneself. This is regarded as the sequence.” [jokyab] [dkr]263. To explain this quotation: “Because giving is the means for bringing temporal and lasting benefit, because pleasing words are what accepts disciples, because meaningful action is what makes them enter the path, and likewise because consistency causes them to follow the con­duct of the sons of the victorious ones, they are called the four means o f attraction.” [jokyab]264. Emancipation means liberation from the three realms of samsara, such as rebirth in a pure buddhafield. Omniscience (Tib. mam mkhyen, thams cad mkhyen pa) is the same as complete enlightenment or bud- dhahood. [tur]271"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Notes265. The Seven Points of M ind Training are: stating the preliminaries, the supporting teachings; training in the main part, the awakened mind; turning negative circumstances into the path of enlightenment; stating concisely the practice for the entire life; the commitment of mind training; the precepts of mind-training; and evaluation of mind train­ing. [jokyab]266. The word “self-nature” here means an inherently existent identity and independent substance of the individual self or of phenomena, [cnr]267. Tirthikas are usually the name for non-Buddhist teachers of philoso­phy adhering to the extreme views of etemalism or nihilism. How­ever, His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche once told me that the tirthikas are within ourselves as different forms for incorrect under­standing, as are the shravaka and pratyekabuddha views in the form of partial understanding, [cnr]268. To explain this quote by Nagaijuna, alias Phakshab: “If the existence of a certain impermanent thing is established in dependency upon something permanent, that impermanence is itself also dependent upon permanence. And if the existence of the dependent permanent object is to be established based on the given label ‘impermanence,’ well then, tell me how you can establish the true existence of some­thing that is only the word ‘permanence’ dependent upon-the word ‘impermanence’ ”? [jokyab] [dkr]269. To explain this quote: “All outer and inner composite things are de­void of a permanent essence which, according to the tirthikas, has an indestructible nature and a substance that remains into the following instant. The proof of this is, respectively, because their nature does not remain but changes into some other situation and because their continuity appears to cease. According to the Middle Way, things are devoid of an essence. Why? Because all things are asserted to be empti­ness devoid of a ‘me’ and ‘mine,’ there also exists no true attribute such as ‘impermanence’ based thereon.” [jokyab] [dkr]270. The three realms are the samsaric realms of Desire, Form, and Form­lessness. The Realm of Desire is comprised of the abodes of hell be­ings, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, asuras, and the gods of the six abodes of Desire gods. It is called “Realm of Desire” because of the tormented mental pain caused by gross desire and attachment. The Realm of Form is comprised of seventeen samsaric heavenly abodes, consisting of the threefold Four Dhyana Realms and the Five Pure2 7 2"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"NotesAbodes. The beings there have bodies of light, long lives, and no painful sensations. The Realm of Formlessness consists of the most subtle states of samsaric existence, the abodes of unenlightened beings who have practiced the four formless states. These beings dwell in unchanging equanimity for long durations of time, after which they again return to lower states within samsara. [epk]271. To explain this quote:Moreover, when all these phenomena comprised of cause and effect are by the very identity of their nature devoid of coming forth and devoid of going away, and likewise abide neither in the middle nor in extremes, then how can karmic deeds, as the causes, and the ripening of karmic deeds, as the results, have any reason­able true existence? They don’t! Being nonexistent also in the ultimate sense that transcends the relative, they have no coming or going whatsoever, neither in space nor in time. In terms of the conventional truth, however, there are the teachings of entering the path of accepting and rejecting causes, as well as of the white and black ripening of the results of karmic deeds, [jokyab] [dkr]272. Details of the Vaibhashikas are included in Appendix 11, “The Four Schools of Buddhist Philosophy.” [epk]273. The Commentary on the Vajra Heart mentions that there are four Bud­dhist philosophical schools:The Buddhists have four schools;A fifth is not the intent of Shakyamuni.Although the Hinayana has the two divisions of shravakas and prat- yekabuddhas, the view of the pratyekabuddhas is equivalent to the Sautrantika, while their resolve and conduct resembles the general system of the shravakas. These points are therefore not mentioned separately, [jokyab]274. To explain this quote:Two types of truth, conventional and ultimate, have been taught. What are their definitions? When something, as a jug, for in­stance, can be destroyed into pieces, it is no longer perceived by the mind and so has conventional existence, as in the example of the jug that no longer yields the concept “vase” once it has been smashed into pieces. Or, when something can be eliminated by273"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"the intellect, it will not be perceived by the mind and therefore also has conventional existence, as in the example of water that no longer yields the concept “water” once the mind eliminates its attributes, such as physical form. Since they are nothing but their imputed names, a thing, just like a jug or water, does exist conventionally because it is not an untruth. But ultimate exis­tence is different from that, [jokyab]275. To explain this quote: “Since the center particle is touched at six points in different directions, the most subde particle has six direc­tional parts and thus the claim of partlessness is defeated. If the six directional particles were a single spot, even a heap the size of Mount Sumeru would be only the size of one partless particle and would therefore be like empty space.” [jokyab]276. For Jokyab Rinpoche’s further details, see Appendix 11, “The Four Schools of Buddhist Philosophy.” [epk]277. To explain this quote, “Like a star, an apparition, or a flame,” among these nine analogies to illustrate conditioned phenomena, a star is visi­ble at night but not in the daytime. Its shimmering movement, which does not remain from one moment to the next demonstrates the aris­ing and ceasing of conditioned things. An apparition is like the person suffering from an eye disease, making him see double floating strands of hair. The flame from a butter or oil lamp bums and perishes every instant from the moment it was lit until the continuity of burning is suddenly destroyed by a wind, for instance. The rest is easy to under­stand. [jokyab]278. To explain the quote: “If the self were the aggregates, then this self would be subject to arising and perishing. But if the self is different from the aggregates, the self would have none of the aggregates’ char­acteristics, such as arising, remaining, or perishing.” [jokyab]279. To explain this quote: “The self does therefore not exist as something other than the aggregates, because there is no existent basis for holding the self as any other thing besides the aggregates.” [jokyab]280. The Buddha moreover said: “One is one’s own protector. One is also one’s own enemy. When doing good or evil, one is one’s own wit­ness.” And, “When thoroughly having tamed himself, the wise achieves the higher realms.” [jokyab]Notes2 7 4"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"281. To explain this quote, “Just as with the end of an instant of completed action or of the finality of time, you should also examine whether at first it has a beginning and next a middle. Similarly, because you must examine these three aspects of an instant, a world possessing continuity does in fact not abide for even one moment.” [jokyab]The Precious Garland, Ratnavali, was authored by Nagarjuna and is translated under the same name by Jeffrey Hopkins, [epk]282. To explain this quote: “The claim that things do exist is the belief in permanence, while the claim that things do not exist is the belief in nihilism. For this reason all learned people abide neither in existence nor in nonexistence.” [jokyab]283. About nonarising: in the aspect of ultimate truth, all phenomena are devoid of an independent, concrete identity and have therefore no basis for such attributes as arising, dwelling, or ceasing, i.e., coming into being, remaining in time and place, and ceasing to exist, [epk]284. “Moons of Speech” is synonymous with buddhas. [tur]The constructs of the eight limits are the mental formulations of mind or phenomena having such attributes as arising and ceasing, being singular or plural, coming and going, and being the same or being different, [cnr]285. To explain this quote:From this sugata essence there is nothing whatsoever of the faults of the two obscurations to remove, since it is primordially untain­ted by defects, nor is there, moreover, even the slightest new thing to add or new achievement to gain because of being pri­mordially endowed with the basis for freedom through being de­void of extraneous, momentary elements, as well as with the qualities of freedom and maturation. Look correctly and truly into the true and unmistaken view, the basis that is not empty of the elements of unexcelled qualities and which is free from something to accept or reject, remove or add. And thus, to see the true fruition is the total and unexcelled freedom from the two obscu­rations. [jokyab]286. To explain this quote: “I, a bodhisattva, have no such pretense as holding the individual notions of settling in the meditation state of emptiness, which is like space, or emerging from it during the post­meditation, which is like a magical illusion. And why is this? It isNotes2 7 5"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Notesbecause o f fully realizing that emptiness is forever the nature o f all knowable phenomena.” [jokyab]287.

All the extremely profound sutras state that the complete realization of the twofold egolessness, which is not seeing any fixation on con­creteness, free from extremes, and utterly unbiased— that is the true seeing of the suchness of the buddhas. [jokyab]289. The two obscurations are the obscuration of disturbing emotions and the cognitive obscuration, [jokyab]The five eyes are the physical eye, the divine eye, the eye of knowl­edge, the Dharma eye, and the buddha eye.

The sixteen moments of cognition, ensuing cognition, acceptance, and ensuing acceptance of the Dharma for each of the four truths, at the end of the stage of supreme mundane attribute, are first the four concerning suffering: the acceptance of cognizing the attributes of suf­fering, the cognition of these attributes, the acceptance of ensuing cognition, and this ensuing cognition; thus there are four aspects of wisdom. When combining the other three— origin, cessation, and path—in the same fashion, there are in all sixteen wisdoms.There exist numerous different ways in which the Hinayana schools define the sixteen moments mentioned above; the Mahayana schools as well have several positions.There are said to be sixteen since the objects discerned, the four truths, each have four aspects, which are understood gradually and not all at once. Hereby one acquires the capability to be unafraid of the nonarising nature of things, [jokyab]291.

Appendix 12, “The Bodhisattva Bhumis,,, contains a detailed defini­tion of bhumi. [jokyab]The five kinds of fear are as stated in a sutra: “As soon as you attain the first bhumi of the Joyous you are totally free from these five kinds of fear—the fear of lacking the means of livelihood [having nothing to eat], the fear of no verse [of praise from others], the fear of death, the fear of the lower realms, and the fear of being intimidated amidst an [even oceanlike] gathering [when expounding the Dharma].” [jo­kyab]The twelve times one hundred qualities are described like this: on the first bhumi you realize twelve times one hundred qualities, includ­ing meeting one hundred buddhas simultaneously, [jokyab]Jokyab Rinpoche’s further details of these qualities are mentioned in Appendix 12, “The Bodhisattva Bhumis.” [epk]295. The ten masteries on the eighth bhumi are described like this:Through mastery over wealth, rebirth, and life,Wisdom, interest, mind, and action,Miracles, aspiration, and all teachings,He is the mighty king of the three realms.The four right discriminations on the ninth bhumi are the right discrimination of definitive words, meaning, phenomena, and coura­geous eloquence. Their respective causes are language, the Collec­tions, scientific calculus, and reasoning, [jokyab]296. To explain this quote: “Having fully turned the three successive Dharma Wheels of the causal teachings of the philosophical vehicles, which apply the causes for a buddhahood that is not a fruition in the present situation, [the Buddha prophesied] that the short path of the resultant Vajra Vehicle, which applies the fruition of buddhahood in the present situation, ‘will appear twenty-eight years after I have passed into nirvana.’ ” [jokyab]297.

The eight collections of consciousnesses are the all-ground, the defiled mental consciousness, the mental cognition, and the cognitions of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body, [jokyab]299. The paths of ripening and liberation are two vital parts of Vajrayana practice: the empowerments that ripen one’s being with the capacity to realize the four kayas and the liberating oral instructions enabling one actually to apply the insight that was introduced through the em­powerments. [cnr]300. Development and completion are the two main aspects— the “means and knowledge”—of Vajrayana practice. Briefly stated, development stage means positive mental fabrication, including visualization and mantra recitation, while completion stage means resting in the unfab­ricated nature of mind, [epk]301. In this Mantrayana statement about the special qualities of objects, time, situation, and mental faculties, “objects” means to enjoy the five sense pleasures, “time” means to swiftly achieve the fruition, “situa­tion” means to experience everything as purity, and “mental faculties” means the methods that correspond to the person of the highest and other types of capacity, [jokyab]302. Dombi Heruka accepts five special qualities of Mantrayana:Here there is the special quality of the recipient,The special quality of the teaching given,The special quality of the scriptures, and of the path;Thus through the special quality of fruition,The vehicle of Mantra is especially exalted.According to Indrabhuti, Mantrayana is superior due to these seven: the special quality of the master, recipient, ritual, activities, commit­ment, view of training, and conduct.Moreover, according to the master Jnana Shri, Mantrayana is supe­rior because of these eleven qualities: the skillful means of focusing on the unexcelled aim, of unexcelled practice, of unexcelled wisdom, of unexcelled exertion, of the capacity to accept all disciples without exception, of consecration of the disturbing emotions, of swift bless­ings, of quick results, of the abandonment of disturbing emotions, of unexcelled attitude, and finally, the skillful means of unexcelled con­duct.

This is the subde cognitive obscuration mentioned in the teachings of Man- trayana.The coarse version is the [process of] dying or union. The interme­diate is when fainting or falling asleep. The subtle is during a sneeze or a hiccup. The extremely subtle happens unceasingly during any thought occurrence. However, the degree of subdety between sleep and union can be reversed.It is generally taught that this subde defilement of the three aspects of appearance, increase, and attainment is more subde during union than when falling asleep. The reason for this is that slight breathing still takes place during deep sleep, while it is said that the movement of breath ceases for a moment when the bodhichitta of the union transfers.The obscuration of transference of the kunda-like bodhichitta of union is the manifest obscuration. The obscuration of the tendencies is unmanifest and subde.

The First Turning of the Wheel of Dharma was primarily on the sixteen aspects of the four truths, taught by the Buddha at the Deer Park in Samath.
