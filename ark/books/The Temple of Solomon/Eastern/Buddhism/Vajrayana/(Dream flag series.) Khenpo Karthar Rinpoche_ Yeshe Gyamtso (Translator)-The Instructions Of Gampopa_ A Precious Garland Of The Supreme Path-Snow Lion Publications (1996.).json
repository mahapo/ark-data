The commentary by Ven. Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche was presented orally to a group of his students at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra (KTD), the Karma Kagyu Monastery in Wood-stock, New York, in the closing days of 1991. The teaching was translated by Lama Yeshe Gyamtso. Gampopa lived from 1079 to 1153 C.E.1 He was born in cen-tral Tibet, and was trained as a doctor, but when his family succumbed to an epidemic, he promised his wife on her death-bed that he would become a monk and devote his life to Bud-dhism. Gampopa was ordained as Sonam Rinchen at the age of twenty-six, and he was trained in the Kadampa tradition that originated with Atisha.2This tradition taught a graded path to enlightenment, emphasizing a thorough grounding in the self-discipline and basic meditation of the hinayana, as well as training the mind in loving-kindness, compassion, and the view of emptiness at the mahayana level. Later he met the great yogi Milarepa and became his foremost student. Milarepa' s teacher, Marpa the translator, had brought the vajrayana or"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 The Instructions of Gampopa tantric teachings of the mahasiddhas from India, including the six yogas of Naropa, in a system known as mahamudra, the\" great seal.\"3 Gampopa thus combined the Kadampa tradition with the mahasiddha tradition from India. He established a monas-tery at Gampo Dar (whence his name), where he gathered many students, who later founded a number of schools of the Kagyu lineage. In particular, the Karma Kagyu lineage arose from Gampopa's student Dusum Kyenpa, the first Karmapa, who founded Tsurphu Monastery, the present home of his seven-teenth incarnation, His Holiness Urgyen Trinley. Other main works of Gampopa are. The Jewel Ornament of Liberation4 and The Four Dharmas of Gampopa. Yen. Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche has been abbot of KID in Woodstock since its inception in 1978, and is spiritual director of a number of affiliate centers. He was born in Kham in east-em Tibet in 1924, was ordained as a monk at the age of twelve, and was trained at Thrangu Monastery. He taught at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, India after leaving Tibet in 1959 with His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa, and in 1975 was recognized as a Choje Lama or Superior Dharma Master. Rinpoche's first book, Dharma Paths, was published by Snow Lion Publications in 1992. Lama Yeshe Gyamtso was born in Canada, and is a student ofKyabje Kalu Rinpoche. He completed two three-year retreats under the direction of Yen. Lama Norla. He has translated ex-tensively for Kalu Rinpoche, Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche, and other lamas, and has given Buddhist teachings himself. He is known for his clarity and precision in communicating the Bud-dhist teachings. David McCarthy is a long-time student of Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche who has worked for several years on a project to tran-scribe and edit Khenpo Karthar's teachings. We wish to thank Michael Erlewine for his support of David during his work on this text.

The Tibetan text of A Precious Garland was taken from the block print edition produced at Rumtek Monastery. Lama Phunsok Bist, the chant master of Rumtek Monastery, entered the Tibetan text into the computer, for which we thank him. Our translation of the root text was made during the summer of 1995 at KTD. An early translation of the same work was in-cluded in Evans-Wentz's Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, and we recently became aware of an independent translation by Eric Perna Kunsang.5 As usual in Buddhist works, there are a number of Sanskrit and Tibetan words as well as references to Buddhist concepts. We have tried to explain unusual terms when they appear, but since there are now many books available on the Dharma, we have not felt it necessary to include a glossary. Many readers will know the basic terms and ideas, and for those who do not, a number of books have glossaries of Buddhist terms, includ-ing Khenpo Karthar's Dharma Paths. We hope that the words of Gampopa and the commentary of Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche will benefit many students of the Buddhadharma. Laura M. Roth"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Instructions of Gampopa: A Precious Garland of the Supreme Path COMMENTARY BY VEN. I<HENPO I<ARlHAR RlNPOCHE The author of A Precious Garland of the Supreme Path was Lord Gampopa, who was also known as Dagpo Rinpoche or Lord Sonam Rinchen. Lord Gampopa is considered the father of the Kagyu tradition-the root and basis for its existence. His activity in this regard began in a previous life in which he was a bodhisattva named Chandra Prabha Kumara or \"Youthful Moonlight,\" who was a student of Buddha Shakyamuni. Lord Buddha predicted in the Samadhiraja Sutra that during the age of decadence6Youthful Moonlight's incarnation would propa-gate the teachings of that sutra, which are the true meaning, the mahamudra. Through his aspiration as a bodhisattva and the blessings of Lord Buddha Shakyamuni, Youthful Moonlight was reborn in Tibet as Lord Gampopa, and created what we know as the Kagyu lineage. In his life as Lord Gam pop a, he composed a variety of shastras or commentaries on the Buddha's teachings. Two of the most notable are The Jewel Ornament of Liberation and A Precious Gar-land of the Supreme Path. Of these two especially, but also of his"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 The Instructions of Gampopa other works, Gampopa said that for those in the future who have strong faith in him, studying these texts would be exactly the same as receiving teachings directly from him. He said that although future students would not have the opportunity to meet him personally, he could not convey more to them than what is in these texts. The text of A Precious Garland of the Supreme Path begins with the Sanskrit words namo ratna guru, which mean, \"I pay hom-age to the precious lama.\" This homage is to Gampopa's root gurus, principally Lord Jetsun Milarepa, as well as to his other gurus who embody the qualities that he is going to set out. In the Tibetan text that follows, he pays homage to the holders of the stainless practice lineage, whose splendor radiates like the light of the sun throughout space, as a result of their having developed three qualities. The first is that, externally, they en-gage in the proper conduct that liberates them and enables them to bring others to liberation. Second, they have internally real-ized the vast, ocean-like, innermost, profound meaning of the Dharma. Third, their aspirations to benefit beings have come to maturity, enabling them actually to help others. At this point Gampopa requests that the holders of this stain-less practice lineage, who possess such inconceivable qualities, engulf both him and his followers in their splendor. This refers to his immediate students and those in the future who will prac-tice this tradition. Next, Gampopa explains that the glorious speech of the Kagyupas consists of the precise instructions in the correct view, meditation, and conduct. He himself heard these instructions, properly considered them, and, not only that, he put them into practice. Being tormented by overwhelming compassion for all beings, he set out these instructions for the benefit of his stu-dents and future followers. In writing this text Gampopa dis-played the skill of his consummate compassion, fulfilling the actions of a holder of the lineage of the buddhas, and directly benefiting sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1 The Ten Causes of Loss Gampopa says that those in the future who wish to obtain lib-eration and the state of omniscience, or complete buddhahood, should constantly remember the ten causes of loss. The first of the ten causes of loss is wrongdoing. The point here is that the only possible cause for experiencing human existence, which is the basis for the practice of Dharma, is keep-ing pure moral conduct. Since very, very few beings preserve any form of genuine morality, very few beings attain a human existence. Generally speaking, people do not practice that which is virtuous, but engage in that which is harmful-in wrongdo-ing. Until wrongdoing is relinquished, a person will never at-tain liberation from suffering or even liberation from the lower realms of existence, let alone omniscience, and will have no ability to benefit others in any way. Therefore, the first thing that is a cause of loss is wrongdoing. The second cause of loss is wasting this precious human ex-istence, which has what are known as the eight freedoms and the ten resources? It is important to appreciate that only in this precious human existence, with these eighteen characteristics, does a being actually have the ability to practice Dharma. The first cause of loss involves actions that will prevent birth as a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 The Instructions of Gampopa human being in general. Here, we are concerned especially with those actions that will prevent us from experiencing that par-ticular type of human existence called \"the precious human existence,\" that is, human existence that possesses the eight free-doms and the ten resources. The third cause of loss is meaningless distraction and mean-ingless busy activity. The age in which we live is called an age of decadence. Among the aspects of its decadence is the fact that our vitality is very weak. There are very few factors keep-ing us alive and very many factors that will, at some point, lead to our deaths. Furthermore, death can be experienced very suddenly and through any number of causes. Thus, it is impor-tant to remember that there is no time to waste. Therefore, the third cause of loss is activity that merely wastes time and is a distraction. The fourth cause of loss is addictive conceptuality and the ensuing afflictions. It is said that the very nature of the mind as it is-the mind in itself-is the dharmakaya. All the qualities of the dharmakaya are spontaneously present within us. They are what we really are. However, not recognizing this, we tend to follow after addictive thoughts and concepts that occur in the mind. We get ensnared by the mental afflictions that they gen-erate, and this prevents our recognition of the mind. The fifth cause of loss is the situation in which we easily grow tired of relying on a teacher and practicing his or her in-structions. It is important to understand that the only possible basis for our attainment of liberation from the intense suffer-ing of samsara is receiving and practicing the special instruc-tions of our lamas. To disregard the value of receiving and prac-ticing such instructions in order to engage in various sorts of meaningless activity is the fifth cause of loss. The sixth cause of loss is the situation in which a practitio-ner impairs or destroys any or all of the three vows. In general, it can be said that the only vessel in which we can cross the ocean of samsaric suffering and reach the realm of great bliss,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Ten Causes of Loss 15 the realm of liberation, the state of buddhahood, is the excel-lent vessel of the three types of vow or commitment. These are: 1) the external vow of individual liberation {pratimoksha vow); 2) the internal vow of bodhicitta (bodhisattva vow)8; and 3) the vajrayana vows or samaya. Allowing these vows to become impaired through intense mental afflictions (klesha) or mere carelessness is a cause of loss. The seventh cause of loss is to discontinue following the in-structions and practice after having gained a slight amount of realization through relying on a spiritual friend or guru. Having had some realization, you may become easily distracted by meaningless activity, abandon the instructions and practice, and thereby inhibit the further growth of experience and realization. The eighth cause of loss is the situation in which, having no genuine realization yourself, but having heard a great deal of the profound speech of the siddhas of the lineage, you repeat their speech to many people in order to attract students and become wealthy, popular, and powerful. You deceive many people by pretending to have realization. This is the eighth cause of loss. The ninth cause of loss is activity that harms other sentient beings. This should be avoided because all sentient beings have been our parents and, as our parents, they have been extremely kind to us. Another reason is that altruistic bodhicitta is the spinal cord of the path to liberation. Losing it is to lose the en-tirety of the path. Therefore, it is necessary to let go of all spite-fulness toward others, and especially all that is actually harm-ful to others. It is important to remember that the generation and flourishing ofbodhicitta depend entirely upon interaction with other sentient beings. Therefore, it is necessary to have all sentient beings as objects of compassion and actually to gener-ate compassion for those beings. The tenth cause of loss is procrastination, and what is lost is body, speech and mind-the three gates. Specifically, when you"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 The Instructions of Gampopa are young and your body is strong, your mind clear, and your speech supple, you do not engage in the practice of Dharma because you feel impelled to engage in mundane activities. While doing so, you think, \"I will practice Dharma when I get older, when things have settled down a bit.\" Then, not having practiced when you were young, you find when you get older that you cannot practice because you do not have the habit of doing so. You are not as strong as you were, it is harder to learn things, and so forth. This type of procrastination is definitely a cause of loss. These are the ten things that are causes of loss."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2 The Ten Necessary Things Gampopa then presents ten things that are necessary in order to practice Dharma. The first of these is a stable commitment to the practice of Dharma in general, and to continuing the spe-cific format of practice you are doing until you finish it. If you do not have this commitment, you will be easily swayed by the opinions, advice, and conversation of others, and you will not get anything done. In order to maintain a strong commitment, you must have a detailed and accurate knowledge of the es-sential points of the practice you are doing. This commitment will arise through considering the previous ten causes of loss. The second thing that is necessary is, through faith and dili-gence, to accomplish the wishes and instructions of your lama. Faith is a delight in practicing and accomplishing the instruc-tions you are given because you recognize the benefits of do-ing so. Diligence is a delight in going through the actual pro-cess of accomplishing these instructions in which you have faith. Through the possession of this strong faith and intense dili-gence you are able actually to put the instructions of your lama into practice. The third thing that is necessary is to put the instructions of your lama into practice faultlessly, with skill and understand-ing. Although the instructions are without defect, the way you"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 The Instructions of Gampopa implement them could be defective. For example, if you attempt to practice secret mantra without having any renunciation for samsara and without having generated any bodhicitta, then although the instructions of secret mantra are profound and faultless, your practice of them will have the defect of being totally ineffective and will not generate any qualities whatso-ever. Therefore, it is important to put Dharma into practice in a skillful way, with an understanding of the correct sequence of practice. The fourth thing that is necessary is to persevere in practice through a correct insight into the meaning of the teachings and a strong confidence in the teachings. This means putting the instructions of the lama into practice without mistaking their meaning and in accordance with the lama's intentions of how they should be practiced. This is where sherab (or prajiia in San-skrit)-which means knowledge-comes in because it is only by means of an inquisitive insight into the meaning of the in-structions you receive that you will be able to practice them properly. Furthermore, this practice must be prolonged until you gen-erate the full extent of qualities that are possessed by your lama and come to the same realization as your lama. You persevere in practice by means of a stable faith or confidence in the value and efficacy of the practice. Thus the fourth thing that is neces-sary is correct perseverance in practice through insight and confidence. The fifth thing that is necessary is to maintain mindfulness, attentiveness, and carefulness. You must be mindful of what conduct to adopt and what to abandon. You must be attentive and aware of the extent to which you are employing mindful-ness. Finally, you must be careful to repair any lapses or devia-tions you may make from mindfulness and attentiveness. If you apply these three qualities, your body, speech, and mind will be unstained by the defects of faulty conduct. If, on the other hand, you lack mindfulness, you will not remember"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Ten Necessary Things 19 what is to be adopted and what is to be abandoned. If you lack attentiveness, nothing in your conduct will allow you to pay attention to what you are doing. Even if you remember what you should be doing, you will not be able to do it because you are lost. If there is no carefulness, when you start to get lost in faulty conduct, you will have no way to bring yourself back because you will not have the habit of paying careful attention to what you are doing. The result of lacking these three quali-ties is that your vows and samaya will be impaired. Therefore, before you meet with the enemies of distraction, you must gird yourself with the armor of mindfulness, attentiveness, and carefulness, so that when you are \"attacked\" you will not be destroyed. The sixth thing that is necessary is also made up of three points: the armor of commitment, courage, and stability in prac-tice. Through the armor of commitment, you do not waiver in your commitment to practice. Through courage, the obstacles and problems that arise during life or during practice do not affect you. You do not allow these obstacles and problems to dissuade you or tum you away from practice. Through your commitment and courage, you build a stability in your prac-tice that is unwavering and devoid of fear, and that prevents you from being pulled away from practice by suddenly arising conditions. If you allow yourself to be turned aside from prac-tice by the slightest little incident, obstruction, or interruption, then you are worse off than any worldly person. People in mun-dane activities have great forbearance when faced with inter-ruptions and obstacles. Thus it is all the more important for people practicing Dharma to show that same commitment and courage. The seventh thing that is necessary is freedom from attach-ment (chag may) and the absence of addiction (zhen may). The Tibetan phrase for this quality means,literally, \"not letting your nose-rope be grabbed by others.\" A nose-rope is used on a cow so it can be led easily. If you are free of any kind of attachment or addiction to specific places and people, to your possessions,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 The Instructions of Gampopa to pleasant experiences of the five senses, or to desirable ob-jects that can be experienced with the five senses, then you are in control of yourself and no one else can control you. How-ever, having attachment to pleasant conditions and particular situations is the same as having a ring through your nose with a rope attached to it and handing the end of the rope to some-one else who can pull you wherever they want you to go. Only by wrapping your nose-rope around your own head and not giving it to someone else can you practice Dharma. The eighth thing that is necessary is that your practice be embraced by threefold excellence. The first of the three excellences is pure motivation in the beginning. At the begin-ning of any session of practice you generate the thought or in-tention that through this practice all sentient beings may be brought to the state of complete buddhahood. The second ex-cellence is that during the main body of the session you main-tain an even placement of the mind in a state free of elabora-tion, free of conceptual reification of the practice. The third ex-cellence is that at the end of the session you seal the practice by the dedication of not only the merit accumulated in that ses-sion but also the merit accumulated by all sentient beings in the three times-past, present, and future. All merit is dedi-cated to the complete liberation and omniscience of all beings. If your practice is embraced by this threefold excellence in the beginning, the middle, and the end, it results in the two-fold accumulation of merit and wisdom. By means of the cor-rect motivation, meditation, and dedication, you gather the accumulation of merit. By means of sealing the entire practice through nonconceptuality that is free of elaboration, you gather the accumulation of wisdom. The ninth thing that is necessary is the firm development of loving-kindness and compassion, through which you benefit others in both direct and indirect ways. Loving-kindness is the desire that all sentient beings possess happiness and the causes of happiness. Through loving-kindness, you engage in the con-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Ten Necessary Things 21 duct that is necessary in the short run to bring direct benefit to beings. For the long run, and as the indirect benefit, you make the aspiration that, through your practice, all sentient beings may come to attain the supreme happiness of the state of buddhahood. Compassion is the desire that all sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. With this motivation you benefit sentient beings directly by freeing them from situations of suffering, and indirectly through the aspira-tion that your practice be a cause of their total liberation from all the sufferings of samsara. The tenth necessary thing is that through the application of knowledge or insight (sherab) you avoid the defect of reification. This consists of, first, the intellectual understanding, and sec-ond, the realization or direct experience, that all the things we experience possess no substantiality and no inherent char-acteristics. The first is understanding that all things we experi-ence are, from their own side, unestablished as anything other than mere experiences-they are mere elaborations or fabrica-tions. The second is the correct full realization that the actual nature or way of abiding of all things is without elaboration, that is, free from being stained by their apparent characteristics. This text is divided into lists of ten, and we have now cov-ered the first two of these. A proper understanding of each set depends on the recollection of the previous set. The meaning of the second set is best found by an examination that is grounded in an understanding of the first set, and what we go through as we continue will be based on understanding what we have gone through previously. For example, if you were to look at one of the later lists of ten, it would not make much sense out of the context of the material that precedes it. There-fore please do not forget these first two sets of ten."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"3 The Ten Things Upon Which to Rely Next I will discuss the ten things on which we must rely in order to generate the qualities associated with Dharma prac-tice, so that the virtues we cultivate in the practice of Dharma will flourish and we will not be hindered or afflicted by any defects. The first thing on which we must rely is a holy guru who possesses both realization and compassion. The lama must possess realization because a teacher who has no realization or actual experience is like a painting of water, which cannot quench our thirst, or a painting of fire, which cannot warm us. As well, the lama must possess compassion. If the lama merely has realization but has no compassion, he or she cannot teach and will not help sentient beings develop virtuous qualities and relinquish defects. Thus the first thing on which we must rely is a lama who possesses both realization and compassion. The second thing on which we must rely is a solitary, pleas-ant, and splendorous place of practice. Having completely re-ceived instructions from the lama described above, we must rely on such an environment in order to put those instructions into actual practice. The environment should have four charac-teristics: First, it must be a place of solitude. We must be some-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Upon Which to Rely 23 what isolated from distractions; otherwise we will not be able to practice at all. Second, it must be pleasant, and this means a place where we are not afflicted by excessive cold or heat or other things that disturb both the mind and body and become obstacles to practice. Third, it should be splendorous, which means a place that has been engulfed by the splendor of the siddhas of the lineage. If possible, it is best to practice in an environment where the great practitioners of the past have prac-ticed. If not, it is sufficient to practice in a solitary and pleasant place. Fourth, the environment should be a wilderness or wild place. The Tibetan term is gompa, which also means monastery. But here it does not mean a formal monastery where there are stupas and where lamas, monks, and nuns are living. It means a place that is a reasonable distance from other habitations and not in the middle of a city where we would be greatly distracted. The third thing on which we must rely is companions who are in harmony with ourselves in view, in conduct, and in strength of attitude. The first characteristic, harmony of view, means that the people with whom we live and practice should be committed to attaining liberation, just as we are. The sec-ond, harmony in conduct, means that our companions and friends also abide by whatever level of external discipline is appropriate, whether that of a fully ordained monk or nun, a novice, or a lay disciple. The third characteristic, having a strong attitude, means that they are free of the paranoia that can cre-ate situations of intense disharmony that conflict with the aims of practice. In other words, we should not be living with people who are constantly thinking, \"He is angry at me. She is jealous of me. I didn't like the way they said that. They're causing prob-lems. I had better get rid of them,\" and so forth. They should not be of a mind-set that creates disharmony. Thus the third thing on which we must rely is companions who possess these three characteristics. If we rely upon such companions, rather than being sources of distraction our companions will help us to attain liberation, and we can help them as well."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 The Instructions of Gampopa The fourth thing is that we must rely on moderation in sus-tenance, having recognized the defects of excessiveness. If we are not moderate in what we require in the way of food, cloth-ing, and so forth, we will go crazy from seeking after these things. Moderation consists of having enough clothing and shelter that we do not freeze or bum, and enough food that we do not starve to death. The point is to use these external condi-tions to sustain ourselves in order to practice. We should avoid worrying a great deal about whether or not things are pleas-ant-for example, the taste of the food we eat. It is recom-mended that we conceive of our sustenance as if it were medi-cine. When you are taking medicine to cure an ailment you do not think, \"I like this medicine. It tastes good, it is sweet. I do not like that medicine; it does not taste very good.\" You take it because it will remove whatever illness you are suffering from. In the same way, you should eat and drink to survive, so that you are able to practice, and not to enjoy the taste of the food. In addition, if you are constantly trying to acquire better food, better clothing, and so forth, the effort of trying to acquire these things creates a great deal of hardship. Then, if you acquire them, they become sources of distraction because your mind is directed toward enjoying them rather than practicing the Dharma. You end up being tormented by attachment. Thus it is important to be careful and mindful in your use of external resources. It was said by the Buddha that if you eat more than you need, it becomes an obstacle to meditation. You begin to feel heavy, and so much of your energy is directed towards the pro-cess of digestion that there is none left for meditation. It is rec-ommended that you fill one third of your stomach with food, fill one third with liquid, and leave one third empty. The point is not to measure the amount of food going in, but simply to be appropriate in your consumption and to keep it regular. The fifth thing is that we must rely impartially on the in-structions of the lineage of siddhas. This means not to be too"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Upon Which to Rely 25 choosy, not to think, \"I have to rely upon this, but I will leave that out. I can forget about that. It doesn't apply to me. I don't need that.\" It means to have an impartial respect and venera-tion for all the authentic instructions that come from the vari-ous lineages of awakened yogis. It is important to receive for-mally the transmission (lung) and the instruction (tri) for what-ever we are studying. However, it is appropriate as well to read texts of profound instruction that we come across. It is good to do so impartially because at this point we do not know what is going to spark realization in us. We do not know yet what kind of instruction we might come across that might click and gen-erate an understanding of the nature of the mind. Therefore, it is important not to reject any authentic instruction that comes our way. The sixth thing is that we must rely on substances, medi-cines, mantras, and various conditions that are beneficial to ourselves and others. Do not develop the attitude, \"I am a yogi of great realization; therefore, I don't need anything. If I get sick I don't need medicine. I don't need to be careful in any kind of external way.\" Since you have not perfected your real-ization, you are somewhat at the mercy of your body, which is composed of the four elements. Therefore, you have to gener-ate the conditions that support the equilibrium and balance of the elements, which brings about good health. You should not reject correct medical treatment and so forth-the various pro-found conditions that are beneficial to your state of health. In the same way you should not reject these things for others. You should not think that there is something shallow or unimpor-tant about benefiting others through giving them medicine, food, and other common things, because all of these are of genu-ine benefit to others if they are appropriately administered. You should not think, \"I am a yogi following the yogic tradition. I can reject science. I can reject medicine. These are worldly things of no lasting meaning.\" Actually, these are things that can be of great benefit and should not be rejected out of hand."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 The Instructions of Gampopa The seventh thing is that we must rely on food that is in accordance with our state of health and constitution, and meth-ods of approach to practice that are in accordance with our ca-pabilities. Concerning food, it is not important whether or not you especially like the food you eat. If a food is sweet and deli-cious yet harmful to your health, you should avoid it. If you find a food distasteful but very beneficial to your health and longevity, you should rely upon it. Concerning the practice of the Dharma, it should be in ac-cordance with your understanding and ability. If someone has a very limited attitude and is terrified of the profound acts and the profound understanding of the bodhisattvas, it is suitable for that person to practice the lesser vehicle, because he or she will naturally be attracted to the peace of liberation and wish to escape the sufferings of samsara. It would be inappropriate for such a person to go directly into the practice of mahayana. In the same way, someone who has reached the point of being able to practice the mahayana, yet who has no faith in or real understanding of the vajrayana or secret mantra, should prac-tice the mahayana, and in particular the sutrayana. The vajrayana teachings are especially profound and can lead to the state of unity, the state of Vajradhara9 in one lifetime, yet this cannot happen to someone who has no faith in them and has no insight into their true meaning. For this reason, although ultimate buddhahood is attained eventually through the prac-tice of secret mantra, the Buddha did not simply teach that one vehicle. He taught all the various stages and methods so that sentient beings of various faculties can be gradually matured to the point where they can practice these ultimate teachings. The eighth thing is that we must rely on meditation tech-niques and modes of conduct that actually help our experience of practice. We should practice in such a way that we are focus-ing our attention on the practice we are actually performing, and not mixing up that practice with other things that are inap-propriate in that context. For example, if you are practicing"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Upon Which to Rely 27 tranquility meditation or shamata, it is important that you con-tinue with the practice until you generate certainty about its benefit and a certain stability of mind, at which point you can go on and practice insight or vipashyana meditation. However, if in the midst of shamata practice you start performing the analysis associated with vipashyana practice, then you destroy your fledgling practice of shamata. You do not get anywhere, because you are not practicing what you set out to practice. In the same way, if you are doing a simple practice that does not rely upon extensive analysis, then while it might seem appro-priate to engage in a complicated analysis, it would not be. If you are engaged in a practice that depends on some analysis, then discarding that analysis and simply resting in a state of simplicity would harm your practice, although it would be ap-propriate in another circumstance. With regard to the mode of conduct, it is important that what you do, your physical position and so forth, be appropriate to the practice you are doing. The most obvious example is that if you are doing the first part of ngondro, the preliminary prac-tices, 10 you do not sit as you would during shamata practice, but you do prostrations and so forth. Furthermore, you recite the refuge prayer while you are doing prostrations-you do not practice shamata. It is important that every aspect of your practice be harmonious and unified. The ninth thing on which to rely is worthy students who have faith and respect, and this is to be relied upon by some-one who, having attained some of the qualities associated with the path, is functioning as a teacher or spiritual friend for oth-ers. When you genuinely start to have these qualities, you have to decide in what situations it is appropriate to teach and how much is appropriate to teach. The decision should not be based on how many people you can possibly get together to teach, and how much you could possibly manage to say to them. You should choose what you say to whom based upon what is ac-tually appropriate and necessary for them."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 The Instructions of Gampopa Generally speaking, students of the Dharma should have the three kinds of faith. The first is the faith of clarity, which is a clear sense of the value of Dharma and therefore a natural, sin-cere delight in it. The second, the faith of desire, is the intense desire to attain the qualities that are possessed by the buddhas and bodhisattvas. The third type of faith is confidence or trust, which is the conviction on the student's part that Dharma is a better way to live and that practice is a worthy way to spend one's time. With regard to respect, students should be able to recognize their own defects and appreciate the qualities of their teacher. Respect in the context of Dharma instruction means that students should regard their teacher in the same way they would regard a doctor, who prescribes the appropriate medi-cine for someone who is suffering from a serious illness. It is important that the teacher abandon two extremes. One is to think, \"I am a yogi who has transcended mundane activ-ity. Therefore, no matter how many qualified students approach me I am not going to tell them anything, because I am beyond such communication with other people.\" If qualified students appear and you are qualified to teach, you should do so. The other extreme is to think, \"I am a yogi with some qualities. Therefore, I should teach whatever I can to everyone I meet.\" The danger of the second extreme is that when you teach people who have no respect for the Dharma, what you teach is wasted because the people are not benefited by it. Not only are they not benefited by the teaching, but because they receive it with-out faith and respect, their lack of respect for Dharma and for their teacher actually grows as time goes on. Thus teaching care-lessly is a very effective way of sending both yourself and oth-ers to the lower realms. The tenth thing on which we must rely is continual mind-fulness and attention throughout the four types of activities. The four types of activities are: eating, going to sleep, walking, and sitting. We should be mindful of what we are doing in all situations, highlighted by these four, and attentive to maintain-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Upon Which to Rely 29 ing this mindfulness. It is particularly important to protect all of our vows, whatever they are, and our samaya. We should regard the protection of vows and samaya the way we would regard the protection of a tremendously important jewel we are keeping. If we knew that outside somewhere there were thieves waiting for a chance to steal this jewel, we would con-stantly be on our guard, watching for the thieves who are try-ing to sneak in and steal the jewel. In the same way, to maintain our discipline we must constantly watch our minds, because the thieves who will steal the jewel of our discipline are the mental afflictions that arise in the mind. When mental afflic-tions take over the mind, they start producing afflicted thoughts and concepts, which lead to acts of wrongdoing. Thus it is es-pecially important to watch the mind at all times. There are both common and uncommon explanations for how to maintain mindfulness and attention throughout the four activities. The common explanation is that when you are eat-ing, eat moderately as was explained before. When you go to sleep, go to sleep with the virtuous intention of getting up the next morning and using all your time for the practice of the Dharma. When you are walking, be careful of stepping on in-sects or harming other sentient beings. When you seat your-self, be careful that you are not sitting on any insects hidden under the cushions, or harming any beings. That is the way the common mindfulness is directed. The uncommon mindfulness of secret mantra is based upon these and includes these, but adds to them other practices: When you are eating, consider your body as the mandala of all the victorious ones, and offer your food to them as feast substances. When you are going to sleep, meditate on the clear light associ-ated with sleep, which may make use of reciting a mantra, rest-ing the mind in a state of nonconceptuality or nonfabrication, and so forth. When you are walking, visualize your root guru above your right shoulder so that you conceive that you are circumambulating him. When you are seated, visualize your"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 The Instructions of Gampopa root guru above your head at all times. The point of both the common and uncommon explanations is to preserve mindful-ness and attention at all times, because these are the ground or basis of all Dharma. These are the ten things that are to be relied upon from the beginning of your practice of Dharma until your attainment of the complete fruition. The first of these, of course, is the correct teacher. The ten things should be relied upon so that you are never without them, the way your body is never separated from its shadow."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"4 The Ten Things to Be Abandoned The next list is the ten things that must be abandoned. The first of these is a teacher or a master all of whose actions are mixed with the eight worldly dharmas.11 Although such teachers may give very profound explanations and be very learned, all they are concerned with and all they direct their actions toward is acquiring possessions for themselves and their retinue, acquir-ing praise, being served, and becoming famous. They are tre-mendously concerned with avoiding the loss of any of their personal possessions, avoiding any kind of criticism, and avoid-ing situations where people will not serve them. They are very much afraid of getting a bad reputation. Although they may look good and speak well, and be learned in the information aspect of Dharma, they have no realization and are not genu-ine teachers. They should therefore be abandoned. The second thing that must be abandoned is \"retinue\" and companions who harm your state of mind and harm your prac-tice. Retinue refers to students, if you are a teacher, and if you are in a position of authority, to those under your authority in either a spiritual or mundane sense. Companions means friends, people you live with, family, and so forth. It is important to stay away from people who present obstacles to your practice and generate mental affliction in you that is of no use. There is"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 The Instructions of Gampopa a traditional saying in the Kagyu lineage, \"Get away from your birthplace.\" This is because in the place of your birth there are usually people to whom you are tremendously attached and people for whom you have tremendous aggression. For this reason yogis have tended to wander about, going to uncertain places where people do not know them. Because no one knows them, there are fewer interruptions to their practice. You may think it is necessary to continue to associate with people you are attached to, but that is not the case. You cannot really help them because if they destroy your practice, they are harming themselves and you, and you end up harming them and your-self as well. The third thing that must be abandoned is places that are either very distracting or dangerous. Even if you have aban-doned your place of birth, if you go somewhere else where there are a lot of mundane things you can do rather than practice, where there are a lot of desirable experiences you can have other than practice, this will be an obstacle to practice. In fact, it is no better than being in your birthplace. On the other hand, even if you are in a place of solitude, it may be a place where there is the danger of not obtaining healthy food and water, or danger from large carnivorous animals or small poisonous animals. In a place where there is danger to life or health you will not be able to practice because you will be afraid and anxious. This fear will prevent you from relaxing, and without a relaxed mind, practice cannot progress. The fourth thing that must be abandoned is sustenance that comes from theft, robbery, deception, or concealment. Theft refers to stealing something in a hidden manner. Robbery re-fers to stealing something through superior force. Deception refers to pretending to have qualities you do not have, that is, getting someone to give you something as an offering by pre-tending to be worthy of offering. Concealment refers to con-cealing defects you do have, again in order to obtain support. These four improper ways of obtaining food and other condi-tions necessary to live as a practitioner must be abandoned."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Be Abandoned 33 As well, you should abandon all sustenance that arises from improper activity on the part of others. Even if people give you something without any kind of wrongdoing on your part, if they stole it or got it through some sort of deception and you know that, then you should not accept it; you should not par-take of it. What should be relied upon is food and support that is ob-tained without wrongdoing, in an honest and direct manner. When you are practicing Dharma it is appropriate to receive gifts, offerings, food, or whatever you need to live on from oth-ers, if others are willing to give them. It is even appropriate to beg for alms, but you should be honest and direct about what you are doing. If you have no food you can say, \"I have no food. Would you giveÂ· me some?\" and if they wish to, they will; but there cannot be any kind of deception. The fifth thing that is to be abandoned is work and activity that harms our state of mind and harms our practice. It is ap-propriate to engage in meritorious work and activity, such as erecting, repairing, or making offerings for monasteries, im-ages of the Buddha, and so forth. Physical activity connected with merit is fine because it actually benefits the mind in the long run. But meaningless activity that distracts us and actu-ally drags the mind downward should be avoided. The sixth thing that should be abandoned is food, conduct, and activity that are harmful to our health. Our physical bod-ies possessing the eight freedoms and the ten resources are ex-tremely precious. They are the basis for our human existence. We should prolong our lives as much as possible so that we can make use of this opportunity to practice the Dharma. It is therefore important to avoid food and activity that will either cause sickness or otherwise put us in danger of untimely death. The seventh thing that must be abandoned is fixation and attachment to desirable things or situations that bind us with our own greed. This means being attached to the acquisition and protection of possessions, amusements, wealth, fame, and so forth. It includes both the feeling that we need these things"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 The Instructions of Gampopa and the anxiety we feel at the danger of their loss, because both are fixations on these things and the experiences associated with them. Our fixation on these conditions means that not only will their presence not help our good qualities increase, but it will also cause them to decrease as time goes on. For this reason it is important to avoid places and people to whom we are unduly attached or on whom we are unduly fixated. The eighth thing that must be abandoned is careless con-duct that is the cause of other people having no faith in the Dharma. This does not mean activities that are directly harm-ful to others, which have already been discussed in earlier lists. It refers to the situation in which practitioners have actual ex-perience, or even some realization of the meaning of Dharma, and therefore have little anxiety as to what other people may think of them. They might be inclined to act a little strangely. But it is not appropriate for practitioners to indulge in display-ing their realization in this manner, because other people, whether they are involved in Dharma practice or not, will see their actions as defects. They will not think, \"These people act odd; they must have realization.\" They will think, \"Even the most serious Dharma practitioners, people who are supposed to have realization, seem to have personal defects,\" and that will cause them not only to despise the practitioners but also to despise the Dharma. This leads other sentient beings to accu-mulate the extremely harmful negative karma of abandoning and reviling the Dharma. Therefore it is important, no matter how high your experience and realizations are, to be externally subdued, disciplined, and proper in your conduct. The ninth thing to be abandoned is activities that are of no benefit to ourselves and others, like running around and sitting around. This means to abandon meaningless journeys -for example, visiting a big ocean or a high mountain just for sightseeing purposes-and to abandon meaningless enter-tainment. These things are a waste of time, and you do not"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Be Abandoned 35 necessarily have much time to waste. Thus, if you determine that a specific activity or action will not be of real benefit to yourself or to anyone else, you should avoid it. The tenth and last thing to be abandoned is concealing our own defects and proclaiming or advertising the defects of oth-ers. It is important not to try to conceal our own defects through stealth, and not to focus on the defects of others, making them clear to everyone. We must always make the aspiration to be as beneficial as possible to others, and we should conduct our-selves in accordance with that aspiration. Our goal is to be able to remove our own faults, not conceal them, and to help others remove their faults, not advertise them. We especially do not wish to become arrogant. The basis for arrogance, and the way to maintain arrogance and cause it to flourish, is to conceal our own defects and expose those of others. The difference between a genuine Dharma practitioner and a worldly person is that the worldly way is to conceal our own defects and advertise those of others, while the Dharmic way is to conceal the de-fects of others and advertise our own. These are the ten things that are to be abandoned."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"5 The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned Next are the ten things not to be abandoned. To begin with, compassion should not be abandoned because it is the very root of any benefit we are able to give to others. The second thing not to be abandoned is appearances. Since appearances are the natural display of the mind, it is unneces-sary to abandon them. lilopa indicated this when he said, \"It is not by appearances that you are fettered, but by fixation on them. So abandon that fixation.\" It is not what you experience that causes confusion, it is your fixation on the experience as being inherently what it appears to be. Therefore only this fixa-tion need be relinquished, not experience itself. The third thing is that thought is not to be abandoned, be-cause it is the play of the ultimate nature or dharmata. As is said in the Kagyu lineage prayer, \"The nature of thought is the dharmakaya.\" If we are capable of looking directly at the es-sence of thought, then whatever thought arises is self-liberated. If we can put this into practice, there is no need to try and re-move thoughts or abandon them in any way. The fourth thing not to be abandoned applies primarily to those with realization. Mental afflictions are the indication of wisdom and therefore need not be abandoned. The presence in"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 37 our experience of stupidity, aversion, pride, desire, and jeal-ousy indicates the presence in our continuum of the wisdom of the dharmadhatu, the mirror-like wisdom, the wisdom of equa-nimity, the discriminating wisdom, and the wisdom of activity. Since the mental afflictions are merely the display of the wis-doms that are their essence, someone who has the realization to experience this directly need not abandon them. It is important to analyze this statement because it might seem very strange on the face of it. Just a few minutes ago you were told that you must definitely abandon mental afflictions, and now you are being told you do not have to abandon them. This is not a contradiction, but a demonstration of the differ-ence in the maturity of practitioners at various levels of the teachings. The approach for beginners, in which it is necessary to abandon mental afflictions, is like the need for stairs. Some-one who does not have wings and who wishes to get to the second story must walk up a set of stairs. The process of walk-ing up stairs is like the process of subduing the mental afflic-tions. Someone who has wings like a bird does not need to use stairs but can fly directly up to the second story. Having wings corresponds to having the realization to be able to implement the profound wisdom of secret mantra. Thus, these two pieces of advice are not contradictory but are directed toward indi-viduals at different levels of practice. The fifth point in this section is in the same category as the fourth. The desirable objects that appear to the five senses are not to be abandoned because they are the water and manure of experience and realization. For a practitioner with some real-ization and some strong experience, there is no coarse fixation on his or her imputed inherent existence. There is no coarse ego-clinging, and in the absence of that, there is no feeling or inherent concept of ownership. For such yogis and yoginis, no matter how many things surround them, no matter how much wealth or prosperity they experience, they do not have a feel-ing of identification with or ownership of these things. It is just as though there were beautiful wild animals wandering around"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 The Instructions of Gampopa them. If we see wild animals, we do not feel, \"That's my tiger,\" or, \"That's my deer.\" We can appreciate them, but there is no fixation on them. For example, when Jetsun Milarepa was offered some very hearty nutritious food, it was of great benefit and enhanced his realization tremendously, but he did not develop any attach-ment to the taste of it. It was not a question of indulging his desire, it was a question of strengthening his body. In the same way, advanced practitioners can use food and drink as feast substances. There are, as well, practices in which the clothing they wear is consecrated as the armor of mantra. These are prac-tices that are suitable for advanced practitioners with some di-rect experience. It is important to understand that different pieces of advice in this text are offered to practitioners at differ-ent levels. The sixth thing that is not to be abandoned is sickness, suf-fering, and pain, because they are excellent teachers. When we become distracted and engage in wrongdoing, or when we are simply not mindful, or not experiencing stable renunciation, sometimes a little bit of suffering can remind us very directly and effectively of what is to be avoided, what is to be renounced, and what suffering really is. For example, if we experience a certain amount of physical difficulty as a human being, then we might consider how much more unpleasant it would be to be reborn in the lower realms, where the sufferings are much worse. That might inspire us to try to avoid rebirth in the lower realms. Therefore, such difficult situations need not be avoided, because at times they can be very helpful. According to Shantideva, our experiences of suffering can be of benefit because they sadden us, and the sadness brings us back in on ourselves and cuts through our pride. Through the loss of our coarse arrogance we are able to experience genu-ine compassion for others. We think, \"If I am suffering this much, if it's this unpleasant, how must it be for others?\" and we come to appreciate the suffering of others. This leads us to"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 39 avoid wrongdoing and that which is harmful to ourselves and to others, and leads to a natural delight in that which is virtu-ous. Thus there is some benefit to such experiences. The seventh thing that is not to be abandoned is enemies and obstructers, because they naturally exhort us to practice. From the mahayana point of view, the basis of our attainment of buddhahood, our realization of the ultimate nature, is the cultivation of such qualities as patience. The only possible way we can cultivate the virtue of patience is through situations in which we are dealing with some misfortune or actual aggres-sion. For that reason, people who are aggressive to us are our assistants in practice, and since they arise naturally they are said to be the natural exhortation to practice. They are also the exhortation that leads us to the realization of the true nature of all things, which is buddhahood. However, if enemies and obstructers disappear spontane-ously, it is a sign of attainment (siddhi) and you do not have to reject that result. H unpleasant situations disappear even though you make no special effort to remove them, you do not have to try to get them back again. If you have merit and attainment, in many instances this will cause situations in which others are aggressive to you to be pacified naturally. When that happens, you do not have to think something has gone wrong. For ex-ample, when the king attempted to killAcharya Nagarjuna with a variety of swords by hacking away at his neck, the king was not able to hurt Nagarjuna because Nagarjuna did not have the karma to be hurt. In the same way, someone with realiza-tion will not naturally find many enemies and obstructions, and that is a sign of siddhi; it is a sign of attainment. Just be-cause the presence of enemies may not always be bad, this does not mean that the lack of enemies is necessarily bad. The eighth thing not to be abandoned is methodical, step-by-step progress in our study and practice, because this is what raises us to the height of definitive understanding. We should not think that a gradual progress through the various stages or"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 The Instructions of Gampopa vehicles of practice is to be abandoned because it may not seem to be the final meaning of the Buddha's teachings. Such think-ing is incorrect. All of the great scholars and siddhas of the past became learned in all of the various stages and vehicles of the Buddha's teachings, and on the basis of that, finally arrived at the definitive understanding associated with the vajrayana. For our own development we must practice in a way that will gradually ripen or mature our insight into the meaning of Dharma. There are many stages to this and they should all be cultivated. As well, we should not abandon or revile the vari-ous presentations of Dharma that are made in different styles or at different levels, because these are all appropriate for the needs and dispositions of different beings. The ninth thing not to be abandoned is the various Dharma practices involving physical activity, because these are genu-ine practices that mature the mind and are beneficial. This means not to abandon prostrations, circumambulation, and other external practices of Dharma because these actually do benefit us; they actually do bring results. The tenth thing not to be abandoned is the intention to ben-efit others, even when you do not have much ability to benefit them directly right now. Often, when people begin to practice they think, \"What is the benefit of saying, 'I am doing this prac-tice in order to benefit others. I will benefit others in the future in such and such ways?' Since I am not actually doing any-thing that benefits others right now, what meaning is there? I cannot do anything that will help anyone.\" In fact, there is the same potential for this altruistic attitude to produce the actual results as there is for a seed to produce a flower. If you say there is no benefit in altruism, then it is like saying a seed will not produce a flower. Just as altruism in itself is not a benefit to others, a seed is not a flower. A seed is not even a sprout. Nev-ertheless, without a seed there is no possibility of having the sprout and leaves and flower, so it is important to begin with the attitude and intention that you will be of great, vast benefit to others."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 41 At the beginning of the path no one can perform the vast acts of a bodhisattva. When the Buddha first generated the in-tention to attain supreme enlightenment he was unable to do much to help others. As time went on, though, he became ex-traordinarily capable of helping others. Nowadays, people have a great deal of doubt about this. When instruction is given in such matters as bodhicitta, people commonly say, \"What pos-sible use is this? I can't do anything.\" It is important not to abandon altruism merely because you do not seem to be able to do so much now. These are the ten things not to be abandoned. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q: I have a question about the common and uncommon forms of mindfulness. Do these apply to the beginning, when we start to eat, start to fall asleep, or start to walk, or through the whole process of walking or eating? Are they for beginning points or continuous? A: Whether you practice the common or uncommon ways of developing mindfulness, it should be as continuous as possible. Of course, because you engage in a variety of activities, it is not possible to remain continuously absorbed in one particular contemplation or one particular meditation. However, you should do it at the beginning of any activity, and then do it whenever it comes to mind as the activity continues, whether it is eating, walking, or other activity. The more continuous it is, the better. It is not the case that you simply generate the visualization or contemplation at the beginning and then for-get it. Q: I am not sure I understand the three types of faith. I believe the first type was the faith of clarity and the second type was the faith of desire. Does that mean the desire to become en-lightened, or is there more to it than that?"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 The Instructions of Gampopa A: Yes, that is right. There might be some confusion about the term \"desire.\" This type of faith, the faith of desire, is recogniz-ing the value of obtaining liberation and omniscience or buddhahood. The thought, \"I really want to attain that state, and therefore I will do whatever is necessary to attain it,\" is different from conventional or mundane desire, in which we want pleasant experiences of all kinds. The faith of desire is not based on a mistake or a misconception; it is based on wanting that which is actually worthwhile. Although the manner of thought is in a sense parallel to conventional desire, the object is completely different. Q: Of the ten things to be abandoned, the eighth one was aban-doning activities that cause loss of faith in the Dharma. Could you clarify whether that refers to our own loss of faith in Dharma or others' loss of faith in the Dharma through seeing our actions? A: The point of the eighth of the ten things to be abandoned is to abandon bizarre conduct that causes other people to have disrespect for the Dharma. This can arise when you have some kind of experience in the practice that leads you to feel an urge to act in an odd way. In that case it will harm you because it will be misleading, and it will harm others. Or you might have some degree of realization that leads to acting in an odd way. This may not harm you but it might harm other people, be-cause other people cannot see your realization; they can only see what you are doing. H you do things that appear odd or strange or improper to them, they will assume that there is something wrong with you, and, since you are supposed to be an exemplary practitioner, that there is something wrong with the instructions or the path that has led you to behave in such a way. You are causing sentient beings to have disrespect for the Dharma, which turns them away from Dharma and is a tre-mendous source of bad karma for them. The responsibility of someone with realization is to hold and foster the Buddha-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 43 dharma, to cause it to flourish, and to be a teacher and example to others. If you act in such a way that you cannot do that, then you are not upholding your responsibilities. Q: I wonder if you could give some examples. A: I can give an example of myself. I am always talking about how important loving-kindness and compassion are, but I eat meat all day long. Q: You have commented on many powerful points made by Gampopa in this text. Is it possible or necessary for us to put all these points into practice? A: First of all, Gampopa gives a variety of instructions and raises a large number of points in this text because the entire text is not intended for one person. It contains methods and instruc-tions designed to guide individuals from the beginning of their path until they reach the state of full buddhahood. It also con-tains instructions designed for different types of individuals. You have to make a distinction between studying the text and putting it into practice. In the context of study and analysis of the text, it should be done in its entirety-reading the text through from beginning to end and coming to a definitive un-derstanding of it as a cohesive work. On the other hand, when you put it into practice, you select portions of it as personal advice that are appropriate to your own situation. In the context of practice, it is not important to go through the whole text from beginning to end and remember each and every thing in it. Q: In the first list, the ten causes of loss, the term \"meaning-less\" was used in terms of meaningless activity and meaning-less distractions. Does this mean that many of the things we do should be avoided, such as watching TV, listening to music, or taking a nap? Is that what is termed \"meaningless activity\"?"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 The Instructions of Gampopa A: From a conventional, mundane point of view, of course, when you are very tired from work and all the kinds of activities that you have no choice but to perform, you might need to relax. Normally, in the world, we do not consider it a waste of time to see a performance of some kind or just relax and take a nap. The issue here is that we do not have much time to practice, and we do not want to waste what little time we have. It would definitely be meaningless activity, a cause of loss or waste, if having committed yourself to spending a certain amount of time every day on Dharma practice, you did not do that, but instead used the time to relax and goof off. Q: The question that I have relates to developing courage and confidence in the practice of Dharma in the face of obstacles. I am a householder with a child, and I am working. I tend to have the habitual pattern of not being able to practice every day at the same time. I know that consistent practice is impor-tant. Contemplating the four thoughts as is done at the begin-ning of ngondro practice, I should be sensitized to the fact that this is a precious human life, that life is impermanent, that the law of karma is true, and that we should not attach ourselves to the pleasures of the mundane world. Yet, still being driven by habitual patterns, it is hard to have time to do formal prac-tice. What is the best way to work with this and become a stron-ger practitioner? A: To one extent or another everyone has to deal with this situ-ation. The main thing in working with this is, as I said earlier, not letting anyone get hold of your nose rope, which means to be in control of your own direction and your own decisions. Someone who has complete conviction about these four thoughts that tum the mind will not have any trouble practic-ing Dharma. If you find that, although you understand them, you cannot seem to practice because things always get in the way, it indicates that either you do not completely trust them or you are afflicted by hopes and fears. Even though we have"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 45 studied impermanence and we have studied the defects of samsara, we tend inside really to hope we will not die for a long time, and that gives a feeling of some room, some time to wait for practice. Although we have studied the defects of samsara, inside we really doubt whether it is so bad, and doubt makes it easy to defer practice. If someone has complete con-viction about the validity of the four thoughts that tum the mind, he or she will not have any trouble practicing. The fact that you have access to the Dharma and that you are involved in these practices indicates that you have accu-mulated a lot of merit in the past, which means that you have a store of merit on which to build the habit of Dharma practice, and that will counteract the habit of not practicing. Thinking of Dharma at all, thinking of such things as the four thoughts that tum the mind, thinking, \"I have to find time to practice,\" indi-cates a previous habit of Dharma practice. That is something you can trust in yourself and it is something you can build on. As far as actual practice, the main thing to be practiced is ngondro, which we call preliminaries. Actually the term ngondro is somewhat misleading because it implies that these are sort of minor preliminary things to be gotten out of the way so you can get on to the real stuff. Usually people have the idea that after they finish ngondro there is going to be something else much better, much more effective, and certainly much more interesting. But this is incorrect, because the topics brought up and the techniques presented in the ngondro are the essence of all Dharma-they are not really preliminaries at all. In particu-lar, going for refuge and generating bodhicitta are the basis and essence of the entire practice of Dharma. Bodhicitta is the removal of obscurations. Bodhicitta is the attainment of enlightenment. The further practices as well are extremely central. Vajrasattva practice is the removal of obscurations, the various habitual patterns and confusion that obstruct the practice of Dharma and are the whole reason for which we have to prac-tice in the first place. The accumulation of merit through the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 The Instructions of Gampopa mandala offering leads directly to the relinquishment of ego-clinging, the false imputation of an inherently existent self, and this is what Dharma is all about. Finally, the guru yoga is the ultimate and final way to perfect all qualities and remove all defects. The essence of Dharma is the realization that your mind, in its nature, has always been and will always be the dharma-kaya itself, and it is guru yoga that sparks this type of experi-ence and realization. If you understand the efficacy, centrality, and profundity of ngondro, you will have delight in it and respect for it, and there-fore you will be able to practice it as much as possible. Now, if you have a lot of responsibilities-for example, you have to work, you have a home, a child to take care of, and so forth-your time is more limited than that of someone with no respon-sibilities. But no matter how many responsibilities you have, if you really want to practice, you will definitely find at least some time for it, and the desire to practice leads to the creation of opportunities to do so. Otherwise, if there is not a strong, in-tense desire to practice as soon as possible, you find yourself procrastinating. The cause of procrastination is simply a lack of motivation, and the way to overcome the habit of procrasti-nation is to practice. The more you practice, the more you will want to practice, and you create a habit that snowballs, that reinforces itself. Thus, the best thing for you to do is keep on practicing, keep on going, and that itself is the solution to the problem of not being able to practice. There is no other solu-tion needed. The more you practice, the more you will benefit not only yourself, but everyone who comes in contact with you, especially your children and those who live with you. Q: You said that we do not have to abandon our enemy be-cause he might teach us patience. Suppose a man has a wife who will not let him study Buddhism or associate with the la-mas or teachers, and will not let him teach his children about Buddhism because she and everyone else around him are"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 47 Christians. Should this man abandon his enemy the way the Tibetans had to leave Tibet after the Chinese invasion, or should he practice Buddhism quietly and patiently in his home and not speak to his children about Buddhism until, perhaps in the future, the chance arises that he can do so? A: I cannot definitely say what such a person should do. If that person can be patient with whatever he is subjected to by his wife, that is the best thing, because patience is the most effec-tive way of increasing our own personal qualities. On the other hand, if he cannot be patient with the situation and it is certain to lead to aggression on his own part, and is certain to lead to problems, then it would be difficult to say that it is particularly good. The specific details of such a situation are very impor-tant, so I cannot say in general whether he should stay or he should leave. It varies in each case. In fact, there are two pieces of advice in this text that come into play here and they may at first seem contradictory. One says do not abandon your enemies because they help you de-velop patience. The other one says abandon harmful compan-ions because they obstruct Dharma. This is not a contradiction. Someone who is able to be patient with the aggression of oth-ers, especially in situations where it cannot be avoided, can use the aggression of others to further the practice of patience. If the aggression is too strong to be patient with and it impedes your practice of Dharma completely, then it is appropriate to remove yourself from such a situation. As for the situation of the Tibetan refugees, many left dur-ing the invasion in order to be able to practice Dharma else-where, while some left simply to flee for their lives. In general, since that time, they have engaged in activities that correspond to their reason for leaving. Those who left in order to be able to practice Dharma have been practicing a lot of Dharma, and those who left simply to survive have done their best to sur-vive and get rich if possible."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 The Instructions of Gampopa That is the general situation. As for what a specific person should do in the typE of situation you describe, I cannot really say off hand. Q: Does stable commitment mean that when I am practicing Hevajra I can never shift to Kalachakra? If I am chanting one mantra, how many times should I chant it before I shift to an-other one? A: This depends upon the individual. Someone who has confi-dence or full knowledge and recognition that all deities em-body the complete qualities and power of buddhahood need only practice one deity. It does not particularly matter which one it is, as long as it is a deity in which he or she has complete certainty. Someone who does not have that understanding, but sees things in a conceptual way and thinks that we need to practice one deity for attaining wealth, one deity for attaining enlightenment, one deity for forceful activity, one deity for paci-fication, and so forth, will have to practice different deities to attain these respective results. Someone who has the profound understanding that they are all the same will, by realizing one deity, realize all of them. Q: I am asking this question for a friend who is practicing Pure Land Buddhism. He asks if there are any special methods in vajrayana leading to rebirth in DewachenP and exactly how many times we should chant the specific mantra to insure re-birth in Dewachen? A: There is a difference between the sutra and the tantric pre-sentations of Amitabha practice in the methods that are applied. The root of them both and the intention of them both is the same--obtaining rebirth in Dewachen, the pure land. The main difference is that in the context of sutra practice we consider ourselves as ordinary beings and we maintain our ordinary conception of the body, speech, and mind. We recognize the presence of Amitabha in the midst of his pure realm and we"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 49 supplicate him. This is somewhat like someone who is in prison supplicating a powerful individual outside to do everything possible to get him or her out of prison. That is basically the sutra approach. In the tantric approach, the supplication to Amitabha is ex-actly the same, but instead of just bringing to mind the fact that Amitabha is there in Dewachen, we actually visualize the realm of Dewachen, including Amitabha, in front of us as though he were actually present in our experience. Also, we do not con-sider ourselves to be ordinary, but we consecrate our body as a deity, our speech as mantra, and so forth. Continuing with the above analogy, it is as though in order to become free from our imprisonment, we not only appeal to someone outside who can release us from prison, but we also develop the power in ourselves that enables us to break out. The reason for this difference in approach is the view. One aspect of the view of vajrayana is that all of the bodies and realms of buddhas such as Amitabha are spontaneously present in our minds already. We can experience them externally only because of their spontaneous presence within us, and this type of liberation can occur through the meeting of the internal and external conditions. For example, the sun is something physi-cally external to us, but to see sunlight we must have eyes, and our eyes must be open. In the same way, liberation into the realm of Sukhavati is considered from the vajrayana point of view to be accomplished through the interdependence of ex-ternal and internal conditions. As far as the recitation of man-tras, there are different mantras used in different practices as-sociated with this cycle. It would not really be possible to say that we have to recite a particular number in order to attain rebirth in Dewachen. Q: How do we know we are suitable for mahayana or vajrayana practice? Is the vajrayana practice very dangerous? If we break the vows will we to fall into vajra hell?"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 The Instructions of Gampopa A: In general, people meet the type of teachers, among those who teach the different vehicles, that accord with their own disposition and the extent of their own merit. As for what it is appropriate for individuals to practice among the various ve-hicles, they should practice what those teachers to whom they naturally become connected emphasize, and they should teach what is in accord with their own confidence and their own in-sight into the Dharma. This is not only true with respect to the mahayana and vajrayana, it is true with all levels of Buddhist teachings-hinayana, mahayana, vajrayana, and so forth. Ba-sically, you should practice what you can, what naturally ap-peals to you, and what your inclination is toward. The main thing is your interest and confidence in the teachings, so you should practice whatever teachings you have the most confi-dence in. As for the danger of vajrayana, it is true that vajrayana has great efficacy and can also be dangerous. The vajrayana pre-sents a path for people with great insight who are able to be very careful and methodical in their practice. It presents a path by which such persons can, using the excellent methods of vajrayana, attain awakening in a very effective manner. It is true that if someone does not have this kind of insight, is not diligent, and especially lacks faith and devotion, she or he might violate the samaya, the commitments of vajrayana. Practically speaking, though, we must make a distinction between two types of empowerment, since it is at empower-ment that samaya are taken on. We can distinguish between an empowerment that is a blessing and what is called the ultimate or actual empowerment. Through faith and interest in a lama, you may receive from him or her a blessing empowerment that involves various substances, vases, and so forth being placed on your head and mantras recited to you. The function of this is to plant a seed for your future liberation, based upon the empowerment process and your own openness or faith in it. Such processes and methods are a special characteristic and quality of vajrayana and are very beneficial for the individuals"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 51 involved. We must distinguish between that and the ultimate empowerment, in which a student, at the time of receiving the empowerment, generates the wisdom associated with the em-powerment through a complete understanding of everything that is occurring. If someone were to receive the ultimate em-powerment and then not make any use of it and not practice, but just be involved in mundane activities and turn his or her back on Dharma, then such a person could certainly break samaya. There is, of course, still samaya with the empowerment as blessing, the common form of empowerment. However, when people take these empowerments, by and large they do not understand everything about what is going on. They do not understand exactly what is to be practiced and what is to be rejected, and they are just committing themselves perhaps to reciting the mantra, visualizing the deity, and so forth. Practi-cally speaking, it is unlikely that people in such situations will harm themselves with vajrayana. Q: Could you explain the difference between an ordinary vow andsamaya? A: Vow, or dompa in Tibetan, and samaya, or damtsig, are basi-cally different terms for much the same thing. Generally speak-ing, the term dompa, which is usually translated as vow, is used in discussions of sutra, and the term damtsig or samaya is used in the context of tantra. The term dompa means \"that which binds,\" in the sense of protecting us from the loss or impair-ment of the qualities of the path that we have acquired, and protecting us from the entrance of obstacles from the outside-so it keeps in and it keeps out. A metaphor for this is a belt. The function of binding yourself with a belt is to prevent you from losing your clothing. For example, if you think of the belt that holds a chuba shut, it prevents the chuba from falling open and whatever you are holding in the chuba from falling out; but it also protects your body from the wind and sun and so forth by"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 The Instructions of Gampopa holding the chuba closed. Vows or dompa are like that. They bind, and by binding, they protect. This term is basically one that is used in the sutras or is common to both sutra and tantra. The term used most often in tantra is damtsig, which literally means \"binding word\" or \"command.\" The analogy here is the command of a king, the disobeying of which would mean cer-tain death. The emphasis here is on the danger of ignoring the prescriptions and proscriptions of samaya, but the danger does not come from the fear of punishment as it does with a king, but because samaya is a natural expression of the quality of the vajrayana Dharma. It is not an arbitrary command imposed on us; it is simply the rules that must be followed for the qualities not to turn into defects. For example, if you are traveling in an automobile there are certain rules you must follow to avoid killing yourself. If you are traveling in an airplane there are more rules because the qualities and the efficacy of the vehicle are greater. If you jump out of an airplane you are dead, and if you jump out of vajrayana, you are in vajra hell. The strictness or the ferocity of the samaya is directly proportional to the quali-ties of the vajrayana. Q: The tenth point under the ten things that are necessary to practice Dharma was the application of insight or knowl-edge that does not have the \"defect of reification.\" I do notre-ally understand what the defect of reification means, and I would be interested in knowing more about what we can do to avoid it. A: First of all, the root text from which this explanation is de-rived has the statement, \"It is necessary that our view of all things not stray into reification or the false imputation of solid-ity and inherently present characteristics; and we avoid this by means of knowledge, understanding, and realization.\" This means that with respect to everything we experience, we must transcend ego-clinging, or more precisely, the false imputation"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Ten Things Not to Be Abandoned 53 of an inherently existent self and the false imputation of solid-ity or reality to our experiences. This is true not only with things in general, but also with our attitude toward Dharma and Dharma practice. When we are meditating on a deity, if we fix-ate on the solidity of that meditation and regard the deity as something with an external physical existence, a flesh and blood body that looks like that particular deity, then there is a mis-take. That view will not lead to realization. If there is a fixation on the characteristics or form of the deity as being anything other than an expression of the wisdom that the deity embod-ies, it will not lead to the realization to which the practice should lead. It is the same when we are considering pure realms. If we think that a buddha realm is something that exists in a specific place and is made of solid objects with such and such form, like the world we experience, if we fixate on an imputed solid-ity and imputed characteristics of that realm, this will not lead to liberation into that realm because it simply perpetuates our ordinary manner of experience. It is said that the form of the deity, and therefore the form of the realm of that deity, is a body of light the essence of which is wisdom. Light here does not mean physical light; it means a presence that is totally insubstantial. The deity having an es-sence of wisdom means that the form is merely the embodi-ment of the wisdom, efficacy, and activity for the benefit of be-ings that is the deity. Therefore, it is said that the form of the deity is like rays of rainbow light, and the essence of the deity is wisdom itself. Ultimately, however, this statement refers to the fact that our final understanding must be the realization of emptiness that is totally without any kind of elaboration, any kind of realizer and realization, any kind of intellectual atti-tude or position whatsoever. Thus the final point is to tran-scend conceptual mind."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"6 The Ten Things to Be Known Next comes the ten things that are to be known or understood. Whereas the previous set of \"things not to be abandoned\" have to be put into practice, these are things that merely have to be understood. The first thing to understand is that external appearances are the manifestation of our confusion. We should recognize that the way we experience the world is without any inherent validity or inherent truth. The way we experience the world is based on ego-clinging, the false imputation of an inherently existent self. We therefore impute a truth or reality to our expe-rience of the world that is equally false, because the way we experience things is simply the display of our minds. If we rec-ognize that, our experiences are self-liberating. There is no fixa-tion on what we experience. The way we experience the world is like seeing the reflection of the moon in a body of water. It is no more valid to say that what we experience has objective re-ality than it is valid to say that the reflection of the moon is another moon-that there is one moon in the sky and another in the water. This is valid to the degree that it is an experience, but it is not the moon itself; it is a reflection of the moon. We experience things the way we do because of our habits, because of the influence of our past actions. Recognizing this is"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Be Known 55 called recognizing the hidden evil or deception in the way we experience appearances. To illustrate the difference between rec-ognizing this and not, suppose someone says that outside of this country, beyond a certain range of mountains, there is a magnificent realm full of delightful things. If you have not seen it, you cannot possibly conceive of it because you have no per-sonal experience of it. It is just something you have heard. You might believe it or you might not, but you really have no de-finitive idea of it. Someone who has been there would know. In the same way, when you recognize the fact that the way you experience the world has no inherent validity beyond simply being your experience, then your fixation diminishes. The second point is that, since the mind in itself (which is considered to be internal, as opposed to external appearances) has no inherent existence, it should be known to be empty. By recognizing the emptiness or lack of inherent existence of the mind, three types of fixations can be dispelled. These are fixa-tion on the mind as a self, fixation on the mind as something real, and fixation on the mind as something solid. The third point is that thoughts arise merely from the com-ing together of a variety of conditions, and should therefore be recognized as being adventitious, which means suddenly ap-pearing and disappearing and not inherent to the nature of the mind. This recognition is important, because if we believe that thoughts are real and solid, then the fixation on thoughts pro-duced by that misconception leads to the accumulation of karma through the power of the thoughts. The fourth thing to be understood is that this body and speech that are produced from the elements are composite things. They are not unitary things and therefore they are im-permanent. By recognizing the impermanence and composite nature of our body and speech, the tendency to fixate on them as permanent and solid things is dispelled. The fifth thing to be known is that all of the various experi-ences of pleasure and suffering that are undergone by the various types of sentient beings arise from karma, from the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 The Instructions of Gampopa previous actions of those particular beings. Therefore, it should be understood that the results of actions are infallible-what you do will have a certain result that will be experienced by you. What you experience is definitely a result of your own previous actions. The sixth point is that suffering and sickness are a cause of stable renunciation for a practitioner of Dharma, and therefore should be understood to be a kind and valuable teacher. First of all, the experience of sickness and suffering by a practitioner is a cause of his or her future happiness, because this experi-ence of suffering, if it is undergone with awareness, will ex-haust the karma that produced it. If this sickness were not ex-perienced now, and the karma ripened later, it would ripen as a much more intense experience of suffering lasting for a much longer period of time. Furthermore, sickness and suffering ex-hort the practitioner to renunciation because they show that there is negative karma. Therefore, as a practitioner, you should rejoice in the present experience of suffering, and also use it to further your renunciation by recognizing that it means you still have karma that could lead to tremendous future suffering. The seventh point is that since attachment to pleasure and happiness is the root of samsara, we should know this attach-ment to be the devaputra-mara, or lhai bu'i du in Tibetan-the demon that is the child of the godsP The experiences of the three realms of samsara14 arise from clinging to or fixating on the experience of pleasure and trying to acquire it. Intoxication with this experience of pleasure is the cause of the sufferings of samsara. Therefore this type of experience should be recognized as the devaputra-mara. The eighth point is that since distractions and entertainments are impediments to the accumulation of merit, they should be understood to be obstacles to the practice of Dharma. If we devote our time to meaningless distractions and entertainments, this is a form of procrastination in our practice. It interrupts our practice so that it takes a much longer time to get anything"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Be Known 57 done. This steals away our accumulation of merit, and there-fore should be understood to be something we must avoid. The ninth thing to understand is that the obstacles to prac-tice that come about through suddenly arising circumstances or conditions, such as aggressive action by others, sickness, and so forth, are exhortations to the cultivation of virtue. There-fore, those enemies and obstructers should be known to be our teachers, our lamas. As was said before, if we can meet adverse conditions with the further development of love and compas-sion for others-specifically, with the attitude that \"whatever sufferings similar to mine other sentient beings have to go through, may only I have to go through them\"-then the ad-verse conditions actually foster the practice of Dharma. In par-ticular, when other people are being aggressive to you, from their point of view it may seem to be aggression. But if you look at its ultimate effect on you as a practitioner, it is a little like someone saying to you, \"If you don't get out of samsara, this is the kind of stuff you will have to deal with again and again.\" It is an exhortation to renunciation and an exhortation to practice. Thus from your own point of view, from their ulti-mate effect on you, aggressive people are really your teachers. The tenth point is that since all things have no inherent na-ture, we should know that all things, without any exception whatsoever, are in their nature the same, and that their nature is that sameness. Ordinarily, in the experience of people with-out the realization of the ultimate nature, there is a great deal of difference between things, on the one hand, which are dis-tinct from each other, and, on the other hand, the nature of all things, which is the same. This nature is the lack of an essence to their characteristics. However, when this nature itself is rec-ognized, it is seen that there is no difference between things and their nature. The conventional and the absolute are the same, because any thing is the expression of its nature, and the nature of every thing is the same. Therefore, since every thing expresses the same nature, every thing in its nature is the same."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"58 The Instructions of Gampopa That is what is to be understood here. This tenth thing to be understood is primarily directed toward experienced practi-tioners who have some realization, and for them it is some-thing not merely to be understood but to be practiced and real-ized. For beginners, it is something to be understood as a con-cept or an idea. These are the ten things to be known or understood. The understanding of such things that is arrived at through infer-ential reasoning, in the context of study and reflection, is quite different from the direct realization of their meaning, which can only come through meditation practice. Understanding alone is not a sufficient basis for moral decisions, for deciding what to accept and what to abandon. We should know the dif-ference between a conceptual recognition and a definitive at-tainment of realization."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"7 The Ten Things to Be Practiced The previous list was ten things to be known, and next come ten things we should actually practice. The first is, having en-tered into the door of Dharma, do not engage in the herd-like behavior of meaningless human activity, but practice Dharma properly. Once we have begun the practice of Dharma, it is important to rely upon the appropriate conditions that will support our beginning practice of Dharma, such as staying in a solitary environment where practice is possible, and surround-ing ourselves with companions who will help us. We must not allow ourselves to be drawn into a lot of meaningless and dis-tracting activities. This can happen very easily in the begin-ning, and it prevents us from making full use of our entrance into Dharma practice. It is important, from the very beginning of our practice until the day of our death, to make full use of the opportunity of Dharma by providing ourselves with con-ditions that support the practice, such as environment, com-panions, and so forth. The second thing to be practiced is, having abandoned your birthplace, do not establish yourself too firmly in any one place. In other words, practice without attachment. As was said be-fore, it is important to abandon your birthplace, the place to"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 The Instructions of Gampopa which you are most attached, with the correct aspiration of wishing to transcend the attachment of samsara. You might leave the place of your birth, but if you do not give up attach-ment, you will recreate the attachments associated with your birthplace in some other place. You will identify with a specific environment and settle into it, and that is no better than being attached to your birthplace. It is important, no matter where you are, to preserve a lack of attachment. The third thing to be practiced is, relying upon an authentic guru, abandon arrogance, and practice in accordance with his or her command. In relying upon a teacher, you must respect the validity of his or her teachings and instructions, and not have the kind of arrogant attitude that makes you think inside that you know better. It is said that qualities cannot come to rest on the hard iron ball of arrogance. People often have the attitude that, \"My teachers know a lot about Dharma, but I would not take their advice about mundane things. When it comes to really serious decisions, I do not trust them so much.\" If you have such a strong distrust of your gurus, which comes from a kind of arrogance, there is no possibility of your gener-ating their qualities and developing the kind of compassion they embody. The fourth thing to be practiced is, having trained your mind through hearing and contemplation, or through study and analysis, do not just be involved in talking about it, but actu-ally put what you have understood into practice. Receiving instructions or coming to an understanding and merely repeat-ing it to others will not do you any good. All it does is create echoes. When you are hungry and you have food, you will only relieve your hunger to the extent that you actually eat. The whole point of having food is for it to be consumed in order to relieve someone' s hunger. In the same way, you must actually put into practice and make use of any instruction you receive and anything you come to understand through analysis. The fifth thing to be practiced is that if experience or realiza-tion is generated in your mental continuum, do not be satisfied"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Be Practiced 61 with that, but continue practicing without distraction. It is of-ten possible to have some kind of experience or slight realiza-tion and think that this is enough, that further diligence and practice are unnecessary. That is mistaken. It is like trying to rub two pieces of wood together to make fire, and when they start to smoke, thinking that this is enough. The smoke is an indication that if you keep on rubbing, you will get a fire, but smoke itself is not a fire; smoke itself is not enough. The indica-tions of successful practice that you experience are not indica-tions that you have no need to practice further; they are indica-tions that if you practice even more diligently, you will reach some result or fruition. Therefore, experience and realization should spur you to further effort and not to abandoning effort. The sixth thing to be practiced is that when practice has, to some extent, entered into your mental continuum, do not enter into meaningless distractions in the midst of many people, but continue the practice. For example, after you have finished a period of retreat, if you enter into a state of complete distrac-tion and waste a lot of time, then as time goes on, the benefit you have received from the practice, the indications of a suc-cessful practice, and the changes in your personality that are marks of practice, will decrease, and your distraction and mind-lessness will increase. Finally, if you do not turn away from that direction, you will find that there is not the slightest mark of any kind of benefit left from the practice you have done. The point is that if you practice, you have to keep on practicing. You cannot stop and just be careless. The seventh thing to be practiced is, having committed your-self to undertake a certain discipline and mode of conduct in the presence of the khenpo, or upadyaya, or preceptor in the case of vinaya, or the vajra master in the case of samaya, do not let your three gates-your body, speech, and mind-slip into care-lessness and laziness, but continually practice the three trainings in accordance with the commitments you have made. The three trainings are personal discipline or morality, meditation, and the acquisition of knowledge and understanding."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 The Instructions of Gampopa The eighth thing to be practiced is, having generated bodhi-citta-the intention to attain supreme awakening-do not prac-tice merely for your own benefit, but perform all activities, and especially all practice, for the benefit of others. In connection with this, many people come to me and say, \"I cannot take the bodhisattva vow, because I am really mostly concerned about myself. I cannot just abandon that in one instant and pretend that I am concerned only about other people.\" In a certain way this is a valid remark, but when you take the bodhisattva vow it is not the case that you must immediately, in an instant, be-come perfect. You have to keep on working, or doing whatever you need to do to survive, but you should practice as much Dharma as you can, and practice it for the benefit of others. Slowly, by instilling that motivation, the concern for others will grow and the training connected with the bodhisattva vow will take root in you. The ninth thing to be practiced is, having entered into the door of secret mantra through receiving empowerment, do not leave your body, speech, and mind in a state of ordinariness, but practice maintaining your body, speech, and mind as the three mandalas. This means recognizing that your body is the deity, that speech and all sound are mantra, and that whatever occurs in the mind is the expanse of wisdom. The point of this is to maintain the attitude that your body, speech, and mind are the body, speech, and mind of all buddhas. Then the tenth thing to be practiced is, when you are young, do not waste your time wandering around meaninglessly, but practice with austerity in the presence of authentic teachers. When people are young they tend to go sightseeing, to run around and experiment a bit. For example, in Tibet, when people were young they would often spend a lot of time going on pil-grimage to the eighteen regions and so forth. It is true that these are places that have great blessings because they have been consecrated by the siddhas of the past, but going to the various"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Be Practiced 63 mountains and so forth involves quite a bit of difficulty and hardship. It would be better, when you are young and have a clear mind and a strong body, to make use of these faculties, not in such activities, but by staying in one place and practic-ing in the presence of teachers, which involves much the same hardship. These are the ten things to be practiced."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"8 The Ten Things to Emphasize Next are the ten things to emphasize, or the ten things to be diligent about. The first of these is, when you are a beginner, be diligent in hearing and contemplation, or study and analysis, because if you know absolutely nothing about the Dharma, you cannot practice; you have no idea what to practice or how to practice it. At the very beginning it is important to concentrate on acquiring the necessary information and making sure that you understand it. The second thing to be diligent about is, having generated the experience and basic understanding that comes from ac-quiring information and analyzing it, emphasize the practice of meditation. In the context of meditation practice, the third point is, until you attain stability, exert yourself in solitude. Stability means a stage in your practice in which your mind is not affected in any way by any kind of external conditions or circumstances what-soever, and is not affected in any way by any kind of thought or emotion that can occur in the mind. Until you attain such a degree of stability, it is necessary to practice in solitude. In the context of intense practice, the fourth point is, if you find that your mind wanders a lot and is constantly going out"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Emphasize 65 to objects, and if you find that you are prey to excitement or agitation of the mind, then be diligent in relaxing your aware-ness to pacify this agitation. The fifth point is, if, on the other hand, you find that you are prey to torpor and mental fogginess, then uplift your aware-ness. This means, for example, straightening your posture and slightly intensifying the application of awareness. Of the two defects that are mentioned here, the first one, jingwa, which means sunkenness or torpor, is a state of physical and mental depression or sleepiness-not necessarily emotional depres-sion-and the second one, mukpa, or mental fogginess, is a lack of mental clarity. The sixth point is, until your mind becomes stable, empha-size even placement. The mind being stable refers to the state in which the mind is not affected by thoughts, the state in which the mind can direct itself to an object without there being any kind of hindrance from arising thoughts. Until you arrive at that stage, you should concentrate on even placement, which in this case means the practice of tranquility meditation or shamata. The seventh point is, when you have become stable in even placement, then emphasize post-meditation. Post-meditation here does not mean not practicing. It means the class of formal practices that are done in order to accumulate merit, practices that are more structured than basic shamata or tranquility medi-tation. The point here is that when we have gained some tran-quility, we should then apply that to the accumulation of merit, in order that our practice of tranquility does not merely be-come the absorption of the formless realms. The eighth point is, if there seem to be many adverse condi-tions, then concentrate on and apply diligently the three types of patience. When things are not going well with any aspect of your practice or your life, you should apply the appropriate type of patience, rather than attempting to flee from the circumstances."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 The Instructions of Gampopa The first type of patience is called the patience that is the acceptance of suffering. This means accepting the experience of suffering you are undergoing, and not attempting to flee from it or deny it, but working with it directly. The second type is the patience that is certainty about the Dharma. This means being patient with the profundity of Dharma, which may not be very easy to understand, and being patient with the process of growing to understand it. The third type is, literally, \"the patience that does not think anything whatsoever,\" but it means the patience of not making a big deal out of things. This refers to situations in which someone else is aggressive to you, and it means not reacting by scheming; not thinking, \"So-and-so has done (or said) this, what should I do (or say) back?\" and not working out strategies and complicated maneuvers, but just thinking, \"Well, it is not a big deal, I do not have to do anything about it.\" The ninth point is, if you have a great attachment and fixa-tion on something, then forcefully or violently reverse that at-tachment. This means to concentrate on transcending whatever particular form of attachment torments you the most. In the case of a Kadampa teacher of the past, for example, there was a time when someone came begging food from him, and of course food meant roasted barley flour or tsampa. He did not have very much tsampa, and he was originally just going to give this per-son a handful because, when he looked at what he had, he thought that was all he could spare. Then he realized that he was very attached to this food and to measuring it out like that, so he gave the beggar everything he had, just to be able to cut through that miserliness. Finally, if you find that you do not have very much loving-kindness and compassion, then concentrate upon developing bodhicitta. You should carefully consider the benefits of bodhicitta, since it is the only possible cause of buddhahood, and the defects of not possessing bodhicitta, since without it there is no possibility of awakening. Therefore, consider the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Ten Things to Emphasize 67 need to engage in the process of developing loving-kindness and compassion. Reason with yourself and analyze the situa-tion. Come to an understanding that no matter how it may seem, the root of all suffering is in actuality the desire to accomplish our own benefit and our own aims, and the root of all happi-ness is the relinquishment of that concern and the desire to ac-complish the benefit of others. Having understood these things as they are explained in the mahayana texts, then cultivate them as best you can. These are the ten things to be done diligently, or ten things to emphasize in specific situations."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"9 The Ten Exhortations Next come the ten things that are exhortations. The first of these is, thinking of the difficulty of obtaining the freedom and re-sources of the precious human existence, exhort yourself to practice the holy Dharma. Consider that the only possible ba-sis for the attainment of the precious human existence is hav-ing accumulated an inconceivable amount of merit over an in-conceivably long period of time, and therefore it is very, very hard to attain it, and very unlikely that we could attain it with-out the intentional effort to do so through the cultivation of virtue. Consideration of this exhorts us to the practice of Dharma. Second, thinking of death and impermanence, exhort your-self to practice virtue. Consider further that this precious hu-man existence that we now possess, which is so rare, does not last very long, and therefore there is no time to waste. If we wish to make use of it and if we wish to attain it again, we must practice as much virtue as possible. These considerations lead to actually engaging in practice. Third, thinking of the infallibility of the results of action, exhort yourself to abandon wrongdoing. Consider that a harm-ful action not only harms others but also harms you, because it yields an unpleasant result in the future experience of the doer"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Ten Exhortations 69 of the action, and that a virtuous action not only helps others but will definitely help you in the future. If you consider this and have confidence in this, you will naturally avoid whatever is harmful. Fourth, considering the defects of samsara, exhort yourself to the attainment of liberation. Consider that no matter which one of the six states of existence15you are born in, it is an expe-rience that is entirely made up of the three types of suffering. 16 Through actually thinking about how bad samsara is, you will naturally develop the motivation to be liberated from that state of existence, and you will actually engage in the methods that lead to liberation. Fifth, thinking that you are not alone in your suffering, that all sentient beings within samsara undergo terrible suffering, exhort yourself to cultivate bodhicitta. Sixth, thinking that the attitudes of all sentient beings are incorrect or mistaken, exhort yourself to be diligent in hearing and contemplation. By recognizing the fact that the way we all view our experience is mistaken or inaccurate, you recognize the need to study, and to analyze the information that is ac-quired through study. Seventh, thinking of how difficult it is to uproot the habit of confusion that we have cultivated during a period a time that has no beginning, exhort yourself to practice meditation. Eighth, thinking that in these degenerate times the mental afflictions become stronger and stronger, exhort yourself to apply the particular remedy or antidote for each one. Ninth, thinking that there are many adverse conditions in these degenerate times that we live in, exhort yourself to apply patience. It is said that patience is especially necessary in bad or degenerate times because there are so many adverse condi-tions that increase the instances of people harming each other. Thus it becomes more and more necessary to cultivate patience, which is said to be the most important Dharma quality to have in such circumstances."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 The Instructions of Gampopa Tenth, thinking that constant distraction will waste your entire human life, exhort yourself to be diligent. These are the ten things to use as exhortations."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"10 The Ten Deviations Next are the ten deviations. The first of these is, if you have little faith but are very intelligent, you may deviate into be-coming a big talker. If you understand the Dharma intellectu-ally, but, not having much faith, you do not really practice it, then your approach becomes a lot of words. The second deviation is that if, on the other hand, you have a great deal of faith but not much insight, then you will stray into solidifying everything and blindly going forward, or work-ing really hard without knowing what you are doing. This means that you will not have any recognition of the meaning of what you are practicing, so you will not actually be able to attain the realization that the practice should lead to. Third, if you are very diligent, but lack instruction, you will deviate into practice with defects and mistakes. You may be very diligent in your practice but not receive instruction from qualified teachers that includes advice such as, \"when you do this, this may happen, and if that happens then you should do that; if this experience arises, then do not worry about it, it just means you should do this,\" and so forth. If you lack such in-struction, you will be deceived by your own experiences, and you will stray into deception and downfall."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 The Instructions of Gampopa Fourth, if you have not previously cut through misconcep-tions through study and analysis, or hearing and contempla-tion, then the practice of meditation will simply be the cultiva-tion of the state of mental darkness or stupidity. This could be like just sitting there and trying not to think, just closing up and closing in. Fifth, if you do not immediately put into practice your un-derstanding of Dharma, you will become a jaded scholar. When you come to an understanding of something or receive some practical instructions, if you do not make use of it immediately, the desire to make use of it becomes less and less over time. You become more and more jaded and start to think less and less of the value of Dharma and the instructions you have re-ceived. You keep on receiving more and more instructions and acquiring more and more knowledge or information, but it re-mains just as information, and you have less and less desire to practice. On the other hand, if you immediately put into prac-tice instructions you receive, your desire to practice them in-creases. The more practice you do, the more your respect for the instructions and your understanding of their true value will increase. Sixth, if you do not train yourself in the aspect of method, which is the cultivation of compassion, then, having concern only for your own benefit and your own liberation, you will stray into the lesser vehicle. This means that if you do not gen-erate a pure intention to accomplish the benefit of others through having compassion and genuine concern for their ben-efit, then no matter what practice you do, it will still be the lower vehicle, because it is the motivation that separates these. Even if you are practicing secret mantra, which is certainly the greater vehicle, and you are doing pujas, visualizing dei-ties, reciting mantras, and so forth, if you have no compassion, then it is not really secret mantra at all. That situation is a little bit like someone who has a very powerful gun that could shoot a bullet very accurately over a long distance, but who fires it pointed down at the ground. Thus it is essential to have a com-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Ten Deviations 73 mitment to the benefit of others, and to understand the impor-tance of emphasizing the benefit of others in your motivation for practice. Seventh, if you do not train your mind in the aspect of knowl-edge, which is the correct understanding of emptiness, what-ever you practice will simply be the cultivation of further samsara.lf you do not come to an understanding of emptiness, then whatever you do has ego-clinging and a persistent belief in your own inherent existence as its basic motivation or start-ing point. With that as a basis, no matter what you practice, whether it is the most profound secret mantra or anything else, it will only be the further cultivation of ego. Eighth, if you do not transcend or defeat the eight worldly dharmas, then whatever practice you do will only be a mun-dane ornament. If the motivation for your practice is the wish to acquire possessions, fame, respect, and service, and the fear that these will diminish, then Dharma practice will lead to a slight acquisition of such things, which is like a pretty, mean-ingless ornament, but it will not lead to anything else. Ninth, if people in villages get too interested in you and have too much faith in you, then you can stray into becoming some-one who just attends to the wishes of other people. This point is expressed in terms of a situation that might arise in Tibet: if you are a practitioner and let villagers have too much faith and interest in you, you will just become a slave to popularity. It means that if you cater too much to the attention of other people, then that is where your mind will be, and your practice will degenerate into simply trying to please them. Tenth, if you have generated some qualities and some per-sonal power through your practice, but your mind is not stable--you have some kind of qualities while you practice, but you do not have the stability or maturity that would enable you to remain in solitude and just concentrate on practice--then you may become someone who wanders around villages doing little pujas to please the people and acquire offerings. These are the ten types of deviation."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"74 The Instructions ofGampopa QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q: It was said that suffering and sicknesses are good teachers. Should we then stop having compassion for those people who suffer and have sicknesses? A: It is necessary to have compassion when other people are suffering and sick because, from your own point of view, the aspiration of looking at the suffering of others, and wishing that their suffering could be absorbed into your suffering so they would not have to go through it, is the basis for the devel-opment and path of bodhicitta. As far as your own suffering is concerned, you should view that as a demonstration of the re-sults of negative actions, and this will inspire you to avoid wrongdoing and cultivate virtue. But with regard to the suffer-ing of others, it is important to have the strong intention to do everything you can to alleviate their suffering. If you actually have the ability to do this physically, you should do so. If not, you should aspire to develop the ability to alleviate the suffer-ing of all beings, and dedicate the virtue and merit of whatever practice you do-whatever mantras you recite or meditations you perform and so forth-to the alleviation of the suffering of all beings, and in particular, those beings you come in contact with who are manifestly suffering. When you see sick or suf-fering people, you should not think, \"Well, that is a good teacher for them. I am glad they had that,\" because this attitude is only helpful when it is applied toward your own experiences, not toward those of others. Q: Concerning the different stages of dealing with aggression, it seems that the teachings you have been giving are basically saying to give up attachments and the eight worldly dharmas-fame, respect, wealth, gain, and loss. In that context I am won-dering, if you have faith in the teachers and you have faith in the practice, although you have not had much experience your-self, would the idea be just, in some sense, to give up and not"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Ten Deviations 75 really care what anybody says, just as long as you keep practic-ing and maintain your relationship with your gurus? A: Yes. Q: In this day and age people will say this is crazy. A: If you have a stable confidence in the Dharma, you can just forget about the aggression of others, because the third kind of patience, the patience that is not making a big deal out of other's aggressions, consists of just that-not thinking anything of it. Q: Just let it go and not worry about the consequences? A: If you are a practitioner, you do not need to think about it at all. You do not need to worry about the future consequences, you do not have to try and figure out or imagine what their motivation might be, or anything like that. You just forget about it. Q: So you just do your practice and keep your motivation as pure as you can? A: Yes, you only have to worry about your own motivation and not that of others, because if you start to think about what other people's motivations are, you might not be able to deter-mine them. Also, if you try to correct their motivation or way of looking at things, while it is possible that you might be able to help, it is more likely that you will just strengthen their men-tal afflictions. Q: You spoke about dealing with your mind in different ways according to different yanas or vehicles. In the hinayana you try to cut your own suffering, in the mahayana you realize that other people are suffering and you try to do things for the ben-efit of others, and then in the vajrayana you see your mind as the dharmakaya or wisdom. When you go though this process, do you sort of grind your mind down through the techniques"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 The Instructions of Gampopa of first two yanas, so that by the time you become a vajrayana practitioner you can see your mind in that way, and you have more space around you for your thoughts? Do your thoughts change, or do they remain essentially the same in nature, so it is just the way you are working with them when they arise that is different? A: The gradation of approaches corresponding to the different vehicles is as you said. As for the situation of a vajrayana prac-titioner, there are two types of vajrayana practitioners, a vajrayana practitioner in name and an actual vajrayana practi-tioner. When we begin to practice vajrayana we are just vajrayana practitioners in name. We do not have any vajrayana level of realization; that has to come through practice. An au-thentic or actual practitioner of vajrayana is someone who has actually attained the realizations corresponding to the previ-ous vehicles and generated the qualities that those vehicles em-body, and who is starting to develop the qualities of the vajrayana path as well. Then it is like having wings-he or she transcends a lot of nonsense. However, thoughts do not cease for an authentic vajrayana practitioner. Such a practitioner sees the nature of thoughts to be self-liberated and sees that they cannot possibly harm his or her realization. It is said that there is no need to cause thoughts to cease, and it is also impossible. However, in the case of an arya practitioner (someone who has attained at least the first bodhisattva level, or bhumi) we have to distinguish the presence or absence of thought accord-ing to whether he or she is engaged in even-placement medita-tion or in post-meditation. In meditation, a bodhisattva has no thoughts and in post-meditation he or she has thoughts, yet recognizes their nature. At the time of fruition, when one at-tains complete buddhahood, there are no thoughts. Q: So is the path in vajrayana recognizing the nature of thoughts each time they arise?"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Ten Deviations 77 A: That would be very good, but it also would be very difficult. Basically what is emphasized is, when a strong mental afflic-tion or klesha arises, looking directly at the essence or nature of that mental affliction, and seeing it to be self-liberated. It is not so much any thought, but a strong mental affliction, that is treated in this manner. Q: This question has to do with mental fixation. In general it appears from the teachings that any conceptual idea about the world is mental fixation. But in the practice of meditation, when the mind becomes fixated on the same distracting thought over and over again, is the way to work with that fixation just con-tinually to look at that as thinking, and then gradually it be-comes released from its conceptual nature? For example, when I am trying to visualize Chenrezig, at certain times the same thought intrudes again and again, like a broken record. After a while I realize, \"This is thinking.\" I keep coming back to the visualization, but the more I try, the more the thoughts keep arising. A: Well, that is what training in the generation stage is like. In the beginning you generate a visualization, and then you be-come distracted, and then you return to the visualization, and then again you become distracted, and you return, and so forth. That experience arises for everyone at the beginning of this kind of training. To deal with this, various methods or approaches to visualization are presented, in order that the practitioner can avoid this broken record syndrome. For example, let us say you are visualizing a deity in front of you in space. At times you direct your attention to the presence of the deity and to the whole form, and at other times you go through the details of the appearance, starting from the top of the head down to the bottom, and then from the bottom up to the top, and so forth. Through such methods, eventually your"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78 The Instructions of Gampopa mind starts to become trained and tamed in the context of that visualization, and then it will come to rest more on the visual-ization. Until you become trained, you will still have to go through the experience of becoming distracted and returning to the technique, which is in this case the visualization. When starting to visualize deities, often people have the ex-perience of forgetting, in the most basic sense of that word, what the deity looks like, having actually to try to remember what they are wearing, what their ornaments are, and so forth. In order to train people there are additional visualizations, such as the projection and withdrawal of rays of light, as well as various ways of clarifying the visualization of the deity's form, such as starting from the inside and moving out, or starting from the outside and moving in. There are also more complex visualizations, for example, one in which rays of light are pro-jected from the deity's heart and make offerings to all buddhas and bodhisattvas, and then the rays of light are drawn back in, and go out again and transform all sentient beings into the de-ity, purifying their obscurations. The function of all of these is to enable the practitioner to bring the mind to rest within the framework of the visualization. Q: I have a question on the view of emptiness. Is shentong the ultimate view of emptiness? Also, I remember that you said once in the teachings on The Profound Inner Meaning17 that trees do not have sentience, but some Buddhists who have studied the Avatamsaka Sutra say that every object has sentience. What are the correct views of sentience and emptiness? A: There are evidently different interpretations of the words of the sutras. Sections of the Avatamsaka Sutra that might be con-strued elsewhere in the way you suggest, have traditionally not been construed that way in Tibet. From the sutra point of view, it is not considered that inanimate objects have aware-ness. From the point of view of tantra, the five elements of which inanimate objects are composed are in their nature the five"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Ten Deviations 79 female buddhas, the five consorts, and they are of the nature of wisdom. Thus, while it is not asserted in the sutras that inani-mate objects have awareness, in the tantras it is said that every-thing is of the nature of wisdom. With regard to whether or not the \"empty of other\" or shen-tong position is the final and ultimate statement of emptiness, generally speaking there are two aspects to determining the status of experienced things. When it is determined that the appearances that we experience have no inherent existence or nature, and are therefore empty of possessing their own indi-vidual nature that makes them what they are, then that is called \"the determination of self-emptiness\" or rangtong. Further, when it is determined that emptiness, the nature that is the lack of inherent existence of all things, is not merely a total absence of anything, but is at the same time the sponta-neous presence of all of the qualities of awakening-the bodies and realms of all buddhas-then, since the nature is empty of defilements that are other than itself, this is called \"the empty of other determination\" or the shentong approach. The two views are thus not particularly conflicting. As for whether or not this type of approach is the ultimate one among the Buddha's teachings, there are many different assertions about which interpretation of the Buddha's words is the final or most profound one. From the point of view of the listeners and solitary realizers-the shravakas and pratyeka-buddhas-the realization of the noninherent existence of the personal self is the final and ultimate meaning of the Buddha's teachings. Adhering to that position, they attain the state of an arhat. From the point of view of those who adhere to the Mind-only school, that is the ultimate position; and from the point of view of those who adhere to any of the Middle Way schools, they are the ultimate positions. Therefore, I cannot say that the shentong view is the final one and is superior to the others. If you consider the view of secret mantra to be the highest view and the final destination"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80 The Instructions of Gampopa of the Buddha's teachings, then it can be said that among the sutra views, it is the shentong view that comes closest to the view of secret mantra or vajrayana. In that sense it is useful because an understanding of the shentong view is a good way to gain access to the view of vajrayana. Rather than viewing one of these various presentations as ultimate and excluding others, it is more helpful from the vajrayana standpoint to view them as steps on a staircase."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"11 The Ten Confusions of One Thing for Another The next set of ten are the ten cases of confusing one thing for another. This refers to ten situations in which there are two attitudes that seem to be similar in appearance, but are very different in their effect and nature, and therefore are very easy to confuse for one another. The first of these is that it is possible to confuse faith and desire. When you have faith in someone, that feels good; it is pleasant. When you are attached to someone personally, that also feels good. It is possible to confuse the one for the other in your attitude toward your teachers. Faith in teachers is appre-ciation of the fact that through their realization, their under-standing, and their compassion, they teach the path that leads to liberation and omniscience. It is an interest in them and what they teach, a respect for them and for the process. On the other hand, attachment, desire, or personal fixation on teachers is being attracted to them and taking delight in them because of their race, their appearance, the fact that they might be young, or something ephemeral or shallow in their personality."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82 The Instructions of Gampopa Second, it is possible to mistake attachment for loving-kind-ness and compassion. Love and compassion are distinguished from attachment in that they apply equally to your friends and your enemies. Genuine love and compassion make no distinc-tion based upon your relationship to the object of compassion. They are the wish that all sentient beings without exception have happiness and the causes of happiness, and the wish that all sentient beings without exception be free of suffering and the causes of suffering. The keynote of those two attitudes is that there is no hope involved of any kind of return or any sort of personal satisfaction as a result of the happiness of others. In the case of attachment to someone, you wish that person well but it is based on an identification with him or her as \"my friend, my son, my daughter.\" This identification and this feel-ing of ownership or territoriality is related to wanting some kind of return. You enjoy the happiness of that person because you have identified with him or her, and therefore in essence it is just wishing for your own benefit. Such attachment can very easily turn to aversion, anger, and hatred. That is the difference between compassion and attachment. Third, it is possible to mix up the natural emptiness of all things with conceptually imputed emptiness. That is, we may confuse genuine emptiness with an idea of emptiness. Genu-ine emptiness, the actual nature of all things, is beyond any kind of elaboration, which means it is beyond any kind of con-ceptual description or conceptual appreciation. It cannot be encountered through thought. Therefore, when we think about emptiness and generate a concept or an idea of it, all we can do is negate aspects of our experience and call that negation emp-tiness. There is no direct experience of emptiness in such rea-soning. Reasoning may be useful, but it cannot lead to a direct experience of the nature itself. It can only lead to a partial ne-gation of misconceptions. Actual emptiness transcends not only existence or affirmation of existence, but also nonexistence or negation of existence. Emptiness is inconceivable and there-fore must be distinguished from a conceptual idea of it."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Ten Confusions of One Thing for Another 83 Fourth, it is possible to mix up the expanse of qualities, the dharmadhatu, and the nihilistic view, the view of annihilation. Because the expanse of qualities is the nature of all things, it transcends being an interdependent thing. It is not brought about through causes and conditions. It is not a product and it is not a composite. This is quite different from the view that there is no interdependence and therefore no continuation of the results produced by our present and past actions. It is pos-sible to confuse these two. Sometimes, when the nature of the dharmadhatu is presented, partial understanding of that na-ture may lead to the misunderstanding that there is no such thing as karma. There was once an eminent teacher, a previous birth of Dodrupchen Rinpoche, who taught a course in which he set forth the view of the expanse of qualities. One of the monks attending the course misunderstood that view and thought it meant that there are no results to actions and that it was per-missible to do anything. He went out and killed a goat. Then Dodrupchen Rinpoche asked him, \"You are a Dharma person and a monk, how could you possibly kill a goat?\" He replied, \"You said that I do not exist, the goat does not exist, and the act of killing does not exist. Therefore, I thought there would be no problem.\" Dodrupchen Rinpoche was so agonized by the fact that his presentation had led to such a misunderstanding that he went into retreat and did not teach for years. Fifth, it is possible to mix up experience and realization. A variety of experiences may arise within your practice which are indications that the practice is successful and is having some effect on you. Such experiences, such indications or signs are quite different from realization. Experiences by their nature decay and disappear, whereas realization does not and cannot disappear. If you fixate on an experience and direct your prac-tice toward it, when the experience disappears you will be left with nothing, and certainly with no realization. It is quite common for people to mistake these two. The dif-ference is extreme because in realization all defects have been"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 The Instructions of Gampopa abandoned and the power of wisdom has expanded or blos-somed. It is quite common for people who have some experi-ences while practicing to assume that they have attained real-ization. They assume that they are siddhas, and therefore they engage in conduct that they have heard is appropriate for siddhas. Then, of course, when they die they go to the lower realms. Sixth, it is possible to mistake a good monk or nun for a phony. Good monks and nuns have abandoned that which is harmful to themselves and others, and they cultivate the mode of conduct prescribed in the vinaya or discipline. The way they should appear is also prescribed: there are certain robes that are worn a particular way, certain colors, certain implements that are held, certain things that are relinquished, and so forth. This is quite detailed, and a good monk or nun will maintain all of it. A phony would look the same on the outside, wearing the same robes, and would appear exactly the same in conduct, if you just looked at him or her. The difference is that a good monk or nun behaves the same way whether anyone is look-ing or not. He or she is the same in public and private. A phony is always very good when others are looking, but when no one is looking, is not so good. Seventh, it is possible to confuse someone who, having mani-festly realized the nature of all things, has eradicated all confu-sion, with someone who has been carried off by Mara and has gone berserk. When people have truly realized the nature of all things directly, finally, they have no fear. They are not afraid of anything. They have no hesitation. They have no personal needs; they do not care about themselves at all. Therefore, the way they might act is somewhat uncertain. We cannot say that they will act one way or another. On the other hand, the way a mad person-someone who has gone crazy because something has gone wrong with his or her practice-might act is equally uncertain. From our point of view we cannot really tell the difference."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Ten Confusions of One Thing for Another 85 Eighth, it is possible to confuse a siddha and a charlatan. Having completely realized the nature of all things and puri-fied all defilements, siddhas do a variety of things for the ben-efit of sentient beings. For example, they might make predic-tions. Siddhas might say that twenty years from now such and such will happen. People find the actions of the siddhas quite useful and pleasing; it is helpful to know such things. There-fore, there are also charlatans who, seeing that people find siddhas very attractive, pretend to be siddhas and make pre-dictions-saying that twenty years from now this and that will happen, and in the past certain things happened and so forth-in order to gain praise and get rich. Thus it is possible to con-fuse siddhas and charlatans. Ninth, it is possible to confuse someone who is engaged in the benefit of others with someone who is engaged in his or her own benefit. Bodhisattvas and realized yogis will do any-thing they can to benefit sentient beings with their body, speech, and mind. They do a lot of good, and they dedicate all the merit they accumulate through the good they do to all sentient be-ings. They have no hope for any kind of personal result or per-sonal gain through the good they do. On the other hand, there are people who do a certain amount of good in order to attract a following and gain wealth and power. For example, there was once a Tibetan lama who went to Ladakh. He was not very well known, so he did not have very many followers and he did not receive very many offer-ings. Whatever offerings he received, though, he would use to offer butter lamps and make feast offerings and so forth in or-der to accumulate merit. When people heard about this, they were very much impressed with him; he was evidently the real thing, so they started making a lot of offerings to him. Huge numbers of people assembled around him-a whole city of stu-dents. In this way he accumulated a lot of money, at which point he went right back to Tibet. His use of the initial small offerings was a calculated investment. He knew that if it seemed that"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86 The Instructions of Gampopa everything he offered was going toward meritorious projects, people would offer a lot more, at which point he could simply take the money. Tenth, it is possible to confuse a skillful teacher with a de-ceptive or dishonest teacher. Skillful teachers do whatever they can and say whatever is necessary to enable people to enter into the practice of Dharma and to help their students avoid unnecessary difficulties and obstacles. A teacher who can do that is a very, very useful and excellent teacher. Genuine teach-ers of that type have no concern for any kind of benefit that will come to them. They have no fixation on what happens and no hopes with regard to their students' attitude towards them. On the other hand, there are people who act in somewhat simi-lar ways, at least in appearance, but hide their own defects and pretend to have qualities they do not really possess. Using such deception, they manipulate people into accomplishing some kind of aim of their own such as the acquisition of wealth or followers, or both. It is possible to confuse these two kinds of teachers. These are the ten situations in which two things look the same at first but are not in fact the same at all."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"12 The Ten Unmistaken Things Next are the ten things that are urunistaken. The first of these is, having no attachment to anything, to leave home, and hav-ing left home to have no home. This means to leave worldly life-to stop being a householder-and to have no attachment, that is, not try to make a home out of your ordination. There are different ways in which a person might enter into a renunciate ordination. The really pure and correct approach is, having no attachment at all, not only to leave worldly life, but also to avoid recreating a nest or home in the ordination. But it is also possible for people to become ordained for social reasons, or become ordained in order to make a home for them-selves, a secure situation in a monastery. While it is possible that they might eventually straighten out, their initial motiva-tion is not correct. Having generated such a genuine renunciation, the second thing that is urunistaken is to respect your teacher-the spiri-tual friend who is an authentic guru-so much that you carry him or her above your head like the cloth that binds your top-knot. This refers to the practice of gathering the hair into a topknot, and in order for it not to unravel, putting a piece of white cotton around it. Now, we do not bind our topknots with"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"88 The Instructions of Gampopa cloth here in this country, but the point is to respect your teacher so much that you always imagine carrying him or her above your head. Third, it is unmistaken to combine the three practices of hearing, contemplating, and meditating. Whenever you acquire Dharmic information through studying or receiving teachings, you should immediately investigate its meaning, analyze it until it is clear, and then apply it in your practice of meditation. You cannot meditate without having received the information, nor can you wait until you have totally perfected all learning be-fore you begin practice. Therefore it is important to put into practice immediately everything you learn, after having ana-lyzed it until you correctly understand it. Fourth, it is unmistaken to have a high view and \"low\" con-duct. This means that we should preserve the unexcelled view of the highest vehicle, the vajrayana, and practice this vehicle properly, but practice it within the context of the proper con-duct that is indicated in the hinayana or lowest vehicle. We should conduct ourselves in accordance with the vinaya, wear-ing the appropriate robes and so forth. We should combine a profound understanding with careful conduct that is in accord with the vinaya. Fifth, it is unmistaken to have a vast mind but a narrow com-mitment. ln the manner of kyebu dampa or exalted individuals, the best way to do things is not to commit yourself to some-thing too vast, not to talk too big in your commitment. If you make a tremendously large commitment in the beginning, you will not keep it up, and then your commitment will be like a design drawn in water. The best way to do things is to make a small commitment, stick to it, and never give it up until your death. Then gradually a lot is done. Keeping to a modest com-mitment is like carving something in stone. Someone who carves mani stones,l8 for example, will think of one at a time while doing the carving; but if he or she keeps on doing it for a"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Ten Unmistaken Things 89 long time, eventually a tremendous number of them will be done. Even though it is a small project at any given point, it adds up to something very significant over time. Sixth, in the context of hearing and contemplation, it is unmistaken to have great insight and little pride. It is impor-tant to apply all the insight we can bring to bear on the pro-cesses of hearing and contemplation, but to do so without arrogance. Seventh, in the context of practice, it is important to be rich in instruction and persevering in application. This means tore-ceive a variety of instructions and to persevere and prolong the application of whatever particular practice we are engaged in. Eighth, again in the context of practice, it is unmistaken to have excellent experience and realization but no pride or van-ity. It is possible that someone who starts to have meditation experiences might think, \"Those people are just worldly fools and I am a great practitioner,\" which is arrogance or pride. He or she might be intoxicated by these experiences and deluded by vanity, thinking, \"I must be an arya now. I am really getting close to buddhahood. It is just around the comer.\" It is impor-tant to avoid such reactions to experiences in meditation. Ninth, it is unmistaken to be independent in solitude and relaxed in the midst of many. This means that you are able to be alone in retreat and take care of yourself, not being in any way disturbed by the lack of company or such things as insuf-ficient clothing and food. You are tough and self-sufficient and you are able to practice in solitude. But at the same time, you are able to be with others when it is appropriate, to be in the midst of an assembly of practitioners without paranoia and without thinking, \"I will not be able to get along with them. It will be a real hassle to deal with these people again.\" You should relax and get along with other people. You have to be able to deal with both situations, and if you can do that, you are a genu-ine practitioner."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 The Instructions of Gampopa Finally, it is unmistaken to have no attachment to your own benefit, yet be skillful in benefiting others. It is unmistaken if you can be sensitive to the needs of others and apply yourself actively to that which benefits others, but do so without hop-ing for any kind of gain or return for yourself. These are the ten things that are unmistaken."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"13 The Fourteen Useless Things Next, there are fourteen things that are totally useless. The first of these is to have obtained a human body but not to remember or think of Dharma. This is as useless as being a poor person who comes to an island covered with many different kinds of jewels, but then leaves the island empty handed, without tak-ing even one jewel. Second, having entered the door of Dharma through ordi-nation, to then return to worldly life is as useless as a moth being attracted by a candle flame and flying into it. Third, for someone with no faith to reside in the presence of a great teacher who is a veritable treasury of Dharma is as use-less as someone dying of thirst on the border of a lake. Fourth, to know a great deal about Dharma but not make that knowledge lead to abandoning the four root violations of moral discipline19 or become an antidote to our ego-clinging is just as useless as placing an ax by the trunk of a tree and not using it to cut down the tree. Fifth, instructions that are not used as an antidote to kleshas or mental afflictions are as useless as bags of medicine carried around by a sick person and not taken. Sixth, philosophical terminology in which we have trained our tongue, but which has not been absorbed into our mental continuum, is as useless as the recitations of a parrot."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 The Instructions of Gampopa Seventh, to have taken something that is not given, by means of stealth, overpowering, robbery, deception, or concealment, and then to give it generously to others or use it to make offer-ings is as useless as to take your sheepskin garment and plunge it into water. This is not so easy to understand because we do not have such things, but a sheepskin garment that is prepared in the traditional way may be dirty, but it is soft. If you try to clean it by putting it in water, when it dries it becomes hard and stiff and totally useless. Eighth, to harm sentient beings and then offer them to the Three Jewels is as useless as to cut up the flesh of a child and then offer it to the child's mother. This refers to the practice of animal sacrifice that was done in Tibet before the advent of Buddhism. We cannot necessarily call this a Bon practice, be-cause modem Bonpos do not do it. It is something that hap-pened there, and occasionally happens in some places even now. It is considered as useless to offer such things to buddhas and bodhisattvas as it would be to offer the executed body of a son to his mother. Ninth, to be hypocritically good and patient in order to ac-complish our own aims in this life is as useless as the gentle conduct of a cat waiting to pounce on a mouse. Hypocrisy here refers to pretending to be moral when you are not, and patient refers to the patience of waiting for an opportunity to become wealthy or attain some worldly aim. That is like the careful, gentle, and peaceful conduct of a cat that is trying to attract a mouse it wants to kill. Tenth, to engage in vast acts of virtue in order to become famous or wealthy or honored in this life is like exchanging a wish-fulfilling jewel for a small lump of flour. We might do such things as making and offering statues, or other generally virtuous things, but we might do them just to gain the respect of others, or to attract people so that we might eventually be-come rich or esteemed within a community. The virtue in itself is like a wishful-filling jewel, but doing such a thing and dedi-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Fourteen Useless Things 93 eating it to our own benefit is like exchanging that jewel in or-der to get a meal. When we dedicate the merit that we accumu-late to the benefit of all beings, it becomes inexhaustible like a wish-fulfilling jewel, but not to dedicate it properly is like ex-changing that jewel for something that will not last very long. Eleventh, receiving a great deal of instruction but leaving your own mind untamed is as useless as a physician dying of an incurable disease. The analogy is not very exact or obvious here, but the point is this: If you are very learned in Dharma, and you put a great deal of time and effort in acquiring infor-mation, but you have not put any time and effort into practice, it does not help you. It might help somebody else, but it does not help you. That is like the situation of a doctor who is af-flicted by a sickness that cannot be cured. A doctor is someone who is very, very learned, but if he or she has a type of sickness that will not respond to medicine, then there is nothing the doctor can do, no matter liow skilled he or she is in medicine. This is not saying there is anything wrong with being a doctor, but the point is that study or learning itself cannot actually change everything. Twelfth, to be learned in instructions but have no experi-ence of practice is like possessing a treasury of wealth to which you have no key. Thirteenth, to teach Dharma when you have not understood what it means is as useless as for a blind person to lead another blind person. Fourteenth, to consider the experience that arises from meth-ods of practice as supreme, and not to search for genuine real-ization of the ultimate nature of the mind, is as useless as to take brass and say it is gold. This refers primarily to the accu-mulation of merit. 20 If you are satisfied with the accumulation of merit and the experiences or benefits that arise from this, and you do not recognize the nature of all things, then you cannot attain true buddhahood. Thus, when you engage in prac-tices that accumulate merit, it is extremely important to have"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94 The Instructions of Gampopa the intention to accumulate such merit in order to recognize the ultimate nature and attain complete buddhahood. The point here is that method, the accumulation of merit, has to be com-bined with wisdom, which in this case is the correct realization that you are aiming at. If method and wisdom are not united, your accumulation of merit is no more effective than picking up a yellow stone or a piece of brass and assuming that it is gold. These are fourteen things that are totally useless. The func-tion of these instructions is to enable you to tell the difference between what is Dharma and what is not Dharma, and to get some idea of how to apply Dharma, how to practice it, what kind of motivation you should have, what happens if that mo-tivation is there, and what happens if that motivation is not there."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"14 The Eighteen Hidden Evils of Practitioners The next category is the eighteen hidden evils of practitioners. Hidden evils here means actions or characteristics that are not in accordance with the aim of a person, in this case a practitio-ner. For example, if someone is renowned as a scholar but is illiterate, or if someone is renowned as beautiful but has no nose, this is a discordance of name and reality. Thus if someone is renowned as a practitioner but has no practice, that is a dis-cordance of name and reality. The first of these hidden evils is to reside in solitude and yet only attempt to accomplish greatness in this life. The purpose of residing in solitude is to direct all of your effort to the ac-complishment of liberation and omniscience. If instead, while residing in solitude, you direct all your effort to the accom-plishment of wealth, renown, service, and comfort, then this is a hidden evil of a practitioner. Second, to be the leader of a community such as a monas-tery or some kind of Dharma organization, and yet not take care of it and not make its preservation your aim, but only work to accomplish what seems beneficial to you personally, is a hid-den evil of Dharma practitioners."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 The Instructions of Gampopa Third, to be learned in Dharma but not to avoid wrongdo-ing is a hidd~n evil of Dharma practitioners. To have the learn-ing that comes from hearing and contemplation, but not to put this into practice by avoiding activities that harm others, is a contradiction of learning and behavior, and therefore is a hid-den evil of Dharma practitioners. Fourth, it is a hidden evil of a practitioner to possess a great deal of instruction but to allow your mental continuum to re-main ordinary. This means to have received, understood, and possibly even memorized a great variety of instructions, but for your mind to remain untamed through practice. Fifth, it is a hidden evil of practitioners to be noble in your physical discipline but to have a mind that is under the power of desire. This means observing a correct moral discipline physi-cally or externally, but not actually taming the mind internally. Sixth, it is a hidden evil of a practitioner to have a variety of excellent or intense experiences in meditation, but still not to have subdued the mental afflictions. Seventh, it is a hidden evil of a practitioner to have entered the door of Dharma but not to abandon the attachment and aversion that would afflict an untrained person. This means embarking on the practice of Dharma, yet not relinquishing jealousy, greed, and pettiness. Eighth, it is a hidden evil of a practitioner to have abandoned mundane activities and entered into the total practice of Dharma, but then bit by bit to return unwittingly to farming, which means to the mundane activities that were abandoned. When people renounce the world, if their renunciation is not complete, what will sometimes happen is that in the beginning they will be pure renunciates and practice Dharma, but then when they are older renunciates they will start to creep back into their old activities. Ninth, to understand the meaning of Dharma and not to practice it is a hidden evil of a practitioner. Tenth, to make a great commitment to a period of practice and then not to keep to it is a hidden evil for a Dharma practi-tioner. For example, to say in the presence of your teacher, \"I"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Eighteen Hidden Evils of Practitioners 97 will remain in retreat for three years,\" or five years or what-ever, and then not be able to do it, is a hidden evil. Eleventh, to have nothing to do but Dharma and yet not to ameliorate your conduct is a hidden evil of a practitioner. This refers to being in a situation like retreat, where there is abso-lutely nothing to do except practice, and yet still being con-cerned with food and clothing and such things. Twelfth, since, when we practice Dharma, food and cloth-ing will naturally arise through the blessing of the Three Jew-els and the power of our practice, it is a hidden evil for a prac-titioner to worry too much about where these things will come from. This means we should not have thoughts like, ''What will I eat tomorrow.? What will I wear?\" Thirteenth, to dedicate whatever slight power and merit you have obtained from practice to the magical protection of others from sickness and from si is a hidden evil of a practitioner. When a family has a child that dies, there is a concern on the part of the parents that the next child might die also. This is called si in Tibetan. People in that situation would ask for some kind of blessing to prevent this from happening. To dedicate your prac-tice to such temporary benefits and to lose sight of the ultimate aim, which is taming your own mental afflictions and develop-ing the ability to tame the mental afflictions of others, and even-tually to establish them all in buddhahood, is a hidden evil of a practitioner. This is not saying that it is improper to help people if you have the genuine ability to do so. What is being pointed out as a defect here is doing these things so that people will say you have a lot of magical power and are very worthy of respect-in other words, doing it to acquire a reputation or a following. Fourteenth, to teach profound instructions in order to ob-tain food and wealth is a hidden evil of a practitioner. To teach indiscriminately whatever you know, whatever texts you have studied, and whatever practices you can explain, simply to obtain position and wealth and so forth, is a defect. There is a great deal of this nowadays; in fact, this is what we all do."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 The Instructions of Gampopa Fifteenth, it is a hidden evil of practitioners to skillfully and indirectly praise themselves and criticize or revile others. For example, you might say, \"I am a completely ordinary teacher. I have no qualities whatsoever, but my lineage is very, very pro-found and has great blessings that are totally unimpaired. My teachers are so and so, and so and so, and they are very power-ful.\" You would then tell stories about these teachers that make them very interesting and impressive, and continue with, \"While I am completely ordinary, the instructions that I have are of great profundity.\" Then, speaking about other teachers, you would say, \"They have extraordinary qualities; they are very learned and accomplished. However, their lineage is a little bit funny. Such and such happened at one time, and then one of their teachers did such and such.\" In speaking this way, while it appears that we are putting ourselves down and praising others, in fact we are doing the opposite, and this is a hidden evil of practitioners. Sixteenth, to teach the instructions that you have received to others, but to allow your own mental continuum to remain unsubdued and not in accord with the Dharma, is a hidden evil of practitioners. As was said before, people who receive instructions can become like echoes, so that whatever goes in comes right back out again, but nothing is really happening. In this situation, whatever instructions you receive you pass on to others without practicing them yourself, although you un-derstand what they mean. Someone like that does not develop the qualities for which we attach the name \"practitioner.\" A practitioner of Dharma is someone who, having received instructions, practices them so that he or she changes. The men-tal afflictions start to diminish, and compassion and loving-kindness start to increase. That is what it means to be a Dharma person. Someone who just understands things and passes them on is not really a Dharma practitioner, because he or she does not have the qualities to which we can assign that name."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Eighteen Hidden Evils of Practitioners 99 The seventeenth hidden evil of a practitioner is to be unable to remain in solitude, and yet to be unable to get along with others when you are living with them. This is the opposite of one of the ten unmistaken things that were described earlier, when it was said that you should be able to abide in solitary retreat and also, when appropriate, to abide harmoniously in the midst of a community of practitioners. In this case, although you have promised to practice in retreat, when you are in re-treat you cannot practice because you are worried that you might not get every little bit of food and clothing you think you need, and you are afraid of being too hot or too cold or something. Then, when you are not in retreat but you are with other people, you are constantly quarreling with them and fight-ing about insignificant things, so that you cannot get along with anyone. Someone like that is not really a practitioner. Finally, it is a hidden evil for a practitioner to be unable to withstand happiness or suffering. If you become totally swept away by pleasant circumstances or comfortable conditions so that you lose your mind to that pleasure or that comfort, and if at the same time, when something in your external circum-stances makes you slightly uncomfortable or is slightly unpleas-ant you are immediately cast into a pit of depression, then you are not really a practitioner. These are the eighteen hidden evils of practitioners."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"15 The Twelve Indispensable Things Next are eleven things21 without which there is no way to prac-tice genuine Dharma. First, if you do not possess from the very beginning of your practice the stable faith or confidence that comes from a sincere and genuine fear for the sufferings of birth and death, there is no way to practice Dharma. The only thing that can motivate a correct practice of Dharma is such a recog-nition of the misery of the continuous cycle of birth and death. Only through that recognition can you have a stable confidence in an authentic teacher and his or her instructions, and only with that confidence can you actually come to understand and practice Dharma. Second, even if you have such a stable confidence, there is still no way to practice Dharma without an authentic guru who can actually direct you on the path that will lead to liberation. Third, although you have such a teacher, if you do not pos-sess the insight that is the correct understanding of the mean-ing of Dharma, then there is no way to practice. Fourth, even if you have such a genuine insight into the meaning of Dharma, if you do not possess the diligence that combines an armor-like, unflagging commitment with genu-ine courage, there is no way to practice. Armor here means the momentum of having committed yourself so strongly that from"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Twelve Indispensable Things 101 the moment you begin to practice, no matter what happens or how long a time goes by, you will never tum away from dili-gent practice. Courage means being able to get through par-ticular obstacles, adverse conditions, and problems that occur during practice, by turning away from the natural tendency to be so disturbed by these difficulties that you give up. Fifth, if you have the attitude that whatever practice of the three trainings and gathering of the two accumulations you have done is enough, there is no way to practice genuine Dharma. You can never be content with the amount you have done. As mentioned earlier, the three trainings are personal discipline, meditation, and acquiring correct knowledge or understanding, and the two accumulations are merit and wis-dom. It is important never to be content with whatever mea-sure of these trainings and accumulations you have performed. For example, it is improper if, having finished one hundred thousand mandala offerings, you think, \"That's enough merit, I can stop here,\" or having recited the prescribed number of mantras, you think, \"That's enough mantras.\" Actually your goal is not only to finish a particular practice or accumulate a certain number of mantras, but to obtain the total omniscience of complete buddhahood. To think, \"This much is enough, I've done enough,\" is as foolish as for someone who has decided, \"I'm going to walk from here to that city over there,\" to walk ten steps, or a hundred or even a thousand steps, and then say, \"Well, that's enough.\" Until you get there, until you have fin-ished what you are trying to do and fulfilled your commitment, it is not enough. Sixth, if you lack the view that is the correct understanding of the nature of all things, then there is no way to practice. In order to achieve the fruition of Dharma practice it is necessary to understand and appreciate the nature of all things. Specifi-cally, we must understand the fact that the wisdom and quali-ties of the fruition are spontaneously present in the basis, which is our situation right now. It is only because of the presence of such wisdom and qualities that it is possible to remove the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 The Instructions of Gampopa habitual and afflictive obscurations that conceal them. There-fore, it is only through this view that we can understand how the fruition can be obtained, and it is only through this view that we can obtain it. If we do not have this view we will not really understand what defects are to be avoided, what qualities will arise on the path, and how they will arise. We will not know what direction to head in our practice. We will be like people walking blind-folded toward a destination in an unknown direction. No mat-ter how vigorously they walk, they will not have any idea where they are going, so they will never get there. If you have this correct view or understanding, then even if your steps on the path are faltering, few, and slow, you know where you are go-ing. Your eyes are opened and you see your destination, so even-tually you will arrive. Seventh, if you do not possess the meditation that is the abil-ity to place your mind in whatever way and on whatever ob-ject you wish, there is no way to practice. The development of tranquility or shinay is absolutely vital to the performance of any kind of practice. If you possess some degree of tranquility, you can visualize deities and maintain that visualization, re-membering all the details of their appearance. You can recite mantras and direct your attention to each syllable of the visu-alized mantra. Even if you are performing mundane activities, you will be able to perform them with complete mindfulness and attention, so that whatever you do becomes easy and is performed effectively. Finally, when you come to recognize the ultimate nature, you will be able to rest in it without distrac-tion. As was said by the Great Lord Tsongkhapa, you must have such tranquility that when your mind is at rest it is unmoving like the king of mountains, and when you send it forth it can immediately enter into any act of virtue. Eighth, without possessing the conduct that brings all of your activities to the path, there is no way to practice Dharma. The general meaning of such conduct is that everything you do is"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Twelve Indispensable Things 103 performed with virtuous motivation, virtuous aspiration, vir-tuous attitude, and virtuous perception. For example, when practitioners are walking up a mountainside they would gen-erate the aspiration, \"May all sentient beings ascend the path to complete liberation.\" When walking down, they would think, \"May all buddhas emanate from the dharmakaya in form bod-ies and bring all sentient beings to liberation.\" When walking along a road, they would think, ''May all sentient beings traverse the correct and proper path without obstacles.\" When lighting a fire, they would think, \"May the fire of wisdom burn the de-filements of all sentient beings.\" All such motivations and prac-tices connected with daily activities can be found in the sutras of the mahayana. The particular meaning with respect to secret mantra is that throughout all activities you should maintain the awareness of yourself as the deity, sound as mantra, and all mental events as the display of wisdom. Through such con-duct everything you do becomes meaningful and is brought to the path. Ninth, unless you receive and actually implement instruc-tions that will enable you to overcome obstacles to practice--not leaving them as mere words-there is no way to do the practice successfully. This refers to instructions that will enable you to transcend impediments and adverse conditions, tran-scend the seduction of Mara, and recognize and avoid sources of error or corruption in practice. It is especially important that when you receive such instructions you actually put them into practice. Leaving instructions as mere words means to receive instructions from a teacher, memorize them, and repeat them to others, but never make any use of them. Tenth, there is no way to attain the result or to make practice meaningful without possessing the great confidence that will make you happy at the time of separation of your mind and body. Great confidence comes from making good use of the opportunity to practice. This means that, having obtained a precious human body, you have exerted yourself in hearing,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 The Instructions of Gampopa contemplation, and rrteditation, you have performed benefit directly and indirectly for others, and you have acquired and made use of a pure path. Because you have the confidence that comes from this, should you die at any moment, which might happen, the possibility does not frighten you. This is similar to the feeling of someone who could be driven into exile from his or her country or place of residence at any moment, but knows that the place of exile is somewhere where there are friends, property, and money that can be used to survive. Such a per-son is not really worried about what will happen. The best form of this confidence comes from the realization of mahamudra, in which case you know that when you die the path clear light-the realization you have gained through your practice-will mix with the ground clear light, which is the fun-damentally present clear light that arises in the awareness of someone who has just died. You know that these will mix in the manner of a child jumping into the lap of its mother, and that when that occurs, you will immediately attain the state of unity, the state of Vajradhara. If you do not have such assur-ance, then, as the next best form, it is sufficient to have the stable confidence that you have done your utmost in the accumula-tion of merit and wisdom, and that therefore nothing can go wrong when you die. Generating such confidence that at the time of your death you are safe is the whole point of Dharma. Finally, there is no way to practice genuine Dharma without having the fruition that is the spontaneous presence within us of the three bodies. The view on which the path of practice is based is the understanding of the nature of all things. While things possess no inherent existence and are therefore said to be empty, there is a lucidity that characterizes our experience, and there is at the same time an unimpededness or unlimited variety to what we experience. That is the way things are, and it is understood through the process of having this nature pointed out at the time of instruction. The recognition of this nature is the starting point and basis for the path, which is"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Twelve Indispensable Things 105 familiarization with this nature. This leads to the result, which is the manifestation of the emptiness of all experience as the body of essential qualities or dharmakaya; the manifestation of the inherent lucidity as the body of complete enjoyment or sambhogakaya; and the manifestation of the unimpededness as the body of emanation or nirmanakaya, which is emanating in an unlimited variety of forms in order to benefit each and ev-ery sentient being in whatever way is appropriate for his or her particular situation. It is necessary to understand that the result of practice is not something that will happen automatically, because the fruition is different from our present state, but neither is it something new, because the nature of the fruition is our nature right now. The fact that it is both new and not new is indicated by the term \"spontaneous presence.\" We can say that the fruition is something new because at this point we do not experience the three bodies of full buddhahood. They are obscured by the ad-ventitious veils that have afflicted us from beginningless time. On the other hand, we cannot really say that the fruition is some-thing new, because what the three bodies really are is present in us and is merely obscured. The fruition consists of the recog-nition of the three bodies in us and the resultant removal of the obscurations. These are the eleven things without which there is no way to practice genuine Dharma."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"16 The Eleven Marks of a Holy Person The next list is the eleven marks or indications of a holy per-son. The first of these is that, no matter whether young or old, male or female, if someone has very little jealousy and very little pride then he or she is a holy or genuine individual. Second, if someone has very little desire and attachment for pleasures and possessions, and is satisfied with few and simple things, this is an indication that he or she is a holy person. Third, if someone is devoid of bragging, vanity, and arro-gance, this is a sign that he or she is a holy person. Fourth, if someone is devoid of hypocrisy and behaves ex-actly the same in public and private, this is an indication that he or she is a holy person. Hypocritical people, for example, are extremely peaceful, subdued, proper, careful, and attentive in the presence of many people, but when they are alone or with a few people they feel they can trust, they are wild, un-controlled, and undisciplined. Someone who is genuine or holy is the same no matter who is around because these qualities are naturally present in the mind of this person. Hypocritical people will look good when they are around others because they are trying to appear good, but since they do not really possess the qualities of being peaceful and subdued, they are undisciplined when no one is around."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Eleven Marks of a Holy Person 107 Fifth, when every action in which someone engages is done consciously and with prior consideration and is executed with mindfulness, this is a sign that he or she is a holy person. Sixth, if someone adheres to the view of the results of ac-tions with the same care with which we would protect our eyes, this is an indication that he or she is holy or genuine. \"Adher-ing to the results of actions\" means that since you are confident that wrongdoing leads to suffering, you abstain from all wrong-doing; and since you are confident that virtue or beneficial ac-tion leads to happiness, you protect the practice of virtue, caus-ing it to flourish and not be impaired. The degree of adhering to these two modes of conduct, avoidance and cultivation re-spectively, is compared to the amount of urgency and care with which you would try to protect your eyes if something were about to hit and damage them. Seventh, if someone makes no distinction between public and private situations in the observance of vows and samaya, this is an indication that he or she is a holy or genuine person. Such a person observes the requirements of whatever discipline has been undertaken for his or her entire life, or for whatever period of time the commitment has been made, and does so no matter who is around to see, no matter whether the conditions that would support such a discipline are present or not, and no matter whether conditions that might lead to the impairment of such a discipline are present or not. Eighth, to have no partiality with respect to sentient beings and not to differentiate between old friends and new friends is the mark of a holy person. Partiality means thinking these people or these beings are on my side and those people or those beings are on the other side, and therefore having more com-passion for some than for others. The Tibetan word sar drok means literally \"new friends,\" but it means to pay more atten-tion to new friends. When you first meet people you find them delightful, you smile at them all the time, and you are very attentive and kind to them; but as you continue to know them over a period of time, the smile starts to fade and your atten-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 The Instructions of Gampopa tiveness to their welfare starts to diminish. A holy or genuine person is the same to the people he or she associates with from the time of first being introduced to them until the last time of seeing them. Ninth, it is a sign that someone is holy or genuine if he or she does not get angry at the wrongdoing of others but is pa-tient with it. Normally, when we hear about or see people do-ing something that we feel is morally incorrect, we tend to gen-erate the attitude, \"Those people are evildoers. They are sin-ners. They are bad. Oh, they kill animals! They do this; they do that.\" You have compassion for the beings that have been harmed but not for those who did the harm. A genuine or holy person will have compassion for both, and especially for the people who are doing the evil. Tenth, it is an unmistaken mark of a holy or genuine person when someone gives all profit and victory to others and takes all loss and disaster upon himself or herself. Finally, and in summary, if the manner of thinking or the intention with which someone acts, and the manner of acting, are totally different from and superior to the usual mundane way of things, this is a mark of a holy or genuine person. These are the eleven indications or marks of a holy person. It is not so much the case that by these eleven signs you can determine who else is a holy person, but if you apply them to yourself, you can figure out pretty quickly whether you are holy or not. Sometimes people say, \"I do not know if I really want to attain buddhahood or not. Are you a buddha? What is it like?\" There is nothing wrong with that question. It makes a great deal of sense, because, aside from the word \"buddha\" or sangye, we do not really know much about it. We do not know what the word means, what the qualities of a buddha are, or what exactly the path that leads to buddhahood consists of. The function of this type of instruction is to give you some idea of what qualities actually make a buddha so great, what is the nature of the path, and what exactly is happening to some-one who is on that path. If you do not know anything about"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Eleven Marks of a Holy Person 109 these things-what the result is or what the path is-then of course you will not have any confidence in the path and you will not have any idea whether you want to take that journey. However, if through this kind of instruction you generate a confident understanding of what happens on the path, what the result is, and why a buddha is supreme among beings, then you will naturally develop a great interest in going through that process."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"17 The Ten Things of No Benefit The next list is the ten things of no benefit. What this means is that there is no final or lasting benefit in these things. The first of these is that no matter how much service you render to this illusory body, it is impermanent and certain to be destroyed, and therefore there is no ultimate benefit in it. No matter how much attention you pay to your appearance, your clothing, your physical situation, or the care of your body, at some time your body and mind will be separated, and all that you have done to your body to preserve it will no longer have any effect and will not determine what experiences you un-dergo. Obviously this is not to say that eating the proper food and protecting yourself from sickness is of no benefit, because while you are alive you must do these things. The point is that they are not of lasting benefit because eventually your mind and body will be separated. The second thing that is of no benefit is greed or covetous-ness for possessions, wealth, and so forth. No matter how at-tached you are to beautiful, luxurious things or to any kind of possessions, no matter how much you would like to acquire things you see that are possessed by other people, and no"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 111 matter whether or not you acquire them, when you die you will go naked and with empty hands. Therefore there is no ul-timate benefit in these things. The third thing that is of no benefit is the work you do on your home. No matter how much time you spend on houses, palaces, or castles, and no matter how much work and auster-ity goes into their construction and maintenance, when you die you will go alone without your house, your castle, or your pal-ace, and even your corpse will be thrown out the door. At the time of your death these things are of no use. This does not refer to temples, because by building or helping to build a place where people practice you help others to generate merit, and therefore accumulate merit for yourself that stays with you. Fourth, no matter how many things you give to your chil-dren and nephews and nieces, and no matter how loving you are to them, at the time of your death they will not be able to protect you or lengthen your life, so there will be no lasting effect to this. What is beneficial at the time of your death is activity that generates virtue and accumulates merit such as offerings and practice and so forth. Fifth, no matter how much you love your family and friends, and no matter how much you try to please them, when you die you die alone, and at that time there is no benefit to what you have done or the attachment you have had for them. Sixth, no matter how many children, nephews, nieces, and so forth you have, your relationship with them is imperma-nent. They will never be content no matter how much you do for them and no matter how much you give them, so that is of no benefit. Eventually the children and younger family mem-bers to whom you may have become so attached will leave you. No matter how much you try to do for them, even if you give them your most treasured possessions, it will never be enough for them, and it will never mean as much to them to receive these things as it means to you to give them."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112 The Instructions of Gampopa Seventh, no matter how much land you acquire with the aim of holding it for this life, no matter what position you acquire in the community, such ~s being a government official, no mat-ter how much authority you acquire and how much work you do to acquire it, when you die your connection to that commu-nity and to the land that was yours is finished, so it is of no benefit. Saying these things are of no benefit means that attach-ment to these things is harmful and fixation on these things is harmful. If, on the other hand, you practice and cultivate Dharma, that is of benefit. Eighth, if you enter into the door of Dharma through receiv-ing ordination, taking empowerments, undertaking practices, and so forth, but do not practice or conduct yourself in accor-dance with Dharma, then by means of this unfulfilled involve-ment in Dharma you will throw yourself into the lower realms, so there is no benefit. You might become involved in practice through peer pressure or through knowing people who are in-volved in it-that is, for social reasons-and, not really ear-nestly wishing to practice, you might be unable to keep the commitments you have made. Therefore you return to mun-dane activities and violate the vows and samaya you have as-sumed, which is a cause of a lower birth. Ninth, if you have trained your mind in hearing and con-templation and as a result know a great deal, but have not prac-ticed, no matter how much you know about Dharma, at the time of death there will be nothing at your disposal with which to bring the experience of death to the path, and therefore all that you know will be of no benefit. If you do not have the confidence and the ability to contend with the situation of death that comes from having actually practiced, having cultivated the qualities of the path, accumulated merit, and removed obscurations, then at the time of death you will be terrified and agonized and will not be able to contend with it in any way. No matter how much you know, even if you understand what the"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 113 benefits of the practices are, just knowing the benefits will not help. You must have reaped those benefits. Finally, no matter how long you remain in the presence of an authentic teacher, if you have no faith in or respect for that teacher, you will not acquire the qualities or receive the bless-ings of the teacher, and therefore it is of no benefit. These are the ten things that are of no lasting benefit. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q: In the fourteen things that are totally useless, the fourth was to know a lot about the Dharma if such knowledge does not lead to abandoning the four root violations of moral conduct. What are the four root violations of moral conduct? A: The text says that to know a great deal of Dharma and yet for it not to be a remedy for the false imputation of an inher-ently existent self and for it not to lead to the abandonment of the four roots is useless. The four roots are the four actions that lead to the complete eradication of any of the three forms of individual liberation ordination. They are: to kill, to take what is not given, to engage in improper sexual conduct, and to pre-tend to have superhuman powers-meaning to lie about spiri-tual attainments. There are, as you may know, three types of individual lib-eration ordination: that of a genyen or lay disciple, a getsul or novice, and a gelong or fully ordained monk or nun. In the case of a genyen, the third root, improper sexual conduct, means adultery or logyem. In the case of a tsang cho genyen or celibate lay disciple, a getsul, or a gelong, it means any sexual activity whatsoever. Those are the four roots. In regard to Dharma becomjng a remedy for ego-clinging, this means that the practice of Dharma should serve to help us come to the recognition that there is no inherently existent self,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114 The Instructions of Gampopa and at the same time, to help us abandon or work through the habit of imputing the existence of such a self. If Dharma prac-tice does not do these two things-serve as an antidote to ego-clinging and help us avoid these four types of actions-then it is said to be useless. Q: Did you say under the things to be known, in number six, that the longer karma takes to ripen the more weight it has? A: Not necessarily, because there are two situations that come into this. One is that if a tremendously powerful negative ac-tion is performed, it is likely to mature very quickly, possibly in this same life or in the life immediately after; so in that case, it is not true that the sooner it matures the less heavy the ripen-ing will be. The other is when a practitioner who has cultivated compassion gets ill or experiences some relatively minor rip-ening of previous karma and makes the aspiration, \"May all my other negative karma be experienced right now, in the con-text of this situation, and may all the negative karma of all sen-tient beings be experienced by me right now.\" On the basis of that unpleasant experience, karma is being purified, which pre-vents it from being experienced in the future. But this is not so much because the experience itself is a minor result of an ac-tion that itself might yield something greater, but because on the basis of that action, the practitioner is making an aspiration and generating an attitude that in itself purifies karma. Q: In relation to that, if we wish that all our bad karmic results come to fruition, say, right now or in this lifetime, because we want them out of the way, does that mean we are asking for it? We could get very, very sick. A: If you make the aspiration, \"May all the negative karma that I would otherwise have to experience in the future be experi-enced right now,\" it will neither increase nor decrease the actual circumstances of suffering that you have to undergo. If you are suffering from a specific sickness, and make that"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 115 aspiration, it will not remove the physical sickness, and it will not cause a lot of other disasters to start happening. What it will do is strengthen your mind in the ability to accept suffer-ing, so in that sense it will remove your real suffering, your real misery. Normally, the ideas of suffering, misery, sickness, and death are very depressing and generate a great deal of aver-sion. If you were to go to someone and say, \"You are going to get sick and you are going to die,\" the person would get angry and would not be happy, so there is some effort involved in accepting sickness and suffering. The point at which a lot of adverse conditions can arise for practitioners is when they attain the first bodhisattva level, at which point they become \"noble ones\" or aryas. In the lifetime in which they attain the first bodhisattva level they will un-dergo a lot of adverse conditions, such as sicknesses and ob-stacles and so forth. The reason is that when such people die, from the succeeding life onwards, they are not really in samsara in the fullest sense, because they have attained so much that they will not experience manifest suffering any more. So in or-der to transcend it, they have to go through it all very fast, and this happens automatically. They experience a lot of, from their point of view, minor causes of suffering and purify all the re-maining karma. Q: From the Buddha's point of view there is no past, present, and future. Therefore, ultimately there is no past, so is it pos-sible to change the past? Are all the events happening around us attributable to karma? What is the place for free will? A: The state of buddhahood is not a composite thing. It is not made up of different things coming together, and therefore it is not impermanent and cannot be divided. There is no distinc-tion of past, present, and future within the state ofbuddhahood itself, because the three times are a process of change, and only apply to impermanent, changeable things. Ultimately, the idea of the three times, of there being an inherently existent past,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"116 The Instructions of Gampopa present, and future, is deceptive, since these are not inherently existent but only relative. The concepts past, present, and fu-ture have no ultimate validity; they have only conventional validity. It is definitely true that our basic situation-how we experi-ence the world, the type of senses and bodies we have, and so forth-results from our previous actions, from our previous karma. In that sense, we cannot change our basic situation. For example, as human beings we experience the world in a cer-tain way. We experience what we call fire as fire, we experience water as water, and so forth. We cannot change that within the context of this life. We cannot change fire to water. Fire will always bum us if we put our hands in it, and so forth. How-ever, you can make moral choices, and the moral choices you make, such as abstaining from that which is harmful and prac-ticing that which is virtuous, do affect your future. You always have choice, and therefore some degree of free will, within the limits of your established perceptions. Those limitations are imposed upon you by your previous karma. However, you can change your future perception and therefore your future limi-tations by your actions in the present. Q: Concerning the list of ten things of no final benefit, you said that there is no final benefit in building a house, but you made an exception for building monasteries, in that there is merit to building monasteries. I was wondering whether the merit that one achieves in building monasteries continues after death, or whether it is similar to the rest of the list of ten and also ends upon death. A: It benefits you in this life; we have a nice place to meet! Ac-tually, it depends upon the intention of the individual involved in the work. If, in building a monastery, your intention is to establish a comfortable and pleasant situation for yourself, then your intention is to benefit yourself, and you will not accumu-late any merit that will last beyond this life. But if your inten-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 117 tion is to create a place where images of the Buddha, texts, and so forth can be established as objects of people's veneration and bases for their instruction, so that they can accumulate merit, and especially if you build it with the intention that it be a place where as many people as possible can be involved in hearing, contemplation, and meditation on the Dharma, then you have a pure intention. With that pure intention and the pure application of that intention to the building of the monas-tery, a great deal of merit can be accumulated; and this results in the purification of previous wrongdoing and in the experi-ence of the result of merit, which will most often be in a future life. However, it can happen that merit accumulated in this life is of such intensity that it fully matures in this life. Q: If intention is the key, could one not build a house or a boat or even a baseball park with the intention of helping others, and would that not have a similar effect? A: If you build your house, thinking, \"I am building this house so that I have a place where I can practice, and I will make use of the house to help other people come in contact with the Dharma,\" and that is really your intention, then of course you can accumulate merit that will last. What is spoken of in the text is building houses and residences and so forth out of at-tachment, aversion, and bewilderment, which is different. As far as boats are concerned, of course, if you are building a boat and your intention is that it be of help to sentient beings, then you accumulate merit. As far as ball parks are concerned, if you build a ball park and your whole intention is to cause hap-piness and pleasure to others, then you will accumulate some merit. However, in that example, the place you build is basi-cally where people can go to become more distracted, so you would not accumulate the same merit that you would in creat-ing an environment where people can engage in the pure prac-tice of Dharma, such as a monastery."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"118 The Instructions of Gampopa Q: In regard to the accumulation of merit, sometimes we re-ceive newsletters from the monastery or from Buddhist groups saying that if you donate money or do a certain action, you will accumulate much merit. Should we have the attitude, \"Oh good, then I will have more that I can dedicate?\" It has often bothered me to look at something that seems to be a good idea and then to read at the bottom, \"Plus you are going to get lots of merit.\" That sort of spoils it, because it reinforces the idea of accumulation for self. A: Well, I cannot say that to make offerings to a monastery in order to accumulate merit is an impure motivation. We have to be realistic, and as beginners, not everyone has the complete motivation of bodhicitta. No matter how elevated or pure a practitioner you are, you still do benefit from your daily prac-tice, the recitations and so forth that tame your mind. Espe-cially in a period of training, the first person to be benefited really is yourself. When people get sick, they make offerings and request blessings and so forth to alleviate the sickness, and there is nothing wrong or ignoble about that. It is hard to completely abandon any concern for our own benefit at the beginning. From the point of view of the cultivation of bodhicitta, the most perfect motivation is to do everything with the intention of only benefiting others, and not to care at all about our own benefit. That is the best possible intention, but beginners can-not always generate it. It depends upon how far they have gone in the cultivation of bodhicitta. If such an appeal for money for building a monastery or something like that is sent out, then people who have bodhicitta will be inspired by the thought of making offerings to the monastery. They will make those offer-ings, if they can, because they have bodhicitta, and they will naturally dedicate the merit to all sentient beings, so promis-ing them merit does not prevent them from doing that. Many"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 119 people that the appeal will reach are not particularly intense practitioners. No matter what the appeal says, it will not in-stantly transform the motivation of such people to bodhicitta, but the promise of merit might appeal to them, so I cannot say that there is anything wrong with that. Of course, trying to ac-cumulate merit without dedicating it is not the final or ulti-mate motivation. Q: Do you get more merit by practicing with other people than alone? A: Yes, definitely. You accumulate more merit by practicing with other people, because when many people practice together, each person accumulates the benefit of one person multiplied by the number of people that are there. For example, if ten people prac-tice together, each experiences ten times the amount of benefit he or she would experience through practicing alone. It is said that this is the same with negative actions as well. If one group makes war on another group, and one person within one group kills one person within the other group, each person in the kill-ing group accumulates the karma of that killing. So if many kill many, then each person accumulates a lot. This is taught in the chO ngon pa, the abhidharma. Q: My question relates to the first two of the ten deviations, relating to faith and intelligence. When I was young, I found it very easy and natural to have faith in things and in myself; but after I grew older, I did not have much faith in things such as medicine, the government, or myself for that matter. Seeing the Dharma, listening to its teachings, and practicing it, I found that it made sense to me as an intellectual. I want to know if there is a difference between having trust in the Dharma and having faith in the Dharma, and also I want to know how we can arouse faith in ourselves toward the path, toward the Dharma, toward the teacher, and toward this text."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"120 The Instructions of Gampopa A: It is a good sign that you had a naive faith when you were a child, because it indicates a positive disposition. But it is also a very good sign that as you matured, with your growing in-sight, you examined things and you lost that naivete. You should not be in any way alarmed by the loss of innocence. Then, as far as the difference between faith and trust is con-cerned, the function of intelligence from a Dharmic point of view is to be able to see defects and qualities clearly, and to be able to distinguish between what is to be accepted and what is to be rejected. The way to make use of intelligence is to exam-ine every aspect of the Dharma step by step, and then you can trust what you have proven to yourself to be valid through that examination. This is different from the kind of naive faith that you experienced when you were a child, because this trust is based on, and only proceeds as far as, what you have deter-mined to be valid through applying your intelligence. Basically, the reason this is possible, and why there is valid-ity to the application of a developed insight or intelligence, is that the mind of any one of us has in its nature the capacity or inherent potential to generate all positive qualities and any-thing good that is imaginable. The difference between our minds at different times, and the difference between the minds of dif-ferent people, depends upon the situation, and what is con-tained in their minds. In our minds we have both positive quali-ties, such as love and compassion, and negative ones, such as mental afflictions and ignorance. It is important to make use of the inherent intelligence of your mind to examine carefully everything that you have to deal with, the way you examine substances to determine whether they are medicine or poison. Having examined such substances, you accept the medicine and avoid the poison. When coming into contact with Dharma, you examine it in detail and with great care, and then, just as you would determine a medicine to be useful and not poison-ous, bit by bit you will come to trust those aspects of Dharma that you have proven to yourself to be valid. This not only gives"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 121 you confidence in the Dharma, it also exercises and develops the intelligence with which you can analyze Dharma. Having done that, you can practice, and the practice is based upon this faith or trust you develop in the Dharma. This trust is based upon intelligence and application, and it is different from the innocent or naive trust of a child, which is based on an absence of experience. It is not based on any examination and there is no certainty in the depth of it. Attempting to main-tain a naive faith without examination will lead to failure, be-cause the trust of a child will change; whereas trust that is de-veloped on the basis of your own validation of Dharma through your own reasoning will not change, because it has been proven. Thus, the way to deal with your situation is simply to listen to and contemplate the Dharma, and to engage in the process of study and analysis. Q: One of the deviations you mentioned yesterday was that if you do not immediately put into practice your understanding of Dharma, your desire to use it becomes less and less and your inspiration becomes jaded or tired. If that happens, how does one rekindle the inspiration? More specifically, when I first took refuge, the four thoughts-the precious human birth, imper-manence, karma, and samsara-were very inspiring and very strong motivations for me, but now, somehow they do not give me the same inspiration. A: The solution to becoming jaded about Dharma is to exam-ine yourself honestly. The most important thing is to look at your own mind and examine your own situation, because if you see that you are becoming callous or insensitive to Dharma, then the recognition of that will lead to removing the defect. For example, if you are walking somewhere and all of a sud-den you see in front of you an abyss or a raging fire into which you might fall, just seeing it will make you step back and avoid it."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 The Instructions of Gampopa Q: My wife and other people that I have encountered recently have very severe reservations about participating in ritual and puja. They may be willing to listen to teachings, they may be willing to meditate, but they are not interested in puja or ritual. How should I deal with this situation, and what is the purpose of ritual and puja in Buddhism? A: It is very good when someone, for example your wife, likes to hear teachings and likes to meditate. The only reason that someone who likes those things does not like ritual and prac-tices that make use of different kinds of elements is that they do not see any point to it. They do not understand what the benefits of such things are, and so, of course, they have no re-spect for them, and just think, \"What use is all that ritual?\" The reason for these practices is that whatever we do in the world, whatever wrongdoing and virtue we perform, we do with the body, speech, and mind. We do things, we say things, and we think things. Especially, we have been engaging in physical wrongdoing, verbal wrongdoing, and mental wrong-doing over a period of time that has no beginning. To reverse that habitual tendency and remove the obscuration of those actions, it is necessary to cultivate virtue with the same three faculties: with body, with speech, and with mind. For example, we cultivate virtue with body by performing circumambulation and prostrations, with speech by the recitation of mantras and supplications, and with mind by the cultivation of loving-kind-ness, compassion, and so forth. If you want to get somewhere you actually have to walk, which involves using your legs; you cannot just sit there and imagine it. Likewise, in practice you have to make use of every aspect of yourself. Nevertheless, even though someone may not appreciate the value of ritual and practices that make use of physical and verbal elements, it is still very good that they are open to the ideas and concepts of Dharma and the practice of meditation."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 123 Q: How do you avoid falling into the formless realm, and what is it? Is it a hell realm? It sounds terrifying, actually. A: We are not in the slightest danger of being reborn in the formless realm, because the only possible cause for rebirth in the formless realm is to have absolutely perfect tranquility, such that you see all worldly pleasures as your enemies and have complete and absolute disgust for everything, and you live in total solitude, in a state of complete and utter absorption with-out any kind of conceptuality whatsoever. The formless realm is not really a place or a specific thing; it is an experience that happens. When someone like that dies, the person undergoes an experience, and if you can describe it as happening in a place, the person remains where he or she dies. It is an experience with absolutely no pleasure and abso-lutely no suffering, and because there is no pleasure and no suffering, it is an experience of total tranquility, and it lasts for an extremely long time-many, many kalpas. There are two problems with it. One is that when the merit or the momentum of the previous meditation that generated that experience is finally exhausted, even though it does take a very long time, the person is reborn again in some other form of life where there is suffering. The second problem is that if it happens acci-dentally to extremely advanced practitioners who slip into that kind of absorption, it is a tremendous obstacle to the practice of Dharma, because it delays them for so long. Q: Concerning the list in which you differentiated between authentic teachers and charlatans of various sorts, I was won-dering what the point of that teaching was, and how you would reconcile that with two things you said earlier. The first is that sometimes the people who are the worst to us can be our best teachers because they show us either obstacles to our minds or different aspects of ourselves; and the second is the tantric view of seeing all situations and all people as our own guru."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124 The Instructions of Gampopa A: The advice to distinguish carefully between authentic teach-ers and charlatans is for those at the beginning of the path, at the point where they have to choose a teacher. At the begin-ning of the path you do not know anything, and you definitely need the instruction and advice of someone authentic. Also, at the beginning of the path you do not have the power to take enemies as teachers, to see the aggression of others as an ex-hortation to realization, and so forth. Having received instruc-tion from a genuine teacher, when you practice his or her in-structions, you then need to be able to bring to the path what-ever adverse conditions occur; so the second piece of advice, to regard all enemies and obstructers as teachers, is given to guide the perception and conduct of individuals engaged in intense practice who have to contend with adverse conditions. Thus, this advice applies at a different time. Also in the teachings of secret mantra it is said that the view of an advanced practitioner should be that of seeing everything as the mandala of the guru, or boundless purity and equality. This refers to a level of practice in which, having recognized the nature of your mind as wisdom, you recognize everything you experience as the display of the lucidity of that wisdom. This is something that really only applies and happens to quite advanced practitioners. Q: As beginning practitioners, it is difficult to know our own intentions, so how are we to figure out the intentions of others, especially charlatans or advanced teachers who are way be-yond us? A: When I say ''beginner\" here, I do not mean someone who has never seen a text of Dharma or has never heard of Dharma. I mean someone who has generated a certainty about the va-lidity and value of Dharma, someone who, through the influ-ence of friends, through reading books, or some such means or combination of means, has come to recognize the qualities of Dharma, what Dharma means, and what the benefits of it are."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 125 A person in that position has some ability to make decisions about his or her own education. The next step is to find a teacher, and when you first meet a teacher it is important to examine the teacher, to listen to what he or she says and to see if it makes sense and is helpful, to watch how the teacher acts and see if it seems to be appropriate. It was said by the eminent teacher Paltrul Rinpoche, \"In the beginning be skillful in examining the lama.\" At the beginning, before you enter into a relationship with a teacher, you have to examine to see if the teacher is genuine or not. However, once you have taken on someone as a teacher, once you have re-ceived Dharma instructions and empowerment from that teacher, and have taken samaya vows with respect to that teacher, then you have to continue to rely upon him or her. If you examine your teacher and see a defect at that point, you run into the danger of violating your samaya. Paltrul Rinpoche also said, \"In the middle be skillful in relying on the lama.\" Q: If you do find a teacher to be a charlatan, and you have a samaya vow with that teacher, then since this is not a legiti-mate teacher, would that mean the samaya vow is not legiti-mate to begin with? A: First of all the bestowal of authentic empowerment is not something easy. In order to bestow empowerment you must have received not only the empowerment and the transmis-sions, but also the complete instructions for the meditation and practices connected with the empowerment, and as well, the complete instructions for giving the empowerment and related matters. Then you must have practiced all of these. The prac-tice consists of three types of extensive accumulations of man-tra, which are called \"the three measures of approach to real-ization.\" These are measuring the approach by number-how many mantras; measuring the approach by time-how long spent in retreat; and measuring the approach by signs or indi-cation of realization."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126 The Instructions of Gampopa Of these three the main one for someone who is going to give empowerment is signs or indication. In order to give em-powerment one has to have actually experienced the specific signs connected with the realization of the specific deity and practice. Then, having gone through this process, one is allowed to perform empowerment, consecration, the fire offering, and so forth, provided that in addition one receives the specific in-structions and authorization to do so from the lineage holder who possesses that particular teaching. Anyone who has gone through this entire process is not a charlatan. On the other hand, if someone gives empowerments because he or she is clever and knows how to read the text and can figure out what to do, whether or not the person actually has the empowerment or has the authorization of the lineage, and if you take an empowerment in that situation, then I cannot say that you actually have samaya vows. For example, if I hand you an empty cup and I say, \"Have some tea,\" and you go through the motions of drinking, there is nothing in the cup, so I cannot say that you have had any tea. However, even in such a situation, because the motions have been gone through and the words have been said, and because you were undertaking the process of empowerment, whatever the other person was doing, you have made a connection at least in form, so I cannot say that you do not have samaya vows. It is a very difficult process and I cannot say one way or the other. However, practically speaking, when people have entered into a relationship with a teacher and subsequently decide that their teacher is a charlatan, usually it seems to be the projection of their own impure motivation. The problem is that in the sec-tion of the text that deals with things that are easy to mistake for each other, it really means for each other. The mistake could go either way. Just as it is possible to mistakenly see a charlatan as a siddha, it is equally possible to mistakenly see a siddha as a charlatan, so one has to watch out for both errors."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Ten Things of No Benefit 127 Q: If someone has golden light above his head, does that mean he will certainly be reborn in the pure land? A: I do not know. It is possible, I suppose, that having golden light shining above your head could be a sign of having re-ceived the blessings of the compassion of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, because it is possible for different kinds of expe-riences or indications to occur as a result of receiving these bless-ings. But I cannot say and I have not seen it written anywhere that having golden light shining above your head is a certain indication of rebirth in Sukhavati, the pure land. However, it sounds like something positive, because some-times things like this do happen. The previous incarnation of Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche passed away in 1959 in Sikkim, and the day he passed away, all the people in the area saw the entire country to be golden in color. No one except the people in his house knew he was passing away that particular day. People found out afterwards that at the time when they experi-enced the golden color, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche was pass-ing into peace."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"18 The Ten Ways of Accomplishing Your Own Disaster Next are the ten situations of accomplishing your own disas-ter. The first of these is when a single Dharma practitioner mar-ries and then finds that there is no opportunity to practice be-cause of the responsibilities that go with that, such as raising children and so forth. Such a living situation, rather than being supportive to practice, becomes an obstacle to Dharma prac-tice and a source of rebirth in the lower realms. This is similar to a foolish person eating strong poison because he or she likes the color or smell of it. The second situation of accomplishing your own disaster is when someone has attained a human existence with the opportunity to practice Dharma, and then does not practice but engages in wrongdoing. This is like an insane person jump-ing off a cliff. Insanity here is a metaphor for the situation of not practicing Dharma when you have the opportunity to do so, and jumping off a cliff is a metaphor for engaging in wrongdoing. The third way of accomplishing your own disaster is to vio-late your vows and samaya, and then on top of that become a charlatan who deceives others and pretends to be a genuine teacher. This is like eating poisoned food, which might tempo-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Ten Ways of Accomplishing Your Own Disaster 129 rarily alleviate hunger, but will also cause death. Likewise, you may deceive others, thinking that in the short run this will be of some help, but in the long run, you will only accomplish your own disaster. The fourth situation is for someone of little intelligence to become the director of a monastic or secular community. This is like forcing a very old person who can hardly move to guard cattle. This situation refers to someone without the ability to direct an organization or community in a beneficial and skill-ful way. The fifth way of accomplishing your own disaster is not to be diligent in the accomplishment of benefit for others through an excellent motivation, but instead to exert yourself in the ac-complishment of your own aims through the motivation of the eight things of the world-desire for praise and acquisition and so forth. This is like a blind person wandering around in the wilderness or in a vast desert. By not engaging in that which benefits others with a good motivation, you have no opportu-nity to accumulate merit. On top of that, by engaging in that which would seem to benefit yourself with acquisition, gain, praise, and so forth as your motivation, you will not accom-plish any good for yourself in this life, and you will accumu-late the cause for tremendous suffering in future lives. In a simi-lar way, a blind person who is thrust into the middle of a desert or a wilderness has no way to find his or her destination. Sixth, to undertake a great and difficult endeavor that you have no way of accomplishing, and to commit yourself to this, is accomplishing your own disaster. It is like a very weak per-son trying to carry an extremely heavy burden. Seventh, to disregard through arrogance the instructions or advice of an authentic teacher and the recorded instructions and advice of the Buddha is accomplishing your own disaster. This is like a powerful leader not listening to wise counselors. As an illustration of this, a long time ago there was a particular monastery in eastern Tibet, in Kham. In the same region as the monastery there was a powerful nobleman who was not"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 The Instructions of Gampopa particularly associated with the monastery in any way. He was having a quarrel with the imperial Chinese government, and they were preparing to invade his territory. The monastery was quite powerful in the region, so this lord appealed to its lead-ers and said, \"Will you support me in my struggle with the imperial government?\" The monastic council discussed this request, and most members said, \"No, we should not get in-volved in this dispute. It is not really our business.\" But one very powerful and outspoken member of the monastic council said, \"We should help this nobleman because then if he wins he will be in our debt. We will be able to spread our influence into his territory and he will be under us.\" He was so strong in his argument that they were swayed by him and supported the nobleman. As it happened, the Chinese won, and they destroyed not only the nobleman's territory but the monastery as well, because the monastery had supported him. That is an illustra-tion from long ago of this type of situation. The eighth way of accomplishing your own disaster is if, having studied and contemplated the Dharma, you do not prac-tice it but instead procrastinate and wander among the habita-tions of people. This is like a wild animal that does not stay in the mountains where it is safe, but wanders into the regions of humans and is therefore killed. Ninth, having received an introduction to or pointing out of natural wisdom from your teacher, not to foster this through practice, but to be diverted by the elaboration of distraction, is accomplishing your own disaster. This is like being a bird with a broken wing. Just as a bird with a broken wing still has wings, you still have received the introduction, the pointing out, but the power of it has been broken by your involvement in distraction. Tenth, carelessly consuming the possessions and wealth of your guru and the Three Jewels will accomplish your own di-saster. This is like a small child who sees a burning ember in"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Ten Ways of Accomplishing Your Own Disaster 131 the fire and, attracted by the red color, grabs it and puts it in his or her mouth. This means to take things that are offered to sup-port teachers and the monastic community, and consume them for the sake of enjoyment and luxury. Those are ten situations of accomplishing your own disaster."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"19 The Ten Things That Are Great Kindnesses to Yourself Then come ten situations of great kindness to yourself. First, to abandon attachment and aversion for the things of this world and to practice genuine and pure Dharma is a great kindness to yourself, because in doing so you will bring about your own liberation, which is the ultimate and final accomplishment of your own benefit. Second, to remain single and to abandon friends and family, relying instead upon holy or genuine individuals, is a great kindness to yourself. Third, to abandon distraction and engage instead in hear-ing, contemplating, and meditating is a great kindness to your-self. Even when you are attending upon or in the presence of an authentic teacher, it is possible that you might still devote yourself to subduing enemies and pleasing your friends. To abandon all these distractions and meaningless activities and to put the instructions into actual practice through hearing, contemplation, and meditation is a great kindness to yourself. Fourth, to abandon too much familiarity with people through living with them and being subjected to their whims, and in-stead to abide alone in solitude is a great kindness to yourself."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Ten Things That Are Great Kindnesses to Yourself 133 Fifth, abiding in solitude will not work if you are still at-tached to all the things that you are without. Thus, when abid-ing in solitude, to cut through attachment to pleasures and de-sirable things and to abide in a stable state of nonattachment is a great kindness to yourself. Sixth, in that situation you have to be satisfied with enough clothing so that you do not freeze and enough food so that you do not starve. To be satisfied with what is barely sufficient and to have no interest in or desire for fine things is a great kind-ness to yourself. Seventh, by not surrendering your independence and the choice of your actions of body, speech, and mind to another, to allow your practice to be stable and unimpeded is a great kind-ness to yourself. This does not mean that you cannot cooperate with other people or give and receive benefit from them; it means that in the context of practice, when you have what you need, you should not surrender your independence to anyone else. Eighth, to pay no attention to the ephemeral pleasures of this life but earnestly to accomplish the awakening that is per-manent happiness is a great kindness to yourself. Ninth, in the context of practice, to abandon all fixation on the apparent solidity of experienced things and to cultivate the realization of emptiness is a great kindness to yourself. Tenth, when abiding in solitude, not to allow your body, speech, and mind to slip into ordinariness but to exert yourself in the unified accomplishment of the two accumulations is a great kindness to yourself. These are the ten things that are of great kindness to your-self."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"20 The Ten Perfect Things Next come the ten things that are perfect. First, to have trust in the results of actions is the perfect view for a beginner. This means to recognize that wrongdoing will lead to suffering and that virtue will lead to happiness. Second, recognizing that all inner and outer things are the unity of awareness and emptiness and the unity of appearance and emptiness is the perfect view for an intermediate practitio-ner. This refers to the view connected with the practice of the bodhisattvayana. Third, to realize that that which is viewed, the viewer, and the realization itself are indivisible or undifferentiated is the perfect view for an advanced practitioner or someone of the highest capabilities. This refers principally to the vajrayana level, but such a view can also be present in the practice of mahayana, especially during the actual meditation sessions. Fourth, to abide with a mind that is one-pointedly directed to the object of meditation, that is, to abide in a consummate state of tranquility, is the perfect meditation for a beginner. Fifth, in the same way, to abide in the samadhi (meditative absorption) that is the recognition of the four unities is the perfect meditation for an intermediate practitioner. The four"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Ten Perfect Things 135 unities are the unity of appearance and emptiness, of sound and emptiness, of bliss and emptiness, and of awareness and emptiness. Sixth, to abide in the nonconceptual state in which that on which one meditates, the meditator, and the practice are recog-nized to be indivisible is the perfect meditation of someone of the highest faculties or the most advanced practitioner. This is the supreme practice of both sutrayana and tantrayana, and it is known as not conceptualizing the three aspects of any situation. Seventh, to guard your adherence to the principle of cause and result of actions as carefully as you guard your eyes is the perfect conduct for a beginner. Eighth, to conduct yourself with the recognition that all things that you experience are like a dream or a magical illu-sion, a recognition that comes out of meditation practice, is the perfect conduct for someone of intermediate faculties or at an intermediate level, which is someone practicing the bodhisattva path. Ninth, engaging in no conduct whatsoever is the perfect con-duct of an advanced practitioner or someone of superior facul-ties. This means having no concept of what is conduct, what is not conduct, and so forth. There are two ways of understanding these three sets of three. Sometimes, people understand them as meaning that first you practice what is appropriate for a beginner; then, when you become an intermediate practitioner, you abandon that and change to the intermediate practitioner's way of doing things; and when you become an advanced practitioner, you abandon that also. This is practicing the three exclusively and sequentially. The other way of understanding it is that as a beginner, you practice what is appropriate for a beginner; then as you be-come more advanced, you continue practicing that but add to it what is suitable for an intermediate practitioner; and when"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"136 The Instructions of Gampopa you become an advanced practitioner, you continue those two practices and add to them the insight of an advanced practitio-ner. The second way of viewing these is the correct one; they are practiced sequentially but not exclusively. In other words, do not throw away the lower levels when you proceed to the higher ones. The tenth perfect thing is the progressive diminishing and pacification of all fixation on an inherently existent self, and of all mental affliction. This is the perfect, correct, and genuine sign of successful practice for someone of any of the three faculties-lesser, intermediate, or greater, or any of the three levels. These are the ten perfect things."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"21 The Ten Bewilderments of Practitioners Next come the ten bewilderments of practitioners. First, not to rely on an excellent teacher who practices Dharma properly but to rely upon a cleverly spoken charlatan is a case of ex-treme bewilderment. Second, not to search for the precious instructions of the oral lineage of siddhas but to exert yourself in the study of logic and reasoning is extremely bewildered. Third, not to be content with whatever appearances arise in the present, but to make extensive preparations for the future based on the assumption that things will remain the same, is extremely bewildered. Fourth, not to think about Dharma while living alone, but to teach it in the midst of others, is extremely bewildered. Fifth, not to use your excess wealth and possessions for of-ferings and generosity to others, but to accumulate wealth and possessions stealthily, is extremely bewildered. This means that, although you have a lot of money, you do not share any of it with other people who may not have enough food or other things, nor do you make offerings with it. When it is time to"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138 The Instructions of Gampopa make offerings or perform any act of generosity, you say, \"I don't have anything. I can't give anything. I'm sorry, I wish I could,\" and meanwhile you are accumulating a pile of money. Sixth, not to guard whatever vows and samaya you have undertaken, but to let your body, speech, and mind run wild, is extremely bewildered. This means, for example, that you have committed yourself to the practice of Dharma and to a certain discipline of conduct, but as soon as a movie comes out, you have to go and see it; if something exciting happens in town, you have to be part of it; if there is boxing on television, you have to watch it; or if there is a new place to go dancing, you have to go there the first night it opens. Seventh, not to devote your time and energy to gradual fa-miliarization with the meaning that is to be realized through practice, but to waste your life in meaningless social or politi-cal activities, is extremely bewildered. Eighth, not to tame your own mind or transcend the confu-sion that arises in your own experience, but rashly attempting to tame the minds of others, is extremely bewildered. If you do not first tame your own mind, then attempting to tame the minds of others or alleviate the bewilderment of others will not work, because you will still be so confused that you will not know how to do it, and you will probably only generate mental affliction. For example, when someone walks between two people who are fighting and tries to separate them and pacify the situation, often the person who is intervening gets angry, and then there are three people fighting instead of two. Ninth, not to foster the progressive development of quali-ties that arise through your experience of practice, such as faith, compassion, and so forth, but instead to foster the develop-ment of greatness in this life, such as a high position in a com-munity or monastery, fame, wealth and so forth, is extremely bewildered. Finally, at this time, when the necessary causes and condi-tions for the opportunity to practice Dharma are present, not to be diligent but to delight in laziness and indolence is extremely bewildered. These are the ten types of bewilderment."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"22 The Ten Necessary Things Next come ten things that are necessary. First, in the beginning, you need to have the genuine and sincere faith that is based upon fear of the sufferings of samsara, such as birth, death, and so forth, like the attitude of a deer that has escaped from the pit prepared for it by hunters. Second, in the middle stage, while practicing, you have to have the type of diligence that will leave you without guilt or fear at the time of death, like the attitude of a farmer at harvest time. Third, in the end, you need to have a happy mind that can-not die, like the attitude of someone who has just accomplished something tremendous. Fourth, in the beginning, you have to have a sense of ur-gency, like someone who has just been shot by an arrow. If you have been shot by an arrow, you do not think, \"Perhaps before I pull this arrow out, I'll have a cup of tea,\" or anything like that. Fifth, in the middle stage, you have to have a meditation that is as undistracted as the sorrow of a mother whose only child has just died. Such a mother thinks only of her sorrow night and day."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 The Instructions of Gampopa Sixth, in the end, you have to have a recognition that there is nothing to do, like cattle freed from their confines by rustlers. When people own cattle, of course, they are always milking them and doing this, that, and the other thing to them, and the cattle have a lot of work and hassles. When rustlers come along and break down the barrier confining the cattle, and the cattle can just wander around, they have a sense of freedom and release. Seventh, in the beginning, you have to have a certainty to-wards Dharma like that of a very hungry person who encoun-ters excellent food. Eighth, in the middle stage, you have to have a certainty about your own mind like that of the wrestler when he found the jewel. This refers to a fable, a story that is allegorical: Once there was a wrestler whose family had given him a diamond, which he always wore on his forehead. He had just won a wres-tling match in which he and the other wrestler had both been quite beaten up and had wounds and swellings all over their faces and heads. He was not the least bit disturbed about his wounds, but he was disturbed because he could not find his jewel, and he thought he had lost it. He went all over trying to find it, looking around the wrestling pit, but he could not find it anywhere. Then he went to a physician, who said, \"You have a lot of wounds. I had better start fixing them up.\" The wrestler said, \"I don't care about that! What I care about is that I've lost my family diamond.\" But the physician insisted on looking at the wounds, and noticed especially one big swol-len wound right on his forehead. The doctor asked, \"Now how did you lose that diamond?\" And the wrestler said, \"Well, I was butting him with my head and struggling with him.\" The doctor looked inside the swelling and found that the diamond had become stuck under the skin. He told the wres-tler, \"Here is your diamond.\" The wrestler was overjoyed when he found that he had not lost the diamond after all. His looking outside for it had been meaningless, because the diamond had"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Ten Necessary Things 141 not gone out, it had gone in and been hidden. This point refers to having the certainty that the qualities to be realized are found inside the mind and are not to be searched for outside of it. This type of brief reference to fables is quite common in Gampopa's writings, and also in some of the songs that Milarepa sang to Gampopa, which can be found in The Rain of Wisdom.22 Ninth, at the end, you have to generate a certainty about nonduality that is like exposing the deception of an impostor. It is necessary to cut through totally the false imputation of the duality of the experiencer and the experience, by determining that all experiences are unestablished as having a nature other than the experience itself. Tenth, it is necessary to have a final resolution of the mean-ing of suchness that is like a raven flying free from a cage or ship. When a raven gets out of a cage it will never return. Also, when a raven flies from a ship in the middle of the ocean, it will always return to the ship. The meaning of the first is that once suchness has been resolved, one never returns to confu-sion. The meaning of the second is that this resolution gener-ates the confidence that the thoughts that arise always return to the suchness of which they are the expression These are the ten things that are necessary."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"23 The Ten Unnecessary Things Now we come to the ten things that are not necessary. First, when you realize directly that your mind is empty, hearing and contemplation are unnecessary. Realizing that is quite differ-ent from merely understanding it. Second, when you recognize your awareness to be stainless, it is no longer necessary to purify wrongdoing. Third, when you abide in the ultimate natural path, then the intentional gathering of the accumulations is no longer neces-sary, because you have attained or are attaining the result and essence of those accumulations. Fourth, if you abide in the natural state through this having been pointed out and realized, it is not necessary to meditate using other methods. Fifth, when you recognize thoughts as suchness, it is no longer necessary to meditate on nonthought or the absence of thought. It is no longer necessary to attempt to block thought. Sixth, when the mental afflictions are recognized to be root-less and without basis, it is not necessary to rely upon their remedies. Seventh, when all appearances and sounds are realized to be like magical illusions, it is no longer necessary to attempt to"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Ten Unnecessary Things 143 cause some to cease and to attempt to accomplish others. Since everything has been realized to be of one nature there is no preference or distinction between different phenomena. Eighth, when suffering is recognized to be attainment or siddhi, it is unnecessary to search for pleasure. Ninth, if the mind is realized to be unborn, it is unnecessary at the time of death for anyone to do powa, or the transference of consciousness. Tenth, if everything you do with your body, speech, and mind is done for the benefit of others, there is no need to do anything more for your own benefit because the one is included in the other. This list of ten things that are unnecessary is directed at those with the highest view and most perfect conduct: those who have actualized the qualities of the superior path."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"24 The Ten Superior Things Next are the ten things that are especially fine or noble. First, among the six different kinds of sentient beings, a human be-ing possessing the freedoms and resources of a precious hu-man existence is the most noble. Second, among humans, most of whom have no connection with Dharma, an individual who practices Dharma is the most fine. Third, among all the vehicles of the Buddhadharma, the ul-timate essential vehicle, the true meaning, the mahamudra, is the most noble or fine. Fourth, one instant of sherab or knowledge arising from medi-tation is superior to all of the knowledge that could arise from hearing and contemplation, because the whole point of hear-ing and contemplation is to lead to meditation and realization. Fifth, one instant of noncomposite virtue, or virtue that is embraced by nonconceptuality of the doer, the recipient, and the action, is superior to all composite virtue, that is to say vir-tue performed for eons and eons with the concept of the inher-ent existence of the three aspects of a virtuous deed. Sixth, one instant of nonconceptual samadhi is superior to all the conceptual samadhis that there are. This means that one instant of the ultimate completion stage, with a total lack of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Ten Superior Things 145 any kind of fixation whatsoever, is better than all the tranquil-ity practices using different types of objects and, in the context of secret mantra, all the visualizations of deities, implements, letters, mantras, and so forth. Seventh, one instant of undefiled virtue is superior to all the defiled virtue there is. Defiled virtue means a virtuous act per-formed with the motivation of accomplishing happiness or plea-sure in this and future lives, the result of which is the matura-tion of that aim. Undefiled virtue means accomplishment of the virtue that leads to the attainments of arhats, bodhisattvas, and especially buddhas, that is, the attainments of superiors or aryas, because there are no defilements and no source of decay in their virtue. This is related to the earlier point that compared composite virtue and noncomposite virtue. Both of these can be described as causes or as results. When composite and noncomposite vir-tue are compared as causes, composite virtue is virtue with conceptuality, and noncomposite virtue is virtue that transcends conceptual fixation. When compared as results, the result for composite virtue is the pleasures of samsara and for non-composite virtue the attainment of buddhahood. In the present case, comparing defiled and undefiled virtue as cause, defiled virtue is performed with the motivation of accomplishing one's own pleasure and happiness, and undefiled virtue is performed with the motivation of accomplishing bodhicitta. The result in the case of defiled virtue is the pleasures of samsara, and in the case of undefiled virtue is awakening. Eighth, one instant of realization is superior to all the expe-riences of meditation there could be. Experiences disappear and do not necessarily leave any effect upon us, whereas one in-stant of realization changes everything forever. Ninth, one instant of nonconceptualized conduct is supe-rior to all of the conceptually devised excellent conduct there could be. Although conduct within a conceptual framework-creating and setting up images of the body, speech, and mind of the buddhas, meditating conceptually upon deities, reciting"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"146 The Instructions of Gampopa mantras, and so forth-are of great merit, one instant of abid-ing in the state that transcends all elaboration is superior. Finally, having no fixation on anything whatsoever is supe-rior to all the material generosity there is. Although material generosity that is still embraced by the incorrect concept of an inherently existent person performing the generosity, and so forth, is of tremendous merit, it cannot match the recognition that there is no inherent existence, and the total absence of fixa-tion that is generated by that recognition. These are the ten especially fine or superior things."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"25 The Ten Situations in Which Whatever Is Done Is Excellent Next are the ten situations in which, no matter what you do, it is excellent.

Because their minds have totally gone to the Dharma, such people are not prey to coarse mental afflictions. Second, for those who have cut through all misconceptions in their own minds, if they meditate it is excellent, and if they do not meditate it is also excellent. Such people have resolved that the source of all suffering is the confusion that obscures the mind, and have recognized that the nature of the mind, which is otherwise obscured, is the spontaneously present dharmakaya. Third, for those who have totally cut through all attachment or craving for pleasure, if they adopt a passionless existence, abandoning all mundane pleasures, it is excellent; and if they do not adopt a passionless existence, but abide in the midst of mundane pleasures, it is also excellent, because they have no attachment to such pleasures."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"148 The Instructions ofGampopa Fourth, for someone who has directly realized the nature of all things, it is excellent to live alone in an empty cave, and it is excellent to live as the leader of a vast community. Fifth, for someone who has recognized that all appearances are like magical illusions, it is excellent to remain alone in an isolated retreat, and it is also excellent to travel around with-out direction through all lands. Sixth, for those who have obtained complete control over their own minds, and therefore are not in any way afflicted by-or even affected by-thoughts and emotions, it is excel-lent if they abandon pleasurable sense experiences, and it is excellent if they enjoy them. Seventh, for those who possess genuine bodhicitta, if they practice alone in solitude it is excellent, and if they abide in the midst of others, performing that which is beneficial to others, it is also excellent. Eighth, for those who have unwavering devotion, such that no matter what occurs, or what conditions are present or not present, their devotion for their authentic teacher never in-creases or decreases but is always very, very strong, it is excel-lent if they live as attendants to their teacher, constantly in his or her presence; and it is fine if they do not. Ninth, for those who have heard a lot of Dharma and have actually understood it, if signs of siddhi or attainment arise in their practice it is excellent, and if obstacles arise it is also ex-cellent. Understanding the meaning of Dharma, they have no arrogance if signs arise and no fear if obstacles arise, because they recognize these both to be part of the path. Tenth, for a yogi who has attained supreme realization, it is excellent if signs of common attainment arise, and it is also ex-cellent if they do not. Common attainments are such things as extraordinary perception, the ability to bring others under our power, the ability to prolong our lives, the ability to heal our-selves of sickness, and so forth.

The first of these is quite a long list. It includes the proclamation in the world of such things as the idea of the ten virtuous actions23to be practiced by all from the beginning; the idea of the six perfections to be practiced by in-termediate practitioners; all the various presentations of emp-tiness from the hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana points of view; the ideas of the thirty-seven factors of awakening and the four noble truths; the four dhyanas24 and the four formless absorptions,25 which are common and not only Buddhist; and especially the empowerments and instructions of the vajrayana. The presence of all of these things in the world is due to the blessings of the Dharma. Second, within the human realm are high and great posi-tions, such as royal families, and high and great stations within society, such as brahmins, and many powerful situations of wealth. Within the god realm are the six realms of desire gods such as the four great kings, the seventeen realms of form, the four formless realms, and so forth. The presence of all of these states of happiness in the world is due to the accumulation of"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Ten Qualities of Genuine Dharma 151 merit by the individuals who experience them, and is therefore said to be a quality of, or due to the blessings of, the Dharma. Third, the presence in the world of those who have attained any of the four levels of the path of the hearers-stream-enterers, one-time returners, non-returners, and arhats; the presence in the world of those attaining the levels of the pratyekabuddhas or solitary realizers; and the presence in the world of omni-scient buddhas who have perfected the path of the mahayana, all arise because of the qualities of the Dharma. Fourth, within the world is the effortless and spontaneously present accomplishment of benefit for sentient beings that oc-curs for as long as samsara is not empty, by means of the natu-ral display of the compassion of buddhas in the form of the two form bodies. This is accomplished through the power of their original generation of the intention to attain supreme awakening and thereafter to establish all sentient beings in that state, and their aspiration during the path to perform activities through the form bodies that bring all sentient beings to happi-ness and awakening. The presence in the world of all this spon-taneous activity is due to the qualities of the Dharma. Fifth, all the abundant and excellent physical things that arise in the world to support, aid, and protect the lives of sentient beings arise through the power of the aspirations of bodhi-sattvas, and therefore through the qualities of the Dharma. The bodhisattvas make such aspirations as, \"May I take the form of the four elements, and in the manner of each element support and protect all sentient beings.\" Sixth, whatever slight happiness there is in the lower realms and in unrestful states arises from the virtuous merit accumu-lated by the beings in those states, and therefore arises through the qualities of the Dharma. The worst of the hell realms is Avici (or narme in Tibetan), the eighth hot hell, which is a state of uninterrupted suffering. From the point of view of Avid, the seventh hell and all the other ones above it are slightly better, in that there is slightly less suffering. The reason there is less"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 The Instructions of Gampopa suffering is that the sentient beings undergoing these experi-ences have slightly more virtue and slightly less wrongdoing in their mental cantinuums. Since it is through the power of virtue that there is the presence of comparative happiness, or less suffering, this arises through the qualities of Dharma. Seventh, when an evil person turns his or her mind to Dharma and becomes a genuine and holy person who can be respected by everyone, this is an indication of the qualities of Dharma. Eighth, when someone who has been carelessly engaging in such wrongdoing that it produces future fuel for the fires of hell, turns his or her mind towards the Dharma, and comes to bring about the experience of higher realms and liberation, this indicates the qualities of Dharma. Ninth, when someone merely has faith, interest, or delight in Dharma, or merely takes on the appearance or the costume of a practitioner, and yet by this alone becomes pleasing to ev-eryone and an object of people's respect, this indicates the quali-ties of Dharma. Finally, when someone abandons all possessions and leaves the world for a state of homelessness, living in isolated retreat, and yet spontaneously finds abundant and excellent sustenance, this is a quality of the Dharma. These ten things are the briefest possible summation of the boundless qualities of Dharma."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"27 The Ten Things That Are Merely Names Next are the ten things that are merely names. First, since the nature of the ground cannot be explained or demonstrated, ground is just a name. The nature of the ground of experience is beyond all elaboration, and therefore cannot be communicated. Therefore, any name or term applied to it is just something designating it and does not really describe it. Second, since the path is not a composite phenomenon and is therefore not something that can be divided into a traveler and traveling, path is just a name. Third, in the ultimate nature there is nothing to see and no viewer, so realization is just a name. When we say realization, we think of something new being seen, but there is not any-thing to see and there is not anyone seeing it. Fourth, in naturalness or uncontrivance, there is nothing to meditate on and no doing of meditation, so the experience of meditation is just a name. Fifth, in the ultimate nature there is no arising, cessation, or abiding, and therefore there is nothing to be done and no pro-cess of conduct, so conduct is just a name."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 The Instructions of Gampopa Sixth, since the ultimate nature of all things is free of any kind of elaboration or distinction and is not a composite, and therefore there is nothing to be guarded and no guarding, the term samaya is merely a name or convention. Seventh, ultimately there is nothing to be accumulated or added, and no accumulation, so the two accumulations is merely a name. Eighth, since ultimately there is nothing to be purified and no purification, the two obscurations-the cognitive and afflic-tive obscurations-are just names. Ninth, ultimately there is nothing to be abandoned and no process of abandonment, so samsara is just a name. Tenth, ultimately there is nothing to be attained and no at-tainment, since the fruition is spontaneously present as our true nature, so fruition is just a name. As long as we are still under the power of the habitual patterns of confusion, however, in-terdependence and the results of actions are valid and unfail-ing. For example, while we are asleep and dreaming, we still are frightened, pleased, and so forth by the appearances that arise in the dream; but when we wake up, all of the images of the dream have no further validity and are of no value. In the same way, just as the appearances are valid in the dream, so is the interdependent nature by which our confused experience is characterized. This list of ten things that are mere names is therefore con-cerned with a very high level of realization, as was the case with some earlier sections.

Second, since there is nothing in the phenomenal world that passes beyond the expanse of the nature or the ground of all things, the ground is spontaneously present as great bliss. Third, since the realization that transcends conceptual mind and is beyond the extremes of nihilism and the assertion of permanence, is without the elaborations of partiality and dis-tinction, it is spontaneously present as great bliss.

All stages of the path, from the recognition of havin6 attained the precious human existence up to the causes, conditions, nature, and qualities of supreme awakening, and the essence of all the presentations of the Buddha's teachings, both those of sutra and those of tantra, have been explained in this text. These teachings are not sim-ply Gampopa's own random composition, but are the expres-sion of his genuine realization which arose from his thorough practice, based on the complete instruction received from la-mas who were absolutely authentic and realized themselves. In this text is contained the essence of the teachings that Gampopa received from his kind gurus of the Kadampa tradition, which is the stainless transmission of the words and instructions of the glorious Atisha and his lineage, such as Geshe Dromtonpa, Geshe Chengawa, and so forth. Atisha, as Gampopa remarks in the text, was dispatched to Tibet and ap-pointed as the regent for Tibet by both his main root guru, who was known as Lord Serlingpa (which means \"the one from Indonesia\"), and his yidam, Arya Tara."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"158 The Instructions of Gampopa This text also contains the essence of the stainless speech that Garnpopa received from the king of all venerable ones, Lord Milarepa, who held the essence of the minds of all the scholars and siddhas of India, as had been transmitted by Lord Marpa. Marpa relied upon innumerable teachers, but princi-pally those as famous in India at that time as the sun and moon themselves, the supreme beings Naropa and Maitripa. Thus, the essences of these two traditions have been com-bined in the form of this text, A Precious Garland of the Supreme Path. This was done by Lord Sonarn Rinchen-Gampopa-who held the treasury of the instructions of the Kadampa coming from Serlingpa and Atisha, and the mahamudra lineage com-ing from Naropa, Maitripa, Marpa, and so on. It was said by Lord Gampopa, \"For all individuals of the future who have devotion for me and who are depressed be-cause they cannot meet me, if they will look at the texts com-posed by me, such as A Precious Garland of the Supreme Path and The Jewel Ornament of Liberation, then it will be exactly the same as meeting me.\" Therefore, all those who are fortunate enough to have devotion for Gampopa should be diligent in the use of these two treatises. Gampopa composed these two texts not so much for the benefit of the time in which he was living but for the benefit of those who would come in the future, and spe-cifically for the benefit of those who would be practicing the tradition that comes from him. That means no one other than ourselves. Further, in general it is said that if you pray to any guru of the lineage of transmission of the mahamudra, by receiving his or her blessing you will attain realization, and whatever real-ization you have will increase, but this is said to be especially true in the case of Lord Gampopa. He is to such an extent the embodiment of mahamudra that merely to think of him with any degree of devotion will spark realization in those who do not have it and increase realization instantly in those who do."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Conclusion 159 In this sense Gampopa is quite special. These two texts are his most famous works, and they are, as he said, the embodiment of all his compassion, all his wisdom, and all his ability to trans-mit the realization of mahamudra. For a very short period of time we have studied the com-paratively brief words that make up this text. I sincerely ask you please not to leave this text as mere words in your memory, but to hold the meaning of it and partake of the splendor of it with all the insight, all the diligence, and all the devotion you can muster. Because of the blessings of Lord Gampopa, if you do this, there is no doubt that you will attain buddhahood. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q: The sixth point of the ten situations in which no matter what you do it is excellent was that for someone who has attained complete control over the mind and who is not afflicted by thoughts or emotions, it is excellent either to abandon sense experiences or to enjoy them. I have been very confused by rumors and gossip about certain teachers who are deemed great, who have enjoyed sense experiences in a way that tends to go against the vows and samaya. How do we deal with that con-fusion or regard that? A: At this point we have absolutely no way to determine what is going on in the mind of anyone else, so there is no point in trying to determine whether what someone is doing is really a defect or not. All we can do is determine whether we have de-fects. In the case of teachers whose conduct you find disturb-ing, the best way to deal with it is to have total faith, because if there is something wrong it will not harm you, and if there is not something wrong, the more faith you have the better. If you cannot do that, you should at least hope for the best and not judge them so severely that there is no possibility of devel-oping any faith later on."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"160 The Instructions of Gampopa The trouble is that many siddhas and bodhisattvas of the past have acted in really strange ways, which under any other circumstance would be totally immoral, because specific sen-tient beings needed specific actions. For example, Tilopa, whom we accept as enlightened, killed a lot of fish. Now, there is nor-mally nothing worse than killing, but Tilopa had the ability to liberate those sentient beings and bring them to a higher state of existence. There would have been no way to tell that at the time. Q: Some practitioners know what will happen after death. How do we know the signs indicating that we can certainly be re-born in the pure land or become a buddha? A: Through practice. Especially, if you can get to the point that you have not so much as a hair's tip of attachment to the plea-sures of this life, to any places, people, or things, or even to your own body, then you will have confidence that when you die you can be reborn in the pure land. This confidence, which is the same thing I spoke of earlier, grows with practice. The more you practice, the more confidence you will have. Q: We spend eight hours sleeping without practicing Dharma. I think that is a waste of time. What can we do to practice Dharma during sleep? A: There are ways of doing this. Among the fifty-one mental factors described in the abhidharma, there are four that can be virtuous, non virtuous, or neutral. These are sleep, examination, understanding, and remorse. Whether your sleep is positive, negative, or neutral depends largely upon your attitude when you go to sleep. That is the most important thing. For example, if you go to sleep in a state of stupidity in which you are not thinking of anything, but are just groggy, then the sleep be-comes pure stupidity. If you go to sleep angry, your sleep will be filled with anger, and if you go to sleep in a virtuous frame of mind, your sleep will be turned to virtue."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Conclusion 161 It is recommended that before you go to sleep you perform the self-visualization of Chenrezig or Amitabha and recite the mantra very quietly and slowly, maintaining the visualization and reciting the mantra, and then relaxing and slowing down the recitation of mantra as you go to sleep. If you have confi-dence in this process, it will work and it will transform your sleep. The sign of this is that every time you wake up in the middle of the night, you will find yourself saying the mantra. If you apply mindfulness in such a way, it is definitely possible for sleep not to be a waste of time. Q: Of the two accumulations, the accumulation of wisdom and the accumulation of merit, is either one more important than the other, or .are they both equally important? A: We could say that merely from the point of view of their names, wisdom is somehow better or more important than merit. Ultimately speaking, though, in the accomplishment of buddhahood they are equally necessary. They are somewhat like the two wings of a bird. Specifically, in the accomplish-ment of dharmakaya, which is the abandonment of all defects and the ultimate benefit for oneself, the principal element is the accumulation of wisdom. In the accomplishment of the form bodies, which are the complete, continuous, and spontaneous performance of the ultimate benefit for others, the main thing is the accumulation of merit. Q: Of the ten bewilderments, I believe the third one was not to be content with what we have today but to make plans for the future, and I would like some clarification. Does this refer to practice, or is it in a material sense, such as saving money for our retirement? Also, is there a contradiction here with what Gampopa says elsewhere, that we should be concerned about our future lives? A: There is no contradiction, because when you are instructed to shorten your attitude and only think of the present, it means"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"162 The Instructions of Gampopa not to make plans in a mundane or worldly sense, not to count on what cannot be counted on; and in fact, it means to think that you might die at any moment. You should shorten your attitude with respect to mundane things, not with respect to Dharma. With respect to Dharma, you should lengthen your attitude. You should recognize that you might be dead at any moment and therefore you should consider what will happen after death; you should consider the results of actions, and so forth. Espe-cially if you have generated bodhicitta, you should even make aspirations for very far in the future, thinking, \"When I am a bodhisattva, may I perform such and such vast types of benefit for sentient beings,\" and so forth. Thus you should shorten your attitude with respect to mundane things, and lengthen it with respect to the Dharma."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Root Text THE INSTRUCTIONS OF GAMPOPA: A PRECIOUS GARLAND OF THE SUPREME PATH Translated by Lama Yeshe Gyamtso and Laura M.

Cultivation, without complacency, of the three trainings and the two accumulations is indispensable. A view that realizes the nature of all knowables is indispensable. Meditation in which the mind itself abides wherever it is placed is indispensable. Conduct in which one takes all one's actions on the path is indispensable. Practice of instructions-without leaving them as mere words-for transcending adverse conditions, obstructors, maras, and deviations are indispensable.

It is a mark of a holy person not to be angered by the wrong-doing of others, but to have patience.

Since no matter how much greed and avarice you have for possessions and wealth, you will die naked and with empty hands, there is no benefit.

Deceiving others with charlatanism is like serving poisoned food, and accomplishes one's own disaster.

The age of decadence is a period characterized by a degeneration in views and conduct. 7. The eight freedoms are not being born as: a hell being, hungry ghost, animal, barbarian, long-lived god, heretic, being in a dark age, or a mute. Of the ten resources, the five personal resources are: having a human body, being born in a land where the Dharma has spread, having intact sense organs, having encountered the Dharma, having confidence in the Three Jewels. The five resources from others are that: the Buddha has been born in this age, he has taught, the Dharma has not declined, there are many followers, and there are benevolent sponsors."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212 The Instructions ofGampopa 8. Bodhicitta, \"the mind of enlightenment,\" combines unlimited loving-kindness and compassion toward all sentient beings with the wisdom of seeing that all things are empty of self-existence. 9. Vajradhara is the \"Dharmakaya Buddha,\" considered the origin of the Kagyu lineage. 10. Ngondro are the preliminary or foundation practices for the vajrayana. The four ordinary foundations or the four thoughts that turn the mind toward the Dharma are contemplation of the precious human birth, imperma-nence, the cause and effect of karma, and the sufferings of samsara. The four extraordinary foundations are: prostrations for taking refuge and gen-erating bodhicitta; Vajrasattva mantra recitation for purification; mandala offerings for generating merit; and guru yoga for receiving the blessings of the lineage. 11. The eight worldly dharmas are gain and loss, pleasure and pain, praise and blame, and fame and infamy. 12. Dewachen, or Sukhavati in Sanskrit, is the pure land where Amitabha Buddha resides. 13. Maras are obstacles to Dharma practice. These \"maras\" or obstacles are traditionally personified as \"Mara,\" the tempter, demon, or devil. The four maras are: skandha-mara, the belief that the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, concepts, and consciousness) constitute a self; klesha-mara, the negative emotions; mrityu-mara, death; and devaputra-mara, se-duction by the bliss of meditation. 14. The three realms are the desire, form, and formless realms. The desire realm includes six levels of gods, in addition to the hell, hungry ghost, animal, human, and demigod realms. The form realm includes seven-teen higher levels of gods, and the formless realm includes the four high-est levels of gods. 15. The six states of existence are the hell being, hungry ghost, animal, human, demigod, and god realms. 16. The three types of suffering are the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the suffering of conditioned existence. 17. The Profound Inner Meaning (Zab mo nang don) is a work by the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje. Khenpo Karthar gave an oral commentary on this work in the summers of 1989 and 1990 at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Notes 213 18. Mani stones are stones carved with the mantra, \"Om mani peme hung,\" the mantra of Chenrezig, the bodhisattva of compassion. 19. The four root violations of moral conduct, or the four roots, are killing, stealing, lying, and sexual misconduct. 20. In mahayana, it is emphasized that compassionate action, described as method or skillful means, leads to the accumulation of merit. In vajrayana, the practices themselves also generate vast merit, and are de-scribed as method. In either case, it is important to combine method with wisdom. 21. The heading of this section in the Tibetan wood block edition states that there are twelve points, but there appear to be only eleven distinct points actually listed. 22. The Rain of Wisdom, tr. by Nalanda Translation Committee, Boston: Shambhala, 1989. 23. The ten virtuous actions are the opposites of the ten unvirtuous ac-tions: ill-will, coveting, wrong views, harsh words, slander, idle speech, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct. 24. The four dhyanas are four levels of tranquility meditation. They are related to the realm of form, and attachment to their practice may lead to rebirth in the realm of form. 25. The four formless absorptions are further levels of tranquility medita-tion, which are related to the formless realm, the highest of the three realms of samsara. 26. Subsequent attainment means post-meditation. 27. Superimposition means adding something to appearances that is not really present, such as a permanent, unitary self, or the inherent exist-ence of things. 28. The four unities are appearance and emptiness, sound and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and awareness and emptiness."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"I I lllli\"Y 9 781559 390460"}]
