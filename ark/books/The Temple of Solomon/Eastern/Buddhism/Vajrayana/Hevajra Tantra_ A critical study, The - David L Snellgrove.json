This text has been translated with the help of the Tibetan transla-tion and its most important Indian commentaries. Of these one which is preserved in Sanskrit, the YoJJ.aratna_mala by a certain Kal).ha, has also been edited, based upon an old Bengali manuscript belonging to Cambridge University Library. It has seemed sufficient to make quotations from the other commentaries, which are all preserved in Tibetan, and to attach these in the form of notes to the translation of the main text. The intention of the introduction is to pr9vide some historical religious setting for the text, and to interpret to the reader the essentialtp.eaning of the tantra, as it is understood by the commentators. This part of the work is of a more general nature, and I must acknowledge my great indebtedness to Professor Tucci, whose monumental works on the art of Tibet with the many references they contain, have proved a constant support, and also to Louis de la Vallee Poussin and to Paul Mus, whose theories of the development of-Buddhism I have learned to ~ccept as fundamentally sound. In the case of de Ia Vallee Poussin I have in mind particularly his Bouddhisme,_Etudes et Materiaux, published in 1898. It was this work that first drew my attention to the essential continuity underlying the develop-ment of Buddhism, a continuity achieved by devotion to a single ideal, which was ever seeking better means of realization and expression. This short work, produced now more than fifty years ago, is still rich in un-realized implications. More recently I have come upon the work, still unfinished, of Paul Mus, Borobutjur, Esquisse d'une Histoire du Bouddhisme fondee sur la critique arcMologique des textes. This method appears as entirely satisfactory; the bringing of a text into relationship with archaeo-logical evidence has the effect of uncovering for us the intention of the practisers, so that it begins to become possible to conceive of their doctrine as they conceived of it, a refreshing change indeed from the modern spate of literature on Buddhism, which often tells little more than how certain Europeans or modern Indians conceive of some of the formulated Buddhist doctrines which please them. To attempt an interpretation of a Buddhist tantra is to move into un-mapped territory; certain landmarks are clear, a few tracks here and there, and that is all. Very few texts of this kind have so far been published, and none has been analysed in any detail. As early as 1896 de la Vallee Poussin, introducing his edition of the Paficakrama, wrote: 'Il y a beaucoup de Vll"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PREFACE choses dans les livres tantriques-et notamment dans le Paficakrama-qui se trouve au confluent d'un courant d'idees metaphysiques et d'un courant d'idees religieuses: tout ce que la philosophie Madhyamika a de plus subtil s'y mele harmoniquement a des conceptions d' ordre pratique savam-ment elaborees.' Yet fifty years later these possibilities are still largely unexplored, and the Buddhism of India from the eighth to the thirteenth century remains relatively unknown. On the other-hand, expressions of opinion have not been so slow in forthcoming. These have either been based on the first impressions given by the few texts that have become available, or upon Sir John Woodroffe's series of non-Buddhist tantras. This has led to the all too rapid assumption that the Buddhist tantras are in all things identifiable with the siikta tantras, a conclusion which, if indeed justified, should have followed from an examination of the texts and traditions on both sides. The wide divergence that separates them becomes apparent when we consider the later development of tantric Buddhism, particularly in Tibet. It is here that the works of Giuseppe Tucci are of such inestimable value, particularly the four volumes of Indo-Tibetica, which suggest with remarkable vividness the condition of the Buddhism of those centuries, when it was being methodically transferred into Tibet. 'Il compito doveva apparire sempre pili vasto e difficile, perche di fatto si doveva creare non solo una letteratura rna una nuova cultura, o meglio, si doveva dare al Tibet una cultura che non aveva mai posseduta. Cio poteva solo avvenire attraverso l'introduzione della nuova religione, che a poco a poco, permeava le coscienze e ne informava tutta quanta la vita e, penetrata da circa tre secoli, aveva gia avuto le sue glorie, le sue sconfitte, i suoi martiri (I-T ii, p. 9).' It seems sufficiently evident that far more was involved in tantric Buddhism than a first glance at the text of the Guh;xasamqja-tantra might suggest. This important work, usefully edited by Benoytosh Bhattacharya, still awaits a thorough investigation in the light of its commentaries, which alone will place it rightly in its Buddhist setting. There seems to be nothing essentially difficult about these texts if studied in this manner, but one can go hopelessly astray if one attempts to make deductions oneself from literal interpretations of the tantras. Such a procedure may throw light upon their origins, but by no means does it explain their significance for Buddhist tradition. There has also appeared recently a work by S. B. Dasgupta, An Intro-duction to Tiintric Buddhism, Calcutta, 1950. This is a thoroughly com-mendable book for its discussion of many of the terms fundamental to the subject, and for its many quotations drawn largely from manuscripts, not a few of them indeed from the Hevajra-tantra itself, of which a. copy is held by the Asiatic Society of Bengal. One needs, however, to beware of viii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PREFACE the general manner of discussion, which is far too naive in its approach, and seems to suggest too ready an acceptance of certain modern prejudices. The cause for this is always the same, that we are attempting to generalize on a vast. subject, in which there is no lack of material, by short-cutting the longer task of examining these texts in detail and in their own context. It is this therefore that I have attempted to do in the case of the Hevajra-tantra. Difficulties still remain, but that is at present inevitable; nor let it be thought that I am claiming immunity from error in the case of my own observations. It has, however, been my aim to base them upon as large a context as is possible to me at present. This is the only safe manner of proceeding; as our context becomes gradually enlarged, so will our observations become increasingly reliable. I acknowledge my gratitude to Professor H. W. Bailey, who set me forth on the path of Indian studies and who is still always ready with advice and assistance; to Professor Giuseppe Tucci for the kindly interest that he has taken in my studies and for the generous manner in which he placed his private library at my disposal during my long stay with him in Rome; and to Professor Walter Simon who continues to give me such friendly guidance in London. I would acknowledge my great debt of gratitude to the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London, where this present work has been completed, and by whose very generous subvention its publication has been made possible. At this School thanks are especially due to the Librarian and his staff for the unfailing assistance they have given me in gaining access to manuscripts and texts. ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"NOTE FIVE years have passed since I completed the editing and trans-lating of these texts.

APOLOGETIC BuDDHISM endured in the land of its origin for some I,6oo years, from the preaching of the first sermon in the Deer Park at Banaras 500 years before the beginning of the Christian era, until the final onslaughts of Islam laid waste the great monastic establishments of the Ganges Valley and Bengal. The ruthlessness of this attack is in itself sufficient to explain the disappearance of Buddhism from India. Its strength had consisted for a long time in its monastic establishments and these in turn depended largely upon royal support-of Asoka, who enabled a small community of religious mendicants to propagate itself from the north-west frontier to Ceylon-of the Andhran and Kushan kings, under whose auspices their doctrines commenced to develop and enrich themselves so that they became suitable as a religion for the greater part of Asia-of the Guptas and especially of Harsha1-then finally of the Pala kings of Bengal who continued their support up to the last days. 2 In these last four and a half centuries there is no evidence of decline; the monasteries of Sarnath and Nalanda, of Vikramasila and Vajrasana (Budhgaya) were all flourishing concerns, housing many hundreds of monks and comparable only with the similar institutions that continue in Tibet to this day. Moreover it was precisely in this period that the Tibetans themselves were engaged in trans-ferring into their own country all that they could find of Buddhist teaching, and the contents of their canon, as it now exists, presents in itself a com-plete summary of the Buddhism of those centuries. In their case it was not a matter of finding texts long disused, which they might edit and translate to the best of their ability, but of finding living masters, who would instruct them in the meaning of the actual doctrines and col~ laborate with them in the extremely difficult work of transferring them into another language, which till that time had not even possessed the necessary religious and philosophical terms for the task. It was truly an extraordinary feat, the magnitude of which is not always sufficiently appreciated, and still less the existence of such zeal and knowledge as that to which it bears 1 For invaluable accounts of Buddhism in India in the seventh century one may see the accounts of Hsiian Tsang and I Tsing, the former translated by Beal, Records of the Western Kingdoms, 1884, by Julien, Memoires sur les contrees occidentales, 1858, and by Thomas Watters, On Yuan Chwang's Travels, London, 1904-5; the latter by Takakusu, A Record of the Buddhist Religion, 1896. 2 Concerning these kings see H. C. Ray, Dynastic History of Northern India, Calcutta, 1-931, vol. i, ch. 6, Dynastic History of Bengal and Bihar, where there are many details of royal interest in Buddhist foundations, e.g. pp. 288, 293-5, 303, 313-14, 317, 321-2, 326.

A truer appreciation of the nature of their religion becomes all the more just, when it is upon their translations that we must chiefly rely for our understanding of the doctrines concerned. Indian Buddhism was slowly and laboriously transferred to Tibetan soil, and every effort was made to copy as exactly as possible not only the texts themselves but the very conditions under which they were studied and transmitted. Monasteries developed and became, as in India, the main centres of learning; hermits and ascetics, in direct succession from Indian masters, were surrounded by their chosen pupils, to whom they trans-mitted the secrets of those special means towards enlightenment, such as the subject-matter of our text; the arts of imagery and painting were intro-duced following Indian models, all to serve the purpose of the new religion. The more useful kind of rites, such as the bringing or stopping of rain, the removal of unwanted neighbours, the quelling of troublesome sprites, merely supplanted, or sometimes reinforced, similar practices that already existed in the country. Such opposition as there was to this great invasion seems to have had its basis solely in court intrigue and fear of personal loss on the part of the old practitioners, and as has often been the case in the history of other countries, one or other faction found it con-venient to associate itself with the new religion or the old.3 But any really effective opposition, such as an already existing religious culture would have presented, was lacking, and the poverty of bon as an organized religion is shown by the eagerness with which it has hastened to adorn itself in Buddhist garb. For us who are interested in this period these Indo-Tibetan relations have a double importance. On the one hand we can make small progress with the study of the original Indian texts without the help of Tibetan ver.:. sions, and on the other hand much that is found in Tibetan texts remains incomprehensible until it can be associated with some Indian original. It is with both these aspects in view that the present work is undertaken, to clarify one particular type of Buddhist practice which was pursued in 1 See, however, Tucci, Indo-Tibetica, ii, p. 9· The four volumes of this series, Rome, 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1941, all serve as an admirable illustration of how great was the task. 2 See my references to Padmasambhava in Buddhist Himalaya, pp. rsoff. 3 See TPS i, pp. 2 ff. 2"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"APOLOGETIC India, thereby assisting towards a complete study of this religion in the land of its origin, and at the same time to lay the foundation for a better understanding of the Tibetan sects themselves, which were the direct suc-cessors of these traditions. The Tibetan Canon, itself representative of Indian Buddhism, consists of two parts. The first is the Kanjur (bKa/.t-l.zgyur), 'Translation of the Word'. It comprises thirteen volumes of rules of monastic discipline (vi'naya) and associated material; twentv-one volumes of supposedly revealed teach-ings concerning the doctrine of the 'Perfection ofWisdom' (prajfiiipiiramitii) which seems to provide the whole basis of later Buddhist practice and to the subject of which we shall return below; forty-fourvolumes of mahiiyiina-sutras, which extol the endless merits of the many buddhas and bodhi'sattvas, telling of the benefits that accrue from devotion paid them, commending the career of the self-sacrificing bodhisattva as open to all men, listing his attributes and the stages of his advance; they touch upon points of doctrine, the three bodies of a buddha, the theory of the absolute as a 'store-con-sciousness' (iilayavijfiiina), the theory of the three aspects (parini~panna, paratantra, and vikalpita), and so on;I then lastly twenty-two volumes of tantras, works concerned with ritual and meditation of a special nature. It is part of the contents of some of these last works that have earned for late Indian and early Tibetan Buddhism its reputation as degenerate and depraved, a charge which while in some respects justifiable, as we shall see, remains essentially unfair for two reasons, viz. that it has been made on first appearances, and that even in so far as it is applicable, it can apply to no more than a part of the Buddhi'st practice of the period. The second part of the canon is known as the Tenjur (bsTan-l.zgyur), 'Translation of Treatises', and comprises works by individual Indian masters. It is therefore not 'Buddha-Word' (buddhavacana). It is grouped into two great sections, Commentaries on the Siltras(mDo-l.zgrel) and Com-mentaries on the Tantras (rGyud-l.zgrel). 2 The first group includes all works, not necessarily commentaries, which seek their authority in the teachings of the prajniipiiramita-literature,. of the mahiiyiina-siltras, or of still older traditions, while the second group is concerned with the new theories and 1 This group includes the Phal-chen, dKon-brTsegs, mDo-sDe, and Myan-l;ulas sections of the Kanjur. The totals given are those of the Narthang Kanjur edition. Those of the Derge are slightly different: I3, 2I, 46, and 20. 2 Such is the arrangement in the Narthang Tenjur. The Derge edition, however, divides it into seventeen parts: commentaries on the tantras (78 vols.), on prajiiapiiramitii (I6), madhyamika works (I7), commentaries on siitras (Io), vijiiiinamlitratii works (r6), abhidharma (u), vinaya (IS), jiitaka (5), epistles (2), logic (2o), philology (4), technical works (5), medicine (I), general matters (included in preceding volume), miscellaneous (9), eulogies ( r ), origins of the doctrine (I). All this material, with the exception of th\"e tantra-commentaries and eulogies, is included in the one section of the Narthang edition, and as we are only concerned here with the proportion of works on the tantras to other works, such general grouping serves the immediate purpose. 3"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION practices. There are 137 volumes in the first group as against 86 in the second, and it may be observed that the proportion of works dealing with the tantras, which comprised only 22 volumes out of a total of 100 in the 'revealed' part of the canon, far exceeds that of all other 'non-revealed' works. This outweighing proportion becomes even the more impressive, when we recall that whereas the works included in the mDo-l.zgrel are the fruit of the whole period of mahayana development, works produced for the most part between the second and the eighth centuries A.D., those of the rGyud-l.zgrel belong precisely to the period in which we are interested, namely from the seventh to the twelfth centuries, the bulk of the works produced probably being concentrated towards the middle of this period. This at least indicates that while the earlier works were in no wise neglected (otherwise they would have found no place at all in the Tibetan Canon), actual creative activity was to be found almost exclusively concerned with the tantras. Nor is it just to compare unfavourably the work of these later writers with that of the earlier ones. The two periods, if we may refer to them as such, I are in many ways analogous, first the appearance of the authoritative texts (buddhavacana), the late appearance of which is ex-plained away in the same manner-they had been hidden away, entrusted to the nagas and so on because mankind was not yet prepared to receive them-followed by the works of individual writers, who comment upon these basic texts, systematize them, and produce treatises of their own dealing with the same themes in well-ordered forms. As literature too the siltras and tantras present exactly the same type. They exist in the form of discourses which the Lord Buddha in one of his manifestations is supposed to give to a company of followers, either bodhisattvas or divinities, who ask questions and are often astounded at some new pronouncement that is made, new in that it departs in some measure from existing ideas. It is interesting that our anonymous redactors are often aware of the novelties they are introducing, and the consternation of their imaginary hearers in all probability represents the real consternation of some hearers -of flesh 1 Such a distinction corresponds with the 'two modes' (lugs giiis) of Tibetan Buddhism, the mode of the siitras (mdo lugs) and the mode of the mantras (snags lugs). The first group includes all those who are not followers of the tantras. There are different ways of distin-guishing the various phases of Buddhism, depending upon that aspect of it which one wishes to stress. So far as practice is concerned, it would be difficult to distinguish clearly more than these two periods, since the early schools (Sravakas) and the early followers of the mahayana pursue much the same methods, the practice of recognized Buddhist morality and the set performance of meditation. (Concerning this see Mircea Eliade, Yoga, Paris, I954, ch. 6.) The tantras naturally form a separate period as we shall see. Such a division clearly cuts across the distinction (made according to philosophical development) ofthe 'three swingings of the wheel', concerning which see Stcherbatsky, 'Die drei Richtungen in der Philosophie des Buddhismus', Rocznik Orientalistyczny, vol. x, pp. Iff. This is, however, a tendentious article, written in reply to Schayer's introduction to his Aus-gewiihlte Kapitel aus der Prasannapada, I9JI, and well illustrates the relative nature of these d1visions. 4"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"APOLOGETIC and blood. 1 The discourses themselves are disordered and rambling, new ideas are just stated authoritatively with no consciousness of any necessity for showing their truth; there are sudden interruptions and long digres-sions. The lan_g_uage is usually inferior. Sanskrit.!. sometimes betra_yin~ its dependence upon an earlier version in the vernacular. It is never possible to date these works with any precision just because they usually have no date, but have developed gradually through several generations of followers within one particular group, for whom they first become authoritative, authoritative in the sense that the pupil learns them from the mouth of his master, and in this way they become the buddha-word-in a very real sense in such a setting, where the word of the master is endowed with so much sanctity. They only assume a fixed form and wider popularity when some master of unusual literary ability and greater scholarship sets about the writing of a commentary, and the work, thereby brought to the notice of masters of equal ability in other schools, begins to extend its influence. When one is thus attempting to recapture the actual setting in which these works were produced, one needs to remember that many more pupils and masters were engaged in making use of these works than the comparative few whose names may be found in the indexes to the Tibetan Canon, and that many more works of an 'authoritative' nature were produced in the schools than those which gained sufficient popularity to permit their in-clusion in this great collection. z Of these two great periods of development, that of the sfitras and that of the tantras, the first is now comparatively well known in the general course of its progress and in the more detailed aspect of several of its important works, of which a representative selection, siltras, commentaries, and philo-sophic treatises with their commentaries, has by now appeared in print. There has resulted from this labour a more just appreciation of the Buddhism of this period; which no one would now regard as a mere corruption of the earlier and ipso facto 'genuine' Buddhism of the Pali texts. We find that Buddhism of all periods may be brought into parallel relationship, both as regards theory and practice, with the other religious and philosophical 1 See, e.g., Hevajra-tantra, I. x. 14 and II. iv. 66. % There seem to be certain false conceptions on this subject of 'popularity' and 'popu~ larizing'. See, e.g., S. B. Dasgupta, pp. 61-63. It was apparently 'for the sake of the common run of people the mantras, the mudriis, and the mm:ufalas were introduced into Buddhism in the course of time'. This seems to suggest the existence of a 'pure Buddhism' consisting of bare philosophical notions and untramelled virtuous conduct, which at best is nothing more than a European creation of the nineteenth to twentieth centuries. Ninety-nine per cent. of all Buddhists were the 'common run of people' who had made use of invocations and gestures and circumambulations, at least from the time the first stupa was built. There was never any need to introduce them, and as for the tantras, these represent a prescribed and special form, by no means popular, based largely upon prac-tices that were already Buddhist. The rite of ~ seems to be an exception, but even this served to give expression to an existing Buddhist aspiration, namely unity with prajfiii, and this particular practice seems eventually to have reverted to pure idea. 5"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION schools of thought which existed at any one tiri).e. Their mutual dependence and interrelationship render the whole study extremely complex; it is as yet little worked.1 Nevertheless there is nothing surprising in this realiza-tion, nor in the manner in which it would seem to have proceeded. Men develop ideas with regard to the technique of meditation, with regard to the nature of man and of phenomenal existence as a whole; these ideas receive concrete expression within definite schools; an acknowledged leader · arises and through his personal example and influence, his following in-creases and becomes renowned. During his lifetime his teachings can only be in terms of the concepts then prevalent, although they may be stated with greater authority from a personal realization of their truth or non-truth as the case may be. After his death the teachings still continue logically in his name, developing as ideas develop and absorbing that which can be absorbed without too great a conflict with the body of existing tradition. From some quarters there would always be opposition to new ideas, but the test of whether they were eventually Buddhist or not always consists in their receiving or not receiving sufficient acceptance for their absorption within the body of teaching and practice of any group who called themselves Buddhists. There would always be some who would con-tinue to deny their validity, but they would never be able to produce any cogent authority for their denial, for the axiom would always be: Y at ki1Jt cin Maitreya subhii~ita1J1-tad buddhavacanaf!l, 2 and it must remain for the masters of each school to decide what within the context of their tradition might be considered well said or not. This whole conception of development, while now generally accepted for the earlier mahiiyiina, namely that which has its authority in the siltras, has not yet been logically and fairly applied to the later period, namely that of the tantras. There is still a tendency to regard them as something cor-rupt,3 as belonging to the twilight of Buddhism.4 They are regarded in fact \\s 1 An important, if not conclusive, study of the relationship of early Buddhism to the Upanishads, is one by Marya Falk: II Mito Psicologico nell' India Antica (Memoria della Reale Accademia Naz. dei Lincei, vol. 336, Rome, 1939, Scienze Morali).

But on the basis of such small knowledge with regard to them as often exists, they are found to be one of the main causes of the downfall of Buddhism in India, because they either undermined its morale, or removed those distinguishing features by which Buddhism could continue to function as an independent religion. Yet it would seem that as good literature the sutras scarcely excel the tantras, nor are their credentials much better. Such commentaries and works of exegesis as I have so far had occasion to refer to are works that show considerable knowledge of their subject, well written and entirely serious in their intention. In no sense are they degenerate or even inferior to the works of earlier commentators on other Buddhist texts. Some are of higher quality than others, but this applies at all times. Nor of course does this period of Buddhism end with the effacement of Buddhism in India, which was probably brought about by physical causes, the destruction of the centres of learning and the absence of royal support; it is simply transferred to Tibet, and after some delay, for the Tibetans had all to learn, it continued afresh in their schools, and although very little indeed of their vast labours has yet been made avail-able to outsiders, such little as there is attests their extraordinary ability. As for the charge that Buddhism ceases to be distinguishable from certain other types of Indian religious practice at this time, this was now no more true than it had ever been. It is indeed true that Buddhist and non-Buddhist tantras are based upon similar ideas and often contain similar material, and that many parallels may be obvious, but one may well ask at what previous stage of the doctrine was this not true. The Buddhists now as much as before garbed similar ideas in a distinctive terminology, nor even can we be sure that they were following a lead in introducing these new notions and practices. The followers of the non-Buddhist tantras may well have been as dependent upon those who called themselves Buddhists, as the vedantists were probably dependent upon the madhyamikas. These are questions which can only gradually be resolved as these works become better known. Nevertheless it will be seen already in the work here edited that there are notions that are not Buddhist, in the sense that they are not properly assimilated, and so seem to exist in contradiction with the wider context~ These will be referred to in due course, and are mentioned now only lest one should be tempted to point to them as showing the non-Buddhist character of the whole. De la Vallee Poussin has well said: 'On 1 In protest against this earlier limited view, see de la Vallee Poussin, BEM, pp. 1-3. 7"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION regarde d'habitude le Tantrisme idolatre et superstitieux comme \"n'etant plus du Bouddhisme\"; on oublie que le Bouddhisme n'est pas separable des bouddhistes, et que les Hindous bouddhistes etaient volontiers idolatres, SUperstitieUX OU metaphysicienS.11 But if the tantras have been neglected it has not been without reason, for it must be conceded that they refer to unpleasant practices on occasions, and sometimes dwell unnecessarily, or at least so it may seem to the modern reader, upon matters that.might be touched upon more tactfully. It must further be admitted that even the present translation expunges short passages here and there, in which nothing of value is lost. It would not be fair to expect such sensitiveness on this score from our commentators, and in attempting to interpret these texts one can do no better than follow their lead, for they are the Buddhists who presumably practised these precepts, and it is their Buddhism we are attempting to understand. One may be confident that they deal with them in all seriousness. In the particular yoga practised, physical forces, whether of the seminal power or of the breath, need to be brought under control, and it may be to this process that some of these passages refer. There may be others that permit of a symbolical interpretation, and there are few religions that have not made use of analogous symbolism. Lastly there are the practices used by 'fools', a useful category that disposes of all malpractice.2 Let it not be thought, however, that one is thereby deliberately explaining away a portion of these works in order to render the rest palatable. We are explaining these works as they were traditionally interpreted and understood. It was the realization of enlightenment that was the goal, and if these means ptoved efficacious, they might be confidently employed. In this we are aware of a discre-pancy existing between the tantras themselves and the exegetical works of those who later adopt them, for while the latter never lose sight of the goal which is self-realization, the tantras often treat of rites in such a naive manner as to belie any esoteric intention. In the commentaries one is dealing always with the internal process, or with the internal process as the end envisaged. In the tantra itself one is concerned with actual prac-tices in the world without. There are certain very clear examples of this in I Id., p. 6. 2 Thus V commenting upon I. x. 6 : 'Then in order to teach fools the way of passion, one should cause to enter in the mmJ!!ala this girl.' (77 b r). Again commenting on II. vii. 5 ff.: 'This is for the understanding of fools who are in the power of passion' (125 b 2). Again commenting on II. v. 58 ff.: 'The siddhi of passion is not to be obtained by eating flesh and drinking wine and practising sexual union at these external meeting-places (see alsop. 69, note 2). For those who think thus, their stock of dharma (chos kyi phun po) even though it be 84,ooo-fold will be rendered ineffective and their effort in yoga, though it be of the best, will come to nought. So when the text says that one gains the siddhi of passion by celebrating this gathering with eating and drinking and so on, this can only be for the sake of attracting simple fools' (129 a 5--7). See my observation below, which is based on such passages as these-Introduction, p. 17. 8"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"APOLOGETIC the Hevajra-tantra. Chapter 7 of Part I refers in cleafterms to the gather-ings that come together at the meeting-places (melaka) and one is left in little doubt concerning the actuality of the rites performed there. Yet the commentators will have none of this, and for them there are no places of pllgrimage like those within one's own body. A similar example is to be found in the song of the yoginis at the beginning of Chapter 4 of Part II, for what is this if not a description of such a gathering? Taranatha even recounts of Kal).ha, who was perhaps the author of the commentary in-cluded in this edition, that 'he was when practising the Samvara-tantra close to Nalanda, a (iiikini instructed him saying: . \"At the place of the goddesses called Kamaru there will be siddhi by means of exterior practice, so go and receive it.\" He went there and found a basket, and when he opened it, there appeared a drum provided with criss-cross cords. As soon as he took it in his hands, his feet ceased to touch the ground, and as he beat upon it violently, yogins and yoginis, 500 in number, came from all directions and escorted him' (Taranatha, tib. text, p. 161, 11. 20 ff.). Yet Kal).ha, whose interpretation of this song is translated below (pp. IOI-2), is as much concerned as the other commentators to find in it a description of the inner process of reintegration. Likewise there are several references to the eating of some kinds of human flesh. This we have to understand, it seems, as the consuming of the notion of a self, but the tantra itself by no means implies this. Here one eats this flesh in order to transform one's own body, so that it may become endowed with the powers of an aerial being. One is often aware that siddhi means not so much enlightenment, as per-fection in magical powers which here receive first place. No one can reasonably dispute the fact that the basic texts of the tantras have this murky and macabre appearance, and it is no excuse to say that 'it is open to any one to sit down and write a tantra', 1 for while no doubt all too true, one still must explain why these very same works should become endowed with such esteem.2 In the solution of this problem real interest should begin, for while the defects of some of these texts are so apparent, still more apparent is the glorious blossoming of human genius which they certainly nourished. Scholars, saints, and artists of first rank appear through-out the succeeding centuries and their works bear testimony to them to this day. In many ways the civilization developed in Tibet is analogous to that of our Middle Ages in the west, and just as here Christianity provided the inspiration and Greece and Rome the model. so there Buddhism was the . inspiration and the arts and sciences of India their model.

Manure nourishes the fairest rose, and we know far too little of the nature of man and of the growth and decline of his civilization, to ignore these particular studies because of personal distaste. This present edition presents one of these strange works of ritual, that which circles around the divinity Hevajra and his consort Nairatmya.1 It was one of the most renowned of Buddhist tantras in India itself, was adopted in Tibet by the Ka-gyii-pas (bKal.z-rgyud-pa) (to which the bio-graphy of Rechung bears witness)i and the Sa-kya-pas (Sa-skya-pa), for whom it became a fundamental treatise to which they devoted much work of exegesis. It was in this rite that the young Khubilai, later to be khan of all the Mongols, was initiated by one of their abbots, l.zGro-dGon l.zPhags-pa. Yet as will be seen, this work has all the defects of its class. Little attention is paid to grammar and even less to scansion. The style is often crude and disjointed, and the whole work shows no logical construction. It would have considerably assisted comprehensibility to have rearranged the material in the translation, but this would have given an entirely false impression of the nature of the work, which already benefits considerably from its trans-ference into English, a claim that may be safely made in this case without any undue sense of personal achievement. It has seemed better therefore-to add a bare resume of the contents (pp. 121-5) and it is hoped that, on the basis of this, the various disjointed parts of the work will fall into place. The translation follows the text faithfully unless indicated in the notes, but no attempt has been made to translate a Sanskrit term with the same word regardless of context. Moreover in some cases it has seemed better to introduce the Sanskrit term itself, which elsewhere may appear translated. To compensate for such freedom, which no readable translation could renounce, the important terms have been separately discussed in the Glos-sary and an attempt made to fix their meaning (pp. I31-41). Sanskrit 1 The name Hevajra is itself merely an invocation of the final truth (vajra): He Vajra = Tibetan: Kyel.zi r Dorje; see Buddhist Himalaya, p. 73· It sometimes is spelt, however, with the phonetically similar form: dGyes pal.zi rDorje (Har~avajra, 'Rejoicing Vajra'). This occurs among the 108 names of Vajradhara as listed in the Tattvasa'f!lgrahatantra (Narthang Kanjur, rgyud vii, f. 249 b 3). The Chinese extends the name into 'Great Vajra of Compassion and Voidness', ta pei k'ung chin hang. Concerning these two primary principles, compassion (karu1Jii = upaya) and voidness (Sunyata = prajiia) see below, Introduction, pp. 23-24. Nairatmya is self-explanatory; seep. 24. 2 This was the first cause of my own interest in the work.

II. ORIGINS There has been occasion already to refer to the realistic nature of parts of the Hevajra-tantra, the gatherings at the recognized meeting-places and the rites performed there. With the translation before us, itself sufficiently eloquent, there is little need to draw further attention to them, as it is this aspect of the work which will impress itself all too readily upon the reader. Well may one question the right of these yo gins to call themselves Buddhists, who experience the consummation of enlightenment in the embrace of a yogini.1 It is this very act which is regarded as serving the universal good of living-beings. Thereafter the pupil is free to pursue the practice of strenuous meditation and physical self-control, and after five years or more he will perhaps succeed. 2 He receives the five symbolic adornments, crown, ear-rings, necklace, bracelets, girdle, signs of his success.3 These he wears on those set occasions, the eighth or fifteenth day of the dark-fortnight, when perfected yo gins and yoginis come together, to consume the flesh and wine, to sing and dance, and realize their consummation of bliss. 4 He is free from all conventions and wanders as he pleases, knowing no distinc-tion between friend or foe, clean or unclean, good or evil.S Such is the circle in which our tantra has its origin, amidst outcasts and voluntary outcasts, who reassert their position by means of the powers with which they become credited, and it is by their success that they are vindicated. 'Because in the early stages these men were very careful and guarded the secret, no one knew that they were practising the secret mantras, until they a?tually became possessed of magical powers ( vidyii-dhara). But when they had these powers, travelling in the sky or becoming invisible, then it was known conclusively that they were practisers of mantras. On account of this (secrecy) there was but very little handing down of traditional teachings from master to pupil (that can be traced), and 1 See II. ii. c, II. iii. b. ~ See II. ii. a. The period of five years is suggested by some of the biographies of the eighty-four siddhas. In every case several years of practice were required from the time consecration was received from a master. Thus T~.llk!!:Q,iisa required three years (EM, p. 99), §!~:!:2El1Jia 12 (EM, p. 46), K~~la 12 (VZ, p. 176). Mahiipadmavajra, however, succeeded in one year (EM, p. 43) and Jal:mdhari instantaneously (EM, p. 59). It is generally agreed that years of strenuous practice were required. One may also compare in this respect the biography of Mi-la Ras-pa. 3 See I. vi. a. 4 See I. vii, II. iv. a, II. vii. b. 5 See I. vi. b, II. iii. h. II"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION although there had been much study devoted to the kriya-and caryatantras from the time when the mahayana began to spread, as they were practised very much in secret, no one knew who was studying them except for those actually engaged in these secret mantras' (Taranatha, tib. text, p. 82, 11. IS ff.). 'Many anuttarayogatantras of profound import were brought to light by individual masters-the Hevajra by Kampala and Saroruha' (id., p. 209, II. IS and 18). They were considered to be of profound import because they had developed certain powerful means of mental and physical control, which if practised rightly, seemed to lead with certainty to that state of spiritual equpoise which had always been the chief goal of Indian religious endeavour. These 'individual masters', the first sponsors of these works,,are known collectively in both Indian and Tibetan tradition as the eighty-four Perfected Ones (siddhas), and it is therefore in their biographies that one must seek knowledge of the first transmissions. There are two complete collections of these biographies preserved in Tibetan, one in the canon itself and the other in the works of Taranatha. 1 Separate biographies also appear in the histories of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism by Bu-sTon, gZon-nu-dPal, Padma dKar-po, and Taranatha. There is then no shortage of such material, and in portraying the lives of these men, or the lives they were believed to lead (which for the study of the nature of a religion is just as important) it is of considerable assistance. But when one seeks to bririg them into an historical framework, one is presented with the great difficulty of one master often possessing more than one name, and of several masters possessing the same name. This is all the more unfortunate in that it affects chiefly the more important names, just because of the renown that attached to them. Thus SARORUHA, who is credited with bringing our tantra to light, and whose interest in it is proved by his writing of the commentary which is often quoted below, and of several short works (sadhana, vidhi, stotra)2 con-cerned with the Hevajra cycle, has also the name of Padmava]ra, and there were many with this name, as Taranatha himself informs us. 3 Both he and Kampala, who although also credited with the finding of this tantra, has only one short work to his name on the theme, 4 appear as contemporaries of King lndrabhiiti, but there are three lndrabhiitis. One is certainly led to mistrust such a multiplying of some of these names, but it is impossible to 1 These are the Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzil;i lo rgyus, the first work in vol. 86 of the Narthang Tenjur, translated by Grlinwedel as 'Die vierundachtzig Zauberer' in Baessler Archiv, vol. 5, and the bKalJ babs bdun ldan of Taranatha, edited by Sarat Candra Das (Bengal Secretariat Press, 1901) and translated by Grlinwedel as Tiirantitha's Edelstein-mine, Petrograd, 1914.

II, pp. vii-viii, 12"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ORIGINS discriminate against them until their works become better known, and one may then be able to reject some as barren. In the meantime one's selection of facts from this material is to some extent arbitrary and certainly subject to later correction. Now Taranatha gives a succession of names that would fit quite well, and also provides the connecting link that is needed with a second succession. 1 lNDRABHUTI I ABvAPADA I I MAHAPADMAVAJRA VILASYAVAJRA I I ANANGAVAJRA VAJRAGH~TA I· Saroruha I Kampala I I lNDRABHUTI II lNDRABHUTI II Indrabhuti II receives instruction from both Saroruha and Kampala, which brings them together both in time and place. There is also another connect-ing link. Elsewhere in his history, Taranatha refers to J!ombi-heruka both as preceding Saroruha and Kampala and as having taken an initial interest in the Hevajra-tantra of which he receives the quintessence (siira) ;2 further-more his association with this cycle is confirmed by the existence of an invocation of Nairatmya and her troupe written in his name and drawn from our tantra (Siidhanamiilii 228). His seniority to Saroruha and Kam~ pala, Taranatha confirms quite incidentally in the biographies, when he makes him a contemporary of Vilasyavajra.3 From Indrabhuti II the succession continues through Jalandhari to K~:t:<A (or KA:t:<HA), author of the Yogaratnamiilii, one of the few commentaries on the Hevajra-tantra which is all but complete in Sanskrit and the full text of which it has seemed useful to give in this edition.4 1 EM, pp. 4o-49 and 49-sS. 2 See Schiefner, p. 192. 3 See EM, p. so. 4 See EM, p. 43· To identify this particular Kr~I].a with any certainty at the present stage of our knowledge seems impossible. An attempt has already been made by Shahi~ dullah (Chants Mystiques, pp. 24-29). Jalandhari is referred to with respect in one of the songs (no. 9, p. us), and Shahidullah, assured of this connexion, associates this Kr~I].a with the one referred to by Taranatha, Schiefner, p. I9S, where Jalandhari and Kr~J}.a appear as contemporaries of a certain king Govicandra, who, again according to Taranatha, was a contemporary of Dharmakirti. On the basis of this and still less certain evidence (q.v.) he places Kr~I].a about A.D. 700. Such a Kr~I].a, a name all too common, may well have lived at this time, but our accounts clearly conflict, unless we also assume the existence of at least two Jalandharis, one the master of Shahidullah's Kr~I].a, and the other the master of the Kr~I].a who lived under King Devapiila (Schiefner, p. 2u) and was experienced in the Hevajra-tantra, &c. He was certainly a pupil of Jalandhari (also adept in the Hevajra~ tantra) and their succession is given (EM, p. 43) in a manner which accords completely with my present requirements. The master of Jalandhari is Indrabhiiti II, not lndrabhuti I, a distinction Shahidullah fails to make when he refers to this passage. It would upset his calculations by at least roo years. Kr~I].a was a common name and the various persons who bore it are not distinguished. There may well have been one who lived about 700, and it may be he who is mentioned at EM, p. 40. At Schiefner, p. 19S he seems to be confused with someone else (Schiefner, p. 244) who lived much later under King Govicandra, who Tiiraniitha informs us (Schiefner, p. 197) preceded Lalitacandra who was the last of the 13"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Now as for dates we have two points d'appui. Mahiipadmavajra may be identified-with Padmasambhava, adopted son of Indrabhii.ti, who goes to Tibet in the second half of the eighth century, while Kii~ha at this end of the series is stated by Tiiraniitha to have been a contemporary of King Devapiila, who ruled in the first half of the ninth century. We thus have the Hevajra-tantra existing in its present form towards the end of the eighth century. This may yet be confirmed by the short passages of apabhra'J!lsa which are to be found in it, when more work has been done upon this dialect. With Tiiraniitha we may follow the succession through KA~HA to BHADRA-PADA, the author of yet another commentary on the Hevajra-tantra, which we shall frequently have occasion to quote. 1 He in turn gave instruction Candra dynasty. The last two kings of the Candra dynasty were Govindacandra and Layahacandra and are assigned to the first half of the eleventh century (Dynastic History of Northern India, vol. i, p. 385). This dating still further demolishes the evidence which Shahidullah adduces to substantiate the existence of his Kr~J;~a in A.D. 700. Under Devapiila (first half of ninth century) there is another KT!?l}a, for whom in accordance with EM, p. 43 (and since Shahidullah has now no claim) I accept Jalandhari as master. This Kr~?J;~a, expert in the Hevajratantra (Schiefner, p. 21 1), may be presumed to be the author of one of the commentaries on the Hevajratantra written in this name. There are two such com-mentaries, one the Yogaratnamtilti, preserved in Sanskrit and included in this edition, and the other the Smrtini1patti, a shorter work existing in Tibetan translation. A certain Kr~J;~a Pat;1<;lita co-operated in the task of translating the Yogaratnamtilti into Tibetan, and if he were also author of the other text, one might presume that the Yogaratnamtilti was the ninth-century work, but there is no internal evidence to support this. The Tibetan lotsava, mGos-lha-btsas, who translated the commentary of Ratniikarasiinti (c. uoo) also translated the Smrtini$patti, which could suggest a comparably late date for this com-mentary also. This almost negligible evidence would favour the Yogaratnamtilti as the work of the Kr~?l].a of the early ninth century, which I accept as a convenient but merely provisional identification. I referred above to the unsatisfactory nature of these biographies, and it has seemed best to place all this doubtful discussion in a note, leaving a simple and plausible scheme in the Introduction itself. It is certainly satisfactory to find that the dating of all the siddhas I am interested in accords with the genealogical table laboriously worked out by Sankrtyiiyana in his article on the eighty-four siddhas (JA 225, 1934, pp. 218 ff.). He gives only one Kr!?J;~a, a pupil of Jalandhari, and assigned to the early ninth century. According to Tiiraniitha (EM, p. 69) the Jiilandhari who was a contemporary of King Govicandra (the corner-stone of Shahidullah's construction-Schiefner, p. 195) was a fourth incarnation of this siddha, so there would be little difficulty in assigning him to the eleventh century. In fairness to Shahidullah it ffil.ISt be said that Tiiraniitha makes no mention of this in his history and records the event there as though it preceded the whole Piila dynasty, and actually makes this king contemporary with Dharmakirti. The confusion therefore exists in the sources at our disposal, where the same name can continually reappear. See also Tucci, A Sanskrit Biography of the Siddhas and some questions con-nected with Ntigtirjuna(JRASB xxvi, pp. 138-58), where this same problem is discussed. It seems, however, that Shahidullah may well be wrong in the dates he ascribes to the , Chants Mystiques. The songs in early Bengali may perhaps belong to the eleventh century while the dohtis in apabhramsa are likely to be earlier. The language appears to be at the same stage as the few verse~ that appear in the Hevajra-tantra, and there is no reason for assuming that the old Bengali verses and the dohtis are by the same Kr~J;~a. ' EM, p. 71. This is a plausible connexion. I assume that the author of the Srihevajra-vytikhytivivaratza, given as Bhata :iabs in the colophon of the N arthang edition,. is the Bhadrapada, alias Guhya, here referred to. The Ui catalogue (Derge canon) attributes this same work to Bhavabhadra.

To this same period belong TANKADASA,2 a monk of Nalanda, and RATNAKARASANTI3 of Vikramasihi, both also writers of commentaries on this tantra. Of the commentators there remain two of impQrtance who are not listed amongst the 84 Siddhas, DHARMAKIRTI and VAJRAGARBHA. In his history Taranatha writes of Dharmakirti, the logician, whom he regards, however, as a follower of the tantras, naming Vajraghal).ta or Darika or Tetigi as his vajriiciirya. 4 All these three are in any case contemporaries, belonging to the latter half of the eighth century. It is therefore not unreasonable to. deduce the existence of a second Dharmakirti, author of the commentary on the Hevajra-tantra that exists in his name, presuming this to have been written early in the ninth century. VAJRAGARBHA presents a more difficult problem. His commentary is the longest and by far the most useful, for there is little he leaves un-explained. He gives not only the figurative 'internal' meaning of the practices mentioned, in which the other commentators are usually alone interested, but uncovers also the actual rite involved. At the same time he does not fail to note the futility of such performances. 5 This commen-tary is admirably presented, each chapter being introduced by a separate verse, while the whole is preceded by a long introduction in verse, in which he laments the existence of those evil masters, who seek only wealth and enjoyment under cover of the doctrine, and impose upon their trusting pupils. He assumes himself and is given in the colophon the title of the Bodhisattva Vajragarbha, a religious name presumably adopted from the tantra itself, where Vajragarbha is the chief interlocutor. He therefore remains completely anonymous. The colophon in the Tenjur states that this commentary, 'hard to get', was obtained in Nepal from Maitrpa by the monk-translator Prajfiakirti of l)Bro (Lotsaba lzBro dGe-slmi Ses-rab Grags-pa). Maitrpa lived in the eleventh century. In his introduction Vajragarbha states that our version of the Hevajra-tantra, which consists of two parts (kalpa) and 750 Slokas, is but the shorter version of the original work which had thirty-two parts and soo,ooo slokas. The Chinese translation repeats a similar tradition, explaining the work as two sections from an original thirty-one.

This of course is likely and it was presumably on the basis of a large amount of such floating material that an authorized text would be,come established. The fact that one and the same version appears in all the com-mentaries and in the Tibetan and Chinese translations certainly bears wit-ness to the strength of the tradition when once this had come about. There are no means of checking nor indeed grounds for disputing Taranatha's assertion (quoted above) that Kampala and Saroruha brought the work to light (spyan-drans), which certainly involved fixing its present form as Saroruha's commentary proves. At the same time the existence of other versions, at least of parts of the text, is attested by some of the short works in the Sadhanamiilii. One may see, for example, no. 228 (already, referred to above on p. 13) which is said to come from the Hevajra-tantra, and bears close affinities with Chapters 3 and 8 in Part I of our version, some of the verses being identical. It is of interest to observe that J!ombi-heruka, to whom it is attributed, precedes Saroruha, and so writes perhaps before the fixing of the text, as also does Anangavajra, author of another short siidhana preserved in the Tenjur (rGyud, xxi. 246-7). All the siidhanas of Nairatmya preserved in the Siidhanamiilii are by their very nature related. The two opening Slokas of no. 229 correspond exactly with our text II. viii. 6-7. One is here on the edge of a very large problem, for there are remnants of the basic material of not only the Hevajra-tantra but of several tantras, material which must have been sufficiently extensive to give rise to the 1 notion of original works of the fantastic length of soo,ooo Slokas. Nor, knowing the Indian genius for the producing of works which at least begin to approximate to these proportions, can one discount altogether the possi-bility of the existence of other and longer versions. This is borne out by a reference in our text itself (I. xi. 12), where we are told that the full siidhana of Kurukulla is given in twelve parts, which the commentators refer to the long version (vistlrtzahevajratantra). There are a large number of sadhanas of this goddess in the Siidhanamiilii, which are by no means the special preserve of the Hevajra-tantra, where her only reason for intrusion is her association with the rite of vasya, 'subduing', in which she is specially proficient. Nevertheless the reference to the existence of this longer version ' stands, and for the present must remain unexplained. It is only strange that if such a longer version existed, the commentators should not have made some use of it. Yet there is another version, which Vajn1garbha constantly and Naropa occasionally quotes. In his introduction Vajragarbha announces his inten-tion of explaining the short version of 750 Slokas which comes out of the 1 Obermiller, p. 170. 16"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ORIGINS long version of soo,ooo Slokas 'in conformity with the basic tantra (mulJL-tanJza), the fundamental text of 6,ooo Slokas'. He confuses the matter by sometimes referring to this work as the 'basic tantra of soo,ooo Slokas', a confusion which probably arises from vagueness concerning this long ver-sion the existence of which tradition maintained. The actual passages that he quotes, come from no normal tantra; they are always explanatory and doctrinal, and it. is to this work that he frequently refers when he is seeking the figurative meaning of a passage. As a typical example one may refer to the matter of the corpse (p. 71 ). Again the tree and cemetery mentioned in I. vi. 6 are explained in a quotation as referring to the human body when the breath no longer roams about. Still more clearly, in introducing his discussion of Chapter 7 he says: 'From this short version just as it is taught one learns the obvious meaning (neyiirtha); the real meaning (nitiirtha) is to be learned from the Miilatantra.' Now this is a statement of considerable general significance, for while the tantra itself was intended to be understood in its obvious (and be it added in its often reprehensible) sense, the leaders of this new period per-sist in regarding it in a figurative sense, for which it provided means of expression, such as had never been fully realized at any previous stage in the development of Buddhism. It is misleading to pretend that the doctrine was now suddenly invaded and -swamped with popular and superstitious practices. This tendency existed at all times, for the Buddhists were Hindus, as there has been occasion to observe above. It is true that new ideas, some of a quite revolutionary character, now gradually enter and transform the whole doctrine, but in no sense were these new practices popular. They are based upon schemes of extreme complexity and circumscribed with all the authority of fixed traditions. The names of divinities employed may be of popular origin, but here they are endowed for the initiated with a far more profound significance, and this has the far-reaching effect of uniting in a common symbolism the aspirations of the enlightened and the simple-minded, which in any organized religion is a matter of strength and not of decrepitude. This was not a conscious intention on the part of the innovators, who were primarily concerned with their own means of release. Moreover the names that give substance to the symbolic patterns of the Hevajra-tantra are for the most part not even popular divinities, but the names of some of the lowest of Indian castes, and they appear there because women of these castes had been employed and presumably still were employed whenever 'fools' actually performed these rites. They per-sist as part of the figurative interpretation, simply because they were already there, and any set of names would serve the purpose, when once given the authority of a tradition.

On my observation Naropa, the only other commentator to quote it/ quotes nothing that does not already appear in Vajragarbha's text, and from which he may well have extracted it. The connexion between Naropa and Maitrpa2 in whose hands the work reposed was very close. I remain persuaded that this particular 'basic text' is in any case later than the tantra itself and the early commentators, SARORUHA, K~HA, BHADRA-PADA, and DHARMAKlRTI and unknown to TANKADA&t\\. and RATNAKARASANTI. The fact that there is only one known version of the tantra, apart from the fragments of similar material referred to above (p. 16) increases the likelihood of Saroruha' s merely having given circulation to an already existing text, to the age of which it becomes difficult to set a term until more tantras have been individually studied. The work was probably in dialect; hence the serious defects in scansion, when it was roughly sans-kritized. The passages that remain in dialect may therefore reflect in their linguistic forms the period in which the sanskritized version was produced, and not the date of the work itself. Tibetan tradition would in general consider the tantras as old as the siltras, explaining their relatively late appearance by the secrecy with which they were transmitted. This, how-ever, is unconvincing, for these texts only began to have importance for Buddhism when they were brought into the open, and one may err as much by laying stress on their secrecy as their supposed popularity. The rites and practices prescribed in them probably derive from considerably earlier times. All that is new is their adoption of a Buddhist garb, and this with complete disregard of the contradictions that exist. It is this stage that the tantra itself represents, but nothing will be gained by hazarding a guess of the date of this process. The amount of material still awaiting exploration is vast, and much will be gained from a comparison of a few of the funda-mental texts. We know, for example, from the Hevajra-tantra itself that it was written after the Sarvatathiigatatattvasarrzgraha.3 Not only does our text refer specifically (II. v. 57) to this work, but from internal evidence there is no doubt that it is earlier. What is of interest to us now is the manner in which these texts were accepted as part of the established order of Buddhism. They are trans-ferred from their weird and seemingly unhealthy setting to the schools and monasteries. They no longer describe those orgiastic gatherings of yogins and yoginls, but the inner process of self-integration of a man in meditation, 1 It is also quoted frequently in the Sekoddesatikii, a work also attributable to Niiropa. 2 Concerning Maitrpa see TPS i, p. 232. 3 To be found in the Narthang Kanjur rGyud, vii, fols. 213 ff.

SUBJECT-MATTER The Philosophical Basis Any form of mysticism, unless restrained by reason, is liable to find philosophical expression in a theory of absolute unity. Convinced of the essential reality of the mystical experience itself, a man may deny reality to, rational and sensual experience, which can only realize itself in diversity. Philosophically this denial can be expressed in various and apparently con~ tradictory ways; they are only apparently contradictory because the essential idea remains unchanged, namely that the one goal of all endeavour is to be found in mystical experience. It may also be asserted (as is done by the Miidhyamikas) that any attempt at philosophical expression is necessarily contradictory, because of its nature philosophical disquisition belongs to the sphere of diversity, and is therefore at best only relative to particular needs. While therefore one may reasonably speak of the development of Buddhist thought in an historical context, one remains aware that the practical end which they are seeking to define, or of which they deny any possible definition, as the case may be, is necessarily the same, for all their schools are essentially mystical. Philosophical as much as theological means of expression will affect the type of practice and therefore the type of mystical experience until it reaches the summit of achievement, the 'point' (hindu), which can know of no diversity. The theory of the one goal is itself, however, a philosophical develop-ment, finding expression in Buddhism in the doctrine of the 'One Way' (ekayiina), as also is the theory of relativity, of the essential non-sub-stantiality (niJ.r,svabhiiva) or voidness (sunyatii) of things. Both these theories could have had serious consequences for the later development of Buddhism, for if there is but one way, this may be understood as all ways being equally good, and if all doctrine is thus relative, then the choice between this doc-trine and that, Buddhist or non-Buddhist, is a matter of expediency, of finding the most effective means towards the end that is sought. But in actual fact the consequences were by no means so devastating, for the Miidhyamikas were not the only philosophers, and it is in this period that the final great synthesis of Buddhist teaching was evolved, and the concepts of the earlier period (abhidharma) brought into relationship with the new philosophical theory of absolute unity, which was now in vogue in all schools. The teachings, which in theory at least were threatened by the Miidhyamikas, were established on a new and sure foundation by the Yogiiciiras. Both are equally convinced of the reality of the mystical"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION experience, but whereas the one asserts the non-substantiality of all experi-ence and the indeterminability of any absolute itself, the other assert~ the absolute existence of the one unity which contains potentially the twofold division into this and that, into subject(griihaka) and object(griihya), and so on into ever greater diversity. This absolute is defined as thought in its pure condition, as 'just thought' (cittamatra), freed from all accidental (iigantuka) defiling processes. These defiling processes, the notion of self and other and of all sensual and rational experience, are in themselves as non-existent as the Miidhyamikas conceived of them, but for the Yogiiciiras they repose upon a basis, for they are reflections of pure thought, possessing such reality as the reflection of things in a mirror, in manifestation unreal but essentially real. But the Miidhyamikas cannot admit this distinction. For them essence (svabhava) and manifestation (Y:1;/J..ada) are equally unreal, or in terms of actual experience: 'Between nirvii?Za and Sa1JZsilra there is not the slightest shade of difference.' 1 Now the basic philosophical position of the tantras is Miidhyamika. It asserts the fundamental unity of nirvii?Za and sa1JZsilra, of mystical and sen-sual experience, and it regards all means as relative to the needs of the practiser. It is in fact in the tantras that are realized to some extent the serious consequences referred to above, but only to some extent, for the process is checked by the conservative tendencies represented by the Yogiiciiras, and the whole movement remains essentially Buddhist after all, as subsequent developments show. In the Hevajra-tantra the basic philosophic conceptions are assumed. Chapter 5 of Part I which has the title of 'Reality' (tattva) devotes only two slokas to the subject: In reality there is neither form nor seer, neither sound nor hearer, Neither smell nor one who smells, neither taste nor taster, Neither touch nor one who touches, neither thought nor thinker. In elaboration of what has been said above it may be of help to· quote in full Kal).ha's comments on this verse.2 'Form refers to blue and all other 'attributes. It is all this that does not exist. Yet how does it not exist, for one certainly sees it? It does not exist in its essential nature. An essential nature should be uncreate, transcendent, non-contingent, self-comprising, and in this capacity it does not exist, because it arises from dependent causation.

For if the essential nature of a thing existed before it~ appearance, then it would be independent of any other cause in its assump-tion of substantiality (and therefore there would be no arising). But if it is dependent on another cause, then the non-substantiality of a thing is proved. So Nagarjuna has said: \"Essential nature is uncreate'and independent of anything else, and if phenomenal things have no such essential nature, then essentially they are non-existent.\"1 But how then do forms in all their variety appear? For foolish people they do indeed appear to exist, but their essential nature is not proved by their mere appearance. To people who have defective sight do not things such as hairs or a double moon, or marks like that on a peacock's tail or bees appear in the vision? If they perceive these things because of their defective sight, then others in just the same way, the eyes of their mind affected with the myopia of ignorance, see everything which is essentially non-existent, as though it actually existed before them, just as the man of defective sight perceives the hairs. But not so the noble ones, for the eyes of their minds see beyond the defects of ignorance. And so the Bodhisattva Sarvavivaral).avi~kambhin praised the Lord Buddha, saying: \"0 Lord, when you turn the wheel of the doctrine, the elements assume their absolute state, calm from all time, from all time non-arisen, extinguished in their own nature.\"2 Thus it is established that form and the rest are essentially non-existent. Then it is said: \"there is no seer\". This refers to the perceiver of form, to the eye and the consciousness associated with it. Neither do these exist, since there is no arising of anything whatsoever, and it is the same with sound and the rest. Then it is said: \"there is no thought\". Thought ( citta) refers to conscious-ness in an absolute condition(parinifpanna) and thoughts (caittika) refer to it as contingent(paratantra) and imagined ( vikalpita). These three aspects of thought are also non-existent from the standpoint of absolute truth. But how are they non-existent, and how about those words pronounced by the Lord: \"The whole threefold world, 0 Sons of the C9nquerors, consists in nothing but thought\" ?3 True enough, but this is spoken in order to turn those who are to be converted away from their attachment to form and so on.

Thus the mystic realization, which is the highest goal (para) and the one reality (tattva) is expressed philosophically in negative terms. 'The yogin gains fulfilment (siddhi) in that which is no fulfilment, for its characteristic is the very absence of any characteristic.'2 But this same nature, which consists in absence of characteristics (alak~atz,a) and absence of essential substantiality (nil:zsvabhiiva) is also the nature of phenomenal existence (bhava), which was indicated above when it was said: 'there is no form, &c.' In this sense it has been said that the mystic realization ( = nirviitz,a) is the same as the world of everyday experience(= sa1Jlsiira) which is there-fore in truth already enlightened (buddhamaya). 'Such as is nirviitza, such is saf!lsiira. There is no nirviirza other than sa1Jlsiira, we say. Saf!lsiira con-sists in form and sound and so on, in feeling and the other constituents of personality, in the faculties of sense, in wrath, delu~i?~nd the rest. But all these elements are really nirviitza, and only fro~sion (moha) do they appear as sa1JlSiira.'3 But if Saf!lsiira is really nirvarza, then all men are already buddhas. 'All beings are buddhas: but this is obscured by accidental defilement ( iigantukamala). When this is removed, they are buddhas at once, of this there is no doubt.'4 The Theory of' Two-in-One' The purpose of the practice therefore is to remove these apparent defile-ments, which arise from nothing more than a false view of existence as it already is. The whole training consists in learning to conceive of existence in knowledge of its non-existence, and one will then automatically realize its true nature which is innate (sahaja) and a matter for self-experience (svasa1Jlvedya). But this can only be done by using existence itself as the means (upiiya) for there is no other possible.5 One creates mentally (bhiiva-yati) an idealized representation of the process of emanation of existence (utpattikrama) which is the sa1Jlsiira, and by realizing the dream-like nature of its apparent diversity, one realizes its unity in this process of realization (sa1Jlpannakrama), which is nirviitza.6 Such, briefly, is the theory, and it is clear that by its very nature it does not lend itself to rational investigation, in terms of which it may appear as }ust nonsense, a charge it would not attempt to refute, for in reply it is content to make nonsense of rational investigation itself. 7 Any discussion of its practices is also subject to limitation, for distinctions are made, only 1 Also quoted in Subhii#ta-sa1f!graha, p. 20.

If one assumes this identity from the start, then no distinction of the terms is possible and likewise no discussion. I must therefore beg much goodwill and patience of my reader, if he is to follow me through this attempted explanation. The yogin who sets out on this course, begins in an apparent duality. He desires, and may to some extent already have tasted, the mystical ex-perience ( = nirviitza), but at the same time he lives normally in a world of sensual practical experience (sa1JlSiira). In so far as the early Buddhists (sriivakas) had sought nirviitza in a deliberate stopping of the process of sarJlsiira, such mystical experience as they achieved was limited and imper-fect. It was not the end as they had thought, but merely a stage. Moreover it was limited because it was personal and therefore selfish. To bring about a cessation (nirodha) of phenomenal existence ( = dul.zkha) for oneself amounted to disregard of the sorry plight of others. Now the early mahiiyiina had already redressed this balance in its theory of the course of the bodhisattva. Such a one aspired to perfect enlightenment (samyaksa1fibodhi) and this end depended as much upon the accumulation of merit (putzya-Sa1fibhara) as upon that of knowledge (jiiiinasa1fibhara). This last might be achieved by the practice of meditation, but the first depended upon prac-tical effort. Thus while the sphere of knowledge might seem to be nirvii?Za, the sphere of effort exists in sa1JlSiira. The motive force of the one is wisdom (prajiiii) and of the other compassion (karutzii). Hence of all the perfections (piiramitii) of a bodhisattva, those of wisdom and self-sacrifice (diina) are the two most extolled. Now among these per~ections there is one of skill in means (upiiyakausalya), referring to those means by which a bodhisattva should exercise his compassion. In the total list of perfections where it appears as the seventh it receives no special significance. In the tantras, however, the 'perfections' generally belong to an inferior practice that has been transcended, but two of them remain, endowed now with a deepened significance. One of these is Wisdom which is identified explicitly with nirviitza and the other is Means (or Compassion) which is identified with sa1JlSiira. The highest truth is therefore frequently referred to as a mingling of Wisdom and Means, in that it is a realization of the essential sameness of nirviitza andsa1fisiira. To call anything the essence ofWisdomandMeans, as the Hevajra-tantra is called on its first page, is to claim for it the nature of supreme truth, and to resolve Hevajra's name into two parts, HE meaning compassion and VAJRA meaning wisdom, is to identify him with supreme being. One must be aware that these are arbitrary identifications to suit the 23"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION particular case, and that whereas V ajra here, and frequently elsewhere, symbolizes one of the coefficients of truth, it may also stand for the whole truth itself. The constant and deliberate identifying of a part with the whole is one of the chief difficulties in clear exposition. Wisdom is represented by the lotus (padma) or the bell (ghatJ.tii). The two ritual objects of vajra and bell with their known significance continue in use in Tibet to this day. In this union Wisdom, although unrealizable apart from Means, yet predominates. It has behind it the whole tradition of the Perfection of Wisdom, already actually symbolized in a feminine divinity, the Goddess Prajfiaparamita. She is therefore herself the supreme truth of the Void (silnyatii) which is the Perfection of Wisdom; in the Hevajra-tantra she is Nairatmya, 'absence of the notion of selfhood', and it is in her that the yogin, as Means, is consubstantiated. 1 At the same time this final and indestructible truth, which is also sym-bolized by the vajra, may appear under a masculine aspect,· a form no doubt more congenial to monastic Buddhism, for it was the male figure of a buddha which first received iconographic form. Then, as now, the pur-pose of these figures was that they should serve as means towards identifica-tion with the idea expressed.2 Therefore the male ~vinity, whichever iconographic type be chosen, Vairocana, Ak~obhya, or as in our tantra, Hevajra, comprehends the whole truth, as much as does the Goddess Prajfiaparamita. In order to emphasize the essential identity of the idea the female form is made to transmute into the male, 3 and the two which are thus identified are nirviitza and sa'J!lSiira. It is this dominating notion of 'two-in-one' (Tibetan: zuiz-[tjug) upon which the whole complicated structure of the tantras is reared, and this applies to its philosophy, its theology (if we may grace it with the name), and its prac-tice of yoga. If one is therefore prepared to understand it, one must expect to meet with sexual symbolism at every turn, and this can only cease to be burdensome if one is able to see beyond the symbols to the ideas. The power and (in a sense) the profundity of these symbols is very great, for while on the one hand they refer intimately to the realm of sensual experi-ence (sa1Jlsiira), they also indicate the two coefficients of mystical experience (nirviitza). In fact these symbols indicate the identity of the one with the other, in a way in which no other symbols can possibly do. Vajra and lotus derive their whole significance from their masculine and feminine connota-tions. The terms, Wisdom and Compassion (which, be it noted, is now equated with Passion), belong to the earlier phase of Buddhism, a fact which tends to obscure the new meanings with which they are endowed; the other terms employed, such as Sun and Moon, .ALI (vowel series) and 1 See II. iv. 4o-47• z See Mus, ii.

The 'Thought of Enlightenment' The symbolism does not end with these pairs, in which one may con-ceive of either member as comprehending the other. There is a third member, the seed which results of their union, sometimes referred to in all clarity as sukra, but more generally as bodhicitta, the 'thought of enlighten-ment', or even as citta, 'thought'. It has a relative ( sa1Jlvrti) and an absolute (vivrti) aspect. As the former, it is the life-force, the essence of sa1Jlsiira, and therefore manifest under the twofold aspect of the masculine and the feminine. Or it may represent (more logically) the masculine aspect only, when it is counterbalanced by rakta, 'blood', the feminine coefficient. (This fluctuation corresponds with the manner in which Hevajra alone or Hevajra embracing Nairatmya may symbolize the whole sa1Jlsiira and by implication nirviitza.) In its absolute aspect the bodhicitta is the supreme mystical experience and may be called by any of its attributes, the great bliss (mahiisukha), the self-experiencing (svasa1Jlvedya), the Innate (sahaja). All these distinctions are avowedly no distinctions, and perhaps this attempt to define these relative and absolute aspects of bodhicitta, for which there is authority in the text, illustrates how little the whole subject lends itself to logical discussion. 1 Every term deliberately has these emphases of meaning, everything overlaps as it were, just so that the distinctions may be blurred. Two other important synonyms of bodhicitta remain: it is the moon ( candra, saiin), regarded as absolute when it is the one only, or as relative, when it pairs with 'sun'; it is also Ak~obhya, for Ak~ob];lya is 'thought'2 (citta) and thought, as was mentioned above, is essentially the 'thought of enlighten-ment' (bodhicitta). Lastly in terms of secret language (sandhyiibhii~a) sukra and rakta are known as karpura (camphor) and sihlaka (frankincense).3 Thus although the two conceptions are essentially the same, one may regard the bodhicitta under two aspects: (r) as the consummation of vajra and lotus, when it is envisaged in the mystic state as the Moon which melts in the thousand-petalled lotus at the summit of the head, and flows through 1 See I. viii. 28-29 and II. iv. 29-30. 2 See diagram VII (p. 128) and diagrams on pages 27 and 28. 3 See II. iii. 59· The list given by Shahidullah (p. 9) and quoted by Eliade (pp. 254-5) consists chiefly of terms not properly sandhyiibhii$a. Terms such as lalanii, rasanii, padma, vajra, &c. are by no means 'hidden'. They may well have more than one interpretation, but that is another matter. Of that Eliade has well written (pp. 253-4): 'On se trouve dans un univers d'analogies, d'homologies et de double sens.

Now envisaged as seed, it is intimately associated with another conception, namely that of sound. We referred above to .ii.LI (vowel series) and K.ii.LI (consonant series) as apparently arbitrary terms for the basic pair (lotusfvajra), but their usage is not without its significance. Just as these have the seed as their consumma-tion, so the vowel and the consonant together produce the syllable, and this syllable indicates the mystic sound of the potential being comprehended in the seed (hzjasa1Jlgraha).2 These seed-syllables may, however, be a pure vowel, when they are essentially unmanifest, even as the primal sound A is the seed-syllable of Nairatmya, whose name indicates her true nature. Of a divinity which becomes manifest the seed-syllable consists of initial con-sonant (or consonantal group), a vowel and final¥ ( anusviira ). The anusviira is itself, however, the symbol of the seed, the hindu (point of emergence or disappearance) and is indeed written as a dot over the syllable. Every com-plete seed-syllable is therefore in itself a representation of the essential idea of vajra (kiili), lotus (iili), and consummation (hindu), but at the same time it possesses an individual character in that it consists of a particular vowel and a particular consonant.3 Thus the divinity, while being a particular manifestation, is essentially the same as any other manifestation, for they all sink into one. When Hevajra becomes manifest he springs from the seed-syllable HU¥; as unmanifest he would be represented by the sound HA, and as hodhicitta or 'moon' he is known in another context as HA1~1. It is as this that he is able to combine with Nairatmya as AHA¥-'I', which represents the reintegrated yogin. The identifications may be arbitrary and even contradictory, as one will see if one begins to apply the theory beyond the given examples of our tantra. They are essentially means, designed to train and concentrate the thought in one direction, and with this end in view one makes the requisite assertions, theorizes so far, and leaves it at that. The contradictions arise, however, not because the theory is necessarily defective, but because those who formulate it are fitting into a scheme material which already exists in a fixed or traditional form. Aha1Jl already means '1' and it conveniently consists of two parts, and so is identified in accordance with the theory, regardless of other associations. A still more obvious discordance of this kind exists with regard to the next set which we have to consider. Just as vajra and lotus have hodhicitta as their consumma-tion and consonants and vowels have the syllable ( akfara ), so Moon (night) and Sun (day) are consumed in Fire. This like all the other elements has a general (macrocosmic) and individual (microcosmic) significance. As the 1 See pp. 36-37. 2 See I. iii. 2 and 1 I.

For this reason RA:tyi which is the seed-syllable of fire is employed to initiate the whole envisaged process of emanation. For the meditating yogin it signifies the fusing in his own person of the two co-efficients represented by the breath which passes up arid down the left and right sides of the body, hence the consummation of his existence. As such it is Cal).9-ali, the goddess of fire, who burns at the navel. 1 Thus being the union of the two coefficients, she is essentially Wisdom (prajiiii) and Means (upiiya), and her name is arbitrarily explained in this way. Catzt;lii is prajfiii, we are told, and iiH is upiiya, and this in spite of the general theory that iili is feminine and corresponds with prajiiii. One has to accept such facile equations as merely emphasizing a particular meaning, and pass them by. The Yogin's Body The last set of three we have to consider are the three psychic channels which are envisaged as sustaining the yogin's body. They are suggested by the threefold scheme found in other spheres and the necessity of asserting a general concordance between macrocosm and microcosm which funda-mental theory already regards as one, and by the existence of the two sides of the human body and the two nostrils where these veins are supposed to begin. We must return to them below, and here it is sufficient to state that to the left is Lalanii, feminine and corresponding with prajiiii, to the right is Rasanii, masculine and corresponding with upiiya, while in the centre where they unite is Avadhiiti, the channel through which the means of reintegration, envisaged either as Catzt;liili (union of Sun and Moon, hence of breath to left and right) or as the bodhicitta (union of rakta and $ukra, hence also of breath to left and right)' reaches the Moon in the thousand-petalled lotus of the head.

(See however I. i. 14-) Sattva is also bracketed because it occupies a special position. It is the bija envisaged as 'being in its ideal form', namely Vajrasattva, 'adamantine being', who is identical with Hevajra or any other i#adevatii. The 'Unity of Three' Such then is the complex mystery at the heart of nirvii'!la and sat{lSiira. It is this that is referred to as the Body, Speech, and Mind of all the Buddhas, as the Three Adamantine Ones (trayo vajrina/:l), as the unity of three states of being ( tribhavasyaikatii), and may be indicated by any agreed name. 1 It pervades all things for there is nothing other than it, and yet transcends all things for it is not involved in their accidental and purely unreal defilement. It can be experienced only by learning to associate oneself with its true nature, which is identical with one's own true nature, and so on. The identity of this with all other iitman theories, and particularly with · later Vedanta, is apparent. But it represents too the essence of Miidhyamika theory, with which it maintains a far closer association by the using of their philosophical terms. For the commentators, as has already been indicated by the quotation from Kal).ha, there is no doubt that this is the true position. Apart from'the threefold formula of personality (Body, Speech, and Mind), and the three root-evils (Delusion; Desire, and Wrath) there are the three aspects of existence, absolute, contingent, imagined, and the theory of the three bodies of a buddha. Now these last suggest not a unity of three integrated principles, but a graduation of states of existence, which one may associate with the cosmological conception of the three worlds, kiimadhiitu, rilpadhiitu, and arilpadhiitu. 2 It is in fact as these three that Dharmakirti (alone of the commentators) interprets this phrase 'unity of three states of being', and it is as a vertical series that the text envisages them, associating them also with certain places in the human body, an aspect of the matter to be considered more fully below, and added only now that this may serve as a future connecting link.3 Position Formula Yogini Buddha Root-evils Position Buddhaktiya in space of personality in body Zenith Speech Khecari AMITABHA raga throat smpbhoga Centre Mind Nairiitmyii AK~OBHYA dve~a heart dharma Nadir Body Bhucari VAIROCANA moha navel nirmd1Ja 1 See I. x. 8-u. 2 Attention has been drawn several times to the associations that exist between the different stages of spiritual advance (see also below, p. 35) and the external spheres of existence.

It is clear that the stages are not ascending, for it is the centre that is in every case of prime importance. Mind (citta) corresponds with consciousness (vijiiiina), considered as the chief of the five skandhas, the other four being envisaged horizontally at the four ·points of the com-pass (diagram IV p. 127). Its association with bodhicitta, which is the hindu (point), has already been mentioned above. Of Nairatmya too, as the Per-fection of Wisdom (prajiiapiiramita), the final truth of the Void (suny at a), we have spoken. Akl?obhya is the hypostasis of Hevajra, who is frequently referred to in the text as the one whose nature is wrath (dve~iitman). The buddhas Amitabha and Vairocana with their corresponding passions all belong to the more usual fivefold scheme, when they are shown on the horizontal plane (diagrams V and VIII). We note that the dharmakiiya, the chief member of this set of three, is where one would expect it in this scheme, at the centre, corresponding with the heart. The M mp;lala The whole horizontal ma'l}t}ala is an idealized representation of the identity of nirvii'l}a and sa1J1Siira. Hence on it there appear in stylized form the various aspects of absolute being under the names of different divinities and also certain set categories of phenomenal existence. It is the process of identification of the latter with the former which is referred to as the process of purification ( visuddhi). In the identification, for example, of wrath with Akl?obhya, the aspect of phenomenal existence is seen to be none other than an aspect of absolute existence. To symbolize and to purify (in this sense) is essentially the same thing. The simplest form of ma'l}tjala is that shown on diagram VIII, where the five Buddhas, who embody the five tran-scendent wisdoms, 1 are equated with the five evils that lie at the root of phenomenal existence. This simple scheme is of great interest in that it illu rates so well the fantastic conclusions that extreme monism of this kind st arrive at, when its sole measure of what is real (tattva) is the mystic state. One identifies in fact those states, human passions and feelings and so on, which are now no longer experienced directly, with the blissful state of unity which is being experienced, and then when one emerges from this state, one envisages those passions and so on, now actually experienced, as so many aspects of the one mystic unity. One thereby transforms idealistically the whole of phenomenal existence into a mystic absolute, and in this vision of reality all forms are recognized as symbolic reflections at various stages of remove from the unity of the centre. Meanwhile in his delusion the ordinary man persists in regarding them as separate entities. 1 Seep. 129 and I. viii. 6-7, where the terms are translated. See also Mahiiytinasiitrti-la1[1kiira, ed. S.

The actual pattern of the matztfala employed and the sets of divinities are always a conventional expression of the idea and so varied from school to school. In conformity with the five-fold notion, men are envisaged as belonging by nature to one of five families, each represented by one of the Five Buddhas, and the matztfala suitable for such a man would have the Buddha of his family at the centre. 1 This would correspond with a predominance in the man's nature of delusion, wrath, passion, envy, or malignity. This seems in the main a mere theoretical elaboration of the master's responsibility to find the right means for his pupil. I would have no doubt that behind the traditional formulas there lay much sound practical psychology. The great masters often had many tantras at their disposal, and 'it was the rule for them to teach those they were training in accordance with their propensities'. 2 Hence there arises the need to find the right master, and his great importance when once he has been found, for only he can indicate the way. All this is quite reason-able within its setting, and serves once more to emphasize the seriousness of the intention, were one still inclined to doubt it. The Indian's delight in the elaboration of schemes can often give an appearance of artificiality and improbability to an idea that is in itself quite genuine. Such is the case with these five families, which are listed with all their associations in diagram V. The Hevajra-tantra belongs to the Vajra-family, of which Ak~obhya or one of his wrathful manifestations, Hevajra, Heruka, or Sarpvara is the head. Wrath is therefore at the centre and the aspect of the divinities is wrathful. At the same time this work is called a Yogini-tantra, 3 in that its circles are peopled entirely with feminine divinities, even at the centre, where instead of Hevajra we sometimes find his consort, Naira:tmya, alone, albeit in a wrathful manifestation, for he and she are essentially one as was shown above. One would suspect a superimposition of one distinct cycle upon another, for whereas Hevajra appears with a troupe of eight goddesses (diagram II), Nairatmya appears with a troupe of fourteen (diagram III). This distinction is maintained in the few relevant siidhanas to be found in the Siidhanamiilii (nos. 228, 229, 230, 231, and 247). The redactor of our tantra is also aware of the distinction, for he makes Nairatmya say: 'You have spoken of our circle with its troupe of fifteen. But what is your own mm;ujala like, 0 Lord? Of this I have so far known nothing?' One may observe that this last comment is untrue for the work as it now exists, for Hevajra's cycle has already been given in Chapter 3 of Part I, where he appears in a two-armed form with his troupe of eight. Here in Chapter 5 of Part II the number of attendants is not increased, but he appears in full I Concerning these families see Buddhist Himalaya, pp. 64-67, 74-75. a Tiiraniitha, tib. text, p. 147, 1!. 14-15. 3 See Glossary, pp. 132 & 138. 30"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"SUBJECT-MATTER manifestation with sixteen arms and also embracing Nairiitmyii. That, however, the two cycles were in fact completely combined is shown by the thanka reproduced as our frontispiece, where he appears in the full com-pany of sixteen. But Nairatmyii's company is probably equally composite in nature, although in the text it already appears fully conventionalized. The eight yoginis of the outer circle belong specifically to Hevajra, and it is possible that her company consists of an original five as in diagram VIII. That two such sets of five and eight were employed separately in actual ritual is indicated in the text itself, I. x. s, where five is the given number, and II. v. sS, where eight is the number required. (The separate nature of the remaining two, Khecari and Bhiicari, has been shown above on p. 28.) The names appertaining to the two sets are also distinct: the inner five are goddesses proper, while the outer eight are the names of women of low caste or of eight feminine relatives. Nor would Gauri have been duplicated if the set had been originally composite. The essential feature of a matpjala is its regularity towards the various directions, for the first thing it must express is emanation from a centre into space. As the divinities in whose forms the process of emanation (utpattikrama) is expressed, have the value of pure symbol, their forms and their number are relevant only to the categories in terms of which the meditator conceives of his own personality, for it is these two things, the divine forms (nirvii:t.za) and the components of his own self (sa1JZsiira), which are to be identified. The simplest set is the set already referred to, in which the five skandhas are symbolized and purified. Or the number may be increased to nine, when the five skandhas and four elements are symbolized. The normal representation of these comprises the Five Buddhas and the four goddesses, Locana (earth), Miimaki (water), Pal).<;lara (fire), and Tara· (air), as shown in the diagram on page so. The fifth element, space, coa~ces with consciousness (vijfiiina) at the centre. The et of fifteen permits the inclusion of the six spheres of sense as is seen in' iagram IV. Vajragarbha is also concerned to include the six faculties of sense (II. iii. so), but this can logically be done only by increasing the size of the troupe. The names he is given in reply, however, suggest merely a duplicating of places, for the number fifteen in this tantra is inviolate. It is envisaged as corresponding with the fifteen vowels and the fifteen phases of the moon, and Hevajra as bodhicitta with the moon itself. 1 So the whole mal).<;lala like the symbol of the vajra or of any divine form is still but an expression of the one same idea, more complex in manifesta-tion but in essence identical.

They represent in every case the essential identity of nirvii1Ja and satJZsiira, with which it is the aim of the meditator to identify himself. At one time he may select as means the form of his chosen divinity (i:Jtadevatii) and concentrate upon it one-pointedly. '0 Wise One, you should conceive of existence in knowledge of its non-existence, and likewise you should conceive of Heruka in knowledge of his non-existence.'1 And again: 'The sa!fisiira is Heruka's phenomenal aspect, and he is the Lord, the saviour of the world.'2 At set times one should therefore practise concentrated meditation (samiihitayoga) upon him, and at all other times in whatever activities one may be engaged, one should seek to be mindful of union with him (nirantarayoga).3 The whole process of concentrated meditation is fully described in Part I, Chapter 3· After the preliminaries, the purification of the site and of one's own person, the evocation is begun. This may proceed in various ways in accordance with the meanings of the symbols suggested above. One may first envisage the syllable RA!yl which is the primeval fire. In this one envisages a crossed-vajra, symbol of the absolute centre, and then at the heart of this the syllable HU!yl which is the essence of Heruka or Hevajra. One may com-plicate the process by envisaging this vajra, the adamantine essence, as first transforming itself into a protected palace, at the centre of which Hevajra is enthroned. 4 Or one may commence the whole process with the lotus in the stylized form of the triangle of origination (see I. viii. 3). From this the elements in due order are envisaged as arising, each repre-sented by their particular syllable, YAJYI RAJYI VAJYI LAJYI. Or one may envisage Sun and Moon and then the seed (blja) which is their union. They are all merely expedients for concentrating the mind along a due succession of events which represents the emanation of existence (utpattikrama) and therefore they may be combined in any logical order, for it is the effect produced that is alone important. One may envisage the final stage of 1 See I. i. II. 2 See II. ix. zo. 3 Seep. 89 fn. 4 See Tucci, Teoria e Pratica del Ma1J¢ala, p. 31: 'Questa (la montagna Sumeru, !'axis mundi) e una concezione panasiatica cui hanno contribuito a dare chiarezza e precisione le idee cosmografiche espresse nello zikurrat assiro-babilonese, poi riflesse nello schema della citta imperiale dei re iranici e quindi nell' immagine ideale della reggia del cakravartin, il monarca universale delle tradizioni indiane.' See also J. Przyluski: 'La Ville du Cakra-vartin', Rocznik Orientalistyczny, v, pp. 165 ff. The ma1J¢ala, the primary function of which is to express the truth of emanation and return (smpstira and nirvti1Ja), is the centre of the universe. Hence it involves all previous tradition associated with this idea. Its core is Mt. Meru; it is the palace of the universal monarch, it is the royal stiipa; it is even the fire-altar where one makes the sacrifice of oneself. This last idea finds expression in the figurative interpretation given to the rite of slaying (mtira1Ja). It seems that all these notions were perhaps involved in the Buddhist stiipa itself (see Mus, Borobu{lur, i, pp. 233-53); it is as a stiipa that the ma1J¢ala is primarily envisaged (see I. x. c. and II. v. c.)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"SUBJECT-MATTER emanation as the mm;f/ala of sixteen divinities, or one may envisage it as countless forms of Hevajra filling space in a regularized order in every direction. Then one must realize the identity of oneself with the whole process by associating one's personality with the emanation, which is achieved by a strenuous act of belief: OJJf. HERUKA-svabhiiviitmako 'HAJJf.-'I am of the essence of Heruka'. The imagined forms are con-ceived as sinking into one's own heart, and from here the process may be repeated, so that one becomes oneself the twofold process of emanation and absorption, of satf1siira and nirviitza. This is the unity of Wisdom and Means which remains unharmed by this twofold process of origination and dissolution, for Means is the origination and Wisdom the dissolution.1 One need not doubt the effectiveness of such concentration, if practised regularly over a period of time. 'Try it', says our text persuasively, 'try it one fortnight with zeal, making final realization your goal, abandoning all discursive thought, your mind set on the form of the divinity.'2 The Ritual of Union It is only after such practice and more of which our text tells nothing, that the pupil comes before his master with his yogini.3 Of the actuality of 1 See II. ii. 27. 2 II. ii. 8-9. 3 Of the actual method of controlling the physical functions the text tells nothing directly. They are, however, clearly implied in the more general statements (II. iv. e). The Taoists, treating of similar practices, are certainly more explicit. See the article by Henri Maspero, Les Proddes de 'Nourrir le principe vital',JA 229 (1937), pp. 177-252 and 353-430. The various processes are here described explicitly, whereas in the Indian texts one is presented primarily with schemes and patterns. Nor is any distinction made between an imagined and an actual physical process, because no such distinction is recognized. One surmises that the real process was elaborated to conform with a theoretical scheme, just as the master's responsibility towards his pupil is elaborated into the theory of the ve families (see above, p. 30). This has the effect of concealing what is actually involv and I doubt whether this particular problem is soluble. To ask what may appear to us an -important question: 'Are the cakras within the body conceived of as real psychic centres, or are they an imagined device like the external mmpjala ?' is to bring contradiction into the whole basic theory from the standpoint of the texts. For them the whole process, internal and external, is bhtivanti (mental production), and the ma1Jrjala, although imagined (bhtivita) exists on a higher plane of reality than the phenomenal world it represents. Likewise the idealized representation of the body, consisting of the veins and cakras, exists on a higher plane than the normal physical structure of the body. Then, finally, these higher stages themselves are dissolved. The S\\lme applies to the divine forms. They are not pure symbol as we might interpret them. We regard them as unreal in the beginning. The Buddhists, however, regard them as real in the beginning, more real than flesh and blood. Hence arises the need of insisting that the divine form too consists of just something that comes into existence (II. ii. 45). In fact the very power of these gods as means of purification (visuddhi) resides in the initial belief that they instilled. They are the essence of sarpstira, and one must learn to conceive of them in terms of their non-existence. To call such use symbolic is not adequate, for as pure symbol they would be powerless. Nor is any real distinction to be made between an esoteric and exoteric interpretation, between the few who know all these things are symbols, and the many who place faithful trust in them. Th'ey all, siddhas and Prthagjanas alike, believe in these gods. The siddhas have, however, trained themselves to regard them as though they were non-existent.

It is, however, one of several means, and whether it was employed or not, depended upon the predisposi-tion of the pupil. If one is to judge it rightly, one must see it as part of the whole context. The realization in oneself of sa'f[lsiira and nirviitza is the serious and avowed intention. One may regard this as no true end for the best of human endeavour and as founded upon an incomplete conception of the nature of existence, but one must still in all fairness view its practices in the light of its intention, and not censure these as though they were wanton acts of foolishness. Mter such preliminary training as they both received, it is to be expected that the yogin and the yoginl should experience their union as the union of Wisdom and Means in the avowed sense. The retention of the bodhicitta may well have produced from natural causes an intensified sensation of potential bliss, which under the influence of all preceding mental training and the impressiveness of the actual ceremony would be experienced as something more than natural, as the Bliss Innate that transcended any local manifestation. Nor would this interpretation conflict with the views of those practisers themselves, for whom the whole process is a mental production (bhiivanii) and for whom every form and ritual is a mere support. This particular rite is envisaged as proceeding by four stages, which are marked by four consecrations given by the master, and are experienced as four successive 'joys', known at four successive 'moments'.

To think one has done so is not sufficient. One is then placed in the predicament of explain-ing away much that is unacceptable, and one manner of doing this is an appeal to symbolism and esoteric interpretation; but these are notions that have no meaning in a genuine tradition. A distinction is made, it is true, between an inner (adhyiitmika) and outer (biihya) interpretation with regard to the actual rites, but they remain rites none the less, and the distinction arises from no embarrassment with regard to them, or desire to explain them away. On the contrary the outer sense is usually commended as necessary to lead men to the inner, which is precisely their use. The position is completely reversed ·by certain European and modern Indian exponents of these doctrines, who commend them to us for their esoteric significance, as though one could dispense with all else. Such an interpreta-·tion is historically inaccurate. Those Buddhists believed, and it was necessary for their whole scheme of 'release' that they should believe, in those gods and magical practices for their own sakes, before they began to use them as means. There was no short-cutting of this way, or the means would have been completely ineffective; nor indeed were they inclined to believe otherwise. The task now of trying to understand becomes very much more difficult, and can only be attempted when one has amassed sufficient knowledge of the historical and religious setting of the times to permit one to see cert11in practices in a sufficient context. Such a view can scarcely be perfect, but it is the on.ly possible approxima-tion, and that one can draw very close, is shown by the work of Paul Mus. 34"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"SUBJECT-MATTER Their mere enumeration is sufficient to suggest an analogy with other four-fold schemes by which the stages of spiritual ascent were indicated. There were four stages towards arhatship (srota-iipanna, sakrdagamin, anagamin, arhattva-pratipanna), four stages of dhyana, and still more obviously the four stages, analogous with sleep, jiigrat, svapna, su~upti, turlya, where the last stage is likewise known as the 'fourth'. It is therefore in accordance with precedent that our stages are now fixed as four. Nevertheless there is some disagreement with regard to the ordering of the four Joys and the four Moments. Whenever it lists them, the Hevajra-tantra gives them in what would appear to be the normal order, yet it twice defines the Joy Innate as preceding the Joy of Cessation (I. x. 18 and II. ii. 40) in contradiction even with a definition elsewhere (I. viii. 24) where it is regularly called the End of Cessation. That two traditions existed with regard to the ordering of these Joys is confirmed by Dharmakirti. 'Some people say', he says, 'that Cessa-tion is last and the Innate is third' (xvii. 418b 4). Maitrpa clearly supported this view.1 That both traditions should appear in the Hevajra-tantra may be a sign of mixed origins. The transcendental nature of this Joy Innate is emphasized as far as words permit. The other three joys are of this world, but the Innate exists not in these three.2 It is not passion (raga= paramananda) nor the absence of passion (araga = viramananda), nor yet a middle state (iinanda).3 It is both void (Sunya) and non-void (asunya) which is the nature of Heruka.4 One suspects that the placing of the Joy Innate as third is, however, in direct analogy with the ritualistic embrace and actual experience. As third, it is followed by the Joy called Cessation, which is a return to normal experience. The corresponding moments are that which has no charac-tedstics (vilak~atza) and that which consists of the 'reflection' (vimarda): 'I have enjoyed this bliss.' This is Maitrpa's contention in supporting this order. 'If vimarda is such reflection, how can it be understood as third?' Such discussion serves to indicate the very transitory nature of the experi-ence and the very delicate distinction that must always have existed between the two, orders of enjoyment.

Up and down these channels passes the breath, conceived of as vital force and having the nature of rakta to the left and sukra to the right. So long as breath continues in this manner, so thought continues to wander· uncontrolled. The initial part of the process consists therefore in harnessing thought to the breath, achieved by concentrating the thought upon the breathing process. One manner of doing this is to imagine the vowel series (Xu) as passing in and out with the breathing to the left and the consonant series (KA.LI) passing in and out to the right. By concentrating upon this both breath and thought become controlled. Running up the centre of the body a third vein is imagined. This is known as Avadhiiti and represents the union of Wisdom and Means. Meeting it at cross section, at the navel, the heart, the throat, and the head, there are imagined four lotuses of varying numbers of petals, representing minor veins. These four lotuses or radiating circles ( cakras) correspond with the four stages of spiritual advance, viz. the four Joys which we have discussed above. As is usual there is some contradiction in the actual arrangement, for the first Joy may be envisaged at the navel and the Joy Innate in the head, or vice versa. There seems to be some reason for both these schemes as we shall see below. At the base of the genitals where all three channels come together, Lalanii descending from the left, Rasanii descending from the right and Avadhiiti ascending at the centre, there resides the bodhicitta in its relative condition ( = sukra) and quiescent. At the summit of the head (brahma-randhra) there resides the bodhicitta in its absolute condition(= mahiisukha) also quiescent and known as Moon. Such in the simplest terms is the imagined structure of the body. Now the breath to which thought is harnessed is first made to pass regularly up and down the two outer channels, which thereby enact under strict control the process of sa1Jlsiira. The breath becomes quiescent and the two psychic streams thus controlled are held and forced, as other escape is denied them, to enter the base of the central channel. At their meeting they arouse the bodhicitta which resides there. Their contact, which is the contact of Wis-dom and Means, of Sun and Moon, is envisaged as Fire which is Cal).<;lali, and so Cal).4ali burns. 1 As seed-syllable she is the syllable A, and as a blazing ' A it may be imagined.

She is now envisaged as moving upwards, consuming as she goes, from the navel to the heart and thence to the throat and the head. Then she reaches the bodhicitta in the head, the Moon, here envisaged as the syllable HA:tyi. This melts at the contact and flows downwards through the central vein, pervading the whole body through the various cakras as it goes. It reaches the iowest cakra and A and HA:tyl become AHA¥ ( = 'I', the reintegrated self) in the Joy Innate. This is the process portrayed in the texts, the final consummation, towards which the practice with mm_ujalas and mudriis and dhyana and japa lends its aid, and in the realization of which they are all transcended. This is the process of which the doha-verses sing: · When the mind goes to rest, The bon<;ls of the body are destroyed, And when the one flavour of the Innate pours forth, There is neither outcast nor brahmin. Here is the sacred Jumna and here the River Ganges, Here are Prayaga and Benares, here are Sun and Moon. Here I have visited in my wanderings shrines and such places of pilgrimage, For I have not seen another shrine blissful like my own body. 1 The absence of any rationality is sufficient in itselfto account for inevitable contradictions and duplications, of precisely the kind which we have referred to above. Thus the sound A at the navel is both the bodhicitta (masculine in association) and Nairatmya (feminine in association) who unites with the bodhicitta in the head. Bodhicitta is in one sense itself sukra and yet it results from a union of Wisdom and Means, which themselves may be calledTaktn--and sukra. The reason for all these cross-identifications we have given above: Also the twofold movement upward and downward in the process of reintegration may well account for the Joy Innate being conceived in the head and in the navel. It is with fundamental variations of this kind in mind that one hesitates to commit oneself to any one particular scheme, as they clearly varied from one school or one master to another, much as the external ma'!lrfala might be varied. Nevertheless they always represent the same intention, namely to emphasize the identity of micro-cosm with macrocosm by locating the various orders of existence within the body at the level of the various cakras. The Hevajra-tantra itself is consistent in its allusions (I. i. c and II. iv. h) to this theory. The basis is provided by the three bodies (kaya) of a buddha, increased by addition of the fourth, known as the 'Self-Existent Body' (svabhavikakaya), the 'Innate Body' (sahajakaya) or the 'Body of Great Bliss' (mahiisukhakaya).

Or likewise the four schools, Sthavara, Sarvastivada, Sammitiya, and Mahasaizghika, as symbolizing the presence of the whole saizgha within the body, or likewise the four elements, earth, water, fire, air, or the four tites of prospering (pu~ti), pacifying ( santi), overpowering ( vaiya ), and destroying (maratza), as symbolizing the existence of all power within the body. This last set lends itself badly to such allocation, as there are far more than four such rites. In this context the only one of importance amongst them is the rite of slaying (maratza) which with the interpretation of the 'slaying of the notion of a self' is equated with the Joy Innate and is used as a synonym for it. Nor is it practicable to insert the Five Buddhas in a vertical order because of their number.2 They may, however, be envisaged as there at 1 See Dasgupta, Introduction to Ttintric Buddhism, p. 163. There is no doubt that this is the traditional arrangement. For its application to Tibetan ritual, see Buddhist flimiilaya, pp. 233-4.

Moreover the different cakras are envisaged as no more or less real than the circles of the external ma'l}(iala. In the condition of the Joy Innate their distinctions, which were mere means, are all absorbed. It is in this sense that of the pair Wisdom/Means Wisdom remains supreme, for although without Means she is unrealizable, it is she that absorbs her partner, and never the reverse. She is the eternally quiescent one, and it is from her that he emerges, and then from their union springs all manifested form, envisaged as the circle of divinities. It is he who weaves the web of miiyii and by means of him, who is the Means, that one returns to her. So the yogin must himself become Hevajra for Hevajra is the Means. IV. OBSERVATIONS Such then is the serious intention of this tantra, with which we can find no fault that might not also be found in earlier stages of Buddhism. There is no Buddhism known that does not set chief store by meditation, and this is but a special means of meditation. It uses mystic syllables, but these were in use long before Saroruha produced this text. It uses mystic circles and divine forms as a~· ds t concentration, but forms. of the buddhas worked in stone had now bee ong in use, and it is in terms of the traditional stupa that the matzfjal is conceived in the Hevajra-tantra. It consists of an inner circle, surrounded by four walls with four entrances and four portals (toratza). It has eight columns (two at each entrance), and is decorated with chains and garlands. As for the actual yoga-practice, there was nothing new in the breath-control which still plays the predominant role in a developed technique. Nor is this developed technique, it seems, anything new in principle, for at most it involved increased control of the physical processes of the body, which in some measure had always been recognized as neces-sary. If control of the breath was already recognized as a means towards the achieving of a desired mental condition, then to control also the seminal fluid and thereby gain even better results, is but an advance along the same path. The deliberate eating and drinking of things abhorrent differs nothing in kind from the deliberate meditation upon unpleasant things, such as the gross nature of the human body or the manner of disintegration of a corpse, practices which had previously been found helpful in overcoming natural pp. us-27). There is clearly great variety in these lists, and contradictions can easily be shown even within a single tradition, if one checks the lists for cross-references. They seem to have no significance, apart from purely local modes of meditation, and more often they seem to merely represent ill-conceived attempts at needless systematization. 39"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION aversion and instilling the virtue of indifference (upek~ii). One conceives too easily perhaps of Buddhism in terms of the abstract theories of a few famous philosophers, and so when in the tantras one is brought face to face with actual practices, the like of which had long been practised, one may exclaim too readily that these cannot be Buddhist. 1 That new elements are introduced, the effect of which is far-reaching, there is no denying, but there is no essential break in the development of the doctrine. One might even claim that these new elements far from issuing in a degeneration, brought about a rejuvenation, nourished in the hidden well-springs of Indian religious life. For it is not the philosopher who gives life to a religion, but the man who succeeds in practising it, and in India the practiser par excellence has always been the yogin. One may well, by present standards, dislike the actual practices of certain yogins, and may thus far refer to them as a degeneration, but this term is relevant only to our judgement, and its use does not mean that Buddhism necessarily suffered from contact with them. This seems to be but a European fable, given substance only by the cataclasmic disappearance of the doctrine from India at the time when the tantras were in vogue. To Islam Sakyamuni was as much a demon as Hevajra. The later Buddhists themselves conceived of their type of Buddhism as the best and most effective, and since they are not profligates who commend it for the licence it permits them, but serious practisers and scholars, their words are not without importance when we attempt to appreciate this phase of the doctrine. To any who conceive of Buddhism as just philosophy, this preoccupation with ritual and techniques of yoga may well appear a riot of degeneration, but to a Buddhist who conceived of his religion primarily as an art of yoga and who had never neglected the use of ritual, it might very reasonably have appeared as the most effective teaching ever sponsored under the name of Buddha. 'Because it is free from doubt as to the oneness of its purpose, because of its absence of difficulty, because of its many methods, and because it is adapted to keen senses, this mantra-teaching is the best.'2 When we examine too what new things this period introduced into the Buddhist stream, we find they are a cause of strength rather than of weak-ness. The new notion that was perhaps most radical in its effect is that of buddhahood to be achieved in one lifetime. This hope of rapid success brings an actuality into the religious biographies of this period, however fantastic they still remain in many details, and the religious ideal of the mahiisiddha coincides with the historical examples. Whereas who can point to the bodhisattva, the great being, who pursues his career through aeons 1 Mus, p. 594: 'L'element culture!, capital pour !'etude du bouddhisme indien en sa riche substance, est trop souvent sacrifie a !'etude des dissentiments d'ecole, plus com-modes d'acces que les faits rituel.' . ..

He remains primarily a great ideal, a subject rather for theoretical elaboration than for actual practice. The stories that tell of his virtues are fantastic in their whole purport and the very stages of his advance are acknowledged as unreal in their true nature. Now it is at least under-standable for a man to train himself to regard all phenomenal things as essentially unreal, if he can hope to experience the final bliss associated with that experience in or at the end of his present life. There is some motive for self-sacrifice and arduous self-training if the goal is within his grasp. But what incentive is there to pursue an ideal realizable after aeons of time, when every stage of progress is unreal and imagined? In actual fact the ideal remained far more modest, as represented perhaps by such men of learning and sanctity as Hsiian-Tsang met in his travels, or by yogins and ascetics possessed of special powers, in the existence of which the followers of the Buddha had always believed. The tantras seem then to mark a new recognition of the actuality of the religious life as con-ceived in those days. They descend from superb flights of fancy to a realizable ideal; one may dislike this ideal and its means of realization, but it was at least practicable and apparently successful. For there seems no reason to doubt the efficacy of the psychological training and the theory of evocation on which it is chiefly based. This was a matter of self-knowledge in the full sense of the term, for it was necessary to exteriorize all hidden innate tendencies that they might be known and transmuted. The matJrfala served but as a support [Pi this process, and the intricate forms it often assumed indicate the ynnplexity of the task. That the divinities should be manifest in fierce forms, a stumbling-block to some Europeans who take interest in Indian art, would also be in accordance with the theory, for the hidden tendencies are fierce and destructive in their nature. Neither India nor Tibet has become impervious to the notion of 'religious dread' (my-sterium tremendum ), and this has found expression in fierce divine forms. 1 By the simple worshipper these are placated in the world without, but by the meditator they are transmuted in the world within. The realization of the essential identity of man with the universal being was one of the first fruits of Indian reflective thought, and it remains fundamental to all prac-tice of yoga and to most philosophical exposition. To reintegrate the one was therefore automatically to reintegrate the other, and thus to save one-self might be identified with saving all beings. 'There are no other means in the sat[tSiira for achieving the weal of yourself and others.'2 The fierce tendencies must be evoked and transformed, for it is they that produce the appearance of misery (dul.zkha). In this whole process of self-help nothing I Concerning the notion of mysterium tremendum see Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy translated by J. W. Harvey, Oxford, 1928.

This may well be done by simple folk who conceive of these imagined beings as other than themselves, and the meditator may well himself make use of such devotional practices as a psychological preparation, but they are essentially useless in the final stages, where it is the fierce aspect of the self that must be transmuted. If they are found ever to be morbid and pathological, it suggests that precisely these tendencies were to be overcome. One might well generalize and contend that it is the function of all religious practice to restore to its rightful con-dition that which is conceived as defective. Such is certainly the avowed intention of the practices which we have been discussing, and it was in their very power of giving expression to those things that we naturally find un-pleasant that their effectiveness consisted. To dislike the tantras, is but to dislike the worst tendencies in man, and of the terrible existence of these tendencies we have ample experience in every generation. The tantras claimed to remove like by like, and so of what else should they tell? With all their excesses and defects of presentation they may well contain much that is relevant to modern thought, for they present a genuine stratum of human experience. The texts themselves of course are merely suggestive and complete evaluation is only possible in a living tradition. There is' nothing superstitious in the idea of a necessary succession from master to pupil, nor in the idea of the essential secret being lost, if no succession took place. Other techniques lost in such a way are by no means unknown in the history of man. In this whole setting the rite of maithuna ceases to be a matter of con-cern, and it would be absurd to defend it by pretending that the intention was solely symbolical. Whether performed or not, it is the idea that counts, and this idea is certainly central in the whole conception of this new reintegration. 1 And necessarily so, for it represents a most powerful tendency 1 The whole conception of two-in-one is fundamental to Tantric Buddhism, viz. that Buddhism which seeks its authority in the tantras, conceived as Buddha-word. But sexual symbolism was not necessarily involved and seems to have been a secondary development. See in this respect an excellent article by Glasenapp, 'Tantrismus und Saktismus', Ost-asiatische Zeitschrijt, 1936, pp. 120-33. The term Saktismus itself is, however, not properly applicable to Buddhist developments (see below, p. 44) as Glasenapp is aware, but he omits to draw the full conclusions. 'Die Vereinigung des Buddha mit seiner Sakti im Korper der groBen Lust (mahiisukha-kiiya) ist das Symbol des Verschmelzens des Be-. wuBtseins (vijiiiina) in der Leere (Sunyatii), die selige Aufhebung aller Zweiheit. Wenn sich der Upiiya (d. h. die Methode der aktiven Heilspropaganda) und die Prajiiii( die Erkenntnis) miteinander vereinen, dann ist damit der hi:ichste geistige Schopfungsakt zur Tatsache geworden.

Never, however, does this coupling mean anything other than the absorbing of upiiya into prajfiii, and in this sense Wisdom (prajfiii) always predominates.

It is therefore the chief thing to be symbolized, and to symbolize, one must remember, is to transmute. This is therefore no degrading of religion, but just the reverse, an ennobling of the natural con-dition, or rather a realization of the essential purity ( visuddhi) of the natural condition. It is Sat[lsiira that is to be realized as nirvii~a. We have referred above to the dangerous nature of this whole theory of identification, and drawn attention to the false assumption that seems to underlie it, but in this instance the followers of the tantras seem to be specially secure from criticism, for this bond was a sanction of the highest order which Indian religion recognized, namely the obtaining of supreme enlightenment (sam-yaksa1Jlbodhi). If misused it became automatically, as should any intended sacrament, the means of certain misery (dul;kha), which for them is sa1ft-sara, unrecognized for what it really is, involving wretched conditions in future lives. Those who behaved thus were the fools, to whom reference is made, for the followers of the tantras were themselves well aware of these dangers. It is only unfortunate that at times the canonical texts themselves seem to succumb to the danger. 1 The wording often seems so precise that it can be only the obviously literal interpretation that was intended. Vajra-garbha even says that this was so.2 In those circles where the Hevajra-tantra had its origin, there can be little doubt that it was believed that the body would be nourished and so become endowed with special powers, if certain sacraments (samaya), consisting of various kinds of human flesh or more repulsive articles, were consumed.3 To consume these in the accepted Buddhist sense, means to consume the Five Buddhas and thus to purify ( visudh) the Five Evils. If in the beginning this had been the intended sense, it would have seemed unnecessary to enumerate the articles with such precision. Yet in the main a clear Buddhist connotation is implied. The whole text seems to require different stages of interpretation, if one is in every case to understand it as the actual authors intended it. But it has seemed to me enough to attempt to understand it in its acceptable Buddhist sense, as interpreted in fact by its commentators. At the same time there is no absolute distinction to be drawn between any of the ritual and its figurative meaning, since the final purpose of the ritual is nothing other than that meaning, and at any stage it might still be employed without necessarily belying the higher intention. The fool was not he who did these things, but he who did them ignorant of their true import. This applies particularly to the important rite of maithuna. In its symbolic interpretation it may be associated with the idea of mystic absorp-tion into the great prajiiiipiiramitii, an idea which is never dissociated from graphically) predominated.

This idea precedes the tantras themselves; they seem to give it actual substance for a period, and then it returns again to the sphere of pure idea. It is in the actual interpretation of this rite that the Buddhist tantras differ chiefly from the non-Buddhist, and it is unfortunate that the relative ignorance concerning Buddhist tantras should have permitted reference to . them with terminology which is just not properly applicable. In recent European and Indian works the feminine element is now regularly referred to as the sakti, but yet she is no sakti (active power). She is here prajiiii, the eternally quiescent one, and it is by means of her partner (upiiya) that phenomenal existence comes about. The whole idea of power is essentially absent where she is concerned, and to refer to Hevajra and his sakti, or any other Buddhist male divinity 'and sakti', already now the practice in our museums, reveals a misunderstanding of the whole Buddhist concep-tion. If we must use a Sanskrit term, the correct term is prajiiii, as our text here will amply demonstrate. If we use English, the term 'partner' will serve. The term sakti is not used in Buddhist tantras. 1 Elaboration of this theme is not here necessary, for this has been the whole subject of this introduction. The yogin as Means ( upiiya) is absorbed into Wisdom(prajiiii), and the Great Bliss (mahiisukha) is achieved. While on the one hand we should recognize in all fairness the essential purity in intention of any ritual rightly performed, in that it consists in an identifying of sa1J1siira with nirviit.za, in a transmuting of a lower form into a higher, of that which is imperfect into that which is perfect, we must on the other hand be aware of the opposite effect that results, namely the identifying of nirviit.za in sa1J1siira. While the first is essentially blameless, the second is clearly liable to either proper or improper use. Its use is proper only when the intention is right. To produce a mat.z¢ala with its various parts, to envisage it as a representation of existence as it appears to be, and then to identify it in a higher principle, is a satisfactory proceeding perhaps, so long as one continues to embody that higher principle. One could then say convincingly: 'OJYl HERUKA-svabhiiviitmako 'HAM'. As a means towards this stage one had provisionally identified that which was imperfect with that which is perfect, and this was justified in so far as perfection was achieved. But it ceases altogether to be justified when this ideal is no longer realized, or in the case of its non-realizability. It is with this measure that one may in fairness attempt to estimate the value of the later Buddhist developments. There was nothing new in the theory that in order to restore that which was imperfect ( = dul;kha) into that which was perfect, that which was 1 It occurs nowhere in the Hevajra-tantra.

A docetic theory of Sak.yamuni Buddha, which involves precisely this idea, is present in the Lalitavistara, and finds still fuller development in the Saddharmapu?JrJarika. It' was this same idea that transformed the significance of the stupa, so that from being a reliquary to which honour was due, it became a symbol of the dharmakaya from which power might be derived. This same change affects the stone figures. The quasi-historical representations of Gandhara sculpture become the stereotyped and idealized buddhas of later Buddhist times. The intention of the onlooker changes from that of devotion to an historical person, and becomes one of desire for self-identification with a transcendent ideal. It is , this change which is the very essence of the mahayana, and in it are involved all future developments. What is new in the tantras is the manner in which they draw certain conclusions from those premisses, conclusions that could logically be drawn, but nevertheless involved a certain contradiction with the original intention. Their whole theory of symbols is based on this same idea of perfection existing in an imperfect form, by means of which one gains the otherwise · unattainable perfection. But they advance from this position in that, instead of symbols, they adopt ritual acts, where previously a symbol would have served. Now the act, rightly performed, may well be more effective than a mere idea represented by the symbol, but there is clearly the danger of the act becoming detached from its intended significance or of its use by those who are unable to comprehend that significance. For these may still claim in accordance with basic theory that sa1J1Sara is identical with nirva?Ja. It is here that one sees the fallacy of the whole theory of identification, already referred to above (p. 29). It may be all very well to say that sa1Jlsara is nirva?Ja if one remains in nirva?Ja ( = mystic realization), but the theory, to say the least, lends itself to considerable misunderstanding, if one remains in fa1J1sara ( = normal phenomenal existence) and still maintains that all is nirva?Ja. From this misunderstanding arises the notion that those who have once experienced the 'Great Bliss' can do as they please, that whatever their acts, they themselves are free from their consequences, for they are beyond the notions of what is suitable and unsuitable, what is right and wrong. This same desire to see nirva?Ja as sa1J1sara in every possible manner had yet another effect, which certainly strengthened the claim of Buddhism to be a universal religion, and not merely a special technique for 'those of keen senses'. In this respect it is difficult to regard the tantras as issuing in a degeneracy. Their elaboration of the use of symbol provides those external forms which are essential to the existence of a religion that is to enter into the life of a people and form the backbone of its culture.

It is of this whole setting that the tantras form part. It is this which they have strangely helped to enrich. Those same texts that may well distress us with the barbarity of their language and the crudity of their expression, were for them sacred symbols, for the Tantra of Hevajra is the verbal expression of Hevajra, even as the image represents his physical form. Probably very few were concerned to know the actual meaning of the words which formed this verbal expression. It was learned and recited ritually as one of the means of consubstantiation with the divinity which it expressed, and when it is commented upon by those few who were skilled in the meaning of its parts, they themselves would conceive of it in no other way than as a means to this same self-experience. The literal interpretations, so useful to us, that they sometimes provide, are merely incidental to the main intention, and are therefore seldom plainly stated, but must more often be deduced. They wrote their commentaries neither for those who wished to eat repulsive sacraments, nor for those who desired to study critically such strange practices, but for those who wished to consume the notion of their own selfhood. This is so apparent in the manner of their writing, so completely taken for granted, that it is oneself who becomes the fool, when one sets about a literal interpretation of the text.

They merely represent an attempt to characterize the subject-matter as concisely as possible. 2 The unity of three is the unity of Body, Speech, and Mind, and with this interpreta-tion the commentators are generally in agreement. Dharmakirti, however, understands it as the unity of the three worlds, kamadhatu, rupadhatu, and arupadhatu, which is achieved in the condition of voidness-stan pa iiid du chos thams cad dbyer mi phyed pal;zo I srid pa gsum ste f:zdod khams gzugs khams gzugs med pal:zi khams gsum ston par gcig pal:zo I (xvii. 343a 4).

The Tibetan versions generally confirm our text with their: ies rab rigs pa l:zdi yis na, which, being a literal translation, does not help in clarifying the meaning. K, having quoted the text cor-rectly, then interprets as though it were: anayd prajiiayuktyd (vol. II, p. ros, 11. 6-7). Bh, however, says: 'prajiiayd yuktyd' 'that is to say, here in this application is the authority of logical inference'-ses rab rig pa zes gsuil ste /rigs pa na l:zdir rjes su dpag pal:zi tshad ma ste f (xv. 199b s). The phrase reoccurs in a similar context at I, v. 8. In both places the easiest way of satisfying demands of syntax is to translate: 'by this wise device'. prajiid can itself, however, mean 'device', and I prefer to accept it as simply a synonym in apposi-tion, as does also Bh (quoted above). 47"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"I.

Then fill the pot with milk from a black cow and wrap it in a woven cloth that has been cut by a dark-'skinned girl. Then in the north-west make a small pool, and place the snake in it. At its edge lay out the matzfjala. Black colouring is obtained from charcoal of the cemetery, white from ground human bones, yellow from green lac, red from cemetery-bricks, green from caurya leaves and ground human bones, and dark blue from ground human bones and cemetery charcoal. With these colours lay out the matzl/ala, measuring it with a cemetery thread5 three cubits, three inches in size.

' (22) The ritual of the vajra-knife: I tell of the chalk-ritual for destroying an enemy army. Having pounded the chalk, mix it with the five ambrosias and kuthiirachinna4 and make a small ball. The mantra is: 0¥ vajra-knife-o Hevajra HU¥ HU¥ HU¥ PHAT. For the gaining of siddhi he should recite it ten million times, and for the above-mentioned practice a hundred thousand times. He should then wrap round the neck of the jar upon which the ritual is being practised, and having wrapped it round, he should break it off. All the enemies will become headless. s 1 The whole of this mantra is translatable, although of course at the expense of the sonorous effect, whence their power was derived: ghur = roar, ghurj = defend, ghat = strive, ghut = strike. 2 S asserts that the heads of the niigas will burst (xv. 145b 7)-not that of the officiant in the event of his failure! V implies so (xv. 36b 6). Ch clearly states so: 'Then if it does not rain, it will cause the heads of those niiga-kings to burst into seven pieces like a bunch of arjaka' (589a 27). 'Arjaka' is explained by K (p. III, l. 20) and by Bh (xv. 209a 7) as 'bread-fruit' (panasa). According to V. it is like black mallikii, has a white stalk, and bursts at the light of the sun-ardzaka zes pa dbyug pa dkar po can mallika nag po l.zdra baste-iii mal.zi l.zod kyis l.zgas pa (xv. 36b 6).

When the rain becomes excessive, he says, place the snake in a pot which has been filled with ashes from the cemetery, and seated on a shroud, &c.-gail gi tshe char ches par gyur na del.zi tshe mthal.z yas de dur khrod kyi thal bas kha1Jt phor bkan bar biag par bya ste / snags pas dur khrod kyi ras la fie bar l.zdug nas, &c. (xv. 37a 2). The invocation itself seems to be clearly addressed to Siva. 4 Tibetan versions either transliterate kuthiirachinna or translate without comment as stares gcod pa 'cut with an axe'. Ch glosses with ts' ao 'grass' (589c 3). The sense of the term remains uncertain; perhaps the flesh of someone slain by an axe (cf. sastrahata, I. vii. 21). 5 This 'knife' ritual is confusedly explained.

Trampling it beneath the feet he should recite the mantra: Ol'rf vajra-axe-cleave cleave HU!yl HU¥ HU¥ PHAT SVAHA. Reciting it ten million times, he should make homage to the tilaka, and the one to whom it clings will burst. 4 (24) The burning ritual: One should write the name of an enemy on an arka-leaf with the juice of poisonous mustard and burning citraka, and throwing it in a fire chaff, recite this mantra ten thousand times: Ol'rf Hevajra-burn burn this enemy BHRUl'rf HUl'rf HU¥ H0¥ PHAT SVAHA.

One imagines the syllable MA¥ becoming a belly full of wine. He is seen as vomiting, and he vomits the wine. S. Two uses of this mantra are given, firstly for converting living beings who are hard to convert. For this ten million recitations are required accompanied by a million offerings (xv. 37a 3-4). Secondly it is used for this enemy-destroying rite, when a hundred thousands suffice. S's account of this follows: Grind the chalk together with the five nectars and with kuthdrachinna make it into a pellet the size of an eye. Then place it in Heruka's mouth and recite the mantra until the image ejects it from its mouth and gives it back to the officiant; if in one session he makes a hundred thousand recitations, the rite will succeed. If he then makes a mark with the chalk on the neck of a spherical vessel, that very thing will appear on the necks of the victim and his followers.

(ii) One should mentally produce yellow Gauri, who is of a saffron-reddish colour and holds a noose and a hook. Then meditating upon the syllable Al'yt of colour like unto a bandhiika-f!ower (as situated) in your own heart, one should worship her as prescribed, repeating the mantra: Ol'yt A1'yi SVAHA. Then you should imagine the woman who is to be subdued, in front of you, red in colour, naked and with dishevelled hair, and with the syllable Al'yt at her pudenda. If it is a man, it will be at his heart. The syllable Al'yt is like fire and one must imagine it blazing. Then repeating the mantra: Ol'yt Al'yt GAURI Lead her into my power Al'yt svli.Hli., one must imagine her bound with the noose round the neck and pierced at the heart with the hook, and drawn near, and thrown at your feet. Then she will be certainly subdued. (iii) One should mentally produce Viiriyogini, who becoming manifest from the syllable 1, is dark blue in colour, holds a mirror and is pointing. Then one must imagine the syllable KHAl'yi on a solar disk at the heart, and worship her as prescribed, repeating the mantra: Ol'yt KHAl'yi SVAHA. Then one must imagine the fellow against whom the rite is to be prac-tised, as naked and with dishevelled hair, dark blue in colour and mounted on a wild boar. He is facing right and in the act of fleeing while being beaten with the cruel blows of clubs. For a week one must repeat the mantra: Ol'yt KHAl'yi VARIYOGIN! Chase away this fellow KHAl'yi HUl'yi HUl'yi HUl'yi PHAT, and he will certainly be chased away.

One should worship her as prescribed, repeating the mantra: O¥ JRil'yi svli.Hli. one hundred thousand times. Then one must imagine the two against whom the rite is to be practised, as mounted on a horse and a buffalo and as fighting together.

In the six corners one must inscribe the syllable HUl'yi and in the centre Ol'yt BUl'yi Burn him HUJ'yi. For any intended misfortunes one should write his name and burn it in a chaff-fire (passage corrupt). In fierce rites one should always end the mantra with: HUl'yi HUl'yi HUl'yi PHAT.

One draws forth from one's heart a red ray of light, which one must cause to enter the victim by way of the right nostril, and having pierced her heart, one must extract the ray by way of the left nostril. Then drawing it with the breath into one's own heart, one recites the mantra. She will certainly be drawn to one's presence.

Then having performed worship as before, one should imagine a burning vajra, which becomes manifest from the syllable GHUI;I and is entering the rear of the victim who is face-downwards.

(2) Then again: first the realization of the void, secondly the seed in which all is concentrated, thirdly the physical manifestation, and fourthly one should implant the syllable.2 1 'First' in the sense of first of this set of four, for 'first of all, having settled in a pleasant place and adopted a comfortable posture, one should pronounce three times : myr RAK~A RAK~A HU¥ HU!\\'1 HU!\\'1 PHAT SVAHA in order to protect the site, oneself, and the performance. Then one should worship Bhagaviin whose form should be present on a picture or some other representation, with one's own mantra, and having intoned the dedication, one should make a confession of wrong done, an act of gladness at merit gained, and perform the triple-refuge. Then having produced the thought of enlightenment, after that one should first practise the meditation of love' (K: p. II3, 11. 14-19). These preliminaries are given in a similar form by most of the other commentators. Bh adds: 'after the taking of the triple-refuge, one should make an offering of oneself, which will be mentioned below (see I, vi. 19); having made a gift of one's own self, one should make the vow which is the thought of enlightenment: 'May I, having become Heruka, make all beings without exception into Heruka too.' This also is mentioned later: 'Heruka is a transformation of sa1Jlstira, the foremost of the saviours of the world' ; then again later: 'I will save the world'-gsum la skyabs su J:uiro bal:zi rjes Za bdag iiid dbul bar byal:zo 1 zes pal:zo 1 de iiid kyaiz l;zchad par l:zgyur te I Ius kyi sbyin pa byin nas su I zes pal:zo I de nas smon pa bymi chub kyi sems bskyed par bya ste I bdag iiid dpal Herukar gyur nas l:zgro ba ma !us pa rnams kyan dpal Herukar byal;zo I zes pal;zo I de iiid kyan l;zchad par l:zgyur te I l;zkhor bal;zi rnam pa Heruka I l;zgro ba sgrol bal;zi gtso bo iiid ces pal;zo I des na bdag gis l;zgro ba sgrol bar byal;zo f zes pa dan-(xv. 210a 2-4). . I have quoted here at some length in order to show how the intention of the ritual that follows, remains that of the traditional bodhisattva. The intention is the same; the tech-nique has changed or developed. 'Thought of enlightenment' remains in its traditional sense. The four brahma-vihtira are very old property of Indian Yoga and probably belong to the earliest Buddhist practice (Fr. Heiler, Buddhistische Versenkung, p. 47 and notes 294 and 295). They lose nothing of their moral force in their present setting. See K: p. II3, I. 19; or N, who emphasizes still more their benevolent character: 'Love is the directing of the thoughts, so that one's relatives and friends, the meanest of them, one's enemies and those who are strangers shall gain happiness and those things that are good for them; compassion is the will to extricate all beings, even at the cost of one's own life, from suffering and the cause of suffering; joy is rejoicing at that which is of benefit to others; impassibility is indifference to the harm caused one by others' -giien bses tha mal pa dan dgra bo rnams !a pha rol po !a dan bde ba fie bar sgrub par sems pa ni byams pal;zo I giiis pa siiin rje zes pa !a sdug bsnal dan I sdug bsnal gyi rgyu las sems can rnams thams cad ran gi !us dan srog gis kyan l;zdon par l;uiod pa ni siiin rjel;zo I ... gzan la phan pa !a rails pa ni dgal;z bal;zo I ... gzan gyi skyon !a btan siioms pa ni kun gyi !hag mar btan siioms so zes pal;zo (xvii. 92a 7-b 2). One should note, however, that this whole process is a :tr:J.editative exercise, forming part of the yogin's own purificatory ritual, and subjective in its application. R gives the reasons for its use: 'for the purpose of rendering firm the thought of enlighten-ment and all the other roots of virtue, in order to allow no occasion for harmful thoughts or tormentings and in order to protect oneself from the sufferings of an evil future, from Mara and from the Hinayiina; they are the first branch (of training) for yogins and are common to all yo gins' -by an chub kyi sems !a sogs pal;zi dge bal;zi rtsa ba thams cad brtan par bya bal;zi don dan I gnod sems dan rnam par l;ztshe ba la sogs pal;zi skabs mi dbye bal;zi phyir dan I nan l;zgrol;zi sdug bsnal dan bdud dan theg pa dman pa las bdag iiid bsrun bal;zi don du l;zdi [du] dag ni rnal l;zbyor pa rnams kyi dan pol;zi yan lag te rnal l:zbyor pa thams cad kyi thun moil no (xvii. 268b 4-5). 2 This set of four form the body of primary yoga, and are called the fourfold vajra-rnall;zbyor dan pol:zi Ius ni rdo rje bZi ste (R: xvii. 268b 5).

As produced from this vajra one should imagine a balustrade and canopy.1 (4-) (Then within the balustrade) one should first imagine a corpse which represents the whole of existence, and the yogin, seated thereupon, should conceive himself of the nature of Heruka (5). In his own heart he imagines the syllable RAI\\1 and a solar disk arising from it, and then upon that the syllable HUI\\1, the nature of which is Wisdom and Means. (6) It is dark in colour and exceedingly fearful this syllable HUI\\1 which has emerged from a vajra, and one should conceive of the essence of this HUI\\1 as abiding in the heart of the vajra. (7) Then he should envisage the syllable HU¥ as transformed into (Heruka) whose nature is wrath. This Vajra-Born is sloka: prathama1J! siinyatiibodhi1J!, &c. appears in almost identical form, and is referred to as the vajracatu$ka. As for the interpretation of these four stages, the commentaries are in complete agreement on the meaning of the first three. A variation of interpretation for the fourth is given by Bh and Kz, both, however, fanciful and without direct relevance to the preceding three. We follow K' s commentary: 'What is this realization of the Void, you ask. As all things have the mind for their support, everything is just thought, and with external things thus non-existent, it reflects sense-objects through error. It is like a dream, they say. Furthermore, as mind consists of this reflective quality, its nature is neither one nor many. It should be conceived of as free from false appearances and as consisting of pure brilliance. Now in that brilliance one duly envisages upon a solar disk and so on the divine seed encircled with rays; from that seed by the endless creation of the families of the yoginis the cause of the world is prospered, so in that seed it is concentrated. By means of that seed there comes about the physical manifestation of the god in the semi-paryanka position or in a dancing posture, mounted upon a corpse upon a solar disk which rests upon the pericarp of a many-petalled lotus. This is the physical manifestation. Fourthly the implanting of the syllable. In one's own heart one should imagine the seed-syllable set on a ma1J¢ala.' (K: p. r 13, ll. rr4ff). R says exactly the same in substance. For the second stage he says: 'from that seed Vajrii, Gauri, and their companions pour forth endlessly, and because they are concentrated in that seed, it is called seed-concentration and that one should meditate upon' (xvii. i69a 3); and for the fourth: 'in one's heart one should imagine a solar disk, and upon that is placed the syllable of the seed. One should concentrate upon one's own thought as perfected in the nature of that thought which is expressed in the form of one's own divinity who arises from the syllable of that seed resting on the solar disk in the heart'-ran gi siiin gar iii malti dkyil /;tkhor dmigs te I del;ti sten du sa bon gyi yi ge bkod la I siiin ga/;ti iii ma la gnas pa/;ti sa bon gyi yi ge las ran gi lha/;ti rnam pa/;ti sems kyi ran bZin gyis rdzogs pa ran gi sems bsgom par bya (xvii. 269a 4-5). The four stages are clear: first the concept of the void, then the seed, then the whole phenomenal process, idealized in the circle of divinities, and lastly this whole process envisaged with-in one's own heart, so that oneself becomes the centre and is consubstantiated with the whole. As for the grammatical structure of this last phrase, nyiisam may be interpreted as nyasyet. There are other examples of the verbal noun with dependent accusative. See I. vi. 4· Tib has dgod, a future root, and this usually represents a Sanskrit optative. ' For a fuller account of these preliminary protective arrangements see K (p. 114, 11. 8-rz).

See I-T iii, part 2, frontispiece. 2 The process here described is again 'the Body of Yoga' (yogaiarira ), which we discussed above in the note on pp. 56-7. In this second case, however, there is a fivefold distinction, each of the five stages being equated with one of the five wisdoms. Thus R (xvii. 27ob Iff.), D (xvii. 254b 6 ff.) and K (p. I 14, 11. 32 ff.) all interpret. K quotes the text I. viii. 6-7 q.v. The only difficulty consists in candriilikiilimarttm;zr/a. There are listed two pairs of synonyms, iililkiili and sunlmoon(see Introduction, pp. 26-7), the masculine element of one pair united with the feminine of the other: moon (m) and ali (f), kiili (m), and sun (f). The context requires no other significance in the repetition than that achieved in any other language by similar use of repetition, and the efforts of the commentators, K amongst them, to explain moon as a transformation of iili, and kiili as transformed into sun, are ·really superfluous. Compare however I. viii. s~6. Sattva is defined as Vajrasattva by S (xv. I48 5) and as Vajradhara by K. He is the supreme being under any of his names, and both commentators go on to define svadehiibhii as shining manifestations (K: iibhal;z, S: l;lod zer-light rays) like Hevajra in form. Of the process whereby manifestations of this kind fill all the points of the compass we have already spoken (see Introduction, p. 33). 3 'Eyes red and extended like a bandu, such are red bandu-eyes; eyes round, red and extended, this is the meaning'-bandu !tar rgyas Sin dmar bal;li spyan ni bandu dmar pol;zi spyan de fiid de I zlum zin dmar la rgyas pal;zi spyan zes pal;zi don to (xv. 2I4b 4-s).

Then it refers to activity outside these set times and meditations with the words \"being consubstantiated with the divinity\" ; this means the assurance of unity of enjoyment in the divine form with regard to all spheres of activity through possession of divine self-confidence in the acts of sitting, sleeping, eating and all the rest' -thun gsum du byin gyis brlabs pal:zi sgom pa rnam par bsgoms nas laizs te zes bya ba [a thun gsum du ste I byin gyis brlabs pa ni lha rnams su rnam par dgod pal.zo I de rnams kyi sgom pa ni goms pal:zo I del:zi sgom pa ni cho gal:zo I laizs pa ni rna! l:zbyor gyis gnas pal:zo 1 thun dan bsgom pal:zi phyi rot gyi bya ba gsum pa llha/:zi zes bya ba la sogs pa La 1 lhal:zi gzugs ni l:zdug pa dan I za ba dan I fial ba la sogs pa rnams su lha/:zi iza rgyal gyis yul rnams la lhal:zi gzugs su fie bar loizs spyod pal:zi rnal l:zbyor gyi izes pa fiid do zes dgoizs so I (xv. 217a 5-'J). · 5 For a translation of K's commentary on these verses see the Introduction, pp. 2o-2r. 6 The text actually has Vajri, but see iloka 6 below.

(u) There is neither meditator, nor whatso'er to meditate; there is neither god nor mantra. It is as (aspects of) the undifferentiated unity that god and mantra have their existence. (12) This unity is known as Vairocana, Ak~obhya, Amogha, Ratna, Arolika, 4 and Satvika, as Brahma, Vi~r:tu, Siva, Sarva, Vibuddha, and Tattva.5 1 These lines are interpreted differently by K: 'They (the senses that these goddesses symbolize) must be used with extreme care, so that no distinction, that is to say, so that no threefold dependence of sound, ear, hearing-consciousness, &c. shall come about' (p. I I7, ll. I6-I8). This seems scarcely the primary meaning, as the threats that follow the non-observance would not be suitable in this case. K shows his consciousness of this by inserting saq!Slirikair dul;lkhail;. 2 Interesting are the names given by K to the six buddhas: Citta (A~obhya), Saivata (Vairocana), Ratneia (Ratnasambhava), Vagiia (Amitabha), Amogha (Amoghasiddhi), and Satvika (Vajrasattva). They become five by the omission of Vajrasattva, and three by the absorption of Amoghasiddhi into Vairocana, and Ratnasambhava into Amitiibha. This leaves Ak~obhya (citta), Amitiibha (vag), and Vairocana (kaya) (Td xvi. 128a). This order of elimination corresponds with the historical seniority of the group. Vajrasattva was the last-comer; Amoghasiddhi and Ratnasambhava are less substantial figures than the three first great ones who still hold their sway in China, Japan, and Tibet. Hevajra as was mentioned above (p. 6o, fn. 3), is a manifestation of Ak~obhya, to whose family our whole tantra belongs.

R says that a matzifala may be briefly described as the pattern of a footprint which is made with dust and mud and water (xvii. 226b 2)-rkan pas bris pa zes pa ni rdul dan l;zdam dan chu la sags pa la rkan rjes kyi ri mo ni dkyil l;zkhor zes pa sin tu mdor sdud pal;zo / But see following note. 2 S says cintana is ordinary thought, that vicintana refers to thought in terms of its absolute nature, and that this is dhyana-sems par byed pas bsams pa ste / de kho na fiid kyi tshul du rnam par sems par byed paste/ de iiid bsam gtan no/ (xv. 152b 7). These four,japa, matzifala, mudra, and dhyana are the substance of the yogin's technique for the gaining of that intuitive and indefinable realization which is his goal. As methods they have only a conventional (sa1!!vrti) value, and their real existence is submerged in the final undifferentiated unity, which is the chief theme of this chapter. But there is another aspect of these four techniques which the commentators have missed; namely that for the perfected yogin (siddha), for whom all things are possible and for whom all things are in all, all speech is mantra, even a footprint is a matzifala, any gesture is a mudrii, and all thought is dhyiina. This interpretation is supported by I. vii. 26: 'Whatever movement of the limbs, whatever words flow forth, these are mantra and mudrii for him who occupies the place of Sri-Heruka', 3 The Father is Vajradhara (K: p. u8, 1. 36). 4 Death is release; it is death because it is the end of those marks of ignorance which are mind and the product of mind (K: p. II9, 11. 4-5). See Introduction, p. 38. 5 These are the five families referred to above, as represented by Narti and the rest. 6 According to S, the dwelling of V ai~l}.avi and so on-khyab l;zjug ma la sags pal;zi ma mol;zi gnas (xv.

(8-9) Take a girl of the Vajra-family, fair-featured and large-eyed and endowed with youth and beauty, who has been consecrated by oneself2 and is possessed of a compassionate disposition, and with her the practice should be performed. In the absence of one from the Vajra-family, it should be performed with a girl from the family of one's special divinity, or (if this fails) from some other. Take her then who is now consecrated with the depositing of the seed of enlightenment. (I o) If in joy songs are sung, then let them be the excellent Vajra-songs, 3 and if one dances when joy has arisen, let it be done with release as its object. Then the yogin, self-collected, performs the dance in the place of Hevajra.4 (I I) Ak~obhya is symbolized by the circlet, Amitabha by the ear-rings, Ratnesa by the necklace, and Vairocana (by the rings) upon the wrists. ( 12) Amogha is symbolized by the girdle, Wisdom by the khatviinga and Means by the drum, while the yogin represents the Wrathful One himself. (I3) Song symbolizes mantra, dance symbolizes meditation, and so singing and dancing the yogin always acts. ( I4) He should always eat herbs and drink water, then old age and death will not harm him and he will always be protected. (r5) Now he, whose nature is HO¥ (viz. Hevajra), should arrange his 1 'Heat' -generally interpreted as power(prabhiiva-mthu or nus pa ), gained from medita-tion and incantation. So K (p. II9, 1. 27), S (xv. I54b I), Bh (xv. 227a 7) and R (xvii. 278a 3). According to V it is a first stage, presumably of trance, associated with the appearance of things as smoke and as mirage-gal te spyod pa byed l:zdod pa I yan lag drug sbyor gaiz yin te I du ba smig rgyu la sags pal:zi I drod iii daiz par bskyed par bya I (quoted from the Miilatantra xv. s6b 6). In this respect see Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, p. I95· It is also possible that the use of this term is to be associated with the first of the four states leading to Enlightenment: u~magata, miirdha, k~iinti, and laukikiigradharma, which are known from Yogiiciira works. For references see Obermiller; Analysis of the Abhisa-mayiila1{1kiira, fasc. I, p. sS. z 'Consecrated by oneself'. According to Bh she is to be given instruction about all her own dharmas-raiz iiid kyi chos thams cad kyi man izag de la sbyin Ia byal:zo--or as she is of the same nature as the yogin, he embraces her and she becomes the recipient of that con-secration that is purificatory in its effect-sgrub pa pol:zi ran gi bdag iiid du gyur bas l:zkhyud ciiz dbaiz bskur bani khrus byed pa daiz !dan pal;w (xv. 227b 5).

So also Bh, who adds that the yogin should not have a liking for the dances of simple people, the fixed intention of which is to captivate and so on, for his dancing has release as its object:.___:so sol:zi skye bol:zi gar rnams ni gzuiz ba la sags pal;i milan par zen pa de rnams rna! l:zbyor' pas ni de Ia milan zen pa med pa ste I de bas na gar gyi bya bani thar pal:zi rgyur gyur pa yin no (xv. 228a 7-b I). 4 Vajrapada is elaborated by K and other commentators to refer to the various postures associated with Hevajra, and which the yogin, now identified with him, may be said to assume."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE PERFORMANCE I. vi piled-up hair1 as a crest and for the performance of the yoga he should wear the skull-tiara, representing the five buddhas.2 (16) Making pieces of skull five inches long, he should secure them to the crest. He should wear the two-stranded cord of hair, that symbolizes Wisdom and Means, the ashes and the sacred thread of hair; (17) the sound of the drum is his invocation, and the khatviiilga of Wisdom is his meditation. 3 It is this that is intoned and meditated in the practice of Vajra and Skull. b.

(2o-21) Enjoying food and drink he should take it as it comes, making no distinction between that which is liked or disliked, eatable or uneatable, drinkable or undrinkable.

Released from all the conventions of meditation, s the yogin performs the practice. 1 This is certainly the intended meaning (i.e. cautf.akesa) and is thus interpreted by K. Nevertheless the only reading both in manuscripts and in the Tibetan versions is caurya, of which no one gives an intelligible account. V says it is a coronet made into a symbol from grass-rkun ma/;!i skra ces bya ba/;!i rtsa las cod pan du brda/;! bya ba (xv. s8a 1). 2 Concerning these tiaras, see J-T iii. I, pp. 79-80, although there is here no reference to their being made of skull. 3 According to V, the double-stranded girdle of human hair is for subduing the self-confident gods of this world (laukikadevatii); his body is smeared with ashes because of the vow of Siva; the Brahmanic thread of human hair is for the sake of the Brahmanic vow; he holds the drum because of the acme of divine joy; he holds the khatviinga because it is the sign of victory (dhvaja) of Siva, and with the skull-pieces he holds the vajra-skull because of the vow-/;!jig rten pa/;!i lha iza rgyal can rnams gdul bar bya ba/;!i don du / mi ro/;!i skra/;!i ske rags giiis bskor dan 1 dban phyug chen pol;ti brtul zugs kyi ched du that bas lus la byugs pa dan I tshans paJ:Ii brtul zugs kyi ched du mi rol;ti skra/;!i tshan skud dan I lha rnams kyi dgal;t bal;ti rtse mol;ti ched du can te/;!u gzuiz ba dan I dbaiz phyug chen pol;ti rgyal mtshan gyi ched du ken rus gzun ba dan I thad pal;ti dum bus brtul zugs kyi ched du rdo rjel;ti thod pa bzun bar bya ba ste I (xv. sSa 4-5).

(26) For the good of all beings, his drink is always compassion, for the yogin who delights in the drink of yoga, becomes drunk with no other drink. CHAPTER Vll. SECRET SIGNS a. (x) Now we shall expound the chapter on secret signs,X by which the (right) yogin and yogini may be recognized with certainty. (2) Whoever shows one finger, implies: Am I welcome?2 1 Secret signs-chomii (tib.: brda-sign), glossed by K as milicchii (tib.: kla klo gyi skad -barbarian language). These terms serve .but to emphasize the non-brahrnanical origin of these practices. According to V: 'Thes.e signs are to be known as being of two kinds, even as it is said in the Mulatantra: The practiser of Heruka-yoga learns the bodily signs and the verbal signs, for if he does not express himself with these bodily and verbal signs, he will come to grief even though he be a buddha. (Compare II. v. 65-67, where this warning is given after the list of verbal signs.) So the yogins and yoginis who practise the Hevajra-yoga must make effort to remember these signs of body and speech, so that in the company of malicious outsiders and male and female messengers from other families (other than the V ajrakula) one need not converse in the terms of ordinary speech, but we shall speak of the great mystery by means of signs and these malicious outsiders and wanderers will be bewildered. In this chapter only bodily signs are explained, and the verbal signs in another (seep. 99)'. brda!J ni mam pa gfiis su go ba bya ste I de ymi ji skad du I rtsal;ti rgyud las Heruka ldan rnal !Jbyor gyis I lus dan nag gi brdalJ la bslab I lus nag brdab yis mi smra na I sans rgyas kyan ni nes par !Jjig I ces gsuns te I de bas na de!Ji phyir I Kye!Ji rDorjebi rnal bbyor la gnas pa!Ji rnal bbyor pa dan rnal bbyor ma rnams kyi(s) Ius nag gi brdalJi man nag bbad pas yid la gzun ste I phyi rol gyi skye bo mi srun pa rnams dan rigs gzan gyi pho fia dan pho iia ma rnams tshogs pabi nan du tha mal pabi tha sfiad kyis brjod par mi bya!Ji I bdag cag rnams kyis gsmi chen gail yin pa de brdas brjod pa na skye bo ma runs pa dan phyi rol gyi pho fia dan pho fia ma rnams rmons par bgyur ro I ... Zebu bdir ni Ius kyi brda bbab zig ston la nag gi brda ni Zebu gzan nas ston par bgyurro I (xv. 59b 3-7). Bh adds to this information by telling us that : Practising yogins who wander about among the Pitha and k~etra (see below) looking for proficient yoginis, should give these signs so that they may know which among the yoginis are in possession of the necessary tenets which accord with their own, and so that they may arouse in these a condition of mutual responsiveness-Do ni spyod pal;ti rnal bbyor pa rnams kyi(s) bgrub pabi rnal bbyor ma rnams blta baf:zi don du I gnas dan zin la sogs pa rnams su bgrod cin I de rnams las mnon par !Jdod pabi grub pa!Ji mthab bdag dan bbrel ba [las] rtogs pabi phyir dan I de rnams dan bdag mfiam zifl l;zdra bar bskyed pal;zi don dude dag brda ster bar rigs SO (XV. 231b 4-5). z K, V, and D attempt a detailed interpretation of these signs, but there is absence of agreement. K does not even trouble to preserve the questions and answers which are essential to their nature and interprets as though it were an account of the granting of initiations by master to pupil. I quote V's account as being the best of the three, but it is probably as arbitrary as the others: Now 'whoever shows one finger', that is to say, if any man or woman suddenly appears before one and shows one finger, it is to be understood as meaning: 'Am I welcome?' Likewise, 'by two you are welcome', means that by stretch-.. ing forth two fingers in reply, such a one is welcome. Further, 'by pressure from the left thumb one should know the sign for well-being', that is to say, you should know the sign for asking someone about his well-being: 'Are you happy in body, speech and mind?' 'Whoever shows the fourth finger'-this is the part of Upiiya (the yogin), 'to him one should present the little finger'-this is the part of Prajfiii (the yogini), and by this one should know Air and Fire as distinguished above and below. 'Whoever shows the middle finger, to him one should present the second finger', and by this likewise one should know Water and Earth with the distinction of above and below. So these are signs of Void and Compassion, conceived as external and internal. Thus 66"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"SECRET SIGNS I. vii The showing of two implies he is welcome. The sign of well-being may be known from pressure with the left thumb. (3) If he presents the fourth finger, he should be shown the little finger. If he presents the middle finger, he should be showp. the second finger. (4) If he shows the fourth finger, one should indicate to him the neck. If he shows a painting, one should show him a trident. (5) If he indicates the breasts, one should indicate the parting of the hair. If he indicates the earth, one should indicate the mouth. (6) If he indicates the eyebrow, one should indicate the loosening of one's crest of hair. If he indicates the forehead, one should indicate the back. (7) If he indicates the sole of the foot, one should dance with joy. in the A.dibuddhatantra it is said: 'To east and west are Earth and Air, which mutually are Means and Wisdom; to south and north are Fire and Water, which mutually are Means and Wisdom.' 'Whoever shows the fourth finger, to him one should indicate the neck', and this asks the question: 'Do you know the truth (dharma) which is like the expanse of the sky?', and in reply one indicates the neck, for the circle of the throat is the place where are tasted the six savours, and by means of these the veins develop, and so by this one indicates the truth that is like the sky. 'Whoever shows the canvas, to him one should show the trident'-to the question: 'Do you know the characteristics of the guardian divinity?', there is the answer: 'Yes, I ]mow; I know the essence of the three veins which have the nature of Body, Speech, and Mind.' 'Whoever indicates the breasts, to him one should indicate the parting', which means : 'If we obtained a treatise on dancing, would you know it?', to which there is the answer: 'I know it, and I know the bliss that arises from the action of the two indriyas.' 'Whoever points to the earth, to him one should indicate the mouth', and this implies the question: 'Do you know the essence of Wisdom ?', to which is the answer: 'Yes I know it; it is possessed of Wisdom and Means.' 'Whoever shows the eyebrow, to him one should indicate the loosening of one's crest of hair', and this means: 'Very well, you and I shall perform the parts of Means and Wisdom', to which there is the reply: 'There is no fear, we shall so perform.' 'Whoever shows the forehead, to him one should show the back', which means: 'Do you know that place of the l)iikinis, the foremost one of the body, which is in the head?', and to this there is the answer: 'Yes, I know it; but apart from the head, there are places of the l)iikinis in the rest of the body as well, in the back and so on.' (These places will be mentioned below.) 'Whoever shows the sole of the foot (in reply) one dances with joy.' This asks the ques-tion: 'How shall we go to those places?', to which there is the reply: 'First the treatise on dancing, and then by entering into complete tranquillity with one's mind possessed of attachment, in this way we will go to those places.' This translation is literal, but in spite of a certain obscurity, most of which will become clear below, it provides a satisfactory interpretation of these signs, marking clearly the stages from the first meeting to the decision to unite in the ritual. My translation presumes that the yogin poses the question in every case. This is clearly stated to be so by V in the case of the third question, and implied generally by the fact that it is the yogin who is looking for a suitable yogini, and not the reverse. Nevertheless MS. A in several cases implies otherwise by reading tasytil;t instead of tasya, 'to her' instead of 'to him'. (The Tibetan versions have everywhere de yi, which could mean either.) But since no com-mentary provides an interpretation that takes this distinction into account, and since Bh and K read tasya in all cases, I have adhered to this reading.

As for chandoha and pilava, I have no ready translation. The Tibetan transliterates the former and translates the latter as l;thun-gcod 'drink and cut' as though pilava were derived from pi 'drink' and lava 'cutting'). See The Blue Annals, * kyis makes the phrase unintelligible unless there is a pronoun missing before it, perhaps khyod kyis. t rtsod with secondary root brtsad normally means 'to contend'.

It is rare indeed that the Tibetans err in this manner. D gives an attempted explana-tion of these terms : ' It is called 'seat' because one always stays there and performs the practice, also because the yogins stay there. Because it is near to that place, it is called 'near-by seat' (upapifha). It is called 'field', because it produces good qualities, also because the mother-goddesses stay there.

It is called pilava, because there are no obstructions. It is called 'near-by pilava' because it is near to there.

But it is from the bhiimis, not from the Pithas, &c., that the bodhisattva gets his name of Lord of the Ten Bhiimis. I would prefer to translate: 'It is from these that the Protector is known as Lord of the Ten Bhiimis', but all the com-mentators, aware of the discrepancy between the twelve bhumis just listed, and the ten referred to in the title, separate the two names, applying the ten to the Bodhisattva, and the remainder to the Protector, the Buddha. They even add a thirteenth, the Vajra-dharabhiimi, which the ordinary Mahayiinists (pha rol tu phyin pa ba) do not reach (D: xvii. 366a 4). • According to S and D there should be thirty-two places here listed, but none of the commentators helps in arranging a satisfactory list. K (p. 122, I. 17) and R (xvii. 28oa 2-3) define the 'city' as Pataliputra, but give no other helpful information. Their explanation of tatsannive$a1!! would be meaningless without the full quotation from D, given just above. But the list is clearly unsatisfactory, since from here onwards no further names are given, except perhaps for pretasa1!lhiita, which may be intended for Pretapuri. They are not interested in these places in the world without. 'These places, Jalandhara and so on, are mentioned for the benefit of simple fools who wander about the country' (N. xvii. I I Ib 2). They are therefore interpreted as symbols for the places within the body, that is to say, they are the external equivalent of that which exists within. According to V, 'externally these are places in the world without, where dwell those goddesses who run after flesh and blood and so keep to the towns, but internally these places exist in the body in the form of veins and there is no need to look elsewhere for them'-phyi rol tu ni sa dan khrag la rgyug par byed pa gron la brten pal;zi lha mo rnams ni phyi gnas de dag na gnas pa yin la I ...

Dis aware of this, but still wishes to run them together: 'the twelve kinds of place listed above, are listed in full below as the 32 countries of Jambudvipa; internally these are associated with the 24 parts of the body and with the 32 veins' -phyi /tar bSad pa ni gon gi bcu gfiis po de l;dzam bul;i glin gi yul sum cu rtsa gfiis su l;og na rgyas par l;ched do / nan !tar bSad pa ni Ius kyi gnas iii su rtsa bzi !a sbyar ba dan rtsa sum cu rtsa gfiis su sbyar te-(xvii. 36 sb 7-366a I). In fact in our text only 24, and not 32 places in J ambudvipa are named; the other six are made up by such terms as village-boundary, ocean-shore, and so on. Elsewhere only 24 places are known. One of the verses of Saraha runs: 'I have visited in my wandering k~etra and pifha and upapifha, for I have not seen another place of pilgritnage blissful like my own body.' (K~etra, &c. are here intended figuratively as our own commentators would under-stand them.) Advayavajra in his commentary says: 'All these k~etra and upak~etras, &c. are the 24 localities' (Bagchi, Dohiiko~a, p. n3). But most important of all for this whole subject see Tucci, I-Tiii. 2, pp. 38-45. He there quotes the complete list of 24 places with the 24 equivalent parts of the body. These latter correspond with the list quoted by Nat xvii. II2a I (except for one omission). V's list(xv. 6Ib 5) is more disordered but is basically the same. As for the place-names I9 of ours correspond with Tucci's list. The Hevajra-tantra presents us with an unsystematized attempt to allocate 24 places to the 12 kinds of place of pilgrimage, and the carelessness with which it is done enables the commentators to assume that there are 32 places on the analogy of the 32 veins. Nevertheless they remain aware of the relationship between the external places and the 24 places in the body and ignore the resulting contradiction. · Of the places listed in the Hevajra-tantra the I9 corresponding with those in I-T are: Jalandhara, OQ.Q.iyana, Paurt;~agiri ( = Pullira Malaya), Kamarilpa, Malava, Sindhu, · Nagara, Devikota, Kulata, Arbuda, Himadri, Lampaka, Kaficika, Saura~tra, Kalinga, the Isle of Gold, Kosala, Godavari and possibly Pretasarp.hata (for Pretapuri). Those that remain are Munmuni, Karmarapataka, Karut;~yapataka, Harikela, Kokat;~a, Caritra, and Vindhyakaumarapaurika (if this last is not an epithet). This produces twenty-six names, but of these pretasa'!lhiita figures in the text not as a place-name (in spite of the possible correspondence with Pretapuri) but as a description of smasana, while the last appears rather to be an epithet as I suggest. Even Kokat;~a has doubt cast upon it by the suggestion that is an alternative name for the term upacchandoha: 'and Kokat;~a is called upacchandoha for short'."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"SECRET SIGNS I. vii (20) Vajragarbha said: 'Lord, which are those days?'

A saptiivarta (seven times) is any man or woman who has transmigrated in human form throughout seven lives. Their characteristics are these: they appear with seven shadows, their eyes are unflinching, there are three creases on their foreheads, their bodies emit a pleasing odour, and so on. If you see such a one, offer him flowers in salutation, circumambulate him and address him thus: \"0 Great Lord of Y ogins, the time has come to act for the good of such as us.\" If you address him thus he will surrender his life. As soon as he has surrendered it, you should make of his flesh pellets as big as the kernel of a juniper berry(?), saying, \"We all will eat these, and you shall apportion to all beings even as to yourself\", and he will grant the siddhi of activity throughout space. Then having washed and compounded the ordinary flesh, that of the hanging corpse and the slain-in-battle, make it into pellets and eat it, and you will make an end of wrinkles and white hair. The figurative meaning of this is given in the Miilatantra: \"This excellent dhvaja which is the body, cleansed from the veins which are figured by the gallows, con-sumes the flesh which is the bodhicitta, and the yogin gains supreme perfection.\" As for the figurative meaning of the saptiivarta it is said: ''Of all embodied beings this body represents seven births, for from the eating and drinking of food and drink with their six flavours, these are digested and nourishment increases. This is called the first birth. Then blood is formed and this is the second birth.

This is a hybrid interpretation, for while the ritual is accepted literally, the intention is idealized. It is not in order to win these beings as disciples that their flesh is eaten, but to gain their inherent power, the years of youth cut short in the hanged criminal and slain warrior, and the accumulated virtue of the person with seven human lives to his credit. More acceptable is the completely figurative interpretation, e.g. of K. The beings are the five skandhas, the flesh their self-nature; this is consumed and they are thereby freed from their phenomenal nature of mere appearance. 1 K: 'One should concentrate upon the bhaga, that is a triangle, white like the moon in Autumn, called origin of the elements (dharmas), in space, that is to say in the space enclosed within the vajra-balustrade and canopy' (p. 123, 11. 23-25). z These figurative representations ( cakra) are as follow: for Earth a square envisaged as arising from LAI\\'[ for W~ter a circle envisaged as arising from VAl\\'[ for Fire a triangle envisaged as arising from RAI\\'[ for Wind a semicircle envisaged as arising from YAI\\'[ This list is given in accordance with K(p. I23,1l. 31 ff.) and Bh (xv. 237b 7-238a I). The syllables of origination do not agree, however, with a similar list given by G. Tucci (I-T i, p. 49) and by Gisbert Combaz ('L'Evolution du Stiipa en Asie', MCB 2, pp. 252-3). See also PK p. 2, vv. 19-22 where the syllables of origination are those listed above. The order of manifestation is here wind, fire, water, earth. Likewise Siidhanamiilii, p. 226 last four lines (translated by Tucci in Teoria e Pratica del Ma1Jifala, p. 41). This is the correct order, as K is aware (p. I23, ll. 27-29), but our text reverses them none the less. 3 The divinities are the four goddesses, Locanii, Miimaki, Piii).Q.arii, and Tiirii. See K (p. I04, 11. 7-I4). 4 The four elements are also envisaged as being within the yogin himself, situated at the navel, heart, throat, and top of the head. See Introduction, p. 38.

So far as the words are concerned, these mean-ings assigned to them are completely arbitrary. The basis for identification lies in the theory of the ma1J¢ala without and the ma1J¢ala within the body.

The Omniscient One is Vajradhara (according to K) or Vajrasattva (according to S), who is the product of the union of Sun and Moon. See above I. iii. I I and viii. 8. Hence the present equation.

This self-experiencing, this bliss supreme, arises from the pure condition of the spheres ,of sense. (4) Form and so on and whatever other spheres of sense there are, for the yogin all these appear in their purified condition, for of Buddha-nature1 is this world. (5) Vajragarbha said: '0 Lord, what are these things unpurified?' The Lord replied: 'They are form and so on. And how so? Because of their nature as subject and object.' Vajragarbha said: 'What are these subjects and objects?' (6) The Lord replied: 'Form is perceived by the eye, sound is heard by the ear, smell is perceived by the nose, and taste by the tongue, 'tis sure; (7) things are sensed by the body and feelings of pleasure and so on are received by the mind. These are worthy of indulgence and should be indulged, when once rendered innocuous by purification.

I3I, I. 7). 5 All versions read Vajrii (instead of Nairiitmyii), thus her name appears twice in this set of five. Although textually unchallengeable, it is certainly Nairiitmyii who is intended, . for she, like Ak~obhyafHevajra, is dve~iitmika and occupies the centre of the mmpjala.

(5) With these the matzrJala should be made, in size three cubits plus three inches. The celestial spell who comes of the Five Families, should be placed there, (6) or whatsoever sixteen-year-old girl is found.6 Ayogini is resorted to, so long as she possesses sukra. (7) One binds the face of the prajfiii and like-wise of the upiiya, and the product of the service rendered one drops into the pupil's mouth. (8) In that very act the Flavour of Sameness should be placed within the pupil's range. b. From self-experiencing comes this knowledge, which is free from ideas of self and other; (9) like the sky it is pure and void, the essence supreme of non-existence and existence, a mingling of Wisdom and Means, a mingling of passion and absence of passion. (1o) It is the life of living things, it is the Unchanging One Supreme; it is all-pervading, abiding in all embodied things.

(2) For Conjuring forth one directs the two eyes towards the right and upwards. For Petrifying the gaze is central with the eyes looking towards the end of the tip of the nose.3 1 The text has only: 'Compassion and means is the yogin, the mudrii by freedom from cause.' K supplies the deficiency: 'The mudrii is Wisdom, and what is that? Why Voidness, the non-arising of all the dharmas. And how does this non-arising, this Voidness, come about? Because of absence of the cause' (p. 135, II. 12-14). For full discussion of this theme see Stcherbatsky, Nirviitza, pp. 71 ff. 2 For this rrth chapter we rely chiefly upon V's commentary. 3 'The yogin who is striving to apply himself to the subjugating of some evil person, should make himself into his own chief divinity in appearance like to Ak~obhya, and gazing with the two eyes level and directed towards the forehead, he should meditate, intone the mantras, and make sacrifice, and thereby the overthrowing will come about. (He looks) upwards because there is the bodily form of him who belongs to the family of wrath (Ak~obhya). The yogin who is striving to subdue the threefold world by some means of yoga, should make himself like to Padmariiga, and turning his two eyes together towards the left, by performing the meditation and so on, he will subdue the person. This is because the bodily form of Padmariiga is to the left. Likewise the yogin who is striving to conjure forth (some being in) the threefold world should make himself like Suryodayi*, and gazing with his eyes together slightly to the right and upwards, by practising the meditation and so on, he will conjure this being forth. This is because the bodily form of Suryodayi is to the right. Likewise the yogin who is striving to reduce to rigidity someone in the threefold world, should make himself like Pitarajaki*, and gazing with his eyes together over the tip of his nose, by practising the meditation and so on he will reduce the being to rigidity.

(2) The Lord replied: 'One who desires perfection should keep his inner self in union with Nairatmya or Sri Heruka, and not even for a moment should his thought be deflected elsewhere. (3) For one who is persever-ing for the first time, that place is considered propitious, where single-minded and self-collected a yogin may gain success. (4) At night in his own house, confident of gaining perfection, the wise man should meditate upon the Yogini or upon Sri Heruka in his manifested form. (5) (Moreover at all times) whether washing the feet or eating, rinsing the mouth or chewing betel-nut, rubbing the hands with sandal-wood, or girding the hips with the loin-cloth, (6) going-out, making conversation, walking, standing, in wrath, in laughter, the wise man should honour the Lady, strong in his vows, he should meditate upon the Yogini.1 (7) Seekers of 1 K refers to this practice as concentrated yoga (samiihitayoga) and continuous yoga (nirantarayoga). The first is. performed on fixed occasions, 'at the three times (trisandhi) and elsewhen' (B: xv. 269a 6); the other is a continuous process of mental control. Com-pare the end of Ch. 4, Part I.

(I I) By fears and passions and sorrows, by griefs and torments and such calamities, by passion, wrath, and delusion, the yogin is not disturbed. (Iz) Thus understanding the ripening of the fruit of good and evil acts, how should yogins stay one moment in the Raurava Hell? (I3) Perpetrators of the five great evil acts and those who delight in taking life, also those of wretched birth, and fools who are wicked in their conduct, ( I4) and ugly brutes with distorted limbs, these gain perfection by the right use of thought. So certainly will he succeed who practises the ten virtues, is devoted to his master with his senses well controlled, (I 5) and is free from pride and wrath. c. Keeping continuously to the practice, perfected in the siddhi and self-collected, ( I6) for one month one should privately continue, while one awaits the acquiring of a mudrii. The yogin then receives instructions. He is instructed by the yoginls: (I7) \"Take such and such a Mudra, 0 Vaj~ radhrk, and serve the cause of living-beings;\" Taking this girl, who has wide-open eyes and is of age2 and endowed with youth and beauty, (I8) he should consecrate her with the seed of enlightenment.

Then taking her, one should perform the practice with the realization of one's own composure. (22) For this practice, which is called terrifying in appear-ance, 1 is not taught for the sake of enjoyment, but for the examination of one's own thought, whether the mind is steady or waving.' d. (23) Vajragarbha said: 'By one who is joined in union with Nairatmya how can any distinction be made in the meaning of mudrii? And with this Mudra and that Mudra, with two Mudras in fact, how should the perfection of the Great Mudra come about ?'2 (24) The Lord replied: 'Relinquishing her form as a woman, she would assume that of her Lord. Gone ate her breasts, and his vajra is manifest with a bell on each side, where the lotus had been. (25) The rest of the form of the mighty and blissful Heruka (26) easily assumes the masculine condition of the man who is in union with Heruka, and from this the perfection of the Great Symbol would come about for the yogin of such manifest power. ( 27) This identity of Wisdom and Means remains unharmed by the twofold process of origination and dissolution, for Means is the origination and Wisdom the dissolution and end of existence. (28) So in truth there is neither destruction nor origination. Having dissolved away, it has come to its end, and since there can now be no dissolution, neither is there destruction. (29) The yogin conceives of the diversity of existence as the Process of Emanation, and realizing the dream-like nature of this diversity, he renders it undiversified by means of its diversity. (30) Like a dream, like a mirage, like the \"intermediate state\", so the maJJ¢ala appears from continuous application to the practice. (3 I) The great bliss, such as one knows it in the consecrations of the Great Symbol, of that the maJJ¢ala is the full and efficacious expression, for nowhere else does it have its origin. (32) This bliss is black and yellow, red and white,· dark green, dark blue, all things moving and unmoving. (33) This bliss is Wisdom, this bliss is Means, and likewise it is their union. It is existence, it is non-existence, and it is Vajrasattva.'3 (34) Vajragarbha said: 'This state of unity achieved in the Process of 1 K says it is terrifying in appearance because it is very bad, but he construes wrongly.

But the answer given implies a slightly different ques-tion: 'How by union with Nairlitmyii (alone) does the condition of the (Great) Mudra come about, since perfection in the (Great) Mudra comes from two elements, Wisdom and Means?' Bh and V therefore interpret the sloka in this sense, or rather attempt to do so, for the text wiJJ not permit it. 3 The themes of this discourse, namely the essential unity of Hevajra and Nairiitmyli, of Means and Wisdom, of the evolution and reabsorption of existence, and of the mmpj.ala as the representation of this process, are discussed in the Introduction, pp. 24, 32-3."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"II. ii THE HEVAJRA-TANTRA Realization is deemed as Excellent Bliss, as Great Bliss, so what is the use of the Process of Emanation except for conceiving it as Realization?' (35) The Lord replied: 'Oho, Great Bodhisattva, by dint of faith it is destroyed, they say.1 e. Without bodily form how should there be bliss? Of bliss one could not speak. The world is pervaded by bliss, which pervades and is itself per-vaded. (36) Just as the perfume of a flower depends upon the flower, and without the flower becomes impossible, likewise without form and so on, bliss would not be perceived. (37) I am existence, I am not existence, I am the Enlightened One for I am enlightened concerning what things are. But me they do not know, those fools, afflicted by indolence. (38) I dwell in Sukhavati in bliss with the Vajrayogini, in that place which is symbolized by the syllable E, 2 in that casket of buddha-gems. (39) I am the teacher, and I am the doctrine, I am the disciple endowed with good qualities. I am the goal, and I am the trainer. I am the world and worldly things. (40) My nature is that of Innate Joy and I come at the end of the Joy that is Perfect and at the beginning of the Joy of Cessation. 3 So be assured, my son, it is like a lamp in darkness. (41) I am the Master with the thirty-two marks, the Lord with the eighty characteristics and I dwell in bliss in Sukhavati and my name is sukra. (42) Without this there would be no bliss, and without bliss this would not be. Since they are ineffective one without the other, bliss is found in union with the divinity. (43) So the Enlightened One is neither existence nor non-existence; he has a form with arms and faces and yet in highest bliss is formless. (44) So the whole world is the Innate, for the Innate is its essence. Its essence too is nirviitta when the mind is in a purified state. (45) The divine form consists of just something born, for it is a repository of arms and face and colours, and moreover arises by the normal influence of past actions.4 1 B: 'By power of faith means by the self impelled by faith.

It is called a baptism because impurity is washed away, that is to say here that the impurity of the body is washed away. It is called the consecration (or baptism) of the jar, because it is characterized by (the use of) a jar, and the consecration of the Master because it is far removed from evil and wickedness. It is also called the consecration of knowledge (vidyii), because it overthrows ignorance and arouses an awareness of the five spheres of knowledge (paiicavidyajfiana). Now a consecration is a bestowing of power, and (in this case) it bestows power in the nirma1Jakiiya. The place of consecration is the body, and the instruments are the jar, the crown and so on. The Secret Consecration is so called, because it is a secret from the sriivakas, pratyeka-buddhas and all those below them. It is a baptism because it washes away impurities of speech, and a consecration because it bestows power in the smpbhogakaya. The place of consecration is the throat, and the agent of consecration is the bodhicitta, the bindu which has been experienced by the Master. The Consecration in the Knowledge of Prajfia (prajfiajiiana) is so called because it depends upon the prajfia and has the effect of arousing wisdom. As a baptism it washes away the impurities of the mind, and as a consecration it bestows power in the dharmakiiya. The place of consecration is the vajra, and the agent of consecration is the prajfiii. with the lotus. The Fourth Consecration is so called because it is fourth, a word understood in relationship to the third; it is the precious consecration. As a baptism it washes away all tendencies towards evil of body, speech, and mind, and as a consecration it bestows power in the Body of Great Bliss (mahiisukhakiiya). The place of consecration is the body, speech, and mind. As for the agent of consecration, one requires to have some guru as one's sup-port, and with his inner power one needs no (other) agent.' dan po ta bum pal;zi dban nam slob dpon gyi dban zes bya bani I abhi~inca dri ma ~tkhrus pas na dban ste 1 !us kyi dri ma l;zkhrud par byed! bum pas fie bar mtshon pas bum pal;zi dban zes bya I sdig pa midge ba las rin du l;zgro bas na slob dpon gyi dban zes bya I ma rig pa lna bzlog cin rig pal;zi ye ses lna bskyed pal;zi phyir rig pal;zi dban zes bya I abhi,eka ste nus pa l;zjog pa ni sprul pal;zi skul;zi nus pa l;zjog f bskur bal;zi gnas ni !us la bskur la dban rdzas ni bum pa dan I dbu rgyan la sags pal;zo 1 gsan bal;zi dban la abhi,ifica ste fian thos dan rail sans rgyas rnall;zbyor 95"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"II. iii THE HEVAJRA-TANTRA the second by a gaze, the third in an embrace, and the .fourth in union.

Tell me Lord, just how things are, for doubt assails me.' (27) The Lord replied: 'The ma'IJt!ala is the very essence, we say; it is bodhicitta and the great bliss itself.

You should frequent others' wives. (3o) Now to practise singleness of thought is the taking of life, for the thought is the life. To vow to save all men is interpreted as lying-speech.

HAJ¥ (bodhicitta) rests in the head, AJ¥ (Ca1}1jtili) in the navel. (Mantras)* resound con-tinuously. Compassion is practised, not gross licence. One consumes the notion of a self, and drinks the drink of great bliss. The breath is concentrated within; passion, &c. are kept away. Form, feeling, power of perception and .consciousness are all purified. The impulses (sa1J!sktira) and the Self are here consumed in this yoga, that is to say, are rendered non-substantial. There is the bliss-giving motion (phre1J!kha1Ja) of the bodhicitta, and again its motion (kheta).t Existence and non-existence cannot be distinguished. The drops are a unity ( ?--nira1J!/a) because of their sameness of nature. By means of the veins the body is pervaded. In that yoga the non-substantiality of all the t!harmas (the corpse) takes possession (vol. II. p. 146, 11. 4-I7). 1 Defining /riherukarupeya, V. refers to I. vii. 27. 2 'thought impassioned'-V: 'to be moved by great compassion by the cause of oneself and others, undefiled by that defect that consists in the absence of passion' -chags pa dan bral bal;ti skyon gyis migos par bdag gzangyi don du sfiinrje chenpo g'yo bar bya zes bya bal;ti don to I (xv. 109a 7-b I). The dancing is the meditation (I. vi.

Io9b I). As vtik they sing, as ktiya they dance. Now Speech is Amitiibha and Body is Vairocana (see Introduction, p. 28).

The last one of alP must be firmly rejected, for there is no sixteenth phase. (26) And why is that? Because it is non-productive of an effect. The moon with its fifteen phases represents the Thought of Enlightenment. It is the great bliss symbolized by the fifteen vowels and the yoginzs are its phases.' e.

(30) As relative, white as white jasmine, as absolute essentially blissful, it arises in the lotus-paradise, which is symbolized by the word EVA¥.

(34) But all these elements are really sunk in nirvii1Ja, and it is only from delusion that they appear as sa1{lsiira. The wise man continues in sa1Jlsiira, but this Sa1JlSiira is recognized as nirvii1Ja, for he has brought this about by the process of purification.

With her that perfection is found that bestows the bliss of the Great Symbol. (44) Form and sound, smell, taste, touch, and sphere of thought, are all enjoyed in this Prajiia.

The internal mingling that comes about, is figured in the external union of two.2 (51) The three kiiyas are found within the body in the form of the cakras, and the perfect knowledge of these three kayas is the cakra of Great Bliss.

(53) The nirmatJakaya is in the place where the birth of all beings comes about.3 One is born or fashioned (nirmiyate) and therefore it is called nirmatza. (54) Dharma consists of thought and the dharmakaya is at the heart. (55) Sambhoga is enjoyment which consists in the six kinds of flavour, and so the sambhogakaya is at the throat. The mahasukhacakra is in the head. (56-57) (The Four Fruits4 are situated thus:) The fruit which corresponds (n#yandaphala) is at the navel. The fruit of retribution (vipakaphala) is at the heart. The fruit of manly activity is in the throat (puruFakaraphala). 1 One might translate: 'The internal as much as the external is called samvara.' The commentaries provide a variety of paraphrase for this and the following verse. The whole thought is very ill expressed but is straightforward enough. Just as in the external per-formance vajra and lotus are united in the rite, so too in the internal mm;ufala the Great Symbol is realized by the union of A ( = Wisdom or Lotus) which is situated in the navel-cakra, and of HAJVI ( = Means or Vajra) which is situated in the head-cakra.

On hearing that all beings are essentially blissful, K raises the false objection: 'But surely the denizens of hell do .not enjoy the same happiness as the gods and so on. Certainly not, we reply, for they do not know the bliss of gods and titans, but then enlightened beings do not regard the bliss of gods and titans as true bliss.

Ak~obhya's (see diagram VIII).

(83) Vajragarbha said: 'Ca:r;H;Hilini is said to be fire, so why is she signed with the Gem (Paisunya, family of Ratnasambhava)? It would be suitable with the sign of Passion (raga); for Ca:r_1c;lali we want no other sign.'

In verse 22 the word uhami (A) or uumi (K), translated in my version as 'consume', seems to have caused difficulty, for no text gives a reasonable interpretation. K translates as paiyiimi 'I see'; T translates with J:xtshal, a polite word used elsewhere in this work with the sense of 'to know' (see vol. II, Vocabulary). Rand D translate by khums, an extremely rare word, of which the meaning is recorded in no dictionary with any precision. It would seem to be connected with l:zkhums 'understand ( ?)'

No other commentator offers any explanation. It seems, however, that the whole difficulty arises from an early mis-reading, namely of u for tja which are very close graphically, and indeed in the same line of A sihliiu might equally well be sihliit/a.

Likewise the eight in the left hand : for pleasantness to the touch, for destroying delusion, for preserving bliss, for taking knowledge, for cutting off the klesas at the root, for indicating bliss, for the non-existence of the klesas, and for indicating that spot which is immaculate.' fion moizs pa gcod par mdzad pa dati I stoiz pa iiid kyi sgra sgrogs pa daiz I mi g'yo bal;ti bde ba daiz I ie sdan la sags pa de kho na iiid kyis rgyan (? rgyun) du beans pa daiz I bya ba thams cad la the tshom med par bya ba dan I dgra bcom pa brtan pa dan I chos kyi l;zkhor lo bskor ba dan I fion mons pa giom pal;zi phyir I g'yas na gri gug la sogs pal;zi phyag mtshan brgyad rim pa biin du sbyar ro I de biin du g'yon pal;zi brgyad ni ll:zdi ltar reg na bde ba dan I gti mug bsad par bya ba dan 1 bde ba bskyaiz ba dan 1 ye ses blaiz ba dan 1 non mons pa tshar bead pa daiz I bde ba mtshon pa dan I iion mons pa med pa daiz I dri ma med pal;zi gnas mtshon pa ste f rim pa bZin du sbyar bar byabo I (xv. 122a 3-6). 2 At this point the text inserts a Sloka, which seems to have nothing to do with the present context.

(48) Then the Goddess asks about the matzgala, (49) and the Master of Mighty Knowledge, blissful and self-collected, draws it there himself. (so) There is one circle, surrounded by flames of different hues, with four doors and four portals, adorned with vajra-threads and the series of five colours. (5 I) He draws then the eight vessels, all done with powder made from the five kinds of gem or from rice and so on, or else from cemetery bricks or the charcoal from the funeral pyre. (52) In the centre he draws a lotus with its pericarp and eight petals. At the centre of this he draws a skull, white and in three sections. (53) Then on the north-east petal he draws a lion, on the south-east a monk, on the south-west a wheel and on the north-west a vajra, (54) on the eastern a knife, on the southern a drum, on the western a tortoise, and on the northern a serpent. (55) These are the eight symbols of the goddesses in accordance with their different categories. In the centre he draws a white skull, signed with a crossed-vajra, (56) and (to the east) he places the sacred Vessel of Victory with branches in it and enwrapped with cloth, the five gems inside and filled with siilija. I (57) But why say more? The matz¢ala-ritual should be per-formed as it is given in the Tattvasatpgraha.2 (58) Into the matztfala one should cause to enter the eight blissful Spells, twelve or sixteen years of age, and adorned with necklaces and bangles. (59) They are called wife, sister, daughter, niece, maternal uncle's wife, maternal aunt, mother-in-law, and paternal aunt. (6o) These the yogin should honour with deep embraces and kisses. Then he should drink camphor and sprinkle the matztfala with it. (61) He should cause them to drink it and he should quickly gain siddhi. Wine is drunk and meat and herbs are eaten. (62) Next he removes their garments and kisses them again and again. They honour him in return and sing and dance to their best, (63) and they play there together in the union of vajra and lotus. Then at the second stage he should cause the pupil to enter, (64) and having covered his eyes with a cloth, he should afterwards display to him the matz¢ala.3 Consecration is given there in that lonely place at night. (65) The consecrations are as ordained, distinguished as that of the Master and so on. Good pupils should first pronounce words of praise and worship. 4 ( 66) Then he initiates him in the truth itself, which is experienced at the beginning of the Joy of Cessation, and at the end of the Joy Perfect. 1 Compare the description at I. x. 2I-29· 2 See Introduction, p. 18, fn.

This is the end of the Joy Perfect and the beginning of the Joy of Cessation,3 Void and non-Void, the state of Heruka.' CHAPTER vi. THE MAKING OF A PAINTING a. (1-2) Then the Lord discoursed upon the five symbolic adornments.4 (3) The crown is worn for the adoration of one's guru and master and chosen divinity. Ear-rings are worn to indicate one's deafness to evil words spoken against one's guru and \"vajra-holder\". (4) The necklace suggests the mantras intoned, the bracelets one's renunciation of harming living-beings, the girdle one's service of the Mudrii. The body should always be signed with these signs of the Five Buddhas.' b. (5-6) Then the Goddess asked Hevajra: 'In accordance with what precept and what ritual should one make a painting of Hevajra? May the Lord of Great Bliss please tell me.' ( 7) He replied: 'By a painter who belongs to our tradition, by a yogin of our tradition, this fearful painting should be done, and it should be painted with the five colours reposing in a human skull and with a brush made from 1 K explains antam antmrz as the two first consecrations, that of the Master, and the Secret (p. 154, 1. z8). This would be true by implication. R similarly identifies them with the third consecration, adding: 'This is hidden in all tantras, that is to say, it is not made clear. But in the last resort it is made clear, that is to say that here, the very limit of all tantras, it becomes clear'--mthalz zes paste ses rab yeses so zes palzi don to 1 de iiid ni rgyud rnams kun tu sbas pa ste zes pa ste I gsa[ por ma mdzad do zes so I mthar thug .rab gsal balzo ies ni rgyud thams cad kyi mthar thug pa lzdir ni rab tu gsa[ bar gsuns palzo I (xvii. 33 zb z-2). 2 This is literally translated, and refers to the meeting of yogin and yogini.

The book should be written by one of our tradition on leaves of birch-bark twelve angula long, with collyrium for ink and with a human bone as a pen.

(I o) Then seated upon one's tiger-skin one should eat the food with eagerness, the sacramental herbs and the special flesh.3 Having eaten and eaten again, one should worship the mother-goddesses there, (I I) and perhaps the mother may be sister or niece or mother-in-law.4 One should honour them to a high degree and 1 For nirmp!uka as bone-ornament, see II. iii. 56.

(I) Then the yoginls asked: 'What is the Great Symbol like in relative form? May thou, the giver of bliss, please tell us.' (2) The Lord replied: 'She is neither too tall, nor too short, neither quite black nor quite white, but dark like a lotus-leaf. 1 (3-4) Her breath is sweet, and her sweat has a pleasant smell like that of musk. Her pudenda give forth a scent from moment to moment like different kinds of lotuses2 or like sweet aloe wood. (5) She is calm and resolute, pleasant in speech and al-together delightful, with beauteous hair and three wrinkles in the middle of her body. By vulgar men, in fact, she would be classed as first-rank. Having gained her, one gains that siddhi, the nature of which is the Joy Innate.' b. (6) Then Nairatmya said: 'Lord, what kind of vow should be made?' He replied: 'May I be born from birth to birth as a member of this family, free from mania, compassionate, devoted to my guru, abiding by our conventions and an expounder of Hevajra. (7) May I be born from birth to birth, proclaiming this doctrine profound and ringing the vajra-bell, concentrating in myself the essence of woman.' c. (8) Then pleased at this the Goddess asked: 'Those unworthy beings who are hard to tame, how are they brought to subjugation?' (9) The Lord replied: 'First there should be the public confession (po~adha), then they should be taught the ten rules of virtuous conduct, then the Vaibhii~ya teachings and then the Sautriintika, ( IO) after that the Yogiiciira and then the Miidhyamika. Then when they know all mantra-method, they should start upon Hevajra. The pupil who lays hold with zeal, should succeed, there is no doubt. CHAPTER ix. MANTRAS a. (I) Now I shall speak of the splitting of the human-complex, 3 how by the mere knowledge of which the yogin gains the end he seeks, and causes his victim to split open at the navel for one cubit's length.

By the force of the qualities of his inherent nature, colour for that man consists in black. He performs the rite of slaying.' ... 'Who-ever has a line like a white wheel with eight spokes, is initiated by Vairocana, and by the force of the qualities of his inherent nature, colour for that man consists in white. He performs the rite of propitiation.' Thus it continues, allocating the rite of conjuring forth to those of Amitiibha's family, the rite of petrifying to those of Ratnasambhava's, the rites of exorcizing and the rest (bskrad pa la sogs pal;zi las grub bo) to Amoghasiddhi's, and all rites to Vajrasattva's.-skyes bu (lam bud med gail gi srin lag gi rtsa bal;zi tshig na re klui gnas pa na rdo rje rtse dgu pa lta bu yod pa ·ni Mi bskyod pal;zi rigs su byin gyis rlab ste I ran bzin yon tan gyi db an gis mi de la mdog kyan nag por gnas pa ste I bsad pa l;zgrub bo I ... gan la (lkhor lo dkar po rtsibs brgyad pa lta bul;zi re kha gnas pa ni I rNam par snan mdzad kyis byin gyis brlabs pa ste 1 ran bZin yon tan dban gis mi defzi mdog kyan dkar por gnas te 1 zi ba l;zgrub bo I &c.

The fact that all men are supposedly members of one family or another by nature, would suggestthe former. But we seek precision here where no precision is forthcoming from our commentators.

Literally a (purificatory) sprinkling, the basic sense seems to come close to that of 'baptism'. It has acquired, however, the wider sense of any kind of initiation rite. In the earlier tantric period (as typified by the Mafijtdrimiilakalpa and the Sarvatathagatatattvasa-qzgraha) it refers primarily to initiation into the mystic significance of the matzrfala. Since there is explicit analogy with the rite of royal consecration, for which the term abhi~eka is also used, 'consecration' seems to be the most suitable general translation. But the idea of a purificatory sprinkling is never lost. 'As externally one washes away exterior dirt with water, so one sprinkles water for the washing away of ignorance; it is thus called a sprinkling' (Advayavajrasa'J!lgraha, p. 36). In accordance with the general theory of the Buddhist tantric yogins, for whom everything goes in fours (Hevajra-tantra, I. i. 30 ), there are four consecrations: I. Master-Consecration. 2. Secret Consecration. 3· Consecration in Knowledge of Prajfiii. 4-Fourth Consecration. The first consecration may also be known as the Jar-Consecration (kalasiibh#eka), for it consists of six subsidiary consecrations, in all of which the ritual jar (kalaia) is used. These six consecrations are those of Water, Crown, Vajra, Bell, Name, and Master.1 It is presumably because the Master-Consecration completes the set of six, that this name is also given to the whole set. The main set of four, with which the Hevajra-tantra is primarily concerned (see Index, consecrations), is interrelated with other sets of four, especially the four Moments (k~atza), the four Joys (iinanda) and the four Mudra. Externally they are related with the four classes of tantras and symbolized by the smile, gaze, embrace, and union (II. iii. I I and 54). This set of four gestures is presumably related with the actual meeting of yogins and yoginis at places of pilgrimage (see I. vii). Concerning the internal interrelations I quote K(vol. II, p. I07, I. 24ff.): ' \"Consecration is said to be fourfold for the benefit of living beings. One is sprinkled, that is to say cleansed and the consecrations are distin-guished as four.\" Thus it is said (in our text, II. iii. 10) \"the Master, the Secret, the Prajfiii and then the Fourth thus\", &c. In this yogini-1 Seep. 95 fn., Hevajrasekaprakriyii (JA, July-Sept. 1934), pp. 39-40, and Advayavajra-smpgraha, p. 36. 131"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY OF SPECIAL TERMS tantra the Master-Consecration is given, in order that (the initiate) may progress far from evil dharmas. It is his \"bond\" (sarttvara). The essential nature of the Master-Consecration is a conferment by means of the Karmamudrii and contains in essence the four Moments and the four Joys. Some say that one can receive the Master-Consecration by the mere receiving of the non-retrogression· Consecration ( avaivartikiibhi-~eka1), which is common to the kriyiitantras and all the others; one is then worthy, they say, for exposition and initiation in the yoga-tantras, yogini-tantras and so on. What an idea is this? In the first place then one is consecrated with the Master-Consecration in the Hevajra-tantra or some other yogini-tantra, so that one may be worthy of the initiation, reflection and meditation (which follow). Then in accordance with one's knowledge the Master, the Secret, the Prajfiii and the Fourth are charac-terized momentarily and so known. 'In the case of those of weak sensibility, who have received the Master-Consecration, when once their zealous application has been established, they should be given instruction in meditation with the Karmamudrii. Thus under the aspect of the Process of Realization (ni~pannakrama2) with the Gem (mat;zi = tip of the vajra) set in the Secret ( = lotus) they experience in accordance with their master's instructions the four Joys which have the nature of four Moments; this experience is the Secret Consecration because it cannot be explained to yogins in terms of diffuse mental concepts. 'Now in the consecration of those of medium sensibility instruction is given in meditation (bhiivanii) on the Samayamudrii. Even thus is Prajfiii (Wisdom), for she is the highest knowledge, the knowledge that all the elements (dharmas) are nothing but one's own thought (citta-miitra). For conferring this the consecration is the Consecration of the Knowledge of Prajfiii. In the unity of the three veins, which represent the three kinds of consciousness, imaginary (kalpita), contingent (para-tantra) and absolute (parin#panna), one marks the four Moments by means of the Gem and in accordance with one's master's instructions. Because of the external mudrii ( = feminine partner) it is properly known as the Knowledge of Prajfiii. 'When this consecration has been given, instruction is given to those of strong sensibility in the Dharmamudrii, the mental concentration (samiidhi) in which all appears as illusion. And so (it is said: II. iii. 10) \"then the Fourth thus\". It is \"thus-ness\" (tathatii), the climax of being (bhiltakoti), the elemental sphere (dharmadhiitu) and similar names with-out any difference of meaning. The consecration by which its nature is 1 See Hevajrasekaprakriyii, p. 43; correct avaivan;zika to read avaivartika, amending translation accordingly. 2 See Glossary below, p. 139, utpattikrama. 132"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY OF SPECIAL TERMS seen or realized, its \"thus-ness\", is indicated by the word \"thus;,. \"Then\" means that it is given immediately after the Consecration in the Knowledge of Prajfiii. So this perfection is experienced with the external mudrii and by one's master's instruction, yet by a process of yoga which has no object of experience (aniilambanayogena); it is characterized by the absence of discrimination with regard to definite places of origin. This is the Fourth Consecration.' See also D's interpretation (translated p. 95 fn.), where the stages are related progressively with the four buddhakiiya and with personality as expressed in the formula, Body, Speech, and Mind. The Tibetan term dbmi--bskur-ba means literally 'bestowal of power'. adhz~thiina. From the literal meaning of 'position', this word is applied specifically to 'authoritative position' and then to the 'power' pertaining to such a position. It can therefore mean the power which belongs naturally to divine forms and in this sense it comes near to the Christian conception of 'grace'. It can also refer to the power which is experienced spontaneously in meditation or achieved through the recitation of mantras. In that it may be transmitted by a man of sanctity to his disciples, it may also be translated as 'blessing'. Abhi~eka is essentially a ritual empowerment. Adhi~thiina refers to innate or spontaneous power and always with the connotation of active expression; in the sense of 'grace' or 'blessing' it becomes, however, a form of empowerment. For its use in various contexts see 'empowerment' in the Index. The Tibetan translation is byin-rlabs, literally 'power-wave'. Byin means 'power' in the special sense of its inherent splendour (i.e. majesty). Byin-rlabs is also used to translate Sanskrit prabhiiva (power, lustre, splendour), which thereby becomes implicitly a synonym for adh#thiina. Byin-rlabs is often written as byin-gyis (b)rlabs-pa, as though (b)rlabs were the perfect root of a verb: rlob-pa perf. brlabs fut. brlab imp. rlobs In fact the imperative form byin-gyis rlobs appears quite regularly in ritual texts and elsewhere. This verb scarcely occurs, it seems, apart from byin, but it is given both as rlob-pa and with the reduplicated form rlob-rlob-pa, meaning 'to billow', in the br Da-dag min-tshig gsal-ba of dGe-bSes Chos-kyi Grags-pa (Ko-hsi ch'ii cha: Tsang-wen tz'u-tien), Peking 1957, p. 846. adhyiitmika. Internal or esoteric, in contrast with biihya, external or exoteric. Thus the contents of the Hevajra-tantra can often be interpreted in two ways.

In the case of our texts neyiirtha means in effect 'literal meaning' and nftiirtha 'figurative meaning', thus reversing the normal meaning of these two terms. See Egerton, BHS Dictionary, p. 310. iinanda. Joy which is fourfold: (Just) Joy Perfect Joy Joy of Cessation Joy Innate iinanda paramiinanda viramiinanda sahajiinanda These joys are related fundamentally with sexual experience, envisaged as fourfold because 'everything goes in fours' (I. i. 30 ). Joy is the contact of lotus and vajra; perfect joy is the desire for yet more; the joy of cessation comes from the destruction of passion and the joy innate is a transcending experience sprung from the preceding joy (I. viii. 32-33 and K's commentary, vol. II, p. 127). The four joys are experienced at four successive moments (kwtza, q.v.), with which they are in a sense identical. Their relationship with the four consecrations (abhi~eka, q.v.) is more complex. The Master-Consecra-tion bestows them in anticipation; the Secret Consecration involves their actual experience by the master and their essence, still unrealized, is transferred to the pupil; in the Consecration of Knowledge of Prajfiii the pupil experiences them directly. His experience leads to the Fourth Consecration, which is identical with the Joy Innate. Schematically, however, the four joys are placed parallel with the consecrations and it is explicitly stated (seeK, vol. II, p. 132) that the first joy is experienced in the first consecration, the second in the second and so on. This would seem to be the esoteric interpretation arising from mystic experience (see saf!lvara, p. 138,). Concerning the possible variation in the order of the last two joys seep. 35· bhiivanii. Meaning literally 'causing to be', this is one of the words which I have translated as 'meditation' (comparedhyiina). It means 'meditation' in the special sense of mental production or thought-creation, corres-ponding with the emanative process of meditation discussed below (see utpattikrama). One may observe that 'being' (bhava) and 'meditation' (bhiivanii) are in essence identical. The first, which just 'is', is normally regarded in a falsified condition by ordinary men as a result of original accidental defilement (iigantukamala). The second is a deliberate pro-duction of 'being' in an idealized form, of which the mm;ujala is the 134"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY OF SPECIAL TERMS complete expression, and by means of this deliberate production the true nature of 'being' itself is spontaneously realized. bindu. Meaning literally a 'drop' or a 'point', bindu refers pre-eminently to the point at the centre of the mm;ujala, where all 'thought-creation' (bhiivanii) is absorbed. Hence it represents the Void (Siinyatii) or the 'Moon', which is the bodhicitta in its absolute aspect. Through identifica-tion of terminology it may also mean the bodhicitta in its relative aspect; thus it may be known as the white bindu, being paired with 'blood', which by analogy is called the red bindu. The Tibetan term thig-le (also used to translate Sanskrit tilaka) is the usual word for semen. It occurs glossed with bodhicitta on pp. 94 fn. and 95 fn. cakra. Literally 'wheel' or 'circle', cakra ref~rs pre-eminently to the circle of divine forms of which the mat,zijala consists. Hence it may mean 'manifested being', viz. 'existence' in relation with the 'point' (bindu), where all manifestation is absorbed. Cakra is also used in,a technical sense to refer to the 'psychic centres' within the yogin's body, envisaged as lotuses with radiating petals (see K, vol. II, p. 107). In the literal sense of 'wheel', it is the symbol of the Buddha-Family of Vairocana. ijiikini. This curious term, of which I have so far found no adequate definition, refers in Buddhist tantric tradition to a type of yogini, with which word it is all but synonomous. It is commonly related with the Sanskrit verbal root iji 'to fly', and represents that 'perfection which acts throughout the whole of space' (K, vol. II, p. 142). The Tibetan transla-tion mkhal;t-l;tgro-ma means 'she who goes in the sky'. The ijiikinis par excellence are the five yoginis who are identified with the five Buddhas and represent the unity of existence (sat[lvara). See diagram VIII, p. 130. On the other hand, the yogi'nis of flesh and blood, with whom the yogins come together at places of pilgrimage, may also be referred to as ijiikinis. However, their divine, rather mystic, aspect tends to predominate, especially in later Tibetan tradition. In Hindu tantric tradition they appear as the attendants of Kal.i, the Great Goddess, and their flesh-eating propensities relate them closely with the ritual feasts of tantric yogins (see Index, 'feasting'). They belong to the lowest stratum of tantric practice, but are purified in interpretation and elevated as supreme symbols. dhyiina. Derived from the root dhyai, 'to think or ponder', it is the general word for 'meditation'. Compare the special sense of bhiivanii, q.v.

The basic meaning is seal or sign, especially a hand-sign, which is the literal interpretation of the Tibetan term phyag-rgya. The related meaning 'symbol', presumably reached by way of 'symbolic gesture', has led to this word being used in a variety of special meanings, which seem at first to take one far from the basic meaning. As everything goes in fours (I. i. 30 ), there are four Mudrii: karmamudrii samayamudrii dharmamudrii mahiimudrii 'Rite Symbol' 'Convention Symbol' 'Truth Symbol' 'Great Symbol' The karmamudrii refers to the feminine partner, normally known as the Prajfiii ('Wisdom'), who plays an essential part in the second and third consecrations (see abhi~eka). The term mudrii itself is commonly used as a synonym for Prajfiii in this special sense (see Index). The samayamudrii refers to the use of conventional symbolic forms in meditation, e.g. concentration upon Heruka. See samaya below. The dharmamudrii refers to realization of the Absolute itself (dhar-madhiitu). The mahiimudrii is identical with the Joy Innate and is the final goal of the tantric yogin's practice. As such, it is one of the names given to their whole school."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY OF SPECIAL TERMS This set of four is not referred to explicitly in the Hevajra-tantra, where the only terms in use are mudrii in the sense of feminine partner1 and mahiimudrii, which is used not only to refer to the final goal, but also in the sense of partner, for she is identified with the central vein, AvadhiU'i, the blazing Cat}{liil'i who is Nairiitmyii (II. iv. 40-47).

The mudrii are discussed there in the order: karmamudrii-dharmamudrii-mahiimudrii-samayamudrii; the first three are conceived of as definite grades of realization, but the last seems to be added without any integral connexion with the others. In his own short work on the subject ( Caturmudropadesa, Narthang Tenjur, vol. xlvii, pp. zzob-224a)Maitrpa sets the four symbols side by side with the four joys: karmamudrii iinanda dharmamudrii paramiinanda mahiimudrii sahajiinanda samayamudrii viramiinanda Maitrpa's argument for placing the Joy Innate third has been given briefly on p. 35· If this comes third, then the mahiimudrii must also be placed third.

The meaning is still the same, but it has seemed suitable to use the term 'sacrament' in these contexts. The samaya is always the outward sign of an inner hidden power.

Sa1Jlvara has a special technical use in the sense of the union within the yogin's body, the 'internal mat).Q.ala' (see I. i. 21 ff. and II. iv. 48 ff.). Here it can refer to the union of macrocosm and microcosm as well as to the union of the two coefficients (represented by the two outer veins) in the central vein of the body, which is also the centre and union of all phenomenal forms. This unity is conceived of as a consuming by cosmic fire and this consuming is the consummation of the yogin's practice, his reintegration with the Innate, the supreme buddha-being. One may note in this respect the Tibetan translation of Saqwara ( = Saqwara, a form of Heruka) as 'Supreme Bliss' (bde-mchog). siddhi. 'Attainment' in the sense of 'Perfection' when referring to the highest religious striving; in the sense of 'Success' when referring to meaner objectives (see Index, rites). tantra. Literally the 'warp' of woven fabric, the term tantra refers to a clearly definable type of ritual text common to both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, concerned with the evoking of divinities and the gaining of various kinds of siddhi by means of mantra, dhyiina, mudrii and maruJala. K glosses the term with prabandha, 'connected discourse' and defines our work under three aspects: as a hetu-tantra ('cause-tantra'), members of the vajra-family being the cause; as a phala-tantra ('result-tantra'), the perfected form of Hevajra being the result; as an upiiya-tantra ('means-tantra'), the way which it teaches being the means (vol. II, p. ros). The Hevajra-tantra is in fact a yogini-tantra as distinguished from a yoga-tantra (seep. 132 above, also Buddhist Himalaya, p. 203). 138"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY OF SPECIAL TERMS According to another mode of grouping, it is classed as an anuttarayoga-tantra, a 'tantra of supreme yoga', for it is the means to the highest form of siddhi.1 Five classes of tantras are mentioned by K: kri'yii, caryii, yoga, yogottara and yoganiruttara (vol. II, p. 156), but the number was traditionally fixed at four (for everything goes in fpurs) and it was in four such groups that the Tibetans later arranged their impressive collection.

II, p. 142). K also refers to the universally authoritative nature (sarviidhikiiritva1Jt) of this Hevajra-tantra which is authoritative in that it is yogini-niruttara in kind (loc. cit.). It is suitable for women as well as men of all three grades: weak, medium, and strong sensibility (vol. II, p. 126). See the references to these grades under abhi$eka. upiiya. 'Means', one of the two supreme coefficients of final enlightenment, of which Wisdom(prajiiii, q.v.) is the other. For references to this pair, Wisdom and Means, see the Index. The Means par excellence is Hevajraf Heruka, with whom the yogin must identify himself (see pp. 32-33, 81. I. x. 30, II. iv. 78). In the rite of union the feminine partner is prajiiii and the yogin himself is upiiya {I. x. 7). utpattikrama and utpanna-or sa1[tpannakrama. These two terms refer cosmologically to the manifestation (utpiida) and reabsorption (pralaya) of phenomenal existence, and thus to the special technique of meditation which imitates this twofold process, thus identifying microscosm and macrocosm. By thought-creation (bhiivanii, q.v.) the yogin produces an idealized form of existence, symbolized by the divinities of the mat}(lala. This is the utpattikrama, 'Process of Emanation'.

In early (Vedic) times the vajra was the divine weapon of Indra, god of the sky and lord of thunder and storm. In this context the obvious translation is 'thunderbolt'. The Tibetans use the term rdo-rje, literally 'lord of stones'. It symbolizes pre-eminently whatever is be-lieved to be indestructible; thus it also has the meaning of 'diamond'. In the tantras vajra indicates the absolute nature of whatever it may be referred to. Thus Vajrasattva means 'Absolute Being', viz. supreme buddha-being. V ajraga!lthii means 'bell of the absolute', viz. the bell used in the rite of supreme realization. Everything associated with this intention assumes vajra-nature and the word is scattered freely through-out the texts. As an epithet I have used 'adamantine'. V ajradhiitu, 'adamantine sphere' is the Absolute itself, personified as the Supreme Buddha Vajrasattva, 'Adamantine Being'. Also in use is the adjective vajrin, used in our text either of Hevajra himself or by the pupil addres-sing his master ( vajraguru or vajriiciirya). See vajrin in the Index. The concealed meaning of vajra is male organ; as such it pairs with 'lotus' (padma). V ajradhara and V ajradhrk. 'Holder of the Vajra'. Vajradhrk is the name by which the master addresses the pupil during the rite (see Index). V ajradhara is used in the Hevajra-tantra (II. iv. 3 I; vi. 3) referring to masters, who belong to the tradition. It is already established in the Sarvatathiigatatattvasmpgraha as the title of supreme buddhahood and is in general use by the Buddhist tantric yogins (84 siddhas). Our commentators refer to the Supreme Buddha both as V ajrasattva and Vajradhara. Ak~obhya, the Buddha 'Imperturbable', as head of the vajra-family, is also V ajrasattva in essence and so may be considered Supreme Buddha by his family, to which those of the tradition of Hevajra belong.

Meaning literally 'purification', this word refers to the process, whereby the various divinities symbolize the macrocosm and microcosm under their several aspects, thus identifying them with aspects of buddha-hood. Thus the Five Yoginis (diagram VIII, p. 129) 'symbolize' on one side the five evils and on the other the five aspect$ of wisdom. This active symbolizing (viSuddhi) represents the intended effect of any 'con-ventional' or 'sacramental' form (samaya, q.v.). For references see the Index, purification. yoga. This is the one item for which it is scarcely practicable to give index-references, for the whole of the Hevajra-tantra is concerned with yoga, both in the sense of 'union' and that of the schemes, rites and practices, which should produce realization of that union. This tantra teaches the supreme type of yoga ( anuttarayoga), which is the final identification and unifying of the macrocosm in the body of the yogin. The main technicar terms used have their equivalents in the Hathayoga tradition (seeP. C. Bagchi, 'Some Technical Terms of the Tantras', Calcutta Oriental Journal, vol. i, no. 2, Nov. 1933, pp. 75-88). Given a more limited meaning, yoga refers to union with one's chosen divinity; one may note in this respect the terms samiihitayoga, 'concentrated yoga', and nirantara-yoga, 'continuous yoga' (p. 89 fn.).

I have also noted the existence of the three other similar manuscripts obtained by Brian Hodgson, two of which are in the Bibliotheque Nationale and one in the Royal Asiatic Society, London. Of the last of these I have made some use. The Tibetan translation in the Kanjur and the translations of early Indian commen-taries preserved in the Tenjur were my chief guides throughout. 1 I have since compared my text with an earlier Sanskrit manuscript (about fifteenth century) in the private library of KaisherShamsher in Kathmandu. Of the early commentaries a fine Sanskrit manuscript of the Yogaratna-miilii by Kal).ha is preserved in Cambridge. Of the 70 folios only two, 29 and 30, are missing. It is written on palm-leaf in an old Bengali script and dated the 39th year of King Govindapala. This king seems to have been the last of the Pala dynasty and ruled in the second half of the twelfth century. In the Bir Library in Kathmandu there is another incomplete manuscript of 26 folios. It has been possible by means of this to supply most of the missing section of the Cambridge MS. Other small omissions and the few errors of the Cambridge MS. have been made good by means of the Tibetan Translation (Narthang Tenjur rgyud, xvi, ff. 1-73). Field-Marshal Kaisher Shamsher kindly allowed me the free use of his library and I have since found there incomplete palm-leaf manuscripts of the commentaries of Saroruha and Vairocana, which are quoted in my notes from the Tibetan translations. There is a second and fuller manu-script of Vairocana's commentary in the Bir Library (formerly known as the Durbar Library), but permission to photograph it was refused. For this work of mine I have relied upon the Tibetan translations of the com-mentaries except in the case of the Yogaratnamiilii; in any case it would be impracticable to make running references to fragmentary unpublished texts. Also in the Field-Marshal's library there is one other commentary, the Hevajrapaiijikii by Sri-Kamalanath, complete in 23 folios. This work does not seem to have been translated into Tibetan, for it is missing from the Tenjur. Nor does this Kamala or Kamalanath appear to be known in Tibetan tradition. There is a prima facie case for identifying him with 1 I have used the Narthang edition, controlling the occasional scribal errors on the blocks with the invaluable assistance of the Peking edition, reprinted under the supervision of Otani University, Kyoto and published in 1955 by the Tibetan Tripitika Research Institute. See The Tibetan Tripitika, ed. D. T. Suzuki, Vol. I, Tokyo-Kyoto, 1955, pp. 210-223. On the very rare occasions where there is any doubt of the correct reading, I have quoted both versions, Narthang (N) and Peking (P). vii"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"NOTE ON THE TEXTS Kampala, who is named with Saroruha as an originator of the Hevajra-tantra (see Part I, p. 12), for we would expect him to have produced a commentary. This short work might well have been included in this edition, had it been found in time. The Chinese version of the tantra (Taisho edition no. 892) appears to be based on the same Sanskrit original as the Tibetan, but the translator clearly found difficulty in rendering the more obscure parts as intelligible Chinese. Thus this version, rather than assisting towards a better under-standing of the Sanskrit, would seem to provide new material for a study of its own. I have appealed to it on one or two occasions, but its testimony is really rendered superfluous by the far greater number of reliable Tibetan readings. In mentioning the texts, I take the opportunity to thank Professor John Brough, who assisted me much with the reading of the manuscripts and provided me with many helpful ideas, and Professor Walter Simon, who assisted me with the Chinese version. Nor would I fail to mention those Tibetan translators of long ago, without whose labours we should be able to make little advance in Buddhist studies. Every one of their texts is an extraordinary linguistic feat, for no other translators have ever succeeded in reproducing an original with such painstaking accuracy. Relying upon them alone, there is no reason why the exact contents of any Buddhist text should not become known to us. A Tibetan translation of a text and a com-mentary, let alone five commentaries or more, is of far more value for understanding a work than a Sanskrit manuscript alone. It is on these translations that I have largely relied. When one is confronted with the task of providing a satisfactory transla-tion of a hitherto unedited Sanskrit work, the normal course of procedure should be first to establish a reliable text by a careful collation of the avail-able manuscripts, and then to interpret this direct in accordance with the accepted rules of grammar and syntax. Guidance may be sought from secondary versions, either translations or commentaries, but such help one would expect to be of a subsidiary nature, for the original text should always be the chief authority. Such a statement of method might seem quite superfluous, were it not for the fact that it has been found necessary in dealing with the present text to dispense with the orthodox and logical method of procedure, and reverse the whole process in a manner that at first might seem unreliable and dangerous. Indeed it must be confessed that the general method has been to first ascertain the intended sense of the text and then edit the manuscripts accordingly. The one excuse for this method is that this is the most certain method of procedure, when one is dealing with manuscripts so manifestly rife with error as are the available manuscripts of the Hevajra-tantra. Nor on second thoughts should such viii"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"NOTE ON THE TEXTS a method seem necessarily unreliable, where the primary concern is to learn the contents of the work and establish its relationship to a general cultural background. For this can still be done, even though the actual text may remain imperfect. For ascertaining the intended sense of the text the most reliable version is the Tibetan translation. This reproduces the original text at a far earlier stage than the nineteenth-century Nepalese MSS. The passages in apa-bhralJlsa, for example, are transliterated as such, while in the manuscripts they appear partly sanskritized, and there are several instances where the sense suggested by the Tibetan is to be preferred in spite of the contra-dictory evidence of the manuscripts. Likewise the many commentaries, which with the exception of the Yogaratnamiilii are quoted from the Tibetan, refer to versions of the text as known from the ninth to eleventh centuries, and so they, too, in any matter of doubt must be given prece-dence over the extant manuscripts. In fact these two powerful aids, Tibetan translation and commentarial works, are in themselves sufficient to provide us with a satisfactory translation of the whole work, while the manuscripts taken alone are not. It would seem reasonable therefore, that the actual editing of the Sanskrit text should follow rather than precede our under-standing of it. In final justification of this method it remains necessary to illustrate just how these manuscripts should be so unreliable. In order that a text should serve as a reliable guide, it is necessary that the editor should first be able to edit with some consistency, and in order to do this he must feel confident that the original text which he is attempt-ing to restore was a correct text, that scansion, grammar, and syntax were originally regular. In a choice between several readings he would then logically choose the one that was correct and in restoring corrupt passages he would pay full regard to regular scansion. But in the case of the Hevajra-tantra there can be no such confidence. More than a hundred lines are quite irregular, and although they clearly represent slokas of a kind, it is impossible to see how many of them can ever have been anything but irregular. Thus where there is a choice of reading, the original one is by no means necessarily the one that would permit correct scansion. Likewise, in the case of grammar and syntax, there seems to be complete carelessness in the matter of endings and irregularities of a kind that would be in-sufficiently explained by the ignorance of scribes. They have certainly added to the confusion, as may be seen by a comparison of the extant manuscripts, but their distortions are of a kind that can only suggest error based upon error. Since this is so, it is clearly impossible to hope to provide a satisfactory edition of such a text. One's aim, of course, should be to produce a version as close to the original as possible, but there is a great difference between attempting to restore an originally perfect text and an ix"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"NOTE ON THE TEXTS originally imperfect text, for in the latter case we are deprived of the chief measure of success, namely the correctness of the restored version. In our case therefore we have had to be content with the next best thing, namely a text that accords with the required sense as it may be ascertained from the Tibetan translation and the several commentaries. We may then accept the irregularities of scansion, when it seems that they could not be otherwise, and the irregularities of grammar, in so far. as they do not render impossible the required sense. Such is the principle I have tried to follow, but it is a principle that is inevitably inconsistent in application, for another might well insist that many of the irregularities retained still render im-possible any satisfactory translation. Some of these, however, occur with sufficient regularity to warrant their acceptance, some just cannot be other-wise, while some, which are altogether absurd, have been tentatively corrected. Thus for mere example the form -riipit;a1[l appears as neuter nominative (II. iv. 40, 55; vii. 8) and is attested in all manuscripts. iikrti (II. iii. 4) is treated as neuter and this false attribution of gender is confirmed by three neuter forms in the same line. The mixture of nominatives and instrumentals (II. iii. 54) is attested by all manuscripts and should clearly be allowed to remain, as they have every appearance of being original. Barbarities of this kind are fundamental to the text, as is also the con-tinual mixing of the endings -1} and -1[l. In editing, one can but choose whichever seems the more correct of the two, but those who once recited this work do not seem to have bothered, while the scribes often write both the visarga· and the anusviira. But there are cases where some deliberate alteration of the text is neces-sary in spite of the manuscripts' unanimity in error. Thus they all have: sabdas ca ..• lak~ayet and one must make an obvious correction to sabdafi ca (II. iv. 14). They all confirm the reading tarjayanta1JZ suriisuriin (II. v. 27), but the required sense can be gained only by correcting to tarjayafi ca .•.. They all read: tatra madhye 'ham vidyiit (II. v. 7), and one corrects to: . . • vidyate, wondering meanwhile whether one should improve still further with ... vidyeya. Elsewhere we may reject all the alternatives offered, and supply the logically correct form. Thus instead of devati I devati I devati1JZ we have written devatlr (II. iv. 66), and katha1JZ instead of katama1Jl (II. vii. I). Some corrections have been more bold, and while they seem necessary if the required sense is to be made clear, there can be no guarantee what-soever that they represent the original text. See I. v. 6; vi. 9; II. v. 70. Where the metre can be easily regularized this has normally been done,"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"NOTE ON THE TEXTS but in some cases I have amended the text against the metre, e.g. I. vii. 9; II. vi. 6; ix. 7· Such irregularity is probably inherent (cp. I. vi. 24). The language need not be graced by the term Buddhist Sanskrit. It is just bad Sanskrit. The only special grammatical form worthy of note is the 3rd sing. opt. karet. The form of the gerund, normally reserved for compound verbs, is used with several simple verbs: vadya, grhya, pujya. There are six cases of double sandhi. The manuscripts themselves have no special features. Consonants are regularly doubled after -r-, but in our edition they are given as single. Square brackets [ ] have been used to indicate the desirability of omitting a word or passage which is nevertheless attested by all manuscripts, or which has some other claim to consideration as an original reading. Pointed brackets ( ) indicate the desirability ofinserting a word or passage, usually for metrical reasons, for which no authority can be quoted from the manu-scripts, Tibetan version or the commentaries. The critical apparatus does not show all the variant readings, so very many of which, especially in the case of B, are useless scribal blunders. A number of absurdities are, how-ever, quoted as illustration of the nature of these manuscripts.

[Some word is required where marked *.] In the Sanskrit version tau may refer to the two things, one inscribed, one pierced, or the idea of a pair may be taken erroneously from the previous hate-causing ritual. Some confusion is likely for the commentators are not in agreement. According to V (XV. 38b 7-39a 2) the functions of these goddesses are: Vajra-stambhana N airatmya--vidve~a1Ja Gauri--vaiya Bhucari-iikar~a1Ja Variyogini-siinti Khecari-miira7Ja Vajraqakini-ucciitana But his list is suspect, for siinti is out of place amidst a set of harmful rites and a comparison with the main text, I. ii. 12-18, will show that abhiciiruka is missing. This is the one rite that K leaves unnamed and where we have the difficulty of establishing a sure reading. Taking the mystic syllables as the basis of identification, we find the rest of K's list cor-rect as against that of the main text: Vajra Gauri Variyogini V aj raQ.akini Nairatmya Khecari Bhucari Hfnyr KHAJ.Yl JRIJ.Y( BUJ.Yl HUJ.Yl GHUI;f II2 stambhana vasya ucciitana vidve~mJa abhiciiruka iikar~a1Ja miira7Ja"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"YOGARATNAMALA I. ii (34), iii (1-2) Hihyr PHAT kuryat I tathaiva svabijena parinif?pannatp. savarii<;lharp.1 Khe-carim vibhavya piirvasevarp. krtva vayvagnimal)<;lalopari sadhyam vihvalarp. dhyatva hrdbijad raktavar.J)arasmijvalarp. niscarya sadhyaya dakf?il)ana-saputena pravesya hrdayarp. viddhva vamanasaputena ni!;lkasya hrdbije anaya svasavayuna akarf?ayan mantrarp. japet · niyatam akar~ayati 11 tathaiva [13al13a 5] svabijaniryatabhiicariyogarp. nilanibharp. dhyatva piirvasevatp. kp:va GHUJ;I karak~arani~pannatp. jvaladvajrarp. sadhyasya-dhomukharp. katidese nikhanyamanarp. dhyatva mantrarp. japet I OJ.YI GHUJ;I BHUCARI AMUKAJ.YI MARAYA HUJ.YI HUJ.YI HUJ.YI PHAT niyatarp. marayati II iti Yogaratnamalayarp.
