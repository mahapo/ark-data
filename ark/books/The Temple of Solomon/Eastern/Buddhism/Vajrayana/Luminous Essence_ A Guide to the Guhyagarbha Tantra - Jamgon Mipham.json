Th rough their persistent eff orts, working in small teams, they made books available to Tibetans that allowed a deep understanding of the Buddha’s teachings to take root in Tibet. It was this understanding that later found expression in the many books composed by Tibetan authors. Th erefore, it gives me great pleasure to know that there are groups of experienced translators today, similar to those of the past, such as the Dharmachakra Translation Committee, who are working steadily to translate Buddhist books from Tibetan into English and other Western lan-guages. Undoubtedly these will make an invaluable contribution to a deep and lasting understanding of the Buddhist tradition.One of the most accomplished scholars and prolifi c writers of recent times in Tibet was Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche. An eclectic master, who was prom-inent in the nonsectarian movement that fl ourished, particularly in East-ern Tibet, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, his works are regarded as authoritative.I am pleased to know that great care has been taken in preparing this trans-lation of Luminous Essence, Mipham Rinpoche’s commentary on the Guhya-garbha Tantra, the root tantra which reveals mind and wisdom to be naturally manifest. It is inspiring to know that the project has received the blessing and guidance of such eminent contemporary masters as Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and Trulshik Rinpoche, who have also showed great kindness as teachers to me.I have no doubt that interested and initiated practitioners of the Guhya-garbha Tantra cycle of practices will derive great benefi t from reading and relying on this explanatory text.

Mipham Rinpoche’s eloquent and profound treatise is a general commentary on the meaning of the famed Tantra of the Secret Essence, the Guhyagarbha-tantra, which reveals mind and wisdom to be self-display. When studying a pro-found text such as this, it is imperative to proceed in an authentic manner with the blessing of the lineage. In the case of the tantric scriptures, this means to receive the appropriate empowerments, reading transmissions, and oral explanations of the text from a qualifi ed lineage master. Simply reading the text on one’s own will not facilitate a genuine understanding of either the words or their meaning.For this reason, it is crucial to fi rst seek out a genuine master of the lineage who possesses both experience and realization based on the view of insepa-rable purity and equality. From such a master one must receive the ripening empowerments, the supportive reading transmission, and the liberating oral instructions. Finally, having received the complete transmission of the text, one must be diligent in putting it into practice and so liberate oneself into the fruition of the Great Perfection.In order to serve the community of practitioners, the Dharmachakra Translation Committee has now prepared an English translation of Mipham Rinpoche’s Luminous Essence, which lays out the fundamental framework for tantric theory and practice. Th e encouragement to propagate this text I received in particular from Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Th e translation has been produced with the kind help of several accomplished teachers, headed by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche, who most kindly conferred the empowerments for the Tantra of the Secret Essence upon the team of translators.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd ixLumnous Essence_Final.indd ix3/11/09 3:42:46 PM3/11/09 3:42:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x luminous essenceMay all merit in producing this text become the cause of happiness and awakening for all beings.Chökyi Nyima RinpochePresident, Dharmachakra Translation CommitteeLumnous Essence_Final.indd xLumnous Essence_Final.indd x3/11/09 3:42:46 PM3/11/09 3:42:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"◆• Translators’ Introduction •◆The present translation of Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche’s Lumi-nous Essence has been produced as a group project involving sev-eral translators who based their eff orts on the oral instructions of several expert teachers. In particular, the translation relied on the explanations of Khenpo Sherab Sangpo, who taught the complete text at Ka-Nying She-drub Ling Monastery in Boudhanath during the summer months of 2005. In addition, the translation benefi ted greatly from the additional teachings of Khenpo Sherab Dorje, Khenpo Tsültrim Lodrö, Khenpo Kātyāyana, and Tulku Nyima Gyeltsen. For the translation of the root verses of the Ta n t r a of the Secret Essence, the translation primarily relies on Longchenpa’s famed commentary in his Dispelling the Darkness of the Ten Directions, as well as Khenpo Shenga’s interlinear commentary. Th e translation was produced by Th omas Doctor, Heidi Köppl, Douglas Duckworth, Andreas Doctor, and Cortland Dahl. Th e various translations were compiled and checked against the original Tibetan by Andreas Doctor before fi nally being edited by Cor-tland Dahl.Traditionally, tantric teachings such as these have been kept secret from the general public since the profound nature of their contents makes them likely to be misunderstood. However, based on the personal advice and pub-lic statements made by several senior masters, it appears that the benefi t of keeping tantric teachings secret is now outweighed by the danger of not mak-ing genuine teachings available in a time when tantric teachings of dubious origin proliferate in print and on the internet. Th is view is also one that His Holiness the Dalai Lama has expressed on several occasions. For example, in his introduction to Tantra in Tibet (1987, Snow Lion Publications) His Holiness says: “In general, translating a book of Mantra for sale in shops is unsuitable, but at this time and in this situation there is greater fault in not clearing away wrong ideas than there is in distributing translations. Much Lumnous Essence_Final.indd xiLumnous Essence_Final.indd xi3/11/09 3:42:46 PM3/11/09 3:42:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xii l uminous essencefalsely ascribed information about Secret Mantra has wide repute nowadays, and therefore, I think that translating and distributing authoritative books may help to clear away false superimpositions.”It is with this advice in mind that the present translation is now being published by Snow Lion Publications. However, the fact that the transla-tion is being distributed publically should not lessen the importance of the advice given by all traditional authorities on tantric thought and practice: to fully understand the message contained in the profound tantric scriptures, it is essential to receive the appropriate empowerments, reading transmis-sions, and oral instructions before fi nally putting the teaching into practice through meditation. To refl ect the necessity of relying on a living master to clear away questions and doubts regarding the topics discussed in texts such as this, we have presented the translation without an introductory discourse or any form of annotation. It is hoped that this will prompt the reader to seek out a genuine master who can transmit the teaching in its entirety so that the great tantric wisdom traditions of India and Tibet may gain a solid footing as they spread to new regions of the world.Th e translators wish to express their profound gratitude to Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche and all other learned and accomplished teachers, who with wis-dom and compassion guided our feeble eff orts to convey the beauty and profundity of Lama Mipham’s sacred words into English. We also wish to humbly convey our thanks to His Holiness the Dalai Lama for blessing this publication in his foreword. Th e entire translation process has enjoyed the kind support of the Tsadra Foundation in the form of a generous grant for which we are most thankful. We also wish to thank Snow Lion Publications for publishing this text and for their eff orts in bringing Buddhism to the Western world.We sincerely regret and apologize for any errors and mistakes this transla-tion may contain. Th ey are exclusively ours, caused by our superfi cial under-standing of the profound nature of Mantra. Whatever goodness may come from the translation, we dedicate it to the benefi t and happiness of all sen-tient beings.On behalf of the team of translators, Andreas DoctorLumnous Essence_Final.indd xiiLumnous Essence_Final.indd xii3/11/09 3:42:46 PM3/11/09 3:42:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"◆• Luminous Essence •◆An Overview of the Commentary on the Secret Essence Entitled Dis pell ing th e Darkness of th e Ten Direct ionsNamo gurumañjughoṣāya!Th e radiance of spontaneously present awareness, Inseparable from the inner basic space of primordial purity and simplicity, Th e wisdom body, free from aging and decay – Youthful Mañjuśrī, please bestow auspiciousness!Within the basic space of the ground, the equality of all phenomena,You have perfected the strength of reveling in the self-manifest three bodies—Immaculate and primordial protector Longchenpa,Drime Özer, give me strength!Lion of Speech, the fi re of your reasoningScorched the entire thicket of mistaken teachings in this world.You who discovered the gentle and glorious body of nectar,Rongzom Chökyi Sangpo, may you be victorious!Masters and knowledge holders of the mind, symbolic and oral transmissions,Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 13/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 luminous essenceYidam deities assuming appearances of peace, passion and wrath, Ḍākinīs of the three places, and hosts of the three classes of haughty spirits—Infi nite deities of the three roots, homage and veneration to you!Th e lion’s roar of the supreme vehicle—Appearance and existence primordially the great bliss of purity and equality—Te r r i fi es the herds of deer that teach falsely throughout the three worlds.Th e vital points in the meaning of the profound and vast vajra tantras,Of the early translations of secret mantra, with their six-fold greatness,I shall here explain in a concise overview of the essence, An excellent teaching that vanquishes the darkness of the ten directions, With the expansive light of the sun and moon.Th e Great Tantra of the Glorious Magical Net, the Secret Essence, Reality Ascer-tained reveals mind and wisdom to be self-display. Th e explanation of this tantra contains two sections: (1) the magnifi cence of the tantra that is being taught and (2) an explanation of its meaning.1. THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE TANTRATh is universal tantra of the great Magical Net is a secret among secrets. It clar-ifi es the key points of the intent of the ocean-like mantra tantras of the vajra vehicle. In a general statement, the Tantra of the Heart Mirror of Vajrasattva declares:Th e development of mahāyoga is like the ground of all doctrines.Th e completion of anuyoga is like the path of all doctrines.Th e great perfection of atiyoga is like the fruition of all doctrines.Accordingly, mahāyoga teaches the complete nature of the ground, path, and fruition of the entire mantra vehicle. It is, therefore, essential to develop cer-tainty regarding all aspects of mantra practice based on mahāyoga. Mahāyoga belongs to the inner tantras of secret mantra, and can itself be divided into an Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 2Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 23/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"luminous essence 3infi nite number of categories. Th ese all come about through the play of wis-dom of the magical net. Th e latter, moreover, possesses an infi nite number of practices related to deity, mantra, and meditative absorption, each of which is designed to suit the constitutions, capacities, and wishes of those in need of training. For this reason, it is impossible to fathom the full extent of these practices. From the perspective of their essence, however, they can be divided into two categories: (1) the vast tantras of the common variety and (2) the profound tantras of the extraordinary essence. As for the former, all the infi nite categories of tantra can, generally speak-ing, be included in six classes of tantra: the fi ve classes of enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity, plus their indivisibility, the class of the universal master heruka, also known as the class of the sixth, the vajra holder. In terms of what they express, these tantras can also be divided into those that primarily teach the aspect of means, those that primarily teach the aspect of knowledge, and those that emphasize the wisdom of nondual means and knowledge. Respectively, these three approaches are the father, mother, and nondual tantras. Th ese three classes are exemplifi ed by the Gathering of Secrets, which clearly teaches the illusory body; the Wheel of Supreme Bliss, which primarily teaches luminosity; and the Wheel of Time, which emphasizes the wisdom of unity. Because the Wheel of Time emphasizes that which is to be revealed, the ultimate wisdom of unity itself, it is known as “the androg y-nous stage of Vajrasattva.” In this way, it is classifi ed as a nondual tantra. Th is is also the reasoning behind the subdivisions of the Nyingma School’s man-tra scriptures, such as the classifi cation of mahāyoga into three parts, starting with the mahā of mahā. Secondly, the profound and extraordinary tantras are divided into the vast Tantra Section and the profound Sādhana Section. Th e Tantra Section con-sists of the renowned “Eighteen Great Tantras.” Th e basis or essence of all of these is the Tantra of the Secret Essence. Why are these tantras extraordinary and profound? It is because these tantras are the avenue whereby one may arrive at the unmistaken realization of the central points of the intent of all the inner tantra sections of secret mantra. Th e entirety of the unsurpassable mantra is alike in that one is fi rst ripened by the four empowerments and then applies the key points of the path of the two stages. Nevertheless, most other tantras tend to teach the practices of deity and mantra alone, as well as the methods for applying the key points concerning the channels, ener-gies, and essences in the completion stage. Moreover, all of these key points Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 3Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 33/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 luminous essenceare subsumed in the view of the great purity and equality of appearance and existence, and in the explicit introduction to the ultimate wisdom that is to be revealed. While this remains concealed in vajra statements elsewhere, in these tantras it is taught explicitly. In the Wheel of Time, for example, the key points hidden by the Vajra Possessor within vajra statements are taught clearly. For this reason, that tantra is known as “the open jewel casket of the buddhas.” Also, while the wisdom of the fourth empowerment is the core of the path of the vajra vehicle, other tantras describe it with statements such as, “the fourth is also like that.” Th us, they do not teach it explicitly, but simply leave it as something to be induced by the third empowerment. Because of this, many Indians who taught the key points of the tantras identifi ed the wis-dom of the fourth empowerment merely as the blissful sensation of union, the mind free from attachment, or the intellectual understanding of empti-ness, and so forth. Th ese notions have been clearly refuted in certain treatises, such as the commentary on the Sevenfold Union and Indrabhūti’s Accomplish-ment of Wisdom. Th ese days, there is abundant delusion here in the Cool Abode as well. For example, there are some who denigrate the pith instructions that point out the wisdom of the fourth empowerment, who assert the recent convergence of a blissful feeling and the notion of emptiness to be the co-emergent, and so forth. Considering all this, one must apply the teachings of the Wheel of Time universally when approaching the key points of the collected tantras. Th is is a genuine pith instruction. Th e elucidations of the Wheel of Time and its commentary, the Accomplishment of Wisdom, are of exceptional clarity. Th ey deal with topics such as the nondual wisdom-body of immutable bliss and emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects, the ultimate co-emergent to be revealed, and the sky-like Vajra Possessor beyond the phenomena of matter and mind, yet pervading all of space.It is said that tantras must be understood based on other tantras, and this great Tantra of the Secret Essence reveals all the key points concerning the view and meditation of the unsurpassable mantra; nothing is kept hidden. It also establishes the intended meaning of the entire vajra vehicle. For this reason, it is the single jewel of the three worlds, the king of all tantras, the pinnacle of all vehicles, the source of all teachings, the universal explanation of all scrip-ture, the great highway of all the buddhas, and the sacred heart of the intent of all thus-gone ones. Its magnifi cent qualities are amazing.

In accordance with peoples’ individual mental capacities, they are treated as conceptual issues meant for logicians. Knowing such texts to be devoid of the essential points, like a dead, lifeless corpse, fortunate individuals with a supreme aspiration toward the vajra vehi-cle will do well in wholeheartedly pursuing the study and teaching of a tantra such as this, doing so without concern for their own body or life.2. THE MEANING OF THE TANTRARegarding the explanation of the tantra’s meaning , there are two great char-iot traditions: (1) the vast, common explanatory tradition and (2) the pro-found, uncommon explanatory tradition. Th e fi rst is the wondrous approach of the glorious Zur, the king of all knowledge mantra holders, which explains the tantra according to mahāyoga’s own scriptural tradition. Th e second rep-resents the unsurpassable intent of the two lions of speech, Rongzom and Longchenpa. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence is the ati of mahā, which is the same as the mahā of ati in terms of the three divisions of the great perfection. In this way, the secret great perfection can be explained in three ways: (1) by reveal-ing indivisible development and completion as the self-displayed maṇḍala of mind and wisdom; (2) through pointing out how mind in essence is the nature of primordial enlightenment, independent of development and com-pletion; and (3) by showing that wisdom is the nature of enlightenment as the essence of self-display. Here the explanation will be given in terms of the fi rst of these three. While the aforementioned two explanatory traditions are of the same taste concerning their realization of the fi nal key points, the explanation given here will follow the latter tradition, which possesses the essential points of profound pith instructions. Th ere are three parts to this explanation: (1) an explanation of the meaning of the text’s title, which is one way to realize its subject matter; (2) an explanation that summarizes the essential points of the meaning of this subject matter; and (3) an extensive explanation of the mean-ing expressed through the words of the tantra.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 5Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 53/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 luminous essence1. Th e Ti t l eA title engenders understanding in those of the sharpest faculties, just as the word “vase” elicits an awareness of a bulbous object. Th us, in realizing the meaning of its title, such individuals will also comprehend the meaning of the tantra itself, which teaches how all phenomena are primordially the maṇḍala of buddhahood. Let us begin, therefore, by explaining the mean-ing of the title.Generally, the Sanskrit word “tantra” is translated as “continuum.” In this way, tantra refers to the continued presence of statements and meanings that reveal the relationship between deities, mantras, and meditative absorption, the various means for actualizing the supreme and common accomplishments that are sought aft er. In particular, the Secret Essence—Reality Ascertained can be explained as follows. All phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are insepara-ble with the enlightened state; they dwell primordially as the eternal wheel of adornment of enlightened body, speech, and mind. Th is is what is meant by the term secret. It is referred to as such because those who are obscured and unfi t to receive these teachings do not realize this, although it is genuinely realized by the profound wisdom mind of the victorious ones. It is secret in the sense that the three bodies go unrecognized due to the veils of temporary obscurations, though they are present within. Moreover, the profound views that reveal this presence are not known through one’s own power, nor are they pointed out by another, and, even if they are, they are hard to realize. In this way, they are hidden. Furthermore, unless this special view, meditation, and conduct are concealed from those who are unfi t to receive these teach-ings, the seal of secrecy will be broken and they will be misconstrued. Th ere-fore, it is not taught to such individuals and must be concealed. In this way, it is secret, both in the sense of being unseen and concealed.Th e term essence refers to the fi nal, actual way of all phenomena—primor-dial enlightenment as the embodiment of the eternal wheel of adornment of enlightened body, speech, and mind. Th is is the equality of the great perfec-tion, along with the profound and vast expressions of that state. It is referred to as the essence because it is the ground, the extract, and the quintessence of all phenomena. Th e term reality refers to the very nature of the three bodies, which are beyond meeting and parting. Th is nature pervades all entities and is the sole identity of everything. It is the reality of the natural state. It is unmistaken Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 6Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 63/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"luminous essence 7and, hence, undeceiving. Th ese words also indicate that this natural condi-tion always remains just as it is, without any degeneration or change. Th e term ascertained implies that the meaning of this teaching is not an expedient one meant for new students. Rather, it is the fi nal meaning ; it is revealed to fortunate disciples exactly as it is, just as it has dawned in the minds of the thus-gone ones themselves. Hence, this word shows that this is the defi nitive, or fi nal, meaning.In this way, it should be understood that these four components of the title all illustrate the meaning of the purity and equality of primordial enlighten-ment. Th ey are all various perspectives on its qualities. Alternatively, one may also say that the primordial buddhahood of all phenomena is the ground, the secret essence. Th e experiential integration of that through the indivisible development and completion stages is the path, reality. Th e culmination of the path is the spontaneous presence of the three bodies. Th is is the fruition, ascertained within the ground.One may also consider the four components of the title in a general man-ner, in terms of what these words refer to. From this perspective, the meaning they express concerns the ground, path, and fruition. Th e expressions used to communicate this meaning consist of the appearance of verbal language and audible language, with the former functioning as the cause of the latter. Th is also includes the symbolic representations of these sounds that are contained in books. All of the words in the title are explicable to the same extent as they are applicable. Th e explanation and application of their words are applied in equal measure to all of the terms in the title.2. A Summary of the Essential Points of the Meaning of the Text’s Subject MatterTh is section includes: (1) an explanation of the tantra’s purpose and rele-vance, which are points of access for wise individuals, and (2) the presenta-tion of the meaning of the tantra that has this purpose.1. Th e Purpose and Relevance of the TantraTh ose who are skilled in discerning between what to do and what to avoid may wonder, “What is the subject matter of this tantra? How is it articulated? What is the purpose of understanding this subject matter?” Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 7Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 73/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8 luminous essenceIn response, those who can discern the relevance of this meaning should be taught the following : Th e subject matter of this tantra is the maṇḍala of the ground, the ulti-mate natural state of all phenomena, which is primordially of an enlightened nature within great purity and equality. Moreover, the tantra also shows the path, the various means that allow one to actualize this ground either directly or indirectly. Finally, the tantra reveals the maṇḍala of the fruition—perfect, total purity. In short, the tantra teaches the profound realization of mantra, as subsumed within ground, path, and fruition.Th e text consists of the various words, sentences, and syllables that make up the twenty-two chapters of the root tantra and fully reveal their signifi -cance. Th eir identity is inseparable from the enlightened body, speech, and mind of all the thus-gone ones. Th ey are the self-displayed play of the lord of the maṇḍala’s wisdom, arising in the form of secret vajra statements. In the self-displayed Unexcelled Realm, they are spoken eff ortlessly by way of awareness and convey the meaning of self-displayed wisdom to a retinue that is not diff erent from the teacher himself. Th e tantra is also taught in the mere perception of others through the power of the buddhas’ blessings and the disciples’ virtue. As the fi nal, defi n-itive meaning, not an expedient method, it then serves to establish others in noble wisdom. Th us, when the words of this tantra of the supreme secret appear to the mind as general expressions, it is “the tantra which appears as language.” Correspondingly, as one gives rise to a wish to speak, the breath is stirred. Th en, the conditioning factors of the locations and instruments of language can be employed, resulting in speech. Th is is “the tantra of audible language.” Th e supports or symbols for its expression are the external appear-ance of the syllables that are entered in books. Th is, then, is “the tantra in the form of symbols.” Th e continuum refers to the subject matter, the setting and so forth, being connected in terms of cause, condition, and eff ect, as well as this meaning being perfectly elucidated through its intimate connection with the stream of names, words, and letters of the text. Th e purpose of the tantra is to facilitate the comprehension of the natures of the three actual continua that are represented by the continuum of sylla-bles used in communication. When, as the mingling of word and meaning, an object universal occurs as an object to the mind, it is conceived of as if it Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 8Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 83/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"luminous essence 9were the specifi cally characterized. In this way, the symbol is joined with its referent and a convention is established. Th is is the case with all words.Th e essential purpose of the tantra is to actualize the supreme and common accomplishments by realizing the meaning of its subject matter. Th is essential purpose depends upon the purpose, while the purpose depends upon realiz-ing the subject matter, and realizing this meaning depends upon the words themselves. Th erefore, the subject matter and the words are that which is to be known and the means for knowing it, respectively. Likewise, the words and the purpose are the method and its result, respectively. Th e purpose and the essential purpose stand in a causal relationship. Finally, the essential pur-pose and the subject matter are in a relationship of single identity.Th erefore, it should be understood that this tantra serves the purpose of easily and painlessly accomplishing both temporary and ultimate objectives. Even if one does not realize its meaning, simply hearing the sound of the tan-tra, or seeing a volume of the tantra, is supremely benefi cial. As explained in the scriptures, such encounters are due to the power of extraordinary accu-mulations gathered in the past.2. Presenting the Meaning of the Tantra Th is section discusses: (1) the setting , which is the cause for the tantra’s appearance, (2) the prelude, which is the condition, (3) the meaning of the tantra that must be fully understood, which is the fruition, and (4) the full and complete entrustment, which is the conclusion. Th us, there are four top-ics, equal in number to the four vajras.1. The SettingTh e setting concerns the fi ve perfections. In the context of this great tantra, these fi ve are explained in a special manner: Th e teacher is glorious Samant-abhadra, the lord of the vajra body, speech, and mind of all thus-gone ones in the ten directions and four times. Th is teacher is taught to be complete enlightenment, the primordial nature of all phenomena. Th erefore, this is unlike a teacher that is held to be a limited form body that is part of a con-tinuum of enlightened wisdom that appears once an individual has trained on the path.

Th is vast and unconfi ned self-display is the palace of the basic space of phenomena and the maṇḍala of the essential enlightenment of all phenom-ena. It is not a confi ned realm that is located among pure and impure fi elds. Th e retinue is held to consist of self-displayed emanations of great wisdom. As such, their stream of being is not diff erent from the teacher himself, who upholds the principle of great awakening in which all defi led and undefi led phenomena are indivisible in nature. Th us, the retinue does not consist of other beings assembled through purity or faith. Th e time is the changeless state of basic space, the equality of the four times. Th is eternal wheel of adornment of enlightened body, speech, and mind is eff ortlessly and spontaneously present as the richly arrayed ornament. It is, therefore, not a limited period divided into past, present, or future, nor is it composed of instants, moments, or otherwise.Th e tantra shows that all phenomena within saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are pri-mordially perfect, completely awakened, and inseparable as the nature of great purity and equality. Th e teaching is, therefore, not concerned with how certain causes and eff ects should be accepted or rejected. Neither does it explain the way to cultivate the causes for a buddhahood that results at a later time by relying on one’s potential, a spiritual friend, and other such factors. Th ese points can also be understood from the brief presentation of the setting, where it says, “at the time when it is thus taught.” Th e phrase “thus taught” indicates the indivisible realization of the teacher and his retinue. Likewise, there is a special reason for saying “at the time when it is” rather than “at one time it was.” In this way, the meaning of the words in the brief presentation of the set-ting should be explained by correlating them with three aspects: the outer aspect, the setting for the appearance of the tantra; the inner aspect, the array of the awakened mind; and the secret aspect, the principle of luminous wis-dom. A detailed explanation of the fi ve perfections begins with an account of how the maṇḍala of the natural and spontaneously present ground arises from the state of compassion and how the maṇḍalas of the peaceful and wrathful deities are then projected out from it. Such details can be learned from the elaborate exposition found in the commentary to the words and meaning of this vajra tantra.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 10Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 103/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"luminous essence 112. The PreludeGenerally, in a prelude the teacher will encourage by smiling , emitting light, and extending his tongue, while the retinue will facilitate a discussion of the topic in question by making gestures and requests. However, in this extraor-dinary context the prelude involves the Th us-Gone One spontaneously addressing himself in a state of wonder. Th us, he elucidates the meaning of enlightenment to himself as the primordial maṇḍala of the purity and equal-ity of all phenomena, the realization of the single sphere of enlightenment.Moreover, as the aspect of skillful methods, Samantabhadra initiates the discussion by considering the magnifi cence of enlightenment as the original purity of all phenomena, in which their essential nature is one of bodies and wisdoms. Th us, by saying, “Amazing! Th e components of the vajra aggregates . . .” he points out, in short, that the world and its contents are a vast purity. Th is purity is spontaneously present within a state beyond characteristics. Th us, Samantabhadrī, as the aspect of knowledge, initiates the discussion by considering the magnifi cence of enlightenment within the great equal-ity of the basic space of phenomena. With the statement, “Th e ten directions are empty, the realms primordially void,” she points out, in short, the great equality of appearance and existence. Th e lord and consort, as the identity of means and knowledge beyond meeting and parting, initiate the discus-sion by considering the magnifi cence of enlightenment in the manner of the great perfection, the inseparable truths of purity and equality. Th us, in say-ing, “Amazing, wonderful, wondrous dharma . . .” they reveal, in short, the natural wisdom of the inseparable two truths.Whether in the past, present, or future, no phenomenon has ever been, or will ever be, beyond this natural state. However, there are beings that fail to realize this state because they are separated from it by four secrets. For such beings, compassionate emanations manifest to teach. In this way, beings are guided by the infi nite display of the magical net in whatever way is required. Th e six capable ones manifest in correspondence to the six classes of disciples. Th ese six subsume all the various emanations. Since they harmo-nize with the constitutions, faculties, and inclinations that sentient beings possess, the various types of teaching that are given are limitless. Neverthe-less, all teachings can be subsumed and explained in terms of the principles of the fi ve vehicles, in combination with the wrathful approaches that are Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 11Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 113/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12 luminous essenceused to liberate the streams of being of negative individuals who are other-wise extremely hard to guide.3. The Meaning of the TantraTh is section includes (1) a general presentation of the principles of the three continua and (2) a specifi c explanation of the path continuum. Th e fi rst of these consists of explanations of (1) the ground continuum, (2) the path con-tinuum, and (3) the fruition continuum. 1. Th e Ground ContinuumTh e ground continuum, or causal continuum, is what one must realize. Th is discussion covers four topics: (1) pointing out the natural maṇḍala of the ground, (2) how delusion arises when that maṇḍala is not realized, (3) how there is no departure from this nature, even during delusion, and (4) how delusion is reversed.1. Th e Natural Maṇḍala of the GroundOn this topic, it is taught:Without bondage and liberation, these are the qualities Of primordial and spontaneously perfected buddhahood.As this quote states, all phenomena that comprise appearance and exis-tence are primordially pure as the maṇḍala of enlightened body, speech, and mind. Free from all characteristics, they are a great equality beyond dis-tinctions and confi nes. Th is enlightened state is known as the “natural and spontaneously present maṇḍala of the ground.” Th is is precisely what was explained in the context of the prelude. Within this essential state, no one has ever been bound and, therefore, no one is ever liberated. As it is free from all aspects of duality, it is also beyond limits and partiality. Present as the nature of the indivisible two truths, it is known as “the essential ground of the natural state.”When this ground is genuinely realized, it is nirvāṇa. When it goes unre-alized, however, it is the ground of saṃsāra. It is called “ground” because it is the nature of all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa without exception. Because it is continuously and immutably present in everyone, from sentient Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 12Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 123/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"luminous essence 13beings to buddhas, it is also called “continuum.” Th e bodies and wisdoms of the fi nal fruition manifest by virtue of actualizing the purity of this ground. For this reason, it is also termed the “causal continuum,” in consideration of the way that it manifests. It is with reference to the empty aspect of this very ground that the Mother of the Victorious Ones and other such scriptures speak of “the basic space of phenomena,” “the perfectly authentic,” and “suchness.” In acknowledgment of its appearance as bodies and wisdoms, certain sūtras, such as those that point out the essence, refer to it as “the essence of the Th us-Gone One.” Here, in the mantra vehicle of defi nitive meaning, it is referred to as “the identity of great purity and equality,” “the inseparable truths of appearance and emp-tiness,” and “the maṇḍala of the primordial ground.” A “thus-gone one” is referred to as such by virtue of having realized this ground just as it is, and who has thus gone forth, becoming of one taste with the natural state of suchness. Similarly, a “buddha” is one who has unfolded genuine wisdom regarding the meaning of the ultimate natural state. Any type of realization of this ground is termed “the path.”2. How Delusion ArisesWhen this very ground is not realized exactly as it is, it becomes polluted by temporary delusion. Th ereby, the ground is experienced and conceived of in a mistaken way. Th is is known as the “constructed ground of delusion” and “impure appearance of delusion.” Although the basic space of the orig-inal ground is primordially pure in essence, by nature it is inseparable from its own spontaneously present appearances; they are a unity. It is due to this crucial fact that buddhas manifest when the natural state is realized, whereas sentient beings manifest by failing to do so.Generally speaking , what we call “mind” is something that is aware of objects. If this were not the case, delusion would be impossible, as would any realization of facts free from delusion. Th e natural disposition of the mind is to apprehend objects. It is, therefore, possible that the nature of an object may be apprehended correctly, perceiving a rope as a rope, for instance. However, if the mind is led astray by various circumstances, it may also perceive mistak-enly, such as when a rope is seen as a snake. In the same way, the self-display that appears spontaneously due to the unimpeded radiance of primordial awareness may be apprehended as objects. From this seed of dualistic delu-sion, the appearances of existence then grow forth on a vast scale. Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 13Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 133/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14 luminous essenceTh is state resembles water that has completely frozen into ice. From the perspective of someone who experiences and grasps onto all that may appear in an ordinary dualistic manner, the fact of great purity and equality is not evident. Because such a mistaken mind is in confl ict with the way of wis-dom, the reality of the nature that dwells as the ground becomes dormant and invisible. Instead, what appears is nothing but delusion.While the way that this delusion obscures the natural state can be explained in infi nite detail, it can also be summarized as the obscurations of the four states: (1) During the waking state, the cognitions of the six collections move crudely and with clarity toward their objects, apprehending various ordinary appearances. Th is obscures the nature of the emanation body, the complete purity of appearance and existence within the magical net. (2) While dream-ing, what appears is merely the energetic mind. By fi xating on the manifes-tation of these various insubstantial self-displayed experiences, one obscures the nature of the enjoyment body of self-displayed wisdom. (3) During deep sleep, the movements of the mind and mental states withdraw as one plunges into a dark state of utter oblivion. Th is obscures the nature of the noncon-ceptual dharma body. (4) At the time of immersion all coarse sensations are obliterated by the taste of bliss. Grasping and attachment within that state obscure the nature of the unifi ed essence body. Th us, wandering along in continuous delusion, one fails to see the reality of the four bodies that dwell within. Th ese delusions could not possibly occur without a cause. One may, therefore, wonder what lies at their root. In the common vehicles, they are said to be rooted in the mental state of ignorance itself. In the tantras of mantra, however, they are described to be rooted in the subtle karmic energ y that triggers dualistic perceptions in the mind. Alterna-tively, delusion is also described as the function of subtle semen, ovum, and energ y—the predisposition for transference within the three experiences. Moreover, the extremely subtle root of this energetic mind is said to appear from the primordial and unceasing self-display. As such, one should under-stand that all explanations of the ground found in the various vehicles come down to the ground of the great perfection.3. Delusion and the Natural GroundEven as these appearances unfold, there is never any straying from the real-ity of the natural ground, just as a conch may appear to be yellow, while in fact its nature remains white. In the same way, all the phenomena that com-prise appearance and existence are never beyond the nature of great purity Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 14Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 143/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"luminous essence 15and equality, regardless of whether this nature is realized or not. Th is is also expressed in the profound sūtras, which say: “Whether or not the thus-gone ones appear, the reality of all phenomena has been this way from the start.”4. Th e Reversal of DelusionJust as light overcomes darkness, these forms of delusion are reversed by the functioning of either the actual and authentic wisdom that accords with the natural state, or the special knowledge that resembles it. Let us consider the experience of a beginner. Th rough study and contemplation, one may give rise to the special view of mantra that eliminates misconceptions concern-ing the natural state of the ground. However, although ordinary grasping may have diminished in his or her perception, ordinary experiences will still remain. Th is is similar to someone who infers that a conch is white and no longer considers it to be yellow, though he or she may still see it as such.As one meditates in accordance with the meaning of the view and grad-ually becomes profi cient on the path, one’s deluded clinging to appearances will decrease, like ice melting into water, and pure vision will gradually unfold. Nevertheless, this state will still remain tainted. It is only when even the most subtle seeds of delusion have fi nally been eliminated that wisdom will be irre-versibly dominant, like ice fully melted into water. Th ese points are taught in the tantra, which proclaims: “Amazing ! From the essence of the Bliss-Gone One . . .” and “Whatever phenomena of delusion there are in the world . . .” Th ese points can also be proven through ordinary reasoning. Th e Com-mentary on Valid Cognition explains:Consciousness is a phenomenon, or a nature, that is aware of and apprehends objects. From the perspective of the subject, it is what apprehends the object exactly as it is. Moreover, considering the object, this subjective cognition is produced by the identity of exactly that which is present in the essence of the object, since that object is what the cognition apprehends. Th is is the nature, or nat-ural state, of subject and object. When that mind strays into error, it is caused by other conditions, such as the misconception of a per-manent self and so forth. Still, such deviations are not corrected by themselves. Th eir cor-rection depends on the condition of familiarity with the path that is brought forth by the valid cognitions that undermine them. Indeed, it is possible to correct this by certain conditions since Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 15Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 153/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16 luminous essencesuch deviations are adventitious and, therefore, unstable. Th us, they can be undermined by valid cognition, just as the belief of a rope being a snake can. Th is being so, the nature of mind is luminosity, in the sense that it cannot be separated from the remedial factor of accurate per-ception. Th e stains, mistaken concepts, such as the view of a self and attachment, can be separated from the natural state precisely because they are adventitious. Even before, during periods of study and contemplation, those mistaken concepts were unable to impair the vision of the authentic meaning. It should, therefore, go with-out saying that later, once the cultivation of the path is complete, they will not be able to cause any harm against the very identity, or nature, of this remedial mind. Th ey do have a slight ability to damage a mind in which habitual tendencies have not yet been exhausted. However, these mistaken concepts are unable to remain for long in that mind, which is train-ing and has the essential ability to engender in its own continuum that valid cognition which impairs such apprehension. When the continuum has been permeated by the authentic view, they are just like a fi r e that has been lit on wet ground and quickly dies out. Th e mind that is without torment in the form of suff ering and in possession of the authentic meaning cannot possibly be reversed, even through persistent error. Th is is because the mind has assumed the perspective of that reality. Hence, no valid cognition could pos-sibly reverse it.Similar explanations are to be found in other scriptures, such as the Nondual Victory Ta n t r a and the Ever-Excellent Means of Accomplishment.2. Th e Path ContinuumTh e explanation of the method that produces realization, or the path con-tinuum, covers: (1) the essence of the path, (2) its divisions, and (3) how the path is traversed.1. Th e Essence of the PathTh e essence of the path is to understand the meaning of the ground contin-uum and correctly access its meaning. By the power of such practice, all the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 16Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 163/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"luminous essence 17temporary stains of delusion will be eliminated and the natural state will be actualized. In short, this essence is the wisdom of the fi ve paths, including the retinue. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence thus states:Th e retention that is applied to the characteristics of understanding and application—Th e causes and conditions that ripen the result—Th ese capable and powerful factors Are renowned as the fi eld of the victorious knowledge holders.It is by relying on, or following, this approach that the fruition is actualized. Hence, it is called the path. Moreover, this approach is the method that actu-alizes the objective and that which produces an understanding of the ground. It also allows one to achieve the fruition via a path that unfolds in a gradual and continuous process. Hence, it is also called continuum.2. Th e Divisions of the PathTh is section includes (1) a general explanation and (2) a detailed explanation. Th e general explanation covers (1) the division of two vehicles, (2) the dem-onstration of fi ve vehicles, and (3) the presentation of nine vehicles.1. Th e Two VehiclesIn the present context, the four common vehicles of renunciation, along with the three outer tantras, are termed “the long path,” while the extraordinary vajra vehicle is known as “the shortcut to the fruition.” Th ese are the two divisions.2. Th e Five VehiclesConcerning the fi ve-fold division, it is taught: Th e defi nitive emergence of the four vehiclesIs the fruition of a single vehicle.Th us, there are fi ve vehicles: the vehicle of gods and humans, the vehicle of listeners, the vehicle of self-realized buddhas, the vehicle of bodhisattvas, and the unsurpassable vehicle of secret mantra.

Th e Vehicle of Gods and HumansAccording to the tenets of the vehicle of gods and humans, one should adhere to the authentic mundane view of trusting in the defi nite consequences of one’s actions. In this way, through practicing the ten virtues and the medita-tive absorptions of thought and form, one will be born as a human or god in the form and formless realms. 2. Th e Vehicle of the ListenersIn the tenets of the vehicle of the listeners, one must be disciplined and train in meditative absorption. Th e latter, moreover, should be in harmony with the view that correctly acknowledges the meaning of the four truths. Th ereby, one will become accustomed to the absence of the personal self and achieve the seven temporary fruitions, such as becoming a stream enterer. As the fi nal fruition, one will become a foe destroyer who has exhausted all bonds of the three realms. Th is vehicle contains two philosophical systems, those of the Proponents of Distinctions and the Sūtra Followers.3. Th e Vehicle of Self-Realized BuddhasTh e vehicle of self-realized buddhas is for those who have arrived at their fi nal existence due to the strength of their past training. Without a spiritual friend, the power of reality allows them to realize the four truths through compre-hending the profound principles of outer and inner dependent origination. In seeing the one-and-a-half-fold absence of self, they manifest as foe destroy-ers who are self-realized buddhas. Based on diff erences in the quality of their supportive faculties, and in their accumulations on the path, there are two fruitions: “those who live in groups” and “those who are rhinoceros-like.”4. Th e Vehicle of the BodhisattvasIn the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, one engenders the twofold awakened mind through the approach of the undirected ultimate and the illusory relative. One then trains in the ten perfections and gains familiarity with the mean-ing of the twofold absence of self over three incalculable eons. It is held that this allows for the accomplishment of full and complete enlightenment. Th is vehicle contains both the Middle Way and Mind Only systems. While the former sees the complete absence of self, the latter asserts the reality of non-dual self-awareness and, thus, fails to fully acknowledge the subtle absence of self of phenomena.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 18Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 183/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"luminous essence 195. Th e Vehicle of Secret MantraIn the vehicle of secret mantra, the maṇḍala of the fi nal fruition itself is taken as the path in the present by means of various special views and modes of con-duct. Th rough this method, complete buddhahood is quickly accomplished. Th ere are two divisions in secret mantra: inner mantra and outer mantra. Th e fi rst is practiced by means of considering oneself and the practiced deity to be equal and without any diff erence in terms of quality and identity. Th e sec-ond is practiced by considering oneself and the deity to be diff erent in terms of the relative, both qualitatively and in terms of identity, and receiving the blessing of the deity in one’s own stream of being. Outer mantra contains three vehicles: (1) action tantra, (2) dual tantra, and (3) practice tantra. In action tantra, oneself and the deity are considered to be ultimately indistinguishable. In terms of the relative, however, the deity is held to be the perfection of all good qualities and that which confers bless-ings, similar to a master and servant. Simply seeing things in terms of super-iority and inferiority is not what signifi es this view’s superiority. Instead, its superiority lies in the exceptional certainty that the two accomplishments are sure to be achieved in one’s own stream of being by relying on deity and mantra, just as a master is able to grant great favors to his or her servants. Moreover, this is not just a matter of knowing that the deity can grant accom-plishments. Rather, the certainty is exceptional because one becomes con-vinced that oneself and the deity are essentially indivisible in the end.Th e key point, therefore, is to develop certainty about the unity that one-self and the deity are ultimately equal, while dependent origination is unfail-ing when it comes to the relative. Subsequently, one should practice the features of the deity in a genuine manner, such as its form and mantra, as they are taught in the scriptures. With such methods, one will swift ly become enlightened as the essence of the deity, like iron turned into gold through alchemy.In this way, one lays the foundation by realizing the pure view. Th en, in harmony with the view, one exerts oneself in the practice of deity, mantra, and meditative absorption. Th e fruition is accomplished by assembling these causes and conditions. By properly observing outer ritualistic aspects, such as cleansing and purifi cation, emphasis is placed on physical and verbal conduct and great eff orts are made to please the deity. Th ereby, ordinary accomplish-ments, such as those of the knowledge holders of the desire and form realms, will be temporarily achieved through the power of the deity. Ultimately, the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 19Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 193/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"20 luminous essencestate of the bliss-gone ones of the three families will be accomplished within sixteen lifetimes.In dual tantra, the view and realization are enhanced further. Conse-quently, oneself (as the samaya being) and the deity (as the wisdom being ) are viewed as equals like siblings or friends. In harmony with this view, one then observes a conduct similar to krīya tantra and practices a meditation similar to practice tantra. In this way, one achieves the accomplishments of a buddha of the four families within seven lifetimes. Th ese are the assertions of the vehicle of ubhaya tantra, also known as dual tantra.In the vehicle of practice tantra, certainty in the unity of the two truths develops tremendously. Th rough this, one develops the view that practice can take place in terms of oneself and the deity being inseparable, like water poured into water. In accordance with that view, one no longer depends on outer actions. Rather, one sees that accomplishment is achieved exclusively through inner practice and then applies the four seals of the buddha’s body, speech, mind, and activity. By familiarization with this, buddhahood as the identity of the fi ve classes is attained within three lifetimes.In this way, the three outer tantras also take as their path the deity, whose nature is the fruitional bodies and wisdoms—the fi nal perfection of purity—manifesting in the form of attributes and mantras. As such, in this approach various means are used to carry out the deeds of the buddhas in the present moment. In this capacity, they do indeed take the fruition as the path. Th us, their methods are superior and more swift ly accomplished when compared to the path of sūtra. Next, we have the great practices of the unsurpassable vehicles of inner mantra. In these approaches, one realizes the profound view that oneself and the deity are primordially beyond meeting and parting and that all that appears and exists is pure and equal. In accordance with this view, one trains in the two profound stages and engages in actions that are free from any-thing to adopt or abandon, reveling in the pure intrinsic nature of whatever appears. It is held that this allows one to attain the identity of the four bod-ies and fi ve wisdoms, the unifi ed state beyond training, the great sixth vajra holder, in this present lifetime. Inner mantra is further divided into (1) development, (2) completion, and (3) great perfection. Development refers to mahāyoga. Here, the ultimate fruition is enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity. As this is primordially beyond meeting with, or separating from, ultimate wisdom and Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 20Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 203/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"luminous essence 21ultimate basic space, together these are known as “the essential, spontaneous presence of the seven spheres of the ultimate.” In short, basic space adorned with the bodies and wisdoms is emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects at the time of the fruition. Th is is the superior ultimate truth. As manifes-tations of this state, the appearances of the world and its inhabitants are by nature bodies and wisdoms that lack true establishment. Th is illusory wis-dom is the superior relative truth. Th us, appearance and emptiness are beyond meeting and parting in the context of both truths. Furthermore, as the two truths include the purity of the bodies and wisdoms, they are superior to the common two truths. In reality, both the appearances of the relative at the time of the ground and the path, and the appearances of the fi nal ultimate at the time of the con-summate fruition, are the indivisible essence of ground and fruition. Th is indivisibility of the two superior truths is viewed as the great dharma body. In sum, the union of basic space and the appearances of the bodies and wis-doms is the unity of appearance and emptiness. To complete the strength of meditation that accords with this state, one engages in the trainings of the three absorptions along with their auxiliary aspects. In this way, one traverses the path of the four knowledge holders and manifests enlightenment at the level of the great gathering of the wheel of syllables.Completion refers to anuyoga. In this system, it is taught that the natural maṇḍala of the ground can be manifested by applying the key points of the indwelling channels, energies, and essences of the vajra body, without relying on the path of outer elaboration and eff orts. Its essence is the maṇḍala of awakened mind, the Child of Great Bliss, which is the indivisibility of the maṇḍala of Samantabhadrī, the basic space of emptiness, and the maṇḍala of Samantabhadra, the means of bliss. To ascertain this to be the universal mas-ter of all buddha families and maṇḍalas is the view of the inseparability of bliss and emptiness. In harmony with this view, one then trains in the prac-tices related to one’s own body and the body of another, pursuing a path that emphasizes the wisdom of great bliss. Once the end of the fi ve paths has been reached, one will accomplish the unifi ed state beyond training.According to atiyoga, the nature of the natural state itself is primordial self-aware awakening. Within the state of the indivisible primordially pure essence and spontaneously present nature, the apparent expression of compas-sion manifests unceasingly. Without having to utilize methods that require eff ort, such as development and the binding of the energies, this intrinsic Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 21Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 213/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22 luminous essencenature of the three bodies is ascertained through nonaction and self-clarity, in which there is nothing to dispose of or retain. Th is is the innate view of empty awareness. In accordance with this view, one trains in the four ways of resting freely according to cutting through and the four lamps according to direct crossing. Th ereby, one perfects the path of the four visions and becomes self-liberated within primordial and spontaneously present basic space.Here, the categories of the fi ve vehicles and their subdivisions have been presented. Th e tenet systems that pertain to these vehicles can also be con-densed into fi ve. Th e fi rst of these, the correct mundane tenets, assert that the eff ects of actions do not go to waste.Second are the tenets of the vehicle of characteristics. Th is system asserts that all the outer and inner phenomena that comprise the apprehended and apprehender arise in the manner of dependent origination. Because this is misapprehended, one erroneously misconstrues a person and the like. Th is delusion, however, dissolves once one realizes that there is no personal self or self of phenomena, neither as outer apprehended object, nor as an appre-hending mind. Th is, in turn, brings about the actualization of nirvana. Since the degree of realization may vary, this vehicle is divided into three systems, those of the listeners, the Mind Only, and the Middle Way, respectively.Th ird are the tenets of the three outer tantras. Th ese teach that deluded experience and the appearances of dependent origination do indeed arise as the unfailing result of karmic actions. By relying on an abundance of means that pertain to deity and mantra, however, one will swift ly be granted free-dom from these factors and become untainted by the actions of existence and their eff ects. Fourth are the general tenets of the unsurpassable practice. Th is approach acknowledges that suff ering itself is enlightenment and that disturbing emo-tions are themselves the great wisdom of complete liberation. When training on the path subsequent to this realization, one will remain untainted by kar-mic actions and their eff ects. Fift h are the consummate tenets of the great perfection. Th is system teaches that all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are spontaneously present as great purity and equality and that they have been this way from the very beginning. Th erefore, one is primordially untainted by the fetters of ordinary actions and their eff ects, independently of any eff ort on the path. Among all the various paths, this alone is the ultimate.Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence teaches these points in the passage that Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 22Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 223/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"luminous essence 23begins, “All of these appearances of outer and inner interdependence . . .” In commenting on this passage, Rongzom and Longchenpa diff er slightly. Th e concise explanation that I have off ered here is, however, in agreement with both.3. Th e Nine VehiclesTh e liberating paths of the supramundane vehicles explained above can also be classifi ed into nine vehicles: the three vehicles that guide through renun-ciation (the vehicles of the listeners, self-realized buddhas, and bodhisattvas), the three vehicles of Vedic austerities (krīya, ubhaya, and yoga), and the three vehicles of mastery in means (mahā, anu, and ati). Th e assertion that these approaches do not involve distinct views occurs from a failure to distinguish between the view and the object of the view, and between the views of sūtra and mantra. As the subject that ascertains the inseparability of the two truths becomes increasingly sublime, one can-not deny that various views exist in terms of the relative, such as that of mas-ter and servant. If the relative subject did not entail a view, the consequence would be that a) the authentic mundane view, b) the view that realizes the features of the four truths (with the exception of emptiness and absence of self ), and c) the view that accurately ascertains conventional objects, are not views at all. No one would posit the principles of the path in such a way.It may then be argued that these are indeed views, yet, since the subject that holds them is not ultimate, these diff erences are not suffi cient to delin-eate the superiority of a particular vehicle. Nevertheless, the ascertainment of the relative develops based on the degree to which clarity in the experi-ence of the ultimate has been achieved. Th us, this is suffi cient to prove such superiority. Likewise, it may be argued that viewing deities in terms of the relative can-not be a view, since teachings on the nonexistence of buddhas and sentient beings pertain to the view, whereas teachings that speak of their existence relate to meditation. However, this is a very awkward position to maintain. What we are concerned with here is not simply the view that there is no cold on the ground where fi re burns, nor can we equate this to imagining one-self to be a lion when frightened by a dog. Instead, it is the view and medita-tion of the authentic path that allow one to relinquish the two obscurations and achieve the fi nal unchanging fruition. As such, in the present context, view and meditation must be “awareness with legs.” Meditation that lacks the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 23Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 233/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24 luminous essencecertainty of the view and views that are divorced from the practice of medi-tation are like looking east while going west. All paths that connect with the way things are and all subjective cognitions of the two truths are defi nitely preceded by the authentic view because genuine ascertainment is produced through valid cognition. Moreover, statements of existence and nonexistence are made from the perspectives of examining the conventional and the ulti-mate, respectively. Th erefore, since the consequence of the above position would be that no meditation could be concerned with the ultimate and that nothing that is conventional could be ascertained through valid cognition, this position is wholly impractical. It must, therefore, be understood that there are two types of view. One is the view that regards the subject, which is ascertained through valid cognitions that investigate the conventional. Another is the view that regards reality, which is ascertained by valid cogni-tions that investigate the ultimate.Likewise, the tradition of classifying atiyoga as wisdom but not a vehicle is a diffi cult position to maintain. Generally, both the wisdom of the path and the wisdom of the fruition are vehicles. Th is is generally acknowledged in scriptures that speak of “the vehicle in which one is transported by this cause” and “the vehicle in which one is transported within this result.” In particular, since atiyoga is the ultimate wisdom of the path of unsurpassable mantra, it is the king of all vehicles. Th e very scriptures that emphasize atiyoga, more-over, are the summit of all vehicles.In this way there are various ways of expanding or condensing the num-ber of vehicles since they are taught in consideration of the diverse mind-sets of those in need of guidance. Th us, while one may distinguish between two, three, or more vehicles, the presentation here is exhaustive. As this is the case, this tantra is a universal scripture.2. Th e Path of Unsurpassable MantraTh e specifi c explanation of the path of unsurpassable mantra includes an explanation of development and completion from the perspective of the essence and an explanation of means and liberation in terms of practice. Th e fi rst section includes discussions of both development and completion.1. Development Accessing the purity and equality of appearance and existence through con-ceptual creations and training in accord with the view that ascertains the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 24Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 243/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"luminous essence 25meaning of the natural continuum of the ground is known as “development stage practice.” It is also known in other scriptures as “the practice of infer-ence” or “the path of fabrication.” Th e development stage is practiced in fi ve levels that correspond to the stages of saṃsāric development. Th ese fi ve lev-els are great emptiness, illusory compassion, the single form, the elaborate form, and the practice of group gathering. Downwardly, this practice purifi es the habitual tendencies of cyclic existence. Upwardly, it perfects the fruition of the transcendence of suff ering. It also matures one for the practice of the completion stage. In short, with this approach training continues until one is able to create the perception that appearance and existence are an all-perva-sive purity, the wheel of the magical net. Th is perfection of the development stage is known as “the development stage of appearance and existence mani-festing as the ground.”Generally speaking , development stage practice by itself can lead to the attainment of all mundane accomplishments, up to those of the Unexcelled Realm. It will not, however, lead to the actualization of the transcendent path. Still, by perfecting this profound approach of the unity of development and completion, the perception of the true meaning will be naturally induced by the completion stage. Th ere is nothing illogical in asserting this, just as the path of sūtra is also capable of inducing a vision of the true meaning aft er a long duration. Moreover, someone who has perfected the four practices is also able to engage without diffi culty in certain advanced practices. Th is includes the approach of isolating the mind and observing the nāda in the heart center, as taught in the Gathering of Secrets, as well as utilizing the var-ious key points of the subtle essences that are taught in the diff erent classes of tantra, that is, empty forms, the wisdom seal, and the completion stage of uncontrived natural rest. Th e development stage can also be either elaborate or concise, or divided in relation to the progression of tantric ritual.2. CompletionIn the completion stage, the profound methodical pith instructions actualize the tantra of the ground, the great purity and equality that dwells within as the maṇḍala of spontaneous presence. For this reason, it is termed “comple-tion stage,” “the practice of direct perception,” and “the path of the innate.” Although the completion stage contains many divisions, they can all be condensed into two categories: (1) the application of the key points of the support (the channels, energies, and essences) through yogic exercises, vase-Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 25Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 253/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26 luminous essencebreathing, the blissful melting of the subtle essence, and so forth; and (2) the application of the key points of the supported (the essence of luminosity), such as the practice of empty forms or direct crossing. In short, various meth-ods for actualizing the wisdoms of the four vajras are taught in the tantras, including the “fi ve stages” and “six unions.” In terms of how they are practiced, all teachings, whether they are com-plete or partial, can be divided into two categories: (1) the path with charac-teristics, which is based on keeping an object in mind and applying physical and verbal eff ort and (2) the path without characteristics, which is eff ortless. In terms of what is practiced, there are three divisions: (1) luminosity, the wis-dom of the empty; (2) illusory body, the wisdom of appearance; and (3) the wisdom of the unity of these two. All completion stage practices are nothing more than ways of actualizing pure wisdom by allowing the karmic energies to dissolve into the central channel, though this may be brought about either directly or indirectly. In this tantra, the completion stage with signs is taught via the instructions on the practice of the subtle essences that relate to the four wheels, as well as the path of means, which includes both the gradual path of the upper gate and the instantaneous path of the lower gate. Th e completion stage without signs, on the other hand, is taught through the pith instructions of the lumi-nous great perfection. In this way, the path of these two stages clears away impurities, through which the natural state is actualized. However, if the natural state were not pure by nature, then the development stage would be a mental creation that confl icts with the natural state. Moreover, when certain practices, such as arresting the karmic energies within one’s ordinary body, cause the accom-plished entities to appear as deities in one’s own experience, then that would be a deluded experience. Like a magic stone appearing to be a horse or an ele-phant, this would not accord with the way things are. Such an apprehension would be an erroneous cognition. Th e same thing would then also hold for taking the fi ve poisons as the path and having a conduct free of acceptance and rejection. If this were the case, claiming such a path to be superior to the path of sūtra would be astonishing indeed!If the diff erence between sūtra and mantra lay only in skillful means and not in the view, then why would such easy and effi cacious means not be taught in the sūtras as well? One must understand that it is because the view of the spontaneous presence of cause and eff ect is absent in the causal vehicles Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 26Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 263/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"luminous essence 27that those who adhere to those vehicles are not yet ready for such methods. Th ere are some who assert that sentient beings can be forcefully transformed into buddhas through methods alone, without their understanding the state of great primordial purity and equality. Th ose who say this, however, are unable to establish the two stages as a path that accords with the way things are. Hence, one must understand that these statements severely denigrate the vehicle of mantra.2. Means and LiberationTh is section discusses the path of defi nitive means and the path of liberation through knowledge.1. Th e Path of MeansTh e Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Th is amazing , magical, wondrous dharma Does not arise from some other place.It arises within the state Of knowledge itself, supported by means.As noted here, the emphasis of this path is the forceful manifestation of one’s own inner wisdom through wondrous skillful activity. Th is, in turn, results in the swift accomplishment of the fruition, just as iron is instantly trans-formed into gold through the application of makṣika [pyrite]. First and fore-most, this involves two factors: engendering blissful wisdom through blazing and dripping in relation to the six wheels and engendering the melting bliss of unchanging wisdom through the descent, retention, reversal, and perva-sion that pertains to the union with the secret space. As a subsidiary aspect of that, this also includes the various modes of conduct that pertain to the yogic discipline of great bliss.During equipoise, when a diligent person relies on skillful means, he or she will come to experience the meaning, in various ways, that should be realized. Th is meaning is the continuum of the ground, within which the two truths are indivisible; it is a state free from thought and beyond conceptual mind. During the ensuing attainment, the power of such experiences automatically induces the certainty that all of appearance and existence are great purity and equality. Th e energies that carry thought, as well as the coarse and subtle Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 27Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 273/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28 luminous essenceelements that are its conditions, are restrained by relying on the key points of the channels. Th is process causes concepts and their mount to dissolve into the blissful and empty basic space of the dhūtī, since it is the intrinsic nature of things that the mind will be naturally bound once the moving energies have been restrained. As the constitution of the elements and channels are purifi ed, the energetic mind within the four wheels becomes workable and the knots on the central channel are untied. When that occurs, the appear-ances of wisdom gradually evolve, all the habitual tendencies for transference are reversed, and the vajra body of great bliss of the fi nal fruition is attained.2. Th e Path of LiberationTh e Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Th rough a combination of studying , contemplating , and meditating onTh e maṇḍala of perfect wisdomTh e self-occurring and all-fulfi lling are spontaneously present.As stated here, the emphasis of this path is exceptional study, contempla-tion, and meditation, which lead to a decisive insight into the spontaneously perfected great maṇḍala, in which all phenomena are primordially enlight-ened as self-occurring wisdom. By training in this insight, one traverses the path and reaches liberation within the great equality of the maṇḍala of the self-manifest bodies and wisdoms, just as stone will turn into gold when in close proximity to the kaustubha jewel.In this context there are two paths: Th e instantaneous path is for the most gift ed individuals, for whom realization and familiarization are simultane-ous. On the gradual path, the view is fi rst resolved and then, in accordance with its meaning, the strength of absorption is developed. Devoted training involves a mere meditation on general features, without having perfected absorption. Th is produces the ability to actualize the genuine path in one’s stream of being and carries the benefi t of accomplishing various temporary activities. Defi nitive perfection refers to a path where meditation is perfected in the fi ve gradual practices, such as great emptiness, as they pertain to the stages of death, the intermediate state, and birth. Based on this path, one actualizes the levels of the four knowledge holders.In this way, an intelligent person will correctly ascertain the meaning of great purity and equality through study and contemplation. First, this Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 28Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 283/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"luminous essence 29exceptional view is ascertained. Th en, in accordance with the view, one engages in the practices of equipoise and ensuing attainment that enable one to cultivate the meditative absorption of the path, whereby ordinary deluded thoughts are self-liberated. It is the nature of things that, once the thinking mind is liberated, the transference of the energ y element, which is inextri-cably intertwined with the mind, will also be liberated into the basic space of wisdom. Th us, as the thoughts of dualistic deluded appearances and their conditions are self-pacifi ed and self-liberated, the truth of the natural state will become evident and one will arrive at the fruition beyond training.Th e paths of means and liberation are classifi ed as such based on their respective emphasis of means and knowledge. Th is is not to say, however, that either of these is devoid of the other. Rather, one should understand that these two are equivalent, in the sense that both allow one to see the nature of the natural state. In the context of group practice, the merely symbolic, illustrative wisdom may arise in the stream of being of the practitioner in accordance with his or her capacity, and one may become a knowledge holder of the desire or form realms. At the very least, one will gain various forms of accomplishment since one will have connected with the unique practice of the profound means of mantra.In the case of genuine group practice on the path of defi nitive perfec-tion, the supreme accomplishment is attained and the entire gathering pro-ceeds to the levels of the knowledge holders. Th is occurs because smoke and the rest of the ten signs are complete, even when practicing the absorp-tion of great emptiness in an authentic manner. Moreover, the practitioner who has accomplished the development stage of appearance and existence as manifest ground will arrive at the luminosity of the fourfold emptiness during equipoise and emerge from that state in the divine form of the mere energetic mind. Furthermore, during the ensuing attainment, the potential for the infi nite appearances of all-pervasive purity will be perfected. Th ere-fore, at the occasion of great accomplishment during the group practice, one relies on the proximate cause of a seal and thereby actualizes the truth of reality.3. Traversing the PathIn this section, the teaching concerns the nature of the path to be traversed, the unsurpassable entrance gate to the fruition of consummate liberation. Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 29Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 293/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30 luminous essenceTh is path can be divided into the fi ve paths of unsurpassable mantra. Th e process of traversing this path is initiated by a person who possesses the most sublime, great compassion, wishing to accomplish the level of buddhahood in this very life to liberate all of the infi nite number of sentient beings with-out exception. Understanding, moreover, that the path that leads to the fi nal fruition depends exclusively on this vajra vehicle, the practitioner will thoroughly mature his or her stream of being by receiving the four ripening empowerments from a qualifi ed master. Th e next step is to correctly observe the general, particular, and additional samayas and, in accordance with the authentic view of appearance and existence as great purity and equality, train correctly on the path of the two stages. Th rough this, one will gradually com-plete the fi ve paths.To begin, one meditates in accordance with the original purity of one’s own and others’ bodies as the maṇḍala circle and settles the mind in unity with the great equality of emptiness beyond concept. Th is is the application of mindfulness to the body. Transforming concepts of sensation into the wis-dom of great bliss is the application of mindfulness to sensation. Binding all of the mind’s constructs and mental states within the innate basic space of the luminous nature of mind is the application of mindfulness to the mind. Enjoying all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—all that appears and all that is imputed—as purity and equality without accepting or rejecting is the application of mindfulness to phenomena. Th is is how they are taught in the sacred tantra of the Magical Net.Th e superiority of the great vehicle’s applications of mindfulness to those of the lesser vehicle is mentioned in Distinguishing the Middle fr om Extremes:In the case of the bodhisattva,Focus, directing the mind,And attainment are superior.Mantra is superior to sūtra in a similar way. In the mantra approach, one focuses on one’s own body, the bodies of others, and so forth. In short, one focuses on all the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa while directing the mind to their inseparability from primordial great purity and equality. Th is enables one to attain the fi nal fruition without having to go through other paths. Th erefore, while on the path of sūtra, in terms of the relative one rejects Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 30Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 303/11/09 3:42:47 PM3/11/09 3:42:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"luminous essence 31saṃsāra and accepts nirvāṇa. Here, however, one pursues the path by uniting with the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Th is leads to mantra’s lesser path of accumulation, which has the nature of the four applications of mind-fulness. Th is then evolves into the intermediate path of accumulation, the nature of which is the four correct relinquishments, and then the greater path of accumulation, the nature of which is the four bases of miraculous power. Th us, on the path of accumulation, the meaning of the inseparable two truths of purity and equality is primarily encountered as a mere object of intellec-tual understanding by means of study and contemplation. It is called the “path of accumulation” because, in this context, one exerts oneself in devel-opment and completion, thereby causing the path of the noble ones to mani-fest within one’s stream of being.As one’s practice of development and completion develops further, medi-tation experience becomes the most important factor. Th e four stages of the path of joining then occur once the illustrated, the actual natural state, is encountered through an object universal. On the path of joining, the stage of heat occurs when the illustrative example-wisdom fi rst arises as an early indication of the fi re-like wisdom of the path of seeing. Th is also has the nature of the fi ve faculties—the faculty of knowledge that realizes the natu-ral state of the inseparable truths of purity and equality, assisted by faith and the other faculties. When this develops even further, the realization of the stage of summit occurs on the path of joining. Th is stage is reached when the fi ve faculties, such as faith, manifest as the summit of all the vacillating roots of virtue, yet remain unable to become powers. Th e stage of acceptance on the path of joining arises in one’s stream of being when the fi ve faculties of the stage of summit can no longer be overcome by their individual discor-dant factors, and therefore become of the nature of the fi ve powers. Th is stage is so called because here the mind becomes resilient due to a unique experi-ence of the natural state of reality. When this develops further, the fi nal sym-bolic wisdom, which is capable of directly inducing actual wisdom, manifests within one’s stream of being. Th is is the stage of the supreme property. It is referred to as such because this is supreme among all mundane paths and is able to induce the noble path. Th e path of joining receives its name because these stages connect with the path of seeing. Th e path of joining is delineated by whether or not the symbolic wis-dom has arisen in one’s stream of being. However, at times it is explained that the development stage pertains to the path of accumulation, while the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 31Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 313/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32 luminous essencecompletion stage, such as vajra recitation, is practiced on the path of joining. Still, while this is the case for the gradual type of person, it is not categorically so. For example, it is possible that someone may recognize wisdom while receiving empowerment, whereby realization and familiarity occur instan-taneously. Moreover, it is also possible to practice development and comple-tion as a unity from the very start. It may also be the case that the symbolic wisdom can be induced through the profound development stage, in which one understands appearance and emptiness to be like the moon refl ected in water. Finally, it is also possible that someone trains in certain practices, such as the vajra recitation, but still remains on the mere path of accumulation due to an inability to bring forth the symbolic wisdom. Th erefore, no mat-ter what approach one takes when practicing development and completion, as taught in their respective classes of tantra, the essential point is the fact that “the mantric path of joining” occurs when the symbolic wisdom arises in one’s stream of being. Th is symbolic wisdom takes two forms. Th e symbolic wisdom that occurs on the fi rst two stages of the path of joining is an approximation, and compa-rable to a painting of the moon. On the second two stages it is genuine, and, hence, similar to a refl ection of the moon in water.Th e fi nal realization of the path of joining induces the path of seeing. At this stage, one beholds the actual wisdom that is illustrated, which is compa-rable to the actual moon in the sky, without the duality of subject and object. In this way, one gains an actual realization of the seven aspects of the path of enlightenment, such as the knowledge that directly perceives the truth of reality. Th e mantric path of cultivation occurs next. Th is path has the nature of the eight aspects of the noble path, such as the authentic view that directly wit-nesses appearance and existence as great purity and equality. It encompasses the nine grounds that relate to the elimination of nine obscurations. First, the second ground is achieved when the wisdom of the path of training arises in one’s stream of being. Th is wisdom serves to remedy the most dominant of those factors that are discarded through cultivation. Th is gradually contin-ues until the wisdom of the path of training fi nally reaches a point of culmi-nation at the end of the continuum of the attainment of the tenth ground. Th is serves to remedy the least dominant factors that are discarded through cultivation. At this point, one enters the consummate path and achieves equipoise Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 32Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 323/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"luminous essence 33within the fi nal, natural state through the vajra-like absorption. Th rough the power of this absorption, even the subtlest potentials of the two obscurations are uprooted. Once they are, the supreme fruition is immediately achieved on the path of liberation and one awakens to buddhahood within the utterly pure wisdom body of the unifi ed state beyond training. Th e names of the grounds are the same as in the vehicle of the perfec-tions. Th eir individual qualities and signs as well can be ascertained from the presentation off ered in the scriptures. In this regard, there is no distinction between sūtra and mantra.Th ese fi ve paths are presented with reference to the way one perceives the intrinsic nature of equality, meaning the actual luminosity, or the way things are. Th us, on the path of accumulation, luminosity is merely an object that one comes to understand through study and contemplation. On the path of joining , example luminosity is present, while actual luminosity manifests on the path of seeing. On the path of cultivation, the luminosity of train-ing manifests, and on the path beyond training, the fi nal luminosity itself occurs. Th ere are no diff erences between the grounds of the noble ones in terms of how the basic fi eld of phenomena is directly perceived. However, there are major diff erences when it comes to how clear this experience has become. Still, these diff erences are experienced individually by the noble ones. Th ey cannot be appreciated by a mind that is involved in study and contempla-tion, just as one cannot perceive the path of a bird fl ying in the sky. Never-theless, the diff erences between the ten grounds can be proven in terms of how the certainty of the ensuing attainment manifests based on the attain-ment of clear experience, and how the qualities of abandonment and realiza-tion gradually evolve.As the clear experience of reality continues to develop, the perception of the purity of appearance and existence also undergoes a process of transfor-mation. Hence, we speak of the imaginary divine body on the path of accu-mulation, the divine body of the energetic mind on the path of joining, the divine body of luminosity on the path of seeing, the divine body of the union of training on the path of cultivation, and, fi nally, the divine body of the uni-fi ed state beyond training. In these two ways, the path allows one to resolve the meaning of great purity and equality. Th e so-called “unifi ed state beyond training” is when the meaning of the inseparable truths of purity and equality manifest simultaneously, not in Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 33Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 333/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34 luminous essencealternation. Th is is the ground of buddhahood. As this is the wisdom body of the indivisible two truths, this ground is essentially without divisions. Never-theless, in consideration of the three bodies, the ground can be divided into the grounds of Universal Illumination, the Lotus Realm, and the Great Gath-ering of the Wheel of Syllables.Although there are diff erent ways to explain how these grounds relate to the three bodies, these explanations do not confl ict with one another in terms of meaning. Th ey all agree that these grounds do not diff er in terms of aban-donment and realization, but are merely conceptual distinctions. Other cat-egorizations, such as the grounds of Great Bliss and Unsurpassed Wisdom, can be understood in the same manner.When these grounds and paths are considered in the context of the path of means, the qualities of the fi ve paths are seen to be the fruition of the ener-getic mind that dwells within the fi ve wheels becoming increasingly workable. Moreover, the wisdom of the eleventh ground manifests once the twenty-one knots that the right and left channels form around the central channel are undone, as is well known in the general tantras of the mantra tradition.Th e grounds and paths of mantra are generally divided in terms of causal and resultant grounds. With respect to their enumeration, distinctive names, and other such factors, they are treated diff erently in the various tantras. Even if we consider the four joys alone, we will fi nd various presentations, such as the way these four correlate with the fi ve paths. Nevertheless, this present account allows us to see that all the various explanations that pertain to the progression of the path, without exception, present the same key issue. Th e relationship between this path and the four knowledge holders is dis-cussed in a number of ways. According to the Great Omniscient One, the mind matures in deity practice at the end point of the path of inspired con-duct, but the body has yet to transform into anything other than a matured form. However, the body of the great seal will be attained on the path of seeing as soon as one is free from the encasement of the body. Th is is the matured knowledge holder. Starting from the path of seeing, on the path of training , the body of maturation is transformed into a vajra body. Th e level of buddhahood can be reached without relinquishing such a body, as it is free of the defi lement of the aggregates and possesses the vision of wisdom. Th is is the knowledge holder with power over longevity. For a noble one on the superior path of training , the body transforms into the deity that one has meditated on, and one’s activity comes to resemble that of a buddha.

Th is is the knowledge holder of the great seal. Finally, once abandonment and realization have been perfected, the stage beyond training is actualized. Th is is the spontaneously present knowl-edge holder.Th e oral tradition of the Zur clan explains that all four knowledge hold-ers pertain to the grounds of training of the noble ones. Someone who sees the truth of reality, yet lacks the mental capacity required to purify the defi le-ments of the body with the fi re of wisdom, is a matured knowledge holder. When the capacity to purify has been achieved and the body is immortal and pure, one is a knowledge holder with power over longevity. Th us, this tradition explains that there are two versions of the path of seeing. To continue, some-one on the path of cultivation who possesses a body of illusory wisdom is a knowledge holder of the great seal. Finally, at the completion of the path of training , one is not yet a buddha. Nevertheless, one assumes the appearance of a vajra holder with the fi ve bodies spontaneously present. Th is is referred to as the spontaneously present knowledge holder. Etymologically speaking , the term “knowledge holder” is a translation of the Sanskrit word vidyādhara. Vidyā means “knowledge.” More specifi cally, this refers to the nature of knowledge and wisdom that is the essential reality of mantra. Dhara means “to hold,” thus implying that this reality is held and possessed within one’s stream of being. However these four knowledge holders are delineated, there is no confl ict, as is the case with the four aspects of approach and accomplishment. Th ese terms, moreover, can also be used in regard to the accomplishment of mantra. Th is is the case with the knowledge holders of the desire and form realms, and the sword knowledge holder. Th ere is also a threefold classifi cation of knowl-edge holders in terms of entering , dwelling on, and maturing the grounds. With respect to the path of cultivation alone, fi ve knowledge holders are pre-sented: those of the vajra, wheel, jewel, lotus, and sword. In this way, there are a number of diff erent classifi cations.3.

Th ese can all be subsumed in the threefold principle of supportive body, supported wisdom, and performed enlightened activity. When elaborated upon, however, there is an array of distinct qualities that surpasses the imagination, equaling all aspects of the objects of knowledge that entirely fi ll the basic space of phenomena. For as long as space remains, these qualities bring benefi t and happiness to sentient beings in a permanent, pervasive, and spontaneously present manner.Why is this referred to as the continuum of fruition? It is known as fr uition because it is the fi nal and unsurpassable goal and because, in terms of the way things appear, it is actualized by the power of the path clearing away adventi-tious stains. It is referred to as continuum because it is never interrupted.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 36Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 363/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"luminous essence 372. Specifi c Explanation of the Path ContinuumTh is section has two divisions: a demonstration of the various classifi cation schemes and explaining the present context.1. Various Classifi cation SchemesTh e tantras, as well as the commentaries on their intent, teach a number of classifi cations of the path of the vajra vehicle. Th ough the path of secret man-tra can be taught as a single practice of indivisible means and knowledge, it can also be explained in a dual manner as development and completion, or means and knowledge. Th ere are also threefold divisions, such as the prac-tices of enlightened body, speech, and mind; view, meditation, and conduct; or approach, accomplishment, and activity. One fourfold division is based on gradual practices that take the wisdoms of the four vajras as the path, while another such division is made from the perspective of taking the bud-dha’s enlightened body, speech, mind, and deeds as the path, in which case one speaks of binding with the ties of the four seals—the great seal, dharma seal, samaya seal, and action seal. Finally, there is also an explanation that condenses the entire path into fi ve categories: empowerment, samayas, view, accomplishment, and enlightened activity.Alternatively, according to the Fortress Garland, secret mantra can be explained in terms of six parameters:Samayas maintain the foundation, the view resolves, action deter-mines, empowerment brings progression, absorption brings practi-cal experience, and the key instructions accomplish the meaning.According to the Pa rkh a b, there is also a sevenfold classifi cation into view, conduct, absorption, empowerment, samayas, enlightened activity, and accomplishment. Adding maṇḍala to these seven, there are eight. According to Rongzom, the basis consists of fi ve factors: maṇḍala, sama-yas, accomplishment, empowerment, and enlightened activity. Th ere are also four subsidiary factors: mantra, mudrā, absorption, and off ering , making a nine-fold classifi cation. Since view and conduct pervade all of these, they are not listed separately. Th ere is also a tenfold division. Th ese ten topics of tantra consist of the view, conduct, maṇḍala, empowerment, samayas, off erings, mantra, absorption, Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 37Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 373/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 luminous essenceenlightened activity, and accomplishment. Th ese ten embody all paths. Here, mantra and mudrā are combined into one category.In this way, all these classifi cations off er proper explanations by empha-sizing their respective topics, while showing other divisions to be subsidiary. Nevertheless, there is no diff erence between them in the sense that they are all able to explain the path of secret mantra in a comprehensive manner.2. Th e Present ContextTh e presentation that concerns us in the present context is that of our own tradition. Th is excellent explanation is framed around an extensive catego-rization of eleven topics, or parameters, of tantra. Th ese eleven are (1) the view of reality, (2) unmoving absorption, (3) determined action, (4) arranged maṇḍala, (5) progressive empowerment, (6) unbroken samayas, (7) zealous practice, (8) directed off erings, (9) activity display, (10) binding mudrā, and (11) recited mantra. Th ese are enumerated in accordance with the eleven grounds.1. ViewNext, we shall off er an individual explanation of these points. First is the view.Th e single cause and the manner of syllables,Blessings and in actuality—By virtue of these four forms of perfect realization, Everything is the great king of the truly perfect.As expressed in this verse, the view of great purity and equality is the pre-cursor to all paths of unexcelled mantra. All other trainings must follow this view. Th e view is, therefore, of the utmost importance and will be explained in some detail. Th e view will be explained in terms of its (1) essence, (2) divi-sions, (3) principles, and (4) purpose.1. EssenceTh e nature of the view is taught in terms of a common, general explanation and an extraordinary, specifi c explanation.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 38Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 383/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"luminous essence 391. Th e Common, General Explanation Th e term “view” derives from the Sanskrit word dṛṣṭi. It refers to a mind that defi nitively and decisively apprehends a cognized object once knowledge has eliminated misconception. Among the diff erent kinds of knowledge, there are various levels of mundane and supramundane views, depending on whether or not an object is correctly ascertained.Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence says:Not understanding and wrong understanding,Partial understanding and no understanding of the genuine,Discipline, intent, secret,And the naturally secret meaning.All of these are fully illustrated by statements,Based on assembled words formed by letters and sounds.Th e concealed meaning is revealed from within,And dwells in the enlightened mind of the vajra teacher.As stated here, the view grows increasingly sublime. Th is process begins with the view of ordinary worldly people. In the absence of any philosophical investigation, such individuals believe that self and phenomena truly exist, just as they appear. Th e supreme view is only reached in the system of the glo-rious Secret Essence, which genuinely proves appearance and existence to be great purity and equality, the natural maṇḍala of the ground.2. Th e Extraordinary, Specifi c ExplanationTh is system of the unexcelled vehicle is the pinnacle of all views, the ultimate philosophical position, and the ultimate destination of all paths. Th e extraor-dinary view of this system is the ascertainment of appearance and existence as great purity and equality. Furthermore, since a “view” is posited as hav-ing the character of identifying the meaning of that which is to be resolved, it must be primarily classifi ed as a certainty related to the ensuing attain-ment. Equipoise, such as on the path of seeing, is described as “knowledge” and “wisdom”; only rarely is it referred to as a “view.” However, since it does indeed behold the nature of reality, referring to it as a “view” does not pres-ent any problem. Nevertheless, the manner in which the basic space of phenomena is observed during the equipoise of the noble ones is through individual self-Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 39Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 393/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 luminous essenceawareness. As such, it transcends being an object of names and concepts. Still, the way in which clear experience is attained during equipoise naturally leads to certainty in the ensuing attainment. Th e individual levels and correct views of the noble ones are classifi ed based on the certainty of the ensuing attainment. Th is is expressed in certain statements, such as “the universally present meaning , the supreme meaning.” Similarly, here one will rest in equipoise in the meaning of the great sim-plicity of unity. Th is equipoise, moreover, occurs due to the power of wis-dom being transferred during empowerment, as well as one’s meditation on the unique path. Th ereby, appearance and existence are ascertained as great purity and equality during the ensuing attainment. Th is special view of man-tra is a unique ascertainment of the meaning of the two truths since it is proved by the power of fact.2. DivisionsAs is widely discussed in the various classes of tantra of the ancient transla-tions, there are three diff erent views: (1) the view that observes the subject, (2) the view that observes reality, and (3) the view that observes self-aware-ness. Th ese three are synonymous with the conventional subject, the ultimate subject, and the subject that ascertains the indivisibility of the two truths. Hence, these three are not only pertinent to this discussion but encompass all views.Th e three divisions presented in this context, however, are quite extraordi-nary. Th e view that observes phenomena sees the world and its inhabitants as great purity, the maṇḍala of bodies and wisdoms of the support and the sup-ported. Th e view that observes reality views all phenomena as the indivisible great equality. Finally, the view that observes self-awareness is the individual self-awareness of the superior truth of indivisible purity and equality—the great dharma body. 3. Establishing the View through ReasoningTh is explanation involves (1) proving how the mantric view is superior to the view of sūtra and (2) proving the profundity of the view of the exceedingly sublime mantra.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 40Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 403/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"luminous essence 411. Th e Superiority of the Mantric ViewOne might wonder whether there is a diff erence between the views of sūtra and mantra. When it comes to merely resolving the object of evaluation, meaning the basic space of phenomena free from constructs, the views of these two tra-ditions are the same. However, there is a diff erence in the way that the subject sees the basic space of phenomena. Since the view is set forth from the per-spective of the subject, this diff erence is, in fact, immense. Still, if the object resolved through the view—the basic space of phenomena, or suchness—was not identical in sūtra and mantra, it would absurdly follow that all phe-nomena would have diff erent types of suchness. Other absurd con sequences would be that one could not perceive suchness through the sūtric path of see-ing , and that reasoning would have to prove that there is further construction to be eliminated beyond the constructs of the four extremes.Consequently, all the learned and accomplished masters are in agreement when it comes to this single essential point: reality is directly seen on the path of seeing in both sūtra and mantra. Th is may lead one to think that the sup-eriority of the mantric view is untenable since the object of both views is the same. Nevertheless, the superiority of the mantric view is, indeed, tenable. Although their purport is identical, Th e vehicle of mantra is exceedingly sublime, As it is undeluded, rich in means, without hardship, And meant for those with sharp faculties.As alluded to here, the mantric vehicle is superior in two ways: (1) it employs knowledge to bring about a distinct freedom from delusion and (2) with its distinctive abundance of skillful methods, it allows one to behold the natural state in a swift manner. Th erefore, as a path, it is both convenient and swift . Hence, it involves no hardships. As for the individual, or support, who is fi t for this vehicle, mantra is the domain of those with sharper faculties than those who are infl uenced exclusively by the causal vehicle. In this way, man-tra is exceedingly sublime.When someone with excellent vision and someone else with impaired vision look at the same fi gure from far away, we can distinguish between accurate and distorted perception. In the same way, mantra is superior to sūtra, both in terms of the way one attains vivid experience during meditative equipoise and also how one gains certainty during the ensuing attainment.

In addi-tion, one also gathers the accumulations on a vast scale. In this way, the basic space of phenomena is realized in actuality aft er an extended duration. In mantra, however, one is able to realize the basic space of phenomena within the nature of one’s own mind. Th is realization, moreover, is a direct experi-ence and utterly free of any speculation. Here one attains a vivid experience of the natural state through the power of the ripening empowerments and the extraordinary vital points of the key instructions. Th is is similar to clearly seeing a distant fi gure aft er applying ointment to one’s eyes, or undoing the secret rope by becoming skilled in the essential points of incisive yogic exercises. Moreover, even though the key point of intellectual meditation on the path of sūtra does ultimately come down to the inseparability of the two truths, it is diffi cult for a beginner to ascertain, or experience, the equal taste of the unity of the two truths. Th erefore, such individuals primarily grasp at emptiness as being a negation of individual extremes. In mantra, however, the unifi ed wisdom of luminosity is revealed in its natural state. On this point, the Wheel of Time explains: Unlike what the realists believe, the three existences are not estab-lished as forms consisting of minute particles or consciousness. Rather, what exists here is merely consciousness free from appre-hended or apprehender. Th is is the assertion of the Mind Only School. However, if one investigates this claim, as is the case with the smallest particle, even consciousness itself does not truly exist. “Th e insight of the Buddha was that no phenomena dwells anywhere. Th at is the Middle Way.” Th ese words taught by Buddhists lack the unchanging bliss. People who lack this merely apprehend emptiness. In this way, they view the empty and are unable to give up reference points. Th erefore, in the “Wheel of Time” the Lord has taught the vehicle of mantra to be an unchanging and innate physical bliss that dwells in the body, yet does not arise from it.In this way, mantra is superior to sūtra in terms of the vivid experience of meditative equipoise and the naked experience of the meaning of the unity of bliss and emptiness, or of basic space and awareness.Secondly, when one experiences this unity of bliss and emptiness, or the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 42Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 423/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"luminous essence 43unity of basic space and awareness, the naturally pure expanse is spontane-ously present. Th is expanse is suchness, the natural state of all phenomena, and it is spontaneously present within the aspect of awareness as the bodies and wisdoms, which are beyond meeting and parting in essence. Th e natural state is the unity of appearance and emptiness; there are no impure appear-ances in this natural state. Th erefore, within the natural state of luminosity, the bodies and wisdoms are self-display. Th eir divisions display innumerable qualities of enlightenment, exceeding the number of grains of sand on the riverbed of the Ganges. Th is is not only the assertion of mantra, but also of the common great vehicle. In this regard, the Supreme Continuity states:Exceeding the number of grains of sand in the Ganges, Inconceivable, unequalled, and full of qualities—Th is pristine basic fi eld of the thus-gone ones Is free from fl aws and their habitual patterns.Th is demonstrates that the basic space at the time of the completely pure fruition and the naturally present potential are essentially free of change and without any qualitative diff erence. Th erefore, by attaining a vivid experience of reality during meditative equipoise, one will give rise to the supreme cer-tainty that all apparent phenomena are none other than the expanse of great equality, reality itself. Moreover, one will also gain certainty in the primordi-ally pure nature of all appearances, which neither meet nor part from equal-ity. Th is extraordinary certainty of the subsequent attainment is the view of secret mantra. Seeing the luminous basic space, exactly as it is, is to attain the wisdom of the sūtra path of seeing. Th rough this, during meditative equipoise one sees the meaning of the great equality of the basic space of phenomena, in a way that is beyond subject-object duality. Such perception is without concepts, such as pure/impure and existent/nonexistent. By virtue of having seen the basic space of phenomena in actuality, one then realizes the meaning of great purity and equality exactly as it is. Th is realization takes place within a state of ascertainment during the ensuing attainment. Th e Supreme Continuity explains: Since the nature of mind is luminous, they see disturbing emotions to be without essence.

One will not even be able to see the truth of the intrinsic nature in an accurate manner!One may argue that because all that appears and exists is not taught to be great purity, the nature of primordial enlightenment, on the path of sūtra, it is impossible to see the truth through the path of sūtra alone. On the path of sūtra, one gathers the accumulations and grows accustomed to the signif-icance of the teaching that shows all phenomena to be equality, and does so for one incalculable eon. Aft er an extended duration, this is capable of natu-rally inducing the ascertainment of the great purity of appearance and exis-tence, the signifi cance of which had hitherto remained hidden on one’s path. On the three pure grounds, for instance, the universe and its inhabitants are seen as pure and one realizes the equality of existence and peace. Th e prac-tice of these pure grounds—both the equality of existence and peace and the establishment of pure realms—is the actualization of purity and equality as explained in mantra. Hence, by applying skillful methods, it is as though one is able to actualize independently the means of mantra by which one swift ly becomes enlightened. Not only that, according to the sūtras, one can become enlightened in a week, if one so wishes, once the fi rst ground is attained. Th us, there are two options. One either becomes enlightened swift ly through mantra or gains realization of the meaning taught in mantra aft er an extended period of time. However, one should know that these two come down to the same essential point; there is no contradiction in terms of their intent. A great deal more can be said on this topic, but we shall leave the dis-cussion for now as these issues are addressed elsewhere. Th e causal vehicle of characteristics is referred to as such because it asserts that, while all phenomena are a great equality in the ultimate sense, in terms of the relative, cause and eff ect and accepting and rejecting are diff erent and, Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 44Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 443/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"luminous essence 45moreover, saṃsāra is not enlightened in and of itself. Such beliefs create delu-sion concerning the fact that all phenomena are enlightened. In contrast, on the path of mantra, one views saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as an indivisible great purity from the very beginning, even while eliminating misconceptions through study and contemplation. Th erefore, the view is free from delusion; the truth of origin arises as the essence of the truth of the path, and the truth of suff ering as the essence of the truth of cessation. In this way, affl ictive emotions are liberated as wisdoms and suff ering as great bliss. Hence, this approach is referred to as the “fruitional vehicle” and the “vajra vehicle” because eff ects are seen to be inseparable from their causes. For these same reasons, the aggregates, elements, and sense sources are explained using the term “vajra.”2. Th e View of MantraTh is section has two parts: a proof of the view’s individual elements and a proof of the view in general. 1. Individual Elements of the ViewTh is explanation proves purity, equality, and inseparability. 1. PurityTh is section proves the principle of purity and disposes of claims that this principle is untenable.1. Th e Principle of PurityTh e explanation of this principle involves proving (1) appearances to be divine and (2) the subject to be wisdom. 1. Th e Divinity of AppearancesTh is section consists of the actual proof of purity via the valid cognition that investigates the conventional and proof by the force of the valid cognition that investigates the ultimate. 1. Conventional Valid CognitionTh ere are a number of ways to prove the divinity of appearance in a way that accords with the experience of those who accept the existence of external Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 45Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 453/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46 luminous essenceobjects. Here, however, I will simply off er an explanation of the essential points of this argument. Th e same body of water may appear to hungry ghosts as pus and blood, to humans as water, to those who dwell in pure realms as a stream of nectar, and to noble knowledge holders with pure vision as the form of Māmakī. Touching it performs the function of moistening and pro-duces playful bliss and nonconceptual meditative absorption. For buddhas, who have completely exhausted all latent tendencies, nothing appears from the perspective of seeing things as they are, for all constructs without excep-tion have been pacifi ed. From the perspective of seeing things in their mul-tiplicity, however, appearances are seen as complete purity, the embodiment of limitless self-displayed domains of wisdom activity.At this point, one may wonder which of these ways of seeing is valid, and which object is established in accordance with conventional reality. Th e purer the subject, the more valid its cognition. What a given subject sees can be established to be the natural state. Th is is similar to objects, such as a white conch and yellow conch, and the minds that apprehend them. In this way, it follows that the natural state of all appearances can be proven to be the bod-ies and maṇḍalas of wisdom. Th e reason, here, is that their purity is perceived by noble beings who are free from distorting pollutants, just as a conch will be perceived to be white by someone with unimpaired vision. Evidence of this can be established using both scripture and reasoning. First, let us consider scripture as evidence. It is generally acknowledged in scripture that those who have attained the wisdom of transformation, such as those who dwell on the pure grounds, experience pure realms and other forms of pure perception. In light of this fact, one may argue that the noble ones see a self-display, whereas that which is seen by ordinary beings is not seen as pure. If this were the case, however, it would absurdly follow that there are no objects of perception that can be shared by both pure and impure beings. Th is, however, is not the case. Take the case of Śāriputra, who saw the Buddha’s realm as impure, and Brahmaśikhin, who saw it as pure. When they disputed, the Buddha made the pure realm visible to everybody and said: “Although my realm is always pure like this, you do not see it.” If authentic perception and mistaken per-ception were unable to evaluate the nature of the same object, then whatever is seen by anyone would become valid cognition. In this way, one would be unable to tell the diff erence between the truth and falsity of the appearance of a yellow and white conch, respectively. Consequently, were any tradition Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 46Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 463/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"luminous essence 47to propose such a theory, all categories of validity and invalidity would vanish. Th erefore, apart from pure self-display, there are no impure objects. Th e Condensed Sūtra of Transcendent Knowledge states: Th e purity of form should be known as the purity of fruition.Pure fruition and form are pure in omniscience.In omniscience, the purity of the fruition and the purity of formAre equal like the element of space—indivisible and inseparable.Objects are seen in a pure manner when the subject is purifi ed of stains. In this way, the precise nature of the object becomes evident, like the perception that overturns the apprehension of a conch being yellow. Second, let us consider evidence established through reasoning. Th e fact that the same object can be perceived in diff erent ways is something that is clearly accepted and proven in this world, and if one has become accustomed to all phenomena being indivisible from the naturally pure basic space, one will only perceive appearances that are characterized by natural purity. Th is occurrence of consummate vivid appearance can be established through inference.Th e basic argument is sound because as pure seeing is unmistaken, what-ever is seen in that mode must necessarily be in accordance with fact. If this were not so, pure seeing would have to be false and impure seeing would prove to be true. In that case, we would have to assert that the noble ones perceive erroneously and ordinary beings perceive correctly. What respectful and reasonable individuals would ever make such a claim? In this way, the higher forms of perception refute lower ones, while lower ones do not invalidate higher ones. On this point, Entering the Middle Way states:Th e observation of someone with an eye-disorderDoes not invalidate the cognition of one with healthy eyes.Likewise, a mind that lacks stainless wisdomCannot invalidate a stainless mind.Buddhas, who have completely purifi ed all stains, see all that exists and, from this perspective, see all phenomena in a pure manner. Since this Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 47Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 473/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48 luminous essenceperception cannot be superseded, it is established as the fi nal conventional mode of relative phenomena. In this way, it is of the utmost importance to understand that all these relative phenomena have two modes: the way they appear to confused perception and the natural state of the relative itself.To believe that valid cognition that investigates the conventional is noth-ing but the confi ned perception of ordinary people, and that what is seen by that confi ned vision alone is the fi nal natural state of the conventional is extremely closed-minded. When examined carefully, only a coarse intellect would see no reason to diff erentiate between the perception that a conch is white and the perception that a conch is yellow as, respectively, valid and invalid cognitions. If the natural state of any given entity were nothing more than the way it appears to an ordinary being , then the appearance of a yel-low conch to the one who perceives it as such would also be the conch’s true natural state.One may think, “But such perception is distorted, insofar as it is caused by delusion; it is not a perception of the natural state.” Nevertheless, even though these impure appearances that are tainted by erroneous habitual con-ditioning are perceivable by ordinary people, one must assert that their natu-ral state is the way they appear to pure beings, which are free from such stains. Th erefore, to give a brief account of this extremely profound key point, we will discuss the thoroughly conventional valid cognitions. Th ere are two such valid cognitions: the thoroughly conventional valid cognition based on con-fi ned vision and the thoroughly conventional valid cognition based on pure vision. In brief, the diff erence between these two can be explained in terms of their cause, essence, function, and result.Th e valid cognition of confi ned vision is caused by a correct examination of its particular, limited object. In essence, it is a temporarily undeceiving awareness of merely its specifi c object. It functions to eliminate superimpo-sitions regarding the objects of confi ned vision. It results in an engagement based on having fully determined the object at hand.Th e valid cognition of pure seeing is caused by having correctly observed reality as it truly is. In essence, it is a vast knowledge concerning all possi-ble subjects. It functions to eliminate superimpositions concerning a fi eld of experience that the confi ned perception of ordinary beings cannot fathom. It results in the accomplishment of the wisdom that knows all there is. Th ese two valid cognitions can be likened to the human eye and the divine eye, respectively. Th e valid cognition of pure vision knows the object Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 48Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 483/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"luminous essence 49of confi ned vision, yet confi ned vision does not know the objects of the valid cognition of pure vision. Th e object of the latter is, therefore, unique. Instances of this are the appearance of as many buddha-fi elds as there are dust motes in the world in a single dust mote, performing activities of many eons in a single moment, displaying emanations while not departing from the unchanging basic space of phenomena, and knowing all objects of cognition in a single instant with a nonconceptual mind. Th ese inconceivable experiences appear to confl ict with the objects of ordi-nary confi ned vision. For this reason, this form of perception cannot be used to prove them. Yet this valid cognition can prove all of them as perfectly rea-sonable. Th e valid cognition of completely pure wisdom manifests by force of the reasoning of the inconceivable natural state. Th erefore, it is extremely powerful, never deceptive, supramundane, pure, unexcelled, and unequaled. All that can be commonly proven through the path of confi ned percep-tion, such as proving the authenticity of our teacher, is established using the valid cognition of confi ned vision. Th e unique inconceivable experiences of the thus-gone ones, in contrast, are proven with the valid cognition of pure vision by being in accord with the natural state. In this way, one should be knowledgeable concerning the essential point that profound principles, such as the primordial enlightenment of all phenomena, are not proven exclu-sively by means of confi ned perception, yet neither are they utterly without a valid means of proof.Without knowing this, one will be unable to draw any qualitative distinc-tions between nonattached non-Buddhists and the four sublime ones with respect to their ability to perceive sentient beings within the mere width of a chariot wheel, nor will one be able to note the diff erence between an erro-neous cognition that grows increasingly mistaken and a view that becomes increasingly sublime. Th ere will also be no qualitative distinction made between the degree of knowledge possessed by those with diff erent status, like the Buddha seeing the seed of liberation in the being of the householder Śrīsambhava, while the foe destroyers did not. In this way, one will not gain conviction in teachings, such as the following passage from a sūtra: Even upon the tip of one hairTh ere are an inconceivable number of buddha-fi elds.Th eir various shapes are all distinct;Th ey are clearly separate.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 49Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 493/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"50 luminous essenceTh is issue is, therefore, of great import in both sūtra and mantra.2. Purity and Ultimate Valid CognitionTh e term “impure” refers to nothing more than the appearances that com-prise the truths of suff ering and its origin. Th e appearances that dwell in unity with basic space, which is empty of the two selves, can be established as nei-ther the essence nor the object of disturbing emotions, such as grasping at a self, nor can they be established as the identity of the karma and suff ering that are produced by the disturbing emotions. Th erefore, not even the names of the impurities contained within the truths of suff ering and its origin exist. Everything dwells naturally in a state of purity. Th erefore, since there is no phenomenon that is not of the nature of the great equality of emptiness, all of appearance and existence is proven to be primordial great purity. Th e principle of purity is not simply expressed from the perspective of emptiness, in which no phenomena exist. Rather, because appearances themselves are inseparable from emptiness, they are shown to be great bliss, exactly in the way they appear. Th ey are always sublime and pri-mordially pure. 2. Th e Subject as WisdomGreat purity can be proven in the following way to philosophers who do not accept any shared external object of perception, and who instead assert that all phenomena are merely the mind’s own display. First there is an occasion of impurity, in which various appearances of the six classes are perceived. As the mind conceives in various dualistic ways, they appear through the fully developed force of solidifying habitual patterns. Pure appearances manifest in the context of the path free from error, while the boundless appearances of complete purity manifest in the context of the fruition, at which point the entire range of obscurations have been exhausted. All of these appearances are none other than the self-display of one’s own mind. While functioning as the basis for all of them, however, the mind is luminous and empty of the two selves. It dwells as the unobstructed man-ifestation of various appearances. When the mind’s apprehensions are out of touch with the way things are, it apprehends a self, as well as subject and object, thereby producing disturbing emotions that, in turn, create karma. As a result of this, all the various appearances that are subsumed under the truth of suff ering can manifest, just like appearances in a dream. All of these Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 50Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 503/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"luminous essence 51confused experiences are not grounded in reality; they are unreliable and deceptive. By training on the path in accordance with the mind’s natural state, the confused aspect of self-display will gradually be reversed. When this hap-pens, pure appearances will faultlessly dawn and will no longer revert back. As these appearances are undeceiving and in tune with reality, they appear faultlessly as mere conventional self-display. Th us, confused appearances are not true, while pure appearances are true, insofar as they are free of stains. For instance, if one blends the element of gold that comes from earth and metal with the likes of the fi nest gold and the element of quicksilver, which comes from coal, water, and herbal ingredients, it will come to resemble a sin-gle mass, like a glob of fresh butter. As the object of sense-faculties like the eye, these ingredients will not be evident, while one may still understand it to possess various ingredients as an object of the mind. Confused individu-als will perceive it to be a mass of butter or grease. Others will see it as a cause of gold, with the mere understanding that it will become gold once burned. Learned individuals, on the other hand, will see that it possesses various con-stituents and will perceive its ability to appear in various ways depending upon the various conditions it meets with. When such a mass is cold, it will remain like a mass of fresh butter for an extremely long time. When it touches a fl ame and heats up, however, it will become the color of copper, bronze, and brass. Likewise, when heated with a strong fl ame, it will become the nature of ordinary gold, and will become the nature of the fi nest gold when heated thoroughly. From that point on, it will not change in nature, no matter what temperature its surroundings are. Th e all-ground consciousness can be understood in a similar fashion. Th e all-ground, the container of all seeds, manifests as the entire range of appear-ances. In the same way that a mass can appear diff erently to those of various faculties, the all-ground may appear in specifi c contexts as environs, bodies, and objective experiences that are either pure, impure, or completely pure. Just as one may understand the mass to possess various ingredients, the men-tal consciousness realizes that the seeds for an infi nite range of appearances throughout time and space are present within the all-ground, regardless of whether or not they have actually manifested from the all-ground.In the same way that the mass may be confused for a chunk of butter, some may apprehend all the appearances of the all-ground as a self and phenom-ena. Moreover, just as some may perceive the mass as quicksilver, some people Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 51Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 513/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"52 luminous essenceapprehend the aggregates as suff ering , being characterized by the ripening of karma. Similar to apprehending the mass to be the cause of gold, some per-ceive the aggregates themselves as the cause for the completely pure bodies and experiences of those who live in the pure realms. Learned individuals understand that, although the mass itself is not gold, it is not without the nature of gold either. Although it appears to be quicksilver, it is not the case that the gold transformed into quicksilver, nor is it the case that it lacks the nature of quicksilver. Such individuals will say that the nature of quicksilver is unstable and that it is easy for it to transform into a variety of things. Th ey know that the nature of gold is much more stable, for it is diffi cult to trans-form and will not diminish in quality. Even when burned in a blazing fi re, it will not be readily depleted. Likewise, impure phenomena are unstable and extremely deceptive. Th e appearances of past and future lives are mutable and exhausted by cultivat-ing the path. Pure appearances, however, are the exact opposite. As soon as one has mastered a pure body and experience, one will never have to expe-rience impurity again. One will develop supreme bliss, which is completely pure and free from suff ering. In this way, pure appearances are reliable and undeceiving. Th erefore, when compared with other perceptions, the mass with various constituents will truly become the nature of gold. Likewise, the all-ground, endowed as it is with various potentials and appearances, truly is the domain of pure appearances. When all the temporary habitual patterns related to delusion have run out, they will produce no more appearances. Nevertheless, the spontaneously present appearances of unobstructed natural radiance that occur within primordial basic space cannot possibly be retracted since they are essentially inseparable from it. Th erefore, pure self-displays of stainless wisdom are pure in actuality. In this way, if the identity of all saṃsāric phenomena is proven to be the pure deity, one may wonder what this term actually means. Th e actual deity of reality itself is the wisdom of nondual appearance and emptiness. It is the vajra body free from the obscurations of transference. It is the enlightenment of equal taste, where even the most subtle habitual tendency to obscure the reality of suchness has run out. It is inconceivable, free from the confi nes of singularity and multiplicity. Although beyond the entire realm of character-istics, it manifests in the form of all that can be known. It is the body of self-occurring wisdom, which is without diff erence and distinction from all the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 52Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 523/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"luminous essence 53bliss-gone ones of the three times. It is enlightenment as the equality of all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Th is is the ultimate deity, the universal master of all buddha families.Th e subject, the symbolic deity, manifests in the symbolic form of the wis-dom body itself, which transcends the domain of signs. As taught in each individual tantra, they appear in peaceful and wrathful forms with attributes like faces and hands, as main deities and their retinues, and as the support and supported. Th erefore, since all phenomena are of the same character within the expanse of the equality of appearance and emptiness, they are pure in being the essence of the main deity within the maṇḍala of the one with the body of vajra wisdom. Alternatively, since body, speech, and mind are the three vajras in nature, they are pure in being the three buddha families, while the fi ve aggregates are pure as the fi ve buddha families. In this way, phenomena can be classifi ed into fi ve or one hundred buddha families, all the way up to the inconceivable families of the magical net. Th e rationale here is that one can make as many divisions of purity as there are appearances of impurity, and that there is not even a single phenomenon whose essence wavers from the natural state of great purity and equality. Reality is nothing whatsoever, yet from it, anything can arise. Due to this key point, its self-display manifests impartially and without limitation as the display of the magical net. Th erefore, while the innumerable buddhas and their buddha-fi elds are completely pure, any amount of classifi cation can be accommodated, no matter what distinctions are being made. Th e reason is that no phenomenon is beyond the identity of self-occurring wisdom, great purity and equality, the reality beyond one and many. Hence, purity is con-textualized in various ways in the various classes of tantra, according to the enumeration of their respective deities. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence also teaches the principle of great purity in the following lines: Th e world, beings, and continua are realized to be pure.And:Th e secret bindu is the basic space of the maṇḍala. Th e elements are knowledge, the mother of the families.Th e great ones are the suchness of the families.

Th e Hevajra Tantra, for instance, explains: Sentient beings are actual buddhas, Yet obscured by temporary stains. While the Wheel of Time states: Sentient beings are buddhas. Th ere are no other illustrious buddhas in this world. In the Conduct Tantra of the Yoginī, it is said: Th e identity of all these beings is that of the fi ve buddhas. Th ey appear just like dancers or superb paintings.

Yet the fruitional vehicle of mantra Meditates on mind itself as buddha.Furthermore, according to the common great vehicle, it is also taught that all phenomena are in all ways fully and truly enlightened.2. Relinquishing the Untenability of PurityTh is section contains both a general and a specifi c way to refute critiques of purity. First, concerning the general refutation, some narrow-minded Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 54Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 543/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"luminous essence 55individuals may object that meditating on the world and its inhabitants on the path may merely cause them to appear to be pure, although this is not actually the case. Th e reason given is that while they may appear in this man-ner, their nature is of the truths of suff ering and its origin. We also accept that those of us with impure minds and impure eyes per-ceive things in an impure manner. Nonetheless, if everyone experienced pure appearances, what would there be to argue about? Although things may appear in an impure manner, this is not how they actually are. In fact, in their natural state, they are naturally pure. If one makes such an assertion, appear-ances do not necessarily have to appear the way they truly are because they can appear incorrectly to a mind tainted by confusion. Th is is no diff erent than an eye cognition that perceives a snow mountain to be blue. Th is is explained in the Root Knowledge of the Middle Way: If an objection is made through emptiness,Whatever may be repliedWill not be a reply,But the same as what is yet to be proven.For instance, when resolving all phenomena to be empty, no matter what phenomenon is posited to prove that things are not empty—including the causality of karma, saṃsāra, and nirvāṇa—the proof will amount to the same as what is still to be proven, and so one can prove that also the proof itself lacks inherent existence. Hence, whatever is set forth to prove that things are not empty becomes an aid to the reasoning that establishes emptiness, just like adding fuel to fi re. Just as one will be unable to fi nd a reasoning that dis-proves emptiness, any proof that is put forward to establish that phenomena are impure will itself be shown to be purity. Th erefore, no matter where one searches, one will not succeed in fi nding an argument that can disprove the reasoning that establishes all phenomena to be pure in their natural state.When using great purity in an argument,Whatever may be repliedWill not be a reply,But the same as what is yet to be proven.Furthermore, if sentient beings are buddhas, would it not follow that Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 55Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 553/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"56 luminous essencebuddhas suff er when sentient beings are miserable in hell? Th e answer is no. Th e misery in hell is merely apparent to the confused perception of those who have not realized the natural state. From the perspective of the way things appear, they are not buddhas. Th erefore, this objection does not hold. Th ere is no such thing as suff ering in the natural state. Th e Elaborate Magi-cal Net says: Without the self-awareness of authentic knowing,Even the realms of the bliss-gone ones are seen as the lower realms.If one realizes the meaning of the equality of the supreme vehicle,Th ese hellish abodes themselves are the abodes of the unexcelled and joyous.Some may infer other absurd consequences as well, such as saying that if all phenomena are primordially enlightened by their very nature, they should be universally perceived as such and there would be no need for cultivating the path. Th is attitude is pitifully small-minded. Claiming this would be tan-tamount to saying that a white conch should be perceived as such by even a visually impaired individual, and that there would be no need to try to heal such an impairment. Th erefore, when things do not appear the way they truly are, it is because the stains of confusion cause this to happen. Hence the path must be culti-vated to counter confusion. Although the nature of all phenomena is empti-ness, one must practice the path for it to be actualized. Consequently, any attempt to refute great equality is dispensed with in a way similar to the response to refutations of emptiness. When applying reasoning , both purity and equality are mutually confi rming and of a single key point. Since both are the nature of things, the proof of great purity is an extremely forceful reasoning arrived at through the power of fact. As such, it reigns supreme and cannot be invalidated.Second, concerning the specifi c refutation, some may object that, even though purity can be proven in this way, if a buddha’s wisdom only sees everything as pure, the objects and subjects appearing to the perception of confused beings will not be observed. Consequently, if they were not seen, a buddha would not be omniscient. Yet if they were, a buddha would see impure phenomena.Th e wisdom of omniscience allows buddhas to know appearances in the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 56Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 563/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"luminous essence 57way they appear, even those that appear to be impure. Still, it is not that these impure appearances truly exist, or that buddhas perceive phenomena that are proven to be impure. Buddhas see clearly how objects seem to be true to those who cling to true existence, likewise they see how the subject fi xates on their true existence. Nevertheless, a buddha will not view any phenomenon as truly existent because it is impossible for such a being to see even the tiniest particle as truly established. In this way, since buddhas perceive all phenom-ena as a self-display, it can be proven that buddhas only perceive purity.2. EqualityTh is topic has two subdivisions: arguments that prove equality and how to gain certainty about this principle.1. Arguments for EqualityIf the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are properly examined with the log-ical arguments of the Middle Way, such as the one from lack of one and many, one will gain certainty that not even a subtle particle of any given entity is truly established. Th is holds not only for the impure phenomena of saṃsāra, but also the pure bodies and wisdoms. 2. Gaining Certainty about EqualityTh ere may be people of sharp faculties who will analyze the mind in terms of its arising, abiding, and cessation, and thereby come to experience the nature of the three gates of liberation: emptiness of cause, eff ect, and essence. Th is alone will lead to an instantaneous certainty in the meaning of the equality of appearance and emptiness. However, in terms of ascertaining equality in a gradual way, beginners should begin by correctly examining the reasons that prove emptiness, such as the logical analysis of investigating singularity and multiplicity. When one refl ects on the meaning of nonexistence at that time, in relation to a vase, for instance, one will fi nd that although things seem to exist when not investi-gated, nothing can be found upon analysis. Th ereby, one will come to believe that nonexistence itself is the natural state. Th us, an image of emptiness man-ifests in a process of alternation between appearance and emptiness. When at that time one refl ects on the way that this nonexistence of phe-nomena is also just a mere imputation and not actually established, or on the way things appear while being primordially empty, one will develop an Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 57Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 573/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"58 luminous essenceextraordinary certainty about phenomena being empty while apparent, and apparent while empty, like the moon’s refl ection in a pool of water. At that time, the absence of nature and dependent arising will dawn in a noncontra-dictory manner. Th is is referred to as “the understanding of unity.” Although “absence of nature” and “dependent origination” are diff erent expressions, here one gains certainty that these two are essentially inseparable and with-out the slightest diff erence. Th rough this, the conceptual thought that connects appearance, the basis for negation, with an eliminated object of negation naturally falls away. In this way, the characteristics of freedom from constructs, such as the ability to remain naturally without negation and affi rmation, adding and removing , will dawn. As one grows increasingly familiar with this freedom from constructs, the entirety of dualistic phenomena, in which a confi ned mind observes par-ticular intrinsic natures in relation to individual subjects, becomes purifi ed. Th is process reaches a point of culmination by bringing forth a distinctive certainty that the nature of all phenomena is one of equality. In this way, one fi rst understands emptiness, then unity, freedom from con-structs, and, fi nally, equality. By understanding the former one gains access to the latter. However, until one has gained certainty in a preceding princi-ple, one will not be able to resolve the subsequent stage. Submitting oneself to the idea that the categorized ultimate, the mere lack of true existence, is the natural state will not bring one even close to the equality that is demon-strated in this context. Merely understanding the contradistinction that is the elimination of true existence, thinking this exists with reference to pillars, vases, and other such things, will not perform the function of equality, which is to do away with all notions of phenomena bearing marks and having good and bad qualities. Just so, a commoner cannot perform the duties of a king. Th erefore, when perfecting the Middle Way path free from all constructs, all phenomena are seen to be equality. Th is is the realization of great equality referred to in this context. On this point, the Tantra of the Secret Essence says: Not understanding freedom from reference points,You do not comprehend the basic space of phenomena.Th erefore, destroy entities and nonentitiesAnd thus apprehend freedom from reference points!Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 58Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 583/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"luminous essence 59And also:Th rough the two equalities and the two superior equalities,Th ere is the realm of the Samantabhadra maṇḍala.Not only do the tantras teach this, but the common vehicle as well. For instance, the Sūtra Requested by Kāśyapa mentions: Kāśyapa, realizing all phenomena to be equality is nirvāṇa. Th is is one, not two and not three.Th is explanation also demonstrates that ultimately there is only one vehicle. Th e Sūtra Th at Shows the Way to Awakening explains: Mañjuśrī, whoever sees that all phenomena are equal, nondual, and inseparable possesses the authentic view.3. InseparabilityPurity is established from the perspective of appearance, and equality from the perspective of emptiness. Since these two are inseparable and of one taste within all phenomena, the inseparability of purity and equality is proven indirectly through each of these principles. Whatever appears in a pure man-ner is empty of all extremes; and whatever is equality, meaning free from all extremes, manifests as the extreme purity of the manifold appearances of the magical net. Th ese two are inseparable within the single sphere of the dharma body. Th is is what the individual self-awareness of the sacred ones realizes and this is the manner of the great perfection of unity. On this point, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:In the secret bindu, the basic space of suchness,Is the actuality of all the buddhas.One sees the very face of the embodiment of enlightened body,Speech, qualities, activities, and mind, without exception,Of the completely perfect ones in the ten directions and four times.Th is mastery is the most sacred and supreme.And:Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 59Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 593/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"60 luminous essenceSelf-occurring wisdom appears without abiding.As for the way to practice this, it is said:Emptiness, the absence of self, is primordially known by self-aware-ness, the enlightened mind.With nothing to observe and nothing observing, mindfulness brings mastery.Th e amazing enlightened body, speech, qualities, and buddha fi elds,Are nowhere else; rather, it itself is just like this.Th e Compendium of Vajra Wisdom states:Were the two truths separate,Th e path of wisdom would be pointless.If clarity and emptiness were separate,One would fall into the extremes of eternalism and nihilism.And:Since the essence of all phenomena is beyond a path,By perfecting it you are freed from eff ort and strain.Th e completely pure innate wisdom,Is a nonabiding unity.Th e Nondual Victory likewise explains:Since they are profound, vast and inseparable,Appearance and emptiness are inseparably mixed.Th is is taught to be the buddhaAnd demonstrates the principle of enlightenment.

General ExplanationsTh is explanation has two subdivisions: establishing the present meaning directly to fortunate individuals and indirectly to skeptics.1. Directly Establishing the MeaningTh e meaning of the inseparability of purity and equality, which is beyond the intellect, is established by means of four realizations: 1) In the equality of the basic space of phenomena, all phenomena are established to be of a single cause, or a single mode. 2) Th e apparent aspect of this equality is the wisdoms and bodies. Th ese are established through the principle of the seed syllable, as various syl-lables can manifest from certain conditions, such as the single sound of the syllable “A.” 3) Th e single cause and the principle of syllables mutually bless each other and are beyond meeting and parting. 4) In this way, the meaning of the great dharma body, the inseparability of purity and equality, is experienced through one’s own self-awareness in a way that transcends the intellect.As an alternative to this gradual explanation: 1) In the essence of the inseparability of the truths of purity and equality, all phenomena are of a single taste and a single cause. 2) Th is is exemplifi ed by the syllable OṂ, which is illustrated by the three syllables A, U and M. Th ese three, in turn, demonstrate the inseparable nature of enlightened body, speech, and mind, and of the three gates to complete liberation. 3) By the force, or blessing, of these two arguments of meaning and met-aphor, all phenomena are resolved to be primordially enlightened as great purity and equality. 4) Although this meaning can be proven to be in accord with scripture and key instructions, it is not resolved through speculations that merely rely on the words of the scriptures and key instructions. Th e view of mantra is resolved from the depth of one‘s heart through the four direct ways of gaining certainty.Here, unity is pointed out from the very beginning , so explanation pertains to the instantaneous type. Still, in both cases, the four reasons, such as that Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 61Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 613/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62 luminous essenceof the single cause, are undeceiving means for accessing the profound view of mantra. Th erefore, they are called “arguments.”2. Indirectly Establishing the MeaningTh e meaning of the primordial enlightenment of all phenomena is extremely diffi cult to comprehend. For this reason, some individuals will fi nd it implau-sible. To such people, one can explain the meaning indirectly in the follow-ing manner. First, while non-Buddhists are doubtful of the idea that Buddha is an authentic being, in the Vedic scriptures, which they themselves believe in, it is said:On occasions as rare as the occurrence of an udumbāra fl ower, an omniscient teacher appears in this world in the ruling or priestly caste. When entering the womb, his mother dreams that he enters in the form of an elephant. When born, he displays major and minor marks. If he does not renounce the world, he will become a universal monarch; if he does, he will become enlightened.In this way, such scriptures establish the existence of the Buddha. From a logical perspective, the path shown by the Buddha, such as the absence of personal self, can be proven to be a liberating path through the rea-soning of the power of fact. Moreover, as this is the case, the Buddha can be proven to be an authentic teacher for anyone who seeks liberation, and the path that he taught can be proven to be authentic. In establishing our teach-er’s authenticity, the chapter “Establishing Validity” and other sources prove just this. Th ough listeners believe in the existence of the Buddha, they do not believe in the emptiness taught in the great vehicle. As for scripture, however, their own lesser vehicle sūtras make statements such as “form is like a mass of foam.” Moreover, from a logical point of view, if one fails to see the fi ve aggre-gates’ lack of true existence, insofar as they are composite and momentary, one will not establish the absence of personal self. Th erefore, just as the Jewel Garland explains, it can be proven that liberation is accomplished based on emptiness.Th ere are also scriptural and logical defenses directed toward those follow-ers of the sūtra path who do not believe in the profound view and conduct Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 62Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 623/11/09 3:42:48 PM3/11/09 3:42:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"luminous essence 63of secret mantra. In terms of scripture, the Royal Sūtra of Bestowing Instruc-tions prophesizes the later appearance of mantra. Moreover, the Sūtra of the Ornamental Array explains the fi ve aggregates to be of the nature of the thus-gone ones:Whoever dwells in the equal natureOf oneself and the buddhas,Does not abide or appropriate;He or she is a thus-gone one.Form, feeling , perception,Consciousness, and intentionAre the countless thus-gone ones;Th ey are the great sage.Th e Vimalakīrti Sūtra says:Disturbing emotions are the lineage of the thus-gone ones.And:Th e teaching that freedom from desire and other such factors is liberation is taught forh arrogant individuals; the liberation of selfl ess individuals is taught to be the nature of desire and other such factors.Moreover, affl ictive emotions themselves are taught to be wisdom in certain scriptures, such as the Sūtra of Mañjuśrī’s Display, which says:Disturbing emotions are the vajra bases of awakening. For instance, the Sūtra of the Emanations of Mañjuśrī says:Nirvāṇa is not something that is cultivated through abandoning saṃsāra. Instead, nirvāṇa is to observe saṃsāra itself.Th is shows that saṃsāra is enlightenment. Also, the Avataṃsakasūtra states: Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 63Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 633/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64 luminous essenceTh ough numerous worlds may burn In the most inconceivable ways, Space will not disintegrate.Such is the case with self-occurring wisdom. Citations such as this teach self-occurring wisdom. Moreover, the sūtras teach that all sentient beings possess the core of self-occurring wisdom. Th ere are also countless statements that explain how, although Buddha Śākyamuni’s realm is always pure, it is not seen as such. Th ere are even statements in sūtras about pleasing the Buddha with a woman’s body:A Bodhisattva should transform his own body into a female body in order to please the Th us-Gone One and then always remain before the Th us-Gone One.Th ere are also many statements that teach how to compassionately annihilate people, such as those who harm the dharma.Regardless of whether the situation calls for scriptural citations, such as the one just mentioned, or logical analysis, all phenomena—as they appear—are naturally purity and equality. Th erefore, they are not established as saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, good and evil, or in terms of rejection and acceptance. As was explained before, secret mantra is proven to be the supreme vehicle. It is cer-tain that from the moment you accept emptiness, purity can also gradually be established.Again, there may be some for whom most of the mantra explanations make sense, but for whom the meaning of the actionless great perfection seems unreasonable. On this issue, scripturally, the unsurpassable tantras teach that sentient beings are of the identity of enlightenment, and that the aggre-gates, elements, and other such factors are pure in the sense of being divine. Th ese scriptures also prove how one does not truly need to rely on activities involving maṇḍalas, tormas, and so on. Th ey also point out the wisdom in the fourth empowerment. Reasoning establishes the world and its inhabitants to be a primordial purity and equality. Th erefore, one does not need to accomplish these fac-tors anew through the path. For people who have realized this in the core of their hearts, a regimen of eff ortful pursuits is proven to be a great obstacle Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 64Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 643/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"luminous essence 65to the path. Hence, it can easily be established how the practice of uncon-trived naturalness allows one to attain mastery over the self-display of wis-dom appearances. In this way, subsequent points will not be established unless the points that precede them are proven as well. In teaching a sequence of vehicles that are like the rungs of a ladder, the Buddha showed how to cleanse the jewel of the basic potential. If one were to explain the profound secret to narrow-minded people who have yet to gain confi dence in more basic topics, they will give it up or disparage it out of fear. Th erefore, these instructions are extremely secret. If, on the other hand, the profound realization of the view of the unsur-passable mantra is taught to those who have gained confi dence in the mean-ing of great equality as explained in the sūtra vehicle, it will make sense to them. Th erefore, being well versed in all the gradual vehicles will enable one to establish the fi nal philosophy of the vajra pinnacle. Th ough endless when examined in detail, these explanations are meant to be a mere gateway into reasoning.4. PurposeTh e view serves both a both a general and a specifi c purpose.1. General PurposeWhile on the path, all practices are accessed according to one’s own personal view. Th is is the nature of things. Th us, all practices of the vajra vehicle are exclusively practiced according to one’s understanding of the principles of purity and equality. Th is view is like the capacity to see. Without it, aware-ness and “legs” will be missing as well. In this way, meditation and other such factors of the path will be a mere facade. On the other hand, any practice that is imbued with an authentic view such as this will become the true path of the vajra vehicle. As the key point of all paths comes down to this alone, it is of paramount importance.2. Specifi c PurposeEverything unfolds through the force of the view: meditation becomes unmistaken, conduct meaningful, the maṇḍala accords with reality, and the attainment comes through the bestowal of empowerment. Likewise, it Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 65Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 653/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66 luminous essencebecomes diffi cult to transgress the samayas, the practice will not be squan-dered, off erings become completely pure, mastery is gained over enlightened activity, and mudrās and mantras become sublime. If all phenomena were not purity and equality, meditating on the divine nature of the world and its inhabitants, the support and the supported, would be a form of training that confl icted with reality and one’s meditation would be mistaken. However, since one is meditating on the way things are, this is not the case and the practice is not mistaken. Th e same goes for conduct. If there is purity and equality, it is reasonable to engage in actions that accord with the view, such as the disciplined conduct of freely enjoying sense pleasures, being free from accepting and rejecting, and engaging in union and liberation. Were this not the case, it would be true that these are all to be abandoned, as is stated in the common vehicles, and engaging in them would be immoral. Th erefore, it is due to the essential point of purity and equality that these mantric practices become meaningful.Regarding the maṇḍala, the natural maṇḍala of the inseparable ground and fruition is represented by the symbolic maṇḍala and the maṇḍala of the path. Th e fruitional maṇḍala appears due to the path. However, if the ground were not like this, the path would not be authentic either, and no pure frui-tion could appear from it. By resolving the ground exactly as it is, the maṇḍala accords with reality.As for empowerment, one’s own body, speech, and mind, along with their equal aspects, dwell primordially as the four vajras. Th is is to be understood, experienced, and realized through the power of the empowerment, just like a vase seen with the help of a lamp or the moon pointed out by a fi nger. Apart from this nature, there is no meaning to be pointed out through the empow-erment. Th us, the attainments derived from empowerment likewise depend on the view.In terms of the samayas of mantra, it is said that one should not doubt the explanations that all phenomena are naturally pure as the deity, nor should one conceptualize equality, which lies beyond names and other such factors, by identifying it with characteristics. If all phenomena were not purity and equality, whoever perceived them to lack these qualities would be in accord with reality and, thus, would not be committing a root downfall of mantra. Th is would also not accord with teachings given in the context of the path of freedom from desire. Moreover, the samayas of conduct, such as not mortifying the aggregates Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 66Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 663/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"luminous essence 67and joyfully accepting sense pleasures, samaya substances, and mudrās are in accord with purity and equality. Were this not the case, they would truly be as explained in the lower vehicles. It would, therefore, not make sense that one would commit a root downfall by abandoning something that ought to be rejected. Th erefore, one would be free to transgress the pledges of man-tra. However, due to the essential point that everything is pure and equal, the samayas should defi nitely not be transgressed by turning away from the view and the actions that are played out from that view. Consequently, the sama-yas are hard to transgress.In practice, the deity is inseparable from the aggregates, elements, and sense sources. If this is their natural state, then it makes sense to actualize this state as it is by practicing the path. Were this not the case, however, it would be like trying to wash charcoal white or meditating that mind is matter . . . no matter how much one were to try, there would be no change. Since it would then become impossible to accomplish the deity’s indivisibility, one’s prac-tice would be squandered. However, through the key point of purity and equality, practice is not wasted in this manner. As for making off erings, the fi ve types of meat, the fi ve nectars and other substances that the world considers dirty are used as principal off erings in mantra. If they were actually impure, off ering them to the deities would not be a viable option. Still, one may believe that blessing them with man-tras and mūdras makes them pure. If this were the case, then it would make better sense to off er pure things and bless them with mantras and mūdras. What special purpose would there be in off ering impure things? Th erefore, although it is fi ne to practice cleanliness as taught in action tantra, in this context the fi ve nectars and other substances should be utilized to dismantle the notions of pure/impure and acceptance/rejection. Since these substances also manifest through the key point of natural purity and equality, they are completely pure as off erings.Regarding enlightened activity, according to inner mantra one imagines oneself to be primordially indivisible from the enlightened body, speech, and mind of the thus-gone ones, and one practices specifi c activities thereby. Th ese activities become supremely powerful, matching the enlightened deeds of the thus-gone ones. If one were not essentially divine from the beginning, mentally fabricating something that does not accord with reality would not accomplish anything of superior value. However, since everyone is of the nature of great purity and equality, we are all inseparable from the deity in Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 67Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 673/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68 luminous essencereality. Since the practices of inner mantra are superior to the approach of action tantra and other systems, one is able to gain mastery over the activi-ties of enlightenment.Mantra and mūdra are more powerful than the locks and recitations of outer mantra. Th is superiority is due to the force of maintaining the prac-tice of habituating oneself to the realization of one’s own indivisibility from the deity. If they did not accord with reality, then reciting mantras and per-forming mudrās as outlined in the inner mantras would not by nature hold greater blessings than reciting the Buddha’s dhāraṇī. However, the mantras and mūdras that are connected to the development and completion stages of unsurpassable mantra possess the perfect power of great blessings, for they are accomplished through the ability to unerringly engage with the meaning of great purity and equality.Th erefore, as the actual nature of things, great purity and equality are the objects one must resolve through the view. Th is key point establishes the meditations and other practices of mantra to be of an unmistaken nature and constituting a delightful and swift path. Th rough the view that realizes the meaning of purity and equality, one arrives at supreme confi dence in all paths of mantra. With this confi dence, all paths embraced by this view become authentic paths of mantra. Th is concludes the brief explanation of the view of perfect knowledge, the fi rst parameter in secret mantra. 2. AbsorptionAbsorption will be presented in terms of its (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) prac-tice, and (4) purpose. 1. EssenceWhoever tames the crazed elephant of the mindBy placing it in equanimityAnd fully relies on mantra and mudrāWill reap a great and wonderful spiritual attainment. As this verse explains, the Sanskrit word samādhi means a balanced mind. It means to train the mind such that one is able to rest one-pointedly on an observed object. It can also mean to rest in accordance with, or in the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 68Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 683/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"luminous essence 69same manner as, an object undisturbed by dullness, agitation, and other such factors.2. DivisionsTh is topic has two divisions: (1) essential divisions and (2) temporal divi-sions.1. Essential DivisionsTh e essential division concerns the absorptions of development and comple-tion. Development stage meditation has four divisions, each of which puri-fi es the predispositions related to one of the four types of birth. Th e elaborate version consists of making others one’s own children, becoming the child of others, developing the fi ve manifestations of enlightenment, and developing the fourfold vajra ritual. Th e medium-length version makes use of a threefold development ritual. In the condensed version, which is employed in anuyoga, the mere recitation of mantra triggers the visualization. In the extremely con-densed version, as found in atiyoga, one completes the process of develop-ment in an instant of recollection.Alternatively, in conformity with womb birth and miraculous birth, a dual division of the development stage into gradual and instantaneous approaches is also taught. Moreover, there is also a fi vefold distinction that follows the fi ve gradual practices, such as that of great emptiness. Th ere are, in fact, a great number of other divisions, such as the absorptions that observe the meaning of the four seals of enlightened body, speech, mind, and activity. In actual-ity, however, all practices that are classifi ed as development stage are termed “development stage absorptions.” Th e completion stage consists of the path of means and the path of liber-ation. Th e former may rely upon the upper and lower gates, while the latter consists of the gradual and instantaneous nonconceptual practices of unity.2. Temporal DivisionsAbsorption can be divided temporally into blessed practice, imputed prac-tice, and perfect practice. Th e ultimate deity is indivisible basic space and wis-dom. Th rough its power, the symbolic deity of the form body appears. If one visualizes such a deity, one’s own essential nature will be blessed by the essen-tial nature of the deity.

Second, one trains to become competent with the understanding that the form body is produced from the pure awakened mind, just as one creates a statue from melted gold. Th ird, a practitioner who has realized his or her nature to be pure perfects the absorption instantaneously, just like a refl ection clearly appearing in a limpid pond. As the Magical Net of Vairocana mentions, these three trainings embody, not only the entirety of mantra, but also the vehicle of characteristics belong-ing to the listeners, Mind Only, and the Middle Way.3. Th e Practice of Meditative AbsorptionNot only are the calm abiding meditations that are based on the unique methods of mantra deeply meaningful and easy to practice, the way they are practiced is also common to the sūtra approach. In both cases, one must gain the stability of a pliant mind and then proceed to develop it in a progressive manner. Moreover, by relying on the eight formative mental states that dispel the fi ve fl aws, one uses the six powers to meditate step-by-step on the nine methods for resting the mind. Th is takes place within the context of the four types of attention, allowing one to gradually produce the fi ve experi-ences of meditative concentration and, thereby, accomplish the pliancy of calm abiding. Th e Five FlawsTh e fi ve fl aws that inhibit meditative concentration are (1) laziness, (2) for-getting the instructions, (3) dullness and agitation, (4) failure to apply their antidotes, and (5) applying these antidotes even though one is not dull or agi-tated. Of these, the fi rst two prevent the initial stages of entering absorption, the third hinders the main practice of absorption, and the last two prevent absorption from deepening. Th e Eight RemediesTh ere are eight remedies that dispel these fl aws: (1) faith, (2) yearning, (3) exertion, (4) profi ciency, (5) mindfulness, (6) introspection, (7) attention, and (8) equanimity. Th e fi rst four dispel laziness. Faith in the attainment of absorption produces yearning and sincere interest. Th is, in turn, spurs one Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 70Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 703/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"luminous essence 71to exert oneself, and one thereby becomes profi cient and abandons laziness. Mindfulness ensures that the instructions are not forgotten, while introspec-tion allows one to notice when dullness and agitation occur. When they do, attention enables one to apply their respective antidotes. As dullness and agi-tation subside, one rests in equanimity without forming any concepts. In this way, these eight factors remedy forgetting the instructions and the rest of the faults in a progressive manner.Th e Six PowersSix powers are required to practice absorption in this manner: (1) study, (2) contemplation, (3) mindfulness, (4) introspection, (5) diligence, and (6) com-plete familiarity. Th ese powers should gradually accomplish the nine meth-ods for resting the mind within the context of the four types of attention. Th e Four Types of AttentionTh e four types of attention are: (1) concentrated attention, (2) occasional attention, (3) uninterrupted attention, and (4) eff ortless attention. Th e Nine Methods for Resting the MindTh e nine methods for resting the mind are: (1) settling, (2) continuous set-tling, (3) resettling, (4) completely settling, (5) taming, (6) pacifying, (7) completely pacifying, (8) attentiveness, and (9) equipoise. Th ese nine are mentioned in a sūtra, which states, “settling, genuinely settling, collecting and settling, thoroughly settling, taming, pacifying, thoroughly pacifying, one-pointed, and absorbed.” To elaborate, study leads to settling ; contem-plation to continuous settling ; mindfulness to resettling and completely settling ; introspection to taming and pacifying ; diligence to completely pac-ifying and one-pointedness; and complete familiarity leads to equipoise. In this regard, the fi rst attention relates to the occasion of the fi rst two mental states; the second attention to the third to seventh; the third attention to the eighth; and the fourth to the ninth. Th ese nine states are also said to unfold by way of fi ve experiences. First is the experience of movement, which is like a cascading waterfall. Second is the experience of attainment, which is like a river gushing through a gorge. Th ird is the experience of familiarity, which is like the fl ow of a large river. Fourth is the experience of stability, which is like a wave-free ocean. Fift h is the expe-rience of completion, which is like a mountain.

SettlingFirst, instructions are given on the shortcomings of not attaining medita-tive concentration, the benefi ts of attaining it, and the way to rest the mind. Hearing this arouses faith, yearning, and a very disciplined eff ort, whereby one is rid of laziness and other such faults. Attention is then placed on the observed object according to the systems of development and completion. Th is is the fi rst method of settling. 2. Continuous SettlingWhen this takes place, one’s attention will not rest for even a moment. Instead, it will move around like lightning. Still, one should give rise to a joy-ful persistence and continue the training. All possible eff ort should be put into continuously settling on the initial observed object, contemplating the meaning of the instructions on absorption that one has received. Th is is the second method of continuous settling. 3. ResettlingIt may be diffi cult to rest continuously when practicing these fi rst two meth-ods. However, with concentration and focused attention, one will be able to develop continuity. Whenever the mind moves about like a shooting star and becomes distracted from its initial observation, one should use mindful-ness to gain composure and resettle, as if channeling a strong river. Th is is the third method of resettling. Th e experience of movement unfolds when practicing these fi rst three methods for resting the mind. Th is experience may be likened to a piece of paper carried off by a storm, or to a cascading waterfall. Accordingly, since at this point one’s thoughts are very strong , it will be hard to fi nd any moments of rest and it may feel as if one is trying to construct a dam in the middle of a fi erce river. Nonetheless, one should continue to apply extraor-dinary eff ort without losing heart. Th e wild horse of the mind is exceedingly diffi cult to tame; it must be tightly bound with the rope of mindfulness, placed in the corral of carefree equanimity, and steered with the bridle of diligence.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 72Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 723/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"luminous essence 734. Completely SettlingOnce one’s mindfulness increases slightly in strength, one will be able to rest one’s attention on the observed object, although merely in a vague man-ner. Th is is the beginning of lesser mental stability. At this time, one’s atten-tion should be directed one-pointedly inward so one can settle fully on the observed object alone. Th is is the fourth method of completely settling. Th is occasion is similar to birds circling around a carcass. As they hover in the air, they do not move away from the carcass once they have their eyes on it. However, once they descend on the meal, they are unable to remain there and continue to fl y around and circle the carcass. In the same way, at this stage one’s mind begins to slightly circle its observed object. Hence, the most important thing at this point is to strengthen the continuity of mind-fulness.5. TamingAs one naturally develops a small measure of joy in meditative absorption, one’s interest in resting the mind will grow. Th is is likened to a bee that quickly fl ies around and drinks nectar without staying in one place for long. At this stage, one will be able to tame slightly the endless conceptual move-ments prevalent in prior stages. Th is is the fi ft h method of taming.Compared to the initial stages, it is somewhat easier to rest one’s mind during the stages of completely settling and taming. For this reason, they are also referred to as “the experience of attainment.” Th is is also the very begin-ning of the initial development of meditative absorption, or the attainment of slight warmth. Exemplifi ed by a river fl owing through a gorge, this state involves many subtle concepts that form a continuous, strong turbulence. Nevertheless, as the examples show, compared to the waterfall, the river in the gorge is slightly calmer. When a bee is caught in a bottle, it has nowhere else to go until freed. Nevertheless, it will continue to move about inside the bottle without settling down. In the same way, in the context of taming when the mind is directed toward an observed object, the mind will not lose its observed object, yet the constant movement of conceptual activity will remain. At this point, it is important to be attentive and not waver from this state of observation.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 73Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 733/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"74 luminous essence6. PacifyingTo eliminate dullness and agitation, one should remain mindful while rest-ing attentively. Th is will allow one to apply their respective remedies in the correct manner so that the variety of concepts that hinder this process may be naturally reduced and pacifi ed. Th is is the sixth method of pacifying.7. Completely PacifyingOnce this process elicits a peaceful state, it will be as though the muddy water of dullness and agitation has been purifi ed and these faults have disappeared. Like someone recovered from an illness, one will rest attentively and undis-turbed in a state of equanimity. Th e previous slight pacifi cation of thoughts will be strengthened and thoughts will now be clearly distinguished. Even the secondary disturbing emotions will be nearly pacifi ed, like muddy water gradually purifi ed. Distraction, moreover, will no longer occur. Th is is the seventh method of completely pacifying. Th e experience of meditation that occurs once the fault of distraction is left behind during the two stages of pacifying and completely pacifying is said to be like a river. From afar, a gently fl owing river may appear to be unmov-ing , but from its bank it will be seen to be in constant motion. In the same way, even though the mind may appear to be settled, careful observation will reveal the occurrence of many subtle fl uctuations. At this point, it is crucial to be diligent and develop this further.8. AttentiveFrom the stage of resettling all the way up to this point, it is necessary to be attentive by engaging the observed object every time dullness and agita-tion create obstacles. Consequently, the major key point is to tame oneself as much as possible through introspection, contemplation, and equanimity. By mustering diligence, one will now be more advanced than before. So long as one does not forsake exertion, thoughts will be unable to create obstacles and one will rest one-pointedly on the observed object. Th is stage, referred to as being attentive or one-pointed, is the eighth method. Th e experience that comes through gaining stability in this is said to be like a wave-free ocean.9. Resting in EquanimityAt this stage, one will be able to rest on the observed object and attention will be maintained uninterruptedly through exertion. It is important to rest Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 74Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 743/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"luminous essence 75in equanimity on the observed object at this point. As attention continues to develop, one will no longer need to expend any eff ort. Instead, a self-per-petuating state of equanimity will occur. Th is ninth and fi nal method is the attainment of mental rest. Th is state, also known as “the one-pointed mind of the desire realm,” is attained through the process of familiarization and expe-rience that occurs on the preceding levels. Th e fi nal mountain-like experience of immutability begins to unfold at this point. When this one-pointed mind of the desire realm is accomplished, the mind blends eff ortlessly with the observed object that has been held in mind. Th roughout all activities, the mind will now rest automatically. If the mind is allowed to rest on its own without thinking , appearances will cease and an experience will occur in which it seems as though one’s mind and space have blended. When emerging from this experience, it will feel as though the body has suddenly materialized, and attachment, anger, and other emotions will weaken and become less frequent during the ensuing attainment. At this point, various experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonthought may occur. During intense experiences of clarity, for example, it may feel as if one can even count the subtle particles within pillars and other such objects. It may also seem as though one’s sleep has mingled with meditative absorp-tion, while dreams, for the most part, will be purifi ed. Since this type of meditative absorption can relate to the features of either the truths or sub-tlety and crudeness, it forms the basis for the common path of both non-Buddhists and Buddhists. As such, it is something one should accomplish. Nevertheless, unless it is imbued with pliancy, it will not be true calm abid-ing, much less insight. Moreover, one should be aware that the meditative experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonthought may or may not involve equi-poise in suchness. One should, therefore, know the key points of the path and not conceitedly take a few experiences of the resting mind to be a sub-lime path. By familiarizing oneself with this state of the one-pointed mind of the desire realm, the body and mind will become pliable, an achievement referred to as “profi ciency.” Once the mind has been tamed like a horse, one will become one’s own master and be able to engage a virtuous focus for as long as one wishes. In being free from assuming negative states, such as the unpleasantness of weariness, one will be happy. Th is, in turn, will cause pos-itive energ y to spread throughout the body, ridding it of the negativity that impairs its functioning, such as feelings of physical heaviness. Th e spine will Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 75Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 753/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76 luminous essencebe straight like a stack of golden coins and the body will feel as light as cot-ton. One will also feel blissful, as though a stream of warm milk is suddenly fi lling the entire body. Th e body, moreover, will become exceedingly pliable and capable of engaging in any virtuous activity. In the beginning, this type of advanced pliability will occur at a gross level, and then grow increasingly subtle. Th is gross pliability will start out small before eventually manifesting clearly and completely. Since gross pli-ability causes the mind to stir, the mind gradually diminishes in strength. Th en a subtle and delicate shadow-like pliability will appear that accords with unmoving meditative absorption. Th is is what we refer to as “calm abiding.” Whether one trains in the development or completion stage, this approach will ensure that one’s practice is genuine. Th e teaching on this system constitutes the elaborate explanation of the practice of meditative absorption. Absorption can also be summarized as follows: With enthusiasm directed toward meditative absorption, attention should be placed on the observed object. One then exerts oneself uninterruptedly, maintaining mindfulness continuously and dispelling dullness and agitation through introspection. When free of faults, one will remain in equanimity. Practicing repeatedly with enthusiasm, exertion, mindfulness, introspection, and equanimity will lead you naturally to a state of nondistraction. Th e practice will fi nally be accomplished once you can rest well without any movement. Alternatively, you can practice in a fourfold manner by settling with enthusiasm, giving rise to eff ort, guarding with introspection, and resting in equanimity; or in an even more condensed manner by simply settling on the observed object as long as you can. Th us, there are several levels of instructions.4. Purpose Th e meaning ascertained by the view of great purity and equality can only be applied correctly to one’s own being once the strength of meditative absorp-tion has been perfected. For this reason, meditative absorption is extremely important. It is the primary cause for accomplishing activity and spiri-tual attainments, both of which require awareness and stability. Still, even though there are many who conceitedly profess to have attained the noble path through platitudes and empty words, it is rare to fi nd someone who has accomplished even the one-pointed mind of the desire realm. Th e current scarcity of people practicing even the smallest activity of mantra is due to a Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 76Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 763/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"luminous essence 77lack of meditative absorption. Th erefore, those who wish for activities and spiritual attainments should persevere in meditative absorption. In short, through meditative absorption one can engage the meaning of the view. As one progresses, conduct manifests. Th is is also how one observes the samayas and what makes the maṇḍala appear. If one possesses medita-tive absorption, one can grant empowerment, gain accomplishment, perform activities, and make off erings. Meditative absorption is what blesses mantra and mudrā. Th us, it encompasses all of these factors. As one gains confi dence in the meaning that all phenomena are great purity and equality by their very nature, one will move beyond the boundaries of meditation and nonmedita-tion. Th is eff ortless and spontaneously present practice is the consummation of the great perfection. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence says:Th e way of utterly pure basic space is itselfMastery of this and enjoyment of that.Th erefore, self, other, and the continuity of conceptsAre purifi ed in the supreme, unsurpassed vehicle.Th e Gathering of Secrets says:As there are no entities, there is no meditation.Meditation is nonmeditation itself.As such, these entities and nonentitiesAre not observed in meditation.Th is concludes the explanation of meditative absorption, the perfection of meditative concentration.3. ConductConduct is discussed in terms of its (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) principles, and (4) purpose. 1. EssenceTh e spiritual attainments of the mantra-wielding practitionerAre spontaneously present as perfect equality.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 77Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 773/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78 luminous essenceSince conduct is utterly unimpeded,Everything is primordially indivisible.Conduct is a translation of the Sanskrit word carya. Th is term refers to all physical, verbal, and mental actions of a mantra practitioner who correctly engages in the tasks to be performed while embracing his or her conduct with unique methods and knowledge.2. DivisionsIn terms of support, conduct can be divided into physical, verbal, and men-tal acts. In terms of its essence, there is a twofold division: the disciplined conduct of the path of means and the conscientious conduct of the path of liberation. Th e former refers to the general common activities and the spe-cial activities of union and liberation. Concerning the latter, on the path of liberation there are seven types of conduct, including the conduct of having faith and being diligent. Th ese forms of conduct are for individuals of a grad-ual inclination. Th ere is also said to be an eighth activity, conduct free from acceptance and rejection, which is meant for individuals of an instantaneous inclination. Th ere are also a great number of other ways to divide conduct. One such example is the training in absorption during meditative equipoise and seeing all appearances as illusion during the ensuing attainment, whereby one freely enjoys the sense pleasures. Nevertheless, conduct is normally clas-sifi ed under the rubric of the ensuing attainment. Th ere are also various activities that relate to the process of attaining inter-nal heat and progressing in practice. One set of divisions classifi es conduct using the terms elaborate, unelaborate, and extremely unelaborate. Another classifi cation is made in terms of the youthful activity of beginning men-dicants, the disciplined conduct of a madman able to bear hardships, and the royal activity of a ruler who has attained stability. Yet another system speaks of the conduct of vibration and the ever-excellent conduct of univer-sal victory. In this way, there are numerous systems for naming and classify-ing conduct.In terms of time, there are three forms of conduct: the initial conduct of engagement, the interim conduct of attaining the spiritual attainments, and the fi nal conduct of accomplishment. Th e fi rst of these refers to serving the master, receiving empowerment, upholding the samayas, receiving instruc-tions on practice, and not transgressing the guru’s command. Th e second division refers to the various aspects of approach and accomplishment.

Th ese three divisions encompass all the paths of the vajra vehicle.3. PrinciplesTh is section has a general and a specifi c discussion. Concerning the fi rst, one may think, “In the common vehicles, the sense pleasures are taught to be obstacles to the path. Why is it that here they are to be taken up?” Since all phenomena dwell as the great bliss of equality and purity, there is nothing to observe in terms of accepting or rejecting. Th e path of abiding in what-ever one desires in harmony with the realization of this nature bestows liber-ation quickly and easily, like magic. Moreover, with this approach liberation does not require acts of asceticism or other forms of hardship. Such acts only create obstacles. For this reason, it is said to be a root downfall if a mantra practitioner feels contempt for and mortifi es his or her own body. Th erefore, although one joyfully partakes in sense pleasures, this approach is superior to the common vehicles because one applies the key points of masterful meth-ods and nondeluded knowledge. Th e Vajra Ḍākinī states:Th e horrible ties of ascetic disciplineDeprive the body and create misery. Misery will only distract the mind,And distraction transforms the spiritual attainments. Th e Yogini Tantra of Conduct explains:When in possession of the nondual wisdom mind,Th ere is nothing forbidden at all. With a nonconceptual mind,Th e fi ve sense pleasures are enjoyed.Th e End of Magic states:Th e fruition of nondualityIs not attained aft er innumerable eonsOf painful ascetic discipline,But in this life, through happiness and pleasure.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 79Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 793/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80 luminous essenceNot only that, even a sūtra says:Just as the manure of the city dwellers’ excrementBenefi ts fi elds of sugarcane,Th e manure of a bodhisattva’s disturbing emotionsBenefi ts the accomplishment of the Buddha’s teachings.Th e specifi c discussion establishes the principles of union through knowl-edge and liberation through method. Concerning the fi rst, some individuals enter the vehicle of mantra but nevertheless fail to take an interest in the mag-nifi cent conduct of mantra and scorn the practice of union. Th is is a grave mistake. As a cause for the sudden dawning of co-emergent wisdom, the karma mudrā and the supportive jasmine-like bodhicitta are indispensable. To give them up is, therefore, said to be a root downfall of mantra. Union, moreover, is said to be the wonderful conduct of knowledge. Th e meaning of the co-emergent, natural state, which the common paths take innumerable eons to realize, dwells primordially within oneself. It is directly perceived through these methods by intelligent people who are knowledgeable about the essential points of the teacher’s key instructions. With this knowledge, all dualistic thoughts are bound within the nondual state of basic space and wisdom, hence the term “nondual union.” On this topic, the Great Bliss Union of the Buddhas states:Among all wonders,Th e wonder of the female is the greatest.And in the Saṃbhuṭa:Th erefore, what is the use of anything more extensive?For the concise leads to buddhahood itself.Th e very buddhahood that is attainedTh rough countless billions of eons,Th rough this sacred blissCan be attained in this very life.Likewise, the Tantra of the Single Ferocious Hero states:Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 80Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 803/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"luminous essence 81Th ere is no evil greater than action without desire. Th ere is no merit greater than bliss.Th erefore, settle the mind in equipoiseAnd give rise to the bliss of desire.Again, the Compendium of Vajra Wisdom explains: Without the manifest conditioning of milk and sesame seeds, but-ter and sesame oil do not form. Likewise, without joining the vajra and the lotus, which are manifestly conditioned by mantra and mudrā, the three cognitions cannot be illustrated. One will not achieve the absorption of great bliss without being able to genu-inely join the bhaga and liṅga. Simply by having intense interest exclusively in the absorption of great bliss will lead one to the level of a beginner and the training of a nonreturner.Second, neither should one have misgivings about the supreme method of liberation. Th ere are individuals who turn away from the three jewels, accu-mulate the gravest of negative actions, and for whom no other remedy works. Consequently, that person will forever wander without refuge in the lower realms. However, if one is motivated by an unparalleled compassion, one can sever the continuity of the life force of these individuals with negative karma using the profound method of mantra and liberate them with ease. In this way, a practitioner with confi dence in the view of equality who has perfected the strength of training in the two stages is able to capture the life force of the liberated one and bring about the fruition of the triple satisfac-tion. Such potent conduct can be of great benefi t to both oneself and others and is more marvelous and amazing than other forms of conduct in the man-tra tradition. It is said that if one fails to perform this sort of liberation when the time is right, one will be committing a root downfall. Moreover, having understood this correctly, even a mere interest in this practice will bring innu-merable benefi ts.Th ese days there are many people who ferociously brandish their kīla dagger at a dough effi g y, but few are those who can summon the cause—severe karma and disturbing emotions—and the result—the beings of the three lower realms—into the support and then apply themselves in a genuine Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 81Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 813/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"82 luminous essencemanner to transference by means of the mantric ritual of liberation. Never-theless, even if one merely performs an approximation of the liberation rit-ual innumerable benefi ts will still occur. Since one relies on a motivation of unparalleled compassion and a conduct that is skilled in the methods of man-tra, this is unequaled by common forms of mind training and ordinary med-itation practices.Th e Compendium of Secrets explains further:Th ose who despise the vajra master,And those who revile the great and supreme vehicleShould be killed with great eff ortOr removed from this place.In this way, one attains supreme enlightenment, Th e accomplishment of mantra.While the Tantra of Red Yamantaka states:Oh! Th ose to be killed are benefi ted,For the victim is not killed.So long as they are caused to be liberated from sin,Th e one who passes away will not die.Th ose who have committed a thousand sinsWill not be born in hells such as Ultimate Torment.Amazing! A great being attains buddhahoodAnd enlightenment through killing.Again, with love, kill sentient beingsWho should be killed!Amazing!

PurposeIn general, the purpose of conduct is to attain the temporal and ultimate spiritual attainments. Specifi cally, in relevant situations, profound conduct with a proximate cause supremely enhances realization within one’s being , through which one quickly attains buddhahood. In short, conduct refers to all the various activities of the ensuing attainment that are in harmony with the practice of view and meditation. It also includes entering and med-itating on the profound maṇḍala, drawing images of the maṇḍala, receiving and bestowing empowerment, abiding by the samayas, performing approach and accomplishment, making off erings to please the deities, accomplishing enlightened activity, reciting mantras, and holding mudrās. Since these are all instances of conduct, conduct encompasses them all.Ultimately, all appearances and activities—whatever appears and is done—are exclusively the play of reality, the indivisible truths of purity and equality. When this is experienced, one transcends the extremes of action and nonac-tion. To naturally sustain this innate conduct of self-manifestation and self-liberation is the conduct of practitioners of the great perfection. Th is is the culmination of all forms of conduct. On this topic, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Primordially unborn suchnessIs illusory in appearance like an apparition.Th ough union, liberation, and all other actsAre performed, not the slightest thing is done.Th rough this, one will be patient when it comes to undertaking the profound activities of mantra. As this form of patience engages in all appearances and activities as the play of wisdom, it is said to be the perfection of patience. Th is concludes the explanation of conduct.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 83Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 833/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"84 luminous essence4. MaṇḍalaMaṇḍala will be discussed in terms of its (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) princi-ple, and (4) purpose. 1. EssenceFrom nonseparation comes separation.Th e inner and external-inner maṇḍalasAre the inconceivable play of wisdom,Th e supreme mudrā of the fearless Samantabhadra.In Sanskrit, maṇḍa means “essence” or “quintessence,” while la means to “hold” or “uphold.” Th us, the word means “the ground that holds essen-tial qualities.” Alternatively, if one takes the word as a whole and directly translates it, it means “completely round” or “full circle.” For this reason, it is called kyilkhor (“center and circle”) in Tibetan, referring to a chief fi gure surrounded by a retinue, or the Transcendent Conqueror Dharma King, along with his retinue and palace. Hence, in this context, a maṇḍala is the ground that upholds supreme qualities and appears as the embodiment of the completely pure support and supported.2. DivisionsMaṇḍalas can be divided in terms of ground, path, and fruition. Th e natu-ral maṇḍala of the ground refers to the primordial divine nature of the world and its inhabitants, the support and supported. Th is can be divided further, starting with the maṇḍala of a single family and all the way up to the maṇḍala of the inconceivable magical net. Its essence, the indivisible truths of purity and equality, arises as the unimpeded array that assists those in need.Th e maṇḍala of meditation on the path consists of the symbolic represen-tational maṇḍala and the symbolized actual maṇḍala of enlightened body, speech, and mind. Th e former refers to maṇḍalas of colored sand, paintings, drawings, and heaps. As for the latter, the maṇḍala of enlightened body is one’s own body visualized as a deity—from a sole hero to the entire maṇḍala with deities and a palace. Th e maṇḍala of enlightened speech is the visual-ization of the mantras of the central deity and the retinue, and the recitation of the mantra. Th e maṇḍala of enlightened mind is to bring the fi ve poisons onto the path as the fi ve wisdoms, thus not abandoning saṃsāra, but bring-ing about a fundamental purifi cation.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 84Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 843/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"luminous essence 85Th e maṇḍala of the perfected fruition is the state in which the bodies are without meeting and parting once the path has been perfected and the state of Samantabhadra has been attained. Further divisions can also be made, such as the maṇḍalas of the three bod-ies, the maṇḍalas of the fi ve wisdoms, and the maṇḍalas of enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities. Th ere are other classifi cations as well, including a sevenfold division, but these are all subsumed under the afore-mentioned maṇḍalas of enlightened body, speech, and mind.Another threefold classifi cation is as follows: Th e maṇḍala of the support is the palace. Th is maṇḍala is arrayed in various directions and completely surrounds a center—the perfect place. Th e maṇḍala of the supported refers to deities and consists of a main deity surrounded by his or her divine reti-nue—the perfect teacher and retinue. Th e nondual great wisdom maṇḍala consists of self-occurring wisdom and a retinue of mindful cognition. More-over, the indwelling wisdom, free from any instigating dualistic conceptual fl uctuations, is taught to be Samantabhadra. Th e concepts that emerge from this state, such as the fi ve poisons, are taught to be the expression of wisdom in the form of the forty-two buddhas, such as the fi ve thus-gone ones. Th e stillness and fl uctuations of awareness are said to be the primordial maṇḍala. Th is constitutes the perfect teaching and time. Th ere are also numerous other ways to make divisions, such as the three maṇḍalas of nature, meditative absorption, and symbols, and the four vajra maṇḍalas of enlightened body, speech, mind, and wisdom.Th e latter section of the Tantra of the Secret Essence presents seven maṇḍalas:Th is teaches the natural maṇḍala,Representations, exalted representations,Meditative absorption, superior meditative absorption,Awakened mind, and supreme assembly.Th e natural maṇḍala can be divided into the maṇḍala of the ground, which is the natural state of primordial purity of all phenomena, and the maṇḍala of the consummate fruition, which refers to the actualized ground, as it is, once one is free of temporary stains. In reality, however, the maṇḍala of great purity and equality, in which ground and fruition are indivisible, is the unfab-ricated and spontaneously present natural maṇḍala.

Th is refers to the appearances of the impure phenomena of saṃsāra, which are so-called because their essence is primordially pure and their features resemble the pure support and sup-ported.Th ird is the superior representative maṇḍala. Th is is the form of the pal-ace made from colored sand, and other things that illustrate the pure sup-port and supported. Th ese symbolic signs—such as statues, scriptures, and stūpas—are more exalted than the signs of saṃsāra in a conventional sense, which is why they are called the superior representative maṇḍala.Th ere are three stages to drawing a superior representative maṇḍala for use in an empowerment ritual or sādhana practice: the preliminaries, main part, and conclusion. For the preliminaries, one should fi rst analyze the area by investigating the sky, ground, and atmosphere. If the place is deemed suitable, one should then request permission to use it from the owner, whether appar-ent or not. Next, one should imagine the ritual dagger to be the Lotus Kīlaya and use it as a stake to subdue the area. Th en one should look for snakes, hide treasures, and make the area level. Th e place should then be purifi ed through plastering , fi re off ering , mantra, mudrā, and absorption. Next, the bound-aries should be set with the fi ve types of weapons, thereby protecting the land. As the light that shines from the play of the male and female deities dis-solves into the ground, one should imagine that it becomes the nature of the maṇḍala and, in this way, takes hold of the ground. Th ese six successive activ-ities transform the ground into a suitable place to draw a maṇḍala.For the main part of the practice, assemble the kīla for blessing, along with threads and colored powder. Next, correctly perform the progressive tasks, such as circling the area with a qualifi ed companion. In this way, establish the size of the maṇḍala with demarcation threads, apply the colors, arrange the symbols, perform the consecration, make various off erings to the maṇḍala, and conclude with a fi re off ering. Th ese fi ve acts will make it a suitable basis for accomplishment. Th e conclusion consists of all the stages of activity, such as entering the maṇḍala and conferring empowerment upon disciples.Fourth is the maṇḍala of meditative absorption. Here one takes the nat-ural maṇḍala as one’s object of meditation, referring to the indivisibility of all phenomena, which are the embodiment of enlightened body, speech, and mind.Fift h is the maṇḍala of superior meditative absorption. Th is involves med-itating by attaining clear appearance in the thoroughly complete and distinct Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 86Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 863/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"luminous essence 87forms of the support and supported elements of any given maṇḍala, whether peaceful and compassionate or wrathful and demon taming. Th ese are the specifi c qualities that appear from the ground. Here one progresses through the preliminaries, main part, and conclusion as outlined in the practice man-ual one is using.Sixth is the maṇḍala of the awakened mind. Th is refers to the actual dawn of the co-emergent wisdom of great bliss that dwells within, which occurs by bringing the channels, energies, and essences onto the path. Th is is the most sacred of the maṇḍalas of the path.Seventh is the maṇḍala of the group gathering. Th is refers to a gathering of male and female practitioners of deity meditation for the purpose of pro-found accomplishment.3. PrincipleWhat we refer to as a “maṇḍala” embodies the entire meaning of ground, path, and fruition of the vajra vehicle. For this reason, it should be known, practiced, and attained; the natural maṇḍala of the ground should be known, the meditation maṇḍala of the path should be practiced in training, and the wisdom maṇḍala of the fruition should be attained. Th e maṇḍala is also the essence of what should be known, the essence of what should be practiced, and the essence of what should be attained. Since no phenomenon within appearance and existence lies beyond the meaning of the indivisible truths of the ground continuum, the maṇḍala is the essence of that which is to be known. Th e maṇḍala to be practiced is also the essence, or entity, of all the trainings found on the path. Since ground and fruition are inseparable, all the appearances that pertain to the ground and path are in actuality spontaneously present as the essence of the fruition, that which is to be attained.Alternatively, it can also be said that the maṇḍala is not something to be known, not something to be practiced, and not something to be attained. Th e ground, the natural state of the indivisible truths of purity and equal-ity, is beyond words, thought, and description. It is, therefore, also beyond conceptual mind. In this way, it is not something that can be known as an observed object. As it is primordially present, there is no need to practice it now through the path. Moreover, since even those phenomena that are to be practiced are nonexistent when examined, it is not something to practice. Since it is spontaneously present and has been from the beginning, it is not Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 87Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 873/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"88 luminous essencesomething that can be attained anew, nor is it something to attain, since ulti-mately no phenomena to be attained can be held in mind. In this way, the mind that sees the profound meaning of the two truths—that in terms of the way things conventionally appear there is something to accomplish, while in terms of their true, ultimate nature there is not—is said to “unerringly accomplish everything.” Th is is how one should understand the maṇḍala. 4. PurposeFor great beings to accomplish the dharma kingdom, the primary cause is the dharma king. Th erefore, the maṇḍala is extremely important; all paths of mantra appear based on this, and all paths and fruitions become its essence. In short, this maṇḍala should be known through the view and established as the basis for meditation practice. Even the conduct should not depart from it. It is the site for the appearance of empowerment, the basis for what should be performed in practice, the recipient of off erings, the foundation for enlightened activity, mantra, and mudrā, and that which the samayas should observe. In this way, it encompasses all areas of training. Since the state of the spontaneously present natural maṇḍala is perfected without any action or eff ort, it is consummate. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence explains:Wisdom is represented through four directions and a center;Th is inconceivable and spontaneously present maṇḍala is the great perfection.Th e practitioner who realizes thisEnjoys everything as the natural and great maṇḍala.Since this shows how wisdom’s self-displays manifest as the form of the maṇḍala, the topic of the maṇḍala is explained to be the perfection of wis-dom.5. EmpowermentEmpowerment is presented in terms of its (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) prin-ciple, and (4) purpose.

EssenceWhen the disciplined conduct of faith and diligence is fully realized,Th e benefi cial empowerments and the potent empowermentsShould be conferred in a gradual manner.Th rough compassion, uphold without wasting.Th e Sanskrit word for empowerment is abhiṣiñca. Etymologically, abhi means “manifest” and ṣiñca means “to scatter” or “to pour.” Accordingly, the meaning is that the profound ritual of conferring empowerment washes, or scatters, the stains of the disciple’s body, speech, mind, and their combina-tion, and establishes, or pours, an extraordinary capacity into the disciple’s being , whereby he or she may develop the wisdom that ripens this into the four vajras.2. DivisionsTh ere are four empowerments that serve to remove the stains of the four occasions at the time of the ground, allow one to train in the four paths, and attain the four bodies at the time of the fruition. Th e vase empowerment purifi es the body and channels into the emanation body. Th e secret empow-erment purifi es the speech and energies into the enjoyment body. Th e wis-dom-knowledge empowerment purifi es the mind and the essences into the dharma body. Th e word empowerment purifi es the combination of body, speech, and mind into the essence body. Th e latter section of the Tantra of the Secret Essence says:Th e master, the secret, knowledge,And the immediately following, the fourth.Th e tantras teach many diff erent confi gurations for categorizing the four empowerments and their respective, specifi c rituals. Th is tantra teaches three empowerments: the benefi cial empowerments, the potent empowerments, and the profound empowerments. Th e profound empowerments can also be contained under the potent empowerments, in which case there are only two classifi cations. Alternatively, if one divides the profound empowerments into three there are fi ve in total. It is taught that the fi rst of these fi ve plants the seed, the second ripens the capacity, the third produces experience, the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 89Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 893/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90 luminous essencefourth brings stability, and the fi ft h perfects this stability and allows one to achieve the supreme spiritual attainments. From this perspective, the vase empowerment is divided into both the benefi cial empowerments and potent empowerments. Th ere are ten peace-ful benefi cial empowerments consisting of the fi ve essences, the diadem, and so forth. Th e wrathful empowerments are known to have twenty-eight divi-sions, such as those of the seats, the empowerment of the deities, the symbolic implements, and so on. Although these bring benefi t, the bestowal of these empowerments does not enable one to immediately engage in the activities of explaining , listening , and practicing mantra, which is why they are called the benefi cial empowerments. Th ere are fi ve potent empowerments. Th e empowerment of hearing the secret and the empowerment that brings spiritual attainment relate primar-ily to one’s own ability, while the empowerment of explaining the secret and the empowerment ritual of performing enlightened activity relate mainly to the ability of others. Th e empowerment of the entire teaching of the vajra king is given in relation to the ability of both oneself and others. Although these empowerments are also benefi cial, they are called potent empower-ments because they emphasize conferring, in a direct manner, the ability to engage in certain activities.Th ere are three profound empowerments. Th e secret empowerment is granted to engage in disciplined action, such as partaking in the fi ve meats and fi ve nectars without any sense of their being pure or impure. Th e wisdom-knowledge empowerment is bestowed upon those engaged in the disciplined action of the consort. Th e fourth empowerment is bestowed upon those who practice the disciplined action of the equality of all phenomena. Th ese three profound empowerments are also known as the three higher empowerments. 3. PrincipleEmpowerment is the indispensable initial entry point for the practice of man-tra. Th e reason for this is that the profound empowerment ritual produces a sudden manifestation of the ground maṇḍala that dwells primordially within oneself. Th is refers to the indivisible truths of purity and equality, which are very diffi cult to realize. In this way, empowerment is a unique method for maturing the wisdom of the four vajras.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 90Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 903/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"luminous essence 91How does empowerment bring about such maturation? From the incon-ceivable force of the coming together of certain causes and conditions (there are two causes and four conditions), the special realization of profound man-tra is either produced in actuality, or the ability to produce it is established in one’s being. Th e resembling cause for this maturation is the great bliss of purity and equality, the reality that indivisibly pervades the disciple’s chan-nels, energies, essences, and mind. Th e concurrent causes are certain sub-stances, such as the vase in the fi rst empowerment, the bodhicitta substance of the master and consort in the second empowerment, the substance of the wisdom consort in the third empowerment, and the substance of sym-bols and expressions in the fourth empowerment. Th ese are consecrated and blessed through the exceptional realization of the mantric view.As for the four conditions, the causal condition is a devoted and knowl-edgeable student who is a suitable recipient for the bestowal of empowerment. Th e ruling condition is a genuine master who is competent when it comes to the path of mantra and is, therefore, capable of conferring an empowerment that blesses the mind of the disciple. Th e observed condition consists of sub-stances, mantras, and absorptions of an extraordinary potency. Th e immedi-ate condition consists of the preceding empowerments and rituals, since the former empowerments open the gate to those that follow.Th e power that results from the coming together of these two causes and four conditions causes one’s indwelling wisdom to dawn in actuality. Th is occurs due to the inconceivable force of the unfailing dependent origination of reality itself, which is great bliss, and phenomena; the inconceivable force of the thus-gone ones’ blessings; and the inconceivable potency of mantra and mudrā, the unique activities of secret mantra’s skillful methods. Th is is as indisputable as the potency of gems and medicines. Th e Kīla Tantra says: Th e truth of reality,Th e blessings of secret mantra,Th e power of the Buddha . . .Th erefore, empowerments enable one to gradually generate understand-ing, experience, and realization of the meaning of the four vajras.

PurposeTh e path of mantra, which allows one to attain the state of enlightenment easily and swift ly, comes about from the ripening eff ect of the empowerment and never from anywhere else. On the path of sūtra, wisdom results from gathering the twofold accumulations on a vast scale for innumerable eons. Th rough the force of empowerment, in contrast, that wisdom can suddenly enter an ordinary being on the ground of a complete beginner. On this point, it is said:It is co-emergent and not expressed by others,Nor can it be discovered anywhere.It is known through the master’s timely and skillful teachingAnd from one’s own merit. Without empowerment, it is improper even to read or listen to the texts of the profound secret tantra, let alone practice them. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence states:To begin study and the likeWithout pleasing the masterOr receiving empowermentWill be fruitless and one will be ruined.While the Essence of the Great Seal explains:Without empowerment there will be no spiritual attainments,Just as no butter will come from squeezing sand.When someone who is arrogant about tantras and scripturesTeaches those without empowerment,Both master and student will go to hell upon death,Even if they have gained spiritual attainment.On the other hand, if one receives empowerment, the situation is just the opposite. By attaining permission, one can properly engage in all the paths Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 92Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 923/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"luminous essence 93and spiritual attainments of secret mantra. To receive the genuine empower-ment of mantra from a master who possesses the blessings of the lineage is, therefore, an indispensable element that will bring about limitless qualities. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence says:Child of the Victorious One, from this day forward,All lower realms cease to exist,Your life will be long , happy and perfect,And you will be a master of the higher realms and liberation.Moreover, as the tantras mention, simply seeing the maṇḍala has innumer-able benefi ts. In short, “empowerment” is the sole, initial gateway to all the paths of the vajra vehicle. It is the exceptional method for empowering one into the med-itation of the path and the attainment of the fruition. Based on empower-ment, the view of mantra is produced in one’s being ; one can meditate in accordance with that view; be eff ective in conduct; ensure that the practice, the off erings, the activity, mantra, and mudrā become meaningful; and that the samayas are attained. Th erefore, empowerment is like the source of every-thing. It is like a king in bringing forth the attainment of the progressive states of realization. Th us, everything depends on empowerment. Ultimately, when one sees that there is nothing to confer or obtain and one is perfectly complete as the great dharma body, one attains the empow-erment of the expression of self-awareness in the manner of the great perfec-tion. Th is is the culmination of all empowerments. About this, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Becoming nondual, the great seal.As they possess the supreme power to imbue one’s being with wisdom, they are the perfection of power. Th is concludes the teaching on the topic of empowerment.6.

Samaya vow comes from the Sanskrit term samaya, which means something that is not to be transgressed. It also refers to the commands of great beings. Samayas are points of training that masterful practitioners do not transgress, but enact in accordance with what is to be engaged in and rejected.2. DivisionsSamayas contain both general divisions and specifi c divisions. 1. General DivisionsIn brief, the mantra samayas are condensed into three categories: the gen-eral samayas, particular samayas, and superior samayas. General samayas are explained to be the vows of individual liberation, the trainings of the awak-ened mind, and the samayas of outer mantra. Since these are not to be trans-gressed without any real purpose, they form the foundation for, and are a facet of, the samayas of unsurpassable mantra. For this reason, they are also called the “common general samayas.” Th e particular samayas are said to be the root and branch samayas that are found throughout the unsurpassable mantra itself.Alternatively, one may also say that the general samayas are termed “gen-eral” because all the vows of individual liberation, the awakened mind, and mantra are to be observed in general. According to the mental strength of the practitioner and the superior or inferior situation one may fi nd oneself in, the samayas are upheld by applying the view, conduct, activity and so forth to one’s own meditative experience. Since specifi c individuals uphold these vows, they are also named “specifi c samayas.” Th e superior samayas are taught to be the unique vows that are taken during periods of great accomplishment, in addition to those that one should always keep, such as “not destroying the lion’s abdomen.”Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 94Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 943/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"luminous essence 952. Specifi c DivisionsOther tantras teach the fourteen root downfalls and the eight grave subsid-iary downfalls. Moreover, the number of levels and categories within the samayas taught in the individual tantras diff er from one another. In this con-text, fi ft een samayas are taught, of which fi ve are root samayas and ten are subsidiary samayas. Th is approach is the ultimate key point of all the sama-yas belonging to inner secret mantra. Consequently, if one understands this approach and does not transgress these vows, they will not become damaged. It is, therefore, important to comprehend and observe these key points. Th e fi ve root samayas are (1) not discarding the unsurpassable, (2) respect-ing the master, (3) not disrupting the continuity of mantra and mudrā, (4) loving those who have entered the authentic path, and (5) not explaining the secret meaning to unqualifi ed recipients. Th e ten subsidiary samayas are not to abandon the fi ve poisons and to readily accept the fi ve nectars.1. Th e Five Root Samayas1. Not Discarding the UnsurpassableHere, “unsurpassable” refers to the ultimate natural state of all phenomena—the inseparability of the truths of purity and equality, the dharma body. It is called “unsurpassable” because there is no fruition and no path that could possibly surpass this level of realization and attainment. It is, therefore, some-thing to feel great trust in and not something to be discarded. In essence, in not discarding this fruition, one will also not discard the three jewels and the relative and ultimate awakened mind. Th e Buddha correctly actualized the natural state of the intrinsic nature, just as it is, while the saṅgha has real-ized it to various degrees. If you have conviction in the unsurpassable and do not discard it, it will be impossible for you to abandon those who see it—the noble ones, the knowledge holders, and the buddhas—as well as the dharma that is present in their beings. Th e three jewels of ground, path, and fruition are also included by virtue of their intrinsic nature. At the time of the ground, the mind nature of sen-tient beings is the buddha in essence. Th e dharma is inseparable from this essence, just like the sun and its rays, while speech abides as the wheel of syl-lables. Due to their intrinsic nature, sentient beings are a fi eld for the prac-tice of merit and are, therefore, the saṅgha. In this way, the intrinsic nature is established as the three jewels. Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 95Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 953/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"96 luminous essenceIn the context of the path, one's own body, speech, and mind are bud-dha from the very start, insofar as they are the enlightened body, speech, and mind in identity. Th e development and completion stages of the path are the dharma, and their practical application is the saṅgha. Th ese factors embody the three jewels in the context of the path. A buddha who has completed the path, the dharma this buddha teaches, and the saṅgha of practitioners are widely known as the three jewels. Upon attaining buddhahood, the Capable One possesses the dharma body and his training has reached a point of completion. Th erefore, he embodies the threefold refuge of the fruition.In this way, all three jewels of the ground, path, and fruition are not diff er-ent from the single mode of the inseparable truths of purity and equality. Th is is the three jewels of the ultimate natural state, in which everything is per-fected as equality. Th erefore, in upholding the unsurpassable, one upholds everything. Th ere are two ways of upholding the unsurpassable. One may uphold it out of devotion, thinking that it must be as taught in the scriptures, although one may not have gained certainty oneself. Alternatively, one may uphold it out of certainty by gaining conviction in the meaning of the view and under-standing that it cannot be discarded since it is the way things primordially are. Th e latter of these two is irreversible, in the sense that even if one has entered an inferior path, this certainty has the power to cause one to reverse course. Th erefore, anyone who possesses such a view is called a “vajra holder” because, by maintaining the vajra-like reality of mantra in one's being , such a person will be able to overcome all forms of degeneration within both cyclic existence and peace.Furthermore, because one will have apprehended the ultimate, fi nal, nat-ural state, the inseparability of the truths of purity and equality, the ultimate awakened mind will not be lost. Moreover, because one never forsakes the motivation and actions of attaining enlightenment to protect all sentient beings from their miseries, the relative awakened mind will not be lost either. Seeing with certainty that this attainment of enlightenment involves con-stantly and pervasively working for the welfare of the infi nite number of sen-tient beings, all the defi lements that relate to directing one’s mind to inferior paths, such as turning the mind away from this approach, faint-heartedness, aversion towards saṃsāra, and so on, are utterly stopped. A tantra states:Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 96Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 963/11/09 3:42:49 PM3/11/09 3:42:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"luminous essence 97I and all the countless sentient beingsHave been buddhas from the very start.As the embodiment of this recognition,I give rise to the supreme awakened mind.Some individuals hold that the fruition of buddhahood is established only through the power of a causal path. While such people do indeed generate the awakened mind, feelings of discouragement, self-interest, and weariness with saṃsāra, and other such attitudes could cause them to lose their resolve. In this way, it is possible that this could hinder the cause. Buddhahood will not be achieved if all the right causes are not in place, just as a sprout can-not grow from a burnt seed. Consequently, enlightenment is seen to depend solely on one’s own power. Moreover, because the mind depends on condi-tions, ordinary beings do not attain a completely stable confi dence, but sim-ply a fi rm commitment to generating the awakened mind. In the context of mantra, however, one is clear about how to develop the relative and ultimate awakened mind inseparably. Th erefore, even at the level of an ordinary being , one gives rise to a supreme confi dence that even the rel-ative awakened mind cannot be abandoned. Th is shows that even a beginner who has engaged with the reality of mantra is as fortunate as a nonreturning bodhisattva.Th e reality of unsurpassable mantra is the ultimate deity of reality itself. All the deities that manifest in symbolic mudrā forms are accomplished by not discarding this ultimate deity. By upholding the life force of all sama-yas and meditation practices with this view, they will remain pure and never degenerate. Th erefore, if one possesses the view, which is a deep-felt certainty in the meaning of the unsurpassable reality of mantra, it is impossible for the essential point of the root samayas to degenerate. Still, those who have entered mantra out of mere devotion may give up on the unsurpassable. Th ey may lose faith in the meaning of the profound view of the inseparability of purity and equality, as well as the stable trainings of mantra that accord with this view. As taught in the fourteen root downfalls, turning one's back on these is a downfall. Moreover, such an individual may also fall prey to doubts, thinking that the meaning of the divine purity of the environment and inhabitants is merely taught for the purpose of guiding those in need, while in reality they are not pure. Th ey may also think that the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 97Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 973/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"98 luminous essencemeaning of equality possesses referential attributes, thereby clinging to some-thing that is not actually great equality. With these two fundamental down-falls, one has eff ectively turned one's back on the view of mantra. Th erefore, since they are in total confl ict with the reality of mantra arising in one’s being , they are both root downfalls. Such individuals may also do things that confl ict with the wonderful conduct of mantra, such as mortifying the aggregates, not delighting in the samaya substances, relinquishing the awakened mind that is like a jasmine fl ower, disparaging women, and not liberating those who should be liberated. Th ese all amount to turning one’s back with utter aversion on the practices that should be adopted. Th is eff ectively eliminates the good fortune needed to practice the profound conduct of mantra. Hence, these too are root down-falls.Th e other downfalls are set forth in relation to the master who directly teaches the profound meaning of mantra; one's relatives who uphold the meaning of mantra; sentient beings who are to be tamed through mantra; keeping secrecy to avoid breaking the continuity of mantra; the words of the Victorious One that either directly or indirectly teach the very meaning of mantra; the teachings of masters; and the various philosophies that allow for analysis of the various parameters of mantra. Th rough their connection with the perfect view and conduct of mantra, these areas are established to be equally sacred. By not showing them due respect, one is squandering mantra itself. Th is is why they are posited as root downfalls. Th erefore, not properly observing these points, such as respecting the teacher and teaching mantra in secrecy, is a great fault. For this reason, they are listed and taught in the tan-tras of mantra. If these principles are violated, one will not be in harmony with mantra and, thus, also be in confl ict with the conduct of mantra. As these fourteen are in great confl ict with the view and conduct of mantra, they alone are taught to be root downfalls.Th erefore, even though one's understanding of the view and conduct of mantra may not be based on direct experience, one should never disparage it, for doing so would be the extremely awful fault of having abandoned the dharma. For those who have received empowerment, this is a root downfall.Th ere is, however, no problem if one is unable to practice the profound activities of mantra immediately upon receiving empowerment. Still, one should aspire to practice these activities, thinking that in the future one will joyfully take them up by whatever means necessary. Never should one's back Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 98Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 983/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"luminous essence 99be turned on them! Moreover, even though one has not attained certainty in the profound views, one should aspire to them, thinking that they should by all means dawn in one's being because they are the ultimate profound intent of the vajra vehicle. It is inappropriate to think that they are incorrect and discard them. Consider the following lines from the Lesser Saṃvara Ta n t r a:Even if one does not aspire toTh e teachings of the profound doctrine,One should not disparage them,But recall that reality is inconceivable.Th e one for whom this is not an objectIs one who does not know of reality.It is known by great beings—Th e buddhas and their off spring.2. Respecting the MasterGenerally speaking, all qualities of the path depend on a spiritual friend. Th e sūtras teach that one should view the spiritual friend as a buddha. In partic-ular, without relying on the empowerments and key instructions of a vajra master, it is impossible for the path of mantra to dawn in one’s being. Th ere-fore, the master is essentially the same as all the buddhas, yet even kinder. For this reason, it is said that making an off ering to just one pore of one’s teacher’s body is more benefi cial than making off erings to all the buddhas throughout space and time. Hence, the fi rst fundamental downfall, which is tremendously grave, is to feel aversion toward the master from whom one has received empowerments and key instructions of the vajra-vehicle, or to obstruct the master’s intentions physically and verbally.In general, there are a fi ve types of teacher: (1) guides who lead you through the gateway of the doctrine, like a preceptor who gives ordination; (2) masters who elucidate the teachings and liberate one’s being ; (3) masters who transmit key instructions, such as a spiritual master who causes one to develop the awakened mind; (4) masters who repair one’s damaged and bro-ken vows, that is, the object for the confessions of one’s nonvirtuous deeds; and (5) masters of empowerments and samayas, meaning those who grant empowerments. Other spiritual friends who have shown you kindness, even Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 99Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 993/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"100 l uminous essenceif only slightly, yet who are not one of these fi ve are known as general mas-ters. Of these six, common teachers should be shown the respect a sick person would show to his or her physician. Th e extraordinary teachers who show us the path of mantra, on the other hand, should be viewed as an actual buddha and respected as such. Another formulation presents the following classifi cation: (1) the general teachers who are one’s virtuous spiritual friends, and (2) the guiding teach-ers who illuminate the doctrine of the perfections, as well as (3) teachers who bestow the empowerments of mantra, (4) teachers who explain the tantras, (5) teachers who amend degenerated and broken vows, and (6) teachers who give the key instructions. Respectively, these should be respected (1) as one’s king, (2) as one’s brother, (3) as one’s father, (4) as one’s mother, (5) as one’s eyes, and (6) as even more special than one’s heart. A master who transmits empowerments, explains the tantras, and grants key instructions has shown three forms of kindness and should be accorded immense respect.3. Not Interrupting the Continuity of Mantra and MudrāMantra and mūdra are symbols of enlightened speech and body, respectively. Th e continuity of mantra should remain uninterrupted by means of the fi ve types of suchness. Th ese fi ve relate to (1) the self, (2) the deity, (3) secret man-tra, (4) recitation, and (5) projection and absorption. Th e continuity of mūdra should remain uninterrupted by means of the four seals: (1) the great seal of visualizing the form of the deity, (2) the dharma seal of intent, (3) the samaya seal of expression, and (4) the action seal of transformation. How should one maintain their continuity? Ideally, one maintains the continuity of the activities of mantra and mudrā during four or three daily sessions. Th e continuity can even be maintained with merely a single session once a day. Second best is to do four or six sessions per month. At the very least, they should be maintained once a month or once each season. One should also make off erings as much as possible; do not let years and months go by without making off erings. Should one ever feel like giving up eff ort in practicing the mantras and mudrās that accomplish the deity, the root samaya will degenerate.4. Loving Th ose Who Have Entered the Authentic PathLoving those who have entered the authentic path is the samaya of relatives. Until enlightenment is reached, one should never interrupt the fl ow of love Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 100Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1003/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"luminous essence 101and aff ection for one’s companions. In general, this refers to those who fol-low the great vehicle, and those who follow mantra in particular. Th is espe-cially refers to vajra siblings who rely on the same maṇḍala and have received empowerments and key instructions from the same master. Harboring the sincere wish to abandon these companions and other such feelings consti-tutes a root downfall.In general, there are four types of relatives: (1) common relatives—all sen-tient beings who are brought together by a single buddha nature; (2) dis-tant relatives—all those who have entered the teachings of the Buddha; (3) close relatives—those with similar views and conduct, and (4) inner intimate relatives—those with whom one has received empowerment. Th ere is also a sixfold explanation that adds the following two categories: (5) the beautiful relatives—those who have the same teacher, and (6) close relatives—those who have studied the doctrine together. One should always maintain a lov-ing attitude toward these relatives.5. Not Explaining the Secret Meaning to Unqualifi ed RecipientsTh e Tantra of the Secret Essence states, “Do not proclaim the secret mean-ing externally.” Not proclaiming secrets means to speak conscientiously. It is inappropriate to explain the profound view and conduct of mantra to out-siders who are not suitable vessels, just as it is to mention such things as the faults of one’s master and siblings who uphold mantra. In general, there are four secrets: (1) the profound view of mantra, (2) the deep conduct, (3) the name and form of the deity, and (4) the signs of accomplishment. Th ese are never to be spoken of without reason. Th ere are also four intermediate secrets that should be kept private until one completes the practice: (1) the place of practice, (2) the time of practice, (3) one’s practice companions, and (4) the practice substances. Th e reason for keeping these secret is that not doing so may cause others to lose their faith or obstruct one’s spiritual attain-ment. Th erefore, mantric samaya substances and implements should be used in secret. One should also maintain confi dentiality with respect to all that the master or one’s siblings have entrusted in secrecy. From whom should all this be kept secret? It should be kept secret—by means of body, speech, and mind—from those who have damaged their samayas, those who have not received empowerment, and those without faith.In this way, the samayas of the accomplishment of exceptional quali-ties involve dwelling mentally in the unexcelled meaning, reciting mantras Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 101Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1013/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"102 l uminous essenceverbally, and displaying mudrās physically. Th ese three trainings are what one should accomplish, and their nature encompasses all trainings of mantra.Th e other three root samayas assist these three trainings and guard against factors that should be avoided. For example, they reject, or guard against, going against the intentions of the master. In addition, respecting the mas-ter, the source of accomplishment, is also included in the samayas of accom-plishment. Pleasing the master is also the foundation for the fi rst two root samayas. Th ese fi ve are like the root of a wish-fulfi lling tree; they form the founda-tion for all the qualities of mantra. Since each of these fi ve can be engaged in physically, verbally, and mentally, they are aspects of the samayas of enlight-ened body, speech, and mind. Th ey can also be divided into factors that are to be guarded against and those that are to be accomplished. 2. Th e Ten Subsidiary SamayasDo not abandon delusion, attachment, aversion, pride or jealousy.Th e white and red nectars, the ones with odour, and human fl esh,Are pure vessels, so do not discard them.1. Not Abandoning the Five PoisonsTh e fi ve poisons are abandoned by the listeners and purifi ed by bodhisat-tvas. In mantra, however, they are brought onto the path. Because of these diff erences, each is superior to the last in being less deluded and more skill-ful. Th e reasons why the fi ve poisons should not be discarded are as follows: Ultimately, there is no material substance for one to abandon, just as a dam is not needed for a mirage, while in terms of the relative, the poisons are an aid on the path when used skillfully, just as poison can be transformed into nectar. Moreover, ultimately, they are primordially enlightened as great purity and equality. Th is is tantamount to recognizing that someone mistak-enly thought to be an enemy is, in fact, a friend. Of these three, the fi rst and the last have already been covered. Th e vehicle of the perfections also teaches how to use the poisons skill-fully as an aid. Disturbing emotions may enable one to perfect the accumu-lations. For example, it is more valuable to off er one’s body than material possessions because we harbor more attachment to the former. Th e poisons Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 102Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1023/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"luminous essence 103can also become a cause for accomplishing virtue on a vast scale. Without deliberately abandoning the disturbing emotion of desire, for instance, a bodhisattva who has not yet attained power may perfect the accumulations once he or she has taken birth due to desire. If the disturbing emotions are embraced skillfully, their identity can change into virtue. A bodhisattva who dwells on the ground of aspiring conduct may intentionally engender desire out of compassion to fulfi ll the hopes of a woman tormented by desire. By feeling desirous and experiencing pleasure, he then satisfi es her. Because it is embraced by the skillful methods of compassion, such desire is still virtuous. Th is applies to other affl ictive emotions as well. Th ere are three reasons why emotions are not discarded in the mantra vehi-cle: First, the fi ve disturbing emotions are associated with the families of the thus-gone ones; second, wisdom dawns by skillfully taking them as the path; and third, they are the essence of wisdom when embraced with realization.1. Disturbing Emotions and the Buddha FamiliesAttachment manifests as the mind’s fervent desire for a given object. Because it has this expressive energ y, at the time of the path, the mind is capable of intense longing for the qualities of the path and fruition. In the context of the fruition, it is this expressive energ y that perceives all phenomena with full acceptance, without turning away from anything. With its identity that of discriminating wisdom, it is Amitābha. Aversion manifests as the rejection of dissonant objects. Th e presence of this expressive energ y in the mind causes the disappearance of dissonant fac-tors in one’s being in the context of the path. At the time of the fruition, this becomes mirror-like wisdom, which eliminates the stains of delusion regarding the nature of things. Th us, it is Vajra Akṣobhya, the conqueror of all obstacles and demonic forces. Stupidity manifests as a turning away from the nature of its objects. As such, it is a condition in which one remains indiff erent to a given object with-out giving it any thought. Since the mind has this expressive energ y, it does not apprehend characteristics conceptually at the time of the path. In the context of the fruition, stupidity is identifi ed with the wisdom of the basic space of phenomena, which does not conceive of any constructs. As such, it is Vairocana.Pride is to feel infl ated. Since the mind possesses this expressive energ y, at the time of the path it is able to perform all practices without becoming Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 103Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1033/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"104 l uminous essencediscouraged, with the knowledge that there is no path superior to that of mantra. In the context of the fruition, one comes into possession of all posi-tive qualities, so there is no sense of impoverishment or dejection and one is free from the pains of inequality at all times. As it is the wisdom of equality in essence, it is Ratnasaṃbhava. Jealousy views oneself as unequal to another in a way that cannot be tol-erated. Because the mind possesses this expressive energ y, it respectively engages and turns away from what should be practiced and refrained from in the context of the path. At the time of the fruition, one is able to benefi t and refrain from harming those in need of guidance. With the nature of all-accomplishing wisdom, it is Amoghasiddhi.As with the potency of medicine and the brilliance of jewels, the mind has possessed these fi ve self-expressive energies from the beginning. Hence, although these fi ve perform all the activities of saṃsāra when not realized, they also perform all the pure activities of nirvāṇa once realization takes place. Th us, if one lacks the strength and energ y of these fi ve, one will be like an arrow that has lost its momentum or a machine with a broken engine; one will fail to fully accomplish the objective, just like a listener dwelling in a state of peace. Th erefore, it is impossible to permanently stop the self-expres-sive energ y of mind, and there is no need to do so either, for if they are not spoiled by delusion, the disturbing emotions manifest as the fi ve wisdoms. Th e Vimalakīrti Sūtra explains: A lotus does not grow in dry ground or a desert, but from water and mud. Likewise, unsurpassable and truly perfect enlighten-ment does not arise from the listener’s eradication of the disturb-ing emotions and observation of the unconditioned. Rather, the awakened mind of unsurpassable and truly perfect enlightenment arises once one develops a view of the transitory collection that is like Mount Meru. Th erefore, the disturbing emotions are of the lineage of the thus-gone ones.2. Taking Disturbing Emotions as the PathTh e world is subdued by detachment, yet accomplishment of the mudrā manifests from desire. Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 104Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1043/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"luminous essence 105As this quote points out, in this world desire is considered a great fault, which is why there are teachings on how to pacify using detachment. Never-theless, there are also occasions when desire is indispensable. According to outer mantra, unless a person with samayas harbors mental desire for the mudrā, which is explained to be the symbolic deity, no accomplishments will be attained. According to inner mantra, unless one has intense desire for his or her spiritual partner, wisdom and accomplishment will not be attained. Consequently, it is taught that one will not achieve the spiritual attainments of the mudrās if desire is lacking. Hence, the more desire one has, such as the workable faculty endowed with the desire of the desire realm, the more bliss there will be. Th e more one skillfully embraces bliss, the more powerful the vision of wisdom becomes, just like fuel causing a fi re to blaze and poison increasing a peacock’s lus-ter. Likewise, the other disturbing emotions will also function as conditions for either faults or positive qualities depending on whether or not they are skillfully utilized. Nevertheless, the essence of these conditions remains the same. It is indeed taught that wishing for a defi led object is desire, whereas aspir-ing to the qualities of complete purifi cation is not. Nevertheless, the function of desire in these two instances diff ers merely in terms of its objects, features, and so forth. Both forms of desire are identical in the way that the expressive energ y of the mind moves toward an object. Th is is also taught in the sūtras. Th e Sūtra Requested by Sāgaramati explains:Th e more hay is put on fi re,Th e stronger and larger it becomes.Th e more disturbing emotions a bodhisattva has,Th e stronger the fi re of wisdom will blaze.3. Disturbing Emotions as the Essence of Wisdom For someone who apprehends all appearances to be ordinary and who, thereby, perceives them as real selves and phenomena, the expressive energ y of mind will arise as the fi ve poisons. However, all phenomena are actually pure; their nature cannot be established as either a self or phenomena. As this is the case, they are equality and free from all reference points.When this is seen, the fi ve expressive energies of awareness will dawn as wisdom. For example, when a beautiful object is seen, ordinary people will Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 105Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1053/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"106 l uminous essencecling to subject and object and feel attachment. Th ose practicing ascetic dis-cipline will counteract this attachment by meditating on repulsiveness and other such remedies. In the present context, however, any thought that man-ifests is allowed to arise without being suppressed. When embraced by a mind that realizes reality, the appearances of subject and object, as well as the experience of bliss, are unobstructed and there is an experience of unim-peded openness free from reference points. As the object is clearly experi-enced, directly and intensely, in the form of bliss, this is desire manifesting as discriminating wisdom. Th is can also be applied to the rest of the disturb-ing emotions. Hence, it is only in mantra that one fi nds these instructions for taking dis-turbing emotions as the path. Th e sūtras merely teach their nature. Th e Sūtra of the Mudrā for Engaging in the Generation of the Power of Faith, for exam-ple, states: Th ere is no wisdom apart from the nature of disturbing emotions. Th e very nature of disturbing emotions is wisdom.2. Not Discarding the Five NectarsTh e fi ve things that should not be discarded are the fi ve nectars that one should not abandon. Th ey are not to be discarded because the polarity of pure/impure does not exist from the perspective of equality. Moreover, since these nectars are pure, they should be readily accepted. Conduct that tran-scends notions of clean and dirty allows one to experience equality and over-power conceptual thoughts. Th rough disciplined conduct, moreover, one will quickly attain the spiritual attainments. When these entities are skill-fully embraced, they turn into worldly nectar. Also, since the fi ve nectars are essentially substances of accomplishment, they should be readily accepted. Since observing the command brings about spiritual attainments, the peri-odic off erings of nectar should not be interrupted. If one engages in such forms of conduct in a distorted manner without having realized the pro-found nature, they are vulgar and detrimental to one’s own being. On the other hand, when one’s realization is perfected, there is no need to deliber-ately engage in such acts.

By fully engaging in this path, however, the disturbing emotions themselves manifest as wisdom. When that happens, the truth of origin is the essence of the truth of the path, and suff er-ing is the embodiment of enlightenment when the ripened aggregates them-selves dawn as the wisdom of purity. Hence, this path is extremely powerful. With these subsidiary samayas, the profound conduct of mantra is spontane-ously present in one’s being. When divided extensively, there are three hundred and sixty root and sub-sidiary samayas, as elucidated in other scriptures. In brief, however, when it comes to achieving buddhahood, not transgressing the view of great purity and equality is the king of all samayas. Nevertheless, since these vows cor-respond to the mind-sets of sentient beings, the various samayas that either directly or indirectly have an impact on this process are limitless.3. Th e Principles of the Key Points of SamayaWithout a single exception, all the disciplines and vows of individual libera-tion and the awakened mind are included in the samayas of the mantra vehi-cle of great skillful methods. When contrasted with the conduct of the lower vehicles, the samayas of mantra are exceedingly pure. It should, moreover, go without saying that forms of conduct shared by these approaches do not con-fl ict since even those that appear to contradict the ethical principles of lower systems are not in confl ict, but are far superior. For example, in the context of individual liberation, four principles are taught that may cause a root infraction: the complete presence of object, inten-tion, application, and completion. Even so, while the vows of individual liber-ation specify that one must merely avoid harming others, the bodhisattva vow adds to this, mandating that one must also benefi t others. Th erefore, when bodhisattvas have a compassionate intention that is undefi led by self-interest, engaging in sexual relations and other such actions are not problematic. In fact, such acts are virtuous. Actions motivated by self-interest, however, such as praising oneself, disparaging others, and not teaching the doctrine or not giving away one’s wealth due to stinginess, are said to be infractions. In the mantra vehicle, one gains confi dence in the view of equality, whereby neither subject nor object are observed. Th erefore, the apparent act of killing and other such activities are entirely devoid of ordinary objects, intentions, Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 107Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1073/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"108 l uminous essenceapplication, and completion. Since they involve wisdom and skillful means, they are extraordinary ways to accomplish the twofold benefi t, albeit merely in terms of the relative. Th us, since one is untainted by faults, the vows of individual liberation are complete and included in the samayas. Because one acts altruistically, moreover, the same holds for the vows of the awakened mind. Th e latter builds upon the value of the former, like the gradual progres-sion of iron, silver, and gold. Furthermore, when a copper vessel is used as a bed-pan, it is dirty; when it is used as a wash basin, it is clean; when it is used as an implement for off erings to the deities, it is extremely clean; and when it is used to make a statue of a buddha, it is an object of veneration. Likewise, if the activities of one’s body, speech, and mind manifest in tandem with disturbing emotions, they will bind one to saṃsāra. When partially embraced by knowledge and method, however, one will turn away from actions that should be avoided, and those that are acted out will cause happiness and liberation. Acts that are embraced by great methods and knowledge, moreover, will become causes for unexcelled awakening, and when embraced by tremendously great meth-ods and knowledge, they will cause the eff ortless and spontaneously present great enlightenment. Th erefore, due to this process of transformation, the higher vows are much purer than the lower ones. To summarize, in sexual intercourse, for example, ordinary people are motivated by a desire for the bliss that comes from the joining of the male and female organs. Th is, in turn, causes them to fi xate on the bliss of ejacula-tion that occurs during the act itself. When the act is concluded, the seed of desire is sown in the mind, thus binding the individual to saṃsāra.Practitioners, on the other hand, are motivated by the aspiration for unde-fi led great bliss and other such principles. Preparing the cause for great merit in this way, they then allow ordinary desire to dawn as the wisdom of bliss as the actual practice. Th is is brought about through (1) the power of the bless-ings of the mudrās of enlightened body, speech, and mind, (2) the strength of the method of key instructions for binding the energies and mind within the central channel, and (3) the ability of knowledge to move toward wisdom. At the conclusion of this process, the ordinary mind and all its habitual tenden-cies are incinerated like a thicket by fi re-like wisdom. In this way, the conduct of mantra can be proven to be superior to that of other approaches. Th is can be applied to other contexts as well. In this way, the purity of conduct is established through the power of Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 108Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1083/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"luminous essence 109wisdom. Wisdom arises from, or is the essence of, the pure view. Th erefore, one should know that the life force of the samayas is upheld by the view. Th e Awesome Flash of Lightning says: Th us, what is referred to as “samaya”Is said to be one’s own view.4. Purpose Th is section contains a general explanation and a specifi c discussion of seven qualities. Th e General PurposeTh e samayas are like wish-fulfi lling jewels in being the source of all that is needed. Th ey are like the life force of all virtuous faculties. Whoever trans-gresses them will be wasting all the practices of mantra, in the same way that a broken vessel is unable to hold any liquid. In this way, since the samayas are like the ground in being the basis for all positive qualities, they are an indis-pensable basis for accomplishing the dharma-kingdom of great beings.Th e Specifi c PurposeHaving these samayas will enable one to obtain limitless sublime quali-ties. In the system of the general vehicles, one speaks of “view, conduct, and accompaniments,” which refers to the three trainings in wisdom, absorp-tion, and discipline. In terms of discipline, higher forms of discipline are superior to lower ones, and there are innumerable ways in which the vows of the bodhisattva vehicle are more exalted than the vows of individual lib-eration. In short, just as there are seven qualities that set the great vehicle apart, including its vast scope, the vows that assist this approach are corre-spondingly superior.It is hard to fathom the depths of the great vehicle, insofar as it is profound and vast, accomplishes the twofold benefi t, does not contradict the twofold selfl essness, and so on. While this may be the case, due to their profound and vast qualities, the samayas of mantra are superior to the vows of the bodhisat-tvas in limitless ways. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence, however, condenses these into seven superior qualities with the verses that begin, “Moreover, the supreme king , Samantabhadra’s seal . . .” First, these qualities are spontane-ously present and need no cultivation because they are marked with the seal Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 109Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1093/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"110 l uminous essenceof Samantabhadra. Th e listeners are born merely through the teachings of the Buddha; they do not belong to the family of the Buddha. Consequently, they are not marked by the seal of the Buddha, but merely by the seal of blessings. Since bodhisattvas belong to the family of the Buddha, they are stamped by the seal of the Buddha. Nevertheless, they are not marked by the seal of spon-taneous presence because they maintain that buddhahood is newly accom-plished. However, according to the approach of unsurpassable mantra, all phenomena are in a state of full enlightenment as the maṇḍalas of enlight-ened body, speech, and mind. Th us, they are said to be stamped with the seal of Samantabhadra. Th at being so, the fruition and all its marvelous qualities are spontaneously and eff ortlessly present.Second, the power of blessings is superior in this approach because those who practice it are viewed as sacred objects of veneration by the chief of the world and his retinue. Th e listeners are venerated by Brahma, Śiva, Indra, and other gods, yet they are not as esteemed as the bodhisattvas. Th e bodhisatt-vas, in turn, are not venerated as highly as the buddhas. However, those who hold vows and engage in the sphere of buddha activity are accorded respect on par with the great veneration received by the buddhas themselves. Th ere-fore, those who possess the samayas of mantra and engage in the sphere of buddha activity are venerated like crown-jewels by the dharma-protecting guardians who obey their commands as they would a buddha’s. Th ese beings include the great worldly gods and the mother deities and ḍākinīs that make up their retinues. Consequently, the strength of their supportive companions makes such individuals extremely powerful.Th ird, since the buddhas and bodhisattvas consider such individuals their children or relatives, blessings occur swift ly. In the same way that a qualifi ed son of a universal monarch is sure to ascend to the royal throne, a knowl-edge holder who is in accord with the realization and deeds of the Buddha himself is regarded as “one who upholds the lineage of the thus-gone ones.” Like a refl ection appearing in a clear pond, pure view and meditation enable blessings to quickly enter the being of those who are aided by the potency of the samayas.Fourth, since the experiential domains of such individuals accord with that of the thus-gone ones, the experiential domains in this approach are par-ticularly exalted. While a practitioner of secret mantra experiences the nature of the primordial state of purity and equality without accepting or reject-ing, buddha activity remains uninterrupted. For this reason, the experiential Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 110Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1103/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"luminous essence 111domains of such a practitioner accord with that of the thus-gone ones. Th is is not the case with the other two vows, which relate to the systems of the noble foe destroyers and bodhisattvas who dwell on the great grounds. Con-sequently, the experiential domains of the samayas of mantra are particularly exalted.Fift h, because all phenomena are joined with the fi eld of Samantabhadra, there is no fear and anxiety. Since all saṃsāric phenomena dwell primordially in a state of great purity and equality, there is nothing to accept or reject; this is the fi eld of Samantabhadra. Whoever realizes this will dwell in a state in which all the anxieties of saṃsāra that are caused by disturbing emotions and suff ering, as well as any fears of falling from the path, have been eliminated. When dreaming of being swept away by a river, those who recognize that they are dreaming are not scared. Aware that these appearances will disappear once they wake up, they will do their best to awake from their sleep. Likewise, here saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not viewed as something to abandon and a rem-edy, respectively. Th erefore, there is no need to strive on a path that necessi-tates discarding the disturbing emotions. Instead, one simply rests without straying from the great mindfulness that embraces disturbing emotions with the supreme wisdom of realizing their nature. Sixth, whether one teaches the vows of the provisional or defi nitive mean-ing , all are subject to the principles of natural spontaneous presence and com-plete purity, as was taught previously.Seventh, even if damaged, the samayas can be restored by being amended. Listeners believe that phenomena are real entities and that physical and ver-bal actions are the most signifi cant entities. Th erefore, like a broken clay pot, their vows cannot be repaired once damaged. Bodhisattvas do not believe that phenomena are real entities. Th ey teach the primacy of mind. Accord-ingly, any breaches of their vows can be completely restored by relying on a spiritual friend, in the same way that a skilled goldsmith can repair a broken golden vase such that it becomes even better than its former state. In the man-tra vehicle, the primary factors are held to be the realization of great purity and equality and the mastery in awareness of the illusory display. For this rea-son, any breach of its vows can be naturally restored without relying on any other support, just as a dented gold or silver vessel can be repaired through one’s own eff orts when no goldsmith is available. Th ese seven qualities of the mantra samayas can be expanded upon to an infi nite degree. Alternatively, these qualities can also be condensed into fi ve Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 111Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1113/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"112 l uminous essencecategories, since the fi rst quality is the inconceivable samaya of the inconceiv-able reality, while the fourth and fi ft h qualities can be combined into one cat-egory as the principles of essence and function. In short, the samayas are not to be transgressed. In other words, samayas involve not wavering from the view, dwelling in the maṇḍala, maintaining the meaning of the empowerment in one’s being, and not transgressing the meditation, conduct, accomplishment, off ering , enlightened activity, man-tra, and mudrā. Putting an end to factors that confl ict with these vows consti-tutes the prohibitive, or guarded, samaya. Th e samaya is universally pervasive and is the essential way to abide by the path of mantra without transgression. It is, therefore, the embodiment of the deity and the way of vajra mantra. In terms of the fi nal meaning, since all phenomena are great purity and equality from the very beginning, one should know that the culmination of the natural great perfection, in which there is no affi rming, negating, accept-ing, or rejecting, is absence, openness, spontaneous presence, and oneness. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence states:If one abides by the samaya of equality,Which unites equally with equality,One will attain the great perfection of equality.Th us, if transgressed, there will be no buddhahood.Th is concludes the teaching on samayas, the perfection of discipline.7.

By virtue of the various levels of spiritual attainment that are to be accomplished, these attainments and their accomplishment are referred to as “spiritual attainments.” In actuality, all the practices that employ the unique methods of secret mantra to accomplish the common and supreme spiritual attainments that one desires and strives toward are subsumed within the two divisions of approach and accomplishment. 2. DivisionsTh is section consists of a general explanation and a specifi c explanation of the unique group accomplishment. 1. General ExplanationTh e general presentation itself has four sections. First, both the common and supreme spiritual attainments are what are accomplished. Th e common spir-itual attainments are further divided into minor and major acts, while the supreme spiritual attainments are classifi ed as either temporary or ultimate. Furthermore, practices such as resurrections, longevity practices, and mirror-divinations are meant to accomplish the common spiritual attainments, while Vajrasattva, group accomplishment, medicinal accomplishment, and other such practices are meant to accomplish the supreme spiritual attainments.Second, when divided in terms of support, there are four categories: the substances of the various outer implements, and, internally, verbal mantra recitation, mental meditative concentration, and physical actions, such as particular gazes. Spiritual attainments are gained by utilizing these supports. Th ere can also be twofold, threefold, or fourfold divisions, as well as limitless subdivisions within each individual category. Although accomplishments based on mere substances, such as the accomplishment of minor activities, are indeed accomplishments, they are not genuine accomplishments. Gen-uine accomplishment, which is the accomplishment mentioned as one of the eleven topics, is an exceptional method that enables one to attain the ultimate fruition swift ly and easily. Nevertheless, when embraced by special methods and knowledge, such as compassion, even lesser activities become part of the genuine path. Since they may be necessary temporarily, there is nothing wrong in accomplishing them.

Although enlightened activity can indeed be grouped under accomplishment, these two are dissimilar in the sense that accomplishment is method while activity is the fruition of method. Likewise, although both of these are generally categorized as conduct, there is a diff erence in terms of the degree of specifi city and other such factors. One should, therefore, know how these principles are included in other categories and divided.Th ird are divisions in terms of the essence of accomplishment. Th is refers to accomplishment based on the development and completion stage, respec-tively. Fourth are divisions in terms of the principle of accomplishment. Th is can refer to either approach and accomplishment or, if these are divided further in terms of cause and eff ect, the four branches of approach, close approach, accomplishment, and great accomplishment.2. Group AccomplishmentTh e reason this is called “exceptional accomplishment” is because its cause, essence, and fruition are superior. Its cause is superior because of the bless-ings it generates for attaining spiritual attainments due to the power of all the outer implements and, internally, the assembly of male and female prac-titioners who have attained ability, all coming together at the same time. Its essence is superior because of the ability to attain the fruition without any obstacles. Th is, in turn, is due to the continuous eff ort that is directed toward the four branches of approach and accomplishment. Finally, its fruition is superior insofar as one attains the undefi led state of a knowledge holder.With this form of group accomplishment, the basis of accomplishment is maintained via the fi ve perfections. Th e scriptures are then followed through the four branches of approach and accomplishment. As a result, the fruition, the state of the four knowledge holders, is quickly accomplished in thirty-six days or some such period. Th e fi ve perfections are the perfect place, time, teacher, retinue, and substance. Th e perfect place means any auspicious place that is found to be good and free from obstacles when investigated. Th e per-fect time refers to the period when the time has come for the practitioners to engage in group accomplishment. It begins on an auspicious day with the proper date and astrological features and lasts until the activities of the great accomplishment have been completed. Th e perfect teacher is a master who is learned in the profound scriptures of secret mantra, has gained power in Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 114Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1143/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"luminous essence 115their meaning , and, for these reasons, is worthy to be a vajra king. Th e perfect retinue consists of the regent, wife, skeleton dancers, karma, eyes, sweeper, and so on, each with their respective qualities. Th is retinue is equal in num-ber to the deities accomplished in the gathering of the male and female prac-titioners who are worthy to assemble in the profound maṇḍala. Th e perfect substance consists of the coming together of the complete range of edible sustenance, illness-averting medicines, necessary implements, and substances for accomplishment.When these fi ve perfections are present, one can practice the profound accomplishment via the four aspects of approach and accomplishment. First, one practices by pleasing the deity for the approach. Following this, one becomes genuinely oriented toward attaining the spiritual attainments for the close approach, and then gains the spiritual accomplishments through accomplishment. Great accomplishment refers to the full accomplishment that occurs once the spiritual attainments have been acquired.To dispel adverse conditions, one should set the outer boundary and sub-due samaya breakers. Th e inner boundary can then be set and the maṇḍala erected. Th e preliminary practices consist of the fi ve preparations. Respec-tively, these fi ve relate to the maṇḍala, deities, master, substances, and stu-dents. For the main part of the practice, one fi rst draws the maṇḍala image on a place that has been blessed as the interior of the liberated matraṃ. Th en the substances for accomplishment are arranged there and, together with the rest, all the implements are blessed in the correct manner. For the conclusion, the maṇḍala recitation is performed, various off erings are made, the maṇḍala is entered, and one receives empowerment. Everything up until this point constitutes the approach.Next, by correctly following the practice text and putting eff ort into recita-tion and meditation, one will see the signs of accomplishment getting closer. Th is is the close approach to the deity.Accomplishment consists of actualizing stable signs of accomplishment through practice. If the deity is peaceful, one transforms it into a wrath-ful deity or one visualizes the deity’s radiation and absorption, regardless of whether the basis for accomplishment is peaceful or wrathful. Eff ort is placed on recitation, while food, drinks, ornaments, garments, and all other desir-able things are enjoyed as the play of empty bliss. Th e deities are also pleased with dance and mudrās. Th rough this practice, the stable signs of spiritual attainment are actualized. Th is is accomplishment.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 115Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1153/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"116 l uminous essenceGreat accomplishment occurs when the spiritual attainments are acquired. In one night, between dusk and dawn, one gains the spiritual attainments of the enlightened body, speech, and mind of the maṇḍala. At dusk, one should practice radiation and absorption and acquire accomplishments from the deities, whereas one should practice liberation and take accomplishments from the enemy at midnight. At dawn, one should practice union and take accomplishments from one’s consort. Utilizing this form of group practice will gradually induce the symbolic and actual wisdoms and one will come to dwell on the level of a noble one. Previously attained forms of realization will gradually develop until the uni-fi ed state of nonlearning has been reached. Th is, in turn, will enable one to attain the levels of the four knowledge holders.3. Principle Th is explanation has two parts: (1) how to achieve accomplishment, and (2) the fruition of this accomplishment. 1. How to Achieve AccomplishmentTh is section is divided further into two parts: (1) the development stage and (2) the completion stage. In the development stage, one begins by resting one’s attention on a focal support, such as a buddha statue placed before oneself. By familiarizing oneself with this process, one will progress through the fi ve meditation experiences. Th is, in turn, will enable one to attain accomplishment by becoming profi cient in the practice of appear-ance and existence being divine form. Here, having sharp faculties, observ-ing the samayas, and training in the key instructions constitute the aspect of approach, meditating one-pointedly on the divine form is close approach, gaining stability is accomplishment, and perfecting the practice is great accomplishment.Th ere are two variations of the completion stage, one with signs and one without signs. Th e former is method, while the latter is the outcome of this method. In the completion stage with signs, which constitutes approach, one uses the support of one’s own body to produce an experience of empty bliss using the subtle essences, energetic practices, and inner heat. In the comple-tion stage without signs, which is accomplishment, one utilizes the support of another’s body and actualizes co-emergent joy through the practices of descent, retention, reversal, and pervasion. Since each of these can also be Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 116Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1163/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"luminous essence 117divided in terms of method and the outcome of method, these two encom-pass the four aspects of approach and accomplishment. Using the method of one’s own body also constitutes the four branches of approach and accomplishment, insofar as it involves the stages of receiv-ing key instructions, putting them into practice, stabilizing the practice, and bringing it to perfection. As for utilizing another’s body, approach involves knowing the key instructions, attracting a knowledge consort, and so forth. Close approach is the union of the vajra and lotus that follows consecration. Accomplishment is the arousal of the fi rst three joys. Great accomplishment is the experience of co-emergent joy. In addition, the four joys themselves are also the four aspects of approach and accomplishment from the perspective of the former stages causing the latter ones, which are their eff ects. In short, these four branches of approach and accomplishment are divided into the path of actual accomplishment and the preceding cause, regardless of which spiritual attainment one is trying to attain. One may then make further internal divisions in terms of cause and eff ect. Consequently, these four stages encompass the fi ve paths in their entirety. One should be aware that these four can also be correlated with other factors, even down to a sin-gle practice session. As for the completion stage without features, all conceptual paths are really nothing more than methods for realizing the luminous great perfection without features. Th us, when practitioners with a gradual inclination medi-tate on the methods presented in these paths, they will be able to access this primordial stage. On the other hand, students with sharp faculties who are suited for the instantaneous approach of the great perfection will not need to rely on blissful melting and other such methods. Instead, they will be able to enter this state merely by the power of the master’s key instructions and the transference of blessings. In either case, this is the sacred fruition of all other completion stage practices.Moreover, the master’s key instructions enable one to recognize, directly and nakedly, that the nature of one’s own mind is empty yet aware, that it is self-occurring wisdom, innately free from constructs. With this recogni-tion, one comes to rest in a state without accepting or rejecting and without artifi ce or fabrication. In this regard, approach is to receive the key instruc-tions that point out this state. Since this stage is the gateway to the natu-ral and spontaneously present great maṇḍala, it is likened to opening one’s eyes. Close approach involves understanding the nature. Th is stage is likened Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 117Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1173/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118 l uminous essenceto actually seeing the maṇḍala. Accomplishment refers to training in accord with this understanding , thus bringing forth an experience of one’s indwell-ing wisdom, which is likened to entering the maṇḍala. Great accomplish-ment involves gaining certainty in the nature of the great perfection, which occurs once one’s training is stable and any clinging to the eff orts of the path and the claims of the philosophical positions of the eight vehicles have col-lapsed. Th is stage is likened to becoming empowered into the maṇḍala. It is, therefore, impossible to enter this natural great maṇḍala using attri-butes and material substances. Rather, it can be accessed only through the strength of self-awareness. To rest in that state without contrivance is the method for settling the mind. Out of this state, the wisdom that beholds the uncontrived nature will dawn as natural luminosity. Th is is the path of the great perfection, the fruition of the method for placing the mind.2. Th e Fruition of AccomplishmentTh ere are three points that describe how wisdom unfolds once one has prac-ticed this path: (1) the wisdom of appearance, (2) the wisdom of emptiness, and (3) the wisdom of unity. In the experience of a practitioner of the devel-opment stage, the wisdom of appearance refers to the appearance of the cre-ated form of the deity. For a practitioner of the completion stage, it refers to the divine forms and other limitless appearances that manifest within the state of luminosity. Such manifestations are mere products of the energetic mind and appear only as a self-display (as illustrated by the twelve examples of illusion). With the wisdom of emptiness, one dissolves the deity’s appearance once a stable absorption in the development stage has been achieved and contem-plates without maintaining a mental reference point. Practitioners of the completion stage experience the fourfold emptiness based on practices that involve conceptual methods. During the last emptiness, co-emergent lumi-nosity is seen.Th e wisdom of unity refers to the natural state of all phenomena, the unity of basic space and awareness. When this unity is experienced as natural luminosity within the nature of one’s mind—naturally and without contriv-ance—one dwells in the great perfection, free from fabricated visualizations and methods that require conscious eff ort.Th ese three wisdoms are also posited in relation to the realization of the natural state of purity, equality, and indivisibility, respectively. However, in Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 118Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1183/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"luminous essence 119essence, the illusory body appears as emptiness; luminosity is one’s unob-structed self-display; and, as such, these two are a unity. Th ey are taught in this manner because of their varying degrees of emphasis.Likewise, while each expresses its own unique qualities when presented together, the terms “purity” and “equality” can each be used to demonstrate both principles. Th e term “purity” demonstrates the relative purity of the deity and that the ultimate is purifi ed of conceptual activity. “Equality” dem-onstrates the relative indivisible equality of buddhas and sentient beings, and the ultimate equality of the basic space free from constructs. In this way, one should be aware that both of these terms have the ability to illustrate the meaning of primordial enlightenment. Th is is widely taught throughout the tantras. With each of these three wisdoms, such as the illusory body, one may dis-tinguish between experience and realization. Experiences, moreover, can also be classifi ed as being stable, unstable, and so forth. Th ere are other ways of categorizing as well. Th ey can be correlated with each of the four modes, for example: (1) the literal meaning in accord with the perfection vehicle, (2) the general meaning in accord with the development stage, (3) the hidden meaning in accord with the completion stage with signs, and (4) the ulti-mate meaning in accord with the great perfection without signs, or the frui-tion. Each of these four modes is superior to those that precede it, yet all are oriented toward the ultimate meaning. Training exclusively in meditative absorption on the path of the subtle essence and so forth can induce the experience of the fourfold emptiness. Th is occurs in a way that broadly resembles the manner in which luminos-ity is sustained in relation to union, deep sleep, and dying. However, the way in which the subtle movement of the energetic mind ceases is very diff erent. Until the subtle energetic mind has been dissolved there can be no ultimate luminosity. Th e expanse of luminosity, in which the entirety of the eighty natural concepts together with their mounts have dissolved, has the identity of the unceasing clarity of awareness. Of the twofold division of mind and wis-dom, this expanse is wisdom, not mind, because it is the clarity of nondual awareness, which is of one taste with basic space. It is reality, not phenomena, because it is the inexpressible unity of appearance and emptiness—the nature of mind.

Th e Sūtra Requested by Sāgaramati states:How can space become affl icted?It is possible that this may be shown in the future,But the natural luminous clarity of the perfectly awakened mindCan never become affl icted. While the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras explains:Mind is said to be naturally luminous at all times,But made unwholesome by transitory faults.Any mind that is diff erent from the mind of reality,Is not luminosity, which is said to be natural.And the Unexcelled Continuity says:Th e nature of mind is luminous,And unchanging like space. Although desire and the rest appear from incorrect concepts,It remains undisturbed by these temporary stains.In this context, unless one genuinely understands the nature of the ground to be the unity of the indivisible truths, one will not be able to fully ascer-tain the ground luminosity. If “luminosity” were a mere vacant absence, the mind would perish when all minds and mental states recede. Even if luminos-ity were empty like space, who could recognize this in the absence of a mind? Similarly, if luminosity is understood to be merely the clarity and awareness of an ordinary mind, and if it is said to be found even in dualistic investiga-tion and analysis, then why would luminosity not be found within in the other eighty natural concepts as well? Th erefore, the mind’s natural state is a primordial unity of inseparable basic space and awareness. It is beyond comprehension by dualistic concepts. Like primordial space, it dwells without transition or change. By the power of the path, it is experienced as a nondual self-clarity by the wisdom that arises from the self-expression of reality itself. Th is is known as beholding luminosity. If one does not part from the self-expression of wisdom, there will be nei-ther confusion nor liberation; one will simply dwell in the ground.

Th is is what we call “mind.” Th is confusion is the repository for all the habit-ual tendencies of saṃsāra, like a storage container. When this self-expres-sion manifests undistortedly, it is called “wisdom.” Wisdom is like a fi re that burns the thicket of duality and the predispositions for saṃsāra, bring-ing liberation. It is very important not to confuse the essential points of these two.Th e scriptures of the great perfection demonstrate with great clarity the diff erence between consciousness and wisdom. Th e Sūtra of Descent into Lanka also speaks of this:Mind performs actions and so on,While wisdom is what distinguishes.Th e King of Absorption says:Th rough knowing the nature of mind,Wisdom arises again.Consciousness and wisdom are similar in terms of merely being aware and knowing. However, they diff er insofar as one is a mistaken apprehension that fails to correctly comprehend its object, while the other is an unmistaken awareness of the object as it is. It must be understood that wisdom remains even once dualistic consciousness is overcome. In terms of the ground, as a sentient being , these two are like ice and water. Although confusion may take place, it does so within a state of luminosity. And though one may be liberated at a later point in time, this liberation also occurs within luminosity. Th is is an extremely important point to under-stand. Th e Wheel of Time states:In the treatises of non-Buddhists, that which is not the aware-ness of reality is referred to as “awareness.” What is awareness? It is the emptiness of inner-awareness and unchanging bliss also. Th ese were fully stated in this world by the sages. What is it? Unchanging luminosity is that which appears as the entirety of the three worlds, and lo, lord of humans, that into which it dissolves again.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 121Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1213/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"122 l uminous essenceIn this way, wisdom is situated within the ground. However, since the basic space of phenomena is the union of appearance and emptiness, it is not sim-ply a mere empty state; it possesses the quality of clear awareness. In essence, it is beyond confusion and liberation. Hence, it is classifi ed as such simply because it does not stray from this state. Nevertheless, it is very important not to mistake this for liberated wisdom—the wisdom that arises from the dis-play of the ground once one has genuinely realized it for what it is. Moreover, one should understand that it is only in the scriptures of the great perfection that one will fi nd clear explanations of the way ground man-ifestations arise from the ground, the way confusion and liberation appear from that, and the way in which it is impossible to become confused again once confusion has been reversed within the ground. A general explanation of this topic was also off ered above in the chapter on the ground. In this way, the mantras and mudrās that are the primary elements of the development and completion stages, as well as all the other areas of training in secret mantra, are brought together. By assembling all facets of the path that are called for, both temporary and ultimate objectives are accomplished quickly and with ease, like a magical apparition. Th is is “the accomplishment of secret mantra.” 4. PurposeAccomplishment is extremely signifi cant since the attainment of all desired objects, whether of a temporary or ultimate nature, depends on it. In brief, accomplishment is what actualizes the meaning that was ascertained via the view and enables one to capture the ultimate and lasting dominion. Moreover, diligent conduct that employs maṇḍala, absorption, samayas, empowerment, off erings, mantra, and mudrā will allow one to gain spiritual attainments. Th ereby, one will engage in manifold enlightened activities for the sake of others, fulfi lling their wishes in the process. In this way, accomplishment encompasses all the other aspects of training as well. In the fi nal analysis, all accomplishment and its objects are a mere self-dis-play. Th erefore, in the sense that one’s own mind has been buddha from the very beginning, there is nothing to accomplish. Resting in the state of sponta-neously present equality and perfection with an understanding of this point is the perfection of accomplishment. On this topic, the Tantra of the Secret Essence says:Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 122Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1223/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"luminous essence 123In all the ten directions and four times,Th e perfect buddha will not be found.Mind itself is the perfect buddha.Do not search for the buddha elsewhere.Th is concludes the teaching on the topic of accomplishment, the perfection of diligence.8. Off eringsOff erings are discussed in terms of their (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) princi-ple, and (4) purpose. 1. EssenceTh rough a diff erence in clarity, fortunate onesUnite with the basic space of phenomena,Either gradually or instantaneously,And meditate on the great off ering mudrā.Th e Sanskrit term pūja means “to generate before,” “to repeatedly generate joy,” or “to revere.” Th us, off erings precede any virtuous activity and are pro-duced prior to pleasing the deities and before any activity is performed. Alter-natively, in terms of reverence, off erings are meant to continuously please. To elaborate, in terms of identity, off erings are actions that please by means of the various inner and outer things that are presented with an intention to physically, verbally, and mentally worship and revere the recipient of the off erings.2. DivisionsTh is section has two parts: (1) the unique specifi c divisions and (2) an expla-nation of the common gathering circle.1. Th e Unique Specifi c DivisionsGenerally, off erings are divided in terms of being either worldly or transcen-dent, surpassed or unsurpassed, or presented in actuality or imagined. Other distinctions can also be made in terms of common and unique off erings, and Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 123Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1233/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124 l uminous essencewith regard to the recipient, intention, and substances that are off ered. In terms of support, there is an inner classifi cation in terms of the continuum of body, speech, and mind and an outer classifi cation that consists of substances and implements. In terms of the form of off ering, there is also a threefold division into service, material off erings, and practice. Th ere are also outer, common off erings, which are the off erings that are worthy as pleasing gift s in the world. Th ese well-known off erings are mentioned in the outer tan-tras of mantra. Th e inner, special off erings are unique to inner mantra and are included within the off ering substances, support substances, amendment substances, and accomplishment substances. Th e secret, marvelous off ering is to off er the fi ve poisons as the fi ve wisdoms. Th e off ering of appearance and existence as great bliss is made by undertaking activity, such as union and lib-eration, by means of the view of great purity and equality, the meditation of appearance and existence manifesting as the ground, and the conduct of self-liberating whatever arises.All these distinctions can also be condensed in terms of their essential char-acter into four categories: (1) the outer off ering of enjoyments, (2) the inner off ering of sacred substances, (3) the secret off ering of union and liberation, and (4) the suchness off ering of great equality. Th e outer off ering consists of seven off erings: (1) mudrā dances, (2) songs of praise, (3) an absorbed mind, (4) various pleasant objects, (5) marvelous specifi c substances, (6) supreme methods, and (7) appearance and existence as manifest ground. Th e mudrā dance encompasses many types of mudrā, such as dances with the feet, ges-tures with the hands, gazes with the eyes, postures of the body, and expres-sions of dance. Songs of praise have several melodies, such as the shatapa. In terms of words, there are many, such as those that evoke commitments, eulogies, supplications, those that bring joy, and mantra words of off ering. In making off erings through absorption, one fi rst develops faith and devo-tion and then emanates infi nite off ering clouds via meditative concentration. At the same time, through wisdom one understands that they are without intrinsic existence. Th e off ering of pleasant objects refers to the seven desired objects, the six sense pleasures, and in particular one’s clothes, jewelry, food, drinks, belongings, dwelling place, domain, and wealth. Marvelous specifi c substances are the individual unique off ering substances and supportive sub-stances of the deities and protectors as they are described in the scriptures. Off ering by supreme methods refers to the fi re off ering and other such rituals. To m a k e o ff erings based on fi re is a method that uniquely satisfi es the deities. As such, it is more exalted than other off erings. Likewise, with the thread-Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 124Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1243/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"luminous essence 125cross of off ering and appeasement and other methods, one can accomplish many great goals with little hardship. Finally, off ering appearance and exis-tence as the manifest ground means to mentally make an off ering of all the phenomena that appear and exist as a single whole. Th is resembles the off er-ing of pure realms found in the common vehicles. In this context, however, since the world and its inhabitants dwell primordially as the great bliss of purity and equality along with all pure and impure phenomena, everything within appearance and existence is off ered in the form of an off ering of empty bliss. Th is is also termed “the off ering of appearance and existence as manifest ground” and “the off ering that is indivisible with the ever-excellent.”Th e inner off ering of sacred substances is explicitly taught to be the sacred substance of nectar, the great red rakta, and the baliṅ torma. Moreover, it can also refer to the elements of the channels, energies, and essences in the vajra body, manifesting as various pure off erings.Th e secret off ering is explicitly taught to be union and liberation. Th is also refers to off ering the fi ve poisons as the fi ve wisdoms, the three poisons as enlightened body, speech, and mind, and so on.Th e off ering of suchness is to acknowledge natural equality within the sin-gle sphere of the dharma body. Here, the great bliss of the purity and equal-ity of appearance and existence is off ered, without focusing on an off ering , recipient, and an act of off ering. Th is is the king of all off erings that delight the thus-gone ones. Th e outer off erings and the rest of the four off erings are connected with the four empowerments and their corresponding views, meditations, and samayas. In this way, there are limitless subdivisions of off erings, which is why the individual classes of tantra speak of such a diversity of off erings. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence, however, explicitly mentions off erings only in terms of substances, fi re ritual, meditative absorption, union and liberation, nectar, and songs of praise. According to the key instructions of masters of the past, there are fourteen off erings related to the peaceful and wrathful dei-ties. Th ese are mentioned in the following lines:Respectful homage, mudrā dance,Samantabhadra, cooling water, four crossings,Nectar, torma, beverages,Superior meditative absorption, union, liberation,Pleasing objects, wisdom music, and wisdom songs.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 125Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1253/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"126 l uminous essenceTh e off erings for wrathful deities are similar, except the off ering of rais-ing the rakta three times is used instead of the off ering of superior medita-tive absorption.2. Th e Common Gathering Circle Th is topic involves three explanations: (1) how it is common, (2) its purpose, and (3) the way to perform it. Why is this gathering circle referred to as “com-mon”? Th e reason for describing it as common is that it contains all the off er-ings that are taught within the outer, inner, secret, and suchness off erings. Th e gathering off ering is deeply signifi cant because it is the highest form of off ering and not just a limited off ering ritual. As is said, “a gathering off ering is the highest form of merit.”Th e third point, the way to perform a gathering off ering, consists of a con-densed presentation and an elaborate explanation. Concerning the former, a gathering of fortunate individuals collects a gathering of precious materials and off ers this to the gathering of deities that are being accomplished, thereby perfecting the gatherings of merit and wisdom.Th e longer explanation divides this off ering into preliminary activities, the main practice, and concluding activities. For the preliminary activities, arrange a vast maṇḍala in a suitable place to perform the profound activi-ties of mantra. Th is can also consist of the supports of exalted body, speech, and mind, or piles of fl owers equal to the number of deities. Having blessed the maṇḍala, gather suitable substances for the outer, inner, and secret off er-ings, whatever materials for the gathering one can aff ord. At the very least there should be meat and alcohol, as these two are indispensable. Represent-ing method and wisdom, male and female practitioners who possess samayas should then gather in equal numbers. Th ere should be at least two practitio-ners, but it is better to have many. Regardless of how many there are, the male and female practitioners must be equal in number, otherwise it is not a genu-ine feast off ering. If there are mostly heroes present, it is merely called a “cele-bration of heroes,” and when the participants are mostly heroines, it is termed a “banquet of heroines.”Next, practitioners who are worthy to assemble should wear the dress of the peaceful or wrathful deity on which their fl ower fell. As they enter the hall for the feast, there should be people placed at the four gates, dressed like wrathful deities, who will ask them if they are welcome in a symbolic manner Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 126Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1263/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"luminous essence 127by raising one fi nger. To reply that they are welcome, the practitioners raise two fi ngers and then enter.Once inside, the activity vajra will ask them what buddha family they belong to by showing the gesture of the three-pronged vajra. In response, practitioners will show the gesture of the main deity of the buddha family on which their fl ower fell. Th e practitioners then make prostrations to the vajra master and take their seats in rows based on when empowerment was received, their mastery of wisdom, and other such factors. Th e rows are sit-uated to the left , right, and in front of the leader. Symbolic implements and other items are placed at the rows, illustrating the fi ve families. Once the practitioners have been seated in the row of their respective buddha fam-ily, the activity vajra prostrates and supplications are made to remain in the maṇḍala of meditative stabilization. Th ese are the preliminary activities. Th e main part of the gathering begins by off ering the torma to the obstructing forces and closing the boundaries, as spelled out in detail in the ritual manual. Off erings for the feast are cleansed, purifi ed, multiplied, trans-formed, and off ered to the deities, which are indivisible from oneself. Th en the activity vajra makes prostrations and distributes the substances of means and knowledge using the lotus gesture. Th e play of receiving these symbols with symbols satiates all deities of the aggregates, elements, and sense bases with undefi led great bliss. During the feast off ering, one should abandon fi xation on ordinary appearances and rest continuously in the play of deity, mantra, and medita-tive absorption. One must also refrain from any kind of prank, chatter, and mockery, and enjoy the feast substances within equality free from any con-cepts of pure and impure. Vajra songs, vajra dances, the union of empty bliss, and other off erings may be made at this point in accord with one’s meditation experience. In short, the feast encompasses the entire range of outer, inner, secret, and suchness off erings.For the concluding activities, all left overs from the feast are carried out and off ered as a torma. Finally, the vajra songs, dances, and other concluding activities of the maṇḍala should be performed in their entirety.3. PrincipleTh e unsurpassed off erings of secret mantra are more exalted than the off er-ings made in the lower vehicles because they are superior with regard to the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 127Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1273/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"128 l uminous essenceobject to whom they are directed, the intention, and the things that are off ered. Th e object that these off erings are given to is the ultimate fi eld of merit—buddhahood itself. If one knows that all phenomena within appear-ance and existence are the spontaneously present great maṇḍala of primor-dial purity, then the entirety of existence and peace is satiated in equality, even if one makes off erings to just one deity. Likewise, enjoying an object while one’s body, speech, and mind are in the form of the three vajras is iden-tical to making off erings to the Buddha as such. For this reason, it is superior. Moreover, buddhas have a body of the wisdom of equality and do not enter-tain any concepts of being pleased or displeased. Nevertheless, in accordance with the inclinations and interests of those in need of guidance, they assume a perfect wisdom body. Th erefore, by greatly pleasing the deities of mantra, the two spiritual attainments are easily attained.In terms of intention, enjoyment without fi xated grasping takes place within the state of the great purity and equality of suchness. Th ereby, gener-osity and the rest of the perfections, as well as faith, compassion, and all the other elements that cause great awakening, without exception become the embodiment of the single taste of great bliss and emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects. Since all phenomena are enjoyed without any form of clinging or restraint, this constitutes the eff ortless spontaneous accomplishment of the perfection of generosity as well as its fruition. In the same way, realizing equality allows one to remain unsurpassed and untainted by any fault. Hence, this involves discipline as well. It also encompasses patience, insofar as one is undisturbed and the signs of wisdom are complete. It is diligence in that there is no decay and the activities become the accumulations. Meditative concentration is included because one does not stray from the state of equality, even though one’s faculties engage with objects, and since one dwells in the observation of the nature of all phenomena. It is also knowledge because the nature is real-ized just as it is, whereby all phenomena are known without any obstruc-tion and one is beyond conceptualizing objects. Method is present insofar as the benefi t of self and others is eff ortlessly performed. Aspiration is included since realms and experiences are utterly pure. Strength is present since it can never be subdued by any opposing factors. Finally, it is wisdom because one genuinely realizes the nature, whereby all dualistic phenomena disappear into nonduality. Moreover, the approach of remaining nondual with buddhahood itself, Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 128Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1283/11/09 3:42:50 PM3/11/09 3:42:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"luminous essence 129in which one spontaneously accomplishes activity for the benefi t and happi-ness of all beings in all times and places, allows for the spontaneous presence of faith, compassion, and all the other qualities of the path. In this way, the intention of this form of off ering is superior as well.As for the things that are off ered, since all off ering substances are trans-formed into the nectar of wisdom, they are no longer ordinary. As natural purity and equality, they can appear in any possible form out of reality, which is nothing whatsoever. For this reason, off erings can be transformed through visualization, mantras, and gestures, such that one can present Samantabhad-ra’s cloudbank of off erings in the space of just a single atom, off ering infi nite riches found in the buddha fi elds that fi ll the reaches of space, an inexhaust-ible treasure of great bliss.4. PurposeTh is unique method of truly delighting the deities of secret mantra enables one to eff ortlessly gain all the spiritual attainments of action and wisdom. Off erings are extremely important because they are the gateway to fully per-fecting the accumulations of merit and wisdom. In short, off ering is what pleases the wisdom deities, while the ultimate method for pleasing them is to access the nature of mantra. Th e Sūtra Th at Gathers All Intents says:To internalize merely oneOf the secret words of the great vehicleFar surpasses sending vast off erings,Even if greatly multiplied, To an inconceivable number of beings and listeners,And limitless buddhas and bodhisattvas.Why? Because knowing the great vehicleIs the best way to please the victorious ones. Th erefore, there is no other path of mantra that is not an off ering of prac-tice, wealth, or service. As such, the categories renowned as the eleven param-eters of training can be included in the off erings explained in this context: the three parameters of the path—view, absorption, and conduct; the three parameters that maintain the foundation—maṇḍala, empowerment, and samaya; the three practices—accomplishment, off ering , and enlightened activity; and the two methods—mantra and mudrā.

Still, in terms of its distinct essential nature, it can also be explained as an individual topic, separate from the other trainings.In the nature of reality—great purity and equality—there is no fi xation on something that is off ered, one who off ers, and the act of off ering. Th e perfec-tion of all off erings should be understood to take place within the nature of the great perfection—the expansive, self-manifesting array of the self-display, within the great, natural spontaneous presence. In the nature of the great perfection, this is known as the perfection of all off erings. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Stability in the magical net Delights the entire range of maṇḍalasOf the buddhas of the ten directions and four times,And manifests for the beings of the three realms.Th is concludes the teaching on the topic of off ering, the perfection of gen-erosity.9. Enlightened ActivityTh is ninth section discusses enlightened activity in terms of its (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) principle, and (4) purpose.1. EssenceConcerning the fi rst of these, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Since knowledge, the suchness of the expanse,Becomes the mudrā of method,Wisdom plays within wisdom,Yet this very play of wisdom is unreal.Th e manifest appearance and protection of victorious ones,As well as the show of blessings are just so.With the splendor capable of action,Th ere is illusion, supreme vajra majesty.Th e Sanskrit word karma means physical, verbal, and mental actions.

Such activity is imbued with the rela-tive awakened mind, which is elicited by the four immeasurables and great knowledge.2. DivisionsIn terms of its goal, enlightened activity can be either supreme or common. Supreme enlightened activity involves planting the seed of liberation in another’s being by initiating him or her into a maṇḍala, using mantras and mudrās, or by other such means. Common enlightened activities include everything that brings about a pleasant, albeit temporary, result.When divided in terms of support, enlightened activities may utilize either external substances or the internal body, speech, and mind. Th ere are innu-merable activities that utilize various external substances. Such substances include drawings of magical circles, fi re off erings, stūpas, statues, symbolic implements, corpses, and the fi ve meats. Activities may also be accomplished using physical mudrās, dances, expressions, gazes, postures, and other such actions; by verbally reciting mantras, singing , uttering words of truth, and so on; and mentally through intention and absorption. Moreover, enlight-ened activities may be carried out by utilizing each of these individually or by using them all in conjunction with one another. By carrying out the activities of mantra in harmony with the mind-sets of sentient beings, one will be able to accomplish both temporal and ultimate aims. Hence, when classifi ed fur-ther in terms of internal divisions and the aims of the activity, the varieties of enlightened activity are limitless. In terms of essence, there are four types of enlightened activity that either benefi t or annihilate: pacifying , enriching , magnetizing , and subjugating. Pacifying activities include pacifying illness, malevolent forces, negativity, obscurations, enemies, fears, obstacles, black magic, and so forth. Enrich-ing activities are designed to cause lifespan, merit, wisdom, splendor, reti-nue, wealth, strength, prosperity, happiness, dharma, and other such factors to fl ourish. Magnetizing activities are used to bring something or some-one under one’s control. Th is may include humans, such as kings, ministers, queens, or scholars; nonhuman beings, including gods, serpent beings, and malevolent spirits; glory, such as experience, realization, and enlightened qualities; and material goods like food, drink, clothing, and jewelry. Th ere are various forms of subjugating activity as well. Th ese include summoning , separating , binding , suppressing , averting , killing , and expelling ; terrorizing , Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 131Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1313/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132 l uminous essencesuch as destroying something or driving someone insane; and creating bad omens, lightning , hail, and so on.In terms of qualities, any act may be ordinary or supreme. Th e former refers to acts motivated by the three poisons, such as attachment to one’s own wel-fare. In essence, such acts are not embraced with the purposeful activity of skillful methods, nor do they lead to a meaningful result, either temporarily or ultimately. Th ough they may look like mantric activities on the surface, in truth they are ordinary acts. In this context, such acts are to be avoided.Supreme activities, in contrast, are directed toward the welfare of others and are motivated by great compassion. In essence, they are characterized by the intent and conduct of mantra, which are embraced by extraordinary methods and knowledge. Th e results of such acts are deeply meaningful on both a temporal and ultimate level and are accomplished with ease.Th ose knowledge holders who swift ly accomplish buddhahood for the welfare of all sentient beings may liberate the enemies and obstructive forces that create obstacles on their path. Th ey may also accomplish activities that pacify their own illnesses and so forth, thereby directly benefi ting themselves and indirectly benefi ting others. Because they are embraced by profound intent and conduct, such acts are not inferior in terms of their cause, essence, or fruition.On the other hand, this is not the case with other acts, such as reversing mantras directed at the personal enemies of the three jewels. Th ough such acts may seem to benefi t others in a temporary sense, in terms of their cause, essence, and fruition they are in line with ordinary acts. Hence, they should be avoided.Th erefore, knowledge involves knowing the right time to initiate an act, such that it does not confl ict with the path; knowing how to carry out the act; and being skilled when it comes to transforming the result of the activity into the path of enlightenment. Method, on the other hand, is the supreme strength needed to carry out the activity, which may be mantra, mudrā, or otherwise, as well as embracing the act with the profound viewpoint and con-duct of mantra. In this way, when embraced by both means and knowledge, accomplishing a given act with ease is the temporal result, while the gradual accomplishment of enlightenment is its ultimate fruition.Th e activities of the buddhas also benefi t and create happiness for sentient beings, both temporally and ultimately. Engaging in buddha activity means to not let such acts become something to hope for in the future, but instead Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 132Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1323/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"luminous essence 133to carry out such activities here and now by utilizing the skillful methods of mantra. Ordinary bodhisattvas, for example, are unable to directly benefi t those who have amassed extremely negative karma or savages who have gone completely astray. Aside from merely making aspiration prayers to benefi t them in the future, they will be powerless to help them. Here, however, the skillful method of wrathful liberation can be used to directly cut through the stream of negative karma. Similarly, one is able to use the methods of mantra to manifest pacifying and other forms of activity as well, and to do so just as one intends and aspires. Th is is the enlightened activity of secret mantra. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Th is itself is the self-display of wisdom:Names, words, forms and the like, just as one intends,Like light appearing in darkness,Alchemical transformation and medicine.Furthermore, the aspiration prayers made by bodhisattvas are infi nite because they need to bring about the temporal and ultimate well-being of all sentient beings, doing so in harmony with the variations in character, apti-tude, and aspiration that beings possess. In a similar manner, the enlight-ened activities of secret mantra are also infi nite. By utilizing mantras, specifi c aspiration prayers can be brought to fruition. For this reason, this is also the perfection of aspiration.

Th ose with knowledge who are of the very highest capacity are capable of accessing the nature of the great Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 133Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1333/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134 l uminous essenceperfection without signs. Th ese practitioners of the path of liberation are able to gain mastery over all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Th is takes place once they obtain the empowerment into the display of self-awareness, thereby resolving all phenomena within the expanse of the innate nature of one’s own mind. With this ability, they need not work or strain to achieve their desired aims. Instead, they accomplish their aims by merely wishing to do so. Even if they have yet to attain this degree of mastery, their acts will become supreme by imbuing all actions with this view.By familiarizing themselves with the completion stage with signs, diligent individuals may gain the form of the energetic mind by merging two factors: the energies (referred to as “life force”) and form (meaning empty forms). Once this has come to pass, what they focus on will actually appear once they merely direct their attention to a remedial deity or another such factor. Th rough this, they will be able to accomplish the activity they are engaged in with ease, whatever its purpose may be.In the middling approach, activities are accomplished utilizing the devel-opment stage. Once the coarse and subtle clear appearances of the devel-opment stage alone have reached a point of perfection, one will be able to use supportive factors like mantras and mudrās to attain the entire range of worldly spiritual attainments, all the way up to those of the Unexcelled Realms. If the development stage is accomplished in this manner, one can carry out various activities simply through visualization.In the ordinary approach, activities are accomplished through mantra recitation. Here, individuals who have received empowerment and not let their samayas degenerate use a ritual and recite secret mantras through the medium of faith. When performed in this manner, one will be able to accom-plish various activities through the power of mantra, just as one wishes. Con-cerning the use of ritual, if we use an activity that pacifi es illness to illustrate this process, various factors, such as precise substances and visualizations, are employed in the recitation of mantra. Th ese details are clearly mentioned in each individual tantra. Without such rituals, moreover, activities will not be accomplished because the requisite causes and conditions will not be com-plete. Even if they are accomplished, their eff ects will be greatly delayed. On this approach, the Root Tantra of Mañjuśrī explains:Whether the state of a divine master,Or that of a master who is never divine,Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 134Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1343/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"luminous essence 135Such states can be accomplished through mantras.Still, if the ritual is skipped, their potency is lost.And:Th rough mantra endowed with ritual,Accomplishments are swift ly and fully obtained.And:It is held that by practicing mantra without ritual,Once, aft er spinning in circles for long,At some point accomplishment will be gained.Furthermore, it goes without saying that mantra will be accomplished if one is able to visualize in a precise manner. Yet even if one’s visualization is nothing more than merely devoted training, mantra will still be accom-plished if one has faith. Without faith, on the other hand, accomplishment is impossible. Th e previous text states:Without faith in mantra,Th ough one may exert oneself in various ways,Mantras will not be accomplished.Th us, samaya is not to be taught to the wicked.Furthermore, as far as faith goes, it should go without saying what will happen if one has faith free of doubt concerning the profound points, such as the conviction of knowing deity and mantra to be inseparable. On this point, the Tantra of the Th ree Practices of Yama’s Black Enemy states:Spiritual attainment is near for those with expertiseTh at is free from doubt concerning the natureOf the inconceivable reality.Even if one lacks this understanding, accomplishment is also possible if one faithfully recites one-pointedly and without hesitation, thinking to one-self: “Th is is how it is in the scriptures.” Th e same text states:Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 135Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1353/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136 l uminous essenceAlternatively, an ignoramus with stable faithIs near to the spiritual attainment of joining.On the other hand, spiritual attainment will not manifest for those who have lost faith. Such individuals lack the knowledge that comes from see-ing the profound nature of mantra in an accurate manner. Harboring a stub-born tendency to scrutinize in a way that obstructs spiritual attainment, they question mantra and its rituals, analyzing them in various ways. Th e text then reads:Intellectuals who ponder and analyzeAre far from the spiritual attainment of application.Th ough the guru may teach key instructions,If a student falls prey to indecision,It is taught that spiritual attainments are far away.Th ough the guru may conceal key instructions,If a student is not consumed by indecisionAnd regards the guru’s key instructions as sacred,Holding them in great esteem, attainment is certain.And:If one analyzes the application of mantras and substances,Spiritual attainments will not occur.If one is consumed by indecision,Has a fi ckle mind, or waning faith,Even if attainment is close at that time,One will undoubtedly revert back. Th erefore, faith is extremely important when it comes to mantra recita-tion. If one recites with faith, there will be accomplishment in mantra. If mantra is accomplished, one will attain the body of a knowledge holder of the desire or form realm and become immortal. In terms of speech, one will attain words of truth. Realization, moreover, will arise in the mind, and grad-ually one’s fortune will be equal to that of the superior deity. Hence, one must be diligent in faithfully reciting mantras.

Nevertheless, they are not the genuine activities that utilize the skillful methods of mantra, as is the case with the medicines explained in the art of healing.4.

In this way the path is quickly and easily Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 137Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1373/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138 l uminous essenceperfected. Hence, such enlightened activity has the exalted power, wondrous qualities, and function of the path of mantra. As written in the Accomplish-ment of the Single Hero Mañjuśrī:Th e practitioner of mantra, like a wish-fulfi lling jewel,Works diligently and benefi ts sentient beings.To summarize, the basis for such wondrous enlightened activity comes from having been empowered into a maṇḍala and having abided by one’s samayas. Enlightened activity must be accomplished by embracing whatever sādhana one is using with the view, meditation, and conduct, and not being without accomplishment, off ering , mantra, and mudrā. Th erefore, since all paths are subsumed under the basis of enlightened activity and its system of methods, enlightened activity does not dispense with any of these but encompasses them all. Ultimately, when one dwells eff ortlessly in the basic space of the great perfection of natural equality, without focusing on an action, agent, or object, enlightened activity will be eff ortless and spontaneously perfected. Th e Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Th e imputations of mistaken ideas are completely pure,And wisdom is none other than basic space.Th us, a link is formed through great compassionTh at appears to the six classes in every time and place.Th is concludes the explanation of the topic of enlightened activity, the per-fection of aspiration prayers.10. Mudrā Th is tenth section discusses mudrā in terms of its (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) principle, and (4) function.1. EssenceConcerning the fi rst of these, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Completely perfect through the magical net,Everything is sealed with supreme enlightenment.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 138Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1383/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"luminous essence 139As the secret reality ascertained,Th e seal of the essence is diffi cult to transgress.Th e word “seal” derives from the Sanskrit term mudrā, which means either to implant and symbolize, or a seal that is diffi cult to transgress. Th is refers to the extraordinary means that symbolize the enlightened body, speech, mind, and activities of great beings. When something is implanted with such a sym-bol, it becomes an embodiment of it and is diffi cult to transgress. 2. DivisionsTh is section has three parts: (1) a general presentation, (2) a specifi c presen-tation, and (3) a special presentation.1. General PresentationTh e general presentation concerns the seals of the (1) ground, (2) path, and (3) fruition. As for the seals of the ground, the natural seal of reality is the primordial purity of the nature of mind. Within the state of the great seal, sights, sounds, and awareness dwell as the nature of the deity, mantra, and dharma body.Th e temporary seal of the path is used to refi ne one’s experience of this nature. To this end, one establishes body, speech, and mind to be the play of the three secrets. Th is is done within the state of vajra wisdom, the reality of mind, the great seal of co-emergent great bliss.Th e ultimate seal of the fruition occurs when one has discovered all aspects of the body of self-occurring wisdom. At this point one acts with the incon-ceivable enlightened body, speech, mind, and activities for the welfare of all infi nite sentient beings that fi ll the entirety of space.2. Specifi c PresentationWhen discussed in detail, the seals of the path can be linked with either the development stage or the completion stage.1. Seals in the Development Stage In the development stage, there is the great seal of enlightened form, the dharma seal of enlightened speech, the samaya seal of enlightened mind, and the action seal of enlightened activity.

Seals in the Completion StageTh is is explained in terms of (1) the support of a spiritual consort, (2) the path where the seals manifest, and (3) the fruition of the four wisdoms. First is the support of the spiritual consort. Here the dharma seal is emptiness, the nature of all phenomena. Th is feminine perfection of knowledge is the true spiritual partner. Th e action seal refers to everyone that appears in female form with long hair, breasts, and so forth. Th e samaya seal is the mudrā of wis-dom, the goddess emanated from one’s own mind. Th e great seal is the empty form of the energetic mind, the nature of which manifests as the goddess. Sealing with these mudrās brings about the attainment of unchanging bliss. Second is the path where the seals manifest. Here the action seal serves as the support for the attainment of great bliss, symbolic wisdom. Th is includes union with a spiritual consort. Th rough such acts one comes to experience a mere approximation of the great bliss of the basic space of phenomena. Th is experience is the dharma seal. Th e great seal is to be free of all conceptual thought and to directly experience the innate. Th at which appears out of this state as the maṇḍala of enlightened body, speech, and mind in the ensuing attainment is the samaya seal.Th is can also be applied to the four joys: joy, supreme joy, innate joy, and joyless joy. In the tantras, joyless joy is presented as the third stage. Neverthe-less, here this refers to the state of joylessness that occurs once the pangs of desire have been exhausted. One may then wonder whether or not this con-tradicts the four joys as presented in all other scriptures. Th ere is, however, no contradiction. Both systems hold that innate refers to an instant of wis-dom that transcends any dichotomies of desire and nondesire, bliss and non-bliss. Th is occurs in the interval between the complete and total culmination of joy, which is brought about by bodhicitta descending to the tip of the jewel vajra, and the initial onset of desirelessness. Th erefore, there is no contradic-tion in presenting the fi rst three joys as four divisions, nor is there any con-tradiction in condensing the four joys into three instances. Th ese correlations are discussed in Nāgārjuna’s Ascertaining the Four Seals. Th ird is the fruition of the four wisdoms. Here the vajra body of appear-ance and emptiness is the action seal. Th e vajra speech of clarity and empti-ness is the dharma seal. Th e vajra mind of bliss and emptiness is the samaya seal. Th e vajra wisdom of awareness and emptiness—the essential indivisible equality of all of these—is the great seal. Hence, there are numerous ways to correlate the four seals in terms of Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 140Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1403/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"luminous essence 141signifi cance and context. Th ere are also innumerable names used to express diff erent seals, such as “the seal with signs” and “the seal without signs.”3. Special PresentationIn this context, it is primarily specifi c hand gestures that are being taught. Such hand mudrās serve to represent all the various forms of enlightened body, speech, mind, and activities of the wisdom deity. Since this also carries the meaning of nontransgression, here a general term is applied to a specifi c instance. Th e subclassifi cations of this division also encompass the four seals. Th e essence of the mudrā that is being shown is the samaya seal. Acts, such as transforming and releasing , are the action seal. Visualizing such things as the seed and reciting mantra is the dharma seal. Finally, one’s own presence as the form of the deity is the great seal. Th e foundation of all mudrās that are held by joining the two palms together is to either join one’s palms or to perform the vajra gesture, which is made by interlacing the fi ngers and joining the palms. Th e foundation of all mudrās that are held with the hands apart is the vajra fi st, in which the thumbs are placed inside and with the other fi ngers wrapped around them. Various root and subsidiary mudrās derive from these. Root mudrās include those of peaceful deities, such as those of the fi ve buddha families, as well as those of wrathful deities. Th e various subsidiary mudrās include those of invi-tation, bestowal of empowerment, and making off erings. In a beautiful and elegant manner, such mudrās should be integrated with the revolving lotus, the dancing lotus, and other such mudrās. Once completed, they should be released with a snap of the fi ngers.3. Principle Th is section explains (1) the principle of the seals and (2) how they are used to seal.1. Understanding the Principle of the SealsSeals can be classifi ed in six ways according to scripture and the viewpoints of specifi c individuals. Th e fi rst position holds that mantras and mudrās are diff erentiated in terms of their relation to ripened body or speech. In other words, a physical feature is termed mudrā, whereas a verbal expression is termed mantra. Hence, they state that such physical and verbal expressions are merely perceptible instances of the ordinary body and speech.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 141Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1413/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142 l uminous essenceTh e second position holds that these are symbols that represent the enlight-ened body, speech, and mind of the victorious ones, just as meaning can be conveyed through a gesture of the hand or a name. Th e third holds that such symbols possess the ability to bring about the spiritual attainments of activity and wisdom. Hence, they are thought of as mere instances of infallible interdependent origination.In the fourth position, mudrās and mantras are considered to be expres-sions of one’s own karma and, thus, included within ordinary body and speech. Nevertheless, such expressions are also recognized to manifest from the strength of the blessings of the thus-gone ones. Take, for example, the evil demon that was blessed by Mañjuśrī and subsequently gave teachings on the great vehicle. Th e sounds of his words were part of his own being, yet they also manifested from the blessings of the Noble One. Just so, those who hold this position consider mudrās and mantras to manifest from the bless-ings of the thus-gone ones, while being mixed with one’s own karmic per-ceptions.In the fi ft h position, mudrā and mantra are likened to the moon’s refl ec-tion. When the moon’s refl ection appears in a bucket of water, its image may seem to be in the water. Nevertheless, it is nothing more than the moon’s manifestation. Similarly, mantras and mudrās manifest from the blessings of the thus-gone ones and have the potential to bring about spiritual attain-ments. When those with samaya imagine themselves to be the deity itself and practice accordingly, a connection with the actual deity occurs in cor-respondence with their grasping. In this sense, mudrās and mantras func-tion without fail, in the same way that an actual object can be brought about through grasping at an object universal. In a similar manner, those who hold this position think that the deity itself can be accomplished from these symbols.Th e sixth position holds that mantras and mudrās are the manifestation of the ultimate form of the victorious ones, the great wisdom of totality. Wis-dom appears in this way having been blessed by the power of compassion and aspiration, just as the mind itself may manifest as objects and forms due to habitual tendencies. Hence, those who hold this position consider man-tra and mudrā to be divine in essence. In other words, they hold that there is no actual diff erence between mantra and mudrā and a deity that has attained the form of wisdom.Each of these six is superior to the previous position. Th ose who hold the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 142Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1423/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"luminous essence 143sixth position, which is supreme to all the rest, accurately understand the principles of mantra and mudrā. Hence, the principles of mantra and mudrā should be understood in this way alone. 2. Understanding How Mudrās Are Used to SealTh is section discusses (1) the reason for sealing and (2) the way to seal. First, as for the reason for sealing , in outer mantra, mudrās have three aspects. In terms of cause, they are emanated images of the utterly pure basic space of phenomena and great wisdom. In essence, they represent the infi nite gateways to complete liberation. In terms of result, they have the potential to bring about all activities and spiritual attainments. Hence, mudrās are the signs of great beings. Th ey cannot be transgressed or destroyed by anyone or any-thing. Th ey are the extraordinary seal of the sovereign king of dharma and are able to accomplish all forms of buddha activity. Th erefore, when one’s being is sealed with a mudrā, it will be freed from its bonds. Th e city of ignorance, the great negative force, will be conquered. Th e body will be stable and negative forces will be completely unable to aff ect it. Empowerments that are bestowed will be attained and activities will be accomplished without going to waste. If one does not lose sight of their nature, the samayas will not degenerate. Furthermore, since mudrās also pos-sess the symbol of the feminine, they are the hidden form of female deities. If they are shown to someone, they will be delighted by the very essence of samaya. Mudrās are used to seal for these and other reasons.Mudrās also fulfi ll these same purposes in inner mantra as well. Neverthe-less, according to this system they are primarily used to seal for the follow-ing reasons: Within the state of great wisdom—the spontaneously present mudrā—emanated mudrās are applied to rouse the awakened mind of great bliss, the indivisible nature of all bliss-gone ones and sentient beings, which dwells in the hearts of all beings. Th ey also bring about the eff ortless attain-ment of extraordinary mastery and carry out various enlightened buddha activities for the benefi t of other beings just as one desires.Secondly, as for the way to seal, according to outer mantra, when the real-ity of one’s being is sealed with a mudrā that symbolizes the deity, one will actually become the deity through the power of blessings. Th is is likened to the seal of a royal decree, which cannot be transgressed once enacted.In inner mantra, the mudrā is essentially the deity. As the mudrā seals the indivisibility of oneself and the deity, deity dissolves into deity; reality merges Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 143Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1433/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"144 l uminous essencewith reality; and wisdom revels in wisdom. Th rough this, one becomes the deity and the deity, in essence, becomes oneself. In this manner, methods are used to awaken and actualize the great bliss that dwells within. 4. PurposeUtilizing these unique methods allows one to accomplish all temporal and ultimate aims and carry out the activity of the buddhas. For this reason, they possess supreme qualities. In brief, by virtue of what they represent, mudrās subsume all dharmas of the ground, path, and fruition. Th is unique method of mantra is to be maintained by receiving the bestowed empowerment into a maṇḍala and abiding by the samayas. As such, it should be kept completely concealed from others. Mudrā accords with the view and meditation and is a particular instance of conduct and accomplishment. Mudrā is also the single unsurpassed method for pleasing the deity, carrying out activities, and arous-ing the power of mantra. Hence, it relates to all paths.In the ultimate meaning, all phenomena and all movements of body, speech, and mind are perfect and do not have to be transformed, bound, or released. As such, they are eff ortlessly perfected as the nature of mudrā. As stated in the Tantra of the Secret Essence:When the supreme gathering of the great sealIs joined with the endowment of means and knowledge,Motionless and unmoving , everythingDwells in the state of the great seal. And in the Awesome Flash of Lightning:When dwelling in a state of equality with the intrinsic nature,All movements and motionsAre mudrā, so the hero has said.Th is concludes the section on the great method of mudrā. 11. MantraTh is section has four parts: (1) essence, (2) divisions, (3) accessing the princi-ple of mantra, and (4) purpose.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 144Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1443/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"luminous essence 1451. EssenceConcerning the essence of mantra, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:A itself appears in manifold forms,As KA and the rest of the forty-two letters.Th e names of these sounds are all-inclusiveAnd are themselves surely the perfect complete king.Th e Sanskrit term mantra means, “to protect consciousness” or “protect the mind.” Th us, mantras link the knowledge of consciousness with the method of protecting. Alternatively, mantras can be said to protect the mental con-sciousness effi ciently and swift ly. In short, the term mantra refers to an extraordinary method. Here, in the context of discussing the essence of mantra, it refers to the essence of the mantra that is repeated using the letters of method and knowl-edge. Since this essence is established in four ways, it has the unimpeded abil-ity to accomplish spiritual attainments. To briefl y elaborate, mantras (1) are caused by letters, (2) are essentially established in four ways, and (3) have unimpeded ability in terms of eff ect.1. Letters: Th e Cause of MantrasFirst, in essence, the nature of distinct sound units are A and the rest of the sixteen vowels of knowledge, and the thirty-four consonants of method, such as the letter KA. Th ese fi ft y letters are the basis and source of all letters. Since OṂ and other such syllables are formations of these letters and are them-selves letters by nature, they as well can be referred to as such.Secondly, letters can be divided into four categories: letters that are pres-ent in the channels of the body, letters of the palace and deities, letters of magical emanation, and letters of symbolic words. Th e fi rst refers to the way in which letters are present in the radial channels of the body, as stated in the tantras. In this particular tantra, the syllables OṂ, ĀḤ, and HŪṂ are said to be located at the three places. Letters of the palace and deities are the seed syllables that one visualizes at certain places in the maṇḍala when meditating on a deity. Letters of magical emanation are clouds of letters that radiate out from the three secrets of the enjoyment body buddhas; they act for the welfare of beings through manifold emanations. Letters of symbolic Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 145Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1453/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146 l uminous essencewords are the verbal expressions of the individual sounds of a mantra. Th is also includes the verbal expressions based on the sounds of the words that are present within the ground, as well as the forms that symbolize them that are used in meditation. In the state of complete purity, clouds of letters manifest as the self-display of the wisdom of fruition.2. Th e Four Establishments: Th e Essence of MantraSecond is the explanation of the essence of mantra. Generally, the vari-ous conventional meanings subsumed within the states of thorough affl ic-tion and complete purifi cation can be elucidated using combinations of letters. Hence, all buddha activities are either directly or indirectly accom-plished using such letters. For this reason, among the objects experienced by worldly individuals, there is nothing more powerful or wondrous than let-ters. Relatively, these expressive and elucidating interdependent appearances are unceasing. Ultimately, however, there is nothing to express and thus no expressions either. Since these expressions themselves are not established in the slightest, they do not express anything at all. Even if this equality of the two truths is seen in terms of a single syllable, through this the four gateways of retention will be attained.More specifi cally, the mantras uttered by the Buddha are established in four ways: they are established by (1) the essence of reality itself, (2) by the nature of the subject, (3) through blessings, and (4) through power and force. Th e fi rst refers to the primordial essence of all letters being the equality of great emptiness. Th e second refers to the essence of each letter having an incontrovertible nature that manifests in a unique manner. Th ese fi rst two do not apply solely to mantras, but to all phenomena. Nevertheless, by virtue of these two facts, mantras are capable of aff ording blessings and unimpeded power. Th is, in turn, is due to the incontrovertible principles of interdepen-dence and reality itself. Th e latter, while being nothing at all, can give rise to the former, which can manifest as anything. Th e third refers to the fact that letters are established by the blessings of the buddhas. In attaining mastery over all phenomena, the buddhas emanate their own wisdom in the form of mantras, which vary in length from one letter up to many. Finally, the fourth refers to the fact that mantras, just like the power of medicines and jewels, possess the incontrovertible and unimpeded power to bring about the achievement of spiritual attainments.Since all verbalizations are primordially present in a state of purity and Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 146Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1463/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"luminous essence 147equality, in terms of the natural state, all manifestations of language are the maṇḍala of enlightened speech. To this, one may object that all the verbal expressions of sentient beings should have these same benefi cial eff ects. Sen-tient beings, however, do not realize this. Th us, not only do these benefi cial eff ects not occur, their verbal expressions actually become a cause for their own bondage as they fi xate on these self-displays as being ordinary. Th is is similar to the way fear might arise if one takes a rope to be a snake. Th is same principle holds for the relationships between movements and mudrā; between food, drink, and feast off erings; and so forth.One may also wonder whether or not the mantras created by the buddhas and those created by Brahma and other such fi gures are equal in strength. Th ere is a diff erence between these two categories from the point of view of appearance, as the former are blessed by the buddhas to benefi t those in need of guidance. Th ose mantras that are determined to be such by valid scriptures are unparalleled.One may further object that since all sounds are symbolic gateways to complete liberation, the number of mantras taught with respect to those in need of guidance should also be limitless. Moreover, since the root letters are blessed, all that is derived from such syllables would be said to be mantra. Yet again, since the Buddha’s enlightened speech, in all its various forms, knows no partiality or bias, everything would be enlightened speech. If this is the case, the objection goes, why should mantra recitation have diff erent eff ects than ordinary chatter and so forth?Mantras, however, are believed to be divine and are recited with faith for this reason, whereas this is not the case with other forms of speech. More-over, if a mantra is thought to be something ordinary and not seen for what it is, it will not be able to perform its intended function. Mantras are like nonconceptual wish-fulfi lling jewels. Infusing one’s being with the blessings of mantra, like the form of a moon refl ected on a body of water, necessitates the presence of faith and other conditions that set the stage for the spiritual attainments of mantra. Just as the moon’s refl ection cannot appear without water, mantras cannot function without the presence of faith and other such factors in one’s being.Nevertheless, this is not to say that simply hearing the sound of the Th us-Gone One’s awareness mantras through the power of the inconceivable ema-nations of the Buddha is completely pointless. Th e Fundamental Intent of Mañjuśrī explains:Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 147Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1473/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148 l uminous essenceReciting the mantras of the thus-gone onesIs, in this way, benefi cial.Even those who throw a glance,Will become followers.Th erefore, from the perspective of the way things appear conventionally, blessings occur once the mantras of the Buddha’s teachings come together with one’s own devoted interest. Because the right causes and conditions have been assembled, blessings do indeed arise, just as a sprout will shoot up once a seed, water, and the other necessary conditions are in place, and like the blessings that occur when an individual with a pure being meets with a disciple who sees him or her as realized.3. Unimpeded Ability: Th e Eff ect of Mantra It is not the case that the mantras established in this way do not have the power to accomplish both temporal and ultimate goals, the reason being that mantras are the essence of the deity. Th erefore, even at the level of an ordinary being , that which invokes the supportive strength of the thus-gone ones and carries out various activities is mantra. For those with ordinary experiential domains, when it comes to bringing about spiritual attainment, there is noth-ing in the world equal to mantra. Brahma, Īśvara, wish-fulfi lling trees, jew-els, and other such things . . . none of these can compete with even a fraction of mantra’s power. Th e profound view, meditation, and other such factors are objects only of those who have pure beings; they are not within the reach of common beings. Mantras, however, can be recited by all. Th is concludes the explanation of the essence of mantras.2. DivisionsTh is section has three parts: (1) general divisions, (2) specifi c divisions, and (3) special divisions.1. General DivisionsTh e general division concerns the ground, path, and fruition. As for the ground, all phenomena dwell primordially as great purity and equality, com-plete within the state of great bliss of the nature of one’s very own mind. Th is naturally luminous maṇḍala of the mind is termed “the reality of man-tra.” Th is is the mantra of the ground. Th e path of mantra refers to all paths Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 148Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1483/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"luminous essence 149in which mantras are used to swift ly and effi ciently protect the mind by uti-lizing the extraordinary practices of method and knowledge to actualize the mantra of the ground. Th e fruition is the actualization of the nature of mind as great bliss, the enlightened body of great wisdom. In being a sacred refuge and protector for all beings, it provides them all with benefi t and happiness.2. Specifi c DivisionsTh e term mantra can refer to various objects. Th e nature free from constructs, for example, may be called mantra. In the Complete Enlightenment of Vairo-cana, to give another example, the nature free from constructs is referred to as the very identity of secret mantra. Nondual wisdom is also termed man-tra. Th e same tantra states:Th is very nondual wisdomTh e Sage referred to as mantra.Also, the bodies of the deities that symbolize this nature are likewise referred to as mantra. Th e same text explains:To all these very mantras as well,Off er wondrous tormas.Furthermore, collections of scripture, as well as burnt off erings and other rit-ualistic methods, are also termed mantra. Hence, the word mantra is used in reference to various subjects. 3. Special DivisionsIn this particular context, the topic of discussion concerns mantras that are recited. Th e divisions that were outlined above were merely general divi-sions of the categories that are referred to by the term mantra. In general, all vehicles of mantra are referred to as such because they aff ord protection effi -ciently and swift ly. Th e application of this term specifi cally to mantras that are recited is due to their status as extraordinary methods.Th is variety of mantra is said to contain three general divisions: (1) secret mantra, (2) awareness mantra, and (3) retention mantra. In terms of the meaning they represent, the nature of these mantras can be correlated with Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 149Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1493/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"150 l uminous essenceemptiness, awareness, and unity, respectively. Alternatively, these three can also be applied in the reverse order. In terms of the symbolic form of the mudrā, the three types of mantra can be applied to the forms of two deities in union, a male deity, or a female deity, respectively. In terms of their own sym-bolism, it is also said that secret mantras are the form of the male deity, and the other two are the form of the female deity. Mantras can also be specifi -cally correlated with the rituals taught in the traditions of unsurpassed man-tra, outer mantra, and sūtra, respectively.In terms of cause and function, mantras can be classifi ed as follows. Extremely secret in essence, the wisdom of nondual method and knowledge manifesting as mantra serves to remedy misunderstanding. Th e identity of knowledge and wisdom manifesting in the form of mantra serves to rem-edy a lack of understanding. Finally, the nature of mindfulness and knowl-edge manifesting as mantra in the form of complete recall serves to remedy the degeneration of mindfulness. Even awareness mantras of male deities may have feminine suffi xes since they dwell in the feminine deity of the basic space of emptiness. Th ere are many such variations.Alternatively, mantras can be classifi ed as retention mantras in being blessed as mantras due to the attainment of the cause of retention; as aware-ness mantras in essentially being the embodiment of wisdom awareness; and secret mantras in being secret methods that are to be recited. Yet aside from classifying mantras based on conceptual distinctions, there is no essential dif-ference between them. In such ways, various correlations can be made.In particular, the mantras of any suitable maṇḍala involve the use of three types of mantra. First is the seed syllable, the root mantra that functions as the unerring cause. Second are the mantras that function as conditions for development, such as those that are recited during the development of a deity, the bestowal of empowerment, invocation, and off ering. Th ird is the recitation of the activity mantra, the essence of the deity that is repeatedly recited. Th e latter category also possesses further subdivisions, such as the mantra of the primary deity, the mantras of the retinue, collective mantras, and supplementary activity mantras. Mantras can also be divided into those of approach, accomplishment, and activity; root mantras, essence mantras, and inner essence mantras; and in other ways. Th ese various internal divisions are discussed in the tantras and practice manuals.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 150Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1503/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"luminous essence 1513. Accessing the Principle of Mantra Th is section has three parts: (1) cultivating conviction in mantra with pro-found knowledge, (2) dwelling in the observation of mantra with profound absorption, and (3) perfecting the conduct of mantra with profound dili-gence. 1. Cultivating Conviction in Mantra with Profound KnowledgeTh is section has two parts: (1) viewing the deity and mantra as indivisible and (2) dispensing with the three notions that obstruct that view.1. Viewing the Deity and Mantra as IndivisibleTh e principle of mantra should be ascertained via six designations. Th ese are the same six that were discussed in the context of mudrā. Among these, one should gain conviction in the inseparability of the deity and mantra, which is the last of these six designations. Furthermore, one should perceive mantra itself to be the deity by realizing that (1) ultimately, all phenomena are undi-vided within the expanse of purity and equality, the great dharma body, and (2) relatively, there is no diff erence between the actual form of the deity and its mantra, insofar as both are merely manifestations of wisdom that manifest for the welfare of those in need of guidance. 2. Dispensing with the Th ree Notions Th at Obstruct Th at ViewTh e fi rst notion to dispense with is the idea that deity and mantra are truly diff erent due to the qualities of their appearance. Th e wisdom of the bud-dhas can manifest in any way to those in need of guidance. As this is the case, they may appear as actual buddhas to guide some and as ordinary beings to guide others. Th ere is, however, no diff erence between these two, insofar as both are the play of the wisdom of a single buddha. Hence, in truth, there is no qualitative diff erence. Similarly, here as well the Buddha manifests in the form of mantra to the perspective of ordinary beings. Meanwhile, even if the deity directly appears as a result of accomplishing mantra, what has been accomplished is the deity itself manifesting as mantra. Hence, the way in which the mantra itself manifests as the deity simply serves to bestow spir-itual attainments upon those in need of guidance.Second, one should dispense with the perception that deity and man-tra are truly diff erent because they have diff erent forms. Some may get the idea that mantras are diff erent from the deity because they have entirely Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 151Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1513/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152 l uminous essencediff erent features. Th ey may think that, being simply verbal expressions and letters written on a page, they lack any wisdom or other such qualities of their own. If this were the case, however, the mind appearing in the form of material objects based on one’s habitual tendencies, as when one is dreaming , and the Buddha’s wisdom appearing as various enlightened bodies and pure realms, could not be subsumed under mind and wisdom, respectively. Moreover, when a single buddha manifests as the play of the infi nite magical net with its peaceful and wrathful deities, then only one of those forms could be the deity, whereas the rest could not because they all have diff erent features. In this way, it should be understood that, although deity and mantra appear in diff erent forms, they are none other than the play of wisdom.Th ird, one should dispense with the notion that deity and mantra are truly diff erent because one appears in one’s own being and the other appears in another’s. According to this line of thinking , mantras and mudrās are part of one’s own being , while the wisdom deity belongs to another’s. Hence, these two are diff erent. In response, it may be said that the deity of the defi nitive meaning is the natural state of all phenomena, the suchness of the ground of unity. Th is deity is the embodiment of self-occurring wisdom, the unifi ed form that occurs once one is rid of all temporary impurities. Not realizing that this wisdom appears as the manifold magical net, if one were to think that a so-called “deity of another continuum” truly existed in a limited fash-ion with a body, speech, and mind in some isolated location, it would have component particles and instants of time. It would not, therefore, pervade all times and places or become the wisdom form in all its multiplicity. It would then necessarily follow that any deity seen anywhere other than the place where a deity dwells at a single point in time would not be the actual deity. However, we cannot say that of all the buddha forms that appear instanta-neously in the sphere of perception of all the fortunate worldly beings in need of guidance, that one is the actual buddha and the rest are not. One must, therefore, train intelligently in the tradition of the great vehicle and understand that knowing the principle of buddhahood, at a bare minimum, is absolutely indispensable.Having off ered this general presentation, we will now bring the discussion back to the matter at hand. Mantras and other such factors may indeed appear to be part of one’s own being. Nevertheless, in terms of their real being, the equality of reality itself, there are no established separate streams of being. Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 152Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1523/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"luminous essence 153Moreover, this does not present any contradiction, even in terms of the way that things appear. What appears in one’s own mind may in fact appear to be something “other,” such as the appearances in a dream. On the other hand, groups of various disparate phenomena, such as the body, may appear to be a single phenomenon that is part of one’s own being.Th ough things appear in various ways, this is not how they actually are. Something may appear to be a part of one’s own being or another’s. What-ever the case, the appearance of mantra and mudrā carries out buddha activ-ity and is able to gradually lead one to the state of buddhahood. Th erefore, these appearances are held to be emanations of the wisdom of the bliss-gone ones. Th e way things appear to an ordinary mind cannot, on its own, negate the inconceivable experiential domains of the buddhas, who have attained mastery over all phenomena. Furthermore, the blessings of the buddhas may appear in the experiential domains of dreams, states of absorption, and direct sense perception, yet in truth, they cannot be established as anything other than one’s own self-dis-play. Th e moment something appears to oneself, it is one’s own self-display. As taught extensively in the scriptures, this can be established by reasoning based on the power of fact.Th erefore, according to the degree to which one’s own mind has been divested of impurities, the miraculous displays and blessings of the buddhas will manifest more and more. In the end, these impurities will be completely purifi ed and the way things actually are will manifest. Once this has come to pass, all the buddhas will be no diff erent than oneself and one will be no dif-ferent than all the buddhas. One will attain the body of wisdom, the intrinsic nature itself, a state of indivisibility with all the buddhas of the three times. Hence, one should cultivate conviction that, at this point in time, the bud-dhas appear in the form of mantras to our perspective, and thereby accom-plish both temporal and ultimate aims. Giving rise to this particular form of conviction in mantra is the primary cause for accomplishing it. Th ere-fore, this principle is extremely important. Th e Sādhana of the Single Hero Mañjuśrī states:Th rough the way of secret mantras, the deity as suchWill bestow all spiritual attainments.Th e practitioner of mantra who meditates on them,In accomplishing them, will gain accomplishment.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 153Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1533/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154 l uminous essenceAnd in the Request of Subāhu:Th e one who knows of karma and its ripeningEnters the forms of secret mantrasIn a way that agrees with all beings— To this guide of mantra I pay homage!While the Sambhūta states: For the embodied, the form of mantraEnacts a great deal of activities.And in the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara:Th e mantra itself is the form of YoginīAnd Yoginī herself is the form of the mantra.If one desires this exalted state,Do not separate these two.Such quotes can be found in other scriptures as well.2. Dwelling in the Observation of Mantra with Profound AbsorptionTh is section has two parts: (1) the main part of practice—clear absorption and (2) the support—embracing the practice with the view.1. Th e Main Part of Practice: Clear AbsorptionIn the main part of the practice, there are three principles: (1) clear appear-ance, (2) divine pride, and (3) the recollection of purity. First, the forms, spiritual life force, mantra chains, and radiation and absorption of light rays should be visualized with great clarity as the objects experienced in absorp-tion. Second, without thinking of the deity as something that merely appears before the mind, one should have the divine pride of being indivisible from the deity. Th ird, the deity should not be viewed as something that exists as an individual stream of being , in a limited form with characteristics of its own name and form. Rather, one should recall that it is the ultimate fruitional wisdom, the perfection of abandonment and realization, that manifests in the form of the deity and mantra.

Th e Support: Embracing the Practice with the ViewAll of these factors never stray from the primordial state of the indivisible truths of purity and equality, the basic nature of the sole sphere of the dharma body. With this understanding, one should dwell with one-pointed concen-tration, uninterrupted by other forms of contemplation. Moreover, in the context of calm abiding , clarity, stability, and purity constitute insight into things in their multiplicity, while embracing this with the view constitutes insight into things as they are. 3. Perfecting the Conduct of Mantra with Profound DiligenceTh is section has three parts: (1) the preliminary steps, (2) the main part, and (3) the conclusion.1. PreliminaryOne who has received empowerment and abides by the samayas should please his or her guru and, by assembling mantras and so forth, correctly under-stand the key instructions concerning the purity of mantras and how to recite them. 2. Main PartTh is section has three parts: (1) mental recitation, (2) whispered recitation, and (3) melodic recitation.1. Mental RecitationMental mantra recitation does not involve any lip movement or other such eff ort. Rather, here the practitioner focuses on the mantra chain and seed syl-lable at the heart center and recites the mantra repeatedly in the mind, as if the mantra were naturally emitting its own sounds. Th ere are two forms of mental recitation, simple mental recitation and mental recitation linked with the breath. Th e latter can itself be further divided into arrested recitation, vajra recitation, and vase breathing recitation. Th e fi rst of these is referred to as “arresting the life force and eff ort” and “restrained recitation.” Here, “life force” refers to the energies, while “eff ort” refers to thoughts or the movements of mind. Th us, all energetic movements and eff ortful thoughts are inwardly restrained and recitation takes place in the mind. Th rough this, physical and verbal eff orts are automatically blocked and extraordinary qualities are attained. With vajra recitation, the inhalation, Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 155Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1553/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156 l uminous essenceexhalation, and resting of the breath are linked with mantra and one concen-trates on the focal point without distraction. With vase breathing recitation, mantra recitation is joined with the fourfold vase breath and, again, recita-tion takes place in the mind.2. Whispered RecitationTh ough there is no melody in whispered recitation, sounds are whispered by applying a slight amount of eff ort to create motion in the lips and throat.3. Melodic RecitationTh ere are six forms of melodic recitation. Th e fi rst is a recitation that has ten qualities. Th e tone of the letters of the mantra should not be recited overly loud, soft , fast, or slow. Th ey should be recited without speaking to others, while undistracted, without missing syllables, without extra syllables, with pure syllables that are free from any imperfections in the nasal ending and the other subtle elements of the mantra, and with clear pronunciation, mean-ing that the mantra is recited correctly and without distorting the source, function, and other aspects of each individual letter. Th e second is the tone of expelling the breath in the cheeks. Here, the tongue is placed on the pal-ate, and the sound of the mantra is recited in a relaxed manner by expel-ling the breath through the nose as the air in the cheeks releases of its own accord, unperturbed and over an extended duration, producing a sound like the buzzing of bees. Th ird is the invocation of the melody of Brahma. In this approach, one recites the mantra in an enchanting manner, like the mel-ody of Brahma. Th e voice is pleasing , subtle, and modulated, with the teeth clenched shut. Fourth is the melodic sound of groaning and lament. Here, the lips are closed and the tongue is placed on the palate. With a faint tone like an abandoned camel calf, here one recites as though one were groaning in lament. Fift h is the thunderous deep and resonant tone. With this approach, the tone is intense and forceful like thunder. Th e syllables are recited slightly fast and intensely, like water rushing off the face of a cliff . Sixth is the tone of the wail of the vajra demon. Here, the lips are closed and the mantra is recited like a bee caught in a jar, with unclear syllables and an intense tone like the cry of an angry demon.Th ese six are also referred to as the six melodies, which are known as changka de’u, pangka de’u, dreng ngewa, tung ngewa, shartapa, and gartapa, respectively. Th ese melodies should be applied according to the context in Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 156Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1563/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"luminous essence 157which they are used. An alternative presentation lists the wail of the vajra demon as shartapa, the thunderous tone as gartapa, the recitation with one’s breath in the cheeks as changka de’u, the tone of groaning in lament as pangka de’u, intoning the sound of mantra as dreng ngewa, and the melody of Brahma as tung ngewa. Th ere are other presentations of the six tones as well.When reciting mantra in these ways, one should maintain mindfulness and vigilance, avoiding any physical, verbal, or mental distractions. One should recite mantras in the correct manner, without losing sight of the view and meditation.3. ConclusionIn between sessions, any adverse conditions that one encounters, such as being distracted by sense pleasures, should be avoided by understanding them to be obstacles. Moreover, one should not be discouraged if illness, negative forces, thoughts, or any other unfortunate circumstances develop. Rather, one should think that such occurrences are exhausting one’s negative karma. Any factor that is taught to pose a threat to the accomplishment of mantra, such as keeping company of degenerates, should be cast far away. Th ings that are prohibited in other situations, such as meat and alcohol, are to be trans-formed into benefi cial substances in secret mantra via mantra, visualization, and mudrā. One should, however, practice the various methods for gather-ing the accumulations and purifying obscurations, as these are conducive cir-cumstances for the accomplishment of mantra. To purify one’s being, one should have stable faith and fi rmly abide by the samayas and pledges one has made. One should also apply oneself to the instructions that develop the power of mantra, such as the recitation of the Sanskrit alphabet. Clothing, jewelry, food, drink, and all other such factors should be transformed into the play of wisdom by utilizing mantras, visualizations, and mudrās. In this way, adverse conditions should be avoided, while conducive circumstances should be assembled. Th rough this, the activity of accomplishing mantra should be brought to a point of culmination without letting up until mantra has been accomplished.4. PurposeMantras function as the causes and conditions for emanating the deities of the maṇḍala. Th ey are the principle of essential wisdom and the dharma seal. Th rough this, the deities are supremely pleased and the blessings of the Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 157Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1573/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158 l uminous essencebuddhas enter one’s being like brush catching fi re, thereby incinerating the dense thicket of the obscurations and facilitating the emergence of retention, absorption, wisdom, and all the other qualities of the path. Mantras allow one to accomplish and attain the entire range of mundane and supreme spir-itual attainments for the temporal and ultimate welfare of both oneself and others. Th erefore, even a wish-fulfi lling gem cannot illustrate mantra. Since mantras are themselves emanations of the buddhas, and since they carry out buddha activity and bring one to the state of buddhahood, they have a most sublime function. In brief, what we refer to as mantra is the cause and essence of both deity and maṇḍala. It is what bestows empowerment, in addition to being a specifi c form of samaya. Mantra is the extraordinary gateway that employs seed sylla-bles and other such principles to represent the view, and is the most sublime method to give rise to the profound view and meditation within one’s own being. Mantra is the context of certain forms of meditation and conduct, the supreme method for sādhana practice and enlightened activity, and also that which seals the mudrā. Th us, mantra encompasses all aspects of training and, in those contexts, is the sole essential dharma. Moreover, since the essence of mantra is the wisdom deity, the view and all other such factors provide access to its nature.In terms of their ultimate nature, mantras are equality, free of expressions and anything expressed. Hence, once all phenomena have reached a point of perfection within the expanse of the sole sphere of the dharma body, mantra will have reached a point of culmination and all the various forms of enlightened speech will be spontaneously present, without any need for intentional recitation. On this point, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:Th e aspects of the maṇḍala of the singular enlightened speechAre inconceivable and all-pervasive.Resounding as individual sounds, names, and words,Th ey are all the supreme seal of enlightened speech.Concerning dwelling in reality itself, it is said that, “settling without speak-ing is the king of mantras.” Meanwhile, each and every verbalization is also mantra. Th e Tantra of the Empowerment of Vajrapāni states:Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 158Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1583/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"luminous essence 159While dwelling in a state of equality,Whatever movements of the limbs occur,Whatever words are verbalized, All are the mudrā of secret mantra.Th is has been the section on the supreme method of mantra.Th ese last two sections conclude the clear explanation of the signifi cance of mudrā and mantra, the perfection of method.4. Conclusion: The Full and Complete EntrustmentTh is section has two parts: (1) entrusting the profound meaning of the tantra in a nondual manner and (2) the superiority of the recipients to whom this tantra is entrusted.1. Entrusting the Profound Meaning of the Tantra in a Nondual MannerSamantabhadra, Great Vajra Bliss, or Great Delight, is the teacher of this tantra. To his retinue of self-displayed wisdom, he called out this sincere advice:Hey ! Hey ! Th e nature or natural state of all phenomena through-out the ten directions and four times is primordially enlightened as great purity and equality. Th is nature, the very essence of the thus-gone ones, is known as the “secret essence,” “great perfection,” and by other such names. Th ough in truth we never stray from this primordial state of buddhahood, some do not realize this nature for what it is. In becoming obsessed with and fi xated on their own dualistic constructs, they are held and bound by the noose of their very own thoughts. Th is is similar to seeing a white conch as yel-low and other such examples. To avert this sort of delusion, the distinctions between the grounds and contexts of each individ-ual vehicle are systematically presented. Although there are vari-ous such presentations, they are nothing more than paths leading to this ultimate vehicle of the secret essence. At the end of their Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 159Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1593/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"160 l uminous essencejourney, buddhahood is achieved by entering this path. Th ese vehicles, therefore, are steps along the path that leads here.Hence, the buddhas possess the great wisdom that comes from perfecting the process of abandonment and realization. Th ey have wondrous and infi nite skillful methods for taming those in need of guidance, and there is nothing that they say that is not for the welfare of beings. On a temporal level, the various vehicles they teach each give rise to the abandonments and realizations of their respective paths, yet ultimately, they are methods that provide access to this secret essence.Due to this principle, the most sacred seal of all the thus-gone ones throughout time and space is this great secret, the secret essence. Since there is no transcending it and it cannot be destroyed by anyone, this is the unique seal of buddhahood itself, like the seal that marks the command of a king. Hence, one who realizes this in the correct manner and imparts it fl awlessly to another is no diff erent from me, Samantabhadra. Empowerment as well will be naturally perfected. Th erefore, be sure to uphold this text and do not let it disappear. Th ere are two ways to “uphold” the dharma: to practice the dharma of realization and to explain the dharma of scripture. Th erefore, this tantra is upheld by realizing its meaning and then communicating it to others. Th is is the implicit entrustment. Once one has internalized this profound nature of reality, one will be indivisible with the wisdom mind of the teacher of this tantra. Empowerment will also be perfected since empowerment here means simply to give rise to this sort of profound wisdom.For these reasons, if one turns one’s back on the meaning of this secret essence—the primordial enlightenment of all that appears and exists—while doing such things as granting empowerments and explaining tantras, it will merely be a superfi cial charade. Th is is not what it means to uphold the tan-tra. It is even possible that those with inferior intellectual capacity will let this tantra go to waste, as stated in the King Tantra of the Great Black One:Senseless masters with no knowledge of the supremely profound will not even recall the words “nondual wisdom.”Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 160Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1603/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"luminous essence 161Th erefore, when explaining the signifi cance of great purity and equality, it is necessary to impart such teachings without departing from the way to elu-cidate according to the key instructions of the lineage of knowledge holders. Do not base your teachings on the discussions of childish, small-minded ped-ants, who only grasp certain terms that they readily understand. Explaining the profound signifi cance of this tantra incorrectly is an extremely grave mistake. Th e Tantra of All-Embracing Awareness states:Without the eye of dharma,Whatever boundless words one usesTo express the conventions that convey meaning,One will be unable to discern whether it is correct or mistaken.Savage individuals who are concerned with wordsAre on the grounds and paths of training.However many hundreds of thousands of statements are made,Th ey should not be taught to others.If taught, such thieves of the vajra teachingsWill fall to Vajra Hell.If hypocrites who are not well versedIn its meaning were to teach this dharmaWhile remaining in ignorance themselves,Th ey will have committed an act more seriousTh an murdering every sentient being.Th is entrustment of the tantra was given in actuality to the self-displayed ret-inue and the Lord of Secrets. By implication, however, it was also entrusted through the power of intent to the mother deities and ḍākinīs who guard the samaya, and also to those individuals of the future who possess the eye of dharma.Th ere is also another way of explaining this, though in truth there is no dif-ference between the two. In this approach, each couplet, beginning with the words, “Hey! Hey! . . . the ten directions and four times . . . ,” is said to con-dense the entire meaning of the tantra into four types of appearance. Respec-tively, these four provide instructions on (1) the natural appearances of the ground (which are to be realized), (2) the deluded perceptions of misguided beliefs (which are to be purifi ed), (3) the appearances of the path by those in Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 161Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1613/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"162 l uminous essenceneed of guidance (which are to be traversed), and (4) the fruitional appear-ances of the bliss-gone ones (which are to be attained). Hence, the tantra is held to have been entrusted to the retinue by providing instructions on these four types of appearance.2. Th e Superiority of the Recipients to Whom Th is Tantra Is EntrustedWhat all the thus-gone ones of the ten directions master is none other than this ultimate secret of the enlightened body, speech, and mind. Th us, in being designated as the wisdom of the noble ones, it is the ultimate defi nitive mean-ing. In teaching the meaning of the natural state as it is, the entire range of extreme exaggerations and denigrations are thoroughly pacifi ed. Th is reality, the secret essence, is perfect, supreme, and sublime.Th is is the secret essence insofar as this nature emerged from the basic space of the defi nitive mind of Samantabhadra and was then taught to the retinue or, alternately, because it is the profound secret of the victorious ones. Th at which emerges from the expanse of Samantabhadra’s enlightened mind, the basic space where reality is ascertained and where exaggerations and deni-grations have been pacifi ed, is the individual that realizes the meaning of this tantra. Th is is so because, in the way that waves well up from the ocean, the self-expression of wisdom appearances emerge from the basic space of the ground, which is inseparable from the realization of all the victorious ones of the three times. Hence, individuals who correctly realize their own natural state are none other than this state.Such an individual will be confi rmed by glorious Samantabhadra, the teacher of this tantra, who will grant a prophecy that he or she will not return and will swift ly attain buddhahood. Like the eldest son of a univer-sal emperor becoming crown prince, such an individual will be the sacred off spring of the bliss-gone ones. Hence, they are said to be “born from the enlightened mind of all the buddhas” since they arise from this secret of the enlightened mind.Th erefore, those who impart this tantra to others are beings of awareness, and they will be prophesied to dwell upon the supreme and most sublime of all grounds, the so-called “ground of the knowledge holder,” “the ground of the vajra holder,” “the ground of supreme method and knowledge,” “the thir-teenth ground of buddhahood,” and “the ultimate ground.” Said diff erently, when a beggar is trying to fi nd a treasure of jewels that is buried beneath his Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 162Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1623/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"luminous essence 163home, those who have yet to see the treasure may indeed refer to him as a beggar. Nevertheless, he is also rich, in the sense of having defi nitively estab-lished himself as the owner of the precious treasure. Likewise, this is also lik-ened to having hooked a fi sh but not yet landed it. Th ough it may still be in the water, it is similar to having it on dry land. Just so, here one is said to dwell on the ground of perfection.In brief, the most sublime of all the contexts, or grounds, of the lower vehi-cles is the ground of this ultimate mantra vehicle, for this is the realization of self-occurring wisdom—the naturally luminous maṇḍala of mind. In other words, it is the realization of the reality of mantra that sets this ground apart. With this realization, one can be called a “knowledge holder,” a “vajra holder,” and a “mantra wielder.” By merely freeing oneself from doubt and gaining certainty concerning the reality of mantra, one will be prophesied to become a nonreturner. If it can be said that merely seeing the symbolic illustrative maṇḍala brings the benefi t of not returning and attaining buddhahood, why even mention that this will be the case if one realizes the true maṇḍala that is illustrated, the reality of mantra—indivisible purity and equality.Here, what we refer to as “realization” is the certainty that comes about once a beginner has used the faculty of knowledge to cut through superim-positions. Th erefore, beginners who have entered the ground of mantra in the correct manner, no matter how lowly, are destined for enlightenment, equal in fortune to a nonreturning bodhisattva. Moreover, since their paths are even swift er than the bodhisattvas, their destinies are even equal to those in their last existence, and so on. Here, in saying “entered in the correct manner,” what is meant is that one has received empowerment and gained conviction in the wisdom of the empowerment’s nature—the great purity and equality of all that appears and exists. Hence, one must strive to gain conviction in the reality of mantra. As stated in the Vajra Mirror:To reveal the tantra of the wisdom of self-awarenessIt is manifested through the awareness of self-display—Th is is the supreme knowledge holder. Yet even without the power of spontaneously present absorption, One is unswayed by bodhisattvas training on the grounds,For one’s experiential domain is the same as the bliss-gone ones’.Th ey will receive the confi rmation of an awareness being.Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 163Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1633/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"164 l uminous essenceIn the Sūtra Th at Gathers All Intents, it is said:To elucidate the secret enlightened mindOf the victorious ones, having realized it oneself,Is the most supreme of all empowerments—Th e empowerment of the three worlds.And:Th e blessings and qualities that come from realizing the essential meaningFor just an instant cannot be fully expressed by the victorious ones.Ultimate goodness and all meritCan be likened to the dust on a fi ngernail,While generating the vajra essence just onceIs equal to a vast maṇḍala of earth.For these reasons, the knowledge holders are unrivaled throughout the world as objects of veneration. Again, the Sūtra Th at Gathers All Intents explains:To such a sacred meaningful being,Th roughout all of the three times,All of the victorious bliss-gone onesFrom all the realms in the ten directionsCome, paying homage with praises and interest.And:Even if those who hold the secret vajra essenceWere to engage in no activities other thanMounting a chariot, a horse, or otherwise,Th e victors would honor their mount with the crowns of their heads.And in the Subsequent Tantra of the Secret Gathering:Whoever sees or touches one who has accomplished the main deity,Clearly remembers him or simply hears his name,Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 164Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1643/11/09 3:42:51 PM3/11/09 3:42:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"luminous essence 165Shows faith or only does one of these,Will view that person as vajra enlightenment and always pay homage.Furthermore, the benefi cial qualities that come from merely becoming inter-ested in the approach of secret mantra are limitless.

Th is concludes the general overview of the text, in which the points covered in the subject matter of the tantra were condensed into the three continua and eleven principles. 3. Extensive Explanation of the Meaning Expressed through the Words of the TantraFor a more extensive presentation of the expressions employed by the tantra, one may consult the clear explanations of Rongzom and Longchenpa. Th is overview of the great king of tantras, using study and contemplation to elimi-nate superimpositions concerning the approach of the path of the unsurpassed mantra, provides access to this approach. Th ese few vital points, moreover, were given in a condensed manner according to the general lineage of the knowledge holders, but especially according to the enlightened viewpoints of the Omniscient Lord of Dharma and glorious Rongzom Mahāpaṇḍita. Nevertheless, experiencing these profound vital points nakedly in one’s own being depends on whether or not one has encountered a qualifi ed master with experience of the key instructions of the lineage of knowledge holders and Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 165Lumnous Essence_Final.indd 1653/11/09 3:42:52 PM3/11/09 3:42:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"166 l uminous essencethe lineage of blessings. From such a master, one must be ripened through empowerment, receive the blessings of the true lineage, and listen to the pro-found and liberating key instructions directly from his or her mouth.Th e meaning that is taught in the precious tantra section of the Nyingma’s mantra tradition is contained in these profound key points on mantra that are transmitted orally from the mouths of the knowledge holders. In other traditions, these points are not fully expressed. Candrakīrti similarly states:Aside from this, elsewhere this dharmaIs not genuinely found. Similarly, elsewhere, the tradition that originates here is absent. O learned ones, of this be sure.Th erefore, keeping in mind how rare they are, these teachings should be treasured and maintained. It is inappropriate to off er them wantonly to the faithless and narrow minded. Th e celestial ḍākinīs, moreover, are said to safe-guard teachings like this on the profound meaning of mantra as though they were the essential blood fl owing through their hearts. Hence, it should be kept secret from those who are not fi t to receive such teachings.
