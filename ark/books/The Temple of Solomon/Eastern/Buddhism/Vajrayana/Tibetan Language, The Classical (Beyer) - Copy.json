The flight of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama toIndia, where he was followed by close to a hundred thousand of his fellow Tibetans, created a nation in exilededicated above all to the preservation of the unique cultural institutions of its homeland. Not surprising, then, thatduring the past three decades the academic study of Tibet has been radically transformed. No longer the specialpreserve of adventurer-scholars able to mount expeditions to the Land of Snows, or of philologically oriented\"buddhologists,\" whose Tibetan researches were almost exclusively confined to the translations of Sanskrit texts,Tibetan studies increasingly came to focus upon the indigenous Tibetan traditions of religion, learning and art thatare the primary interests of Tibetans themselves.Prominent among those whose scholarship reflected the changed conditions for research during the first twodecades of Tibetan exile was a specialist in the field of Buddhist Studies, Stephan Beyer, then of the University ofWisconsin, whose superb contribution to the documentation and interpretation of Tibetan Buddhist ritual, The Cultof Tara, marked the first fruits of his wide-ranging researches. After the late seventies, however, Steve increasinglydevoted his energies to a career in law, having completely abandonedor so it was widely rumoredhis work inTibetan and Buddhist Studies. I was therefore surprised and delighted to learn, after I joined the faculty of theUniversity of Chicago in 1986, that Steve was both in Chicago (with the firm of Sidley & Austin) and that in hisspare time he had remarkably completed a grammar of literary Tibetan, which he had begun at the University ofCaliforniaBerkeley some ten years before. In 1988 Steve sent me a copy of the manuscript. I immediately felt it tobe an extremely exciting work, reflecting throughout the author's wide-ranging knowledge of Tibetan literature, inits many genres and forms, ancient and recent.A distinctive feature of Steve's approach to the Tibetan language is his almost complete abandonment of themorphological and syntactic categories, borrowed from Indo-European grammars, that have traditionally informedtextbooks of Tibetan. The \"canonical\" status of this mismatching was reinforced both by indigenous Tibetangrammatical tradition, which derived its own analytic and descriptive categories from India, and by the emphasis, < previous pagepage_xxinext page >"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"page_xxiifile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_xxii.html[8/7/2010 9:51:53 PM]< previous pagepage_xxiinext page >Page xxiiin Western philological circles, on the study of literary Tibetan primarily as an adjunct to the study of SanskritBuddhist texts. For those who were inclined to direct their attention primarily to works of Tibetan authorship epic,history, biography, poetry, and so forthit has long been clear that Indo-European models were both inadequate andmisleading, but the effort to correct the powerful disposition to continue to adhere to them was largely limited, as itwas in Jacques Bacot's still useful Grammaire, to the enumeration of the so-called \"particles.\" And while it is truethat linguists specializing in Tibeto-Burman have generally avoided the sanskritizing inclinations of thephilologists, they have by-and-large not addressed their work to those who study Tibetan in order to actually readTibetan literature. The Classical Tibetan Language, therefore, calls for the student of literary Tibetan to rethink theTibetan language fundamentally.In terms of its extraordinarily thorough treatment of the phenomena one encounters in literary Tibetan, and theinsights that mark virtually every page, The Classical Tibetan Language is a work without precedent. It is my beliefthat the rethinking it calls for is essential for the realization of the creative potentialities of contemporary Tibetanstudies, and that such controversy as it will perhaps arouse will significantly contribute to the creative growth of thefield. Steve gives us a tantalizing glimpse of some possible lines of exploration in his deeply penetrating, yetappropriately playful, remarks on Tibetan poetry and poetics. Our rethinking of the Tibetan language is not to be alinguistic exercise plain and simple: we must inquire into the manner in which Tibetan writers used and thuscontinually rethought their own language, forming of it a unique medium for a distinctively Tibetan heritage oflearning, insight and wit.MATTHEW KAPSTEINCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITYVESAK 1991 < previous pagepage_xxiinext page >"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"page_xxiiifile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_xxiii.html[8/7/2010 9:51:53 PM]< previous pagepage_xxiiinext page >Page xxiiiPrefaceIn 1975, I accepted an appointment as a visiting associate professor at the University of California at Berkeley, andI looked around for a nice portable project to take with me. It is a measure of my innocence that I decided to startwriting a grammar of classical Tibetan. Now, more than fifteen years later, the project is about as finished as I amever going to make it. During those fifteen years, I returned to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, abandonedmy tenured appointment, and began a career as a trial lawyer with the firm of Sidley & Austin in Chicago. Duringthat time, too, it would be fair to say that my work on this grammar was sporadic. Yet somehow, during all thoseodd moments, a stack of handwritten notes about two feet highexamples from the classical literature, attempts attheorizing, jumbles of cross-referencesbecame the product you now have before you. My motive was simpletomove the Tibetan language from my head to paper. I hope someone finds the result useful.I am not a Tibeto-Burman linguist; but I believe that the reader of classical Tibetan texts should have some senseof the place of the language in the speech communities of the world. References in this text to Tibeto-Burmanlanguages other than Tibetan are based on several secondary sources, chief of which is Paul K. Benedict, Sino-Tibetan: A Conspectus (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972), as edited and annotated by JamesMatisoff, and David Bradley, Proto-Loloish, Scandinavian Institute of Asian Studies Monograph Series No. 39(London: Curzon Press, 1979). Comparative citations of Tibeto-Burman forms are largely taken from these tworemarkable compilations. In addition, I have relied on the stream of works produced by the Summer Institute ofLinguistics on the languages of Nepal, in particular the various works of Warren W. Glover on Gurung and theworks in the four volumes of Austin Hale and David E. Watters, Clause, sentence, and discourse pattems inselected languages of Nepal, Summer Institute of Linguistics Publications in Linguistics and Related Fields 40(Kathmandu: Summer Institute of Linguistics and Tribhuvan University, 1973).

No writer could hope for abetter or more thorough reader, or for a more discerning critic. Thanks, too, to Professors James Matisoff of theUniversity of California and F. K.

Finally, I want to thank my friends and law partners Mike Davis, Bill Richmond, and Doug Fuson.Their friendship and support helped me write this book, even though they did not know it.One final note. If you want to learn classical Tibetan, you can do no better than to sit down and read A Tibetan-English Dictionary by H.A. Jäschke, originally published in 1881 and reprinted several times thereafter. Jäschkewas a Moravian missionary in Ladakh, and I do not think that any other scholar of Tibetan has ever equalled thelinguistic insight exhibited in this dictionary. And if you want to learn how to THINK ABOUT classical Tibetan,you should sit down and readtwiceJames A. Matisoff, Variational Semantics in Tibeto-Burman, Occasional Papersof the Wolfenden Society on Tibeto-Burman Linguistics 6 (Philadelphia: Institute for the Study of Human Issues,1978), which is simultaneously one of the most sensible and sensitive books on doing Tibeto-Burman linguistics Ihave ever read.STEPHAN V.

It is not a complete surveyof all aspects of Tibetan grammar, although I have tried to include everything I thought it was important to know.It is intended to describe the READING of classical Tibetan; therefore it will not attempt to teach the reader tospeak either Old Tibetan or some modern Tibetan dialect.1 Rather my aim has been to provide procedures for theunderstanding of TEXTthat is, coherent discourses with literary or philosophical content, whose authors used theresources of their language to convey meaning.Moreover, this book describes the reading of CLASSICAL Tibetan. I have excluded from systematic considerationthe modern newspaper language at one end and the language of translated Indic texts at the other. This leaves asufficiently immense corpus of written Tibetan material for us to work from.21 This limitation has made the descriptive task much easier. A RECOGNITION GRAMMAR such as this neednot incorporate the output constraints required in a PRODUCTION GRAMMAR, under the assumption that areader simply will not encounter syntactically ill-formed sequences, whereas a beginning speaker may wellproduce them. For example, a production grammar of English would require both a rule to produce thesequences goodness and correctness and a constraint on the same rule to prevent the sequences ?trueness or?strongness (as opposed to truth or strength). But a recognition grammar would need only a rule allowing suchsequences as goodness or correctness to be interpreted when encountered. If trueness or strongness should turnup in a text, they could be processed by the same rule; if not, the question does not arise.2 I think it is fair to say that the translated materials have been more intensively studied than works originallycomposed in Tibetan, because of the primarily Indological interests of many scholars of Tibetan; most existingtextbooks reflect this interest. There can be no doubt, of course, that the classical language, as here defined, isclosely related to the translation language. But it is clear too that the language of the translations exhibits itsown peculiarities, including occasionally opaque attempts at reproducing Sanskrit syntax. These peculiarities, Ifirmly believe, are best analyzed from the point of view of the grammar of native Tibetan works, rather thanthe other way around. < previous pagepage_1next page >"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"page_2file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_2.html[8/7/2010 9:51:55 PM]< previous pagepage_2next page >Page 2Finally, I hope to introduce classical Tibetan as a LANGUAGE, with a history, with a range of styles, and withongoing processes of creation and change. Too often the Tibetan language is seen either as a poor substitute forunfortunately vanished Sanskrit texts, or as a spiritual code whose value lies solely in the message it concealswiththe result that the language itself is neglected as a medium of great range, power, subtlety, and humor. I hope torescue Tibetan from its subordination to Indic criteria, and to help the reader proceed not only with somegrammatical confidence but also with an awareness of the individuality and literary potential of the language. Ihope to provide the reader with conceptual tools for an intelligent and critical reading of Tibetan texts. I hope toshare some of my affection for the Tibetan language.Figure 1Dbyans-tsan-ma, goddess of music and speech < previous pagepage_2next page >"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"page_3file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_3.html[8/7/2010 9:51:59 PM]< previous pagepage_3next page >Page 32Transliteration1.

Defining TibetanTibetan is a language spoken primarily on the high plateau north of the Himalayas. It is related to a number ofHimalayan languages, such as Gurung and Magar, whose speakers were a traditional source of recruits for theBritish Gurkha forces. It is also related to several languages, such as Rgyarong and Minyag, spoken on the greatnorthern plains by nomadic tribes traditionally called \"western barbarians\" by the Chinese.1 Tibetan is moredistantly related to Burmese; even more distantly to languages spoken by Naked Nagas and other hill tribes ofAssam; and more distantly still to Chinese. Tibetan has had a writing system since the seventh century, borrowedfrom an Indian prototype. India, in fact, has had a massive cultural impact on Tibet; but Tibetan itself is unrelatedto Sanskrit or any other Indic language.We can define Tibetan as that language in which we find the word bdun \"seven\" and its cognatesparticularly asopposed to the word *snis and its cognates found everywhere else among the Tibeto-Burman languages. Forexample, we find Rgyarong snyis, Horpa zne, Kanauri stis, Garo sni Kachin t, Burmese hnats, Sgaw nwi,Taungthu nöt, Gurung ni, the ancient Zhangzhung snis, and perhaps even Old Chinese *tshyet \"seven.\"2 None ofthese1 Middle Chinese *bhywan \"barbarian\" may in fact be a loanword from Old Tibetan bon \"shamanicreligion\" or a related word in one of the Hsi-fan languages.2 Another apparent innovation in Tibetan is the word khyod \"you\" and its cognates, as opposed to *nan \"you\"and its cognates found in other related languages-for example, Chepang nan, Kachin nan, Burmese nan, Lusheinan, Sgaw na, Pwo na, Dhimal na, Nung na, Phunoi naN, Bisu nan, Akha naw, Mpi non, Rgyarong no, Minyagna, and perhaps Old Chinese *nyo and *ñia \"you.''

But when we find Baltibdun, Purig rdun, Ladakh dun, Golok wdan, Amdo din, and Lhasa City tüN \"seven,\" we know we are dealing witha series of DIALECTS within the Tibetan language.2. Tibetan and Related LanguagesWhen we say Tibetan is related to another languagesay, Burmese or Chinesewe mean that the languages are bothdescendants of an earlier language no longer in existence. Frequently such a hypothetical ancestor is proposed toaccount for many such offspring; this common ancestor is then often named after those two of its descendants withthe oldest written recordsfor example, Proto-Tibeto-Burman, which is the hypothetical language from which allTibeto-Burman languages have come, or Proto-Sino-Tibetan, which is the hypothetical language from which havecome not only the Tibeto-Burman languages but Chinese as well.When comparing languages to see if they are related, random correspondences of words of course prove nothing.The apparent cognates could just be accidental: compare Tibetan rgyal \"king\" with English royal~regal. Morefrequently such apparent cognates are loan words, in one direction or the(footnote continued from previous page)Burmese mran, Kanauri ran, Manchati hran, Bunan srans, Haka ran, Lisu amu, Phunoi moN, Bisu ,Akha mah, Mpi myun, Rgyarong bro-mbro, and perhaps Old Chinese \"horse.\" However, in severalarchaic texts from Central Asia, we find, to our delight, alongside Old Tibetan rta \"horse,\" the word rman,which apparently means something very much like \"horse\"-for example, in a mythological text from thecaves near Tun-huang, in the couplet rta-skad ni tsher-tsher, rman-skad ni tsher-tsher ''In horse language,yes, tsher-tsher! in steed language, yes, tsher-tsher!\" or in the couplet rta bzugs ni gnam-la bzugs, rmanbzugs ni dgun-la bzugs \"The horse dwells, yes, dwells in the sky; the steed dwells, yes, dwells in theheavens,'' or, again, rta ni log-pa tshe, rman ni mkhris-pa tshe \"The horse, yes, his revulsion was great; thesteed, yes, his bile was great.\" In the administrative correspondence recovered from the Tibetan garrisons inCentral Asia, we find, as we might expect, frequent references to horses, but almost always as rta. Still, theword rman lingers in the collocation rman-rogs \"horse attendant ® groom,\" and, perhaps, in the propername rman-sbyin \"Horse Giver.\" By the time of the classical texts the word rman has disappeared entirely.It seems clear that this Old Tibetan rman is related to Proto-Tibeto-Burman *mran \"horse,\" and wasreplaced by Old Tibetan rta \"horse\" during the seventh centuryin effect, before our eyes. < previous pagepage_8next page >"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"page_9file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_9.html[8/7/2010 9:52:03 PM]< previous pagepage_9next page >Page 9other: this might be the case with words such as classical Tibetan dza Middle Chinese *jha \"tea,\" or classicalTibetan dzag Middle Chinese \"robbery,\" where, as one Sinologist has put it, too close a likeness is evenmore suspect than too distant a one. But what makes it likely that, say, Tibetan and Chinese are related languagesis a SYSTEMATIC correspondence among their wordsfor example, the fact that in both languages the word for \"I''(Old Tibetan na, Old Chinese *na) and \"five'' (Old Tibetan l-na, Old Chinese *no)both have velar nasal initials, orthe word for \"three\" (Old Tibetan g-sum, Old Chinese )and \"kill\" (Old Tibetan SAD, Old Chinese *sat)bothbegin with a dental fricative. It is only on such a systematic basis that we are justified in assuming that Tibetan andChinese derive from a common ancestor.Technically speaking, the only way actually to demonstrate that two or more languages are cognate descendants ofa common ancestral language is to reconstruct the common language from which they descended. Suchreconstructions have been cited as the most triumphal vindication of Indo-European comparative linguistics. Yetsimilar attempts to reconstruct earlier stages of Tibetan and related languages have encountered serious difficulties.You know ek, that in forme of speche is chaunge Withinne athousand yer, and wordes tho That hadden prys now wonder nyceand straunge Us thenketh hem, and yet they spake hem so, Andspedde as wel in love as men now do.Geoffrey Chaucer, Troylus and CriseydeFor one thing, such reconstructions must take account of literally hundreds of related languagesoverwhelminglyunwritten and, until recently, poorly recorded and described. For another, the words which are being compared inthese language are remarkably compact. For example, we find classical Tibetan grog-ma, Burmese \"ant.\"Are these words cognate? Additional comparisons from other languages do not seem immediately helpful:Rgyarong korok and Kiranti khorok seem related to the Tibetan grog, while Lahu , Lisu bawlaw, and Mpipihoseem related to the Burmese < previous pagepage_9next page >"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"page_10file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_10.html[8/7/2010 9:52:03 PM]< previous pagepage_10next page >Page 10. Yet we also find Miri , Dafla torub, and Nung . What are we to make of this?One proposed solution postulates a Tibeto-Burman word *rwak \"ant,\" to which Lahu and Burmese added a prefix*p- related to the word for \"insect\" (compare, for example, classical Tibetan Nbu, Burmese pui, Mpi pi \"insect\"); towhich Tibetan, Rgyarong and Kiranti added a *k- ''ANIMAL'' prefix; to which Nung added an *s- \"ANIMAL\"prefix (compare, for example, Old Tibetan Swa, Burmese sa, Kachin san, Nung sa, Kanauri sya \"deer\"); and towhich Miri and Dafla added a late *d- prefix of uncertain signification. Now such explanations can quicklybecome uncomfortably ad hoc, and there is often an unexplained residue in any event; for example, we are still leftto account for Gurung nabbru \"ant.\"3 But such are the challenges faced by the Tibeto-Burman comparativist.2.1. Tibetan and ChineseScholars have long suspected that Tibetan is related to Chinese, and have postulated a Sino-Tibetan family oflanguages descended from a hypothetical Proto-Sino-Tibetan ancestor. The relationship between Tibetan andChinese, however, is certainly not obvious if we compare contemporary Tibetan with contemporary Chinese. InPeking city the old word for \"dog\" is pronounced tshüan but in Lhasa city is pronounced chi while a Peking fish iscalled yü but a Lhasa fish is called ña.But thanks to the extraordinary conservatism of Tibetan writing on the one hand, and the scholarly detective workof such Sinologists as Bernhard Karlgren on the other, we can reconstruct these same words in Old Tibetan andOld Chinese:4 when we compare Old Tibetan khyi with Old Chinese3 Unlike many words in Gurung, nabbru does not appear to be a loan word from Nepali, where the wordfor \"ant\" is kamilo. Nepali is an Indo-Aryan language not very distantly related to Hindi.4 Languages are dated from the first appearance of writing: thus the earliest Tibetan records are said to be inOld Tibetan, and the earliest Chinese records in Old Chinese.

Is there any way of telling how long ago it was that Tibetan and Chinese were, in some sense, the samelanguage? Archeological finds indicate that human beings first appeared in northern China around 10,000 BC, in alllikelihood having come eastward from the frozen tundras of Siberia, where they had survived and adapted throughthe most recent of the recurrent ice ages; by 5,000 BC neolithic culture had appeared on the fertile northern plainsof China, which then developed with remarkable continuity and coherence directly into historical times, with alanguage we have every reason to believe was already distinctively Chinese. These speakers of Chinese continuedto spread from the middle Yellow River area toward the southern and eastern coastsan extension even now inprogress.If the Chinese language split off from the common stock somewhere between 10,000 and 5,000 BC, then theChinese and Tibeto-Burman language groups may simply have been separated too long, and their descendantssimply have changed too much, to permit any convincing reconstruction of their common source; but areconstruction of Proto-Sino-Tibetan is so challenging a prospect that such efforts are not likely to stop.2.2. Tibetan And BurmeseThe Burmese language was first written down, on inscriptions, using an adaptation of the Mon orthography, around1112. This writing system was later replaced by a form of Sinhalese script, also derived from an Indic prototype,and by about 1500 the Burmese writing system had taken on more(footnote continued from previous page)contemporaneous with Middle Chinese, so that we speak, say, of seventh-century Middle Chinese wordsborrowed into Old Tibetan.

The writing, like that of Tibetan, is conservative, and presumably reflects the phonologicalstate of the language at about the time the orthography was fixed; that language in turn differs in some significantways from modern \"standard\" Burmese, spoken throughout the Irrawaddy plain and delta, in Upper and LowerBurma, by more than thirty million people.5The relationship of Tibetan and Burmeseand closely related languages such as those grouped together as Loloisonly slightly more apparent than the relationship of Tibetan and Chinese.

In this family, in addition to Tibetan and Burmese,there is in fact a vast complex of languages, stretching from the northern reaches of Assam and Burma westwardalong the Himalayas, eastward into southern China, and southward along the Salween and Irrawaddy Rivers to theBay of Bengal. These regions constitute one of the most linguistically diverse areas of the world; it is still verydifficult to get a clear picture of the relationships of the various languages and dialects, not only within the Tibeto-Burman family, but also in terms of the areal and borrowing relationships between the Tibeto-Burman languagesand the unrelated Thai and Mon-Khmer languages with which they have long been in contact.The cultural diversity of this area is equally striking. Speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages include goat herders inthe mountains of Nepal, former head hunters along the Indo-Burmese frontier, naked tribes in the jungle hills ofAssam, as well as the Tibetans and Burmese, who built successful Buddhist kingdoms and literate cultures whichhave survived to the present day.7 The(footnote continued from previous page)Some of these Tibetan and Burmese forms correspond even more closely if we look at the orthography ofthe oldest dated Burmese inscription-the inscription of Prince Rajkumar, dated 1112, often called theMyazedi Inscription because it was found on the mya zedi \"Emerald Pagoda.\" Here we find Burmese se\"die\" written <siy>, ri ''water\" written <riy>, and pe \"give\" written <piy>.

Such southward migrations, perhaps prompted by periodic dessication of the Inner Asianplains, presumably began from the same point from which another group had moved eastward into the fertile plainsof north China; and from secondary diffusion centers along the way there occurred further migrations westwardalong the great arc of the Himalayas, southward deeper into Burma, and eastward into northern Thailand and Laos,with the languages diverging, interacting, and borrowing from each other, and interacting as well with theunrelated Mon-Khmer and Thai languages whose speakers were both being displaced and migrating themselves.2.3. Tibetan and The Himalayan LanguagesScattered along the arc of the Himalayas, like beads on a string, are a number of more or less related languages,usually calledfor want of any more informative namethe Himalayan languages. The relations among theselanguages are not at all clear; for example, Newari, the historically important language of the old kings ofKathmandu, apparently cannot be grouped directly with any other of these Himalayan languages; and theremainder tend to be classified in primarily geographic groupings, with names like West Central Himalayish, on theassumption that human occupation of the Himalayan valleys proceeded linearly, from east to west, so that moreclosely related languages would tend to cluster geographically as well. I am not at all persuaded that this picture iscorrect; but I certainly have nothing better to offer.8 What does seem clear is that, among these Himalayanlanguages, someTamang, Gurung, Thakali, Magar, Kirantiseem quite closely related to Tibetan.8 Speakers of several of these Himalayan languages have traditionally been the source of recruits for theBritish Gurkha forces. Nepali, the dominant language of Nepal, came to be the lingua franca of the Gurkhaforces at brigade posts of the Indian Army throughout India and of the British Army in Hong Kong andMalaysia. Glover has noted that Gurung children returning to Nepal from military posts can converse withtheir village relatives only in Nepali while the latter converse among themselves in Gurung. Nepali is anIndo-Aryan language related to Hindi; and, although unrelated to the Himalayan languages, Nepaliloanwords have thoroughly infiltrated the Himalayan lexicons. < previous pagepage_14next page >"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"page_15file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_15.html[8/7/2010 9:52:06 PM]< previous pagepage_15next page >Page 15In 1927, Sten Konow, of the Linguistic Survey of India, distinguished between \"complex pronominalized\" and\"non-pronominalized\" Himalayan languages, with the pronominalized languages further subdivided into easternand western branches. The pronominalized languages fuse subject and object pronouns to the verb, where theyappear as prefixes and suffixes, yielding in effect a verbal inflection for both subject and object: for example, inLimbu, the language of the principal tribal people of eastern Nepal, we find the verb forms hiptun \"I hit him,\"hipne ''I hit you,\" khiptu \"You hit him,'' hiptu \"He hits him,\" khipti \"He hits you,\" ahiptum \"We hit him,\" khiptum\"You all hit him,\" and so on.9Konow believed that the pronominalized languages had borrowed this syntactic device from neighboring speakersof the entirely unrelated Munda languages. Such syntactic borrowing is not in itself impossible; in this case,however, it seems unlikely, for two reasons. First, the Munda verbal inflection system is very different in its basicstructure from that of the pronominalized Himalayan languages studied by Konow; one would expect a greatersimilarity in structureeven if not in contentif the syntactic device had in fact been borrowed. Second, theHimalayan verbal inflections are quite similar among themselves, even between geographically distant languages,to the point where it appears possible to reconstruct a Proto-Himalayan verb system.10 Such a proposedreconstruction would presumably place the development of the proto-inflectional system prior to any contact withMunda speakers. In any event, it seems both possible and plausible that the development was an internal one.Many of these Himalayan languages, such as Newari, do not at first glance seem closely related to Tibetan;othersespecially those in the Tamang-Gurung-Thakali groupappear strikingly similar not only in basic portions9 This distinction cuts across geographical lines. Eastern pronominalized languages include Limbu, Rai,Chepang, and other groups in eastern and central Nepal; western pronominalized languages such as Kanauriare spoken primarily in the mountain areas of northwestern India outside Kashmir. Non-pronominalizedlanguages include Gurung, Magar, Newari, and Lepcha or Rong, among others; these are distributed fromthe north of western central Nepal across to eastern Nepal and adjacent areas of India.10 Indeed, some scholars have gone so far as to suggest not that the pronominalized Himalayan languagesidiosyncratically acquired their inflections, but rather that the non-pronominalized languages lost the inflectionsthey once had. < previous pagepage_15next page >"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"page_16file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_16.html[8/7/2010 9:52:07 PM]< previous pagepage_16next page >Page 16of their vocabulary but in syntax as well.

The annals of the Han Dynasty note the existence of one group of *khyan, located far from China,called the *pywat-khyan, a term in which we may perhaps see a relationship with Old Tibetan bod \"Tibet.\"13Later, during the T'ang dynasty, the Chinese distinguished between the *tho-bhywan > t'u-fan \"agriculturalbarbarians,\" a term which came to be used regularly for the Tibetans, and the > hsi-fan \"westernbarbarians,'' a loosely defined group of nomadic tribes ranging the plains in what is now the Amdo region.14 TheTibetans drew the same distinction between themselves and these other nomads, even though the ways of life ofthe Tibetan and Hsi-fan nomads were basically the same; the Tibetans speak of the Horpa, the Minyag, theeighteen tribes of the Rgyarong as not speaking the Tibetan language, although these languages have clearlyborrowed a large number of words from central Tibetan.In fact, the influence of central Tibetan on these languages has been so great that they have frequently beenconsidered to be Tibetan themselves; note, however, Rgyarong snyis, Horpa zne, Minyag san \"seven\" instead ofOld Tibetan bdun \"seven\" and its New Tibetan reflexes, Rgyarong no, Horpa ni Minyag na \"you\" instead of OldTibetan khyod \"you\" and its New Tibetan reflexes, Rgyarong pram, Horpa phru-phru, Minyag phri ''white\" insteadof Old Tibetan dkar \"white\" and its reflexes. The relationship between these languages and Tibetan, however, isclearly a close one: for example, in the Rgyarong dialect of Lcog-rtse, we find Old Tibetan ma Rgyarong ma \"ear,\"Old Tibetan sin Rgyarong sying \"firewood,\" Old Tibetan mig Rgyarong mnyak \"eye,\" Old Tibetan dnul Rgyarongngiy \"silver,\" Old Tibetan gñis Rgyarong nis \"two.\" But we must, as always, be wary of possible loan words,especially, here, from written Tibetan texts. A correspondence as close as Old Tibetan ldzan-gu Rgyarong ldzan-ku\"green\" is sufficient to arouse suspicion; but13 I think it is pretty clear that bod \"Tibet,\" bon \"shamanic religion,\" BO \"call out, cry out,\" and perhapsPHO \"change place, migrate,\" SPO \"remove, shift, migrate,\" dbon/Nbon \"descendant, nephew, grandchild,\"NPHYO \"range, roam about,\" form what we will later in this text call a word family.14 The Old Tang History has a chapter on Tu-fan, and cites the recognizably Old Tibetan words btsan-po\"king,\" transcribed as Middle Chinese *tsan-phwo, and blon \"minister,\" transcribed as Middle Chinese *lywen,as native Tu-fan words. The New Tang History, in its parallel chapter on Tu-fan, gives a more extensivevocabulary list of Tibetan government officials, and similarly transcribes Old Tibetan btsan-po \"king\" asMiddle Chinese *tsan-phwo and Old Tibetan blon \"minister\" as Middle Chinese *lywen, using the sameChinese characters; but here the language is cited as being that of the *khyan. < previous pagepage_17next page >"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"page_18file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_18.html[8/7/2010 9:52:08 PM]< previous pagepage_18next page >Page 18when we find Old Tibetan stag Rgyarong khun \"tiger\" but stak \"tiger\" in the Lcog-rtse dialect, or Old Tibetandbyar-ka Rgyarong tsar \"summer\" but dbyarke in the Chos-kia dialect, it is reasonable to believe we have foundan informant with a literary education.3. Variation in TibetanIf Tibetans from different parts of Tibet are asked to give their word for \"hair,\" a Tibetan from Purik will say skra,one from Amdo will say skya, one from Kham will say stra, one from Tao-fu will say stra, and one from Bhutanor Sikkim will say kya. Similarly, a Ladakhi will say sa, a rural Central Tibetan will say ta, and an upper-classresident of Lhasa City will say tsa. But if these Tibetans are literate, and are asked to write the word they had justspoken, they will all produce the same written form, which we here transcribe as <skra>. And, if they are shownthe written form <skra >, they will, again, pronounce the word differently, but they will all recognize the form andagree thathowever it is pronouncedit means \"hair.\"One reason for this is the remarkable conservatism of the Tibetan writing system. The written form <skra>, forexample, with the same meaning \"hair,\" can be found in manuscripts more than a thousand years old, preserved inthe deserts of Central Asia, which can still be readin some sense of that termby any literate Tibetan.15 The writtenform has remained unchanged; the word represented by that form has come to beor has continued to bedifferent indifferent dialects. The advantage of such uniform orthography is its transcendence of regionalism: all literateTibetans share a single written language, however different their spoken dialects may be. The disadvantage is thedivorce between the written and spoken languages, making literacy an increasingly difficult and eliteaccomplishment.Now when Tibetan was first reduced to writing, it seems reasonable to assume that the written form <skra>was, infact, an attempt to render a word pronounced something very much like skra. We thus find variation in15 For example, in a mythic text from the caves near Tun-huang we find dbu-skra bdun ... Nbrog-srin dre-das Ntsald \"The fiend of the wastes, Dre-da, demands seven hairs from his head.\" Again, in a prosaicadministrative memorandum from a Tibetan oasis garrison in Central Asia, reporting on the collection ofanimal hair for rope-making, we read bzer-gis phyugs Nga skra sran phyed gyis \"Bzer has made a half sranof hair of some animals.\" < previous pagepage_18next page >"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"page_19file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_19.html[8/7/2010 9:52:09 PM]< previous pagepage_19next page >Page 19the Tibetan language along two dimensions. The language varies along a DIACHRONIC dimension, wherein aword pronounced skra in the ninth century has come to be pronounced, say, ta in the twentieth; and the languagevaries along a SYNCHRONIC dimension, wherein a word now pronounced sa in Ladakh is pronounced stra inKham, or pronounced ta by a Lhasa City storekeeper is pronounced tsa by a Lhasa City aristocrat.16When we speak of the history of the Tibetan language, we will use the term PROTO-TIBETAN to refer to theTibetan language spoken before the existence of any written records. We will use the term OLD TIBETAN for thelanguage spoken during the earliest period for which written records existthat is, more or less arbitrarily, for thelanguage spoken, say, from the seventh to the tenth centuries, which is the language upon which those earliestwritten texts were based. The term MIDDLE TIBETAN will refer to the language spoken from the tenth to thenineteenth centuries, a period for which we have an awesome quantity of written materials, but about whosespoken language we can make only scattered inferences. Finally, the term NEW TIBETAN will refer to the spokenlanguage for which we have modern contemporaneous transcriptions and analyses, beginning in the nineteenthcentury with the first European explorers and missionaries.l7 When we speak of synchronic variation, we willadopt the convention of citing forms by historical period followed by a parenthetical indication of dialect wheresuch information is availablefor example, Old Tibetan bdun but New Tibetan (Dbus) düN \"seven,\" Old Tibetan myibut Old Tibetan (Sumpa) mu \"man.\"3.1. Variation in New TibetanWhen a Tibetan from Ladakh and a Tibetan from Lhasa City go to the16 Diachronic variation, of course, occurred as well before the earliest written texts. Where we find Kanaurikra and Kachin , for example, we can hypothesize an earlier Proto-Tibetan *kra \"hair,\" to which wasprefixed the formative *sa \"ANIMAL\"-thus ProtoTibetan *sa-kra \"ANIMAL hair\" > *s-kra >Old Tibetanskra \"hair.'' And synchronic variation occurred at historical periods other than the modern. There is sometextual evidence, for example, that, alongside Old Tibetan (Lhasa) myi \"man,'' there was an Old Tibetan(Sumpa) mu \"man\" as well.17 Note that these terms are really methodological rather than properly linguistic. The classification dependsupon the fortuitous existence of written records on the one hand and modern transcriptions on the other.Middle Tibetan simply includes everything in between. < previous pagepage_19next page >"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"page_20file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_20.html[8/7/2010 9:52:10 PM]< previous pagepage_20next page >Page 20market together to buy vegetables, the Ladakhi is shopping for tshodma but the Lhasan for If they buy spinach,the Ladakhi calls it palak and the Lhasan calls it If they buy peas, the Ladakhi calls them sanma and theLhasan calls them .

They will both say they are speaking Tibetan; but the Ladakhi will call thelanguage potskat and the Lhasan will call it Even if we look just at the lexicon, leaving grammar aside, the relationship between the two dialects is complex.For example, continuing with vegetables, we find Ladakhi labuk and Lhasa \"radish\" < Old Tibetan la-phug,where the word is recognizably the same in both dialects;18 and, similarly, we find Ladakhi tson and Lhasa tsoN\"onion,\" although in this case the word gives every appearance of having come into Middle Tibetan from MiddleChinese *tshun \"onion,'' rather than of being a native Tibetan word. On the other hand, we find Ladakhi sanma andLhasa \"peas'' < Old Tibetan sran-ma, where a common origin of the word in Old Tibetan is less obvious, butthe differences in pronunciation are the result of more or less regular phonological changes in each dialect.19Ladakhi gobi and Lhasa kopi \"cauliflower\" appear alike not because the words have a common Old Tibetan origin,but because the two dialects have recently-and apparently independently-borrowed the Hindi word phul gobhi\"cauliflower.\" The Lhasa dialect uses the compound koNlapu <gun la-phug>\"middle finger radish Þ carrot,\" whileLadakhi uses the term sarakturman \"carrot,\" almost certainly borrowed in part from Urdu zardak \"carrot.\"2018 The radish-although certainly not a literary staple-does crop up in some genuinely ancient texts.

Itis not clear to me that this view is at all widespread outside of Lhasa City; the view is, however, found amongthose foreign linguists whose informants are from Lhasa, and among those foreigners whose work orsympathies lie with the Lhasa political or religious elite. < previous pagepage_21next page >"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"page_22file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_22.html[8/7/2010 9:52:11 PM]< previous pagepage_22next page >Page 22and the lines themselves may not be sharply drawn: along the isogloss, pho may fade into pot through anintermediate phöt, or some people may use both forms but in different styles of speech, or people in one socialclass may use one form and those in another social class use the other. Thus, when such lines are drawn, they oftenshow considerable criss-crossing; when a number of isoglosses do more or less coincide, they are said to mark aDIALECT BOUNDARY.Clearly we are far from even approaching such a dialect map of Tibet. But there are a few dialect features withwhich we can make a beginning, and which provide examples of the sorts of questions that still remain to beasked. The following sections will briefly discuss three phonological features of this sort in New Tibetanthepalatalization of labials, postinitials and the fronting of back vowels in the southern dialects, and elegantbreathiness in Lhasa City.223.1.1. The palatalization of labialsIn central Tibet, Old Tibetan palatalized labials such as by- and phy- have generally become palatal affricatesforexample, Old Tibetan phyogs \"side\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) tsho (Lhasa) , Old Tibetan bya \"bird\" > NewTibetan (Dbus) tsa (Lhasa) tsha, Old Tibetan byan \"north\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) tsan (Lhasa) tshaN, Old Tibetanbyi-ba \"rat\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) tsiwa (Lhasa) . These same changes are found eastward as far as ChamdoCity, located at the upper reaches of what becomes, further south, the Mekong River; but, as we move even furthereast, across the Yangtze River to the city of Derge, we find that these same Old Tibetan palatalized22 These topics were chosen because of the light they throw-even if indirectly-on the question of variationin Old Tibetan, which we will discuss in the next section. Thus we have not discussed the development ofapparently phonemic tones in Lhasa City-both tone REGISTERS, with different tone heights developingfrom voiced and voiceless onsets in Old Tibetan, and tone CONTOURS, with different tonal shapesdeveloping from syllable-final vowels, glides, and stops in Old Tibetan. Phonemic tone, of course, is foundin many languages, especially in Southeast Asia, where tone has apparently spread among languages whichare not genetically related, but only in geographical proximity. Moreover, tonal systems have apparentlyappeared and disappeared, and then appeared again, in particular language families. There is no reason tobelieve that Old Tibetan had tones; if Proto-Tibetan ever had phonemic tones, the system had disappearedlong before historical times. < previous pagepage_22next page >"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"page_23file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_23.html[8/7/2010 9:52:12 PM]< previous pagepage_23next page >Page 23labials have become palatal fricativesthus New Tibetan (Derge) so \"side,\" sa \"bird,\" siwa \"rat.\" We find these samepalatal fricatives extending far to the northeast, in the Amdo country, where we find New Tibetan (Amdo) sog\"side,\" sa \"bird,'' san ''north,\" sü \"rat.\" But if we had gone north from Derge, instead of northeast, and had enteredthe Golok country, we would have found that the Old Tibetan palatalized labials had become not palatal fricativesbut rather labiopalatal fricativesthus New Tibetan (Golok) fsya \"bird,\" fsan \"north,\" fsyo \"rat.\" And if we hadinstead gone southeast from Derge to the city of Tao-futhe Tibetan Tau or Ltaowe would have found that the OldTibetan palatalized labials had become labiopalatal affricates before rounded vowels, but labial stops in front ofspread vowelsthus New Tibetan (Tao-fu) pso \"side,\" pha \"bird,\" piwa \"rat.\" From the materials we have, thesedialect differences appear fairly consistent thus, for example, Old Tibetan phyi-ba \"marmot\" > New Tibetan (Dbus)tshiwa (Derge) sewa (Amdo) see (Golok) fsyo (Tao-fu) phipa. We can, apparently, draw fairly neat isoglosses forthese features, separating Derge and Amdo from Tao-fu, from Golok, and from Chamdo and the central dialects.But it is not clear whether this neatness really exists in the material, or is simply an artefact of its paucity. Let uslook at the same change elsewhere.In western Tibet, we find the same change as in central Tibetpalatalized labials becoming palatal affricatesin thedialect of Ladakh, but not in the otherwise closely related dialects of Balti or Purik-thus, for example, Old Tibetanbya \"bird\" > New Tibetan (Balti) bya (Purik) bia, but (Ladakh) tsa (Dbus) tsa (Lhasa) tsha, Old Tibetan phyogs\"side\" > New Tibetan (Balti) phyox, but (Ladakh) tshoks (Dbus) tsho (Lhasa) . We would therefore want todraw an isogloss grouping the western dialect of Ladakh with the central Tibetan dialects with regard to this onefeature.But the picture is even more complicated. In Ladakhas opposed to the central dialectsOld Tibetan palatalizedlabials have failed to become palatal affricates before front vowelsthus Old Tibetanphye \"flour\" > New Tibetan(Balti) phe (Purik) phe (Ladakh) phe, but (Dbus) tshe (Lhasa) tshe, Old Tibetan phyed \"half\" > New Tibetan (Balti)phed (Purik) phet (Ladakh) phyet, but (Dbus) tshe (Lhasa) tshe. Note also that Old Tibetan phyi-mo \"grandmother\"> New Tibetan (Balti) -pi (Purik) -pi and Old Tibetan phyi \"outside\" > (Ladakh) phi but (Dbus) tshi (Lhasa) tshiSo our isogloss would group Ladakh with the central dialects with regard to the development of palatalized labialsonly in syllables with back vowels; in syllables with front < previous pagepage_23next page >"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"page_24file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_24.html[8/7/2010 9:52:12 PM]< previous pagepage_24next page >Page 24vowels, Ladakhi would remain with the other western dialects of Balti and Purik.Finally, in Ladakh we find particular wordssuch as tsindak <sbyin-bdag>\"patron\" and tshinan <phyi-bsnan>\"breakfast\"that appear to be exceptions to this latter rule, and in which palatalized labials have becomepalatal affricates before front vowels. Why is this? There are several possibilties, and no conclusions: it may bethat the change from palatalized labial to palatal affricate is continuing to spread into syllables with front vowels,and that these few words are the first such lexical items to undergo this change, with more to come in the future; itmayperhaps more plausiblybe that these few lexical items are in fact loan words into Ladakhi from a prestigecentral Tibetan dialect.3.1.2. Some southern isoglossesThe southern dialects of Sikkim and Bhutan show a change of Old Tibetan postinitial -r- to postinitial -y- aftergravethat is, velar and labial-initials; the neighboring Sherpa dialect shows instead the same retroflex stops shownby the dialects of Central Tibet to the north. Thus we find Old Tibetan skra \"hair\" > New Tibetan (Gromo) kya(Bhutan) kya (Sikkim) kya, but (Sherpa) ta (Dbus) ta (Lhasa) ta, Old Tibetan khrag \"blood\" > New Tibetan(Gromo) khyag (Bhutan) thyak (Sikkim) khyag, but (Sherpa) thak (Dbus) thak (Lhasa) tha, Old Tibetan sbrul''snake\" > New Tibetan (Gromo) biu (Bhutan) beu (Sikkim) biu, but (Sherpa) drul (Dbus) dü (Lhasa) tü.Presumably an isogloss for this feature could be drawn around the southern dialects, with Sherpa and the northerndialects on one side and the southern dialects on the other. Where, in the southern dialects, this change has notoccurred as when Old Tibetan Nbron \"wild yak'' is represented by New Tibetan (Gromo) don (Sikkimese) don(Dbus) don (Lhasa) tONit is reasonable to suspect that the word has in fact been borrowed by the southern dialectsfrom one or more of the central dialects. This is especially so where the word denotes an item in the central, butnot the southern, cultural repertoire.2323 Of course, this distinction is not always clear. In Chamdo City, for example, we find Old Tibetan Nbras\"rice\" > New Tibetan (Chamdo) mbri but Old Tibetan sbrul \"snake\" > New Tibetan (Chamdo) drü. I haveno doubt that the Chamdo City word drü \"snake\" was borrowed from a central Tibetan dialectcompare, forexample, New Tibetan (Dbus) dü (Lhasa) tü \"snake.\" But why in the world would Chamdo City borrow theword \"snake\"? < previous pagepage_24next page >"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"page_25file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_25.html[8/7/2010 9:52:13 PM]< previous pagepage_25next page >Page 25But, again, things are really more complicated. In the central Tibetan dialects, dental syllable finals have largelydisappeared. When such dental syllable finals existed, they caused preceding back vowels to move to the front ofthe mouth, presumably in anticipation of the following dental consonant. Any such front rounded vowels werewithout linguistic significance in Old Tibetan; but such vowels acquired significance in the central dialects as thedental finals that had caused them began to be lost. Thus, in these dialects, before what had been Old Tibetandental finals, the back rounded vowels o and u have become, respectively, the front rounded vowels ö and üthus,for example, Old Tibetan nos \"side\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) nö (Lhasa) nö, Old Tibetan lus \"body\" > New Tibetan(Dbus) lü (Lhasa) lü. Similarly, the back spread vowel a has become either the front spread vowel e, or a new,somewhat lower, front spread vowel , depending on the dialectthus, for example, Old Tibetan las ''work\" > NewTibetan (Dbus) le (Lhasa) Sherpa is different. In common with other southern dialects, Sherpa has not developed front rounded vowels beforedental finals, but has retained the Old Tibetan back rounded vowelsthus, for example, Old Tibetan YOD \"exist\" >New Tibetan (Bhutan) yot (Sherpa) yot, but (Dbus) yö (Lhasa) yö, Old Tibetan dnul \"silver\" > New Tibetan(Sikkim) nul (Sherpa) nul, but (Dbus) nü (Lhasa) nü, Old Tibetan khyod \"you\" > New Tibetan (Bhutan) khyot(Sherpa) khyod, but (Dbus) tshö (Lhasa) chö, Old Tibetan yul ''country\" > New Tibetan (Sikkim) yul (Sherpa) yul,but (Dbus) yii (Lhasa) yü, Old Tibetan bdun \"seven\" > New Tibetan (Bhutan) dun (Sherpa) dun, but (Dbus) dün(Lhasa) tüN. An isogloss for front rounded vowels would thus run along a different route than would the isoglossfor -r- > -y- after grave initials: the first isogloss would run north and west of the Sherpa settlements in Nepal,linking Sherpa with dialects to the east and west; the second isogloss would run east of the Sherpa country, linkingSherpa with dialects to the north.But, again, there is more. In the southern dialects, as in the central dialects, the back spread vowel a does becomefronted before dental finals, as opposed, say, to the western dialects, where such fronting does not occurforexample, Old Tibetan brgyad \"eight\" > New Tibetan (Bhutan) gyet (Sikkim) gye (Sherpa) gye (Dbus) dze (Lhasa) , but (Ladakh) rgyat (Balti) bgyad (Purik) rgyat, Old Tibetan skad \"speech\" > New Tibetan (Sikkim) ke (Sherpa)ked (Dbus) ke (Lhasa) , but (Ladakh) skat (Balti) skat (Purik) skat. Thus the isogloss for the fronting of a beforedental finals would follow < previous pagepage_25next page >"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"page_26file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_26.html[8/7/2010 9:52:13 PM]< previous pagepage_26next page >Page 26yet another route, linking together both the central and southern dialects, and separating them from the dialects tothe west.And we are not done yet. Bhutan appears generally to follow the southern pattern, with no front rounded vowelsbefore dental syllable finalsthus New Tibetan (Sherpa) drul (Bhutan) beu \"snake,\" (Sherpa) yot (Bhutan) yot\"exist\"; but note the exceptionsNew Tibetan (Sherpa) nul (Sikkim) nul but (Bhutan) nü ''silver,\" (Sherpa) yul(Sikkim) yul but (Bhutan) yü \"country.'' Once again we are left to wonder whether these exceptions are the firstsigns of a change beginning to spread through this portion of the lexicon, or loan words from a prestige centralTibetan dialect.3.1.3. Elegant breathinessRight around Lhasa City there should be an isogloss separating New Tibetan (Lhasa) ka from (Dbus) ga<dga>\"joy,\" (Lhasa) ta from (Dbus) da <mda >\"arrow,\" (Lhasa) pu from (Dbus) bu <Nbu>\"worm\"; presumablythis isogloss would pretty much coincide with the one separating New Tibetan (Lhasa) khur from (Dbus) kur<gur>\"tent,\" (Lhasa) thep from (Dbus) tep <deb>\"book,\" (Lhasa)phö from (Dbus) pö <bod>\"Tibet.\" In otherwords, in Dbus, the New Tibetan reflexes of Old Tibetan voiced initialsbut only those originally withoutpreinitialshave had their voice onset time delayed until they have fallen together with the New Tibetan voicelessinitials. Such DEVOICING is, in fact, found in several New Tibetan dialects, although more sporadically than incentral Tibet: compare, for example, Old Tibetan gur \"tent\" > New Tibetan (Golok) kur (Amdo) kïr (Ladakh) kur(Dbus) kur, but Old Tibetan mgo \"head\" > New Tibetan (Golok) go (Amdo) go (Ladakh) go (Dbus) go.2424 This devoicing apparently began with the voiced fricatives and gradually spread to other parts of thelexicon. The historian Ngos lo-tsa-ba Gzon-nu-dpal, in his Deb-ther snonpo, quotes a letter from aNepalese scholar addressing Bu-ston (1290-1364) as sa-lu pandita, rather than the correct za-lu pandita,presumably writing the term as he had heard it pronounced. Gzon-nu-dpal himself, writing in 1478, notedthat in his day za ni a-dan mthun-pa... za ni sa-dan mthun-pa \"the graph <z>is pronounced the same as <>. . . and the graph <z>is pronounced the same as <s>.\" The Si-tu mahapandita, in his monumentalgrammatical commentary Mkhas-pai mgul-rgyan mu-tig phren-mdzes, probably to be dated in 1744, simplylisted z and z as sgra-med \"voiceless\" sounds along with and s.(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_26next page >"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"page_27file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_27.html[8/7/2010 9:52:14 PM]< previous pagepage_27next page >Page 27In Lhasa City, however, the process has gone much farther than in other dialects: the New Tibetan reflexes of OldTibetan voiced initials with preinitials have fallen together with the New Tibetan voiceless initials, and thosewithout preinitials have had their voice onset time delayed even more, until they have fallen together with the NewTibetan aspirated initialsthus Old Tibetan mgo \"head\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) go but (Lhasa) ko, Old Tibetan mda\"arrow\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) da but (Lhasa) ta, Old Tibetan gur \"tent\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) kur but (Lhasa)khur, Old Tibetan da ''now\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) ta but (Lhasa) tha.This \"breathiness\" is apparently perceived as characteristic of the prestige Lhasa City dialect. It is thus notsurprising that, within that dialect, speakers seek to achieve elegance by being even breathier.25 For such speakers,the New Tibetan reflexes of all originally voiced initials have fallen together with originally aspirated initialsthusOld Tibetan mgo \"head\" > New Tibetan (Dbus) go (Lhasa) ko (Lhasa elegant) kho, Old Tibetan rdo \"stone\" > NewTibetan (Dbus) do (Lhasa) to (Lhasa elegant) tho, Old Tibetan mdzin \"neck'' > New Tibetan (Dbus) dzin (Lhasa)tsin (Lhasa elegant) tshin. We must thus draw an additional isogloss, to separate New Tibetan (Lhasa) ko from(Lhasa elegant) kho \"head\" and (Lhasa) to from (Lhasa elegant) tho \"stone\"but this isogloss must be drawn throughsocial rather than through geographical space.This social isogloss will probably coincide with several others, thus forming a socialrather than a spatialdialectboundary. One such additional social isogloss will separate speakers who articulate unreleased nondental finalsfrom those who do not, with those who do not articulate these finals being the more elegantthus Old Tibetan myig\"eye\" > New Tibetan (Golok)(footnote continued from previous page)Note that the process of devoicing affects only those initials that were originally voiced in Old Tibetan, andhas had no effect on Old Tibetan unvoiced initialsthus, for example, Old Tibetan ka-ba \"pillar\" > NewTibetan (Amdo) kaa/kaba (Dbus) kawa (Lhasa) kaa, Old Tibetan dkar-po \"white\" > New Tibetan (Golok)karwo (Amdo) karo (Ladakh) karpo (Dbus) karpo (Lhasa) kapo.25 It is probably worth noting that a great deal of American scholarship on the Lhasa dialect is based on thespeech of a single informant, Nawang Nornang, supplemented by the speech of other Lhasa aristocrats. Mr.Nornang is extremely charming, literate, and articulate, and therefore a pleasure to work with; but he is also thespeaker of an unusually elegant type of Lhasa City dialect. An entire generation of American students hastherefore learned to speak the Tibetan equivalent of Boston brahmin English. < previous pagepage_27next page >"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"page_28file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_28.html[8/7/2010 9:52:15 PM]< previous pagepage_28next page >Page 28yñïk (Amdo) yñïy-xñïk (Balti) mik (Ladakh) mik (Dbus) mik-mi?(Lhasa) mik-mi?but (Lhasa elegant) mi, OldTibetan nub \"west\" > New Tibetan (Golok) nup (Balti) nup (Ladakh) nup (Dbus) nup (Lhasa) nup but (Lhasaelegant) nu, Old Tibetan gur \"tent\" > New Tibetan (Golok) kur (Amdo) kïr (Ladakh) kur (Dbus) kur (Lhasa) khurbut (Lhasa elegant) khu. Another social isogloss will separate speakers for whom Old Tibetan stop initials withI don't want to talk grammar, I want to talk like a lady.George Bernard Shaw, Pygmalionr postinitials are retroflex stops from those for whom they are retroflex affricates, with the latter again being themore elegantthus Old Tibetan skra \"hair\" > (Kham) stra (Tao-fu) stra (Purik) skra (Ladakh) sa (Dbus) ta (Lhasa)ta but (Lhasa elegant) tsa, Old Tibetan gri \"knife\" > New Tibetan (Tao-fu) gri (Khams) di (Dbus) ti (Lhasa) thi but(Lhasa elegant) tshi Old Tibetan sprin ''cloud\" > New Tibetan (Derge) trim (Purik) sprin (Ladakh) sin (Dbus) tin(Lhasa) tiN but (Lhasa elegant) tsiN, Old Tibetan Nbras \"rice\" > New Tibetan (Balti) bras (Ladakh) das (Dbus) de(Lhasa) but (Lhasa elegant) In sum, if this analysis is correct, the social dialect boundary in Lhasa Cityseparates speakers of a breathier, more fricative, less stopped manner of speech from speakers of a voicier, lessfricative, more stopped manner of speech. This is, in fact, a discernible difference among speakers of the Lhasadialect, and depends on social class or the efforts of the speaker to sound elegant and aristocratic.3.2. Variation in Old TibetanI can say without hesitation that similar sorts of variation existed in Old Tibetan as well. The problem is thatasidefrom a conviction that such variation existed in Old Tibetan, as it exists in every languagewe simply do not knowmuch about it.The period of Old Tibetan we may take to be more or less coextensive with < previous pagepage_28next page >"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"page_29file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_29.html[8/7/2010 9:52:15 PM]< previous pagepage_29next page >Page 29the age of the central Tibetan Yar-lun dynasty, from the seventh to the ninth centuriesthe era of Tibet's greatestmilitary expansion and the time when the foundations of Tibetan culture were laid, including the language we arehere calling classical Tibetan. This was the time when terrifying Tibetan hordes, with their faces painted red,conquered and occupied the strategic oases of Central Asia, and on one occasion even captured and briefly heldCh'ang-an, the capital of China. For these two centuries, Tibet was the dominant power in Inner Asia.By the middle of the eighth century at the latest, the barbarian warriors of Tibet had developed a uniform writingsystem, based on an Indian model, which they used on huge monolithic pillars to record their victories and incorrespondence among the military outposts of their empire. By the reign of Khri Sron-lde-btsan (742-797), whofounded the monastery of Bsam-yas and invited the Indian academicians Santaraksita and Kamalasila to Tibet, thiswriting system had begun to be applied to the production of Buddhist texts. By the beginning of the ninth centuryit seems a need was felt to standardize the language of these translations, whether from religious or imperialimpulse it is difficult to say; in any event, the language standardization project was begun under Khri Lde-sroni-btsan (776-815) and completed under his son Khri Gtsug-lde-btsan (805-836). The result was a dictionary, theBye-brag-tu rtogs-par byed-pa, perhaps better known under its Sanskritized title Mahavyut-patti, and acommentary, the Sgra-sbyor bam-po gñis-pa, with the Sanskrit title Madhyavyutpatti, which served as a treatise ontranslation theory and practice. Translations that had already been completed were revised by the central translationcommittee, and, as the historian Bu-ston says, skad-gsar btsad-kyis gtan-la phab \"The new language wasestablished by decree.\" The result was a series of canonical translation equivalents for Buddhist texts, in officiallysanctioned spellings.3.2.1. SourcesThere are three primary sources of written evidence for dialect variation in Old Tibetan during this period. Onesource is the collection of manuscripts recovered from the famous walled-up library in one of the shrinesconstituting the settlement at Ch'ien-fo-tung, near Tun-huang, in western Kan-su, the caravanserai which marksthe end of China and the beginning of the desert. The sealed cave yielded an immense hoard of Tibetanmanuscripts from the eighth and ninth centuries, including historical records, translations, myths, < previous pagepage_29next page >"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"page_30file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_30.html[8/7/2010 9:52:16 PM]< previous pagepage_30next page >Page 30rituals, divination manuals, and collections of proverbs. The spelling of words in these texts is the most directavailable evidence of dialect variation among the scribes who wrote them down.26Another source consists of documents, written primarily on thin strips of wood held together with string, or oncoarse, unglazed paper, left behind by the Tibetan garrisons at the oasis cities of Chinese Turkestan, primarily fortsat Miran and at Mazar-Tagh in Khotan. These oases had long had their own vibrant culturetheir garden wallsadorned with frescoes and stucco reliefswhen they were occupied and garrisoned by Tibetan troops, who leftbehind in their storerooms the identity cards of soldiers, address labels for military and administrativecorrespondence, military reports, administrative memoranda, and letters to superiors from harried commanders inneed of supplies. Like the Tun-huang texts, these more prosaic documents give us spellings and vocabulary thatmay reflect dialect variations among their authors.A third source is found in the several inscriptions on monumental pillars erected in and near Lhasa City. Theseinscriptions include the earliest extant dated Tibetan writing, the pillar at zol, erected by Nan-lam stag-sgra klu-gonin 767 to memorialize his services to the king and his victories over the Chinese. For the purposes of phonologicalreconstructionthat is, when we try to figure out what Tibetan actually sounded like in Lhasa Citythe most importantof these pillar inscriptions is that of the Sino-Tibetan treaty of 821, which contains in bilingual versions the namesof both the Chinese and Tibetan officials who participated in the conclusion of the treaty, with Tibetantransliterations of Chinese names and Chinese transliterations of Tibetan names. Again, since there are independentreconstructions of Middle Chinese phonology, the Chinese transcriptions of Tibetan names can tell uswithin thelimits of the ability of written Chinese to transliterate anythingwhat the Tibetan of Lhasa City actually sounded liketo the Chinese scribes. We find26 A few of these manuscripts, too, turned out to be Chinese Buddhist texts transliterated into Tibetan,presumably so that they could be recited by Tibetan travelers illiterate in Chinese but perhaps with someknowledge of the spoken language. Since we have independent access to the Chinese texts thustransliterated, and independent reconstructions of their Middle Chinese phonology, such texts can providesignificant clues to the phonological values of the Tibetan graphs used to transcribe them. We will turn tothese texts for help when we discuss the Tibetan writing system. < previous pagepage_30next page >"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"page_31file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_31.html[8/7/2010 9:52:16 PM]< previous pagepage_31next page >Page 31similar Chinese transliterations of several Tibetan government titles and royal names in the Chinese historicalrecords dealing with Inner Asian political affairs.3.2.2. Manuscript variationsEven with these sources, it is difficult to form any consistent geographical picture of Old Tibetan dialect variation.We can, of course, detect fragments of dialects. One text from the Tun-huang library, for example, consists ofproverbs attributed to ma sum-pa \"Mother Sum-pa/the Sum-pa mother.\" In this text we find <mu>writtenconsistently for Old Tibetan myi \"man,\" and apparently intended to represent the form mu \"man\" in the dialect ofthe author. That this dialect was that of a Sum-pa people is indicated not only by the title of the text but also by thefact that the Sum-pa were apparently a distinctive Tibetan group.27 We are probably justified in believing that wehave here found a genuine Old Tibetan dialect variantOld Tibetan (Sumpa) mu \"man,\" as opposed, say, to the OldTibetan (Lhasa) myi > mi ''man'' attested on the contemporaneous monumental pillars erected around Lhasa City.Similarly, another Tun-huang manuscript, this time dealing with divination, presents what seem to be consistentdialect features, writing <sla>for Old Tibetan zla \"moon\" and <slogs>for Old Tibetan zlogs \"reversed,\" and<tham-sad>for Old Tibetan thams-tsad \"all\" and <sem-san>for Old Tibetan sems-tsan \"sentient creature.\" Again,these spellings would seem to reflect genuine Old Tibetan dialect variants; unfortunately, we do not know wherethey are from. But the variants are sufficiently systematic that the27 The Sum-pa play a role in both the Old Tibetan Chronicles and the Old Tibetan Annals: they wereconquered by Myan Mafn-po-rdze zan-snan, the minister of Sron-btsan sgam-po; there were Sum-pa inRgya-ron and Mdo-smad. The New Tang History reports that Stag-sgra, a prince of the Sum-pa, defectedfrom Tibet and surrendered to the Chinese. The term sum-pa also appears as a geographical designation inproper namesfor example, the otherwise unknown Sum-pa Gsas-slebs, mentioned in a ninth-centuryfragment of administrative correspondence from the Tibetan fort at Miran. Later the term sum-pa came torefer to the Monguor, who came to the Kokonor region later on; the author Sum-pa Yeses dpal-Nbyor wasprobably among the latter. At least one word-list of New Tibetan, first published by the South ManchurianRailway in 1943, reports the form mu \"man\" from the area of Labrang in Amdo, although this is probablyan attempt to render the form mï < previous pagepage_31next page >"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"page_32file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_32.html[8/7/2010 9:52:16 PM]< previous pagepage_32next page >Page 32manuscript seems to represent a particular dialect, in which the zl of, say, Lhasa City is represented by sl, and -s-tsis represented by s. Using the manuscript designation as the provenance of the linguistic forms, therefore, we areprobably justified in proposing Old Tibetan (Stein ms. 73 IV 3a) sla \"moon,\" as opposed to Old Tibetan (Lhasa) zla\"moon,\" and Old Tibetan (Stein ms. 73 IV 3a) tham-sad ''all,\" as opposed to Old Tibetan (Lhasa) thams-tsad \"all,\"with the Lhasa forms as attested on the Sino-Tibetan treaty pillar of 821.Again, we find a Tun-huang mythological manuscript apparently pertaining to a legendary time of woe in the Skyicountry, although the provenance of the manuscript itself is uncertain. The manuscript seems to reflect, at least insome portions, a dialect which did not haveor was in the process of losingthe distinction between palatal and dentalaffricates found elsewhere in Old Tibetan. Thus we find, in this manuscript, both <khri-tsog>and <khri-tsog>,both <glin-bran tseu>and <glin-bran tseu>, and both <be-ne tshog-po>and <be-ne tshog-po>, written apparentlyindiscriminately. What is interesting and puzzling, however, is that these are all proper names, and proper namesthat are, as far as I know, peculiar to this text. We do not find such variation in other parts of the lexicon: OldTibetan mtshog \"best\" is written consistently as <mtshog>, and Old Tibetan tshab \"water\" is written consistently as<tshab>. One hypothesis is that the manuscript in fact represents a dialect in which there is no distinctionor nolonger a distinctionbetween dental and palatal affricates; where the scribe writes a word in common use, he writesit according to the spelling rule he has learned; where the scribe has no rule to follow, as when he is writing aproper name he has never seen spelled elsewhere, he improvises its spelling inconsistently, since the differentgraphs for palatal and dental affricates do not reflect a distinction in his own speech. We do not know, of course,whether in this dialect the palatal affricates have fallen together with the dental, or the dental with the palatal; butsuch a dialect would clearly be different from that recorded, say, on the pillar inscriptions at Lhasa City.2828 The Central Asian manuscripts-both from Tunhuang and Khotanshow considerable variation in theirspelling of those grammatical particles which undergo morphophonological changes according to the finalor postfinal of the preceding syllable. Some manuscripts tend to generalize a single form of such aparticlefor example, the voiced palatalized form, writing -gyi even where the morphophonological ruleswould seem to call for -kyi or -gi. Other manuscripts may avoid palatalized forms altogether, using -gi andthe otherwise unattested postconsonantal forms -i and -ki, as in <nam-i>and <yab-ki>, where the(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_32next page >"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"page_33file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_33.html[8/7/2010 9:52:17 PM]< previous pagepage_33next page >Page 333.2.3. Reconstructed variationsSometimes we can reconstruct earlier variation where New Tibetan dialect variants do not reflect a single OldTibetan source. The word for \"knee,\" for example, is pus-mo in the classical texts, with the high back vowel u anda final -s. But it is clear that this form is only one of several earlier Tibetan words with the same meaning. Someof these variants apparently go back to earlier forms with the same vowel but a velar final cluster: in western Tibetwe find New Tibetan (Balti) buxmo (Purik) puksmo, which indicate an earlier form *pugs-mo. But we also findforms with the same finals or clusters but a high front vowel i instead of a high back vowel u. We find (Ladakh)pismo, indicating an earlier form *pis-mo, and (Lahuli) pigmo, of uncertain ancestry, but possibly from *pig-mo or*pigs-mo. At the other end of Tibet, in the far northeast, we find (Amdo) wïxmo ~ ïxmo, which could have comefrom any of the four earlier forms *pig-~ pigs-~ pug-~ pugs-mo, and (Golok) wigo, which seems to indicate anearlier *pig-mo. And in central Tibet we find (Dbus) pimo, which looks like it came from *pis-mo, and (Lhasa)pümu, which is so clearly related to an earlier form *pus-mo that one suspects that it is in fact a readingpronunciation of the written form <pus-mo>. And we also find in Lhasa City a form pemo, whose vowel einsteadof and long high level tone on the first syllable suggest an earlier form *pel-mo. There is, thus, no one earlierform that can account for all these New Tibetan variants, and we must reconstruct at least four-or possiblyfiveprecursor forms-*pismo, *pig-~ pigs-mo, *pus-mo, *pug-~ pugs-mo, and, perhaps, *pel-mo.Contemporary forms help confirm other variations in Old Tibetan. At one time, certain Old Tibetan words with alabial initial and a front vowel had been written with the bottom graph <y>, both in the Central Asian manuscriptsand on the Lhasa inscriptions, indicating that the labial initial had been palatalizedfor example, myi \"man,\" myin\"name,\" mye \"fire,\" myes \"grandfather,\" dpyes ''copy.\" Other words with a labial initial and a front vowel wereapparently not so palatalized, and were written without the <y>for example, min ''brother,\" me-tog~men-tog\"flower,\" dpen \"useful.\" After the language reforms of the early ninth century, the bottom graph <y>was eliminatedfrom all such words, and the words officially became mi(footnote continued from previous page)morphophonological rules would seem to call for -kyi or -gyi. It is very difficult to draw any conclusionsfrom such variation, not only because of its inconsistency even within a single manuscript, but also becausethese spellings may in fact reflect sporadic attempts at phonemicizing the writing of these particles. < previous pagepage_33next page >"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"page_34file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_34.html[8/7/2010 9:52:18 PM]< previous pagepage_34next page >Page 34\"man,\" min \"name,\" me \"fire,\" mes ''grandfather,\" dpe ''copy,\" presumably because that is the way the nobles inLhasa City pronounced them.In the far northwest, however, labials before front vowels in these words continued to be palatalized.

The problem of the preinitialsA striking feature both of the manuscripts and of the inscriptions is the variability of preinitials. In the CentralAsian manuscript material, whether from Khotan or Tun-huang, the scribes sporadically weaken or omit preinitialconsonants in complex syllable onset clusters: they write both <rkon>and <dkon>for dkon \"rare,\" both <rgu>and<dgu>for dgu \"nine,\" both <kar>and <dkar>for dkar \"white,\" both <go>and <mgo>for mgo \"head,\" both <pon>and <dpon >for dpon \"lord,\" both <tha >and <mtha >for mtha \"end,\" both <tsan>and <btsan>for btsan \"king,\"both <tsis>and <rtsis>for rtsis \"reckoned,\" both <lon>and <blon>for blon \"minister,\" both <sar>and <gsar>forgsar \"new.\"Similarly, on the Sino-Tibetan treaty pillar of 821, we find Old Tibetan <bka>\"command\" transliterated as MiddleChinese *ghya, Old Tibetan <rgan>\"old\" as Middle Chinese *kan, Old Tibetan <gtogs>\"attached\" as MiddleChinese *twok, Old Tibetan <lta>\"sees\" as Middle Chinese *tha, Old Tibetan <rgyal>\"king\" as Middle Chinese*kye, Old Tibetan <brtan>\"firm\" as Middle Chinese *tan, Old Tibetan <rma>\"name of a district\" as MiddleChinese *mwa, Old Tibetan <bla>\"high\" as Middle Chinese < previous pagepage_34next page >"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"page_35file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_35.html[8/7/2010 9:52:18 PM]< previous pagepage_35next page >Page 35*labut Old Tibetan <bzan>\"good\" as both Middle Chinese *dzhan and *b-dzhan <>, Old Tibetan<klu>\"serpent deity\" as both Middle Chinese and <>.

We find similar Chinese transliterations in the T'ang dynastic histories. In the Annals of the LaterT'ang we find what we can presume is Old Tibetan btsan \"king\" transliterated as Middle Chinese *tsan, OldTibetan blon \"minister\" as Middle Chinese *lywan, but Old Tibetan spyan \"eye\" as Middle Chinese *spyen <*syet-pyen >.Synchronically, it is clear that the speakers of the dialects reflected in these texts were not articulatingor were notconsistently articulatingearlier stopped nonnasal preinitials, and were weakening them or dropping themcompletely. It is equally clear, however, that, at the same time, the speakers of the Lhasa City dialect were writingtheir words with the preinitials indicated, right on the same pillar as the Chinese transcriptions, and were givingthose spellings the official sanction of their Buddhist translation commission. And in other dialects these preinitialsapparently continued to be articulated: note, for example, Old Tibetan dgu \"nine\" > New Tibetan (Khams) dgu, OldTibetan bdun \"seven\" > New Tibetan (Khams) bdun, Old Tibetan gtam \"story\" > New Tibetan (Khams) gtam, OldTibetan sgo \"door\" > New Tibetan (Khams) sgo.29This is all very puzzling. I believe it is plausible to suggest that we are dealing29 Loan words are not much help unless we know just where and when the loan took place. When Mongolkudri \"musk\" was borrowed into Tibetan as sku-bde-rigs, or when Mongol badur \"warrior\" was borrowedas dpa-bdu, or when Middle Chinese *lwyon \"dragon\" is written in Tibetan as both rlun \"wind\" and klun\"river\" in the compound rlunrta~klun-rta \"dragon horse ® prayer flag,\" we can guess that, at that time andplace, the preinitials were not being articulated as they were written; we just do not know where or whenthat was. But sometimes we can get close. For example, on the smaller of the two Chü-yung-kuaninscriptions, written in Mongolian, in Nphags-pa script, probably in the late thirteenth or early fourteenthcentury, we find Tibetan rab-gnas \"consecration\" as Mongol arabnas, Tibetan bla-ma \"lama\" as Mongollama, and Tibetan dge-bses \"professor\" as Mongol gebsi This inscription is, of course, a long time after anda long distance from the Sino-Tibetan treaty inscription, but it presumably still represents the speech ofsuch educated Tibetans as might have access to the Mongol court. < previous pagepage_35next page >"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"page_36file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_36.html[8/7/2010 9:52:19 PM]< previous pagepage_36next page >Page 36here with a social rather than a geographic dialecta social dialect that includes both the officials at Lhasa City andthe administrators and scribes of their Central Asian garrisons.30 But if preinitials tended to be elided in theprestige dialect, why were they made part of the official spellings? And ifas I prefer to hypothesizepreinitialstended to be articulated in the prestige dialect in slow or elevated speech, but elided when talking rapidly orconversationally, why were they not noted by the Chinese scribes who transliterated the Tibetan wordspresumablypronounced slowly and carefully for themon the treaty inscription?4. Defining Classical TibetanI will use the term CLASSICAL TIBETAN to refer to the language of written Tibetan texts, with the exception ofthe canonical translations, primarily from Sanskrit,31 and the language of modern newspapers and similar printed30 Assignment to an administrative post at one of the beautiful and civilized oasis cities of Central Asiawould not necessarily be a hardship post, although there were certainly some garrisons that wereconsiderably less attractive.31 Translations of Buddhist and other texts began during the first half of the eighth century; as we have noted,the vocabulary and style of the translation language were thoroughly regularized during the early part of theninth century, under King Khri Gtsuglde-btsan. With the promulgation of translation rules by the royalcommission, standardization of rendering became a primary virtue: as one commentator has noted, many of thetranslations of the ninth through the early twelfth centuries appear to be the work of unimaginative hacks. Thismechanical rendering of equivalents, however, has often been deemed a virtue by modern scholars who viewTibetan only as a means to \"reconstruct\" lost Sanskrit textsthat is, to engage in the peculiar exercise oftranslating Tibetan texts into Sanskrit.One of the problems was the difficulty of persuading qualified Indian teachers to travel to Tibet, a placeperceived as horrid and barbaric by any urbane Indian academic; another problem was the hazardfamine,thieves, strange diseaseswhich attended any trip to India by a Tibetan in search of a teacher. There wereexceptions, of course: the Indian Smrtijñanakirti came to Tibet in the latter half of the tenth century, searchingfor his transmigrating mother, who had been reborn as an insect in Rta-nag, and the great Dipamkarasrijnana,called Atisa \"Lord of lords,\" arrived in the early part of the eleventh century. But it was only with the Muslimconquest of North IndiaBenares and Bihar fell to the forces of Qutb-ud-Din in 1193, and the great monasticuniversity of Vikramasila was burned to the ground in 1206that Indian scholars fled to Tibet in any greatnumbers, bringing with them the first real understanding the Tibetans had of Sanskrit literary culture.

Iuse the term in conscious imitation of similar usage in Chinese literary study, where the term \"classical Chinese\"refers to the written language as a whole, from bronze inscriptions to novels, all of which is the province of theliterate scholar, but with the similar exclusion of translations from Sanskrit and the written Chinese of newspapersand magazines.Classical Tibetan, unlike many written languages, is in many ways independent of the spoken Tibetan language.For example, the basic phonological distinctions underlying the classical language have remainedthroughout itshistorythose of Old Tibetan. Even today, a writer of classical Tibetan will WRITE the form <sgrub>for the presentstem, <bsgrubs>for the past stem, and <bsgrub>for the future stem of the verb SGRUB \"accomplish,\" even whenall three forms are PRONOUNCED identically in his spoken languagefor example, New Tibetan (Lhasa) tup.Similarly, a writer of classical Tibetan will write the past stem of SAG \"gather\" as <bsags>, with an -s suffix, andthe past stem of SAD ''kill\" as <bsad>, without an -s suffix, because of an Old Tibetan syllable structure constraint,even when his spoken language no longer has syllable-final consonant clusters in any event. In both theseexamples, classical Tibetan is WRITTEN according to the phonological rules of Old Tibetan.33( footnote continued from previous page)tshen skyasribhadra arrived with a retinue of nine pandits in 1206; by the second half of the thirteenthcentury, son-ston Rdo-rdze rgyal-mtshan was working with Laksmikara to translate Sanskrit drama, poetry,and treatises on poetical theory. And these refugee scholars came with their books: the bulk of Sanskritmanuscripts preserved in Tibet date from the thirteenth century.32 Newspaper Tibetan has been called \"modern literary Tibetan\" by anthropologist Melvyn Goldstein, althoughits uses appear to me to be far from literary. Classical Tibetan, of course, continues to be written to this day, asthe language of learned discourse, and even as the language of popular culture; whether newspaper Tibetan willbecome a vehicle for a genuine colloquial literature remains to be seen, although early signs are encouraging.33 A parallel situation is found in Chinese poetry: words which once rhymed in older stages of the languagecontinued to be used as rhymes, even when they no longer rhymed in the spoken language of the poet, withspecial dictionaries compiled to tell the writer which words were supposed to be considered rhymes and whichwere not. < previous pagepage_37next page >"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"page_38file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_38.html[8/7/2010 9:52:20 PM]< previous pagepage_38next page >Page 38This is not to say, of course, that classical Tibetan has never been influenced by the spoken language. Suchinfluences can certainly be found. For example, the fifteenth-century Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, in his famousbiography of the eleventh-century poet Mi-la ras-pa, consistently used the Middle Tibetan conjunction -run \"BUT\"in his own prose, in contrast to the Old Tibetan conjunction -Yan \"BUT\" found consistently in the genuinely oldersongs attributed to Mi-la which he quotes. Similarly, dialect pronunciations have been given an Old Tibetanorthography and borrowed back into the classical language for example, Nphyor-pa \"pretty'' as mtshor-pa, andskyun-ka \"jackdaw\" as ltsun-ka. The amount of this influence, of course, varies with the author, the style, and thesubject matter: clearly a text on logic theory written for candidates for advanced monastic academic degrees willshow less influence from the contemporaneous dialect of its author than a book of popular maxims, even whenwritten by the same writer.34 Once again, the parallel with classical Chinese is striking.Figure 3.Illuminated book page34 In this regard we should note a remarkable group of nineteenth- and twentieth-century monk scholars inthe ris-med \"eclectic\" movement, beginning with Kon-sprul Karma Nagdban yon-tan rgya-mtsho, Ndzam-dbyans mkhyen-brtsei dban-po, and Mi-pham rgya-mtsho of Khams, who emphasized the unity of theTibetan religious tradition, and who initiated a lasting interest in oral literature and the epic tradition. < previous pagepage_38next page >"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"page_39file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_39.html[8/7/2010 9:52:20 PM]< previous pagepage_39next page >Page 394The Writing System1. Graph and SoundIt is important to distinguish between a linguistically functional sound and the written signor GRAPHhichrepresents that sound. This distinction was blurred among the Tibetan grammarians, who used the term yi-geindiscriminately to mean both a sound and the graph used to write that sound. Such usage can be misleading. Thescript does make some graphic distinctions that reflect significant phonological distinctions: for example, stoppedpreinitialsIt isgenerally assumed that the spoken word came before the written word. I suggestthat the spoken word as we know it came after the written word... .My basic theory isthat the written word was actually a virus that made the spoken word possible.William S. Burroughs, The Jobare written as left graphs and nonstopped preinitials are written as top graphs. But the writing system fails to reflectother and equally significant phonological distinctions: for example, in both zla \"moon\" and sla \"thin\" the -l- iswritten as a bottom graph; but in zla it is apparently an Old Tibetan postinitial, while in sla it is undoubtedly theinitial.11 Thus, too, the fact that the sequences <grags> and <grogs>are written with the same GRAPHICconventions does not mean they are PHONOLOGICALLY equivalentand, indeed, there is reason to believethat Old Tibetan grags \"fame\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) tha was phonologically distinct from Old Tibetangrogs \"helper\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) , despite their graphic similarity. < previous pagepage_39next page >"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"page_40file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_40.html[8/7/2010 9:52:21 PM]< previous pagepage_40next page >Page 40Moreover, it must be remembered that the writing system has remained virtually unchanged for a thousand years,while the spoken language has undergone change in several ways. The written form <sgrub>, originallyrepresenting Old Tibetan sgrub \"accomplishes\" < N-SGRUB, now represents, say, New Tibetan (Lhasa) tup. Nowphonological change has been sufficiently regular, in most cases, that a literate Lhasa city reader can process<sgrub >as representing tup; but the same person, as writer, cannot with similar assurance transcribe tup as<sgrub>, instead of, say, <Nbrub>or <Ndrub>, which also represent New Tibetan (Lhasa) tup. Rather, it must belearned that tup \"accomplishes\" is written <sgrub>, that tup \"overflows\" is written <Nbrub>, and that tup \"sews'' iswritten <Ndrub>.2 The growing divorce between writing and speech leads to another occasional anomalythe fact,not only that Tibetans are generally terrible spellers, but also that a Tibetan can say things he does not know howto write at all. Such a common expression as New Tibetan (Lhasa) \"last year'' seems to have no written form; itis represented graphically where necessary by the unrelated sequence <na-nin >.32. The Invention of WritingThe traditional account of the invention of the Tibetan writing system is set forth in the ecclesiastical history ofBu-ston (1290-1364). There we are told that Thon-mi Anui-bu was sent to India by king Sron-btsan sgam-po (whoruled from about 627 to 650) along with sixteen companions in order to study writing; he studied with a panditanamed Lha-rig-pai sen-ge, created the Tibetan alphabet based on a Kashmiri prototype, and composed eight workson writing and grammar. This bare account is progressively elaborated in the later historical texts, which addcircumstantial details to the story. The name Thon-mi-Thu-mi-Mtho-mi becomes associated with two earlierandprob-2 Conservative writing systems representing changing languages therefore aspire to the condition ofChinese, with the relationship between graph and sound becoming increasingly arbitrary and, eventually,the subject of sheer memorization.3 Note too that one can, of course, write a graphic sequence representing a syllable which is not allowed by thephonological rules of the language. Thus the graphic sequence <brklub>can be interpreted as representing asyllable ?brklub, which is not a permitted syllable, just as the sequence <bsgrub >can be interpreted asrepresenting the syllable bsgrub, which is. < previous pagepage_40next page >"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"page_41file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_41.html[8/7/2010 9:52:21 PM]< previous pagepage_41next page >Page 41ably compositegrammatical works, the Sum-tsu-pa and the Rtags-kyi Ndzugpa. We should note, however, that theearliest, and simplest, account was written seven hundred years after the events it purports to describe, and thatgenuinely ancient Tibetan historical records from Central Asia unavailable to Bu-ston and his successorsappear tocontain no mention of Thon-mi at all.Considerable doubt can thus be cast on the traditional account of the invention of Tibetan writing, and there areconsiderable difficulties concerning even the historicity of its putative inventor. Moreover, an Indian inscription onbaked bricks from Gopalpur, written in a script virtually identical with the Tibetan, has been independently datedto around 500. Such evidence gives reason to believe that any purported invention was, if anything, astandardization of Indic scripts already in circulation for as long as a century. Such standardization presumablywould have fixed the graphs for phonemes which are found in Old Tibetan but not in Sanskritprenasalization,voiced fricatives, and one series of affricates, as well as smooth vocalic ingress primarily through the modificationof existing graphs.4The development of a writing system was apparently due to administrative rather than religious needs, at least atthe beginning. One of the earliest references to writing is in the ancient annals discovered at the caves near Tun-huang, which briefly describe the principal events of each year from the death of Sron-btsan sgam-po in 650through 747. The entry for the year 655 reads btsan-po mer-khe-na bzugs-sin, blon-tshe ston-tsan-gyis Ngor-tirbka-grims-kyi yi-ge bris \"The King stayed at Mer-khe, and prime minister Ston-tsan wrote the text of hiscommands to Ngor-ti.\"5 The earliest extant dated Tibetan writing is found on a pillar erected at Zol and dated 767.The pillar was erected by the powerful minister Nan-lam stag-sgra klu-gon, recording his services to the king,including victories over the Chinese, and the rewards he received. The pillar makes no mention of Buddhism.4For example, the graphs for the dental affricates dz, ts, tsh are the same as the graphs for the palatalaffricates ds, ts, tsh with a small hook added; the graph for z is the graph for dz backwards; the graph for zis, perhaps, derived from the graph for ñ. The origin of the graph called a-tshun \"little a\" by the Tibetangrammarians is a matter of much dispute.5 Note the implication that the king himself was illiterate. < previous pagepage_41next page >"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"page_42file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_42.html[8/7/2010 9:52:22 PM]< previous pagepage_42next page >Page 423. The Writing SystemThe principles of the Tibetan writing system are easily described. The original technical problem was that of takinga syllabic script used for the predominantly open Indic syllable and adapting it to the complex onset clusters andclosed syllables of Tibetan. The key to the adaptation is a small raised dot called tsheg \"dot,\" which defines theboundaries of the syllable: everything between two dots constitutes one syllable. The word \"syllable\" in Tibetan istsheg-bar ''between the dots.\"The following table shows the graphic structure of the Tibetan syllable, which we will discuss in the followingparagraphs; the GRAPHIC structure of the syllable must, of course, be kept conceptually distinct from itsPHONOLOGICAL structure. The numbers in the table indicate the sequence in which the graphs are processed.5 VOWEL2 TOP1 LEFT3 CENTER6 RIGHT7 FAR RIGHT4 BOTTOM5 VOWELTable 3. Graphic structure of the Old Tibetan syllableThe minimum graphic sequence consists of one CENTER GRAPH and one VOWEL GRAPH either above orbelow the center graph. This sequence is processed as an open syllable, with the vowel last; a vowel graph cannotbe written independently of a center graph. The center graph may be any one of the 29 graphs representing theconsonants g, k, kh, d, t, th, b, p, ph, d, t, th, dz, ts, tsh, , ñ, n, m, ,, z, s, y, r, 1, w,, and h.

This seems tobe precisely the same distinction as that between Chinese yü ''smooth vocalic ingress\" and ying \"glottalstop\" known to the ancient Chinese phoneticians and reconstructed for the language of the sixth centuryAD.For some reason, however, the Tibetan phoneticians identified their glottal stop with the onset of Sanskritsyllables written without initial consonant graphs. Now Indic descriptions of this onset are puzzling; butperhaps in contemporaneous Sanskrit pronunciation a predictable and hence nonphonemic glottal stop did infact precede every vowel without other consonant onset, just as in present-day English-compare, for example,English <hour>with French ör <heure>. This is certainly true in modern Hindi; a Hindi speaker will readthe vowel <a>, for example, as . Thus the Tibetan graph <> for the glottal stop is derived from andidentified with the Indic graph <a>, which was presumably pronounced . And it was the place-holding grapha-tshun \"little a,\" representing as center graph a smooth vocalic ingress-a graph not found in Sanskrit-that theTibetan orthographers considered their own innovation.That is the reason Ngos lo-tsa-ba Gzon-nu-dpal notes particularly that the Sanskrit alphabet was adapted toTibetan by including the smooth vocalic ingress among the consonants: rgyagar-la med-kyan bod-la za-danza-dan a-rnams dgos. Now the glottal stop is, of course, phonemic in Tibetan, as in such minimal pairs as og\"underpart\"\"neck,\" and the Tibetan grammarians remained puzzled as to why the Sanskrit grammariansconsidered the glottal stop to be a vowel; still, in imitation of the prestigious Indian model, they used the graph<> when discussing vowels, and thus would apparently speak of \"the vowel \" or \"the vowel ,\" instead of\"the vowel a\" or \"the vowel o,\" much to the confusion of everyone involved.Essentially, the place-holding graph a-tshun \"little a\" is used to write THE ABSENCE OF A CONSONANT.When this graph-which I will represent in this footnote with the phonetically neutral symbol </>-appears inthe center graph position, it indicates the absence of an INITIAL consonant: that is, it represents a smoothvocalic ingress, as in og </og>or ur </ur>, as opposed, say, to < og>or dur <dur>. In postvocalic position,it indicates the absence of an INTERVOCALIC consonant: that is, it represents that the vowel which follows isthe second member of a diphthong, as inpai <pa/i>or beu <be/u>. And, in the right graph position, it indicatesthe absence of a FINAL consonant: that is, it indicates that the rightmost of the consonant graphs is the centergraph, as in dga <dga/>or mna <mna/>, as opposed, say, to dag <dag>or man <man>. < previous pagepage_43next page >"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"page_44file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_44.html[8/7/2010 9:52:24 PM]< previous pagepage_44next page >Page 44This placeholding functionindicating the absence of a consonantis clearly the function of the graph in the earlyTibetan manuscript transcriptions of Chinese Buddhist texts.

And again, the graph marks the absence of consonant coda intranscribing Middle Chinese open syllables: Middle Chinese *ya is transcribed as <ha/>, Middle Chinese *naas <Nda/>, Middle Chinese *na as <Nga/>, Middle Chinese *nye as <Ngi/>, and Middle Chinese *ni as<Ngi/>.Similar examples are found in the Sino-Tibetan treaty inscription of 821, where the placeholding a-tshunmarks the absence of intervocalic consonants in Middle Chinese diphthongs: Middle Chinese istranscribed as <tse/u>, Middle Chinese *kau as <ka/u>or <ke/u>, Middle Chinese *kai as <kha/e>, MiddleChinese as <Ngi/u>, Middle Chinese *xau as <he/u>, Middle Chinese as <li/u>, Middle Chinese as <dze/u>, Middle Chinese *thai as <tha/i>or <the/e>, and Middle Chinese as <zi/u>or <si/u>.Since the place-holding graph represents the absence of a consonant, it is unambiguously transliterated intoEnglish script as the absence of a consonantfor example, ur instead of, say, /ur, beu instead of, say, be/u, anddga instead of, say, dga/. Such transliteration will be our practice throughout this text, except where, as above,the graphic a-tshun is explicitly rendered as </> for expository purposes.It is interesting to note that the Korean script, invented in the fifteenth century, according to tradition, by KingSejong, also contains a place-holding graph. This place-holding graph contrasts with a glottal stop graph,despite the fact that Korean has no distinction between smooth vocalic and glottal stop onsets; rather, thegraphs were created to provide distinct spellings for these onsets when they occurred in Chinese loanwordsforexample, Middle Chinese *i \"barbarian\" as opposed to *\"physician.\" The graph for the glottal stop was soongiven up, and only the graph for smooth vocalic ingress was retained. That graph is still used in Koreanwriting, becausejust as in Tibetanthe orthographic rules require that each syllable begin with a consonantgraph; and, if the syllable begins with a vowelfor example, the second syllable in së-ul \"Seoul\"the place-holding graph is used.There is, in fact, some reason to believe that King Sejong knew the Tibetan writing system, at least in the formit took in China to write Mongol during the Yüan dynastythe writing called the Nphags-pa script, from thename of its inventor, the Nphags-pa Blo-gros rgyalmtshan, a Sa-skya monk at the court of Khubilai Khan, whodeclared it the official script(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_44next page >"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"page_45file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_45.html[8/7/2010 9:52:25 PM]< previous pagepage_45next page >Page 45As in other Indic scripts, the vowel a is signalled by the ABSENCE of an overt vowel graph; we may say,conventionally, that the vowel graph <a> for the vowel a is the ZERO GRAPH.7 A center graph with no otheraccompanying overt vowel graph necessarily has the invisible zero graph, and thus the syllable nucleus must be a.Therefore, just as a vowel graph cannot occur independently of a center graph, a center graph cannot occurindependently< previous pagepage_45next page >"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"page_46file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_46.html[8/7/2010 9:52:25 PM]< previous pagepage_46next page >Page 46written with the graph <g> plus the vowel graph <i> written above the center graph, followed by a dot; thesyllable u is written with the place-holding a-tshun, to indicate the absence of an initial consonant, plus the vowelgraph <u>written below the center graph, followed by a dot; and so on.Above the center graphbut below any superscript vowel graphmay be written one of three TOP GRAPHS, whichare reduced forms of the center graphs for r, l, and s.

In the classical Tibetan writing system we find the digraphs<lh>and <hr>-that is, a center graph <h>with a top graph <1>, and a center graph <h > with a bottomgraph <r>. In several New Tibetan dialects these digraphs represent the VOICELESS GLIDES l and r,with such minimal pairs as New Tibetan (Lhasa) la <Iha>\"god\" la <la>\"mountain pass,\" lak<lhag>\"special\" lak <lag>''hand,'' rü <hrul>\"ragged\" rü <rul>\"rotten.\" Could these digraphs haverepresented such voiceless glides in Old Tibetan as well? This seems unlikely; we find, for example, suchclassical doublets as lhan-glan \"patch,\" LHOD-GLOD \"relax,\" lhog-glog \"ulcer,\" LHAD-GLAD-SLAD\"adulterate,\" hril-gril \"round,\" and hran-gran \"cold.\" Note also New Tibetan (Ladakh) la <lha>\"god,\" lu<glu>\"song,\" lans <slans>\"arise,\" where Old Tibetan lh changes historically just like Old Tibetan gl or slinto New Tibetan (Ladakh) l, a voiced murmured lateral. The digraphs thus seem likely to have representedgenuine clusters of glottal fricative plus glide; but other explanations are surely possible. Anomalously, onthe Sino-Tibetan treaty pillar of 821, we find the cluster lh transcribed by Chinese characters whose initialhas been independently reconstructed as Middle Chinese *th. Thus Old Tibetan lha is transcribed as MiddleChinese *tha or *tham, and Old Tibetan lho as Middle Chinese *thuo.

First, as early as the ninth century, on the Sino-Tibetantreaty pillar of 821, we find independently reconstructed Middle Chinese nasal initials transcribed by whatthen must have been Old Tibetan prenasalized stopsfor example, Middle Chinese *nuo as <Ngo>, MiddleChinese *nyen as <Ngin>, Middle Chinese *nywo as <Ngu>, Middle Chinese *myu as <Nbu>, and MiddleChinese *mywan as <Nbun>. Similar transcriptions are found in the Tibetan transliterations of ChineseBuddhist prayer texts discovered near Tun-huangfor example, Middle Chinese *nwai as <Ngwe>, MiddleChinese *nwo as <Ngo>, Middle Chinese *nye as <Ngi>, Middle Chinese *nzi as <Ngyar>, and MiddleChinese *nywo as <Ndzi>. Second, Indic loanwords in Old Tibetan are occasionally written with a-tshun inleft graph position to represent a preceding nasal. For example, in an early Tibetan-Chinese manuscriptvocabulary lista sort of traveler's dictionary found near the Tun-huang caravanseraiwe find <se-Nge>instead of the later standard orthography <sen-ge>for sen-ge \"lion\" < Sanskrit simha, Apabhramsasinghu-simhu. Elsewhere in the classical texts we find both <se-Ndu-ra>and <sindhu-ra>for sindhu-ra\"vermilion\" < Sanskrit sindura, Apabhramsa sinduru, Hindi seNdur. Third, in the archaic eighth- and ninth-century manuscript material from Central Asia, we not infrequently find a-tshun in left graph positionwritten idiosyncratically following a preceding final nasal: for example, we find <tsen-Ngi>where thestandard orthography would have <tsen-gi>, <Nbyam-Ngi>for <Nbyam-gyi>, <om-Nbu>for <om-bu>,<skyin-Ndan>for <skyin-dan>, and <sen-Nge>for <sen-ge>. Fourth, we find doublets in the classicallanguage where a-tshun in left graph position alternates with <m >in left graph positionfor example,NTSHER~MTSHER \"grieve,\" NTHOL~MTHOL ''confess,\" Ntshin-bu~mtshin-bu ''spurious glass jewel,\"Ndan~mdan \"funeral,\" Ngal-pa~mgal-pa \"billet of wood,\" Nkhar-ba~mkhar-ba \"staff.\" Fifth, loanwordsfrom Middle Tibetan into Monguora dialect of Mongoliandate from the thirteenth century: these loanwordsshow prenasalization where the corresponding Tibetan written forms show a-tshun in left graphpositionMonguor nkhuorlo \"circle\" < Middle Tibetan *Nkhor-lo <Nkhor-lo>, Monguor ndogon \"meetinghouse\" < Middle Tibetan *Ndu-khan <Ndu-khan>, Monguor mbem \"100,000\" < Middle Tibetan *Nbum<Nbum>, Monguor mbo \"stipend\" < Middle Tibetan *Nbo <Nbogs>.Why was this prenasalization represented by a-tshun, the place-holding graph? It is instructive to compareprenasalization with what occurs in Tibetan chant: here the singer attempts to maintain an uninterrupted levelof sound while articulating the words very slowly and with various melodic embellishmentsa singing techniquewhich, in its striking similarity to Japanese Shingon chant, apparently derives from Tang dynasty ChineseBuddhist sources. In this chanting style, as the articulators move into position for each stopped consonant, thesinger briefly lowers his velum to allow the flow of air to continue unimpeded, yielding a prenasalization ofeach stopped consonant in the chantfor example, New Tibetan (Lhasa) totsephamo <rdo-rdze phag-mo>\"Diamond Sow Goddess\" is chanted as toNtseNphamo, and New Tibetan (Lhasa) <Nphags-paspyan-ras-gzigs>\"Noble Avalokitesvara\" is chanted as The point is this: there is a close relationapparent to a Tibetan(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_47next page >"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"page_48file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_48.html[8/7/2010 9:52:27 PM]< previous pagepage_48next page >Page 48processing of the top, center, and bottom graphs, with the vowel graph processed last: thus a left graph <d>, acenter graph <g>, a bottom graph <r>, and a zero vowel graph <a>is processed as <dgra>, representing thesyllable dgra; a left graph <b>, a top graph <r>, a center graph <dz>, and a vowel graph <u>is processed as<brdzu>, representing the syllable brdzu; a left graph a-tshun \"little a,\" a center graph <g>, a bottom graph <y>,and a vowel graph <e>is processed as <Ngye>, representing the syllable Ngye; and so on.To the right of the center graph may be written one of ten RIGHT GRAPHS, which are full forms of the graphsfor g, n d, n, b, m, r, l, s, and a-tshun, which in this position represents the absence of a syllable-final consonant,just as, in the center graph position, it represents the absence of a syllable-initial consonant.11 A right graph isprocessed last, after the vowel graph: thus a(footnote continued from previous page)between such prenasalization and a preceding open syllable-that is, the absence of a consonant. It is notsurprising to find the a-tshun used to mark this onset.11 An overt vowel graph, or a top or bottom graph, unambiguously identifies the center graph in a graphicsequence. However, when there is no overt vowel graphthat is, when there is the zero vowel graphand no top orbottom graph, then the location of the center graph can be ambiguous: for example, the sequence <dg>couldbe processed either as <dag>, with <d>read as the center graph, or as <dga>, with <g> read as the centergraph. But, with a-tshun in the right graph position, the sequence can only be processed as <dga>, since itshows that there is no syllable-final consonant in the syllable which the sequence represents. Thus the graphicconvention is used only when other means are lacking unambiguously to flag which of two consecutiveconsonant graphs is in fact the center graph: the place-holding graph is unnecessaryand unusedwhen an overtvowel graph identifies the center graph, as in <dgu>or <dge>, or when a top or bottom graph identifies thecenter graph, as in <brda>or <bkra>.Interestingly, this convention allows such inferences only from graphic structure, not from syllable structure.The sequence <gz>is graphically ambiguous between the readings <gza > and <gaz>, but the syllable gza is apossible syllable, while the syllable ?gaz is not; still, the writing system marks <z> as the center graph byputting a-tshun in the right graph position, to resolve the GRAPHIC ambiguity, and allowing no inferenceconcerning the center graph to be made from the fact that the sequence could not PHONOLOGICALLY beprocessed as ?gaz.In fact, it took some time for this graphic convention to take hold.

Such inconsistencies were presumably eradicated in the ninth-century language reforms ofKing Khri Gtsug-lde-btsan.The place-holding graph in right-graph position also allows the writing of diphthongsfor example, beu <be/u>,paan <pa/an>, mao <ma/o>. In this position, a-tshun in effect represents smooth vocalic ingress into thesecond vowel of the diphthong, but within a single syllable, since the graphs are not separated by the syllable-marking dot tsheg. Here again it apparently took some time to establish the convention: in the archaicmanuscripts we sporadically find diphthongs written as two syllables, and sporadically as well we find suchgraphic sequences as <pi>and <bi>representing what must surely have been the syllables pai and bai Onceagain, the linguistic standardization of the ninth century apparently intended to establish a universal conventionin this regard, although it is doubtful that there was in fact any effective standardization prior to the period ofthe Sa-skya hegemony.The writing of such diphthongs-with a-tshun marking the absence of consonant onset of the secondvowelapparently underlies the convention of writing a-tshun as a BOTTOM GRAPH to indicate long vowelsin the transliteration of Sanskrit. Such long vowels were in all likelihood heard as equivalent to Tibetangeminate vowelsSanskrit ka as Tibetan kaa, Sanskrit ki as Tibetan kii, Sanskrit ku as Tibetan kuu. An a-tshunin the bottom graph position, with the appropriate vowel graph over or under the center graph, would be aconvenient abbreviation for such recurring geminate diphthongs, instead of writing a-tshun in right graphposition and repeating the same vowel graph; such an abbreviation too is consistent with the conventions forgraphic abbreviation used elsewhere in the language. That this was in fact the origin of the transliterationconvention is indicated by the fact that it is used to indicate length in Sanskrit vowels only where length is infact quantitative, as in a or r, but not where the so-called long vowel is qualitatively different from its shortequivalent, as in ai or au, where another conventionwriting the vowel graph twiceis used instead.12 The graph <d>in far right position, representing a postfinal -d or da-drag \"strong d,\" is found in somearchaic manuscripts recovered from Central Asia; in some West Tibetan(footnote continued on next page < previous pagepage_49next page >"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"page_50file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_50.html[8/7/2010 9:52:28 PM]< previous pagepage_50next page >Page 50processed after the preceding right graph: thus a center graph <g>, a bottom graph <y>, a vowel graph <u>, aright graph <r>, and a far right graph <d>is processed as <gyurd>, representing the syllable gyurd; a left graphPrimitive societies are oral, not because they lack graphic expression,but on the contrary because their graphic expression is independentfrom the voice, marking signs on human bodies in answer to voice, butautonomously, and not aligned on voice; conversely, barbariancivilizations are scriptural, not for loss of voice, but because the graphicsystem has lost its independence and proper dimensions, has aligneditself on voice, subordinated itself to it...Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus<d>, a center graph <g>, a vowel graph <o>, a right graph <n>, and a far right graph <s>is processed as<dgons>, representing the syllable dgons; and so on.13(footnote continued from previous page)materials as late as the thirteenth century; and in the writings of the Tibetan grammarians, where it is anallophone of the past tense suffix -s.13 There still remain a few sequences of consonant graphs which are ambiguous where there is no overt vowelgraphthat is, where there is the zero vowel graphand no top or bottom graph to identify the center graph, andwhich cannot be disambiguated by the use of the place-holding graph a-tshun. For example, the sequence<dgs>is ambiguous between the readings <dgas>and <dags>, and, similarly, the sequence <dns>could beprocessed as either <dnas>or <dans>. (Of course, the sequence <dgos>can only be read one way, since thegraph <o>sits unambiguously on top of the center graph <g>, just as in <dogs>the graph <o> sitsunambiguously on top of the center graph <d>.) These ambiguous sequences are often disambiguated by yetanother convention: if the sequence is to be processed as representing a syllable with no preinitial, then thecenter graph is identified by writing a phonologically nonfunctional <w>as the bottom graph beneath it. Thusthe sequence <dgs>is read only as <dgas>, representing the syllable dgas. The syllable dags is representedinstead by the unambiguous graphic sequence <dwags>, although the use of this convention is in fact highlyirregular. < previous pagepage_50next page >"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"page_51file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_51.html[8/7/2010 9:52:28 PM]< previous pagepage_51next page >Page 514. The ScriptThe Tibetan script is, I believe, esthetically one of the most pleasing of the Indic scripts; the following briefdiscussion can do little more than briefly indicate the styles of handwriting, without exploration of details.Equivalent to our hand printing are the graphs called dbu-tsan \"with a head,\" referring to the horizontal line at thetop of many of the graphs. Figure 4 shows two different folio sides from a manuscript written in the dbu-tsanscript; note the section headings and instructions written in smaller script. The dbu-tsan writing is also thatgenerally used in books printed from carved woodblocks, as in Figure 5.Figure 4.

Articulatory Descriptions1.1. VowelsOld Tibetan vowels are phonemes that may function as syllabic nuclei. Put another way, vowels are phonemes thatmay by themselves constitute a syllable. In Old Tibetan ka and a are both possible syllables, while ?k and ?r arenot. A syllabic phoneme such as a is therefore a VOWEL; a non-syllabic phoneme such as k and r is a consonant.Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg? James Joyce, UlyssesThere are five vowels in Old Tibetanu, o, a, i and e. These five vowels are distinguished according to the positionof the tongue as either BACK or FRONT; according to the height of the tongue as either HIGH or LOW; andaccording to the shape of the lips as either ROUNDED or SPREAD. The vowel u is a HIGH < previous pagepage_55next page >"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"page_56file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_56.html[8/7/2010 9:52:31 PM]< previous pagepage_56next page >Page 56BACK ROUNDED vowel; the vowel o is a LOW BACK ROUNDED vowel; the vowel a is a LOW BACKSPREAD vowel; the vowel i is a HIGH FRONT SPREAD vowel; and the vowel e is a LOW FRONT SPREADVOWEL. These three descriptions exhaustively characterize the Old Tibetan vowels. The vowel e, for example, iscompletely specified by its description as the Old Tibetan low front spread vowel.Note that in Old Tibetan there are no front rounded vowels (although front rounded vowels such as ü and ö doappear in some New Tibetan dialects and, presumably, to some degree in Middle Tibetan as well). This asymmetrymay be expressed as a phoneme structure constraintthat is, a rule which puts constraints on the internal structure ofOld Tibetan phonemes as follows:Rule 1. All Front Vowels Must Be Spread.This constraint is a rule about possible phonemes. No derivation in Old Tibetan can yield a front rounded vowel,since every front vowel automatically is a spread vowel.For example, the Old Tibetan present stem inflectional suffix -D moves preceding back vowels to the front of themouth. Thus, in the presence of this suffix, the low back spread vowel a becomes the low front spread vowel e (forexample, Ngrel < N-GRAL-D \"explains\"); but the high back rounded vowel u becomes the high front spread voweli and not the high front rounded vowel ?ü (for example, Ndzin < N-DZUN-D \"grasps,\" rather than ?Ndziin),because, as Rule 1 describes, in any derivation the high front rounded vowel ?ü automatically becomes the highfront spread vowel i. Indeed, the loss of this rule, and the concomitant development of phonemic front roundedvowels, characterizes the development of several New Tibetan dialects, where we find, for example, New Tibetan(Lhasa) khii <gus>\"faith\" khö <gos>\"clothes,'' thii <dud>\"smoke'' thö <dod>\"substitute.\"11 Of course, Old Tibetan may have had a SOUND something like ü or ösay, when the vowel u or ooccurred before the dental finals -d or -sbut then that sound did not count as being DIFFERENT from u oro. It was only when that difference began to count, probably around the time the final -d or -s was ceasingto be pronounced, that we can say there emerged phonemic front rounded vowelsthat is, when, instead ofcontrasting rgyu \"cause\" with rgyud \"string,\" the language contrasted rgyu with rgyü, or, instead ofcontrasting bzo \"craft\" with bzod \"patience,\" the language contrasted bzo with bzö. < previous pagepage_56next page >"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"page_57file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_57.html[8/7/2010 9:52:32 PM]< previous pagepage_57next page >Page 571.2.

We can, however, assign OldTibetan consonants to the general area of their articulation in the mouththe LABIAL consonants b, p, ph, m, and wpresumably articulated by the lips; the DENTAL consonants d, t, th, n, dz, ts, tsh, z, s, and l presumably articulatedby the tongue placed somewhere behind the upper teeth; the single RETROFLEX consonant r presumablyarticulated with the tongue tip curled up and back;2 the PALATAL consonants n, dz, ts, tsh, z, s, and y presumablyarticulated by the tongue placed somewhere on or near the hard palate; the VELAR consonants g, k, kh, and npresumably articulated with the back part of the tongue touching the soft palate; and the GLOTTAL consonants and h presumably articulated by the glottis or vocal cords alone.32 At least historically a postinital consonant r moved a preceding stop into such a retroflex positionforexample, Old Tibetan drug \"six\" > New Tibetan (Dpari) drux (Golok) druk (Ladakh) duk (Dbus) tuk(Lhasa) thu (Lhasa aristocratic) tshu, Old Tibetan sprin \"cloud\" > New Tibetan (Purik) sprin (Derge) trim(Dbus) tiN(K'ang-ting) (Lhasa) tiN (Lhasa aristocratic) tsiN (Ladakh) sin.3 There are several lines of evidence leading to the conclusion that the Old Tibetan graph <>represented aglottal stop and the graph <h>represented a glottal fricative. First, there is the virtual unanimity of the NewTibetan dialects, where we find glottal stops consistently where Old Tibetan presumably had a glottal stop aswell-for example, Old Tibetan \"mother\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) (Dbus) (Khams) ,OldTibetan \"older sister\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) (Balti) (Dbus) Old Tibetan ''beard\" >New Tibetan (Ladakh) (Dbus).We also find such classical doublets as \"chin\" and \"throat,'' which certainly seem to place the phoneme represented by the graph <>in the back ofthe throat.In this regard the remarks of the Tibetan grammarians are of interest. Following the Sanskrit tradition, theygroup aspirates, fricatives, and vowels together as srog-tshen \"breathy (mahaprana),\" as opposed to all theother phonemes, which are srog-tshun \"non-breathy (alpaprana).\" Given an idiosyncrasy of the Tibetandescriptive apparatus, the glottal stop is grouped with the vowels, and it becomes necessary to account for it.Si-tu mahapandita,( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_57next page >"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"page_58file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_58.html[8/7/2010 9:52:34 PM]< previous pagepage_58next page >Page 58Such distinctions of place can have morphological significance. For example, there cannot be two labial consonantsin the same syllable onset: there can be no syllables with the form ?brma or ?mpho parallel to brda or mtho. Thuswe find such regular tense stems as bris < b-BRI-s \"wrote,\" bod < b-BOD-s \"called,\" and rmos < b-RMO-s\"ploughed,\" with the inflectional past stem prefix b- omitted in accordance with this constraint. Again, we findplace assimilations in several verb stems, where the inflectional present stem suffix -D moves both back vowelsand velar nasals to the front of the mouthfor example, sbed < N-SBA-D ''conceals,'' sel < N-SAL-D \"clears away,\"Ndren < NDRAN-D \"leads,\" and Ndzin < N-DZUN-D \"grasps.\"( footnote continued from previous page)writing in 1744, makes the following interesting distinction: mgrin-pa gdans-nas brdzod dgospaiphyir ma-gtogs-pai srog-tshen-gyiyi-ge-rnamsphye-bai rtsol-ba-tsan-dan, mgrinpa ma-phye-bar brdzod-pai phyir btsum-pai rtsol-ba-tsan \"Since they must be pronounced with the throat wide open, the breathyphonemes other than are called OPEN ARTICULATIONS; but since must be pronounced with thethroat closed it is called a CLOSED ARTICULATION.\"Further evidence is provided by Tibetan transcriptions of Chinese words, where the graph <> is consistentlyused to transcribe what have been independently reconstructed as Middle Chinese glottal stops. For example,on the Sino-Tibetan treaty pillar of 821, Middle Chinese *is transcribed as <>. Similarly, in a series ofmanuscripts from Central Asia, we find Chinese Buddhist texts transliterated into Tibetan, presumably so theycould be recited by Tibetan travelers; where such fragments have been identified and compared with theirChinese originals, we find Middle Chinese transcribed as <>, Middle Chinese *as <>or <>,Middle Chinese as <>, Middle Chinese as <>, and Middle Chinese as <>.Similar evidence leads to the conclusionperhaps less firmthat Old Tibetan had a corresponding glottal fricativeh, written with the graph <h>. Again, we find New Tibetan glottal fricatives representing what werepresumably Old Tibetan glottal fricative initialsfor example, Old Tibetan hor \"Mongol\" > New Tibetan (Derge)hor (Lhasa) . In the classical language we find such doublets as hril-gril \"round\" and lhan-glan \"patch,\" andwe may note the spelling <ha-mdo>for the classical place name \"Amdo,\" attested in the Deb-ther snon-po of Gzon-nu-dpal, written in 1478. Finally, on the Sino-Tibetan treaty pillar of 821, Tibetan <h>is used totranscribe, indiscriminately, both the voiced and voiceless velar fricatives y and x independently reconstructedfor Middle Chinese. We find Middle Chinese *ya transcribed as <ha>, Middle Chinese *yan as <han>,Middle Chinese *ywo as <ho>, and Middle Chinese *xau as <heu>; similarly, on that same pillar, Old Tibetanhab is transcribed by the character representing Middle Chinese *yap. < previous pagepage_58next page >"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"page_59file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_59.html[8/7/2010 9:52:34 PM]< previous pagepage_59next page >Page 591.2.2. ClosureIt is useful to distinguish three degrees of CLOSURE between the articulators of a phonemebetween the tongue andthe palate, for example, or between the two lips, or between the lower lip and the upper teeth. In STOPPEDphonemes the articulators are pressed together sufficiently to cut off the airstream completely; in NARROWEDphonemes the articulators are closed sufficiently to produce a hissing turbulence in the airstream; and in OPENphonemes the articulators are not closed sufficiently to disturb the airstream at all.Using these distinctions we can characterize four types of consonant in Old Tibetan. STOPS are phonemes, such ask, b, or n, which are stopped but not narrowed; FRIATIVES are phonemes, such as f, z or s, which are narrowedbut not stopped; APPROXIMANTS are phonemes, such as l, w, or a, which neither stopped nor narrowedthat is,which are open; and AFFRICATES are phonemes, such as pf, ts, or dz, which are both stopped and narrowedthatis, which begin as stops and end as fricatives.Note that approximants such as a, u, or e, which can function as syllabic nuclei, are, of course, VOWELS;approximants such as y, r, or l, which cannot function as syllabic nuclei, we will call GLIDES. There were thus inOld Tibetan the STOPS , g, k, kh, d, t, th, b, p, ph, n, ñ, n, and m, the AFFRICATES d, t, th, dz, ts, and tsh, theFRICATIVES h, , , z, and s, and the GLIDES y, r, l, and w.Tibetan makes a significant distinction between consonants with a stopped component and consonants without astopped component. Such STOPPED consonants are stops and affricates; UNSTOPPED consonants are fricativesand approximants. For example, in Old Tibetan only stopped consonants can be prenasalized; again, in Old Tibetanonly unstopped preinitial consonants can be preceded by the past and future stem b- prefix.Affricates frequently alternate with their corresponding fricatives. For example, in verbal inflection the intransitiveroot DZUG \"enter\" forms the past stem zugs < Ø-DZUG-S; the intransitive root DZAG \"trickle\" forms the paststem zags < Ø-DZAG-S; the transitive root DZIB \"suck'' forms the past stem bZibs < b-DZIB-S; and the transitiveroot DZAR \"hang up\" forms the past stem bzar < b-DZAR-S.

This process we will call UNSTOPPING.41.2.3. Voice onset timeIt is common to describe Tibetan consonants according to the traditional categories of Sanskrit phonology, whereinconsonants are either voiced or voiceless and either aspirated or unaspirated; Old Tibetan, with a three-waydistinction of consonants, then appears rather like a defective version of the Sanskrit fourfold system, with voicedaspirated stops such as gh and bh somehow omitted.4 Unstopping is a \"natural\" process in Tibetan, which seems willing to change an affricate into thecorresponding fricative not only inflectionally but historically as well. Old Tibetan la-sogs-pa \"and so on\"is found written in archaic Central Asian manuscripts as <las-stogs~ lastsogs~la-stsogs>, indicating Proto-Tibetan *tsogs \"group'' > Old Tibetan sogs; presumably as well Proto-Tibetan *gñis-btsu \"twenty\" > OldTibetan ñi-su. Unstopping is also found in dialect variations. For example, we find Old Tibetan tsha-bo''nephew\" > New Tibetan (Golok) sawo, Old Tibetan tshe-rin \"long life\" > New Tibetan (Golok) serun, OldTibetan tshogs \"assembly\" > New Tibetan (Golok) sok, or, similarly, Old Tibetan mdzug \"tail\" > NewTibetan (Balti) zug, Old Tibetan Ndzigs \"fear\" > New Tibetan (Balti) zig, Old Tibetan mdzub \"finger\" >New Tibetan (Balti) zu, Old Tibetan mdzo \"yak hybrid\" > New Tibetan (Balti) zo. In the Middle Tibetandialect from which Monguor borrowed its Tibetan loanwords, Old Tibetan tsh >Middle Tibetan s, as in OldTibetan tsha-mo \"niece\" > Monguor samo, Old Tibetan tshon-pa \"merchant\" > Monguor sonwa, OldTibetan tshe-rin \"long life\" > Monguor seran, Old Tibetan tsha-tsha \"good luck charm\" > Monguor sasa.Similar dialectal unstopping is found as well in the archaic manuscript material from Central Asia: in onemanuscript we consistently find <tham-sad>for Old Tibetan thams-tsad \"all\" and <sem-san>for OldTibetan sems-tsan \"sentient creature\"; in another we consistently find <se>for Old Tibetan rtse \"peak\" and<zug>for Old Tibetan mdzug \"tail.\" Finally, in the classical language itself we find such doublets as rdze-sa~ze-sa \"honorific expression\" and LDZEN~ZEN \"penetrate,\" and such word families as TSUM \"shrink,shudder,\" SUM \"weep, tremble,\" DZUM \"shudder, shrink, contract,\" zum-pa \"fear, dismay.\"Indeed, comparative data allow us to reconstruct Proto-Tibetan affricates that had become unstopped by thetime of Old Tibetan. For example, we find Bahing dza, Nagari dzya, Burmese tsa, Garo tsha \"eat\" but OldTibetan ZA \"eat,\" Karen dzon, Burmese tsi Lisu dzi, Akha dzi \"ride\" but Old Tibetan ZON \"ride an animal,\"Bahing di-dzim, Akha dzim-tsi \"fresh (water),\" Burmese tshim \"delicious,\" but Old Tibetan zim \"good tasting.\"Thus we can reconstruct Proto-Tibetan *dza \"eat\" > Old Tibetan ZA, Proto-Tibetan *dzyon > *dzon \"ride\" >Old Tibetan ZON, and Proto-Tibetan *dzyim > dzim \"good tasting\" > Old Tibetan zim. < previous pagepage_60next page >"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"page_61file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_61.html[8/7/2010 9:52:35 PM]< previous pagepage_61next page >Page 61Actually, the term VOICE refers to the state of the glottis: the vocal cords may either be touching along their entirelength, so that air passing between them causes regular vibrations; or else they may be separated, so that suchregular vibrations do not occur. The term ASPIRATION does not refer to some phenomenon distinct from voice;rather the term refers to a period of voicelessness during and after the release of an articulation. Instead of viewingvoice and aspiration as two independently varying phenomena, it makes more sense, as far as Old Tibetan isconcerned, to view the consonants as lying along the single multivalued dimension of VOICE ONSET TIME.For example, at a particular moment, the two articulators of a stop consonantthe two lips, or the tongue and the topof the front teeth, or the tongue and velummove apart sufficiently to let air pass out through the mouth. The vocalcords may begin vibrating BEFORE this release of closure, SIMULTANEOUSLY with the release, or some timeAFTER the release: in the first case we have a VOICED stop, in the second a VOICELESS stop, and in the thirdan ASPIRATED stop.5Thus Old Tibetan distinguishes, in the timing of onset of voice, the VOICED consonants g d, b, d, dz, z, n, ñ, n,m, y, r, l, and w from the VOICELESS consonants k, t, p, t, ts, , and s, and from the ASPIRATED consonants kh,th, ph, th, and tsh. Note that the glottal stop and glottal fricative h do not have any value for voice onset time,since they are articulated by the glottis itself.Note too that only STOPPED consonantsthat is, stops and affricatescan be5 Similarly, a fricative may be accompanied by vibration of the vocal cords from the start of itsarticulation; or the vibration may begin at the moment the articulators separate to form a following vowel;or the vibration may begin some time after the articulators have separated. Here again we have a VOICED,VOICELESS, and ASPIRATED fricative, respectively.The timing of the onset of this vibration in milliseconds varies from language to language: different languageschoose different points along this continuum in forming oppositions among consonants, just as languageschoose different numbers of oppositions to form. Old Tibetan makes a three-way distinction among stoppednon-nasal consonants, but only a twoway distinction among fricatives; New Tibetan (Lhasa) makes only a two-way distinction among stopped non-nasal consonants, and has only voiceless fricatives. English and NewTibetan (Lhasa) both make a two-way distinction between more-voiced and less-voiced stopped non-nasalconsonants; but the more-voiced consonants in English are voiced prior to release, and the more-voicedconsonants in Lhasa city are voiced only at release. < previous pagepage_61next page >"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"page_62file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_62.html[8/7/2010 9:52:36 PM]< previous pagepage_62next page >Page 62aspirated: fricatives may be voiced or voiceless, but Old Tibetan apparently had no phonemes of the form ?sh or?sh.6We can express this asymmetry as a second phoneme structure constraint:RULE 2 All aspirated consonants must be stopped consonants.This rule then constitutes a derivational constraint on the inflectional process of UNSTOPPING: when theinflectional rule operates on the aspirated affricates TSH and TSH, it yields the aspirated fricatives ?sh and ?sh,which, under Rule 2, immediately become the corresponding affricates tsh and tsh.Morphologically, in Old Tibetan we find a strong tendency to voice dissimilation: that is, where a stopped initial ina verb root is preceded by an inflectional prefix, and the resulting stem must be adjusted to conform with syllablestructure constraints, the root initial is adjusted to a form where its voice onset time is as DISSIMILAR as possibleto the voice onset time of the prefix. For example, we find Nthor < N-TOR \"scatters,\" Nkhrol < N-KROL \"rings,\"Ntsho < N-TSO \"nourishes.\" Indeed, this tendency is sufficiently strong that, in the case of the past tense b- prefix,it operates even on syllables that are otherwise acceptable-for example, bkrol < b-GROL-s ''rang,\" btins < bDIN-s\"scattered,\" btsugs < b-DZUG-s ''pierced.\"1.2.4. NasalityA NASAL phoneme is produced with a lowered velum, or soft palate, allowing air to pass out through the nose; anon-nasal or ORAL phoneme is produced with the velum raised to form a velic closure in the upper pharynx,blocking the passage of air to the nose. In a nasal stop the articulators block the mouth entirely until release, whileair flows out through the nose; it is because of this air flow, with the mouth acting as a variously shaped resonatingchamber, that nasals share with approximants the acoustic property often called SONORANCE. In Old Tibetan, thevelar, palatal, dental, and labial places of articulation each has a corresponding nasal stopthe VELAR NASAL n,the6 In addition, nasals and glides were apparently all voiced in Old Tibetan, which is, of course, not at allunusual: voiceless sonorants are relatively rare in the languages of the world.

Prenasalization is an important inflectional process in OldTibetan, marking the present stem of a large number of verbsfor example, Nkhum < N-KHUM \"shrinks,\" asopposed to khums < KHUM-s \"shrank,\" Ndud < N-DUD \"bends,\" as opposed to btud < b-DUD-s \"bent,\" N-thub <N-TUB \"chops,'' as opposed to btubs < BTUB-S ''chopped.\"2. Acoustic DescriptionsThe descriptions given so far exhaustively characterize the phonemes of Old Tibetan: thus the phoneme e iscompletely characterized as the Old Tibetan LOW FRONT VOWEL (since we know, from Rule 1, that it isSPREAD as well); and the phoneme dz is completely characterized as the Old Tibetan VOICED DENTALAFFRICATE. Some morphophonemic rules in Tibetan, however, require acoustic as well as such articulatorydescriptions: some sound changes seem to be conditioned not by the position and movement of the articulatoryorgans but rather by the auditory properties of the sounds themselves.2.1. GravityIt can be observed that there are considerable similarities between sounds made in the back of the mouth andsounds made in the front of the mouth, as opposed to sounds made with some part of the tongue raised in the7 Vowels, of course, can also be NASALIZEDthat is, articulated with a lowered velum so that air passesout through both nose and mouth. There is little evidence that Old Tibetan had nasalized vowels, but, insome dialects of New Tibetan, many Old Tibetan syllables with final nasal stops have become syllableswith nasalized vowelsfor example, Old Tibetan yon-tan \"virtue\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) , Old Tibetanmtshan \"name\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) , Old Tibetan snam-bu \"woolen cloth\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) , Old Tibetan tshan \"beer\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) tshaN. In other words, in such syllables, thesyllable-final tongue or lip gesture has ceased to be made, but the lowering of the velum has continued. < previous pagepage_63next page >"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"page_64file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_64.html[8/7/2010 9:52:37 PM]< previous pagepage_64next page >Page 64middle of the mouth.8 It is easy to see that both velar and labial sounds are produced with the mouth acting as asingle large resonating chamber, while dental and fricative sounds are produced with the tongue dividing the mouthinto two smaller chambers. Sounds made with a constriction at either end of the mouth have most of their acousticenergy at a lower pitch than corresponding sounds made in the middle of the mouth: hence we find that k and pactually sound more alike than do p and t. Velar and labial consonants, based on this acoustic phenomenon, arecalled GRAVE, and dental and labial consonants are called ACUTE.This acoustic description cuts across the articulatory description of place and allows us to express some commondissimilation patterns in Old Tibetan. For example, preinitial g- and d- are in complementary distribution: the gravepreinitial g- occurs only before acute initial consonants; the acute preinitial d- occurs only before grave initialconsonants. Similarly, the acute postfinal -s occurs only after grave final consonants; the Old Tibetan acute presentstem inflectional suffix -D disappears after acute final consonants and appears as the acute allomorph -s only aftergrave finals. This process of GRAVITY DISSIMILATION is characteristic of the classical language.2.2. SonoranceIn many languages, nasals and glides form a group with the vowels.9 Nasals, glides and vowels are acousticallySONORANT, as opposed to other stops, affricates and fricatives, which are called OBSTRUENT. The acousticdescription cuts across the articulatory descriptions of closure and nasality, just as acoustic gravity cuts acrossarticulatory descriptions of place.Sonorants have in common a resonant quality that arises from their having8 For example, note how the velar fricative in *kox \"cough\" (compare Old English cohhetan \"shout,\"Middle Low German kuchen \"cough,'' Middle High German kuchen \"exhale\") becomes a bilabial fricativein <cough>. Note, too, that a ventriloquist will substitute velar consonants for the labial consonants hecannot make because his lips would move.9 In English, for example, nasals and glides are syllabicjust like vowelsafter a stop or fricative, as in such two-syllable words as prizm <prism>, hindr <hinder>,<sudden>, or teybl <table>. < previous pagepage_64next page >"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"page_65file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_65.html[8/7/2010 9:52:38 PM]< previous pagepage_65next page >Page 65a relatively large amount of acoustic energy within a clearly defined overtone structure. In other words, thesonorants are \"tone-like\" sounds, while the obstruents are \"noise-like\" sounds. Thus, too, sonorants are normallyvoiced sounds; voiceless nasals, for example, are quite rare in the world's languages compared to voiced nasals.10Tibetan syllable codas are either sonorant or obstruent. The sonorance of the coda has morphophonological effectson some following particles: in several cases, the initial of a particle is voiced after preceding sonorants andvoiceless after preceding obstruents. For example, the coordinative conjunction -TSin \"AND\" takes the voiced form-zin after preceding sonorant finals, but takes the unvoiced form -tsin and -sin after preceding obstruent finals.Similarly,< previous pagepage_65next page >"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"page_66file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_66.html[8/7/2010 9:52:39 PM]< previous pagepage_66next page >Page 66FRONT BACKSpread RoundHIGHiuLOWeaoTable 4.

But we can do little more at this time than make sporadic hypotheses about the nature of thesedifferences, and the discussion here will center on the structure of the syllable in Old Tibetan. This structure isdefined by specific constraints on possible syllables. These constraints are of three sortslength constraints, slot-filler constraints, and co-occurrence constraints. LENGTH CONSTRAINTS define the number of phoneme slotsavailable in the syllable; SLOT-FILLER CONSTRAINTS define what phonemes may occur in each slot; CO-OCCURRENCE CONSTRAINTS define what phonemes in one slot can occur together with other phonemes inother slots.1. Length ConstraintsThe Tibetan syllable consists of three partsONSET, NUCLEUS, and CODA. The nucleus of the syllable in OldTibetan is always a single vowel.1 The minimum1 While in Old Tibetan the syllabic nucleus always contains a single vowel, it seems we must recognizetwo COMPLEX NUCLEI in some Proto-Tibetan syllables, both of which had simplified into single vowelsby the time the language was written down. Thus in many cases where we find a classical Tibetan o wemust reconstruct a Proto-Tibetan nucleus we will write conventionally as *ua, and in many cases where wefind a classical Tibetan e we must reconstruct a Proto-Tibetan nucleus we will write conventionally as *ia.This convention is used to indicate that the syllable contains a complex nucleus rather than an onset clusterwith a postinitial glide.

The historical change from Old to Middle toNew Tibetan is characterized in part by a tendency to reduce the length of syllables from the maximum ccccvcc orccccvv syllables of Old Tibetan to the maximum cvc or cvv syllables of many New Tibetan dialects. Table 6 on thefollowing page summarizes the possible syllable lengths in the classical language.Two special cases are not included in the schematization. First, there are occasionally coda clusters of Two vowelswhen a syllable with the lexical form -w (invariably a diminutive such as beu \"calf\" or byeu \"little bird\") occurswith the adnominal particle, as in beui ''of the calf,\" or before the statement particle, as in beuo \"(It is) the calf.''(Note also the onomatopoietic meao(footnote continued from previous page)Western Tibetan dialects seem to have preserved Proto-Tibetan *ia where in Old Tibetan and other NewTibetan dialects Proto-Tibetan *ia has undergone change.

On the other hand, we might add, English is much richerthan classical Tibetan in coda clusters: the maximum coda cluster consists of four consonants, such as ksts in<texts>, in <twelfths>, mpst in <glimpsed>, or in <sixths>. < previous pagepage_70next page >"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"page_71file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_71.html[8/7/2010 9:52:42 PM]< previous pagepage_71next page >Page 71\"SOUND OF A CAT.\") A coda cluster of THREE vowels is possiblebut not often encounteredwhen such a syllableoccurs both with the adnominal particle and before the statement particle, as in spreuio \"(It is) the monkey's.\"Second, diphthongs in closed syllables are produced by two syntactic processes.

Slot-Filler ConstraintsSlot-filler constraints prescribe which phonemes can occur in particular positions in the syllable. Indeed, we havealready mentioned one such slot-filler constraintthe rule that the NUCLEUS of the syllable is always filled with avowel.The ONSET of the syllable consists of four slots, each of which may either be filled with a single consonant or leftemptythat is, filled with zero. We will call these four slots, from left to right, the PRE-PREINITIAL,PREINITIAL, INITIAL, < previous pagepage_71next page >"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"page_72file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_72.html[8/7/2010 9:52:43 PM]< previous pagepage_72next page >Page 72and POSTINITIAL slots.3 The fillers of these slots are as follows.(1)When there is only one consonant in the onset, that consonant is in the INITIAL slot. The initial slot maybe filled by any consonant except, of course, the phoneme of nasalization N. Thus in the syllable bod the initial slotis filled by b, and in the syllable thabs the initial slot is filled by th.(2)When the initial slot has been filled, the POSTINITIAL slot may also be filled. The postinitial slot can befilled ONLY by the glides r and y.4 Thus in the syllable grub the initial slot is filled by g and the postinitial slot byr, and in the syllable byid the initial slot is filled by b and the postinitial slot by y.53 We must be careful, of course, not to confuse these PHONOLOGICAL slots, and the phonemes that canfill them, with the GRAPHIC slots 1 through 4 discussed above. It is true, for example, that theINITIALwhen there is oneis always in the center graph position, and that the PRE-PREINITIALwhen thereis oneis always in the left graph position. But after that, as we shall see, identification becomes less easy.4 This statement is controversial, and will require some justification, which will be supplied in the followingsection.5 An onset cluster of stop plus glide may in some cases be unambiguously processed as an initial stop pluspostinitial glide: for example, in khrag \"blood\" orphyag \"hand\" the glide cannot be the initial because theaspirated stops kh and ph cannot, under the syllable slot-filler constraints, be preinitials; in skra \"hair\" or dpya\"tax'' the glide cannot be the initial because the stops k and p cannot, under the syllable slot-filler constraints,be preinitials, and because the consonants s and d cannot, under the syllable slot-filler constraints, beprepreinitials.However, where the glide is preceded by a single consonant which could be either an initial or a preinitial,such as g or b, it follows that the glide could in turn be either a postinitial or an initial: for example, the formgyan mightwithout further informationbe processed either as a preinitial g followed by initial y or as an initialg followed by postinitial y.Now the Tibetan writing system distinguishes these two cases with regard to g and y. An initial y is written asa CENTER graph, with preinitial g as a LEFT graph; an initial g is written as a CENTER graph, withpostinitial y as a BOTTOM graph. But the writing system does not make similar distinctions with regard to theother glides: when preceded by another consonant, the glides r, l, and w are always written as bottom graphs,and it is easily assumed that they are therefore all postinitials. That is not necessarily the case.( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_72next page >"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"page_73file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_73.html[8/7/2010 9:52:44 PM]< previous pagepage_73next page >Page 73(3)When the initial slot has been filled, the PREINITIAL slot may also be filled. The preinitial slot can befilled by r, l s, g d, b, m, and N. Thus in the syllable bde the initial slot is filled by d and the preinitial slot by b, andin the syllable rgyu the initial slot is filled by g the postinitial slot by y, and the preinitial slot by r.(4)When the preinitial slot has been filled by a NONSTOPPED consonant r, l, or s (note that this is actually aco-occurrence constraint), the PREPREINITIAL slot may also be filled. The pre-preinitial slot can be filled ONLYby b. Thus in the syllable blta the initial slot is filled by t, the preinitial slot by , and the pre-preinitial slot by b.The CODA of the syllable consists of two slots. We will call these slots, from left to right, the FINAL andPOSTFINAL slots.(1)The FINAL slot may be filled with a single vowel (with the additional provisions discussed above), by asingle consonant, or left emptythat is, filled by zero. The final slot may be filled by the consonants d, n,( footnote continued from previous page)We will here use the following convention: a preinitial consonant will be separated from a following initialglide by a dot (thus g.yan \"blessing\"), and an initial consonant followed by a postinitial glide will be leftunmarked (thus gyan \"baked brick\").Why does this distinction matter? Historical changes occur differently to initials and postinitialsfor example,Old Tibetan g.yan \"blessing\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) yan, but Old Tibetan GYON \"get dressed\" > New Tibetan(Lhasa) chöN, Old Tibetan g.yu \"turquoise'' > New Tibetan (Lhasa) yu, but Old Tibetan gyad \"athlete\" > NewTibetan (Lhasa) , Old Tibetan g.yon \"left side'' > New Tibetan (Lhasa) yöN, but Old Tibetan gyos-po \"father-in-law\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) chöpo. Similar examples can be found with other glidesfor example, OldTibetan g.rogs \"helper\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa), but Old Tibetan grags \"fame\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) tha.Note also classical Tibetan BRI \"write\" but ri-mo \"drawing,\" GRIL \"be rolled up\" but ril-po \"round,\" GRIB\"grow dim\" but rab-rib \"mist, dimness,\" and perhaps even S-BRUM \"make pregnant\" < *BRUM \"*bepregnant\" but rum \"womb.\"The same distinction may extend back into Proto-Tibetan. We can distinguish, for example, between Proto-Tibetan *s.la \"thin\" > Old Tibetan s.la >New Tibetan (Lhasa) la and ProtoTibetan *sle \"tongue\" > Old Tibetanltse > New Tibetan (Lhasa) tse. Similarly, given Bunan goa-gwa, Chamba Lahuli gua, and perhaps even OldChinese *ghwo \"fox,\" we can propose Proto-Tibetan *g.wa \"fox\" > Old Tibetan wa >New Tibetan (Lhasa) wa,as opposed, for example, to Proto-Tibetan *rwa \"horn\" > Old Tibetan rwa >New Tibetan (Lhasa) ra. < previous pagepage_73next page >"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"page_74file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_74.html[8/7/2010 9:52:44 PM]< previous pagepage_74next page >Page 74r, l, s, g, n, b, and m, or by any vowel. Thus in the syllable bod the final slot is filled by d, and in the syllable gragsthe final slot is filled byg.(2)When the final slot has been filled by a GRAVE consonant (note that this is a co-occurrence constraint),the POSTFINAL slot may be filled as well. The postfinal slot can be filled ONLY by s, at least in the classicallanguage6 Thus in the syllable thabs the final slot is filled by b and the postfinal slot by s.2.1. Are -l- And -w- Postinitials?When the glide I follows a consonant it is written as a bottom graph and alphabetized in native Tibetan dictionariesas if it were a postinitial; but, with only one exception, the bottom graph <l>does not represent a postinitialfollowing an initial, represented by the center graph, but rather the initial of the syllable, with the center graphrepresenting the preinitial. There are several reasons for reaching this conclusion.Historically, the Tibetan preinitial stops have tended to disappear in several New Tibetan dialects7thus, forexample, Old Tibetan gñid \"sleep\" > New6In Proto-Tibetan, when the final slot of a syllable was filled by an ACUTE consonant n, r, or l thepostfinal slot could be filled by d. This postfinal dcalled da-drag \"strong d\" by the Tibetan grammarianswasapparently a phonologically conditioned allomorph of postfinal s. Postfinal d had two sourcesan inflectionalsuffix *-D in the present stem of certain verbs, and an inflectional suffix *-s in the past stem of all verbs.These suffixes will be discussed in the section on morphology.7 This is a simple statement of a complex phenomenon. First, nothing ever disappears without a trace, whichis, I suppose, a comforting thought; in particular, preinitials which have apparently disappeared may bearticulated after preceding open syllables in the same stress group-for example, Old Tibetan bzi \"four\" > NewTibetan (Lhasa) si but Old Tibetan btsu-bzi \"fourteen\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) tsüpsi Old Tibetan gsum \"three\"> New Tibetan (Lhasa) sum but Old Tibetan btsu-gsum \"thirteen\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) tsoksom, Old Tibetanmdun \"front part'' > New Tibetan (Lhasa) tüN but Old Tibetan skumdun ''presence\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa)kuNtüN, Old Tibetan Ndra \"similar\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) ta but Old Tibetan sku-Ndra \"statue\" > NewTibetan (Lhasa) kumta, Old Tibetan mtshan \"sign\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) but Old Tibetan rgyu-mtshan\"reason\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) .(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_74next page >"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"page_75file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_75.html[8/7/2010 9:52:45 PM]< previous pagepage_75next page >Page 75Tibetan (Ladakh) ñit (Lhasa) ñi, Old Tibetan dge \"virtue\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) ge (Lhasa) ke, Old Tibetan bde\"joy\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) rde (Lhasa) te, Old Tibetan dmag-dpon \"army commander\" > New Tibetan(Ladakh) makspon (Lhasa) makpöN. Postinitial glides, on the other hand, have tended to affect the place ofarticulation of the preceding initial-for example, Old Tibetan sran-ma \"peas'' > New Tibetan (Ladakh) sanma(footnote continued from previous page)Second, two different processes seem to have been at work simultaneously on Tibetan preinitials,sometimes moving the syllable in different directions. On the one hand, the preinitials tend to WEAKENover time: that is, the degree of closure in articulating the preinitial decreases; stopped preinitials becomenarrowed, narrowed preinitials become open, and open preinitials disappearthus, over time, and at differentspeeds in different parts of the lexicon, stops > fricatives > glides > Ø. We can note this process at work inOld Tibetan gsum \"three > New Tibetan (Golok) ysum (Panakha) rsum (Lhasa) sum, Old Tibetan bdun\"seven\" > New Tibetan (Balti) bdun (Khams) vdun (Purik) rdun (Dbus) dün, Old Tibetan btsu \"ten\" > NewTibetan (Khams) rtsu (Purik) stsu (Golog) wtsu (Lhasa) tsu. Note too such pronunciations as New Tibetan(Dbus) kurdap <sku-gdab>\"fall,\" tsurgu <btsu-dgu>\"nineteen,'' derge <sde-dge>\"Derge City,\" and suchdoublets in the classical texts as dkan-rkan \"palate,\" dgu~rgu \"nine,\" gdu-gu~ldu-gu \"bracelet,\"BDAR~RDAR \"rub,\" sdor-rdor \"spice,\" STUN~RTUN \"make shorter\"; even Old Tibetan sdon New Tibetan(Tao-fu) ston (Balti) zdon \"tree trunk\" was borrowed into Monguor from an unknown Tibetan dialect asrdon.On the other hand, the preinitialsparticularly nonstopped preinitialstend to ASSIMILATE to the followinginitial: that is, over time, and at different speeds in different parts of the lexicon, voiced preinitials tend tobecome voiceless before voiceless initials, and voiceless preinitials tend to become voiced before voicedinitials. We can note this process at work in Old Tibetan rta \"horse\" > New Tibetan (Panakha) sta (Ladakh) sta(Balti) sta-sta (Amdo) rta~sta, Old Tibetan sga \"saddle\" > New Tibetan (Golok) rga (Balti) zga (Purik) zga(Amdo) rga, Old Tibetan rkan \"foot\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) skan (Golok) skan (Amdo) xkan.Both of these processes are \"natural,\" in the sense that they are found operating not only in Tibetan but in avariety of other languages. Sometimes the two processes affecting the preinitialsweakening and assimilation-are in conflict. In Panakha, for example, we find that Old Tibetan sna \"nose\" > New Tibetan (Panakha) rnaboth by weakening of the preinitial and by assimilation of the voice onset time of the preinitial to that of theinitial. But we find, too, both that Old Tibetan rta \"horse\" > New Tibetan (Panakha) sta, where the tendency toassimilate predominates over the tendency for preinitials to weaken, and that Old Tibetan sku \"body\" > NewTibetan (Panakha) rku, where the tendency to weaken predominates over the tendency for preinitials toassimilate in voice onset time to initials.

In every case, the stop preceding an I in an onset cluster behaves like a preinitial withregard to prenasalizationthus Ngrub but not ?Nglub, Nbyo but not ?Nblo, Ngye but not ?Ngle.Second, initial stops are constrained by the rule of gravity dissimilation in the selection of preinitials but not in theselection of postinitialsthus, for example, we find both gro and dro, but only gso and not ?dso, and only dpe andnot ?gpe.

In every case, the l in an onset cluster behaves like an initial rather than apostinitial in this regardthus khyu and khru but not ?khlu, phya and phra but not ?phla.9There is, however, one case in which l appears to be a postinitial rather than an initialin the initial cluster zl, whichin turn behaves historically in surprising ways.10 First of all, we find such curious classical Tibetan doublets aszlum-ldum \"round,\" ZLOG-LDOG \"turn away,\" ZLA-NDA \"pass,\" ZLO-NDO ''recite,\" ZLAG-LDAG-NDAG ''lick.\"Further, we may note the unexpected New8 The initial cluster bkl- is found (parallel to bky-and bkr-)sporadically in the past and future stems of theverb KLAG (klog/klags-bklags/klag-bklag/klog)\"read,\" but these seem to be late and analogous forms; thereis no corresponding inflectional cluster bgl- in such verbs as GLEB (gleb/glebs/gleb)\"flatten\" or GLAN(glon/glan/glan)\"mend, patch up.\"9 A difficulty for this analysis is raised by the onset cluster kl- found in a few common words such as klu\"serpent deity\" and klon \"expanse.\" The consonant k- (as opposed, for example, to the consonant g-) cannot bea preinitial, so it is hard to see how the l in the cluster could be the initial. However, the l certainly behaveshistorically like an initial: we find Old Tibetan klu \"serpent deity\" > New Tibetan (Lhasa) lu. In fact, in theSino-Tibetan treaty inscription of 821, Tibetan klu is transcribed both as Middle Chinese *kyu-lyap,representing an initial kl- cluster, and as Middle Chinese , indicating that, as early as the ninth century, inthe speech of at least some urban government officials, Proto-Tibetan *klu had already become Old Tibetan(Lhasa) *lu <klu>. I do not know how to resolve this difficulty.10 Note that it is only in zl- and not in sl- that the l appears to be postinitial; the slcluster behaves just likeother clusters with initial lforexample, Old Tibetan slob-dpon \"teacher\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) loppon(Lhasa) lopöN, Old Tibetan SLEB \"reach\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) lep (Lhasa) lep.

We candiagram these changes as follows:This process apparently extends all the way back to Proto-Tibetan. For example, we find the classical Tibetandoublet ldzi-ba~Ndzi-ba \"flea.\" On the basis of forms in other Tibeto-Burman languages, such as Nung sali Karen Mikir tsikli, Lushei hli, and Burmese hle \"flea,\" we can hypothesize a Proto-Tibetan *zli \"flea\" >Old Tibetan ldzi > Ndzi, with the intermediate steps *zli > *lzi > *ldi > *ldyi > ldzi > Ndzi1111 This sequence suggests that postinitial l is not found in Old Tibetan in clusters other than zl becauseeverywhere else an originally postinitial l had already metathesized in ProtoTibetan to preinitial L In otherwords, at some time before our first written texts, ProtoTibetan *Cl > *lC everywhere but in the cluster zl.(Postinitial r, as we will see, more sporadically did the same thing-for example, Burmese mran, Proto-Tibetan *mran >Old Tibetan rman \"horse,\" Burmese khran, Proto-Tibetan *kran >Old Tibetan rkan\"bone.\") This wave of change had not yet reached zl by the time the spelling of the cluster was fixed in OldTibetan; but, as we have hypothesized, the change zl > /z eventually overtook the cluster zl as well.

Even where the sequence lda > Nda is not attested in thetexts, there is evidence for the change in some New Tibetan dialects, where we find, for example, New Tibetan(Lhasa) <Nbras-ldzons>''Sikkim,\" <phyag-lde> \"key,'' <sku-zla>\"spouse,\" <khyi-zla>\"dogmonth.\"Another apparent exception to the slot-filler constraint that only the glides y and r occur postinitially is theoccasional appearance in classical Tibetan wordssuch as zwa \"hat\"of <w>written as a bottom graph, called wa-zur\"corner w\" by the Tibetan grammarians. This orthographic convention apparently distinguishes such pairs of wordsas ña \"fish\" ñwa \"leg muscle,\" rtsa \"root\" rtswa \"grass,\" ZA \"eat\" zwa \"nettle,\" ra \"sheepfold\" rwa \"horn,\" la\"mountain pass\" lwa \"woolen blanket,\" sa \"flesh\" swa \"deer,\" and TSHA \"be hot\" tshwa \"salt.\" But, at least afterthe ninth century, it is difficult to say what phonetic feature-if any at allis reflected by this orthography.12 We findoccasional classical doublets such as grwa~gru \"edge\" and rwa~ru \"horn,\" but with little consistency. Nor doesetymology seem to help our inquiry: a semantic relation between sa \"flesh\" and swa \"deer\" seems apparent;between ra \"sheepfold\" and rwa \"horn,\" or rtsa \"root\" and rtswa \"grass,\" seems possible; but between la \"mountainpass\" and lwa \"woolen blanket\" seems remote at best.This apparent postinitial w occurs only before the nucleus a in classical12 In at least some instances the bottom graph <w>appears to be a purely graphic convention. Inambiguous graphic sequences which represent syllables with the vowel a, where no overt vowel graphmarks the center graph, as in <dgs>or <dns >, a bottom graph <w>will be used to indicate the centergraphfor example, dags <dwags>as opposed to dgas or dans <dwans>as opposed to dnas. < previous pagepage_79next page >"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"page_80file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_80.html[8/7/2010 9:52:49 PM]< previous pagepage_80next page >Page 80Tibetan. This skewed distributionthat is, occurrence only before a back spread vowelcan be accounted forhistorically. First, postinitial w does not seem to occur before rounded vowels in any Tibeto-Burman language, andtherefore presumably did not occur before rounded vowels in Proto-TibetoBurman; thus Tibetan would not haveinherited any sequences of the form -wo or -wu. Second, where postinitial w occurs before front vowels in otherTibeto-Burman languages, we find postinitial y in Tibetanfor example, Burmese pwe, Lushei bui but Old Tibetanbyi \"rat,\" Burmese khwe, Lushei ui Kanauri kui, Chepang kwi, Kachin gui, Akha akui but Old Tibetan khyi \"dog,\"Burmese kywe, Trung gui, Chepang goy, but Old Tibetan skyi \"edible root.\" Thus we may hypothesize that Proto-Tibetan *bwi >Old Tibetan byi ''rat,\" Proto-Tibetan *khwi >Old Tibetan khyi ''dog, and Proto-Tibetan *skwi > OldTibetan skyi \"edible root,\" or, more generally, Proto-Tibetan *-w- > Old Tibetan -y- postinitially before a frontvowel; thus Old Tibetan would no longer have any inherited sequences of the form -wi or -we. This would leavepostinitial w only in syllables with the nonrounded nonfront vowel a.In this position, in the ninth century, <w>in the bottom graph position apparently did represent something verymuch like a postinitial w. On the Sino-Tibetan treaty pillar of 821 we find Middle Chinese *kwak transcribed inTibetan writing as <kwag>, Middle Chinese *kwan as <kwan>, Middle Chinese *kuan as <kwan>, MiddleChinese *ywan as <hwan>, Middle Chinese as <Ngwan>, and Middle Chinese as <ywen>. Otherexamples are found in ninth-century manuscript transcriptions of Chinese Buddhist texts, where we find MiddleChinese *thuai transcribed as <thwa>, Middle Chinese as <tswan>, Middle Chinese *nuai as <Ngwe>, andMiddle Chinese *zwi as <swi>.The wa-zur continues to be written in what appears to be onomatopoeia as well.

These changes are natural ones, and the hypothesis wouldaccount for two thingsthe fact that Old Tibetan has palatal affricates and fricatives; and the fact that, in Old Tibetan,the consonants that had undergone this change in Proto-Tibetan are precisely the ones that now can no longer bepalatalized.14There is some evidence to support this hypothesis. For example, we find Burmese si, Vayu ses, Phunoi , Akha si,Mpi , Garo masi \"know,\" and we can hypothesize a Proto-Tibetan *ses > *syes >Old Tibetan SES \"know.\"Similarly, we find Burmese sa, Phunoi sa, Bisu , Mpi , as well as14The hypothesized changes are \"natural\" ones in two senses. First, a change from a palatalized dental to apalatal affricate or fricative is not uncommonly found in a variety of languages. Second, the hypothesizedchange seems to have continued into modern times, spreading from the dentals and velar nasals into thevelars and labialsfor example, Old Tibetan brgya \"hundred\" > New Tibetan (Golok) dzya (Dbus) dza(Lhasa) ca Old Tibetan rgyal-po \"king\" > New Tibetan (Amdo) dzyawu (Dbus) dzepo (Lhasa) , OldTibetan khyi ''dog\" > New Tibetan (Amdo) (Dbus) tshi (Lhasa) chi, Old Tibetan khyod ''you\" > NewTibetan (Amdo) tsho (Golok) tshyo (Dbus) tshö (Lhasa) chö, Old Tibetan bya \"bird\" > New Tibetan(Amdo) sa (Golok) fsya (Dbus) tsa (Lhasa) tsha, Old Tibetan phyogs \"side\" > (Amdo) sog (Ltao) pso(Dbus) tsho (Lhasa) tsho, Old Tibetan phyug-po \"rich\" > New Tibetan (Derge) sukpa (Ltao) psöpa (Dbus)tshukpo (Lhasa) tshukpu. Of course, this development of palatal consonants-stops (c, ch), fricatives (s, fs),and affricates (ps, ts, tsh)does not occur in the same way in each dialect, or, indeed, in every word in eachdialect. For example, in Amdo we find Old Tibetan khyi \"dog\" > New Tibetan (Amdo) but Old Tibetankhyim \"house\" > New Tibetan (Amdo) khyüm, Old Tibetan rgyal-po \"king\" > New Tibetan (Amdo) dzyawubut Old Tibetan brgya \"hundred\" > New Tibetan (Amdo) rgya. In Ladakh, palatalized labials have,generally, become palatal affricates, but palatalized velars have not; we find Old Tibetan phyogs \"side\" >New Tibetan (Ladakh) tshoks but Old Tibetan khyim \"house\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) khyim, Old Tibetanspyod \"action\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) tsot but Old Tibetan skyems \"libation\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh)skyems, Old Tibetan byan \"north\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) tsan but Old Tibetan rgyan \"ornament\" > NewTibetan (Ladakh) rgyan-yet compare Old Tibetan sbyin \"gift\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) tsin with OldTibetan phyi \"outside\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh)phi Despite all this, the tendency remains clear, andpalatalization has continued to spread both phonologically and, apparently, lexically. < previous pagepage_82next page >"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"page_83file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_83.html[8/7/2010 9:52:51 PM]< previous pagepage_83next page >Page 83Bahing sye, Sangpang sya, Kanauri sya, Magari misia, Nung sa, Lushei sa \"meat,\" and we can hypothesize aProto-Tibetan *sya >Old Tibetan sa \"meat.\" Similar hypotheses can be made for some nasalsfor example, Burmesena, Lisu nwa, Akha na, Mpi no, Lepcha no, Tsangla na, Kachin na, Lushei hna, Bodo na-na, Chepang na-ña ''fish,\"and thus Proto-Tibetan *nya >Old Tibetan ña \"fish,'' and Burmese hna, Lisu nwa, Akha na, Nung na \"borrow,\" andthus Proto-Tibetan *nya > *r-nya > *b-rnya >Old Tibetan BRNA \"borrow.\"Similarly, given Burmese tshi, Nung tsi, Kachin dzit, Dimasa si-di (di \"water\"), Lahu dzi \"urine,\" we canhypothesize Proto-Tibetan *tsi > *g-tsi > *gtsyi >Old Tibetan GTSI \"urinate\"; given Burmese tshit, Lisu tshi, Akhatsui \"pinch,\" we can perhaps hypothesize Proto-Tibetan *tshir > *tshyir >Old Tibetan TSHIR \"squeeze\"; givenBurmese swan \"pour out,\" Garo sol-an, Dimasa di-sor (di \"water\"), Kachin son \"flow,\" Lepcha tshor \"the pouringof water,\" we can hypothesize Proto-Tibetan *tsyuar >Old Tibetan TSOR \"overflow.\"There are also a few examples that allow us to hypothesize Proto-Tibetan palatalized dental stops.

Postinitial -r-The distribution of postinitial r is more complex than that of postinitial y. Postinitial r is found only in the clusterskr, khr, gr, dr, pr, phr, br, and sr.

In either case, theprocess was not regular: under the first hypothesis we would expect to find *mtshe instead of the actual mthe\"thumb\"; under the second hypothesis we would expect to find *SKYEB instead of the actual SKYAB \"protect.\"In either case, the nature of the derivational process is not clear, and the process itself apparently no longerproductive by the time of Old Tibetan. < previous pagepage_84next page >"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"page_85file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_85.html[8/7/2010 9:52:52 PM]< previous pagepage_85next page >Page 85general, postinitial r does not occur after nasals, and has all but disappeared after fricatives.16Actually, postinitial r is in fact found after the nasals n and m, but very infrequently.

The cluster snr occurs in theastronomical terms snron and snrubs, which are translation of the Sanskrit names of twojyestha and mulaof the 28naksatra \"lunar mansions\" of Vedic astronomy, and which are not commonly found even in Tibetan astronomicaltexts; and in the word snrel-gzi \"topsy-turvy,\" a translation of Sanskrit vyatyasta, the name of one of thesubcontinents in Indian Buddhist speculative geography.

Disyllabic Stress GroupsA striking feature in the development of Tibetan has been an increasing tendency toward DISYLLABISM in wordformation: there has developed considerable analogic pressure in the language for wordsand even commoncollocations of wordsto constitute a single DISYLLABIC STRESS GROUP, usually with the primary stress on thefirst syllable. One result of this tendency was that NONSYLLABIC FORMATIVES seem early to have becomeless productive than SYLLABIC FORMATIVES, and what we here call OUTER DERIVATION replaced INNERDERIVATION as a means of creating new words. We thus find cases in the classical language of two words withthe same meaning derived from the same source, but one by inner and one by outer derivationfor example, fromZA \"eat\" both the older monosyllabic zas \"food\" and the later disyllabic za-ma ''food,\" or from NA \"be ill\" both theolder monosyllabic nad \"illness'' and the later disyllabic na-ba \"illness.\"20There are several ways in which new disyllabic stress groups can come to be formed. A syllabic formative addedto an existing monosyllabic word will yield a disyllabic stress groupfor example, mda \"arrow\" mda-pa \"archer,\"RGYAL \"be victorious\" rgyal-po \"king,\" lha \"god\" lha-mo \"goddess.\" Sometimes such syllabic formatives as theseappear in Old Tibetan to have been added to an existing monosyllabic word with no semantic effect at allthat is,without( footnote continued from previous page)thus 209 possible syllable onsets in the classical language, including the smooth vocalic ingress or absenceof consonant onset; five possible syllable nuclei; and 14 possible syllable codas, counting all open syllablesas one. There are thus 14,630 possible syllables in the classical language, only some of which are actuallypaired with meanings. We can thus distinguish between syllables such as bstyur and murg which are noteven potentially Tibetan words, and syllables such as Ngib or dpyogs, which are potentially Tibetan words,but whichfortuitouslyhave not been lexicalized as part of the language.20 There are, in addition, several sources of TRISYLLABISM in the classical texts. Much onomatopoeia inTibetan poetry is trisyllabicfor example, kyu-ru-ru \"CALLING OF BIRDS,\" kho-ro-ro \"BUZZING OFBEES,\" gya-ma-gyu \"RUSHING OF A RIVER,\" sun-se-sun \"MOTION OF A MOVING HORSE.\" There arealso a few disyllabic formatives which yield trisyllablesfor example, -PHO-tshe \"BIG KIND OF,\" as in me\"fire\" me-bo-tshe \"conflagration,\" or -E-pa \"ADJECTIVE,\" as in GUG \"bend\" gug-ge-ba \"bent.\" Andtrisyllables are produced when monosyllabic formatives are added to existing disyllablesfor example, gtser-bu\"naked\" gtser-bupa \"naked ascetic,\" dge-slon \"monk\" dge-slon-ma \"nun.\" < previous pagepage_90next page >"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"page_91file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_91.html[8/7/2010 9:52:58 PM]< previous pagepage_91next page >Page 91changing meaningbut apparently only to form a disyllabic stress group.21Similarly, a disyllabic stress group may be formed by the juxtaposition of two monosyllabic words. Sometimes thisjuxtaposition creates a COMPOUND, which is a new stress group with a new meaningfor example, gtam \"speech\"dpe \"pattern, model\" gtam-dpe \"proverb,\" mgo \"head\" SKOR ''encircle'' mgo-SKOR \"deceive,\" sans < -TSAN-S\"awakened\" rgyas < -RGYA-S \"expanded\" sansrgyas \"Buddha.\" But, again, sometimes such a juxtaposition issimply a combination of two synonymous monosyllables to form disyllable with no discernible change ofmeaningfor example, dri \"scent\" bsun \"scent\" dri-bsun \"scent,\" sugs \"strength\" stobs \"strength\" sugs-stobs\"strength,\" sgra \"sound, voice\" skad \"sound, voice\" sgra-skad \"sound, voice.\"Finally, a disyllabic stress group may be formed by the reduction of polysyllabic words and collocations of wordsto disyllabic stress groups by the omission of unstressed syllables. Once again, this reduction may produce acompound, a disyllabic stress group sufficiently different from the sum of its components to be a new word-forexample, glan \"ox\" tshen-po \"big\" glantshen \"elephant,\" skye-ba \"birth\" dman-po \"low\" skye-dman \"woman,\" rin-po \"long\" thun-ba \"short\" rin-thun \"length.\" Or the reduction may produce a21 For example, we find Burmese wak; Lushei vok; Mpi wa, Phunoi voa, Newari phe, Kachin , Mikirphak, and thus Proto-Tibetan *phag >Old Tibetan phag-pa \"pig\"; Burmese la, Nung , Bahing la, Phunoi , Bisu hla, Digaro , and thus Proto-Tibetan *zla >Old Tibetan zla-ba \"moon\"; Burmese ne, Lushei ni,Kachin ni, Kanauri ni, Newari ni, Garo ni, Karen ni, Nung ni, and thus Proto-Tibetan *ni > *nyi > *ñi >Old Tibetan ñima \"sun\"; Burmese nui Lushei nu, Lolo no, and thus Proto-Tibetan *nu >Old Tibetan numa\"breast\"; Burmese aphui Kachin phu, Garo bu, Mikir phu, Lushei pu, and thus ProtoTibetan *phu >OldTibetan phu-bo \"older brother\"; Burmese asan, Lushei tin, Gurung siN, Siyin tsin, Dhimal sin, Miju msen,and thus Proto-Tibetan *sen >Old Tibetan sen-mo \"fingernail.\" It is characteristic of such affixes that theyare easily dropped in compounds or for other primarily rhythmic reasonsfor example, zla-ba \"moon\" but ñi-zla \"sun and moon\" and zla-od \"moonlight,\" sen-mo \"fingernail\" but zabs-sen \"toenail\" and sen-zo \"whitespot on the fingernail.\" As might be expected, the greater the semantic load carried by such an affix, theless easily is it so discarded.Of course, such suffixes are not necessarily pleonastic even where their function is obscure: note, for example,rkan \"marrow\" but rkan-pa \"foot,\" spun \"sibling\" but spun-pa \"chaff,\" gru \"boat\" but gru-mo \"elbow,\" grog-po \"ravine\" but grog-mo \"ant,\" rdog-pa \"step\" but rdog-po \"grain,\" od \"light\" but od-ma \"bamboo\" and od-pa\"flood.\" < previous pagepage_91next page >"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"page_92file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_92.html[8/7/2010 9:52:58 PM]< previous pagepage_92next page >Page 92disyllabic stress group with no apparent change of meaning from its polysyllabic sourcefor example, ston-pa\"empty\" -ñid \"-NESS\" ston-ñid \"emptiness,\" pad-ma ''lotus\" dkar-po \"white'' pad-dkar \"white lotus,\" byantshub\"enlightenment\" sems \"thought\" byan-sems \"thought of enlightenment.\" Such reductions we will call CLIPS.4.1. ClipsCLIPS are frequently encountered in Tibetan. Some clips operate within the boundaries of a single word: thusston-ñid < ston-pa-ñid \"emptiness\" is a WORD CLIP. Some clips operate across word boundaries, but still withina single nominal: thus pan-tshen < pandita tshen-po \"great scholar\" is a NOMINAL CLIP. And some clips operateacross a nominal phrase boundary but still within a larger nominal or verbal phrase: thus byan-sems < byan-tshub-kyi sems \"thought of enlightenment\" is a PHRASE CLIP. What all Tibetan clips have in common is that they donot change meaning: a clipped word or phrase has the same meaning as the word or phrase from which it isderived.4.1.1. Word ClipsWORD CLIPS operate within the boundary of a single word.22 Here we find both polysyllabic words reduced todisyllables and disyllabic words reduced to monosyllables for incorporation into further clips. Thus we find suchdisyllabic word clips as tin-Ndzin < tin-ne-Ndzin \"contemplation,\" ston-ñid < ston-pa-ñid \"emptiness,\" byan-sems< byan-tshub sems-dpa \"bodhisattva,\" legsbsad < legs-par bsad-pa \"aphorism,\" rab-gnas < rab-tu gnas-pa\"consecration,\" bde-gsegs < bde-bar gsegs-pa \"Well-gone One,\" tshigs-btsad < tshigs-su btsad-pa \"poetry,\"myan-Ndas < mya-nan-las Ndas-pa \"nirvana,\" sñin-ñe < sñin-dan ñe-ba \"friend.\"Where a disyllabic word has been reduced to a monosyllable we often find not only the elimination of theunstressed syllable but also incorporation of22 As we will discuss later, a word is, more or less, a semantically exocentric unit whether simple orcompound.

Phrase clipsPHRASE CLIPS operate across one nominal phrase boundary but within the boundary of a larger nominal orverbal phrase. There are four types of phrase clipCOORDINATE CLIPS, as in ri-lun < ri-dan lun-pa \"mountainand valley\"; ADNOMINAL CLIPS, as in rag-bum < ra-gan-gyi bum-pa \"brass vessel\"; RELATIVE CLIPS, as innor-ldan < nor-dan ldan-pa \"possessing wealth\"; and VERB CLIPS, as in Nbod-SKUL < Nbod-par SKUL \"exhortdeclaimingly.\" These four types will be treated separately in the following sections.4.1.3.1. Coordinate clipsCOORDINATE CLIPS are disyllabic reductions of nominal phrases which are processed as having originally beenjoined by -dan \"AND.\" Coordinate clips frequently consist of two nouns which are, in some way, semanticallycoordinate as well-for example, gnam-sa < gnam-dan sa \"heaven and < previous pagepage_93next page >"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"page_94file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_94.html[8/7/2010 9:52:59 PM]< previous pagepage_94next page >Page 94earth,\" sa-tshan < sa-dan tshan \"meat and beer,\" yon-mtshod < yon-bdagdan mtshod-gnas \"lay patron andreligious master,\" lo-pan < lo-tsa-ba-dan pandita ''translator and informant,\" skyabs-sems < skyabs-Ngro-dansems-skyed ''going for refuge and awakening the thought of enlightenment,\" tshe-bsod < tshe-dan bsod-nams \"lifeand merit,\" rgyal-blon < rgyal-po-dan blon-po \"king and minister.\" Coordinate clips occasionally consist ofsimilarly coordinated adjectivesfor example, dkar-gsal < dkar-po-dan gsal-po \"white and clear,\" ldzan-gzon <ldzan-gu-dan gzon-nu \"green and fresh.\"234.1.3.2. Adnominal clipsADNOMINAL CLIPS are disyllabic reductions of nominal phrases which are processed as having originally beenjoined by the subordinating adnominal particle -KYi.

Such adjectives may be primaryfor example, blun-gtam < blun-poi gtam \"foolish talk,\" dkar-zas < dkar-poi zas \"white food,\" nag-sran < nag-poi sran-ma \"blackbeans,\" bzan-spyod < bzan-poi spyod-pa \"good conduct,\" dkon-nor < dkon-poi nor \"precious wealth\"; or they maybe derivedfor example, sñe-Nbol < sñe-bai Nbol \"pillow to rest on,\" Nbri-smyug < Nbibai smyug-ma \"writingpen,\" slon-rkyen < slon-bai rkyen \"instigating cause,\" Ndzu-stobs < Ndzu-bai stobs \"digestive power,\" Ndzug-sgo< Ndzug-pai sgo \"entry door.\"4.1.3.3.

Syllabic CyclesAs we will see, there is reason to believe that some Tibetan syllables are in fact compressions of earlier disyllabiccollocationsfor example, Thebor brul, Magari bul, Burmese mrwe, Mikirphurul, Lushei rul, Tangkhul \"snake,\"but Proto-Tibetan *sa-brul \"ANIMAL snake\" > *s-brul > *sbrul \"snake\"; Old Chinese *syen \"bitter,\" Burmese ,Kanauri sin, Miri , Kachin sin, Lushei thin \"liver,\" but Proto-Tibetan *myi-tin \"HUMAN BODY PART liver\" >*m-tsin > *mtshin \"liver\"; Proto-Tibetan *btsa-sa \"bring forth place\" > *btsa-s > *btsas \"harvest.\" Some of thesemonosyllables then once again become disyllabic through affixation or compoundingthus Proto-Tibetan *sbrul>Old Tibetan sbrul \"snake,\" but Proto-Tibetan *mtshin >Old Ti- < previous pagepage_95next page >"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"page_96file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_96.html[8/7/2010 9:53:01 PM]< previous pagepage_96next page >Page 96betan mtshin-pa \"liver,\" and Proto-Tibetan *btsas >Old Tibetan btsas-ma \"harvest.\"24There is thus some evidence for the existence in Tibetan of a CYCLE of syllabism, with words alternatelycompressed and expanded into monosyllabic and disyllabic forms. Note particularly, in this regard, Nung ;Mikir the, Kanauri te, Miju tai, Kukish dei \"big,\" Proto-Tibetan *myi-the \"HUMAN BODY PART big\" > *m-the> *mthe ''thumb\" > Old Tibetan mthe-bo \"thumb\" > mtheb \"finger'' in such contractions as mtheb-tshun \"littlefinger.\" We might project, for example, such cyclic sequences as Proto-Tibetan *myi-tsin > *mtshin > Old Tibetanmtshin-pa > New Tibetan (Lhasa) >?tshimp \"liver,\" Proto-Tibetan *myi-the > *mthe >Old Tibetan mthe-bo>New Tibetan (Lhasa) thepo >?thep \"thumb,\" Proto-Tibetan *btsa-sa > *btsas >Old Tibetan btsas-ma >NewTibetan (Lhasa) > \"harvest,\" Proto-Tibetan *sa-bal > *sbal >Old Tibetan sbal-pa >New Tibetan (Lhasa)> \"frog.\" And, of course, such a cycle would presumably extend indefinitely into the past; it would be achicken-and-egg question to ask whether monosyllabism or disyllabism was the older state of the language.24 Thus also Burmese bha \"frog,\" but Proto-Tibetan *sa-bal \"ANIMAL frog\" > *s-bal > *sbal >OldTibetan sbal-pa \"frog\"; Lushei tit, Garo -tik, Lepcha dik \"scorpion,\" but Proto-Tibetan *a-dig \"ANIMALscorpion\" > *s-dig > *sdig >Old Tibetan sdig-pa \"scorpion\"; Lushei kal, Tiddim Chin kal, Chepang gal,Kaike khal \"kidney,\" but Proto-Tibetan *myi-khal \"HUMAN BODY PART kidney\" > *m-khal > *mkhal>Old Tibetan mkhal-ma \"kidney\"; Lepcha kri \"bitter,\" Kachin khri \"acid, sour,\" Burmese khre \"bile,\"Dimari khiri \"sour,\" but Proto-Tibetan *myi-khris \"HUMAN BODY PART bile\" > *m-khris > *mkhris>Old Tibetan mkhris-pa \"bile.\" < previous pagepage_96next page >"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"page_97file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_97.html[8/7/2010 9:53:01 PM]< previous pagepage_97next page >Page 977Words1. Preliminaries1.1. The Scope of MorphologyThere is a traditional and often useful distinction made between the MORPHOLOGY of a language and itsSYNTAXroughly, between the ways in which words in the language come to assume their particular forms, andthe ways in which these forms are strung together to make a grammatical utterance.Within morphology we can further distinguish two different types of process. There are morphological processesthat CREATE new words, and there are morphological processes that MODIFY words already in existence. Thuswe may say that child and children are different FORMS of the same WORD, since they have the same semanticcontent and belong to the same grammatical category; but child and childish must be accounted different wordsaltogether, although clearly related by a relatively transparent process of derivation.< previous pagepage_97next page >"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"page_98file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_98.html[8/7/2010 9:53:02 PM]< previous pagepage_98next page >Page 98although it is clear too that SDU, NDU, TU, mdud, Ndun-ma, sdud, and mdunma are closely related to each other.There are thus two branches of morphology: we will use the term LEXICAL MORPHOLOGY for those processesthat create words, and the term INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY for those processes that change the form ofwords. It is important to keep these two kinds of morphology distinct, especially as the study of classical Tibetanseems to have been long bedeviled by their confusion.1.2. The \"Parts of Speech\"There are two types of words in Tibetangrammatical words and lexical words. A class of GRAMMATICALWORDS, such as the conjunctions, has relatively few members and is unlikely to be added to by the usualprocesses of word formation: conjunctions form a closed class of words. On the other hand, a class of LEXICALWORDS, such as the nouns, has relatively many members: one can choose a noun from a very large set ofpossible alternatives. Only such a lexical class can be productivethat is, added to by new coinages with relativeease. Nouns form an open class of words.1Classical Tibetan has three classes of lexical wordsNOUNS, ADJECTIVES, and VERBS. Each such part of speechcan in general be defined by its occurrence and nonoccurrence in specific environments. First we can distinguishthose words that may occur before the determiner Ndi \"THIS\" (thus rta \"horse\" rta Ndi \"this horse,\" tshen-po\"great\" tshen-po Ndi ''this great one,'' SGOM \"contemplate\" but not ?sgom Ndi)from those words that may occurbefore the conjunction -TSin \"AND\" (thus SGOM \"contemplate\" sgom-zin \"contemplates and . . .,\" rta \"horse\" butnot ?rta-zin, tshen-po \"great\" but not ?tshenpo-zin). Next we can distinguish those words that may occur before an1 The distinction between lexical and grammatical words is precisely that drawn by the Chinese philologistsbetween shih-tzu, words with a concrete significance, and hsü-tzu, \"empty words\" themselves empty ofdefinable meaning but indicating the relationships among the other words. Such empty or grammaticalwords have generally been called PARTICLES in Sino-Tibetan linguistics. In classical Tibetan suchparticles maywhile lexical words do notundergo morphophonological changes conditioned, across syllableboundaries, by the last phoneme in the immediately preceding syllable. The Tibetan grammarians call suchparticles phrad, while lexical words are termed min. < previous pagepage_98next page >"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"page_99file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_99.html[8/7/2010 9:53:02 PM]< previous pagepage_99next page >Page 99intensifier such as Sin-tu \"very\" from those words that may not (thus tshen-po \"great\" sin-tu tshen-po ''very great,\"SGOM \"contemplate\" sin-tu sgom ''really contemplate,\" rta \"horse\" but not ?sin-tu rta).These two intersecting distinctions define the three lexical classes in Tibetan. Such words as rta \"horse\" (rta Ndi\"this horse\" but not ?sin-tu rta or ?rta-zin)we will call NOUNS. Such words as tshen-po \"great\" (tshen-po Ndi\"this great one\" and sin-tu tshen-po \"very great\" but not ?tshen-po-zin)we will call ADJECTIVES. And suchwords as SGOM \"contemplate\" (sin-tu sgom \"really contemplates\" and sgom-zin \"contemplates and . . .\" but not?sgom Ndi)we will call VERBS. Every Tibetan lexical word belongs to one or other of these three classes.22. Lexical MorphologyAt any stage of a language we may distinguish between OLD WORDS inherited from earlier stages and NEWWORDS created in any of several ways. For example, Old Tibetan ña \"fish\" was an old word3 inherited fromProto-2 There are, of course, some exceptions and apparent exceptions to these generalizations. An intensifiersuch as sin-tu \"very\" may precede a noun in some few loan words-for example, dug \"poison\" in sin-tu dug\"wolfsbane.\" Sometimes in poetic composition a participant nominal phrase may be transposed between anintensifier and its verb-for example, in the well-known hymn Btsom-ldan Ndas-mayan-dag-par rdzogs-pasans-rgyas bstodpa gsuns-pa to the twenty-one forms of the goddess Tara, where we read rtag-par sin-tuod ni mdzad-ma \"she who always truly creates light.\" And sometimes an intensified verbal phrase isnominalized as a whole, creating the illusion of an intensified noun-for example, sin-tu dga-ba \"great joy,\"which must be analyzed not as (sin-tu)(dga-ba)but rather as ((sintu DGA)-Pa), in just the same way as mi-dga-ba \"unhappiness\" must be analyzed not as (mi-)(dga-ba)but rather as ((mi-DGA)-Pa).3 The word ña \"fish\" is, apparently, a very old word. We find Burmese na, Kachin na, Tsangla na, Nung na,Lepcha no, Chepang na-ña, Pwo na, Sgaw ña, Lisu nwa, Akha na, Mpi no, and Old Chinese nyo \"fish,\" so thatOld Tibetan ña is, in some sense, the same word as the hypothetically reconstructed Proto-Sino-Tibetan *nya.On the other hand, the word rta \"horse,\" not found elsewhere in the Sino-Tibetan languages, was apparently anew word in Tibetan; I do not know where the word came from.Other words appear equally old, but have a more complex history. Old Chinese < originally meantsomething like \"color\"; the graph for the word consists of the graph for \"man\" above and the graph for \"seal,stamp\" below, to indicate printing ink.

Similarly,New Tibetan (Lhasa) <sans-rgyas> \"Buddha\" is an old word inherited from Old Tibetan sans-rgyas, but NewTibetan (Lhasa) <skad-par>\"phonograph\" is a new word created to fill a new lexical need.New words in Tibetan have come from a variety of sources. A new word may be a CONSTRUCTION fromexisting old wordsfor example, Old Tibetan myerdo \"fire stone ? flint\" or New Tibetan (Lhasa) meNta \"fire arrow ?gun.\" Or a new word may have been BORROWED from outside the language-for example, Middle Tibetan ba-dur\"warrior\" < Mongol bayatur or New Tibetan (Lhasa) peskop \"movies\" < English bioscope. Or a new word may bean IMITATION of a natural soundfor example, Old Tibetan pi-pi ''flute'' or New Tibetan (Lhasa) pakpak \"machinegun.\"4( footnote continued from previous page)continues to mean simply \"color,\" but also, more specifically, the color of the face, and thus, from earlytimes, \"countenance, looks, beauty,\" and eventually, in Chinese, \"lust, lewdness.\" In Tibeto-Burman, facialcoloring was semantically specialized in a different direction: we find Bunan srag \"shame,\" Magari kha-rak \"be ashamed,\" Nung sara \"shame,\" Burmese hrak \"be ashamed, shy,\" Mikir therak \"shame, disgrace; beashamed, blush.\" In Proto-Tibetan we can reconstruct a verb *srag, presumably with a similar meaning \"beashamed\"; in the classical language we find, with regular phonological change, the verb SAG \"confess.\"From *srag too we find a noun *srag-sa \"shame place\" > Old Tibetan sags, with two divergent meanings. Onthe one hand, the term, often with an honorific, as in bka-sags~mtshid-sags~gsol-sags, appears as early as inthe ninth-century Central Asian manuscripts with the meaning \"dispute, quarrel, matter in contention\"forexample, where a letter found at a Tibetan oasis garrison says that the Minister at Rta-zor bka-sags thugs-la tsidgons-pa gdab \"will decide the dispute as he thinks best.\" As an extension of this meaning, the termapparently comes to mean \"petition, complaint, formal statement of a case\"-for example, where a divinationmanual says that, as a result of a favorable augury, gsol-sags byas-na gnan \"if you have made a petition, it willbe granted.\" And, as an extension of this meaning, the term sags comes to mean as well \"concise statement,aphorism, adage\"for example, in a ninth-century collection of proverbs entitled Sum-pa ma sags tshen-po \"TheBig Book of Sayings of Mother Sum-pa.\" On the other hand, we find a different constellation of meanings for*srag-sa \"shame place\" > Old Tibetan sags, where the term comes to mean \"ridicule, sarcasm, joke at theexpense of another\"for example, sags tshe-ba byed \"insults maliciously,\" nan-sags \"a bad joke.\"4 But when is a word a NEW WORD? Note, for example, the old words rdo \"stone,\" rin-po \"long,\" and sbom-po \"heavy.\" We might find the two expressions rdo-sbom \"heavy stone\" and rdo-rin \"monument\" in a Tibetantext. Both are single disyllabic stress groups.

A proper criterion of lexicalization should enable us to determine that thelatter isand the former is nota WORD in the Tibetan language.A lexicographer might invoke three criteria to determine whether an expression has been lexicalized in thelanguage. First, a lexicographer might consider the FREQUENCY with which the expression occurs. If nor-tsan \"possessing wealth\" is a word that deserves a lexical entry, then does rta-tsan \"possessing horses\" deserveone too? Does phag-tsan \"possessing pigs\"? A lexicographer might resolve the difficulty by noting that thecollocation nor-tsan \"possessing wealth'' occurs in the texts with some frequency, while rta-tsan ''possessinghorses\" appears sporadically at best-and phag-tsan \"possessing pigs\" does not to my knowledge occur at all.Where an expression is otherwise well-formed but occurs in the literature with insufficient frequencyas is thecase with phag-tsanunder this criterion the expression remains unlexicalized.Second, a lexicographer might consider the GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY of the expression, and considerthe expression to have been lexicalized where its grammatical category has been changed in the construction.Under this criterion, for example, the adjective Ndzer-po \"hoarse\" is a new word because it is in a differentgrammatical category than its source verb DZER \"be hoarse,\" and the adjective rnag-tsan \"purulent\" is a newword because it is in a different grammatical category than its source noun rnag \"pus.\"Third, a lexicographer might consider the SEMANTIC CONTENT of the expression. A broad version of thiscriterion is to consider an expression to have been lexicalized where its semantic content has been changed inits construction. Under this criterion, for example, the noun bya-mo \"female bird\" is a new word because it hasa different semantic content than its source noun bya \"bird,\" and the noun rkan-dun \"ritual trumpet made froma human thighbone\" is a new word because it has a different semantic content than the sum of its componentnouns rkan-pa \"foot, leg\" and dun \"conch shell.\"A stricter version of this criterion is to consider an expression to have been lexicalized where its content isSEMANTICALLY EXOCENTRICthat is, where the meaning of the expression is not predictable from itscomponents, and the head member of the collocation cannot be substituted for the whole without semanticchange. Under this criterion, for example, the noun Ngro-ba \"living creature\" is a new word because itsmeaning differs from the etymologically expected \"goer\" < NGRO \"go,\" while the noun slon-ba \"beggar\" is nota new word because its meaning is predictable from its source verb SLAN \"beg.\" Similarly, under thiscriterion, the noun mdeu \"arrowhead\" is a new word because its meaning differs from the etymologicallyexpected \"little arrow\" < mda \"arrow,\" while the noun ñeu \"little fish\" is not a new word because its meaning ispredictable from its source noun ña \"fish.\"This criterion can be applied as well to disyllabic collocations of existing words. The stress groups rdo-dkar\"white stone,\" rdo-ril \"round stone,\" and rdo-sbom \"heavy stone\" are nonlexicalized and semanticallyendocentric: their meaning is predictable, and in any context( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_101next page >"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"page_102file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_102.html[8/7/2010 9:53:05 PM]< previous pagepage_102next page >Page 1022.1. ConstructionsThe CONSTRUCTION of new words out of the existing stock of the language takes place through the twoprocesses of compounding and derivation. COMPOUNDING is the process whereby new words are created by thejuxtaposition of two existing wordsfor example, Old Tibetan sin-rta \"wood horse ? cart\" and New Tibetan (Lhasa) <rkan-Nkhor>\"foot wheel ? bicycle.\" DERIVATION is the process whereby new words are created fromsingle existing words by affixing elements that are not themselves independent(footnote continued from previous page)(\"I hit him with a -\") the head member may substitute for the whole collocation. In a strict sense, suchstress groups are not the concern of the lexicon at all, since they are not separate words.On the other hand, the stress groups rdo-rin \"long stone ? monument\" and rdo-rdze \"noble stone ? vajra\" arenew words. They are lexicalized and semantically exocentric: their meaning is unpredictable, and in anycontext (''I hit him with a\") the head member may not substitute for the whole collocation without changing themeaning of what is asserted. It is only such collocations as these that would, ideally, be listed in the lexicon.Compare, also, rdo-rtsig \"stone wall\" and rdo-zam \"stone bridge,\" which are semantically endocentric andpredictable, with rdo-zo \"stone milk ? lime\" and rdo-snum ''stone oil ® petroleum,\" which are semanticallyexocentric and unpredictable.It must of course be confessed that this distinction is not always entirely clear. It may be that the noun slon-ba\"beggar\" is semantically predictable from the source verb SLAN \"beg.\" But we also find the expressions slon-ma \"female beggar\" and slon-mo \"alms.\" Which of these is semantically predictable? Again, the collocationmtshod-rten \"offering support ?- stupa/ caitya\" seems arguably lexicalized under this criterion, but it is moredifficult to decide about mtshod-khan \"offering house ? temple.\" Much seems to depend on a rather personalsense of what is semantically predictable and what is not. Much also seems to depend on the existence ofsimilar collocations: the expression mtshod-khan \"offering house ? temple\" looks considerably moreendocentric in the light of sman-khan \"medicine house ? apothecary,\" bzo-khan \"craft house ? workshop,\" andsog-khan \"paper house ? shop where paper is kept or manufactured.\"In all these cases, lexicographers must inevitably make difficult decisions as to which expressions are in factsufficiently lexicalized to be considered words in the language; the judgment is complicated too by theoreticalconsiderations regarding the distribution of functions between the grammar and the lexicon in a properdescription of a language. A user of lexical resources also must recognize the problems that underlie the worksupon which he or she must rely.

Compounds2.1.1.1. Native compoundsAs part of its stock of Tibeto-Burman morphological devices, classical Tibetan had available several ways ofcompounding old words to create new words for example, modifying a noun with a preceding noun, as in me-rdo\"fire stone  flint,\" or modifying a noun with a following adjective, as in rdo-rin \"long stone - monument.\"Indeed, these devices have remained productive throughout the history of the language; parallel to the twopreceding examples, we find, for example, New Tibetan (Lhasa) meNta <me-mda >\"fire arrow ? gun\" and <dpon-nan >\"wicked lord  bureaucrat.\" However, with the massive influx of Buddhist terms in the ninth century,the language used additional devices, in part derived from Sanskrit models, in order to render these new terms inTibetan-for example, compounding two adjectives, as in sans-rgyas ''awakened expanded  Buddha,'' or,prototypically, modifying a verb with a preceding intensifier, as in rnam-par SES \"particularly know  perceive (). These latter devices tend to be found primarily in these loan creations from Sanskrit originals; suchtranslation compounds will be treated separately.2.1.1.1.1. Noun + Noun ® NounThere are four ways in which native compounds yield new nouns in the classical language-NOUN + NOUN,ADJECTIVE + NOUN, NOUN + ADJECTIVE, and ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE.5 In the first instance, a nounmay be modified5 These four types of native noun compounds continue to be productive in New Tibetan.

Adjective + Adjective ® NounThe fourth type of native noun compound, of the form ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE - NOUN, is productive onlywithin a relatively restricted semantic range: here two semantically opposed adjectives yield an abstract noun ofwhich the two adjectives are polar exemplars.6 Thus we find rin-thun \"long short  length,\" tshe-tshun \"big little size,\" srab-mthug \"thin thick  density,\" grandro \"cold warm  climate,\" ñe-rin \"near far  distance,\" bzan-nan \"good bad  virtue,\" skam-rlon \"dry wet  dampness,\" mtho-dman \"high low  height,\" skyid-sdug \"happysad  luck,\" tsha-gran \"hot cold - temperature,\" mtshogdman \"best worst ? quality,\" drag-zan \"strong weak power.\"76 This type of compound is strikingly reminiscent of Chinese morphology, which uses the same device toform such abstract nouns-for example, to-shao \"many few - quantity,\" tahsiao \"big little - size,\" kao-hsia\"high low  quality,\"yüan-chin \"far near  distance,\" hanwen \"cold warm  weather.\" Note, too, that theother three types of noun compound consist of a HEAD and either a noun or adjective MODIFIER; theADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE  NOUN compound does not have a head.7 Such ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE  NOUN compounds are not uncommon, for example, in the Ge-sarepic: note rgan-gzon \"old young - age\" in rgan-gzon gral-gyi thob-Ngrigs gyis \"Take your places in order ofage,\" yag-ñes \"good bad  quality\" in las yag-ñes blta-bai migdan Ndra \"They are like eyes that will see thequality of deeds,\" and yag-rtsog \"good ugly - beauty\" and bzan-nan \"good bad  virtue\" in the couplet yag-rtsog mig-lam Nbab-lugs red, bzan-nan sems-kyi dpyad-lugs red \"Beauty is the falling of a glance; virtue isthe determination of the mind.\" Note here the playful use of the compounds mgyogs-bul \"fast slow speed,\"bzan-nan \"good bad  quality,\" rgod-zan \"strong weak  strength,\" dar-rgud \"growing failing  fluctuation,\"and thob-sor \"won lost  outcome\" in parallel structures:rta-la mgyogs-bul zer-ba de nub-gtsig rtsa-tshu bzan-nan yin pho-la rgod-zan zer-ba de ñin-gtsig rlun-rta dar-rgud yin( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_105next page >"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"page_106file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_106.html[8/7/2010 9:53:07 PM]< previous pagepage_106next page >Page 1062.1.1.1.5.

Translation compounds2.1.1.2.1. Adjective + Adjective  NounAs new Buddhist terms from India sought entry into the Tibetan lexicon, several additional types of compoundwere developed to express the new ideas. One type of such TRANSLATION COMPOUND is formed bycombining two adjectives, functioning as headless modifiers, to yield a new noun, often based on Indic folketymologies or Buddhist philosophical analysis; such compounds, of course, differ from such native ADJECTIVE+ ADJECTIVE ? NOUN compounds(footnote continued from previous page)after the noun portion of a NOUN + VERB  VERB compoundthus, for example, mgo-KHOR \"have thehead encircled  become confused\" khyed-kyi kha-sbyan-gis ned mgo-mi-Nkhor \"We are not taken in byyour eloquence.\" Other propositional participants can also come between the two components of such verbcompounds. In a poem by Mi-la ras-pa, for example, we find the compound no-SES \"know the face recognize\" in discontinuous form in the line na no khyod-kyis ma-ses-na \"If you do not recognize me .. .\"Note that the structure of this proposition is not nai no- khyod-kyis ma-ses-na ''If you do not know my face.. .\"; rather the structure is equivalent to na- khyod-kyis no-ma-ses-na ''If you do not face-know me . .\"Such NOUN + VERB  VERB compounds sometimes provide glimpses of Tibetan patterns of thought. Onegroup of these compounds incorporates the patient participant no \"face\"for example, as we have seen, no-SES\"know the face  recognize.\" But FACE, in Tibet, is clearly more than the surface of a thing. The face ofsomething is an indication of its true nature thus no-PHROD \"meet the face  know, understand, learn,\" no-SPROD \"cause to meet/ introduce the face  lay open the features of a thing, show its nature, teach.\" The faceof a person, similarly, is the barometer of the inner self-no-BAB \"have the face fall  lose courage,\" no-TSHA\"have the face get warm  feel shame\"; and the social face is the marker of personal worth--o-TSHE \"have theface be big  be appreciated, recognized, thanked,\" no-SRUN \"guard the face  have regard for the opinion ofothers,\" no-STOD \"elevate the face  praise, flatter,\" no-LOG \"turn the face  desert, abandon, oppose.\"We find a similar series of these compounds incorporating the patient participant yid~yi\"mind.\" The Tibetanmind changes in sizefor example, yid-TSHE \"have the mind be big believe,\" yid-THUN \"have the mind beshort - be rash, overhasty,\" yi-PHRI \"make the mind less  hate, dislike\"; in this the mind shares the capacityof other internal organs-thus sñin-TSHUN \"have the heart be little  be afraid,\" nan-THUN \"have the characterbe short  be impatient,\"nan-RiN \"have the character be long  be forebearing, long-suffering, phlegmatic.\"Effects upon the mind are the sources of emotions-thus, yid-KHUL \"have the mind subdued  be weary,troubled, harassed,\" yid-PHAM \"have the mind be defeated  be cast down, dejected, depressed,\" yid-PHROG\"steal the mind  infatuate, fascinate,\" yid-BYUN \"have the mind come out  be weary, discontented,\"yid-PYUN \"make the mind come out  make weary, cause to be discontented,\" yi-TSAD \"cut the mind  despair.\" < previous pagepage_107next page >"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"page_108file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_108.html[8/7/2010 9:53:09 PM]< previous pagepage_108next page >Page 108as rin-thun \"long short  size.\" Here, for example, we find sans-rgyas \"awakened expanded - Buddha\" combiningsans-pa < -TSAN-s \"awakened\" and rgyas-pa < -RGYA-s \"expanded,\" bsod-sñoms ''pleasing equal  alms formonks'' combining bsod-pa < N-BSOD \"pleasing\" and sñoms-pa < N-SÑOM-D \"evenly distributed,\" sdug-bsnal\"afflicted exhausted - suffering of the round of rebirth\" combining sdug-pa < N-SDUG \"afflicted, grieved,oppressed\" and bsnal-pa < N-BSNAL \"exhausted.\" Similarly, we find dran-sron \"straight upright< previous pagepage_108next page >"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"page_109file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_109.html[8/7/2010 9:53:09 PM]< previous pagepage_109next page >Page 109of a transitive or intransitive verbfor example, bdud-Ndul \"one who conquers demons - He Who Has Defeatedthe Evil One (marajit),\" gnodsbyin \"one who bestows harm ? demon (yaksa),\" tshos-skyon \"one who protectsdharma guardian deity (dharmapala),\" dge-slon ''one who begs alms  monk (bhiksu),'' sku-bsruns \"one whoprotects the body  bodyguard (?talavarga)\"; although in some cases the participant role of the preceding nounmay be oblique-for example, don-grub \"one WHOSE aim is accomplished ?

It istherefore not surprising that there are not many NOUN + VERB  VERB compounds in that dialect, exceptfor those, such as tshüteN <tshu-Ndren>\"draw water  irrigate,\" which seem to be relatively old. Instead,we find NOUN + VERB  NOUN compounds, but these, again, differ from the earlier translationcompounds of the same form. The translation compounds were clipped headless modifiers denoting theagent of the verbal action-for example, Old Tibetan gnod-sbyin \"harm bestowing  type of demon.\" TheLhasa City compounds, on the other hand, yield abstract nouns denoting the verbal action itself as modifiedby its relation to the preceding noun participant-for example, thita <dril-bsgrags>\"bell ringing propaganda,\" sunsi <gzun-bzes>\"government taking  confiscation,\" kotse <sgo-Nbyed>\"door opening inauguration,\" ñamso <ñamsgso>\"defect repairing  renovation,\" tshöta <tshod-blta>\"measure seeing experiment,\" nanrü <nan-rul>\"inside rotting - treason,\" tsintü <btsins-Ngrol>\"freeing from fetters liberation.\" These abstract nouns can then be used as verbs with appropriate auxiliaries, such as tshe<byed>\"do,\" toN <gton>\"send,\" cap <rgyab>\"act,\" and their honorific equivalents-thus, for example,kotse naN <sgo-Nbyed gnan>\"gives door opening inaugurates,\" ñamso tshe <ñams-gso byed>\"does defectrepairing  renovates,\" tsintü toN <btsins-Ngrol gton>\"sends freeing from fetters  liberates.\" Note theuse of the same auxiliaries with other nominals as well-namtu toN <gnam-gru gton>\"flies an airplane,\"meNta cap <me-mda rgyab>\"fires a gun,\" tshe <sman-btsos byed>\"provides medical treatment,\" <zabs-bro rgyab>\"does a dance.\"Similarly, the Lhasa City dialect is rich in compounds of the form VERB + VERB  NOUN, where the twoverb stems are combined to yield an abstract noun denoting the intersection of the twooften more or lesssynonymous-verb stems.

Intensifier + Verb -- VerbFinally, a third type of translation compound, used in rendering Sanskrit verbs, is formed by combining a verb witha preceding adverbal intensifier such as mnon-par \"manifestly,\" yons-su \"completely,\" yan-dag-par \"perfectly,'' orrnam-par \"particularly.''

But translate according to the meaning (of the expression as a whole) those that add nothing, because it is unnecessary to add superfluous words.Thus, for example, we find mnon-par SES \"manifestly know  perceive clairvoyantly (),\" mnon-parBYUN \"manifestly arise  leave home to become a monk (),\" rnam-par SES \"particularly know perceive (),\" rnam-par RTAG \"particularly examine  impose conceptual constructs (),\" so-sor RTAG\"individually examine  know precisely (.),\" so-sor MNAN \"individually listen  answer (),\" rab-tu GNAS \"highly place ? consecrate (),\" rab-tu SBYAR \"highly connect  practice (),\"rab-tu BYUN \"highly arise  become a religious mendicant (),\" rdzes-su BYA \"consequently do  imitate(),\" rdzes-su DZUN \"consequently hold  favor (),\" rdzes-su DRAN \"consequently remember practice contemplative mindfulness (),\" ñe-bar DZAG \"closely put - apply ().\"These verbal compounds are frequently nominalized; indeed, several such compounds have entered the classicallexicon solely in their nominalized( footnote continued from previous page)auxiliaries-for example, tsinsuN tshe <Ndzin-bzun byed>\"does holding holding  arrests,\" suso toN <bsu-gzog gton>\"sends stripping cutting  exploits,\" ceteN tshe <skyel-Ndren byed>\"does accompanyingleading  ships.\" < previous pagepage_110next page >"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"page_111file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_111.html[8/7/2010 9:53:11 PM]< previous pagepage_111next page >Page 111formsfor example, so-sor thar-pa \"individual liberation  ecclesiastical rules (pratimoksa),\" rdzes-su dpag-pa\"consequent weighing logical inference (anumana),\" rnam-par smin-pa \"particular ripening  karmic retribution(vipaka).\" All such nominalized intensifier-verb compounds are particularly liable to be clipped into disyllabicstress groups-thus rnam-ses < rnam-par Ses-pa \"particular knowing ? perception (vijñana),\" rnam-rtog < rnam-par rtog-pa ''particular examining ? imposition of conceptual constructs (vikalpa),'' ñer-Ndzog < ñe-bar Ndzog-pa\"close putting  application (upastha),\" rab-gnas < rab-tu gnas-pa \"high placing  consecration (pratistha),\"mnon-ses < mnon-par ses-pa \"manifest knowing - clairvoyance (abhijña),\" as well as sorthar < so-sor thar-pa\"individual liberation  ecclesiastical rules (pratimoksa),\" rnam-smin < rnam-par smin-pa \"outward ripening karmic retribution (vipaka),\" rdzes-dpag \"consequent weighing - logical inference (anumana).\"2.1.2. DerivationsDERIVATIONS of new words from old are of two types. We will use the term INNER DERIVATION to refer tothose processes of derivation that operate within the syllable, using such NONSYLLABIC FORMATIVES asprefixed s- (as in RIN \"be long\" SRIN \"make long\"), suffixed -d (as in DRO \"be warm\" drod \"warmth\"), andinfixed voicing (as in THON \"emerge\" DON \"eject\"). We will use the term OUTER DERIVATION to refer tothose processes of derivation that operate outside the syllable, using either such SYLLABIC FORMATIVES as -pa\"ONE HAVING TO DO WITH\" (as in mda \"arrow\" mda-pa \"archer\") or REDUPLICATION of the syllable as awhole (as in rnam-po \"bright\" rnam-rnam \"dazzling\").2.1.2.1. Inner derivation2.1.2.1.1. Change of Lexical CategoryOne form of inner derivation creates verbs from nouns simply by taking the noun as a verb rootfor example, tshu\"water\" TSHU (Ntsghu/btsus/btsu) \"draw water, irrigate,\" rgyan \"ornament\" RGYAN(rgyan/brgyan/brgyan)\"adorn,\" srab \"bridle\" SRAB (srab/bsrabs/bsrab)\"bridle a horse,\" tshibs \"horse\" TSHIB(Ntshib/btsibs/btsib)\"ride a horse,\" lan \"answer\" LAN (glon/blan/gla)\"make reply,\" rlan \"moisture\" RLAN(rlon/brlan/brlan)\"make wet,\" smad \"lower part, < previous pagepage_111next page >"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"page_112file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_112.html[8/7/2010 9:53:12 PM]< previous pagepage_112next page >Page 112low rank\" SMAD (smod/smad/smad)\"defame, blame, vilify.\"11 Such deriva- tions are, in fact, relatively rare inTibetan; but, where they occur, we often find them involved in word play: note, in the archaic poetry from CentralAsia, rta khyod ni khar srab-gyis srab \"You, horse, are bridled with a bridle in your mouth,\" byams-kyi lan glan \"Iwill answer an answer to his kindness,'' bgab-kyi zo bzos \"He milked the milk in secret,\" and, throughout theclassical literature, rgyan-gyis brgyan-pa ''adorned with adornments.\"2.1.2.1.2. Voicing and TransitivityIn classical Tibetan we find several pairs of verbs, clearly related phonologically and semantically, where one ofthe pair is marked as transitive, and the other as intransitive, by a difference in the voice onset time of the initial ofthe verb root. For example, in the verb pairs KHOD \"be placed, be put\" GOD \"place, put,\" TSHUN \"be tamed, besubdued\" DZUN \"tame, subdue,\" THON \"come out, emerge\" DON \"throw out, eject,\" TSHUGS \"take root, becomefirm\" DZUGS \"plant, establish,\" TSHUD \"be put, enter\" DZUD \"put, lead\" the transitive verb is distinguished by avoiced initial. Unfortunately, the picture is far from simple. One complication is that it seems equally the case thatintransitive verbs are distinguished by voiced initials: note the verb pairs GRIL \"be twisted, be wrapped around\"KRIL \"embrace, clasp round,\" DU \"come together, assemble\" TU \"gather, collect,\" DOR \"be scattered, bedispersed\" TOR \"scatter, cast away,\" BUD \"go away, disappear\" PUD \"transfer, put apart.\"Nor do the problems end there. In some verb pairs, initial voicing seems unrelated to transitivity at all-for example,KHRIG \"cohere, stick together\" GRIG \"correspond, fit together,\" KHRUL \"wander astray\" GRUL \"travel.\" In someverb pairs, initial voicing seems to have indicated, at one time or another, both transitivity and intransitivity: forexample, the roots TSHAG and DZAG both have both transitive and intransitive paradigms-that is, on the one hand,TSHAG1(Ntshag/tshags)\"drip, trickle\" DZAG2(Ndzag/btsags/gzag)\"cause to trickle, strain, squeeze\"; and, on theother hand, DZAG1(Ndzag/zags)\"drip,11 See also lug \"sheep\" LUG \"be sheepish, huddle together,\" and-although I think this example undercutsmy analysis of inflectional morphology-zo \"milk\" DZO (ndzo/bzos/bzo)\"milk an animal.\" In the case of rka\"furrow\" RKO (rko/brkos/brko)\"dig, gouge, hoe,\" the verb appears to have generalized the o in the presentstem rko < *G-RKA to all stems; in that of rdze \"lord, master\" RDZED (rdzed/brdzed/brdzed)\"honor,reverence,\" the verb appears to have generalized the present stem inflectional suffix -D to all stems. < previous pagepage_112next page >"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"page_113file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_113.html[8/7/2010 9:53:12 PM]< previous pagepage_113next page >Page 113trickle\" TSHAG2(Ntshag/btsags/btsag)\"cause to trickle, strain, squeeze.\"Finally, in too many verb pairs to be coincidental, the transitive verb is distinguished both by initial voicing and byuse of the present stem inflectional suffix -D, while the intransitive verb seems to be a backformation from thetransitive verb, generalizing the present stem of the same paradigm as the transitive member of the pair-forexample, KHEGS (Nkhegs/khegs) \"be hindered, be prohibited\" GAG (Ngegs < N-GAG-D/bkag/dgag)\"hinder,prohibit,\" KHENS (Nkhens/khens)''be full\" GAN (Ngens < N-GAN-D/bkan/dgan)''fill,\" KHEB (Nkheb/khebs)\"becovered over\" GAB (Ngebs < N-GAB-D/bkab/dgab)\"cover,\" KHEL (Nkhel/khel)\"be put on\" GAL (Ngel < N-GAL-D /bkal/dgal)\"put on,\" KHYED (Nkhyed/khyed)\"be distributed\" GYE (Ngyed < N-GYE-D /bgyes/bkye)\"divide,scatter, disperse,\" THEBS (Nthebs/thebs)\"be thrown, be hit\" DAB (Ndebs < N-DAB-D /btab/gdab)\"throw, hit.\"There is every reason to believe that it is the intransitive verbs that are here late analogical developments from thetransitive verbs. The process seems to have been to devoice the present stem of the transitive verbfor example,GAG \"hinder\" > N-GAG-D > Ngegs \"hinders\" > Nkhegs \"is hindered\" > KHEGS \"be hindered,\" GYE \"distribute\" >N-GYE-D > Ngyed \"distributes\" > Nkhyed \"is distributed\" > KHYED \"be distributed.\" If this hypothesis is correct,it would tend to indicate thatat least at the time of the backformationsthe association of voicing with transitivitywas, in some sense, normative; this would, I think conform to the intuition of modern speakers, but would beinconsistent with the pattern of other Tibeto-Burman languages.122.1.2.1.3. The Formative m- \"Honorific\"The prefix m- is found in a large number of words relating to the persons, property, and attributes of social andspiritual superiors. Note, for example, the nouns mkha \"heaven,\" mkhar \"castle,\" mgon-po \"lord, protector,\" mgron\"feast, banquet,\" mna \"might, dominion,\" mtshad-pa \"tomb, sepulchre,\" mtshog \"the best,\" mthu \"strength, magicpower,\" mda \"arrow,\" mdun \"spear, lance,\" mdos \"threadcross,\" mna \"oath,\" mtshun \"offerings for the ancestors,\"12 Compare, for example, Kanauri bön \"be filled\" pön \"fill,\" bar \"catch fire\" par \"set on fire,\" blus\"collapse\" phlus \"knock down,\" Bahing guk \"be bent\" kuk \"make bent,\" Bodo gen \"come loose\" khen\"loosen,\" Vayu bok \"be born\" pok \"give birth to.\" Note also, in Tibetan, GYE1 (Ngye/gyes)\"be divided\"alongside GYE2 (Ngyed/bgyes/bkye)\"divide,\" and GAL1 (Ngal/gal)\"be in opposition\" alongside GAL2(Ngel/bkal/dgal)\"put on, put over.\" < previous pagepage_113next page >"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"page_114file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_114.html[8/7/2010 9:53:13 PM]< previous pagepage_114next page >Page 114mdzod \"treasury, storehouse.\" Note too such honorifics as mtshed \"sibling\" for spun, mnal \"sleep'' for gñid, mtshan\"name\" for min. Similarly, note such verbs as these, denoting relations between superiors and inferiorsMNAG''commission, charge, delegate,\" MTSHOD \"honor, revere,\" MDZAL \"meet a superior, pay one's respects,\" MNOD\"receive from a superior\"; or these, denoting the qualities of the loftyMKHO \"be desirable, important,\" MTHO \"belofty,\" MTSHAR \"be wondrous,\" MDZANS \"be noble,\" MDZES \"be beautiful.\" And note such honorifics asMKHYEN \"know\" for SES, MNA \"possess\" for YOD, MNEL \"become tired\" for NAL, MÑES \"be pleased\" for DGA,MNAB \"put on clothes\" for GON, MDZAD \"do\" for BYA.It is thus tempting to hypothesize the existence of a nonsyllabic formative m\"HONORIFIC,\" although the source ofthis formative is not at all clear. But the hypothesis is consistent with several word familiesfor example, NGRO\"go\" Ngros \"gait\" Ngron-po \"guest\" *m-gro-n \"HONORIFIC travel NOMINAL\" > mgron \"feast, banquet,\" nag\"speech\" SNAG \"praise, extol\" snags \"incantation\" *m-nag \"HONORIFIC speech\" > MNAG \"commission, charge,delegate,\" KHAR \"be penned up, be confined\" DGAR \"separate, confine, pen up\" Ngar-po~-mo \"type of cattle\"sgar \"camp, encampment\" *m-khar \"HONORIFIC enclosure\" > mkhar \"castle, fort.\"2.1.2.1.4. The Formative m- \"Human Body Part\"It has long been noted that a surprisingly large number of Tibetan words denoting parts of the human body beginwith an m- prefixfor example, mkhal-ma \"kidney,\" mkhrig-pa \"wrist,\" mkhris-pa \"bile,\" mgal \"jaw,\" mgo \"head,\"mgul \"throat,\" mgrin-pa \"neck,\" mnal \"womb,\" mtshan \"side of the breast,\" mtshi-ma \"tears,\" mtshin-pa \"liver,\"mtshil-ma \"saliva,\" mtshu \"lip,\" mtsher-pa \"spleen,\" mdzin-pa \"neck,\" mdzug \"buttock,\" mdze \"penis,\" mthan\"lower part of the body,\" mthe-bo \"thumb,\" mtho \"span of the hand,\" mthonga \"chest,\" mdans \"complexion,\"mtshan \"genitals,\" mtshul-pa \"lower part of the face,\" mtshog-ma \"fontanelle,\" mdzub-mo \"finger,\" mdzer-pa\"wart.\" Note also Ndoms~mdoms \"pudenda,\" ldan-pa~mdan-pa \"cheek,\" as well as mthil \"bottom part\" in lag-mthil \"palm of the hand,\" rkan-mthil \"sole of the foot,\" mthil-bi \"the four bottoms -? palms and soles.\"It can be conjectured that this preinitial m- is in fact a nonsyllabic formative m- < Proto-Tibetan *myi- \"HUMANBODY PART,\" clearly related to-but not identical with-Proto-Tibetan *myi \"human being.\" For example, givenOld < previous pagepage_114next page >"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"page_115file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_115.html[8/7/2010 9:53:14 PM]< previous pagepage_115next page >Page 115Chinese *syen \"bitter,\" Burmese , Kanauri sin, Miri , Kachin sin, Lushei thin \"liver,\" we can hypothesizeProto-Tibetan *myi-tsin \"HUMAN BODY PART liver\" > *m-tsin > Old Tibetan mtshin-pa ''liver,'' given Lusheikal, Tiddim Chin kal, Chepang gal, Kaike khal \"kidney,\" we can hypothesize Proto-Tibetan *myi-khal \"HUMANBODY PART kidney\" > *m-khal >Old Tibetan mkhal-ma \"kidney,\" and given Lepcha kri \"bitter,\" Kachin khri\"acid, sour,\" Burmese khre \"bile,\" Dimasa khiri \"sour,\" we can hypothesize ProtoTibetan *myi-khris \"HUMANBODY PART bile\" > *m-khris >Old Tibetan mkhris-pa \"bile.\" Note how this human part formative functions inthe context of the word family KHRIG \"cohere, stick together\" GRIG \"correspond, fit together\" SGRIG \"puttogether\" *m-khrig \"HUMAN BODY PART joint\" > mkhrigpa \"wrist,\" or the word family GAL, \"be in opposition\"GAL2 \"put on, put over\" RGAL \"dispute, contend\" *m-gal \"HUMAN BODY PART opposition\" > mgal \"jaw.\"2.1.2.1.5. The Formative s- \"Animal\"A number of classical Tibetan words for animals begin with an s- preinitialfor example, stag \"tiger,\" sdig-pa\"scorpion,\" sdom \"spider,\" spyan \"wolf,\" spra~spre \"monkey,\" sbal-pa \"frog,\" sbur-pa \"beetle,\" sbran-bu \"bee,\"sbrul \"snake,\" smig-bu \"lizard,\" and perhaps also sder-mo \"claw, talon,\" spar-ba \"paw, claw,\" spu \"hair, feather,\"sbans \"dung of a large animal.\" This preinitial s- may in fact be a nonsyllabic formative s- < Proto-Tibetan*sa-\"ANIMAL,\" clearly related to but not identical with Proto-Tibetan *sa \"animal,\" *swa \"deer.\" This ANIMALPREFIX apparently dates back to Proto-Tibeto-Burman, since it is found throughout the Tibeto-Burman languages,although in different languages it may be prefixed to different words. For example, some of these language showan animal prefix where Tibetan has none: for example, we find Lushei savom, Lepcha satum, Miri situm, butTibetan dom \"bear,\" and, similarly, Lushei sahna but Tibetan ña \"fish,\" Lushei sava but Tibetan bya \"bird.\"Conversely, sometimes Tibetan shows an animal prefix where other Tibeto-Burman languages do not-for example,Thebor brul, Magari bul, Burmese mrwe, Mikir phurul, Lushei rul, Tangkhul phara \"snake,\" but Proto-Tibetan*sa-brul \"ANIMAL snake\" > *s-brul >Old Tibetan sbrul \"snake,\" Lushei tit, Garo -tik, Lepcha dik \"scorpion,\" butProto-Tibetan *sa-dik \"ANIMAL scorpion\" > *s-dig >Old Tibetan sdig-pa \"scorpion,\" Burmese bha \"frog\" butProto-Tibetan *sa-bal \"ANIMAL frog\" > *s-bal > Old Tibetan sbal-pa \"frog,\" Mikir teke \"tiger\" but Proto-Tibetan *sa-tag \"ANIMAL tiger\" > *s-tag > Old Tibetan stag \"tiger,\" Burmese bhan < previous pagepage_115next page >"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"page_116file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_116.html[8/7/2010 9:53:14 PM]< previous pagepage_116next page >Page 116\"ordure\" but Proto-Tibetan *sa-bans \"ANIMAL ordure\" > *s-bans >Old Tibetan sbans ''dung.\" Finally, we findthe animal prefix in some cases both in Tibetan and elsewherefor example, Miri sibe, Tibetan spre \"monkey,\"Lushei sakei Tibetan stag \"tiger.\"2.1.2.1.6.

The Formative s-d-s-n \"Kinship Collective\"The nonsyllabic formative s-d or s-n \"KINSHIP COLLECTIVE\" is found in a very few words denoting kinshipgroups, where its function is apparently to expand the range of reference of the source nounfor example, pha\"father\" pha-spad \"father and children,\" ma \"mother\" ma-smad \"mother and children,\" phu \"elder brother\" spun\"siblings\" span-spun \"brothers, relatives,\" khu \"uncle\" skud-po \"brother-in-law, father-in-law,\" tsha \"grandchild,nephew\" khu-tshan \"uncle and nephew.\"2.1.2.2.

The Formative -ñid \"-NESS\"The syllabic formative -ñid \"-NESS\" is suffixed to adjectives to yield abstract nouns-for example, sla-ba \"easy\"sla-ba-hid \"easiness,\" dka-ba \"difficult\" dka-ba-ñid \"difficulty,\" sra-ba \"hard\" sra-ba-ñid \"hardness,\" nag-pa\"black\" nag-pa-ñid \"blackness,\" tsha-ba \"hot\" tsha-ba-ñid \"heat,\" bzan-ba \"good\" bzan-ba-ñid \"goodness.\" Suchforms are primarily metaphysical in connotation: sra-ba-ñid \"hardness,\" for example, is a term for a qualitycharacteristic of all material substance. Similarly, bzan-ba-ñid \"goodness\" refers to goodness considered in theabstract; goodness considered as a matter of degree would be expressed by the ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE ?NOUN compound bzan-nan \"good bad ? virtue.\"The formative -ñid \"-NESS\" is thus primarily productive in the area of Buddhist philosophical abstraction.

The Formative -pa \"Person Having to do With\"The syllabic formative -pa \"PERSON HAVING TO DO WITH\"-which must be clearly distinguished from thenominalizer -Pais extremely productive in classical Tibetan, and it is suffixed to nominals of all types to yield newnouns. Thus we find mda \"arrow\" mda-pa \"archer,\" zin \"field\" iii-pa \"farmer,\" rta \"horse\" rta-pa \"horseman,\"sman \"medicine\" sman-pa \"doctor,\" tshu \"water\" tshu-pa \"water carrier,\" gar \"dance\" gar-pa \"dancer,\" khyim\"house\" khyim-pa \"householder,\" grwa \"school\" grwa-pa \"scholar,\" rnal-Nbyor \"yoga\" mal-Nbyor-pa \"yogin,\" ka-kha \"ABC\" ka-kha-pa \"schoolchild,\" lha-sa \"Lhasa City\" lha-sa-pa \"resident of Lhasa City,\" bod \"Tibet\" bod-pa\"Tibetan,\" ri-bo \"mountain\" ri-bo-pa \"highlander,\" dpyod-pa \"examination\" dpyod-pa-pa \"examiner.\" Similarly,we find -pa suffixed to adjectives, as in gtser-bu \"naked\" gtser-bu-pa \"naked ascetic,\" and to complex nominals, asin las danpo \"first work ? beginning\" las-dan-po-pa \"beginner,\" rkan gñis \"two feet\" rkan-gñis-pa \"biped,\" bye-brag-tu smra-ba \"vibhasa\" bye-brag-tu smra-ba-pa \"Vaibhasika.\"2.1.2.2.1.3. The Formative -mkhan \"Skilled In\"The form -mkhan \"SKILLED IN\" appears in several collocations after nounsfor example, sa \"country\" sa-mkhan\"guide,\" lam \"path\" lam-mkhan \"guide,\" sin \"wood\" sin-mkhan \"carpenter,\" gar \"dance\" gar-mkhan \"dancer,\" gzu\"bow\" gzu-mkhan \"bowmaker,\" bzo \"handicraft\" bzo-mkhan artisan.\" The form -mkhan is clearly related to anumber of lexical items with similar meanings: note MKHYEN \"know,\" mkhan-po \"scholar, abbot,\" mkhas-pa\"knowledgeable,\" mkhas-po \"learned person.\" It is not clear to me, however, whether -mkhan is better described asa syllabic formativethat is, a form that is not itself a word, although perhaps etymologically related to a word, suchas mkhan-po \"scholar, abbot\"or instead as a clipped word functioning as the second member of a compound.

The Formative -tsan \"Possessing\"The syllabic formative -tsan \"POSSESSING\" is suffixed to nouns to create adjectives.

The Formative -yas \"-Less\"The syllabic formative -yas \"-LESS\" is suffixed to nouns to create adjectives with a privative meaning. It is, in thissense, the semantic opposite of the syllable formative -tSan \"POSSESSING,\" but its scope is much more restricted.The formative -yas \"-LESS\" is found only with nouns denoting extentthus, for example, bgran \"number\" bgran-yas \"numberless,\" mtha \"end, border, limit\" mtha-yas \"endless,\" dpag \"measure\" dpag-yas \"measureless,\" gzal\"weight, measure\" gzal-yas \"infinite.\"2.1.2.2.1.7.

Sex Formaties2.1.2.2.1.8.1. The Formatives -mo \"FEMALE\" and -pho \"MALE\"Several syllabic formatives in the classical language function to specify the sex of nominals with animate referents.Many Tibetan animate nouns are unmarked for sex: they refer vaguely to beings of either sex. Where there is aneed to specify the sex of the referent, the sex formatives -mo \"FEMALE\" and -pho \"MALE\" yield nouns with thisadditional information. Thus we find bran \"servant\" but bran-mo \"maidservant\" bran-pho \"manservant,\" Ndre\"demon\" but Ndre-mo \"female demon\" Ndre-pho \"male demon,\" sa \"deer\" but sa-mo \"doe\" sa-pho \"buck,\" ra\"goat\" but ra-mo \"nanny goat\" ra-pho \"billy goat,\" bya \"bird\" but bya-mo \"hen\" bya-pho \"cock,\" lug \"sheep\" butlug-mo \"ewe\" lug-pho \"ram,\" rta \"horse\" but rta-mo \"mare\" rta-pho \"stallion,\" < previous pagepage_123next page >"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"page_124file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_124.html[8/7/2010 9:53:19 PM]< previous pagepage_124next page >Page 124khyi \"dog\" but khyi-mo \"bitch\" khyi-pho \"male dog,\" dre \"mule\" but dre-mo ''jenny'' dre-pho \"male mule.\"2.1.2.2.1.8.2. Animal Sex FormativesNouns referring to animals form several interesting lexical fields in Tibetan. Unmarked and sex-marked animatenouns combine with their respective diminutives to constitute the following semantic array:UNMARKEDFEMALEMALEYOUNG\"horse\"rtarta-morta-phorteu\"deer\"sasa-mosa-phoseu\"goat\"rara-mora-phoreu\"dog\"khyikhyi-mokhyi-phokhyiu\"bird\"byabya-mobya-phobyeu\"mule\"dredre-modre-phodreu\"sheep\"luglug-molug-pholug-guMoreover, a further distinction of sex is often drawn between castrated and uncastrated domestic animals, wherethe uncastrated form is marked with the syllabic formative pha- \"UNCASTRATED\" and the castrated form iseither unmarked or marked with the syllabic formative pho- \"CASTRATED.\" Thus we find glan \"ox\" pha-glan\"bull,\" ra-pho \"goat\" pha-ra \"buck goat,\" pho-rta \"gelding\" pha-rta \"stallion,\" pho-phag \"gelded boar\" pha-phag\"boar,\" pho-g.yag \"gelded yak\" pha-g.yag \"bull yak.\" Note the resulting distribution of termsrta \"horse (male orfemale),\" rta-pho \"male horse (gelded or ungelded),\" pho-rta \"gelded horse,\" pha-rta \"stallion.\"The females of such domestic animals often have nonderived names (thus ba \"cow\" rather than ?glan-mo, Nbri-mo\"female yak\" rather than ?g.yag-ma, and rgod-ma \"mare\" alongside rta-mo), or names derived with the syllabicformative mo- \"DOMESTIC FEMALE\" in parallel with pho- \"CASTRATED.\" Again note the distribution oftermsrta \"horse (male or female),\" rta-mo \"female horse (wild or domestic),\" mo-rta \"domestic female horse.\"Note too that we therefore find stag-mo \"tigress\" but not ?mo-stag and sen-ge-mo \"lioness\" but not ?mo-sen-ge.Domestic animals thus constitute a lexical field much like the following: < previous pagepage_124next page >"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"page_125file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_125.html[8/7/2010 9:53:19 PM]< previous pagepage_125next page >Page 125UNCASTRATEDCASTRATEDFEMALE\"ox\"pha-glanglanba\"yak\"pha-g.yagpho-g.yagNbri-mo\"goat\"pha-rara-phora-mo\"horse\"pha-rtapho-rtamo-rta\"pig\"pha-phagpho-phagmo-phag2.1.2.2.1.8.3. The formatives -mo and -ma \"FEMALE\"Many other Tibetan animate nounsand generally all nominals with human referentsrefer vaguely both to males andto beings of either sex. Where there is a need to specify the referent as female the syllabic formatives -mo\"FEMALE\" and -ma \"FEMALE\" yield nouns with the additional information. A source nominal that ends in -Paor -pa will generally derive its sex-marked form with -ma, one that ends in -PHO will generally derive its sex-marked form with -mo, and one that ends in neither will idiosyncratically select one formative or the other,although there appears to be some tendency for native Tibetan words to select -mo and for borrowed expressionsand neologisms to select -ma.In this last case we find the sex formative -mo selected in such nominals as mi \"human being, man\" mi-mo\"woman,\" lha ''deity, god\" lha-mo \"goddess,\" bu \"child, son\" bu-mo ''daughter,\" rdze \"noble person, lord\" rdze-mo\"lady,\" klu \"serpent deity, serpent god\" klu-mo \"serpent goddess,\" gnod-sbyin \"demon, male demon\" gnod-sbyin-mo \"female demon,\" pho-ña \"messenger, male messenger\"pho-ña-mo \"female messenger,\" stag \"tiger, male tiger\"stagmo \"tigress,\" grul-bum \"ghoul, male ghoul\" grul-bum-mo \"female ghoul,\" and we find the sex formative -maselected in such nominals as dge-slon \"cenobite, monk\" dge-slon-ma \"nun,\" rdze-btsun \"reverend person, reverendsir\" rdzebtsun-ma \"reverend madam,\" dban-phyug \"mighty one, lord\" dban-phyug-ma \"lady,\" mkha-Ngro\"celestial spirit, daka\" mkha-Ngro-ma \"dakini,\" gzon-nu \"young person, youth\" gzon-nu-ma \"maid.\"Among nominals whose unmarked forms end in -Pa or -pa we find bod-pa \"Tibetan, male Tibetan\" bod-ma\"female Tibetan,\" gar-pa \"dancer, male dancer\" gar-ma \"female dancer,\" tshos-pa \"religious person, monk\" tshos-ma \"nun,\" mal-Nbyor-pa \"practitioner of yoga, yogin\" mal-Nbyor-ma \"yogini,\" logñis-pa \"two-year-old, two-year-old boy\" lo-gñis-ma \"two-year-old girl,\" Nphags- < previous pagepage_125next page >"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"page_126file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_126.html[8/7/2010 9:53:20 PM]< previous pagepage_126next page >Page 126pa \"noble person, nobleman\" Nphags-ma \"noblewoman,\" Nphrog-pa \"thief, male thief'' Nphrog-ma ''female thief,\"nor-ldan-pa \"rich person, rich man\" nor-ldan-ma \"rich woman,\" so-sor Nbran-pa \"follower, male devotee\" so-sorNbran-ma \"female devotee.\"Among nominals whose unmarked forms end in -PHO we find tsha-bo \"grandchild, grandson\" tsha-mo\"granddaughter,\" g.yog-po \"servant, manservant\" g.yog-mo \"maidservant,\" grogs-po \"friend, male friend\" grogs-mo \"female friend,\" rgyal-po \"royalty, king\" rgyal-mo \"queen,\" glan-po \"elephant, male elephant\" glan-mo\"female elephant,\" Ngon-po \"demon, male demon\" Ngon-mo \"female demon,\" dban-po \"sovereign, malesovereign\" dban-mo \"female sovereign,\" gtso-bo \"chief, first lord\" gtso-mo \"first lady,\" tshen-po \"great one, greatman\" tshen-mo \"great lady,\" dkar-po \"white one, white male\" dkar-mo \"white female.\"2.1.2.2.1.8.4. NamesIn some cases too the formatives -mo \"FEMALE\" or -ma \"FEMALE\" may replace the -PHO or -Pa or -pa suffixof some nominals to yield nouns denoting a special kind or particular example of the class denoted by the sourcenominala specification of the sort often rendered in English by initial capitalization.

Similarly, lam-rim tshen-po \"great sequential teaching\" couldrefer to any such teaching, but the term lam-rim tshen-mo refers specifically to the Rim-pa thams-tsad tshan-barston-pai byantshub lam-gyi rim-pa by Tsofi-kha-pa.

GeographyTo the Tibetans, both mountains and plains apparently tend to be feminine. In the archaic manuscripts fromCentral Asia we find mention of such than \"plains\" as mon-mo than, bal-mo than, lho-mo than, rgya-mo than,rgyal-mo than, and dbyar-mo than--this last, for example, presumably the same as the g.yer-mo-g.yar-mo-yar-mothan of modern travelers, and presumably the same as the dbyar-mo than mentioned on the Potala pillar inscriptionof 764, recounting the Tibetan victories over the Chinese. Note lho-mo than \"southern plain\" < lho \"south,\" bal-mothan ''Nepalese plain\" < bal-yul \"Nepal,\" rgya-mo than ''Chinese plain\" < rgya-nag \"China,\" and mon-mo than\"Mon Plain,\" < mon \"people living between Tibet and India, including Assam, Bhutan, and Lahul,\" where it seemsreasonable to view the -mo suffix as a proper name marker, as in the preceding section. Moreover, whatever Freudmight say, mountains seem indisputably feminine, and are called \"aunt\" or dzo-mo \"lady,\" as in the mountainnames dzo-mo kha-nag \"Lady Black-mouth\" or dzo-mo lha-ri \"Lady God-mountain.\"2.1.2.2.1.9.

We may thus note a continuing tendency in the classical language to supplement olderadjectives in -PHO with adjectives in -Pa derived from the same verbs. Thus we find such doublets as dka-bo~ka-ba \"difficult,\" skyid-po~skyid-pa \"happy,\" rtag-po~rtag-pa \"lasting,\" dga-bo~dgaba \"happy,\" sra-bo~sra-ba\"hard,\" mthun-po~mthun-pa \"affable,\" gsar-pogsar-ba \"new,\" bzan-po~bzai-ba \"virtuous,\" gtum-po~gtum-pa\"furious.\" Certain common adjectives in -PHO remained largely in their earlier formstshen-po \"great,\" man-po\"many,\" dkar-po \"white,\" dmar-po \"red,\" and so on. The change from -PHO to -Pa was also blocked where thesource verb had meanwhile been lost from the language, as with dam-po \"tight\" from a lost verb *DAM \"*bebound\" (compare SDAM \"bind\"), or where the source verb was, unusually, transitive rather than stative, as withDRAN \"pull\" dran-po \"straight.\"18The formative -PHO also occurs in the derivation of nouns with animate or human referents from inanimate andfrequently abstract nouns.

In a few cases, however, we find that the form in -E is an adjective but the form in -E-Pa is an abstract noun-for example, KER \"raise\" ke-re \"erect\" kye-re-ba \"act of standing erect,\" NGREN \"stand\"NGRON \"be straight\" kran-ne \"standing\" kran-e-ba \"upright posture,\" SDUG \"be attractive\" sdug-ge \"good\" sdug-ge-ba \"state of being pleased,\" LHAG \"exceed, surpass\" lhag-ge \"projecting\" lhag-ge-ba \"excess amount.\"2423 It has been speculated that derivatives in -E are actually Middle Tibetan forms borrowed into theclassical language, based primarily on the observation that the derivatives are frequently without preinitials-for example, tsher-re \"staring\" < BTSER \"stare,\" sem-me \"smiling\" < BSUM \"smile,\" sigs-se \"rocking\" <GSIG \"put together\"-just as one might expect in any of several dialects where these preinitials were in theprocess of being lost.

The Formative -kha~-ka--ga \"Mouth\"The suffix -kha~-ka-ga appears in a variety of nouns which apparently have little in common; in many cases thesuffix does not appear to be derivational, although it does recur in particular contexts. For example, the suffixappears in words for times of the day and seasons of the yeardgun-ka \"winter,\" dgonns-ka \"evening,\" ston-ka\"autumn,\" dpyid-ka \"spring,\" dbyar-ka ''summer, rainy season,'' zogs-ka \"morning,\" sos-ka-so-ka \"spring, hotseason.\" It also appears in a few color words, such as ldzan-kha (for the more common ldzan-gu)\"green,\" nur-ka\"bright red,\" and in mthiii-ka \"blue\" and mthon-ka \"azure, sky blue,\" where one might suspect a connection withmkha \"heaven.\" And it appears in a few words for body partssñin-ga \"heart,\" thugs-ka \"heart,\" mthon-ga \"chest,\"lon-ka \"intestines.\"In several words, however, it is possible to discern a relationship between the suffix -kha~-ka~-ga and the nounkha \"mouth,\" in any of three extended sensesreferring to holes or openings, to the edges of things, and to surfaces.Thus we find khram-kha \"ornamental cut or notch in wood,\" tsha-ga \"hem, edge, border,\" lton-ka \"notch,depression, indentation,\" thad-ka \"the direction straight ahead,\" phal-ka \"indentation, incision, notch,\" bu-ga~bug-ka \"hole, opening,\" wa-kha \"water channel, gutter,\" ser-ka \"cleft, slit, fissure, crevice.\" Note the following flatsurfaces~lten-ka-lden-ka \"pool, pond,\" sten-ka \"terrace,\" than-ka \"painting,\" na-kha \"meadow,\" as well as zen-kha \"breadth, width.\" A relation with kha \"mouth\" in these extended senses seems clear in gru \"boat\" gru-kha\"ferry landing,\" thab \"hearth\" thab-ka \"fireplace,\" mthons \"smoke hole\" mthons-ka \"gallery or platform on a roof,\"zor \"weapon\" zorkha \"edge of a weapon,\" la \"mountain pass\" la-kha \"highest point of a pass,\" and is less clear inlam \"road\" lam-ka \"route, roadside,\" gzi \"residence\" gziska \"native country.\"In any case, it is not obvious that the process here is better described as derivation with a syllabic formative or ascompounding with kha \"mouth\" as a second member. All of this still leaves a residue of nouns with no obvioussources, such as skas-ka \"ladder,\" kyal-ka \"joke,\" skya-ka \"magpie,\" tsho-ga \"ritual,\" ña-ga \"steelyard,\" star-ka\"walnut,\" dan-ga \"appetite,\" don-ka \"medicinal plant,\" ber-ka \"staff, stick,\" yal-ga \"branch,\" srub-ka \"medicinalgrain,\" and just a few instances where the suffix looks rather like a nominalizer, with a preference for producingabstract nounsfor example, NKHO \"desire, think to be valuable\" mkho-ba \"desirable\" Nkhos-ka \"worth, value,importance,\" GÑER \"take care of, provide for, take pains with\" gñer-pa < previous pagepage_133next page >"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"page_134file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_134.html[8/7/2010 9:53:24 PM]< previous pagepage_134next page >Page 134\"steward\" gñer-kha \"attention, care,\" DAM ''choose, select\" Ndam-ka \"choice, option,'' GDEN \"raise, brandish,flourish\" gdens-ka \"expanded hood of the cobra.\"252.1.2.2.2. Reduplication2.1.2.2.2.1. Nominal ReduplicationAnother form of outer derivation is REDUPLICATION, which, in nominals, can be either simple or what we willcall alternating reduplication. SIMPLE REDUPLICATION produces adjectives from adjectives, with the derivativehaving an intensive or iterative sensefor example, thib-po \"dense\" thib-thib \"very dark,\" Nkhyog-po \"crooked\"Nkhyog-Nkhyog \"tortuous,\" Nther-po \"glossy\" NtherNther \"polished,\" zim-bu \"thin\" zim-zim \"fine as a hair,\" rnam-po \"bright\" rnam-rnam \"dazzling,\" ltem-po \"full\" ltem-ltem \"overflowing,\" than-po \"dense\" than-than \"strained tothe utmost,\" skyur-po \"sour\" skyur-skyur \"very sour,\" kum-po \"crooked\" kum-kum \"shriveled up,\" lkugs-pa\"stupid\" lkugs-lkugs \"very stupid.\" Note also Nthor-ba \"strewn\" Nthor-Nthor \"drizzling,\" Nbal-ba \"disheveled\"Nbal-Nbal \"shaggy,\" sgren-ba \"erected\" sgren-sgren \"well fixed,\" ldir-ba \"distended\" ldir-ldir \"full to the brim,\"lon-ba \"rising\" lon-lon \"rising in waves, bulging out.\"Such reduplications are sometimes used to great poetic effect in the epic of Ge-sar-for example,khra-mo glin-gi mdo-tshen-rnams la-la smug-po phyur-phyur red thad-la rgya-khra Nphur-Nphur red thur-la rbab-rgod yar-yar redThe great spotted horses of Glin are a swirling fog upon the passes, are soaring hawks upon the plain, are a leaping avalanche as they descend.25 The discussion of three syllabic formatives which occur with adjectivesyan- \"MORE,\" dze- \"MORE,\"and -sos \"MOST\"is deferred to the section on adjectives, where they are briefly reviewed. < previous pagepage_134next page >"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"page_135file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_135.html[8/7/2010 9:53:25 PM]< previous pagepage_135next page >Page 135Alternating reduplication yields disyllabic stress groups with the first syllable always having the vowel a. Wherethe source of the reduplicated form has a vowel other than a, that vowel is retained in the second syllable; wherethe source has the vowel a, the second syllable has a back rounded vowel, either o or u. As with simplereduplication, this process creates derivatives with an intensive or iterative sense. Thus, from source syllables withthe vowel a, we find such examples as ldam-po \"lazy\" ldam-ldum \"pitiful,\" nan-pa \"bad\" nan-non \"miserable\";and, from source syllables with vowels other than a, we find such examples as glen-pa ''stupid'' glan-glen \"verystupid,\" khums-pa \"crooked\" kham-khum \"with uneven ridges,\" Nkhrug-pa \"disturbed\" khragkhrug \"tumultuous,\"Nkhol-ba \"insensible\" khal-khol \"stunned,\" Ndzog-pa \"heaped together\" Ndzag-Ndzog \"jumbled up.\"In addition, alternating reduplication is found in several nounssimilarly intensive or iterative in meaningderivedfrom both nouns and adjectives.

Verb ReduplicationWe also occasionally find verb stems reduplicated in the classical texts, with two different senses. The first is acontinuative or iterative sense: this construction is old in Tibetan, and is found in the archaic Central Asianmanuscriptsfor example, srin go-phus rbeg-ga rbeg-si lags sñam-ste bzab-bzab \"The demon Go-phu kept creepingup, thinking, 'This is Rbeg-ga rbeg-si,\"' bu-mo tsen-Ngi rba-ga lug Ntsho g.yan skyon-du mtshi-mtshi \"The girlTsen-Ngi rba-ga was going about pasturing the sheep and guarding the lambs,\" byeu sñi-ñul-du son-son \"The littlebirds kept going into the snare,\" rmal-zin bkalbkal bkal-zin bzu-bzu bzu-zin bran-bran bran-zin bdag-bdag \"Sheplucked it and spun it again and again, she spun it and made thread of it again and again, she made thread of it andtied it again and again, she tied it and wove it again and again.\" Reduplicated constructions with this sense arefound in later texts as wellfor example, from the epic of Ge-sar, < previous pagepage_135next page >"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"page_136file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_136.html[8/7/2010 9:53:25 PM]< previous pagepage_136next page >Page 136de bsam-zin blon-po ma-bsdad on lam thag-rin sog-skya bsgril-bsgril byas sa rgyus-med skyi-ser on-on byasThus thinking, the minister did not tarry but came: He kept his pale wings beating on the long road, He kept his yellow hide moving in the unfamiliar country.Mi-la ras-pa uses such reduplicated verbs as a repeated device in one of his songs, which he sings whenreproached for dressing immodestly in only a strip of cloth, and of which the following are a few verses:nas rtag-tu mi-yul Ngrim-Ngrim-nas ran-yul nan-gis brdzed-de thalI have been continually wandering the earth and have just naturally gone and forgotten my home.gtsig-pur ri-khrod Ngrim-Ngrim-nas gron-yul nan-gis brdzed-de thalI have been wandering the mountains alone and have just naturally gone and forgotten inhabited places.lus-la gtum-mo sbar-sbar-nas lus-gos nan-gis brdzed-de thalI have been kindling the mystic heat in my body and have just naturally gone and forgotten my clothes.sems-la gan-byun byas-byas-nas sba-gsan nan-gis brdzed-de thalI have been paying heed to whatever arises in my mind and have just naturally gone and forgotten my penis.gtsig-pur bag-yod spyad-spyad-nas no-tsha nan-gis brdzed-de thalI have been practicing modesty in solitude and have just naturally gone and forgotten my shame. < previous pagepage_136next page >"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"page_137file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_137.html[8/7/2010 9:53:26 PM]< previous pagepage_137next page >Page 137Such reduplicated constructions have another sense as wellone of completion, of the action of the verb havingalready been accomplished. Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, in his biography of Mi-la ras-pa, often uses nominalizedreduplicated verbs with this sensefor example, bla-mai bka-sog ltar byas-pai yi-ge yum-gyis sna-nas mdzad-mdzad-pa-zig Ndug \"There was a letter, made to resemble a communication from my lama, which my lady hadalready made,\" rab-gnas pan-tshen na-ros grub-grub-pa-zigyin \"This consecration is one that the great scholarNaropa has already done,\" rma gsos-gsos-par bsdad \"I will stay until the wound has finished healing,\" bsam-bloyan btanbtan-ba yin ''I have thought about it already.\"2.1.2.3. Word familiesIt is not hard to find, in Tibetan, groups of words that appear to be phonologically and semantically related,although the exact nature of that relationship is not entirely clearfor example, SKOR \"encircle, surround, enclose,\"SGOR \"turn on a lathe,\" KHOR \"turn around, go about in a circle,\" skor \"circle,'' Nkhor \"circle, circumference,retinue, attendants,\" sgor-mo \"ball, disc, coin, rupee,\" kor-kor \"round,\" kho-ra \"circumference, fence, wall,\" gor-ma \"stones, rubble, boulders.\" In Sino-Tibetan linguistics such a group of words has traditionally been called aWORD FAMILY.We may define a Tibetan word family as a group of lexical items sharing a semantic nucleus and related throughprocesses of inner and outer derivation. Such word families can provide unexpected light on the Tibetan semanticworld. It is clear, for example, that SLA \"be thin\" is to SLA \"be easy\" as SKA \"be thick\" is to DKA \"be difficult.\"Related to NPHYO \"roam about, gambol\" we find both Nphyos-ma \"bride price\" and Nphyon-ma \"prostitute.\" Theword dod \"equivalent\" (as in bu-dod \"son equivalent  adopted son,\" skad-dod \"word equivalent  synonym\") isin the same word family as don \"meaning\"; in just the same way, srid \"dominion, government, world\" is in thesame family as both srin-po \"demon\" and srin-bu \"worm.\"Underlying such word families we can sometimes discern the single semantic nucleus common to all the members:for example, ÑAN \"hear,\" ña-ma \"disciple,\" and gña-bo \"witness, surety\" are all related through the semanticnucleus *ÑA \"HEAR\"; related to that nucleus through s- prefixation is the nucleus *SÑA \"CAUSE TO HEAR,\"which underlies the family SÑAD \"relate, report,\" SÑAN \"be sweet-sounding,\" sñad \"malicious or falseaccusation,\" sñan < previous pagepage_137next page >"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"page_138file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_138.html[8/7/2010 9:53:26 PM]< previous pagepage_138next page >Page 138\"ear,\" sñan-pa \"fame, praise, glory, renown,\" SÑOD \"tell, relate,\" SÑON \"assert falsely, disavow dishonestly.''The search for such semantic nuclei can lead down some intriguing paths. For example, a semantic nucleus *NA\"BE PRESSED, BE BURDENED\" ties together NA \"be ill,\" nad \"illness,\" nan \"urging, pressure, importunity,\"nan-tan \"exertion, application, earnestness,'' and relates these words in turn to SNAD \"hurt, harm, injure,\" NAN\"press, oppress, conquer,\" and GNOD (apparently a generalized G- present stem) \"damage, injure, hurt.\" Thesemantic nucleus of pressure from above brings still further words into the family: thus with the honorific prefixm- we find MNOD \"receive favors or punishment from a superior,\" MNAR \"suffer, be tormented,\" MNA \"oath,\"and perhaps even mnama \"daughter-in-law, bride residing with her husband's family.\" In the Tibetan semanticuniverse, therefore, an oath and a disease are linked through the concept of pressure, and the same concept linkstogether an injury and a favor from a superior. This word family in fact extends into other Sino-Tibetan languagesas well. Thus we find Burmese na \"be ill,\" Lahu na \"be ill,\" Lushei nat \"be in pain, ache,\" Old Chinese *nan\"difficulty, suffering,\" with a further extensionBurmese nat, Akha neh, Lahu ne, Lisu ni, all meaning \"deity,spirit,\" and Old Chinese *nar \"expel demons.\" The SinoTibetan concept of pressure thus reaches from demons todaughters-in-law, and from oaths to injuries, all extending outward from the nucleus *NA.2.2. BorrowingIn addition to its inherited stock of native words, the classical Tibetan lexicon is rich in words borrowed fromevery language of polyglot Inner Asia. The study of such borrowing is especially interesting because linguisticborrowing frequently accompanies cultural borrowing: for example, the Tibetan word dza \"tea\" was borrowed fromMiddle Chinese *jha just as Tibetan tea was borrowed from China. Further, choice of linguistic form can reflectattitudes toward the donor culture. In Tibet, for example, New Tibetan (Lhasa) peskop \"movies\" < Englishbioscope has been replaced by <glog-brñan>\"electric image  movies\" < New Chinese tien-ying. Similarly,New Tibetan (Lhasa) jana \"China\" < Old Tibetan rgya-nag \"black expanse  China,\" with all of its ancientcosmological associations, has been replaced with the transfer tuNko <krun-go>\"China\" < New Chinese chung-kuo \"Central Kingdom.\" < previous pagepage_138next page >"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"page_139file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_139.html[8/7/2010 9:53:27 PM]< previous pagepage_139next page >Page 1392.2.1. TransfersOne type of borrowing is the process we will call TRANSFER, whereby a foreign word or phrase is simplyincorporated wholesale into the lexicon, with more or less adaptation to native phonology and orthography. Indeed,in Tibetan some transfers have been rendered into an orthography indistinguishable from that of native words. Forexample, sku-bde-rigs \"musk\" is actually a transfer of Mongol in highly Tibetanized orthography.26 Suchtransfers may be analyzed by native speakers as if they were Tibetan, and enter into clips as if they. were nativewords. Thus tham-ka \"seal\" is a transfer of the Uighur tamya \"brand mark,\" but is treated as a Tibetan form in -ka,yielding clips like rgyal-tham \"royal seal.'' Similarly, pad-ma \"lotus'' < Sanskrit padma is analyzed as a nativeform in -ma, and enters into such clips as pad-dkar \"white lotus.\"Such Tibetanized transfers may even become the subject of elaborate word play. The Tibetan ba-dur~ba-Ndur~dpa-bdud \"warrior\" is a transfer from Mongol bayatur~badur. In the epic of Ge-sar, the King ofHorMongoliaexhorts his warriors to fight against GlinTibetin the words glin wa-moi Nthab-ya ma-byun-na, horba-Ndur ma-red khyi-Ndur red \"If you do not fight against the foxes of Glin, you are not Mongol warriors (ba-Ndur)but running dogs (khyi-Ndur)!\" Elsewhere in the epic, eighty warriors of Glin are introduced as glin-dkardpa-bdud brgyad-tsu-rnams \"eighty warriors (dpa-bdud) of White Glin.\" A warrior of Hor then defies thesewarriors of Glin and calls them glin-gi khyi-bdud brgyad-tsu de \"those eighty dog-demons (khyi-bdud)of Glin.\"As in many languages, transfers in Tibetan turn up in unexpected places. We find, for example, mig-gi miu \"littleman of the eye  pupil,\" with explanations that relate miu \"little man\" to the reflection of oneself in the eye of aperson one is speaking with; but the word is, simply, a transfer of Middle Chinese \"pupil.\" Similarly, the epichero of Tibet is Ge-sar, usually said to be king of Glin, but sometimes said to be king as well of a land calledKhrom or Phrom. In the word khrom~phrom we can recognize Rome or rum,26 The native Tibetan word for \"musk\" is gla-ba. The compound sku-bde-rigs would normally meansomething like \"species of body happiness,\" and was presumably created with a semantic relationship to\"musk\" in mind. Note that the transfer must have occurred at a time and in a dialect of Middle Tibetanwhere preinitials and finals were no longer pronouncedthus Middle Tibetan kuderi <sku-bde-rigs>. < previous pagepage_139next page >"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"page_140file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_140.html[8/7/2010 9:53:28 PM]< previous pagepage_140next page >Page 140through an eastern Iranian form *from~hrom, from which we find as well the Middle Chinese word for Rome,*phrom~from <>. Rome here means, likely, not Rome itself but Byzantium; and in the word ge-sar wecan recognize also Latin or perhaps its Greek or Byzantine equivalent kaisar, which is also the source of theRussian czar. There is an enormous amount of history in the simple fact that the epic hero of Tibet bears a namederived from that of Caesar of Rome.27The classical Tibetan lexicon has many such transfers from a wide range of source languages. To give some ideaof the scope of such borrowing, we may note a few examples. From PERSIAN we find gur-gum \"saffron\" <Persian kurkum and deb-ther \"document\" < Persian .28From ARABIC we find \"barley liquor\" < Arabic\"date palm sap,'' from TURKISH we find tshu-pa \"robe\" < Turkish juba, from MANCHU we find ''Chinese representative in Lhasa City\" < Manchu amban \"minister,\" and from an unknown but probablyKHOTANESE original we find pi-wan \"lute,\" transferred independently into Middle Chinese as *pyi-pa.29Most Tibetan transfers, however, come from four source languages of cultural27 Such borrowing, of course, works in both directions. The Roman Catholic Church at one timecommemorated a Saint Josaphat on November 27; the Greek Church commemorated the same saint onAugust 26, under the name Ioasaph; and the Georgian Orthodox Church commemorated the Blessedlodasaph on May 19. All the Christian stories of this holy man derive from a Greek version of his life; butthere are also parallel Arabic texts of his story, in which he is called Yuzasaf~Yudasaf-Budhasaf. He is theson of a king, kept imprisoned in a beautiful city so he could not see old age or sickness or death. When hedoes see these things, he goes in search of the eternal, which he finds in Jesus Christ; eventually heconverts India to Christianity. If there is history in the relationship of Tibetan Ge-sar and Roman Caesar,there is history as well in the fact that for many centuries the Bodhisattva was a Christian saint.28 The Persian kurkum \"saffron\" may itself be a transfer from a Semitic language: compare Hebrew karkom,Aramaic kurkama, Arabic kurkum. Similarly, Persian \"document\" may in turn come either from OldPersian dipi \"writing\" or from Greek diphthera \"parchment.\" In the latter case, the Tibetan deb-ther would berelated to the English diphtheria, a disease so named because of the parchment-like covering that forms on theskin.29 Tibetan pi-waan \"lute\" is a very early transfer, already listed in the ninth-century Mahvyutpatti, with thevelar nasal final apparently indicating a Khotanese source. See also Japanese biwa, Mongol biba, Manchu fifan. < previous pagepage_140next page >"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"page_141file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_141.html[8/7/2010 9:53:29 PM]< previous pagepage_141next page >Page 141and political importance in Inner Asia. From UIGHUR we find pag-si \"teacher\" < Uighur baksi,\"physician\"< Uighur and dar ''silk\" < Uighur toryuterms which indicate the culture achieved by speakers of Uighur intheir Central Asian oasis civilization.30 From MONGOL we find, for example, ta-lai ''ocean\" < Mongol dalai, asin ta-lai bla-ma \"Dalai Lama,\" and er-te-ni \"precious stone\" < Mongol , as in pan-tshen er-te-ni \"PanchenLama,\" as well as such terms as ba-dur~ba-Ndur~dpa-bdud \"warrior\" < Mongol bayatur~badur, discussed above,and beg-tse \"coat of mail/name of the God of War\" < Mongol begder.31From CHINESE we find dza \"tea\" < Middle Chinese *jha, spar-kha \"the eight trigrams\" < Middle Chinese *pwat-kwai par-spar~dpar \"printing block\" < Middle Chinese *pwan, gi-wan~giu-wan-Ngi-an~Ngi-sban \"bezoar\" <Middle Chinese , don-tse \"copper coin, money\" < Middle Chinese *dhuntsieven the word for such aculturally common item as ltsog-tse \"table\" < Middle Chinese *cok-tsi.32 And there are, finally, many transfersfrom INDIC LANGUAGES. We find, for example, tsan-dan \"sandal-wood\" < Sanskrit30 The Uighur baksi may itself be a transfer from Middle Chinese *pak-si \"widely-versed teacher.\" It isinteresting to note that words for \"silk\" in many Inner Asian languages apparently come from Uighur ratherthan from Chinesefor example, Jagatai torka, Koibal torga, Mongol torgan, Qata-khoja \"Kashgar silk.\"31 The native Tibetan equivalent of Mongol dalai is rgya-mtsho \"ocean,\" and the word rgya-mtsho has beenan element in the personal names of the last fourteen Dalai Lamas. The Tibetan pan-tshen er-te-ni \"PanchenLama\" consists of a transfer of Mongol \"precious stone,\" which in turn is a transfer into Mongol of theSanskrit ratna \"precious jewel,\" used as the loan translation of Tibetan rin-po-tshe, combined with a clipconsisting of a transfer of Sanskrit pandita \"scholar\" and Tibetan tshen-po \"great\"a three-language collocation!Note also that Mongol begder \"coat of mail\" may itself derive originally from Persian bagtar \"armor.\"32 New Tibetan continues the process of transfer from a number of modern languages, as in New Tibetan(Lhasa) \"Pravda,\" pulisi \"police,\" meli \"mile.\" However, transfers from Chinese have become particularlyprominent: for example, in Tibetan newspapers we find <zi-tsun>\"bacteria\" < New Chinese hsi-chün,<thin>\"department, office\" < New Chinese t'ing, <duu>\"degree, kilowatt hour\" < New Chinese tu,<zan>\"district\" < New Chinese hsien, <tshis-khree>\"automobile\" < New Chinese ch'i-ch'e, <tho-la-tsis>\"tractor\" < New Chinese t'o-la-chi Transfers from Chinese are, as one might expect, often concerned withpolitical as well as with technological mattersfor example, <gun-khran >\"Communist\" < New Chinese kung-ch'an, <gun-khran krun-dbyan >\"Central Committee of the Communist Party\" < New Chinese kung-ch'anchung-yang. < previous pagepage_141next page >"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"page_142file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_142.html[8/7/2010 9:53:30 PM]< previous pagepage_142next page >Page 142candana, bai-du-rya~bai-dur \"lapis lazuli\" < Sanskrit vaidurya, mar-gad-ma-rgad \"emerald\" < Sanskritmarakata, sen-ge ''lion\" < Sanskrit simha or Apabhramsa singhu-simhu, byi-la \"cat\" < Sanskrit bidala~vidalathrough a Prakrit *bila (compare, for example, Hindi billi), mu-tig ''pearl\" < Sanskrit mukta-muktika through aPrakrit *muttika mutik (compare, for example, Apabhramsa mottiyau, Hindi moti), po-ti \"book\" < Sanskrit pusta -pustaka, se-Ndu-ra-sindhu-ra \"vermilion\" < Sanskrit sindura.332.2.2. ReproductionsWhile transfers are simply imported into the lexicon along with the foreign cultural items they name,REPRODUCTIONS attempt to convey the semantic content of the foreign word by using native terms. We candistinguish two types of reproduction. A LOAN TRANSLATION conveys the semantic content of a foreign wordby translating its components into native termsfor example, German Femsprecher \"far speaker\" < Englishtelephone. A LOAN CREATION conveys the semantic content of a foreign word by creating an entirely originalword out of native elements to express the foreign conceptfor example, New Chinese tien-hua \"electric speech\" <English telephone.2.2.2.1. Loan translationsThe classical Tibetan lexicon is poorer in loan translations than in either transfers or loan creations. Occasionallytransfers and loan translations of the same term occur simultaneously: bui Ntsho-ba \"life of the child  a treewhose nuts are strung by parents and hung around their children's necks as protection\" is a loan translation ofSanskrit putrajiva \"life of the child,\" a term that was also transferred into Tibetan in the naturalized orthographyNbo-de-tsiMost loan translations in the classical lexicon come from Chinese sources. We find sgrog-rus \"chain bone  collarbone\" < Chinese so-tzu-ku, rdo-snum \"stone oil  petroleum\" < Chinese shih-yu, mgo-nag \"black-headed  the33 Both Indian sandalwood and Sanskrit candana have entered the cultures of the world: we find Persiancandan~candal, Greek sandanon~santalon, Arabaic sandal, Medieval Latin sandalum-santalum, MiddleChinese .

Loan creationsTibetan has been most resourceful in coining new terms for foreign cultural items. Some of these have been moreor less spontaneousfor example, dkar-yol \"white pottery - porcelain,\" rgya-tshwa \"Chinese salt  salammoniac.\" During the first half of the ninth century, however, a remarkable translation project set out deliberatelyto coin a vast number of loan creations to deal with the new Buddhist cultural terminology coming from India.Traditionally, a Tibetan lo-tsa-ba \"translator\" would learn enough Sanskrit to understand isolated words, simpletexts, and eventually oral explanations. He would then find an Indian pandita who would explain a text to himword by word. It was apparently the lack of standardization in these early laborious translations that led King KhriLde-sron-btsanalso called Sad-na-legs-to commission a panel of Indian panditas and Tibetan translators to compilea dictionary of technical equivalents and to set forth rules for the translation of Sanskrit into Tibetan. After thedeath of the king, his son Khri Gtsug-lde-btsanalso called Ral-pa-tsancontinued the project, finally producing twoworks. One was a dictionary, the Bye-brag-tu rtogs-par byed-pa, better known under its Sanskritized titleMahavyutpatti. The other was a commentary, the Sgra-sbyor bam-po gñis-pa, with the Sanskrit titleMadhyavyutpatti, which functions as a treatise on translation theory and practice. The latter contained the text ofthe royal edict setting forth the general findings of the commission, and a detailed account of the etymologiesunderlying the loan creations entered in the dictionary.For example, the word buddha is rendered by Tibetan sans-rgyas \"awakened expanded\" on the basis of twodifferent Sanskrit etymological glosses34 Loan translations from Chinese still find their way into Tibetan-for example, New Tibetan (Lhasa)tsaklam <ltsags-lam>\"iron road  railway\" < New Chinese t'ieh-lu, New Tibetan (Lhasa) <klog-brñan>\"electric image - movies\" < New Chinese tien-ying. < previous pagepage_143next page >"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"page_144file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_144.html[8/7/2010 9:53:31 PM]< previous pagepage_144next page >Page 144mohanidrapagamat prabuddha-puruavat \"He is like a man who has awakened (prabuddha)because his sleep ofdelusion has vanished,\" and buddher vikasanad buddhah vibuddhapadmavat \"He is Buddha because his mind(buddhi)has opened up like a lotus that has expanded (vibuddha).\"Often it is a doctrinal point that determines the form of a loan creation. In the case of bhagavan \"Blessed One,\" theusual gloss of bhaga as Tibetan legs \"blessing\" is rejected in favor of the etymology bhagnamaracatustayatvadbhagavan \"He is bhagavan because he has conquered (bhagna)the fourfold Evil One.\" Thus bhaga is rendered notby Tibetan legs but rather by btsom ''conquest,'' whichwith Tibetan LDAN \"be endowed\" rendering the Sanskritpossessive -vantyields btsom-ldan \"possessing conquest.\" To this collocation is then added the adjective Ndas < -NDA-S \"passed beyond,\" to differentiate a Ndzig-rten-las Ndas-pa \"transcendent\" < Sanskrit lokottara conquerorfrom an ordinary one who has not conquered the Evil Onethus officially rendering bhagavan by the loan creationbtsom-ldan-Ndas.Reliance on Sanskrit folk etymologies leads occasionally to idiosyncratic loan translations. This rsi \"seer\" isrendered by dran-sron \"straight upright\" on the basis of the folk etymology kayovagmanobhir rjuh sete iti rsih \"Heis rsi because he rests upright ()with body, speech, and mind.\" Similarly, we find pudgala \"person\" given asgan-zag \"full dripping\" based on the scholastic gloss puryate galate caiva pumgala \"It is pudgala because it isfilled ()and then leaks away ().\" Again, arhan \"Worthy One\" is rendered by dgra-btsom-pa \"he who hasconquered his enemies\" on the basis of the etymology klesarin hatavan arhan \"He is arhan because he hasdestroyed ()his enemies (ari)the defilements .\"The following discussion from the Sgra-sbyor bam-po gñis-pa on the proper equivalent for sugata \"Well-goneOne\" is in many ways typical of the Tibetan loan creation process:SugataOn the one hand: sobhanagatah sugatah surupavat \"He is sugata (legs-par gsegs-pa)because he hasbecome beautiful, like one of beautiful form,\" apunaravrttyagatah sugatah sunasta-jvaravat \"He is sugata(legs-par gsegs-pa)because he has gone never to return, like a fever which is well cured,\" yavadganta-vyagamanat sugatah supurnaghatavat \"He is sugata (legs-par gsegs-pa)because he has gone as far as hecan go, like a jar which is well filled.\" < previous pagepage_144next page >"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"page_145file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_145.html[8/7/2010 9:53:32 PM]< previous pagepage_145next page >Page 145On the other hand: we read in the Dharmaskandha, sugata iti sukhito bhagavan svargatahavyathitadharmasamanvagatah tad ucyate sugatah \"The Blessed One has become blissful and is possessedof the bliss of heaven; he is without affliction and is possessed of the quality of nonaffliction.\" Hence wemay render the term as bde-bargsegs-pa \"he who has gone to bliss\" or bde-bar brñes-pa \"he who hasgained bliss.\"Here we will fix the equivalent as bde-bar gsegs-pa because it is traditional and conforms to the text of theDharmaskandha.2.2.3. Mixed formsOccasionally a foreign word or phrase is rendered in Tibetan as a MIXED FORM combining a transfer and atranslation. For example, we find Tibetan Ndzam-bu glin \"jambudvipa  the inhabited world,\" combining atransfer of Sanskrit jambu and native Tibetan glin \"island\" as a loan translation of Sanskrit dvipa. Again, we findTibetan thai-rdze \"lord\" < Chinese t'ai-shih ''Grand Preceptor,\" combining a transfer of Chinese t'ai \"great'' and aloan translation of Chinese shih \"teacher\" by Tibetan rdze \"master.\" Even more interesting is Tibetan rlun-rta\"wind horse  prayer flag\" < Chinese lung-ma \"dragon horse,\" which mixes a Tibetanized transfer of Chinese lung\"dragon\" as rlun \"wind\"-sometimes also written klun \"river\"with a loan translation of Chinese ma \"horse\" byTibetan rta.Another type of mixed form combines a transfer with a native gloss on the meaning of the transferred elementforexample, rma-bya \"peacock\" < Sanskrit mayura plus Tibetan bya \"bird,\" rta-zam \"post station\" < Mongol zam\"post stage, post horse\" plus Tibetan rta \"horse,\" su-ra-khun \"pit\" < Sanskrit surunga \"trench, mine, pit\" through aPrakrit *suranga (compare Hindi surang, Bengali sudang)plus Tibetan khun \"pit.\"3535 Such mixed forms are not uncommon in New Tibetan. For example, in the Lhasa City newspapers wefind <puu-khan >\"ministry\" < New Chinesepu \"ministry\" plus New Tibetan (Lhasa) khan <khan>\"house,\"as in <ltsags-lam puu-khan >\"Ministry of Railways,\" which further combines the mixed form with the loantranslation tsaklam <ltsags-lam >\"iron road  railway\" < New Chinese t'ieh-lu.

BackformsTwo further processes of word formation should be mentioned here, which have in common what we can call therecycling of lexical items. We find DIALECT BORROWING where a word, already in the classical lexicon, isborrowed back into the classical language in a Middle Tibetan dialect form (as in English varmint from a dialectpronunciation of vermin)for example, ltsun-ka \"jackdaw\" from skyun-ka, ltsam \"rafter\" from phyam, mtshor-po\"pretty'' from Nphyor-po, RDZEN \"be naked\" from SGREN, ZOR ''be joined together\" from BYOR. Sometimes sucha borrowing can be detected through spelling doublets which imply that new classical forms have been created toaccount for the borrowed wordfor example, the doublet GRIM-BRIM \"distribute\" reflects alternative attempts toprovide a classical source for a Middle Tibetan word presumably pronounced *Ndrim or *drim or *dim, just as thedoublet Nkhyos-pa-Nphyos-pa \"gift\" reflects similar attempts to naturalize in a suitably classical way a MiddleTibetan word pronounced *Ntshospa or *tshospa or even *chöpa.In BACKFORMATION a new word is created analogically as the source for an existing word-for example, giventhe noun sans-rgyas \"Buddha,\" there is eventually created a verb TSAN-RGYA \"become a Buddha\" as its presumedsource, just as, in English, the verb sculpt was created as the presumed source of the noun sculptor. Suchbackformations are found particularly where the original derivational process has dropped out of use: where thederivation rgan-po \"old\" < RGA \"be old\" or mthon-po \"high\" < MTHO \"be high\" has become opaque, we find thebackformation of the new verbs forms RGAN \"be old\" and MTHON \"be high\" as the presumed sources of theadjectives. Again, in the formation of diminutives, original low back vowels become the low front vowel e. Whenthis phonological change no longer seems a natural one, we find, for example, ste-po \"axe\" as a backformationfromthat is, a presumed source forsteu \"hatchet,\" which actually comes from sta-ri-sta-gri \"axe,\" and perhaps, inthe same way, even lte-ba \"navel\" < *lteu < lto-ba \"belly\" and sñe \"extremity, end\" < *sneu < sna \"nose.\"(foontnote continued from previous page)Chinese ch 'i-ch'e \"automobile\" plus New Tibetan (Lhasa) tshuntsun <tshun-tshun >\"small,\" <rdul-phransbom>\"atom bomb\" < English bomb plus New Tibetan (Lhasa) <rdulphran>\"tiny particle  atom.\" < previous pagepage_146next page >"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"page_147file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_147.html[8/7/2010 9:53:34 PM]< previous pagepage_147next page >Page 1472.3. Imitations2.3.1. InterjectionsA third source of new words in Tibetan is the IMITATION of natural sounds. The most directly imitative wordsare those that attempt to reproduce spontaneous INTERJECTIONSfor example, kye \"hey!\" ho-ho \"wow!\" he-he\"ha-ha!''\"a ha!'' tsos-tsos \"tsk tsk.\" The classical language also makes use of an INTERJECTIONFORMATIVE - in such interjections as \"INTERJECTION OF DELIGHT,\" \"INTERJECTIONOF PLEASURE,\" \"INTERJECTION OF PITY,\" \"INTERJECTION OF SURPRISE,\" \"INTERJECTION OF SEXUAL SATISFACTION,\" \"INTERJECTION OF WONDER,\" a-ra\"INTERJECTION OF PHYSICAL PAIN,\" and so on.Some interjections with -appear to derive from other formsthus MTSHAR \"be beautiful\"-mtshar\"INTERJECTION OF WONDER,\" NA \"be sick\" na-na \"INTERJECTION OF GRIEF,\" *KHAG \"berotten\" \"INTERJECTION OF CONTEMPT,\" TSHA \"be hot\" \"INTERJECTION OF PAIN OCCASIONED BY HEAT.\" Such derivation is not always clear: for example, \"INTERJECTION OF PAIN OCCASIONED BY COLD\" may have a distant semantic relationwith tshu \"water,\" or may be pure sound imitation, as in English ah-choo! We may note that the Tibetan name forone of the cold hells is \"where people say .\"2.3.2. OnomatopoeiaOne step away from representing human sounds is representing non-human sounds. There are several words in theclassical lexicon that are clearly ONOMATOPOEICkhrum-khrum \"CRUNCHING OF A PESTLE,\" tsag-tsag\"SMACKING OF THE LIPS,\" tsor-tsor \"FIZZING OF BEER,\" tshem-tshem \"CRASHING OF THUNDER,\"thrig-thrig \"SQUEAKING OF SHOES,\" si-si \"SOUND OF WHISTLING,\" ur-ur \"BUZZING SOUND,\" nar-nar\"HOARSE WHEEZING SOUND,\" meao \"SOUND OF A CAT.\" A few of these forms may ultimately derive fromreduplicated verbs: for example, compare GYEN \"move back and forth\" with yen-yen \"SOUND OF STRUGGLE,\"KROL \"ring, resound\" with khrol-khrol \"SOUND OF CLANGING METAL,\" HRAL \"rip up, tear to pieces\" withhrul-hrul \"SOUND OF RIPPING OR TEARING,\" and DZIB \"suck\" with tsib-tsib \"SLURPING OR SUCKINGNOISE,\" in the following verses, found in two archaic Central Asian manuscripts: < previous pagepage_147next page >"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"page_148file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_148.html[8/7/2010 9:53:34 PM]< previous pagepage_148next page >Page 148gnam-dan sa Nthab yen-yen dam-dam ltshags-dan zans Nthab khrol-khrol sil-silEarth fought with sky, yen-yen dam-dam Copper fought with iron, khrol-khrol sil-silsa bya za ni hrul-hrul khrag sa Nthun ni tsib-tsib rus-pa gle Ntsha ni khrum-khrum mgo-spu rdzis khyer ni ban-banHis flesh the birds eat yes: hrul-hrul His blood the earth drinks yes: tsib-tsib His bones the boulders gnaw yes: khrum-khrum His hair the wind carries away yes: ban-banSuch onomatopoeic terms also enter into compoundsfor example, ku-sgra \"the sound ku clamor,\" tsheg-sgra \"thesound tsheg crackling,\" si-sgra \"the sound si  whistling,\" ur-rdo ''stone that goes ur  slingshot,\" nar-skad''the cry nar roar of a lion.\"Onomatopoeic terms are also used to signify the beings or objects that make the particular sound-thus rtsi-rtsi~tsi-tsi \"mouse,\" pi-pi \"flute,\" ku-ku-sgrogs \"grey duck.\" Perhaps also in this class are nan-pa \"goose\" and krun-krun~khrun-khrun \"crane,\" but the latter seems related as well to Sanskrit krauñca.Often the onomatopoeia is lexicalized with a verbthus tseg-tseg BYA \"make the sound tseg-tseg  rustle like dryleaves,\" sug-sug RGOD \"laugh sug-sug?laugh loudly,\" nan-nan ZER \"say nan-nan cackle like a goose,\" zun-zunBYA \"make the sound zun-zun -bow repeatedly like a pigeon,\" hub-hub BYA \"make the sound hub-hub gulpdown in large drafts,\" hab-hob ZA~ha-be ho-be ZA \"eat hab-hob gobble greedily.\"2.3.3. Poetic word playOf particular interest is a set of stereotyped onomatopoeic terms used in Tibetan poetry from very early times.

Such constructionsapparently date backas do the A-se-A constructionsto very early poetic conventions. In the archaic Central Asianmanuscripts, for example, we find such verses as the following:spyan rlan-ma-rlin ltshags ldab-ma-ldib thugs rman-ma-rmonEyes moist moist Tongue stutter stutter Heart despair despairAs with the A-se-A forms, this type of onomatopoeia is found primarily in archaizing poetic styles.

Honorifics2.4.1. The use of honorificsHONORIFICS in classical Tibetan form an interesting part of the lexicon. Observe the following pairs ofpropositionsdmag-mi rta-la zon \"The soldier rides on a horse\" dmag-dpon tshibs-la Ntshibs \"The general rides ona horse,\" zin-pas zan za \"The farmer eats food\" sprul-skus bsos gsol \"The incarnation eats food,\" khol-pos tshu-lakha Nkhrud \"The servant washes his face in water\" rgyal-pos tshab-la zal bsil \"The king washes his face inwater.\" < previous pagepage_152next page >"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"page_153file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_153.html[8/7/2010 9:53:37 PM]< previous pagepage_153next page >Page 153In the classical lexicon we find certain pairs of wordssuch as rta/tshibs \"horse,\" tshu/tshab \"water,\" kha/zal \"face,\"ZON/TSIB \"ride,\" ZA/GSOL ''eat'' that are denotatively synonymous save only that one of the pair is honorific:words that are marked as honorific are used to refer respectfully to the person and possessions of those of highersocial or spiritual rank, while words unmarked as honorific are used in reference to the person and possessions ofthose of equal or lower rank.There is considerable variation in the use of such honorific words: the frequency and distribution of honorifics infact constitutes part of the register of a piece of writing and the style of a particular author. The studied andfrequent use of appropriate honorifics is characteristic of formal, urbane, and literary registers, while minimal usesignals registers that are informal, folk, and colloquial.No classical text, however, will eschew honorifics entirely. As early as in the ninth-century translation guide Sgra-sbyor bam-po giiis-pa we read that Ze-sa \"honorific words\" must always be used in translating from Sanskrit anyreference to the Buddha. That this rule was thenceforth followed can be seen by comparing the old Khotanesemanuscript translation of the Saddharma-pundarika with the revised canonical version: the revisers of the text tookcare to replace such verbs as the older SKYE \"be born\" with its honorific equivalent LTAM, the older BGYI \"do\"with the honorific MDZAD, the older MYED < *ma-YOD \"be without\" with the honorific mi-MNA.2.4.2. Elegance and social vectorIt is important to distinguish such honorifics from both ELEGANT SPEECH and SOCIAL VECTOR VERBS. Inthe first case we find that several words of common occurrence are paired with words that are synonymous exceptfor being ELEGANT-that is, they constitute an indicator of refined or elevated speech, as in LAGS instead of YIN\"be,\" MTHIS instead of YOD \"exist,\" GDA instead of NDUG \"stay,\" MTSHI instead of NGRO \"go,\" BGYI insteadof BYA \"do,\" bdag instead of ha \"I.\" Thus when the young Mi-la first meets his future master Mar-pa, he declaresbla-ma rin-po-tshe bdag stod-kyi mi sdig-po-tshe-zig lags \"0 precious lama, I am a man from the west who is agreat sinner,\" using an elevated lexical pattern that Mar-pa quickly punctures with indifference: the author has usedhis lexical resources to tell us something about the young protagonist's personality and attitudes. < previous pagepage_153next page >"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"page_154file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_154.html[8/7/2010 9:53:37 PM]< previous pagepage_154next page >Page 154In the second case we find verbs that have SOCIAL VECTORS as part of their semantic content. Thus the verbPUL means \"give from below upwards  offer\" and GNAN means \"give from above downwards  bestow,\" whileTAN \"give'' is unmarked for social vector; we may add that the nondirectional verb TAN \"give\" has the honorificequivalent STSAL. Similarly, ZU means \"speak from below upwards,\" GSUN means ''speak from abovedownwards,\" and BYA means \"speak horizontally.\" In texts that recount conversations between interlocutors ofunequal rank, it is possible to keep track of who is talking not only by the presence of absence of honorifics butalso by the social vector of the verbs of speaking: for example, Mi-la will ZU to Mar-pa and his wife, Mar-pa willGSUN to his wife and to Mi-la, his wife will ZU to Mar-pa but GSUN to Mi-la, and Mi-la will BYA to shepherdboys.2.4.3. Primary honorificsWe can distinguish two types of honorific: a PRIMARY HONORIFIC is a lexical item usually unrelatedetymologically to the corresponding nonhonorific but marked as its honorific equivalent through a gradual processof semantic specialization; a SECONDARY HONORIFIC is a collocation consisting of a lexical item marked ashonorific preceding an unmarked lexical item to yield a form which is honorific as a whole.To illustrate primary honorifics we may listwith the honorific lexical items secondsuch noun pairs as lus/sku\"body,\" mgo/dbu \"head,\" mig/spyan \"eye,\" rus/gdun \"bone,\" ma/sñan \"ear,\" sna/sans \"nose,\" kha/zal \"face,\"Ndzin/mgrin \"neck,\" lag/phyag \"hand,\" rkan/zabs \"foot,\" ltse/ldzags \"tongue,\" khrag/mtshal \"blood,\" yid/thugs\"mind,\" sñinthugs \"heart,\" pha/yab \"father,\" malyum \"mother,\" bu/sras \"son,\" khan/khyim \"house,\" rtaltshibs\"horse,\" tshu/tshab \"water,\" gtam/bka \"discourse\"; such verb pairs as NDUG/BZUGS \"stay,\" YIN/LAGS \"be,\"YOD/MNA \"exist,\" BYA/MDZAD \"do,\" ON/PHEB \"come,\" NGRO/PHEB \"go,\" SES/ MKHYEN \"know,\"MTHON/GZIGS \"see,\" ZON/TSIB \"ride\"; and such personal determiner pairs as na/ned \"I,\" khyod/khyed \"you,\"kho/khon \"he.\"A lexical item may thus have both an elegant and an honorific equivalent for example, the unmarked na \"I\" withboth the honorific equivalenty ned and the elegant equivalent bdag. We can list some examples as follows: < previous pagepage_154next page >"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"page_155file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_155.html[8/7/2010 9:53:38 PM]< previous pagepage_155next page >Page 155UNMARKEDELEGANTHONORIFIC\"stay\"NDUGGDABZUGS\"be\"YINLAGSLAGS\"exist\"YODMTSHISMNA\"go\"NGROMTSHIPHEB\"do\"BYABGYIMDZAD\"die\"TSIGUMGRON\"I\"nabdagned2.4.4. Denotation and connotationWe have said that honorifics are DENOTATIVELY synonymous with their nonhonorific equivalents; honorificsmay, however, differ CONNOTATIVELY from their corresponding nonhonorifics. Such connotative differencesmay arise simply as a result of honorific usage. The term bos, for example, is the honorific equivalent of zan\"food,\" and is used frequently in ritual to refer to food offered to the god; it thus comes to connote an offering,food given to a deity, even when it denotes simply the food of a socially superior person. Again, in contemplativecontexts, where a meditator visualizes his body as that of a god, the nonhonorific term lus \"body\" will be used torefer to the meditator's body and the honorific term sku \"body\" will be used to refer to the body of the god. Hencethe former term acquires connotations of imperfection, actuality, and mutability, while the latter term acquiresconnotations of perfection, potentiality, and significance. Whether one chooses to TRANSLATE such termsdenotatively or connotatively into English is of course another question.Connotative differences may also arise as a result of the extension of the honorific term. It is not infrequently thecase that a single lexical item serves as the honorific equivalent of several nonhonorifics: where this occurs thehonorific term will assume a connotative breadth lacking in any single corresponding nonhonorific term. Forexample, thugs is the honorific equivalent of both yid \"mind\" and sñin \"heart,\" and thus in either use carriessomething of the cognitive and affective connotations of both terms. Similarly, the honorific verb MKHYENfunctions as the honorific equivalent of several nonhonorific verbs denoting mental actionsSES \"know,\" RIG''perceive,\" GO ''understand\"and is thus connotatively more broad than any one of them. < previous pagepage_155next page >"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"page_156file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_156.html[8/7/2010 9:53:38 PM]< previous pagepage_156next page >Page 156The exclamation bla-ma mkhyen \"The lama knows!\" is in a sense irreducible to any one nonhonorific equivalent.Connotative differences may, finally, arise as a result of the derivation of the honorific term. The verb BSIL, forexample, has the original meaning \"be cool\" (as in the paraphrase coordination bsil-zin gran \"cool and cold\"), andcomes eventually to function as the honorific equivalent of the verb KRU \"wash''thus, oxymoronically, tshab dron-mo-la sku bsil \"He washes his honorable body in warm water.\" The honorific term, even while denoting the sameaction as the nonhonorific term, still retains historical connotations of refreshment and renewal. Similarly, thenonhonorific expression ro SREG ''burn a corpse\" has the honorific equivalent spur DZU, which denotes preciselythe same activity: yet the verb DZU retains its original sense of \"melt, digest, dissolve,\" and connotatively suggeststhe ethereal insubstantiality of the honorable remains.2.4.5. EuphemismSuch uses, we may note, pass easily over into EUPHEMISM. The unmarked verb TSI \"die\" has the elegantequivalent GUM and the honorific equivalent GRON. Yet we also find the use of such euphemistic equivalents asGSEGS \"depart,\" bde-bar GSEGS \"depart to bliss,\" gnam-du GSEGS \"depart to heaven,\" Zi-bar GSEGS \"depart topeace,\" sku-NDA \"transcend the body,\" dgons-pa RDZOGS \"complete his intentions,\" and zin-la PHEB \"go to theBuddhafield.\" A similar type of euphemism is used by the young Mi-la when speaking of his master Mar-pa.Where Mar-pa speaks of himself as tshan-gis bzi \"getting drunk on beer,\" Mi-la speaks of him as phud-kyis Nbad\"striving with drink offerings.\"2.4.6. Secondary honorificsA SECONDARY HONORIFIC is formed by joining an unmarked lexical item with one marked as honorific toyield a form which is honorific as a whole. This process has been remarkably productive. Thus the honorific sku\"body\" may be prefixed to any number of unmarked lexical items referring to parts, states, and appurtenances ofthe body to produce compounds denotatively synonymous with the original lexical items except that they are nowhonorificthus sku-mkhar \"castle,\" sku-tshe \"lifetime,\" sku-dpun \"shoulder,\" sku-tshad \"fever,\" sku-rus \"bone,\" sku-tshab \"representative,\" sku-rags \"girdle,\" sku- < previous pagepage_156next page >"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"page_157file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_157.html[8/7/2010 9:53:39 PM]< previous pagepage_157next page >Page 157tshas \"supplies,\" sku-khams \"health,\" sku-sa \"flesh,\" sku-bsod ''virtue.\" The honorific dbu \"head'' is similarlyprefixed in dbu-skra \"hair,\" dbu-rnas \"pillow,\" dbu-thod \"cap,\" dbu-rmog \"helmet,\" dbu-zwa \"hat,\" the honorificphyag \"hand\" in phyag-Nkhar \"staff,\" phyag-rgya \"seal,\" phyag-nar \"wrist,\" phyag-mtheb \"thumb,\" phyag-rten\"gift,\" phyag-dpe \"book,\" phyag-mdzub \"finger,\" phyag-Nbris \"writing,\"phyag-lan \"greeting,\" the honorific zabs\"foot\" in zabs-gdan \"carpet,\" zabs-bro \"dance,\" zabs-sen \"toenail,\" zabs-lham \"boot,\" and the honorific thugs\"heart, mind\" in thugs-ñams \"spirit,\" thugs-sro \"anger,\" thugs-bzod \"patience,\" thugs-Nthad \"pleasure,\" thugs-dgons \"thought,\" thugs-brtse \"love.\"Similarly, when an honorific replaces a nonhonorific within an existing compound, the entire compound becomeshonorific: here we may listwith the honorific compounds secondsuch pairs as kha-lta/zal-lta \"mouth viewinstructions,\" mig-tshu/spyan-tshu \"eye water  tears,\" mig-ltsibs/spyan-ltsibs \"eye covering  eyelid,\" mig-Nbras/spyan-Nbras \"eye fruit - eyeball,\" yi-dam/ thugs-dam \"mind bond  oath,\"yi-mug/thugs-mug \"minddarkness  despair,\" yid-tshes/thugs-tshes \"expanded mind  belief,\" sñin-rus/thugs-rus \"heart bone  courage,\"sñin-rdelthugs-rdze \"noble heart  compassion,\" lag-sha/phyagtsha \"hand thing  implement,\" lag-phyis/phyag-phyis \"hand cloth  towel,\" lag-rtags/phyag-rtags \"hand sign  fingerprint,\" lag-len/phyag-len \"hand taking practical experience,\" lag-mthil/phyag-mthil \"hand bottom  palm,\" rkanmthil/zabs-mthil \"foot bottom  sole,\"rkan-DRAN/zabs-DRAN \"pull the foot  disgrace.\"The use of such honorifics again constitutes part of the style of an author; and many idiosyncratic secondaryhonorific compounds are not found in the current dictionaries.

InSanskrit, for example, progressive voicing assimilation between contiguous words takes place regardless of thegrammatical class of the word involved; thus we find both asit raja > asid raja \"There was a king,\" where the finalof a verb assimilates to the initial of a noun, and vak bhramyati > vag bhramyati \"The speech is excited,\" wherethe final of a noun assimilates to the initial of a verb.On the other hand, some conditioned phonological changes may take place only in particular classes or subclassesof words; where a sound change is phonologically conditioned, but the description of the change must containmorphological information, we speak of MORPHOPHONOLOGICAL change. Tibetan inflectional morphologyoften involves such morphophonological changes.For example, several Tibetan particles undergo sound changes conditioned by the final or postfinal of theimmediately preceding syllable. Thus the coordinative conjunction \"AND\" has the form -sin after preceding finalor postfinal -s, the form -tsin after any other preceding final obstruent, and the form -zin after any preceding finalsonorant; but the initials of such NOUNS as zin \"field,\" sin ''tree,\" and tson \"bell\" remain unchanged regardless ofwhat precedes them.1 A description of the sound change would have to specify the grammatical class of the wordswhich undergo it: hence the sound change is morphophonological.Phonemes which undergo morphophonological changes we will call MORPHOPHONEMES, and we will indicatesuch morphophonemes by writing them in capital letters. For example, we will write the adversative conjunction\"BUT\" as -KYan, with the onset capitalized, to showas opposed, say, to the noun kyan \"wild donkey,\" without thecapitalizationthat the form undergoes1 The Tibetan word tson \"bell\" is borrowed from Middle Chinese *tsywon \"bell.\" The fact that the wordwas borrowed does not, I believe, affect its morphophonological status. < previous pagepage_160next page >"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"page_161file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_161.html[8/7/2010 9:53:42 PM]< previous pagepage_161next page >Page 161morphophonological change, and the morphophoneme in question is the onset cluster. Similarly, we will write thenominalizer -Pa with an initial capital, since the initial is a morphophoneme which regularly becomes b aftercertain preceding syllable finals and p after others; the syllabic formative -pa \"PERSON HAVING TO DO WITH\"undergoes no such changes.Verbs also undergo morphophonological changes. The inflectional prefix G- becomes d- before grave initials in theverb root and g- before acute initials; similarly, a voiced stop initial in the verb root becomes voiceless after theinflectional prefix b-; and the vowel A- in the verb root becomes o in the imperative stem. Those inflectionalaffixes which undergo morphophonological changes we will, again, write in capitals; and we will write verb rootsentirely in capitals as well. Not every part of every verb root, it is true, is a morphophoneme; but capitalizing theentire root will simultaneously prevent recurring typographical oddities and serve as a signal that the cited form is ahypothetical root rather than an attested stem. Thus, for example, an affricate initial in a verb root may become thecorresponding fricative in absolute initial positionthat is, after the inflectional prefix -, as in zugs < -DZUG-s\"entered.\" But the rule applies only to verb roots, as we have indicated by the capitalization: the past stem -DZUG-s \"entered\" is zugs, but the noun dza \"tea\" does not thereby become *za, nor the noun dzo-bo \"lord\"become *zo-bo.1. Inflection within Syllables1.1. TenseWhen a verb is given a TENSE, the tense is indicated by various more or less regular changes in the phonologicalshape of the verb. These morphophonological changes constitute the inflectional morphology of the Old Tibetanverb. A verb may have a maximum of four such distinct phonological shapes: for example, we findNthu/btus/btu/thus as the four forms of the verb we cite as TU \"gather,\" and gtsod/btsad/gtsad/tshod as the fourforms of the verb we cite as TSAD \"cut.\" These four forms of the verb in its most complete paradigm have beennamed da-lta \"present,\" Ndas-pa \"past,\" ma-ons-pa \"future,'' and skul-tshig ''imperative\" by the Tibetangrammarians.

Roots And StemsA terminological distinction may be made between roots and stems. A STEM is one of the tense forms that a verbis observed to take; a ROOT is an underlying form that is hypothesized to account most economically for theobserved tense stems. For example, given the present stem Nkhro \"is angry\" and the past stem khros \"was angry,\"we can postulate the underlying root KHRO ''be angry\" from which the two stems are derived by prenasalizationand -s suffixation respectively.

Forexample, the realization rule that the present stem of an intransitive verb is formed by prenasalizing the rootproduces the present stem ?Nren from the intransitive root REN \"be stiff.\" It is thus necessary to haveADJUSTMENT RULES whereby the stems produced by the realization rules can be adjusted into acceptableforms. For example, it is an adjustment rule that blocks prenasalization before nonstopped phonemes; thus thepresent stem ?Nren is adjusted to the present stem ren \"is stiff.\" Some adjustment rules operate as well on stemsthat are otherwise acceptable.Adjustment rules use two different processes to adjust into acceptable form the stems produced by the realizationrules: when a realizational rule has added an inflectional affix, an adjustment rule may alter either the affix or theroot. On the one hand, for example, prenasalizing the root REN \"be stiff' produces the unacceptable syllable ?Nrenas the present stem; an adjustment rule blocks the prenasalization to yield the acceptable syllable ren < N-REN. Wewill call such adjustment rules AFFIX RULES. On the other hand, for example, prenasalizing the root TU \"gather\"produces the unacceptable syllable ?Ntu as the present stem; an adjustment rule then aspirates the initial of the rootto yield the acceptable syllable Nthu < N-TU. We will call such adjustment rules ROOT RULES.1.4. Transitive and Intransitive VerbsThroughout the grammar of Old Tibetan there is a pervasive distinction between TRANSITIVE andINTRANSITIVE verbs. These verbs are distinguished semantically, syntactically, and derivationally. They are alsodistinguished inflectionally: intransitive verbs do not have future or imperative stems; intransitive verbs do notform their past stem with a b- prefix. The distinction between those verbs that form their past stem with a b-prefixthat is, transitive verbs-and those that do not form their past stem with a b- prefixthat is, intransitive verbs-isthus the primary distinction in verbal types. We may separate b-prefixing verbs from -prefixing verbs as thefundamental division of the verbal system. < previous pagepage_163next page >"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"page_164file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_164.html[8/7/2010 9:53:43 PM]< previous pagepage_164next page >Page 1641.5. ParadigmsWhen the realization rules are set out systematically they constitute what we can conveniently considerPARADIGMS for Old Tibetan verb inflection. INTRANSITIVE VERBS signal the present stem by prenasalizationand the past stem with the -s suffix. We can therefore set out the following intransitive verb paradigm:PRESENTN________PAST________SThe inflection of TRANSITIVE VERBS in Old Tibetan is more complex than that of intransitive verbs. Transitiveverbs have additional distinctive forms for future and imperative stems; and there are four different transitiveparadigms, depending on how the present and future stems are formed. We can distinguish transitive verbs thatsignal the future stem with a b- prefix from those that signal the future stem with a G- prefix; we can distinguishtransitive verbs that signal the present stem with a G- prefix from those that signal the present stem withprenasalization. All transitive verbs signal the past stem with a b- prefix and -s suffix. The following are thus thefour Old Tibetan transitive verb paradigms:PRESENTPASTFUTUREIMPERATIVECLASS 1N_______b_______sb______________sCLASS 2N_______b_______sG______________sCLASS 3G_______b_______sb______________sCLASS 4G_______b_______sG______________sTransitive verbs have two additional realization rules: (1) the present stem of Class 3 and Class 4 incorporates aROUNDING RULE which changes a spread vowel in the root into a rounded vowel in the stem;2 and (2) theimperative2 The ROUNDING RULE changes a spread vowel to a rounded vowel, leaving all other features of thevowel the same. The rule thus does not affect the BACK ROUNDED vowels u and o. The rule does affectthe FRONT SPREAD vowels i and e, but the resulting FRONT ROUNDED vowels ü and ö become theFRONT SPREAD vowels i and e again by the operation of Rule 1; so the sole visible effect of the rule is tochange the BACK SPREAD vowel a to the BACK ROUNDED vowel o.(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_164next page >"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"page_165file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_165.html[8/7/2010 9:53:44 PM]< previous pagepage_165next page >Page 165stem of all classes incorporates both the ROUNDING RULE and an ASPIRATION(footnote continued from previous page)Several considerations support the postulation of this rule as part of the verbal paradigm. In many cases,nouns that are related to an affected verb have the vowel a rather than the o of the present stem of the verb;frequently cognate verbs in other Tibeto-Burman languages also have the vowel a rather than the o of thepresent stem. For example, given the nominals tshad-pa \"punishment\" and tshad-po \"torn,\" and theintransitive verb TSHAD (mtshad/tshad)\"be cut,\" we can independently postulate the transitive root TSAD''cut\" underlying the stems gtsod/btsad/gtsad/tshod, and attribute the vowel o in the present and imperativestems to the operation of the rounding rule. This transitive verb TSAD can then also be compared with suchforms as Lushei tSat \"cut.\" Similarly, the transitive root SAD ''kill\" can be postulated as underlying thestems gsod/bsad/bsad/sod, and that root then compared with such forms as Burmese sat \"kill.\"In many cases, the present stem of a transitive verb appears with an o vowel, but the present stem G- prefixhas been blocked by an adjustment rule. For example, we can postulate the transitive root SKAN \"fulfill\"underlying the stems skoi/bskans/bskan/skons, with the present stem skon < G-skon < G-SKAN by an affixrule; this root SKAN can then be compared with such nouns as skan-ba \"satisfaction.\" Similarly, we canpostulate the transitive root RGYAN \"stretch\" underlying the stems rgyon/brgyans/brgya/rgyons, once againwith the present stem rgyon < G-rgyon < G-RGYAN by a regular rule; and this root RGYAN can then similarlybe compared with such nouns as rgyan-ma \"distance.\"It is tempting to see the present stem prefix G- and the imperative stem suffix -s as somehow phonologicallyresponsible for the rounding of the vowel nucleus. Yet we find perfectly acceptable syllables such as gdan\"seat,\" dban \"power,\" and nags \"forest\" where the nucleus a remains spread despite the presence of a preinitialG- or postfinal -s. Similarly, in the future stem of Class 2 and Class 4 transitive verbs we find perfectlyacceptable future stems such as gtsad < G-TSAD \"will cut,\" gsad < G-SAD \"will kill,\" dbrad < G-BRAD \"willscratch,\" and dbral < G-bral < G-PHRAL \"will separate,\" where the a vowel remains spread despite thepresence of an inflectional G- prefix; and, in all past stems, we find perfectly acceptable forms such as bskyags< b-SKYAG-s \"spent\" and btags < b-TAG-s \"ground,\" where the a vowel remains spread despite the presenceof an inflectional -s suffix.It is thus probably true that the rounding rule is not phonologically conditioned, but applies independently ofany affix. An alternative way of describing the rule would be to postulate a phoneme of lip rounding *W(much as N is a phoneme of velum lowering) which rounds any vowel in the same syllable. We could thenpropose such derivations as gsod < G-sod < *GW-SAD for the present stem of the root SAD \"kill,\" and smros< smro-s < *SMRA-Ws for the imperative stem of the root SMRA \"speak.\" Similarly, where the G- or -s isblocked by an adjustment rule, we could propose such derivations as skyob < G-skyob < *GW-SKYAB for thepresent stem of the root SKYAB \"protect,\" and sod < sod-s < *SAD-WS for the imperative stem of the rootSAD \"kill.\" < previous pagepage_165next page >"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"page_166file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_166.html[8/7/2010 9:53:44 PM]< previous pagepage_166next page >Page 166RULE, which changes unaspirated oral stopped initials in the root into aspirated initials in the stem.31.6. Affix RulesUnder the realization rules, four affixes are added to verb roots to form tense stemsthe prefixes b-, G-, and N- (orprenasalization), and the suffix -s. In some instances, the resulting stem needs virtually no adjustment to beacceptable under the syllable structure constraints: for example, from the intransitive root KHRO \"be angry\" wefind the present stem Nkhro < N-KHRO \"is angry\" and the past stem khros < KHRO-s \"was angry,\" from the Class3 transitive root SAG \"gather'' we find the present stem gsog < G-SAG ''gathers,\"3 The ASPIRATION RULE operates to aspirate any verb root initial which can be aspirated withoutviolating either phoneme or syllable structure constraints. The rule applies only to oral stopped initialswithout preinitials-for example, thus < TU-s \"gather!\" tshums < DZUM -s \"shut!\" khums < GUM-s \"kill!\"phigs < PIG-s \"pierce!\" The rule does not function to aspirate nonstopped or nasal consonants: thus we findzos < ZA-S \"eat!\" and not ?zhos, sos < so-s \"feed!\" and not ?shos, and ñon < NAN-s \"listen!\" and not?ñhon. And the rule does not apply where there is a preinitial before an otherwise affected root initial: thuswe find skyogs < SKYAG-s \"spend!\" and not ?skhyogs, ltos < LTA-s \"look!\" and not ?lthos, and dpogs <DPAG-s \"measure!\" and not ?dphogs. Indeed, we even find Ndoms < NDAM-s \"choose!\" instead of theotherwise acceptable syllable Nhoms, and mdzod < MDZAD-S \"do!\" instead of the otherwise acceptablesyllable mtshod.In addition, there are two further exceptions. The rule does not apply to verb roots with the initial cluster DR,since this would produce the unacceptable output cluster ?thr. Thus we find dris < DRI-s \"ask!\" and not ?thris,as opposed, say, to khrol < GROL-s \"release!\" And, for reasons I do not understand, the rule does not apply toany verb root with initial B. Thus we find bor < BOR-s \"fling!\" instead of the otherwise acceptable phor,byugs < BYUG-s \"moisten!\" instead of the otherwise acceptable phyugs, and bris < BRI-s \"write!\" instead ofthe otherwise acceptable phris. Apart from this last exception, it seems clear that the aspiration rule in somesense looks forward to its output, and does not apply at all where its output would require adjustment.It is, by the way, an attractive speculation that the aspiration of absolute syllable initials in imperative stemshas something to do, phonologically, with the emphasis normally given the expression of a command; but Iknow of no evidence bearing one way or the other on that point. We might, rashly, propose something like aphoneme of emphasis, parallel to the phoneme of lip rounding *W, which is manifested phonetically asaspiration in certain environments, and which is part of the realization rule for imperative stems. < previous pagepage_166next page >"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"page_167file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_167.html[8/7/2010 9:53:45 PM]< previous pagepage_167next page >Page 167the past stem bsags < b-SAG-s \"gathered,\" the future stem bsag < b-SAG \"will gather,\" and the imperative stemsogs < SAG-s \"gather!'' In many cases, however, the resulting stem requires adjustment into acceptable form. Forexample, prenasalizing the transitive root SUB ''plug up\" produces the unacceptable present stem ?Nsub, which isadjusted, by blocking the prefix, to the acceptable sub \"plugs up.\" Similarly, adding the inflectional prefix b- andsuffix -s to the transitive root ÑO \"buy\" produces the unacceptable past stem ?bños, which is adjusted, by blockingthe prefix, to the acceptable ños \"bought.\"1.6.1. The prefix N-Since prenasalization can occur only before oral consonants, the prefix N- is blocked before nasal initials in theverb root-for example, ño < N-ÑO \"buys,\" mid < N-MID \"swallows,\" nu < N-NU \"sucks.\" Similarly, since onlystopped consonants can be prenasalized, the prefix N- is blocked before fricatives and glidesfor example, sud < N-SUD \"rubs,\" za < N-ZA \"eats,\" ren < N-REN \"is stiff,\" yon < N-YON \"comes.\"4 Finally, since only initials can beprenasalized, the prefix N- is blocked before any preinitialfor example, rku < N-RKU \"steals,\" snol < N-SNOL\"intertwines,\" lta < N-LTA \"looks at.\"1.6.2. The prefix G-Since G- cannot be a pre-preinitial, the prefix G- is blocked before any preinitialfor example, skon < G-SKAN\"fulfills,\" rtog < G-RTAG \"examines,\" slob < G-SLAB \"teaches,\" dpog < G-DPAG \"measures.\" Most important,the prefix G- undergoes GRAVITY DISSIMILATION according to the initial of the root to which it is affixed:before an ACUTE initial the prefix G- becomes the GRAVE preinitial g-, and before a GRAVE preinitial theprefix G- becomes the ACUTE preinitial d-. Thus we find, for example, gtad < G-TAD \"will deliver\" but dkrol <G-KROL \"will ring,\" gdul < G-DUL \"will tame\" but dgod < G-GOD \"will array,\" gdud < G-DUD \"will bend\" butdbud < G-BUD \"will blow.\"4 Note, however, in several verbs, ld < N-L-for example, ldan < N-LAN \"arises,\" ldon < N-LON \"is blind,\"ldug < N-LUG \"pours,\" Idud < N-LUD \"waters.\" We will discuss this rule later on in this chapter. < previous pagepage_167next page >"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"page_168file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_168.html[8/7/2010 9:53:45 PM]< previous pagepage_168next page >Page 1681.6.3. The prefix b-Since there cannot be two labial consonants in the same syllable onset, the prefix b- is blocked before any root witha labial initialfor example, bor < b-BOR-s \"threw,\" bris < b-BRI-s \"wrote,\" myas < b-MYAN-S \"tasted.'' Similarly,since preinitial b- can occur only before oral consonants, the prefix b- is blocked before nasalsfor example, ños <b-ÑO-S \"bought,'' nons < b-NON-s \"caused pain.\" Since preinitial b- can occur only before unaspiratedconsonants, the prefix b- is blocked before aspirated stopsfor example, khur < b-KHUR-S \"carried,\" khrid < b-KHRID-S \"led.\" Finally, since pre-preinitial b- can occur only before nonstopped preinitials, the prefix b- isblocked before any stopped preinitialfor example, gnans < b-GNAN-s \"gave,\" dgar < b-DGAR-S \"confined,\" gtsis< b-GTSI-S \"summoned.\"51.6.4. The suffix -sPostfinal -s, like preinitial G-, undergoes GRAVITY DISSIMILATION: the acute postfinal -s can occur only aftergrave finals and vowels. Thus, too, the inflectional suffix -s is blocked after acute finals in the verb rootforexample, brkus < b-RKU-s \"stole\" but btad < b-TAD-s \"delivered,\" btags < b-TAG-s \"ground\" but btor < b-TOR-s\"scattered.\"65Actually, as one might expect, things are a little more complicated than this. The prefix b- interacts withlabial initials in the root in complex ways; and, although the prefix b- is blocked before aspirated STOPS,the prefix interacts in complex ways with AFFRICATES, as does the prefix G- as well. We will discusssuch interactions under the adjustment rules. In addition, the prefix b- is blocked before initial DR in theroot-for example, dris < b-DRI-s \"asked,\" drubs < b-DRUB-s \"sewed,\" drud < b-DRUD-s \"rubbed.\" Butnote the occasional hypercorrect formfor example, bdral < b-DRAL-S \"tore apart\" as well as the expectedform dral.6 The past tense inflectional suffix -s is in fact preserved sporadically as -d after acute finals in several archaicmanuscripts of the eighth and ninth centuries, where we find such forms as gyurd < GYUR-s \"became,\" btsald< o-TSHAL-S \"acquired,\" bzurd < b-zuR-s \"made way,\" and hrald < b-HRAL-s \"tore to pieces.\" Note, forexample, the parallel verbs in the following bit of archaic poetry from a Tun-huang manuscriptmdeu-rdze ma-dmard, Npon-skyen sa ma-khums \"The tip of the arrowhead did not become red, the skillful archer did not killthe deer,\" where dmard < b-DMAR-s \"became red,\" with an acute final, is parallel to khums < b-KHUM-s\"killed,\" with a grave final.(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_168next page >"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"page_169file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_169.html[8/7/2010 9:53:46 PM]< previous pagepage_169next page >Page 1691.7. Root RulesIn many instances, the relationship between a hypothesized verb root and the observed tense stems is relativelytransparentfor example, KHRO (Nkhro/ khros)\"be angry,\" SIG (gsig/bsigs/bsig/sig)\"shake.\" Sometimes, as we haveseen, inflectional affixes may be regularly blockedfor example, in nu < N-NU \"weeps,'' khol < KHOL-s \"wasboiling,\" sdom < G-SDAM \"fastens,'' ños < b-ÑO-S \"bought.\" And, sometimes, apparently inflectional affixes mayin fact be part of the root-for example, NDRE (Ndre/Ndres)\"be mixed,\" GAS (Ngas/gas)\"be split.\" But even inthese cases the structure of the underlying root seems fairly clear.However, there are many instances where the interaction between prefix and initial is much more complexwherethe prefix is not blocked, and the verb root initial undergoes changes to accommodate it. These interactions will bediscussed in the following sections.(footnote continued from previous page)This usage is continued in the works of the Tibetan grammarians, who use this archaic postfinal -dparticularly to distinguish the past stem of a transitive verb from a b- future stem that would otherwise beidentical-for example, bsgyurd < b-SGYUR-S \"translated\" as distinguished from bsgyur < b-SGYUR \"willtranslate,\" bstand < b-STAN-S \"explained\" as distinguished from bstan < b-STAN \"will explain.\" Thisinflectional postfinal -d is called da-drag \"strong d\" by the Tibetan grammarians; when found as a markerof the past stem after an acute final consonant, we will call postfinal -d the PAST STEM da-drag. Giventhat this past stem inflectional marker appears as -s after vowelsfor example, skyes < SKYE-s \"was born\"wecan hypothesize a Proto-Tibetan past stem suffix *-s, which became -s after grave finals and vowels and -dafter acute finals; in the course of the eighth century the -d allomorph of *-s disappeared after acute finals,leaving only the -s allomorph after grave finals and vowels.The past stem da-drag must be distinguished from what we will call the PRESENT STEM dadrag-theinflectional suffix -d found in the present stem of some transitive verbs, as in Ntshod < N-TSHO-D \"cooks,\"which takes the form -s after grave finals, as in Ngugs < N-GUG-D \"bends,\" and, by the time of Old Tibetan,had disappeared after acute finals. Given that this present stem inflectional marker appears as -d after vowelsasin sbed < N-SBA-D \"conceals\"we can hypothesize a Proto-Tibetan present stem suffix *-D, which became -dafter acute finals and vowels and -s after grave finals; even before the earliest written texts, the -d allomorph of*-D had disappeared after acute finals, leaving the -d allomorph after vowels and the -s allomorph after gravefinals. < previous pagepage_169next page >"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"page_170file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_170.html[8/7/2010 9:53:46 PM]< previous pagepage_170next page >Page 1701.7.1. Voice dissimilationThere are some verbs for which there seems good reason to postulate a root with an aspirated initialfor example,KHUM (Nkhum/khums)\"contract oneself,\" THIG (Nthig/thigs)\"fall in drops,\" PHEL (Nphel/phel)\"grow greater,''TSHAG (Ntshag/tshags) \"be broken,\" TSHAN (Ntshan/tshans)\"awaken.'' Similarly, there are some verbs for whichthere seems good reason to postulate a root with a voiced initialfor example, GO (Ngo/gos)\"become dirty,\" DRIL(Ndril/dril)\"roll oneself up,\" BAB (Nbab/babs)\"fall down.\" Are there, then, roots with voiceless initials?Apparently so. Where we find such patterns as Nkhrol/bkrol/dkrol/khrol \"ring,\" or Nthub/btubs/gtub/thubs \"chop,\"it seems reasonable to postulate a root with a voiceless initialthat is, respectively, KROL \"ring\" and TUB \"chop.\"However, when such roots are prenasalized, they yield forms that require adjustment; and such adjustment takesplace through aspirating the initialthus Nkhrol < N-KROL \"rings,\" Nthub < N-TUB \"chops.\" A narrow statement ofthis rule is that a voiceless stopped initial is aspirated when prenasalized. But note that an equally acceptable formwould have resulted from voicing the initial, yielding *Ngrol and *Ndub instead of Nkhrol and Nthub. Thus abroader statement of the same rule is that a voiceless stopped initial DISSIMILATES in voice onset time whenpreceded by prenasalization.Such dissimilation is found elsewhere in the inflectional system as well. We find such patterns asNgod/bkod/dgod/khod \"array\" and Ndul/btul/gdul/thul \"tame.\" In such cases we can postulate a root with a voicedinitialthat is, respectively, GOD \"array\" and DUL \"tame.\" In these cases, forms that in fact require no adjustmentdissimilate in voice onset time when preceded by a b-prefixthus bkod < b-GOD-s \"arrayed,\" btul < b-DUL-S\"tamed,\" instead of the equally acceptable past stem forms *bgod and *bdul.However, voice dissimilation does not occur universally. Only STOPPED initials dissimilate after the b- prefix; wefind, for example, bzas < b-ZA-s \"ate,\" bzus < b-ZU-s \"digested.\" And voice dissimilation does not take place afterthe G-prefix; we find, for example, dgug < G-GUG \"will bend,\" gdeg < G-DEG \"will raise.\" Note, too, that theonset cluster bg is both acceptable and not uncommon, as opposed, say, to a form such as ?Nt, so that manuscriptswill contain occasional \"incorrect\" forms such as bgod < b-GOD-s \"arrayed.\" In the face of the acceptability of bgand bd clusters, the tenacity of the dissimilation to bk and bt is in fact quite remarkable. < previous pagepage_170next page >"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"page_171file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_171.html[8/7/2010 9:53:47 PM]< previous pagepage_171next page >Page 1711.7.2. UnstoppingThere are some intransitive verbs for which there seems good reason to postulate a root with a fricative initialforexample, SUB (Sub/Subs)\"whisper,\" zu (zu/zus)\"make a request,\" SUN (sun/sun)\"be weary,'' ZAB (zab/ zabs)\"bedeep,\" where present stem prenasalization is blocked by a regular adjustment rule. But we also find suchintransitive patterns as Ntshor/sor \"slip away,\" Ndzug/zugs ''enter,\" Ntsho/sos \"be alive,\" Ndzag/zags \"trickle,\"where a fricative in the past stem alternates with an affricate in the present stem. In such cases we can postulate aroot with an affricate initialthat is, respectively, TSOR \"slip away,\" DZUG \"enter,\" TSO \"be alive,\" DZAG\"trickle\"with the additional rule that all such affricate root initials become UNSTOPPED in absolute initialpositionthus sor < -TSOR-s \"slipped away,\" zugs < -DZUG-s \"entered,\" sos < -TSO-S \"was alive,\" zags < -DZAG-S \"trickled.\" Alongside such verbs we may note also such patterns as Ntshag/tshags \"be broken,\"Ntshar/tshar \"be finished,\" where we can postulate a root with an aspirated affricate initial-that is, respectively,TSHAG \"be broken,\" TSHAR \"be finished\" where unstopping is undone by our phonological Rule 2. Voicelessaffricate initials regularly dissimilate in voice onset time and become aspirated when prenasalizedthus Ntshor < N-TSOR \"slips away,\" Ntsho < N-TSO \"is alive.\"Similarly, there are some transitive verbs for which there seems good reason to postulate a root with a fricativeinitialfor example, SU (su/bsus/bsu/sus)\"take off,\" ZU (zu/bzus/bzu/zus)\"digest,\" SUB (sub/bsubs/bsub/subs)\"stopup,\" ZA (za/bzas/bza/zas)\"eat,\" where present stem prenasalization is blocked by a regular adjustment rule. But wealso find such patterns as Ntshad/bsad/ bsad/sod \"explain,\" Ndzog/bzogs/bzog/zogs \"carve,\" Ntsho/bsos/gso/sos\"nourish,\" Ndzed/bzed/bzed/zed \"hold out,\" where a fricative in the past, future, and imperative stems alternateswith an affricate in the present stem. In such cases we can postulate a root with an affricate initialthat is,respectively, TSAD \"explain,\" DZOG \"carve,\" TSO \"nourish,\" DZED \"hold out\"with the additional rule that suchaffricate root initial become unstopped not only in absolute initial position but after the prefixes b- and G- as well-thus bsad < b-TSAD-s \"explained,\" bzogs < b-DZOG-s \"carved,\" gso < G-TSO \"will nourish,\" bzed < b-DZED\"will hold out.\" Voiceless affricate initials regularly dissimilate in voice onset time and become aspirated whenprenasalizedthus Ntshad < N-TSAD \"explains,\" Ntsho < N-TSO \"nourishes.\" And the voiced and voiceless affricateinitials, as we have seen, become unstopped in absolute initial position in the imperative stem. < previous pagepage_171next page >"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"page_172file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_172.html[8/7/2010 9:53:48 PM]< previous pagepage_172next page >Page 172We also find such patterns as Ntshin/btsins/btsin/tshins \"bind,\" Ntshir/btsir/gtsir/ tshir \"press.\" It is clear that anyunderlying root should have an affricate initial; the only affricate initial left is the aspirated affricate; and, indeed,postulating roots with aspirated affricate initialsthat is, respectively, TSHIN \"bind,\" TSHIR \"press''makes sense insuch cases. The affricate initial after the - prefix in the imperative stem is what we would now expect in the caseof an aspirated affricate initial. Moreover, if the b- and G- prefixes are not blocked before affricate aspirate initials,the resulting unacceptable clusters ?btsh, ?btsh, ?gtsh, ?gtsh must be adjusted into acceptable form; unstoppingwould here only produce the equally unacceptable clusters ?bsh, ?bsh, ?gsh, ?gsh. Therefore, VOICEDISSIMILATION applies, and the initial is adjusted to a voice onset time as far as possible from that of the prefixwithin an acceptable onset clusterthus btsins < b-TSHIN-S \"bound,'' btsir < b-TSHIR \"pressed,\" gtsir < G-TSHIR\"will press.\"Now it is clear that some prefix-initial clusters might be adjusted by more than one adjustment rule. A voicedaffricate is, in effect, a hybrid between a fricative and a voiced stop, and the adjustment rules might treat a voicedaffricate initial as if it were either: a voiced affricate initial after the prefix b-might undergo either unstopping, asin bz < b-DZ, or, like other voiced stops, voice dissimilation, as in bts < b-DZ parallel to bt < b-D. Similarly, avoiced affricate initial after the imperative prefix - might undergo either unstopping, as in Z < -DZ, or, like othervoiced stops, imperative rule aspiration, as in tsh < -DZ, parallel to th < -D. And, indeed, we find such patternsas Ndzug/ btsug/gzug/tshugs \"inject,\" Ndzud/btsud/gzud/tshud \"lead,\" where the latter in fact appears to havehappened.7One way of describing this pattern is to say that a voiced affricate root initial can, in effect, choose eitherunstopping or voice dissimilation, but not both, and either unstopping or imperative aspiration, but not both; andthat each such verb root makes such a choice, which becomes part of its lexical entry. Another way is to say thatthe adjustment rules and imperative rule apply to root initials in a particular order, with unstopping applied first;when an initial has been unstopped, as we have seen, the remaining rules of voice7 Since ?gdz is, like ?bdz, an unacceptable cluster, some adjustment must occur; but, unlike ?bdz, thecluster cannot be adjusted by voice dissimilation, which occurs after the prefix b- but not after the prefix G-. Therefore the cluster can be adjusted only by unstopping, so that we find, in this pattern, gzug < G-DZUG\"will inject,\" gzud < G-DZUD \"will lead.\" < previous pagepage_172next page >"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"page_173file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_173.html[8/7/2010 9:53:48 PM]< previous pagepage_173next page >Page 173dissimilation and imperative aspiration cannot apply, because those rules do not apply to fricative initials; but someverbs with voiced affricate initials have, as part of their lexical entry, an exception feature whereby the unstoppingadjustment rule does not apply.1.7.3. Labial rulesThere are three patterns for which we postulate roots with labial initialsBRAD (Nbrad/brad/dbrad/brod)\"scratch,\"PUD (Nbud/phud/dbud/phud)\"cast down,\" PHROG (Nphrog/phrogs/dbrog/phrogs)\"rob.'' The first thing we noticein such patterns is an adjustment rule whereby the inflectional prefix G- followed by ANY labial becomes thecluster dbthus dbrad < G-BRAD \"will scratch,\" dbud < G-PUD \"will cast down,'' dbrog < G-PHROG \"will rob.\"Given such a rule, the inflection of roots postulated to have aspirated labial initials is perfectly regular, with, forexample, phrogs < b-PHROG-S \"robbed\" by the blocking of the inflectional prefix b- before an aspirated stopinitial. Similarly, the inflection of roots postulated to have voiced labial initials is perfectly regular, with, forexample, brad < b-BRAD-s \"scratched\" by the blocking of the inflectional prefix b- before a labial initial, with oneexception: the initial b in a verb root is not subject to the imperative rule, and we find, for example, brod < -BRAD-S \"scratch!\" instead of the equally acceptable but nonoccurring form *phrod.For the remaining pattern we postulate an underlying root with a voiceless labial initial. There is a derivationalbasis for this choice as well. We find several pairs of verbs in Tibetan where an intransitive verb with a voicedinitial is clearly related, semantically and phonologically, to a transitive verb with a voiceless initialfor example,GRIL \"be twisted, be wrapped around\" KRIL \"embrace, clasp round,\" DU \"come together, assemble\" TU \"collect,gather,\" DOR \"be scattered, be dispersed\" TOR \"scatter, cast away.\" We find several such pairs for which we cansimilarly postulate voiced and voiceless labial initialsfor example, BUD (Nbud/bud)\"fall down, leave, disappear\"PUD (Nbud/phud/dbud)\"pull off, throw down, drive out,\" BAB (Nbab/babs)\"fall down\" PAB(Nbebs/phab/dbab/phobs)\"cast down,\" BUB (Nbub/bubs)\"be turned upside down\" PUB (Nbub/phubs/dbub)\"makeinto a roof,\" BOG (Nbog/bog)\"become loose\" POG (Nbog/phog/dbog/phogs)\"unload,\" BYE (Nbye/bye)\"becomeopen\" PYE (Nbyed/phyes/dbye)\"make open.\"Postulating a root with a voiceless labial initial underlying this pattern means < previous pagepage_173next page >"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"page_174file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_174.html[8/7/2010 9:53:50 PM]< previous pagepage_174next page >Page 174that one additional adjustment rule is required, as well as one exception to an adjustment rule. First, for reasonsthat are not clear to me, the unacceptable cluster ?bp < b-P is adjusted to ph. Second, initial p in a verb root doesnot undergo voice dissimilation when prenasalized, but rather assimilates in voice onset time to yield the acceptablecluster Nb. There seems to be in operation here, at least in part, a preference for b initials we can call B-PERSISTENCEnote db < G-P, db < G-PH, Nb < N-P, and b < -B in imperative stemswhich overrides other moregeneral rules we might otherwise expect.We can now summarize the interactions of the inflectional prefixes with root initials under these adjustment rulesas follows:INFLECTIONAL PREFIXROOTINITIALN-b-G--KNkhbkdkkhKHNkhkhkhkhGNgbkdgkhTNthbtgtthTHNththththDNdbtgdthPNbphdbphPHNphphdbphBNbbdbbzTSNtshbsgssTSHNtshbtsgtstsh"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"page_174file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_174.html[8/7/2010 9:53:50 PM]DZNdzbzgzzNdZbtsgzzTable 10.

The Present Stem da-dragIn the present stems of some transitive verbs we find an inflectional suffix -D preserved after open syllables. Forexample, given the stems Ntshod/btsos/btso \"cook\" and Nbyed/phyes/dbye \"make open,\" we can postulate theunderlying roots TSHO \"cook\" and PYE ''make open,'' respectively, with the additional realization rule______D forthe present stem. Transitive verbs which idiosyncratically undergo this realization rule would be so marked in thelexicon.8By the time of Old Tibetan this inflectional suffix -D had disappeared after acute final consonants and had become-s after grave final consonants. This process of gravity dissimilation accounts for the presence of postfinal -s in thepresent stem of several transitive verbsfor example, Ndzibs < N-DZIB-D \"sucks,\" Ngugs < N-GUG-D \"bends,\"Ndegs < N-DEG-D \"raises,\" Ndzoms < N-DZOM-D \"conquers.\"Additionally, the inflectional suffix -D has an effect on both preceding vowels and preceding final nasals, movingthem from the back of the mouth to the front in anticipatory assimilation to the following dental. Thus the lowback spread vowel a becomes the low front spread vowel e before the inflectional suffix -D. Compare the presentand past stems sbed < N-SBA-D \"conceals\" sbas < b-SBA-s \"concealed,\" sems < N-SAM-D \"thinks\" bsams < b-SAM-s \"thought,\" Ngrems < N-GRAM-D \"displays\" bkram < b-GRAM-S \"displayed,\" Ndebs < N-DAB-D \"throws\"btab < b-DAB-s \"threw,\" sel < N-SAL-D \"clears away\" bsal < b-SAL-s \"cleared away.\"98 The realization rule______D for the present stem appears to co-occur only with the realization ruleN______ for the present stem: that is, we find transitive roots with present stems of the form N______D butnot of the form G______D. The only exception seems to be a lost transitive verb *SAG of uncertainmeaning, which apparently underlies the present stem gsegs < *G-SAG-D generalized as the intransitiveroot GSEGS \"come.\" Elsewhere the general rule that______D co-occurs only with N______appears to holdgood. Thus a root such as SAM \"think\" yields the present stem sems < N-SAM-D \"thinks\" rather than thephonologically acceptable but nonoccurring present stem *gsems or *gsoms < G-SAM-D.9 This vowel assimilation explains the e/a/a/o vowel pattern in some verbs: where we postulate an underlyingvowel a in the root, o < A in the imperative stem by the rounding rule, and, where there is present stem da-drag, e < A-D by assimilation. Note the present and imperative stems Ngebs < N-GAB-D \"covers\" khobs < -GAB-S \"cover!\" sems < N-SAM-D \"thinks\" soms < -SAM-S \"think!\" skyel < N-SKYAL-D \"brings\" skyol < -SKYAL-S \"bring!\" Nges < N-GAS-D \"splits\" khos < -GAS-S \"split!\" < previous pagepage_175next page >"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"page_176file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_176.html[8/7/2010 9:53:51 PM]< previous pagepage_176next page >Page 176Further, before -D a preceding velar nasal n moves to the front of the mouth to become n, in anticipatoryassimilation to the following dental, after which the -D disappears through gravity dissimilation.10 Compare thepresent and past stems Ndren < N-DRAN-D \"leads\" drans < b-DRAN-S \"led,\" len < N-LAN-D \"takes'' blans < b-LAN-s \"took,'' Nphen < N-NPHAN-D \"flings\" Nphans < b-NPHAN-S \"flung.\"Finally, where a root final n is fronted to become n before inflectional -D, the high back rounded vowel u movesalong with the nasal to the front of the mouth to become, under Rule 1, the high front spread vowel i. Compare thepresent and past stems Ndzin < N-DZUN-D \"grasps\" bzun < b-DZUN-s \"grasped,\" Nbyin < N-PYUN-D \"removes\"phyun < b-PYUN-s \"removed.\"11As we have noted, the inflectional suffix -D occurs in the present stem only in transitive verbs. In a number ofcases where related transitive and intransitive verbs have homophonous underlying roots, the inflectional suffix -Dor its remnantsmay be the sole distinction between the transitive and intransitive present stems; indeed, this maybe one of the reasons why these remnants have been resistant to analogical leveling. Thus we find such pairs ofpresent stems as skye \"is born\" skyed \"produces,\" Ngye \"is divided\" rgyed \"divides,\" rgyu \"moves\" rgyud\"transmits,\" Ndzu \"enters\" Ndzud \"inserts.\" Similarly, we find such present stem pairs as Ngag \"is hindered\" Ngegs\"hinders,\" Ngas \"is cleft\" Nges \"cleaves,\" Ntshas \"is split\" Ntshes \"splits,\" Nbab \"descends\" Nbebs \"lowers.\"1.9. Exceptions and IrregularitiesThe system set forth here attempts to explain Old Tibetan verb morphology by postulating a single underlyingform for each verb and rules whereby that underlying form becomes each of the observable tense stems. Clearlythere is no unique solution to the task of setting up the roots and devising the rules; each proposed solution willattempt to balance often subjective judgments of simplicity, abstractness, naturalness, and elegance. Nor is this10 For some reason this process does not affect the root GAN \"fill,\" which has the present stem Ngens < N-GAN-D \"fills,\" where we would otherwise expect *Ngen.11 This rule links together the transitive verb PYUN \"take out, remove\" and the intransitive verb BYUN \"*comeout  arise, occur, happen.\" < previous pagepage_176next page >"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"page_177file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_177.html[8/7/2010 9:53:52 PM]< previous pagepage_177next page >Page 177sort of system the only one possible: there are ways to describe morphology other than by rules and uniqueunderliers. But any system will have holes in itexceptions and irregularities that must be accounted for, as it were,in footnotes. Some of these exceptions are apparently the result simply of errors in the texts; the rooting out ofsuch scribal errors is, of course, the province of textual criticism.12 Elsewhere, scribesor authorsmay have a choiceof \"correct\" forms that have come down to them from Old Tibetan; and elsewhere we find, as in other languages,verbs which are just regularly irregular. The following sections will discuss these holes in the system we have setup.1.9.1. Scribal errorsTibetan texts contain errors; sometimes verb stems are just written incorrectly. Tibetan scribes are sometimessleepy or distracted or hurried, just like any scribeor typistmight be. But, in addition, the Tibetan language haschanged phonologically over time; the written language has preserved forms no longer in use in the spokenlanguage. For example, in Lhasa Cityand the principle would be the same throughout central Tibetthe stems sgrub\"accomplishes,\" bsgrubs \"accomplished,\" and bsgrub \"will accomplish\" are all pronounced tup, the stems Ndegs''lifts,\" btegs ''lifted,\" and gdeg \"will lift\" are all pronounced tek, and the stems Ngrol \"sets free,\" bkrol \"set free,\"and dgrol \"will set free\" are all pronounced tö. The Old Tibetan inflectional affixes are just no longer functional; inLhasa City, what we are here calling verbal tense is expressed in other ways.1312 There is a circularity here: the texts are our primary source for our knowledge of the tense stems; basedon that knowledge we build a system which we then use to emend the texts. This is an example of what hasbeen called the \"hermeneutic circle,\" whereby the whole can be understood only through its parts, but theparts can be understood only through the whole. Such a circle, one hopes, is in fact a spiral, with text andconcept interacting to yield increased understanding. Unfortunately, it is fair to say that at the present timethere are very few critically edited texts in Tibetan, at least as the concept of textual criticism is applied to,say, Greek or Latin texts.13 The loss of inflectional affixes has apparently occurred in Tibetan at various times and in different places.There is evidence as early as the ninth century, for example, that postfinal -s was more or less regularly elided,at least in the speech of the urban nobles: on the Sino-Tibetan treaty pillar of 821 at Lhasa, we find OldTibetan <gtogs>transcribed as Middle Chinese *twok, Old Tibetan <mtshims>as Middle Chinese , OldTibetan <legs>as Middle Chinese *lyek, and Old Tibetan <rnegs>as Middle Chinese Yet, four hundred( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_177next page >"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"page_178file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_178.html[8/7/2010 9:53:53 PM]< previous pagepage_178next page >Page 178What this means is that scribes in various parts of Tibet have for centuries been unclear about the function andform of the tense stems. Let us look at several woodblock prints of the well-known biography of Mi-la ras-pa byGtsan-smyon he-ru-ka. In one episode, for example, we read bla-ma rnog-pa gtsig-pur byon-nas ra-ma rgyab-tubsnams-te bla-ma-la phul \"Lama Rnog-pa( footnote continued from previous page)years later, an edict of Khubilai Khan, issued in 1269, transcribes the name of the Tibetan lama Nphags-painto Chinese as pa-ssu-pa. That same name is borrowed into Mongolian as baghspa, yet the well-knownTibetan book entitled gzuns-bsdus \"anthology of magic spells,\" is called, in Mongolian, sundui, indicatingthatat the time the word was borrowed, or in the dialect the word was borrowed fromthe postfinal -s ingzuns \"magic spell\" was not being pronounced. Matthew Kapstein has conveyed to me an incident in thebiography of the fourteenth-century Klon-tshen-pa: while the lama is granting an initiation, a femaledisciple becomes possessed by a mkha-Ngro-ma spirit, who castigates him for pronouncing rigs as rik. In aseries of texts from western China, collected by Roy Andrew Miller, Tibetan grags \"famous\"-a frequentcomponent of Tibetan personal namesis transcribed into Chinese as ch'i-la-ssu in 1303 and cha-ssu in1388, with postfinal -s preserved, but as ta in 1518, with postfinal -s elided; it is not clear, however,whether this represents a sequence of historical change or simply a fortuitous record of regional variation.What is clear is that, in New Tibetan, postfinal -s does vary with geography: note the following set ofdialect variantsOld Tibetan pags ''skin\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) paks (Dbus) pak (Lhasa) pa, Old Tibetanphyogs ''direction\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) tshoks (Dbus) tshok (Lhasa) tsho, Old Tibetan ltsags \"iron\" >New Tibetan (Ladakh) tsaks (Dbus) tsak (Lhasa) tsa, Old Tibetan zabs \"foot\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh)zaps (Dbus) zap (Lhasa) sap, Old Tibetan khrims \"law\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) thims (Dbus) thim(Lhasa) thim, Old Tibetan dgons \"idea\" > New Tibetan (Ladakh) gons (Dbus) gon (Lhasa) kon.By the way, the following is a partial Lhasa city paradigm for the verb tup \"accomplish\":PRESENTPASTFUTUREFIRST PERSON/tupki-yötupki-yiNIMMEDIATEKNOWLEDGESECOND ANDtupki-tutupki-reTHIRD PERSON/MEDIATE KNOWLEDGENote here the interaction of the verb stem tup with the past/nonpast markers and -ki-, respectively, andtwo intersecting mediate/immediate knowledge auxiliariestu and -yö for mediate or immediate knowledge,respectively, of events happening right now, and -re and -yiN for mediate or immediate knowledge,respectively, of events happening at a time other than right now. < previous pagepage_178next page >"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"page_179file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_179.html[8/7/2010 9:53:53 PM]< previous pagepage_179next page >Page 179went off by himself, took the goat upon his back, and gave it to the lama.\" All the verbs are, appropriately, in thepast tenseBYON (Nbyon/byon)\"go, proceed,\" SNAM (snom/bsnams/bsnam)\"seize, take,\" PUL(Nphul/phul/dbul)\"offer, give upward.''

In thissame episode, for example, the master Mar-pa, after a fit of temper, sits with his head wrapped up in his robe,pointedly ignoring everyone. The verb meaning \"wrap up, put over, cover\" is TUM, generally inflected as a Class 1verb, except that we also find a present stem gtumthus TUM (Nthum-gtum/ btums/btum)\"wrap up.\" Despite thisvariation in the present stem, there is every reason to believe that the past stem remains the perfectly regular btums< b-TUM-s \"wrapped up.'' Yet it is only the Spo print which gives the correct reading dbu btums-nas bzugs \"He satwith his head wrapped up.\" The other prints-from Spuns-than in Bhutan, from Bstan-rgyas-glin in Lhasa, andfrom Bkra-sis lhun-po-all give the anomalous reading gtums, which is not part of a new paradigm, but a scribalerror to be emended by the textual critic.1515 It could be argued that we are here dealing with two rootsthe earlier TUM and a synonymous laterGTUM, the latter a generalized form of the present stem of the former; we would then have the perfectlyregular gtums < b-GTUM-s \"wrapped up.\" The wholesale acceptance of such arguments would go a longway toward legitimating every scribal error ever made. Sometimes, as we shall see, such an argument canbe valid; but it should be used sparingly. I see no reason in the present case to recognize an additional rootrather than a scribal error, bearing in mind the maxim of textual criticism, that witnesses are to be weighed,not counted.Sometimes, of course, it is hard to know of several textual variants which is the correct one. In one episode,the master Mar-pa is having the obnoxious young Mi-la build and then tear down a series of stone towers, aspart of his discipline. Mi-la is about a third of the way toward completing his third tower when Mar-paapproaches him and says, according to the Bstan-rgyas-glin and Bkra-sis lhun-po texts, mthu-tshen khyodbrtsigs-pai mkhar Ndi sui yin \"Magician, whose is this tower you have built?\" The Spuns-than text is the same,except that the verb is the future stem brtsigthus \"Whose is this tower you will build?\" And the Spo text givesthe present stem rtsigthus \"Whose is this tower you are building?\" All three readings are morphologicallycorrect, and all three make sense in the context; my own preference would be for the present stem in the Spotext, but there is clearly room for argument.Finally, all of these scribal errors must be disentangledsomehow-from idiosyncratic spellings by the author andfrom systematic regional variations which must be considered part of the autograph.

Multiple class membershipAnother source of verbal irregularities is the fact that verbs can belong to more than one inflectional class. Forexample, as we have seen, TUM \"wrap up\" apparently has both the present stem Nthum < N-TUM and gtum < G-TUM \"wraps up\"; thus, in the texts, TUM ''wrap up\" appears as both a Class 1 and a Class 3 verb. How does thishappen?A rapid survey of over four hundred Tibetan transitive verbs shows that Class 1 is the largest class, containingalmost 45 percent of the verbs; Class 3 follows with approximately 30 percent; Class 2 contains approximately 20percent; and Class 4 contains approximately 5 percent of the transitive verbs counted. This means that there arealmost twice as many verbs with N-present stems (65 percent) as there are with G- present stems (35 percent), andjust about three times as many verbs with b- future stems (75 percent) as there are with G- future stems (25percent). While these numbers should not be given more weight than they can bear, they do indicate that there isconsiderable analogical pressure on transitive verbs to appear with N- as their present stem prefix and G- as theirfuture stem prefix; and we should not be surprised to find such analogical formations in our texts alongsidepresumably older forms.16Thus from the root TIG \"make drip\" we find both present stems Nthig < N-TIG and gtig < G-TIG \"makes drip,\"and from the root TUB \"chop\" we find both( footnote continued from previous page)text incorporated previously unattested forms of the language, or may be able to show that forms in othertexts-by the same author or from the same region-previously thought to be scribal errors are in fact in theform the author intended.16 The flow of this analogical change has apparently been for Class 4 verbs (now 5 percent of the total) tobecome either Class 2 verbs (now 20 percent of the total), by innovating an N- present stem, or Class 3 verbs(now 30 percent of the total), by innovating a b- future stem; and then for both Class 2 and Class 3 verbs tobecome Class 1 verbs (now 45 percent of the total), by innovating b- future stems and N- present stemsrespectively:In fact, it is probably reasonable to assume that the percentages we now see are the result of a long process ofleveling which goes back to Proto-Tibetan, where we can hypothesize an originally more equal distribution oftransitive verbs among the four paradigm classes. < previous pagepage_181next page >"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"page_182file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_182.html[8/7/2010 9:53:55 PM]< previous pagepage_182next page >Page 182present stems Nthub < N-TUB and gtub < G-TUB \"chops.\" The verb TIG, with the future stem btg, thus appears tobe moving from Class 3 to Class 1; the verb TUB, with the future stem gtub, similarly appears to be moving fromClass 4 to Class 2. In the same way, from the root DUD \"bend\" we find both future stems gdud < G-DUD and btud< b-DUD \"will bend,\" and from the root SAD ''kill\" we find both future stems gsad < G-SAD and bsad < b-SAD\"will kill.\" The verb DUD, with the present stem Ndud, thus appears to be moving from Class 2 to Class 1; the rootSAD, with the present stem gsod, similarly appears to be moving from Class 4 to Class 3.1.9.3. Multiple underliersAnother source of exceptions and irregularities is the fact that a verb may change its underlying form.17 Forexample, the archaic suffix -D as a sign of the present stem in certain transitive verbs was, by the time of OldTibetan, found in the form -d only in open syllables; in open syllable roots, this yielded a regular but unusualalternation between final -d in the present stem and final -s in the past stem. In such cases, there is a tendency forthe apparent anomaly to be leveled by reinterpreting the underlying root to incorporate the archaic inflectionalsuffix. Thus, from the root RÑE \"obtain\" we find, regularly, the present stem rñed < N-RÑE-D \"obtains\" alongsidethe past stem brñes < b-RÑE-S \"obtained.\" But, once such present stem da-drag has become opaque to speakers,the seemingly anomalous final -d in the present stem is accounted for by reinterpreting the root as RÑED. And,from this new root, we see the appearance of a new regularly formed past stem brñed < b-RÑED-s \"obtained\" inaddition to the older brñes.Underlying forms can be similarly reinterpreted to incorporate prefixes. From17 Alternatively, two different but homophonous roots can be conflated into a single seemingly anomalousparadigm. For example, alongside the present stem Ntshab \"hides\" we find two past stems, tshabs andbtsabs \"hid.\" It seems clear, however, that we are here in fact dealing with two roots-an intransitive rootTSHAB1(Ntshab/tshabs)\"hide oneself\" and a transitive root TSHAB2(Ntshab/btsabs/btsab/tshobs)\"conceal.\" Similarly, we find the past stems tshags and btsags alongside thepresent stem Ntshags, and the past stems sor and bsor alongside the present stem Ntshor. Again, it seemsclear that the related roots TSHAG1 (Ntshag/tshags)\"trickle'' and TSHAG2(Ntshag/btsags/btsag/tshogs)\"squeeze,\" and the related roots TSORR1(Ntshor/sor)\"flee\" and TSOR2(Ntshor/bsor/gsor)\"pursue,\" have been conflated into a single seemingly irregular paradigm. < previous pagepage_182next page >"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"page_183file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_183.html[8/7/2010 9:53:55 PM]< previous pagepage_183next page >Page 183the Class 3 verb so \"nourish\" we find the regular stems gso/bsos/bso/sos, as well as the apparently irregular paststem gsos. But the past stem gsos is regular if the verb root has been reinterpreted as GSO, as is the present stemgso as wellthus gso < N-GSO \"nourishes,\" gsos < b-Gso-s \"nourished.\" But why reinterpret the root? Apparentlythe root was reinterpreted as part of a switch from Class 3 to Class 1; in such a class switch, a root with a fricativeinitial would yield the unfamiliar present stem *so < N-SO ''nourishes,\" rather than the familiar present stem gso.So the familiar present stem was retained, the verb treated as Class 1, and the result was a reinterpretation of theunderlying form to GSO. Such Class 1 verbs as GSON \"hear\" and GSUN ''speak\" may also originally have hadfricative initials, but subjected to similar processes that in their case reached completion.181.9.4. Conflict of rulesA third source of irregularity in the verbal paradigms is the fact that morphophonemic rules change in the course oftime, and the frozen products of earlier rules may persist alongside the products of later rules. A good example isfound in the case of roots with initial l. It seems certain there was an early rule in the language whereby aprenasalized l became the cluster ld. Note, for example, the intransitive present and past stems ldan < N-LAN\"arises\" and lans < LAN-s \"arose,\" ldon < N-LON \"is blind\" lon < LON-S \"was blind,\" and the transitive presentand past stems ldug < N-LUG \"pours\" blugs < b-LUG-s \"poured,\" ldud < N-LUD \"waters\" blud < b-LUD-s\"watered.\"As this archaic rule ceased to be productive, some of the apparently anomalous present stems it produced wereaccounted for by reinterpreting the underlying root. Thus we find the variant past stems ldans \"arose\" and Idons\"was blind\" alongside lans and lon, reflecting a change of the underlying roots from LAN to LDAN and from LONto LDON. Such transitive roots as LDAD \"chew\" and LDAG \"lick\" are quite likely the results of the same process:compare Tibetan LDAG \"lick\" with Burmese Iyak, Lushei liak, Lisu lrghe18 Similarly, transitive roots with aspirated stop initials are rare in the classical language, and further havethe property of regularly blocking the b- prefix, which cannot occur before an aspirated initial. Thus thetransitive root KHUR \"carry\" has the quite regular past stem khur < b-KHUR-s \"carried.\" Compared tomost transitive roots, however, the past stem khur seems anomalous. Thus, when we find a past stem bkurin a text, the surface conformity of the past stem has been achieved by changing the underlying root fromKHUR to KUR. < previous pagepage_183next page >"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"page_184file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_184.html[8/7/2010 9:53:56 PM]< previous pagepage_184next page >Page 184\"lick,\" and thus Proto-Tibetan *lag \"lick.\"In classical Tibetan there is also the rule that glides cannot be prenasalized; that is, in verbal inflection the prefix N-is automatically blocked before any glidefor example,yib < N-YIB \"hides,\" ren < N-REN \"is stiff.\" In analogy withthis majority pattern, the minority pattern of initial l begins to change to conform to the pattern for the rest of theglides-thus lug < N-LUG ''is meek\" instead of *ldug, lab < N-LAB ''says\" instead of *ldab.Here a majority rule pattern, whereby l < N-L, is in conflict with a minority rule pattern, whereby ld < N-L. Giventhe root LAN \"arise,\" the shape of the present stemwhether lan or ldanwill depend on whether the writer applies theold minority rule or the general rule.As the earlier and archaic rule ceases to be productive, then, the verbal system changes in three different ways.First, some verbs reinterpret their underlying forms to regularize the anomalous present stem produced by theminority rule: thus, where we find a past stem ldir \"was distended,\" rather than *lir, we must postulate anunderlying root LDIR \"be distended,\" presumably from an earlier root *LIR which is now lost. Second, some verbsfollow the minority rule exclusively and some the general rule exclusively: thus the root LOG \"turn around\" hasonly the present stem ldog, and the root LUS \"remain behind\" has only the present stem lus. Third, some verbs areunpredictably the subject of either rule: thus, from the root LAN \"arise,\" we find in the texts the two present stemslan and ldan both attested.1.9.5. SuppletionSUPPLETION occurs when one form in a paradigm is completely replaced by a form from another paradigm, asin English go/went. In Tibetan we similarly find the present stem Ngro \"goes\" associated with a past stem son\"went,\" of uncertain origin but almost certainly a completely different verb. In some New Tibetan dialects the paststem son has in turn been replaced, for example, by New Tibetan (Lhasa) tshiN <phyin>\"went,\" clearly related tothe classical verb PHYIN \"move, proceed.\" We also find a form sog \"come!\" regularly used as the imperative stemof the intransitive verb ON \"come,\" which normally, of course, would not have a separate imperative stem at all.The form Sog may in fact be the imperative stem of a lost verb *SAG, of uncertain meaning; the present stem ofthe same verb may perhaps be found < previous pagepage_184next page >"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"page_185file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_185.html[8/7/2010 9:53:56 PM]< previous pagepage_185next page >Page 185frozen in the intransitive verb GSEGS \"come,\" which functions in the classical language as the honorific equivalentof ON \"come,\" and which seems to have generalized a present stem gsegs < *G-SAG-D.1.9.6. Regular irregularitiesFinally, there are some verbs that, as a regular matter, simply deviate from the verbal paradigms we have proposed.A few such verbs are regularly inflected without one or other prefix in the present stemthus tshe \"grows great\"instead of the expected *Ntshe < N-TSHE, pheb \"goes\" instead of the expected *Npheb < N-PHEB, myon \"tastes\"instead of the expected *dmyon < G-MYAN. More common are verbs that seem to be regularly inflected withoutthe inflectional affix -s in the past stemfor example, byun \"occurred'' instead of the expected *byuns < BYUN-s, na\"was sick\" instead of the expected *nas < NA-s, btan ''sent\" instead of the expected *btans < b-TAN-s. Suchregularly irregular verbs would be marked in the lexicon as exceptions to particular realization rules.Note, however, that the -s suffix as a sign of the past stem is, in fact, REDUNDANT in intransitive verbs and inClass 2 and Class 4 of transitive verbs. In intransitive verbs, the absence of prenasalization distinguishes the paststem from the prenasalized present stem; in Class 2 and Class 4 transitive verbs, the presence of a b- prefixdistinguishes the past stem from the G- prefixed future stem. And it is, indeed, extremely rare for the -s suffix tobe regularly absent where it is not thus redundant. Where the suffix serves to differentiate a b______s past stemfrom a b______future stem it is, as far as I can tell, invariably preserved in the paradigm.19 It appears to be a ruleof the language that only - prefixing intransitive verbs, and only transitive verbs that signal the future stem with aG- prefix, can regularly eliminate the past stem -s suffix.2019 It also seems generally true that, among Class 2 and Class 4 verbs, the past tense suffix -s is more likelyto be missing when the present stem shows the traces of an earlier inflectional suffix -D-thus DZUN(Ndzin/bzun/gzun)\"grasp,\" PYUN (Nbyin/phyun/dbyun)\"remove.\"20 We can also note the similar redundancy of the -s suffix in many imperative stems, which are largelydifferentiated from the other stems through the operation of the rounding rule and aspiration rule.

Morphophonemes Across SyllablesSome Tibetan PARTICLESor grammatical wordsundergo morphophonological changes conditioned, across syllableboundaries, by the final or postfinal of the immediately preceding syllable. In this text we write suchmorphophonemes as a capitalized portion of the syllablefor example, -KYan, -STe, -Am, -Tu. The capitalizationindicates that the morphophoneme changes its phonetic shape according to certain rules, depending on whatprecedes it. There are three phonological processes which govern these changescomplete or partial articulatoryassimilation; sonorance assimilation; and gravity dissimilation.21 These general processesand how they affect theTibetan particleswill be discussed in the following sections.2.1. Articulatory AssimilationIn COMPLETE articulatory assimilation, a morphophoneme becomes the same as the final or postfinal of theimmediately preceding syllable. For example, after preceding final -d the particle -Tu becomes -du and the particle-STe becomes first -Te and then -de. Similarly, -Tu becomes -su after preceding final or postfinal -s, and -KYibecomes -gi after preceding final -g. In PARTIAL articulatory assimilation, a morphophoneme becomes, in somearticulatory feature, more similar than it was before to the final or postfinal of the immediately preceding syllable.For example, after a preceding final or postfinal fricative -s, the affricate particle -TSin partially assimilates inCLOSURE to become -sin, with a fricative rather than an affricate initial. Similarly, after a preceding final velar -n, the palatalized particle -KYi partially assimilates in PLACE to become -gi, dropping the palatal component ofthe initial. As we will see, with these particles, such articulatory assimilations are( footnote continued from previous page)to say whether the seemingly sporadic elimination of the -s suffix from the imperative stem is consistentenough in the case of particular verbs to constitute a regular irregularity.21 Two additional morphophonemes will not be discussed here at any length. The morphophoneme PH, foundin the derivational affixes -PHo and -PHo-tShe, becomes, rather straightforwardly, -b after preceding opensyllables and -p after any preceding consonant final or postfinalthus, for example, blon-po, gnas-po, but dpa-bo, nu-bo. The morphophoneme P, found in the derivational affix -Pa, becomes b after preceding final -n, -r, -land open syllables, and becomes p after preceding final -g, -d, -n, -b, -m, and final or postfinal -sthus snan-ba,nor-ba, Ndul-ba, lta-ba, but rig-pa, gsod-pa, bden-pa, sgrib-pa, sdom-pa, nus-pa. I can make no phonologicalsense out of this distribution. < previous pagepage_186next page >"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"page_187file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_187.html[8/7/2010 9:53:57 PM]< previous pagepage_187next page >Page 187sporadic; they are, in fact, exceptions to other more general patterns we will discuss below.One pattern of complete assimilation is perfectly regular, however: we find such patterns as dag-go, rin-no, yod-do, yin-no, thub-bo, Npham-mo, sgyur-ro, Nbul-lo, and lags-so, as well as dgao, Nbrio, rgyuo, dgeo, and Ngroo.Here a vowel morphophoneme, which remains a vowel after a preceding open syllable, prefixes to itself the finalor postfinal consonant of a preceding closed syllable. We will write the morphophonemes that follow this pattern ascapitalized vowelsthus -Am, -U, -E, or, in the series above, -o. For example, we find not only dag-go < dag-o butalso sgyur-ram < sgyur-Am, smyig-gu < smyig-u, and brñas-se < brñas-E.In the oldest manuscripts, dating from the eighth and ninth centuries, there is little consistency in the writing ofthese forms. Thus we find, for example, <Ndrao>, <Ndra-o>, <gyur-ro>, <khor-o>, <tshul-lo>, and <gsaro>allwithin the same manuscript. Such variations suggest that these particles were simple vowels in Proto-Tibetan, asindicated by such archaic manuscript spellings as <rlag-o>and <rdze-o>, and that they became morphophonemes,completely assimilating to preceding consonants, only in Old Tibetan.222.2. Gravity DissimilationThe coordinative conjunction -STe \"AND\" becomes -ste after preceding final -g, -, -b, -m, and open syllables;becomes -te after preceding final -n, -r, -l, and -s; and becomes -de after preceding final -d. Interestingly, the earlygrammatical treatise Sum-tsu-pa, traditionally attributed to Thon-mi Sam-22 In the archaic manuscripts from Central Asia, we sometimes find complete assimilations to postfinalconsonants which are not writtenfor example, <rdzog-so>for rdzogs-so, <btsug-so>for btsugs-so, and,presumably, <Ntshal-do>for Ntshald-do. Also, in these manuscripts and in self-consciously archaizingclassical texts, we find the forms -to and -tam, apparently only after final -n, -l, and -rfor example, smon-to, mkhyen-tam, rtol-to, gyurto, dar-tam. This may originally have been a form of partial assimilation to anunwritten postfinal -d, but why in this case the assimilation was partial rather than complete I do not know;one is tempted to say that these forms continue to reflect the Proto-Tibetan reflex -t of the morphophoneme*T after a preceding final -d, rather than the completely assimilated Old Tibetan reflex d. Note, in thisregard, the regular occurrence of the frozen forms kun-tu < *kund-tu (never ?kun-du)\"completely\" andpha-rol-tu < *pha-rold-tu (never ?pha-rol-du)\"beyond.\" < previous pagepage_187next page >"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"page_188file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_188.html[8/7/2010 9:53:58 PM]< previous pagepage_188next page >Page 188bhota, in verse 13, seems to know only the form -ste, and not -te or -de, while in the archaic manuscripts fromCentral Asia we find forms such as <srabste>, <babste>, and <bab-ste>, apparently indiscriminately. In fact, themorphophonological changes undergone by ST, as they finally appear in the classical texts, are primarily a form ofGRAVITY dissimilation: S becomes s after an immediately preceding grave final; and it disappears, leaving behindT, after an immediately preceding acute final or postfinal, just as, for example, the inflectional past stem suffix -sdoes within the syllable. Then this relatively straightforward dissimilation is complicated somewhat by the fact thatthe resulting T becomes t everywhere except after immediately preceding final -d, where it completely assimilatesto d.

Sonorance AssimilationFour morphophonemes-TS, KY, Y, and T, which occur in the particles -TSin, -TSig, -KYan, -KYis, -KYi, -Tu, andYan-are generally governed by a rule of assimilation to the SONORANCE of the final or postfinal of theimmediately preceding syllable: they become voiced after preceding sonorants and become unvoiced afterpreceding obstruents.

The morphophoneme KY split into two different forms. One of these, which we write as themorphophoneme Y, occurs only in the unbound connective Yan, which becomes kyan after all immediatelypreceding obstruents, and becomes yan-presumably from Proto-Tibetan *gyan-after all immediately precedingsonorants. The other, which we write as the morphophoneme KY, occurs in the bound particles -KYan, -KYis, and -KYi, where we find complete assimilation to g after preceding final -g, and partial assimilation to g after precedingfinal -n. And, interestingly, the morphophoneme partially assimilated in closure to a preceding vowel, changingfrom a palatalized stop to the palatal glide y. We can diagram this development as in Table 12, with the changesfrom the ProtoTibetan to the Old Tibetan system again indicated by boldface type.After preceding open syllables, the morphophonemes KY and T, which partially assimilate to become the glides yand r, and the morphophoneme Y, which normally takes the form y after any sonorant, can also take contractedforms which can be counted metrically as part of the preceding syllable.24 Thus from the particle -Tu we find, forexample, both mtha-ru and mthar, bde-ru and bder, rgyu-ru and rgyur, from the particle -KYi both bla-yi and blaispyi-yi and spyii, blo-yi and bloi, from the particle -KYis both rgyal-po-yis and rgyal-pos, blu-yis and blus, dge-yisand dges, and from the particles -KYan and Yan both dga-yan and dgaan, Nbri-yan and Nbrian, Ndre-yan andNdrean.24 Alternation of initial y- and - is not unusual in Tibetan: note, for example, yug-pa~ ug-pa \"oats,\" yud-pa~ud-pa \"moment,\" yob-pa~ob-pa ''ditch,\" YONN-ON ''come.\" In all these cases, given the basicdisyllabic rhythm of the language, contracted forms are much more likely to be found after unstressedsyllables, and the full syllabic formsthemselves unstressedafter stressed syllables. < previous pagepage_190next page >"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"page_191file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_191.html[8/7/2010 9:54:00 PM]< previous pagepage_191next page >Page 1919Phrases1. Preliminaries1.1. Syntax and MorphologyAs we have said, the SYNTAX of classical Tibetan describes the ways that the words of the language are strungtogether to make grammatical sequences. Thus it is WORDS from the lexicon that form the input to the syntax:1the syntax describes how these words are meaningfully collocatedhow they become, not isolated words, butfunctioning units in a sentence. Thus rgyal-po \"king,\" dgra \"enemy,\" and SAD ''kill\" are words; arrangedmeaningfully they become, say, (rgyal-po AGENY dgra PATIENT SAD PAST) QUESTION \"Did the king kill theenemy?'' The SYNTAX describes how the functions of each word are expressed: it gives the rule, for example, thatthe agency of a participant is realized as the particle -KYis, that the completion of the event is realized as the prefixb- and suffix -s, and that the interrogativity of the sentence is realized as the final particle -Am. Thus the output ofthe syntax in this example would be rgyal-po-KYis dgra- b-SAD-s -Am. It is the INFLECTIONALMORPHOLOGY of the language that then adjusts the FORMS of the words in the sentence to become, finally, therecognizable classical Tibetan sequence rgyalpos dgra bsad-dam \"Did the king kill the enemy?\"1.2. Overview of the SyntaxThe highest level discussed in the syntax is the DISCOURSE. The discourse will1 Words are thus primitives in the syntactic system, although, as we have seen, lexical wordsnouns,adjectives, verbsmay themselves be derivationally complex. For example, the words rdo-rin \"long stone monument\" and rnam-par SES \"particularly know  perceive\" are both internally complex but, as words,are primitives to the syntax. Note, however, that the syntax does recognize internal structure in words: forexample, the negative particle mI-\"NOT\" always immediately precedes the inflected verb stem even in aninternally complex verb-thus rnam-par mi-ses \"He does not perceive\" and not ?mi-rnam-par ses. < previous pagepage_191next page >"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"page_192file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_192.html[8/7/2010 9:54:00 PM]< previous pagepage_192next page >Page 192remain undefined, except to say that a discourse consists of one or more SENTENCES, and that such a discoursepossesses a coherence unpossessed by a random collocation of sentences. The syntax postulates a discourse levelbecause we find, within sentences, both connectives and omissions with extrasentential referents.A sentence, in turn, consists of a PROPOSITION followed by a PERFORMANCE PARTICLE. The propositioncontains the propositional content of the sentence; the performance particle indicates whether that content isintended as a statement, question, or command. For example, the sentences rgyal-pos dgra mthon-no \"The kingsees the enemy,\" rgyal-pos dgra mthon-nam \"Does the king see the enemy?\" and rgyal-pos dgra mthon-zig \"Letthe king see the enemy!'' are different performances of the same proposition rgyal-pos dgra mthon.2< previous pagepage_192next page >"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"page_193file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_193.html[8/7/2010 9:54:01 PM]< previous pagepage_193next page >Page 193proposition; such a complex proposition may then become a sentence by the addition of a performance particle. Orone proposition can be embedded at a lower level within another proposition by being NOMINALIZEDthat is,turned into a nominal by the affixation of any of several nominalizing particles. For example, the proposition bla-mas bgegs btul \"The lama tamed the demon\" can be nominalized by the nominalizing particle -Pa to become bla-mas bgegs btul-ba \"the taming of the demon by the lama.\" Such a nominalized proposition can then occuranywhere a nominal can occur. It can be the head of a nominal, as in rgyal-pos [bla-mas bgegs btul-ba] mthon''The king saw the taming of the demon by the lama\"; or it can be a COMPLEMENT that modifies a nominal orverbal head, as in [bla-mas bgegs btul-ba]-i sgrun \"the tale of the taming of the demon by the lama,\" or aRELATIVE that modifies a nominal head, as in [bla-mas bgegs btul-ba]-i bgegs ''demon which the lama tamed.\"A proposition consists of an EVENT preceded by the various PARTICIPANTS in that event. The event is whathappened; the participants are those to whom it happened, who made it happen, where it happened, with what orwith whom it happened, and so on. The event is expressed as a VERB PHRASE carrying its TENSE; eachparticipant is expressed as a NOMINAL PHRASE with a following ROLE PARTICLE to indicate the particularparticipant role it plays in the proposition. For example, in the proposition nags-la rgyal-po-s Sin- btubs \"Theking chopped wood in the forest,\" the fact that the asserted event is now PAST is signaled by the past tense affixesb- and -s attached to the verb TUB \"chop.\" Similarly, the participant nags \"forest\" is signaled as the LOCUS of theevent by the role particle -la, the participant rgyal-po \"king\" is signaled as the AGENCY of the event by the roleparticle -s, and the participant Sin is signaled as the PATIENT of the event by the role particle -. There are fiveprimary participant roles in the classical languagePATIENT, AGENCY, LOCUS, SOURCE, andACCOMPANIMENT.A VERB PHRASE is a verb with its optional specifiers and modifiers; a NOMINAL PHRASE is a nominal withits optional specifiers and modifiers. The specifier of a verb in a verb phrase is the optional NEGATION,expressed by the negation particle mI- \"NOT\"; the specifiers of a nominal in a nominal phrase are DELIMITERSand QUANTIFIERS.3 The modifier of a verb in a verb phrase3 There are two different types of delimiter in the classical textsDETERMINERS and REFLEXIVES.Either or both may occur, but, where both occur, two conditions must be met: the determiner must precedethe reflexive, and the determiner must be the type of < previous pagepage_193next page >"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"page_194file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_194.html[8/7/2010 9:54:01 PM]< previous pagepage_194next page >Page 194we will call an ADVERB; the modifier of a nominal in a nominal phrase we will call an ADNOMINAL. Nominalsother than nominalized propositions consist of various combinations of adjective phrases and nouns. AnADJECTIVE PHRASE consists of an adjective and its optional INTENSIFIER, such as sin-tu \"very.\" Verbs,adjectives, and nouns are primitives in the lexicon.Adverbs and adnominals are themselves nominal phrases, followed, respectively, by the adverb particle -Tu and theadnominal particle -KYi. This means that, in both cases, successive embeddings can take placefor example,mgyogs-po-i rta \"fast horse\" rgyal-po-i mgyogs-po-i rta \"the king's fast horse\" rgya-nag-gi rgyal-po-i mgyogs-po-i rta ''the king of China's fast horse,\" and mgyogs-po-r SLEB \"arrive quickly\" nan-pa-r mgyogs-po-r SLEB ''arrivequickly in the morning\" spyi-r nan-pa-r mgyogs-po-r SLEB \"generally arrive quickly in the morning.\" Intensifiers,such as sin-tu \"very\" or yonis-su \"completely\" are a special subset of adverbs.The following sections will describe the syntax of classical Tibetan from the bottom upthat is, first describingnominals, then phrases, then simple propositions, then complex propositions, then sentences, and finally someportions of the syntax beyond the sentence level.1.3. The Telegram Principle1.3.1. The elimination of redundancyClassical Tibetan is above all a written rather than a spoken language; freed from the constraints imposed by thetransience and noise of spoken messages, it can be highly elliptic, rather like an English telegram; it is, like atelegram, a shortened form of what would otherwise be a more redundant communication. For example, thetelegram John arriving airport Tuesday send car achievesdeterminer we call a definite determiner. Similarly, we find in the classical texts four different types ofquantifier: the nominal and its delimiter may be followed by one NUMERAL, one PLURAL, oneTOTALIZER, and one SELECTORalways in that order. For example, in the nominal phrase bla-ma de-dagkun \"all those lamas,\" the nominal bla-ma \"lama\" is followed by the determiner de \"THAT,\" the plural -dag\"MORE THAN ONE,\" and the selector kun \"ALL\"; in the nominal phrase rgyal-po na gñis \"we two kings,\"the nominal rgyal-po \"king\" is followed by the determiner na \"FIRST PERSON\" and the numeral gñis\"two.\" < previous pagepage_194next page >"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"page_195file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_195.html[8/7/2010 9:54:02 PM]< previous pagepage_195next page >Page 195brevity by eliminating the parenthesized redundancies from the more normal John (is) arriving (at the) airport(on) Tuesday (so) send (a) car (to meet him there). Similarly, we propose a classical Tibetan TELEGRAMPRINCIPLE: redundant elements of the message may beand frequently areomitted. This principle may overridesyntactic rules of the language.1.3.2. Old and new informationA proposition may contain a number of different sorts of information: it may refer to entities introduced for thefirst time into the discourse; or entities which could be inferred from a discourse entity already introduced; orentities which are obviously part of the discourse situation, although not previously mentioned; or entities whichwere already introduced into the discourse and are now being referred to again, either immediately or after somestretch of intervening text. We will not discuss these distinctions in detail; let it suffice to say that these differentsorts of information are points on a continuum that ranges, simply, from OLD INFORMATION to NEWINFORMATION. Old information is recoverablefrom the preceding text, from inference, from knowledge of theworld. Under the Telegram Principle, old information may, depending on its recoverability, be sufficientlyredundant to be omitted.4Any participant or group of participants can be old news in a proposition. In a discourse about a king, for example,the participant rgyal-po \"king\" might be inferableand thus redundantin any such proposition as RGYAL-PO-ñal\"THE KING sleeps,\" RGYAL-PO-S dgra bsad \"THE KING slew the enemy,'' dgra-s RGYAL-PO-bsad \"Theenemy slew THE KING,\" RGYAL-PO-la Nphrul-gyi ral-gri- yod ''THE KING has a magic sword,\" and so on.Under the Telegram Principle, anything recoverableold information, the theme of a propositioncan be left out, forthe reader to supply from the preceding text or from general knowledge. Thus a proposition may consist only ofthe rheme, with the theme considered redundant and omitted. Take, for example, the two propositions rgyal-posbgegs gsod \"The king slays4 One type of old information is of particular importance. Every proposition is ABOUT something; thesomething that a proposition is about we will call its THEME. What is said about the themethe news thespeaker supplies about itis the RHEME. A theme may be constant across any number of propositions; oncea theme has been established, it becomes, of course, old information. < previous pagepage_195next page >"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"page_196file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_196.html[8/7/2010 9:54:02 PM]< previous pagepage_196next page >Page 196demons\" and bla-mas bgegs Ndul \"The lama tames demons,\" and join them together with the conjunction -Yan\"BUT''thus rgyal-pos bgegs gsod-kyan bla-mas Ndul \"The king slays demons, but the lama tames them.\" Clearly,read< previous pagepage_196next page >"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"page_197file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_197.html[8/7/2010 9:54:03 PM]< previous pagepage_197next page >Page 197manipulates the cohesiveness of his textthe amount of back-reference he requires, the old information he repeats,and the density of the new information he supplies. The skill of the reader lies in part in the ability to unravel whatthe author has thus knit up.1.3.3. The omission of role particlesEvery participant in a Tibetan proposition is marked in three ways for its particular participant roleby its roleparticle, by its position, and by its semantic content. For example, in the proposition rgyal-pos rdza-ma btsag \"Theking broke the pot,\" the participant rgyal-po \"king\" is marked as the agency of the act of breaking by its leftwardposition in the proposition, by its role particle -s, and by its semantic contentthat is, a human capable of agency.The participant rdza-ma \"pot\" is marked as the patient of the act of breaking by its position just before the verb, byits role particle -, and by its semantic content-that is, an inanimate object incapable of agency, but quite capable ofbeing broken.But, under the Telegram Principle, redundant elements of the message may beand frequently areomitted. In theproposition rgyal-pos rdza-ma btsag \"The king broke the pot,\" the role particle -s is redundant, because it suppliesinformation given as well by position and by semantic content. There is little ambiguity in the proposition rgyal-pordza-ma btsag, which must still except under the most peculiar textual constraints-be processed as \"The kingbroke the pot.\"Since the role particle uniquely specifies the participant role of the participant, the role particle can be the clearestmarker for participant role. When the role particle is omitted, the position and semantic content of the participantare clues to its role in the proposition; when the role particle is present, the author may then more freely manipulatethe other two markers for participant roleposition and semantic content.Where participants are marked with their role particles, an author is free to change the ORDER in which theseparticipants appear in the proposition. Such differences in participant order convey information about the place ofparticular participants in the discourse, with THEMATIC participants appearing for the first time shifted to the leftof the other participants: compare, for < previous pagepage_197next page >"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"page_198file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_198.html[8/7/2010 9:54:03 PM]< previous pagepage_198next page >Page 198example, rgyal-pos rdza-ma btsag \"The king broke the pot\" with rdza-ma rgyal-pos btsag \"The potthe king brokeit.\"6Conversely, the agency through which an event occurs is often perceived as thematic, since what people talkABOUT most often are the actions of other people. Thus, where a participant is not marked with a role particle, theleftward participant is often processed as the agency, and the participant closest to the verb as the patient, wheresemantically possible: the otherwise ambiguous rgyal-po bla-ma mthon would normally be processed as \"The kingsees the lama\" unless there are good textual reasons to read it otherwise.7Where participants are unambiguously marked with their role particles, an author has some freedom to manipulatetheir SEMANTIC CONTENT, either through such figures of speech as metaphor or metonymy, or through thecreation of a world different from the normal one. Such a world might be created by, say, the proposition rdo-sku-s rgyal-po- mthon \"The stone image sees the king\" in a discourse about a miraculously animated statue.When an author, under the Telegram Principle, deletes too much information from a proposition, that propositionbecomes ambiguous. An ambiguous proposition offers a choice of readings. Ambiguity is thus the opposite ofredundancy: ambiguity is an insufficiency of information, while redundancy is a surfeit. Such ambiguouspropositions can sometimes be disambiguated by extralinguistic knowledge of what is normal and expected in theworld. In fact, sometimes more sophisticated knowledge is necessary. Whether the proposition sgrib-pa srid-paskyed should be read as \"Ignorance creates the6 Once such a theme is established, of course, it becomes old information-that is, it is recoverable fromcontext-and can be telegraphically omitted, as in, say, rdza-ma rdza-mkhan-gyis bzos rgyal-pos btsag \"Asfor the pots, the potter made them and the king broke them.\"7 Another way of saying almost the same thing is to say that normal Tibetan word order is AGENCY-PATIENT-VERB. But note that semantic content still limits the reading of, say, rdo-sku rgyal-po mthon to\"The king sees the stone image,\" despite the order of its participants, except under the most peculiar textualconstraintsthat is, assuming a normal world of sightless stone statues unless the text instructs us otherwise.Thus the proposition rdo bla-ma btsag would normally be processed as \"The lama broke the stone\" (or,perhaps better, \"The stonethe lama broke it\") despite the fact that the order of participants suggests the reading\"The stone broke the lama\" (or ''(Someone) broke the lama with a stone'') and its associated image of anunfortunate and perhaps frozen lama. < previous pagepage_198next page >"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"page_199file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_199.html[8/7/2010 9:54:04 PM]< previous pagepage_199next page >Page 199world\" or \"Ignorancethe world creates it\" turns on a fine point of theology; and it is a question of literaryscholarship which reading the author intended.2. Nominals2.1. DefinitionA NOMINAL is any lexical word or combination of words that can occur before a determiner such as Ndi \"THIS\"in a nominal phrase. Nominals thus include not only NOUNS (rta \"horse\" rta Ndi \"this horse\") and ADJECTIVES(bzan-po \"virtuous\" bzan-po Ndi ''this virtue\"), but also COMBINATIONS of nouns and adjectives (rta ''horse\"tshen-po \"great\" rta tshen-po Ndi \"this great horse\") and even entire NOMINALIZED PROPOSITIONS (rgyal-posrta tshen-po btul \"The king tames the great horse\" rgyal-pos rta tshen-po btul-ba Ndi \"this taming of the greathorse by the king\").2.2. Head and ModifierA nominal is generally processed as having a HEADthe leftmost component of the nominalfollowed by one ormore MODIFIERS.8 Either a noun or an adjective can be the head of a nominal, and either a noun or an adjectivecan be the modifier of the head.9The modifier functions to restrict the head in terms of some qualifying8 This structure is internal to the nominal; the nominal as a whole can then be a head modified by apreceding ADNOMINAL, which is a nominal phrase with the bound adnominal particle -KYi. For example,in the nominal phrase bla-ma tshen-po deiphren-ba gser-po \"that great lama's golden rosary,\" theNOMINAL phren-ba gser-po \"golden rosary\"consisting of the HEAD phren-ba \"rosary\" and itsMODIFIER gser-po \"golden\"is in turn modified by the preceding ADNOMINAL bla-ma tshen-po de \"thatgreat lama\"a nominal phrase consisting of the nominal bla-ma tshen-po \"great lama\" and the determiner de\"THAT,\" and the nominal bla-ma tshen-po \"great lama\" consisting in turn of the head bla-ma \"lama\" andits modifier tshen-po \"great.\"9 We may note that a Tibetan adjective head must generally be TRANSLATED into English as an abstractnounthus bzan-po \"virtuous\" sin-tu bzan-po \"very virtuous\" bzan-po Ndi \"this virtue,\" gtum-po \"furious\" sin-tugtum-po \"very furious\" gtum-po Ndi \"great fury.\" This is a peculiarity of English and not of Tibetan. < previous pagepage_199next page >"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"page_200file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_200.html[8/7/2010 9:54:04 PM]< previous pagepage_200next page >Page 200feature: the modifier answers the question \"What type of?\" with reference to the head. All nominals refer to a setof entities; the set designated by a modified head is thus a proper subset of the set designated by the head alone.For example, in the nominal bla-ma bzan-po \"virtuous lama\" the modifier bzan-po \"virtuous\" restricts the headbla-ma ''lama,'' and answers the question \"What type of lama?\" The modified head refers to the set of virtuouslamasa proper subset of the set designated by the head alone.2.3. Basic PatternsIn Tibetan the leftmost component of the nominal is generally processed as the head and components to the rightas its modifier. Since a noun or adjective head can be followed by a noun or adjective modifier, there are four basicpatterns of head and modifier. A NOUN can be modified by an ADJECTIVE, as in snags-pa nag-po \"blackmagician\"; a NOUN can be modified by a NOUN, as in bla-ma snags-pa \"lama who is a magician\"; anADJECTIVE can be modified by an ADJECTIVE, as in nag-po tshen-po \"great blackness\"; andalthough certainlynot commonan ADJECTIVE can even be modified by a NOUN, as in nag-po sems \"blackness which is his mind.\"2.4. Extended PatternsSince a modified head is itself a nominal, a combined head and modifier may in turn be a head or modifier withina larger nominal. The processing of such larger nominals generally proceeds through successive bifurcations ofhead and modifier. For example, in the nominal bla-ma bzan-po tshen-po \"great virtuous lama\" the nominal bla-ma bzan-po \"virtuous lama\"itself a head and modifierserves as a leftmost head modified by the adjective tshen-po\"great.\" Similarly, in the nominal bla-ma tshen-po sprul-sku bzan-po \"great lama who is a virtuous incarnation\"the nominal bla-ma tshen-po \"great lama\" serves as a head modified by the nominal sprul-sku bzan-po \"virtuousincarnation.\"1010 We may note here briefly that a nominal such as bla-ma sprul-sku bzan-po is ambiguous between thealternative readings (bla-ma (sprul-sku bza-po))\"lama who is a virtuous incarnation\" and ((bla-ma sprul-sku) bzan-po)\"virtuous lama-who-is-an-incarnation\"; compare the similar ambiguity of English old menand women. Such ambiguity arises, of( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_200next page >"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"page_201file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_201.html[8/7/2010 9:54:05 PM]< previous pagepage_201next page >Page 201Such combinations of head and modifier can be expanded to the limits of stylistic tolerance. A nominal such asbla-ma bzan-po tshen-po mal-Nbyor-pa mi-la ras-pa sprul-sku rin-po-tshe \"great virtuous lama who is the yoginthe precious incarnation Mi-la the cotton-clad\" perhaps approaches but does not exceed these limits. The nominalis thus the EXPANDABLE constituent of the nominal phrase: the various specifiers that follow the nominal areadded only after such expansion is complete.2.5. AdjectivesAn adjectivelike a verbmay be preceded by one or more of several INTENSIFIERS, primarily sin-tu \"very\" andha-tsan \"very,\" but including as well such adverbs as lhag-par ''especially,\" rab-tu \"particularly,\" te-bor ''really,\"yons-su \"completely,\" mtshog-tu \"extremely,\" kun-tu \"entirely.\"Tibetan adjectives are not regularly inflected for degree, as in English. Comparisons are made simply with thesource role particle -las, as in rgyal-po-las tshen-po \"greater than the king,\" na-nin-las bzan-po \"more beautifulthan last year\"; sometimes a particle -Pas, whose origin I do not know,11 is used instead of the source particle -lasto mark the object of comparison, as in Nbras-ldzon-bas gran-ba \"colder than Sikkim,\" sna-ma-bas phyug-pa\"richer than before.\" In this, adjectives are not different from verbs; note, for example, gzan-las NPHAG \"benobler than others,\" rta-bas TSHE \"be bigger than a horse.\"Again, in some texts, a formative yan- \"STILL, YET, MORE\" can give an adjective a comparative sensethustshun-ba \"small\" yan-tshun \"still smaller,\" dga-ba \"happy\" yan-dga \"yet happier,\" bzan-po \"good\" yan-bzan \"evenbetter.\" Thus, too, in the epic, the hero Ge-sar, in the lowly form of Dzo-ru, sings ma-nan Ngog-moi dzo-ru na,skye-nan nan-nasyan-nan red \"I, Dzo-ru, of the miserable mother Ngog-mo, am among those of miserable birthyet more miserable.\"( footnote continued from previous page)course, because the process of bifurcation into head and modifier can begin at either of two places in thenominal.11 This comparative particle -Pas is certainly not the same as -Pa-s, the formative -Pa \"NOMINAL\" plus theagency role particle -KYis. < previous pagepage_201next page >"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"page_202file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_202.html[8/7/2010 9:54:05 PM]< previous pagepage_202next page >Page 202A similar formative, dze- \"MORE AND MORE\" turns a stative verb stem expressing a particular quality into astative verb expressing the increase of that quality over timethus MAN \"be many\" dze-MAN \"be more and more,\"GSAL \"be clear'' dze-GSAL ''be ever more clear,\" PHRA \"be thin\" dze-PHRA \"be thinner and thinner,\" as in dze-gsal-du son \"It has become increasingly clear,\" dze-man Ngro \"They go on becoming more numerous.\" Suchprogressive comparatives are quite frequently reduplicatedthus dze-TSHE dze-TSHE \"be bigger and bigger,\" dze-MTHO dze-MTHO \"be higher and higher,\" dze-BZAN dzeBZAN \"be better and better,\" and even dze-TSHUN de-NUN \"be smaller and smaller,\" as in dze-bzan de-bzan-du son \"She became ever more beautiful,\" tshu-phran man-po dze-tshe dze-tshe-la rgyas \"Many little streams grew bigger and bigger, and became swollen.\" This formative isold in Tibetan; note the following few verses, dating to the mid-seventh century and attributed to the queen Sad-mar-kar, from an archaic chronicle found near Tun-huang:dze-ñe ni dze-ñe-naNearer yes: neareryar-pa ni dgun-dan ñeYar-pa yes: is near the skydgun-skar ni si-li-liStars of the sky yes: si-li-lidze-ñe ni dze-ñe-naNearer yes: nearersnur-ba ni tshab-dan ñeSnur-ba yes: is near the watergyur-sram ni pyo-la-laThe otter yes: pyo-la-ladze-ñe ni dze-ñe-naNearer yes: nearermal-tro ni klum-dan ñeMal-tro yes: is near to Klumskyi-bser ni spu-ru-ruThe cold wind yes: spu-ru-ruSuperlatives are formed in several ways.

Headless ModifiersSometimes a nominal is processed as a modifier without a preceding head. Where the head of the nominal hasbeen established by the context, it may fall under the operation of the Telegram Principle and be omitted asredundant, leaving behind a headless modifier. In such cases English inserts a dummy head such as one, whileTibetan simply leaves the leftmost position vacantthus rta tshen-po \"great horse\" tshen-po \"great one,\" g.yu snon-po \"blue turquoise'' snon-po \"blue one,\" bla-ma bzan-po tshen-po \"great virtuous lama\" bzan-po tshen-po \"greatvirtuous one.\" Similarly, a head can be omitted where it can be recovered not from the preceding text but fromcommon assumptions about the world: in tshen-pos sbyin-pa gton \"The great give gifts,\" or bzan-pos byams-pasgom \"Virtuous people contemplate love,\" the nominals tshen-po \"great\" and bzan-po \"virtuous\" are read asheadless modifiers whose absent head has an indefinite reference to people in general.This means, too, that a nominal such as gtum-po can be processed as being either an ADJECTIVE HEAD (thus\"fury\") or a HEADLESS ADJECTIVE MODIFIER (thus \"furious one\"). Such structural ambiguity isdisambiguated only by the context in which the nominal occurs. For example, compare the two propositions rgyal-pos bzan-po tshen-po bsad \"The king slew the great virtuous one\" and rgyal-pos bzan-po tshen-po thob \"The kingattained great virtue,\" where the verbs SAD \"slay\" and THOB \"attain\"requiring animate and abstract patientsrespectivelydetermine the reading of the nominal. < previous pagepage_203next page >"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"page_204file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_204.html[8/7/2010 9:54:06 PM]< previous pagepage_204next page >Page 2043. PhrasesEvents and their participants are expressed, respectively, by verb and nominal PHRASES; it is these phrases whichthen carry the markers for tense and role. A NOMINAL PHRASE is a nominal with its optional specifiers andmodifiers; a VERB PHRASE is a verb with its optional specifiers and modifiers. We will call the modifier of anominal within the nominal phrase an ADNOMINAL, and the modifier of a verb within the verb phrase anADVERB.123.1. Nominal Phrases3.1.1. Simple Nominal Phrases3.1.1.1. SpecifiersIn a nominal phrase, a nominal may be followed by from zero to six SPECIFIERS. A solitary nominal such as bla-ma \"lama\" or bla-ma snags-pa nag-po tshen-po \"lama who is a great black magician\" refers vaguely to any or allof the entities within the set it defines. The specifier functions to SPECIFY THE SCOPE of this reference, as in,say, bla-ma Ndi ''THIS lama,\" bla-ma-zig \"SOME lama,'' bla-ma lna \"FIVE lamas,\" bla-ma-dag \"MORE THANONE lama,\" bla-ma gan \"ANY lama,\" bla-ma kun \"ALL lamas.\"Some specifiers, such as this or that, specify WHICH member or members of the set denoted by the nominal arereferred to: we will call these DELIMITERS.12 Adverbs and adnominals are interestingly parallel in Tibetan. They are both nominal phrases, of anylength and complexity, marked respectively with the adverb or adnominal particle; adverbs and adnominalsare thus both phrases embedded within phrasesthe adverb within a verb phrase and the adnominal within anominal phraseto the left of the head word; in both cases successive embeddings can take place to thelimits of stylistic tolerance. Compare, for example, mgyogs-po-i rta \"fast horse\" rgyal-po-i mgyogs-po-i rta\"the king's fast horse\" rgya-nag-gi rgyal-po-i mgyogs-po-i rta \"the king of China's fast horse\" withmgyogs-po-r SLEB \"arrive quickly\" nan-pa-r mgyogs-po-r SLEB \"arrive quickly in the morning\" spyi-rnanpa-r mgyogs-po-r SLEB \"generally arrive quickly in the morning,\" and so on.Semantically, both adverbs and adnominals modify their following verb or nominal head. In both cases, themodifier limits or qualifies the head by adding information about it, and answers the question \"What sort of?\"with reference to the head. In both cases, the modified head designates a proper subset of the set designated bythe head alone. < previous pagepage_204next page >"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"page_205file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_205.html[8/7/2010 9:54:07 PM]< previous pagepage_205next page >Page 205Other specifiers, such as five or some, specify HOW MANY members of the set denoted by the nominal arereferred to: we will call these QUANTIFIERS. In classical Tibetan, delimiters and quantifiers are both optionalparts of the nominal phrase; but where either or both occur, their order is fixed as NOMINAL-DELIMITER-QUANTIFIER.There are, furthermore, two different types of delimiter in the classical texts DETERMINERS and REFLEXIVES.Either or both may occur, but, where both occur, two conditions must be met: the determiner must precede thereflexive, and the determiner must be a DEFINITE determiner, as will be discussed below. Similarly, we find inthe classical texts four different types of quantifier: the nominal and its delimiter may be followed by oneNUMERAL, one PLURAL, one TOTALIZER, and one SELECTORalways in that order. The complete array ofavailable specifiers may be diagrammed as follows:Thus the minimum nominal phrase consists simply of a NOMINAL, while the maximum nominal phrase consists,at least theoretically, of the sequence NOMINAL-DETERMINER-REFLEXIVE-NUMERAL-PLURAL-TOTALIZER-SELECTOR. Whether such a maximum sequence occurs (and I certainly have not seen it anywhere,or I would display it here proudly) is a matter of stylistic constraints on syntax; but between these two extremes wefind nominal phrases with various combinations of these constituents, which occur in the order set forth abovethusbla-ma Ndi-dag \"these lamas\" but not ?bla-ma-dag Ndi, rta-dag-rnams \"horses\" but not ?rta-rnams-dag, rgyal-polna-zig \"some five kings\" but not ?rgyal-po-zig lna, snags-pa de-dag kun ''all those magicians\" but < previous pagepage_205next page >"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"page_206file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_206.html[8/7/2010 9:54:07 PM]< previous pagepage_206next page >Page 206not ?snags-pa kun de-dag, mkhas-pa gan-zig \"any wise man\" but not ?mkhaspa-zig gan.The specifier is the last component of a nominal phrase. We therefore sometimes find a specifierusually de\"THAT\" or -TSig \"ONE/SM\"used simply as a PHRASE-CLOSER, to signal the end of a nominal phrase whichhas the invisible -role particle, especially where that phrase, or the next, is long and complex. Conversely, wefrequently find HEADLESS SPECIFIERS, where the nominal head has been omitted by the Telegram Principleforexample, bla-ma de-dag \"those lamas'' de-dag \"those ones,\" dge-slon gan-zig ''any monk\" gan-zig \"any one,\"rgyal-po khon \"he the king\" khon \"he,\" dgon-pa ran \"the same monastery\" ran \"the same one,\" blun-po gsum-zig \"some three fools\" gsum-zig \"some three ones,\" sems-tsan de-dag thams-tsad \"all those sentient creatures\" de-dag thams-tsad \"all those ones,\" and so on.3.1.1.1.1. Delimiters3.1.1.1.1.1. DeterminersA nominal may be followed by a single DETERMINER which delimits its scope by specifying which of thenamed entities is referred to. Such specification in Tibetan may, first, be either DEFINITE or INDEFINITEthat is,may specify the scope of the reference as some determinate subset, as in skyes-bu de \"THAT person,\" or as someindeterminate subset, as in skyes-bu gan \"SOME/ANY person.\" Second, definite determiners may specify the scopeof that determinate subset either in terms of its SPATIAL RELATION to the speaker, as in dgon-pa ya-gi \"themonastery up THERE,\" or in terms of its SPEAKING ROLE in the discourse, as in rnal-Nbyor-pa khyod \"YOUthe yogin.\" We therefore distinguish SPATIAL DETERMINERS from PERSONAL DETERMINERS. Bothpersonal determiners and indefinite determiners, as we shall see, bear some resemblance to English pronouns.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Definite determiners3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.

Personal determinersClassical Tibetan PERSONAL DETERMINERS such as na \"I\" and khyod \"you\" can be seen to occur in exactlythe same syntactic slots as such nonpersonal determiners as Ndi \"THIS\" and de \"THAT\"-for example, bla-ma de\"that lama\" bla-ma khon \"he the lama,\" mi de-rnams \"those men\" mi khyod-rnams \"you men,\" dge-slon Ndi gñis\"these two monks\" dge-slon na gñis \"we two monks,\" mthu-tshen yod-pa de \"the one who has magic power\"mthu-tshen yod-pa na \"I who have magic power.\" Personal determiners, however, are13 The wordpha \"that side\" is usually paired semantically with the word tshu \"this side\"for example, pha-rol \"the other side\" tshu-rol \"this side,\" pha-rol-pa \"adversary\" tshu-rol-pa \"ally.\" Similarly, ya \"up\" issemantically paired with ma \"down\"for example, ya-mtshu \"upper lip\" ma-mtshu \"lower lip,\" ya-them\"lintel\" ma-them \"sill,\" ya-thog \"ceiling\" ma-thog \"floor,\" ya-rabs \"upper class\" ma-rabs \"lower class,\" ya-so \"upper teeth\" ma-so \"lower teeth,\" yar-no \"waxing moon\" mar-no \"waning moon.\" This doubleopposition may be charted as follows:However, when these oppositions are exploited as determiners, presumably tshu represents the position of thespeaker, and the oppositions yield a three-way vertical distinction: < previous pagepage_207next page >"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"page_208file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_208.html[8/7/2010 9:54:09 PM]< previous pagepage_208next page >Page 208syntactically defined as a class by their occurrence before the plural -tsag (thus na-dag \"we\" Ndi-dag \"these,\" na-tsho ''we\" Ndi-tsho \"these,\" na-tsag \"we'' but not ?Ndi-tsag, as well as such forms as khon-tsag-rnams \"they\"parallel to de-dag-rnams \"those\"), although in the later classical texts personal determiners tend to be pluralizedmost frequently by the selector -rnams.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.

In addition, we find the first person ELEGANT determiner bdag and the secondperson elegant determiner ñid (and thus the plural forms bdag-tsag and ñid-tsag). We can schematize thesedeterminers as follows:PERSONUNMARKEDHONORIFICELEGANT1nanedbdag2khyodkhyedñid3khokhon3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Honorific DeterminersHONORIFIC DETERMINERS are used to refer respectfully to persons of higher social or spiritual rankthus zin-pakhyod \"you the farmer\" but bla-ma khyed \"you the lama.\" The higher status may be relative either to the speaker orthe addressee: for example, in the work of Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka we find that the master Mar-pa uses the thirdperson honorific determiner khon \"he\" when speaking to the young Mila ABOUT the lama Rnog-pa and othersenior disciples, but switches to the second person unmarked determiner khyod \"you\" when speaking TO them.The first person honorific ned \"I\" is used when a speaker expresses himself as honored by some relationship with asuperior: for example, again in the work of Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, we find Mar-pa's son saying ned-kyi pha-dzoyod \"There is my lord father,\" we find the yogin Mi-la politely saying ned-kyi lad-mo khyed-kyis mi-on \"It doesnot suit you to imitate me,\" and we find a peasant couple seeking to adopt the famous Mi-la with the words ned-kyi budod mdzod \"Be our foster son!\" When Mi-la describes how he and Mar-pa's wife carried out a deception, heswitches from a first person honorific determiner to a first person unmarked determiner as soon as he becomes thesole actorned gñis-kyis gros byas-nas, nas phye-sgye tshun du-ma-tsig-gi khar < previous pagepage_208next page >"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"page_209file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_209.html[8/7/2010 9:54:09 PM]< previous pagepage_209next page >Page 209dpe-tsha-dan tshas phran-tshegs yod-pa sbrags \"We (ned)counseled together, and then I (na)piled the few booksand possessions I had on top of several small sacks of flour.\"143.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Speaking RolesPersonal determiners occur almost exclusively with nominals whose referents are humanthus, in the old texts, mikhyod \"you the man,\" ma na \"I the mother,\" but not, for example, ?rdo kho \"he the rock.\" Nonpersonaldeterminers, on the other hand, occur with nominals of any sort: bzan-po de can mean either \"that virtue'' or \"thatvirtuous one,'' while bzan-po khon can only mean \"he the virtuous one.\"One way of looking at personal determiners is as specifying the preceding nominal in terms of its SPEAKINGROLE in the discourse: a first person determiner would mean \"THE PERSON NOW SPEAKING,\" a secondperson determiner \"THE PERSON NOW ADDRESSED,\" and a third person determiner \"THE PERSON NOWNEITHER SPEAKING NOR ADDRESSED.\" The identities of the speaker and addressee are, of course, oftenOLD INFORMATION to the participants in a conversation, and thus quite often omittedfor example, na nu \"Theperson now speaking, whose identity you know, weeps/I weep,\" khyod nu \"The person I now address, whoseidentity you know, weeps/You are weeping.\"Especially where this telegraphic ellipsis occurs, we can see how convenient it is to TRANSLATE such personaldeterminers as English pronouns; but there are still significant differences between the two forms. Personaldeterminers in Tibetan are simply determiners that delimit or pick out a nominal in a particular wayin terms ofspeaking role, according to the description offered hereand behave syntactically just like other determiners. Forexample, a personal determiner can specify the speaking role even of a complex nominal, as when Mi-la speaks ofpha mtshan-ldan bla-ma khon \"he my father the excellent lama,\" or when Mar-pa shouts at a disciple rnog-stontshos-rdor zer-bai ma-btsol-ba byed-mkhan khyod \"you who do what you are not supposed to do named Rnog-ston tshos-rdor!\" Further, personal determiners occur much less frequently than English pronouns in any givenrunning length of14 Then again, the unmarked personal determiner khyod \"you\" may be used to express intimacy withrespect to an otherwise superior addressee, as when Mi-pham, in a liturgy addressed to the BuddhaSakyamuni, writes zin-dan dus Ndir rin-tshen rnam-gsum-gyi snan-ba dzi-sñed KHYOD-kyi Nphrin-las-ñid \"In this world and age, to the extent the Three Jewels appear, it is just THY doing.\" < previous pagepage_209next page >"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"page_210file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_210.html[8/7/2010 9:54:10 PM]< previous pagepage_210next page >Page 210text: classical Tibetan tends to rely on ellipsis rather than on pronominalization as a device for back-reference, sothat personal determiners are to a large extent restricted to dialogue or correspondence, where it is importanttextually to keep track of who is saying what to whom.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4. HumilificsIn classical Tibetan we not infrequently find a nominal-such as a term of endearment, title of respect, orprofessional titleused with a personal determiner where in English we would expect either a pronoun or title butnot both. For example, Ras-tshun-pa addresses his master Mi-la with the words RDZE-BTSUN RIN-PO-TSHEKHYED-kyis gsun-du gsol \"I pray that YOU THE PRECIOUS REVEREND speak,\" and Mar-pa's wife speaks ofher husband to Mi-la with the words BLA-MA KHON nas rgya-gar-nas blans-pai tshos Ndi-rnams sems-tsan-laphan-du re-nas blans-pa yin gsun \"HE THE LAMA says, These teachings I brought from India were broughthoping to benefit sentient creatures.\" Less respectful terms are also often found in this construction: when Mi-la isabout to die, his disciple Ras-tshun-pa is puzzled at the celestial portents, and several goddesses rebuke him, sayingSKYES-BU KHYOD-kyis mig-dan ma-ba bkag-nas sdod-payin-nam \"Have YOU FELLOW been standing aroundblocking up your eyes and ears?\"Sometimes, too, such nominals are used without personal determiners: for example, Ras-tshun-pa speaks directlyto Mi-la with the words RDZE-BTSUN-gyis thog-mar dka-spyad-dan sgrub-pa gnas gan-du mdzad \"In what placedid THE REVEREND first practice austerity and meditation?\" and, similarly, Mi-la is asked by some shepherdboys BLA-MA-la bzugs-grogs med-pa lags-sam \"Has THE LAMA no companion?\" Here too we not infrequentlyfind kinship terms, as when Mar-pa asks BU mthon-nam yid tshes-sam \"Did MY SON see? do you believe?\" orwhen Ras-tshun-pa dreams that a goddess takes his hand and says to him TSHA-BO-S go-bar Ndug \"MYNEPHEW understands.''Similarly, nominals with humble or deprecatory connotations are found to occur withor instead offirst persondeterminers: here we find such expressions as nan-bu \"miserable fellow,\" phran \"lowly person,\" mi-rgan \"oldman,\" spran-po \"beggar,\" gus-tshun ''one of little faith,\" ñams-tshun \"destitute one,\" gus-Nbans \"faithful subject,\"Nbans tshun-nu \"lowly subject,\" zag-phun \"miserable lump.\" Such nominals we may conveniently callHUMILIFICS (in contrast to HONORIFICS). For example, in the work of Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, we find a blackmagician saying MI-RGAN NA-S mthu-gtad-ser gsum-zig-la las byas \"I THE OLD MAN have worked in magic,curses, and hailstorms,\" while Mi-la sings, in one of the songs anthologized over his name, SPRAN-Po-i skyid- < previous pagepage_210next page >"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"page_211file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_211.html[8/7/2010 9:54:10 PM]< previous pagepage_211next page >Page 211sdug khyed-ran ses \"You know THIS BEGGAR'S happiness and sorrow,\" and, in the ancient stories found amongthe Central Asian manuscripts, we find NAN-BU ni bros-de mtshis-so \"THIS MISERABLE FELLOW ran awayand came.\"Such humilifics are often found in correspondence: the Tibetan epistolary style delights in such flowery locutionsas the following, in a letter to the Dalai Lama:skyabs-mgon tshen-poi thugs-rdzes gan-gi bka-drin-la rtag-tu spyod-pai NBANS TSUN-NU BDAG kyangsar-slad rigs-med tsam-nas zabs-Ndegs-la lhag-bsam-gyi spobs-pa Ndegs-bzin-par gnas lagsBy your compassion, great lord protector, to whose grace I YOUR LOWLY SUBJECT ever have recourse,I remain without new corruption daring to hope that I may serve you.Even in a relatively informal letter such as the following we find the humilific phran \"lowly person\" where inEnglish we would find a personal pronoun:Ngyur-ba med-pai yid-gtsugs ldan-pa tse-khae lags-kyi drun-du, khyed-kyi gsuns-bris Nbyor-bas PHRAN-dan PHRAN-gyi zla-bo gñis dga-spro dpag-tu med-pa skyes byunTo the honorable presence of our unwaveringly beloved Jack: Receipt of your honored letter has madeTHIS LOWLY PERSON and THIS LOWLY PERSON'S wife both immeasurably happy.Something of this humilific style may occasionally be encountered in didactic prose as well, as when aphilosophical writer says BLUN-PO BDAG-gi rmons-tshod ltar-na \"In the ignorant opinion of THIS FOOLISHPERSON ME . . .\" or when even a grammarian can write BLUN-PO BDAG RAN-gi Nthad-pa ltar-na \"In MYOWN FOOLISH PERSON'S belief . . .\"The classical texts contain some interesting humilifics. In the epic of Ge-sar we find that a heroine will speak ofherself as ser-mo \"finger\" and sen-mo \"fingernail,\" both perhaps in the sense of \"appendage, dependent.\"Interestingly, some humilifics appear to have the OLDER RELATIVE FORMATIVE a- prefixed to them: forexample, we find a-ser-mo ''old finger\" alongside ser-mo \"finger.\" The common expression a-bo ~ a-pho is anaffectionate < previous pagepage_211next page >"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"page_212file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_212.html[8/7/2010 9:54:11 PM]< previous pagepage_212next page >Page 212prefix to the names and epithets of lay persons, as in a-bo mthu-tshen \"Friend Magician.\" This term too is foundas a humilific, as in a-bo na \"this old fellow.\"3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.5. From Humilific to Personal DeterminerWe can see that a humilific such as phran \"lowly person\" can lose much of its deprecatory connotation and behaveSEMANTICALLY very much like an elegant first person determinerthus, for example, phran-gyi zla-bo \"thislowly person's wife  my wife.\" Indeed, it seems that some humilifics have come, at various times, to behaveSYNTACTICALLY as personal determiners as well. For example, in an archaic mythological text from CentralAsia, we find the humilific nan-bu \"miserable fellow\"for example, in NAN-BU ni bros-de mtshis-so \"THISMISERABLE FELLOW ran away and came\" and NAN-BU pha-yab-kyi mtshan lton-de me-bkru \"THISMISERABLE FELLOW'S honorable father's name is Lton-de me-bkru.'' This humilific is then pluralized with thepersonal determiner plural -tsag in the expression MY NRAN-tsag spun gsum ''WE MISERABLE FELLOWS, threebrothers .. .\" More recently, the term nos \"side, direction\" (as in Nos-kyi zla-bo \"THIS SIDE'S wife  my wife\") isfound in the plural form nos-tsag \"we\"; the present Dalai Lama, we may add, has written an autobiography entitlednos-kyi yul-dan os-kyi mi-man \"My Land and My People.\" In the case of nan-bu \"miserable fellow\" in the earlyperiod and of nos \"side\" in the later period, a humilific has come to behave syntactically as well as semantically asa first person determiner. It is tempting to see in such elegant determiners as bdag a similar history, with a similarintermediate phase of use as a humilific bdag \"self.\"3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.6. Sex-Marked Personal DeterminersAlongside na \"I\" even in the earliest archaic Central Asian texts we find the term kho-bo used with a first personreference, as in sa ni kho-bos Ntshal-do \"As for the meat, I ate it.\" The term persists through the classical languageas a personal determiner: we find such terms as mi kho-bo \"I the man\" as well as the plural form kho-bo-tsag\"we.\" Yet we also find such syntactic anomalies as kho-bo na, suggesting that the term still retained, for somewriters, a flavor of its presumably nominal origin, perhaps as a humilific related to the form khyo \"person, man.\"In the classical texts, too, at least as early as in the ninth-century translation of the Mdzans-blun zes bya-bai mdofrom its Chinese original, there appears the innovative form kho-mo as the feminine equivalent of the earlier term;by the fourteenth century the first person semantic field had enlarged to include kho-bo as a first person masculinedeterminer, used by a male speaker to refer to himself, and kho-mo as a first person feminine < previous pagepage_212next page >"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"page_213file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_213.html[8/7/2010 9:54:11 PM]< previous pagepage_213next page >Page 213determiner, similarly used by a female speaker. Note the similarly sex-marked derivatives khyo-bo \"husband\" andkhyo-mo \"wife\" from khyo ''person, man.\"In classical texts influenced by Middle Tibetan the same process seems to be repeated with the noun mo \"woman,female,\" which begins to function as a third person feminine determiner: for example, in the biography of Mi-laraspa we find such phrases as ma-rgan mo \"she the old mother,\" and such propositions as bu-mo de-la tshed-gñer-gyis bskul-bas, MO-S dun-rdog bdun phul \"They earnestly urged the girl, so SHE offered me seven small shells.\"Given such usage, we find the third-person semantic field shifting to accommodate the new term: the previouslyunmarked form kho begins to be read as a third person masculine determiner. We can schematize the resultingpattern of sex-specific determiners as follows:PERSONUNMARKEDMASCULINEFEMININE1nakho-bokho-mo2khyod3khomo3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.7. Personal Determiner TailsOccasionally in more colloquial registers we find a personal determiner preceding rather than following thenominal head it delimitsfor example, ned spun gsum \"we three brothers,\" khyed grwa-pa-rnams \"you monks,\"khon grogs-po-rnams \"they my friends.\" We may perhaps best consider such constructions to be parentheticalidentifications of a personal determiner for purposes of clarification or emphasis: the nominal following thedeterminer is in the nature of an afterthought or TAIL. This analysis would seem to be supported by the fact that insuch constructions the personal determiner and the nominal may occasionally be quantified separatelyfor example,bdag-tsag tshon-po-rnams \"we merchants,\" kho-mo-tsag spun gñis \"we two sisters.'' Thus we find an ancestor ofMi-la shouting na khyun-po dzo-sras on-gin yod-do \"It is IKhyun-po dzo-sraswho is coming!\" and his mothercrying out na myan-tsha dkar-rgyan-la da-lan-las ñams dga-ba e-yon ltos-dan \"Just see whether IMyan-tshadkar-rgyanwill ever feel happier than now!\" And, in a song to his sister, Mi-la sings nai spyod-pa-la bltas-nasmyon-pa Ndra, khyod srin-mos bltaskyin yi-mug skye \"If you look at my behavior it is like a madman; you mysister look upon it and despair.\" < previous pagepage_213next page >"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"page_214file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_214.html[8/7/2010 9:54:12 PM]< previous pagepage_214next page >Page 2143.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.8. The Archaic Determiner o~uWe can here take note of an archaic determiner o~u with a wide variety of written reflexes. When pluralized with -tsag it appears to be a first person determiner: we find otsag~u-tsag~a-tsag-u-bu-tsag~yu-bu-tsag~yu-tsag \"we,\"as well as the forms o-skol~u-skol \"we,\" persisting from the earliest Central Asian manuscripts well into thenineteenth century. In the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, for example, we find the forms o-skol (as in o-skol-la g.yuNdi ga-nas byun \"Where did we get this turquoise from?\"), o-tsag (as in o-tsag blos ma-thons-pa min \"It's not thathe didn't forsake us\"), and u-tsag (as in khon-tshoi mthu-dan u-tsag-gi mthu mi-Ndrao \"Our magic is not the sameas their magic''). Such forms are particularly liable to textual variation: for example, one occurrence is given as o-tsag by three blockprints of the Mi-la, but as u-tsag by the fourth.153.1.1.1.1.1.2. Indefinite determinersDefinite determiners specify the scope of reference of the preceding nominal as extending to certain determinatemembers of the denominated set; INDEFINITE determiners specify that scope as extending potentially to everymember of that set. For example, in mi na \"I the man,\" the definite determiner na \"I\" limits the reference of thenominal mi \"man\" to the person then speaking; but in mi gan \"some man, any man,\" the indefinite determiner gan\"some, any'' specifies that the reference extends potentially to any member of the set denominated by mi \"man\"thus,for example, in the chronicle Rgyal-rabs gsal-bai me-lon, sans-rgyas GAN-gis kyan ma-btsags-pa \"not trodden byANY Buddha.\"There are four indefinite determiners in Tibetangan \"INDEFINITE NOMINAL/ any, some, whatever,\" tsi\"INDEFINITE NONANIMATE/any, some, whatever,\" su \"INDEFINITE HUMAN BEING/any, some, whoever,\"nam \"INDEFINITE TIME/any, some, whenever.\" As the definitions indicate, these determiners occur only withcertain types of nominal. The most general indefinite determiner is gan15 It is not at all clear whether this personal determiner is the same as the old determiner o \"that\" preservedin stereotyped connectiveso-na~on \"in that  well, now, but,\" on-kyan \"even in that - nevertheless,\" on-te\"being in that  on the other hand.\" It is perhaps this latter determiner which is to be compared withChepang uw~ow, Garo ua, Burmese hui Dhimal u \"that.\" < previous pagepage_214next page >"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"page_215file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_215.html[8/7/2010 9:54:12 PM]< previous pagepage_215next page >Page 215\"whatever,\" which can act as specifier of any type of head;16 but tsi \"whatever\" occurs only with nominals thathave nonanimate referents, su \"whoever'' only with those that have human referents, and nam ''whenever\" only withthose that refer generally or specifically to a period of time.Quel pivot, j'entends, dans ces contrastes, à l'intelligibilité? il faut uneguarantieLa Syntaxe.Stéphane Mallarmé, Le Mystère dans les lettresThese four forms actually perform three different chores in the Tibetan language. First, as we have said, they canspecify that the reference of a preceding nominal extends potentially to any member of the set that nominaldenominates, as in mi gan bsad-na \"If one has killed any man .. .\" Second, they can serve as dummy role particlecarriers in a relative construction, as in mi gan bsad-pa \"The man whom one has killed . . .\" And, third, they canmark the queried participant in an information question, as in mi gan bsad \"What man was killed?\"These three uses are not as easily confused as might at first appear. It is true that the sequence skye-bo gan by itselfdoes not give us enough information to tell which function the gan is performing. But, as these examples show,there is seldom confusion when the sequence occurs in the context of particular syntactic constructionsthus skye-bogan-gis sans-rgyas mthon-na \"If/ when SOME PERSON sees the Buddha . . .\" skye-bo gan-gis sans-rgyas mthon-ba \"the PERSON WHO sees the Buddha,\" skye-bo gan-gis sans-rgyas mthon \"WHAT PERSON sees the Buddha?\" The last two usesrelative and interrogativewill be discussed in the appropriate sections later in this text.16 The form gan is sometimes reduced to ga- before the locus and adverb particlesfor example, in theTibetan translation of the Karmasataka, btsom-ldan-Ndas GA-la bzugs-te, bdag-la dgons-zig-gu \"Couldthe Blessed One be dwelling SOMEWHERE and thinking of me?\" < previous pagepage_215next page >"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"page_216file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_216.html[8/7/2010 9:54:13 PM]< previous pagepage_216next page >Page 2163.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Headless indefinitesOften it is perfectly clear from context or general knowledge what the nominal head of an indefinite determiner issupposed to be; in such a case, of course, the nominal head can be telegraphically omitted, leaving a HEADLESSINDEFINITE. For example, in khyod snar su-la yan gsol-ba ma-btab-bam \"Haven't you previously sent aninvitation to ANYONE?\" the determiner SU \"INDEFINITE HUMAN BEING\" is processed as the specifier of anomitted nominal head such as mi ''person\"thus \"Haven't you previously sent an invitation to some/any/whoever(person)?'' In this example, too, the fact that the referent of the omitted nominal is to human beingsor gods orspirits or demons, who are syntactically humanis given by the determiner su, which specifies only such humannominals.17Headless indefinite constructions are not uncommon, and are the means by which didactic authors make sweepinggeneralizations. For example, in the Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter by Sa-skya pandita, we read sems-tsanmos-pa sna-tshogs-pas, thams-tsad mgu-bar su-s kyan dka \"The pleasures of sentient creatures are varied, so it ishard for ANYONE to please them all,\" GAN-zig phun-sum-tshogs Ndod-na, de-yis Ndu-Ngod man-du bya \"IfANYONE desires excellence, he should mingle much with others,\" GAN-la blo-gros m-ldan-na, bstan-btsos legs-kyan su-zig len \"If SOMEONE is without intelligence, though a teaching be good, who accepts it?\" Note, as inthese examples, that indefinite determiners frequently co-occur with the selector -TSig and the connective Yan-thussu yan \"anyone at all,\" gan-zig \"someone,\" nam yan \"whenever.\"3.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Indefinite adverbsThe formative dziwhich is apparently related to the indefinite determiner tsi, but is not the sameyields a specialclass of indefinite determiners which we will here call INDEFINITE ADVERBS.18 These are adverbs primarily of17 And note the following example, from an archaic Central Asian manuscriptun-nas gtsig-la gtsig dmagdran-ste, res-Nga su-s rgyal, res-Nga su-s pham-bar on-no \"Then they led armies one against the other,and it came to be that sometimes ONE OF THEM/WHOEVER would be victorious, and sometimes ONEOF THEM/WHOEVER would be defeated.\"18 Although these indefinite adverbs are normally formed with the dzi- prefix, we(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_216next page >"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"page_217file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_217.html[8/7/2010 9:54:13 PM]< previous pagepage_217next page >Page 217manner and extent,19 which most frequently utilize the totalizers sñed \"no less than,\" tsam \"as much as,\" srid \"aslong as,\" and the simile-creating -bzin ''like, as,\" -lta--lta-bu--lta-ba \"like, as\"thus, for example, dzi-lta-r''INDEFINITE MANNER/in whatever way, however,\" dzi-srid-du \"INDEFINITE EXTENT/ to whatever extent,however long.\" Since indefinite adverbs are distinctively marked with the dzi- prefix, the adverb particle -Tu isredundant, and is, accordingly, not infrequently omitted, especially under the constraints of meter.Note the following from the Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter by Sa-skya panditadzi-srid ran-stobs ma-rdzogs-na, de-yi bar-du dgra-rnams bkur \"However long it takes to perfect one's own strength, during that interval onehonors one's enemies,\" nan-pa dzi-ltar btsos gyur-yan, ran-bin bzan-po Nbyun mi-srid \"However one may correctan evil person, it is impossible for him to have a good nature,\" Nbab-tshu dzi-ltar bzlog gyur-kyan, thur-du Nbab-pa kho-nar Ndod \"Any way you dam up a river, it still wants nothing but to flow downward.\" Sometimes anindefinite adverb of manner may as plausibly be read as an adverb of extentfor example, again from Sa-skyapandita, dam-pa dzi-ltar rgud gyur-kyan, sdig-dan Ndres-pai zas mi-za \"However impoverished a holy personbecomes, he does not eat food that is mixed with sin,\" tshu ni dzi-ltar skol gyur-kyan, me-ru Nbar-ba mi-srid-do\"However long you boil water, it still won't catch on fire,\" mkhas-pa dzi-ltar thabs brdugs-kyan, blun-po Ndzug-pai lam mi-Ngro \"However much a wise man may be without means, he still will not go on the path taken byfools.\"20( footnote continued from previous page)sometimes find tsi substituted sporadically in some manuscripts; similar forms with gansuch as gan-bzin-duare also occasionally found.19 This is presumably what the Tibetan grammarians are referring to when they say dpe-dan tshad-gzal-ba-ladzi thob \"The form dzi obtains for manner and extent.\" Actually, the term dpe means \"example, simile,\" buthere clearly refers to the simile-creating -bzin and -lta, which, with the dzi- prefix, yield indefinite adverbs ofmanner. The grammarians continue, by saying don-la tsi thob \"The form tsi obtains for the thing itself,\" which,if I understand it correctly, would seem to comport with the analysis given here.20 The prefix dzi- also occurs more or less sporadically with terms other than these five; indeed, it seems to beable to make an indefinite adverb of manner or extent out of just about anything.

A phrasesuch as bla-ma-dag \"MORE THAN ONE lama/lamas\"which is MARKED for quantitywill be used onlywhen such specific information is felt to be necessary for understanding.26 An exception to the word order rule can occasionally be found where a numeral is part of a commoncollocation, and is felt to be part of the nominal itself, rather than a specifier of the nominalfor example, pha-rol phyin-pa drug Ndi \"these Six Perfections\" as opposed to pha-rol phyin-pa Ndi drug \"these six perfections,\"rgyal-po bzi de \"those Four Kings\" as opposed to rgyal-po de bzi \"those four kings.\" < previous pagepage_221next page >"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"page_222file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_222.html[8/7/2010 9:54:16 PM]< previous pagepage_222next page >Page 222bdun \"seventeen,\" btso-brgyad \"eighteen,\" btsu-dgu \"nineteen.\"27Multiples of ten from twenty to ninety are formed on the pattern TWO-TEN, THREE-TEN, and so onthus ñi-su\"twenty,\" sum-tsu \"thirty,\" bzi-btsu \"forty,\" lna-btsu \"fifty,\" drug-tsu ''sixty,'' bdun-tsu \"seventy,\" brgyad-tsu\"eighty,\" dgubtsu \"ninety.\"28The numbers from twenty to ninety-nine regularly use the syllable -rtsa to separate tens from unitsfor example, ñi-su-rtsa gtsig \"twenty-one,\" ñi-su-rtsa gñis \"twenty-two,\" ñi-su-rtsa gsum \"twenty-three,\" sum-tsu-rtsa bzi \"thirty-four,\" bdun-tsu-rtsa lna \"seventy-five,\" dgu-btsu-rtsa dgu \"ninety-nine.\"3.1.1.1.2.1.2. Clipped numeralsQuite often the numerals from twenty-one to ninety-nine are found in peculiarly CLIPPED forms. We find ñer <ñi-su-rtsa, and thus ñer-gtsig \"twenty-one,\" ñer-gñis \"twenty-two,\" ñer-gsum \"twenty-three\"; so < sum-tsu-rtsa,and thus so-gtsig \"thirty-one,\" so-gñis \"thirty-two,\" so-gsum \"thirty-three\"; ze < bzi-btsu-rtsa, and thus ze-gtsig\"forty-one\"; na < lna-btsu-rtsa, and thus na-gtsig \"fifty-one\"; re < drug-tsu-rtsa, and thus re-gtsig \"sixty-one\";don < bdun-tsu-rtsa, and thus don-gtsig \"seventy-one\"; gya < brgyad-tsu-rtsa, and thus gya-gtsig \"eighty-one\";and go < dgu-btsu-rtsa, and thus go-bdun \"ninety-seven,\"go-brgyad \"ninety-eight,\" go-dgu \"ninety-nine.\" Theseclipped numerals are invariably the forms used in numbering the folios of a Tibetan book.Such clipped numerals are also found, in classical texts influenced by Middle Tibetan, instead of -rtsa to separatetens from unitsfor example, sum-tsu-so bdun instead of sum-tsu-rtsa bdun \"thirty-seven,\" bzi-btsu-ze drug insteadof bzi-btsu-rtsa drug \"forty-six,\" lna-btsu-na lna instead of lna-btsu-rtsa lna \"fifty-27 Note that the HIGH BACK vowel u of btsu \"ten\" becomes the LOW BACK vowel o of btso- when it isfollowed by the LOW BACK vowel a of the numerals lna \"five\" and brgyad \"eight.\" This change is theonly tongue HEIGHT assimilation I know of in the language.28 It is remarkable to find ñi-su \"twenty\" instead of the expected *gñis-btsu, and sum-tsu \"thirty\" instead of theexpected *gsum-btsu. Further, the preinitial b- of btsu \"ten\" is deleted after preceding closed syllables butretained after preceding open syllablesfor example, bzi-btsu \"forty\" but drug-tsu \"sixty\" instead of *drug-btsu.This foreshadows similar changes throughout the lexicon in several New Tibetan dialects; it is interesting thatthese phonological changes began in the number system before spreading elsewhere. < previous pagepage_222next page >"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"page_223file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_223.html[8/7/2010 9:54:17 PM]< previous pagepage_223next page >Page 223five,\" drug-tsu-re bzi instead of drug-tsu-rtsa bzi \"sixty-four,\" bdun-tsu-don gsum instead of bdun-tsu-rtsa gsum\"seventy-three,\" brgyad-tsu-gya gñis instead of brgyad-tsu-rtsa gñis \"eighty-two,'' dgu-btsu-go gtsig instead ofdgu-btsu-rtsa gtsig \"ninety-one.\" Only the twenties are exceptions: we find only ñi-su-rtsa and not ?ñi-su-ñer.This usage is now standard in several New Tibetan dialects.293.1.1.1.2.1.3. Numerals as selectorsIn some archaic manuscripts from Central Asia, the numeral dgu \"nine\" is used as a selector in the sense of\"MANY\" or \"ALL\" (for example, gnod-dgu \"all harms,\" lha-dgu ''the many gods,\" dgra-dgu \"all enemies\"), asense preserved in later texts in the use of -dgu \"ALL\" as a nominalizer, as in Ndod-dgu \"all that one desires.\" Inthe same texts we also find the numeral gsum \"three\" used as a selector in the sense of \"ALL\" or \"EVERY\" bothwith common nouns (for example, ñin-sum \"every day,\" g.yan-sum \"all good fortune\") and with place names (forexample, gtan-sum \"all of Gtan,\" rgya-lsum \"the whole of Rgyal,\"), a sense preserved in such seteotyped phrasesof the later texts as mnon-sum \"wholly manifest\" and phun-sum \"completely perfect.\" In these later texts too thenumeral Nbum \"hundred thousand\" takes on the sense previously held by dgu \"nine,\" and we find expressions suchas gsun-Nbum \"hundred thousand sayings  the complete works\" and mgur-Nbum \"hundred thousand songs  thecomplete poems.\"3.1.1.1.2.1.4. Large numbersThe Tibetans inherited from the Indians not only their decimal systemwhich passed through Arab intermediaries toEurope as wellbut also a love of very large numbers and specific names for many of them.30 Thus we find the29 For example, we find New Tibetan (Lhasa) sumtsu (Ladakh) sumtsu sosum <sum-tsu-so gsum>\"thirty-three,\" (Lhasa) (Ladakh) rgyattsu gyagu <brgyad-tsu-gya dgu > \"eighty-nine.\" Thus, too,we find New Tibetan (Lhasa) ñisu tsaksom (Ladakh) ñisu rtsaksum <ñi-su-rtsa gsum > \"twenty-three\" butnot (Lhasa) ?siptsu tsasom (Ladakh) ?zibtsu rtsaksum <bzi-btu-rtsa gsum>\"forty-three.\"30 It has plausibly been suggested that the Indian love of large numbers correlates with an intense dislike forfractions: the relations of large-scale cycles such as planetary align-( footnote continued on the next page) < previous pagepage_223next page >"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"page_224file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_224.html[8/7/2010 9:54:17 PM]< previous pagepage_224next page >Page 224the following names for the numbers from one hundred to one quintillion brgya \"100,\" ston \"1,000,\" khri ''10,000,\"Nbum \"100,000,\" sa-ya ''1,000,000,\" bye-ba \"10,000,000,\" dun-phyur \"100,000,000,\" ther-Nbum \"1,000,000,000,\"ther-Nbum tshen-po \"10,000,000,000,\" khrag-khrig \"100,000,000,000,\" khrag-khrig tshen-po \"1,000,000,000,000,\"rab-bkram \"10,000,000,000,000,\" rab-bkram tshen-po \"100,000,000,000,000,\" gtams \"1,000,000,000,000,000,\"gtams tshen-po \" 10,000,000,000,000,000,\" dkrigs \"100,000,000,000,000,000,\" and dkigs tshen-po\"1,000,000,000,000,000,000.\" It should come as no surprise that these names are not used with completeconsistency.Multiples of these larger numbers are formed, like the multiples of ten, on the pattern ONE-HUNDRED, TWO-THOUSAND, THREE-TEN-THOUSAND, and so onthus tshig-brgya or brgya \"one hundred,\" ñi-brgya \"twohundred,\" sum-brgya \"three hundred,\" bzi-brgya \"four hundred,\" lna-brgya \"five hundred\"; tshig-ston or ston \"onethousand,\" ñi-ston \"two thousand,\" sum-ston \"three thousand,\" bzi-ston \"four thousand,\" lna-ston \"five thousand\";tshig-khri or khri \"ten thousand,\" ñi-khri \"twenty thousand,\" brgyad-khri \"eighty thousand,\" dgu-khri \"ninetythousand.\" Note the reduced forms tshig-for gtsig \"one,\" ñi-for gñis \"two,\" and sum- for gsum \"three\"; the othernumerals are prefixed in their full forms.Combinations of these numerals are straightforward if certain principles are borne in mind. The numbers from oneto nineteen form a single unit over against those fom twenty to ninety-nine. An omitted number slotthat is, a zero-is optionally but frequently filled with the place marker -dan, except for the last empty slot: thus we find, forexample, ñi-brgya-dan gñis \"two hundred and two\" and bzi-ston-dan lna-btsu \"four thousand and fifty\" but bdun-brgya dgu-btsu \"seven hundred ninety.\"31 And a number such as \"twenty-two thousand\" is in Tibetan ñi-khri ñi-ston \"two ten-thousands two thousands\" rather than, as in English, ?ñi-su-rtsa gñis ston.

FractionsTibetan fractions are constructed regularly with the formative -tsha \"part,\" related to tsha \"part, portion, share.\"Thus we find gsum-tsha \"third part,\" bi-tsha \"fourth part,\" so-gñis-tsha \"thirty-second part,\" brgya-tsha\"hundredth part,\" ston-tsha \"thousandth part.\" Such resulting nouns may in turn be quantified by a numeralthusgsum-tsha gtsig \"one third,\" gsum-tsha gñis \"two thirds,\" bzi-tsha gsum \"three fourths,\" brgyad-tsha lna \"fiveeighths,\" brgya-tsha go-dgu \"ninety-nine hundredths.\"The only fraction not regularly formed by this process is phyed \"half.\" An interesting locution should here benoted.

This text, in part, describes what will happen to a gñer-pa \"quartermaster\" who does notfill his paper quota. The reduplication in sog-sog \"paper\" is lexical and not distributive.

Weights and measuresVarious weights and measures are found mentioned in the classical texts. Many of these seem relativelyinformalthus, do \"a load of ,\" sgam \"a box of ,\" kha ''a piece of ,\"34 Nbo \"a basket of -.\" Other terms are apparentlypart of measure systems: thus for LENGTH we find sor-mo ''inch,\" mtho \"span,\" khru \"cubit,\" Ndom \"fathom\"; forVOLUME we find bre \"measure,\" khal \"bushel/load = 20 bre\"; for WEIGHT we find skar-ma \"one point on thesteelyard,\" zo \"dram = 10 skar-ma,\" sran \"ounce = 10 zo.\"35Weights and measures are defined syntactically by occurrence not only with gtsig \"one\" and gñis \"two\" but alsooften with gan \"a full \" and do \"a double ,\" as in mtho gan \"one span,\" bre do \"two measures,\" khru gan \"a fullcubit,\" sran do \"a double ounce.\" Numerals greater than two appear in regular form-thus gser gzons-pa gan \"atubful of gold\" but gser zo sum-brgya \"three hundred drams of gold.\"34 In modern Tibetan, a kha is a square of clothor, put another way, a piece of cloth as long as thatparticular roll of cloth is wide.35 Money in Tibetan is often expressed as weights of silver. The term for \"coin\" or money generally is don-tse~don-tshe~don-rtse < Middle Chinese *dhun-tsi. The least valuable coin in use was traditionally the copperkha, which was worth, in terms of silver, a weight of about two and a half skar-ma. Thus two kha wereequivalent to skar-ma lna \"five points on the steelyard,\" three kha to skar-ma phyed-brgyad \"seven and a halfpoints,\" and four kha to skar-ma btsu \"ten points,\" which was the same as one zo \"dram\" or one-tenth dnul-sran \"silver sran.\"Six kha were equivalent to one dnul-gyi don-tse \"silver coin\" or tamka~dnul-tam < Sanskrit tankaka (compareHindi tanga)\"stamped silver coin.\" Forty kha, of course, equalled ten zo or one sran of silver. Fifty silver sranwere the equivalent of a bar of silver bullion, weighing about four pounds, widely used for trading in CentralAsia, and variously called rdo-tshad \"stone-weight,\" rta-rmig-ma \"horse-hoof,\" and yam-bu \"Kathmandu.\" < previous pagepage_228next page >"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"page_229file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_229.html[8/7/2010 9:54:20 PM]< previous pagepage_229next page >Page 2293.1.1.1.2.1.10.

Even largernumbers may be expressed using long vowels, written with subscript atshun--thus ka through a = 151 through180, ki through i = 181 through 210, and so on through o = 300.36These numerals can be made into ordinals by suffixing the formative -pa thus ka-pa \"the kath(volume)  VolumeI,\" ki-pa \"the kith(volume) Volume XXXI.\" These ordinals are often found with locus or adverb particles infootnotes, indices, and catalogues-for example, na-pa-la ''in the nathin Volume IV,\" i-par \"in the ith? inVolume LX.\"PAGE numbers are always written out and are invariably clipped. Each folio in a book is paginated separately,usually along the left-hand margin of the recto; the left-hand margin of the verso often contains the short title ofthe text. Where a distinction is made between sides of a folio, the recto is called gon-ma \"upper\" and the verso iscalled og-ma \"lower\"thus re-gtsig gon-ma \"folio 61a,\" sum-brgya go-bdun og-ma \"folio 397b\"or sometimes mdun\"front'' and rgyab \"back,\" respectively.Occasionally folios are paginated in the margin with volume number as wellfor example, ga don-drug \"Volume IIIfolio 76,\" kha gya-sum gon-ma \"Volume II folio 83a.\" Where several independently paginated texts have beencollected into a single volume (for example, in a uniform edition of several different rituals for a particular deity),both volume and text may be given alongside the folio numberthus ta dza ñer-gtsig \"Volume IX Work VII folio21,\" tsa tsa btso-brgyad \"Volume V Work XVII folio 18.\" The final folio of a text is often marked by the wordbyon \"finished\" after the folio number; where a text is only one folio long, that folio is sometimes paginated asgtsi-gpuo \"solitary,\" but more often as bse-ru \"rhinocerous,\" an animal that traditionally wanders alone.36 There are variants on this schemefor example, ka = 1, ki = 2, ku = 3, ke = 4, ko = 5, kha = 6, and so on.Sometimes, also, volumes are numbered by the use of stock phrasesthus, for example, om = 1, ah = 2, hum= 3; or ñi = 1, zla = 2; or e = 1, warm = 2, ma = 3, ya = 4; and so on. < previous pagepage_229next page >"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"page_230file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_230.html[8/7/2010 9:54:20 PM]< previous pagepage_230next page >Page 2303.1.1.1.2.2.2 PluralsThe older PLURALS include -dag (perhaps the most common quantifier in the archaic Central Asian manuscripts),-tsho (in the most ancient materials tshogs~Ntshogs \"multitude\"),37 and -tsag (only after personal determinerseven in the oldest texts). All these plurals may be glossed, simply, as \"MORE THAN ONE\"thus, for example, bla-ma-dag \"lamas,\" tshon-pa-tsho ''merchants,\" ned-tsag ''we.\"38 Fairly frequent in the Central Asian manuscriptsand completely absent in this usage in the later materialis the plural -otsog~tshog; we find, for example, myio-tsog\"people,\" srin-no-tshog \"demons,\" lhao-tshog \"gods,\" nam-ti-go-tsog \"Nam-tig folk.\"39In the course of time, these older plurals fell into disuse, to be largely replaced by the newer SELECTOR -rnams.After the ninth century, the plural -dag is found, where it is used at all, primarily after numerals and determiners,sometimes in the collocation -dag-rnams. Otherwise it is found only to translate the Sanskrit dual number andvocative plural, a specialization that is the mark of its demise. The plural -tsho similarly occurs, with decreasingfrequency, primarily after determiners and numerals of 100,000 or larger; -tsag continues to appear sporadically,still exclusively after personal determiners.3.1.1.1.2.3.

SelectorsThe SELECTORS found in the classical texts are -rnams, -Tsig, thams-tsad, and kun. Selectors, unlike plurals, donot specify simply that there is more than one entity referred to; instead, selectors specify what we can call theRANGE of entities referred to in the set denoted by the nominal, rather like English one/a, some/sm,41 all.The selector -rnams \"SEPARATE UNITS\" is etymologically connected with the noun rnam-pa \"piece, part,section, item, installment, individual,\"42 and thus marks the nominal phrase as consisting of things or personstaken individually, and hence, by implication, as plural: we can compare od-zer rnam-pa bzi ''four (separate) beamsof light\" with od-zer-rnams \"beams of light,\" mi rnam-pa gñis ''two (sorts of) man\" with mi-rnams \"men,\" and zal-zas rnam-pa \"the separate dishes of a meal\" with zal-zas-rnams \"food/foods.\"It should be borne in mind that -ams is not a plural: rdo-rnams does not mean \"rocks/more than one rock\" so muchas it means \"rocks/pieces of rock,\" just as Nbras-rnams means \"portions of rice/grains of rice,\" tshu-rnams means\"bowls of water/bodies of water,\" ba-rnams means \"head of cattle,\" sog-bu-rnams means \"pieces of paper,\" and x-rnams means \"appropriate units of x.\" This reading is borne out by the archaic Central Asian manu-41 In English we can distinguish the word some in, say, Some people are never satisfied from the wordsome/sm in, say, Give me sm beer. It is this latter some which is comparable to Tibetan selectors; the formersome represents the term \"SOME/ANY\" (note the related question Are any people ever satisfied?)and isexpressed in Tibetan primarily by indefinite determiners.42 Among the archaic Tibetan manuscripts found at the oasis garrisons of Central Asia we find, for example,sñun gsol-gi mtshid-yig snar RNAM du-ma-zig gsol-na lan ma-mtshis \"Although I have previously sentrespectful letters inquiring about your illness on several OCCASIONS, you have not made reply,\" blon kon-gigsol-tshig RNAM-tshig-las bdag-gi phu-bo klu-bzer khar-tsa-tshin rñin-pai ston-dpon Ntshal zes gsol \"In oneEXAMPLE of a petition by Minister Kon he asks, 'Appoint my elder brother Klu-bzer Commander-of-the-Thousand of Old Khar-tsa-tshin,\"' rgyu-god-kyiphyag-rgya RNAM gtshig nod-du gsol \"We ask to receive oneauthorization for expenses,\" myes-poi mtshid-drin Ndi RNAM giñs-las ma-mtshis \"We have had only these twoPIECES of kind correspondence as to our grandfather.\" < previous pagepage_232next page >"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"page_233file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_233.html[8/7/2010 9:54:22 PM]< previous pagepage_233next page >Page 233scripts, where the relationship \"units OF\" is made explicit by the adnominal particlefor example, rgyud-Npheld-kyirnams \"descendents,\" Nphags-pai rnams \"nobility,\" sgo-lhai rnams \"personal gods,'' dban-than-tsan-dan gtan-zin-gi rnams ''ones with power and with fixed fields.\" Thus, too, we find ñi-og-gi rgyal-khams-na rgyal-phran mtshis-pai rnams sems myi-bde-zin srid or-du dogs-pai rnams kyan srid-la myi-dbab-tsin sems bde \"In the kingdoms ofthe west, even those who were lesser sovereigns, those who were unhappy and feared to lose their dominion, werenot cast down from their dominion and are happy.\"The selector -TSig \"ONE/SM\" (which becomes -tsig after preceding final -g -d, -b; becomes -zig after precedingfinal -, -n, -m, -r, -1, and open syllables; and becomes -sig after preceding final or postfinal -s)is clearly related tothe numeral gtsig \"one,\" and it specifies the nominal as consisting, not simply of one entity, but of one or moreentities taken as a single unit rather than individuallythus mi-zig \"a man/sm men/someone,\" sin-zig \"a tree/somefirewood,\" mi man-po-zig \"(a group of) many men,\" mi bzi-zig \"(a group of) four men/some four men.\" Where theselector -ams implies internal differentiation or multiplicity, the selector -TSig implies internal homogeneity orsimplicity.

AdnominalsAn ADNOMINAL is a nominal phrase with the ADNOMINAL PARTICLE -KYi which immediately precedes andmodifies a nominal headthus, for example, byai sder-mo \"bird's claw,\" gser-gyi bum-pa \"golden vessel,\" dkar-poiphren-ba \"white rosary,\" rgyal-po tshen-poi mdzod ''treasury of the great king,\" bla-ma tshen-po Ndi-rnams kun-gyi bsod-nams ''the merit of all these great lamas,\" bla-ma rgan-poi sñin-rdze tshen-poi mthu \"the power of the oldlama's great compassion.\" This subordinate adnominal always limits or qualifies the head in some way: the setdesignated by the modified head is a proper subset of the set designated by the head alone; the adnominal answersthe question \"What sort of ?\" with reference to the head.The adnominal particle is -KYi The capitalization indicates that the particle undergoes regular morphophonemicchanges according to the final or postfinal of the preceding syllable. Thus -KYi becomes -gi after preceding final -gand -n; becomes -kyi after preceding final -d, -b, -s; and becomes -gyi after preceding final -n, -m, -r, -lthus bdag-gi ran-gi, bod-kyi, rab-kyi, gos-kyi, bon-gyi, lam-gyi, phur-gyi, bal-gyi. A preceding open syllable becomes adiphthong with -ithus dgai, spyii, rgyui, bdei, bloi. In poetry, when an extra syllable is needed for metricalpurposes, an open syllable may be followed by -yi instead of -ithus dga-yi instead of dgai, spyi-yi instead of spyii,and so on. All forms in KY- undergo these same morphophonological changes.3.1.1.2.1. Basic Modification PatternsThere are four basic adnominal modification patterns, where both head and modifier consist of a single nominal(1)NOUN-KYi NOUN, as in gser-gyi ri \"mountain of gold, golden mountain,\" rii gser \"mountain gold, gold from themountains,\" (2) ADJECTIVE-KYi NOUN, as in dkar-poi phren-ba \"rosary of white, white rosary,\" bzan-poirgyal-po \"king of virtue, virtuous king\" orif the adjective is read as a headless modifier\"king of the virtuous,\" (3)ADJECTIVE-KYi ADJECTIVE, as in bzan-poi tshen-po \"greatness of virtue, virtuous greatness,\" orread as aheadless modifier\"greatness of the virtuous,\" dampai bzan-po \"virtue of holiness, holy virtue,\" or-read as aheadless modifier\"virtue of the holy,\" and (4) NOUN-KYi ADJECTIVE, as in rgyal-poi tshen-po \"greatness of theking, royal greatness,\" dge-slon-gi dam-pa \"holiness of the monk, cenobitic holiness.\" < previous pagepage_234next page >"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"page_235file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_235.html[8/7/2010 9:54:23 PM]< previous pagepage_235next page >Page 235This last modification pattern is relatively rare, but it is a favorite device of the poet Pad-ma dkar-po, who oftenuses such phrases as snags-Ntshan-gi nag-po \"blackness of sorcerors,\" rgya-stag-gi khra-bo \"spottedness of thetiger,\" brag-dmar-gyi mthon-po \"heights of the red rocks,\" g.yu-mtsho-yi snon-mo \"blue of the turquoise lakes.\"As we will have occasion to note from time to time in this text, part of the interest of Pad-ma dkar-po as a poet liesin his willingness to utilize such previously unexploited Tibetan syntactic resources.3.1.1.2.2. Types of ModificationWhere the head of the modifying adnominal is a noun, the Tibetan grammarians traditionally distinguish four sortsof Nbrel-ba \"connections\" between that modifier and its headyan-lag-dan yan-lag-tsan \"part and whole,\" as insin-gi yal-ga \"tree branch,\" byai sder-mo \"bird claws\"; rten-dan brten-pa ''residence and resident,'' as in gron-paimi \"village man,\" yul-gyi lha \"local deity\"; no-bo gtsig-pa \"identical substance,\" as in gser-gyi bum-pa \"goldenvessel,\" tsan-dan-gyi ka-ba \"pillar of sandalwood\"; and bdag-po-dan yul \"owner and object,\" as in rgyal-poimdzod \"king's treasury,\" bla-maiphren-ba \"lama's rosary.\" The particular reading, of course, depends on thesemantics of the nouns involved. Note that there is in Tibetan no SYNTACTIC difference between, say, rgyal-poime-tog and rii me-tog to reflect the fact that the adnominal is animate in one phrase but not in the other. InEnglish, that fact can make a syntactic difference: we say king's flowers but not, generally, ?mountain's flowers(but both royal flowers and mountain flowers); that we would TRANSLATE those phrases, respectively, as\"flowers OF the king\" and \"flowers ON the mountain\" is simply a peculiarity of English. Note the parallel with thepropositions rgyal-po-LA me-togyod \"The king HAS flowers\" and ri-LA me-tog yod \"There are flowers ON themountain.\"4444 Note that adnominal modification is the only way of expressing such relationships as possession andlocation within a nominal phrase. The modification of a noun by another noun in a nominal-for example,bla-ma sprul-skucanbe read only as no-bo gtsig-pa \"identical substance,\" and thus only as \"lama WHO isan incarnation.\" Thus, too, we can find rii me-tog \"mountain flowers\" but notat least not in the samesense?me-tog ri The semantic relation of possession seems to be related to the fact that an adnominalbeinga nominal phrasecan be quantified independently of its head, whereas a nominal modifier cannot. In bla-masprul-sku \"lama who is an incarnation\" there are precisely as many incarnations as there are lamas; but insprul-skui bla-ma the two designated sets may in fact be identicaland thus \"lama who is an incarnation\"orthey may be quantified separately,( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_235next page >"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"page_236file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_236.html[8/7/2010 9:54:24 PM]< previous pagepage_236next page >Page 2363.1.1.2.3. RecursionThe adnominal may itself be a nominal phrase of any length and complexity, even one containing furtheradnominals. The modifying nominal phrase may consist of a single nominal, of a nominal plus determiner orquantifier, or a nominal preceded by an adnominal. This recursiveness allows for successive embeddings ofadnominals within adnominals to the limits of stylistic tolerancenormally perhaps three adnominals in a row, andperhaps five at the stylistic maximumas in dgon-pai bla-mai gser-gyi phren-ba \"the golden rosary of themonastery's lama,\" dgon-pai bla-mai gser-gyi phren-bai mthu-stobs-kyi Nbras-bu \"the results of the magic powerof the golden rosary of the monastery's lama.\"A Tibetan author clearly has considerable liberty both in the extent to which he modifies the head nominals in histext and in the syntactic patterns he may use to do so; such choices collectively constitute what we can call theMODIFIER STYLE of a particular author. A primary choice is simply how much nominal modification there willbe in the text. 45 Long modifier sequences( footnote continued from previous page)as in sprul-sku gtsig-gi bla-ma-dag \"the one incarnation's several lamas,\" or sprul-sku-rnams-kyi bla-ma\"the lama of the several incarnations.\" Only a modifying nominal phrase can be thus quantifiedindependently of its head; thus it is only the adnominal modifier that can indicate possession.45 In English literary history, we find periods when highly modified styles were felt to be \"elevated\" oras theeighteenth-century poets put it\"sublime,\" as well as contrasting periods when more sparsely modified styleswere admired as \"plain.\" Often too the individual style of a particular author can be related to predominantpatterns of modifier and head: the following passage from D. H. Lawrence's short story The Border Line ischaracteristic of his modifier style:The flat, grey, wintry landscape, ploughed fields of greyish earth that looked as if they were compoundedof the clay of dead men. Pallid, stark, thin trees stood like wire beside straight, abstract roads. A ruinedfarm between a few more trees. And a dismal village filed past, with smashed houses like rotten teethbetween the straight rows of the village street.In this passage there are eighteen adjectives to fifteen nouns; and we can contrast this style with the followingsimilarly characteristic passage from Ernest Hemingway's Big Two-hearted River, which contains onemodifier-head combination to Lawrence's thirteen:Nick slipped off his pack and lay down in the shade. He lay on his back and( footnote continued on the next page) < previous pagepage_236next page >"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"page_237file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_237.html[8/7/2010 9:54:24 PM]< previous pagepage_237next page >Page 237easily become rhythmic and incantatory, whether adjectives (as in Gerard Manley Hopkins' \"Earnest, earthless,equal, attuneable, vaulty, voluminous,( footnote continued from previous page)looked up into the pine trees. His neck and back and the small of his back rested as he stretched. Theearth felt good against his back. He looked up at the sky, through the branches, and then shut his eyes. Heopened them and looked up again.Similarly, we can cite the following stanza from Robert Lowell's \"Hawthorne,\" where the effect of slowdeliberateness is created by its phonological and syntactic repetition:Follow its lazy main street lounging from the alms house to Gallows Hill along a flat, unvaried surface covered with wooden houses aged by yellow drain like the unhealthy hair of an old dog . . .Compare this stanza with the poem \"The Hope\" by David Ignatow, whose single modifierhead combinationcarries, by its syntactic isolation as well as by its final position, a proportionately greater share of the semanticburden of the poem:In the woods as the trees fade in the dusk I am unable to speak or to gesture. I lie down to warm myself against the ground. If I live through the night I will be a species related to the tree and the cold dark.From the archaic materials available to us, it appears that early Tibetan poetry and prose favored \"plain\" ratherthan \"elevated\" styles, and was sparing in modifiers, although rich in simile. Later Tibetan poetry, on the otherhand, borrowed an increasingly ornate syle from its Sanskrit models; Indic handbooks of poeticornamentparticularly the Kavyadarsa of Dandinwere translated and studied, and their complex and extendedmetaphors were often rendered in Tibetan as highly layered modifiers. This was especially true of genresborrowed from Sanskrit Buddhist devotional literature: Tibetan encomia, hymns, and prayers base both theirvocabulary and syntax on such occasionally florid works as the Samantabhadra-caryapranidhana, theBuddhacarita of Asvaghosa, the Satapañcasatka of Matrceta, the Jatakamala of Aryasura, and theBodhicaryavatara of Santideva. The native Tibetan poetic genresthe repartee songs and riddles, smoke offeringrituals, and the great epic of Ge-sarwere less affected by the Indic \"sublime,\" and some Indic forms, such as themystic song, were in fact effectively Tibetanized and assimilated to Tibetan folksong. < previous pagepage_237next page >"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"page_238file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_238.html[8/7/2010 9:54:25 PM]< previous pagepage_238next page >Page 238stupendous evening . . .\") or adnominals (as in D.H. Lawrence's \"The pulse of the blood of the teats of the cowsbeat into the pulse of the hands of the men\"). Such literary effects are sought in Tibetan particularly in the ritualevocation of deities in contemplative texts. Thus, in the Sñan-brgyud bskyed-rim rgyas-pa of Pad-ma dkar-poaritual evocation of Cakrasamvarawe find such highly layered adjective sequences as btsom-ldan-Ndas dpal rdo-rdze sems-dpa sku-mdog dkar-po zal-gtsig phyag-gñis rdo-rdze-dan dril-bu Ndzin-pas yum-la Nkhyud-pa \"theblessed glorious white-colored one-headed Vajrasattva with two hands which hold vajra and bell embracing theMother .. .\"; and such highly layered adnominal sequences as ah-las byun-bai zla-bai sten-du hum-las skyes-pairdo-rdze \"a vajra born from a hum on top of a moon arisen from an ah ...''Another area of choice lies in the syntactic pattern of such modification. A poet in English, for example, canchoose between left-branching modifier sequences (as in Matthew Arnold's \"The unplumbed, salt, estranging sea\")and right-branching modifier sequences (as in Robert Creeley's \"I can see you, hairy, extended, vulnerable . . .\"). Apoet in Tibetan can create often complex modifier structures as a syntactic skeleton which is then clothed withlexical flesh. For example, Tson-kha-pa, in his Dgons-pa rab-gsal commentary on the Madhyamakavatara ofCandrakirti, writes as follows:zab-tsin rgya-tShei legs-bsad kun-gyi gter, Ndzig-rten kun-gyi ma-Ndris mdza-bses-te, sa-gsum Ngro-la lam-bzan mtshon-pai mig, thub-dban smra-bai ñi-mas rtag-tu skyonsTreasure of all the deep broad maxims, Unasked friend of all the world, Eye which shows the good path to beings of the three realms, Sun of the master's teachingsever protect us!This verse is built on the fourfold equation gter \"treasure\" = mdza-bses \"friend\" = mig \"eye\" = ñi-ma \"sun.'' Eachof these four heads is modified by two preceding adnominals, explicitly in the first line and implicitly in threeplaces in the following lines: the basic pattern of each of the four lines is thus MODIFIER-KSi MODIFIER-KYiHEAD; and this reiterated syntactic symmetry underlies and reinforces the semantic parallelism of the metaphorsexpressed in the verse. < previous pagepage_238next page >"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"page_239file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_239.html[8/7/2010 9:54:25 PM]< previous pagepage_239next page >Page 239A more complex pattern is found in a song by Mi-la ras-pa, when he rebukes his wicked aunt-who stole his landsfrom himfor her greed. The first few verses establish the following modifier pattern:skye-boi so-nam sdig-pai las spyad-na nan-son-gi sdug-bsnal myonThe husbandry of mankind is the doing of evil: if you do it, you taste the suffering of evil destiny.ñe-dui gdun-sems bdud-kyi mkhar brtsegs-na me-obs-kyi nan-du tshudThe love of family is a castle of demons: if you build it, you fall into a pit of flames.The basic pattern of each verse is thus(MODIFIER-KYi HEAD) = (MODIFIER-KYi HEAD) (NOMINALIZED VERB)((MODIFIER-KYi HEAD) VERB).These general moral propositions are continued for several more verses, embodied in this repeated syntactic form;and this pattern is then applied, with considerable rhetorical force, to the particular occasion:a-nei zin-rin ser-snai rdzas zos-na yi-dwags-kyi gnas-su skyeMy aunt's cost for the fields is the stuff of greed: if you eat it, you will be born among the hungry ghosts.3.1.1.2.4. Headless AdnominalsWhen the nominal phrase head of an adnominal modifier has been omitted, the remaining headless adnominal maybe a patient participant in an equative construction. For example, in the proposition Nbras Ndi bla-mai yin \"Thisrice is the lama's,\" the omitted head of the adnominal modifier bla-mai is processed as coreferential with someprior element of the discourse. If what is being discussed is rice, the proposition would be processed as meaning\"This rice is the lama's RICE.\" But if what is being discussed is, say, not rice but offerings, the proposition wouldbe read as ''This rice is the lama's < previous pagepage_239next page >"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"page_240file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_240.html[8/7/2010 9:54:26 PM]< previous pagepage_240next page >Page 240OFFERING.\" Where such ellipsis refers back to old information in the same proposition, that information too maybe omitted under the Telegram Principle, anddepending on stylistic considerations of densitywe might encountersuch laconic constructions as bla-mai yin \"What we are talking aboutthat's the lama's,\" or even the minimal bla-maio.3.1.2. Conjoined nominal phrasesA NOMINAL CONJUNCTION is a particle that joins nominal phrases together. An indefinite number of nominalphrases can be linked together by such conjunctions; this horizontal expansion can extend to the limits of stylistictolerance, which in the classical language seem to be quite broad. Thus the series \"PHRASE and PHRASE and . . .PHRASE\" may reach some length before it becomes a PARTICIPANT by the addition of a role particle.All phrases so conjoined, no matter how long or complex the conjunction, still constitute a single participantthus(bla-ma-dan rgyal-po)- Ngro \"The lama-and-king go,\" bla-mas (bgegs-dan Ndre)- btul \"The lama tameddemons-and-spirits,\" tshos (ri-dan lun-pa)-la dar \"The dharma spread to mountain-and-valley,'' rgyal-pos (mdun-nam ral-gri)-s dgra bsad \"The king will slay the enemy with lance-or-sword.''In the classical language there are two types of nominal conjunctionALTERNATIVE (\"PHRASE or PHRASE\")and COORDINATIVE (\"PHRASE and PHRASE\"). The ALTERNATIVE CONJUNCTION PARTICLE is -Am.46The hyphen indicates that the form is BOUND and occurs only with an immediately preceding nominal. Thecapitalization indicates that the vowel prefixes to itself the last consonant of the preceding syllable codathus dag-gam, mdan-nam, skyid-dam, dben-nam, Ndab-bam, gtum-rnam, dar-ram, dal-lam, and phyogs-sam.

In the scansion of verse suchdiphthongs may occasionally be counted as two syllables for the purposes of meter.The alternative conjunction offers a choice between two or more possibilities,46 We will note here only briefly that this is clearly the same as the propositional conjunction -Am and thesentence-final question particle -Am.

Verb Phrases3.2.1. NegationWe will in this grammar consider the optional NEGATION to be the specifier of the verb within a verb phrase.Negation is expressed by the negative particle ml- \"NOT.\" The capitalization indicates that the vowel undergoeschanges according, in this case, to the TENSE of the following verb: the negative particle mI- becomes mi- beforethe present and future stems of the verb, and it becomes ma- before the past and imperative stems of the verb.48The hyphen indicates that the particle is BOUND and can occur, in this case, only immediately before a verb tensestem. The particle immediately precedes the stem even when the verb is morphologically complexfor example,TSAN-RGYA \"become a Buddha\" log-ltai sgo-nas Ntshan-mi-rgya ''One does not become a Buddha throughwrong views,\" mnon-par SES \"perceive clairvoyantly\" dgra-btsom-pas zin kun mnon-par mi-ses \"An arhan doesnot clairvoyantly perceive all the Buddhafields,'' mgo-KHOR \"become confused\" khyed-kyi kha-sbyan-gis nedmgo-mi-Nkhor \"We are not taken in by your eloquence.\"Two contractions should be noted. The equative verb YIN \"be,\" when negated, may optionally be contracted to min\"is not\" in addition to ma-yin. Interestingly, the verb YIN seems to occur only with the ma- and not the mi- form ofthe negative particle. In addition, the verb YOD \"exist spatiotemporally\" occurs in negated form only as med \"notexist spatiotemporally/be absent\" and not as ?ma-yod.49In Tibetan, the negative particle mI- \"NOT\" can precede only verbs, and cannot precede nouns or adjectives; it isonly the occurrence of an event that can be denied, not the identity of a thing or the extent of a quality. Thus, forexample, the proposition rgyal-pos dgra ma-bsad \"The king did not kill the48 The ma- allomorph of the negative particle precedes the same tense stems as are marked with theinflectional suffix -sanother indication that past and imperative tenses in Tibetan are perceived as sharingsome common feature, which we have taken to be the specification of the event as either actually orpotentially COMPLETED.49 It is also interesting to note that the verb red \"be,\" like yin, seems to occur only with the ma- form of thenegative particle, and the verb Ndug \"be present\" only with the mi-form, except in the imperative. I do notknow why this is so. < previous pagepage_242next page >"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"page_243file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_243.html[8/7/2010 9:54:28 PM]< previous pagepage_243next page >Page 243enemy\" denies that the killing took place. Other structures are available to deny a particular participant: forexample, the proposition rgyal-po ni dgra bsad-pa ma-yin \"It's not the king who killed the enemy\" denies theidentification of the king as the enemy-killer. Similarly, one cannot say \"Nobody goes\"; one must say su-zig mi-Ngro \"Anyone does not go.''3.2.1.1. Term negationsSince the negative particle mI- \"NOT\" cannot precede nouns or adjectives, but only verb stems, we find the nounbram-ze \"brahman\" but not ?mi-bram-ze for \"non-brahman,\" and the adjective dmar-po \"red\" but not ?mi-dmar-pofor \"not-red.'' Similarly, we can find mi-tshe-ba \"not big\" from the verb TSHE \"be big,\" but not a parallel ?mi-tshen-po from the adjective tshen-po \"big.\"50In Sanskrit, however, the prefix a- \"NOT\" can precede virtually any nominal. Without in the least straining thelanguage, one can say both brahmanam na pasyati \"He does not see a brahman\" and abrahmanam pasyati \"Hesees a non-brahman.\" To Buddhist philosophers, writing in Sanskrit, the first proposition was an example ofprasajyapratisedha \"proposition negation\" or \"verbally bound negation\"; the second was an example of paryudasa\"term negation\" or \"nominally bound negation.\" The proposition negation denies the seeing; the term negationdenies the brahmanhood of the thing seen, and thus implies that something was in fact seensomething that was nota brahman.51 Such term negations are quite common in the Sanskrit lexicon, and the distinction betweenproposition negation and term negation became50 That it is the verb TSHE \"be big\" that is negated in mi-tshe-ba \"not big,\" rather than the nominal tshe-ba\"big,\" can be shown by noting that we find ma-rig-pa \"ignorance\" < RIG \"know\" but not a parallel ?ma-rgyus < rgyus \"knowledge,\" and we find mi-skyid-pa \"unhappy\" < SKYID \"be happy\" but not a parallel?mi-skyid-po < skyid-po \"happy.\" We must thus interpret such nominalizations as ma-rig-pa \"ignorance\"as ((ma-rig)-pa)rather than as ?(ma-(rig-pa)), and mi-skyid-pa \"unhappy\" as ((mi-skyid)-pa)rather than as?(mi-(skyid-pa)).51 As Avalokitavrata explains in his Prajñapradipatika, proposition negation gzan-gyis khas blans-pa gan yin-pa de dgag-pa tsam byed-la dnos-poi de-kho-naam dnos-po med-pai de-kho-na sgrub-par mi-byed-pa \"doesnot imply the existence or nonexistence of any entity, but simply denies what another has asserted,\" while termnegation tshig gtsig-gis dnos-po sgrub-par byed-pa . . . ran-gi tshig-gis mi-ston-pa \"implies an entity with aterm which is not its own name.\" < previous pagepage_243next page >"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"page_244file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_244.html[8/7/2010 9:54:28 PM]< previous pagepage_244next page >Page 244quite important in several areas of Buddhist thought.52Since Tibetan, unlike Sanskrit, has no nominally bound negation, three primary strategies were adopted to renderSanskrit term negations. One strategy was to ignore the negation altogether and adopt a translation without anegative particlethus Sanskrit a-mrta \"immortal, imperishable  nectar of the gods\" Tibetan bdud-rtsi \"demonjuice,\" Sanskrit a-mogha \"unerring, unfailing'' Tibetan don yod-pa \"effective, purposeful.\" Another strategy was tonominalize a negated verb stem and use it either as a nominal head (thus Sanskrit a-vidya Tibetan ma-rig-pa''ignorance\" < RIG \"know,\" Sanskrit a-himsa Tibetan mi-Ntshe-ba \"nonviolence\" < TSE \"injure,\" Sanskrit a-nityata Tibetan mi-rtag-pa \"impermanence\" < RTAG \"persist\") or as the modifier of a nominal head (thus Sanskritan-agata Tibetan ma-byun-ba \"unoriginated\" < BYUN \"arise,\" Sanskrit a-sama Tibetan mi-mñam-pa \"unequalled\"< MÑAM \"be alike,\" Sanskrit a-bhranta Tibetan ma-nor-ba \"unerring\" < NOR \"be mistaken\").53A third strategy was to find a nominal equivalent for the affirmative part of the Sanskrit term negation, deny thenominal with an appropriate verb (usually ma-YIN-MIN \"be not,\" but sometimes MED \"have not,\" or even BRAL\"lack, be bereft\"), and nominalize the resulting proposition. The resulting relative construction could then be usedeither as a headless modifier (thus Sanskrit a-dharma Tibetan tshos-min \"(a teaching) which is not the dharma/non-dharma,\" Sanskrit a-brahmana Tibetan bram-ze ma-yin-pa \"(a person) who is not a brahman/non-brahman,\"Sanskrit a-krtajñata Tibetan byas-pa gzo-ba ma-yin-pa \"(something) which is not an acknowledgement of whatwas done/ingratitude,\" Sanskrit a-madhyamapratipad Tibetan dbu-mai lam ma-yin-52 For example, it was important to decide whether certain traditional denials about the world-that things\"do not arise from themselves\" or that things \"are empty of duality\"are verbally or nominally bound.Bhavaviveka, in his Prajñapradipa, claims that such denials must be understood as proposition negations,for otherwise there would be the unacceptable implication that something like an \"unarising thing\" actuallyexists. On the other hand, Ratnakarasanti, in his Prajñaparamitopadesa, says that the absence ofdualitywhich is the highest truth-constitutes a term negation, and that there is indeed something real called\"nonduality.\"53 Sometimes fuller propositions are negated and nominalized, and enter the lexicon in their full formforexample, Sanskrit a-cintya Tibetan bsam-gyis mi-khyab-pa \"unpervaded by thought  inconceivable,\" Sanskrita-sastrajña Tibetan bstan-btsos mi-ses-pa \"ignorant of the commentaries.\" < previous pagepage_244next page >"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"page_245file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_245.html[8/7/2010 9:54:29 PM]< previous pagepage_245next page >Page 245pa \"(a teaching) which is not the Middle Path,\"), or as a modifier (thus Sanskrit a-sunya Tibetan ston-min \"non-empty,\" Sanskrit anutpanna Tibetan skyes-pa ma-yin \"non-born,'' Sanskrit a-klista Tibetan ñon-mons-tsan ma-yin-pa \"non-defiled,\" Sanskrit a-sasvata Tibetan rtag med-pa ''non-eternal\").Note particularly the following idiomatic use of such term negationsSanskrit a-sthana Tibetan gnas-min\"(something) which is not a place/WRONG place/ impossibility,\" Sanskrit a-kala Tibetan dus-med \"(something)which is not a time/WRONG time,\" Sanskrit a-vastu Tibetan don med-pa \"(something) which is not athing/WORTHLESS thing.\" Thus Sa-skya pandita writes, in his Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter, ñes-pa mnon-sum mthon-na-yan, gnas-ma-yin-la smra mi-bya \"Though you plainly see a sin, do not speak of it underinappropriate circumstances,\" gnas-min ha-tsan dran-po-yan, ran-gsan gñis-ka brlag-pa yod \"To be very honestunder the wrong circumstances destroys both oneself and others,\" gnas ma-yin-pai dul drags-na, thams-tsad-kyisni bkol-bar Ngyur \"If you are too gentle in the wrong circumstances you will be made a servant by everyone.\"3.2.1.2. An idiom with MEDThe classical literature has an idiom with MED which is worth pointing out. We have already noted nativecompounds of the form ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE  NOUN, where the adjectives are opposite ends of acontinuum, and the resulting noun is a statement of the continuum itselfthus, for example, ñe-rin \"near far distance\" or bzan-nan \"good bad  virtue.\" When such an adjective pair is the patient of the verb MED \"have not,\"however, the collocation means \"make no distinction between ADJECTIVE or ADJECTIVE/have no regard forNOUN\"for example, ñe-rin MED \"make no distinction of near or far/be without regard for distance,\" phyug-dbulMED \"make no distinction of rich or poor/have no regard for wealth,\" gtsan-btsog MED \"make no distinction ofclean and dirty/be slovenly, uncouth, rude\"; and the same reading is given a similar collocation of MED withsemantically opposed nouns-for example, ñin-mtshan MED \"make no distinction of day or night/be without regardfor the time of day,\" rgan-byis MED \"make no distinction of old person or youth/have no regard for age,\" and evenno-med lkog-med \"making no distinction of facethat is, the public selfand secrecy/without regard for whetheranyone is watching/acting in private as in public.\"Thus Mi-la ras-pa uses the term gran-dro \"hot cold\" in gran-dro med-pai ras- < previous pagepage_245next page >"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"page_246file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_246.html[8/7/2010 9:54:29 PM]< previous pagepage_246next page >Page 246kyan Ndi \"This single whatever-the-weather piece of cloth,\" and the term mgo-mdzug \"head tail\" in bandhe des naimgo-mdzug med-pa-la yun rin-ba-la bltas \"That monk looked me over from head to tail for a long time/Thatmonk looked over every bit of me without distinction for a long time.\" In the epic of Ge-sar, we find the hero Ge-sar, in the ugly and despised form of Dzo-ru, saying gzugs-la bzan-nan med-le dgos, bon-la rin-thun med-le dgos,rgyu-la phyug-dbul med-le dgos \"As to formyou should pay no heed to beauty; as to sizeyou should pay no heedto height; as to substanceyou should pay no heed to wealth.''3.2.1.3. Universal negationIn English, we often form universal negations by using what we may call negative pronouns, as in No ONE went,NOTHING was there, or negative adverbs, as in I NEVER saw him. Tibetan, on the other hand, forms universalnegations by using indefinite determiners with negative verbsthus su-zig mi-Ngro \"No one goes,\" gan yan mi-ses\"No one knows,\" tsi mi-ses \"He knows nothing,\" yon-tan tsi yan med \"It has no qualities at all,'' de nam yan ma-mthon \"I have never seen that.\" As these examples show, the indefinite determiner in such constructions is veryfrequently followed by the connective Yan \"EVEN, ALSO\"na-la tsi yan ma-byun \"Nothing happened to me,\" namyan zum-pa med \"He is never wearied.\" The great historian Bu-ston says, in his biography, gan-zig tsi-la yan mi-sems, tsi yan mi-bsam-pa de Nkhor-ba-las yons-su thar-pa Ngyur-ro \"That one who thinks of nothing, intendsnothing, will become one completely freed from the round of rebirth\"; an archaic mythological text from CentralAsia, writing of a Time of Troubles for mankind, says dgod bro-bai tshig-tsig byas-kyan sus kyan myi-bgad\"Though someone told a joke, no one laughed.\" In fact, we often find the contraction tsan for tsi yan in suchconstructionsfor example, tsan mi-Ndug \"Nothing was there,\" tsan mi-smra-bar gyur \"They became speechless,\"bdag-la tsan dbul-du med \"We have nothing to give.\"Exceptions to such general negations are indicated by marking the excepted participant with the source particle -las, in this context perhaps best read as \"except for, save,\" as in khyod-la gus-pa-las lam gzan med \"For you thereis no other path save devotion,\" ras-yug gtsig-las mi-bdog \"He possesses nothing except a single piece of cloth.\"Such constructions often translate well into English constructions with onlythus zla-ba lna-las mi-sdod \"I will stayonly five months,\" brñas Nkhyer-ba-las mi-yon \"You will only come to despise me,\" < previous pagepage_246next page >"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"page_247file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_247.html[8/7/2010 9:54:30 PM]< previous pagepage_247next page >Page 247gsa gtsig-las rdze-btsun ma-mthon \"We saw only a snow-leopard, not the Reverend Master,\" mi-phan-zin gnod-pa-las med \"It is useless, and does only harm.\" When Mi-la is building towers for his master Mar-pa, he developsa great sore on his back, but he is afraid to show it to Mar-pa, because, he says, bla-ma-la gzigs phul-run bkyon-pa-las mi-yon ''Though I show it to the lama, I will only get a beating\"; when Mi-la tries to meditate with anotherteacher, without Mar-pa's permission, that teacher tells him bla-mai bkas ma-grol-na yon-tan mi-skye-ba-las osmed \"If you have not the leave of your lama, this is worth nothing other than that the qualities do not arise.\"Another way to indicate an exception to a general negation is to negate the excepted participant with ma-YIN-MIN\"is not,\" nominalize the resulting proposition with -Pa, use it as a headless relative, and, often, specify the omittedhead with an indefinite determinerthus, for example, klu ma-yin-pa gzan mi-thub \"Another (person) who is not aserpent-god cannot do it/Only a serpent-god can do it,\" sans-rgyas ma-yin-pa sus kyan mi-ses \"Any (person) whois not a Buddha does not know it/Only a Buddha knows it,\" nas yud-gtsig min-pa mi-bsdad \"I did not wait (a time)which was not a moment/I waited only a moment.\" When Mi-la first studies black magic, yet finds his powers stillinsufficient for his contemplated revenge, he thinks mthui-rtags ma-thon-paryul-du log-run a-ma ltsebs-te Ntshi-ba min-pa mi-yon \"If I return without showing the signs of magic power, all that will happen is that my mother willcommit suicide and die.''543.2.1.4. Double negationThis last-quoted construction is an example of one sort of DOUBLE NEGATION in Tibetan. Double negatives areoften a favored rhetorical device in the classical literature. When Mi-la wishes to return to his master Mar-pa afterrunning away, Mar-pa says of this change of heart, o-tsag blos ma-thons-pa min, kho ran blos ma-thons-pa yin\"It's not that he's not renouncing us; it's that he's not renouncing himself\"; on another occasion Mar-pa encouragesMi-la by telling him kha-pho med-pai tshos med \"I do not have a teaching that is without boast.\" When suchdouble negatives occur with such terms as thabs \"way, means\" or mthu \"power, ability,\" there is an implication ofstrong54 Note, similarly, ma-gtogs-pa \"except for\" < GTOGS \"belong, be part, be included\" (compare NDOGS\"bind, fashion, attach\")thus, for example, mi gtsig-la lag-pa gñis ma-gtogs med \"A man has only twohands.\" < previous pagepage_247next page >"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"page_248file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_248.html[8/7/2010 9:54:31 PM]< previous pagepage_248next page >Page 248necessity: when Mi-la is commanded to send a hailstorm down upon some mountain bandits, he laments ser-bami-gton-bai thabs mi-Ndug \"There's no way not to send a hailstorm/I must send a hailstorm\"; Mar-pa wonders atthe lack of progress Mi-la is making, and thinks nai brgyud-pa Ndi-la ... ñams-rtogs-kyi yon-tan myur-du mi-skye-bai mthu med-pa-zig yin \"This lineage of mine is one which cannot but produce quickly the qualities of mysticinsight/ This lineage of mine is one which must produce quickly the qualities of mystic insight.\"3.2.2. AdverbsAn ADVERB is a nominal phrase with the ADVERB PARTICLE -Tu which precedes and modifies a verbheadthus, for example, gsan-bar RKU \"steal secretly,\" mi-run-bar SPYAD \"behave inappropriately,\" yun rin-duSDAD \"wait for a long time,'' khyim-du NGRO \"go homeward,\" nan-par SLEB \"arrive in the morning,'' phyir LOG\"turn back.\" This subordinate adverb always limits or qualifies the head in some way: the event designated by themodified head is a proper subset of the event designated by the head alone; the adverb answers the question \"Whatsort of?\" with reference to the head.The adverb particle is -Tu. The capitalization indicates that the particle undergoes regular morphophonemicchanges according to the final or post-final of the preceding syllable. -Tu becomes -du after preceding final -, -d,-n, -m, -r, and -l; becomes -tu after preceding final -g and -b; and becomes -su after preceding final -s-thus dban-du, tshed-du, lan-du, rim-du, phyir-du, ril-du, lhag-tu, rab-tu, dus-su.55 A preceding open syllable becomes aclosed syllable in -r-thus dgar, spyir, rgyur, bder, blor. In poetry, when an extra syllable is needed for metricalpurposes, an open syllable may be followed by -ru instead of -r-thus dga-ru instead of dgar, spyi-ru instead ofspyir, and so on.Among the various ways of answering the question \"What sort of?\" with reference to an event, we canconveniently distinguish its TIME, its PLACE, its MANNER, and its EXTENT. Adverbs of time are regularlyformed from temporal nounsthus, for example, nan-pa \"morning\" nan-par \"in the morning,\" dgons \"evening\"dgons-su \"in the evening,\" tshes-gñis \"the second day of the month\" tshes-gñis-su \"on the second day of themonth.\" Adverbs of place are regularly55 But note the stereotyped forms kun-tu \"completely\" < *kund-tu and pha-rol-tu \"beyond\" < *pha-rold-tu. < previous pagepage_248next page >"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"page_249file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_249.html[8/7/2010 9:54:31 PM]< previous pagepage_249next page >Page 249formed from location nounsthus, for example, rgya-gar \"India\" rgya-gar-du \"to/in India,\" gro-bo lun ''Red Valley\"gro-bo lun-du \"to/in Red Valley''; or, indeed, from any nominal which is the site of a verb of location or the targetof a verb of motionthus, for example, bla-ma dgon-pa tshen-por slebs \"The lama arrived at the great monastery,\"mer me-lha bzugs \"It is in fire that the Fire God dwells.\"Relator nouns are often found as the head nominal of such adverbs.

Syntactic StructureIn classical Tibetan, a PROPOSITION consists of an EVENT preceded by the various PARTICIPANTS who takepart in that event. The event is what happened; the participants are those to whom the event happened, who made ithappen, where it happened, when it happened, with what or with whom it happened, and so on. The part which theparticipant plays in the event can be called its participant ROLE.The event is expressed by a VERB PHRASE, which carries on the verb what Tibetologists have traditionally calledTENSE. For example, the transitive verb TUB \"chop\" has four tense stemsthe present stem Nthub \"chops,\" the paststem btubs \"chopped,'' the future stem btub \"will chop,'' and the imperative stem thubs \"chop!\" while theintransitive verb KHRO \"be angry\" has two Nkhro \"is angry\" and khros \"was angry.\"Each of the participants is expressed by a NOMINAL PHRASE; the participant role which it plays is indicated by afollowing ROLE PARTICLE. For example, in the proposition nags-la rgyal-po-s sin- btubs \"The king choppedwood in the forest,\" the participant nags \"forest\" is signaled as the LOCUS of the event by the role particle -la, theparticipant rgyal-po \"king\" is signaled as the AGENCY of the event by the role particle -s, and the participant sin\"wood\" is signaled as the PATIENT of the event by the role particle -. There are five primary participant roles inthe classical languagePATIENT, AGENCY, LOCUS, SOURCE, and ACCOMPANIMENT.1.1. EventsWe can syntactically distinguish three types of event in Tibetan according to the participant roles which mustaccompany them in a proposition, whether these participants are expressed explicitly or are understood from thecontext. Every event requires a PATIENT: that is, every event must HAPPEN TO some- < previous pagepage_252next page >"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"page_253file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_253.html[8/7/2010 9:54:34 PM]< previous pagepage_253next page >Page 253body or something.1 An INTRANSITIVE VERB expresses an event that is not specified as taking place throughany agency external to this patient: such an eventbla-ma- skyel \"The lama is weary,\" bla-ma- Ngyel \"The lamafalls down,\" bla-ma- Nbros \"The lama flees\"must be accompanied by its PATIENT participant but requires noAGENCY participant.A TRANSITIVE VERB, on the other hand, indicates that the event occurs through some agency other than itspatient: such an eventbla-ma-s bgegs- btul \"The lama tamed the demon,\" dug-gis rgyal-po- bsad \"Poison killedthe king\"must be accompanied not only by its PATIENT participant but also by the AGENCY participant wherebythe event occurs.For example, in tshu- Nkhol \"The water boils\" the event expressed by the intransitive verb KHOL \"be boiling\" cansimply HAPPEN TO the patient without any external agency; but in bla-ma-s tshu- skol \"The lama boiled thewater\" the event expressed by the transitive verb SKOL \"make boiling'' not only HAPPENS TO the patient but alsomust be CARRIED OUT or IMPLEMENTED by some agency or instrumentality.Finally, the EQUATIVE VERB YINand later REDrequires TWO patient participants: it expresses the equation oridentification of two terms, both of which undergo that identification, as in bla-ma- snags-pa- yin \"The lama is amagician.\"21 In Tibetan there are therefore no dummy subjects like the it in It is raining or It is foggy. Instead we findsuch expressions as tshar Nbab \"Rain is falling\" and na-bun Nthibs \"Fog has gathered.\"2 The verb YIN \"be\" is the only equative verb in Old Tibetan. This verb should not be confused with theintransitive verb YOD \"be\" which asserts the spatiotemporal existence of a single patient participant rather thanthe equation of two patient participantsthus bla-ma- snags-pa- yin \"The lama is (identified as) a magician\"but bla-ma- ri-la yod \"The lama is (spatiotemporally) on the hill.\" Compare, for example, New Chinese shih\"be (equated)'' and yu \"be (spatiotemporally)\"; the problem, of course, is that English has collapsedor expresseshomophonouslytwo different concepts.In some later texts, beginning probably in the fourteenth century, such as the epic of Ge-sar, the Pad-ma than-yig, and the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, we find the Middle Tibetan equative verb REDthus, for example, in theepic, gla-ba mi-bden sgyu-ma red \"The deer is not real, it is an illusion,\" and, in the biography of Mi-la, khyedphyugs-rdzi ma-red rdo-rdze sems-dpar snan \"You are not a herdsman, but appear as Vajrasattva.\" Thefrequency of RED varies in( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_253next page >"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"page_254file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_254.html[8/7/2010 9:54:35 PM]< previous pagepage_254next page >Page 254INTRANSITIVE, TRANSITVE, and EQUATIVE verbs are thus defined not only SEMANTICALLY by the sort ofevent they expressfor example, \"be boiling\" as opposed to \"make boiling\"but also SYNTACTICALLY by theparticipants which must accompany them.3 This threefold categorization is exhaustive: every Tibetan verb belongsto one and only one of these three categories, whatever other participants the particular verb may require.4( footnote continued from previous page)the texts: the verb is quite common in the epic, relatively rare in the Mi-la, and continues to be absent inlearned treatises; indeed, the occurrence of RED in a classical text can be used as an index of colloquialregister.The verb RED is unevenly distributed in New Tibetan. It is not found in Ladakh, where yin continues to be theonly equative verb. In Lhasa City, re < Middle Tibetan RED has become the primary equative verb, with yiN<Old Tibetan YIN almost entirely restricted to certain constructions implying reportage of personalexperiencethus ti thep re \"This is a book\" but not ?ti thep yiN, but both khö thep re \"He read the book\" and thep yiN \"I read the book.\"3 As we have discussed, transitive and intransitive verbs differ INFLECTIONALLY in Tibetan as well:transitive verbs have four stems, with the past stem marked with a b-prefix; intransitive verbs have two tensestems, with the past stem marked with a - prefix. Compare, for example, SGRAG \"proclaim,\" with the fourstems sgrog/bsgrags/bsgrag/sgrogs, and GRAG \"resound\" with the two stems Ngrag/grags. Also, some pairs oftransitive and intransitive verbs with homophonous roots differ inflectionally in the present stem, with thetransitive verb showing an additional affix -D. Compare rgyu < N-RGYU \"moves\" and rgyud < N-RGYU-D''transmits,\" Ngas < N-GAS \"becomes split'' and Nges < N-GAS-D \"makes split.\" Additionally, as we haveseen, there are also pairs of transitive and intransitive verbs, clearly related phonologically and semantically,that differ DERIVATIONALLY, either by a transitivizing prefix s- (for example, LAN \"rise\" SLAN \"raise,\"GRAG \"resound\" SGRAG \"proclaim\") or by initial voicing (for example, THON \"emerge\" DON \"eject,\" DOR\"be scattered\" TOR \"scatter\").4 Some verbs can be described as requiring-in some sense-additional participants. For example, the intransitiveverb MNA \"belong\" requires not only its patient participant but a LOCUS of possession as wellthus rgyal-po-la sras- mna \"The king has a son,\" but not-at least not out of a context providing the missing locusjust ?sras-mna. Similarly, the transitive verb DZUG \"put\" requires a locus participant; we might find rgyal-po-s rdo-tshu-la btsug \"The king put the stone in the water,\" but notagain, at least not without a context in which thelocus is understoodjust ?rgyal-po-s rdo- btsug. Other verbs require an ACCOMPANIMENT-for example, theintransitive verb NDRA \"be similar,\" as in bla-ma- sans-rgyas-dan Ndra \"The lama is like a Buddha,\" but not?bla-ma- Ndra, or the transitive verb PHRAL \"make separate, sever,\" as in rgyal-po-s dgra- srog-dan phral\"The king deprived the enemy of his life,\" but not ?rgyal-po-s dgra- phral.

EquationsAs we have noted, the equative verb YINand later REDexpresses the equation or identification of two patientparticipants. Indeed, the presence of two patient participantsfor example, bla-ma-\"lama\" and mkhan-po-\"abbot\"in bla-ma- mkhan-po- yin \"The lama is an abbot''uniquely identifies the verb as equative.5 Even more, the verbYIN is unique in that it( footnote continued from previous page)additional INSTRUMENT participant. The verb SKRAG \"be afraid\" gives every evidence of beingintransitive, yet we find rgyal-po- sbrul-gyis skrag \"The king is frightened of the snake,\" but not-outsidean appropriate contextjust ?rgyal-po- skrag. Similarly, we find the transitive verb GAN \"fill, make full\" insuch constructions as rgyal-po-s bum-pa- tshu-s Ngens ''The king fills the pot with water,\" but not ?rgyal-po-s bum-pa- Ngens. Such required participants frequently fill the CORE participant slot in theproposition, immediately preceding the verb.It is clear that propositions like ?bla-ma Ndra \"?The lama is similar,\" and ?rgyal-po-s rdo- btsug \"?The kingput the rock,\" are puzzling; it is not clear to me whether our puzzlement is syntactic, or semantic, or pragmatic.We alleviate our puzzlement by searching the context for the missing participant; we are perhaps less puzzledby, say, ?rgyal-po-s bum-pa- Ngens \"?The king fills the pot\" because the missing participant is more easilyinferred from the context or, indeed, from our general knowledge of the world, and of the sorts of thingspeople usually fill pots with.In addition, we can note here briefly that certain verbs appear to require that participants in certain roles havecertain SEMANTIC properties. It is a commplace to observe, for example, that the patient of a verb such asSAD \"kill\" must be animate, or at least will be read as animate in the context of the verb. Perhaps moreinterestingly, we can observe that the verb RNE \"get, find, obtain\" can occur with any sort of patient, while thepatient of the otherwise apparently synonymous verb THOB \"get, find, obtain\" must be abstractthus both tshosrñed and tshos thob \"He gains the dharma\" but gri rñed \"He finds a knife\" and not ?gri thob. Thus too anexpression such as sans-rgyas thob will ordinarily be read as \"He gains Buddhahood\" and not as \"He finds theBuddha,\" and rgyal-po thob as \"He becomes the king\" and not as \"He finds the king.\"5 The two patient participants which thus undergo identification can, of course, consist of nominal phrases ofany length and complexity. In a text, the leftmost of these two patient participants may be the THEME: it couldconstitute old information recoverable from the text. Under the Telegram Principle, such old information canbe omitted. For example, in such propositions as bla-ma yin \"(The person we are discussing) is a lama\" or bla-ma rgan-poi gser-gyiphren-ba yin \"(That object we are talking about) is the old lama's golden rosary,\" thereader processes the single patient participant as the RHEME, and assumes that the missing patient participantis some prior element in the text.( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_255next page >"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"page_256file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_256.html[8/7/2010 9:54:37 PM]< previous pagepage_256next page >Page 256is often omitted from the proposition entirely: since an equative verb is uniquely defined by the presence of twopatient participants, the verb itself becomes redundant in any proposition containing two patients. Under theTelegram Principle, such a redundant constituent can simply be left out.The equative verb is often omitted in verbal complements, metrical verse, proverbs, and parallel poetry. Proverbswith the verb YIN omitted at the end of the proposition include such examples as phag-pas bltas-na phag-tshangzal-yas-khan \"If a pig looks at it, a pigsty (is) a divine mansion,\" and pha-spun dgra-ru son-yan rus-pa gser\"Though brothers turn enemies, yet family (is) gold.\" Such proverbs frequently make use of a proportional formA:B::C:D, with the verb YIN omitted in two parallel equative constructions. Thus we find pha tsan-dan-gyi sdon-po, bu tshu-sin-gi om-bu \"The fathera sandalwood tree; the son-a hollow reed,\" zas-nan lus-kyi dgra, mi-nan yul-gyi dgra ''Bad foodenemy of the body; bad menenemy of the land.\" The scholar Sa-skya pandita would sometimesuse such equative proverb forms in his didactic verse; we find, for example, smra-man es-pa Ndzin-pai rgyu, mi-smra ñes-pa spon-bai gzi ''Much talk-why you get into trouble; no talkhow you stay out of trouble.\"The equative verb can also be omitted before the propositional conjunctions -STe \"AND,\" -Am \"OR,\" and -Yan\"BUT,\" leaving a proposition with two patient( footnote continued from previous page)The fact that the thematic patient participant can be omitted means that some equative constructions areambiguous. For example, the proposition bla-ma mkhan-poyin can be read either as (bla-ma-)(mkhan-po-) yin \"The lama is an abbot\" or as ((bla-ma mkhan-po)-) yin \"(The person under discussion) is a lama-who-is-an-abbot.\" Similarly, the proposition bla-ma rgan-poyin can be read either as (bla-ma-)(rgan-po-) yin \"The lama is old/an old one\" or as ((bla-ma rgan-po)-) yin \"(The one we're talking about) is an oldlama.\" In each case, the former reading assumes that both patient participants are present, and the latterreading assumes that a leftward patient has been telegraphically omitted.The reason for the ambiguity, of course, is the fact that the patient role particle -is invisible, and thus cannotunambiguously mark the end of a nominal phrase. Now such ambiguity is not often a serious obstacle in theprocessing of a text. But, where an author does feel a need to disambiguate such a proposition, a specifieroftenthe determiner de \"THAT\"can be used, not for its semantic content, but just to mark the end of a leftwardpatient participant. Thus bla-ma de rgan-po yin can be read only as (bla-ma de-)(rgan-po-) yin \"The lama isold/an old one,\" since the determiner unambiguously signals the close of the first nominal phrase in theequation. < previous pagepage_256next page >"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"page_257file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_257.html[8/7/2010 9:54:38 PM]< previous pagepage_257next page >Page 257participants, a conjunction, and no verb.6 The following three didactic verses, from the Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter by Sa-skya pandita, will illustrate the telegraphic omission of YIN before each of these threeconjunctions:mkhas-pa gzan-la bsad-paAM yan-na zi-bai nags-su sgrub nor-bu spyi-gtsug rgyan-byed-paAM yan-na rgya-mtshoi glin-na gnasA wise man either (is) a teacher of others or else meditates in a peaceful forest; a gem either (is) one that adorns a crown or else stays on its island in the sea.gnod-pa byed-pa tshun-nu-YAN myur-du bsal-ba Ndun-par bya yur-ba tshun-nui rdzes zugs-nas od-pa tshen-po ma-mthon-namThough the harm one has done (is) small one should wish to remedy it quickly; have you not seen a great flood flowing through a small channel?ha-tsan byams-pa gñen-laan min sin-tu gnod-tshen dgra-laan min gñen-la re-ba Nkhon-gzi-STE gnod-lan kun-gyis sgrub-par slaToo much friendliness is not even for kinsmen; very great harm is not even for enemies; relying on kinsmen (is) the cause of feuds and anyone can easily pay back harm.6 But the equative verb cannot be omitted before the propositional conjunction -TSin \"AND.\" I do notknow why this should be so; but this nondeletability of YIN before -TSin is the primary syntactic distinctionbetween the conjunctions -TSin \"AND\" and -STe ''AND\"a distinction that affects the way the twoconjunctions are used in making identifications.

Transitive and intransitive verbsIn a proposition with a transitive verb, either the agency or the patient can be the theme, and so, under theTelegram Principle, either can be omitted thus rgyal-po-s dgra- bsad \"The king slew the enemy,\" rgyal-po-s bsad\"The king slew (someone),\" dgra- bsad \"(Someone) slew the enemy.\"8 Since much narrative concerns the activityof some particular actor through whom the events in the story take place, the agency is often the theme of theproposition; hence we not infrequently find a proposition with a transitive verb and a patient participant, lookingvery much like a proposition with an intransitive verb and a patient participantfor example, nor spel ''(Someone)increases the wealth\" nor Nphel ''The wealth increases,\" tshu skol \"(Someone) boils the water\" tshu Nkhol \"Thewater is boiling,\" sgo Nbyed \"(Someone) opens the door\" sgo Nbye \"The door opens.\"Many such pairs of verbs exhibit an interesting logical relationship: the transitive verb ENTAILS the intransitiveverb, but the intransitive verb does not entail the transitive verb. Thus nor spel \"(Someone) increases the wealth\" istrue only if nor Nphel \"The wealth increases\" is true, and tshu skol \"(Someone) is boiling the water\" similarlyentails tshu Nkhol \"The water is boiling.\"7 Sometimes the statement particle -o will mark the close of a proposition from which the equative verb hasbeen omittedfor example, gzugs ston-pao \"Form (is) empty,\" bla-ma de rgan-poo \"The lama (is) old,\" mi-la bla-mao \"Mi-la (is) a lama.\" And if Mi-la has already been the subject of prior discussion, he may betelegraphically omitted as well, leaving the minimal equative construction bla-mao \"(The person we aretalking about) (is) a lama.\"8 English has a device for expressing a transitive action while suppressing the specification of its agencyapassive construction without a by phrase. It thus makes some sense to translate, say, dgra- bsad as \"Theenemy was slain,\" as opposed to \"(Someone) slew the enemy\"; but convenience of translation does not makethe verb anything other than transitive in Tibetan. Of course, in the context of a discourse, the most likelytranslation of, say, dgra- bsad would be \"HE slew the enemy,\" since the English pronoun has the sameanaphoric function as the absence of a participant does in Tibetan. < previous pagepage_258next page >"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"page_259file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_259.html[8/7/2010 9:54:39 PM]< previous pagepage_259next page >Page 259Again, sgo Nbyed \"(Someone) opens the door\" entails sgo Nbye \"The door opens,\" and bya spur \"(Someone) scaresaway the birds\" entails bya Nphur \"The birds fly away.''

The totality of propositions is language.... Language disguises thought.L. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-PhilosophicusSuch pairs of verbs as SPEL \"make increased\" PHEL \"become increased,\" SKOL \"make boiling\" KHOL \"becomeboiling,\" PYE \"make open\" BYE \"become open,\" SPUR \"make fly away\" PHUR \"fly away\" are thus quite closelyrelated by logical entailment, by semantic content, and by phonetic shape. But we must bear in mind thatpropositions containing different members of such pairs assert quite different sorts of events. The transitive verb ineffect claims that the event is the result of some outside agency acting upon the patient; the intransitive verb makesno such claim.1.1.3. ErgativityIntransitive verbs occur with a patient; transitive verbs occur with both a patient and an agency. Manylanguagesincluding Latin and Sanskrit and Chinesesyntactically identify the intransitive patient and the transitiveagency. In English and Chinese, they are both put BEFORE THE VERB (as in English THE TEACHER grievesand THE TEACHER sees the pupil), and the transitive patient is put AFTER THE VERB (as in The pupil sees THETEACHER).

In some descriptions of these languages the patient is said to be in the ABSOLUTIVECASE and the agency in the ERGATIVE CASE (from Greek érgates ''worker\").In an ACCUSATIVE LANGUAGE such as Sanskrit or English, the patient of a transitive verb is singled out asspecial and given a distinctive accusative form or position, while the other participants share a nominativeorunmarked form or position. In an ERGATIVE LANGUAGE such as Basque or Tibetan, the agency of a transitiveverb is singled out as special and given a distinctive ergative form or position, while the patient participants sharean absolutiveor unmarkedform or position.We can observe that an ergative system such as Tibetan is patterned very much like the PASSIVE of an accusativesystem such as English. In the English passive, for example, the agency of a transitive verb is given the distinctivemarker by (compare English The pupil is seen BY THE TEACHER with Tibetan SLOB-DPON-GYIS slob-ma-mthon), while the patient participants share the unmarked position before the verb (compare English THETEACHER grieves and THE TEACHER is seen by the pupil with Tibetan SLOB-DPON- Ngyod and slob-ma-sSLOB-DPON- mthon). This is the reason for the assertion, common in older textbooks, that \"all Tibetanconstructions are impersonal\" or that \"all Tibetan verbs are passive.\" In fact, Tibetan apparently lacks any syntacticstructure corresponding to the passive of an accusative system;9 Tibetan transitive constructions can, of course, beTRANSLATED by an English passive (for example, rgyal-po-s dgra- bsad \"The king slew the enemy\" or \"Theenemy was slain by the king\"), but this, again, is a peculiarity of English and not of Tibetan.9 In a number of ergative languages, we find constructions that have come to be called ANTIPASSIVES,with the transitive agency in the unmarked absolutive case, the transitive patient in an oblique or DATIVEcase, and the verb in a distinctive \"antipassive\" form. I have not found a convincing example of such anantipassive construction in Tibetan. < previous pagepage_260next page >"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"page_261file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_261.html[8/7/2010 9:54:40 PM]< previous pagepage_261next page >Page 2611.1.4. \"Tense\"1.1.4.1. The tense systemEvery Tibetan verb occurs in one of four tenses. The tense of the verb is signaled by various more or less regularchanges in its phonetic shapefor example, Nthub \"chops,\" btubs \"chopped,\" btub ''will chop,\" thubs \"chop!\" A verbmay have a maximum of four such distinct shapesfor example, from the root TU \"gather'' we findNthu/btus/btu/thus, and from the root TSHAD \"cut\" we find gtsod/btsad/gtsad/tshod. These four forms of the verbhave been denominated, by the native grammarians, da-lta-ba \"present,\" Ndas-pa \"past,\" ma-ons-pa \"future,\" andskul-tshig \"imperative.\" It is evident that a simple linear concept of tensestretching from the past into thefuturedoes not adequately account for the meanings of these four verb forms.Note too that the present and past form a distinct entity as the two tenses shown by intransitive verbs, and thefuture and imperative as the two tenses peculiar to transitive verbs. Similarly, the present and future form a distinctentity as taking the mi- form of the negative particle, and the past and imperative as taking the ma- form; the pastand imperative, too, are both distinctively marked with the s- suffix, while the present and future are not.It thus seems plausible that these four tenses are in fact the product of two intersecting semantic specificationsanASPECT specification of completeness and a MOOD specification of potentiality. An event specified asCOMPLETE is finished, terminated, accomplished at the time of speaking; the event has a terminal boundary. Anevent specified as POTENTIAL is one that is not factual but is in some way expected to be factual. In Tibetan,then, the present expresses an event not specified as being either complete or anticipated, as in rgyal-pos nor sgrub\"The king gets/is getting wealth\"; the past expresses an event specified as completed but not as anticipated, as inrgyal-pos nor bsgrubs \"The king got/has gotten wealth\"; the future expresses an event specified as anticipated butnot as yet completed, as in rgyal-pos nor bsgrub \"The king will get wealth\"; and the imperative expresses an eventspecified as expected to be completed, as in rgyal-pos nor sgrubs \"Let/may the king get wealth!\"1010 Similar interactions of mood and aspect are found in other languages. For example, in Tagalog, as inTibetan, the verb form indicating potentiality but not completion is used for ordinary future events, and theverb form indicating both potentiality and completion is used for imperatives. < previous pagepage_261next page >"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"page_262file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_262.html[8/7/2010 9:54:40 PM]< previous pagepage_262next page >Page 262The tenses we have characterized as indicating completionthe transitive and intransitive past stem and the transitiveimperative stemare all signaled by the -s suffix; the -s suffix thus appears to be the inflectional marker for aspect.We may note, too, an interesting relationship between transitivity and potentiality: the fact that only transitiveverbs can normally be specified as potential suggests that the predictability of an event in Tibetan is connected withits occurring through some outside agencyparadigmatically an animate actorrather than simply happening to thepatient that undergoes it.1.1.4.2. Periphrastic formsIn the earliest texts, such as the archaic manuscripts discovered in Central Asia, verbal tense was expressedprimarily through such inflectional modifications of the verb stem alone. In one such mythological text, forexample, the horse Khug-ron rman-dar swears revenge against Wild Yellow Yak, who had killed his older brother,using the future tense of the verbs TSAD \"cut\" and LAN \"repay,\" saying, sdan-gi sñin gtshado, Nbron-g.yag skar-bai sñin gtshado, byams-kyi lan glan-no, phu yid-kyi gdan-pyam-gi lan glan-no \"I will cut out the wrathful heart, Iwill cut out the heart of Wild Yellow Yak; I will repay the kindness, I will repay older brother Yid-kyi gdan-pyam.'' And, after the yak is slain, he exults, in the past tense, stan-gi sñin btshad, byams-gi ni lan blan \"I have cutout the wrathful heart; his kindness, yes, have I repaid.''Periphrastic constructions, in which the job of expressing tense is spread out over more than one verb stem in thesame proposition, come from three sources. First, we find, even in the archaic Central Tibetan manuscripts,CONJUNCTIONS with the coordinating conjunction -Tsin > -kyin > -kyi > -gi and, to a lesser extent, -STe\"AND,\" as in sñi-la rma byeu-zig thogs-SIN NDUG \"A little peacock was there tangled in the snare.\" Second, wefind NOMINALIZATIONS with -Pa, as in khyed-ran ni na-la dad-nas ons-PA YIN \"You have come to me infaith.\" Third, we find COMPLEMENT CONSTRUCTIONS, again even in the earliest archaic textsfor example,rgya mgo nag-po de-la phyag-Ntshal-zin des bkol-BAR ON-no \"It came about that the Chinese masses paidhomage to him, and were by him enslaved\"; in the translation of Sanskrit texts, such complement constructionsbegan to be used more frequently, in part, one supposes, to express the Sanskrit passivefor example, Sanskritajanati Tibetan ses-PAR BYED \"He knows,\" Sanskrit sadhyate Tibetan bsgrub-PAR BYA \"It is proven\"but also insuch constructions as me sreg-PAR BYED \"Fire < previous pagepage_262next page >"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"page_263file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_263.html[8/7/2010 9:54:41 PM]< previous pagepage_263next page >Page 263burns\" and me sreg-PAR NGYUR \"Fire will burn.\" By the time of New Tibetan, we find-for example, in the dialectof Lhasa Citythat several of these various periphrastic forms, from different syntactic sources, have formed acoherent inflectional paradigm. I am not at all sure that such a development can be discerned in the classical texts;and these periphrastic constructions will be dealt with separately in the appropriate sections of this text.1.2. ParticipantsA proposition in Tibetan consists of an event and its participants; the event is the last constituent of theproposition, with its participants preceding it in various positions. A participant in turn is a nominal phrase markedwith a following bound role particle: the role particle signals the particular role or function of the participant in thestated event. For example, in the proposition nags-la rgyal-pos dgra- bsad \"The king slew the enemy in theforest,\" the participant nags \"forest\" is signaled as the LOCUS of the event by the role particle -la, the participantrgyal-po \"king\" is signaled as the AGENCY of the event by the role particle -s, and the participant dgra \"enemy'' issignaled as the PATIENT of the event by the role particle -. Similarly, in the proposition rgyal-po bla-ma-dandgon-pa-nas byon \"The king arrived from the monastery with the lama,\" the participant rgyal-po ''king\" is signaledas the PATIENT of the event by the role particle -, the participant dgon-pa \"monastery\" is signaled as theSOURCE of the event by the role particle -nas, and the participant bla-ma is signaled as the ACCOMPANIMENTof the event by the role particle -dan.There are five basic roles in the classical languagePATIENT, AGENCY, LOCUS, SOURCE, andACCOMPANIMENT. These rolesand the different meanings that they carrywill be discussed in the followingsections.1.2.1. The patient roleThe PATIENT of an event is the participant that suffers, endures, or undergoes the particular state, process, oraction; the patient is the one the event HAPPENS TO. With verbs of motion the patient is that which undergoes themotion; with verbs of location it is that whose location is asserted; with verbs of emotion it is the experiencer of theemotion. Whatever other participants an event may have, it must always have a patient: in classical Tibetan every < previous pagepage_263next page >"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"page_264file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_264.html[8/7/2010 9:54:41 PM]< previous pagepage_264next page >Page 264proposition must have one patient participant either stated or understood; every event has to HAPPEN TOsomebody or something.11 And, with one exception, any proposition can have only one patient participant; theexception is a proposition containing an equative verb, which uniquely occurs with two patient participants.The role particle that signals the patient of the event is ZERO, which we write herein, when occasion demands, as -. This means that the patient role is signaled by the ABSENCE of any overt role particle: the proposition bla-mañal \"The lama sleeps\" is conveniently conceptualized as bla-ma- ñal. This invisible particle is just as functional asany other: the presence of -signals the patient of the event just as surely as, say, the presence of -la signals itsspatial or temporal locus. The zero particle sometimes causes problems in reading only because it is so hard to see.1.2.2. The agency roleThe patient of an event, we have said, is the participant that suffers, endures, or undergoes the particular state,process, or action: in bla-ma- gyel \"The lama fell down\" the participant bla-ma \"lama\" is the patient of theprocess of falling; in bgegs-kyis bla-ma- sgyel ''The demon tripped the lama\" the participant bla-ma \"lama\" is thepatient of the action of tripping. The AGENCY of an event is the means or instrumentality whereby the eventoccurs: in dgra-s rgyal-po- bsad \"The enemy killed the king'' or ser-ba-s rgyal-po- bsad \"A hailstorm killed theking\" the participants dgra \"enemy\" and ser-ba \"hailstorm,\" respectively, are the agencies of the action of killing.The role particle that signals the agency of an event is -KYis, whose initial undergoes morphophonemic changesaccording to the final or post-final of the preceding syllable: -KYis becomes -gis after preceding final -g and -n;becomes11 When the patient participant is not beir acted upon by some agency or instrumentality external to it, itcan conveniently be translated as the English subjectthus rgyal-po- ñal \"The king sleeps.\" When it is beingacted upon by some external agency or instrumentality, it can be translated into English either as the objectin an active construction or the subject in a passive onethus dgra-s rgyal-po- bsad \"The enemy slew theking\" or \"The king was slain by the enemy.\" Interestingly, it seems that classical Tibetan can be thoroughlydescribed without resorting to the notion of grammatical subject or object at all; it is, in that sense, whatsome linguists have termed a ROLE-DOMINATED language. < previous pagepage_264next page >"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"page_265file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_265.html[8/7/2010 9:54:42 PM]< previous pagepage_265next page >Page 265-kyis after preceding final -d, -b, and -s; and becomes -gyis after preceding final -n, -m, -r, and -lthus, forexample, bdag-gis, ran-gis, bod-kyis, rab-kyis, gos-kyis, bon-gyis, lam-gyis, phur-gyis, bal-gyis. A preceding opensyllable becomes a closed syllable in -sthus, for example, dgas, spyis, rgyus, bdes, blos-although in archaicmanuscripts and ancient monumental inscriptions we encounter such forms as dgais and bdeis. In verse, when anextra syllable is needed for metrical purposes, we find -yis following an open syllablefor example, dga-yis insteadof dgas.The agency whereby an event takes place is quite often animate, although the initiator of an event can also be anatural force, an institution, or a magic spell: where we read an agency as being in some sense RESPONSIBLE forthe event we can speak of an AGENT. On the other hand, the agency may be some inanimate object wielded by anagent, or in some other way not subject to its own inclination: where we read an agency as being is some senseNOT RESPONSIBLE for the event we can speak of an INSTRUMENT.Thus, in a proposition such as rgyal-pos tho-bas rdo btsag \"The king broke the rock with a hammer,\" there is littlequestion that rgyal-po \"king\" is the agent and tho-ba \"hammer\" is the instrument, despite the fact that they aremarked with exactly the same role particleexcept, perhaps, in the unlikely context of a story about, say, ananimated hammer and a frozen king. Knowledge of how the world usually works is often quite enough todistinguish agents from instruments, even in unexpected combinationsfor example, bla-mas sbrul-gyis bgegsbrduns \"The lama hit the demon with a snake,'' or bla-mas snags-kyis rdo btsag ''The lama broke the rock with amagic spell.\"Of course, where the proposition contains only one agency participant, one can argue whether that participant is\"really\" an agent, or \"really\" an instrument with the agent telegraphically omitted: is the proposition dug-gis rgyal-po bsad to be processed as \"Poison killed the king\" or as \"(Someone) killed the king with poison\"? Suchprocessing can be quite culture-bound. To an American, the proposition ser-bas rgyal-po bsad can only beprocessed as \"A hailstorm killed the king\"; a Tibetan would not rule out the reading \"(Someone) killed the kingwith a hailstorm.\"A transitive verb asserts that the event it expresses is the result of an outside agency acting upon the patient, andthus requires an agency participant either stated or understood. But agency participants can occur with intransitiveverbs as well; compare, for example, the propositions bla-ma-s bya- spur \"The < previous pagepage_265next page >"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"page_266file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_266.html[8/7/2010 9:54:42 PM]< previous pagepage_266next page >Page 266lama chased/frightened away the birds\" and bla-ma-s bya- phur \"The birds flew away/got frightenedby/through/because of the lama.\" In the first proposition, the transitive verb SPUR \"frighten/make fly'' asserts thatan outside agency is responsible for what happened to the birds; in the second, the intransitive verb PHUR''become frightened/fly away\" makes no assertion that the stated agency controlled or instigated the event. With anintransitive verb, the agency participant is still the means or instrumentality whereby the event occurred, but it isdemoted in its responsibility.In fact, we could set up a sequence of propositions as a RESPONSIBILITY HIERARCHY with regard, say, to thefrightening of a flock of birds, using the transitive verb SPUR \"make fly/frighten away\" and the intransitive verbPHUR \"fly away/be frightened,\" and ranked from the clearest assignment of responsibility to the vaguest, like this:MOST ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITYbla-ma-ssgra tshen-po-s bya-spur\"The lama frightened away the birds with a loud noise.\"bla-ma-sbya- phur\"The birds got frightened away by the lama.\"sgra tshen-po-sbya- spur\"The loud noise frightened away the birds\" OR \"(Some-one)frightened away the birds with a loud noise.\"sgra tshen-po-sbya- phur\"The birds got frightened away by a loud noise.\"bya- spur\"(Someone/something) frightened away the birds.\"bya- phur\"The birds got frightened away.\"LEAST ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY < previous pagepage_266next page >"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"page_267file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_267.html[8/7/2010 9:54:43 PM]< previous pagepage_267next page >Page 267An instrument can be just about anything whereby or through which the eventincluding one expressed by anintransitive verbtakes place.12 Mi-la, for example, mkhar-las-kyis mi-sdug \"is/grows weary with tower work\"; wefind such propositions as bla-ma yon-tan du-ma-s Nphags \"The lama is noble with many virtues,\" ri-bo nags-kyismdzes ''The mountain is beautiful with forests,\" bdag khyim-gyis skyo \"I weary of the household life,'' rgyal-posbrul-gyis Ndzigs \"The king is scared of snakes.\" Dpal-sprul rin-po-tshe tells a story of how rgan-mo khyi-so-ssans-rgyas \"an old woman became a Buddha by means of a dog's tooth.\" And note the proverb:blo rtse-gñis-kyis don mi-Ngrub khab rtse-gñis-kyis Ntshem-bu mi-lenThe goal is not reached with an unsteady mind; a stitch is not made with a two-pointed needle.The notion of instrument is easily extended to include states of mind or other abstractions, yielding expressions thatcan be translated adverbally in English -for example, thugs-rdze-s \"with compassion  compassionately,\" tshed-gñer-gyis \"with purpose  purposefully,\" nan-tan-gyis \"with earnestness  assiduously,\" ran-bzin-gyis \"by itsown nature  spontaneously.\"1.2.3. The locus and source rolesThere are two role particles, -la and -na, which signal the LOCUS of an event, and two role particles, -las and -nas, which signal its SOURCE. The locus of an event is the time or place it occurs; the source of an event is theplace or cause or material from or through which it takes place. With verbs of motion the locus is the goal of themotion, and the source is its departure point; a transfer takes place from a source to a locus. With verbs of emotionthe locus is that toward which the emotion is directed; with verbs of construction the source is that out of which thepatient is built.12 Note the following interesting difference between the INSTRUMENT used by an agent and theSOURCE or ground of his action: a proposition A-KYis lag-GIS B- bzun means that A grasped B by A'shand, while A-KYis lag-NAS B- bzun means that A grasped B by B's hand; in the first case the hand is theinstrument used by A, and in the second case the hand is the material ground of the action of grasping.Thus, too, we find, unambiguously, A-KYis skra-NAS B- bzun \"A grasped B by his hair,\" but not, in mostcontexts, ?A-KYIs skra-s B- bzun. < previous pagepage_267next page >"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"page_268file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_268.html[8/7/2010 9:54:44 PM]< previous pagepage_268next page >Page 268It is clear that the two locus particles and two source particles are closely related. The locus particle -la and thesource particle -las both begin with initial l, while the locus particle -na and the source particle -nas both beginwith initial n. The two source particles -las and -nas both end with final -s, while the two locus particles -la and -na both end with final -.13We can distinguish the l- locus from the n- locus, and the l- source from the n- source, by the concept ofBOUNDEDNESS: an n- locus participant or n-source participant is specified as constituting an ENCLOSEDSPACE in or out of which the event occurs. For example, when a person sits by the water, or floats on it, or goestoward it, so that the water is not specified as somehow CONTAINING the action, then the water is an l- locus;but when a person sits or swims under the water, or dives into the water, or moves within or through the water, sothat the water is specified as a closed space relative to the action, then the water is an n- locus. Similarly, when aperson emerges from the water, or a fish leaps up off its surface, the water is an l- source; but when a personcomes out from under the water, so that the water contains some component of his observed motion, the water isan n- source.14 We13 As to the n- locus and source particles, compare the noun nan \"interior, inside, inner part\" andthoughperhaps unlikelyOld Chinese > \"interior, inside, inner.\" It is tempting to hypothesize a Proto-Tibetan particle affix *-s \"SOURCE'' as a formative in both the n- source and l- source particles; since theagency of an event is, in some sense, a source of that event, the agency role particle -KYis might be formedwith the same *-s affix added to the adnominal particle -KYi. Indeed, the Tibetan grammatical tradition hasnoted the relationship between such propositions as sin-mkhan-gyis sta-re-s sin btsad \"The woodsman cutthe tree with an axe\" and sin-mkhan-gyi sta-re-s sin btsad ''The woodsman's axe cut the tree.\"14 The general rule is subject to several conventions. The source of a transferin fact, the source of most sortsof linear motionis an n- source: thus we find bla-ma lha-sa-nas pe-tsin-la Ngro \"The lama goes from Lhasa toPeking,\" gan-nas rñed \"Where did you get that from?\" The target of an emotion is an l- locusthus bla-matshos-la dga \"The lama delights in the dharma,\" rgyal-po lto-la gdun \"The king yearns for food,\" bgegs rgyal-po-la sdan \"The demon hates the king.\" With verbs of construction, the material of which the object is made isusually an l- sourcethus phor-pa gser-las byas \"He made a bowl out of gold,\" rdo-rdze dnul-las grub \"Thevajra was made of silver\"; but occasionally the material is expressed as an n- sourcefor example, khan-pa pha-gu-nas brtsigs \"He built a house from bricks.\" When an animate being is an owner or recipient of an object,the animate being is an l- locus for that object-thus bla-ma-la phren-ba gser-po yod \"The lama has a goldenrosary,\" sans-rgyas-la dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa phul \"The monk gave offerings to the Buddha,\" mi man-poidon-la dge-slon-gis tshos bsad \"The monk taught the dharma for the sake of the many.\" < previous pagepage_268next page >"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"page_269file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_269.html[8/7/2010 9:54:44 PM]< previous pagepage_269next page >Page 269can thus diagram the four particles as follows:NONBOUNDEDBOUNDEDLOCUS-la-naSOURCE-las-nasThese four particles do the same work as the whole array of English prepositionsto, at, in, on, for, through, and soon. One reason they can do so is because English prepositions are often contextually determined. For example,English uses different prepositions for location and direction: we say He lives AT the monastery but He goes TOthe monastery. In Tibetan, the same locus particles are used with verbs of location and verbs of motion. There is noconfusion because, of course, the verbs are differentthus dgon-pa-LA bzugs \"He lives AT the monastery\" anddgon-pa-LA Ngro \"He goes TO the monastery\"; the fact that the locus particle must be TRANSLATED differentlywhen it indicates a site rather than a target is a peculiarity of English.Now such a site or target may be either animate or inanimate. The difference is important in English, whereanimate sites and targets may be given special syntactic treatment; again, Tibetan uses the same locus particle ineither case, with apparently little confusion.15 For example, Tibetan expresses POSSESSION with the particle -laand the verb YOD \"exist spatiotemporally\"thus bla-mala phren-ba yod \"The lama has a rosary,\" rgyal-po-la ral-gri yod ''The king has a sword.'' The construction is the same as that for any assertion of spatiotemporallocationcompare rgya-mtsho-la ña yod \"There are fish in the ocean,\" sin-la spreu yod \"The monkey is in thetree.\"16 The fact that an15 Note the similarity to the reading of agents and instruments. Both are marked with the same particle -KYis, but in any propositionsay, rgyal-po-s ral-gri-s dgra bsad \"The king slew the enemy with asword\"the animate agency is more likely to be read as the agent and the inanimate agency as theinstrument.16 Note, too, assertions of location which in English can be expressedmetaphorically? as possession, andassertions of possession which can be expressedpolitely?-as location: compare, for example, ri-la me-tog yod\"There are flowers on the mountain/The mountain has flowers\" with rgyal-po-la ldzi-ba yod \"The king hasfleas/There are fleas on the king.\"Similarly, with verbs of transfer, English marks as recipients or beneficiaries those targets of the transfercapable of being affected by the thing transferredfor example, sans-rgyas-kyis( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_269next page >"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"page_270file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_270.html[8/7/2010 9:54:45 PM]< previous pagepage_270next page >Page 270animate site is often best TRANSLATED as a possessor is a peculiarity of English.When locus or source particles alone are felt to be insufficient, an author may specify locus or source moreprecisely by using any of several RELATOR NOUNS. Such relator constructions are parallel to such Englishexpressions as on the top of, to the right of, or for the sake offor example, brag-gi kha-la \"on top of the rock,\" deidus-na \"during that time,\" rii og-nas \"from under the mountain,\" dge-slon-gi gseb-nas ''out of the midst of themonks.''171.2.4.

These includeverbs of distance, such as RIN \"be far\" and ÑE \"be near\"; verbs of similarity and agreement, such as MTSHUN ''belike, similar,\" NDRA \"be similar, equal,\" MÑAM \"be like, the same,\" MTHUN ''agree, be in harmony,\" STUN\"make agree, harmonize\"; verbs of meeting, joining, and mixing, such as MDZAL \"meet,\" PHRAD \"meet, fall inwith,\" SPRAD \"bring together, make meet,\" SBYAR \"join, connect,\" SDEB \"join, unite,\" GROGS \"be associated,\"DRIS \"be accustomed, acquainted,\" LHAN \"be together,\" NDRE \"be mixed,\"- SRE \"mix\"; verbs of opposition, suchas KHON \"bear a grudge, be dissatisfied,\" NTHAB \"fight, quarrel,\" GAL \"be opposed,\" SDO \"bid defiance, bear upagainst, risk, venture\"; verbs of connection and separation, such as BREL \"be connected,\" SBREL \"connect, makejoined,\" BRAL \"be separated,\" PHRAL \"separate, deprive\"; and verbs of conversation, such as SMRA \"speak,\"GROS \"consult,\" LAB \"talk.\"19Thus we find, for example, propositions such as gnas Ndi gron-khyer-DAN rin \"This place is far FROM town,\"dge-slon tshos-DAN Nkhon \"The monk is dissatisfied WITH/tired OF the dharma,\" bslu-bai rnam-pas khyeu-DANsmras \"He spoke WITH/TO the youth in a seductive way,\" lus-srog-DAN sdo \"He risks 0 his life,\" mal-Nbyor-pakha-tshub-DAN Nthab \"The yogin struggles WITH/AGAINST a hailstorm,\" sems mig-DAN bsdebs-nas lta, rna-ba-DAN bsdebs-nas ñan \"The mind sees by joining WITH the eye, and hears by joining WITH the ear,\" nan-pa-DAN lta-ba mi-mthun-pai dus-sig yon \"A time will come of views hostile TO/not in accord WITH Buddhism.\"18 The accompaniment particle -dan is the same as the nominal phrase conjunction -dan.

Thematic Structure2.1. Participant OrderWhen a participant is marked by its role particle, its function in the proposition is signalled by the particle ratherthanas in, say, Englishits position relative to the other participants. It is not quite accurate to say that WORDORDER is free in classical Tibetan; a change of word order within a nominal phrase can change its meaningforexample, bla-mas tshos bsad-pa \"the teaching of dharma by the lama\" tshos bla-mas bsad-pa \"the dharma that thelama taught.\" But we can say that in classical Tibetan PARTICIPANT ORDER is free: the two propositions bla-mas tshos bsad and tshos bla-mas bsad have the same propositional content, at least in the sense that the conditionsunder which the two propositions would be true or false are exactly the same.But while the propositional content of these two propositions is arguably the same, their THEMATIC structure isdifferent.20 The proposition bla-mas tshos bsad is ABOUT the lama; the proposition tshos bla-mas bsad isABOUT the dharma. Now the notion of \"aboutness\" is itself far from clear. But the proposition bla-mas tshos bsad\"The lama taught the dharma\" is in some natural way a response to the question ''What about the lama?\" or a leadsentence in an essay about the lama; while the proposition tshos bla-mas bsad \"The dharma-the lama taught it\" isin the same natural way a response to the question ''What about the dharma?\" or a lead sentence in an essay aboutthe dharma.2120 In this sense we can say that three kinds of information are encoded in a Tibetan propositiontheLEXICAL information given by each word (rgyal-po-s dgra- b-rdun-s \"The king hit the enemy\" conveysdifferent lexical information than rgyal-po-s bgegs- b-rdun-s \"The king hit the demon\"); the SYNTACTICinformation given by role particles and tense affixes (rgyal-po-s dgra- b-rdun-s \"The king hit the enemy\"conveys different syntactic information than dgra-s rgyal-po- b-rdun \"The enemy will hit the king\"); andthe THEMATIC information conveyed by the position of each participant (rgyal-po-s dgra- b-rdun-s\"The king hit the enemy\" conveys different thematic information than dgra- rgyal-po-s b-rdun-s \"Theenemythe king hit him\").21 When the patient of a transitive verb is made the theme of a proposition, the proposition may often beconveniently TRANSLATED by an English passivefor example, rdza-ma rdza-mkhan-gyis bzos rgyal-posbtsag \"The potthe potter made it and the king broke it/The pot was made by the potter and broken by the king.\"This is, of course, a feature of English and not of Tibetan. < previous pagepage_272next page >"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"page_273file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_273.html[8/7/2010 9:54:47 PM]< previous pagepage_273next page >Page 273Given the proposition bla-mas tshos bsad \"The lama taught the dharma,\" we would not be surprised to find theparticipant bla-ma \"lama\" telegraphically omitted in a following propositionfor example, bla-mas tshos bsad-tsinbgegs btul \"The lama taught the dharma and tamed demons''; given the proposition tshos bla-mas bsad ''Thedharmathe lama taught it,\" we would not be surprised to find the participant tshos \"dharma\" telegraphically omittedin a following propositionfor example, tshos bla-mas bsad-tsin mkhan-pos bkral \"The dharmathe lama taught itand the abbot explained it.\" In these cases, the missing participant in the second proposition is easily processed asbeing the same as the theme in the first proposition; the sequences are easy to read. But a proposition such as bla-mas tshos bsad-tsin mkhan-pos bkral is harder to processalthough it can certainly be figured outbecause it defeatsour thematic expectations: the apparent theme of the first proposition cannot be processed as being the same as themissing participant in the second. A proposition such as tshos bla-mas bsad-tsin bgegs btul is thematicallyambiguous between the readings \"The lama taught the dharma and HE tamed demons\" and \"The dharma wastaught by the lama and IT tamed demons.\" Note, again, that the telegraphic omission of themes in Tibetancorresponds to pronominalization in English.The normal order of participants in a Tibetan proposition is as follows. The proposition consists first of aSETTING for the rest of the proposition, which remainder is the ACTION; that action consists of a statement ofthe THEME, followed by whatever information the proposition supplies about that theme, which is called theRHEME; that rheme consists of the PERIPHERYall the incidental participants in the eventfollowed by theNUCLEUS; and that nucleus, finally, consists of the CORE participant in the proposition, followed by the EVENT.For example, in the proposition dei tshe-la rgyal-po-s ral-gri-s dgra- bsad \"At that time, the king slew the enemywith a sword,\" the locus participant dei tshe \"that time\" is the SETTING of the proposition, while the remainder isits action; the agent participant rgyal-po \"king\" is the THEME of the action, while the remainder is its rheme; theinstrument participant ral-gri \"sword\" is the PERIPHERY of the rheme, while the remainder is its nucleus; and thepatient participant dgra \"enemy\" is the CORE of the nucleus, followed only by the event.The participant in the SETING slot supplies the place, time, or circumstances which place the event among otherevents; such settings might be spatial (\"In < previous pagepage_273next page >"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"page_274file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_274.html[8/7/2010 9:54:47 PM]< previous pagepage_274next page >Page 274the woods ...\"), temporal (\"From that day onward ...\"), logical (\"Therefore . . .\"), or circumstantial (\"Upon hisarrival . . .\").

The PERIPHERAL participants are all the remaining participantsinstruments, accompaniments, sources,lociwhich are not setting, theme, or core.2.2. TopicsA TOPIC is part of a proposition which is singled out by one of several syntactic devices as THAT WHICH IS TOBE TALKED ABOUT. A topicas opposed to a themeis always announced; most propositions, in fact, do not havesuch an announced topic, although every proposition has a theme; the topic and the theme of a proposition may ormay not be the same. For example, in the proposition rgyal-pos dgra ni bsad grogs ni bskyans the participantrgyal-po \"king\" is the theme; but first dgra \"enemy\" and then grogs \"friend\" is signalled as the topic by thetopicalizer ni, and we might translate \"What the king did was this: enemieshe killed them; friendshe protectedthem.\" On the other hand a theme may be brought into greater prominence by being made the topic as well, as innai mthus ni bgegs Ndul ser-ba Nbebs, where the participant nai mthu \"my magic power'' is both theme and topic,and we might translate \"My magic powerit tames demons; it casts down hailstorms.\"2.2.1. The topicalizer niThe TOPICALIZER ni may be placed anywhere in a proposition except in initial position or before a boundconstituent; it signals that what precedes is the topicfor example, khyod ni blo nor \"Youyour thought is in error,\"span-bar bya-ba ni spons-sig \"What you should renouncerenounce it!\" mar-pa zer ba ni yod skyes-mtshog mar-pazer-ba ni med \"Someone called Mar-pa-there is one; someone called Saint Mar-pathere isn't.\" The source of thistopicalizer seems to be an archaic exclamatory particle ni that recurs regularly at the end of the first foot in everyline of the ancient bardic poetry.

It sets off chapter titles and paragraphheadings (as in leu dan-po ni \"Chapter One,\" dan-po tshos dar-bai tshul ni \"Part One: How the Dharma Spread\");it topicalizes the theme of an equation (as in mi-la ni mal-Nbyor-pa yin \"Milahe's a yogin,\" na ni bram-ze \"MeI'ma brahmin\"); it topicalizes elements embedded in larger syntactic structures (as in rgya-mtsho ni tshen-po-la ñaman-po yod \"The oceanin it so vast are many fish,\" ñi-mai ni od-zer Nbar \"The sunthe light of it blazes\"); it setsoff the key term in commentarial elaboration (as in bslab-pa kun-gyi gzi Ndzin-zin gsuns-te bslabpa ni lhag-patshul-khrims-dan lhag-pa sems-dan lhag-pa ses-rab-kyi bslab-pa gsum-du nan-pa-la grags-pa \"It is said: 'Heholds the foundation of all teachings.' Teachingsthese are known among Buddhists as the three teachings ofmorality and meditation and wisdom\").The topicalizer ni can, of course, be used excessively: in poetry especially it is sometimes used only as aconvenient device for filling out the meter. An effective stylist uses it sparingly so that it can be most effectiveforexample, Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, in whose biography of Mi-la ras-pa we find Ndi ni snar-gyi de-ka yin \"Why, thisis the same one as before!\" nai tshed-du sdig-pa sog-tu btan-ba ni min \"Well, I certainly didn't send you toaccumulate sins for my sake!\" zus-pai ni yab mi-gsan \"I told him, but my lord won't listen,\" kun bsig-pa ni min\"This is certainly not to tear down all of it,\" ned-kyis ni khyod-kyi gis phrogs-pa med \"Well, it wasn't we who stoleyour inheritance!\"2.2.2.

For example, we find the proverb zal-la pad-ma Ndab-brgyad, thugs-la dug-Ntsher sdon-bu \"As for his mouthan eight-petal lotus; as for his hearta thorny bush.\" The poet Pad-ma dkar-pouses such topicalization in the refrain of a song, where he repeats, at the end of each stanza, bar-tsad-la med-do\"As for hindrancesthere aren't any!\"When Mi-la recounts the story of his life, he uses such topicalizing constructions as gdun-gi mtshan-la mi-la zesgrags-so \"As for the name of my familyit is known as Mi-la,\" zin-gi min-la mthun-rkyen-du tshags \"And the nameof that fieldit came to be Lucky,\" brtsigs-pa de-la naigyad-rdorgrags-pa yin \"As for that which I builtit is knownas my Hero Stone.\" And Mar-pa's wife, puzzled by her husband's behavior toward Mi-la, says sku-mdun-du khyi-zig byun-run tshos gsun, khyod-la thugs-la mi-Ndogs ''He teaches the dharma even should a dog appear beforehim; but as for youhe does not take you to his heart.\"This topicalizer, like ni, is also used to set off chapter titles and paragraph headings, as in rgyal-sa mi-ñag-la sor-bai lo-rgyus-la \"As for the history of the loss of the kingdom to the Tanguts .. .\" or glin-bzii min-la \"As for thenames of the four continents . ..\"Occasionally, too, the two topicalization devices are used together: Mother Sum-pa says myi phyug-po-la ni dban-po nor-dad-tsan-gyis phun-la, myi Ndzans-pa-la ni nan-pa phra-dog-tsan-gyis rlag-go \"As for a rich manthegreedy powerful ruin him; as for a wise manthe envious wicked destroy him.\"2.2.3. Identification and definition with -STeBeginning with the translation literature, we find constructions with the conjunction -STe \"AND\" whichapproximate the topical constructions we have been discussing. The conjunction -STe \"AND\" can be used toconjoin two propositions with a common theme and with that theme telegraphically omitted in the second memberof the conjunctionfor example, bla-ma dgon-pa-la byon-te tshos bsad \"The lama came to the monastery and taughtthe dharma.\" Now oneor bothof these conjuncts can be an equative proposition, and that equative conjunct canfrequently have the verb YIN omitted; in such cases we will speak of an IDENTIFYING construction.Some identifying constructions have the equative proposition as their SECOND < previous pagepage_279next page >"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"page_280file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_280.html[8/7/2010 9:54:50 PM]< previous pagepage_280next page >Page 280memberfor example, gzugs-kyi rnam-par rig-pa Nbyun-ste phyii don-las yin \"The perception of form occurs: (it) isfrom an external object,\" yul de-na bram-ze Ndug-ste dbul-Nphons-pa-zig-go \"In that land dwelt a brahmin: (he)(was) a poor man.\" In such constructions the equative second member comments on or additionally characterizesthe theme of the first member.22Other identifying constructions with -STe have the equative proposition as their FIRST member. It is here that thefirst conjunct begins to look very much like a topic. Thus in the translation literature we find such constructions asSanskrit ye sattvah svarge sambhutas tajjam sukham pratyanubhavanti Tibetan sems-tsan gan-dag mtho-ris-laNbyun-ba-dag-ste de-na yod-pai bde-ba so-sor myon-o \"Sentient creatures who are born in heaventhey taste thebliss that is found there\"; and in the classical literature we find such constructions as ti-lli na-ro mar-pa-ste bla-magon-ma-rnams-kyis rnam-thar gsuns \"Tilli, Naro, Mar-pa-the lamas of the past have told their life stories.\"Finally, we find highly stereotyped identifying coordinations with truncated equative propositions in BOTHmembers. These are found frequently in the classical texts, used to enumerate chapter titles and paragraph headings(as in rma-byai skyes-pai rabs-te skyes-pai rabs gñis-pa \"The fable of the peacock this is fable number two,\"tshos-kyi Nkhor-lo bskor-bai leu-ste btso-la-pa \"The chapter on turning the wheel of dharmathis is numberfifteen\"); to topicalize a term being defined (as in sans-rgyas-te ma-rig-pai gñid sans-pao22 One widespread use of this construction is to give the REASON for the assertion of the former member.In Sanskrit philosophical writing an assertion is often followed by a nominal compound in the ablative casegiving the reason for the fact or event asserted; the Tibetan translators rendered such constructions using aconjunction with -STe \"AND\" whose second equative member was a nominal complement with the abstractnoun head phyir \"reason, cause, account\" and the equative verb YIN omitted. The construction is easier toread than to describe: we find Sanskrit badhanam siddham svakarmavipakadhipatyat Tibetan gnod-paNgrub-ste ran-gi las-kyi smin-pai dban-gi phyir-ro \"Pain comes about: this is because of the dominatingforce of the ripening of personal karma,\" Sanskrit na naraka yujyante tad-duhkhapratisamvedanat Tibetansems-tsan dmyal-bar mi-rigs-te dei sdug-bsnal mi-myon-bai phyir-ro \"They cannot be considered to be inhell: this is because they do not experience its suffering,'' Sanskrit vacas tu nendriyatvam vacanesiksavisesapeksatvat Tibetan nag-gi ni tshig smra-bar bya-ba-la dban-po-ñid ma-yin-te slob-pai khyad-par-la ltos-pai phyir-ro ''Language is not the controlling force of speech: this is because it requires aparticular learning process.\" Such constructions were borrowed from the translation language into theclassical language, and identifications of this sort are a common stylistic feature of Tibetan philosophicalexposition. < previous pagepage_280next page >"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"page_281file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_281.html[8/7/2010 9:54:51 PM]< previous pagepage_281next page >Page 281\"Buddhahe is one who has awakened from the sleep of ignorance,\" si-ra-ste mgo-bo zes bya-bao \"The wordsirasthis means head\"); and to summarize or identify lists of terms (as in lus-dan srog-dan yid-dan btan-sñoms-kyi dban-po-dag-ste dban-po bzi \"The powers of body and life and mind and equanimitythese are the four powers,''phyag-mtshan sa-bon sku-rdzogs-te rdo-rdze tshog gsum-po \"The emblem, the seed, and the perfected bodytheseare the three diamond rituals\").

Two or more propositions can be connectedtogether on the same level with any of several CONJUNCTIONSsuch as -Tsin \"AND,\" -Am \"OR,\" -Yan ''BUT\"toform a single complex proposition. Or one proposition can be embedded at a lower level within anotherproposition by being NOMINALIZEDthat is, turned into a nominal by the affixation of any of several nominalizingparticles. For example, the proposition bla-mas bgegs btul ''The lama tamed the demon\" can be nominalized by thenominalizing particle -Pa to become bla-mas bgegs btul-ba \"the taming of the demon by the lama.\" Such anominalized proposition can then occur anywhere a nominal can occur. It can be the head of a nominal, as inrgyal-pos [bla-mas bgegs btul-ba]- mthon \"The king saw the taming of the demon by the lama\"; or it can be aCOMPLEMENT that modifies a nominal or verbal head, as in [bla-mas bgegs btul-ba]-i sgrun \"the tale of thetaming of the demon by the lama,\" or a RELATIVE that modifies a nominal head, as in [bla-mas bgeg btul-ba]-ibgegs \"demon which the lama tamed.\"The coordination of propositions by juxtaposing them on the same level is sometimes called PARATAXIS; thesubordination of propositions by embedding one proposition within another is sometimes called HYPOTAXIS. Aparatactic construction thus relates a sequence; a hypotactic construction expresses a hierarchy. Hypotaxis may bemore confusing, since the reader must still process the propositions sequentially and is thus often forced to storethe beginning of one proposition while processing another; on the other hand, parataxis may be more vague, sincethe reader must process the juxtaposed propositions often without overt syntactic clues to their relation.11 Sometimes the style of an author can be related to a predilection for one or the other grammaticalstructure. The following passage from Faulkner's short novel The Bear is both highly hypotactic andtypically Faulknerian:. . and the desk and the shelf above it on which rested the ledgers in which McCaslin recorded the slowoutward trickle of food and supplies and( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_282next page >"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"page_283file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_283.html[8/7/2010 9:54:52 PM]< previous pagepage_283next page >Page 283( footnote continued from previous page)equipment which returned each fall as cotton made and ginned and sold (two threads frail as truth andimpalpable as equators yet cable-strong to bind for life them who made the cotton to the land their sweatfell on), and the older ledgers clumsy and archaic in size and shape, on the yellowed pages of which wererecorded ...Here the cumulative hypotaxis (the shelf on which . . . the ledgers in which . . the trickle which . . . them who . .. on the pages of which . . .)serves to reinforce an oppressive mood of involuted relationships, andperhaps evenmoreto subordinate the entire commercial process to McCaslin's desk and shelf. Compare this passage with thefollowing highly paratactic and similarly characteristic description from John LeCarre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier,Spy:The first burst shot off a back wheel and turned the car over. He saw the wheel fly over the bonnet as thecar took to the ditch on the left. The ditch might have been ten feet deep but the snow let him down kindly.The car didn't burn so he lay behind it and waited, facing across the track hoping to get a shot at themachine-gunner. The next burst came from behind and threw him up against the car.Here the cumulative parataxis (and, but, so, and, and)achieves an effect of hurried but disjointed action:cohesion is maintained lexically, rather than by explicit syntactic relationships, as key descriptive terms arerepeated (burst . . . wheel . . . car, wheel . . . car . . ditch, ditch . . . snow, car . . . machine-gunner, burst . . .car). Similarly, compare the following hypotactic passage from Janet Flanner's The Cubical City,Her honesty and luxury from which, now that she was well established in life, she seemed to gather suchstrength, were like a rich endowment from which she drew not only the expensive decoration of her greyfurs that gave her grey eyes the value of semi-precious stones but also her special free attitude toward thecostly walls that housed her, the sum of all these expenses only being a tithe of what was her fund ofresourcefulness and amplitude.with the following passage from Saul Bellow's Humboldt's Gift:Wonderful things are done by women for their husbands. She loved a poet-king and allowed him to holdher captive in the country. She sipped beer from a Pabst can. The room was low-pitched. Husband and wifewere large. They sat together on the Castro sofa. There wasn't enough room on the wall for their shadows.They overflowed onto the ceiling.As in English, any particular Tibetan text is inevitably a mixture of parataxis and hypotaxis;( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_283next page >"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"page_284file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_284.html[8/7/2010 9:54:52 PM]< previous pagepage_284next page >Page 2841. Conjoined Propositions1.1. ConjunctionsA CONJUNCTION is a particle that joins propositions together paratactically; in classical Tibetan propositions arelinked by conjunctions, while sentences are not. In the classical language there are three types ofconjunctionALTERNATIVE (\"PROPOSITION or PROPOSITION\"), ADVERSATIVE (\"PROPOSITION butPROPOSITION\") and COORDINATIVE (''PROPOSITION and PROPOSITION\").2An indefinite number of propositions can be linked together by such conjunctions. This horizontal expansion canextend to the limits of stylistic tolerance, which in the classical language seem to be quite broad. Thus the series\"PROPOSITION and PROPOSITION and . . . PROPOSITION\" may reach some length before it becomes aSENTENCE by the addition of a performance particle.In all three types of conjunction it is expectedand in an extended sense perhaps even mandatoryfor the conjoinedpropositions to have some theme( footnote continued from previous page)still, we can speak of Tibetan syntactic styles, bearing in mind that these are broad generalizations.Individual AUTHORS tend toward one or the other type of construction: Grags-pa rgyal-mtshan andGtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, for example, are typically paratactic, while Tson-kha-pa or the fifth Dalai LamaBlo-bzan rgya-mtsho are typically hypotactic. Particular GENRES as well can be distinguishedsyntactically: historical and narrative prose generally tend toward parataxis, while philosophical andtechnical prose tends toward hypotaxis. Some poetic genressuch as mystic songare predominantlyparatactic; others such as the florid and highly Sanskritized encomia that often preface expository textscanbe quite hypotactic. Such hypotaxis also frequently serves to mark an elegant or formal REGISTER: thelong honorific salutation at the head of a Tibetan letter is highly hypotactic, as opposed to the parataxis thatmarks the colloquial or informal register of such a deliberately nonliterary stylist as Dpal-sprul Ndzigs-medtshos-kyi dban-po.2 Generally speaking, we can characterize the conjunctions by making two distinctions: the alternativeconjunction \"OR\" links propositions only one of which is asserted to be true, while both the adversativeconjunction \"BUT\" and the coordinative conjunction \"AND\" link propositions all of which are asserted to betrue; the adversative conjunction \"BUT\" asserts that the propositions it links are in some way semantically orpragmatically opposed, while the coordinative conjunction \"AND'' asserts that the propositions it links are insome way semantically or pragmatically congruent. < previous pagepage_284next page >"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"page_285file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_285.html[8/7/2010 9:54:53 PM]< previous pagepage_285next page >Page 285in common; thus we can expect also to find thematic participants omitted from latter members of the conjunction,even to the extent of reducing such a proposition to the event alone.1.1.1. The alternative conjunctionThe ALTERNATIVE CONJUNCTION PARTICLE is -Am.3 The hyphen indicates that the form is BOUND andoccurs only with an immediately preceding proposition. The capitalization indicates that the vowel prefixes to itselfthe last consonant of the preceding syllable codathus dag-gam, rin-nam, yod-dam, yin-nam, thub-bam, Npham-rnam, sgyur-ram, Nbul-lam, and lags-sam. A preceding open syllable becomes a diphthongthus dgaam, Nbriam,rgyuam, dgeam, and Ngroam. In the scansion of verse such diphthongs may occasionally be counted as twosyllables for the purposes of meter.The alternative conjunction offers a choice between two or more possibilities, only one of which is asserted to betrue. On the one hand, the proposed alternatives may beas with the adversative conjunction \"BUT\"perceived assemantically or pragmatically opposed to each otherthus mii rigs mthoam mi rigs dman \"Either a family is high orthe family is low,\" nad-pa gson-nam Ntshi \"The sick person either lives or dies,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-damma-bsad \"Buddhas have either taught the dharma or not,'' rgyal-pos dgra gsod-dam dgras gsod \"Either the kingkills the enemy or the enemy kills him.\"On the other hand, the proposed alternatives may beas with the coordinative conjunction \"AND\"perceived assemantically or pragmatically congruent, although it is still asserted that only one of the propositions is true for anysingle individual at any one momentthus mal-Nbyor-pa ri-la Ndzeg-gam lun-pa-la Ngrims-sam phug-pa-la bzugs\"A yogin ascends the mountains or wanders in the valleys or abides in a cave,\" bgegs-rnams-kyis sems-tsan skrag-gam snad-dam gsod \"Demons frighten or harm or kill sentient creatures,\" dge-slon bzan-pos tshos thos-sam bsam-rnam sgom \"A virtuous monk studies the dharma, or ponders it, or meditates upon it.\"3 We will note here only briefly that this is clearly the same as the sentence-final question particle -Am. Wecanand, later on, we willhypothesize that the Tibetan interrogative is derived ultimately from an underlyingalternative conjunction. < previous pagepage_285next page >"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"page_286file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_286.html[8/7/2010 9:54:53 PM]< previous pagepage_286next page >Page 2861.1.2. The adversative conjunctionThe ADVERSATIVE CONJUNCTION PARTICLE is -Yan, which becomes -kyan after preceding final -g, -d, -b,and -s; becomes -yan after preceding final -, -n, -m, -r, -l, and open stressed syllables; and becomes -an afterpreceding open unstressed syllables.The adversative conjunction links propositions all of which are asserted to be true, but which are asserted to be insome way semantically or pragmatically dissonant: propositions so joined are in a relation of thesis and antithesis.Thus we find such SEMANTIC dissonances as gdon-pa dkar-yan bsam-pa nag \"His countenance is white but histhoughts are black,\" and such PRAGMATIC dissonances as rgyal-po btud-kyan khros \"The king bowed down butwas angry\" and sans-rgyas Ndzig-rten-la skyes-kyan Ndzig-rten-gyis ma-gos \"The Buddha is born in the world butis not sullied by the world.\" The wit of what we can call ADVERSATIVE PROVERBS often lies in their pointingout an unexpected pragmatic dissonance: for example, in the archaic Tun-huang manuscript entitled The Sayings ofMother Sum-pa we find Nbrog-rtsa bzan-yan rkan-Ngros dbyar rdzud-do \"The pasture grass is goodbut it tanglesyour feet in summer.''We can point out too that a conjunction such as gzon-nu yin-kyan dban-po mo \"He is young but his faculties arekeen\" embodies a presupposition that being young and being sagacious are pragmatically dissonant, while aconjunction such as gzon-nu yin-kyan dban-po mi-mo \"He is young but his faculties are not keen\" presupposesprecisely the opposite. We may similarly note the presuppositions embodied in such conjunctions in smras-kyanmi-ñan \"He speaks but does not listen\" or Ntshal-yan mi-rñed \"He seeks but does not find,\" which assume thatspeaking and listening or seeking and finding are pragmatically consonant.4 This bound conjunction -Yan is clearly related tobut is not the same asthe connective Yan \"ALSO,\" whichis not bound but free. We can point out too that the classical form -Yan is the only form in Y- among theparticles, and appears in fact to derive from a Proto-Tibetan form *-KYan, which at one time underwent thesame morpho-phonological changes as -KYis and -KYi. By the classical period, however, the voiced formof the particle the form found after preceding sonorant finalshad become -yan rather than the expected *-gyan, although we still find the voiced form -gyan sporadically instead of -yan in the archaic Old Tibetanmanuscripts preserved at Tun-huang. < previous pagepage_286next page >"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"page_287file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_287.html[8/7/2010 9:54:54 PM]< previous pagepage_287next page >Page 287Such presuppositional relations may be more remote. Thus, for example, we make the pragmatic assumption thatenemies rejoice at our misfortunes rather than weep at them: hence Mi-la ras-pa, when he is starving in a cave,sings dgra sdan-ba bltas-kyan mtshi-ma Ntshor \"Though a bitter enemy see me he would weep,\" linking the twoantithetical propositions with the adversative conjunction. Similarly, Mar-pa promises Mi-la that he will not haveto tear down the tower he is to build, saying Ndi bsig-kyan mi-dgos \"Though you tear this down it is notnecessary/You can tear this down, but you don't have to,\" expressing the pragmatic assumption that people teardown what they build only when necessary. That this promise may most easily be TRANSLATED into Englishsimply as \"You will not have to tear this one down\" does not change its adversative character in Tibetan.51.1.2.1. Dialect variantsThe adversative conjunction -Yan has two DIALECT VARIANTS. The older variantapparently related to the Proto-Tibetan form *-KYanis -KYi, which resembles the adnominal particle -KYi but is almost certainly unrelated to it:thus we find tshig brdzod-kyi don mi-Ngrel \"He says the words but does not explain the meaning,\" bza-ba za-yibtun-ba mi-Ndod \"I am eating the food but don't want anything to drink,\" rgya-mtsho-la mu-tig Nbyun-gi gserman-po mi Nbyun \"Pearls are found in the ocean but not much gold.\"This variant is found predominantly in earlier material, especially in translations from the Sanskritfor example,Sanskrit idam eva satyam moham anyam Tibetan Ndi ni bden-gyi gzan ni rdzun-pao \"This is truth but the other isfalsehood,\" Sanskrit samvrtam etal laksanam na paramarthikam Tibetan mtshan-ñid Ndi ni kun-rdzob-pa yin-gyidon-dam-pa ni ma-yin \"This characteristic is conventional rather than absolute,\" Sanskrit katham vayauvarnasadbhavah, sraddhaniya eso 'rtho nanumaniyah Tibetan rlun-la kha-dog dzi-5 Interestingly, we find cases where two conjoined antithetical propositions are identical: here all latterparticipants are left out, leaving only the verb. Such propositions are found predominantly with stativeverbs, and have an intensive meaning; semantically they seem to be asserting that there is no way thepredication could be opposedthus bla-ma tshean tshe \"The lama is very great,\" bu-mo mdzes-kyan mdzes\"Oh but the girl is beautiful,\" lam rin-yan rin \"The path is so very long.\" The construction is old in Tibetan.In the archaic manuscripts preserved in Central Asia, for example, we find btsa-na ni dpal-yan dpal ''If youlook upon ithow glorious!\" < previous pagepage_287next page >"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"page_288file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_288.html[8/7/2010 9:54:54 PM]< previous pagepage_288next page >Page 288Itar yod tse-na, don Ndi ni dad-par bya-ba yin-gyi rdzes-su dpog-par bya-ba ni ma-yin-no \"How can air havecolor?

Here we find such conjunctions as ses-run mi-ses-pa ltar byed \"He knows, but acts like one who does notknow,\" sku-mdun-du khyi-zig byun-run tshos gsun \"Though a dog appear before him he teaches dharma,\" thugsdges-pa-zig byun-run rmi-lam-la Nbyun-sa med gsuns \"He was delighted, but said, 'Dreams have no meaning,'\"sems-gso man-po mdzad-run tshogs-la rol-pai Nduses stor \"She comforted me greatly, but I had lost all thoughtof enjoying the ritual food.\" Such constructions with -run are found in the prose of Gtsan-smyon, but in the songsattributed to Mi-la himselfmost of which in all likelihood considerably predate their collection by Gtsan-smyon inthe fifteenth centurywe find the consistent use of -Yan rather than -runfor < previous pagepage_288next page >"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"page_289file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_289.html[8/7/2010 9:54:55 PM]< previous pagepage_289next page >Page 289example, Mi-la sings bsgoms-pas ma-grol-yan mi-med lun-ston-du Ntshi-bar sog \"Though I be not liberated bymeditating, may I yet die in a lonely empty valley.\"1.1.3. The coordinative conjunctionsThere are two coordinative conjunction particles. The first is the coordinative conjunction -Tsin, which becomes -TSin after preceding final -g, -d, and -b; becomes -zin after preceding -, -, -m, -r, -l, and open syllables; andbecomes -sin after preceding final and postfinal -s. The second is the coordinative conjunction -STe, whichbecomes -ste after preceding final -g, -, -b, -m, and open syllables; becomes -te after preceding final -n, -r, -l, and-s; and becomes -de after preceding final -d.These coordinative conjunctions link propositions all of which are asserted to be true, and which are asserted to bein some was semantically or pragmatically consonant. Thusto use the same example as beforethe adversativeconjunction gzon-nu yin-kyan dban-po mo \"He is young but his faculties are keen\" embodies a presuppositionopposite to that embodied in the coordinative conjunction gzon-nu yin-te dban-po mo \"He is young and hisfaculties are keen,\" the former assuming the pragmatic incongruence of youth and sagacity and the latter assumingtheir pragmatic congruence.Among SEMANTIC congruences, we can group together what we can call PARAPHRASE coordinations, wherethe second conjunct says pretty much the same thing as the firstfor example, gnad-tsin Ntshe \"He hurts andharms,\" Ndzigs-sin skrags \"He is frightened and terrified,\" bsil-zin gran ''It is cool and cold,\" mdzes-te sdug ''Sheis lovely and beautiful.\" And we can distinguish those from what we can call PARALLEL coordinations, wherethe second conjunct adds to the first conjunct additional information of the same type for example, sa-la za-zinkhrag-la Nthun \"They feed on flesh and gorge on blood,\" byan-tshub Ndi-las Nbyun-ste sans-rgyas Ndi-las skye\"Enlightenment comes from this, and Buddhas are born from this,\" mig-gis gzugs-rnams mi-mthon-zin yid-kyistshos-rnams mi-ses \"The eye does not see forms, nor does the mind perceive thoughts,\" drod gnod-de bsil-ba phan\"Heat is harmful and cold beneficial.\"Similarly, among PRAGMATIC congruences, we can group together what we can call SEQUENTIALcoordinations, where, as a practical matter, the second < previous pagepage_289next page >"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"page_290file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_290.html[8/7/2010 9:54:55 PM]< previous pagepage_290next page >Page 290conjunct happens after the firstfor example, Nbros-sin gab \"He runs away and hides,\" bu-mo sin-la Ndzegs-sinme-tog Nthogs \"The girl climbed up the tree and picked the flower,\" and, from an archaic Central Asianmanuscript, the couplet sa sñegs-te ni sleb, Npans-te ni bzigs \"He pursued the deer, yes, and caught it; he shot it,yes, and hit it.\" And we can distinguish those from what we can call SIMULTANEOUS coordinations, where, as apractical matter, the second conjunct happens at the same time as the firstfor example, bla-ma-dan mdzal-te zalmthon \"He met the lama and saw his face,\" rgyal-pos dgra brduns-te sgyel ''The king struck the enemy and threwhim down,'' ña Ntshor-zii Ntsho \"They catch fish and make a living,\" Ngags-te si \"He choked and died.\"61.1.3.1. Simultaneous and periphrastic constructionsIn many such simultaneous coordinations, it is clear that the first conjunct is narrower in scope than the secondconjunct, and specifies a condition under which the second conjunct takes placefor example, ske bsdams-te bsad\"He squeezed his throat and killed him/He strangled him,\" Ndzigs-te bros \"He was frightened and ran away/He ranaway frightened,\" po-ti khyer-te son \"He carried his books and went/He went off carrying his books,\" rgyal-posg.yog-pos bskor-zin bla-mai drun-du byon \"The king was surrounded by his servants and came into the presence ofthe lama/The king, surrounded by his servants, came into the presence of the lama,\" or, from an archaic manuscriptpreserved in Central Asia, rbeg-ga rbeg-si rma byeu gtshig-du Nphrul-nas Nphur-te6 Of course, such sequential and simultaneous coordinations form a continuous scale, from the clearlysequential at one end (such as bla-ma dgon-pa-la bslebs-te tshos bsad \"The lama arrived at the monasteryand taught the dharma\") to the clearly simultaneous at the other (such as nu-zin sdod \"He weeps andwaits\"), with a grey area in between, where the two types shade into each otherfor example, glu blans-zinabs-bro mdzad, which can be read either as \"He sang and (then) danced\" or as \"He sang and danced (at thesame time).\"We can note here that, when such conjoined verbs are negated, the negative particle mI-\"NOT\" precedes thesecond verb, as opposed to English, where the negative marker precedes the first verbthus, from the Legs-parbsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter by Sa-skya pandita, mkhas-pa brtsad-tsin madris-pa, de-yi bar-du gtin mi-dpogs\"As long as one has not disputed and questioned a wise man, one has not measured his depth,\" or, from thebiography of Mi-la ras-pa by Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, yul-nas dmag gyabs-te ma-bsad-na, Ndis da-dun yul Ndiphun-du Ndzug \"If we do not call a host from the village and kill him, this one will ruin the village evenmore.\" < previous pagepage_290next page >"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"page_291file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_291.html[8/7/2010 9:54:56 PM]< previous pagepage_291next page >Page 291son \"Rbeg-ga rbeg-si, having changed into a little peacock, went flying away.\"In fact, we not infrequently find such constructions where the first conjunct functions almost adverbally to thesecond conjunctfor example, Ntshens-te sñam \"was happy and thought/thought happily,\" gsan-ste brkus \"acted insecret and stole/stole secretly,\" bskyar-te btan \"repeated and sent/sent repeatedly,\" Nthab-pa med-tsin si \"waswithout struggle and died/died peacefully,\" bu Nkhrid-de ons \"brought his son and came/came with his son,''Nphar-te Ngro ''flies and goes/goes flying,\" tsheg-sgra-dan btsas-te Nbar \"is possessed of a crackling sound andburns/burns with a crackling sound.\"When the verb in the second conjunct is one with the broadest possible scope, such as YOD \"existspatiotemporally\" or NDUG \"stay, abide, be there\" (or their elegant forms MTSHIS and GDA, respectively), theconstruction becomes PERIPHRASTICfor example, from the same archaic Central Asian manuscript cited above,sñi-la rma byeu-zig thogs-sin Ndug \"A little peacock was there tangled in the snare,\" or, from the Ge-sar epic, Nburtsig-po phru-gu bde-mo zig-la gyur-te yod \"The tiny worm was there become a beautiful child,\" or, from otherarchaic Central Asian manuscripts, snar phyug-tsin phons-te Ndug \"He was rich before and was now poor,\" srinmyig-rnon-kyis mthon-ste myi bros-te mtshis \"The sharp-eyed demon saw him, and the man was there fled away.\"1.1.3.2.

The omitted portion is optionally but frequently replacedwith the phrasal conjunction -dan.Note, for example, the proverb tshan Nthun-ba-la mnon-par dga-bai mi bdag-la phan-dan gzan-la bde- mi-nus\"A man who delights in drinking beer is incapable of benefit to himself or happiness to others.\" This proposition isprocessed as a conjunction of the two propositions tshan Nthun-ba-la mnon-par dga-bai mi bdag-la phan- mi-nus\"A man who delights in drinking beer is incapable of benefit to himself\" and tshan Nhun-ba-la mnon-par dga-baimi gzan-la bde- mi-nus \"A man who delights in drinking beer is incapable of happiness to others\"; the participanttshan Nthun-ba-la mnon-par dga-bai mi \"man who delights in drinking beer'' isas we might expecttelegraphicallyomitted in the second conjunct; but, in addition, the patient particle, verb phrase, and conjunction particle - mi-nus(-Tsin)have been omitted from the prior conjunct and replaced with -dan, from which they must bereconstructed by the reader. Of course, such reconstruction is impossible until the reader has reached the end of thesecond conjunct, and the interpretation of the proposition as a whole is held in reserve until that timeand thus thesense of suspension and resolution which can make a gapped conjunction an effective stylistic device.Similarly, note the proverb mkhas-pa ses-rab-dan blun-po dad-pai rdzes Nbrans \"A wise man follows the track ofwisdom, and a fool of credulity.\" Here, the adnominal particle, patient participant, verb phrase, and conjunctionparticle -KYi rdzes- Nbrans(-TSin)have been omitted from the prior conjunct and replaced with -dan, to bereconstructed by the reader. And, in the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, we find sa sa-mal-dan rdo rdo-mal-du skyol-zig \"Take the( footnote continued from previous page)constructions with -gi, while the Central Tibetan and Bhutanese prints tend to favor constructions with -gin-for example, nan-du sog gsun-gin Ndug \"He says, 'Come on in!\"' in the Spuns-than, Bstan-rgyas-glinand Bkra-sis lhun-po prints, but ... gsun-gi Ndug in the Spo print, pha-dzo khru slog-gin yod \"My lordfather is ploughing\" in the Spuns-than, Bstan-rgyas-glin and Bkra-sis lhun-po prints, but... klog-gi yod inthe Spo print. < previous pagepage_293next page >"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"page_294file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_294.html[8/7/2010 9:54:57 PM]< previous pagepage_294next page >Page 294earth back to where you got the earth and the stone back to where you got the stone!\" andwithout the phrasalconjunction -dan bu skyes-pa-la min, tshan drans-pa-la gtam bya-bargda \"When a son is born a namingceremony, and when beer is offered a story, should be done,\" khan-pai nan sa-tshub-dan ros gan, phyi nu-tshon-gis gan-ba de pe-tas mthon \"Pe-ta saw the inside of the house filled with dust and corpses, and the outside filledwith lamentation.''2. NominalizationNOMINALIZATION converts an entire proposition into a nominal by the addition of a final nominalizingparticle:9 for example, given the proposition bla-mas bgegs btul \"The lama tamed the demon,\" we could find thenominalized propositions bla-mas bgegs btul-ba \"the taming of the demon by the lama,\" bla-mas bgegs btul-sa\"the place where the lama tamed the demon,\" bla-mas bgegs btul-tshul \"the way the lama tamed the demon,\" andso on.A nominalized propositionof any length and complexitycan occur anywhere that a nominal normally occurs. Thesyntactic distribution of, say, the nominal dgon-pa \"monastery\" is exactly the same as that of the nominal bla-masbgegs btul-sa \"place where the lama tamed the demon\"for example, dgon-pa ri-la yod \"The monastery is on themountain\" and bla-mas bgegs btul-sa ri-la yod \"The place where the lama tamed the demon is on the mountain,\"dgon-pai zin-bkod ''a map of the monastery\" and bla-mas bgegs btul-sai zin-bkod \"a map of the place where thelama tamed the demon.\"Such nominalization is extremely common in classical Tibetan. Like many other Tibeto-Burman languages, Tibetandeveloped quite a number of nominalizing particles, often by the syntactic specialization of nominals.109 Note that only three kinds of particle can immediately follow a verb in a Tibetanpropositionperformatives, conjunctions, and nominalizers.10 We can here mention several such nominalizers which will not be discussed in more detail below -tshul\"way that PROPOSITION,\" as in bla-ma Ngrul-tshul \"the way that the lama walks\"; -ñen \"danger ofPROPOSITION,\" as in dmyal-bar Ngro-ñen \"the danger of going to hell\"; -dus \"time that PROPOSITION,\" asin tshun-ma-la bu btsas-dus \"the time that his wife bore a son\"; -res \"turn at PROPOSITION,\" as in tshan-laNthun-res \"a turn at drinking beer\"; -lugs \"method of PROPOSITION,\" as in bsam-yas bzens-lugs \"the methodof building Bsam-(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_294next page >"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"page_295file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_295.html[8/7/2010 9:54:58 PM]< previous pagepage_295next page >Page 295However, the single most important nominalizer in the classical language is the nominalizer -Pa, which is theparticle used not only for the most general and semantically neutral proposition-centered nominalization but also inthe formation of complement and relative constructions.11 Since the next several sections will deal with suchconstructions, found only with the nominalizer -Pa, we will here first review a number of other nominalizers foundin the classical texts.2.1. The NominalizersThe Tibetan nominalizers fall into two groups. Some nominalizers, including the nominalizer -Pa, yield nominals,as we might expect, expressing some aspect of the proposition as a whole: thus, for example, given rgyal-posbgegs-la mda- rgyag \"The king shot an arrow at the demon,\" we might find rgyal-pos bgegs-la mda- rgyag-pa\"the shooting of an arrow at the demon by the king,\" rgyal-pos bgegs-la mda- rgyag-sa \"the place where the kingshot an arrow at the demon,\" rgyal-pos bgegs-la mda- rgyag-grabs \"the preparation for the king to shoot anarrow at the demon,\" and so on. We will call these PROPOSITION-CENTERED NOMINALIZERS. Othernominalizers, however, yield(footnote continued from previous page)yas\"; -thabs \"opportunity for PROPOSITION,\" as in lam-la gzol-thabs \"a chance to dismount on the road\";-grabs \"preparation for PROPOSITION,\" as in nai grogs-po kun log-Ngro-grabs \"preparations for all myfriends to return.'' In all these casesand in others I have undoubtedly omittedwe find that these nominalizersalso occur as the head of nominal complementsthus not only btsas-dus ''the time of giving birth\" but alsoNgro-bai dus \"the time of going,\" not only gzol-thabs \"a chance to dismount\" but also Nbros-pai thabs \"achance to escape,\" not only dmyal-bar Ngro-ñen \"the danger of going to hell\" but also srog-la bar-tshadbyun-bai ñen \"the danger of there occurring a threat to your life,\" not only gsod-grabs \"preparation forslaughter\" but also Ngro-bai grabs \"preparation for leaving.\" In such cases we have what can be calledQUASI-NOMINALIZERSthat is, what are still clearly nominals caught in the process of becomingnominalizers.11 Perhaps the least marked use of a nominalizer is where a verb is treated as a nominal-like object forpurposes of metalinguistic citation: just as speakers of English cite verbs with the nominalizer to, and thusspeak of \"the verb to go,\" the Tibetans invariably cite verbs with the nominalizer -Pa, and thus speak of \"theverb Ngro-ba \" This is the source of the peculiar habit of listing verbs in Tibetan dictionaries as nominals: atypical doubly nominalized entry would read, for example, \"Ngro-ba, to go.\" Matisoff has noted that, as ageneral rule of thumb, applicable throughout the Tibeto-Burman family, whenever one discovers the particleused in verb citation, such as -Pa in Tibetan, one can be sure of having discovered the most importantnominalizer in the language. < previous pagepage_295next page >"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"page_296file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_296.html[8/7/2010 9:54:58 PM]< previous pagepage_296next page >Page 296nominals expressing some aspect of the patient of the underlying proposition: for example, from rgyal-pos bgegs-la mda- rgyag \"The king shot an arrow at the demon,\" we might find rgyal-pos bgegs-la mda- rgyag-go-tsog\"all the arrows the king shot at the demon,\" rgyal-pos bgegs-la mda- rgyag-Nphro \"the unused portion of thearrows the king shot at the demon,\" and so on. We will call these PATIENT-CENTERED NOMINALIZERS.Patient-centered nominalizers may seem unusual to a native speaker of English; they are, however, very commonin Tibetan.2.1.1. Patient-centered nominalizers2.1.1.1. The nominalizer -rgyu \"PATIENT OF PROPOSTION\"The nominalizer -rgyu \"PATIENT OF PROPOSITION\"apparently related to the noun rgyu \"matter, substance\"isthe most general and semantically neutral of the patient-centered nominalizers. It is interesting, therefore, tocompare it with -Pa, the most general of the proposition-centered nominalizersfor example, khrom-la khyag-pa-Ntshon \"They are selling ice in the market,\" khrom-la khyag-pa- Ntshon-ba \"the selling of ice in the market,\"khrom-la khyag-pa- Ntshoh-rgyu ''ice for sale in the market,'' and thus khrom-la khyag-pa- Ntshon-ba Ndug-gam\"Are they selling ice in the market?\" but khrom-la khyag-pa- Ntshon-rgyu Ndug-gam \"Is there ice for sale in themarket?\" or kha-tshems- bzag \"I have left a last testament,\" kha-tshems- bzag-pa \"my leaving of a lasttestament,\" kha-tshems- bzag-rgyu \"a last testament to leave,\" and thus kha-tshems- bzag-pa med \"I have not lefta last testament\" but kha-tshems- bzag-rgyu med \"I do not have a last testament to leave.\"In propositions with the equative verb YIN, the nominalizer -rgyu forms what we can call QUASI-RELATIVEconstructions, parallel to the relative constructions formed with the proposition-centered nominalizer -pathus, forexample, bla-ma on \"The lama comes,\" bla-ma on-ba \"the lama who comes,\" bla-ma on-rgyu \"the lama to come,\"and thus bla-ma on-ba yin \"The lama is/ has come\" but bla-ma on-rgyu yin \"The lama is to come,\" or, similarly,dpe-tsha nas khyod-la gton \"I am sending you a book,\" dpe-tsha nas khyod-la gton-ba \"a book which I send you,\"dpe-tsha nas khyod-la gton-rgyu \"a book for me to send you,\" and thus dpe-tsha nas khyod-la gton-ba yin \"Abook is being/has been sent you\" but dpe-tsha nas khyod-la gton-rgyu yin \"I am to send you < previous pagepage_296next page >"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"page_297file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_297.html[8/7/2010 9:54:59 PM]< previous pagepage_297next page >Page 297a book.\" Such constructions with -rgyu connote both futurity and obligation.12Where the patient participant in the proposition nominalized by -rgyu is recoverable, either from context or fromgeneral knowledge, it may, of course, be omitted, leaving a quasi-headless quasi-relative construction. Suchconstructions with -rgyu are used, like their headless relative counterparts with -Pa, to make statements aboutthings in generalfor example, na-la dgos \"I need (something)\" na-la dgos-rgyu \"(something) for me to need\" na-ladgos-rgyu tshun \"My needs are few,\" smra ''He says (something)'' smra-rgyu \"(something) for him to say\" smra-rgyu ma-byun \"There was nothing for him to say,\" lab \"You say (something)\" lab-rgyu \"(something) for you tosay\" khyod-la gan lab-rgyu yod \"What do you have to say?\" khyod-la lab-rgyu yod-dam \"Do you have anythingto say?\"2.1.1.2. The nominalizers -o-tsog/-dgu/-tshad \"ALL PATIENTS OF PROPOSITION\"The patient-centered nominalizer -o-tsog \"ALL PATIENTS OF PROPOSITION\" is closely related to the archaicplural o-tsog~-tshog as in lhao-tsog \"gods.\" The nominalizer -o-tsog first appears in the translation literatureforexample, from the Tibetan translation of the Karmasataka, bu-dan bu-mo btsao-tsog Ntshi-bar Ngyur \"All the sonsand daughters she bears will die\" (with bu-dan bu-mo btsao-tsog \"all the sons and daughters she bears\" < bu-danbu-mo btsa \"She bears sons and daughters\"), de-nas dei khyim-bdag-pai gos-dan rgyan bskon-no-tsog mi-snan-bar gyur \"Thereupon all his householder clothes and ornaments he had put on disappeared\" (with dei khyim-bdag-pai gos-dan rgyan bskon-no-tsog \"all his householder clothes and ornaments he12 We can here note an interesting fact of word order.

The nominalizer -Nphro \"REMAINDER OF PATIENT OF PROPOSITION\"The patient-centered nominalizer -Nphro (sometimes -Nphros)\"REMAINDER OF PATIENT OF PROPOSITION\"is apparently related to the verb NPHRO \"proceed, spread, continue.\" A nominal in -Nphro denotes a remaining oruncompleted or leftover portion of the patient participant in the nominalized proposition.13 We find, for example,khyod-ran-gi tsha thun \"You drank your tea\"13 Note, in the following examples, that the verb in the matrix proposition clearly refers to the PATIENT inthe embedded proposition and not to the proposition as a wholethus, for example, DZA thun-Nphros thun \"Idrank the rest of THE TEA you were drinking,\" YI-GE Nbri-Nphros mthon \"I saw an uncompletedLETTER someone was writing.\" There are, however,(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_298next page >"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"page_299file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_299.html[8/7/2010 9:55:00 PM]< previous pagepage_299next page >Page 299khyod-ran-gi tsha thun-Nphros \"the rest of the tea of yours you were drinking\" nas khyod-ran-gi tsha thun-Nphros Ndi thun-pa yin \"I drank the rest of the tea you were drinking,\"yi-ge Nbri ''(Someone) is writing aletter''yi-ge Nbri-Nphros \"part of a letter that someone is writing\" nas tsog-tsei gan-la yi-ge Nbri-Nphros gtsigmthon byun \"It happened that I saw a half-finished letter on the table,\" khon-gi khru slog \"He was ploughing hisearth\" khon-gi khru slog-Nphro \"leftover part of the earth he was ploughing\" nas kyan khon-gi khru slog-NphroNdi go-tshod-tsig byed \"And I finished off the rest of this earth of his he was ploughing,\" tshos bsgyur \"They weretranslating the dharma\" tshos bsgyur-Nphro \"the remainder of the dharma they were translating\" tshos bsgyur-Nphro-rnams bskyur \"They put aside the remainder of the dharma they were translating.\" Here, too, we find quasi-headless constructionsfor example, referring to the pulse, Nphar-Nphro tshad \"What remained of that which throbscame to an end.\"2.1.2. Proposition-centered nominalizers2.1.2.1. The nominalizer -PaThe single most important nominalizer in the classical language is the proposition-centered nominalizer -Pa, whichbecomes -pa after preceding final -g -d, -n, -b, -m, and -s, and becomes -ba after preceding final -, -r, -l, andopen syllables.14 The general nominalizer -Pa signals only that the entire proposition is functioning as a nominal,and contributes nothing further to the( footnote continued from previous page)a few instances where this interpretation does not seem to holdfor example, Ndzig-Nphro btsad \"Theystopped the rest of the destruction,\" mkhar-gyi rtsig-Nphro zog \"Put aside what is left of your building ofthe tower.\"14 In the epic of Ge-sar we find a nominalizer -le used in several songs in a way entirely parallel to that of thenominalizer -Pa found elsewhere. There is every reason to believe that this -le is a Khams dialect variant for -Pa; note the following examplesgar-byun med-pai bla-ma-zig, mthon-na dad-pa on-LE-zig mdzal-na dan-baNdren-LE-zig, gsun thos-pa-tsam-gyis grol-LE-zig \"a lama who came out of nowhere; through whom, if yousee him, faith arises; who, if you meet him, brings forth devotion; by whom, by just hearing him speak, you areliberated,\" gal-tshen don-la mnags-LE yin, ma-bsdad g.yog-po on-LE yin \"I have been sent on a matter ofgreat importance; your servant has come without delay,\" gzugs-la bzan-nan med-LE dgos, bon-la rin-thunmed-LE dgos, rgyu-la phyug-dbul med-LE dgos \"As for form, you should make no distinction of beauty; as forsize, you should make no distinction of height; as for substance, you should make no distinction of wealth.\" < previous pagepage_299next page >"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"page_300file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_300.html[8/7/2010 9:55:00 PM]< previous pagepage_300next page >Page 300reading of the propositionthus, for example, mtho-ris-la dge-slon- skye \"The monk is born in heaven\" mtho-ris-ladge-slon- skye-ba \"the birth of the monk in heaven,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad \"The Buddha taught thedharma'' sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa \"the teaching of the dharma by the Buddha,'' dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-lamtshod-pa- Nbul \"The monk gives offerings to the Buddha\" dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-la mtshod-pa- Nbul-ba\"the giving of offerings to the Buddha by the monk.\"2.1.2.2. The nominalizer -sa \"PLACE WHERE PROPOSITION\"The proposition-centered nominalizer -sa \"PLACE WHERE PROPOSITION\" is clearly related tobut is not thesame asthe noun sa \"earth, land, place.\" It is, next to -Pa, one of the most commonly encountered of thenominalizers; as illustration, note, for example, bla-ma nu \"The lama weeps\" bla-ma nu-sa \"the place where thelama weeps,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad \"The Buddha taught the dharma\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-sa \"theplace where the Buddha taught the dharma.\"Such nominals in -sa frequently function as heads of nominal phrases within source or locus participantsforexample, migzan-gyis mthon-sa-la dge-slon-gis tshos bsad \"The monk taught the dharma where others could seehim,\" where the locus participant mi gzan-gyis mthon-sa \"place where other people see\" is a nominalization of theproposition mi gzan-gyis mthon \"Other people see (something).\" Mi-la similarly nominalizes the proposition nasphyag-btsal \"I bowed down\" when he says nas phyag-btsal-sa de-la phyis phyag-Ntshal sgan-du grags \"Thatplace where I bowed downit later became known as Bowing Down Ridge.\" We find the proposition sen-gesmtshons \"The lion leaps\" nominalized in the proverb sen-ges mtshons-sa-la was mtshons rked-pa Ntshag \"The foxleaps where the lion leapsand breaks his neck.\"15The proposition-centered nominalizer -sa is also found, combined with the15 Kvaerne has published a Tibetan map which purports to show the location of various events in the lifeof the epic hero Ge-sar.

The nominalizer -grogs \"HELP WITH PROPOSITION\"The proposition-centered nominalizer -grogs \"HELP WITH PROPOSITION\" is clearly related to-but is not thesame asthe noun grogs \"friend.\"16 This nominalizer is often found in elegant or polite commands: the propositionexpressing the requested action is nominalized with -grogs \"HELP WITH PROPOSITION\" and used as the patientof the imperative stem of an elegant or honorific verbfor example, the imperative stem mdzod of the honorific verbMDZAD \"do,\" or the (irregular) imperative stem gyis of the elegant verb BGYI \"do.\" Thus, for example, Mar-pa'swife Bdag-med-ma asks her husband's disciples bla-ma rnog-pa Nkhor-btsas-kyis nai zu-ba Nbul-grogs mdzod-tsig \"Let lama Rnog-pa and his disciples help me make my request!\" and Mar-pa says elegantly to Mi-la dar-mamdo-sde Nbogs-pai mkhar-zig rtsig-grogs gyis \"Give a hand building a tower I can give to Dar-ma mdo-sde.\"2.1.2.4. The nominalizers -mkhan/-mi \"PERSON INVOLVED IN PROPOSITION\"The proposition-centered nominalizer -mkhan \"PERSON INVOLVED IN PROPOSITION\" is clearly related to thesyllabic formative -mkhan \"SKILLED IN,\" which is suffixed to nouns.17 The nominalizer -mkhan, on the otherhand,16 The nominalizer -grogs is, perhaps, more properly written -g.rogs. As early as in the Pad-ma than-yigwe find the alternative forms -rogs attested; note too the New Tibetan nominalizer -ro \"HELP WITHPROPOSITION,\" used with such elegant or honorific verbs as tsi \"do\" and nan \"bestow\"for example, NewTibetan (Lhasa) nala lapro tsi <na-la lab-rogs gyis>\"Please tell me,\" nala sunro nan <na-la gsun-rogsgnan >\"Please tell me (honorific).\"17 Note, for example, such collocations as sin \"wood\" sin-mkhan \"carpenter,\" lam \"path\"( footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_301next page >"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"page_302file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_302.html[8/7/2010 9:55:01 PM]< previous pagepage_302next page >Page 302is suffixed toand makes a nominal fromentire propositionsfor example, o-dod byas-kyan on-mkhan med \"Though Icried for help, there was no one who came.\" Thus, too, we find, in the biography of Mi-la ras-pa by Gtsan-smyonhe-ru-ka, rnog-ston tshos-rdor zer-bai ma-btsol-ba byed-mkhan khyod \"you who do what you are not told to donamed Rnog-ston tshos-rdor.\" Similarly for -mi, as in the following from the epic of Ge-sara-rog zer-mipho-rogyin, ka-kwi lan byed-mi brag-tsharyin, lus Ngro-rog byed-mi grib-ma yin \"The one who calls me old friend is thecrow; the one who answers my cry is the echo; the one who accompanies my body is my shadow.\"182.2. Nominalized Propositions as HeadsA proposition that has been nominalized with -Pa can functionjust like any nominaleither as the nominal head oras the modifier of the head. When a nominalized proposition is the head of a nominal phrase, it canjust like anynominalbe modified by further nominals, specified by determiners and quantifiers, and so on. For example, fromthe nominalization dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-la mtshod-pa- Nbul-ba \"the giving of offerings to the Buddha by themonk,\" we might find [dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-la mtshod-pa- Nbul-ba] NDI \"THIS giving of offerings to theBuddha by the monk,\" [dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-la mtshod-pa- Nbul-ba] NDI-RNAMS \"THESE givings ofofferings to the Buddha by the monk,\" [dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-la mtshod-pa- Nbul-ba] TSHEN-PO ''THEGREAT givings of offerings to the Buddha by the monk,\" [dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-la mtshod-pa- Nbul-ba]TSHEN-PO NDI-DAG KUN ''ALL THESE GREAT givings of offerings to the Buddha by the monk.\"Such a nominal phrase may then, in turn, play any participant role in the propositionfor example, the PATIENT, asin [sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]- sems-tsan-la phan \"The teaching of dharma by the Buddha brings benefit tobeings,\" dge-slon-gis [sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]- thos \"The monk heard( footnote continued from previous page)lam-mkhan \"guide,\" bzo \"handicraft\" bzo-mkhan \"craftsman.\" We also find lexicalized or semi-lexicalizedcollocations of -mkhan with a preceding verb stem, usually present tensefor example, SRUN \"protect\" srun-mkhan \"guardian,\" RTSAM \"compose, write\" rtsom-mkhan \"author,\" SAD \"kill\" gsod-mkhan \"murderer,\"SAM \"think\" sems-mkhan \"intelligent person,\" DAG \"bind\" Ndogs-mkhan \"one who binds.\" These are allapparently nominalizations of propositions which have been reduced to the event alone, withoutparticipants.18 Note the play on wordsa-rog \"old friend,\" pho-rog \"crow,\" Ngro-rog \"companion.\" < previous pagepage_302next page >"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"page_303file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_303.html[8/7/2010 9:55:02 PM]< previous pagepage_303next page >Page 303the teaching of dharma by the Buddha,\" or [sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]- bskal-pai gtsug-rgyan yin \"Theteaching of dharma by the Buddha is the diadem of the age\"; the AGENCY, as in [sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]-KYIS sems-tsan thams-tsad- sgrol \"The teaching of dharma by the Buddha saves all beings\" or [sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]-KYIS dge-slon- mya-nan-las Ndas ''The monk entered nirvana because of the teaching ofdharma by the Buddha''; the LOCUS, as in [sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]-LA sems-tsan thams-tsad- dga \"Allbeings rejoice in the teaching of dharma by the Buddha\"; the SOURCE, as in [sas-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]-NAS sems-tsan thams-tsad- Ngrol \"All beings are saved through the teaching of dharma by the Buddha\"; or theACCOMPANIMENT, as in [sans-rgyas-kyis tshos- bsad-pa]-DAN mu-stegs-pa- Ngal \"Heretics oppose theteaching of dharma by the Buddha.\"2.2.1. Multiple embeddingA proposition can contain, as one of its participants, a nominalized proposition which itself contains a nominalizedproposition as one of its participants, and so on; for example, note the following sequence of propositionsbla-mastshos bsad \"The lama taught the dharma,\" [bla-mas tshos-bsad-pa]-NAS sems-tsan grol \"Beings were savedthrough the teaching of dharma by the lama,\" [[bla-mas tshos bsad-pa]-nas sems-tsan grol-ba]-LA rgyal-po dga\"The king rejoiced at the saving of beings through the teaching of dharma by the lama,\" [[[bla-mas tshos bsad-pa]-nas sems-tsan grol-ba]-la rgyal-po dga-ba]- blon-pos mthon \"The minister saw the rejoicing of the king at thesaving of beings through the teaching of dharma by the lama,\" [[[[bla-mas tshos bsad-pa]-nas sems-tsan grol-ba]-la rgyal-po dga-ba]- blon-pos mthon-ba]-s mtshod-pa phul \"The minister gave offerings because of his seeing therejoicing of the king at the saving of beings through the teaching of dharma by the lama,\" [[[[[bla-mas tshos bsad-pa]-nas sems-tsan grol-ba]-la gyal-po dga-ba]- blon-pos mthon-ba]-s mtshod-pa phul-ba]-DAN rgyal-mo nan-pa Nkhon \"The wicked queen was distressed at the giving of offerings by the minister because of his seeing therejoicing of the king at the saving of beings through the teaching of dharma by the lama.\"When an appropriately role-marked nominalized proposition is in the setting slot of the matrix, such sequences canbe given a paratactic reading as well thus, for example, bla-mas tshos bsad-pa-NAS \"From the teaching of thedharma by the lama/After the lama taught the dharma/The lama taught the < previous pagepage_303next page >"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"page_304file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_304.html[8/7/2010 9:55:02 PM]< previous pagepage_304next page >Page 304dharma, and then ...\" dge-slon-gis tshos thos-pa-KYIS \"By the hearing of the dharma by the monk/Because themonk heard the dharma/The monk heard the dharma, and so .. .\" rgyal-po-s dgra- mthon-ba-LA \"At the seeing ofthe enemy by the king/When the king saw the enemy/The king saw the enemy, and . . .'' Such constructions areprocessed by the Tibetan reader, I believe, as at least quasi-paratactic rather than hypotactic, despite the fact thatstructurally they can be embedded several layers deep; and they are thus readand written-as if they were parallelwith conjunctionsfor example, in the Mkhas-pai mgul-rgyan mu-tig phren-mdzes by the grammarian Si-tumahapandita, the paraphrase coordination gsal-ZIN dwans-LA dri-ma med \"clear AND pure AND unsullied,\" or, inthe biography of Mi-la ras-pa by Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, the simultaneous coordinations tshos-la gtad-NAS yons\"He sought the dharma AND came,'' khru rem-NAS slog \"I exerted myself AND ploughed.\"19Nominalized propositions in the setting slot can be marked as the medium, locus, source, or accompaniment of theevent in the matrix proposition, or as an adverb which modifies that event; they can be marked as either the n-locus or source or the l- locus or source. The role particles marking such nominalized propositions then carry muchof the same meaning as when marking a simple nominalthus PROPOSITION-Pa-KYis \"by PROPSITION/becauseof PROPOSITION/PROPOSITION and so .. .\" PROPOSITION-Pa-la \"at PROPOSITION/ uponPROPOSITION/PROPOSITION and then . . .\" PROPOSITION-Pa-na \"in PROPOSITION/whilePROPOSITION/if PROPOSITION ...\" PROPOSTION-Pa-las \"out of PROPOSIION/because of PROPOSITION . ..\" PROPOSITON-Pa-nas \"from PROPOSITION/through PROPOSITION/PROPOSITION and then...\"PROPOSITION-Pa-dan \"with PROPOSITION/no sooner than PROPOSITION . . .\"19 These constructions, with role-marked nominalized propositions in the setting slot, are extremelycommon in the classical language; in fact, they are probably found more often than conjunctions. Theseconstructions are sometimes called \"continuatives,\" and are treatedand translated into Englishrather as ifthey were Sanskrit gerunds in -ya or -tva. It is true that these constructions were often used in Tibetan torender such Sanskrit gerundsfor example, from the Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita, Sanskrit catuspadikamapi githam udgrhya Tibetan tshig bzi-pai tshigs-su btsad-pa-tsam bzun-nas \"Having grasped just this four-line stanza .. .\" or, from the Abhidharmakosabhasya by Vasubandhu, Sanskrit jivita-pariskaram dattvaTibetan dge-sbyon-gi Ntsho-bai yo-byad gan yan run-ba phul-nas \"Having given the requisites which areappropriate to maintain a monk . ..\" But I am not sure that this is always a helpful characterization of theirstructure. < previous pagepage_304next page >"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"page_305file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_305.html[8/7/2010 9:55:03 PM]< previous pagepage_305next page >Page 3052.2.2.

Propositional adverbsNominalized propositions marked with the adverb particle -Tu may be found, often in the setting slot of the matrixproposition, serving to modify the matrix event in terms of time, place, manner, or extentfor example, lo man-po-zig ma-lon-par \"Before many years had passed . . .\" rgyal-po dug-gis bsad-sar \"At the place where the king hadbeen poisoned . . .\" skad-tsig kyan sdod-pai lon med-par \"Without waiting even for a moment . .\" dgon-pa de-danñe-bar \"Near to that monastery. . .''

Nominalized Propositions as ModifiersA proposition that has been nominalized with -Pa can function not only as the head of a nominal, as we havediscussed, but also as the MODIFIER of the head. There are two syntactic constructions in which we find such anominalized proposition acting as a modifier. First, in a RELATIVE construction, the nominalized propositionherecalled a relative propositioncan modify any type of nominal head; and the relative proposition is processed ashaving within it an omitted participant which is in some sense identical with the nominal head it modifies: thus, forexample, sans-rgyas mthon-bai dge-slon \"monk who saw the Buddha\" is a relative construction. Second, in aCOMPLEMENT construction, the nominalized propositionhere called a complementcan modify either verb ornominal heads, but only certain types of verbs and nominals; and the complement is not processed as having anyomitted participant coreferential with the head it modifies: thus, for example, dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas mthon-baiNbras-bu \"result of the monk's seeing the Buddha\" is a NOMINAL complement construction; and dge-slon-gissans-rgyas mthon-bar run \"It is proper for the monk to see the Buddha\" is a VERB complement construction. Thisdistinction is more easily pointed to than described; and the next several sections will try to make these syntacticconstructions clear.21 Pad-ma dkar-po offers his poem as ses-so sñam sbos-pa-tshoi Ndzu-sman \"a laxative for such bloatedthoughts\" and as khon bzan-por grags-pa-tshoi bkru-sman \"soap for those famed as virtuous.\" < previous pagepage_308next page >"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"page_309file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_309.html[8/7/2010 9:55:05 PM]< previous pagepage_309next page >Page 3092.3.1. Relative constructionsWhat makes sas-rgyas mthon-bai dge-slon \"monk who saw the Buddha\" a relative construction? The HEAD of thephrase is, clearly, dge-slon \"monk.\" The MODIFIER of this head is sans-rgyas mthon-ba, which is in turn anominalization of the proposition sans-rgyas- mthon \"(Someone) saw the Buddha,'' with the agency participantunspecified. That unspecified participant is then processed as coreferential with the head; in response to thequestion \"WHO saw the Buddha?'' the answer can only be \"The monk did.\" The reconstruction of theserelationships by the reader can be written as [(dge-slon-gis sais-rgyas- mthon)-Pa]-KYi dge-slon \"monk who sawthe Buddha,\" with the brackets identifying the embedded modifier and the strikeout indicating the deletedcoreferent.22 It is the need for such processing that makes the nominalized proposition RELATIVE to its head.Relative constructions are a characteristic and productive hypotactic device in the classical texts. Where aparatactic construction might read sans-rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs-te, dge-slon-gis mthon-zin mtshod-pa phul \"TheBuddha dwelt in the monastery AND a monk saw him AND he gave him offerings,\" a typically hypotacticconstruction would be dge-slon [sans-rgyas [dgon-pa-la bzugs-pa]- mthon-ba]-s mtshod-pa- phul \"The monkWHO saw the Buddha WHO was dwelling in the monastery gave him offerings.\" Such relative constructionsoccupy a central and distinctive place in Tibetan writing.22 We will use this notation whenever we need to indicate that an embedded participant is coreferentialwith a participant in the matrix proposition-for example, [(ba-ma s bgegs- btul)-ba]-i bla-ma \"lama whotamed the demon,\" [(bla-ma-s bgeg btul)-ba]-i bgegs \"demon whom the lama tamed,\" bla-ma-[(bla mas bgegs- btul)-ba]-r ons \"The lama came to tame the demon.\" In each of these cases, the embeddedcoreferent is deleted, along with its role particle, or replaced by a DUMMY, in the form of an indefinitedeterminer, whose only function is to carry the role particle of the deleted participant. The embeddedproposition is always the one buried inside the brackets; the more brackets there are, the more deeplyembedded the proposition. The nominal head is always coreferential with a participant in the embeddedproposition just one layer beneath it-for example, dge-slon [dge-slon sansrgyas [sans-rgyas dgon-pa-labzugs-pa]- mthon-ba]-s mtshod-pa phul, which becomes first dge-slon [dge-slon sans-rgyas [san-s rgyasdgon-pa-la bfugs-pa]- mthon-ba]-s mtshod-pa phul, and then dge-slon [dge slon. safis-rgyas [sans rgyasdgon-pa-la b;ugs-pa]- mthon-ba]-s mtshod-pa phul \"The monk who saw the Buddha who was dwelling inthe monastery gave him offerings.\" < previous pagepage_309next page >"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"page_310file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_310.html[8/7/2010 9:55:06 PM]< previous pagepage_310next page >Page 3102.3.1.1. Discursus on English relativizationTo understand Tibetan relative constructions, it may be helpful to look briefly at relative constructions in English.The English proposition The lawyer who wrote this book is handsome is actually composed of two propositions thatintersect upon the single coreferent the lawyerthatis, the main or MATRIX proposition The lawyer is handsome,and the embedded or MODIFYING proposition The lawyer wrote this book. The latter proposition isRELATIVIZEDthat is, embedded in the main proposition as the modifier of a nominal headby the following threesteps:(1) the modifying proposition is inserted in the matrix proposition immediately following the coreferentialnominal head it will modifythus The lawyer [the lawyer wrote this book] is handsome,(2) the coreferential participant is deleted from the modifying propositionthus The lawyer [the lawyer wrote thisbook] is handsome, and(3) the appropriate relative pronoun replaces the deleted coreferential participantthus The lawyer [WHO wrotethis book] is handsome.Now the nominal head in the matrix proposition can have any participant role in that proposition: it can be thesubject, as in the example above, or the object, as in I am reading the book which refutes Darwin, which, again, isbuilt from two propositions that intersect upon the single coreferent the bookthat is, the main or matrix propositionI am reading the book, and the embedded or modifying proposition The book refutes Darwin.

Relative propositions before the headA modifier of a nominal can also precede, as an adnominal, the head which it modifiesfor example, dkar-poiphren-ba \"white rosary,\" snags-pai bla-ma \"lama who is a magician.\" Similarly, a relative proposition canprecede, as an adnominal, the head which it modifiesfor example, dgon-pa-la bzugs-pai sans-rgyas ''Buddha whodwells in the monastery,\" bla-mas btul-bai bgegs \"demon which the lama tamed.\"Such adnominal relatives are derived just as we have discussed above. For example, the proposition dge-slon-gisdgon-pa-la bzugs-pai sans-rgyas bstod \"The monk praised the Buddha who dwells in the monastery\" is, again,built from two propositions that intersect upon the single coreferent sans-rgyas \"Buddha\"that is, the main or matrixproposition dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas- bstod \"The monk praised the Buddha,\" and the embedded or modifyingproposition sans-rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs \"The Buddha dwells in the monastery.\" Here, though, the modifyingproposition is inserted in the matrix BEFORE the head rather than after, and is marked with the adnominal particle,as follows:(1) the modifying proposition is nominalized with the nominalizer -Pathus [(sas-rgyas- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa],(2) this nominalized proposition is inserted in the matrix proposition immediately before sans-rgyas, thecoreferential nominal head it will modify, and is marked with the adnominal particle -KYithus dge-slon-gis[(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la bugs)-Pa]-KYi sans-rgyas- bstod,(3) the coreferential participant, along with its attached role particle, is deleted from the modifyingpropositionthus dge-slon-gis [(san -rgyas dgon-pa-la bZugs)-Pa]-KYi sans-rgyas- bstod.Under the appropriate rules of inflectional morphology, this then becomes dge-slon-gis dgon-pa-la bzugs-pai sans-rgyas bstod \"The monk praised the < previous pagepage_316next page >"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"page_317file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_317.html[8/7/2010 9:55:10 PM]< previous pagepage_317next page >Page 317Buddha who dwells in the monastery.\"Similarly, the proposition rgyal-po bla-mas btul-bai bgegs-kyis skrag \"The king was scared of the demon the lamatamed\" is, again, built from the two propositions bla-mas bgegs btul \"The lama tamed the demon\" and rgyal-pobgegs-kyis skrag \"The king was scared of the demon,'' as follows:(1) [(bla-mas bgegs- btul)-Pa],(2) rgyal-po [(bla-mas bgegs- btul)-Pa]-KYi bgegs-kyis skrag,(3) rgyal-po [(bla-mas bgegs- btul)-Pa]-KYi bgegs-kyis skrag,which becomes rgyal-po bla-mas btul-bai bgegs-kyis skrag \"The king is scared of the demon the lama tamed.\"2.3.1.4. Relativized propositions and adjectivesA proposition can, of course, consist of just an intransitive verb and its patient participantfor example, bla-maskyid \"The lama is happy,\" bla-ma nu \"The lama weeps,\" bla-ma Ngyel \"The lama falls down.\" If such aproposition is relativized, as in, say, bla-ma [(bla-ma- nu)-Pa], it behaves just as if it were an adjective. It occursin the same environment as an adjective: compare, for example, bla-ma tshen-po \"great lama\" with bla-ma skyid-pa ''happy lama,\" or dban-tsan-gyi bla-ma \"powerful lama\" with nu-bai bla-ma \"weeping lama.\" It can occur, likean adjective, as a headless modifier: compare, for example, tshen-po Ndi \"this great one\" with skyid-pa Ndi \"thishappy one,\" or dban-tsan-rnams \"powerful ones\" with Ngyel-ba-rnams \"the ones who fall down.\" It can, if itexpresses a state, occur, like an adjective, in a comparative degree: compare, for example, de-las tshen-po \"greaterthan that\" with de-las skyid-pa \"happier than that.\" It can occur, like an adjective, after an intensifier, but notbefore the conjunction -TSin: compare, for example, bla-ma sin-tu tshen-po \"very great lama\" but not ?bla-matshen-po-zin with bla-ma sin-tu nu-ba \"lama really weeping\" but not ?bla-ma nu-ba-zin.It is also possible for a proposition to consist of just a transitive verb and its patient participant, or just a transitiveverb and its agency participant, where one participant has been omitted because it is, presumably, recoverableeither from context or from general knowledgefor example, dgra-s gsod \"The < previous pagepage_317next page >"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"page_318file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_318.html[8/7/2010 9:55:10 PM]< previous pagepage_318next page >Page 318enemy kills (someone),\" dgra- gsod \"(Someone) kills the enemy.\" If such a proposition is relativized, the resultingmodifier is ambiguous: the form dgra gsod-pa could be either dgra [(dgra-s gsod)-Pa]\"the enemy who kills(someone)/the killing enemy'' or dgra [(dgra gsod)-Pa]\"the enemy whom (someone) killed/the slain enemy.\"Similarly, for example, bstod-pai rgyal-po is ambiguous between the readings [(rgyal po s bstod)-Pa]-KYi rgyal-po \"the king who praised (someone)/the praising king'' and [(rgyal-po bstod)-Pa]-KYi rgyal-po \"the king whom(someone) praised/the king who was praised.\" Yet, despite this ambiguity, the modifier still acts just like anadjective: it can be a headless modifier, as in bstod-pa Ndi \"this praising one/praised one\"; it can occur after anintensifier, but not before the conjunction -TSin, as in Sin-tu bstod-pa \"really praised/praising\" but not ?bstod-pa-zin.262.3.1.5. Dummy role particle carriersWhen an embedded coreferent in a relative proposition is deleted, its role particle is deleted along with it. In manycases, the reader is able to process the relative construction without that information: the role of the embeddedcoreferent is RECOVERABLE. This is particularly so where the embedded coreferent is the agent of the embeddedverb and the patient is explicit, or where the embedded coreferent is the patient of the embedded verb and the agentis explicit: it is clear that dgra- bsad-pai rgyal-po means \"the king who slew the enemy\" and comes from [(rgyal-po-s dgra- bsad)-Pa]KYi rgyal-po, just as it is clear that dgra-s bsad-pai rgyal-po means \"the king whom theenemy slew\" and comes from [(dgra-s rgyal po- bsad)-Pa]-KYi rgyal-po. Compare,26 Is skyid-pa \"happy\" really an adjective? Is nu-ba \"weeping,\" or Ngyel-ba \"falling down,\" or gsod-pa\"slaying/slain\"? I think we can say they are adjectives; the question is whether they are WORDS, ratherthan unlexicalized fragments of relativized propositions. I think it is fair to say that skyid-pa \"happy\" hasbeen lexicalized in classical Tibetan, and that, say, Ngyel-ba \"falling down\" and gsod-pa \"slaying/slain\"have not. A good example of such lexicalization can be found with regard to the transitive verb BRTSE\"love\"thus both sans-rgyas [(sans- rgyas kyis sems-tsan- brtse)-Pa]> sans-rgyas sems-tsan brtse-ba \"theBuddha who loves creatures\" and sans-rgyas [(sems-tsan-gyis sans rgyas brtse)-Pa]> sans-rgyas sems-tsan-gyis brtse-ba \"the Buddha whom creatures love.\" We would then expect the nominalized phrase sans-rgyas brtse-ba to be ambiguous between \"the loving Buddha\" and \"the loved Buddha,\" just as, say, rgyal-po bstod-pa is ambiguous between \"the praising king\" and \"the praised king.\" But brtse-ba is notambiguous; it always means \"loving\" rather than \"loved.\" The fragment of relativized proposition has beenlexicalized as a word with just one of its possible meanings. < previous pagepage_318next page >"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"page_319file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_319.html[8/7/2010 9:55:11 PM]< previous pagepage_319next page >Page 319similarly, sans-rgyas mthon-bai dge-slon \"monk who saw the Buddha\" with sans-rgyas-kyis mthon-bai dge-slon\"monk whom the Buddha saw,\" or bla-ma rig-snags bsgyel-ba ''lama who thwarted the magic spell'' with bla-marig-snags-kyis bsgyel-ba \"lama tripped up by the magic spell.\"27To make the role of the deleted coreferent explicit, however, a further optional step may be taken. Let us recall theanalysis of our first example, sans-rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs-pas tshos bsad \"The Buddha who dwells in themonastery taught the dharma,\" as follows:(1) the modifying proposition is nominalized with the nominalizer -Pathus [(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa],(2) this nominalized proposition is inserted in the matrix proposition immediately following sans-rgyas, thecoreferential nominal head it will modify, and, as in any Tibetan nominal phrase, before the attached roleparticlethus sans-rgyas [(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYis tshos bsad, and(3) the coreferential nominal is deleted from the modifying propositionthus sans-rgyas [(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-labzugs)-Pa]-KYis tshos bsad.28At this point an additional fourth step may be taken:27 It is when BOTH medium and patient participants are missing that the relativized proposition becomesambiguous, as noted abovefor example, bstod-pai rgyal-po \"praised/ praising king,\" dgra bsad-pa \"enemywho slew/was slain.\" Thus, too, compare, for example, lus Ndi skyed-pai pha-ma \"parents WHO bore thisbody\" with lus Nd skyes-pai pha-ma \"parents FROM WHOM this body was born,\" or sprin-dkar ñi-ma mi-sgribs-pa \"white clouds WHICH did not block the sun\" with sprin-dkar ñi-ma mi-Ngribs-pa \"white cloudsBY WHICH the sun was not blocked.\"28 Here we are making explicit the intermediate step we skipped over in the description above: the coreferentnominal is deleted, leaving its role particle hanging in the air, as in dge-slon [(dge slon-KYis mtshod-pa phul)-Pa]-s sans-rgyas mthon \"The monk who gave offerings saw the Buddha.\" Here, instead of using theproposition as is, with the rules of inflectional morphology automatically deleting the hanging role particle, anindefinite determiner will be placed in the now empty slot as a dummy to carry the hanging role particle, as indge-sloni [(GANi-KYis mtshod-pa phul)-Pa]-s sans-rgyas mthon, which yields dge-slon gan-gis mtshod-paphul-bas sans-rgyas mthon \"The monki WHOi gave offerings saw the Buddha.\" < previous pagepage_319next page >"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"page_320file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_320.html[8/7/2010 9:55:12 PM]< previous pagepage_320next page >Page 320(4) an appropriate indefinite determiner is inserted as a DUMMY to carry the role particle of the deletedcoreferential participantthus sans-rgyasi [(GANi- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYis tshos bad,which yields, after the application of the inflectional rules, sas-rgyasi GANi-dgon-pa-la bugs-pas tshos bsad\"The Buddhai WHOi dwells in the monastery taught the dharma.\" Such an additional step would not usually betaken when the embedded participant was the patient, as in the present example; but, as the role of the missingparticipant becomes more oblique and difficult to recover, the use of such a dummy role particle carrier becomesmore frequentfor example, rnal-Nbyor-pa nags-tshali GANi-LA me-tog bkra-ba-la bzugs \"The yogin dwells inwoodsi IN WHICHi flowers bloom,\" analyzed as follows:(1) [(nags-tshal-la me-tog bkra)-Pa],(2) mal-Nbyor-pa nags-tshal [(nags-tshal-la me-tog bkra)-Pa]-la bzugs,(3) mal-Nbyor-pa nags-tshal [(nags tshal-la me-tog bkra)-Pa]-la bzugs,(4) mal-Nbyor-pa nags-tshali [(GANi-la me-tog bkra)-Pa]-la bzugs,or nam-mkhai GANi-LAS kha Nbab-pa-la sprin nag-po Nthibs \"Black clouds gather in the skyi FROM WHICHisnow falls,\" analyzed as follows:(1) [(nam-mkha-las kha Nbab)-Pa],(2) nam-mkha [(nam-mkha-las kha Nbab)-Pa]-la sprin nag-po Nthibs,(3) nam-mkha [(nam-mkha-las kha Nbab)-Pa]-la sprin nag-po Nthibs,(4) nam-mkhai [(GANi-las kha Nbab)-Pa]-la sprin nag-po Nthibs.There are apparently several factors that determine the likelihood that a dummy role particle carrier will be used.29First is the relative ACCESSIBILITY29 It must be clearly borne in mind that the indefinite determiner in this construction is not a delimiter of apreceding head, but rather a coreferential pro-form for that head. For example, the proposition nam-mkhagan-las kha Nbab-pa-la sprin nag-po Nhibs \"Black clouds gather in the sky from which snow falls\" cannotbe parsed as beginning with (nam-mkha(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_320next page >"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"page_321file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_321.html[8/7/2010 9:55:12 PM]< previous pagepage_321next page >Page 321of the role of the deleted participant: the more accessible the role, the less likely it is to be carried by a dummyindefinite determiner. In fact, there appears to be a fairly regular hierarchy of accessibility, with an agent mostaccessible, patient next most accessible, and the various oblique roleslocus, source, instrumentleast accessible andtherefore most likely to be carried by an indefinite determiner.30 Second, it seems that a relative that PRECEDES(footnote continued from previous page)gan)-las . . . \"From some sky. . .\" but only as nam-kha (gan-las .. .) \"The sky from which . .\" But, in anyparticular construction, how can you tell whether the indefinite determiner is a delimiter or a dummy roleparticle? The primary clue is the presence of -Pa immediately after the verb stem, as opposed to aconjunction, or a locus or source particle without a nominalizing -Pa between it and the verb stem-thus, forexample, skye-bo gan-gis sans-rgyas mthon-TE or skye-bo gan-gis sans-rgyas mthon-NA must be read as(skye-bo gan)-gis ... and thus, respectively, as ''SOME PERSON sees the Buddha and . . .\" and \"If/whenSOME PERSON sees the Buddha . . .'' while skye-bo gan-gis sans-rgyas mthon-BA must be read as skye-bo (gan-gis . . .) and thus as \"a PERSON WHO sees the Buddha.\"There is ambiguity really only in two circumstances. First, the syllable following the verb stem may have beenelided for metrical reasons; for example, in the Tibetan translation of the Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita wefind Sanskrit ye rnam rupena cadraksur na rnam draksyanti te janah Tibetan gan-dag na-la gzugs-su mthon,skye-bo de-dag na mi-thon, which can be read, on the one hand, as \"If/when ANY look upon me as form,those persons do not see me\" or \"SOME look upon me as form, and those persons do not see me,\" or, on theother hand, as \"PERSONS WHO look upon me as form do not see me.\" In this case, we can guess from theSanskrit that the relative reading was intended, but the structure of the Tibetan itself remains ambiguous.Second, where the head can be read as referring to a LOCATION, in either space or time, a construction witha locus or source particle becomes ambiguous; for example, gnas gan-la bzugs-na can be read either as (gnasgan)-la . . . \"If/when he lives SOME PLACE . .\" or as gnas (gan-la . . .)\"the PLACE WHERE he lives.\" Ofcourse, this second source of ambiguity is not found where the verb stem is followed by a conjunction; theexpression gnas gan-la bzugs-te can be read only as \"He lives SOME PLACE, and . . .\" Neither of these twotypes of ambiguity would appear to be particularly troubling.30 Of these oblique roles, the locus seems generally most accessible; for example, the propositions me Nbar-bai khan-pa \"house IN WHICH fire burns,\" sgom ma-dgos-pai lam \"path ON WHICH meditation is notnecessary\" are not difficult to process. The adnominal role is the least accessible, and the adnominal roleparticle MUST be carried by a dummy role particle carrier, at least when the relativized proposition precedesthe head it modifiesthus, for example, [(GANi-gi drin-gyis bdag sgrol)-ba]-i bla-ma tshen-poi-i zabs-la Ndud\"I bow to the feet of the great lamai WHOSEi grace rescues me,\" but not ?[(bla ma tshen po i dringyis bdagsgrol)-ba]-i bla-ma tshen-poi zabs-la Ndud, although both bla-ma tshen-poi [(GANi -gi drin-gyis . . . \"Greatlama whose grace . . .\" and bla-ma tshen-po [(bla .ma tshen po i drin-gyis . . . \"Great lama whose grace . . .\"appear possible. < previous pagepage_321next page >"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"page_322file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_322.html[8/7/2010 9:55:13 PM]< previous pagepage_322next page >Page 322its head is more likely to contain a dummy role particle carrier than one that follows its head. There are probablygood processing reasons for this: among other things, the indefinite determiner in this position can both alert thereader that the proposition currently being processed is relative to an as yet unknown head, and serve as a place-holder for that head in short-term memory. Finally, since this construction appears similar to the relativeconstruction in Sanskritrelative pronouns in Sanskrit are also basically dummy case-holders, and this constructionseems to have first appeared in Tibet in the translation literature31its use can signal an ornate and31 See, for example, in the translation of the Saddharma-pundarika, Sanskrit iryapatham yo rnamaraksamano bhaveta bhiksu rnama nirvrtasya prakasayet sutram idam hi loke na capi samliyana tasya kacitTibetan na ni mya-nan-Ndas-nas dge-sloni [(GANi- na-yi spyod-yul Ndini rab-srun-zin de ni nam yanzum-pa med)-pa]-yis Ndzig-rten-du yan mdo Ndi rab-sod-tsig \"After I have passed into nirvana, let themonki WHOi keeps my rules of conduct and is ever unwearied therein preach this scripture even in theworld.\" Note, too, in the later translation period, from the Prajñapradipatika of Avalokitavrata, dgag-pai[(GANi- don-gyis go-ba ston) -Pa]- . . . de ni ma-yin-par dgag-pa yin \"A negationi WHICHi states animplication . . . is aterm negation,\" gzan-gyis khas-blans-pai [(GANi- yod)-pa] de dgag-pa byed \"Hedenies any counter-assertioni WHICHi one has.\"I think it is clear that the use of indefinite determiners as dummy role particle carriers, although a perfectlyTibetan construction, became wide-spread in Tibetan through imitation of relative constructions in Sanskrit. InSanskrit, the relativized proposition usually precedes its matrix, and sometimes follows it, but almost neverappears within it. Interestingly, when the relativized proposition precedes the matrix, the head which it modifiescan be moved out of the matrix to the immediate right of the relative pronoun, and the relative pronoun isnormally echoed in the matrix by a demonstrative pronounusually sahas its \"correlative,\" most often placed ator near the beginning of the matrixthus both yah katam karoti, sah purusah devadattah nama and yah purusahkatam karoti, sah devadattah nama, but only sah purusah devadattah nama, yah katam karoti \"The personWHO makes the mat is named Devadatta.\" Note, for example, with the relative preceding the matrix, canakya-candraguptayoh puskalt karanad yo vislesa utpadyate, sa atyantiko bhavati \"The estrangement betweenCanakya and Candragupta WHICH arises from a strong cause is lasting\"; and, with the relative following thematrix, krtapunya eva nandano, yah priyam idrsim kamayisyati \"Really lucky is Nandana WHO will love sucha beloved,'' taya gava kim kriyate, ya na dogdhri \"What is done with the cow WHICH is not a yielder of milk?''As a matter of fact, there seems to have been some confusion at first about the proper translation of Sanskritrelatives, and some uncertainty about the use of this dummy construction. We find extra dummy role particlecarriersfor example, in the translation of the Saddharmapundarika, Sanskrit ya nirvrtim gavesanti drste dharmeupasikah \"Pious laywomeni WHOi in this life seek nirvana\" but Tibetan dge-bsñen-mai [(GANi- tshe Ndi-la(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_322next page >"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"page_323file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_323.html[8/7/2010 9:55:13 PM]< previous pagepage_323next page >Page 323Sanskritized literary register.

We find, conversely, double-headed constructionsfor example, in thetranslation of the Madhyamikakarika of Nagarjuna, Sanskrit yasminn eva ksane padartho jayate tasminneva tisthati vinasyati \"At just that momenti WHENi a thing arises, it also abides and disappears\" butTibetan skad-tsigi [(GANi kho-na-la dnos-po skyespar gyur-pa]-i skad-tsigi de kho-na-la gnas-pa-danNdzig-pa yin-no. And, sometimes, misguided attempts to translate Sanskrit verse line by line make a hashout of its relative propositions for example, in the translation of the Saddharmapwunarika again, Sanskritya bodhisattva icchey . .. / ida sutram prakasetum . . . / asamsrstah sucir bhavet \"A bodhisattvai WHOimight wish ... to teach this scripture... should be undefiled and pure\" but Tibetan mdosde Ndi ni bstan-paryan, byan-tshub sems-dpai [(GANi Ndod)-pa]-. . . .Ndu-Ndzi med-la gtsan-bar bya, instead of byan-tshubsems-dpai [(GANi- mdo-sde Ndi ni bstan-par Ndod)-pa]- Ndu-Ndzi med-la gtsan-bar bya.32 And, of course, there are simply the intangibles of style and personal preference. Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, inhis biography of Mi-la ras-pa, happily deletes coreferents in oblique roles without providing a dummy rolecarrierfor example, [(bde ba s lus-la ba-spu kun g.yo)-ba]-i bde-ba \"Joy FROM WHICH all the hairs on mybody stood on end,\" [(dban yon gyis dban-gral-la sdud)-pa]-i dban yon \"Initiation fee WHEREBY you standin the initiation line,\" [(mos gus las mtshi-ma Nkhrug)-pa]-i mos-gus \"Faith FROM WHICH tears flowed.\"Sa-skya pandita, on the other hand, was fond of dummy role particle carriers, in all likelihood for metricalreasons alone, since he often used them where the deleted coreferent was a perfectly accessible agentparticipant, and where the meter forced the omission of the role particle -KYis in any eventfor example,mii[(GANi mdza-ba mi-brten)-pa] de-dan Ngrogs-par su-zig nus \"Who can be friends with a mani WHOidoes not support his friends?\" mii[(GANi byas-pa mi-gzo)-ba] de- ni gzan-las ran-la gnod \"A mani WHOi isnot grateful harmshimself more than others,\" andmii [(GANi skye-bo dam-pa-dan dman-pai khyad-par legs-ses-nas de-yi bya-ba bsgrub ses)-pa]-phun-sum tshogs-pai gzi-tshen yinA mani WHOi well knows the difference between noble and base, and knows how to accomplish his deeds, is the foundation of excellence.Note also [(GANi-zig nor-Ndod)] skye-boi kyan, thos ñid gtso-bor bsrun-bar bya \"Even a personi WHOidesires wealth should especially guard the dharma,\" where Ndod-pai has beenreduced to Ndod for reasons ofmeter. < previous pagepage_323next page >"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"page_324file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_324.html[8/7/2010 9:55:14 PM]< previous pagepage_324next page >Page 324Although we have been using the indefinite determiner gan in our examples so far, any appropriate indefinitedeterminer can be used as a dummy carrier for the role particle of a deleted coreferentthus not only, say, mi Ndzig-pai tshosi [(GANi- Ndzig-par mi-Ngyur)-ba] Nga- yod-dam \"Is there some unperishing dharmai WHICHi willnot perish?\" but also, for example, nas rgya-poi[(SUi-la bu yod)-pa] de- bsten \"I will serve the kingi WHOi hasa son,\"khyodi[(SUi- Ngro)-ba]-dag- Ngrogs \"Youi WHOi are going are assembled,\" bdag-gis mthui [(DZIiyod)-pa]-s rgya-mtshoi tshu btsus ''I scooped the water of the sea with the strengthi WHICHi I had.\" This is trueas well where the relativizedproposition precedes the headthus not only, say, [(bde-gsegs- GANi-du sen-ge Ita-bur gzims)-pa]-yi gnasi de-la phyag-Ntshal ''I bow to that placei WHEREi the Well-Gone One slept like a lion,\"but also, for example, [(ston-par NAMi thim)pa]-yi bar-doi-la Ndzigs-pa-las skyob \"He protects from the terrorsin theintermediate statei WHENi one dissolves into emptiness.\"Indefinite adverbs can also occur in relative propositions.

States and processesIn an ADJECTIVE EQUATION, such as bla-ma rgan-po yin \"The lama is old/an old one,\" the adjective is read asa headless modifier: that is, the adjective rgan-po \"old\" is processed as the modifier of a redundant or recoverablehead bla-ma \"lama\" which has been omitted under the Telegram Principle. We have also already noted a tendencyfor such adjectives to be related to intransitive verbsfor example, MAN ''be many\" man-po ''many,\" DKA \"bedifficult\" dka-bo \"difficult,\" SKYO \"be weary\" skyo-mo \"weary,\" TSHE \"be great\" tshen-po \"great,\" RGA \"be old\"rgan-po \"old.\" Thus a writer can often choose between a verbal construction and an adjective equationbetweenbla-ma tshe and bla-ma tshen-po yin \"The lama is great,\" between dge-slon skyo and dge-slon skyo-mo yin \"Themonk is weary,\" and between sems-tsan man and sems-tsan man-po yin \"Sentient creatures are many.\"Now such intransitive verbs in Tibetan actually express what are both states and processesthus bla-ma rga \"Thelama is/grows old,\" rgyal-po skyo \"The king is/grows weary,\" na-rgyal tshe \"His pride is/grows great.\" Thus thechoice of an adjective equation serves to specify that the attribution is not a process but a statefor example, bla-margan-po yin \"The lama is old/an old one,\" rgyal-po skyo-mo yin \"The king is weary/a weary one,\" na-rgyal tshen-po yin \"His pride is great/a great one.\" When a writer thus chooses an adjective equation he specifies the attributionas in some sense abiding or chronic; when he chooses the corresponding intransitive verb construction he does notso specify, and the attribution may in fact be temporary or acute.The same choice obtains between an equation with a headless relative and the corresponding verb construction: forexample, tshos-rgyud Ndis sems-tsan- sgrol \"This religious tradition saves beings\" states only that an eventoccurs; but tshos-rgyud Ndi-[sems-tsan- sgrol-ba]- yin \"This religious tradition is one which saves beings\"implies that the ability to save beings is inherent to the tradition, that it saves beings more or less regularly, that it isthe sort of tradition whereby beings are usually saved. Similarly, rgyal-pos tshan- Nthun \"The king drinks beer\"states only that a particular event occurs; but rgyal-po-[tshan- Nhun-ba]- yin \"The king is one who drinks beer\"implies that the king is a beer-drinking person, that he drinks beer more or less regularly, that he is the sort ofperson who drinks beer.Thus Mi-la ras-pa describes himself like thisgdon-bgegs-rnams-kyi sa za khrag Nthun-ba yin \"I am one who eatsthe flesh and drinks the blood of < previous pagepage_327next page >"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"page_328file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_328.html[8/7/2010 9:55:16 PM]< previous pagepage_328next page >Page 328demons!\" Mar-pa's wife says of her husband, sku mdun-du khyi-zig byun-run tshos gsuun-zin mdug brno-basbsdud-pa-zig Ndug-pa yin \"He is one who teaches dharma though it be a dog before him, and ends up by giving ithis merit.\" And Pad-ma dkar-po describes the sort of person he isna de-phyir ses-nas Ntshad-pa yin, gnan-bathob-nas rtsom-pa yin, log-smra Ndug-nas rtsod-pa yin \"When I know something, I teach it; when I receivesomething given me, I write it down; when there is a mistake, I argue with it.''< previous pagepage_328next page >"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"page_329file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_329.html[8/7/2010 9:55:17 PM]< previous pagepage_329next page >Page 329That is to get water and pay back beer; that is to get evil and return good.2.3.1.8. Multiple embeddingIt should be clear that a matrix proposition containing an embedded proposition can itself be relativized andembedded within yet another proposition: for example, the proposition sans-rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs \"The Buddhadwells in the monastery\" can be relativized to modify the nominal head sans-rgyas \"Buddha\" in the propositiondge-slon-gis sans-rgyas mthon \"The monk saw the Buddha,\" which in turn can be relativized to modify thenominal head dge-slon \"monk'' in the proposition dge-slon-gis thos bstod \"The monk praised the dharma.'' Thismultiple embedding can take place in two ways: the term SELF-EMBEDDING will refer to the insertion of themodifying proposition AFTER the nominal head it modifies; the term LEFT-BRANCHING will refer to theinsertion of the modifying proposition as an adnominal BEFORE the nominal head it modifies.36 If the threepropositions are self-embedded, the result is:36 Self-embedding can, theoretically, go on without limit; but it is clear that excessive selfembedding putstoo great a strain on the unaided memory. In English, for example, it is syntactically possible to say thecheese that the rat that the cat that the dog bit chased atethat is, the cheese [the rat [the cat [the dog bit thecat] chased the rat] ate the cheese]-but it is neither a likely nor an easily understood utterance. We aremuch more likely to say the dog that bit the cat that chased the rat that ate the cheesethat is, the dog [thedog bit the cat [the cat chased the rat [the rat ate the cheese]]].Such a right-branching construction couldeasily go on indefinitely.The choice between a self-embedded or branching construction is a choice of literary style. The followingsentence from Joseph Conrad's The Secret Sharer is largely right-branching:I was in time to catch an evanescent glimpse of my white hat left behind to mark the spot where the secretsharer of my cabin and of my thoughts, as though he were my second self, had lowered himself in thewater to take his punishment. . .Henry James, on the other hand, is characteristically self-embedding; the following sentence from The Portraitof a Lady is probably more difficult to process than the sentence above:His companion, measuring the length of the lawn beside him, was a person of quite another pattern, who,although he might have excited grave curio-(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_329next page >"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"page_330file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_330.html[8/7/2010 9:55:17 PM]< previous pagepage_330next page >Page 330(1) (a) [(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]and(b) [(dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas- mthon)-Pa],(2) dge-slon [(dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas [(sans-rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs)Pa]- mthon)-Pa]-KYis tshos bstod,(3) (a) dge-slon [(dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas [(sans- rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]- mthon)Pa]-KYis tshosbstod, and then(b) dge-slon [(dge slon gis sans-rgyas [(sans rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]- mthon)-Pa]-KYis tshosbstod,which becomes dge-slon sans-rgyas dgon-pa-la bzugs-pa mthon-bas tshos bstod \"The monk who saw the Buddhawho dwells in the monastery praised the dharma.\" If the three propositions are left-branching, the result is(1) (a) [(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]and(b) [(dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas- mthon)-Pa],(2) [[(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-mthon)-Pa]-KYi dge-slon-gistshos bstod,(3) (a) [[(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la btugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis sansrgyas- mthon)-Pa]-KYi dge-slon-gistshos bstod, and then(b) [[(sans-rgyas- dgon-pa-la b;ugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge sloh-gis sansrgyas- mthon)-Pa]-KYi dge-slon-gistshos bstod,which becomes dgon-pa-la bzugs-pai sans-rgyas mthon-pai dge-slon-gis tshos bstod \"The monk who saw theBuddha who dwells in the monastery praised the dharma.\"(footnote continued from previous page)sity, would not, like the other, have provoked you to wish yourself, almost blindly, in his place.In Tibetan, the alternative to self-embedding is not right-branching, as in English, but rather LEFT-BRANCHING. This is why native speakers of English tend to feel that classical Tibetan is somehowbackwards. In a right-branching construction, the head is presented before its modifiers; in a left-branchingconstruction, the modifiers are presented before their head. I will leave it to others to speculate as to how thisrelates either to culture or to psychology. < previous pagepage_330next page >"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"page_331file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_331.html[8/7/2010 9:55:18 PM]< previous pagepage_331next page >Page 331Similarly, the proposition sans-rgyas-kyis mtshod-pa dge-slon dgon-pa-la bzugs-pas phul-ba bzes \"The Buddhaaccepted the offering which the monk who dwells in the monastery gave\" consists of the three propositions sans-rgyas-kyis mtshod-pa bzes \"The Buddha accepted the offering,\" dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa phul \"The monk gave theoffering,\" and dge-slon dgon-pa-la bzugs ''The monk dwells in the monastery\" in the following SELF-EMBEDDED form:(1) (a) [(dge-slon- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]and (b) [(dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa],(2) sans-rgyas-kyis mtshod-pa [(dge-slon [(dge-slon dgon-pa-la bzugs)Pa]-KYis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-bzes,(3) (a) sans-rgyas-kyis mtshod-pa [(dge-slon [(dge slon dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-bzes, and then(b) sans-rgyas-kyis mtshod-pa [(dge-slon [(dge slon dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYis mtshod pa phul)-Pa]-bzes,and the proposition sans-rgyas-kyis dgon-pa-la bzugs-pai dge-slon-gis phul-bai mtshod-pa bzes \"The Buddhaaccepted the offering which the monk who dwells in the monastery gave\" consists of the same three propositions inthe following LEFT-BRANCHING form:(1) (a) [(dge-slon- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]and(b) [(dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa],(2) sans-rgyas-kyis [[(dge-slon- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-KYimtshod-pa bzes,(3) (a) sans-rgyas-kyis [[(dge-slon dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-KYimtshod-pa bzes, and then(b) sans-rgyas-kyis [[(dge-slon dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa phul)-Pa]-KYimtshod-pa bzes.In such a left-branching proposition, too, we find all the modified nominal heads moved as far to the left aspossible, to make the leftward branching both clearer and more symmetrical: thus, instead of sans-rgyas-kyis dgon-pa-la < previous pagepage_331next page >"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"page_332file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_332.html[8/7/2010 9:55:19 PM]< previous pagepage_332next page >Page 332bzugs-pai dge-slon-gis phul-bai mtshod-pa bzes, we might find dgon-pa-la bzugs-pai dge-sloi-gis phul-baimtshod-pa sans-rgyas-kyis bes \"The Buddha accepted the offering which the monk who dwells in the monasterygave,\" as follows:(1) (a) [(dge-slon- dgon-pa-la bugs)-Pa]and (b) [(dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa],(2) (a) sans-rgyas-kyis [[(dge-slon- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-KYimtshod-pa bzes,(b) [[(dge-slon- dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-KYi mtshod-pa sans-rgyas-kyis bzes,(3) (a) [[(dge slon dgon-pa-la bzugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-KYi mtshod-pa sans-rgyas-kyis bzes,(b) [[(dge-slon dgon-pa-la bZugs)-Pa]-KYi (dge-slon-gis mtshod-pa- phul)-Pa]-KYi mtshod-pa sans-rgyas-kyis bzes.2.3.1.9.

Complex relativized propositionsConjoined propositions are themselves propositions which can be relativized to modify a nominal headthus, forexample, with -KYan \"BUT,\" med-kyan dgos-pai khral-bsdud \"tax which is necessary though one does not haveit,\" or, as the title of a political tract by Kun-bzan dpal-Nbyor, bsregs-kyan mi-Ntshigs-pai bod \"Tibetburned butnot consumed\"; with -Am \"OR,\" tshos thos-sam bsams-sam bsgoms-pai sems-tsan \"creatures who have heard orpondered or contemplated the dharma,'' or sans-rgyas tshos bsad-dam ma-bsad-pa ''the Buddha, whether he hastaught the dharma or not\"; with -STe \"AND,\" gos bkrus-te dag-pa \"clothes that have been washed and are pure\";and with -TSin \"AND,\" Ndre sa-la za-zin khra-la Nthun-ba \"demons who feed on flesh and gorge on blood,\"Ndzig-rten-gyi khams dpag-tu med-tsin grans med-pa-dag \"worldly realms which are measureless and withoutnumber,\" or even slob-ma dbus-gtsan-nas yon-gin yod-pa \"disciples who are coming from Dbus and Gtsang.\"Similarly, propositions containing a nominalized proposition in the setting slot can also be relativized to modify anominal headfor example, tshan phan-la zim-pa \"beer which is refreshing and tasty,\" mthon-na sgrol-bai bla-ma\"a lama who frees you if you but see him.\" These last constructions strike me as being very Tibetan.2.3.2. Complement constructionsIn a complement construction, certain verb or nominal heads are modified by a nominalized proposition, called aCOMPLEMENT, which is not relative to the head it modifies. In a NOMINAL complement construction, thecomplement ADNOMINALLY modifies certain types of noun headthus, for example, sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-PAI tshe \"the time THAT the Buddha taught the dharma.\" In a VERB complement construction, the complementADVERBALLY modifies certain types of verb headthus, for example, sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-PAR grags \"It iswell known THAT the Buddha taught the dharma.\" < previous pagepage_334next page >"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"page_335file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_335.html[8/7/2010 9:55:20 PM]< previous pagepage_335next page >Page 3352.3.2.1. Complement headsOne of the distinguishing features of complement constructionsas opposed to relative constructionsis that thecomplement can occur only with certain verb or nominal heads. (A relative, on the other hand, can occur with anynominal head.) NOMINAL complement heads are always ABSTRACT NOUNS for example, don \"purpose,\" tshul\"way,\" tshe \"time,'' as in sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-pai DON \"the PURPOSE of Buddha having taught thedharma,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-pai TSHUL ''the WAY that the Buddha taught the dharma,\" sans-rgyas-kyistshos bsad-pai TSHE \"the TIME that the Buddha taught the dharma.\"38 VERB complement heads are verbs thatcan occur with an ABSTRACT PATIENT-for example, DKA \"be difficult\" (thus both tshos dka \"The dharma isdifficult\" and dge-slon-gis tshos bsad-par dka \"It is difficult for the monk to teach the dharma\"), ÑAN \"hear\" (thusboth tshos ñan \"He heard the dharma\" and dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-par ñan \"He heard that theBuddha taught the dharma\").392.3.2.2. Nominal complementsIn a nominal complement construction, a nominalized proposition adnominally modifies a nominal head that is notcoreferential with any participant in the embedded proposition.40 For example, given the proposition sans-rgyas-38 Other typical nominal complement heads include skabs \"occasion,\" rgyu \"cause,\" mtha \"end,\" mtshan-ñid \"sign,\" Nbras-bu \"effect,\" thabs \"means,\" phan \"benefit,\" rgyu-mtshan \"reason,\" bden-pa \"truth,\" rdzun\"falsehood,\" Ndod-pa \"opinion,\" bzed-pa \"contention,\" Itaba \"doctrine,\" Ndu-ses \"concept,\" dmigs-pa\"idea,\" lo-rgyus \"history,\" sgruns \"tale,\" and so on.39 Verb and nominal complement constructions are interestingly parallel in Tibetan, just as adverbs andadnominals are interestingly parallel-thus mgyogs-poi rta \"fast horse\" is to mgyogs-por rgyug \"runs fast\" as rtargyugs-pai rgyu \"the reason the horse runs fast\" is to rta rgyugs-par mthon \"He sees that the horse runs fast.\"In fact, many of the verbs that take verb complements become, when nominalized with -Pa, nominals that takenominal complementsfor example, bla-ma Ngro-bar dgos \"It is necessary for the lama to go\" bla-ma Ngro-baidgos-pa \"the necessity that the lama go,\" bla-ma Ngro-bar dmigs \"He visualizes that the lama goes\" bla-maNgro-bai dmigs-pa \"the visualization that the lama goes,\" bla-ma Ngro-bar re \"He hopes that the lama goes\"bla-ma Ngro-bai re-ba \"the hope that the lama goes.\"40 All nominal complement constructions and many relative constructions consist of a(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_335next page >"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"page_336file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_336.html[8/7/2010 9:55:21 PM]< previous pagepage_336next page >Page 336kyis tshos bsad \"The Buddha taught the dharma,\" we might find such nominal complement constructions as sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-pai tshul \"the way that the Buddha taught the dharma,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-paiNbras-bu \"the result of the Buddha having taught the dharma,'' sas-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-pai lo-rgyus \"the historyof the Buddha having taught the dharma, sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-pai bzed-pa ''the assertion that the Buddhataught the dharma.\"Such nominal phrases may then, of course, play any participant role in the proposition-for example, sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-pai dus- Nbab \"The time for the Buddha to teach the dharma has come,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshosbsad-pai tshe-LA bslebs \"He arrived at the time that the Buddha was teaching the dharma,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshosbsad-pai Ita-ba-LAS Idog \"He is opposed to the doctrine that the Buddha taught the dharma,\" sans-rgyas-kyistshos bsad-pai Nbras-bu-DAN Idan \"He is endowed with the result of the Buddha's teaching of the dharma,\" sans-rgyas-kyis tshos bsad-pai bden-pa-s bgegs kun zi-bar sog \"By the truth that the Buddha taught the dharma may allhindering demons be calmed!\"(footnote continued from previous page)nominalized proposition adnominally modifying a following nominal head. The difference is this: a relativeproposition is processed as having some omitted participant coreferential with the head it modifies-thus dgesloi gi sans-rgyas- mthon-bai dge-slon \"monk who sees the Buddha,\" sans-rgyas-kyis dge slon- mthon-bai dge-slon \"monk whom the Buddha sees\"; a complement proposition is not processed as having anyomitted participant coreferential with the head it modifies-thus dge-slon-gis sans-rgyas- mthon-baimtshan-ñid \"the sign that the monk sees the Buddha,\" sans-rgyas-kyis dge-slon- mthon-bai mtshan-ñid\"the sign that the Buddha sees the monk.\"Moreover, the head of a relative may be either an abstract or concrete noun, while the head of a nominalcomplement is always an abstract noun. Thus, where the head of a propositional modifier is a concrete noun,the modifier must generally be processed as a relative, no matter how oblique the resulting readingthus notonly ñi-ma sgrib-pai sprin \"clouds WHICH darken the sun\" but also ñi-ma Ngrib-pai sprin \"cloudsWHEREBY the sun grows dark,\" and not only lus Ndi skyed-pai pha-ma \"parents WHO bore this body\" butalso lus Ndi skyespai pha-ma \"parents FROM WHOM this body was born.\"But where the head is an abstract noun, the modifying proposition must be scanned for missing participants:where none are found, the sequence is read as a complement construction; where a participant is missing fromthe modifying proposition, the construction is ambiguous between relative and complement readings. Thus asequence such as sans-rgyas-kyis bsad-pai bden-pa is ambiguous between the relative reading \"the truth whichthe Buddha teaches\" and the complement reading \"the truth that the Buddha teaches (something).\" < previous pagepage_336next page >"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"page_337file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_337.html[8/7/2010 9:55:22 PM]< previous pagepage_337next page >Page 337Such nominal complement constructions are frequently found with a temporal noun as the head, used in the settingslot of a propositionfor example, na gro-bo lun-la sleb-pai do-nub-la \"On the eve of my arriving in Red Valley . ..\" de-dan mdzal-bai tho-rans-la \"On the morning that I met him. . .\" tshos bsad-pai mthar \"After he had taught thedharma . . .'' Two idioms may be noted here as well. The word nan \"nature, character,\" as head of a complementconstruction, can be used in the setting slot to indicate a mood or state of mind out of which the event occursforexample, thugs dgyes-sin spro-ba-zig byun-bai nan-nas, yum tsha-ba Ndren ''With glad and joyous thoughtsarising, the Lady brought warm food,\" thugs-rgyal tshun-zad Nkhruns-pai nan-nas mnal sad \"She woke up withher pride growing a little.\" The word sgo \"gate, door,\" as head of a complement construction, can be used in thesetting slot to indicate the means whereby or the source from which the event occurs-for example, rgyal-pos sasbyin-pai sgo-nas phug-ron-gyi srog blus \"Through giving his flesh, the king ransomed the life of the dove.\"2.3.2.3. Verb complementsIn a verb complement construction, a nominalized proposition adverbally modifies a verb head.41 For example,given the proposition bla-mas bgegs btul \"The lama tamed the demon,\" we might find such verb complementconstructions as bla-mas bgegs btul-bar rmis \"He dreamed that the lama tamed the demon,\" bla-mas bgegs btul-bar grags \"It is well-known that the lama tamed the demon,\" bla-mas bgegs btul-bar bzed \"He maintains that thelama tamed the demon.\"Since every proposition nominalized with -Pa is abstract, every verb that can occur with such a nominalizedproposition as its PATIENT can also occur with such a nominalized proposition as its COMPLEMENT.Sometimes this does not41 A verb complement construction thus differs from a nominalized proposition simply used as an adverb,usually in the setting slot. Compare, for example, the use of the proposition sgom-pa mi-dgos \"Meditationis not necessary\" in the COMPLEMENT construction bla-mas sgom-pa mi-dgos-par bzed \"The lamamaintains that meditation is not necessary\" with its use as a simple ADVERB in bla-mas sgom-pa mi-dgos-par bden-pa mthon \"The lama, without meditation being necessary, sees the truth.\" In many cases, thecorrect reading whether complement or simple adverb-will depend on the particular verb headfor example,BZED \"maintain\" as opposed to MTHON \"see\"and the distribution of its participants. < previous pagepage_337next page >"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"page_338file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_338.html[8/7/2010 9:55:22 PM]< previous pagepage_338next page >Page 338seem to make much difference: compare, for example, [rgyal-posyon Nbul-ba]- dka \"The giving of gifts by theking was difficult\" with [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-ba]-r dka \"It was difficult for the king to give gifts,\" or nas [rgyal-posyon Nbul-ba]- Ndod \"I desire the giving of gifts by the king'' with nas [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-ba]-r Ndod ''Idesire that the king give gifts.\" With many verbs, however, a patient construction seems to refer to an ACTION,while a complement construction seems to refer to a FACT. Note the following comparisons:ACTIONFACT[rgyal-pos yon Nbul-ba]-[rgyal-pos yon Nbul-ba]-rgrags \"The giving of giftsgrags \"It is well knownby the king is well known.\"that the king gives gifts.\"nas [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-nas [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-ba]- brdzed \"I forgot theba]-r brdzed \"I forgot thatgiving of gifts by the king.\"the king gives gifts.\"nas [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-nas [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-ba]- ñan \"I heard the givingba]-r ñan \"I heardof gifts by the king.\"that the king gives gifts.\"nas [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-nas [rgyal-pos yon Nbul-ba]- rig \"I understand theba]-r rig \"I understandgiving of gifts by the king.\"that the king gives gifts.\"Note, too, that many verbs that occur with a complement cannot occur with a nominalized proposition as patientforexample, [sin Nthu-ba]-r Ngro \"He goes to gather wood\" but not ?[Sin Nthu-ba]- Ngro, [Sin Nthu-ba]-r gsol \"Ipray that you gather wood\" but not ?[Sin Nthu-ba]- gsol [Sin Nthu-ba]-r smras \"He said that he gathers wood\"but not ?[sin Nthu-ba]-0 smras.2.3.2.3.1. Types of Complement ConstructionThere are four types of verb complement construction, according to two intersecting distinctions. First, the verbhead can be either transitive or intransitive; second, the verb head can either require or not require that aparticipant in the complement be coreferential with its patient and be omitted from the complement.

Type 1 Complement ConstructionsIn a Type 1 complement construction, the complement replaces the patient of its intransitive verb head: in such aconstruction, the verb has no patient participant. Type 1 verb heads are, generally, what we can call STATUSVERBS: they express the epistemic status of the complementfor example, GSAL \"be clear,\" MNON \"be evident,\"BDEN \"be true,\" SRID \"be possible,\" NES \"be certain,\" GRAGS \"be well-known,\"; or its evaluative statusforexample, RUN \"be proper,\" os \"be appropriate in terms of status,\" DGOS \"be necessary,\" BYA \"be requisite,\"43DKA \"be difficult,\" SÑAN \"be sweet-sounding\"; or its ontological statusfor example, YIN \"be the case,\" NDUG \"bethe current condition,\" YOD \"be present,\" BYUN \"occur,\" GYUR \"eventuate,\" ON \"be coming,\" SON \"havehappened.\"4442 Note that these are syntactic distinctions, depending on the number and nature of the participants which,in addition to the complement, accompany the verb head. If there turn out to be semantic correlates to suchsyntactic distinctionsfor example, if \"verbs of perception\" turn out to be largely Type 3 headsthen so muchthe better.43 The verb BYA \"be requisite\" is in fact the future stem bya < b-BYA of the transitive verb BYA(byed/byas/bya/byos)\"make, do.\" In complement constructions, this stem is frequently normativethus bla-masbgegs gdul-bar bya \"The lama should tame the demon,\" rgyal-pos dgra bsad-par mi-bya \"The king ought notslay the enemy.\" The normativity of these constructions comes from their original use as translations ofSanskrit future passive verb forms.44 The verb head SON \"have happened\" is in fact what is usually considered to be the highly irregular paststem of NGRO \"go.\" < previous pagepage_339next page >"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"page_340file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_340.html[8/7/2010 9:55:24 PM]< previous pagepage_340next page >Page 340Complement constructions with evaluative status verbs are often themselves nominalized and used as relativemodifiers of a nominal headthus, for example, bla-ma mtshod-par os-pa \"a lama worthy of worship,\" bstan-btsosrig-par dka-ba \"a treatise which is difficult to understand,\" tshig Ndzigs-su run-ba \"a word to be feared,\" dge-slonsnod-du run-ba \"a monk worthy to be a disciple,'' bstan-pa ses-par bya-ba ''a doctrine one should know.\"Even more important, ontological status verbs are widely found in PERIPHRASTIC constructions.

Type 2 Complement ConstructionsIn a Type 2 complement construction, the complement does not replace the patient of its intransitive verb head;instead, the complement has a missing participant which is processed as coreferential with the patient participant ofthe verb it modifies. Compare, for example, the Type 1 bla-ma-s bgegs btul-bar bden \"It is true that the lamatamed the demon\" with the Type 2 bla-ma- bgegs btul-bar ons \"The lama came to tame the demon.\" The firstconstruction has no patient participant of the verb head, and can be diagrammed as [bla-ma-s bgegs btul-ba]-rbden. The second construction has both a patient and a complement of the verb head, and can be diagrammed asbla-ma-[bla ma-s bgegs btul-ba]-r ons.Type 2 verb heads do not seem to be neatly classifiable, but many of them are verbs of intention or abilityforexample, NUS \"be able,\" THUB \"be able,\" RTSOL \"endeavor,\" BRTSON \"strive,\" RTSAM \"begin,'' SES \"know,\"NGRO \"go,\" ON \"come.\"46 Others are verbs indicating a change of state, used with equative complementsforexample, SNAN \"appear,\" DZU \"melt,\" THIM \"dissolve,\" TSAR \"become visible.\"46 I believe the verbs NGRO \"go\" and ON \"come,\" used as Type 2 verb heads, have an intentional qualityabout themfor example, dge-slon sin Nthu-bar Ngro \"The monk goes (in order) to gather wood,\" bla-matshos sgrog-par ons \"The lama came (in order) to proclaim the dharma.\" Note that a verb can function asmore than one type of complement head: note the difference in the meaning of the verb ON \"come\"between the Type 1 construction bla-ma-s bgegs btul-bar on \"The lama WILL tame the demon\" and theType 2 construction bla-ma- bgegs btul-bar on \"The lama COMES TO tame the demon.\" < previous pagepage_341next page >"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"page_342file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_342.html[8/7/2010 9:55:25 PM]< previous pagepage_342next page >Page 3422.3.2.3.1.3. Type 3 Complement ConstructionsIn a Type 3 complement construction, the complement replaces the patient of its transitive head: in such aconstruction, the verb has no patient participant. Again, Type 3 verb heads are not neatly classifiable, but many ofthem seem to involve the reception, processing, or transmittal of INFORMATION: for example, as to informationRECEPTION, we find MTHON \"see,\" ÑAN \"hear,\" RTOG \"recognize,\" RMI \"dream,'' DMIGS ''visualize\"; as toinformation PROCESSING, we find SAM \"think, GO \"understand,\" NDOD \"desire,\" DRAN \"remember,\" RDZED\"forget,\" DZUN \"grasp\"; as to information TRANSMITTAL, we find BZED \"assert,\" SÑAD \"relate,\" SGRAG\"proclaim,\" SMRA \"say.\"Of course, any participant in a complement can optionally be omitted when it is recoverable from the discourse. Ina Type 3 complement construction such an omission can be syntactically ambiguous: for example, dge-slon-gisbgegs btul-bar sgrag can be read as either \"The monk proclaimed that (someone) had tamed the demon\" or\"(Someone) proclaimed that the monk had tamed the demon.\" One plausible reading of such a construction is thatan omitted complement participant is coreferential with the immediately preceding agency of the transitive verbheadthus \"THE MONK proclaimed that HE had tamed the demon.\" Where such a reading is in fact intended, theomitted complement participant may be marked by a reflexive delimiterthus dge-slon-gis [dge-slon RAN-gis bgegsbtul-ba]-r bsgrags \"The monk proclaimed that he HIMSELF had tamed the demon.\"2.3.2.3.1.4. Type 4 Complement ConstructionsIn a Type 4 complement construction, the complement does not replace the patient of its transitive verb head;instead, the complement has a missing participant which is processed as coreferential with the patient participant ofthe verb it modifies. Compare, for example, the Type 3 bla-mas dge-slon-gis bgegs btul-bar rmis \"The lamadreamed that the monk tamed the demon\" with the Type 4 bla-mas dge-slon- bgegs btul-bar bskul \"The lamaexhorted the monk to tame the demon.\" The first construction has no patient participant of the verb head, and canbe diagrammed as bla-mas [dge-slon-gis bgegs btul-ba]-r rmis.

The Omission of -PaAs we have discussed above, the nominalizer -Pa can be omitted when it would otherwise occur between a verbstem and a bound particle. Such omissions are found in complement constructions as wellthus, for example, bla-ma bgegs btul-du ons \"The lama came to tame the demon,\" rgyal-pos bla-ma tshos sgrog-tu bskul \"The kingexhorted the lama to proclaim the dharma.\"47 In such cases, too, the adverb marker -Tu may be omitted along withthe -Pafor example, in the biography of Mi-la ras-pa by Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, a-khui khyim rdibs-nas mi man-po si Ndug ''My uncle's house fell down, and many people died.\" Note, for example, the perceived parallelism ofthese two lines by Sa-skya panditaNdzam-pos Ndzam-po Ndzoms byed-tsin, Ndzam-pos rtsub-moan Ndoms-parbyed \"Gentleness conquers the gentle, and gentleness conquers the rough.\"2.3.2.3.4. Equative ComplementsVerb complements can also be built from equative propositionsfor example, Nbans-sig rdze yin \"A vassal is king\"Nbans-sig rde yin-par re \"A vassal hopes to be king.\" When the equative verb YIN is omitted from the equativeproposition, the nominalizer -Pa which is attached to the verb disappears47 I have a hunch that the omission of -Pa before -Tu in these constructions is much more frequent inoreven limited tothose with Type 2 and Type 4 verb heads. I have a hunch that this might have something todo with the fact that Type 2 and Type 4 verb heads include those verbs of change that often occur withequative complements, and that equative complements normally omit both the equative verb YIN and itsattached nominalizer -Pa.

On Translating Sanskrit VerbsClassical Sanskrit had an extraordinarily complexenthusiasts say \"rich\" system of verbal inflection. In addition tothe interaction of several tense and mode forms,48 the verb system was premised on a pervasive distinction be-48 One way of conceptualizing the overall Sanskrit verb system is as follows. There were four TENSES(present, future, perfect, and aorist) which intersected with four MODES (indicative, preterite, optative, andimperative) to yield a 4 x 4 matrix of possible verb forms. Of these sixteen theoretically possiblecombinations, ten were of sufficiently frequent occurrence to warrant notice in the grammatical tradition.Thus Sanskrit had not only such(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_345next page >"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"page_346file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_346.html[8/7/2010 9:55:27 PM]< previous pagepage_346next page >Page 346tween active and passive forms of verbsa distinction which was absolutely meaningless in Tibetan.49 Yet thisdistinction also underlay much of the Buddhist philosophical terminology the Tibetans were so eager to master,such as karana/kadrya \"cause/effect,\" grahaka/grahya \"subject/object,\" adhara/ adheya \"mandala palace/mandaladeities.'' The following sections will describe how these Sanskrit verb forms were translated into Tibetan.2.3.2.3.5.1. Simple FormsAs Inaba Shoju has described in detail for us, the Tibetans dealt with this problem first by reducing all the differentSanskrit verb forms to four present, past, future, and imperativeto match their own verb system. Leaving aside theimperative, this meant that for all practical purposes the various Sanskrit verbs and participles, both active andpassive, could be reduced to six-PRESENT, PAST, and FUTURE ACTIVE; and PRESENT, PAST, and FUTUREPASSIVE. Then the following convention was adopted: the Sanskrit PAST ACTIVE and PAST PASSIVE wereboth translated with the Tibetan PAST stem; the Sanskrit PRESENT ACTIVE and FUTURE ACTIVE were bothtranslated with the Tibetan PRESENT stem; and the Sanskrit PRESENT PASSIVE and FUTURE PASSIVE wereboth translated with the Tibetan FUTURE STEM. We can diagram this convention as follows:(footnote continued from previous page)relatively straightforward forms as a present indicative or future indicative or present optative but also suchcombinations as a future preterite (\"conditional\"), aorist optative (\"precative\"), and perfect preterite(\"pluperfect\"). This complex system stood in contrast to classical Tibetan with its four tensespresent, past,future, and imperative.49 Sanskrit, unlike English, allows passives from both transitives and intransitivesthus indrah sornam pibati\"Indra drinks soma,\" indrah aste \"Indra sits,\" indrena somah piyate \"Soma is drunk by Indra,\" as well asindrena asyate \"There is some sitting going on, and Indra is doing it.'' Now Tibetan isperfectly capable ofsaying dban-po-s so-ma- Nhun \"Indra drinks soma\" and dban-po- bzugs \"Indra sits\"; it is certainly capable ofmaking so-ma \"soma\" the THEME of a proposition with a transitive verb, as in so-ma- dban-po-s Nthun \"Asfor soma, Indra drinks it\"; and it can assign more or less RESPONSIBILITY to dban-po \"Indra\" through theselection of a transitive or intransitive verbfor example, dban-po-s so-ma- me-la Nbebs \"Indra casts the somainto the fire\" as opposed to dban-po-s so-ma- me-la Nbab \"The soma descends into the fire because of Indra.\"But it can make little syntactic or morphological sense out of the notion of the PASSIVE in Sanskrit. < previous pagepage_346next page >"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"page_347file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_347.html[8/7/2010 9:55:28 PM]< previous pagepage_347next page >Page 347ACTIVEPASSIVEPRESENTPresent stemFuture stemPASTPast stemFUTUREPresent stemFuture stemThis meant that all the various Sanskrit past tense forms, both verbs and participles, were translated with theTibetan PAST stem. This convention applied to past ACTIVE forms, as in Sanskrit asruni pramuñcat Tibetanmtshi-ma phyun \"He shed tears,\" Sanskrit mahanagarim pravisat Tibetan gron-khyer tshen-por zugs \"He enteredthe great city\"; and it applied as well to past PASSIVE forms, as in Sanskrit sa ca balaprthagjanair udgrhitahTibetan de yan byis-pa so-soi skye-bo-rnams-kyis bzun \"And that is grasped by fools,\" Sanskrit maya sattvahparimocitah Tibetan nas sems-tsan-rnams bkrol ''Sentient creatures are saved by me.\" Here the Tibetan PASTstems phyun < b-PHYUN-s ''shed,\" zugs < -DZUG-s \"entered,\" bzun < b-DZUN-S \"grasped,\" and bkrol < b-GROL-s \"saved\" are used to translate both PAST ACTIVE and PAST PASSIVE forms in Sanskrit.Sanskrit PRESENT ACTIVE forms were translated, similarly, with the Tibetan PRESENT stem, as in Sanskritindhanam agnir dahati Tibetan mes bud-sin sreg \"Fire burns the firewood,\" Sanskrit sunyan vyavalokayati Tibetanston-pa rnam-par lta \"He examines the empty.\" Here the Tibetan PRESENT stems sreg < N-SREG \"burns\" and lta< N-LTA \"looks\" are used to translate Sanskrit PRESENT ACTIVE forms.But, interestingly, Sanskrit PRESENT PASSIVE forms were regularly translated with the Tibetan FUTURE stem,as in Sanskrit rupam visyatvenopadisyate Tibetan gzugs ni yul-ñid yin-par ñe-bar bstan \"Form is explained asbeing a perceptual object,\" Sanskrit anyavittiti grahanena daurmanasyavarjitam grhyate Tibetan tshor gzan zesbya-ba smos-pas ni yid mi-bde-ba-las gzan-pai tshor-ba gzun \"By the expression 'other consciousness' isunderstood a consciousness other than a sorrowful one,\" Sanskrit kasya karanam iti parikalpyate Tibetan gan-girgyu yin-par brtag \"It is determined of what it is the cause.\" Here the Tibetan FUTURE stems bstan < b-STAN\"will explain,\" gzun < G-DZUN \"will understand,\" and brtag < b-RTAG \"will determine\" are used to translateSanskrit PRESENT PASSIVE forms.In the same way, Sanskrit FUTURE ACTIVE forms were translated with the Tibetan PRESENT stem, as inSanskrit aviksiptacitta manasikarisyati Tibetan < previous pagepage_347next page >"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"page_348file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_348.html[8/7/2010 9:55:28 PM]< previous pagepage_348next page >Page 348g.yen-ba med-pai sems-kyis yid-la byed \"The unwavering mind will ponder it,\" Sanskrit evam darsanam paran evadraksyati na svatmanam Tibetan de bzin-du lta-ba yan gzan kho-na-la ltai, ran-gi bdag-ñid-la ma-yin \"Thusvision will see only others, not itself,\" Sanskrit bodhisattva mahasattva bhavisyanti Tibetan byan-tshub sems-dpasems-dpa tshen-po Nbyun \"There will be bodhisattvas, great beings.\" Here the Tibetan PRESENT stems byed < N-BYA-D \"does,\" lta < N-LTA ''sees,'' and Nbyun < N-BYUN \"occurs\" are used to translate Sanskrit FUTUREACTIVE forms.Finally, under the same convention, Sanskrit FUTURE PASSIVE forms were translated with the Tibetan FUTURESTEM, as in Sanskrit laksanalaksanatas tathagato drastavyah Tibetan de-bzin-gsegs-pa-la mtshan-dan mtshan-med-par blta \"The Thus-gone One is to be seen through signs and nonsigns,\" Sanskrit udgrahitavyo nadharmahTibetan tshos ma-yin-pa yan mi-gzun \"What is not the dharma is not to be grasped.\" Here the Tibetan future stemsblta < b-LTA \"will see\" and gzun < G-DZUN \"will grasp\" are used to translate Sanskrit FUTURE PASSIVE forms.The same convention was used in translating Sanskrit nouns. Sanskrit nominal derivatives from active verbs weretranslated into Tibetan by nominalizing present stems; Sanskrit nominal derivatives from passive verbs weretranslated into Tibetan by nominalizing future stems. Thus we find Sanskrit grahaka/ grahya Tibetan Ndzin-pa/gzun-ba \"subject/object,\" using the present stem Ndzin < N-DZUN-D and future stem gzun < G-DZUN of theroot DZUN \"grasp\"; Sanskrit karana/karya Tibetan byed-pa/bya-ba \"cause/effect,\" using the present stem byed <N-BYA-D and future stem bya < b-BYA of the root BYA \"do,\" and Sanskrit adhara/adheya Tibetan rten-pa/brten-pa \"mandala palace/mandala deities,\" using the present stem rten < N-KTEN and future stem brten < b-RTEN ofthe root RTEN \"support.\"2.3.2.3.5.2. Periphrastic FormsSimilar conventions governed the translation of Sanskrit verbs PERIPHRASTICALLY. Periphrastic translations ofSanskrit verbs used tense stems of two verbsBYA \"do\" and GYUR \"eventuate\"as verb heads of VERBCOMPLEMENT constructions. Sanskrit PAST forms, both active and passive, used primarily the PAST stem byasof the head verb BYA. Sanskrit PASSIVE FORMS, both present and future, used the FUTURE stem bya of thehead verb BYA.

In each suchconstruction, the stem of the verb within the complement conforms to the stem convention of simple translationforms.50 We can diagram this periphrastic convention as follows:ACTIVEPASSIVEPRESENTPRESENT STEM-Pa-r byedFUTURE STEM-Pa-r byaPASTPAST STEM-Pa-r byasFUTUREPRESENT STEM-Pa-r NgyurFUTURE STEM-Pa-r byaThis convention, again, meant that all Sanskrit past tense forms could be translated periphrastically in the formPAST STEM-Pa-r byas, as in Sanskrit mayaragita aragya na viragitah Tibetan nas mñes-par byas-te, mñes-parbyas-nas thugs ma-byun-bar byas \"They were pleased with me, and, having been pleased, did not turn away.\"Both Sanskrit PRESENT PASSIVE and FUTURE PASSIVE forms were translated periphrastically in the formFUTURE STEM-Pa-r bya. Thus we find, for the present tense, Sanskrit sadhyate Tibetan bsgrub-par bya \"It isproven,\" Sanskrit sampradharyate Tibetan dpyad-par bya \"It is examined,\" and, identically, for the future tense,Sanskrit jñatavya Tibetan ses-par bya ''It is to be known,\" Sanskrit vistarena ganaaniyam Tibetan rgyas-par brtsi-bar bya \"It is to be counted in detail.\"5150 Although the head verb GYUR was used primarily to translate Sanskrit future active forms, its past stemgyur is occasionally found in the translation of Sanskrit past forms-for example, the aorist in Sanskrit anga-pratyanga-rnamsany acchaitsit Tibetanyan-lag-dan ñin-lag-rnams btsad-par gyur \"They cut off theirlimbs and secondary limbs.\" In addition, the head verb GYUR seems to be used in translating a variety ofSanskrit irrealis modes. It is found in translations of the Sanskrit CONDITIONAL or future preterite, as inSanskrit anyatha hi naiva samskara-grahanam akarisyata Tibetan de-lta ma-yin-na Ndu-byed smos-pa mi-mdzad-par Ngyur \"Otherwise one would not name them conditioned states,\" Sanskrit sacel loka-dhaturabhavisyat sa eva pinda-graho 'bhavisyat Tibetan gal-te khams-sig mtshis-par gyur-na de-ñid ril-porNdzin-par Ngyur \"If there were a world, there would also be taking it to be real\"; and in translations of theSanskrit OPTATIVE, as in Sanskrit syuh skandhayatanani yadi dhatava eva syuh Tibetan gal-te khams-ñidyod-na phun-po-dan skyed-mtshed-rnams yod-par Ngyur \"If there were elements, there would be groupsand senses.\"51 Future passive participles are fairly common in Buddhist texts in Sanskrit; in many(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_349next page >"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"page_350file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_350.html[8/7/2010 9:55:29 PM]< previous pagepage_350next page >Page 350However, Sanskrit PRESENT ACTIVE forms were translated periphrastically in the form PRESENT STEM-Pa-rbyed, as in Sanskrit agnih paratmanam eva dahati Tibetan me ni gzan-gyi bdag-ñid kho-na sreg-par byed \"Fireburns only the essence of others,\" Sanskrit tad eva ajanati Tibetan de-ñid kun ses-par byed \"He knows just that\";while Sanskrit FUTURE ACTIVE forms were translated periphrastically, with a different verb head, in the formPRESENT STEM-Pa-r Ngyur, as in Sanskrit na tesam atma-samjña pravartisyate Tibetan de-dag-la ni bdag-tuNdu-ses Ndzug-par mi-Ngyur \"The idea of self will not occur to them,'' Sanskrit aprapto na dhaksyati Tibetanphrad med-na sreg-par mi-Ngyur \"What is not in contact will not burn.\"Figure 11.Charm against astrological misfortune(footnote continued from previous page)such texts they are the major hortatory device.

There are three basic ways of using a proposition inTibetanas a STATEMENT (\"I assert PROPOSITION\"), as a QUESTION (\"I query PROPOSITION\"), or as aCOMMAND (\"I order PROPOSITION''). A particular propositional content may thus remain constant while itsperformance varies. For example, the sentences dgra Nbros-so \"The enemy flees,\" dgra Nbros-sam \"Does theenemy flee?'' and dgra Nbros-sig \"Let the enemy flee!\" can be considered different performances of the sameproposition dgra Nbros.11.

These are the three PRIMARY PERFORMANCE PARTICLES; every Tibetan sentence is one of these threesentence types. It is important to remember that Tibetan performance particles do not necessarily coincide with anyovert punctuation in the text. The vertical stroke or sad is a guide to reading aloud rather than to grammar;although it is of course often the case that the end of a sentence coincides with a reading pause, it is not unusual tofind two or more sentences written consecutively without punctuation.2. Modal PerformativesThere is some reason to believe that Tibetanin common with other Sino-Tibetan languageshas had a richer array ofsentence-final performance1 Similarly, compare bla-ma ñal-lo \"The lama is sleeping,\" bla-ma ñal-lam \"Is the lama sleeping?\" bla-mañal-zig \"Sleep, O lama!\" and rgyal-pos Ndre brduns-so \"The king hit the demon,\" rgyal-pos Ndre brduns-sam \"Did the king hit the demon?\" rgyal-pos Ndre rduns-sig \"Let the king hit the demon!\" < previous pagepage_351next page >"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"page_352file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_352.html[8/7/2010 9:55:30 PM]< previous pagepage_352next page >Page 352particles than is immediately apparent in the classical texts.2 We have called the statement, question, andcommand particles the primary performance particles, and noted that every Tibetan sentence falls into one of thesethree sentence types; but we additionally find several MODAL PERFORMANCE PARTICLES which can occurafter the primary particle and specify more precisely the sort of statement, question, or command being uttered. Forexample, compare rgyal-po bsad-do \"He will kill the king\" with rgyal-po bsadkyis \"He will kill the king, Ipromise!\" or rgyal-po bsad-da-re ''Be careful, he may kill the king''; compare bla-ma yin-nam \"Is this the lama?\"with bla-ma yin-nam-zig-gu \"Could this be the lama?\" or bla-ma yin-na \"I wonder if this is the lama\"; comparesin khyer-zig \"Carry the wood!\" with sin khyer-zig-dan \"Carry the wood, OK?\" Where such a modal performanceparticle is present, the primary performance particle is frequently omitted. Modal performance particles are foundprimarily in the early translations, in the epic, and in the more colloquial classical texts influenced by MiddleTibetan. In the sections that follow we will discuss each modal performance particle in the context of the primaryperformance particle with which it occurs.3. Statements3.1. The Statement ParticleThe STATEMENT PARTICLE is -o. The hyphen indicates that the form is BOUND and occurs only with animmediately preceding proposition. The capitalization indicates that the vowel prefixes to itself the last consonantof the preceding syllable codathus dag-go, rin-no, yod-do, yin-no, thub-bo, Npham-mo, sgyur-ro, Nbul-lo, andlags-so. A preceding open syllable becomes a diphthongthus dgao, Nbrio, rgyuo, dgeo, and Ngroo. In the scansionof verse such diphthongs may occasionally be counted as two syllables for the purpose of meter.3.2. RedundancyThe overwhelming majority of Tibetan sentences are statements rather than questions or commands; in fact, wemight well assume that any given2 In the Tibeto-Burman language Lisu, for example, we find performance particles which indicate that aproposition is a warning, a complaint, a plea, a surprise, and so oninformation often conveyed in English byintonation alone. < previous pagepage_352next page >"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"page_353file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_353.html[8/7/2010 9:55:31 PM]< previous pagepage_353next page >Page 353sentence is a statement unless specifically informed otherwise. Given such an assumption, the statement particle -obecomes REDUNDANT, and, under the Telegram Principle, may be omitted. Thus we find sentences without anovert sentence signal, such as bla-ma ñal \"The lama sleeps\" instead of the more explicit bla-ma ñal-lo.The omission of the statement particle is always optional, but in any given text such an omission may be more orless the norm: it is quite common in narrative prose, in colloquial register, and in paratactic styles; it is lesscommon in didactic prose, in formal register, and in hypotactic styles. The statement particle appears frequently inthe archaic manuscripts from Central Asia; it occurs only infrequently in the biography of Mi-la ras-pa written byGtsan-smyon he-ru-ka.Now when the particle occurs in a text that normally omits it, the particle may be processed as carrying extrainformation. It may be read as emphasizing the assertive character of the performance: for example, in thebiography of Mi-la we find Bdag-med-ma rebuking her husband Mar-pa for his apparently cruel treatment of Mi-la by saying yab-kyis ma-thub-pai dgra de thon-nas mi-gdao thugs bde lags-sam \"The enemy my lord could notconquer has left; he's not here, I tell you. Are you satisfied?\" It may be read as concluding a thought unit such as aphilosophical argument, narrative paragraph, or side comment: for example, in the biography of Mi-la we find theparticle marking a narrative sub-unit in the sequence kun yon-bdag-dan Nbans-su tshug-go, de-dus gtsan-ron-gimes-ston tshon-po bde-mtshog-gi dban-mo-tshe zur byun-bas \". . . and they all became his patrons and followers.Meanwhile, Mes-ston tshon-po of Gtsan-ron appeared for the great initiation of the god Cakrasamvara, and so . . .\"Finally, it may be read as marking the end of a sentence which has been embedded as a direct quote withinanother, as in dgos-so sñam \"I thought, 'I have to,''' or from which the equative verb has been omitted, as in gzugsston-pao \"Form (is) empty,'' khan-pa nao \"(It is) in the house,\" bla-mai mnon-ses ma-nor-ba yin-pas-so \"(It is)because the lama's clairvoyance is unerring.\"3.3. The Promise Particle -KYisTwo modal performance particles are found with statements: we will call these STATEMENT MODALS.

For example, in the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, the lama Rnog-pa makes apromise to Mi-la, saying dban-dan gdams-nag bya-yis \"I will bestow the initiation and teachings,\" and Bdag-med-ma similarly promises him ma-gnan-na nas zu-yis \"If he does not give them, I will ask him.\" The master Mar-patells Mi-la, without revealing his own identity, o-na nas mar-pa-dan sprad-kyis \"Well, I will introduce you to Mar-pa,'' and later promises sgrub-pa-la bzag-nas sgrub-rgyags sbyan-gis ''When I have set you to meditation I willsupply the provisions.\" Similarly, Mar-pa commands Mi-la to build yet another tower, and says to him Ndi bzig-kyan mi-dgos-kyis \"It will not be necessary to tear this one down, I promise.\"Similar examples occur in the twelfth-century Mani bka-Nbum, where we find such sentences as khyim no-ses-pa-la bu-mo sbyin-gyis \"I will give my daughter to the one who recognizes her house\" and ned-la mi-ster-na rgyal-khams mes bsreg-gis \"If you do not give her to me I will burn your kingdom with fire.\" In the epic we find Ge-sarthreatening his enemies in versegal-te bka-la ma-ñan-na, lna-pai lam-du gtan-gis zer \"'If you do not heed mycommand,' he said, 'I will send you on the path of death.\"' In the archaizing chronicle Rgyal-rabs gsal-bai me-lonwe find this prophecy of Padmasambhavaslobdpon pad-ma Nbyun-gnas-kyis, brtan-ma btsu-gnis dam-la btags-pas, bod-du mustegs-pa mi-yon-gis \"'I have bound the twelve goddesses to an oath,' said Padmasambhava, 'so thatunbelievers will not come to Tibet.' \"In some manuscripts we find what is clearly the same particle written -KYi. In the biography of Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka written by Sna-tshogs ran-grol, for example, we find the mad yogin eating the rotten brains of impaled headsand offering them to onlookers with the words dnos-grub dgos-na sbyin-gyi \"If you want magic powers I will givethem to you.\" Further, different manuscripts of the same text may sporadically make the same substitution: in theSpo blockprint of the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, for example, we find the reading mar-pa-dan sprad-gyi, ratherthan the reading mar-pa-dan sprad-kyis found in the woodblock prints from Spuns-than, Bstan-rgyas-glifi, andBkra-sis lhun-po, and cited in our discussion above; and where the Spo blockprint reads gdams-pa bya-yis, ascited above, the Bstan-rgyas-glin and Bkra-sis lhun-po prints read gdams-pa bya-yi. < previous pagepage_354next page >"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"page_355file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_355.html[8/7/2010 9:55:32 PM]< previous pagepage_355next page >Page 3553.4. The Warning Particle -A-reAnother statement modal is the particle -A-re, found primarily in the translation literature and used where aspeaker is asserting a warning: we will call -A-re the WARNING PARTICLE.3 Warning statements predictconsequences which will arise if some course of action isor is notfollowed, and thus are often found aftercommands and prohibitions. For example, in the Tibetan translation of the Lalitavistara we find the warning dge-slon-dag khyed de-bzin-gsegs-pa-la tshe-dan ldan-pa zes ma-rdzod-tsig, khyed-la yun-rin-por mi-phanpa-dangnod-pa-dan mi-bde-bar gyur-ta-re \"Monks, do not call the Tathagata 'Venerable One'! There will be hurt andharm and unhappiness for you for a long time.\" In the Tibetan translation of the Divyavadana we read tshosbzinma-yin-pas rgyal-srid ma-byed-tsig, sems-tsan-dmyal-bar gzol-bar gyur-ta-re \"Do not rule unjustly! You will fallto hell.\" Sometimes the sequence is reversed, as when we find in the Tibetan translation of the Vinayavastu thesentences khyod bsad-da-re sgra ma-Nbyin-tsig ''I will kill you. Don't make a sound.\"There are different techniques, Men write to be read, or spoken, Or declaimed, or rhapsodized, And quite differently to be sung.Louis Zukofsky,\"A \" 1Again, warnings may be about things and persons rather than about courses of conduct. In the Vinayavibhanga afable about slander concludes with the moral wa-skyes gron-pa brdzun-du smra-ba byed-pa, mdza-bses Nbyed-parbyed-pa skyes-ta-re \"The fox is one who makes people tell lies; he is born as a separator of friends,\" and in thesame text we read de-dag-gis dei srun-mar tshom-rkun-pa mi bzi bzag-ste, Ndi bros-par gyur-ta-re zes bsgo\"They set four3 Note that, whereas the promise particle -KYis marks a statement as promising some event that may beeither desired or undesired but is under the speaker's control, the warning particle -A-re marks a statementas promising some event that is not necessarily under the speaker's control but which is invariablyundesired by the addressee. < previous pagepage_355next page >"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"page_356file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_356.html[8/7/2010 9:55:32 PM]< previous pagepage_356next page >Page 356thieves as his guards and said, 'He may escape.\"' In the Saddharmapundarika we find the warninggnas Ndi-la nithe-tshom Ntshal-ba-yis, byan-tshub-sems-dpa nan-Ngror mtshis-sa-re \"By having doubt on this point abodhisattva may fall to an evil destiny,\" and in the Lalitavistara the wicked Mara warns the Buddha-to-be od-maimyu-gu Itar do-mod btsad-da-re \"Today I will cut you down like a green bamboo stalk.\"44. QuestionsWe can distinguish two different types of questionyes-no questions (Are you ready? Does he like Mozart?)andinformation questions (When did he go? What is your name?). A YES-NO QUESTIONso called because it can beanswered yes or no in English-asks about the truth of a proposition as a whole; an INFORMATION QUESTIONsocalled because its answer requires a specific piece of informationassumes the truth of the proposition but asksabout the identity of a participant. The yes-no question Did John see Mary?asks, in effect, \"Is the proposition Johnsaw Mary true?\" The information question Whom did John see?presupposes that John saw someone and requeststhe identity of the patient participant in the event.5In classical Tibetan, performance particles mark propositions and not participants; hence the question particleidentifies yes-no questions. Participants, on the other hand, are identified by determiners; hence in informationquestions the queried participant is marked by an indefinite determiner.4 In many cases this warning particle was used to translate Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit constructions with main the sense of \"lest, in order that not,\" and it may similarly be convenient to TRANSLATE such Tibetanwarnings into English using such expressions as lest or for fear that-for example, tshos-bzin ma-yin-pasrgyal-srid ma-byed-tsig, sems-tsan-dmyal-bar gzol-bar gyur-ta-re \"Do not rule unjustly LEST you fall tohell\" or \"Do not rule unjustly so THAT YOU DO NOT fall to hell.'' We must bear in mind, however, thatany negation is being created by the Englishor the Sanskritand does not lie in the Tibetan.5 Note the close relationship this entails between such sentences as Where are you going?and You are goingsomewhere, or Who hit John?and Someone hit John, which is reflected in the use of Tibetan indefinitedeterminers as interrogatives. < previous pagepage_356next page >"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"page_357file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_357.html[8/7/2010 9:55:33 PM]< previous pagepage_357next page >Page 3574.1. The Question ParticleThe QUESTION PARTICLE -Am marks yes-no questions in classical Tibetan. The hyphen indicates that the formis BOUND and occurs only with an immediately preceding proposition. The capitalization indicates that the vowelprefixes to itself the last consonant of the preceding syllable codathus dag-gam, rin-nam, yod-dam, yin-nam, thub-bam, Npham-rnam, sgyur-ram, Nbul-lam, and lags-sam. A preceding open syllable becomes a diphthongthusdgaam, Nbriam, rgyuam, dgeam, and Ngroam. In the scansion of verse such diphthongs may occasionally becounted as two syllables for the purposes of meter.Note the following examples. Mar-pa performs a miraculous transformation and then asks Mi-la the question bumthon-nam yid-tshes-sam \"Did my son see? did you believe?\" Mi-la, in a fit of depression, thinks ltseb-bam ltseb-bam \"Should I kill myself? Should I kill myself?\" Sa-skya pandita writes khyod-kyi bya-ba zin-nam zes, Ntshi-bdag sdod-par mi-Ngyur ''The Lord of Death will not wait, saying, 'Have you finished your work?\"' Complexpropositions can also be made into interrogatory sentences with the question particlefor example, lar mkhar gru-gsum hom-khun Ndra-ba Ndir ned-rnams btsug-ste mthu-byed bsam-pa yin-nam \"Well! Were you thinking ofcasting us into this triangular tower, shaped like a pit of sacrifice, and working magic on us?\" Negativepropositions can similarly be made interrogative and used as rhetorical questions. Sa-skya pandita was particularlyfond of this device; in his Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter we find, for example, dud-Ngro yin-yan rigs-mthun-rnams, khyu gtsig-tu ni mi-gnas-sam \"Even among beasts, do not those of the same kind stay in one herd?'' rta-largyan-du byas-pa de, bdag-po ñid-la mi-mdzes-sam \"Is not what is done to adorn the horse becoming to themaster himself?\" lag-pas dgra-bo mi-gsod-na, mtshon-tsha len-par mi-byed-dam \"If one does not kill the enemywith one's hands, does one not take up the sword?\"4.2. Questions And AlternativesIt seems clear that the question particle -Am is the same as the -Am which marks an alternative conjunction. Thereis certainly reason to believe that yes-no questions in Tibetan derive ultimately from alternative conjunctions,which are sometimes made explicit: for example, in one archaic Central Asian text, the first horse to be tamed byman says khyod tshab gan-la-ru bgyi-am myi-bgyi yan ba-rab-tu sbog-gam myi-sbog \"Will you or will you notwater me < previous pagepage_357next page >"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"page_358file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_358.html[8/7/2010 9:55:33 PM]< previous pagepage_358next page >Page 358on the mountain passes, and will you or will you not wade me in the cattle fords?\" and, in his biography, Mi-la istold khyed-ran-la sog gsun-ba Ndug-pas Ngroam mi-Ngro \"He has said to you, 'Come!' so are you going or not?\"Often the negated alternative is replaced by the interrogative determiner tsi \"what?\" yielding the question marker -Am-tsi \"or what?\"for example, in the collection of tales called the Mdzans-blun, where we read na no-ses-sam tsi\"Do you recognize me?\" The Sanskrit word kinnara refers to heavenly musicians with the heads of horses; theterm was given the folk etymology kim nara \"Is this a man?\" which was duly translated in the ninth-centuryMahavyutpatti dictionary as Tibetan miam tsi \"Is this a man or what?'' This locution is found as late as the 13th-century Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter by Sa-skya pandita, who probably liked the resulting three-syllablecollocations primarily for metrical reasons: we find, for example, mar-mei od-la Ndzin-ba-yis, sbran-bu dpa-barNgro-am tsi ''Does a fly become a hero by fighting with the light of a lamp?\" gtsan-gzan dug-pai nags-khrod-du,sems-ses rtag-tu sdod-dam tsi \"Does a smart person stay forever in a forest of poisonous beasts of prey?\" dpa-bosdgra-sde ma-thul-kyan, ran-phyogs gsod-par byed-dam tsi \"Though a hero does not subdue the enemy, does hekill his own side?\" tshu-sel me-rdor byed-pa-yi, yul der tshu-sel Ntshon-nam tsi \"Does one sell crystal in acountry where they consider crystal to be flint?\"4.3. Information QuestionsIn a question asking the identity of a particular participant, the queried participant is indicated by one of fourINTERROGATIVE DETERMINERSgan \"what?\" tsi \"what?\" su \"who?\" and nam \"when?\"6 The determiner can6 The interrogative determiner gan \"what?\" is sometimes found in the reduced form ga-before the particles-na, -nas, -la, -las, -ru, and -r. In the archaic Central Asian manuscripts we already find bu ga-las gar sonson \"Child, whence and whither have you gone?\" In the biography of Mi-la we find gar son \"Where did hego?\" Use of the form ga-la \"how?\" is a favorite rhetorical device of Sa-skya pandita in his Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gterfor example, dug-sbrul gso-ba ga-la run \"How is it right to nurture a poisonous snake?\" Nbyor-ba thob-par gyur-na yan, bsod-nams med-na ga-la rtag \"Though one has gathered wealth, if onehas no merit, how can it last?\" dam-pa srog-la bab-na yan, ran-bin bzan-po ga-la Ndor \"Even if a holyone is in danger of his life, how can he abandon his innate goodness?\" nor-bus spras-pai gser-gyi rgyan,mdzes-kyan ba-lan ga-la lta \"Though a golden ornament adorned with gems be beautiful, how would an oxlook at it?\"(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_358next page >"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"page_359file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_359.html[8/7/2010 9:55:34 PM]< previous pagepage_359next page >Page 359occur both with and without a nominal headfor example, in the biography of Mi-la we find, with a nominal head,mthu-tshen khyod dban-gral-la sdod-pai DBAN-YON TSI yod \"Magician, WHAT INITIATION FEE do you havefor standing in the initiation line?\" and, without a nominal head, lo ser-bas brduns rtin na GAN za \"After the hailsmashes my crops, WHAT will I eat?\" Again, in the Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter by Sa-skya pandita wefind, with a nominal head, rna-la dbyug-gus ma-bsnun-par, de-srid gzan-dan KHYAD TSI yod ''Without hitting adrum with a drumstick, WHAT DIFFERENCE does it have from another?\" and, without a nominal head, bdag-ñidtshen-po gnas-pai sar, mkhas-pa gzan-dag su-yis rtsi \"In a place where a saint lives, WHO counts other wisemen?''7 And, just as we find indefinite adverbs, we also find interrogative adverbsthus, again from Sa-skyapandita, mkhas-pa mkhas-pai nan-na mdzes, blun-pos mkhas-pa DZI-LTAR go \"A wise man is beautiful among thewise; IN WHAT MANNER/HOW can a fool understand a wise man?\"The interrogative determiner tsi \"what?\" in most classical texts is syntactically parallel to the otherinterrogative determiners-for example, in the biography of Mi-la, khyod-kyis sdig-pa tsi byas \"What sinhave you done?\" mthu-tshen las tsi byed-tsin Ndug \"Great Magician, what work are you doing?\" mthu-tshen khyod-la dban-yon tsi yod \"Great Magician, what initiation fee have you?\" tsi zer \"What are yousaying?\" Similar constructions are found in the archaic Central Asian manuscriptsfor example, de ltarbyas-na dzi-la phan \"If we did that, wherein is the benefit?\" But in those manuscripts too we find someevidence of tsi as a marker for yes-no questions as wellfor example, bu ga-las gar son-son tsi myi tsi khyi\"Child, whence and whither have you gone? Are you human? Are you dog?\" bo-mo tsi zer tsi bden \"Whatis my daughter saying? Is it true?\" And some examples can be read as either yes-no or informationquestions, such as lha Ndi snun ltar Ngo-la myi drag-na dzi ñes \"Since these gods are not powerful incommand as before, what is the offense?/is there an offense?\" I am not sure how to account for this. Thisuse of the particle may be a remnant of an earlier INITIAL question particle, similaror perhaps evenrelatedto, say, Old Chinese >Middle Chinese *khyei \"How in the world . . .?\" In any event, this use oftsi appears already obsolescent in the eighth or ninth centuries.7 Where a nominal phrase with an interrogative determiner has no head, presumably the missing head isrecoverable from context or from knowledge of the worldfor example, na gan za \"What (food) will I eat?\"mkhas-pa gzan-dag su-yis rtsi \"What (person) counts other wise men?\" Compare, from Sa-skya pandita, theheadless tshun-ma nan-dan mdza-bo nan, rgyal-po nan-pa SU-zig bsten \"WHO relies on a bad wife, a badfriend, or a bad king?\" with the headed yon-tan ldan-pa mi-bkur-bai, gnas der MKHAS-PA su-zig sdod\"WHAT WISE MAN stays in a place where they do not honor the virtuous?\" Note the following headed andheadless interrogative phrases in the same versenan-skyugs khron-pa su-zig slon, skyugs-pa MKHAS-PA SU-zig myan \"WHO probes a well of vile vomit?

Similarly, when Mi-la isfirst searching for his teacher Mar-pa, he asks everyone he meets skyes-mtshog mar-pa lo-tstsha gan-na bzugs\"Where does Saint Mar-pa the Translator live?\" Finally, he meets someone who tells him mar-pa zer-ba ni yod,skyes-mtshog mar-pa lo-tstsha zer-ba ni med ''There is one who is called Mar-pa, but not one called Saint Mar-pathe Translator,\" and the following conversation takes place:o-na gro-bo lun gan-na yod byas-pas, gro-bo lun pha-gi yin zer bstan byun, pha-gi-na su bzugs byas-pas,mar-pa zer-ba de-ka yod zer, de-la gzan mtshan med-dam byas-pas, la-las bla-ma mar-paan zer-iii Ndugzer, bla-mai gdan-sa yin-par thag-tshod-de, la-kha Ndi-la tsi zer byas-pas, Ndi-la tshos la-gan zer zer,tshos la-gan-nas bla-mai gdan-sa mthon-ba rten-Nbrel sin-tu legs sñam dga-ba-zig byun\"Well, where is Gro-bo Valley?\" I said. \"Gro-bo Valley is over there,\" he said, and pointed. \"Who livesover there?\" I said. \"That same one called Mar-pa,\" he said. \"Has he no other name?\" I said. \"There aresome who call him lama Mar-pa too,\" he said. I decided that it was the lama's residence. \"What do they callthis pass?\" I said. \"They call it Dharma Ridge,\" he said; and I had the happy thought that it was anexcellent omen to see the lama's residence from Dharma Ridge.The flow of this conversation makes it clear what is intended to be a question.

The Doubt ParticlesTwo modal performatives are found with questions: we will call these QUESTION MODALS. Both these particlesare used where the speaker is querying a propositionor seeking the identity of a participanthesitantly or dubiously:the particles thus constitute what we will call DOUBT PERFORMATIVES.The particle -Tsig-gu is apparently found only in the translation literature. We find several examples of its use inthe Tibetan translation of the Karmasataka.

We read, for example, in the Li-siigur-khan dictionary, \"The particle -gu, as in gyur-tsig-gu, is an imperative.\" But the same function continued to beserved by the doubt particle -na, which seems to occur as early as in the archaic Central Tibetan manuscripts: wefind the perplexing passage bab gan-du bab-na, yul lha-yul gun-dan-gyi nan-du bab-te, dkor su-i dkor-na, lha-zagun-tshun-gyi dkor-dan dad-du babs-te \"The descent was, I wonder, a descent where?

CommandsIn English, commands generally have second-person subjects, but with the second-person pronoun omitted: thusGo look! means \"You go look!\" and Meditate! means \"You meditate!\" First- and third-person commands areexpressed periphrastically in such constructions as those with let and may, as in Let's go look! or May the lamameditate! In Tibetan, however, virtually any proposition can be made into a command by using the appropriateimperative verb stem and the command particlethus mal-Nbyor na sgoms-sig \"Let me the yogin meditate!\" mal-Nbyor-pa khyod sgoms-sig \"You the yogin meditate!\" mal-Nbyor-pa khon sgoms-sig \"Let him the yoginmeditate!\"109 This doubt particle is still found in New Tibetanfor example, New Tibetan (Lhasa) mo sü yina <mo suiyin-na>\"I wonder what her family name could be?\" khoN-lapetsa yöna <khon-la dpe-tsha yod-na>\"Mighthe possibly have a book?\"10 Such constructions do operate under the Telegram Principle: an omitted participant is processed asrecoverable from context; in conversation, a second-person addressee is inherently recoverable.

The Command ParticleThe COMMAND PARTICLE is -TSig. This bound particle becomes -tsig after preceding final -g, -d and -b;becomes -zig after preceding final -, -n, -m, -r, -l, and open syllables; and becomes -sig after preceding final orpostfinal -s.In addition, many transitive verbs have special IMPERATIVE STEMS characterized by aspirated initials, therounding of the vowel a in the root to o in the stem, and the inflection suffix -sfor example, thus < TU-s \"gather!\"khums < GUM-S \"kill!\" zos < ZA-S \"eat!'' ñon < ÑAN-S ''listen!\" skyogs < SKYAG-S \"spend!\" ltos < LTA-s \"look!\"mdzod < MDZAD-S \"do!\"11Since many transitive verbs have such distinctive imperative stems, the command particle is REDUNDANT aftersome verb stems. It is thus possible, under the Telegram Principle, to find imperative stems without command(footnote continued from previous page)and, in Tibetan contemplative poetry, not infrequently doesaddress oneself in internal conversation. Inaddition, the addressee may change abruptly: when one interlocutor wishes good luck for the other bysaying bkra-sis sog \"Let good luck come!\" the command is addressed to a third party.11 However, in any particular text, it is not surprising to find a more familiar present or past stem instead ofthe more exotic-looking imperative stem, even where the intent is clearly a commandfor example, byed insteadof byos < BYA-s \"do!\" or even a hybrid form such as ndos instead of either the present stem Ndzo or theimperative stem zos < DZO-s \"milk!\" In the text of the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, for example, three out offour manuscripts use the past stem brtsigs when Mar-pa tells Mi-la zol-gyi rnam-pai khyams ka-ba btsu-gñisyod-pa btsan-khan-dan btsas-pa-zig brtsigs \"Build a courtyard as an annex, with twelve pillars and a templefor the fierce deities\"; only one manuscriptfrom Spuns-than in Bhutanhas the grammatically correct readingrtsigs < RTSIG-S \"build!\"INTRANSITIVE verbs, on the other hand, generally have no distinctive imperative stem at all. Most often thepresent stem is used in imperative constructions; that the proposition is intended as a command is indicated bycontext, by the use of the command particle -Tsig, or by the presence of the ma- allomorph of the negativeparticle mI- \"NOT,\" instead of the mi- allomorph normally found before the present stem in statements. Forexample, when Mi-la says to his sisterpe-ta yi-mug ma-ldan zwa-tshos zos \"Pe-ta, let not sadness arise! Eatsome nettle soup!\" the TRANSITIVE verb zos < ZA-s \"eat!\" is clearly an imperative stem; theINTRANSITIVE verb ldan < N-LAN \"arises\" is clearly a present stem, but its function as a command is justas clearly indicated by the ma- allomorph of the negative particle before a non-past stem and by the context ofthe following transitive imperative. < previous pagepage_363next page >"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"page_364file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_364.html[8/7/2010 9:55:36 PM]< previous pagepage_364next page >Page 364particles;12 but I have been unable to discern any very systematic distinction between commands with imperativestems and command particles and commands with imperative stems alone.13 I do have an impression thatcommands without the command particle are perhaps more deferential, or more familiar, or at any rate lessperemptory, than commands followed by the command particle; at least commands without -TSig seem topredominate in prayers directed to the gods.1412 This is so even where the imperative stem is not phonologically distinctive: for example, we find theimperative stem khyer < KHER-s \"take!\" (identical with the past stem khyer < b-KHYER-s \"took\" andfuture stem khyer < b-KHYER \"will take\") when Mi-la says to the wind ras dga-na ras khyer \"If you wantmy robe, take my robe!\" It is thus true as well for intransitive verbs, which generally have no distinctiveimperative stem: in the biography of Mi-la, for example, we find both na-rgyal ma-tshe-zig \"Let not yourpride be great!'' with the command particle, and nan ma-thun ''Let not your patience be short!\" without it.13 In the archaic manuscripts from Central Asia, commands are most often marked with the command particle;in some manuscripts we find the form -dzig where in later texts we expect to find -zig. There is littleconsistency in the use of imperative stems; for example, the -s suffix is often omitted, but the -sig allomorph ofthe command particle is used anyway, as if the final or postfinal -s were present. The following are typicalexamples from the archaic texts-tshan lud-dzig zan byin-tshig, rol-mo rtsed-mo byo-sig \"Give beer! Offerfood! Make music and sport!\" tshigs Ndi yi-ger bris-la gtsig-gis gtsig ston-dzig \"Write these words in lettersand show them one to the other,\" phai sid thon-sig yab-ki mdad-rman tshugs-sig \"Make your father's funeralfeast, build your lord's funeral pyre!\" g.yag sna ni rtswa zo-sig, rta Npyi-na ni tshu Nthun-sig \"Let the yak eatgrass before, let the horse drink water after!\" bya Npar-ba ni ma-bzun-sig, mtshig khan-mo ni ma-Nbub-sig,khyi sbag-pha ni ma-bskan-ig \"Don't grasp at a soaring bird; don't put a roof on a ruined house; don't satisfy amangy dog!\"14 Thus, for example, we find this refrain in a prayer written by Kon-sprul rin-po-tshe gsol-ba Ndebs-so thugs-dam zal-bzes dgons, smon-lam yons-su Ngrub-par byin-gyis rlobs \"Thus I pray.

Polite and Elegant CommandsOne way to moderate the peremptoriness of a command is to nominalize the proposition and use it as acomplement or patient of the imperative stem of a polite or elegant verbfor example, the imperative stem mdzod ofthe honorific verb MDZAD \"do,\" or the (irregular) imperative stem gyis of the elegant verb BGYI \"do.\" Suchcomplements and patients are most often nominalized with -Pathus the elegant commands rgyal-bu ma-sor-bagyis-ig \"Do not let the prince escape!\" on-kyan log-lta ma-skyes-pa gyis \"Well, don't get any wrong ideas,\" wherethe nominalized proposition is a patient; and nai mthus nan-son-du mi-skye-bas dga-bargyis-sig \"Since, by mymagic power, you will not be born in an evil destiny, be happy!\" khyod-ran na ma-brdzed-par gyis \"Do not forgetme,\" where the nominalized proposition is a complement.

Impersonal CommandsWe also find complement constructions with the anomalous imperative stem sog \"Come!\"15 These constructionsgenerally function as optatives or IMPERSONAL COMMANDSfor example, sgrub-la bar-tshad med-par sog\"Let it come to pass that there are no obstacles to our meditation!\" bu-lon gtonmkhan-laan ma-skyes-par sog, bu-lon len-mkhan-laan ma-skyes-par sog \"May you not be born as a moneylender!

RequestsIn English, not all commands are imperatives: statements (Shoes will not be worn in the gym)and questions (Couldyou shut that window for me?)can function as commands as well. In Tibetan, we find first-person statements withthe verbs Zu \"request\" and GSOL \"pray\" used with complements as very polite commands: we will call suchconstructions REQUESTS. 17 Thus we find, for example, bla-mas tshos bstan-par gsol \"I pray the lama to teachthe dharma,\" Nkhor-bai mtsho-las sgrol-du gsol ''I pray that I be delivered from the ocean of transmigration,\" bla-ma dgons-su gsol \"I pray the lama to think of me!'' In the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, the wife of his master Mar-papleads with her husband bu Ndi-la tshos-sig gnan-bar zu \"I ask you to give this boy some dharma!/Please give thisboy some dharma!\" and Mi-la says to his master thugs-rdzes Ndzin-par zu \"I ask that you hold me withcompassion!\"16 Sometimes, of course, the nominalizer -Pa and adverb particle are omitted, primarily for metricalreasons-for example, Ngro-rnams bla-med thar-pai sarphyin sog \"May all beings reach the incomparablestage of freedom!\" dge-bas Ngro kun gnas-skabs mthar-thug-gi, bde-legs rgya-mtshoi dpal-Nbyor myurthob sog \"By this virtue, may all beings quickly attain the glory of the ocean of temporal and ultimatebliss!\" Such constructions remain different from the consecutive imperative constructions discussed in thefootnote above.17 In the archaic translation of the Saddharmapundarika found in manuscript at Khotan, we find suchexpressions as gsun-sig \"Speak!\" lun-stond-tsig \"Prophesy!\" ston \"Teach!\" By the time of the canonicaltranslation, these same commands were translated as the requests bstan-du gsol \"I pray you teach,\" lun-btsangsol \"I pray you prophesy,\" and bstan gsol \"I pray you teach,\" respectively. < previous pagepage_367next page >"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"page_368file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_368.html[8/7/2010 9:55:38 PM]< previous pagepage_368next page >Page 368Sometimes, using the same construction, a speaker will ask for something which it is entirely within his power todo. This translates a bit strangely into English. Such requests are perhaps best translated as requests for permission,I am not very interested in the formal possibilities offered by a system like language. Personally, I am above all haunted by the existence of DISCOURSES, by the fact that speaking has taken place as an event in relation to an original situation, and has left traces which continue to exist and exercise, in their very subsistence within history, any number of manifest or secret functions.Michel Foucault, Sur les façons d'érire histoirealthough that certainly does not appear on the surface in the Tibetan. When Mar-pa has Mi-la choose betweengetting the teachings from Mar-pa and food and clothes from elsewhere, or getting food and clothes from Mar-paand the teachings from someone else, Mi-la says lto gos gzan-nas Ntshol-bar zu \"I ask that I seek food and clothesfrom elsewhere.\" When Mi-la wants to return home briefly, he tells Mar-palan-tsig yul-du gton-bar zu zabs-phyir myur-du on-bar zuI ask that you let me go one time to my country; I ask that I quickly return to your presence.5.5. Linked ImperativesA command is frequently part of a series of instructions, so commands frequently come in bunches. One way thatimperatives are linked together is simply by a sequence of command sentences which are made cohesive throughcommon participants, duly omitted in the second sentencethus Ndzig-rten-du yan-dag-par sgrogs-sig ston-tsig\"Teach it, proclaim it well in the world!\" Or a series of instructions can be conveyed through several proposi- < previous pagepage_368next page >"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"page_369file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_369.html[8/7/2010 9:55:39 PM]< previous pagepage_369next page >Page 369tions with past or present stems linked by conjunction or embedding, and made into a command sentence with afinal imperative verb stem and command particlefor example, gdams-nag Ndi legs-par ñan-nasyid-la zuns-ig\"Having listened well to this teaching, hold it in your mind!\"By and large, however, we find a sequence of instructions conveyed by a series of implicitly nominalizedimperative stems linked by the locus particle -lafor example, sog-la ltos-sig \"Come and see!\" mi de zuns-la sod-tsig \"Seize that man and kill him!\" lons-la son-zig \"Take it and go!\" skyol-la sog \"Bring him here!'' For reasons Ido not understand, -la is the only particle used when a nominalized proposition with an imperative stem is in thesetting slot. I do know the construction is old in Tibetan; in the archaic manuscripts from Central Asia we find, forexample, tshigs Ndi yi-ger bris-la gtsig-gis gtsig ston-dzig \"Write these words in letters and show them one to theother,'' lha-la phyag-Ntshol-la tshigs Ndi skadu byo-sig \"Let us worship the gods and say these words.\"185.6. The Informal Command ParticleOne modal performative is found with commands: we will call this the COMMAND modal. The particle -dan (andits variant -an)occurs where a speaker is issuing a command informally or casually: the particle thus constituteswhat we will call an INFORMAL COMMAND PERFORMATIVE. This less peremptory command mode seems toappear first in the more colloquial literature influenced by Middle Tibetan, such as the prose portions of thebiography and songs of Mi-la ras-pa, perhaps around the fourteenth century; by the middle of the eighteenthcentury the grammatical commentator Mkhas-grub dam-pa gives the particle -dan simply as an alternative to -TSig. In the literature we find such examples as ri-mo bris-dan \"Draw a picture, OK?\" sdod-an \"Please just stay,\"yid-la byos-sig-dan bsad-do \"Just pay attention and I'll explain it,\" khyod-rnams legs-par mthon-dan \"Look at itwell, OK?\" yid-la byos-sig-dan \"Hey, pay attention!\" Dpal-sprul rin-po-tshe uses18 Further examples from the biography of Mi-la include rdo-rdze Ndii dri-ma bum-tshu Ndis khrus-largyal-mtshan-gyi rtse-la phyor-tsig \"Cleanse the dirt on this vajra with this holy water, and hoist it to thetop of the banner!\" mtshod-rten Ndi-la rab-gnas gyis-la rii rtser zog \"Consecrate this reliquary and place iton the top of the mountain!\" za-ma bzan-ba-zig gyis-la nai rtsar khrid zog \"Make some good food andbring it to me!\" sñin-rus skyed-la sgoms-sig \"Put forth courage, and meditate!\" khru Ndi rem-la slogs-sig\"Exert yourself and plough!\" < previous pagepage_369next page >"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"page_370file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_370.html[8/7/2010 9:55:40 PM]< previous pagepage_370next page >Page 370the particle in a story to show the naivete of a country bumpkin who comes to Lhasa City and invites themiraculous image of the Buddha to visit him at home, saying na-ran-tshoi yul-du sog-dan \"Hey, come on over toour place!\" Mar-pa, showing some rare sympathy for the labors of the young Mi-la, says mthu-tshen sgal-pa ston-dan \"Great Magician, let me take a look at your sores.\" Mi-la's mother, rejoicing at his destruction of their wickedkinsmen, exults na myan-tsha dkar-rgyan-gyis gos hrul gyon lto nan zos-nas bui rgyags sbyans-pa-la don-byun e-Ndug ltos-dan... . a myan-tsha dkar-rgyan-la da-lanlas ñams-dga-ba e-yon ltos-dan ''I, Myan-tsha dkar-rgyan,wore ragged clothes and ate bad food, but just look whether there has been a profit from providing my son withprovisions! ...

VocativesA VOCATIVE is a nominal phrase, added optionally to any sentence, denoting the person to whom it is addressedand signalling the fact that it is addressed to him. A vocative is not part of the propositional structure of thesentence. One function of the vocative is to seek the attention of the person addressed, and especially to single himout from others who may be within hearing: here personal names, titles, or special terms of address may be used toidentify the addressee. Another function, perhaps more subtle, is to express the attitude of the speaker toward theaddressee, insofar as the vocative phrase incorporates terms of respect, familiarity, or contempt.6.1. Initial And Final VocativesIn Tibetan the majority of such vocatives occur in initial position: for example, Mi-la addresses a stranger with thewords drun-pa lags \"O Sir . . .\" before speaking to him;19 the wife of Mar-pa similarly first addresses her husbandwith the title bla-ma rin-po-tshe \"Precious lama . . .\"; and Mar-pa addresses his disciple Tshos-sku rdo-rdze byboth geographical and personal names as rnog-ston tshos-rdor \"Reality Diamond, teacher of Rnog . . .\" Mi-la19 As Matthew Kapstein has pointed out to me, the term drun-pa usually refers to the closest personalattendant or private secretary of an aristocratic or ecclesiastical hierarch.

This is not uncommon in commands: for example, in a prayer to Avalokitesvara, traditionallyascribed to the great king Sron-btsan sgam-po, we find a series of lines such as dag-pai zin-la skyol-zig spyan-ras-gzigs \"Lead me to the Pure Land, O Avalokitesvara!\" and rgyun-du thugs-rdzes gzigs-sig spyan-ras-gzigs \"Everlook on me with compassion, O Avalokitesvara!\" Similarly, in the work of the poet Pad-ma dkar-po we find suchverses as sa-smos ser-ba-las sruns-sig snagsNtshan-gi nag-po \"Protect my lotus flowers from the hailstorm, Oblackness of sorcerors!\" and blo re-ltos tshol-zig skal-ldan-tsho \"Let your minds be full of hope, O my disciples!''But such extraposition is also found in statements. Pad-ma dkar-po is fond of such constructions; in one poem, hebuilds a structure upon repeated verses with extraposed vocative phrasesthus nags-mtha sñegs-pa-la mi-dga stag-phrug-gi gzon-nu \"You have no joy dashing about the woods, O young tiger!\" nam-Nphan spyod-pa-la mi-dgathan-dkar-gyigzon-nu \"You have no joy soaring in the sky, O young condor!\" rgyal-khams Ngrim-pa-la mi-dgabstan-Ndzin-gyi gzon-nu \"You have no joy wandering in the world, O young disciple!\" In another poem he usesthe repeated refrain yid gzuns-nas sgoms-ig pad-ma dkar \"Meditate with heedful mind, O Pad-ma dkar-po!\" andthen, in the last verse, switches to dbyans mtshod-par Nbul-lo dkon-mtshog gsum \"I give my song in offering, OThree Jewels!\"6.2. Titles Of RespectNominal phrases containing titles of respect are often used vocatively. Among such titles of respect perhaps themost frequently encountered is lags, either used by itself in the sense of \"Sir . . .\" or added to other titles, personalnames, epithets, or kinship terms. Thus Mi-la addresses a stranger as drun-pa lags \"O Sir .. .\" and his master Mar-pa as bla-ma lags \"O lama . . .\" The yogin Mi-la is himself addressed by his disciple Ras-tshun-pa as rdze-btsun < previous pagepage_371next page >"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"page_372file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_372.html[8/7/2010 9:55:41 PM]< previous pagepage_372next page >Page 372lags \"O reverend sir . .\" The Grand Secretary of Tibet is properly addressed as sku-gzogs rtse-drun lags\"Honorable Mister Secretary ...\"Other titles of respect encountered as vocatives in the classical texts include the secular gtso-bo \"my lord\"andgtso-mo \"my lady,\" the religious rdze-btsun ''reverend sir'' and rdze-btsun-ma \"reverend madam,\" and theintimate bzin-bzan \"handsome sir\" and bzin-bzan-ma \"fairfaced lady.\" Such terms may form part of a morecomplex nominal: in the drama Snan-sa od-Nbum we find a man addressing his wife as tshe-rabs kun-gyi gtan-grogs bzin-bzan-ma \"O fairfaced constant wife through all my former lives ...\"Another series of terms, including sku-gzogs, sku-nos, sku-mdun, and sku-drun, is found in the texts, all meaning\"your honorable presence\" and used in direct address to a social or spiritual superior. The term sku-gzogs is oftenwritten as <sku-zabs>\"honorable feet,\" in imitation of Indic terms of address; but the original orthography is stillreflected in such pronunciations as New Tibetan (Dbus) kuso.An important and frequently encountered title of respect is rin-po-tshe \"precious one,\" used almost exclusively inaddressing high lamas. The Dalai Lama is addressed as rgya-mtsho rin-po-tshe \"Precious Ocean\" or rgyal-ba rin-po-tshe \"Precious Conqueror,\" the Panchen Lama as pan-tshen rin-po-tshe \"Precious Scholar,\" and, at one time,the King of Bhutan as zabs-drun rin-po-tshe \"Precious Feet.\"20 We find Mar-pa addressed as bla-ma rin-po-tshe\"Precious lama\" by his wife, by Mi-la, and by other lamas who are his disciples.Such titles of respect reach their most flowery expression in the Tibetan epistolary style. For example, a letter tothe Dalai Lama is sent with the honorific salutationNgro-ba lha-dan btsas-pai mgon-skyabs dpun-gñen mtshuns-zla ma-mtshis-par rgyal-bai dban-po thams-tsad mkhyen-tsin gzigs-pa tshen-po zabs-stegs gser-gyi Ndab-ston rnam-par bzad-pai drun-du...20 The king of Bhutan was called zabs-drun when Bhutan had a common temporal and spiritual head.Under the present dynasty Bhutan is ruled by a rgyal-po~tshos-rgyal \"king\" and the highest ecclesiasticaloffice is that of rdze mkhan-po \"lord abbot.\" < previous pagepage_372next page >"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"page_373file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_373.html[8/7/2010 9:55:41 PM]< previous pagepage_373next page >Page 373Before the honorable presence of the smiling golden thousandpetal lotus footstool of the great all-knowingall-seeing Lor dBuddha who is the peerless friend and refuge of all beings including the gods . . .6.3. Other Vocative ExpressionsWe find other nominals used in vocative phrases to indicate the relative status of the person addressed. Suchvocatives may use pejoratives, as when Mi-la says ñan-tsig dman-mo khyod \"Listen, you lowly demoness!\" ornan-pa gña-rens ser-smug gtam Ndi ñon \"Ser-smug you wicked stiff-necked one, hear this word!\" Other vocativesmay use respectful older relative terms, such as a-dzo \"older brother'' and a-tshe \"older sister,'' not infrequentlywith lags or other titles of respect, as in a-tshe lags rin-po-tshe \"O precious older sister . .\" Other vocatives mayuse intimate younger relative terms such as bu \"son,\" tsha-bo \"nephew,\" bu-mo mdzes-pa \"darling daughter.\"What we can call professional titles are frequently used vocativelybla-ma \"lama,\" sprul-sku \"incarnation,\" mkhan-po \"abbot,\" khri-tshen \"abbot,\" dge-bses \"professor,\" dbu-mdzad \"head monk,\" dge-slon \"monk,\" mo-btsun \"nun,\"lha \"king,\" blon-tshen \"minister of state,\" sde-srid \"regent,\" lha-rdze \"physician,\" yon-bdag \"lay patron.\" Hereagain we often find lags or other titles of respect added to the addressee's professional title.216.4. The Structure of Tibetan NamesQuite frequently a vocative phrase contains the addressee's name. Since persons-especially eminent personsmaypossess several types of names and titles simultaneously, it may be helpful here to discuss the structure of suchnames as may be encountered in the classical texts.21 We may note here that vocative PLURALS are often formed with -dag both in translations fromSanskrit and in classical literature-thus dge-slon-dag \"O monks . . .\" kye bzin-bzan-dag \"O handsome sirs .. .\" ses-ldan-dag \"O learned sirs . . .\" kye grogs-po-dag \"O friends . . .\" The interjection kye~kwa~ka-ye~kwa-ye is sometimes used to indicate a vocative term, especially in the translation literature, although itis found elsewhere as wellthus kye lhai lha \"O lord of lords . . .\" kye kha-lo bsgyur-ba \"O helmsman . . .\"bdag-la dgons-sig mgon-po kye \"Think of me, O lord!\" < previous pagepage_373next page >"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"page_374file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_374.html[8/7/2010 9:55:42 PM]< previous pagepage_374next page >Page 3746.4.1. Personal namesThe vast majority of Tibetan religious namesand the great majority of secular namesconsist of combinations ofdisyllabic terms with auspicious connotations. These terms may denote such auspicious objects as ñi-ma \"sun,\"zla-ba \"moon,\" rdo-rdze \"vajra,\" rgya-mtsho \"ocean,'' rtse-mo \"peak,'' rgya-mtshan \"banner,\" pad-ma \"lotus,\" nor-bu \"gem,\" sen-ge \"lion,\" rgyal-po \"king,\" and gzon-nu \"prince\"; such auspicious qualities as mthu-stobs \"strength,\"bsod-nams \"merit,\" tshul-khrims \"discipline,\" bstan-Ndzin \"adherence to the teachings,\" bzan-po \"virtue,\" tshos-Nphel \"religious increase,\" Ngyur-med \"constancy,\" grags-pa \"fame,\" dban-phyug \"dominion,\" blo-gros\"intelligence,\" tshe-rin \"long life,\" yon-tan \"excellence,\" rnam-rgyal \"victory,\" bkra-sis \"blessing,\" don-grub\"success,\" phrin-las \"activity,\" ye-ses \"knowledge,\" and ses-rab \"wisdom\"; and such divine names as sans-rgyas\"Buddha,\" kun-dga \"joy  Ananda,\" sgrol-ma \"savioress  Tara,\" ddzam-dpal \"sweet glory  Mañjusri,\" Ndzam-dbyans \"sweet voice  Mañjughosa,\" byams-pa \"friendliness  Maitreya.\"And I said, \"Hey, pal, what's going on here?

Types of personal namesA person may possess several personal names in the course of a lifetime. Every child has a CHILDHOOD NAME,often bestowed by a respected elder or lama, and established at a naming celebration; a child may in addition haveone or more PET NAMES which can change in the course of time. Mi-la raspa's father gives his child thechildhood name thos-pa dga \"Happy to Hear It,\" since he is so pleased to hear the news of the birth; Mi-la's sisteris similarly given the childhood name mgon-mo skyid \"Lady Joy,\" as well as the pet name pe-ta \"Little Leech,\" bywhich Mi-la continues to address her even after she is an adult. Sometimes the name includes the day on which thechild was bornfor example, ñi-ma lha-mo \"Sunday Goddess,\" pa-sans sgrol-ma \"Friday Tara.\" Often this DAY-NAME is only tentative, and a new name is given at the first opportunity to have the child blessed by a lama,although often the day-name sticks anyway. In addition, any of these names can be changed for astrologicalreasons, if the name in use seems to be attended by bad luck. < previous pagepage_375next page >"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"page_376file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_376.html[8/7/2010 9:55:43 PM]< previous pagepage_376next page >Page 376When a person enters the monastery, he is given a new name, usually at the time of taking the vows of a novice,although in some cases he may receive a further new name at the time of taking the complete vows of a monk. Atypical account of such names is found in the contemporary autobiography of a Sherpa lama, who writes,btsas-ston yan rgyas-par byas-nas min-la gza-dan bstun-te, zla-ba bstan-Ndzin zes btags Ndug-go ... ranlo ñer-gtsig-la bslebs-dus bla-ma sans-rgyas tshos-Nphel-gyi drun-nas so-thar dge-tshul sdom-pai barlegs-par zus-pas, min mkhan-poi mtshan-nas dran-ste, sans-rgyas zla-ba zes btagsAfter having a big birth party, they connected my name with the day of the week and called me zla-babstan-Ndzin \"Monday Adherent\" . . . When I turned twenty-one I duly asked the lama sans-rgyas tshos-Nphel \"Buddha's Dharma Increase\" for ordination up through the vows of a novice, and I was given thename sans-rgyas zla-ba \"Buddha Monday\" after the name of my preceptor.Similarly, Mar-pa ordains his disciple Mi-la as a novice monk with the name rdo-rdze rgyal-mtshan \"DiamondBanner,\" after a prophetic dream he had the evening before the two first met.In addition to this MONASTIC NAME, a monk or layman may receive a BODHI-SATTVA NAME when hetakes his vow to save all sentient creatures; and he may receive from his tantric teacheror even from the deityitselfa SECRET NAME when he is initiated into the ritual practices of a tantric deity. Thus Mi-la describes theacquisition of his secret name as follows:Nkhor-lo sdom-pa-la yul ñi-su-rtsa bzi, gnas sum-tsu-rtsa gñis, dur-khrod tshen-po brgyad-kyi dpa-bo-danmkha-Ngros bskor-nas khra-lam-me bzugs-pa dnos-su mthon, dei tshe bla-ma-dan dkyil-Nkhor-gyi lhasmgrin gtsig-tu gsan-mtshan dpal bzad-pa rdo-rdzer btagsI vividly saw the deity Cakrasamvara clearly seated there, surrounded by the gods and goddesses of thetwenty-four lands, the thirty-two places, the eight great cemeteries; and at that time the lama and the godsof the mandala with one voice gave < previous pagepage_376next page >"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"page_377file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_377.html[8/7/2010 9:55:43 PM]< previous pagepage_377next page >Page 377me the secret name dpal bzad-pa rdo-rdze \"Glory Laughter Diamond.\"A writer may become known under one or more of these different names, and he may even sign his works with acombination of them.

After advanced instruction in Sanskrit and poetics, ascholar may be given a GRAMMARIAN'S NAME, which he signs to works on grammar, lexicography, andrhetoric. A religious practitioner who is a gter-ston \"discoverer of hidden treasures\"and thus able to locate thehidden texts concealed by the ancient Padmasambhavamay, upon his appointment by an already practicingdiscoverer, be given in addition a special DISCOVERER'S NAME, the particular name having been prophesied byPadmasambhava and appearing in the hidden texts themselves.6.4.3. Geographical and family namesIndividuals are often differentiated by a GEOGRAPHICAL NAME. The person's place of birth or area of majorreligious activity may simply be prefixed to his personal name, as in bo-don ri-tshen rtse-mo \"Jewel Peak of Bo-don,\" rtseg dban-phyug sen-ge \"Dominion Lion of Rtseg,\" sde-dge blo-gros rgyal-mtshan \"Intelligence Banner ofSde-dge.\" Frequently we find the person's geographical provenance followed by the formative -pa ''PERSONHAVING TO DO WITH,\" as in mar-pa rdo-rdze ye-ses \"Diamond Knowledge the man from Mar,'' gñal-pa ñi-mases-rab \"Sun Wisdom the man from Gñal,\" khams-pa ses-rab rdo-rdze \"Wisdom Diamond the man from Khams.\"Indeed, a famous scholar or contemplative may be more widely known by his geographical name than by any ofhis personal names: for example, Tshos-kyi blo-gros is widely known simply as mar-pa \"the man from Mar,\" Blo-bzan grags-pa as tson-kha-pa \"the < previous pagepage_377next page >"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"page_378file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_378.html[8/7/2010 9:55:44 PM]< previous pagepage_378next page >Page 378man from Tson-kha,\" and Zla-od gzon-nu as sgam-po-pa \"the man from Sgam-po.\"Sometimes geographic affiliations are expressed with the word ston \"teacher\" or lo-tsa-ba \"translator\" suffixed tothe person's geographic area: thus we find rgya-ston gzon-nu sen-ge \"Prince Lion the teacher of Rgya,'' zan-stonbsod-nams grags-pa \"Merit Fame the teacher of Zan,\" go-rub lo-tsa-ba tshos-kyi ses-rab \"Wisdom of Dharma thetranslator of Go-rub,'' Ngos lo-tsa-ba gzon-nu dpal \"Prince Glory the translator of Ngos.\" Such geographic titlesare also found in clipped form, as in stag-lo gzon-nu brtson-Ngrus \"Prince Striving the translator of Stag\" or smin-glin Ngyur-med rdo-rdze \"Unchanging Diamond the lama of Smin-grol monastery.\" A famous teacher or translatormay be widely known by such geographic title alone: for example, Nam-mkha grags-pa is often referred to simplyas mtshims-ston \"the teacher of Mtshims,\" and Tshul-khrims rgyal-ba is often referred to simply as nag-tsho lo-tsa-ba \"the translator of Nag-tsho.\"Incarnations may have geographical names with the suffix sprul-sku \"incarnation,\" as in bde-than sprul-sku blo-bzan tshul-khrims rnam-rgyal \"Intelligence Virtue Discipline Victory the incarnation of Bde-than,\" or phur-bu-ltsog sprul-sku byams-pa tshul-khrims bstan-Ndzin \"Friendliness Discipline Adherent the incarnation of Phur-bu-ltsog.\" Famous incarnations again may be referred to by this geographic title alone: for example, Yon-tan rgya-mtsho is widely known as kon-sprul rin-po-tshe, the term kon-sprul being a clipped form of the geographicalname kon-po sprul-sku \"the incarnation of Kon-po,\" since the monk of whom he was held to be an incarnationcame originally from Kon-po. Similarly, the contemporaneous Ndzigs-med tshos-kyi dban-po is widely known asdpal-sprul rin-po-tshe, the term dpal-sprul again being a clipped form of the geographical name dpal-dge sprul-sku \"the incarnation of Dpal-dge,\" since he was held to be an incarnation of Dpal-dge Bsod-nams sbyin-pa.Sometimes the various incarnations of a single spiritual progenitor are distinguished by geographical names. Forexample, Ndzam-dbyans mkhyen-brtsei dban-po kun-dga bstan-pai rgyal-mtshan has been held to be incarnate inseveral different persons simultaneously in several monastic centers: thus we find rdzon-sar mkhyen-brtse Ndzam-dbyans tshos-kyi dban-po \"Sweet Voice Master of Dharma the Mkhyen-brtse at Rdzon-sar,\" dpal-spuns mkhyen-brtse karma mkhyen-brtsei od-zer \"Karma Light of Knowledge and Love the Mkhyen-brtse at Dpal-spuns,\" dis-mgo mkhyen-brtse rab-gsal zla-ba \"Clarity < previous pagepage_378next page >"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"page_379file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_379.html[8/7/2010 9:55:44 PM]< previous pagepage_379next page >Page 379Moon the Mkhyen-brtse at Dis-mgo,\" rdzogs-tshen mkhyen-brtse gu-ru tshe-dban \"Guru Lifepower the Mkhyen-brtse at Rdzogs-tshen,\" and so on.Additionally, names may incorporate FAMILY NAMES. The great-great-grandfather of Mi-la ras-pa acquired thename mi-la when he conquered an evil demon, who cried out in fearpha ma mi-la mi-la \"Father! Mother! Woe!Woe!\" This name was passed on to his son Mi-la Mdo-ston sen-ge, who passed it on to his son Mi-la Rdo-rdzesen-ge, who passed it on to his son Mi-la Ses-rab rgyal-mtshan, who passed it on to his son called Thos-pa dga.Similarly we find such combinations of family and personal names as Nkhon dkon-mtshog rgyal-po \"Jewel King ofthe Nkhon,\" rgya ye-ses mgon-po \"Knowledge Protector of the Rgya,\" myan ses-rab Nbyun-gnas \"Wisdom Sourceof the Myan.\" Sometimes family names and geographical names overlap, where a family has the same name as itshereditary estate.6.4.4. EpithetsIn addition to such names, persons may acquire EPITHETS in the course of their lives, and it may be by such anepithet that a person is best known. The epithet may be professional, as in sde-srid sans-rgyas rgya-mtsho\"Buddha Ocean the Regent,\" dar-han em-tshi Ndzam-dbyans rgyal-mtshan \"Sweet Voice Banner the Physician ofDar-han,\" dga-ldan khri-tshen nag-dban tshul-khrims \"Master of Speech Discipline the Abbot of Dga-ldan,\" spyi-khyab mkhan-po bde-tshen rgya-mtsho \"Bliss Ocean the Abbot of Spyi-khyab.\" Sgam-po-pa is often referred tosimply as dwags-po lha-rdze ''the Physician of Dwags-po,'' and Mi-la becomes known as mthu-tshen \"Magician\"after he demonstrates his professional abilities to his master Mar-pa:thugs sñun-bai mi man-po gri-khar si-ba gzigs-nas, khyod-la mthu tshen-po yod zer-ba bden-par Nduggsuns-nas na-la min mthu-tshen-du btagsHe saw many maddened men die at knife-point. He said, \"It's true what they say, that you have magicpower\"; and he gave me the name mthu-tshen \"Magician.\"An epithet may also be honorific, as when the first Black Hat Karma-pa Tshos-kyi grags-pa is known almostexclusively as dus-gsum mkhyen-pa \"He Who Knows the Past, Present, and Future,\" or the fifth Black Hat Karma-pa < previous pagepage_379next page >"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"page_380file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_380.html[8/7/2010 9:55:45 PM]< previous pagepage_380next page >Page 380Tshos-dpal bzan-po is known almost exclusively as de-bzin gsegs-pa \"He Who Has Thus Come,\" an epithet of theBuddha. The name of the great yogini Ma-gtsig Lab-kyi sgron-ma combines the geographical name Lab-phyi andthe childhood name sgron-ma \"Lady Lamp\" with the honorific epithet ma-gtsig \"The One Mother.\" We may notehere too that certain general honorific expressions have become specialized as such personal epithets: for example,unless otherwise specified, the expression dzo-bo rdze ''Venerable Lord\" refers to Atisa, rdze-btsun \"Reverend Sir''refers to Mi-la, rdze rin-po-tshe \"Precious Lord\" refers to Tson-kha-pa, and gu-ru rin-po-dshe \"Precious Guru\"refers to Padmasambhava.An epithet may also be generic. For example, a yogin often bears the epithet ras-pa \"one who wears a cottoncloth\" combined with some individuating component: thus Mgon-po rdo-rdze is called khyi-ra-ba ras-pa \"HunterYogin,\" after his former occupation; Pad-ma rdo-rdze is called glin ras-pa \"Yogin of Glin,\" after his geographicprovenance; the young Thos-pa dga eventually becomes known as Mi-la ras-pa \"Yogin of the Mi-la,\" after hisfamily name. Similarly, Ye-ses rdo-rdze is known as gtsan-pa rgya-ras \"Yogin of the Rgya family from Gtsan,\" ina clipped form that combines both geographical and family names with his epithet.A similar generic epithet is smyon-pa \"madman,\" used of the crazy and iconoclastic saint of the yogic tradition, asin such names as dbus-smyon kun-dga bzan-po \"Joy Virtue the madman of Dbus,\" or Nbrug-smyon kun-dga legs-pa \"Joy Goodness the madman of the Nbrug.\" The author of the life of Mi-la ras-pa and the editor of his collectedsongs began life with the childhood name tshos-rgyal lhun-po \"Dharma King Mountain,\" became a novice monkwith the monastic name sans-rgyas rgyal-mtshan \"Buddha Banner,\" and received the secret name khrag-Nthunrgyal-po \"Blood-drinking King\" from his tutelary deity; but he is best knownand is spoken of in his earliestbiographyby the epithet gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka \"Heruka the madman of Gtsan.\"An epithet may also be descriptive: such epithets are idiosyncratic to the persons who bear them. Rdo-rdze grags-pa, the disciple of Mi-la ras-pa, is called ras-tshun-pa \"Little Piece of Cotton\" because he wears only a small pieceof cotton cloth; Mgon-po rdo-rdze is said to have worked so tirelessly for his fellow contemplatives at Tsa-ri thathe became known to them as rdza-khrod bon-ser \"Yellow Donkey of the Claypits.\" Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka signedhis biography of Mar-pa with the epithet dur-khrod myul-bai mal-Nbyor-pa < previous pagepage_380next page >"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"page_381file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_381.html[8/7/2010 9:55:45 PM]< previous pagepage_381next page >Page 381\"Yogin Who Wanders in Cemeteries\" and his biography of Mi-la with the epithet rus-pai rgyan-tsan \"He WhoHas Ornaments of one,\" while Ndzigs-med tshos-kyi dban-pothe great Dpal-sprul rin-po-tshesigned his workswith the epithet a-bu hral-po ''Ragged Old Fellow.\"226.4.5. Names and epithets in vocative phrasesPersonal names are often found in vocative phrases, used both by friends and intimates of the addressee and by hissuperiors. It is interesting to note, for example, that in the works of Gtsan-smyon he-ru-ka the lama Mar-paaddresses his wife Bdag-med-ma by her personal name, while she addresses him by his title as bla-ma rin-po-tshe\"precious lama.\" Similarly Mar-pa addresses his disciple Rniog-pa by both family and personal names, using theform rnog-ston tshos-rdor, while the disciple again uses bla-ma rin-po-tshe in reply.His instructors in black magic address Mi-la by his personal name thos-pa dga, while both Mar-pa and Rnog-paaddress him by his epithet mthu-tshen \"Magician,\" occasionally with the affectionate prefix a-bo added; Mi-la inturn addresses all his teachers as bla-ma lags or bla-ma rin-po-tshe. The relation between Mi-la and his owndisciples is the same: Rdo-rdze grags-pa addresses his master as bla-ma rdze-btsun rin-po-tshe \"precious reverendlama\" or rdze-btsun rin-po-tshe lags \"precious reverend sir,'' while Mi-la22 The names of horses are also found in classical Tibetan. In the rta-rgyug \"horse race\" chapter of the epicof Ge-sar we find a long list of the participating horses and their ridersthe equivalent of a Homericcatalogue of ships.

ExclamationsAn EXCLAMATION is a partial sentencesometimes called a \"sentence fragment\" or \"minor sentence\"thatfunctions as an autonomous unit similar to a sentence. An exclamation may be found anywhere a sentence may befound, either within a discourse or embedded in a proposition as the patient of a verb such as GSUN \"say\" orSÑAM \"think.\"1.1. Hypothetical ExpressionsSome sentences, of course, are assertions with exclamatory force. The verbs LEGS \"be good\" and RUN \"be right\"are often used in such a waythus legs-so \"Very well! Excellent!\" run gsuns \"'All right!' he said.\" We often findsuch HYPOTHETICAL constructions as nus-na sin-tu legs ''If you can do it, very well!\" sgom-tshen kha-rogssdod-na legs ''A meditator had best stay quiet!\" rgyal-po gzan-gyis bdag-po byed-na mi-legs \"Another king hadbetter not become her husband!\" mi-rñed-na mi-run \"We'd better find it!\" tsi-ltar byed-na legs \"What should I do?\"Even stronger exclamatory force is found in hypothetical constructions with the expressions tsi ma-legs~tsi ma-run\"What's wrong with that?\"1 For example, we find bsam-na tsi ma-legs \"What's wrong with thinking about it?/Youought to think about it!\" de Nbyun-na tsi ma-run \"Would that it happened!/Oh, may it happen!\" Ndii ze-sdan Ndizi-na tsi ma-run \"Best I quiet this anger of his!\" na rig-pa-dan ldan-na tsi ma-run \"Would that I were wise!\"1 Compare also the expression lta-tsi-smos~lta-smos-tsi-dgos \"what need to say, need I mention, dare Iadd, to say nothing of, what more of,\" as in Ndi-dag Ndul-ba lta-tsi-smos \". . . to say nothing of theconversion of these!\" mirgyur-ba yan rñed-pardka-na dal-ba phun-sum-tshogs-pa lta-tsi-smos \"If it'sdifficult to be born as a human being, what then of perfect liberty!\" < previous pagepage_383next page >"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"page_384file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_384.html[8/7/2010 9:55:47 PM]< previous pagepage_384next page >Page 384nai bu-mo min-na tsi ma-run \"Would that she were not my daughter!\" semstsan thams-tsad sdug-bsnal-dan Nbral-na tsi ma-run \"Oh that all sentient beings were free from suffering!\" Ndi Ndra-bai sdug-bsnal Nkhur-ba-las Ntshi-na tsi ma-run \"Better I should die than bear such suffering!\"1.2. Hypothetical EllipsisSuch exclamatory hypothetical SENTENCES can become EXCLAMATIONS by omission of the consequent,leaving only the antecedent locus participant in the setting slot, rather like English exclamations in the form Ifonly... Thus, in addition to, say, de Nbyun-na legs \"If it happens, it would be good,\" we find, simply, de Nbyung-na\"If only it would happen!\" and, in addition to, say, Ndi bdag-gi yin-na tsi ma-run \"Would that this were mine!\" wefind, simply, Ndi bdag-gi yin-na \"If only this were mine!'' For example, in the Tibetan translation of theKarmasataka we read kye-ma rgyal-po tshen-po na blta-bai phyir ons-na \"Oh, if only the great king has come tosee me!\" and, in the biography of Mi-la, we find sems-tsan man-po si-na Ntshens-te sñam ''I thought happily, 'Ifonly many sentient creatures had died!\"'1.3. Exclamations in -Pa-laAnother form of exclamation consists of a nominalized proposition followed by the locus particle -la, yieldingwhat appears to be an autonomous locus participant, indicating an extreme degree of some variable factor, which isexpressed by the nominalized verb, usually stativefor example, khyi tshe-bala \"That dog is really big!/How big thatdog is!\" gnam sdug-pa-la \"The sky is so beautiful!/What a beautiful sky!\" Sometimes the variable factor isexpressed by a noun, presumably with an equative YIN omitted; for example, when some young girls see theemaciated and ragged body of Mi-la ras-pa, one exclaims sdug-sdug-gi Ndra-ba-la \"How miserable he seems!\"while another cries out sñin-rdze-ba-la \"What a pity!\"Such exclamations may also be made from hypotheticals: for example, when rebuked by his master, Mi-la cries outsi-na dga-ba-la \"How happy I would be if I died!\" and sa-la thim-na dga-ba-la \"What happiness to sink into theearth!\" Similarly, in one of his songs Mi-la exclaims sgom-na tshog-pa-la \"If I meditate that's surely enough forme!\" < previous pagepage_384next page >"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"page_385file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_385.html[8/7/2010 9:55:48 PM]< previous pagepage_385next page >Page 3851.4.

Connectives2.1. The Connective YanThe connective Yan \"EVEN, ALSO\" is clearly related tobut is not the same asthe bound adversative conjunction -Yan \"BUT.\" Like the conjunction particle, the connective Yan becomes kyan after preceding final -g, -d, -b, and -s; becomes yan after preceding final -, -n, -m, -r, -l, and open stressed syllables; and becomes an or yan afterpreceding open unstressed syllables. The connective Yan occurs within propositions but outside participants; sincethe connective thus occurs frequently after unstressed particles at the end of participants, we not infrequently findsuch resulting diphthongs as -paan and -duan.One function of the connective Yan is ADDITIVE: it serves to add the content of one sentence or proposition tothe content of a preceding one. The connective generally follows the participant which particularly supplies theadditional information: compare rgyal-po bsod-nams-dan yan ldan \"The king has MERIT as well\" with rgyal-poyan bsod-nams-dan ldan \"The KING too has merit.\"2 A connective following the first participant in theproposition can2 Note further examples from the biography of Mi-la ras-pana-ran-gi yid-laan dban-skur(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_385next page >"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"page_386file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_386.html[8/7/2010 9:55:48 PM]< previous pagepage_386next page >Page 386also indicate that the information being added is more general, as in khyeu de yan tshe Ndas-so \"And then the boydied,\" bsad-pa yan grans med-do \"And those slain were numberless.\"3 Connectives in successive propositions canemphasize their parallelism: the young Mi-la tells his prospective master Marpa lus nag yid gsum yan Nbul, lto gostshos gsum yan bla-ma-la zu ''On the one hand, I offer you my body, speech, and mind; on the other, I ask thelama for food, clothing, and teaching.\"Sequential connectives within the same sentence or proposition are similarly additive-for example, dge-tshul yandge-slon yan Ndu \"Both novices and monks gather together,\" bu yan bu-mo yan rgyal-po nan-pas bsad \"Thevillainous king slew not only sons but daughters also,\" gser yan dnul yan mi-sbyin-no \"I will give neither gold norsilver.\"Another function of the connective Yan is to point out when the information supplied in a sentence or propositionappears improbable or unlikely in light of the preceding text or in light of general knowledge or expectation. Againthe connective generally follows the participant which particularly supplies the improbability: compare Ndre-busrgyal-poan skrag \"Even the king is scared of the little demon\" with Ndre-bus kyan rgyal-po skrag \"The king isscared even of a little demon.\" Other examples include kar-sa-pa ni Nbum yan sbyin \"I will give even 100,000cowries,\" snar-las kyan hag-pa yin \"This is even better than before,\" dge-slon gtsig kyan med ''There is not even asingle monk,\" na min gzan-tsig yin-na gsod-duan yon \"If it were one other than myself he would even kill you,\"rin-por ma-lon-par smra yan ses \"Before long he could even speak,\" ned-la sog kyan mi-zer \"They did not eveninvite us.\"4(footnote continued from previous page)gnan yon sñam-pa byun \"The thought occurred to my mind also that he would bestow the initiation,\" la-lasbla-ma mar-paan zer-zin Ndug \"There are some who call him Lama Mar-pa as well,\" zin des na bla-ma-dan mdzal-bai mthun-rkyen byas-pas, zin-gi min-laan mthun-rkyen-du tshags \"Since that field served asthe fortunate circumstance for meeting my lama, its name came to be Fortunate Circumstance as well,\"yum-gyi zal-nas da-lan khyod-ran yan dban-zig thob-pa byed gsun \"The Mother said, 'This time we shallhave you too get an initiation.'\"3 The choice of readings, of course, depends on whether the immediately preceding participant is processed asOLD INFORMATION (khyeu de yan tshe Ndas-so \"And then the boy we have been talking about died\") orNEW INFORMATION (khyeu de yan tshe Ndas-so \"The boy also died, in addition to the other persons wehave been talking about\").4 This use of Yan is often found after a nominalized proposition in the setting slot marked with the locusparticle -na \"In the case that . . .\" With Yan, this circumstance is(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_386next page >"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"page_387file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_387.html[8/7/2010 9:55:49 PM]< previous pagepage_387next page >Page 3872.2. Discourse ConnectivesOne way of achieving textual cohesion is through what we will call DISCOURSE CONNECTIVESconnectives inthe setting slot of the proposition which explicitly connect that proposition or sentence to the text that has precededit. Such discourse connectives may be phrases, such as de-nas \"thereupon\" or bye-brag-tu \"in particular\"; or theymay be propositions, such as Ndi lta-ste ''for instance\" or yin-kyan ''nevertheless.\"5 Like the English discoursecon-(footnote continued from previous page)pointed to as contrary to fact or expectation or desirethus \"Although/Even though/Even if . ..\" Note thefollowing examples from the Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter of Sa-skya panditablo-gros tshen-porgud-na yan, lhag-par blo-gros stobs-ldan Ngyur \"Although the wise grow frail, their understanding growsstronger,\" blo-nan ses-pa man-na yan, rgyu-skar bzin-du gsal mi-nus \"Even if foolish scholars are many,like the planets they cannot illuminate,\" Nbyor-ba thob-par gyur-na yan, bsod-nams med-na ga-la rtag\"Even though you manage to gather wealth, how can it last if you have no merit?\" dam-pa srog-la bab-nayan, ran-bzin bzan-po ga-la Ndor \"Though a holy man be in danger of his life, how can he cast aside hisinherent virtue?\" And note the following verses:gan-na bza-btun yod der rgyug dgos-pai bya-ba btsol-yan Nbros gtam-dan bzad-gad ses-na yan mdzug-ma med-pai khyi rgan yinHe runs to where there is food and drink; though charged with necessary work, he flees.

Discourseconnectives such as bye-brag-tu \"in particular\" or Ndi lta-ste \"for instance,\" which indicate that what follows islinked to the preceding text as an example or specification, can be called INSTANTIATING connectives. < previous pagepage_387next page >"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"page_388file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_388.html[8/7/2010 9:55:49 PM]< previous pagepage_388next page >Page 388nectivessuch as therefore or hence or moreoverTibetan discourse connectives tend to be stereotyped in form andoften archaic in flavor.

Phrasal ConnectivesMany discourse connectives are simply stereotyped nominal phrases, frequently with an explicitly back-referringdeterminer, used in the setting slot to link that proposition or sentence to the preceding textthus de-nas\"thereupon,\" de-la \"in that regard,\" des \"therefore,\" de yin-na \"in that case,'' o-na ''now, well, but,\" gan yin-na \"inany case.\" Such connectives are often adverbs: note such back-referring adverbs as de ltar \"thus,\" de bzin-du\"thus,\" dei phyir-du~de phyir \"for that reason, therefore,\" gan-gi phyir-du~gan phyir \"for which reason,wherefore,\" and such instantiating adverbs as spyir \"generally,\" phal-tsher \"for the most part,\" bye-brag-tu\"particularly,\" khyad-par-du \"especially.\"62.4. Yan in the Setting SlotWhen Yan occurs, stressed, in the setting slot of a proposition, it indicates that all of the information in thefollowing proposition or sentence is to be added to what has gone before; thus stressed initial yan may be glossedas \"moreover, further, in addition, also, again, once more\"for example, yan blon-pos zus-pa, gtsan-pa-la rnam-paman \"Moreover the minister said, 'Cleverness comes in many forms.\"' In an archaic administrative invoice found atan eighth-century Tibetan garrison in Central Asia, we read yan gro6 Some phrasal connectives with the locus particle -na appear to derive from nominalized propositions withomitted verbs, yielding what seem to be double role particlesfor example, dper-na \"for example,\"presumably a stereotyped contraction of a phrase such as dper brdzod-na \"If one would set it forth as anexample . . . ,\" or mdor-na \"in brief,\" presumably a stereotyped contraction of a phrase such as mdor bsdu-na \"If one would summarize it as an aphorism . . .\" Elsewhere the presumably omitted verb is less clear, butmay well be simply YINforexample, de ltar-na \"in that case,\" des-na \"therefore,\" de-bas-na \"therefore.\" < previous pagepage_388next page >"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"page_389file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_389.html[8/7/2010 9:55:50 PM]< previous pagepage_389next page >Page 389bre drug phul-te rgyas btab \"In addition, six bre of wheat were delivered and were sealed\"; in the biography ofMi-la ras-pa we find yan bla-mas byon-nas, mthu-tshen khyod rtsig-pai mkhar Ndi sui yin gsun \"Once again mylama arrived and said, 'Magician, whose is this tower you are building?'\"7The stereotyped expression Yan-na in the setting slot means, for reasons I do not know, \"or else, otherwise, on theother hand.\" For example, Sa-skya pandita writes yon-tan kun-rdzogs skye-bo sten, yan-na tha-mal Ngrogs-pa bde\"Adhere to people of perfect virtue; otherwise it is easy to be associated with the vulgar.\" The connective Yan-na isthus often found in the setting slot of a proposition which follows the alternative conjunction -Am \"OR\"forexample, again from Sa-skya pan dita, mda-yis pha-rol gsod-paam, yan-na ran-ñid Ntshag-par Ngyur \"An arroweither kills the other person or else is itself broken,'' mkhas-pa gzan-la bsad-paam, yan-na zi-bai nags-su sgrub ''Awise man is either a teacher to others, or else meditates in a peaceful forest.\" Sometimes the connective Yan-na isfound in sequential setting slots to offer a series of alternativesfor example, Mar-pa offers to Mi-la the choice yan-na lto-gos ster tshos gzan-nas tshol, yan-na tshos ster lto-gos gzan-nas tshol \"Either I give you food and clothingand you seek the dharma from elsewhere,' or I give you the dharma and you seek food and clothing fromelsewhere.\"The connective Yan is also part of several back-referring phrasal connectives de yan~dean \"in that regard,\" gzanyan \"furthermore,\" on kyan \"nevertheless,\" yin-naan \"anyway,\" de ltar-na yan \"in any case,\" gan ltar-na yan \"inany case.\" After Mi-la has told his prospective master Mar-pa his whole sad history, Mar-pa says, Ndug gan ltar-naan lus nag yid gsum Nbul zer de bzan7 The expression yan-yanor yan-du yan-du or yan-nas yan-dusimilarly means \"again and again\"forexample, in the following verse by Sa-skya pandita, who writes,blun-pos sog-pai sdug-bsnal-ñid myon-gi spyod-pai bde mi-myon yan-yan ul-zin lta-ba-yi Ndzuns-pai nor ni byi-ba NdraFools taste the pain of gathering but do not taste the pleasure of spending: the wealth of a miser who again and again sneaks in and looks at it is like that of a rat. < previous pagepage_389next page >"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"page_390file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_390.html[8/7/2010 9:55:50 PM]< previous pagepage_390next page >Page 390\"Okay.

Propositional ConnectivesSome discourse connectives are stereotyped propositions followed by conjunction particles, which connect thesecond member of the conjunction to the preceding text. The adversative conjunction -Yan \"BUT\" is found in suchstereotyped expressions as yin-kyan \"nevertheless\" and gan yin-kyan \"in any case\"; the coordinating conjunction -sTe \"AND\" is similarly found in Ndi lta-ste ''for instance,'' de bzin-te \"in that case,\" da-ste \"henceforth,\" and tsi-ste~de-ste~on-te~gal-te \"if.\" Note also the compound stereotyped expressions tsi-ste-na~on-te-na~gal-te-na \"butif, if however, even supposing that.\"3. Sentences as PatientsIt is possible for a SENTENCE to function as the patient of certain events, such as those expressed by such verbsas GSUN \"say,\" ZER \"say,\" SÑAM \"think,\" DRI \"ask,\" ZU \"request,\" SES \"know,\" LTA \"see,\" and RTOG\"examine.\" That such patients are sentences rather than propositions is shown by the presence of sentence-finalperformance particles before such verbsfor example, sar-phyogs-nas on-no ses \"They came from the east, I know,\"Itseb-bam ltseb-bam sñam \"I thought, 'Shall I kill myself? Shall I kill myself?'\" na-la tshan man-po khyer-ziggsuns \"'Bring me a lot of beer!' he said.\"The proposition containing a sentence as its patient participant can in turn be nominalized, a device of whichGtsan-smyon he-ru-ka, among others, was fond; for example, in his Mi-la ras-pa cycle, we find such anominalized proposition functioning as a nominal HEAD in khyod-la mthu tshen-po yod zer-ba de bden-par Ndug\"It is true what they say, that you have great magic power,\" and as a nominal MODIFIER in mi-la ras-pa-la gseryod zer-bai mi-rnams-kyi khar skyag gon-zig tshug-tsig \"Put a piece of shit in the mouths of those who say Mi-laras-pa has gold!\"Sometimes such sentential patients are quite brief, and the reader must be alert to recognize a sentence even in asingle wordfor example, run lags-sam zus run gsuns \"'Is it all right?'

Quote OpenersSeveral expressions are used in the setting slot of a proposition to indicate that an immediately following sentenceis the patient of a final verb of speaking: these expressions are conveniently called QUOTE OPENERS. One suchquote opener is the expression na-re, of uncertain origin, which immediately follows the identification of thespeaker; the speaker has no overt role particle, even with a transitive verb. For example, in the Tibetan translationof the Abhidharmakosabhasya by Vasubandhu, the various competing philosophical positions are set forth withsuch quote openers as kha-tsig na-re \"Some say . . .\" gzan-dag na-re \"Others say . . .\" snon-gyi slob-dpon na-re\"Masters of the past have said . . .\" mdo-sde-pa-rnams na-re \"The Sautran-tikas say . . .\" bye-brag-tu smra-ba-rnams na-re \"The Vaibhasikas say . . .\" kha-tshe-ba-rnams na-re \"The Kashmirians say . . .\" nub-phyogs-pa-dagna-re \"The Westerners say . . .\" Note the following examples from the biography of Mi-la ras-pa, where we findla-la na-re bden-pa bden-te da-lan ha-tsan drag zer \"Some said, 'Truth is truth, but this is too much,\"' or rgan-pa-rnams na-re mo bsad-pas tsi-la phan . . . zer \"The elders said, 'What benefit will it be to kill her?\"'Other quote openers are more clearly adverbs or locus participantsfor example, nai yid-la . . . sñam \"In my mind, Ithought . . .\" Ndi skad-du . . . zer \"This, in words, he said . . .\" Ndi sñam-du . . . bsams \"This, in his mind, hethought . . .\" Where the quote is from a text, the source is cited with the particle -las (and often with the final verbbyun \"occur, appear\")-thus mdo-las \"From the scripture . . .\" Ndul-ba-las \"From the ecclesiastical laws . . .\" dbu-ma-la Ndzug-pa-las \"From the Madhyamakavatara . . .\" or even such8 A sentential patient differs from a complement construction with the same verb.

The Quote Closer TSesHow does a reader know when a quote is finished? One way is by noting the verb of speaking immediatelyfollowing its sentential patientfor example, as when Mar-pa and Mi-la have the following interchange:mar-pa byon-nas kun-la gzigs-rtog zib-mo mdzad-nas, bu-tshen gsum-pos bsgril-bai rdo de-la phyag-mdzub btsugs-te, mthu-tshen rdo Ndi ga-nas byun GSUN, thugs-sras bu-tshen-rnams-kyis skurtsed-labsnams byun-ba lags zus-pas, o-na khon-tshoi rdos khyod-kyi mkhar-las-kyi go mi-tshod, rdo Ndi thon-ladan-poi sar9 When Mi-la sings to a superior, he says glu Ndi phul-lo \"I offered up this song.\" When a superior singsto Mi-la, Mi-la narrates the event honorifically as mgur Ndi gsuns-so. < previous pagepage_392next page >"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"page_393file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_393.html[8/7/2010 9:55:52 PM]< previous pagepage_393next page >Page 393skyol GSUN, mkhar Ndi mi-bsig-pai zal-bzes yod zus-pas, de yod-de. . . kun bsig-pa ni min rdo Ndi thon-la ran-gnas-su skyol GSUNMar-pa came and made a careful inspection of everything.

Pull out this stone and take it back to its original place.''\"You promised this tower would not be destroyed!\" \"So I did. But this is not to destroy the whole thing.Pull out this stone and take it back to its own place.\"I have capitalized the verbs of speaking in this passage for ease of reference. Notice how easy it is to keep track ofwho is speaking at any time in this exchange. The first speaker must be Mar-pa, because he addresses the other asmthu-tshen \"magician,\" the epithet by which Mi-la was then known; then a turn by Mar-pa is indicated by thehonorific verb of speaking GSUN \"speak,\" and a turn by Mi-la by the humble verb of speaking ZU \"request.\"10But, in addition, the particle TSes can be used to indicate that a previous quoted discourse has ended, and thus, too,to mark a preceding discourse as attributed to one other than the present speakerfor example, from the Tibetantranslation of the Madhyamakavatara by Candrakirti, Ndi gñis-ga rgyu med-par Ngyur-ro, zes Ntshad-pa ni,Ngags-na rkyen yan gan-zig yin \"And what are the grounds for refuting those who contend, 'These both arewithout cause?'\" or, from the Legs-par bsad-pa rin-po-tshei gter by Sa-skya pandita, sgom-na thos-pa mi-dgoszes, blun-po blo-rgya tShun-nu smra \"If you meditate you need not have learning, say fools of littleintelligence.\"1110 This passage, by the way, contains an interesting little textual puzzle. The blockprint from Spo in Khamshas the reading gzigs-tog zib-mo, while those from Bstan-rgyas-glin in Lhasa City and from Bkra-sis lhun-po have the reading gzigs-tog dga-mo, and that from Spuns-than in Bhutan has the reading gzigs-rtog dga-mo. There can be little doubt that the correct reading of the first word is gzigs-rtog \"inspection,examination,\" presumably a secondary honorific of rtog-pa < RTAG \"examine, consider, search into.\" Butwas this inspection originally zib-mo \"exact, precise, thorough\" or dga-mo \"happy, cheerful\"? I certainlythink zib-mo makes more sense in this context; but I must confess that assuming that reading to be originalmakes a hash out of any reasonable filiation of the texts.11 The particle TSes \"THUS\" shouldin parallel with the particles -TSig and -TSin, which begin with the samemorphophoneme TSbecome tses after preceding final -g, -d, and -b;(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_393next page >"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"page_394file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_394.html[8/7/2010 9:55:52 PM]< previous pagepage_394next page >Page 394When the particle TSes is present, also, the verb of speaking may be less explicit than, say, the verbs TSAD\"contend\" and SMRA \"say\" in the preceding two examplesthus, again from Sa-skya pandita, nan-pa gzan-donsgrub-bo zes, sñad btags-nas ni sdig-la sbyor \"'We act for the sake of others,' falsely say the wicked, and stick tosin,\" or Ndi bses Ndi ni dgra-bo zes, blo-gros tshun-rnams so-sor Nbyed ''Fools make distinctionsthis is a friend,this an enemy,\" orbdag-gis bya-ba ma-zin-pas re-zig de-rin khyod bzugs zes mtshi-mas bmans-te gsol btab-kyan Ntshi-bdag btsos-su ga-la run\"I have not finished my work, so wait, today, just a little while.\" Though one thus pray, choked with tears, how can the Lord of Death change his mind?Indeed, when the particle TSes is present, there need be no explicit verb of speaking at all, the particle alonesufficiently indicating that the preceding discourse is a quotation.

Questions as PatientsAs we have seen, question sentences can be patients of verbs of speaking for example, na gan za zer nu-zin Ndug\"'What will I eat?' she said, weeping,\" mthu-tshen las tsi byed-tsin Ndug gsun \"He said, 'Magician, what work areyou doing?\"' su yin dris sog \"Come ask, 'Who is it?'\" gar son gsun '''Where did he go?' he said.\" But, in addition,question sentences can occur as the patient of certain verbs which are not verbs of speaking-for example, LTA\"see,'' STON \"show,\" SES \"know,\" RTAG \"examine,\" DRAN \"remember.\" With information questions theinterpretation of such constructions is fairly straightforwardfor example, Ndi GANyin nas brtag \"I will find outWHAT this is,\" na-bun NAM yal mi-ses \"We do not know WHEN the fog will lift,\" SU yin blta \"We will seeWHO it is,\" rmi-lam-la byun-sa med-pas TSIyin mi-ses \"Since dreams have no meaning, I don't know WHAT thisone is.\" With yes-no questions the analysis is slightly more complex.1313 Two different analyses are possible here. Look at three propositions from a poem by Lo-ras-pana-bunNAM yal mi-ses \"We do not know WHEN the fog will lift,\" sbran-rtsi sus spyod mi-ses \"We do not knowWHO will use the honey,\" Ndis phan E-thogs mi-ses \"We do not know WHETHER this will bring profit.\"There is every reason to believe that the author felt these constructions to be parallel. Now one analysistheone proposed here-takes, say, na-bun nam yal as a question sentence \"When will the fog lift?\" functioningas the patient of the verb SES \"know\"; this analysis derives the reading \"We do not know when the fog willlift\" from the reading \"When will the fog lift? We do not know.\" The other analysis initially attractivewouldtake na-bun nam yal as a shortened form, without the -Pa, of a relativized proposition modifying anomitted head understood to be something like dus \"time\"; this analysis derives the meaning \"We do notknow when the fog will lift\" from an underlying [(na-bun nam yal)-pa]- mi-ses \"We do not know (thetime) when the fog will lift.\"The second analysis, I think, cannot deal with a proposition such as Ndis phan e-thogs mises \"We do notknow whether this will bring profit.\" The analysis proposed here takes Ndis(footnote continued on next page) < previous pagepage_397next page >"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"page_398file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_398.html[8/7/2010 9:55:55 PM]< previous pagepage_398next page >Page 398When a yes-no question is the patient of such a verband not when it is the patient of a verb of speakingthequestion particle -Am after the verb can optionally be replaced by the particle e- BEFORE the verb: thus, forexample, we find both bden-par Ndug-gam brtag and bden-par e-Ndug brtag \"We will find out whether it istrue.\" Frequently the alternative nature of the question sentence is made explicit in such a constructionthus, forexample, a-khu siam ma-si blta \"I will see whether or not my uncle has died,\" a-ne skyiddam mi-skyid blta \"Iwill see whether my aunt is happy or not''; or, with ?ereplacing -Am in the first of the two alternatives, e-nus mi-nus mi-ses \"I do not know whether or not we can.\" Note the following examples of embedded yes-no questionswith the prefix e- from the biography of Mi-la ras-patshan-zig e-gnan ltos \"See if they will give us some beer,''res yar byon-nas bla-ma-la zu-skabs e-Ndug bltas \"Some of them went up and saw whether the lama was in amood to listen,\" khyed-dan e-phrad mi-ses \"I don't know if I will meet with you again,\" khan-pa e-Nphrod tse-na . . . \"If you ask whether this house will prosper . . .\"; and, with e- replacing -Am in the first of two alternatives,nai gdams-nag sgom nus-na tshe Ndir sas e-rgya mi-rgya yan ston-pa yin \"This doctrine of mine is one that willshow, if you can meditate on it, whether or not you will become a Buddha in this lifetime.\"(footnote continued from previous page)phan e-thogs as regularly derived from a question sentence Ndis phan thogs-sam or even Ndis phan thogs-sam mi-thogs \"Will this bring profit?\" when it functions as the patient of a verb such as SES \"know.\" I amnot at all sure how the second analysis would even begin to handle a proposition such as this. In fact, Ithink the second analysis has other problems as well.In the biography of Mi-la ras-pa we find nus-pa su tshe-ba blta \"We will see who is more able.\" The nominalnus-pa must here be interpreted as having a human referent, because it is related syntactically to suthus, in thisproposition, nus-pa \"person having ability\" < NUS \"be able.\" Under the second analysis, the proposition wouldbe read as nus-pa [(su tshe)-pa]- blta. In other words, it would be read as having, explicitly, both the -Pa andthe head of the relative construction which were omitted in, say, na-bun nam yal. Under this reading, thenominal head nus-pa \"person having ability,\" however modified, would be the patient of the verb LTA \"see.\"But this is, I believe, an incorrect reading of the proposition: the speaker is not predicting that we will see anable person, even a great one, but rather that we will see the outcome of a decision as to which person is moreable than the other. Under the first analysis, on the other hand, nus-pa su tshe-ba would be read as the questionsentence \"Which person-having-ability (is) the greater one?\" functioning as the patient of the verb LTA \"see,\"with the patient sentence having the equative verb unsurprisingly omitted; this analysis derives the reading\"We will see who is the more able\" from the reading \"Which person-having-ability is the greater one? We willsee,\" which effectively embodies the underlying sense of choice without invoking any special rules. < previous pagepage_398next page >"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"page_399file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_399.html[8/7/2010 9:55:55 PM]< previous pagepage_399next page >Page 399To show that alternative questions and constructions with e- are virtually interchangeable as patients of theseverbs, we can compare two different versions of one song, traditionally attributed to Mi-la ras-pa.

Figures of Speech4.1. MetaphorMetaphor is one way of manipulating the semantic content of participants; metaphor can thus have syntacticconsequences, even though it is not itself created syntactically. Moreover, metaphor can function across sentences:an extended metaphor is a device of textual cohesion, as much as any connective.Some metaphors are lexical. Note the expression thag TSHAD \"cut the rope,\" for example. Mi-la ras-pa says bdagñe-du-dan Nbrel-thag btsad \"I have cut the rope that binds me to my family.\" One can re-thag TSHAD \"cut therope of hope\" and thus give up one's plans; one can o-thag TSHAD ''cut the rope of milk\" and thus wean a baby.Most important, one can blo-thag TSHAD ''cut the rope of mind\" and thus end deliberation, make a decision, besure about something.

Aperiodical MetersAPERIODICAL METERS can often be of great poetic interest. The simplest type consists in simple metricalalternation, as in the following folksong stanzas:1010100da ni dog-moi bro-brdun us1-1010100sten lha-yi yul-du bro-tsig brdun1010100dog-moi sa-la rnam-pa-tsam1-1010100bar bstan-gyi yul-du bro-tsig brdun1010100dog-moi sa-la rnam-pa-tsam1-1010100og klu-yi yul-du bro-tsig brdunThe poet Mi-la ras-pa is fond of such devices, and we find such stanzas as the following, given in the Bka-brgyudmgur-mtsho:1010100a-ne khyun-bzai dpal-Ndren de1-1010100dus da-lta skyid-dam mi-skyid blta1010100khan-pa ka-bzi gdun-brgyad de1-1010100dus da-lta Ngyel-lam ma-Ngyel blta < previous pagepage_415next page >"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"page_416file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_416.html[8/7/2010 9:56:05 PM]< previous pagepage_416next page >Page 4161010100gtsan-khan zur-bzi logs-brgyad de1-1010100dus da-lta zig-gam ma-zig bltaThe crazy yogin Nbrug-pa kun-legs uses a similar alternation in the following stanza, included in hisautobiography Rnal-Nbyor-pai min-tsan kun-dga legs-pai rnam-thar byun-tshul lhug-par smras-pa zib-moi rtsid-mo ha-le ho-le sna-zin spu-zin-nas bkod-pa:1-1010100na skye-ba man-poi phren-ba-la1-1010100lus ma-blans bya-bai dgu-tsig blans1010100gsal-gsal ran-tsig mi-Ndug-ste1-1010100tshod byas-na Ndi-ltar skyes-sam sñamand the yogin Lo-ras-pa uses an even more irregular pattern in such stanzas as the following, again given in theBka-brgyud mgur-mtsho:1-1010100blo las-su run-bai sems-rgyud Ndi1-1010100gans dkar-po stons-kyi na-bun Ndra101010100na-bun nam-yal mi-ses sgom-la gsegs1-101010100Ndi yal-bar nes-so dam-pai tshos-la gsegsWe can note here that such catalectic first feet can be used as a device of topicalization. In a poem by Mi-la ras-pagiven in the Bka-brgyud mgur-mtsho, the poet begins an admonitory address to his own wandering mind with asingle aperiodical verse before continuing with periodical lines of the form 1010100:1-1010100sems ma-spro ma-spro ran-sar zog1010100spros-na don-med sna-tshogs dran1010100ma-yens ma-yens dran-pa brten1010100yens-na dge-sbyor rlun-la Ntshor......The topical syllable sems ''mind'' is here set off by its position in an initial catalectic foot. Similarly, in anotherpoem, found in the Rag-mai skor sna-ma of the Rdze-btsun mi-la ras-pai rnam-thar rgyas-par phye-ba mgur-Nbum, Mi-la ras-pa begins with the line 1-1010100 na rigs-drug Nkhrul-pai gron-khyer-du, establishing thesyllable na \"I\" as topic before continuing with several stanzas of periodical 1010100 verses; he then gives a seriesof metaphors about himself, again topicalizing na in a catalectic foot at the beginning of each stanza: < previous pagepage_416next page >"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"page_417file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Hedy/My%20Documents/Downloads/0791410994/files/page_417.html[8/7/2010 9:56:06 PM]< previous pagepage_417next page >Page 4171-1010100na mal-Nbyor mi-yi sen-ge yin1010100lta-ba bzan-poi g.yu-ral rgyas1010100bsgom-pa bzan-poi mtshe-sder-tsan1010100ñams-len gans-kyi ltons-su byas1010100yon-tan Nbras-bu thob-tu re1-1010100na mal-Nbyor mi-yi rgya-stag yin1010100byan-tshub sems-kyi rtsal-gsum rdzogs1010100thabs-ses dbyer-med gra-Ndzum-tsan1010100Ndogs-la sman-ldzons nags-la bsdad1010100gzan-don Nbras-bu Nbyin-du re1-1010100na mal-Nbyor mi-yi rgod-po yin......Similar to such patterns of aperiodical catalexis are patterns of aperiodical synalepha. We find folksongs withloosely organized systems of aperiodical synalepha in the final foot:101010ka-bzi gdun-brgyad nan-du1010100rigs-bzan mkha-Ngro gzas-la byon1010100de-rin skyid-poi ñin-mo-la1010100dpa-bo mkha-Ngro gzas-la byon1010100phyag-gi dan-po yul-lha-la1010100gzi-bdag ya-la phyag-vtshal-lo101010snam-bu dkar-po tshags-la101010mi-Ngro zer-rgyu yin-na101010an-la bu-mo na ni10101010dam-pai tshos-la Ngro-rgyu yin-noMore regular patterns of alternation may be associated-as was the case with alternating catalexis-with systematicvariation of the number of feet in each line.
