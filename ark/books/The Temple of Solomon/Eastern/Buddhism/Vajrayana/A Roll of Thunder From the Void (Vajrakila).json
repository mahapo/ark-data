The Buddha is the great physician, the Dharma is his medicine, and the Sangha actively supports and assists the patient in every way that it can. The reader should be aware that the teachings con­tained in this book consist of very potent medicine indeed, com­pounded of various poisons. And, as with all pernicious poisons, the novice should keep away and avoid making contact, while those who have some knowledge should uproot those poisons and apply the antidote, for only the skilled master physician can be trusted to take the essence of those poisons and utilise them in the preparation of medicine. Intended for lions (i.e. bodhisattva sons and daughters of the Buddha), this medicine is available only on prescription. It to be utilised by Vajrayana initiates only and is not available over the counter, on demand. Should this book reach the hands of one who lacks the proper authorising empowerment, bestowed by a competent master of the lineage, please put it to one side. Long ago, in ancient times, the demon Rudra (epitome of ego­grasping ignorance) attained his condition of dreadful power through misuse of the sacred teachings. The enlightened Buddhas consequently took on the demonic appearance of Rudra as a sub­terfuge and, following the demon's inevitable overthrow, his bod­ily form, accoutrements and palatial home were all adopted by the victorious Buddhas as their playground, the joyful abode of natu­rally blissful wisdom. The story of the subjugation of Rudra indicates that all beings, no matter how morally reprehensible they may be, do not lack the potential for salvation, and, furthermore, the appearance of the demon to be subdued actually provided an historical occasion for"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the manifestation in this world of the wrathful Mahayoga tantras. His subjugation is thus to be celebrated both inwardly, as the enlightenment of our own defiled consciousness, and outwardly, as the occasion for the revelation of the teachings. The yogic process of utpattikrama, as taught in this book, involves recreating the world from the seed of compassion within the essential sphere of voidness. The vajra world, thus produced, is the actual mandala of Rudra as seen through the enlightened eyes of the fully awakened Buddhas. Anyone who lacks this pure vision, however, entering the mandala without the pure intention of the Buddhas, sets himself firmly upon the downward path of returning to Rudra. Meditating upon the lustful and angry nature of the demon is very dangerous for those whose wisdom minds were not made clearly manifest at the time of empowerment. As it is said: \"Meditating upon the perverse form of Rudra, one becomes Rudra in all his depravity.\" Such a calamity is to be avoided at all costs.

Our opening chapter, the sadhana or means of accomplishment of the deity, entitled A Sharp Weapon which Conquers Mara's Unruly Armies, follows his personal arrangement, and many of the verses contained within it are his own composition. But it is not his own invention. As Padma 'phrin-Ias himself writes, \"This is the liturgy for the ritual activities taken from the original old texts and arranged in clear reading order in accordance with received tradition./I In his commentary, Clear Elucida­tion of the Essence, he explains, \"With regard to this ritual, it never actu­ally existed in the form of a written book. The so-called rDo rje phur pa dril sgrub kyi phrin las is really made up of the medium Klla Razor med­itation in combination with an extensive portion of ritual activity.\" The basic treasure texts of this system, then, are the Black Razor Ta ntra, in which the divine ma1J�ala unfolds, and the ritual rDo rje phur pa thugs kyi 'phrin las. The former text was published earlier, together with the 'Bum nag, in A Bolt of Lightning from the Blue,! and the latter is included as our Chapter Two, below. It is intended that the present work be of practical value for medi­tators and, with that in mind, I have transcribed the original Tibetan text of much of the liturgy designed for formal recitation and juxta­posed it with its English translation, throughout. All the recensions of these texts to which I could gain access were brought in manuscript form by Tibetan refugees fleeing the Chinese A BoIt of Lightning from the Blue, Edition Khordong, Berlin 2002, in which the higher rites leading to enlightenment and the lower rites leading to the eradication of evil are extensively discussed. xi"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xii communist invasion of their country in the middle of the last century.2 From these same mss, useful clear copies were made of two of our texts, and these were published by sTag-lung-rtse-sprul Rinpoche from his exile home of rDo-rje-brag monastery in Simla, North India, in 1997, in a five-volume collection of the prayers and ritual practices of the North­ern Treasures Tradition (Byang gter chos spyod).3 Born in 1926, sTag­lung-rtse-sprul Rinpoche was recognised by the ninth Rig-' dzin chen-po of rDo-rje-brag, Chos-dbang mnyam-nyid rdo-rje, and enthroned as the sprul sku of sTag-lung-rtse Monastery at the age of five. When he was eight years old, he was invited to take his Dharma seat at the mother monastery of rDo-rje-brag, where he quickly gained proficiency in all the religious arts and rituals of that tradition. In 1941 he sat with the newly-enthroned tenth Rig-'dzin chen-po of rDo-rje­brag, Thub-bstan 'jig-med rnam-grol rgya-mtsho (born in Lhasa in 1936), and received with him the empowerments and transmissions of the Northern Treasures. Despite the overthrow of Tibet by the com­munist Chinese, rNam-grol rgya-mtsho has remained in Tibet where he has lately been active in the rebuilding of his monastery which was almost completely devastated during the 'cultural revolution.' Thus, even though the present holder of the throne of rDo-rje-brag is rNam­grol rgya-mtsho, the tenth Rig-' dzin chen-po, the lineage prayers in our texts generally do not go beyond Rig-' dzin chen-po IX, mNyam-nyid rdo-rje, who died in 1932. The single exception to this is to be found in the opening section of the first chapter where the name of my teacher, bla ma 'Chi-med rig-'dzin, the 'Khor gdong gter chen sprul sku, and ref­erence to his teacher, U-rgyan bstan-'dzin, the sprul sku of Ba-gnas­dgon, are included. Bowing my head, I humbly dedicate this work to them. My previous study of the 'Bum nag, Tibet's most authoritative liter­ary overview of the entire tradition of Vajrakila, revealed the history of the Vajrakila doctrines and analysed their twofold pupose. The pres­ent work goes directly to the essential core and offers the reader those very meditations by means of which such twofold purpose may be accomplished.

The rit­ual form of his practice is exactly the one given here.\" The amazing results of the great guru's meditation in gYa' -ri are well known. As it is written in the gSol 'debs bar chad lam sel:4 At the time when you introduced the jina's doctrines [to Tibet] Yo u accomplished your practice in the fo rest around gYa'-ri. The klla of your ritual service rose up to the vault of the sky And you caught it with a vajra gesture. Rolling it between the palms of your hands, You threw it into the sandalwood fo rest And the resulting blaze even dried up the lake. Thus the abode of wicked heretics was completely destroyed And the evil spirits [that they served] were annihilated. As the destroyer of Mara, you have no equal! Thus, for those who have studied the 'Bum nag and wish now to absorb themselves in such powerful meditation for the destruction of Mara, this book is offered. For his generous help in providing the opportunity to write it, I give thanks to Reg Milne. When meditating upon this ritual text according to the instructions of Rig-' dzin Padma 'phrin-Ias, one should always begin with the Seven Line Prayer and general introductory verses, such as those to be found at the beginning of the Daily Practice (the final chapter of the present work). Presenting, as it does, a sequence of meditations not intended for beginners, the ritual sections of 'going for refuge' and 'developing bodhicitta' are taken for granted in the sadhana and referred to as 'the preliminary practices according to rule.' By this is meant that we are dealing here with a mahayana Buddhist practice. The mark of a Bud­dhist is one who has taken refuge in the three jewels and the charac­teristic of the mahayana is bodhicitta or great compassion. These texts are manuals for both personal and community use, through which indi­viduals may be ritually trained in skilful altruism. They are designed as methods for overcoming the instincts of egotistic self-interest, so that the mind may become focussed on the general welfare of the world, 4 A translation of which is to be found in Ngawang Zangpo, Guru Rinpoche: His Life and Times, Snow Lion Publications, NY, 2002, pp.260-267. Also, Padmasambhava, The Seven Chapters of Prayer, edition khordong, 2008, pp.240-271 xiii"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiv and beneficial changes of great social value will be brought about in both thought and behaviour. Having become empowered to do so within the mm:u;iaZa of Vajrakila by a master guru, trainees may use these skilful esoteric techniques to develop a profound experiential certainty of the true nature of reality, so that they may live fearlessly in the face of worldly vicissitudes with confidence in their own ability to bless those less fortunate than themselves, and ease their suffering. Indeed, the vows of the trainee, articulated on a daily basis, state, quite unam­biguously: \"I engage in the great deeds of guhyamantra in order to bring all living beings to maturity.\" The sadhana makes explicit that the ten krodha kings of the Vajrakila mm:u;iala annihilate the ten non-virtues and that the four goddesses who guard the palace gates embody 'the four immeasurables' (catur aprameya) -altruistic states of mind otherwise known as 'the stations of Brahma' (brahmavihara). Such equivalents are ubiquitous in vajrayana theory and practice, which recreates the world as a purified construct of Buddhist Dharma, traditionally codified in numerical lists. Thus, in the opening verse of his Clear Elucidation of the Essence, Padma 'phrin-Ias praises the ma1:z�ala of Vajrakila as the means to the accumu­lation of virtue and the eradication of vice. Such personal defects as the twenty upaklesa (secondary afflictions), viz: krodha (anger), upanaha (enmity), mrak§a (hypocrisy), pradasa (outrage), ir$ya Gealousy), matsarya (avarice), sathya (fraud), maya (deceit), mada (pride), vihirhsa (violence), ahriJ:r (lack of shame), anapatrapa (indecency), styana (inertia), auddhatya (agitation), asraddhya (lack of faith), kauszdya (indolence), pramada (neg­ligence), mU$itasmrtita (forgetfulness), vik$epa (distraction), and asarhpra­janya (lack of proper introspection), he says, are brought under control by the devourers and killers who patrol the ten directions in search of trouble. These wild anthropomorphic creatures with the heads of ani­mals and birds are the active messengers of the ten wrathful kings and it is due to their ceaseless vigilance that the awakened mind of bud­dhahood remains undisturbed by the demonic influences of Mara. Similar in many ways to the animal-headed Sri demons which cause much grief to religious and lay folk alike, these restless retainers were converted to a higher purpose and incorporated into the ma1:z�ala of divinities when their masters, the old gods of ignorance who formerly held sway over the ten directions, were overthrown. Liturgy for the worship of the protectors, also, is not seen in the sadhana text because there are so many variations from which to choose and, to a large extent, the choice is based on location. The pre-Bud-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"dhist sacred topography of Tibet, whose local spirits successively became tamed and elevated to the status of 'protectors of the Buddhist teachings and those who uphold them,' is quite different for example in Ladakh and Sikkim, each location being unique and local spirits tending to become the guardians of sites and traditions in their own neighbourhood. Among the particular protectors of the Vajrakila doctrines, we encounter bands of male and female demons whose designated task became, upon their subjugation and conversion, the assistance of all those engaged in the difficult rites of the Kila. Chief among these are the 12 Mother Goddesses who appeared to Padmasambhava when he himself had accomplished mastery of this rite in Nepal. Appearing in groups of four, in the evening, at midnight, and at dawn, the last group to arrive were the four sisters who control the earth (bhumipati) and who gave their secret names (those by which they are addressed in their mantra) as Jaya, Vijaya, Ajita and Aparajita. Known to outsiders as the sisters (consorts) of Tumburu, these goddesses are spoken of in the earliest tantric texts of the viimasrota (left-hand stream) followed by the heterodox worshippers of Rudra. Since the eighth century, these goddesses have become part of the Buddhist world and their wrathful forms are described in meditation texts, such as those included in the Siidhanamiilii. Following a recently published study by Miranda Shaw (Buddhist Goddesses of India), it is interesting to note that the earth sister Aparajita can be identified as the wrathful aspect of the Mara-defeat­ing Earth Goddess Prthivi. All of these protectors are described in detail, for the purpose of their invocation and worship, in the commentary by Padma 'phrin-Ias, in a manner which is typical of his erudite scholarship. Typical in this regard, too, are his illuminating essays on the subjugation of Sri demons, which are included in the present volume (Chapters Six & Seven) and discussed below. Although the Sharp Weapon (Chapter One) is derived, to a certain extent, from the Heart Activity (Chapter Two), there are some signifi­cant differences in approach. Generally speaking, the Sharp Weapon expands upon the contents of the Heart Activity, adding extra sections and embellishing those features already present. Thus, for example, the meditation in which one generates oneself as the deity is very brief in the Heart Activity compared with the same section in the Sharp Weapon and, while the Sharp Weapon establishes an outer boundary, an inner boundary and a secret boundary around the sacred ma1J�ala, the xv"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xvi establishment of an inner boundary alone serves for all boundaries in the Heart Activity. Such minor differences between the two texts are legion. It is in the section dealing with meditation on the three samadhi, however, that we encounter a truly significant difference of approach. These three samadhi arrange the conditions for the arising of the mani­fest vaira world. The text of the Black Razor Ta ntra, which is utilised in the Sharp Weapon sadhana, propounds the big bang theory of mahayoga­tantra origination, in which a condensed drop (thig le chen po, mahabindu), within which all possibilities are latent, is all that is seen to exist within primordial empty space. This condensed drop then explodes to permeate all-encompassing universal emptiness with the fundamental elements of existence: earth, water, fire and air, out of which living beings arise by an evolutionary series of transformations. The Heart Activity, on the other hand, describes this creation according to the steady-state theory of the atiyoga texts in which essence (ngo bo), nature (rang bzhin) and compassion (thugs rie) are always and every­where present. The structural outline of the sadhana can be seen in the table of con­tents, above, and for a detailed study of the esoteric theory underlying its sequential meditations, I refer the reader to the 'Bum nag. Chapter Three of the present volume is the Clear Elucidation of the Essential Branches of Ritual Practice in which are analysed the full series of activities fo r the great attainment of the blessed Vajrakumara Medium Razor (bCom ldan 'das rdo rie gzhon nu 'bring po spu gri'i sgrub chen gyi chog khrigs lag len snying po rab gsal), by Rig-'dzin Padma 'phrin-Ias. This most valuable commentary discusses, in Part One, how to take the sadhana meditation practice out into the wilderness for a period of intense isolation. First of all, one should carefully select a suitable site for retreat, where one makes offerings to the Earth Goddess and to the local gods and spirits, and then one contemplates the establishment of the mm:lIjala upon that site through dance gestures and mantra, so that all evil is ritually banished from the land. In Part Two, the maIJif.ala rites are applied to the retreat hut and an extended series of boundaries is established. These include a ring of stone cairns for the four Great Kings, to be erected around the outside of the meditation hut, and a pit of suppression in front of the doorway, within which the dam sri demons are buried in order that they be trodden down every time the yogin goes outside to answer the call of nature. This fascinating topic is discussed in detail in Chapters Four, Five, Six & Seven of the present volume. Within the meditation hut, practical instructions are given for"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the construction of a material ma1!�ala, and these complement the instructions for visualisation given in the liturgy of invocation. Thus, lines are drawn, colours are applied, and the offerings and ritual items are set down in their proper places. Through the proper performance of the subsequent rituals, then, it is said that the yogin gains the power to destroy the triple world of sarhsara with his body, speech and mind in a single instant and the meditation on the dissolution of the ma1!�ala at the end of the rite, followed by its sudden reemergence from the void like a fish leaping out of water, is intended to protect the mind of the meditator from the extreme views of eternalism and nihilism. Thus the liberated yogin, with all false notions of sarhsara destroyed, is free to assume forms in the world suitable for the benefit and guidance of oth­ers. This final verse, together with those forming the concluding prayers of aspiration (prat;zidhana) and auspiciousness (mangalam), were com­posed by the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, whose family lineage had been traced back to the bygone rulers of Tibet. A significant feature of the Northern Treasures tradition is its his­toricallink with the ancient lineage of Tibetan kings, and many of its secret rites are known to have been taught at the end of the eighth cen­tury to the warrior emperor Khri Srong-Ide'u-btsan by Guru Padma himself. Later revealed as a treasure by Rig-' dzin rgod-Idem in 1366, this cache of mystic doctrines is considered crucial to to the preserva­tion of the royal line and to the welfare of the Tibetan subjects. The rule of the kings, however, had long since been overthrown by a pop­ular uprising, which brought an end to the feuds for succession to the throne following the assassination of gLang-dar-ma in 842, and the empire had fragmented and collapsed. Nevertheless, among the writ­ings of the great master of the Northern Treasures, bKra-shis stobs­rgyal dbang-po'i-sde (1550-1607), is to be found a prophesy concerning a future treasure-revealer whose destiny it would be to become king of all Tibet in his fifth incarnation: 5 Tw enty-five [treasures] and five special treasures of mind Will be revealed, through pure aspirations, By your fifth incarnation, Oh present king of the black-headed race.5 Dudjom Rinpoche, The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism, pp.822-823. xvii"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xviii The one referred to in this verse is the fifth Dalai Lama, whose 25 treasures pertain, for the most part, to the corpus of the Byang-gter -a sacred system to which he was introduced at birth and within which he was encouraged by repeated visitations of lineage holders, includ­ing the deceased bKra-shis stobs-rgyal himself. Rig-'dzin padma 'phrin-Ias and the Great Fifth Dalai Lama Foretold in numerous Dharma treasures as the actual embodiment of the compassion of Av alokitesvara (bodhisattva protector of Tibet) and the enlightened activity of king Khri Srong-Ide'u-btsan,6 the fifth Dalai Lama was born in 1617 (fire female snake year) as a son of the rNying­ma-pa family of the dukes of 'Phyong-rgyas stag-rtse, home of the ancient Tibetan monarchy. His father was Mi-dbang bdud-'dul rab­brtan, a descendent of the royal line of Za-hor, and his mother Kun­dga' lha-mdzes was a daughter of the khri dpon of Yar-'brog. Born amidst many auspicious signs and omens, he was blessed in the year of his birth by the empowerment of long life according to the Northern Treasures system of Yamantaka, the Lord of Life, in tandem with Vajra­pailjara Mahakala, bestowed upon him by Rig-' dzin ngag-gi-dbang-po (1580-1639), the third incarnation of the Northern Treasures gter ston. Thus his life was filled with auspiciousness and joy from the outset. Recognised as the incarnation of Yon-tan rgya-mtsho (Dalai Lama IV) by the P<n:l-chen bla-ma, bLo-bzang chos-kyi rgyal-mtshan, the boy was brought to the monastery of 'Bras-spungs in 1622 where he took his first set of vows (upasaka) and installed upon the lion throne with the name bLo-bzang rgya-mtsho. At the age of eight he was ordained as a novice monk, and he became a fully ordained bhik$u for the first time in 1628, aged eleven. With dKon-mchog chos-'phel of gLing-mad, foretold by Padma­sambhava as the incarnation of rNgog lo-tsa-ba, the young Dalai Lama studied the great texts of Buddhist philosophy, mastering all of them with ease.

Receiving empowerments and instructions in all the major tantric cycles of the old schools and the new, he became a fully awakened Dharma master and a true manifestation of Buddhahood in this degenerate world. He upheld the purity of his vows of pratimokfa, bodhisattva and guhyamantra without the smallest blemish and the cat­alogue of his studies (gsan yig) fills four volumes. The times into which he was born were a troubled period in Tibetan history, during which the country was torn apart by religious and polit­ical rivalries. Certainly, at this time, a rebirth of the ancient line of kings would be a great blessing for the people. In particular, in the language of the Dalai Lama's biography, \"the lords of Chog-tu, Be-ri and gTsang became confused by demons who established wrong views in their minds and thus they became enemies of Dharma, suitable to be over­thrown by the wrathful rites.? It then happened that, in accordance with the prophesies and as a result of his past actions, the cakravartin king bsTan-' dzin chos-kyi rgyal-po (the Mongolian warlord Gushri Khan, leader of the Qoshot Mongols), came to the province of dBus in central Tibet where he developed profound faith in the Lord Lama as soon as he set eyes upon him, so that the hair of his body quivered and he took the feet of the Dalai Lama upon the crown of his head. He then gathered together his army and dispatched those enemies of Dharma to the realm of Samantabhadra.\"8 In 1641,9 when the Dalai Lama was just 24 years old, Gushri Khan, having overthrown those three rebellious provinces, offered all that he had conquered, both secular and religious, to the dominion of the Dalai Lama. Later, the Dalai Lama was invited to Peking by the emperor of China who proclaimed him Lord of the Doctrine and installed him as the imperial preceptor.

Restoring peace and prosperity to his people, he showed himself to be the least sectarian of religious leaders so that all factional fighting was brought to an end and his successive incarnations have upheld the happiness and welfare of a greater Tibet down to the present time. As recounted in his Secret Biography, the Dalai Lama experienced throughout his life a series of mystic visions (gzigs snang), in the course of which were revealed to him a number of Dharma treasures which became known as the 'Twenty-five Doctrines Sealed for Secrecy' (gsang ba rgya can du gsol ba'i chos sde nyi shu rtsa Inga). Many of these visions were connected with doctrines of the Northern Treasures tradition and involved masters of the lineage (both living and deceased), and two of the 'seals which keep them secret' relate directly to the deity Vajrakila, a deity that also looms large within the visions themselves. During one such ecstatic experience, the Dalai Lama was granted the empower­ment of Vajrakila by the mahasiddha Prabhahasti, by whom Guru Pad rna himself had been empowered in India almost nine centuries earlier. On that occasion, Prabhahasti displayed the mat:t4ala of deities within his heart and no sooner had the ritual klla been placed into his hands than the Dalai Lama began to dispatch messengers, with instruc­tions to drag forth the dam sri demons so that they may be destroyed. So important was the deity Vajrakila to the Dalai Lama that, much to the disapproval of his personal attendants, he adopted the habit of wearing a ritual klla stuck into the belt of his monastic robes, following a visionary empowerment bestowed upon him in 1642 by bKra-shis stobs-rgyal dbang-po'i-sde. Later, when he decided to move the seat of his new government from 'Bras-spungs to Lhasa, the Dalai Lama instructed the monks of rNam-rgyal monastery to enact sacred dances outlining the black deity mat:t4ala of Vajrakumara upon the site, and thus the ritual 'taming of the earth' was performed for his new Potala palace. In this way, the circle of 51 blood-drinkers brought all the local gods under control and the demons were destroyed. This took place in 1645, when the Dalai Lama was just 28 years old. As for his ongoing struggle against the dam sri demons, we will hear more of this in due course. In his youth, the Dalai Lama had been initiated into the rDzogs­chen (Great Perfection) meditations by dKon-mchog lhun-grub, as well as by his root teacher Chos-dbyings rang-grol of the great family of Zur. These teachings influenced him greatly, but the tradition in which he always had the greatest faith was that of the Northern Treasure reve-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"lations of Rig-'dzin rgod-ldem. These teachings he also learned from his root guru Chos-dbyings rang-grol, who himself had been nurtured as a sprul sku by Rig-' dzin Ngag-gi dbang-po since the age of nine years. In fact, the Dalai Lama's personal support of the rNying-ma schools in general is quite evident in many of the changes which he made to the structure of religious and political authority during the course of his lifetime. Several of the important ceremonies of state, newly instituted during his reign and subsequently performed annually in Lhasa for centuries, clearly reveal their Old School antecedents and he also spon­sored the carving of a large number of xylographic blocks for the preservation and dissemination of texts of the early translations. His own writings, also, (amounting to 235 titles in 24 volumes) include many prayers and meditations designed to be incorporated into the rit­uals of the Northern Treasures and other early cycles. In the reports of his visions recorded in his Secret Biography (which, uniquely among his works, was never carved onto wooden blocks and printed), the Dalai Lama states that Legs-Idan rdo-rje appeared to him several times and gave him specific instructions to propagate the teachings of the North­ern Treasures. After that, he received visionary empowerments and guidance in the Byang-gter tradition from both the recently deceased Ngag-gi dbang-po and his long dead father bKra-shis stobs-rgyal, and it is clear that he regularly performed the ritual practices of the North­ern Treasures throughout his lifetime.lO In his Secret Biography it is recorded that, at the age of 35 years, on the 23rd day of the eleventh month in the year of the iron rabbit (1651), a group of five dancing t;iiikini with t;iamaru drums and hand bells appeared in the sky before him leading a long white cloud, at the end of which was the master Padmasambhava. In order to instruct the Dalai Lama in the doctrines of the Northern Treasures, Padma­sambhava presented him with his heart practice (thugs sgrub) by appearing in the form of Guru drag-po-rtsal (one of the most important teachings of the Byang-gter). Upon the crown of his head stood an especially wrathful form with nine faces and eighteen arms, and he was surrounded by a retinue of deities and an outer circle of Dharma protectors. Furthermore, within an unprecedented divine palace situ­ated inside the 'vast knot' of his large ritual kila, the Dalai Lama could 10 Sections eight ('sealed by the kiss of sun and moon' - containing proph-esies) and nine ('sealed by the Kila' - containing rituals) of the secret teachings, were taught to the Dalai Lama by bKra-shis stobs-rgyal during a Byang-gter retreat on the teachings of Legs-ldan rdo-rje. xxi"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xxii clearly see all the deities in the maJ:t�ala of Vajrakila. Entering into that palace, he found a gathered assembly of tantric heroes and heroines, all dancing, and so he joined in the dance. Within the recesses of a chapel in that place, a throne had been set up, upon which was seated a maroon coloured rak('asa demon holding aloft a mirror in his hand. \"Look into this mirror!\" he commanded and, having done so, the Dalai Lama sawall the countries such as India, China, Nepal, O<;l<;liyana, Sambhala, and so on, most clearly and distinctly. He then understood with certainty that his vision had taken him to the pure land of the Cop­per Coloured Mountain (Zangs-mdog dpal-ri).11 There, on top of a mountain shaped 'like the handle of a kila of control' (i.e. like a tall, upturned bowl), stood a three-storeyed palace. The lower storey was occupied by the precious teacher of O<;l<;liyana in his activity manifes­tation as the Karma Guru, teaching the profound means of averting the hosts of Mara. In the middle and upper storeys of the palace, he appeared in various guises to be worshipped by sentient beings. Then the Dalai Lama was taken behind a bright veil of white light, like a curtain, where he encountered the woman Ye-shes mtsho-rgyal, white in colour and adorned with ornaments of bone, who acted as his support (consort) for the empowerment of wisdom-knowledge (prajiia­jiianabhi('eka). This empowerment brought his psychic chanels (na�i) and subtle drops (bindu) to the state of ultimate perfection, so that a very special experience of bliss and emptiness was generated within his mindstream. After that, he went immediately to a castle where he encountered a maroon coloured woman, blazing brightly and looking a little fierce. She took him into her mouth and swallowed him, and he was transformed into rDo-rje gro-Iod in her womb. Emerging from her birth canal, the Dalai Lama maintained the divine pride of himself as the deity rDo-rje gro-Iod and understood that, even though he himself rested in the state of clear light within which all illusory appearances had come to an end, the entire triple world of phenomenal appearances existed within his belly. This vision lasted for as long as it takes to drink a cup of tea. When it was all over, a disembodied voice gave ominous warning of trouble arising after three lifetimes,12 so the Dalai Lama then pre-II The Copper Coloured Mountain is situated on the island of Camaradvipa, to the southwest of our world.

Their leader, white in colour, gave some teachings on the different classes of mara and the means of averting difficult circumstances, at the end of which she carried the Dalai Lama in her womb until they reached a cave in a vajra-shaped rocky mountain that seemed to rise precipitously up into the sky. Within that cave they entered a palace of the gods where they found an ordinary-looking yogin that the Dalai Lama knew must really be Padmasambhava himself. That yogin placed several volumes of books upon the Dalai Lama's head, granting him mystic empowerments and blessings. And when this was over, that yogin dis­solved into light and became absorbed into the Dalai Lama's heart.14 A religious commentary on the significance of this single day's visions could fill a book, and it is recorded that all of his visions and their meanings were transmitted by the Dalai Lama to his favourite disciple, Rig-' dzin padma 'phrin-las. Throughout the course of his life, the Dalai Lama built a vast num­ber of shrines and temples, fully endowing each one with all the para­phernalia of worship in accordance with his visions. Following the Byang-gter predictions concerning the restoration of the ancient lineage of kings, he also sponsored Bon priests to perform regular rituals for the good of the countryside and his people, for the Bon continued to hon­our the old gods of the soil so that the countryside remained fertile and productive, just as they had been in the days of the kings. And he rebuilt the decayed temples of the early dynastic period, renewing received many prophetic warnings concerning future interferences to be caused to his work by troublesome dam sri demons. In particular, the wild spirit called Shugs-Idan arose at this time, following the murder of Grags­pa rgyal-mtshan, and remains a cause of trouble to the present day. 13 The Dalai Lama received visionary teachings on dPal-ldan Iha-mo from the Byang-gter master bKra-shis stobs-rgyal. Subsequently, this goddess became not only the chief personal protectress of the Dalai Lama himself but, in accordance with the prophesies concerning the importance of the Byang-gter tradition for the welfare of Tibet, has remained to this day the main protector of his dGa' -ldan pho-brang theocratic government. 14 rGya can gyi 'khrul snang rnams gsal bar bkod pa mthong ba don ldan (Visions and their Significance, being the elucidation of the visions recorded in the Sealed Vo lume).

He put a golden roof on the temple of Mount Chu-bo, and another on the Yum-bu bla-sgang, as well as a crown on the statue of Mahakarur:ta in the Jo-khang, and so on, and among the countless gifts of statues and other works of art offered as part of this restoration process, it is recorded that he bequeathed pennants of pearls and pre­cious stone and an iron lattice fence to an ancient rna/pJala of Vajrakila. As for our author, bLo-bzang padma 'phrin-Ias (1641-1718), uni­versally acknowledged as the greatest scholar in the lineage of the Northern Treasures, he is traditionally regarded as the immediate incar­nation of Ngag-gi dbang-po and thus the fourth incarnation of the Byang-gter's founder. Born at Mon-mkhar rnam-sras-gling, his birth was similarly marked by an unusually high number of auspicious por­tents. Following the ceremony of his re-enthronement as the rig ' dzin chen po of rDo-rje-brag by his former disciple bsTan-' dzin nor-bu of Yol­rna, Padma 'phrin-Ias became a disciple of Dalai Lama V, from whom he received both srarna/:zera and bhik$u vows. In his autobiography, Dalai Lama V repeatedly refers to Rig-'dzin padma 'phrin-las as \"the best of reincarnate ones\" and \"spiritual son of supreme virtue,\" and it is evident that Padma 'phrin-Ias was his favourite disciple. The Dharma treasures of the Dalai Lama, the 'Twenty-five Doctrines Sealed for Secrecy' spoken of above, were all transmitted to Padma 'phrin-Ias who incorporated much of their highly esoteric ritual lore into the Northern Treasure school of rDa-rje-brag. It could also be said that Rig­'dzin padma 'phrin-Ias himself was instrumental in bringing about some of these visions. Thus, for example, on the 20th day of the fourth month in the year of the water hare (1663), as a long-life rite was being performed by Padma 'phrin-Ias on behalf of his master, a vision of Amitayus and his consort arose which subsequently blessed the Dalai Lama by becoming absorbed into his body. Studying intensively under some of the greatest teachers of his day, including Zur-chen Chos-dbyings rang-grol, Padma 'phrin-las received the empowerments and commentaries of a large number of tantric doc­trines from both the old and new schools which enabled him to revise and greatly extend the teachings of his own tradition. Gathering together all of the instructions that had been handed down in the three streams of transmission from the original gter ston (the Mother, Son and Disciple lineages), he united them into a single line. He composed a number of new treatises and worked extensively to arrange the ritual texts of the Byang-gter in proper liturgical order, supplementing the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"original texts with extra parts wherever necessary. Correcting such errors as had arisen in the transmission, he reinstated earlier traditions of ritual activity which had become lost or confused, such as the proper systems of chanting, constructing the ma1J�ala, preparing the sacrificial bali cakes and so on, filling thirteen volumes with his work. Throughout this period, with the patronage and support of the Dalai Lama, huge new rNying-ma monasteries were founded through­out central and eastern Tibet, the two monasteries of rDo-rje-brag and sMin-grol-gling in central Tibet being of particular significance, so that the years of the Dalai Lama's reign saw an increase in the general for­tunes of the rNying-ma-pa with a clearly marked tendancy towards such larger monastic institutions. During this period, also, for primarily political reasons, Padma 'phrin-Ias produced extensive writings on the anuyoga system of 'Sutra Empowerment' (mdo dbang), based on the anuyoga tantra entitled dGongs pa 'dus pa'i mdo (SIUra of the Gathering of all Buddha's Intentions). Histori­cally, this Siitra which Gathers all Intentions provided much of the mytho­logical and doctrinal structure for the orally transmitted teachings (bka' ma) of the rNying-ma-pa and, as a result, by the seventeenth century the Sutra Empowerment had become a grand ceremony that was thought to embody the very heart of the bka' ma transmission. In his previous life as Legs-ldan rdo-rje, Padma 'phrin-Ias had received this important text at a young age and, having incorporated it into the curriculum of study at rDo-rje-brag, had become one of its chief proponents. In this life, having received the full empowerment of the sutra from Nyang-ston bLo-mchog rdo-rje, together with the esoteric instructions, practical tech­niques and authoritative seal of entrustment, at the request of the Dalai Lama, Padma 'phrin-Ias composed a massive new three volume ritual manual for the performance of this ceremony entitled Embarking on the Ocean of Ma1J�ala: Empowerment Ceremonies of the Sidra which Gathers all Intentions (,Ous pa mdo'i dbang chog dkyil 'khor rgya mtsho'i 'jug ngogs). He also compiled a new collection of the biographies of the masters of the Sti.tra Empowerment lineage. By these means, it was hoped that control of this key ritual system would be taken away from the Dalai Lama's enemies and tilt the balance of political authority in his favour. This proj­ect also represented a power shift within the rNying-ma school that par­alleled the wider change to the new Dalai Lama government. Previously, under the rule of the gTsang kings, the main central Tibetan rNying-ma lineage enjoying royal patronage was that stemming from the gter ston Zhig-po gling-pa, passing through Sog-bzlog-pa and Gong-ra lo-chen xxv"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"xxvi amongst others. After Dalai Lama V's takeover, this group fell out of favor while the new monasteries of rDo-rje-brag and sMin-grol-gling were established. Padma 'phrin-las' new ritual manual reflected this change in royal patronage.15 On the fourth day of the first month of the water dog year (1682), Padma 'phrin-las sent a message to the Regent Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho at the Potala, informing him of bad omens concerning his teacher, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama. He insisted that certain rites should be per­formed for the benefit of his health and recommended a retreat which the Dalai Lama followed eleven days later. During this retreat, the Dalai Lama died at the age of 65 on the 25th day of the third month 1682. The fact of the retreat, however, facilitated keeping the news of the Dalai Lama's death from all his rivals for a further fifteen years, and his fragile new government of the dGa' -ldan pho-brang continued to function unimpeded so that it was in a position of strength by the time that his successor, the sixth Dalai Lama, was announced and enthroned at the age of fourteen. Rig-'dzin padma 'phrin-las himself was killed in 1718 when the invading Dzungar Mongols razed his monastic seat of Thub-bstan rdo­rje-brag to the ground. 15 The Sutra Empowerment writings of gTer-bdag gling-pa, produced at sMin-grol-gling just a few decades later, approach the subject in an entirely different style -greatly simplifying the empowerment ceremony in an attempt to make it more suitable for the general public and render it more easily manageable for a festival format. Thus, the most secret tantric ele­ments were removed from the ceremony and the unwieldy manual was divided into smaller parts that could be distributed among separate groups of ritual specialists within the monastery. In this way, both the preparations and the actual performance became streamlined so that the entire cere­mony could be completed in just three days. This new system, backed by a rigorous historical study that provided unprecedented detail on fue rit­ual tradition, culminated in 1691 when hundreds of leading rNying-ma masters throughout Tibet were invited to a grand unveiling at sMin-grol­gling. The project was highly successful, and today sMin-grol-gling's rit­ual manuals are standard at all rNying-ma monasteries other than those affiliated with rDo-rje-brag.

Struggle and opposition were also to be witnessed as dramatic themes in a larger theatre. Thus, in this uncertain world, malevolent ki kang are thought to send down vio­lent hailstorms from above, destroying the harvest that benevolent gods have nurtured with gentle seasonal rains and sunshine. And the profound wisdom teachings of the buddha, guarded for millennia by wise and noble naga who honour them in their subterranean homeland for the benefit of all who live, are opposed by malignant sri who rise up seeking to destroy the holy Dharma by means of insidious heretical doctrines and broken vows. In an ideal world, men would live mutally supportive lives in peace and harmony with each other, in accordance with the Dharma, but in the world as we know it, however, backbiting mi kha people selfishly vie with each other out of spite, jealousy, pride and contempt, and the treacherous powers of chaos are forever lurking, ready to destroy all happiness at a stroke. Among these three categories of indigenous Tibetan demon referred to in our texts, only the Sri are treated in detail.16 Understood here as some sort of primordial ghosts, devilish spirits of original sin whose ancestral home is situated among the very roots of the tree of paradise, they are recognised by the wise as misdeeds of the past that remain to haunt us in the present. In his book Drung, Deu and Bon,17 Namkhai Norbu identifies Sri as \"maleficient spirits whose funda­mental characteristic is to cause the cyclical repetition of different types of misfortune on the basis of a calamity that once occurred.\" And, further, he says that \"the provocations they cause consist of dif­ferent kinds of sudden attacks (ye 'brog). They go around all the worlds of the universe unleashing wars between nations, spreading epidemics, provoking diabolical hindrances to men, harming animals and livestock and inflicting all sorts of calamities and disasters.\" From 16 Sri are unknown in Indian cosmology. The Tibetan word sri is used to translate parihi'l1;likii (loss-maker) in the Vinaya siUra, and the Mahavyutpatti lists Iq-cchra (wicked, causing pain). They are, however, said to be similar in many aspects to the Indian bhuta and preta (ghosts). 17 Drung, Deu and Bon: Narrations, symbolic languages and the Bon tradition in ancient Tibet, Chapter XII xxvii"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"xxviii the original pair, according to the Bon tradition, arose eight sons so that ten types of Sri are listed in these sources. Our Buddhist texts list Sri of thirteen varieties. Both Buddhist and Bon traditions attach much importance to the ritual exorcism of the Sri and, among the collected Vajrakila texts of the Northern Tr easures, I have found two originalgter rna texts: the 'Byung po sri non18 and the Sri chung bcu gsum mnan pa.19 Unfortunately, these early documents are not much read in the modern age, their impor­tance to the tradition having been overshadowed by the later ritual texts of Padma 'phrin-las. As a result, their textual transmission has become almost extinct and I have only a single witness for the first text, with each flaw in the transmission most difficult to rectify. It is of some help, however, that the two texts shed light on each other when read in parallel. For example, when speaking of the place deemed suitable for the supression of the Minister Sri, the' Byung po sri non states mdun La 'du bar, 'in a gathering in front,' while the Sri chung bcu gsurn mnan pa says bdun La gcig ru byed pa'i sar, 'in a place where seven are made into one.' Neither reading is readily intelligible. However, if we take them together and consider that mdun sa is the Tibetan word for sabha, the parliament chamber where ministers gather together to discuss poli­tics and strategy, we can confidently reject the word bdun (seven) as a misspelling and understand that Minister Sri (the ghosts of evil minis­ters, or malicious spirits that would seek the corruption of present min­isters and the perversion of their business) are to be subjugated within the ministerial assembly rooms, at the time of a gathering of ministers. Other misspellings may also be corrected with some confidence. It is a matter of regret that Padma 'phrin-Ias himself had access only to the second of these texts, the Sri chung bcu gsum mnan pa, a document which he cites regularly in his ritual writings, and in the reading of which we can therefore feel more secure. Padma 'phrin-Ias refers to this document as \"the root text\" but even he, however, was obliged to note serious flaws in the reading of the text and, at one point, he remarks, \"Even though Door Sri are described as Sri afflicting fathers and paternal uncles, the skulls and places of their suppression are not explained.\" The text, in fact, goes on to explain that 'The Sri of ill­omened conception for mothers and children should be pressed down within the skull of a dog, pig or camel, beneath the threshold.'

The race of Sri has a pedigree more ancient than that of human kind. Indeed, they are said to be as old as the world, their ancestors having come into existence at the beginning of creation, arising from beneath the roots of the tree of paradise which flowers in the gardens of the Tr ayastrirnsa heaven on the summit of Mount Meru. There, this tree called Parijataka is believed to fulfil all wishes and its vicinity is the favourite place for the gods to make love. It grows one hundred yojana tall, and its branches, leaves and petals spread out to a distance of fifty yojana, diffusing its divine fragrance for hundreds of miles in every direction. Its roots also dig down deep into the earth and it is there, at a depth of more than fifty yojana beneath the surface, that the ances­tors of the Sri came into existence. In our Buddhist texts, this ancient race of beings is said to comprise thirteen clans and their social structure is clearly well organised -with a royal family, ministers of state, and so on. They are, however, wicked by nature and ceaselessly evil in their effects. Bringers of madness and disease, they include among their number those who cause miscar­riage, stillbirth, and illness for mothers and children, those who lay waste to crops and livestock, those who bring disease and misfortune to the young and those who afflict the old, those who prowl the grave­yards and haunt the tombs as ghosts, and those who delight in causing religious practitioners to abandon their vows. As such, it is essential that they be kept far away from humans at all costs. They are by no means foolish creatures, however, and the wise among them have long recognised the tricks played on them by sorcerers attempting to exor­cise them from the human realm. Within the Secret Biography of the fifth Dalai Lama, in which he out­lines the circumstances of his mystic visionary experiences, we learn that the Northern Treasures adept Legs-ldan rdo-rje (1512-1625) appeared to the Dalai Lama whilst he was in retreat in the Potala palace in 1672 and empowered him in the wrathful practice of the kila-wield-xxix"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"xxx § . .0 u .g � ing Padmasambhava (rDo-rje gro-Iod) as the most effective means of dealing with dam sri spirits.

The skulls themselves were clattering together in a most threatening and alarming manner so that all the workers cowered down and hid themselves in fear. The lama, however, with the use of appropriate mudra, mantra and samadhi, was able to return those skulls to their pit and suppress them once more by trampling them beneath his feet. 23 dBu-ru zhva'i lha-khang, also known as Mal-gro gung-dkar-rdzong, in Central Tibet, is noted as the place from which lDang-ma lhun-rgyal recov­ered the rgyud bcu bdun and their commentaries. It was later held as a seat by the Jo-ldan-pa and the 'Bri-gung-pa. Dalai Lama XIII, while he was on a visit to India, assigned its restoration to the rDo-rje-brag chu-bzang sprul­sku. xxxi"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"xxxii Furthermore, another skull that had been used in such a ritual, dated circa 750-850 CE, was recently recovered during an archaeolog­ical dig excavating a Tibetan tomb sanctuary at Kexiaotu, Dulan County. Now housed in the Qinghai Archaeological Institute, a clear photograph of this artefact and its inscribed sri mnan charm is to be seen in Amy Heller's Tibetan Art p.35. And the skulls of horses, wild ass, yaks, goats, dogs, marmots, and humans, all inscribed with spells of supression against the Sri, have been unearthed in large numbers along the route of the recently-completed Qinghai-Tibet railway. With no master the calibre of kLong-chen pa currently available to take care of such archaeological finds, it is surely of no surprise to read the report in The Times newspaper, London, 15th August 2006, headlined: Beijing pledges 'a fight to the death' with Dalai Lama. These more elaborate rites of sri mnan are dealt with by our author in two interrelated texts: the Byang gter phur pa'i sri gnon gyi ngag 'don chog khrigs rdo rje'i lhun po zhes bya ba (Vajra Mountain), and the Phur pa'i sri chung bcu gsum gnon pa'i lhan thabs rab gsal me long (Utterly Clear Mir­ror). The first of these texts outlines the procedures for the ritual of sub­jugation, while the second (refered to by the author as 'the appendix') details the manufacture of the paper effigy (linga) for use in the rite. Both works are said to be based upon the Phur pa las kyi sri chung bcu gsum mnan pa'i sngags, discovered as a gter ma by Rig'dzin rgod-Idem, and referred to by Padma 'Phrin-las as \"the root text.\" All three of these texts are translated in the present work, below, together with a gter ma text transmitted within the Northern Treasures tradition but unnoticed by Padma 'Phrin-las, the Phur pa yang gsang spu gri'i las mtha' 'byung po sri non (a lost treasure).24 Our author's other sources include, as we have seen, the oral instructions of his teacher, Dalai Lama V, as well as a mys­terious text called The Gathering of all Precious Elements CByung ba rin chen kun 'dus). According to legend, the bodhisattva Mafijusri taught five primary tantras of divination: sDong po dgu 'dus shing gi rgyud (the tantra of wood), sNang gsal sgron me me'i rgyud (the tantra of fire), Rin chen kun 'dus sa'i rgyud (the tantra of earth), Ba la patra lcags gi rgyud (the tantra 24 The importance of Padma 'Phrin-Ias' work to the Tibetan tradition as a whole can be judged by the fact that it was extensively plagiarised and re­presented in a combined text entitled Byang phur sri mnan yi dam drag po gang la'ang sbyar du rung ba'i lag len 'don 'grigs dkyus gcig tu bsdeb pa 'bar ba'i brjid gnon thog brtsegs by Padma gar-dbang-rtsal ('Jam-mgon skong-sprul blo-gros mtha'-yas) and transmitted in the Rin chen gter mdzod."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"of metal), and bDud rtsi'i bum pa chu'i rgyud (the tantra of water) to four listeners: the god Brahma, the goddess Vijaya, the nagaraja Takf?aka vidyadhara, and Kapila the brahmin. Among these, the tantra of earth called The Gathering of All Precious Elements is renowned as the tradi­tion's most authoritative text on geomancy. Takf?aka the naga taught it to King Wan of Zhou, author of the Zhou-i (3rd & final redaction of the I-ching) and father of the founding king of the Zhou Dynasty of ancient China (Le. pre 1066 BCE). Eventually this text was translated from Chi­nese into Tibetan by Kun-'byung a-lo-che and Khams-pa lo-tsa-ba gtsug-ston, and the remarkable King Wan of Zhou came to be known in Tibet as Wang-the 'phrul gyi rgyal-po. It is said that this king died in a duel and never really reigned. Thus the Western Zhou dynasty is reckoned from the reign of his son, King Wu. The great abbot of Bya-khyung, the renowned dGe-Iugs-pa scholar Thu'u-bkvan III, bLo-bzang chos-kyi-nyi-ma (1737-1802), wrote in his Grub mtha' shel gyi me long in 1801: \"The earlier [systems] of the Le'an­shan (Lianshan) and the Kus-tsang (Guizang) together with this [Zhou­i system] are very well known [in China] under the name of \"The Three Treatises of sPor-thang\" (spar thang gi gzhung gsum, Ch. san yi, the three [systems of] mutations). It seems that the scholars of the later genera­tions in the country of China refered to the group of 'Phu-shi (Fuxi), Wen-wang (King Wen), Ci'u-kyung (Zhougong, the Duke of Zhou) and Khung-tsi (Confucious) as 'the four saints' (skyes mchog bzhi, Ch. si sheng, 'four sages'), but the Tibetans call them 'the four receivers' (len pa mi bzhi). Although these are the four persons referred to, because the Tibetan authors misspelt or mispronounced [their names], they wrote Kong-tse instead of Khung-tsi, Ji-gong instead of Ci'u-kyung, She-nang instead of Ji-nong (7) and Wang-the instead of Wen-wang. [Furthermore ... ] Tibetan elders maintained that Chinese astrology was first expounded by Manjughof?a in China on Mount Wutaishan (Ri-bo rtse-Inga), or that they emerged from the forehead of Goddess Vijaya (Lha-mo rnam-rgyal-ma), or that they were uttered by the master Padmasambhava, and so forth. [In short,] they spread all sorts of rosaries of lies. Not only that, the astrological texts diffused in Tibet, which are supposed to have come from China, do not exist, even by name, in China, and I wonder whether they were not fabricated by a Tibetan. \"25 25 Thu'u bkvan grub mtha', Lanzhou edition, pp.399-400. My thanks to Guilaine Mala for the reference and translation. xxxiii"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"xxxiv It appears that the full text of the 'Byung ba rin chen kun 'dus is no longer extant. It was evidently of great interest to Dalai Lama V, and relied upon heavily by his regent Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho as well as by Lo-chen Dhar­masri (1654-1718) in their astrological writings, and then, again, by our author Padma 'phrin-las, all three of whom were proteges of Dalai Lama V. Since their time, however, it seems to have disappeared and the Potala archive no longer contains this text. The citations that we have, however, clearly mark it out as an original Tibetan composition (as suggested by Thu'u-bkvan), incorporating both Chinese and Indian motifs. Among the mysterious, shadowy entities dealt with in the Astro­logical texts of this sort are the group known as sa bdag (often equated with Sanskrit bhumipati), 'Lords of the Soil.' There are countless num­bers of these creatures inhabiting the earth and they include within their ranks a king, queen, ministers, courtiers and so forth, in a manner imitative of the structure of society in the human world. Of particular interest to 'terrestrial astrologers,' that is to say, those diviners more properly referred to as geomancers, are the sa bdag of the years, the sa bdag of months, the sa bdag of the cycle of nine numbers (sme ba), the sa bdag of the cycle of eight trigrams (spar kha), and the sa bdag of days (zhag). These groups are all enumerated in the thirty-first chapter of the Va irj.urya dkar-po by sde srid Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho.26 The name Ki-kang occurs three times in our texts. In the zlog pa (averting) rites of Vajrakila (see below, p.258) we find the injunction: \"You must avert the ki kang of the btsan!\" and, also, \"You must avert the ki kang of the planets (gza')!\" Then, in the sri mnan section (p.327), it is noted in passing that the Sri demons are to be separated from their protective gods, \"using the style of ki kang.\" bLo-gros rgyal-mtshan (1552-1624), a teacher widely respected as a scholar of the Vajrakila cycle and whose profound skill in the rites of Vajrakila earned him the epithet sag bzlog pa when he turned away an invading army of Mongol soldiers, wrote a pair of texts entitled gShin rje ki kang gi dbang chog (rites of empowerment for Ki-kang, the Lord of Death) and gShin rje ki kang gi dgra brubs (rites of imprisoning the enemy [from the cycle of] Ki-kang, the Lord of Death). Clearly, the Ki-kang of these texts is of some singular significance but, unfortunately, the texts bearing these titles (listed in the catalogue of bDud-joms rin-po-che's library) are now lost. 26 Phug lugs rtsis kyi legs bshad bai Ij.ur dkar po, published by the Krung-go'i bod-kyi-shes-rig dpe-skrun-khang, 1997"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"In the chapter dealing with marriage in the 'Byung rtsis man ngag zia ba'i 'od zerby Lo-chen Dharmasri, Ki-kang is/are described as malig­nant and harsh. And then, in the root text Va i�urya dkar-po by sde srid Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho we find the name listed among the group of the 49 sa bdag of days.27 In this text it is said: ki kang 'byung ba'i spyi bdud po / gza ' rgod drag po sgra gcan ni / \"With regard to Ki-kang, the demon chief of elemental spirits, the wild, fierce planet Rahu ... \" And thus we see that Ki-kang may be none other than Rahu, the northern node of the moon, variously considered an evil planet responsible for the periodic eclipses of both sun and moon, and a protector of the pro­found esoteric teachings of guhyamantra. According to Varahamihira (Brhat Samhita 111.7), Rahu has 33 comets named Tamasakilaka (Small Kila of Darkness) as his offspring. These appear from time to time as observable disturbances on the surface of the sun (sun spots), which can be correlated to dust-storms, earth­quakes and famines on Earth, as well as to outbreaks of disease and destructive tendencies among men. Writing at the end of the fifth cen­tury CE, Varahamihira was steeped in the ancient tradition of the Vedas, and I cannot help but wonder whether the Tibetan ki kang is not based on Sanskrit kilaka in this usage.28 According to Varahamihira, when these dark spikes assume the form of a raven (dhvarlk�a), their effects are inevitably evil. The principal text dedicated to the demonic protector Rahu in the Tibetan tradition is the bDud bya rag mgo brtsegs gsang ba sgroI byed kyi rgyal po ki kang rag ti'i mdo snying gzer nag po'i rgyud chen po, 'The Great Black Tantra Summarising the Crucial Points of Dark Ki-kang, King of the Secret Liberators, the Raven Demon With a Pile of Heads.'29 In the opening chapter (nidana) of this source we learn of the great rak�asa called Yak�ajvala who blazed with fire upon the summit of Mount Meru and his wife, the naginl Vajraya�i, who heaved with passionate desire in the depths of the great ocean. From the union of these two 27 Chapter XXXI, La zla tshe grangs dus tshod la rgyu ba'i sa bdag skor, The rev­olutions of the sa bdag who move with the years, months, dates and hours. 28 ki kang rag ti is archaic Tibetan, corresponding perfectly to Sanskrit tamasakllaka. 29 Listed as text 931 in volume 46 (mi) of the mTshams-brag edition of the NGB (pp.276-361). The text itself, in 15 chapters, is also called gZa' bdud chen po khyab 'jug gi rgyud, the Tantra of Rahu. Ki-kang rog-ti is also called Ki-kang rak;;a, where rak$a is a Tibetan loan word, meaning 'rak?asa demon,' not the Sanskrit rak$a, meaning 'protection.' xxxv"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"xxxvi were born five children: Ki-kang phung-byed chen-po, 'The Great Bringer of Disaster,' and his four sisters called collectively Ki-kang mgo-brnyan-ma, 'Horrible-Headed Apparitions.' These children promptly began to devour all sentient beings, so the Blessed Lord Bhairava Yamantaka hurled a sharp weapon-wheel at the boy, which cut his body up into eight pieces. Those fragments were then spread out upon the golden disc at the foundation of the universe and pressed down by the weight of Mount Meru and the seven rings of cosmic mountains. At the same time, the four sisters were arranged beneath the four corners of the central king of cosmic mountains. Despite all this, however, it was not possible to completely cover those four sis­ters and so they rose up again. And, as for their brother, a new Ki-kang arose from each of the fragments of his body and thus those Ki-kang multiplied and covered the world. Wandering wherever fancy took them, their unpredictable movements brought chaos and destruction to the world. Again Bhairava Yamantaka rose up against them and sub­dued them and they submitted to him and they surrendered the mantra of their life force and offered oaths of fealty. Vajrabhairava, being pleased, accepted their vows and gave them permission to move in cer­tain directions at specific times. Thus, a multiplicity of demons become a singular body and in the Va i4urya dkar-po, the most important text on astrology in the Tibetan tradition, we read: stag rta khyi gsum zla ba la I beo lnga nyi shu brgyad la rgyu I phag lug yos gsum gnyis gsum la I byi 'brug sprel gsum beo brgyad dang I nyi shu brgyad rg yu bya glang sbrul I beu drug nyer drug dag la rgyu II \"During the three months of Tiger, Horse and Dog, he moves on the 15th (the day of the full moon) and the 28th.

During the three months of Bird, Ox and Snake he moves on the 16th and the 26th.\" In the Ki kang rag ti'i mdo snying gzer nag po'i rgyud, the group of Ki­kang are referred to as 'great sages' (drang srong chen po) and described as having the body of a rak�asa (derived from their father) with the tail of a snake (inherited from the mother) and a pile of nine ugly heads, the uppermost of which is that of a black raven.3D This raven head is believed to be especially pernicious, such that whomsoever passes beneath its shadow will suffer fits of apoplexy. When he moves in the night, he conquers the four directions. When he moves during the day, 30 Tibetan icons, however, almost invariably depict Rahu with ten heads."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"he overthrows the four intermediate directions. Moving through the sky between heaven and earth, he burns the entire traidhatuka. He inflicts infectious diseases upon man and beast and devours the sun and the moon. His natural home is in the southwest but, when inter­cepting the moon, he moves towards the east and, when intercepting the sun, he moves towards the west. When he dwells at the bottom of the ocean, he agitates all the naga so that they send forth lightning, hail and earthquakes. He is described as the great demon of the five ele­ments and, in Chapter IV of his tantra, he is called by a different name and said to perform a different act of wickedness in every direction. Then, within the eighth chapter of this tantra, at the end of a long and elaborate description of all the planetary demons roaming the sky, each of which is understood to be a manifestation of the great demon Rahu, it is said that they all \"cause the ki kang of worldly destruction to descend\" ('jig rten phung ba'i ki kang 'bebs). Then, again, in Chapter IX of his tantra, this great offspring of a rak?asa and a naga is said to dwell \"in the ma1}4ala of the interplay of hatred and desire\" as the leader of the ten non-virtues and the five poi­sons. Although he has only one body, he has nine different heads: the head of Vitripatra causes a great hailstorm of violent ki kang of the rak?asas to descend. The head of Phung-byed srin-po ra-hu-la perpet­ually sends down the ki kang of lightning and hail. The head of 'Jigs­byed gza'-bdud sgra-gcan-'dzin perpetually sends down the ki kang of impenetrable knives that sever the life force. The head of Du-ba mjug­rings chen-po causes the descent of the ki kang of fearful agitation and the breakdown of stability and order. The head of Khyab-'jug chen-po sprul-pa'i-sku sends down the ki kang of all the troublesome gods and demons. The head of dMu-bdud byi-snu ra-ja sends down the great ki kang of suddenly-arising warfare. The head of the demonic Ca-ra-ka sends down the ki kang of unexpected violence. The head of 'Jigs-byed ljang-sngon dmag-dpon sends down the ki kang of lightning and hail that cuts in various ways. And the uppermost head of the black raven sends down the ki kang of earthquake, frost and hail, destroyed crops, famine, and all manner of devastation and evil disease. Thus we may understand that the ki kang referred to in our literature are those 'spikes of darkness' (tamasakHaka, ki kang rag ti) of the celestial sphere, the destructive aspects of nature that bring ruin and disaster upon the world.

In all such rituals, an effigy of the enemy to be destroyed is bombarded with noxious substances such as mustard seeds, poisonous blood and the smoke of crystal myrrh, so that the enemy becomes weakened and may thus more easily be overpowered. Within the sri mnan ritual texts, also, mention is several times made of \"items that ward off the demons of slander\" (mi kha'i rdzas).31 It is taken for granted that the reader is a ritual specialist familiar with these magical items and attendant techniques. Our author, Rig-' dzin Padma 'phrin-Ias, wrote the mi kha khrom bskyur zab mo, listed in the Potala Palace archives but not available to me for consultation. Perhaps his text bears some close relationship to that of his younger contemporary, bZhad-pa'i rdo-rje (born 1697), who wrote the mi kha khrom sgyur gyi las mtha' bdud rtsi'i rgyun 'bab. Another contemporary, Dri-med gling-pa (1700-1775), wrote the 'Chi bslu bdud bzhi gYul bzlog gi mi kha bzlog pa'i Ihan thabs dgra bgegs dpung 'joms. Others in the genre include early gter ma texts of the 'thread cross' ritual type (mdos), such as the Mi kha bzlog mdos included in the brTan ma bcu gnyis kyi mdos chen collection, and later texts by Ngag-dbang blo-bzang don-grub (19th century), who invoked the powerful protectors leam-sring and dPal-ldan lha-mo to effect this task (mi kha 'i 'phrin bcol).32 We must suppose that such texts provide full details of these \"items that ward off the mi kha,\" just as the items that subjugate the Sri are detailed in the sri mnan texts. Within our sources, we read that the most important of the ritual ingredients for warding off the Sri are beer, pol­luted with various poisons and blood, the metallic dust derived from the sharpening of swords and battle axes and so forth, a red triangular bali cake smeared with blood mixed with poison, iron filings, copper fil­ings, bell metal filings, water cress plants, and yellow mineral earth. Other items include broken pieces of stone from a mountain avalanche, dust from the navel of a millstone, salt, capsicum pepper, and white and black mustard seeds. \"Fumigating the Sri with incense made of 31 mi kha are the malicious forces of arrogance, vindictiveness, resentment, jealousy, spite, false charges, calumny, slander and destructive gossip.

Most important of all, however, are the three items of salt, soda and borax which are renowned as the three special substances for the destruction of the Sri. At the time of pressing down, the necessary items are the blackened pieces of burnt wood, salt, borax, soda, an upper millstone inscribed with Mount Meru and the four major and the eight minor continents, a tombstone inscribed with a visvavajra, some cloth of black goat's wool or the lower garment of a widow or widower, thread of five different colours, five varieties of herbal medicine, various coloured silks, five varieties of precious jewel, earth from the foundation of an ancient stupa, some kind of goat hair (ra spu bzhud rna), and items similar to those used in order to overthrow the rni kha.

This being an opportunity to benefit others by bringing about knowledge for their sake, I have composed this [text entitled] \"the very clear [teaching concerning] the essence of practising the com­plete series of ritual\" [636] in which the manner of reading the liturgi­cal text is made simple. Within this system, being empowered by the buddhas of the five families, Vairocana and the rest, one enjoys the melodious songs of the mothers of those families, Vajradhatvisvari and the rest.

With regard to that - here, in this very clear set of instructions con­cerning the essential stages of the proper series of ritual activities for the worship of the blzagavat Vajrakumara whilst accomplishing the ma1!t;iala, there are three sections: Preparation, Main practice and Subsequent"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"activities. [73] Thus 1 will describe first of all, the preparatory rites which are to be performed by one who is established on the foundation of practice by reliance on the five excellences of teacher, retinue, place, teachings, and time.2 Then, secondly, I will explain at length the vari­ous phases of activity for the preliminary approach to the ma/:ujala fol­lowing the prescriptions for the rituals of service and attainment (seviisiidhanii) as found in the authoritative texts of our tradition, and [thirdly] with regard to the subsequent activities, 1 will explain the sequencial stages for the elaborate performance of the deeds of final resort. PREPARATION (prayoga) With regard to the first of these, it is a general requirement that one who holds to the foundation of practice by means of the five excellences should perform the [earth] rituals. These are widely taught in tantra of the Early Translation School under five headings: (1) Investigation (bhu­parik?ii), (2) Acceptance (Ograha), (3) Purification (Osodhana), (4) Holding (Oparigraha) [963] and (5) Protection (Orak?ii). (1) As for the first of this series, investigation [of the qualities of the ma1J4ala-holding earth], it is not necessary to explain the facts of this rite as they can be learned elsewhere} [637] (2) Secondly, acceptance [of the site] has two parts: (a) Acceptance from a visible [landlord] and (b) acceptance from an invisible. (a) Firstly, with regard to acceptance from the visible, having agreed the rental with the landlord, it is not necessary in this ritual text to discuss [such procedures as] taking up residence, etc. (b) Secondly, it being necessary to begin [the series of] rituals with accepting the site from the invisible [spirits of the soil], [I quote] in this regard what is written in the Thugs gsang ba sku'i rgyud of the Northern Treasures Vajrakila:4 2 See A Bolt of Lightning from the Blue pp.143-153 3 See A Bolt of Lightning from the Blue pp.l44ff 4 * Cittaguhyaktlya-tantra (Chapter III, dkyil 'khor bsnyen pa > ma1Jljaliisevita) A3 [24], BI0 [507], Cl [7] 125"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"126 4�a·lq�\"-l�·�·�Q]�·�·� ��·Q]�l·rl.l·l�t�rqf:l\\·�Q]�·� �·qlz:rr�·q�·�Q]·�� �Q]�·q�:l\\·a,i'€�Q]�·�rl.l·��· � l·� �Q]·t��Q]·�Q]�·q:l\\·!�} In an extremely isolated place Construct the ma1Jejala on the nodal point of the site.

[964] Thus, in accordance with the received system of our own tradition, there is no error here in abandoning the weari­some [task of] sealing the klla with a seal, as otherwise taught only in the Sa-skya school. Then, on the site where the ma1J�ala of whatever kind is to be con­structed, one arranges a bouquet of flowers with a handful of grain for Prthivi, the Earth Goddess, on top of the drops of perfume that indicate the ma1J�ala [layout]. Then, in front of that, one sets out the bali for the Earth Goddess and the drinking water and the feet-cooling water together with the rest of the series of five upacara in an elegant row (sbreng tshar). To the right and left [638] one sets out the white and red bali, and so on. Then, having gathered together all the offerings (for the ma1J�ala) such as the refreshing water and so on, and the nectar, bali and blood, as taught in the main texts for the rite of self generation, the master and disciples sit down comfortably together in orderly assem­bly and sing the preliminary sections - the Seven Line Prayer which is the root of all guruyoga practices, the lineage prayer, the refuge prayer, and the arousal of bodhicitta - followed by the main text of the Phur pa dril sgrub.7 [75] This text should be read straight through until the visualisation of the ma1J�ala is complete and the pride of oneself as the deity is perfect and the mantra recitation has been properly per­formed.

Then, from the realm of emptiness, a precious container is generated from the syllable OM [965] and the three syllables OM AI:! HaM melt into it.

MAIN PRACTICE (mauli) The second general topic is a full explanation of the various stages of activity for the preliminary approach to the mmy;/ala in accordance with the prescriptions for the rituals of service and attainment as found in the authoritative texts of our tradition. This section has five parts: (1) The outer boundary consists of setting up cairns for the four great kings. [976] (2) The intermediate boundary consists of suppressing the vow-breaking demons and fixing plaques over the door. (3) The inner boundary consists of slaying Matrangara Rudra. (4) The secret bound­ary must also be established, and, (5) erecting the mm;lgaIa, the rituals of service and attainment are performed. (1) With regard to the first of these, in the four cardinal direc­tions around one's meditation hut one erects cairns of stone and, [86] in a convenient place inside the hut, one pins up a small piece of wood or cotton canvas (tsa ka Ii) upon which have been painted images of the four great kings. In front of this painting one sets out a white bali cake for each of them and the five general offerings beginning with bowls of water (arghya). Assuming the pride of oneself as the deity, one goes to the foot of the stone in the eastern direction and sets out a bali cake and all the other offerings which one then purifies with incense smoke. Emerging from the condition of emptiness one imagines a syllable OM which trans­forms into precious jewelled containers, vast and deep, and these are filled within by a syllable HOM which melts down and arises as refresh­ing water, flowers, incense, butter-lamps, perfume, divine food, music and sacrificial cakes of unimpeded radiance, all established as the per­fect articles of the gods. The offering articles are blessed by name, argham, pu?pe and so on down to sabda Al:f HOM, and the bali cake by three recitations of the syllables OM Al:f HOM. The stone cairn is then purified with incense smoke and, arising from the condition of empti­ness, the cairn [648] becomes a measureless divine palace. Then a white syllable HUM radiates out from one's heart and enters that palace from 139"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"140 where it sends out rays of white light which make offerings to the noble ones and perform deeds for the benefit of sentient beings.

The offering bali for Yama should be purified with incense smoke and blessed in the same way that the cairns for the four great kings were purified and blessed above.

The meaning of this is said in the general authoritative texts of the Old Translation school to be twofold: Subjugating by means of dhar­maW and subjugating by means of ritual. As for the first of these, the essence of Rudra is clinging to the reality of appearances. But, if ego­grasping is annihilated by cutting it off at the root, this is called subju­gation by means of dharmafa.

Thus, outwardly, there is the dismembered trunk of Matrangara [101] whilst, inwardly, it is believed to be the divine ma�1�ala palace of heruka Vajrakila. In general there are many points to be decided here concerning the slaughter of Matrangara. In particular, when the distribution of his body parts was discussed above, it was said that his head was in the south but now it is said to be placed in the southwest. If you wonder whether this is an error, it is not. When it is said that the ma1Jtjala palace, in general, is composed of his cadaver, the head as the chief member of the whole body faces towards the southwest. But [659] when it comes to the displacement of his body parts at the time of his slaughter, we must take into account the earlier description of the eight great charnel grounds, within which it is written: His heart fell to the east, the Chilly Grove (Sitavana) charnel ground. His head to the south, the charnel gound of Bodies' End (Bimbani$patti). [991] Since the facts are clearly stated in such sources, we must under­stand the matter in accordance with the authoritative pronouncements of the received tradition. In the bKa' brgyad and other texts it is taught that, previously, at the time of both 'holding' and 'protecting' the site, a single striking kila was to be embedded into the ma1J�ala centre, and now, at this point, it is explained that klla are to be set up in the ten directions. However, because we have already embedded klla as the protectors of the ten directions, it is unnecessary to do it here again. On the other hand, if the holding and protecting rites were formerly accomplished merely by means of the stomping dance of the ten wrathful kings, it is per­missable to perform the embedding of all the kila at this junction, as one wishes. (4) Setting up the secret boundary. If we were to summarise all the ritual aspects of establishing the outer and the inner boundaries, they are nothing more than a mental drama.

If the rite is to be performed in brief, at the end of the mantra recitation, one exhorts the deities to action [by means of the DHADHI mantra] and presents them with offerings and praise. [107] One then exhorts the lineage of vidyadhara to give their blessings. Finally, after all this, one should present offerings to the deities once again, sing hymns in their praise, and request them to forgive what­ever errors have been committed in the performance of the rite, all in the usual manner. Within the preparatory rite of our own tradition, the authoritative sources do not speak of a prayer requesting the deities to abide on the site. In the Phur pa spu gri texts of Guru Chos-dbang, however, it is written: � �n,r��·qqlQj·QQj·�O\\1�.r��:�q·��·q��\"t.l·n.J·��·q�·q�n.J·q��l��· q�·�·l��·OI1·��·q��\"t.l·�l\"t.l·�l·�OI1�·�·Qf�·n.J·���·q�·OI1�\\\\i·��n.J·� 33 From the Phur 'grel 'bum nag we can see that this mantra belongs to the four Bhllmipati sisters.

In preparation for this, therefore, all you host of gods in the malJ�ala of Vajrakila, everyone of you without exception, must please be present in this place.\" This prayer should be repeated three times, and then, with the mantra HOM VAJRA SUPRATI$THA and raising the mudra to the sky, one imagines that they take their places like an over arching network of light. [998] Presenting them with offerings by reciting OM SRlVAJRA­KUMARA SAPARlV ARAARGHAM and so on, they are praised within the depths of fire at the end of the aeon.34 Then one should gather up the heaps of grain, the offerings and the bali cakes. (e) Fifthly, applying the colours: [665] Mixing together the previously blessed five coloured powders - blue, green, red, yellow and white - smear the centre of the ma1J�ala with this whilst reciting E YAM RASU KEM RAM BHROM. The purpose of this is to build up a foundation of the elements in due order with Mount Meru [above, and the ma1Jljala palace on its peak]. The way [the ma1Jljala palace] is drawn is this: In the centre is a dark blue triangle, with its apex pointing to the front. Around this is a circle of half-moons and a moat of blood with a wall of skulls at its circumference. Next is a blue wheel with ten spokes, an ocean of blood being visible between the spokes. Raised on a green background are [four] courtyards, [108] the colours of the directions. The doorways are festooned with hanging banners, in the usual man­ner, and there is a lotus wall. Then, a circle of charnel grounds, a vajra garland and a mountain of fire should all be beautifully drawn. Now, signs for the deities should be arranged as follows: Although it is usually necessary to set out seed-syllables as signs of speech, hand implements as the insignia of mind, or such things as heaps of pow­dered pigment in conformity with the body colours of the deities, in this case such symbols are not required because of the placement of an individual kila for each deity. On the other hand, because it is difficult to obtain a full set of kila sufficient to include all the oath-bound pro­tectors, [999] deity marks may be set out to substitute for these. In this case, it is said: \"generally, the three groups of red and black protectors are to be arranged in the courtyards.\" Although this is said, it is not always so.

It being like this, so it is to be understood.

Further, with regard to the malJ.�ala, for the rites of empowerment it should always be constructed of coloured powders [1000] in the man­ner just explained. In cases where considerations of time and space do not permit the construction of a malJ.�ala of coloured powders, how­ever, it is permissable to use one painted on cloth of the proper meas­urements. In that case, the rituals of the lines and colours may be dispensed with and, when it comes to the placement of the deities, drops of perfume should be arranged on the malJ.�ala, with a handful of grain or flowers placed on top of those. It should be done in just this way for all ritual activities, other than when simply presenting offer­ings. (f) Sixthly, with regard to the material requisites: When the rites of evo­cation are for the purpose of empowerment, the necessities are such items as the initiation flasks and so on,38 as specified in the authorita­tive literature on empowerment.

Nevertheless, it would not be fitting to act as if we were unable to [understand all that is necessary] from the many other details given. [Thus,] setting up just one iconic kila as the lord of the malJ.�ala, it is then necessary to perform the ritual of bestowing blessings upon it. [667] As it says in the authoritative text for the Black Razor (spu gri nag po) empowerment:39 For each kila, equal in number to the deities of the malJ.�ala, There are eight rites of ritual blessing to be performed. Thus, in accordance with what is written here, [110J there should be one kila for each of the deities, from the lord and his consort [in the cen­tre of the malJ.�ala] out to the oath-bound protectors and the Isvari god­desses [at the peripheryJ, and also an activity kila for striking the enemy and so on. To have all of these is best, but, in the absence of a complete set, the indispensible items are: the lord Vajrakila, the ten wrathful kings, the twenty devourers and killers, the four gate-keeping god­desses (all of which are to be placed upon the malJ.�ala), [lOO1J and a 38 Including the victory flask (vijayakalasa) and the activity flask (kammkalasa). 39 A14, B63, C20: rDo rje phur pa' i spu gri nag po' i dbang chog (8 folios).

The so-called rDo rje phur pa dril sgrub kyi 'phrin las is really made up of the medium Klla Razor meditation in combination with an extensive portion of ritual activity. Furthermore, [1009] the text itself opens with a bilingual title page and then a salutation, after which it says: \"Padmasambhava studied the hundred thousand sections of the Kilavidyottama-tantra and then practised it for twelve human years in the rock cavern of g Ya' -ri-gong. The ritual form of his practice is exactly the one given here.\" And, as it is stated, this is just what he did. Taking the path of clearly visualising himself in the guise of Vajra­kumara, [674] the text says: HOM In an instant of perfect mindfulness I arise in the form of the great glorious Vajrakumara. And with these words one enters the practice.47 Then, maintaining that position, one emanates miniature wrathful forms and gives orders. HOM Listen here, all you obstructors and misleaders! With these words and so on, the outer boundary is closed.48 HOM I am Vajrakumara and ... With these words and so on, the middle boundary is closed.49 47 5tidhana text (above) p.13ff 48 5tidhana text (above) p.l5 49 5tidhana text (above) pp.15-16 181"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"182 HOM As for what is above - there is an awning made of kila and ...

They are then addressed with the words: All you buddhas of the three times, without exception, please listen to me!S1 One then confesses all wrongdoings before them, opens the symbolic doors, salutes the symbols [1010] and binds oneself under oath. All of this is to be done in the usual way. After that, the invitation of the deities of confession is extended to include all the guru, deva and 4tikini of the ten directions, together with the Conquerors and their sons. This is accomplished by singing the words, From the blazing mafy;lala of the blue-black triangle ... [and so on]52 in a melodious voice, to the accompaniment of musical instruments.

[675] Reciting the verse beginning with these words, together with the appropriate mantra, in due order, one meditates upon the three samadhi and gradually brings forth the elements of material existence, culmi­nating with Mount Meru.55 Mount Meru itself is imbedded like a klla [into the elemental ground], the upper vast knot of the klla being the splendid castle of the gods above the summit of the mountain, and within this upper vast knot one should meditate upon the divine palace and the deities of the triple ma1J4ala. The sharp tip of the klla penetrates down to the tenth level of hell and the lower vast knot contains the realm of desire. [1011] The lower portion of the eight-sided handle extends throughout the realm of form and the formless realm is above this, encompassed by the upper portion of the handle. This klla which pervades the traidhatuka like this [119] is the cosmic klla (bhavaklla). Further, that ma1J4ala palace within the upper vast knot, exceedingly large in extent and fully adorned with all symbols, is not to be distin­guished from the constructed ma1J4ala [upon the altar]. Clearly medi­tating upon oneself as Vajrakumara in its centre, one visualises one's retinue of ten wrathful kings, together with their consorts and emanated servants and gatekeepers, in the cardinal and intermediate directions, above and below. This is called 'the ma1J4ala of wrathful kings in the ten directions.' In front of oneself, in the space between oneself and Krodhavijaya in the east of that ma1J4ala of wrathful kings of the ten directions, should be placed the material ma1J4ala of spikes consisting of both the ma1J4ala palace and the retinue of deities, set out as described above. This generation in front, according to a certain verse, should appear like the clear reflection of images in a mirror. It is known as 'the materially constructed ma1J4ala' and, in the main rit­ual texts, it is referred to with the words \"generating the Supreme Son(s).\" The clear [self]-visualisation outlined in the liturgy of the Dril sgrub, in conjunction with meditation upon the body mar:z4ala [676] as 55 Sadhana text (above) pp.22-23 183"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"184 detailed in the supplementary texts, is known as 'the fundamental ma1J�ala of the primorial state.' The mode of meditation upon these three ma1J�ala is, [1012] in truth, the most special legacy to have been passed down through the aural lineage of the succession of vidyadhara. With regard to the term 'Supreme Son(s)' as applied [120] to the manifest ma1J�ala of material klla in the ritual texts, this is described within the cycle of our Treasure texts in the invocation section of the lCags khang ma:56 As for the Supreme Son kila in the material ma1J�ala, This is made of iron or hard (black) wood. The perfectly fashioned klla of which this ma1J�ala is composed Has eight wrathful kings bound up in the vast knot on its head And eight wrathful queens bound up in the vast knot at its waist. The group of 20 animal-headed messengers are in its octagonal handle. The wrathful king Hllffikara is on top of its head And the wrathful king Mahabala is at the tip of the triangular spike. From a bindu of bodhicitta within its inner cavity Arises the glorious lord and his consort dwelling in their palace. What is said here is only one definition of the Supreme Son and one should understand the configuration of signs in the materially manifest ma1J�ala in this way, without making the mistake of grasping at it as being something inherently real. On the other hand, however, at the point where we recite the verse in the liturgy that begins \"HUM Vajra­kila, the Supreme heart Son ... ,\"57 it is required that one meditates upon oneself in the form of the chief Kila (Vajrakila) and [1013] meditates upon the 'striking kila' that has been set up in front of oneself as the Supreme Son. Then again, in the practice of Mahottarakila it is the kila of the four activities that are so designated and that which is to be clearly visualised in the present case [677] is not required in other cases. Accordingly, having generated all three ma1J�ala together with Supreme Sons, in the case of two of the ma1J�ala (the ma1J�ala of materially created klla and that of the wrathful kings of the ten directions), oath-bound 56 C25: rDo rje phur pa lcags khang nag po'i bstod pa pp.270-271.

[Ideally,] one should practise by generating each one in due order whilst reciting their individual mantra and verses of invo­cation. Because, however, there would be so much to do if all the 12 oath-bound goddesses and the three groups of Rosewood, Iron and Conch and all the rest were to be individually visualised and then sep­arately praised and exhorted to action, therefore, in the authoritative texts for our particular lineage of the Northern Treasures Vajrakila there are both extensive and abbreviated liturgies of praise and exhortation, with several different descriptions of their forms, hand symbols and mounts. From among these, one should generate them in accordance with the liturgy taken from the bKa' brgyad rang shar in which the oath­bound protectors are exhorted to action. There exists, furthermore, a stream of various accurate and inaccu­rate descriptions of the mother goddesses and their brothers in the three groups of Rosewood, Iron and Conch. Not all of these separate traditions derive from the authentic root texts and oral commentaries but are taught, instead, on the basis of individual fancy. Now I will write something to try and clarify this issue: [1014] In the eastern sector of the inner courtyard, the black Remati rolls a kila. She has long hair and is mounted upon a three-legged mule. Dark yellow Reti wears a cloak of peacock feathers. She rolls a kila and is mounted upon a blue water-buffalo. Dark red Remaja is dressed in cloth of black yak wool. She rolls a kila and is mounted upon a female deer. Dark green Remaju wears clothing of black silk. [678] She rolls a kila and is mounted upon a camel. This group is known as the four Reti sisters or the four Mahatma goddesses. Now, as for the kila which are the hand implements of these four Reti sisters [122], although these are said in the books to be made of a transparent, semi-precious stone (cornelian ?), the type which is known as 'supreme kila' is explained as actually being made of a human leg. In the southern sector of the inner courtyard, the dark blue rDo-rje Ya-byin has long hair tipped with iron spikes and she wields an iron klla. Her mount is a black horse. Yellow rDo-rje De-byin has long hair tipped with golden spikes and she wields a golden kila. Her mount is a yellow horse of the planets. Red rDo-rje bSe-byin has long hair tipped with spikes of rosewood and she wields a rosewood kila. Her mount is a horse of the btsan demons with a red muzzle.

She rolls an iron klla and she rides upon a nine-headed iron wolf. The green-blue Kukkura58 has a turquoise head. She rolls a turquoise klla and she rides upon a turquoise bitch. The yellow Srilamukha or Srilamukha has a golden head. She rolls a kila of gold and she rides upon a yellow wild hill dog with eight tongues. The red Srgalamukha has a head of copper. She rolls a copper klla and she rides upon a copper-coloured vixen with three legs. [679] These are the four dog-faced sisters. [123] Although a number of different appellations exist for these four dog-faced mother goddesses, what I have written here is without artifice. Now, as for the way in which the three groups of Rosewood, Iron and Conch are to be generated in the charnel grounds: While the 12 oath-bound mother goddesses are being established in the inner court­yards, the males in the three groups of Rosewood, Iron and Conch are established in the charnel grounds, and these two sets are established like brothers and sisters, which is explained as wisdom and means. As it is said by mNga' -ris pal).-chen rin-po-che in his bKa' brgyad rnam gsum lha'i mtshan don tha ram, \"The four great Kirilkara stand to the right of the four Svanrnukha. [1016] The four Mara stand to the right of the four Mahatma. The four Puru�a stand to the right of the four Bhumipati.\" And, in complete agreement with what is written here, his own teacher, the great and vastly learned bLo-mchog rDo-rje of sMan-lung, said in his bKa' brgyad bstod chen gong ma'i zhallung, \"It is explained that the three groups of Rosewood, Iron and Conch are to be separately understood in this way: Standing in a row to the right of the four Svanrnukha are the brothers of these mother goddesses, the four Puru�a-kirilkara.

I maintain, how­ever, that the mother goddesses are to be positioned within the inner courtyard of the ma1!4ala palace, whilst the groups of males are to be placed within the charnel grounds which are outside the ma1!4ala, because this is how it is described in the tantra texts: In the eastern sec­tor of the charnel grounds are found the brothers of the four Mahatma­devi or Remati sisters, the four purufJa of Iron. In the east is the white mara who wields a kila of conch. In the south is the blue mara wielding a kila of turquoise. In the west is the black mara who wields a noose. In the north is the green mara wielding kila and sword. In the southern sector of the charnel grounds are found the brothers of rDo-rje Ya-byin and her Bhllmipati sisters, the four purufJa of Conch. Pramaraja, the kimkara of the rakfJasa, is white in colour and he rolls a kila of conch in his hands. Yamaraja, the kimkara of the yama, is blue in colour and he rolls a kila of sword-steel in his hands. Dasagriva, the kimkara of the mara, is red in colour and he rolls a klla of sword-steel in his hands. [1018] Yak�agriva, [681] the kimkara of the yakfJa, is yellow in colour and rolls a golden kila.59 These four are all military commanders. In the northern sector of the charnel grounds are the brothers of the four Svanmukha sisters, the four skyes bu (purufJa) of Rosewood: Rak�asa-puru�a is white in colour and he wields a kila of conch shell. Yama-puru�a is black in colour and he wields a klla of iron. Ya-bdud­puru�a is red in colour and wields a kila of copper. Yak�a-puru�a is blue in colour and he wields a kila of turquoise. The way in which all these Kila protectors are to be visualised would seem a trifling matter to get straight and yet, when we look into it, there is a great deal of confusion which is difficult to put in order.

Because this is such a vitally important point, they have been carefully disentangled and explained here in accordance with the oral commentaries of the gurus of our lineage. Having meditated upon all of the Kila protectors, those bound under oath and the goddesses who guard the ma1J�ala gates, in both the ma1;14ala of wrathful kings in the ten directions and the ma1J�ala of materially constructed kila, one should generate the life force as wis­dom (i.e. the jiianasattva) and bestow the empowerment of the life force as follows: Holding the triple ma1J�ala as the necessary object of visu­alisation, invite the gods who are to bestow the empowerment - the male and female buddhas of the five families, together with the male and female bodhisattvas, the male and female wrathful ones and all the vidyadhara, [1019] to come from Akani�tha heaven [126] and be pres­ent in the sky before one.

More­over, while these empowerments are being bestowed, the consorts of these five sing vajra songs, all the male bodhisattva recite verses of aus­picious benediction, the female bodhisattva present offerings, the wrathful kings drive out all obstructing demons, and so on. All of these activities constitute the bestowal of the vase empowerment upon the deities of the triple ma1J�ala. Then all of the male and female deities of empowerment join together in sexual congress and the bodhicitta of their union being absorbed into the triple ma1J�ala through the crown 60 5adhana text (above) p.42 61 5adhana text (above) pp.42-43"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"of the head constitutes the secret empowerment.

After that, one recites, HOM The united glory of all the sugata of the past, present and future .. .77 and so on. And with these words one praises [all the deities of the malJ�ala].

In the usual way of ritual procedure, this begins, HOM With myself clearly visualised as Vajrakila, In my heart is the jiianasattva .. .78 and so on.

Thus, in general, when the ritual service is to be performed on its own and not in con­junction with the rites of attainment, one visualises an image of Vajrakumara, similar to oneself, on top of the Supreme Son Kila. Rays of light radiate out from his heart and return and, at the end of that process, the jiianasattva is absorbed into that Supreme Son Kila of ritual service so that it becomes a younger brother samayasattva. Then one visualises those rays of light emerging through one's nostril and then being drawn back in and so forth (as explained below). Alternatively, one may set up the central klla of the malJ�ala as a substitute for the 77 Sadhana text (above) pp.58-59 78 Sadhana text (above) pp.60-61 193"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"194 Supreme Son kIla, in which case it is necessary to visualise the genera­tion of Vajrakila and his consort. [130] When the rites of service and attainment are to be performed side by side, at the time of the great attainment one visualises oneself as the lord Vajrakumara complete with body ma1J�ala, united with his consort as chief of the ma1J�ala of wrathful kings in the ten directions, and thus oneself is the fundamen­tal ma1J�ala of the natural condition. And in that case, between oneself and Krodhavijaya, who stands before one in the east together with his consort and the devourer and killer who are their emanated messen­gers, is set out Vajrakumara and his consort, ruler of the constructed ma1J�ala of material kIla, [1024] from whose heart rays of light radiate out and return in a continuously circulating stream. In the oral instruc­tions of the gurus it is explained that there is a jnanasattva the size of one's thumbtip, of similar form to oneself but unadorned and without hand implements, residing in the hearts of both oneself as Vajrakumara and the Vajrakumara generated in front. In the heart of the jnanasattva there is a solar cushion upon which rests a nine-pronged vajra [686] similar to a grain of barley standing on its end. In the navel of that vajra is a solar cushion upon which stands the life force of the heart, a blue syllable HOM, with the words OM VAJRAK1U KlLAYA SARVA VIGH­NAN BAM HOM PHA T JAJ:I HOM AI:J all around its edge. The letters of this mantra are all golden in colour, as fine as if painted with the tip of a single hair, and they encircle the HOM in a clockwise direction, facing inwards. Rays of light, blazing like the heart of the sun, stream forth from the life force HOM in the heart of both oneself as Vajrakila and the Vajrakila generated in front, as well as from their encircling garlands of mantra, and these carry clouds of offerings on their tips which they spread out and present to the conquerors of the ten directions and their sons. Then they act for the benefit of all sentient beings. Gathering back together, those light rays [131] are absorbed into oneself so that all the afflictions, sins, obscurations and subtle karmic traces of body, speech and mind are cleared away just like the darkness at sunrise. [1025] This meditation is known as ritual service (seva). Then again, rays of light stream forth to all the buddhas, bod­hisattvas, heroes, fiakini and Dharma-protectors and, when the lights are returned to the deities of the ma1Jqlala of Vajrakumara, they carry with them the forms of the individual seed-syllables of those deities and then the forms of their personal weapons and insignia and so on, all of which are absorbed into the triple ma1Jqlala. Then those light rays blaze forth again and the whole outer container of the world becomes"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"transformed into the divine maJ:lIf-ala palace and all the inner contents of sentient beings become deities in the retinue of Vajrakumara. And all beings in the world recite together the mantra of Vajrakila which is absorbed into the maJ;lt;ia/a. And at the end of the meditation session, all those who know this method of recitation will find that the Kila images and so on which are the support for their meditation are glowing with increased light due to having absorbed the light of the mantra from the whole of space. This is the visualisation either for the self-blessing or the rite of attainment (sadhana). Rays of light in one's heart rise upwards through the central prong of the vajra [687] until they come out through the right nostril of the jfianasattva. They continue to rise until they come out through one's own right nostril and then they enter the left nostril of the Vajrakila generated in front. Entering his body in a continuous chain, they pass through the left nostril of the jiianasattva in his heart and so on down through the central prong of the vajra. Revolving the mantra garland around the seed-syllable in the centre, they arouse within him his mind of steadfast pleasure. Ascending once more through the central prong of the vajra, the rays of light come out through the right nostril of the jfianasattva and so on up until they come out [1026] through the right nostril of the lord and then [132] they enter the left nostril of oneself in the form of Vajrakila. Continuing downwards, they enter the left nos­tril of the jiianasattva in one's heart and so on down through the central prong of the vajra. Revolving the mantra garland around the seed-syl­lable in one's very centre, this takes on the appearance of a fiercely whirling firebrand (alatacakra). This method of recitation is known as 'secondary ritual service' (upaseva) or else 'circular recitation' (do Ii). The reason why it is called circular recitation is because it appears to cycle both to and fro. At the end of the meditation session, rays of white light shine forth from all the deities in the triple maJ;lt;iala and pacify all the sins, obscu­rations, sicknesses and demonic interferences of oneself and all others. And rays of yellow light shine forth which gather up all the lifespan, glory, and excellent qualities of the whole world of phenomenal appearances, both smnsara and nirviiJ;la, which are absorbed into oneself so that these virtues are increased. And rays of red light shine forth like iron hooks which gather the whole world of phenomenal appear­ances, both worldly and transcendental, under one's power. And rays of dark green light shine forth like sparks from a fire in the form of sharp-pointed weapons which violently annihilate all those enemies 195"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"196 and obstructors who interrupt one's progress. [688] This contempla­tion of the four ritual activities is known as mahasadhana, 'the great attainment. ' Thus there are many ways in which one may visualise the radiation and return of light and, whichever system suits one's purpose, the mind should engage in it full of hope and confidence. When one grows weary of radiating and gathering, one should continue the recitation with the mind resting on the forms of the deities of the triple malJqala. [1027] Whilst reciting, one should imagine that all of those deities are murmuring the natural sound of the mantra with their mouths and it is particularly important that one maintains the view of oneself as the genuine Vajrakila and recites in that state. All of those methods of visualising light radiating out and gather­ing back together, furthermore, have been taught by those who are skilled in ritual methods as being of great help in the development of samadhi. [133] When the mind becomes tired, seeing all appearances like chaff and holding nothing whatsoever in the mind, allow the consciousness to relax completely and then gradually restore one's focus before contin­uing to the end of the mantra recitation. And one should engage in this practice by gradually training the mind through the six parameters and four styles of appraisal and exegesis of the doctrines of guhyamantra.79 At the conclusion of that recitation session, say: . �.� ��.�.���.����.�� ��·qEl��·5.l��·�·�·711·� qWq���·��·q���·�·� 79 rntha' drug dang tshul bzhi, the 'six parameters (of elucidation) and four styles (of interpretation),' which are the indispensable keys for unlocking the meaning of tantra.

[691] With these verses and the rest, taken from the supplementary text (rDo rje phur pa'i zur 'debs), one summons all the vidyadhara of the lineage.82 Now, it may be supposed that an error has been made in the latter part of the text because the two masters, Sakyaprabha of 'Chims and dPal-gyi dbang-phyug of mKhar-chen, [do not belong to our Northern Treasures lineage] but only to the general lineage of bKa'-ma and gTer-ma. Nevertheless our text says, \"Sakyaprabha, the teacher from mChims, showed the signs of success in a small precipitous cav-81 Sadhana text (above) p.71 82 Sadhana text (above) pp.71-82"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"ern in the Yar-lung valley,\" and also, \"mKhar-chen dpal-gyi dbang­phyug showed the signs of success when confronted by a blue wolf of the mountains.\" [1031] Even though such statements as, \"the teacher of 'Chims gained some impure signs as symbols of success by exorcising the troublesome demons of Yar-Iung into a mountain torrent,\" have been seen in writing, with regard to the attainment of success in a small precipitous cavern in the Yar-lung valley, there is a story found in the 'Bum nag conunentary concerning gNyags Jiliinakumara who thrust his klla into the Brahmaputra River at Ya-gtsang,83 but no tale is told of the teacher of 'Chims thrusting his klla into any river at all and it is there­fore necessary to understand this event as above. Having completed the invocation of the vidyadhara in this manner, one may take a break between meditation sessions in order to engage in the routine activities of the day. At that time, one should tum one's attention towards the material ma1!4ala of signs and say, \"While I take a break just now, will all you deities of the ma1!tfa1a please carryon with the mantra recitation.\" Having uttered that request, one imagines that all the statues of wood or metal recite the mantra repeatedly and then [when one returns to one's seat] one should dedicate the merit of that and make prayers of aspiration. In that manner, one should engage oneself in a regular sequence of four meditation sessions per day. [692] [137] On some suitable occasion, during the evening session, one should exorcise the nyulle demons (random negative forces). For this, one requires the smoke of cystal myrrh, a human skin, iron [filings], rice, the penis of a donkey,84 a hammer with the head of an owl, and enchanted mustard-seed. Whilst attacking [the demons] with these things, [1032] one should invoke the goddess Kun-thub rgyal-mo, as in the gSimg rdzogs rite:85 83 A Bait of Lightning From the Blue, p.126 84 bong mje. An erect penis is said to tum away all evil omens (ltas ngan bzlog). Secret Visions plate 51 85 bKa' brgyad gsang ba yongs rdzogs, a revelation of Guru chos-dbang.

During the evening session or the nighttime session, the elaborate rite for the fulfilment of the treasure protectors should be performed. With regard to making offerings to the Kila protectors, [1034] these should either be presented in accordance with the rite composed by the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"great omniscient lord of the jina (Dalai Lama V), or else [694] in accor­dance with this new arrangement, whichever one thinks is suitable. In either case, even though our own tradition does not require that an independent offering be dedicated to the oath-bound brother and sis­ter Kila protectors, the Sa-skya school do have a mode of worship for the couple dKar-mo nyi-zla and bDud-rgyal thod-phreng and, actually, this is not out of harmony with the ancient root texts of the bka' rna tra­dition where dKar-mo nyi-zla is [139] listed in the bKa' -brgyad section among the twelve leading ladies (rje rno) in the rnm:ufala of rBod-gtong ma-m086 with the name Nyi-zla thod-phreng-ma. In the part that deals with turning away evil (bzlog pa) we read, \"The unique mother with a garland of 1,000 suns and moons,\" and so on. This passage has been commented upon by O-rgyan rDo-rje-' chang (Padmasambhava) who says that 'white' refers to her colour and that 'suns and moons' means that she has a headdress or turban of wisdom and compassion. Because of all that has been said here, we can have no doubt about dKar-mo nyi-zla. With regard to bDud-rgyal thod-phreng, he is one of the upper bdud (ya bdud), renowned as having a garland of skulls (thod phreng). This couple, known as 'brother and sister,' are explained by gNubs Sangs-rgyas ye-shes as belonging to the inner group of eight when the eight spirits (lha srin sde brgyad) are analysed in terms of outer, inner and secret groups of eight, as he wrote in his text sDe brgyad cha snyerns. Thus we can see that it is good to offer prayers to this couple. [1035] Despite all of this, however, it is not the case that dKar-mo nyi-zla and bDud-rgyal thod-phreng are like the chief of the rnaJ;ltfala with all the other Kila protectors as their A: retinue/B: servants. The most important Kila protectors are the twelve oath-bound goddesses in three groups of four, whose natural leadership and majesty ought to be understood. When offering the bali cakes, the cake for dKar-mo nyi-zla is round and white, decorated with suns and moons, [695] and the cake for bDud-rgyal thod-phreng is triangular and black. For the 12 mother goddesses and their brothers of Rosewood, Iron and Conch, a set of 24 red triangular cakes should be presented, and it is most suitable to set them out in a circular formation because this arrangement is particu­larly pleasing, but it is also acceptable to set them out side by side [in straight lines].

You must fulfil your entrusted activities! With regard to this text, having received the permission (rjes gnang) of dKar-mo nyi-zla and bDud-rgyal thod-phreng, I composed it as an abridged version of a sadhana text which I had seen. As for all the other protectors of the Kila maJ:ufala, because they are clearly described in the Kila sadhana as they take their places in the outer and inner courtyards of the malJtf.ala, I will not write down their visualisation here. And also, in the daily practice one should meditate upon these protectors at the time of the deity generation (above, p.82Jf), just as they are described here. [698] [1039] Now for the celebration of the galJacakra: It is proper to make offerings to the whole assembly during each of the six sessions whilst secluded in retreat, focussed on gaining the attainments. As it is writ­ten: \"Arrange the great circle of the assembly in the six watches.\" If one is engaged in an elaborate retreat it may be done like that. Other­wise, it should be done at the end of an evening session or a nighttime session of meditation. Gathering together the vital ingredients of meat and alcohol and whatever other articles of food and drink one wishes, these should be set out on a carpet of human skin or wild animal hide. They are then 'moistened with nectar' by [143] sprinkling them with holy water. Springing forth from the rays of light in one's heart, the syllables RAM YAM KHAM transform into fire, air and water, by means of which the ideas that cling to a belief in the reality of the material offerings are burned away, dispersed and washed clean. Contemplating the utter purity of their primordial nature (dharmata), one should recite the SVA­BHAVA mantra and RAM YAM KHAM. Then one should imagine a fire fanned by wind within a hearth made up of three human heads. Above the fire, resting upon the hearth­stones, is a gigantic skull cup with a huge capacity that arises from the transformation of a syllable A. Within this cup are all the ingredients for the assembled offerings in their naturally pure state as the five meats and the five wisdom nectars. Because all ordinary conceptions of the offerings have been burned away, this undefiled nectar may be blessed as an inexhaustibly multiplying cloud mass of all that could be desired by the five senses by three recitations of the syllables OM AI:J HUM. [1040] Next is the invitation of the assembly-field: The main bali cake of the attainments (sgrub gtor) should be clearly visualised as 215"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"216 Vajrakila and, visualising once again the triple ma1Jtjala of jnanasattva in the sky, they should be summoned as guests to the feast and invited to dwell within the bali cake. As the gods are being absorbed into the cake, the liturgy is to be chanted, beginning \"HOM In order to accom­plish the cosmic klla and ... \" and so on, down to the mantra. Then [699] one should imagine that a multitude of offering god­desses worship all those who have been invited in that manner, by serv­ing them with a mass of gifts that give pleasure to the five senses. This visualisation is accompanied by the mantra VAJRAARGHAM, and so on, and the verse beginning, \"These unsurpassed supreme offerings, pre­pared with pure ingredients\" and so on. Thus one presents the general offerings. As for the particular offering, the large ritual offering cake is to be presented in a three-fold manner. From among those pieces to be pre­sented at the beginning, the middle and the end, this is the first offer­ing: The ritual assistant, having set out the offerings, should moisten the upper round portion of the offering cake by sprinkling it with nec­tar and blood, as the assembly chant the verse, \"HOM All you deities of the ma1Jtjala ... \" and so on, down to the mantra. [144] This is the middle offering of confession: [As the central portion of the ritual cake is presented, the assembly should] recite the verses taken from the main text, beginning, \"In our ignorance we have transgressed our vows by wicked behaviour of body, speech and mind ... \" and add any other words of confession one wishes. At the end of the verses, recite the 100-syllable mantra of confession modified to include the name of Sri Vajrakumara. As for the final offering, the full and elaborate manner of perform­ing this rite is explained below, [1041] in association with attacking the effigy by striking it with a klla. Generally at this time we use an effigy prepared of tsampa dough, pressed down beneath the lower portion of the offering cake, and this is placed in front of the ritual master, together with a few pieces of meat. It is then moistened with blood and the enemy is dragged forth and forced to abide within the effigy, all in accordance with customary practice. After that, the Supreme Son is invited and, rolling the klla between the palms of the hands with three melodious recitations of the Kila mantra, it is embedded into the effigy with the fierce DHADHI mantra whilst one visualises in the man­ner taught in the oral commentaries. The slain corpse of the effigy is then sprinkled with nectar and pressed to the mouths of the deities, in the manner of an offering cake. Thus, the offering is presented with"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"the words, \"HUM Mahasri [700] Vajrakumara and all your retinue, open your mouths ... \" and so on, down to the mantra. At this point, one should perform the ceremonial restoration of har­mony with the three roots. Also the regular restoration of the covenant with the doctrine protectors, offerings and praise to the triple mafl4ala, prayers for the forgiveness of sins, and, after the final prayers and mantra recitation directed to the material mafltjala (i.e. after the mate­rial mafl4ala has been dissolved), one should dedicate the merit, make prayers of aspiration, and recite auspicious verses before embarking on the path of the activities. Staying in retreat in this manner for a suit­able period and engaging in four sesions of meditation per day, suc­cess will be achieved. That ends the section concerning the main practice of sevasadhana. SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITIES OF FINAL RESORT (anvayavidhi) The third general topic is an explanation concerning the series of steps of the vast [1042] subsequent activities of final resort. This has four parts: [145] (1) The act of implantation by the kila, (2) the three rites of pressing down, burning and hurling, (3) taking siddhi, and (4) the sequence of the follow-up rites.89 (1) Firstly, concerning the act of destroying the enemy by strik­ing his effigy with a kila, there is a saying, \"In general, if the Kila is to be achieved, one must perform the rite of implantation,\" and this shows that the rite of implantation is of very great importance. In this regard, when the rite is to be performed in the manner of the sevasadhana practices, according to the oral instructions of the guru there are six aspects to the preparation of the effigy and it is necessary to do these in the manner taught in the supplementary texts in order that the effigy-wheel be understood without error.90 On this occasion it is appropriate to follow the system set out by [bsTan-'dzin nor-bul, the rig-'dzin of Yo l-mo, in his sGroi byed drag po'i sno mtshon (Sharp Weapon of Ferocious Slaying), arranged in accordance with the ritual texts for the empowerment of Che-mchog heruka. [He says:] /I Although it is the 89 All three mss add: \"these are the five.\" 90 A Bolt of Lightning from the Blue, p.223ff 217"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"218 case that an effigy-wheel on paper and so on are required in the main part of the rite, [701] even so, the rite at this juncture depends upon the power of a simple effigy made of flour dough. Visualising the enemy to be destroyed clearly in one's mind, the six impurities and so on should be added to a base of flour and mixed up to form a dough from which an effigy, 12 digits long, should be prepared. Smear the effigy with blood and gather together a speedily moving kila, a kila of implan­tation, and a supreme kila (the Supreme Son Kila), and some white and black mustard seeds, some powdered iron and copper, some human ashes, some water cress, [1043] the poisonous effigy, a mixture of poi­son and blood, a curved flaying knife or a murderer's sword, a hammer and one of the sacrificial ladles for a fire ceremony, or else a pointed shoulder blade and the rounded cavity of a hip bone, to be used as a mortar and pestle. Then, having performed the practice in the ordi­nary manner for a period of seven days, during the nighttime session on the last day, one should perform this elaborate ritual of the final offering.\" Thus, having completed the sadhana practice up as far as the end of the middle section of the offerings, one should set out a golden libation and [146] summon the triple ma1J�ala, beginning with the invo­cation of the vidyadhara. Because there exist manuscripts in which the lineages have become confused and adulterated, for the sake of purity I will write down here the correct text in full:91 HUM By arousing the mind of supreme awakening you have become heirs to the conquerors of the past, present and future.

Reciting these words with ferocious power, stab the effigy. Now, with regard to the visualisation to be held in mind according to the precepts on longevity and the precepts on ablution and so on, I have written about these in my text on ritual empowerment called Rin chen bum bzang.105 This is the special activity to be perfomed here: At the time of recitation of the fierce kllamantra, at the moment when the actual rite of slaughter is to be performed, using a material kUa of any descrip­tion, [711] the effigy should be pierced by the kila entering the crown of its head until it emerges from the sales of its feet. When it is drawn out once more from the crown of the head, the body is liberated. Then the effigy should be pierced by the kila entering the top of the tongue until it emerges into the voicebox. When it is drawn out once more from the top of the tongue, the speech is liberated. Then the effigy should be pierced by the kila entering the heart until it emerges into the open cav­ity of the life force. And the kila should be rolled. When it is drawn out once more from the heart, the habitual stains of the mind are liberated. As it has been made clear by [bsTan-'dzin nor-bu], the rig-'dzin of Yol­rna, \"Then, by entering the body through the head [and so on], all fac­ulties of the enemy without exception are removed. Thus, as the effigy is broken up, so the enemy is completely liberated.\" [1056] That is the way he explained it in his textbook on ritual service. After that, the broken pieces of the effigy should be moistened with nectar and the liberated corpse pressed to the mouths of the gods as the final part of the assembled offerings. [156] Those are the stages for the rite of implanting the kila. (2) The three rites of pressing down, burning and hurling. When these rites are to be performed in an elaborate manner, they should be done in accordance with the teachings derived from the supplemen-105 B5.

Firstly, the offering articles are set out. These include nectar, blood and bali cake, as well as some special choice morsels for the glorious lord and also, when the rite is to be an elaborate one, the series of five general offerings (upahara). Then there is the special burning substance consist­ing of melted butter mixed with poison, blood and white mustard seeds. An effigy should be drawn on paper, 12 digits in length, with the arms and legs spread out as if it were in the act of leaping through the air. [712] On the belly, with the heads of the letters facing outwards, should be written the name [of the victim] together with words of summoning. Around the outside [of the figure], with the heads of the letters facing inwards, should be written curses, and it should be surrounded by JAJ:I crosses. When the effigy is that of a demon only (i.e. it does not repre­sent a personal enemy), there is no need to inscribe its name. Little balls of dough should be made, representing the outer elements of wood, fire, wind, earth and water, [1057] and these should be smeared with a mix­ture of poison and blood. The effigy that was used in the former rite and that has already been through the processes of summoning the victim, forcing him to abide within the effigy, and slaying with the ritual klla, should be placed to the right-hand side and, in front, a stack of fierce (i.e. hard, thorny) firewood should be set up in the triangular arrangement of a wrathful fire pit and contained within an iron cooking pot. Now one blesses the three vital ingredients of nectar, blood and bali cake with the words, \"HUM The sacred sa maya articles of wisdom devoid of all mental propositions, ... \" and so on, together with the mantra.107 If the ordinary offering articles (upahara) are to be offered at this time, these should also be blessed in accordance with the ritual text, but it doesn't matter if these articles are not actually present. [157] Then fire should be brought forth from the house of a widow to kindle the ritual fire, and the flames should be cleansed with the mantra of Am�takm:t9-alin, purified with the SVABHAvA mantra, and blessed with three repetitions of the mantra of Vajrakila, as the new fire blazes up. Then, contemplating that purified fire pit, one should recite: 106 mNan bsreg 'phang gsum (A13, B20, ell).

As for the rite of hurling: As above, one should set out bali cakes as offerings, red in colour and triangular in shape. Eleven of these are dedicated to the lord and his retinue - one for the lord and one each for the ten wrathful kings. Another twelve are dedicated to the oath­bound guardians and these are to be shared by the brothers and sis­ters. These bali cakes are also red in colour and triangular in shape, and all of them should be adorned with blood and mustard seeds. They may be arranged along any side of the ma1!4ala that one finds con­venient. At the time of commanding siddhi (Le. dispatching the pro­tectors to accomplish their tasks), with oneself clearly visualised as the lord, one should perform the acts of inviting them, requesting them to sit firmly, praising them and reciting their mantra and so on, all at once.

Nevertheless, in order not to leave this topic empty, we utilize the dance stomp.

Although the Northern Treasures cycle of Vajrakila practice contains no extensive explanation of the ritual of tak­ing siddhi, [718] that rite has been illustrated in full detail in the excel­lent teachings of the supreme victor [Dalai Lama V] in his text dNgos grub rgya rntsho'i rol gar, derived from the bKa' brgyad bde gshegs 'dus pa cycle [of Nyang-ral nyi-ma 'od-zer].

Acting on the basis of what is said here, in keeping with this idea I will elucidate [the topic of siddhi] by looking at relevant passages in the Phur pa spu gri texts of Guru chos-dbang. The first thing to be done in this regard is to assemble the material requisites: Into the hollow space between either a pair of cranial cav­ities, joined together face to face, or a skull and some suitable precious vessel, [1065] insert a [gtor rna cake] made of a mixture of roasted flour and butter containing some Dharma medicine (chos srnan) and the three sweets (honey, sugar and mollasses) together with other sacred sub-261"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"262 stances. It should have the form of a blazing jewel and be surrounded by the symbolic shapes of the four enlightened activities (i.e. a circle, square, semicircle and triangle) [163] and a second outer ring of longevity pills. Also, one should set out various items of food and drink, as well as a skull cup filled with nectar into which some Dharma medicine has been added. Having gathered these items together, dur­ing the morning session on the final day of the retreat, one should read straight through the ritual text from the beginning, up as far as the mantra recitation section. At this point the mantra should be recited as many times as necessary, together with the spreading out and gather­ing in of light rays which constitute the four branches of ritual service and attainment (sevasadhana). Thus, following the text of the Thugs kyi 'phrin las, one should recite: HUM With myself clearly visualised as Vajrakumara ... and so on.116 The interfering demons should be expelled from the pow­erful substances of siddhi and, in order to make a full confession of errors, mistakes, downfalls [719] and sins, one should confess as the supreme wisdom body.ll7 Abiding in meditation upon oneself as the yuganaddha couple in the centre of the fundamental [dharmakaya] ma1J�ala <?f the natural condition, one should contemplate one's vajra marked with a white OM and the lotus of the consort marked with a red A. Then, the father-mother heruka buddhas of the five families abiding in the skull of the consort join together in a sexual embrace, and a stream of the white and red bodhicitta of their union flows down through her central channel [1066] to the place of her secret sky. There, the red and white fluids mingle together and produce OM AJ-:f HUM, the heart mantra of real attainment, the very essence of siddhi. As they enter through the hole of one's secret vajra, they are absorbed into the radi­ant life-force syllable HUM so that one's wisdom of blissful emptiness is caused to spread and increase. Simultaneously, all the deities of the [sambhogakaya] ma1J�ala of wrathful kings in the ten directions and the [nirma1Jakaya] ma1J�ala of material klIa of characteristics also join together in a sexual embrace and the bodhicitta arising from the place of union of all three malJ-cfala, which is the true essence of the nectar, is absorbed into the material substances of the attainments.

All the bali cakes for the Dharma-protectors should be kept on lower levels [than offerings for the superior deities] or moved around.

After that, either arranging an entirely new set of offerings for the deities of the ma1J-4ala, or else refreshing those already on the altar, one sprinkles a little nectar and blood onto the bali cake of the attainments and goes through the final sections of the ritual such as presenting the offerings, praising the deities, requesting their forbearance, and the hundred-syllable supplement that makes good any deficiencies or extraneous elements in the ritual.

From among them, with regard to the King Sri, one should insert these into the skull of a Mongolian woman (hor mo) of any type, or the skull of a Tibetan of evil lineage (bod rigs ngan),4 and they should be pressed down within the centre of a religious assembly, or beneath a temple or shrine.

Proceeding carefully through the six rites, without error, the offi­ciant separates the enemy from his protector gods, casts him down into form and forces him to abide within the effigy, deprives him of his senses, reprimands him for his bad behaviour, and curses him by bom­barding him with the noxious items of sorcery. All of this is to be achieved in a state of deep samadhi. The sixth act is to take those effi­gies and skulls and bury them within a triangular pit. Now a golden libation should be dispensed (for the gods) and they should be asked to witness the accomplishment. With regard to the summoning of the demons, this is explained in the tantra as follows: HDM You vow-breaking Sri of evil deeds, You harmful Sri who commit evil actions, As a consequence of your deeds in previous lifetimes, In this present life you have been born as Sri And we yogins [320] have arisen as your destined enemies.

As for the subjugation of the thirteen minor Sri, a rite belonging to the cycle of skilful deeds of Vajrakila, it serves as a method of turning away all evil omens. In the beginning, at a time when the world was coming into existence due to the general karmic propensitities of sentient beings [who were destined to become its inhabitants], from the centre of the cosmic mountain sprang forth the tree of paradise (yongs 'du sa brtoI, parijataka ), and beneath its roots dwelled the ya bdud Garlanded with Skulls and the ma bdud Mistress of Lotus Dance.

And, as for the site of their suppression, they should be pressed down either within the centre of a great religious assembly, or in an important temple. For those Despoiling Sri of Min­isters, one should take the skull of a young monkey, a parrot or a hare, and they should be pressed down in the assembly hall where [minis­ters] gather together as one.

With regard to that, here in our Byang-gter school, among the rites of Vajrakila we have the root text called Sri chung bcu gsum mnan pa (Press­ing Down the Thirteen Minor Demons).2 Taking this as the basis, and referring also to the mNan pa'i gzer kha, derived from the section on skulls in the bKa' brgyad rang shar (tantra), and the account of the line­age of Sri demons by Wang-the, the emanational emperor, taken from the Chinese tantra of geomantic calculations called The Gathering of all Precious Elements ('Byung ba rin chen kun 'dusP [567], and so on, I have composed this ritual text based on all these sources, in combination with the oral instructions [of my guru, Dalai Lama V]. So then, in ancient days, at the time of creation, from the centre of the cosmic mountain sprang forth the tree [233] [897] of paradise and beneath its roots dwelled the ya bdud Garlanded with Skulls and the ma bdud Mistress of Lotus Dance. From the union of these two, the thir­teen minor demons were born as sons.4 That is the explanation derived Byang gter chos spyod 3.10 [231-270], A51 [565-616], & D58 [895-940] 2 See previous chapter. 3 According to legend, the bodhisattva Maftjusri taught five primary tantras of divination, among which, the 'Byung ba rin chen kun 'dus is classified as sa'i rgyud (the tantra of earth).

The description of the family of Sri as found in the Northern Treasures bKa'-brgyad texts, tells us that the country of Sri demons (sri yul) consists of nine islands and that the castle of the Sri is built up of nine skulls.5 Within that castle lives the grandfather of the demons, [568] Sky Sri, together with Earth Sri. From these two came the father, Black Bird of Sky, and the mother, Mouse of Earth, from whose union were produced thirteen eggs and, bursting out from these, the thirteen minor demons came into being. Now we need to know the ritual system of pressing down, devel­oped following the method described in the history books which tell how Guru Padma controlled these demons by pressing them down in the past. In this ritual system there are three parts: (1) preparation, [234] (2) main practice, and (3) subsequent activities. (1) The first of these, the preparation, should be done as described in the appendix, where the manner of setting out the necessary articles will be explained.6 (2) Secondly, as for the sequence of rites for the main practice, it is writ­ten in the root text: \"Then the ma1Jt;iala of Vajrakila [898] should be drawn in conformity with established tradition.

According to some of the Kila com­mentaries, binding the effigy of the enemy with a cord, it should be entrusted to the hand of Tr ailokyavijaya. Whether it is done like that or not, the manner in which the basic preparations [569] are to be made, as taught in our received tradition of the ritual activities, as well as in the authoritative texts of Vajrakila and so on, is clearly described in the appendix.

As well as that brood of eleven Sri are their parents, the couple known as Ya-bdud and Ma-bdud, and thus it is explained that the Sri are thirteen in number. At this point, the above text lists the skulls for their suppression: The Despoiling Sri of Kings should be pressed down, either within the centre of a religious assembly or beneath a temple, in one of three skulls: that of a southerner (man), a Mongolian (hor), or a Tibetan (bod). [619] The Despoiling Sri of Ministers should be pressed down in front,3 within the skull of a young monkey, a parrot or a hare.

Even though Door Sri are described as Sri afflicting fathers and pater­nal uncles, the skulls and places of their suppression are not explained. The Sri of ill-omened widowhood and mourning for mothers and chil­dren should be pressed down within the skull of a dog, pig or camel, beneath the threshold. Sri of Children should be pressed down beneath the road within the skull of a puppy, a piglet, a kitten or a weasel.

Sri of Anger should be pressed down within the skull of wild dog, in a place devoid of sunlight, and that is the way in which those thirteen are taught.

[945] Outside of that, upon the eight spokes of a wheel, the eight syllables STAM BHA YA MA RA YA NAN NAN should be written, with the heads of the letters to the outside, and, on the eight spaces between the spokes, the letter YA should be written eight times, with the head of the letters turned inward. Around the circumference, with the heads of the letters to the outside, should be written the mantra and curses against the Sri. Finally, a number of JAJ:! crosses and so on should be inscribed around the outside. That is the general custom. Here, in our tradition of the Northern Treasures Vajrakila, however, we say that this method of drawing the effigy wheel is faulty. If the image is to be constructed in accordance with the oral instructions con­cerning the drawing and its inscriptions, this is the method which must be followed in order that it tum out well, derived from the Byang gter phur pa drag sngags: \"With regard to the mistakes made in drawing the effigy wheel, one should construct a circle with six spokes [621] and three rims. At the hub, one should inscribe the name and lineage [of the victim] . Around the outside of this, upon the series of six spokes, one should draw the body in its entirety. The head is to be drawn upon the eastern spoke, the left arm is to be drawn upon the southeastern spoke, the left leg is to be drawn upon the southwestern spoke, the genitals are to be drawn upon the western spoke, the right leg is to be drawn upon the northwestern spoke, and the right arm is to be drawn upon the northeastern spoke. Draw each part carefully, placing it within its proper section. Now inscribe the mantra in its entirety upon all five limbs of the body, and the specific designation (bla dvags, adhivacana) upon the genitals. [468] Within the outermost rim of the wheel, write the syllable JAJ:! twenty-one times.\" Thus, the drawing should be con­structed in the manner described here. It may be added that, if one requires to supress all the thirteen types of minor Sri [946] simultaneously, it is not necessary to change the head on that drawing of the effigy upon a six-spoked wheeL Having 365"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"366 drawn it with just a human head, it can be used without making vari­ations.

Because they have great ability in Dharma (chos rgyus ehe ba), however, it is not possible to overwhelm them with the splendour of meditation upon the genera­tion stage of the maJJ�ala of deities, and they can only be subdued by means of blessings imbued with samadhi. With regard to that, more­over, it is explained that [those demons] must be subdued by a yogin who possesses an understanding of skilful methods, is full of the urgent zeal of compassion, and has mastered the oral precepts.\" So, as it is written here, such a person as this who is fully intent on subduing the dam sri demons will achieve his goal [having drawn the effigy] with a human body [622] and the head of a bird. That is the way in which it is taught in all the received teachings. If one wishes to know the special characteristics of the thirteen indi­vidual types of Sri, according to the oral instructions of Zur-chen chos­dbyings rang-grol and the Great Fifth Dalai Lama (\"the all-knowing conquering lord\"): Father Sri [take the form of] a white yak (or a black??

Their faces are unpleasant and, from their mouths, they spit sparks of red-hot iron. They are dark blue in colour, or like black hunting dogs. The Sri of the Tombs may have the face of a fox, or even the form of a vixen. Despoiling Sri may have the face of a camel with the eyes of a crane and, with their thin throats, they utter many urgent calls. They are the reddish-brown colour of camels.

According to the Northern Treasures tradition concerning the ances­tral genealogy of the Sri: Father Sri have human form with the head of a wolf, and Mother Sri [623] have human form with the head of a camel. The Sri of Children have weasel heads. bDud Sri have the head of an eagle. bTsan Sri have the head of an owl. King Sri have the head of a cockrel.

Sri that occasionally travel to a birth (skyes pa'i byes sri) have the head of a horse, and the Sri of Loss have the head of a goat. Thus, because it is taught [470] in all these many sources that the thirteen Sri have different kinds of heads, whichever kind of Sri is to be supressed, the drawing of the head may be changed to suit the partic­ular case. But, whichever of those is chosen, however, this is the method for arranging the mantra on the limbs, taken from our own tradition of the Northern Treasures Vajrakila: \"Having drawn the effigy of the enemies and obstructors, arrange it upon a wheel and inscribe OM VAJRAKlLI KILAYA straighten out the heart blood JVALA CITIAAPARACITTA, which are the 19 seed-syllables of the Mother Goddesses and butchers, upon the head of the effigy.

Finally, within the outermost rim should be inscribed the spells and curses against the Sri, and then the JAJ:I crosses and so on, all arranged as seen on the example diagram in the notes. 10 If one wishes to create the effigy in an elaborate fashion, a down­pour of goodness arises if it is drawn in accordance with the tradition of the 'Byung ba rin chen kun 'dus.11 If one wishes to create it in an extremely brief fashion, however, the extra words of summoning, constituting the mantra which draw forth the soul (bla 'gugs), should be inscribed upon the belly/navel of the effigy alone, without the six-spoked wheel. The mantra should be written on each of its limbs, as explained above, and around the outside should be inscribed the spells and curses of the Sri, and the JAJ:I crosses. That is the arrangement to be followed by a yogin who has had much practical experience of the technique. As for the preparatory arrangements, it is best if these are made in accordance with the commentaries describing the layout of the ma1J4ala for the attainment of Vajrakila. If that is not to be the case, one may rely upon an image of the deity in klla form (bsnyen phur), together with the three samaya offerings of nectar medicine, bali cake and blood, and so on, and in front of these one should place the triangular pit and all the appropriate articles. [950] With regard to these, [625] according to the explanatory diagram in the 'Byung ba rin chen kun 'dus, the trian­gular pit itself is three levels deep, arranged with its apex on the far side, and the effigy is placed within this. All around the outside of the pit is a wall of fire ('fire mountain') with the tips of the flames pointing inwards. Outside of that, on the front side are placed a bow and arrow, to the right is a spear, and to the left is a hammer. All of these items are arranged, lying down, in a clockwise circle. Around the outside of those, are placed various sharp weapons, such as klla and so on. And, 10 Neither the notes nor diagram are still extant. 11 Our author has just told us, however, that the 'Byung ba rin chen kun 'dus omits any detailed discussion of the effigy wheel."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"finally, all of this is enclosed within a ring of thorns.

At the back, either neatly arranged or casually piled up, should be placed black­ened pieces of half-burned wood and so on. This is the way in which it may be done on those occasions when one wishes to perform the rite in an elaborate manner. If the rite is to be performed in simple fashion, it may be done just upon the ground or upon a woollen blanket of black goat's hair or upon the full hide of a goat, and so forth, according to what is available. And, on top of this, one may use a triangular iron box (,brub khung) or else three stones from the charnel ground with a box or iron cooking pot on top, and the effigy wheel should be placed within that. Then the effigy should be covered over with a lid. Around the outside of that tri­angular prison or cooking pot or whatever one is using, set up a bound­ary across the pathways of the srin mo, made of the three kinds of thorn - rose, tamarisk and barberry - as many as can be counted, with their spikes reversed. And the suppression skulls should be displayed in the vicinity of these things./I Regarding these, it is said in the Sri chung bcu gsum mnan pa, the authoritative root text from the treasure tradi­tion, [951] \"And now this is the heart mantra of all the Sri, and it should be recited whilst one inscribes it on the skull: OM SARVA JATRINI HOM JAI:!. NATRI SUTRI NITRI HOM JAl:l. [626] SANTRINI HOM JAl:l. KATRINI DANTRINI. GUM GUM JAl:l JAl:l JAl:l HOM. As the recitations are counted, so it should be written down. It should be inscribed from the very top of the head on whatever skull has been selected from those listed above, all the way down to the forehead. [Then, the skull] should be bound up with green and red [threads], or enclosed in black. It should be fumigated with noxious substances, wrapped up in black goat's wool cloth, inserted into a black sack, securely bound with leather straps and placed in a bolster./I So this mantra, as given in the above citation, is to be inscribed upon the forehead of the skull so as to inflict [the first of] the knots that bind. Now, although such things as the black sack and the leather straps and so on are not strictly necessary, [473] it is obviously imperative, what­ever kind of suppression skull one is using, that it be bound with green and red threads and placed into a triangular pit. And one may write \"Press down upon the Sri of the elderly!\" (rgan sri nan) on the forehead 369"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"370 of the skull if the Sri to be supressed has been afflicting an elderly per­son, or, \"Press down upon the Sri of youth!\" (gzhon sri nan) if the Sri to be supressed has been afflicting the young. On the right cheek may be written \"Suppress the Father Sri!\" (pho sri nan), or, on the left cheek may be written \"Suppress the Mother Sri!\" (rno sri nan), if one wishes to sub­due a Sri that has been afflicting males or females, respectively. These are the oral teachings of my guru. Of all the things to be arranged, foremost among them are the cru­cial three skulls of a goat, dog and pig. For this is the ritual technique of 'Suppression by Skull' and, when one investigates its many divi­sions, [952] these three suppression skulls are required at every stage. Thus we can see that they are the necessary containers for this rite, just as a teacup is required when drinking tea. The dough out of which one makes the round offering cakes and the small flattened discs ('brang rgyas rntheb SkyU)12 for the Sri should be a mixture of three ingredients - flour, beer dregs and ashes. They have a circular belly shape at the bottom, and each one is adorned with a ball (sgor) at the tip. Alternatively, because their shape is not specified in our tradition, [627] that basic Sri dough can be used to produce the squeezed finger lengths called I changs bu. The meat for the Sri is goat's flesh, such as the forepaw. Beer for the Sri is either sour beer, or what­ever beer is already available. In our tradition, 'pale ash porrige' (thal skyo) is to be stirred with the milk of a cow, goat and horse (ba ra rta). The parched grain for the Sri is grain which has been burned black. Having set out the display of all these offerings, they should be replen­ished and made good at each meditation session. At the time of drag­ging them forth and causing them to remain trapped within the effigy, one should use either discarded goat flesh or goat fat, in conjunction with human marrow and horse marrow, and these three ingredients are burned together to produce smoke. All of these things should be prepared in advance and, according to the special teachings of the Phur pa'i sri chung, the substance which is used for fumigating all of them [474] is crystal myrrh (guggula). The most potent of ritual commodities are beer, polluted with var­ious poisons and blood, metallic dust derived from the sharpening of such things as swords and battle axes, a red triangular bali cake smeared with a mixture of blood and poison, iron filings, copper fil­ings, bell metal filings, mustard plants, and yellow mineral earth. 12 13.45 adds \"or lotus.\""},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Other items include broken pieces of stone from a mountain avalanche, dust from the navel of a millstone, salt, capsicum pepper, [953] and white and black mustard seeds. These dry items of sorcery should be mixed together and piled up in a heap. They should then be covered over with a cloth of black yak wool or some such, and set out in line [with all the other prepared ingredients]. Items required at the time of pressing down are: blackened pieces of burnt wood, salt, borax, soda, an upper millstone inscribed with Mount Meru and the four major and [eight] minor continents, a tombstone inscribed with a visvavajra, some cloth of black goat's wool or the lower garment of a widow or widower, thread of five [628] different colours, five varieties of herbal medicine, various coloured silks,13 five varieties of precious jewel, earth from the foundation of an ancient stupa, a shaved goat skin, the kinds of items that overthrow the mi kha,14 fire, water, and earth of five colours. All of these should be gathered together and kept separate, unmixed. When the Sri are to be dragged forth and imprisoned within the effigy, my guru has taught that the vital points of the visualisation are to imagine a countless host of divine messengers emanating and fur­ther emanating from within the triple ma1:z�ala and radiating outwards. These messengers capture the Enemy Sri in the form of grey wolves and the Father Sri in the form of white yaks and so on, as explained above, and drag them forth, [475] bind them securely, and deprive them of their senses. All of this is to be visualised in the usual manner. With regard to the visualisation at the time of mantra recitation, my guru has taught that innumerable emanations of the wrathful king Takkiraja radiate out from the triple ma1:z�ala in countless forms, hold­ing an iron hook, a noose, iron fetters and a bell in his hands. Also, for ourselves and our sponsors, [954] all those greater and lesser actions which we have committed from former times up until the present, which have given rise to circumstances of misfortune and calamity, are now manifest in the form of Sri demons, chief among whom are the thirteen classes of Sri, and including the inconceivable number of lesser Sri that are to be found from the summit of existence all the way down to AVici (the deepest of hells), and all of these, wherever they may be found, have their hearts caught by his iron hook. They are bound at the 13 From the context, I would suppose that five different colours of silk are required. 14 Spirits of backbiting and jealousy. See Introduction. 371"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"372 waist by his noose. Their limbs are shackled by his iron fetters. They are deprived of their senses by the ringing of his bell, and, as they are attacked by all manner of sharp weapons, they are dragged forth and caused to merge with the effigy. All of this is to be clearly visualised again and again, until it is known to have truly taken place. [629] Then the effigy should be wrapped around with coloured threads, just as one would wind up a ball of wool, and one should imagine that their body, speech and mind are pressed down beneath the enormous weight of a visvavajra so that they are completely unable to move. And the rays of light that spread out from the wrathful mantra are tongues of fire with sharp-pointed weapons at their tips which hack off the major limbs of the body and burn them up, moving in from the outside so that the consciousness is forced to abide within the region of the effigy's heart - human enemies in the form of the syllable NB-, and demonic obstruc­tors in the form of the syllable TRI. Then it flares up briefly, KEM KEM, [476] like the flame of a butterlamp on the point of extinction, and is gone. Such are taught to be the most important vital points of the visu­alisation and, as one meditates in this way, one should blow with one's breath upon the mound of powerful ingredients of sorcery. When the rite of striking with those magical items is done, the effigy is prepared for burial suppression by [955] daubing it with spots of poi­son blood, beginning at the head and then rolling it over and painting first the right side and then the left. The customary manner of performing the rite of pressing down, according to the received tradition of the mDo dgongs pa 'dus pa,15 is summarised in the 'Khor 10 nag po.16 More elaborate details may be learned elsewhere. With regard to the coloured threads, empowering them with mantra in accordance with the guru's instructionsp we should know that [the demon] is to be bound up with these threads in a criss-cross pattern (in imitation of a visvavajra), both front and back, as soon as power has been attained over him by the act of striking him [with the noxious items of sorcery]. Then, into whatever kind of skull has been selected, should be poured the pale ash porrige, stirred with the milk of a cow, goat and horse. 15 Regarding this most important of anuyoga texts, see the Introduction. 16 CIO Nag po dug gi 'khor lo'i spu gri, part of the sGrub chen bka' nyan lcags kyi ber ka A11, B19 & C7. 17 These instructions are to be found only in text 13.45. See below, note 20."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"The various herbs, coloured silks, five kinds of precious jewels, any remaining magical ingredients, and earth from the foundation of an ancient stllpa, should all be used to pack the skull full. [630] Then the brain cavity should be sealed shut with a cross, and the whole thing should be wrapped up in black goat's wool or the undergarment of a widow. It should then be secured with coloured threads and bound all around in a shaved goat skin. Mixing white ashes together with the three ingredients of salt, borax and soda, one should seal it with some suitable sign, such as a wrathful face or a visvavajra. When completely sealed, it should be placed within a metal container. This is known by the gurus as \"the empowerment of the skull\" (thad dbang bskur ba), and one should sing, \"Kye, kye! Due to the accumulation of evil deeds in the past,\" [477] and so on.18 [956] As this song is being sung, all the hosts of deities in the triple ma1J.qlala of Vajrakila and all the hosts of deities that pervade the realm of space, both peaceful and wrathful, abiding in their natural dwelling places, emanate rays of black and red light from their bodies and hand symbols which give rise to a blazing inferno of wind and fire. These coagulate and become hard, with the nature of sharp weapons, and are absorbed into the skull so that the skull itself becomes extremely dense and solid, white in colour like a conch shell. Thus, one should imagine that the enemies and obstruc­tors are trapped until the end of time in a prison with not even a crack or fissure through which to escape. As for the three \"skulls of suppression,\" furthermore, when medi­tating upon the skulls of a goat, dog and pig, one should believe those skulls to be terrifyingly dense and solid, possessing a nature that affords no release, even when confronted by the fires and winds at the end of the aeon. And one should believe that they have been taken by the wrathful hosts of Yama [down to the realm of the dead]. Regarding the time of pressing down, furthermore, according to the teachings of other authoritative texts on the subject, the seals of fire, water, coloured earth and so on, should be established whilst reciting: DHU TU RO GHU SAM PA NAN. [631] This mantra for the earth of five colours and the fire and water and so on, is an oral instruction found in the notebooks of my teacher. In brief, because I felt the need to know all the fine details concern­ing the material requisites for this rite, as well as the most important stages of practice, I attended regularly to the words of oral instruction 18 Verses to be sung whilst pressing down. See above, pp.350-353 373"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"374 spoken by my guru. Serving my teacher with faithful devotion [478] without embellishing his teachings in any way, I rejoiced in the essen­tial instructions. [957] In that way I was able to compose this text, pay­ing special attention to the hidden precepts and missing instructions concerning the effigy. If I have done anything wrong, or my mind is misdirected or impure, or if I have tried to steal the oral instructions like an evil thief and flee, may all the great and powerful protectors of the doctrine feast upon the blood of my heart! This text was composed on the basis of the root text for the rite of pressing down upon the thirteen types of Sri, in the Northern Treas­ures Vajrakila cycle, the Sri chung bcu gsum mnan pa. Ta king the teach­ings on skulls from the mNan pa'i gzer kha, derived from the Byang gter bka' brgyad rang shar rgyud, and using the melodious songs of wisdom from those sources, I set out a ritual method in clear liturgical form19 in accordance with the oral instructions of one who has overthrown all trouble-makers, the all-knowing conquering lord, the omniscient fifth Dalai Lama, and the kulapati Zur-chen rdo-rje-' chang, with carefully chosen citations from the 'Byung ba rin chen kun 'dus and so on. This supplementary text, called The Utterly Clear Mirror of Ritual Performance (Lhan thabs rab gsal me long), was requested by my vajra disciple, Zur­chen mchog-sprul Ngag-dbang kun-dga' [632] bsod-nam, and I was also earnestly beseeched, again and again, by bLa-ma mkhyen-rab rnam-rgyal. Thus, I, the bhik$u Bya-bral padma 'phrin-las, composed this text at the age of sixty-one in the monastery of Thub-bstan rdo-rje­brag. It was set down in writing by the bhik$u sMan-mchog. By the virtue of this work, may all sentient beings gain victory in the battle against the four kinds of Mara.
