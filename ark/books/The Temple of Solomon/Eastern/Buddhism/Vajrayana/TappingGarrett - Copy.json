The tantric command to consume humanand animal by-products has been interpreted variously in secondary schol-arship. My intention here is not to find out what the tantras really meanwhen they recommend that a practitioner eat human flesh, for instance, orwhether anyone did in fact do so. Rather, in this article I will think abouthow a constellation of texts circulating at one moment in Tibetan historyshare a common language and about where else we may hear this languageused. Although this is not primarily an article about methods of tantricinterpretation or hermeneutics, I am proposing that we must notice howthe discursive or “grammatical” structures of the tantras extend far beyondthe boundaries of their own pages. Specifically, I will argue that Tibetantantric prescriptions to consume human by-products are in an importantway “medical” in their language and that this is particularly clear if werecognize that in Tibetan (and South Asian) contexts, “medicine” involvesI would like to thank several anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments on draftsof this article.

Meant to be transformedthrough a ritual, yogic, and culinary alchemy into powerful purified sub-stances, the five nectars are identified as human wastes or by-products:human feces, urine, “red bodhicitta” or (menstrual) blood, “white bodhi-citta” or semen, and flesh or marrow (dri chen, dri chu, byang sems dmarpo or rak ta, byang sems dkar po, sha chen or rkang mar). The five nectarsare typically paired with the “five meats” (sha lnga, Skt. pañcamamsa),the flesh of cow, dog, horse, elephant, and human. The prescription ofnectars and meats as imagined or actual food offerings for deities or asempowerment substances in tantric ritual is well known in secondaryscholarship on Tibetan Buddhism, although there is little agreement onhow these substances should in fact be identified.1 Whether or not actualhuman by-products are used at all, however, nectar practices are basic tomany serious followers of Tibetan Buddhism worldwide. A cup filledwith nectar—here referring to a soupy mixture of various ingredientsempowered by ritual “blessings” (byin rlabs)—is an important part of alltantric initiations, as well as the tantric feast offering ritual (tshogs ‘khor).Reference to consumption of the five nectars and five meats is commonin Highest Yoga Tantra (Bla na med pa’i rgyud, Skt. Anuttarayoga tantra)sadhana practices known as the “inner offering” (nang mchod). In oneform of this type of ritual, for example, a “nectar pill” (bdud rtsi ril bu),created from a recipe of ingredients such as the five nectars and meats,may be dissolved in a skull cup filled with tea, alcohol, or urine. Themixture is cooked on a hearth fire, and from the steam of the boiled liquidthe ritual’s central deities are imagined to arise. They engage in a sexualencounter that produces a stream of powerful reproductive substances, orbodhicitta, which falls into the cup, and later the deities themselves alsomelt back into the cup. Consecrating and cooking the mixture thoroughlypurifies the impure substances, and the empowered nectarous soup is thenoffered back to the deities. After an imagined cooking process, the purifiednectar may also be “poured into” the student to confer empowerment.Variations on this sort of ritual are familiar to English-reading audiences,having been described by Beer, in the case of the Cakrasamvara tradition,by English, in the case of the Vajravarahi sadhana practices that are part of1A summary and analysis of academic perspectives on the identification of the nectarsand meats may be found in Christian K.

Although secondary scholarship and publications oriented to prac-titioners have rarely focused on these more practical, or more immediatelybeneficial, uses of “nectar” (bdud rtsi), consecrated nectar is in fact acritical ingredient in recipes found across the spectrum of healing andoccult technologies of religious and medical writing in Tibet. Some ofthese recipes have sources in the Indian Buddhist tantras and some havelinks to Chinese traditions, but Tibetans themselves developed a vast bodyof writing and practice of their own focused on such recipes and theirimplementation.In this essay, I will suggest that the thirteenth-century flourishing ofnectar-oriented writings in both medical and religious circles in Tibetshaped each of these traditions in important ways and that this period con-figured Tibetan nectar practices in ways that are markedly distinct fromtheir manifestations in Indian Tantra. I will begin with discussion of aconstellation of Buddhist texts on Accomplishing Medicine (sman sgrub),a practice at the core of the early Nectar Tantras corpus (Bdud rtsi yontan rgyud), and then consider the thirteenth-century codification of nectarpractice in the Nyingma (Rnying ma) tradition, which occurred simulta-neously with the development of the tradition of the Four Medical Tantras(Rgyud bzhi), which became the dominant medical work of Central Tibetnot long afterward. I will then examine several narrative, ritual, and cul-tural contexts in which we may find the language of consuming humanby-products to be significant, moving beyond the realm of the HighestYoga Tantra sadhana practices in which they are typically contextualized,to consider their role in the intertwined languages of offering and gen-erosity, eating and digestion, and alchemy and incorporation. To begin2For an account of the bali and nectar tasting rituals in the Vajrayogini tradition, seeElizabeth English, Vajrayogini, Her Visualizations, Rituals and Forms: A Study of the Cultof Vajrayogini in India, Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism (Boston: Wisdom Publica-tions, 2002), 206–20.

The Samarodaya Tantra, as anotherinstance available in English, also describes the flow of nectar (bdud rtsi) internally in thecourse of contemplative and yogic exercises; see Shinichi Tsuda, “The Samvarodaya-Tantra:Selected Chapters” (thesis, Australian National University, 1974), 314–15."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"History of Religions303with, however, my interest is in the fact that these substances, whateverthey may be, are to be eaten; and to be more specific, I am curious aboutthe use of the language of consumption, a discourse that I will call“gastronomic.” Most narrowly, the term “gastronomy” may refer to the artof cooking or to the art or science of “good eating”—I am not referring tothis sense (although it is not entirely absent, as we will hear the Canda-maharosana Tantra, for example, proclaiming exuberantly that a dietof urine, reproductive fluids, and excrement “is the best, eaten by allBuddhas!”).3 In this article I follow a broader understanding of the termgastronomy as referring to a relationship between culture and food. Thefield of gastronomy may thus include issues such as the production andpreparation of food and its conversion into complex “dishes,” the natureof recipes and cookbooks, food as communication, how culture delineateswhat counts as food and food taboos, how foods create identity, and soforth. By referring to a gastronomic discourse, I mean here to avoid theissue, for the moment, of whether human flesh, for instance, was actuallyor necessarily a component of these recipes, emphasizing instead the factthat whatever the substances really are, they are indeed called “humanflesh,” and so forth, and they are said to be prepared for consumption. Iwill expand on the significance of this approach later in this article.the recipes of vimalamitra’s eight chapters on nectarA gastronomic discourse of consuming human flesh and other bodyproducts, prepared following recipes targeted at achieving siddhi and othersupernormal aims, is central to the Tibetan corpus of Nyingma tantras,many of which are said to be based on indigenous Tibetan writings andon transmissions that occurred during the first diffusion of Buddhism intoTibet, during the eighth to the ninth centuries. The discourse is also at theheart of the Accomplishing Medicine practice, which, among other things,outlines actual procedures for creating “nectar medicine” (bdud rtsi sman)and which is found most widely discussed and practiced in the Nyingmatradition.4 One of the earliest sources in Tibet for the AccomplishingMedicine practice is a collection known as the Nectar Tantras, or theNectar Qualities (Bdud rtsi yon tan, Skt. Vajramrta) Tantras. This largecorpus, running over 600 folios in length in the Nyingma Collected Tantrasof the Ancients canon (Rnying ma rgyud ‘bum), contains at least twelve3Christopher S.

One of its key works is the Eight Chapters onNectar (Bdud rtsi bam po brgyad), part of which directly addresses thepractice of Accomplishing Medicine.5The Nectar Tantras collection is attributed to Vimalamitra, an Indianwho is said to have spent many years in Tibet around the turn of theeighth to the ninth centuries and who is considered a central figure in thetransmission and dissemination of Mahayoga and early Great Perfection(Rdzogs chen) teachings in Tibet. As I discuss elsewhere, Vimalamitra’sname is associated with the entire teaching cycle of the Nectar QualitiesTantras, which are based around the deity named Nectar Qualities, andwhich were eventually gathered as one of the Eight Means of Accomplish-ment (sgrub pa bka’ brgyad).6 As tantras, the narrative of these teachingsframes them as the speech of a Buddha, alternately referred to as Samanta-bhadra or the Nectar King, Bdud rtsi rgyal po. Although the texts of thiscycle are traditionally given Indian and divine origins, some Tibetans, in-cluding Zhi ba ‘od in the eleventh century, do argue that the Eight Chapterson Nectar, in particular, is itself an indigenously Tibetan text, albeit “com-posed in the guise of the word of the Buddha,” as Zhi ba ‘od puts it.7 De-spite this controversy, the Eight Chapters on Nectar appears both in theKangyur (Bka’ ‘gyur) and in the Collected Tantras of the Ancients, mean-ing that it was accepted as authoritatively Indian by the editors of thesemajor collections. The Nectar Tantras are also authoritative sources forthe medical traditions of Tibet.85This eight-chaptered text can be found at “Thams cad bdud rtsi lnga’i rang bzhin dngosgrub chen po nye ba’i snying po mchog gi lung bzhugs so,” in Rñi“ ma’i rgyud ‘bum: A Col-lection of Treasured Tantras Translated during the Period of the First Propagation of Buddhismin Tibet, reproduced from manuscripts preserved at Gti“-skyes Dgon-pa-bya“ monastery inTibet under the direction of Dingo Khyentse Rimpoche (Thimbu, 1973–75), vol. 26 (1a),147–200. Henceforth this will be referred to as the Eight Chapters on Nectar (Bdud rtsi bampo brgyad), although the title page of the work itself is as noted above. The Eight Chapterson Nectar is classified variously as an Anuyoga or Mahayoga teaching: Sangs rgyas gling paconsiders it an Anuyoga teaching, although the Gting skyes edition of the Rnying ma rgyud‘bum places it a Mahayoga category. (The former observation has been made by MichaelWalter, “The Role of Alchemy and Medicine in Indo-Tibetan Tantrism” [Indiana University,1980], 143 and 204ff., 144.)

The sixth of the eight chapters contains ex-plicit instructions on how to make nectar (bdud rtsi sbyor ba). Selectingand purifying a suitable place, the text says, the practitioner should makea mandala; it should be covered with excrement and urine, with five hu-man skulls placed at the cardinal points and in the center and lit with alamp fueled by human fat. The practitioner should obtain the skull of aBrahmin and place it at the mandala’s center, filled with five “fragrantnectars” (that is, the five human by-products or products designated astheir substitutes). To that mixture a number of fruit, plant, and mineralingredients are to be added, as well as the five meats and the five sub-stances that are extruded by the sense organs (the eyes, nose, ears, tongue,and heart). More ingredients are added to the concoction: grapes, wood-apple, mango, jackfruit, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, and soforth, plus the powder of ground-up gold, silver, copper, iron, and tur-quoise. As the practitioner stirs this brew, he (the text presupposes a male)chants mantras. “The excellent nectar mixed from these [ingredients] iscertain to bestow the fruits of siddhi,” the tantra asserts.9Once the practitioner has mixed his brew of nectar, he should next takeup the identity of a wrathful Heruka, he should be joined by a consort,and the pair should engage in sexual intercourse. At this point, the textpromises, “You will achieve facility with the vastness [of Buddhahood] andits causal conditions, and you will arrive at the samadhi of the peacefuldharmakaya. You will become possessed of the eight worldly siddhi andattain the empowerment of ultimate truth.”10 This ritual should be con-ducted while the female is menstruating, and the mixture of her blood andhis semen is referred to as “the best rasayana [ra sa ya na’i gtso bo].”11Instructions for a contemplative exercise follow.

As the light rays contract, the practitioner should grab holdof these “five medicines” (sman lnga) for himself. The five nectars hereare each associated with a Buddha and his seed syllable: Vairocana withexcrement, Amitabha with bodhicitta, Amoghasiddhi with flesh, Ratna-sambhava with blood, and Aksobhya with urine.12 The seed syllables thenmelt into five streams of the five nectars. Repeating this visualizationmany times, together with mantra recitation and hand gestures, the prac-titioner consecrates the nectar vessel at the center of the mandala by rest-ing his hand on its top. While the practice described in this text appearssoteriologically oriented primarily, we should note that enhanced personalpower in the form of siddhi is also obtained as a result of successful prac-tice, and language describing the nectar preparation as “medicine” isprominently placed.gu ru chos dbang’s nectar recipesAccording to Nyingma tradition, Vimalamitra shared these Nectar Tantraswith Padmasambhava, who gave them to King Khri srong lde btsan, whohid them away.13 While the texts of the Collected Tantras of the Ancientscannot be dated precisely and the authorship of many of its texts is un-clear, the teachings of the Eight Means of Accomplishment corpus, in-cluding the Nectar Tantras cycle, were made prominent several centurieslater, when they are said to have been discovered as treasure (gter ma)between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Their two main revealers,Nyang ral nyi ma ‘od zer (1124–92) and Nyang ral’s incarnate successor,Gu ru chos dbang (1212–70), are thus responsible for organizing and pre-senting coherently the teachings of the Nectar Qualities Tantras (whichare themselves part of the Nyingma Collected Tantras of the Ancients)within the organizational format of the Eight Means of Accomplishment.12These associations are common to other tantras; e.g., see a similar citation from Tsongkha pa in Alex Wayman, The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism (New York:Samuel Weiser, 1973), 116.13David Germano’s work (unpublished manuscript) on the early history of Great Perfec-tion authors has been helpful here. The teachings of both Vimalamitra and Padmasambhavaon these topics are addressed in Walter, “The Role of Alchemy and Medicine.” Also seeGarrett, “The Alchemy of Accomplishing Medicine.” On Guru Chos dbang, see work byJanet Gyatso, including “The Logic of Legitimation in the Tibetan Treasure Tradition,” His-tory of Religions 33, no. 2 (1993): 97–134, and “Guru Chos-dbang’s gTer ‘byung chen mo:An Early Survey of the Treasure Tradition and Its Strategies in Discussing Bon Treasure,”in Tibetan Studies: Proceedings of the Sixth International Association of Tibetan StudiesSeminar, ed.

In the process of developing these teachings, eachof these authors revealed, or wrote, a number of additional works spe-cifically on the nectar-creating process of Accomplishing Medicine, aswell as on the various uses of consecrated nectar.Significantly, Nyang ral nyi ma ‘od zer and Gu ru chos dbang livedduring the same periods as two foundational figures in the Tibetan medicaltradition. Nyang ral’s lifespan parallels that of G.yu thog yon tan mgonpo (1112–1203), editor/author of the Four Medical Tantras (Rgyud bzhi).Nyang ral’s successor, Gu ru chos dbang, similarly mirrors G.yu thog’smain student, Sum ston ye shes gzungs. Sum ston was redactor of a largeportion of the Yuthok Heart Essence Guru Sadhana (G.yu thog snying thigbla sgrub), which is the core ritual manual for the medical tradition’spractice of Accomplishing Medicine as it is performed still today.14 Whilethere is no evidence that either pair of Treasure Revealer and medical figurewas acquainted personally, we must nevertheless take critical note of theremarkable flourishing in Central Tibet of nectar-oriented writing thatoccurred during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, simultaneously in bothmedical and religious circles.Two consecutive texts from Gu ru chos dbang’s treasure revelation, themultivolume Consummation of Eight Secret Means of Accomplishment(Bka’ brgyad gsang ba yongs rdzogs), illustrate the practical turn takenin this period of writing on nectar and its uses. In his AccomplishingNectar Medicine (Bdud rtsi sman bsgrub), Gu ru chos dbang explainsthat a nectar elixir subdues the five afflictive poisons of desire, anger, de-lusion, pride, and envy and that it is also “a medicine for healing illnessand death.”15 The act of creating this nectar medicine requires a complexseries of procedures. Gu ru chos dbang notes that practitioners must referto other works for general instructions on how to complete aspects of theritual such as confessions, ritual cake (gtor ma) offerings, blessings, orhand gestures, explaining that there are no special ways of doing thesepractices in the context of this particular ceremony. The text focusesinstead on the tantric transformation of samsaric elements into medicinaltherapies, such that, as the Gu ru chos dbang says, “afflictions and poisonswill become medicine.”1614The Yuthok Heart Essence Guru Sadhana is the core of the Yuthok Heart Essence(G.yu thog snying thig) anthology; this anthology is discussed in some detail in Garrett,“The Alchemy of Accomplishing Medicine.”15“Dir yang dug lnga ‘joms shing na ba ‘chi gsos kyi sman du gyur pa’o,” Gu ru chos kyidbang phyug, “Zhi khro bka’ brgyad las bdud rtsi sman bsgrub,” in Bka’ brgyad gsa“ bayo“s rdzogs: A Complete Cycle of Rñi“-Ma-Pa Practice Focusing upon the Ancient EightPronouncements of Gu-Ru Rin-Po-Che (Paro: Ngodrup & Sherab Drimay, 1979), 3:278.This text is referred to simply as “Bdud rtsi sman bsgrub.”16“Nyon mongs dug rnams sman du ‘gyur,” ibid., 3:302."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Tantric Gastronomy308To effect this transformation, Gu ru chos dbang explains, the practitionershould first draw a mandala and arrange on top of it the ritual ingredients,organized into sets of eight. In addition to the eight parts of a plant (root,trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, bark, resin, fruit), this arrangement alsoincludes the five nectars, each of which has eight kinds. Thus the first ofthe five, excrement, may include the excrement of an accomplished lama,the excrement of one who has been liberated from the five karmic results(‘bras bu lnga sgrol ba), the excrement of one who has died naturally,the excrement of Kukuraja (ku ku ra tsa),17 the excrement of flower (i.e.,honey), the excrement of various birds, the excrement of various fish, orthe excrement of an elephant. The eight types of bodhicitta, the secondof the five nectars, may include the perfected aspect of bone, which isteeth; the perfected aspect of the senses, which are eyeballs; the perfectedaspect of sinew (chu rgyus), which are nails; perfected bodhicitta, whichare bone drops (rus thig) and bone relics (sha ri ram); the bezoar (go rotsa na) that naturally results from bodhicitta; and so forth.18 The eighttypes of flesh include flesh from the two hands, the two feet, the lungs,tongue, kidney, and anus. The eight kinds of blood include the blood ofwhite dog, horse blood, buffalo blood, corpse blood, blood of the rightnostril of a woman (yum), and vulture blood. The eight kinds of urine,finally, are the water of ocean froth, bitumen stone (brag zhun rdo) water,the water of calcite elixir (bdud rtsi cong zhi), the water of bodhicitta ofthe great Lentsa deity (lan tsha lha chen), the water of a woman (yum),the water of man’s (yab) penis (rdo rje), the water of one who has beenliberated from karmic results, and the water of a corpse’s legs (bam gyirkang chu). A long list of additional obscure ingredients follows this pre-sentation, including beers, waters, and milks that are to be poured intoskull cups; other ingredients are to be measured in eggshells and placedaround the mandala.With the mandala fully decorated by these substances, Gu ru chos dbangexplains that a series of common ritual actions should be performed.Medicine Buddhas and other figures should be invited to the ceremony asthe propitiant clears his or her own mind of conceptuality through a seriesof verse recitations, hand gestures, cymbal playing, incense burning, andpouring beer. The nectar offerings are then purified through visualization17Kukuraja may refer to a teacher of Marpa or simply to special excrement. The excrementof important religious masters is commonly held to be especially valuable and is said to bepreserved over generations for use in ritual preparations. It may also refer to dog feces.18This entire list is obscure: “byang chub sems kyi rtsa ba brgyad ni / rus pa mthar phyinpa so / dbang po mthar phyin pa mig ‘bras / chu rgyus mthar phyin pa sen mo / byang semsmthar phyin rus thig dang gdung sha ri ram / byang sems rgyu mthun go ro tsa na / rgyun lamgzhung pa / byang sems ro myang gsang rten ‘bras bcas bsag,” Gu ru chos kyi dbang phyug,“Bdud rtsi sman bsgrub,” 280."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"History of Religions309techniques and mantra recitation. Instructions are later given for a vaseempowerment ritual: the officiant imagines the mandala deities meltinginto the nectar in the vase, and he then pours the top portion of the nectarout of the vase into the beer cup. The vase is placed on the student’s head,and the deities melt into the student’s body from it, whereupon empower-ment is conferred.While the highlighting of numerous esoteric ingredients in this textand its explicit and repeated reference to nectar as medicine distinguishthis work from the earlier Eight Chapters on Nectar, described above,both texts share the structure of a tantric sadhana. Immediately followingAccomplishing Nectar Medicine, however, is quite a different sort of text.Gu ru chos dbang’s Accomplishing Medicine Applications (Sman bsgrublas tshogs) offers a range of practically oriented recipes for the use ofconsecrated nectar to achieve various aims. He provides a general recipefor combining the five nectars into a concoction that may then be used asa base ingredient for more elaborate prescriptions: “Six liters [bre] ofnectar [bdud rtsi, that is, excrement], a handful of human flesh, onepalmful of blood, half of that of white bodhicitta bezoar [go ro tsa na],and however much urine is appropriate.”19 Recommended sources forcollecting these ingredients are provided: for example, the bodhicitta maybe the brains of a sixteen-year-old child, the blood may come from yourlama’s consort, caretaker, or female student, and the urine may be takenfrom a young child born to your lama and his consort.20 The sources forthese substances are not the same as those presented in Gu ru chos dbang’sAccomplishing Nectar Medicine, emphasizing the fact that the five nectarsare defined differently for different purposes or in different contexts.Following the general recipe above, Gu ru chos dbang offers a seriesof prescriptions for mixtures that cure illness or enhance personal healthand power. Thus, if you mix the juice-like nectar with more than thirtyadditional ingredients, including turmeric, a tooth tip, bitumen, whiteaconite (bong nga), barberry bark, camphor, a young boy’s bezoar, andvarious other medicinal substances, then this compound may be used totreat contagious diseases or poisons. Adding calcite (cong zhi), pitch (bragzhun), saffron, bal bu leaves, the three salts, pomegranate, and the fleshof a lammergeyer to a handful of nectar will clear up bladder disease.Heart disease may be treated with a mixture of a handful of nectar to-gether with nutmeg, Khun tree (shing khun), molasses, and black aloe.2119“Sbyar tshad ni bdud rtsi bre drug la sha chen phul gang / ragta khyor gang / go ro tsana byang sems dkar po de’i phyed / dri chu ci rigs sbyor ‘phrod do,” Gu ru chos kyi dbangphyug, “Sman sgrub las tshogs,” in Bka’ brgyad gsa“ ba yo“s rdzogs, 3:307.20Ibid. In the recipes of this text, bdud rtsi when not otherwise qualified appears to referto excrement (of whatever type).21Ibid., 308."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Tantric Gastronomy310Other recipes are given for the treatment of diseases of the lungs, kidneys,bile, leprosy, smallpox, eye disease, and more, some of them offering rec-ommended dosages and times for ingesting the compounds. Some reme-dies address what even in biomedical terms we may identify as “medical”conditions, but many address spirit possession, a treatable “medical con-dition” in most Tibetan contexts. For example, “combine nectar in themeasure of a sparrow-egg-full, sulphur, asafetida, musk, greens, ginger,salt, human fat, white mustard, and zinc. Mix them, and make a pill thesize of a middling dung pellet of a deer. If you rely on it for 21 days, youwill be free from klu [spirits], poison, and gdon [spirits].”22In addition to recipes aimed at the healing of illness there are prescrip-tions for enhancing one’s personal health or power. For example, “combinea full liter [bre] of good calcite, an eggful of bamboo pith, the bodhicitta-bezoar of a person, horse, dog, bird, and so forth, vajra-ruler testicle-gland,fat, marrow, ash-colored dorje, pitch—mix them well, [make] a white pill,and put it into a bowl or a skull-cup. If you take it, it will make your bodyripen and become perfected.”23 There are also recipes for enhancing per-sonal power through increasing semen or wealth, controlling territory, andthe powers of fast-walking and flying. Although most recipes here areaimed at the healing of illness, the collection is not organized as remediesmight be in a medical text. Rather, the organizational scheme of ritual isused, with recipes for activities (las sbyor) that have peaceful, enhancing,controlling, or ferocious effects. Burning the nectar, for example, pour-ing it in a reliquary, or tossing it into a burnt offering (sbyin sreg) fire,will have ferocious and destructive results.Finally, the last section of this text includes culinary instructions for six-teen different ways of processing nectar mixtures: nectar may be putre-fied, toned down, enhanced, boiled, ground up, dried, pushed, powdered,in pill form, in ointment form, cooked with plants, or prepared as soup,beer, butter, porridge, or milk soup. Each recipe involves adding additionalingredients to the nectar and processing the mixture in a certain way. Forexample, “to make a nectar beer, [mix the nectar] with an equal portionof good powder. Boil it to well cooked, and make a paste. Add to it a finefermenting agent, and by covering it for two or three days, it will rise up.Strain out the liquid gently, and it will be beer.”2422“Bdud rtsi khra’i sgong nga gang gi tshad la / mu zi / shing kun / gla rtsi / tshal / lga /tshwa / tshil chen / yungs kar / ti tsha rnams sbyar te / ril bu gla ba’i ril ma ‘bring po tsambyas te / zhag nyer gcig tu brten na klu dug gdon las thar ro,” ibid., 3:313.23“Cong zhi bzang po bre gang / cu gang sgo nga gang la / mi rta khyi bya la sogs pa’ibyang sems go ro tsa na / mi dbang rdo rje rlig ‘bras chu ba / tshil bu rkang mar / thal kha rdorje / brag zhun / rnams legs par sbyar ba’i ril bu dkar yol lam thod par blugs te longs spyadna lus smin cing rdzogs par byed,” ibid., 310.24“Bdud rtsi chang du bya ba ni / phye bzang dang cha mnyam ste / tshos par btsos lachang bu bya / de la phab zhib mo btab la zhag gnyis gsum gnan pas langs pa dang / chu ‘jambsings pas chang du ‘gyur,” ibid., 316.One Line Long"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"History of Religions311Although much of this text reads like a recipe book, it is clearly em-bedded in a larger framework of tantric practice. Like many tantric prac-tices, Accomplishing Medicine has different levels, and its recipes andtransformative operations are thus contextualized in a taxonomic schemeof Buddhist tantric activity. In Accomplishing Medicine Applications, Guru chos dbang explains that there are external, internal, and secret formsof practice. The external practice involves exercises such as creating bev-erages from excrement, the “three hots,”25 old butter and milk, and thencombining that liquid with solid ingredients for hot or cold illness, asappropriate to the yogin, to form pills that are taken daily for six months.The inner practice involves such activities as consuming a mixture madefrom the flesh of a seven-times-born Brahmin and the “ever-weepingbodhisattva” nectar (bdud rtsi rtag tu ngu), sulphur (mu zi), and the hindpart of a brown frog. The secret practice involves sustaining a meditationon the view or achieving the deity together with a well-qualified consort(phyag rgya ma).26 Gu ru chos dbang’s classification of AccomplishingMedicine into external, internal, and secret forms organizes a hierarchythat places the healing of illness at one extreme and the contemplativepractice of deity yoga at the other. We should take note, however, of thepresence of these aims along a single scale: healing illness, enhancinghealth and power, and achieving union with the deity are all enabledthrough the medium of nectar; to put it another way, they are all ex-pressed in the language of nectar, a language that calls upon a particularvocabulary of ingredients and recipes and a particular grammar of en-hancement and transformation. As I will discuss further below, this is alanguage that is used in other contexts and that is connected to realms ofhealing, alchemy, digestion, and incorporation.g.yu thog’s teachings on the use of human productsWhile Gu ru chos dbang was studying and compiling the Nectar Tantrasand articulating their nectar recipes, the students of medical scholar G.yuthog yon tan mgon po were also refining their own teacher’s instructions,working to create and disseminate the Four Medical Tantras, the EighteenAdditional Practices (Cha lag bco brgyad), the Yuthok Heart Essence GuruSadhana, and other works that represent both tradition and innovation inthirteenth-century Tibetan medical practice and theory. Like Gu ru chosdbang, G.yu thog’s teachings in both the Guru Sadhana and the FourMedical Tantras rely on an array of materia medica, including humanbody products, for recipes that heal illness and enhance personal health25The “three hots” (tsha ba gsum) are black pepper (pho ba ris), long pepper (pi pi ling),and medicinal ginger (sman lga).26Gu ru chos kyi dbang phyug, “Sman sgrub las tshogs,” 3:317."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Tantric Gastronomy312and power. The Guru Sadhana, a collection that primarily consists of in-structions for contemplative, yogic, and ritual practice, contains a long,practically oriented section on healing, because in its view illnesses con-stitute obstacles on the path to liberation.27 Here too, we find a recipecollection in which human products feature prominently. A wind illnessmay be treated with a noodle soup made from human flesh,28 or a decoctionof human bones sprinkled with white garlic: “Cut white garlic into piecesand boil it down with a handful of water and a handful of milk. Leave thematerial that does not dissolve, and consume the liquid lukewarm.”29If we look at the more performative aspects of the Yuthok Heart EssenceGuru Sadhana’s ritual practice, moreover, we see its contribution toanother key aspect of Tibetan tantric gastronomy, one in which a divinehost of ritual participants engage in feasting on human bodies. The ico-nography and lore of the dharmapalas or protectors (srung ma), a largeclass of Tibetan deities focused on the protection of Buddhism, portraythese figures as cannibalistic in their savage otherness. These protectorsplay a critical role in the medical tradition’s practice of AccomplishingMedicine, as described in the Yuthok Heart Essence Guru Sadhana and asperformed by physician-ritualists today. One of the chief protector deitiesfor the medical tradition, for example, is Zhang blon Rdo rje bdud ‘dul,“Minister Demon-Taming Thunderbolt.” Like other deities, Rdo rje bdud‘dul may take different forms: he is sometimes known as a medicine god(sman gyi lha), and he may appear as the Medicine Buddha’s attendant(sman bla’i bka’ sdod). He is also chief member of the group of nine pro-tectors of the medical tradition (bka’ sdod srung ma zhang blod dam cansde sgu), and these nine are therefore also the protectors of the tradition’sAccomplishing Medicine practice.

It is with this participatory conscious-ness that the practitioner-as-deity interacts intimately with the summonedassembly of Buddhas and protectors, such as Shan ti ro zan ma or Ekajati,while consecrating the culinary preparation, thereby effecting its trans-formation into nectar. Thus, in the language that dominates Accomplish-ing Medicine as a performed ritual narrative, these protectors and theirdietary dispositions are key participants of a ritual grammar in whichhumans are not only consumers of food, but consumed as food.The medical tradition’s gastronomic rhetoric of consuming humans isnot articulated exclusively by such examples from the esoteric GuruSadhana, however.

According to this body of literature, then, consumption of humanfeces, for example, treats tumors, poisoning, swellings, and demonic pos-session; the consumption of human excrement is also recommended asan antidote to the effects of aging.34 Human urine protects one againstcontagious disease; an eight-year-old child’s urine may be especiallyhelpful for contagious diseases or spirit possession. Human fat helps curewind diseases and reduce boils. Blood collected by means of bloodlettingis used in various recipes, and uterine blood builds muscle tissue, treatsleprosy, and is a remedy for ruptured blood vessels.

On the useof breast milk in Chinese medicine, e.g., see Nathan Sivin and William C. Cooper, “Man asMedicine: Pharmacological and Ritual Aspects of Traditional Therapy Using Drugs Derivedfrom the Human Body,” in Chinese Science: Explorations of an Ancient Tradition, ed.

On medical uses of human products ingeneral in China, also see Key Ray Chong, Cannibalism in China (Wakefield, NH: LongwoodAcademic, 1990). Referred to by some as “medical cannibalism,” the medicinal use of humanproducts has also been documented in Europe since the first century. From the sixteenththrough the eighteenth centuries the use of human flesh, organs, blood, skull, marrow, andother parts of the body was widespread in Europe, where “mummy shops” sold human fleshcarved from preserved human bodies, ideally those who had died violently. Human flesh wassold by reputable pharmaceutical companies in Germany as recently as the early twentiethcentury.

Whereas medical worksfocus largely on healing illness, their significant attention to prophylacticmeasures and the enhancement of health, longevity, and power should notbe ignored; our inordinate focus on the former may simply be the resultof our own sense of what “medicine” is. Similarly, while Tantric Buddhistworks focus largely on the achievement of supermundane aims, their sig-nificant attention to the healing of illness and the enhancement of per-sonal power should not be sidelined. As I will discuss further below, agastronomy of human by-products in both medical and religious realmsreveals a language of consumption and incorporation that is shared, andthis commonality is an indication of the close interconnectedness of thetwo traditions.gastronomy, alchemy, and incorporationIn an important article, “Beef, Dog, and Other Mythologies: ConnotativeSemiotics in Mahayoga Tantra Ritual and Scripture,” Christian Wedemeyercharacterizes secondary scholarship on tantric antinomianism as limitedby an understanding of the language of tantric texts as “directly denota-tive natural language.” Within such an understanding, he argues convinc-ingly, scholars have read the tantras either literally or figuratively, twoapproaches that are themselves undergirded by a “realist” project that canonly ask whether the tantras “really meant what they said.” Wedemeyerexplains further that “the fundamental terms of the debate have revolvedexclusively around the question of what signified or signifieds correspondto the signifiers found in Tantric discourse. When it says ‘beef,’ for in-stance, does that mean (real) beef or something else? The questions whichhave guided research in this area have all been posed accordingly.”37Drawing from the field of semiotics, Wedemeyer suggests an alterna-tive approach to the Buddhist tantric discourse of “transgression,” pro-posing that it works on a “higher-order semiological system” based onthe signifying function of language, a system in which the identity of theactual signified may in fact be irrelevant. Signifying functions may bedetermined by examining how language operates in a given cultural con-text; that is, in the case of tantric transgressive commandments, the kindsof transgression signified “take their meanings from the cultural contextwithin which they were deployed.”38 Considering Buddhist tantras tooperate in an Indian context defined by notions of brahmanical purity,Wedemeyer thus proposes that prescriptions to consume forbidden sortsof flesh, for example, should be understood not as being about forbidden37Wedemeyer, “Beef, Dog, and Other Mythologies,” 10.38Ibid., 30.One Line Short"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"History of Religions317flesh but, rather, as constituting “a grammar of purity and pollution.” Whatis important about the use of these substances, he argues, “is their signi-fying function, their ability to instantiate ritual pollution as a lived fact.”39Wedemeyer’s article is an insightful and valuable addition to scholar-ship on the Indian tantras, and in this article I am taking a similar approachby understanding tantric discourse to function in realms of significationbeyond the denotative. However, I should like to suggest two adaptationsto Wedemeyer’s approach. First, while I agree that it will be fruitful toexamine how the nectar discourses “take their meanings from the culturalcontext” within which they operate, I believe that we must see this dis-course to operate in multiple contexts. In the case of the Tibetan nectarteachings discussed above, there is a complex network of narrative asso-ciations, as well as a polyvalence of levels on which these associationsare significant; interpreting a singular cultural context in which languageoperates is not a simple matter, if it is even a possibility at all. In thisarticle, therefore, I describe several areas of thought and practice (several“cultures,” we might say) from which nectars take their significance duringthe period of Tibetan literature in question. Second, while I appreciatethe ways in which Wedemeyer’s approach shifts our attention away fromsimplistic questions about whether Buddhists really eat human flesh, forexample, I am not fully convinced by his conclusion that the identity ofthe actual substances involved in these tantric practices is irrelevant orarbitrary.40 Discussions of the various substances used in nectar recipesor in healing prescriptions, such as those above, as well as expositions onthe special powers of particular substances, as will be described below,suggest that the identity of the actual substances was in fact extremelyimportant for Tibetans.Christian Wedemeyer may be correct that in the case of the Indiantantra he examines, the use of certain forbidden meats as “that which isdisgusting and polluting” for contemporaneous Indians, mainly signifiesthe “violation of ritual purity” in that Indian context. But there are otherways that human by-products and their consumption may be seen, even inIndian Buddhist esoteric and exoteric literature, and it should go without39Ibid., 25.40Ibid. Wedemeyer actually says that the question of whether the terms signify real objects,in a literal sense, is “close to irrelevant.” He follows this statement by saying that “what isimportant is their signifying function.” My point here is that this is not the only thing that isimportant and that many of the texts in question, in the Tibetan case, as well as contemporaryTibetan practitioners today, do in fact consider the presence of the actual substances to bevery important, whether or not they are able to obtain them. Antonio Terrone has told me ofTreasure Revealers in Kham who have asked him repeatedly to bring them the brains of apeacock, which they consider a critical ingredient for some of their pill recipes. They havenever been able to include the substance in their pills, and yet they continue to worry aboutits absence (personal communication, 2009)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Tantric Gastronomy318saying that Tibetan contexts are very different from Indian contexts. AsIndian texts traveled across the Himalayas, which of the various modelsof consumption might have been best suited to Tibetan sensibilities? Aswe briefly survey some alternative Indian Buddhist contexts for the gas-tronomy of human by-products, we will consider how these may haveinformed the nectar teachings discussed above. While from one point ofview the use of human flesh, for example, may be disgusting and pollut-ing, from another perspective it may be considered the distilled quintes-sence of the body, refined by the purifying processes of digestion or byone’s moral perfection. Regardless of the details of higher-order semiotics,Tibetans may have understood human body parts and substances to be“medicinal” and, therefore, effective for enhancing personal power, muchas Europeans of the eighteenth century did.41the magical powers of nectar: indian precedents and tibetan adaptationsWe have seen that a gastronomic discourse of human by-products is sharedby tantric and medical traditions in Tibet, their therapeutic and magicalrecipes calling for a cornucopia of common and rare ingredients. Recipesfor nectarous compounds made from obscure, often human-derived, sub-stances and marketed as effective for the achievement of supermundaneand ordinary aims, were not a Tibetan invention, however, as they are partof a gastronomy extensively recorded in Indian tantras. The Cakrasam-vara Tantra, for instance, recommends the use of some or all of the fivenectars and meats, plus the use of other human waste products, in recipesaimed at perfecting or healing oneself. It teaches, for instance, of thespeedy method of obtaining supernormal powers by eating the flesh ofpersons born seven times as a Brahmin; specifically, one should eat theconcretion (Skt. rocana, a concretion or “bezoar” used often in medicineand found in organ meat) formed in the Brahmin’s heart, whereupon onewill instantly become able to fly, travel “tens of millions of leagues,”gain omniscience, and obtain a divine body.42 The power of invisibilitymay be obtained by eating a pill consisting of skin from a hero’s foot,41See n. 35.42David B.

Human flesh and liquor offered thrice nightly 108 timeswill subjugate an entire region for six months.45 The Cakrasamvara is notat all unusual in these recommendations: many tantras attest to the powerof consuming human by-products to bestow supernatural or magical abili-ties. The Guhyasamaja Tantra links the eating of human flesh to attain-ment of the Buddha’s body, speech, and mind; the eating of feces andurine with becoming a Vidyadhara; and the eating of horse flesh with be-coming invisible.46The consumption of one’s own bodily wastes and that of one’s consortis repeatedly idealized as a part of yogic sex play in the Candamaharo-sana, an explanatory tantra for the Guhyasamaja: “With the tongue heshould clean the holes of the nose and the corners of the eyes [of theconsort]. And he should eat all the waste produced from between the[consort’s] teeth.”47 Although the verses of this text dwell more conspic-uously on sexual technique than on contemplative attainment, the tantranotes that “in this very lifetime the practitioner [of these techniques]gains the title of Candamaharosana.”48 More explicitly, the consumptionof bodily wastes is praised as a technique of healing and immortality:He should eat her vomit, and eat the feces! And he should drink the fluid of thevagina, and eat phlegm.Just as when manure is applied, a tree becomes abundantly fruitful, so does aperson have the true fruits of pleasure by eating unclean things.Neither old age, sickness, nor death comes to that person. And he who honorsthe unclean, and who is properly disciplined, will succeed.4943Gray, The Cakrasamvara Tantra, 210. Sakya Pandita explains that these human andanimal substances do not work this way automatically—they must be made powerful by aconsecration that renders them ambrosial. Thus in this view it is not a power inherent to thehuman substance but rather one that is divinely imposed.

If one skims it and applies it to one’s eyes one willquickly obtain superhuman perception”).52 The Mahakala Tantra centersaround a teaching on the achievement of eight powers, called the powersof sword, ointment, pill, the slipper, medicine, mantras, mercury, and longlife.53 In this tantra’s sadhana, the yogin, generating himself as the pro-tector deity Mahakala, engages in a series of contemplative exercises,mantra recitations, offerings, and so forth, during which he consumes thefive nectars and five meats.54 The work is a repository of numerous recipes,mantras, and other occult technologies for the achievement of mundaneand extraordinary magical aims, such as rain production, exorcism orenemy control, seeing underground, flying, curing illness, enhancinghealth, or discovering buried treasure.Indian Buddhist tantras thus prescribe the consumption of human by-products for a range of purposes and at different points in ritual pro-cesses, to feed oneself, one’s consort, or the deities, and as such, thistantric gastronomy extends across registers of Buddhist practice frommundane to supermundane.

The “crazy yogin” Tsang nyon heruka (1452–1507), to cite one of many examples, is said to have eaten rotting, maggotybrains taken from decapitated heads; those who joined him in this feastattained siddhi.57While in certain contexts the intention behind these prescriptions mayindeed be to disgust, therein signifying a violation of ritual purity, fromanother perspective, the products comprising these prescriptions signify thethoroughly pervading and distinctly physical effects of moral perfection,such that the flesh of a yogi or a man born seven times as a Brahmin, forinstance, is the distilled quintessence of the morally perfected body and,therefore, an especially powerful food substance for the rest of us. AsReiko Ohnuma has shown, this understanding of the relationship betweenmoral perfection and physicality is in fact an exoteric Buddhist, and evenpan-Indian, notion.the gift of food: human flesh for the godsA discourse on the value of consuming the flesh of a spiritually superiorbeing is widespread in the South Asian world. In her Head, Eyes, Flesh,and Blood: Giving Away the Body in Indian Buddhist Literature, ReikoOhnuma documents the theme across Indian Buddhist literature, begin-ning with tales of the Buddha’s past lives as a bodhisattva, many of whichdepict him giving his body as food for others. So common is this “gift-of-the-body” theme that Ohnuma considers it a discrete subgenre ofBuddhist narrative literature.58 In these stories the Buddha often has theform of an animal, and yet it is clear that the hare or the fish, for example,who donates his body to satisfy another’s hunger is really the bodhisattvahimself. In some stories the bodhisattva is human, appearing as a kingor prince who gives his body to alleviate others’ suffering. These are ex-treme acts of generosity and also teachings of the body’s impermanenceand insignificance. In the Narayanapariprccha sutra the bodhisattva en-courages others to think, “If any being needs anything for any reasonwhatsoever, I will give it, as long as it seems right. I will give my handsto whoever asks for my hands, my feet to whoever asks for my feet, myeyes to whoever asks for my eyes. I will abandon flesh, blood, bonemarrow, major and minor limbs.” In the Vajradhvaja sutra he says, “If Ishould give to this supplicant the intestines, the liver, the heart, or the57E.

Following the Indian tropethat religious practice physically purifies the body, the qualities of thebodhisattva’s flesh as food are linked to his high moral virtue: “throughconstant moral practice and cultivation of virtue, the bodhisattva gradually‘seasons’ his flesh and transforms it into a magical elixir capable of sav-ing all beings.”60 Ohnuma’s work presents stories of encounters betweendemons and kings: kings offer their own flesh to demons while demonsdiscuss the qualities of human flesh, extolling human meat that is “glis-tening flesh, freshly cut by the blade of a sword, abundant in quantity,warm and red in color.”61Such stories were of course known to Tibetans, likely serving as a con-ceptual basis for a variation on Tibetan nectar practices in which one’sown body serves as food for the gods. In Lobsang Tharchin’s accountof Vajrayogini practice, for example, the practitioner, having taken theguise of a deity, rises above her material body and begins to destroy it withan ax. The flesh, bones, and blood of her own material body are fittedinto a skull cup and then transformed into nectar—in other words, it isone’s own body that constitutes the nectar in this instance of the practice.The practitioner-as-deity then offers this nectar to the assembled guestsof lamas, buddhas, bodhisattvas, sages, and sentient beings, her body serv-ing to nourish an even larger party.62 The act of separating one’s mindand body and feeding the body to an assembly of guests is central to theTibetan practice known as “casting out the body as food” (phung pogzan bskyur). This act is familiar as the heart of the Severance (Gcod)tradition, in which a practitioner visualizes chopping up her own bodyand offering it to assembled guests or demons.6359Ibid., 6. For a relevant and important discussion of the motif of feeding others withone’s own flesh in Chinese Buddhist art and narrative, see Winston Kyan, “The Body and theFamily: Filial Piety and Buddhist Art in Late Medieval China” (PhD thesis, University ofChicago, 2006).

Bringing to mind Indian models of the bodhisattva’sflesh as food, Sa chen kun dga’ snying po (1092–1158) argued that theman born seven times as a Brahmin is in fact a bodhisattva willing to giveup his body, hence the great potency of this flesh.64 Treasure-revealerPadma gling pa (1450–1521) affirms the figure of the seven-times-a-Brahmin as the bodhisattva Avalokite¶vara himself, the bodhisattvadonating his body again and again when called for in healing and occultrecipes.65The offering of the human body and its products as food for the godsis therefore both a nontantric and tantric motif that spans the Buddhistworld, temporally and geographically. If a sage is recognized as a spiri-tually superior being, or if one’s own body is transformed by tantric prac-tice into that of a deity, all the more precious do its gastronomic qualitiesbecome. From this perspective we cannot identify those bodily substancesas signifying that which is disgusting and polluting, as Wedemeyer sug-gests, having limited his consideration of the nectars to an examinationof their relationship with purity strictures in certain circles of Indian so-ciety. To the contrary, those bodily substances are among the purest andmost powerful relics of perfection a Buddhist can discover.We can look beyond stories of the bodhisattva’s generosity, however,to find that an understanding of human by-products as purified distilla-tions of religious practice or moral perfection is also supported by SouthAsian and Tibetan presentations of how food creates the body. Accordingto Tibetan digestive physiology, which is itself based closely on anAyurvedic model, the internal purification of consumed food and drinkactually creates the bodily constituents and organs, which is to say, thephysicality of the body itself. As food is digested, it is transformed in thestomach into nutrients (dwangs) and wastes (snyigs); wastes are excretedas urine and feces, and nutrients are metabolized to create the body’sphysical components. The processes of decomposing phlegm (tshim byedbad kan), digestive heat (me drod) and bile (mkhris pa ‘ju byed), andfire-accompanying wind (me dang mnyam pa’i rlung) transform nutrientsinto blood, which is itself transformed into flesh, which becomes sequen-tially fat, bone tissue, and bone marrow. Marrow produces the male andfemale reproductive substances (khu ba, sometimes referred to as semen,but possessed by women as well as men). The digestive process culminates64Cited in Gray, “Eating the Heart of the Brahmin,” 65.65Cited in Holly Gayley, “Soteriology of the Senses in Tibetan Buddhism,” Numen 54(2007): 459–99."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Tantric Gastronomy324in this creation of reproductive substances, which are as a result the dis-tilled and perfected essence of the body as created by consumed food.66Thus, when a practitioner consumes a nectar preparation, she is in a literalsense recreating her own body with that sublime nectar. Her own physicalby-products, moreover, could be said to be constitutionally nectarous.Discussed in the Four Medical Tantras and also a basic component ofAyurvedic medicine, which was known to many Tibetans in the twelfthand thirteenth centuries, this digestive physiology would have been fa-miliar to those who wrote on Accomplishing Medicine practices at thattime. Although to my knowledge the physiological mechanics of digest-ing nectar preparations are not addressed in the Nectar Tantras or in theAccomplishing Medicine works by Gu ru chos dbang or G.yu thog yontan mgon po’s students, we should nevertheless consider whether digestivephysiology might be a critical part of the gastronomy of nectar practices.Were this to be so, we could see in Accomplishing Medicine two paralleltransformative processes: the ritual transformation of human by-products(or whatever substances are consumed under their name) into nectar inthe course of a tantric sadhana, on the one hand, and the physiologicaltransformation of foods, such as nectar preparations, into the perfectedessence of the body, the reproductive substance, in the course of digestion,on the other. The gastronomic discourse of the five nectars and meatscould thus be seen in the context of the multilayered languages and tech-nologies of digestive and alchemical creation and transformation.conclusionIn this essay, I have made a historical observation and a pair of relatedmethodological arguments. Historically, I have pointed to the twelfth andthirteenth centuries as a remarkably creative period of development forNyingma and medical scholars alike, who shared at this time an enthusiasmfor a language of nectar, a language of consuming human bodies, as a wayof writing about personal enhancement. Using a particular vocabulary ofingredients and recipes and a particular grammar of incorporation andtransformation, these writers used nectar discourses to describe technolo-gies of healing illness, enhancing health and power, and achieving union66On digestive physiology according to several Ayurvedic models, see SurendranathDasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, 5 vols.

Their nectar gastronomy is defined in exoteric and esotericrecipes, contemplative and performative exercises, and Mahayanist notionsof the link between moral perfection and embodiment and is tied to a di-gestive physiology in which the body is literally created by the purifica-tion of one’s food. This extraordinary constellation of discursive contextswas crystallized in a single practice, that of Accomplishing Medicine, animportant teaching throughout history for Tibetan Buddhists of all tradi-tions and the central focus of the key esoteric practice cycle for the medicaltradition, the Yuthok Heart Essence (G.yu thog snying thig). In sharingthis practice, tantric and medical practitioners and scholars have togetherdeveloped a language of transformation (healing, empowering, enlight-ening) through incorporation (consuming food, consuming the other,consuming the deity) and creation (taking a new birth, becoming pure,becoming the deity), a language which shaped each tradition indelibly.This observation has been made possible by a pair of key methodo-logical orientations. First, taking a broad view of the scope of bothmedical and tantric writings, and limiting ethnocentric presuppositionsconcerning what “medicine” is or what “religion” is, has allowed me toattend to the medical tradition’s focus on enhancement of health, longevity,and power, not to mention its substantial writings on ritual and contem-plative practices; we can similarly attend to the widespread occurrence ofhealing remedies in tantric works. A focus on nectar discourses acrossthese (presumed) disciplinary boundaries makes obvious the shared natureof this language. Second, following Christian Wedemeyer’s recommen-dation that we examine how tantric discourses operate within specificcultural contexts, I have examined several ways in which the consump-tion of human bodies or “nectars” may signify something other than theliteral eating of human flesh. But I have been unwilling to disregard thefact that in all of these rites, eating does occur. The act of eating itself issignificant, and the identity of what is eaten is also important. Tantric pre-scriptions to consume consecrated human flesh may signify engagementin practices of bodily purification or moral perfection. Or, especiallywhen seen in conjunction with iconographic representations of nectar-practice protector deities, it may signify a type of “cannibal talk,” toborrow Obeyesekere’s phrase.67 But the prescriptions and their practices67See Gananath Obeyesekere, Cannibal Talk: The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrificein the South Seas (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005). By “cannibal talk” I donot refer to an external claim that Tibetans are cannibals, however, but rather to the practiceof such a discourse within Tibet itself. Obeyesekere argues that the term “cannibalism”rightly applies only to a colonialist discourse, one spoken as power over that which is theultimate “other”; he reserves the term “anthropophagy” for discussion of the practice itself(ibid., 14). My point here is that we can see such a discourse operating within Tibet itself.External references to Tibetans as cannibals, on the other hand, have at least an 800-year-old"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Tantric Gastronomy326also do, in fact, involve consuming something, and just what that some-thing is, is the subject of many hundreds of pages of writing in Tibetanliterature, as well as a subject of concern for real Buddhist practitioners.It is for this reason that I see nectar discourses as a gastronomic discourse,for it is the command to eat, to incorporate an Other as food, that is at theheart of all of the practices described above.University of Torontohistory, including “observations” of cannibalism in Tibetan regions by Friar John (c. 1180–1252), Marco Polo (1254–1324), William of Rubruck (c. 1220–93), della Penna (1680–1745),and more recently, Wright, Landor, Waddell, and a Chinese-made YouTube video entitled“Tibet—Cannibal Monks Reveal Their True Faces,” spawned by the riots of 2008.
