These can all becondensed into the categories of sūtra and tantra. The latter of these two, inturn, contains the ocean of tantras, statements, and oral instructions.In India and Tibet the practice of this vajra vehicle of Secret Mantraflourished and the number of practitioners who gained liberation through thesepractices is truly beyond count. Today the legacy of these great beings is stillwith us in the form of an uninterrupted lineage of realized masters who upholdthe teachings and practices of the vajra vehicle. In this way it is still in ourhands to connect with this tradition and make enlightenment a living experiencefor us as well.To accomplish this we must rely on living lineage masters and key scripturesthat outline the practice and theory of tantra. I am therefore pleased topresent translations of two important guidance manuals concerned with thepractice of tantra. Both Kunkyen Tenpe Nyima and Shechen Gyaltsap wereextraordinary teachers, and today their works are among the most cherishedscriptures on the practice of the development stage. In fact, although bothtexts focus predominantly on the development stage, the key points of the wholeof tantric practice are all contained in these pithy instructions. I amtherefore confident that sincere practitioners will find great inspiration andguidance in these precious texts.Even though the message laid out in these translations is generally clear andready to be applied, it is of utmost importance to first receive the guidance ofa realized master of the lineage. Only by connecting with such a master andreceiving empowerment, reading transmission, and oral instructions are we fullyable to benefit from the tantric path. In fact, it is said that, without theblessing of a realized master, the practice of tantra is likely to do more harmthan good. Still, if practiced correctly, these teachings have the potential totransform your being into the state of complete awakening in a short time spanand through only little hardship. Such is the power of the tantric path. Itherefore sincerely request all readers to study these texts under the guidanceof a genuine master of the lineage.May the precious wisdom of the practice lineage spread and flourish throughoutthe world and may this publication be a positive circumstance for that. In thisway, may all sentient beings quickly traverse the path of the four knowledgeholders and awaken to the full and complete enlightenment of the four bodies andfive wisdoms.TRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTIONimage [images/00004.jpg] OVER THE LAST forty years Buddhism has spread to all corners of the world. Inthis process, Tibetan Buddhism has often been represented in ways that play intoour need to re-enchant an increasingly materialistic world with the magic,drama, and supernatural elements of a lost wisdom nurtured in isolation on theroof of the world. For this approach to Buddhism, the development stage, withits attention to colorful deities, magical mantras, and exotic rituals, hasbecome a popular form of practice. Deity practice is ripe with evocative andinspiring imagery that seems a perfect cure for our weariness and disenchantmentwith the ordinary world. And these practices, which today are performed atnumerous Dharma centers around the world, do undeniably help build communitiesand provide devotees with a ritual register and a sense of belonging. Still, inrecent years, it has become clear to many Western practitioners of TibetanBuddhism that the development stage is a much richer practice than what firstmeets the eye.To fully appreciate the depth of development stage practice it is important tostudy the works of the lineage masters, in particular the texts that apply theoften detailed and complicated tantric theory directly to practical experiencein clear, concise, and practical statements. Recently we have been fortunatethat an increasing number of such texts have been made available in translation.As these texts now become available to the Western world, one may hope that theywill provide a foundation through which the practice of the development stage inthe West can develop and grow in a way that is suited to the Western mind, yetremain faithful to its Indian and Tibetan origins. If we are able to appreciatethe richness and depth of the tradition beyond simply a superficial fascinationwith a curious cultural phenomenon, we may be better suited to assimilate thecrucial aspects of the tradition rather than latching on to the mere outercharacteristics of such practices. Perhaps this could be one way to challengeour fondness for spiritual materialism that Chögyam Trungpa so kindly pointedout?The translations found in this volume are of texts written in Tibet during thenineteenth and twentieth centuries. The authors, Kunkyen Tenpe Nyima and ShechenGyaltsap, were masters who shined with their life examples on the very eve of amillennium of Buddhist practice in Tibet. Both masters inherited the fulltradition of Tantric Buddhism through the lineages of the famed wisdom teachersJigme Lingpa, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, and Jamgön Kongtrul. As such, both textsrepresent a summary of more than a thousand years of tantric practice thatpresent the highest insights of the tradition in a simple yet inspiring formatthat is excellently suited for the beginner as well as the advanced practitionerwhen traveling the path to the peak of human achievement.At this point in time, when the vast majority of this incredibly preciousTibetan Buddhist culture is threatened with extinction, it seems that texts suchas these are important to study. While we still have the precious fortune ofsharing this world with genuine wisdom masters, who embody the very pinnacle ofthe Buddhist path, we must therefore strive to receive their blessings andguidance. Only then can we assimilate the wisdom they brought with them as theirgift to the world when they fled the Chinese occupation. We therefore hope thatthis publication may be able to, in a small way, assist this process.KUNKYEN TENPE NYIMA AND The Compendium of Oral Instructions The colophon of The Compendium of Oral Instructions1 informs us that, at therequest of some of his devoted students, the author, Kunkyen Tenpe Nyima,gathered the instructions from the recitation manuals of various accomplishedmasters and from his own guru.Although The Compendium is a practice manual on development stage widely used byfollowers of the Nyingma School, authorial attribution of this text has turnedout to be a complex matter with several options and opinions. Several masters bythe name Tenpe Nyima flourished in nineteenth-century East Tibet and we havebeen unable to settle the matter definitively. However, based on advice by thelate Gene Smith and colophonic information in one of the manuscripts, we haveattributed this text to a certain Khartrul Kunkyen Tenpe Nyima (Mkhar sprul kunmkhyan bstan pa’i nyi ma, nineteenth cent.).His brief biography is found in a collection of hagiographies of tantricpractitioners from the far eastern province of Rebkong.2 The biography isconcise and very little is said about the actual life of Tenpe Nyima. What wecan glean from his hagiography is that he was a master from Rebkong who wasregarded as the reincarnation of the eighth-century Indian scholar Śāntarakṣita.Tenpe Nyima belonged to the Longchen Nyingthig tradition that his father hadtransmitted to him. His father, Chöying Thobden Dorje, was a close student ofthe first Dodrubchen, Jigme Trinley Öser, the heart son of Jigme Lingpa, and hisassociation with this lineage was therefore obvious. Institutionally, TenpeNyima was associated with Dzogchen Namgyal Ling, the monastery founded by hisfather. His date of birth is not mentioned, but his hagiography states that hewas born shortly after his father founded Dzogchen Namgyal Ling in 1818.From his father he received empowerments and instructions on the general sūtrasand tantras and, in particular, on the Longchen Nyingthig He also received infull the transmission of the volumes of scriptures composed by his father, suchas the Treasury of Sūtras and Tantras, and put them into practice. Eventually heattained realization, perfected his training, and was empowered as a Great Lordof the Dharma. Then, we are told, in accordance with their individual potential,he established countless disciples on the path of ripening and liberationthrough offering them mind training, advice, empowerments, guidance, andpointingout instructions. In this way, he engaged in activities of inconceivablekindness.The Compendium is a guidance manual that describes the different types of ritualactivities associated with the practice of the development stage, pertainingparticularly to the Treasure lineage of the Nyingma School.This text explains the general structure of deity practice in the mahāyogatradition, without focusing on any particular sādhana. It belongs to a class ofTibetan literature called “notes” (zin bris), consisting of a series ofannotations, written down by the author for his own purpose based on the oralinstructions of his guru and later compiled for the benefit of others. Thesetexts are usually very practical in their intent. This is clearly the case forThe Compendium of Oral Instructions, and in fact one recension of our textcontains additional notes apparently added by a later unidentified author, butwe have not translated those here. Tenpe Nyima’s text explains extensively thedifferent stages—preliminaries, visualization, recitation of the mantra,meditative absorption, and subsequent practices—that must be covered in deityyoga, emphasizing always their concrete application within the context ofretreat practice.The ritual activities explained in The Compendium follow a uniform structurethat can be applied to any particular Nyingma sādhana. The unique features ofthis text are the detailed technical explanations and advice given by the authorfor each particular step of the practice. The structure of the text follows theusual sequence found in other revealed mahāyoga sādhanas.Each stage of deity practice, with its liturgies, visualizations, practicearticles, and so forth, is thus described in exhaustive detail and is alwaysaccompanied by precise and useful practical advice. The clarity of itsexplanations, its abundance of technical advice, and its emphasis resolutelyplaced on practical application make The Compendium of Oral Instructions anideal companion for the practitioners of deity yoga, particularly in the contextof a retreat.SHECHEN GYALTSAP AND Illuminating Jewel Mirror Shechen Gyaltsap Pema Namgyal (1871–1926) was born in the middle of the excitingrenaissance in Tibetan spiritual culture that took place during the latter halfof the nineteenth century. At that time Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892) andJamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye (1813–1899) had begun promoting the nonsectarianmovement through their extensive activities and oeuvres, while Patrul ChökyiWangpo (1808–1887) and Ju Mipham (1846–1912) were spearheading a revival ofpractice and study within the Nyingma School. Each of these masters was, inturn, to act as a mentor to the young child who was prophetically identified asthe reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje (nineteenth cent.), the third regentof Shechen Monastery in eastern Tibet.Educated in his early years largely by his uncle, Lama Kyiyang, and later byTroshul Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso, he eventually took monastic ordination underthe famous preceptor of Dzogchen Monastery, Khenpo Pema Benza, who gave him thename Gyurme Pema Namgyal. His two primary teachers, though, were, above all,Khyentse and Kongtrul. Based on their instructions and empowerments, and bytransmitting their major works to him, they fostered him as a torchbearer oftheir spiritual insight. Moreover, they played a critical role in guiding himduring a major turning point that occurred in his life at the age of twenty. Atthat time, during a pilgrimage throughout all Tibet, he underwent a spiritualtransformation whereby, to use Dilgo Khyentse’s words, the “knot of hope andfear snapped all by itself.” This led him to lose interest in worldly affairs,even institutional monasticism. Under the counsel of his two teachers, he thenstepped aside from the everyday management of Shechen Monastery to live the lifeof a carefree vagabond.Traveling to meet the great visionaries of his day, it seems he was a perpetualstudent. From Patrul he received teachings on The Way of the Bodhisattva duringthe course of which Patrul is said to have spontaneously waved his hand througha solid pillar. Journeying to Karmo Taktsang, he received from Miphamtransmission and instruction on several of his major works, in particular hisfamous Abhidharma compendium, Gateway to Knowledge, and his commentary on theEight Sādhana Teachings. He also is said to have sought guidance, again andagain, from Mipham on his inner realization until their minds becameinseparable.At the same time, however, it seems he lived his entire life in seclusion,engrossed in contemplation and meditation. His main personal deity wasapparently a form of Vajrakīlaya known as “Innermost Razor of Kīlaya,” which hepracticed for at least three months each year. In the biography that DilgoKhyentse composed about his teacher,3 he recounts how miraculous signs appearedeven the first time Shechen Gyaltsap practiced the Innermost Razor of Kīlaya inretreat. The story goes that, while carrying out the recitation, one day a packof “iron wolves” gathered around Shechen Gyaltsap’s retreat house, even on itsroof, howling and trying to find a way in. Despite this terrifying turn ofevents, Shechen Gyaltsap simply supplicated his master and performed thepractice of “mingling their minds into one,” thereby pacifying the frighteningdevelopment, although this subjugation took several days! Through the power ofthis he displayed the signs of accomplishment in the practice after only onehundred days, although it was predicted to take three years. At this time he isalso said to have left a footprint in solid rock, which another lama (namedBarchung) insistently prodded him to finally admit.While living mostly as a hermit spending his time in meditation practice, henonetheless somehow also found time to author an immense thirteen-volume corpusof texts spanning topics from grammar, astrology, and poetics to a wide range oftreatises on Buddhist philosophy, ritual, and practice. Last, but not the least,he nurtured the next generation of budding luminaries, acting as teacher to theremarkable reincarnations of his own teachers—Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö(1893–1959), Shechen Kongtrul (1901–1960), and Dilgo Khyentse (1910–1991)—aswell as many other highly regarded scholar-practitioners, such as Khenpo Kunpal(1872–1943) and Khenpo Nuden (nineteenth/twentieth cent.).All of this he accomplished despite passing away at the young age of fifty-five.In the last year of his life, 1926, perhaps in foresight of his passing, hepitched a tent on the hillside above Shechen where he proceeded to grantaudiences to all of his students, monks, and patrons. There he stayed whileperforming ceremonies and giving his last counsel until one day, just before hispassing, he was visited by the heir to Shechen, a weeping young Rabjam Tulku, towhom he bestowed an unspoken, symbolic final teaching by simply pointing to hisheart.Composed in the latter part of his life, it seems that Shechen Gyaltsap intendedIlluminating Jewel Mirror4 to be a general guidebook for development stagepractitioners of any particular yidam deity. In that way it serves the purposeof tying together the features of all sādhanas, thus highlighting theiruniversal functions and meaning.Structurally, after enumerating in detail the prerequisites for engaging insādhana practice, the text follows the standard framework of most sādhanamanuals. Shechen Gyaltsap weaves in, however, another thread in the introductorydiscussions that he uses to string together all the manifold elements of thiscomplex practice. This is the fourfold scheme of the “basis, object, process,and result of purification.” In the introductory section he characterizes thefirst—the ground for the development stage transformations—as “true reality,suchness, or the essence of the bliss-gone.” The latter three aspects then serveas a refrain that repeats at every step as the basis for Shechen Gyaltsap’scommentary, presenting a rich portrait of the way in which the elaboratedevelopment stage visualizations transform the various stages of birth, death,and rebirth into a set of corresponding events in the process of spiritualawakening. In part, these descriptions inform the student about how theseemingly esoteric images and themes of Tantric Buddhism have a deep foundationin Great Vehicle Buddhism. They also, however, highlight the unique, paradoxicalvision of the Vajra Vehicle, which states that we are actually already divine,enlightened beings. In this vision, the lavish and colorful worlds thepractitioner “imagines” are actually more real than his or her ordinaryexperience, and serve as methods to lead him or her closer to the way thingsactually are.ABOUT THE TRANSLATIONS It was Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche who first suggested that we translate theseprecious texts, as he found them to be particularly relevant and helpful forpractitioners of Tibetan Buddhism today.A group consisting of Benjamin Collet-Cassart, Cortland Dahl, Catherine Dalton,Andreas Doctor, and James Gentry translated The Compendium. The individualmanuscripts were then compiled, compared against the Tibetan, and edited byCortland Dahl. Zachary Beer translated Illuminating Jewel Mirror, while AndreasDoctor compared the translation against the Tibetan and edited the text. GrahamSunstein and Shenpen Lhamo also looked through the manuscript and offeredhelpful advice.Along the way we received much help and guidance from a number of learned andrealized masters. Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche guided our translation work by givinginstruction on the “enlightened mind” section of Illuminating Jewel Mirror andoffering numerous teachings on the general themes of the development stage andthe importance of bringing the teachings into direct daily experience. DzigarKongtrul Rinpoche kindly took the time to clarify the meaning of the morecomplex development stage passages of Illuminating Jewel Mirror.Khenpo Tashi Palden, or Kyabje Khenpo as he is also known by his students, gavethe full reading transmission of The Compendium together with a brief commentaryon the full text and elucidated some of the more vexing passages. Kyabje Khenpohimself received the transmission in his youth from the renowned master JamyangKhyentse Chökyi Lodrö (1893–1959), and later from both Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche(1910–1991) and Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche (1920–1996).Beyond these, many other teachers from Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling Monastery offeredtheir wisdom and patience in helping to unravel the profound and oftenmysterious world of development stage practice for us. In particular, we wouldlike to thank Lama Tenzin Sangpo, Tulku Jampal Dorje, Lama Tsultrim Sangpo,Khenpo Sherab Dorje, Trokpa Tulku, Tulku Pasang Tsering, and Lama Kunga Sangpofor assisting with guidance on numerous complicated passages. We are thereforeindebted to these kind teachers, without whom it would have been impossible totranslate these texts.We are also grateful to the Tsadra Foundation for generously sponsoring thetranslation of this book. The vision of Tsadra is truly remarkable and thefoundation’s impact on the survival of Tibetan Buddhism is a source of continualjoy for us. We also wish to thank Snow Lion for publishing this book and fortheir hard work in bringing the Buddhist classics to the West.We sincerely apologize for any mistakes these translations may contain. They areexclusively our own due to our limited understanding of the profound nature oftantra. Lastly, we dedicate whatever goodness may result from this publicationto the benefit of all sentient beings and to the long life of Chökyi NyimaRinpoche and all other wisdom teachers. 1.

For countless disciples who fill the furthest reaches of spaceYou make the nectar of the definitive secret shower down like a rain of DharmaFrom the cloud banks of your tremendous compassion—I bow down to you, omniscient father and son, and the masters of your lineage. By unfolding the wings of the two stages—The union of means and knowledge of the swift path, the vajra essence of thesupreme vehicle—I will now set forth a banquet for those fortunate onesWho wish to swiftly arrive at the kingdom of the four bodies. Utilizing the profound practice of the two stages on the direct path of thevajra vehicle of Secret Mantra allows you to actualize the level of a vajraholder in this very lifetime. Those suitable individuals who wish to reach thislevel should begin their practice by earnestly arousing renunciation through themind training of the common preliminary practices and engendering the preciousmind of awakening. Next, they should receive the four empowerments in full froma qualified master, cultivate faith, and abide by the samaya vows. Those whohave done so may enter this path. This discussion consists of three main topics: (1) the preparation, (2) the mainpractice, and (3) the concluding activities.THE PREPARATION The Bright Effulgence states: > First, find the right place and time,> And gather supportive conditions and the articles for your practice.> Then, in the interim, practice secretly. Concerning the appropriate location for practice, beginners must stay far awayfrom places that are filled with diversions, busyness, and distraction, as wellas those that elicit attachment and aversion. The Questions of Adhyasaya Sūtrainstructs: > It is best to travel one hundred leagues> From places where you have responsibilities or find disputes.> Do not stay a single instant in places> Where afflictive emotions are present. It is said that in monastic centers where the saṅgha quarrels past virtue willdecline and not develop in the future, and the earth will be scorched down toseven layers so that every good thing pertaining to the environment and itsinhabitants will decline. In particular, neither signs of fruition nor positivequalities will manifest from practice in such places. You should thereforeabandon these places. The Ornament of the Sūtras states that a place of practice should have fivequalities: > The place where a wise person practices> Should have readily available goods> And be in a wholesome environment and healthy location> With good companions and positive qualities. It is taught in The Wheel of Time Root Tantra: > A yogi should practice well in a place> Where the ruler is faithful to the Dharma,> Where all beings live in constant harmony> And without dispute. As stated here, in general you should practice in a place where there is amonarch devout to the Dharma, where the local lay people engage in wholesome,virtuous actions, and where there are no enemies, thieves, or disputes. Morespecifically, The Tantra of the Layered Lotus Stems explains: > It is extremely important> For any general or specific places—> Sacred locations, countries, or places where the Victorious One came—> To be auspicious and agreeable to the mind. Sacred locations and lands imbued with blessings, as well as places where theGreat Master of Uḍḍiyāna and other accomplished masters of the past practiced,are highly praised. The Condensed Realization states: > It is easier to gain accomplishment by practicing one day> In such places than by practicing for a year in ordinary places. More specifically, it is also said that places for practice should have certaingeomantic features, such as particular shapes and colors of the sky and theearth that are in accord with each of the four activities. If you cannot arrangesuch locations, Resting in Meditation explains: > In summary, a place that is delightful at first but later becomes unpleasant> is a place of less spiritual accomplishment. A place that is initially> frightening and unpleasant yet later becomes delightful is a place filled with> great blessings, where you will attain spiritual accomplishments quickly and> without obstacles. Apart from those, all others are neutral, without> particular benefit or harm. This passage explains that you should practice in a place that you finddelightful, once you have gotten used to it, and which has no impediments tomeditative concentration. It is important to stay in secluded and delightfulplaces that agree with your mind. The Condensed Realization states: > If it agrees with your mind, even a city is a suitable place. The Condensed Tantra also mentions: > You should practice wherever your mind is content, O Lord of Men. Sitting on> your soft bedding and cushion, observe your mantra recitation. Concerning the appropriate time to practice, The Tantra of the Layered LotusStems states: > The waxing period of the first month of each of the four seasons> Causes auspiciousness and excellence to manifest.> On a full moon, new moon, and on the eighth day of the lunar month> Practice flourishes, together with good omens. These days are propitious times for great accomplishment. Moreover, it states: > During the king of constellations and so forth your wishes are fulfilled.> The waxing period of the planets and the moon . . . A tantra explains: > Undertake activities on the eighth day of the waxing period of the moon.> Engage in the vast conduct of enlightenment during the great king of> constellations.> In order to attain the secret and supreme spiritual accomplishments swiftly,> Practice when the planets and stars are in an auspicious configuration. Although those with confidence in nonconceptuality do not make distinctions interms of place and time, it is said that for beginners it will generateextraordinary results to practice when the dates and positions of the planetsand stars form an auspicious connection that accords with the four activities.The Awesome Flash of Lightning comments: > Excellent conditions and time are indeed conceptual thoughts,> But due to them the signs and marks> Of spiritual accomplishments occur. Whatever the case, gradually gather as much virtuous supportive strength as youcan by ransoming the lives of animals, freeing fish, restoring dangerous paths,making figurines and tormas, performing the four hundred offerings and makingother offerings, or reading the words of the Buddha, such as the Five SūtraCollections or a condensed version of them. In particular, engage in wrathfulfire offerings and other such rituals. You should also bring together all thatyou need, including practice companions, provisions, and practice articles. Youcan learn more details on how to perform these activities from scriptures suchas The Treasury of Oral Instructions.Next, clean your place and display representations of enlightened body, speech,and mind if you have them. Place the offerings in the correct order, arrangingthem beautifully and in an attractive way. When you look at them, you shouldfeel at ease and sense their blessings. If the place is new to you, you need aritual to consecrate the land, which includes self-visualization in itspreliminaries. If it is an old place, this is not necessary. Outside, in anunsheltered area, visualize the spirits of the eight classes in general, and theearth lords of the ground and other such spirits in particular, and give themwhatever elaborate or simplified offering you can, such as the Great Offering ofAll Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa, the Three-Part Torma Offering, the Offering to theEight Classes of Spirits, smoke offerings, and so forth. Doing so, urge them toact as allies in your practice. At this point, you can also expel obstructingforces, establish a boundary, and set up the guardian kings’ poles.Facing the maṇḍala, draw clockwise-swastikas with white grains or white chalkbeneath your seat. If you want to take a more elaborate approach, spread kushaor durva grass on the ground, with the roots turned outward and the tips turnedinward, and place your cushion on top of them. It is also explained that it isgood to have the back of your seat slightly elevated.In this context, the importance of making tormas and other offerings with purematerials and substances and arranging them beautifully is taught. The tormasshould be made from select portions of excellent ingredients. These ingredientsmust not be obtained through wrong livelihood, or be of inferior quality, stale,and so forth; they must be ritually pure. With these ingredients, begin bymixing a small amount of the three white substances and make small offeringtormas for the deities. For the torma dough, mix nectarlike medicinal powder,made by someone free from samaya breaches, together with beer, the three whitesubstances, and the three types of sweets. Corresponding to the amount of foodyou have, make the torma with the quality of sādhana tormas stipulated by thetext you are using. You may then paint it either maroon or white, whichever isappropriate.Whatever the torma’s shape, its corners should not point toward you and itshould be adorned with various types of butter adornments and foodstuffs. Aparasol of a matching color should also cover it, and to its right and leftthere should be nectar and rakta, along with their respective substances. Whenyou find the right occasion, you may also include any appropriate tormas, suchas those for oath-bound protectors, Dharma protectors, treasure guardians, andlocal deities, as well as the articles for feast offerings and so forth.If you are inclined to include dhāraṇīs in the tormas, draw the root mantra ofthe main deity and its retinue on Chinese paper with saffron or vermilion ink,followed by the sky treasury mantra. Next, write a supplication to the assemblyof the noble deities and their retinue to grant you the supreme and mundanespiritual accomplishments. Finally, draw the Ye-dharma dhāraṇī one time.Starting at the beginning of the mantra, roll the paper such that the lettersare turned inward. Wrap it in brocade of the same color as the deity and,without turning the mantra upside down, insert it into a bamboo shaft or coppercontainer and then into the torma itself.If you want to take a more elaborate approach, visualize the shrine torma as thedeity and maintain the visualization for as long as you render offerings to it.The perpetual torma is kept for a specific duration of months or years. Thesādhana torma, also called the offering torma, is offered and received by thedeities as a gift. As a means to delight them, mending tormas serve as anoffering substance symbolizing sense pleasures and enjoyments. The capturedtorma is kept until an activity is accomplished, after which it is to beoffered. The purpose of this torma is to ensure that an activity is accomplishedswiftly and without delay. The session torma, also called the daily torma, isgiven occasionally in order to enjoin certain temporary activities. A simplerenunciant practitioner may also make these tormas using simply the bestportions of his or her own food and drink.You should also know that tormas can be viewed in a threefold or fourfoldmanner, depending on the context in which they are used. The CondensedRealization states: > A torma can represent four things:> At the time of receiving the blessings and empowerments,> It is visualized as the guru, yidam, ḍākinī, and so forth.> Those who desire the spiritual accomplishments> View it as the nectar from which every desired manifestation appears.> When destroying the activities of the obstructing spirits,> It is visualized as sharp weapons.> During the supreme and mundane mending rituals,> It is visualized as the individual mending substances—> The offering clouds of sense pleasures and enjoyments.> Know that a torma can perform these different functions. The same applies in the context of sādhana practice. The Key of the CrucialInstructions of the Eight Sādhanas teaches: > In terms of practice, torma can be understood in four different ways:> The great baliṃta torma can be understood> As an offering, as the deity,> As armies, and as magical weapons. While practicing a ritual text, the torma can be viewed as an offering. Duringexorcising rituals, the torma can be viewed as the deity. During covenantrituals, the torma can be viewed as an army. During the throwing ritual, imaginethe wisdom being of the torma dissolving into yourself. Viewing the samaya beingof the torma as weapons, fireballs, poisonous vapor, molten bronze, and othersuch things, you then visualize all demons, together with their dwelling placesand strongholds, dwelling within the fire and throw the torma into it.You should also know that, for those of superior faculties, on the outer leveleverything is an inexhaustible adornment torma. The world is the torma vesseland the beings are the torma ingredients. On the inner level the aggregates arethe torma vessel and the flesh and bones are the torma ingredients. On thesecret level, the emptiness of inherent nature is the torma vessel andappearances are the torma itself.In terms of presentation, in front of the representations and on the upper levelof a two-tiered covered stand, set out medicine, nectar, torma, and the practicearticles on top of grain heaps, following the instructions of the text you areusing. On the lower level, arrange the five sense enjoyments in a row, precededby the two types of water offering. For the practice of approach these offeringswill suffice. The outer offerings are transformed by chanting “argham . . .”These are referred to as “circumstantial offerings” in the detailed commentaryof The Clear Realization.To the north of the land of Uḍḍiyāna, on the slopes of the Glorious Mountain,water possessing eight special qualities is found. It is clean and free from anyimpurity, clear and unsullied, cool and aromatic, smooth and free from defect,sweet smelling and fragrant, delicious and of supreme flavor, fulfilling andrejuvenating, and delightful and healthy. It is taught that this water resemblesthat which is diligently prepared as an offering at the time of great Dharmafestivals.Jigme Lingpa elaborates: > The offering substances represent the aspect of skillful means, appearances,> and bliss. They are not of the highest type. The recipients of the offering,> the victorious ones and their heirs, represent the aspect of knowledge and> complete liberation. It is advisable to start presenting the offerings from> the left side, the side of knowledge. Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche explains further: > Whether during self- or frontal visualization, the female deities have their> face turned towards the recipients of the offerings. Therefore, start the> offerings from the left side of these offering recipients. And Lingtrul teaches that: > For peaceful offerings made during self-visualization, you should begin> offerings from the left side of the offering torma. Nevertheless, followers of the New Schools and the majority of those in our owntradition also teach that offerings must begin from the right to left for bothself- and frontal visualizations since the head of the row occupies that side.During frontal visualization, when approach and accomplishment are practicedtogether, you can place a real or painted maṇḍala, or else just heaps of grains,in front or behind the offerings of the self-visualization, whichever is themost convenient.First, arrange the practice materials according to the instructions found in thetext you are using and then begin the peaceful offerings with flowers in thenortheast. This serves to prevent the influence of obstructing forces. Next,place drinking water in the east, bathing water in the southeast, and theremaining offerings clockwise in a circular manner.When wrathful offerings are called for, place the following wrathful offeringsin a counterclockwise circle. From the west, set out blood as drinking water inthe southwest—the cannibal island—followed by poisonous water for bathing, sensefaculties as flowers, human flesh as incense, human fat as a butter lamp, bileas scented water, and flesh and bones as food offerings. It is also said thatpeaceful offerings should be arranged in rows and wrathful offerings in acircle. Surround these offerings with all the individual ornaments you have,place them on a tigerskin and so forth. As a convenient alternative, place thepeaceful offerings in a row starting from the right side of the frontalvisualization and the wrathful offerings in a row starting from the left side.Between these rows place the daily tormas.Do not carelessly mix the outer with inner offerings, such as nectar and rakta.The Great Master of Uḍḍiyāna said: > In short, you should understand that no fault entails if the light rays of> lower offerings strike the higher offerings, but if the light rays of the> higher offerings strike the lower offerings, those who like common offerings,> such as water, will not receive them. It is also said that obstructing spirits will enter the tormas and offerings ifthey are not consecrated as soon as they are displayed. Therefore, perform abrief consecration by sprinkling them with pure water.THE COMMON PRELIMINARIES Next, according to how much free time you have, train in the preliminaries foran appropriate number of days. The path of liberation is rooted in the genuineattitude of renunciation, while the four mind-changings are the method thatengenders this attitude. The path of the Great Vehicle is rooted in the preciousmind of awakening, while the four immeasurables are the method that engendersthis mindset. When these trainings have transformed your mind and conviction hasarisen within you, focus on the practices of going for refuge, generating themind of awakening, and reciting the seven-branch prayer. In particular,concentrate on the meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva to purify theobscurations, on the maṇḍala offering to gather the accumulations, and on guruyoga to receive the guru’s blessings.Before you begin your practice in the afternoon and evening sessions, cleanseyour mouth with water from the vase and sit in this purified state. Next, exhalethe stale breath, rest your body and mind in their natural state, and refreshyour motivation. Imagine a blue HŪṂ syllable in your heart as the essence of theinnate awakened mind. Light radiates out from this syllable, invoking from thenatural abode the essence of your root guru in the form of the deity of anyclass of tantra: the principal figures, the three jewels, the gurus of thelineage, ḍākinīs, and Dharma protectors surrounded by all the objects of refugewithout exception. Visualize them all gathered in the space before you, likecloud banks in the sky.Imagine yourself going for refuge, over and over, together with all sentientbeings. Doing so with your body, speech, and mind is the relative act of goingfor refuge. The ultimate act of going for refuge is to take refuge in the dharmabody, the inconceivable true nature of reality in which the objects of refugeare inseparable from your own mind. This is the wisdom of the empty essence. Theenjoyment body is the luminous nature, while the emanation body is unifiedcompassion. Directing your attention to the inherent presence of the threebodies is the ultimate act of going for refuge.The relative mind of awakening involves thinking, “I will practice this profoundpath to establish all sentient beings in the state of complete enlightenment.”The ultimate mind of awakening involves resting evenly in the true naturewherein nothing ultimately exists. Relatively speaking, however, the true naturecan manifest as anything. This is the state in which emptiness and dependentarising are inseparable. Apply yourself earnestly as prescribed here. Furtherdetails about these practices, including the acts of going for refuge andgenerating the mind of awakening, may be learned from other sources.Since the entire range of the methods for accumulating, purifying, andincreasing is contained in the seven-branch prayer, train in gathering theaccumulations. To conclude, dissolve the field of accumulation into yourself andthen rest for a moment in the state wherein your minds mingle inseparably. Moreelaborately, you can consecrate the vajra, bell, purifying water, and otherarticles at this point, following the instructions of other texts.THE UNIQUE PRELIMINARIES EXPELLING OBSTRUCTORS Next, go outside and, while visualizing yourself as a deity, present a whitetorma and request supportive activity. In front of your doorway, place the tormafor the obstructing forces adorned with flesh, blood, garlic, onions, and soforth.With the pride and overwhelming, radiant confidence that comes from visualizingyourself as a wrathful protector deity, such as the heruka Hayagrīva, focus onthe torma and utter the three syllables. The syllable OṂ cleanses and purifiesall impure defilements. The syllable ĀḤ multiplies the substance such that itincreases and expands infinitely. The syllable HŪṂ transforms it into sublimesense pleasures that manifest as precisely whatever one desires. Finally, thesyllable HOḤ consecrates the torma by transforming it into the nectar ofundefiled wisdom.Next, imagine countless wrathful Ṭakkirājas emanating from your heart center.They are pink in color and have one face and two arms. Brandishing hammers intheir right hands and hooks in their left, they summon into your presence allthe mischievous spirits, obstructing forces, and elemental spirits, all of whomare powerless to disobey you. Issue your command to these beings, then offerthem a torma and send them off to their respective dwellings. Visualize that allthose who ignore your command and set out to make obstacles are, in a singleinstant, threatened, chased away, and crushed by wrathful weapons and powerfulflaming rays. As you imagine all this, recite the verses for expellingobstructing forces from your sādhana, burn some resin incense, throw wrathfulmantras and charmed substances, and seal your practice by remaining free ofreference point.DRAWING THE BOUNDARY Following this, write down the name mantras of the Four Great Kings along withrequests addressed to them. Place these on a small altar composed of piled-upwhite stones, which can be situated either seventy steps away from the placewhere you are practicing or beside your door. Once this is done, visualize thatthe Great Kings are mobilized and dissolve into the altar, then presentofferings, praise, and request their protective activity. Imagine that the FourKings oversee the periphery with delight, and that the entire surroundingsbecome completely covered by a protective dome. This is the establishment of theouter boundary. In the context of approach, practices such as subjugating samayademons and sealing your door are not necessary; these elements are necessaryonly in the context of the great accomplishment.Next, come back inside, close your door, and abandon distractions andwanderings. For the inner boundary, visualize the entire base of the protectiondome as a ground composed of vajras and the entire upper part as a vajra domeand canopy. Completely surrounding this, in both the cardinal and intermediatedirections, is a vast, spacious, and elevated circular vajra fence. The fence isdevoid of gaps; instead, every opening is patched by small conjoined vajras thatseem melded together. The exterior is covered by a lattice which is completelybound by crossed-vajra cords. The top of the dome is covered by half-vajra tipsand the midsection braced by strings of vajras. The whole dome is blue and isshaped like a helmet. Wisdom fire of five colors radiates out from this dome,spreading in all directions. Some systems describe the shape of the dome aseither oval or spherical, but they all come down to the same essential meaning:the fact that there are no open spaces anywhere within the vast and spaciousprotection dome. The dome is surrounded by various kinds of small wrathfulemanations and weapons, which amass like rainclouds. These, in turn, arethemselves surrounded by three successive domes of fire, water, and wind.5[CR%210YBEZ33SMH6V78ZMKH21Q0PWCEWC_split_002.html#filepos389549]Alternatively, in the limitless expanse of space and amid a blazing mass offire, visualize a ten-spoked wheel with a rim and hub emanating out from thesyllable BHRŪṂ. Its center is vast and spacious, while its spokes are asfar-reaching as the basic space of phenomena. Between the ten inner spokes, onseats made of lotus, moon, and sun discs, visualize ten wrathful emanationsemerging from ten HŪṂ syllables.Other visualizations may also be taught at this point, such as visualizing thedeity Uṣṇīṣacakravartin as the vast and spacious belly of Vairocana in the innerempty part of the protective dome, but it suffices to follow the instructionsthat are mentioned in each sādhana ritual.Thus, having established a boundary with the protective dome, imagine that alldemons and treacherous spirits are prevented from approaching, while you and allthose in need of protection are safe inside. As you imagine all this, chant theverses for establishing the boundary. This comprises the inner boundary.Concerning the secret boundary, Commentary on the Secret Essence states: > Subdue the king of demons, discursive thoughts,> With the king of boundaries, nonconceptual wisdom. Within the state of innate luminosity, which has never been tainted by thedualistic delusion of a perceiver and perceived, seal your practice by seeingthe lack of inherent nature of all the demons, obstructing forces, andadventitious conceptual imputations. This constitutes the extraordinaryprotective dome. Sealing the practice nonconceptually, in this way, establishesthe secret boundary.If you will need to meet someone during your retreat, visualize that personincluded within the protective dome. Do not come into contact with anyone else,and stop engaging in any material exchange with the outside world. Do notdissolve this protective dome until the last session at the end of the retreat,and visualize it at the beginning of each practice session. There are alsopractice traditions whereby other activities may be performed at this point,such as arranging offerings, accumulating merit, and purifying the obscurations.To summarize, from the establishment of the inner boundary onwards you mustmaintain the physical retreat of not seeing other people, the verbal retreat ofrefraining from ordinary communication, and the mental retreat of not gettingcaught up in negative thought patterns associated with the afflictions, such asattachment and aversion. At the same time, you must also maintain mindfulness,introspection, and attention. For your virtuous endeavors to be effective, youshould practice in four sessions: at dawn, in the morning, in the afternoon, andin the evening.SHOWER OF BLESSINGS For the shower of blessings to take place, with fervent devotion visualizeyourself as the deity and imagine rays of light emanating from your heartcenter. Accompany this with specially prepared incense, melodious chanting, andmusic. In this way, invoke the assembly of deities of the three roots. From thenatural expanse imagine all their blessings of wisdom, love, and ability, aswell as their spiritual accomplishments, in the form of rays of light,rainbow-hued clouds, flowers, spheres of light, and so forth. Their enlightenedbodies appear as divine forms, their enlightened speech as seed syllables, andtheir enlightened minds as symbolic implements. Imagine that all of thesedissolve into you, your dwelling place, and all the ritual articles, endowingyou with the nourishing power of glorious, great wisdom.For those of superior faculties, whenever any perception of the six collectionsof consciousness arises, the knot of perceiver and perceivedvanishes—self-liberated from the moment it manifests. Through this, whateverappears arises as the outer, inner, and secret offering clouds. This is thedescent of blessings of the great wisdom of infinite purity.CONSECRATING THE OFFERING ARTICLES According to the sūtras, the vehicle of characteristics, the actual offeringsare consecrated and emanated through the recitation of dhāraṇī mantras,knowledge mantras, the power of devotion, and the power of truth. In the mantravehicle, however, they are consecrated by five practices: going for refuge,deity, mantra, meditative absorption, and mudrā. With this in mind, visualizeyourself as the deity and imagine the syllables RAṂ, YAṂ, and KHAṂ emanatingfrom your heart center.Transforming respectively into wisdom fire, wind, and water, they incinerate,scatter, and wash away all the impure stains, faults, and defects of believingthat the offering articles are real, until nothing remains. From the state ofemptiness the syllable BHRŪṂ then appears and transforms into a vast, open jewelvessel. Within this vessel the syllable OṂ gives rise to the flowers of divinesubstances and the rest of the five common outer offerings, to the unique innerofferings, including the self-arisen flowers of the five sense faculties, to thewrathful offerings of the charnel grounds, and so forth. Every desirable thingthroughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is present, without anything missing. Imaginethat clouds of countless offering goddesses, each carrying her own individualoffering, radiate out from each of these offerings and fill the entirety ofspace.THE INNER OFFERINGS OF MEDICINE, RAKTA, AND TORMA For the inner offering of medicine, visualize wind, fire, and a tripod made froma human skull arising from the syllables YAṂ, RAṂ, and KHAṂ. On top of thetripod a vast open skull cup, containing the five meats and the five nectars,emerges from the syllable ĀḤ or the syllable BHRŪṂ. Human flesh and excrementare in the middle of this skull cup, cow meat and semen in the east, dog meatand brain in the south, horse meat and menses in the west, and elephant meat andurine in the north. Next, visualize the syllables HRĪḤ and BAṂ, TRĀṂ and MAṂ, OṂand MUṂ, and ĀḤ and TĀṂ above each of their respective offering substances.These syllables then transform into the male and female buddhas of the fivefamilies.6 [CR%210YBEZ33SMH6V78ZMKH21Q0PWCEWC_split_002.html#filepos389913] Astream of red and white bodhicitta then flows from the place where the male andfemale deities unite and fills the skull cup. At the conclusion of this process,the deities melt into light and dissolve into the offering substances. Imaginethat this becomes a swirling ocean of wisdom nectar, and that sense pleasuregoddesses emanate from each of its droplets. The Condensed Realization states: > The skull cup is heated by blazing fire stirred by the wind from below.> Rays of light, from the vapor of the boiling articles, spread in the ten> directions.> They summon the wisdom nectar, which dissolves in the skull cup.> The deities, sacred substances, and wisdom nectar> Mingle indivisibly, swirling white and red.> For deities the nectar becomes pleasing and appeasing articles.> For spiritual companions the nectar is an elixir of spiritual accomplishments.> For enemies it becomes a dangerous weapon.> For obstructing forces it becomes a charmed substance that pulverizes them.> Envision it as nectar that meets the needs of whomever it comes into contact> with. For the inner offering of rakta, atop the wind, fire, and skull stand describedabove, visualize a vast, open vessel made from a fresh skull with the hairsstill on it. Next, imagine that all the concepts of craving and attachmentrelated to the three realms coalesce within it in the form of blood. In themiddle of this swirling blood visualize the rakta goddess Gitima. Red and naked,she holds a knife and a skull cup. From her bhaga, a stream of rakta flows down,mingling inseparably with the substances of the skull cup and filling itcompletely. Finally, the goddess melts into light and dissolves into thearticles. This creates surging waves within the ocean of rakta, which isessentially detached great bliss, and causes clouds of sense pleasures toemanate forth.For the inner offering of torma, visualize a vast, open skull cup or jewelvessel. Within this vessel is a torma made of various foods, a divine nectarendowed with a hundred flavors and an inexhaustible treasure made of a mass ofdesirable things. Imagine that countless clouds of offering goddesses emanatefrom the torma, each carrying delightful and appeasing offering articles for allthe outer, inner, and secret guests.Everything up to this point concerns the stages of the common and uniquepreliminaries.THE MAIN PRACTICE This section consists of (1) an abridged teaching on the general meaning and (2)an elaborate explanation of the meaning of the scripture.AN ABRIDGED TEACHING ON THE GENERAL MEANING This section covers (1) the intent of the individual classes of tantra, (2) thedeity meditation as applied to the purification of habitual tendencies of thefour types of birth, and (3) how deity meditation can be practiced in relationto the varying capacities of individuals.THE INTENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES OF TANTRA A tantra explains: > All skillful practitioners> Who aspire to the completion stage> Should practice the development stage, starting with the foundation. The Instructions of the Lord of Secrets states: > In short, the development stage involves transforming all impure appearances> into pure appearances and meditating on the maṇḍala circle. The completion> stage involves meditating conceptually on the channels, winds, and essences in> order to realize the wisdom of empty bliss and meditating nonconceptually on> the absorption of the true nature. The first of these two, the development stage, can be divided into three types:(1) the illusory development stage, in which you realize that objectiveappearances are not real, (2) the profound development stage, in which thesemanifest spontaneously as empty appearances, and (3) the emanated developmentstage, which refers to the divine form with faces, hands, etc. Here I shalldiscuss the development stage from the perspective of the last of these threeapproaches.The defining characteristic of the development stage is to give rise to thedivine form of empty appearance using concepts and fabrications concomitant withblissful melting. Furthermore, the development stage has four unique qualities,as described by the saint Kunga Nyingpo in the following passage: > Its unique rituals are the complete development stage rituals taught in the> tantras. Its unique result is the capacity to develop the power of mantra. Its> unique essence is the nature of emptiness and blissful melting. Its unique> function is the completion of purification, perfection, and maturation. In Resting in the Nature of Mind Longchenpa explains the three outer classes oftantra in the following way: > In action tantra the practitioner is seen as inferior and the deity as> supreme;> You receive the spiritual accomplishments of practice> In the manner of a master and a servant. > In performance tantra the practitioner and the deity are seen as equals;> With the wisdom deity before you as the samaya being,> You receive spiritual accomplishments as though from a friend. > In practice tantra the two are indivisible during the main practice,> Yet in the preparatory and concluding stages they are two, as the deity is> invoked and later departs.> The spiritual accomplishments are received nondually, like water poured into> water. As outlined here, in action tantra generally the practitioner does not imaginehimself as the deity. However, in particular instances, the deity, or the wisdombeing, is regarded as a king and you, the samaya being, regard yourself as hissubject. With this approach you emphasize acts of ritual purity and other outeractions through which you receive the spiritual accomplishments. The Tantra ofReceiving the Spiritual Accomplishments of All Buddha Families explains asfollows: > Looking at the body of the king, your master,> And thinking of yourself as a servant,> Accomplish the mantra and receive the most supreme—> The essence of spiritual accomplishment. In performance tantra the view is the same as in practice tantra while theconduct is the same as in action tantra. Here you receive the spiritualaccomplishments as though you and the deity are siblings or friends. This occursthrough a state of equality between you as the practitioner, visualized as thesamaya being, and the wisdom deity that you have visualized in front ofyourself. The General Tantra of the Three Families mentions this: > The sacred spiritual accomplishments should be received> As though from a sibling or a friend. In practice tantra you meditate on yourself as the deity and, by invoking anddissolving the wisdom deity, you and the wisdom deity become indivisible. At theconclusion of performing offerings, praise, and recitations, you receive thespiritual accomplishments and the deity is requested to depart. The VajraElement states: > The nondual expanse of reality> And receipt of the highest, sacred spiritual accomplishment . . . The meditations of the three inner tantras are also described in Resting in theNature of Mind: > Mahā stresses the energies, the development stage, and skillful means.> Anu emphasizes the elements, the completion stage, and knowledge.> Ati highlights that everything is nondual wisdom.> All three practice with the knowledge> That all phenomena are primordial equality. In mahāyoga the emphasis is on gradually developing the maṇḍala based on thethree samādhis, whereby you meditate on the indivisibility of the deity andconcept. In anuyoga it is held that all phenomena are, by their very nature,indivisible from the three maṇḍalas, and that the root maṇḍala of the awakenedmind is primordially enlightened. As such, the form of the deity emerges as anexpression of the unceasing play of Samantabhadra. The Magical Key to theTreasury explains: > The anuyoga of completion holds that> The aggregates, elements, and sense sources> Are not developed, but perfect> As the maṇḍala of male and female deities. And also: > In the vehicle of anuyoga,> By merely expressing the essence,> You meditate on the deity, which is perfected without being developed. The Compendium teaches: > Within the primordial openness of the great perfection, Samantabhadra,> The outer, inner, and secret maṇḍalas are arranged. According to atiyoga the spontaneously present appearances of the DirectCrossing manifest from the primordial pure basic space of the Thorough Cut asthe gathering of divine forms. These forms are the expression of awareness, thenatural manifestation of unceasing dependent arising. In this way the mindfocuses on the vivid appearance of the thoroughly established deity of greatpurity and equality. This accords with the approach of most of the practicemanuals in the tradition of the key instructions of the heart essence.The difference between the outer and inner tantras is also described in TheCondensed Realization: > In the outer tantras the deities are either male or female> And the completion stage relates to syllables or essences.> In the inner tantras the deities are joined in union> And the completion stage is the Great Seal. > In terms of ornaments, deities of the outer tantras have jewel crowns,> While in the inner tantras they wear bone ornaments and other such things.> In the outer tantras you offer the three white substances,> Whereas in the inner tantras the five meats and five nectars are offered. > In the outer tantras you use a jewel vessel,> While a kapāla is used in the inner tantras.> Tormas, fire offerings, consecration, clay statues, and vase rituals> Are common to the outer and inner tantras alike. DEITY MEDITATION AND THE FOUR TYPES OF BIRTH The appearances of the various phenomena of saṃsāra manifest in dependence uponour having taken birth within existence. For this reason, the primary elementsof saṃsāra are the four types of birth. To purify the habitual tendenciesassociated with these four types of birth, four corresponding styles ofdevelopment stage meditation are taught. A tantra explains: > To purify the four types of birth> There are four types of development:> The very elaborate, the elaborate,> The simple, and the completely simple.The Very Elaborate Development Stage First we will examine the very extensive development stage that purifies eggbirth. The following accords with the process of being born from an egg, whichtakes place in two stages. Begin by taking refuge and giving rise to theawakened mind. Next, visualize yourself instantly as the primary male and femaleconsorts and invite the deities of the maṇḍala into the space before you. Afterpresenting offerings, praise, supplications, daily confessions, and so on,gradually dissolve the visualization and rest evenly in emptiness for a moment.The unique feature of this approach is to first visualize in a concise mannerand then in an extensive manner according to the systems of your own childrenand another’s child. The Eight Great Sādhana Teachings mention this process: > There are five steps involved in making others your child: (1) the primary> male and female consorts are generated from the seed syllable; (2) the buddhas> of the ten directions are invoked and dissolve into the space of the female> consort; (3) sentient beings are summoned and their obscurations purified;> (4) the greatness of nonduality is developed; and (5) the deities are evoked> from space and established upon their seats.> Making yourself the child of another has eight parts: (1) the primary male and> female consorts dissolve into light and transform into the seed syllable;> (2) the male and female consorts develop fully from this seed syllable;> (3) the male consort’s conceptuality transforms into syllables; (4) light> emanates from the female consort and supplicates the deity; (5) all maṇḍalas> dissolve into you, arousing divine pride; (6) the male and female consorts> join and the maṇḍala is generated in space; (7) your forty-two concepts are> visualized as deities and projected externally; and (8) the deities are bound> and sealed with the four seals. As outlined here, since you yourself are a thus-gone one at the time of theground, the thus-gone ones are transformed into your children. And to ensurethat the potential of the thus-gone ones does not decline, you become the childof others. This is how the great Rongzom explained it. He also taught that whenyou meditate on these practices there is no fixed progression.The Elaborate Development Stage Next we will examine the intermediate development stage that purifies wombbirth. This stage involves three approaches. First, the condensed approach, theritual of the three vajras, which accords with father tantra. Its objects ofpurification are (1) the intermediate existence, (2) the fetus, and (3) birth.The process of purification involves meditating on the features of the symbolicimplements, such as the five-spoked vajra. This, in turn, purifies the mind (theobject of purification), transforming it into vajra mind. The symbolicimplements are then transformed into, or visualized as being marked by, a HŪṂ oranother such syllable. This perfects your speech into enlightened speech. Next,light radiates out from this seed syllable and is then reabsorbed, performingthe twofold benefit. Finally, the symbolic implement undergoes a fundamentaltransformation into the complete form of the deity, along with its ornaments andapparel. This ripens the ordinary body into the enlightened body.Next is the medium-length ritual, the four manifestations of enlightenment,which corresponds to mother tantra. The Galpo Tantra describes this as follows: > First, emptiness and the mind of awakening.> Second, the occurrence of the seed.> Third, the complete form.> Fourth, setting out the syllable. Here the corresponding objects of purification are (1) the death state and theintermediate stage, (2) a disembodied consciousness coalescing with the semenand ovum, (3) the gradual formation of the body through the ten winds, and (4)the faculties engaging with objects subsequent to birth.Lastly, the extensive ritual, the five manifestations of enlightenment. Here therespective objects of purification are (1) the intermediate state consciousness,(2) the moment before consciousness enters the womb, (3) entry into the womb,(4) the ten months of physical development in the womb, and (5) birth.These five can be applied to the five paths. The process of purification for thefirst three is the three samādhis. The process of purification for the fourth isthe five manifestations of enlightenment. The Hevajra Tantra explains: > The moon is mirrorlike wisdom,> The seven of seven, equality.> Discernment is said to be the deity’s> Seed syllable and symbolic implements.> All becoming one is perseverance itself,> And perfection, the pure expanse of reality. The process of purification for the fifth element begins with visualizing divineappearance (the support and the supported of the Great Seal) and extendsthroughout the four aspects of approach and accomplishment that contain theinstructions on the “four stakes that bind the life force” all the way up to theritual’s dissolution stage.The Simple Development Stage The condensed development stage ritual purifies the habitual tendenciesconnected with birth from heat and moisture. In this approach the object ofpurification is the completion of a body that emerges from heat and moisture.The process of purification involves visualizing the transformation of the seedsyllable, which rests upon layered sun and moon discs, into the complete form ofthe deity.The Completely Simple Development Stage The extremely concise development stage ritual purifies the habitual tendenciesassociated with miraculous birth. Here the deity is instantaneously visualizedmerely by uttering the essential syllable. On this topic The Tantra of theNatural Arising of Awareness states: > What is instantaneous practice?> The deity is not developed, but perfected by recalling its essence. In this way an individual of the highest caliber can visualize the primordialdeity, the essence of mind, recalling it perfectly in a single moment, just asthough he or she were seeing a reflection in a mirror.Of these four types of birth, womb birth and egg birth are purified using themahāyoga approach, while birth from heat and moisture is purified with theanuyoga approach and miraculous birth is purified using the atiyoga approach.When practicing these approaches, the existence that resembles cyclic existenceis cleansed and purified, while the fruition that resembles passing beyondsuffering is perfected in the ground. Both of these features will mature you forthe completion stage. This is the general understanding.Generally speaking, for those who begin these practices, these four approaches,with their varying levels of complexity, are primarily taught as specific waysto purify each of the four types of birth. In reality, however, there is nodifference in terms of the degree of purification achieved by these fourapproaches.DEITY MEDITATION AND THE VARIOUS TYPES OF PRACTITIONER The Condensed Realization explains: > Practitioners of superior capacity understand that utterly pure> simplicity—which is unfabricated, naturally occurring, spontaneously present,> and primordially clear—is the essence of the deity. Practitioners of moderate> capacity understand that the self-existing expression of unfabricated and> nonconceptual compassion is the brilliant deity of the pure channels.> Practitioners of the lowest capacity practice within the nonconceptual state> where all forms are male and female deities. In this way the deities manifest> like fish jumping from a lake. With pure faith and samaya vows intact, the> deity is clearly visualized through the five manifestations of enlightenment> and the three samādhis. According to The Tantra of the Layered Lotus Stems, each of these threecategories can be divided into three subcategories, for a total of ninedivisions. Such variations may be learned from their respective sources.THE ELABORATE EXPLANATION OF THE SCRIPTURE’S MEANING This section consists of (1) the practice of equipoise and (2) the practice ofthe ensuing attainment.THE PRACTICE OF EQUIPOISE The practice of equipoise has three divisions: (1) the visualization practice ofenlightened body, (2) the recitation practice of enlightened speech, and (3) theluminosity practice of enlightened mind.Enlightened Body There are five subdivisions in this section: (1) the framework of the threesamādhis, (2) visualizing the maṇḍalas of the support and the supported, (3)invoking the wisdom beings and requesting them to remain, (4) the activities ofhomage, offering, and praise, and (5) focusing on the deity’s appearance, theprimary focal point.The Framework of the Three Samādhis The system of developing the visualization by means of the three samādhis issomething that is found in mahāyoga and the other inner tantras.The Samādhi of SuchnessFirst, relax your mind and do not chase after any confused thoughts. Then let gofor a moment, and rest in the simplicity of reality—the state of empty awarenessthat transcends words and concepts. This is the samādhi of suchness, also knownas “the practice of great emptiness,” “the vajralike absorption,” and “theabsorption of emptiness.” This samādhi eliminates the extreme of permanence andpurifies the habitual tendencies associated with the formless realm. It alsopurifies the death state into the dharma body. Hence, this is classified as theessence of awareness, the inconceivable aspect. In this context, you restwithout visualizing the protection dome and the other elements outlined above.However, you must understand that they are not entirely absent either.The Samādhi of Total IlluminationOut of this state of emptiness, meditate for a brief moment with nonreferentialillusory compassion towards all sentient beings who do not realize their ownin-dwelling wisdom. This is the samādhi of total illumination. The practice ofillusory compassion is also known as “the absorption of the heroic gait” and“the absorption of wishlessness.” It eliminates the extreme of nihilism andpurifies the habitual tendencies connected to the form realm. It also transformsexistence in the intermediate state and perfects it into the enjoyment body.Hence, this samādhi is classified as the radiance of awareness, the aspect ofthe unobstructed nature of compassion.The Causal SamādhiOnce compassion has stirred the mind out of this nonconceptual state, theessence of your mind assumes the form of a seed syllable, such as a HŪṂ or aHRĪḤ, which manifests brilliantly in the unsupported, empty expanse of space.Focusing on such a seed syllable is the causal samādhi, the training in thesubtle syllable that is one aspect of the single mudrā. The causal samādhi isalso known as “the illusory absorption” and “the absorption of nocharacteristics.” It purifies the view of a self and the stains of apprehendingcharacteristics. It also purifies the habitual tendencies connected to thedesire realm, thereby ripening birth into the emanation body. It is thereforeclassified as the expression of awareness, the aspect that manifests as objects.Here meditating on the assembly of deities connected with the support and thesupported constitutes the training in the coarse divine form, while meditatingin a more elaborate way with companions, faces, hands, etc. constitutes thetraining in the elaborate mudrā. These are the four practices of the path ofaccumulation. The states of the four knowledge holders are then graduallyattained in reliance on the proximate cause of the group practice that takesplace on the path of joining.In this context you will find the mantra OṂ SVABHĀVA ŚUDDHAḤ SARVADHARMĀḤSVABHĀVA ŚUDDHO’HAṂ. In reciting this mantra, you are saying, “Just as allphenomena are naturally pure, so too am I pure by nature,” which captures themeaning of the samādhi of suchness. The meaning of the mantra OṂ MAHĀ ŚŪNYATĀJÑĀNA VAJRA SVABHĀVĀTMAKO’HAṂ is “I am the very embodiment of the nature ofvajra wisdom and great emptiness.” In this mantra the phrase “great emptiness”refers to the samādhi of suchness, while the remainder refers to the samādhi oftotal illumination and the causal samādhi.The Maṇḍalas of the Support and the Supported Next you visualize the supportive celestial palace and the supported deities.The Supportive Celestial PalaceAs explained in the Appendix to the Recitation Manual of the Embodiment of theSugatas, begin by imagining that the syllables E, YAṂ, RAṂ, BAṂ, LAṂ, SUṂ, andBHRŪṂ emerge, one by one, within the space of a vast protective dome. Theyemerge from the previously visualized seed syllable of the causal samādhi. Theletter E completely purifies all clinging to reality and then transforms into ablue triangle of limitless size whose nature is the empty expanse of space.Above the upward-facing wide opening of this triangle is the syllable YAṂ, whichtransforms into a wind maṇḍala shaped like a dark-green cross rimmed withdark-green light. Above this cross the syllable RAṂ transforms into a firemaṇḍala shaped like a red triangle rimmed with red light. Above this, thesyllable BAṂ transforms into a white spherical water maṇḍala rimmed with whitelight. Further up, the syllable LAṂ becomes a golden ground shaped like a yellowsquare rimmed with yellow light. On top of the golden ground, the syllable SUṂtransforms into Mount Meru composed of four types of jewels and with fourterraces. Upon Mount Meru is a multicolored crossed-vajra in the center of whichis BHRŪṂ, the seed syllable of Uṣṇīṣacakravartin.This syllable then transforms into a square celestial palace of precious wisdom.To indicate that reality itself is free from elaborations, its center isspherical. Its four walls represent the four truths, and it is surrounded by agallery that represents the unity of the two truths. As a sign that each of thewisdoms is endowed with the four superior wisdoms through which the wishes ofthose to be tamed are fulfilled, beautiful bejeweled ledges with the colors ofthe four families jut out from the four walls.The four entryways, representing the four complete liberations, are accompaniedby beautiful porticos. To indicate traversing the eight vehicles, there are foursteps inside and outside of the doorways respectively—these are the eight causalarchitraves. As a sign that the qualities of the tenet systems of the vehiclesare perfected thereby, above the vestibules are ornaments called toraṇa. Theeight resultant architraves consist of the horse ankle, the lotus, the casket,the lattice, the cluster ornament, the garland, and the rainspout ledge, layeredone upon the other forming a sort of projected molding, the top of which isornamented with garuḍa heads.On top of each vestibule there is a Dharma wheel resting on a lotus andsurmounted by a parasol. Two deer sit beautifully next to each Dharma wheel, oneto each side. At the top of the five layers of the wall, which represent thedisplay of nondual wisdom, are jeweled hangings—pearl lattices and tasselssuspended from lion heads. Above these are jewel lattices and tasseled streamersof the top border. Facing outward from these are jewel rainspouts suspended fromthe eaves, above which is a parapet that ornaments the palace. Banners,parasols, victory banners, and so forth are displayed all around.Symbolizing that the sense pleasures are not abandoned, but arise as ornamentsof realization, many offering goddesses bearing aloft offering substances aregathered like clouds on the platform of delights that protrudes from the palace.Envision all of this as completely transparent and open. As a sign that thewisdom of the basic space of phenomena is limitless, the pinnacle of a heap ofjewels at the center of the roof is adorned with a jewel vajra top-ornament thatone never tires of beholding. Door ornaments, bells, silk streamers, trees, andevery other adornment also beautify the area. Encircling the outer enclosure arelotuses, along with charnel grounds encircled by vajra fences and blazingfires.7 [CR%210YBEZ33SMH6V78ZMKH21Q0PWCEWC_split_002.html#filepos390504]The specific characteristics of wrathful maṇḍalas are as follows. There is anocean of rakta, a ground of human skin, and Mount Meru, which is composed ofskeletons. On its summit is a multicolored crossed-vajra resting within a greatmass of wisdom fire. At the center of this crossed-vajra is a square celestialpalace with four doors. Its gallery is composed of either gold or blood,whichever is appropriate, and its walls are made of fresh, dry, and shriveledskulls that are nailed together with nails of meteoric iron and glued togetherwith blood. On top of the walls is a border of various types of skulls withgarlands of intestines and hearts. On the streamers of the top border arelattices and tassels made of snakes and garlands of skulls. The rainspouts aremade of hands and feet; the ledge is made of backbones and ribs; and the lowerpart of each door is made of turtles, with upper parts made of crocodiles. Thereare poisonous male vipers that constitute the planks on either side of the door,while the planks of the door itself are made of human skin. To the right andleft of the Dharma wheel are baby crocodiles resting atop the architraves. Abovethem are parasols made of human skin. The ceiling is also made of human skin.The central chamber has a skylight for the sun and the moon and is made of theoverturned skull of Mahādeva, which is surmounted with a top-ornament of aheart, and so forth.In the center, cardinal, and intermediate directions of the palace are the seatsfor the deities. As a sign of fulfilling the wishes of those to be tamed, thesethrones are made of precious jewels and are supported by fearless lions, mightyelephants, and so on. They are surmounted by jeweled lotuses, which symbolizebeing untainted by the flaws of saṃsāra. The anthers of the lotus are coveredwith the sun and moon discs of skillful means and knowledge. These and otherelements are included, depending on the context. Wrathful deities may be seatedon animals, Rudra, a corpse, lotus, sun and moon discs, and so forth. Theseaspects of the visualization should be spelled out in the text you are using. The Supported DeitiesThe Condensed Realization states: > Gradually generate the celestial palace from the outside.> Gradually generate the deities from the inside. As indicated here, to visualize the supported deities imagine that thepreviously visualized seed syllable descends onto the central seat. Thissyllable then either transforms into the complete main deity or into thesymbolic implement, held in the deity’s right hand, which is marked by thedeity’s life-force syllable. In the latter case, light radiates out from theimplement and is then absorbed back into it, accomplishing the twofold benefit.When the light is absorbed back in, the implement transforms into the form ofthe deity, complete with all of its ornaments and attire. You may then graduallyvisualize the main deities and their retinue in their entirety, as spelled outin the particular ritual text you are using.Next is the blessing of the three places. In the bone mansion at the crown ofthe main deity, as well as in those of all the deities of the retinue, imaginewhite OṂ syllables resting upon white discs. Red ĀḤ syllables rest upon redeight-petaled lotuses in the center of their throats. In their heart centersblue HŪṂ syllables rest upon sun discs in front of their hearts. Thus, thevisualized deities are sealed by clearly visualizing these three syllables asthe essence of vajra body, speech, and mind. In some contexts, you may imaginethat they are sealed by visualizing that the three syllables emit and absorblight and then transform into Vairocana, Amitābha, and Akṣobhya, each of whomwears enjoyment-body ornaments. You then recite mantras, perform the gestures ateach of your own three places, and generate the confidence of the three vajras.Next, for the bestowal of empowerment, light radiates out from the seed syllableat your heart center, or from the heart center of the wisdom being, and invitesall the sūgatas, in the form of male and female empowerment deities of the fivefamilies, to come from their natural abode. Joined in inseparable union, thefire of their passionate desire creates a stream of the five wisdoms, whichmelts and flows down onto the five places at your crown, conferring empowermentand purifying the stains of the five afflictions. The liquid that overflows fromthe top of your head transforms into a crown endowed with the adornments of thefive emanation-body families, with your own family in the position of the lord.By purifying the five aggregates, give rise to the confidence of the buddhas ofthe five families. Make the empowerment mudrās of the five families at each ofyour five places and recite the mantras for receiving empowerment. In somecases, blessing your three places or receiving empowerment may be unnecessary.There may also be other variations. Hence, practice as stipulated in the textyou are using.Invoking the Wisdom Beings and Requesting Them to Remain The InvocationFrom the letter HŪṂ at your heart center countless red light rays shine forth.These light rays, which are bent slightly inwards at the tip like hooks, invokethe assembly of deities, the maṇḍala of the victorious ones of the three rootswho abide in manifold buddhafields that pervade all of space. As the embodimentof the manifold aspect of the dharma body, the deities are invoked along withtheir retinues, which include the guardian deities and Dharma protectors.While not moving from the dharma body, imagine that the power of theircompassion arouses the display of the form bodies, which arrive immediately. Inthe same way that you must first send an invitation when requesting the presenceof a king in a worldly context, here the samaya being must show reverence andrespect to the wisdom maṇḍala as the object of veneration. In addition, if youpractice the deity yoga of the development stage with unshakable devotion, it isthe nature of things that the commitment of the host of deities of the threeroots will naturally be invoked and they will immediately come to the place ofdevotion where they are being visualized. For this reason, generate intensedevotion and recite the words of the invocation melodiously while playing musicand offering incense. With these words imagine countless wisdom beings identicalto the deities of the visualized maṇḍala—the supportive celestial palacetogether with its protective dome—along with whatever peaceful or wrathfuldeities are being invoked. Like snowflakes in a blizzard, they gather likeclouds in the space above the samaya maṇḍala, all the way out to the mountainsof flames. These wisdom beings represent a display of illusory wisdom and anoverwhelming mass of wisdom, love, and capacity.Alternatively, in some contexts it is taught that four mudrā goddesses areemanated from your heart as the samaya being. The Hook Goddess invokes thecommitment of the wisdom beings, the Noose Goddess invites them, the ShackleGoddess arouses them from their dwelling places, and the Bell Goddess delightsthem and invites them into the space in front of you.The Request to RemainAt this point you supplicate the entire wisdom maṇḍala to merge indivisibly withyourself as the samaya maṇḍala. Imagine that, with loving delight, the wisdommaṇḍala dissolves into you like snowflakes landing on a lake and mergesindivisibly with the samaya maṇḍala. On this point The Oral Instructions state:"},{"pageContent":" > The samaya being is the element of buddha nature itself, established as the> primordially pure maṇḍala of the deity, while the wisdom being is the body of> all buddhas. The primordial inseparability of these two is the meaning of the> inseparability of the samaya and wisdom beings. And Jigme Lingpa writes: > You must understand that the invocation, and so on, enable you to recall the> primordial indivisibility of the samaya and wisdom beings; it is not as though> you are placing one into the other. Moreover, Tsele Natsok Rangdrol explains: > When making the invocation, it is not as though something “other” is invoked> and then arrives from some other place. To purify impure deluded perception,> we do indeed recite words that invoke particular deities by name, mention the> places where they reside, and do other such things. Nevertheless, in fact> there is nowhere in the world of appearance and existence that is not pervaded> by the magical display of self-aware awakened mind. Since this is the case,> the innate awareness that is the samaya being is indivisible from the wisdom> being; these are not two different things. Thus, the wisdom being is invoked> as being indivisible from the samaya being. When you have not realized the primordial inseparability of the samaya being andthe wisdom being, you may bring this to mind through the mere symbolicinvocation and dissolution of the wisdom beings, which take place from theperspective of the way things appear in an unimpeded, illusory, and relativemanner.In this context we find the syllables DZAḤ HŪṂ BAṂ HOḤ. Imagine that the samayabeing uses the syllable DZAḤ to summon the wisdom being. With HŪṂ the wisdombeing dissolves indivisibly into the samaya being. The syllable BAṂ binds thewisdom being, compelling it to remain until your wishes are accomplished.Finally, with the syllable HOḤ the wisdom being joyfully remains. Thisstabilizes the indivisible blending of the samaya and wisdom beings.Homage, Offering, and Praise HomageUltimately, your mind and the deity are indivisible. Knowing this is the homageof meeting the view, and is the true homage. On a symbolic level, however, youstill recall the qualities of the deities and respectfully pay homage, makeofferings, and so forth in the following way. Just as the gods in the Realm ofEnjoying Emanations amuse themselves and partake of the sense pleasures thatthey themselves have emanated, here you imagine that four knowledge goddessesemerge from your heart center as the main deity. From the four gates theyexclaim, “ATIPŪ HOḤ,” and the deities of the maṇḍala respond, “PRATĪCCHAHOḤ.”The goddesses are then gathered back into your heart center.Alternatively, with a frontal visualization, the four emanated goddesses emergefrom the heart center of yourself (visualized as the deity) and then pay homageto the deity visualized in front of you. Meanwhile, four goddesses also emergefrom that deity’s heart center and offer homage back in response. To conclude,they are all gathered back into the heart centers from which they came. This ishow Jigme Lingpa explained it. Patrul Rinpoche teaches that paying homage cansimply mean showing humility and respect with your body, speech, and mind, andthat it is not necessary for there to be a particular object to which homage ispaid and one who pays homage, regarding these as two different things.The OfferingsThe Outer OfferingsFirst, to make the outer and inner general offerings imagine countless offeringgoddesses, in the form of the Vajra Lady and so forth, emanating from your heartcenter. Holding the seven enjoyments, the five sense pleasures, and otheroffering substances, they sing and dance. Each particle of the offering emanatesinconceivable clouds of desirable objects that please and satisfy the deities.More specifically, the offering goddesses offer drinking water endowed with theeight qualities to the deities’ mouths; clear, cool, and pleasing water torefresh their hands and feet; excellent garlands of divine flowers for theirheads; the scent of natural and produced fragrant incense for their noses;jewels, butter lamps, and other lights for their eyes; medicinal waters scentedwith sandalwood and saffron for the deities’ bodies; delicious and nutritiousfoods for their tongues; and the melodious sound of beautiful music that isblown, played, beaten, and so forth for their ears. To conclude, imagine thatthe goddesses dissolve into the very places to which they made offerings.Jigme Lingpa explains further: > In the context of offerings and praises, it is as if the deities are making> offerings and praises to themselves. This, however, is indeed suitable, as it> purifies impure worlds and beings into pure worlds and beings. When> transformed into the development stage of emanated pure realms and pure> beings, where would you find someone ordinary to make offerings, anyway? Alternatively, Patrul Rinpoche teaches that the offering goddesses who dwell onthe external foundation make the offerings. Either is acceptable, but it is goodto practice these approaches simultaneously.In the context of frontal visualizations, imagine that the goddesses dissolveinto all of the individual deities and then emerge from them as though beingborn. They then dissolve into your own places, bringing about the attainment ofspiritual accomplishments. This is taught in the tantras.Additionally, there are also beautifully arrayed offering substances; theofferings of absorption whereby the arrayed offerings are visualized and offeredas the offering clouds of Samantabhadra; the offering of melody whereby yourecite the verses of offering in a melodious manner; the offering of symbolicmudrā, meaning gestures that are respectfully offered by means of the “revolvinglotus”; and the offering of mantra, meaning ARGHAM and the other mantras of theoffering verses. Tingtrul Rinpoche teaches that those of superior faculties canemanate whatever they experience as great clouds of the treasury of space andoffer it as such.The Inner OfferingsMedicineThe inner offering of medicine is a samaya substance that is composed of eightprimary and one thousand subsidiary substances. It is derived from therealization that all phenomena are equal and are not to be accepted or rejected.As such, it is an elixir that dispels the demon of dualistic concepts. Thisunsurpassed great medicine has the nature of the four accomplishments and threeways of being.With the sun and moon sphere of your thumb and ring finger, respectively, scoopup the nectar and scatter it. Envision the droplets of nectar dissolving intothe mouths of the deities and satisfying them with the taste of great bliss. Youshould know the general and specific ways of rendering offerings. To conclude,once the nectar touches your own tongue and dissolves into the three places,imagine that you have received the accomplishments of enlightened body, speech,and mind.TormaVisualize a vast and open jewel vessel. Inside is a torma made of various typesof food and drink. Although it is made of all kinds of desirable objects, inessence this torma is wisdom nectar. Imagine that the deities imbibe and partakeof the torma with tongues that are hollow, made of light, and have the form ofthree-pronged vajras. This delights them. Next, imagine that countless tormagoddesses of the sense pleasures, having aroused delight in the deities,dissolve into you. In actuality, here the food of the five objects and the drinkof the five consciousnesses are enjoyed within the expanse of luminosity.RaktaHere you imagine the negative emotions, the root of the suffering of existence,coalescing in the form of blood. This is offered within the expanse of greatbliss, free from attachment, to liberate intractable beings through compassion.To this end, imagine that this blood is completely consumed and saṃsāra isliberated into unborn basic space.The Secret OfferingsThe Offering of UnionFirst is the offering of union. Subjective appearances correspond to themasculine principle of skillful means. In contrast, theobject—emptiness—corresponds to knowledge, the feminine principle. Theindivisible unity of these two is the great primordial union of everything.In the present context, the taste of great bliss that appears from this unionsatisfies the entire maṇḍala. This is symbolized by the male and female consortsbeing joined together as individual couples in union. Single female deities arealso joined in union with the symbolic form of the lord of the family, theconcealed masculine principle, which takes the form of a khaṭvāṅga. Through thisunion an extraordinary blissful melting occurs in which the descending flow andthe ascending stabilization are gradually perfected. Once the mind settles onthe wisdom of great bliss, all the deities give rise to the pride of beinginseparable from this passion.The Offering of LiberationSecond is the offering of liberation. That which is to be liberated here is thebelief in a self—the concepts associated with apprehended phenomena andapprehending thoughts. Insofar as this belief propels you into saṃsāra andprevents the realization of nondual wisdom, it is the enemy. Liberation isperformed with the weapon of wisdom devoid of dualistic thoughts. It liberatesdualistic fixation and desirous thoughts into unborn space. This is the meaningof the great primordial universal liberation.Generate great compassion from within that state so that you can free allsentient beings who are among the ten objects from the unbearable suffering thatresults from the negative karma they accumulate. In essence, just like a trickor an optical illusion, the self and that which is to be liberated do not trulyexist. With this realization you will free them and purify all your thoughtsinto the basic space of phenomena. Imagine that you perform this offering withinthe state of the single flavor of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.The Offering of RealitySince saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are primordially and spontaneously present as theinfinite purity of the great maṇḍala of the victorious ones, withoutconceptualizing the three spheres bring to mind the nature of the Great Seal andrest within that.PraisesHere praises are offerings of vajra songs. To offer praise, imagine thatgoddesses emanate from your heart center and devotedly call out melodiouspraises enumerating the ocean of qualities of the deities of the maṇḍala,including the inconceivable secrets of their complete liberation, enlightenedbody, speech, and mind; their spontaneously and effortlessly accomplishedenlightened activity, endowed with the five wisdoms and three bodies; the signsof the manifestation of the form bodies; and the strengths and other qualitiesthat embody their sublime abandonment and realization. These praises should beoffered with the knowledge that the object of praise and the one praising arebeyond meeting and parting.Alternatively, you may also imagine that Brahmā, Indra, and other great godsoffer praise from the courtyard surrounding the celestial palace. Jigme Lingpateaches: > Since the purpose of offering praise is to recall purity, you should be> certain of the fact that the deity does not exist in and of itself. In this and other contexts you will find many variations on the visualizationsand their order, yet these different approaches do not contradict one another.As Gotsangpa explains: > It is not the case that, having trained in one visualization, it is> unacceptable to then train in another. All of this is the display of your> mind. It is, however, unacceptable to be narrow-minded, thinking things like,> “This and that do not fit together.” This is the most important general point. Jigme Lingpa also notes: > Since this is the case, you will go astray if you harbor doubts about the> deity being a solid entity that can be touched and felt, and think that this> one and the other cannot fit together, or that having taken up one, you must> give up another. All such doubts are unnecessary! Training in the Appearance of the Main Deity This topic is divided into three sections: (1) vivid appearance, (2) stablepride, and (3) recollecting purity. Of these three, Getse Tulku explains thatyou should understand the first as the main explanation of the developmentstage, and the second two as subsidiary topics that will help you avoid what isunfavorable and accomplish what is favorable for the practice.Vivid AppearanceIn general, the matured practitioner should begin by placing offerings in frontof an authentic painting of the deity, crafted by a skilled artisan, and do thepreliminary practices in either an extensive or abbreviated form, whichever isappropriate. Then, as is taught in the Condensed Realization of the Gurus,visualize Guru Vajradhara—the embodiment of all refuge objects—above your head,seated on a lion throne on a lotus and on sun and moon discs. Filled withdevotion, offer your body and all your wealth and enjoyments to the guru. Thenoffer the following supplication with one-pointed concentration: “Essence of thebuddhas of the three times, truly kind precious root guru, I supplicate you.Please bless my mind, especially so that the genuine absorption of thedevelopment stage will arise in my being right now!” The guru then smilesjoyfully, melts into red light, and dissolves into your crown. Mingling yourmind inseparably with the guru’s, rest for a while in that state.Next, look at the image of the deity in front of you. Sometimes close your eyesand check if you can visualize the image just as clearly as when you see it.Once you are able to visualize the deity, even with your eyes closed, transferthe visualization to your own body. Work at familiarizing yourself with thevisualization by alternating between periods of meditating with your eyes openand closed. Having accustomed yourself to this practice, strengthen yourtraining by visualizing the deity as being either large or small, single ormultiple, by sometimes focusing on the main deity, then sometimes on theretinue, and so forth. Likewise, alternate between visualizing the entire bodyof the deity all at once and visualizing each individual aspect of the body andadornments one by one.At first keep your mind focused on the main deity alone, visualizing each andevery detail, from the top of the deity’s crown down to the lotus seat uponwhich he or she sits. Clearly visualize the color of the body, the face, hands,ornaments, garments, the pupils and whites of the eyes, the signs on the handsand feet, the appearance of the major and minor marks, the projection andabsorption of light, and so forth.The deity should not be flat like a wall painting or slightly protruding like arelief. In other words, it is neither a material entity nor insentient like arainbow. It should be clearly defined in every respect—its front and back, leftand right sides, proportions, and so forth. Yet, at the same time, it should bedevoid of internal organs or any sense of materiality. Train as though the deitywere actually present in the form of a body of light endowed with wisdom,knowledge, love, and capacity.Once you are able to focus your mind on the visualization, gradually bring forththe vivid appearance of the retinue, the palace, and the arrangement of thecelestial realm, all the way up to the protective dome. At times focus on thevisualization as a whole; at other times focus on specific details. Training inallowing the entire supportive and supported maṇḍala to arise clearly in yourmind is called “vivid appearance.” This is one of the primary functions of thedevelopment stage; it is a unique method that will allow you to practice calmabiding by focusing your mind on the deity. For this very reason it is importantto meditate by assiduously keeping your awareness on the vivid appearance of thedeity. As you grow accustomed to this, the five experiences will arise in turn.In this context, the specific details of the deity, such as its color andsymbolic implements, can be learned from the ritual text you are using. Here Iwill offer a few general observations. The Awesome Flash of Lightning states: > Each of their supreme forms> Possesses nine traits:> They are soft, well-proportioned,> Firm, supple, and youthful;> Clear, radiant, attractive,> And blazing with intense presence. These are the nine traits of peaceful deities. Their bodies are soft becausethey have purified pride. Having purified anger, their bodies arewell-proportioned. Having purified desire, their bodies are not loose, but firm.Having purified jealousy, their bodies are straight and supple. Having purifiedstupidity, their bodies are youthful. Having abandoned ignorance, their bodiesare clean and clear. Due to the blossoming of wisdom, their bodies are brightand radiant. Having perfected the major and minor marks, their bodies areresplendent, appealing, and, therefore, attractive. Having subjugated everythingthrough their great qualities, they are endowed with a great intense presence.The first five of these are the essential qualities, whereas the latter four areaspectual qualities.The deity should be seated within the expanse of clear and pure multicoloredlight that radiates out in the ten directions. As a sign of purifying thesuffering of the negative emotions of those to be tamed, the deity wears thefive silk Dharma robes made of celestial silk. As a sign of fulfilling thewishes of beings by not abandoning the sense pleasures but perfecting them as anornament, there are eight precious ornaments. Thus, the deity is adorned withthirteen ornaments.The five silken Dharma robes consist of a white silk shawl with goldenembroidery; a dhoti, which is a multicolored skirt; a yellow sash or Dharmarobe; a green dancing blouse that resembles a short-sleeved vest; multicoloredsilken streamers that are worn under the crown of the five families, and bluesilken ribbons that hang down from the back. In some cases the belt or Dharmarobe is omitted and the streamers and ribbons are counted separately.The eight ornaments are a jeweled crown, earrings, a short necklace, a belt,bracelets, anklets, a long necklace that reaches below the navel and is agarland composed of jewels, and a shorter necklace that reaches to the breast.Alternatively, symbolizing the seven branches of enlightenment, the deity wearsthe seven precious ornaments: a crown, a long necklace, bracelets, earrings, armbands, a medium-length necklace, and a flower garland.Wrathful deities display the nine expressions of the dance. The Heruka Galpostates: > Captivating, heroic, and terrifying,> Laughing, ferocious, and fearful,> Compassionate, intimidating, and tranquil:> Assume these nine expressions of dance. On this topic it is taught: > Their expression of desire should be captivating, their expression of anger> heroic, and their expression of stupidity terrifying. These are their three> physical expressions. They should be laughing out loud with expressions like> “ha ha” and “hee hee.” They should shout ferocious things like “Capture!> Strike!” They should also be fearsome, with a voice like the roaring of a> thousand rolls of thunder and a thousand bursts of lightning occurring in a> single instant. These are their three verbal expressions. They should also be> compassionate, taking ignorant beings and realms under their care;> intimidating, as they subdue barbaric sentient beings with their wrath; and> peaceful in the sense that they experience everything as having the same taste> within reality. These are their three mental expressions. These are the nine> expressions of the dance. With respect to ornamentation, the body of the Great Glorious One isprimordially and naturally adorned with the eight glorious ornaments. A tantraexplains: > His hair streaming upward is the ornament of reversing saṃsāra. His vajra> garuḍa wings are the ornament of means and knowledge. His violet vest is the> ornament of having overwhelmed permanence and nihilism. The half-vajra on the> crown of his head is the ornament of the family. His powerful rhinoceros-hide> armor is the ornament of blazing and increasing magnificence. Being joined in> indivisible union is the ornament of the wisdom consort. Being a hero, who> turns back all harmful forces, he is ornamented with iron. Burning up the> negative emotions, he is ornamented with the vajra fire. Otherwise, alternatively: > This can be presented in a slightly different manner:> Because Hayagrīva revels in the three realms,> His tiger skin shows his expansive heroic absorption.> A crossed iron vajra shows that he repels all harsh negative forces.> An entrusted vajra indicates his knowledge absorption.> His powerful red armor shows his majestic presence.> A black viper symbolizes his elegant heroic majesty.> His fangs of absorption show that he is the devourer of Īśvara.> His vajra robe indicates violet.> The skin of the fierce leopard shows his magnetizing strength. Thus, the ornaments are explained as the eight liberations.The eight charnel-ground ornaments are as follows. The three garments consist ofan upper garment of elephant skin that symbolizes having conquered stupidity bymeans of the ten strengths, a belt of human skin that symbolizes havingconquered desire through the awakened mind, and a tiger-skin skirt thatsymbolizes having conquered anger through heroic, fierce, and wrathfulactivities. He is thus liberated. The two fastened ornaments are as follows. Thesnake ornaments are the white hair-ribbon of the caste of nāga kings, the yellowearrings of the caste of nobles, the red short necklace and medium-lengthnecklace of the priestly caste, the green belt and long necklace of the commonercaste, and the black bracelet of the outcaste. The skull ornaments include acrown of five dry skulls, a long necklace of fifty fresh dripping heads, and thearmbands made of skull fragments. The three smeared substances are a mass ofhuman ashes smeared on the forehead, and drops of rakta on each cheek and on thetip of the nose. Alternatively, it is sometimes explained that there are dropsof rakta on the cheeks and forehead, a drop between the eyes, and grease smearedacross the throat. Adding the mass of wisdom fire and two vajra wings to theseeight, there are ten glorious ornaments in all.The light of the sun and moon, radiating from his left and right earrings, arethe two ornaments of clarity. The six bone-ornaments are a necklace,representing generosity; bracelets, representing discipline; earrings,representing patience; a wheel on the crown of the head, representing diligence(this is a thousand-spoked wheel at the center of which his hair is piled in atopknot); a belt, representing meditative concentration; and a long garlandcalled “held aloft to make offerings,” representing wisdom.The five bone-mudrās are these six, minus the long necklace. These represent thefive wisdoms.In the past, when Heruka liberated Rudra, he claimed Rudra’s wrathful ornamentsand wore them as a sign of his heroism. These have come to be known as the eightwrathful ornaments.It is generally taught that wrathful ornaments are not suitable for peacefuldeities, whereas peaceful ornaments are not disallowed for wrathful deities.However, although there may be slight variations in the color of the body andthe ornamentation of the deity in different ritual manuals, it is, in fact,suitable for the deity to appear in whatever way accords with the wishes ofthose to be tamed, as the compassion and activity of the deity know nolimitations. Therefore, though there is no contradiction here, it is importantto follow along with the context of whatever ritual text you are using.Also, here in the context of generating the deity, according to the Magical Webthe deity of each single mudrā has a wisdom being similar to itself, but withoutany ornamentation, at its heart, the deities of the five buddha families as acrown, and the blessing deities in its three places wearing the ornaments of theenjoyment body. When these nine subsidiary deities are added to the main deityitself, this makes ten deities in all. Alternatively, because the single lord ofthe family on the crown embodies them all, they are counted as one. In this casethe term “the body of the deity endowed with the five branches of mantra” isused.Looking at rituals from a general perspective, the presence of the five forms ofsuchness is referred to as “being endowed with the five branches of mantra.”These five are the suchness of the self (the self-visualization), the suchnessof the deity (the form of the deity visualized in front of oneself who isinvited, requested to remain, and so forth), the suchness of Secret Mantra, thesuchness of recitation, and the suchness of projection and absorption. Moreover,principally the vivid arising of the deity’s form is the radiance of theunfabricated basic nature. This apparent aspect is explained to be genuine vividappearance. That being the case, the celestial palace and its deities arisesolely from the great magical display of bliss, clarity, and emptiness—themagical display of the unimpeded wisdom of the main deity itself. Indeed, theyare not different from it. Like a rainbow arising in a clear sky or like theplanets and stars reflected in a limpid pond, your visualization appears but isnot truly established. Rest while keeping in mind the dependent arising of thisintrinsic nature, which can arise as any form whatsoever. This is taught to bean important point.Stable PrideThe deities, who are the objects of meditation, are not simply supports formental visualization; the appearance of the deity you meditate upon and you themeditator are not different. When you train without losing touch with thethought that you are the deity, this confident outlook will serve the uniquefunction of destroying self-grasping and preventing obstacles from taking hold.On this point The Condensed Realization explains: > There is no imputation> In equipoise or subsequent attainment.> To have stable pride is a vitally important point,> Though your visualization may be clear or unclear.> Think, “I am the deity,”> And do not hold on to your ordinary perceptions. While Tsele notes: > It is indispensable to know how the world and its contents> Are the primordially pure deity and mantra. And Resting in the Nature of Mind explains: > Your mind has been the nature of the deity from the start.> Your body is the maṇḍala; and sounds and words, Secret Mantra.> Within this great wisdom, where everything is spontaneously perfected,> The samaya and wisdom beings are indivisible.> There is no one to invite or who remains, nor is there any need to request> someone to leave.> Not good or bad, beyond accepting and rejecting, it has been the maṇḍala from> the very start.> In the visualization where you know this is its identity> You are not creating something that is not already there. As stated here, that which is to be purified is birth, death, and theintermediate state, as well as the subtle body, speech, and mind. The results ofpurification are the three bodies of the victorious ones. Once you have come todefinitively understand that the objects of purification have the nature of thethree vajras, and that they have been so from the very beginning, the temporarystains will be purified. The process of purification consists of the threesamādhis and stable pride, which involves sealing appearance, sound, andawareness with the play of deity, mantra, and wisdom, while never failing tobring the three aspects of clarity onto the path.Recollecting PuritySuch visualizations should not be clung to as true, as entities with their owncharacteristics. In actuality they are the self-appearances of the wisdommaṇḍala. As such they are devoid of the conceptual constructs of color, shape,face, hands, and the rest, yet the various attributes of the support andsupported do manifest as signs that symbolize the qualities of self-appearingbuddhahood to those who are to be tamed.The purity of the supportive celestial mansion was briefly described above. Whatfollows concerns the purity of the supported deity. As a symbol of all phenomenabeing one taste in suchness, deities have one face. Three faces symbolize thethree liberations, or the three bodies. Two hands symbolize means and knowledge,while four hands symbolize the four immeasurables. Six hands can symbolize thesix wisdoms (five wisdoms along with self-arisen wisdom) or the six perfections.Four legs symbolize the four means of magnetizing and two legs symbolize ethicaldiscipline and meditative absorption. The cross-legged position symbolizes theequality of existence and peace, while the standing position symbolizes beingunflagging in the service of beings. Three eyes symbolize seeing throughout thethree times and four fangs symbolize uprooting the four types of birth. Male andfemale consorts symbolize the union of means and knowledge.The nakedness of the female consort symbolizes the freedom from the overlay ofthe concepts connected with phenomenal characteristics. The consort beingsixteen years of age symbolizes her being endowed with the sixteen joyspertaining to immutable great bliss. Her flowing hair symbolizes the boundlessexpansion of wisdom from basic space. Union with her secret space represents thefusion of calm abiding and insight.In terms of the consort’s complexions, white symbolizes being unstained byblemishes, yellow represents the development of qualities, red symbolizes thewelling up of compassion, green indicates unobstructed activity, and blacksymbolizes the immutability of reality.The consort’s implements have symbolic values as well. The fivepronged vajrarepresents the five wisdoms. The wheel symbolizes cutting through the afflictiveemotions. The gem represents the source of desired qualities. The lotussymbolizes remaining untainted by shortcomings. The crossed-vajra representsmanifold unobstructed activities. The curved blade symbolizes severing allconcepts. The skull cup represents nourishing the bliss of nonconceptual wisdomwhile the blood it contains symbolizes destroying the four demons. The swordrepresents uprooting birth and death. The khaṭvāṅga staff symbolizes uprootingthe three poisons, and so forth.The purity of their adornments was described briefly above.The purity of appearance and existence as the individual divine maṇḍalas, inaccordance with the meanings of the symbols praised above and elsewhere, iscalled “the phenomenal purity of gods and goddesses.”When visualizing the sporting of male and female deities in union, or whenmeditating upon the union of the development and completion stages, a meresemblance of great bliss may manifest by penetrating the vital points of thebody during the completion stage, thereby sealing the development stage.Whatever the case, suffusing the development stage with the passion of greatbliss is the purity of self-aware great bliss.Sealing the illusionlike apparent aspect with the view of the freedom fromconceptual constructs is to meditate on the unity of appearance and emptiness.This is the purity of the suchness of reality itself.Jamyang Khyentse taught, “You are trained and habituated when the perception ofeach aspect of purity and its real meaning emerges naturally whenever the formof the deity is seen.” Beginners, however, are not able to do this. They adhereto a belief whereby they set up the visualization of the deity and then think,“These elements are the play of great wisdom, the enlightened mind ofbuddhahood, manifesting as symbols that represent the qualities ofenlightenment.” Adhering to this belief brings about an approximation of therecollection of purity and invites the pitfall of clinging to the deity asexisting in its own right.In summary, developing your training in the illusory play of empty appearance,wherein you do not veer from the nature of the dharma body even while appearingas the form bodies, is called “recollecting purity.”In all those contexts the development stage purifies clinging to ordinaryappearances and is the very goal of meditation while on the path. Thus, sincethe features of form, sound, smell, taste, and texture, manifesting as objectsof the five sense faculties, and the features of phenomena, manifesting asmental objects, constitute “appearances,” then visualizing such features as pureis taught to be what purifies them. Once the universe and its inhabitants arevisualized as a celestial mansion and deities, and sounds are naturallyperceived as mantra, the mind will no longer gravitate toward objects.“Clinging” is twofold: clinging to the self and clinging to things. The first ofthese, clinging to self, is the self-grasping that has occurred sincebeginningless time, whereby you think, “I.” Stable pride is taught to be theantidote to this form of clinging. With stable pride you cast off the clingingto the “I” or to the ordinary and stabilize a certainty whereby you think, “I amthe yidam deity.” Of clear visualization and stable pride, stable pride is moreimportant, for without the complete conviction that you are the deity your mindwill remain ordinary despite your clear visualization. This will render thepractice pointless. On the other hand, when you have the pride of thoroughlybelieving that you are the deity, self-grasping collapses and the vividappearance manifests automatically.In clinging to things you cling to the universe and its inhabitants, rigidlybelieving they are real and permanent. This is termed the “self of phenomena.”The recollection of purity is taught to be the antidote to this form ofclinging. Since celestial mansions, deities, and their faces and hands are onlysymbolic images for the nature of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment andthe like, which are the qualities present in the enlightened mind-streams ofbuddhas, the recollection of purity purifies the clinging that grasps things asbeing truly existent.Consequently, because this triad is crucial, train the mind by alternatingbetween them. These are not like the dialectical vehicle, whereby you behave asthough the object to be relinquished and its antidote are contradictory, as whenyou dissect objects into extremely subtle particles as the antidote toappearances or meditate on selflessness as the antidote to the self. On thecontrary, due to the superiority of the skillful means of Secret Mantra, just aswater stuck in the ear canal is flushed out by pouring in more water, and thepain from being burned by fire is treated with fire, the skillful means ofmantra recitation brings about the eradication of impure concepts by meditatingconceptually as the antidote to concepts—for example, developing divineappearances to remedy deluded appearances and developing divine pride to remedyselfish pride. This is why the development stage is called “skillful means.”While it is said that concepts and afflictive emotions need not be relinquished,this is the intended meaning. It must be understood that such statements do notmean that concepts and afflictive emotions of an ordinary nature are not to berelinquished.When meditating in this manner, your awareness may become unclear, or you maybecome lethargic and cloudy or lose your enthusiasm for meditation. If any ofthese occur, invigorate your awareness and expand the scope of your mind.Without confining your awareness to aspects such as the deity’s form,complexion, or symbolic implements, make the universe and its inhabitants, bynature, shine and shimmer as the deities, celestial palace, and light rays. Letsounds hum in the nature of mantra and thoughts settle in the nature ofsuchness. Sing a song of HŪṂ. Expand and elevate your awareness, slashing topieces the tangle of concepts. Meditate expansively and freely, relinquishingthe constrictions of worrying about whether the mind is resting or not, orwhether it is clear enough or not.Should your awareness become agitated and scattered, take a short break fromreciting approach mantras and the like. Expel the stale air, relax yourawareness, and gaze nakedly into your own nature. Within that state, yoke yourattention to the seed syllable, the life force of enlightened mind, and meditatewith your mind directed there. Do not be constricted by excessive expectationand worry about whether or not the visualization is clear enough, and the like.Yet do not be lax, just paying lip service without any real regard for whetherthe visualization is clear or not. Rather, find a balance between being tootight and too loose. From time to time turn inward and look into the face of thevery one who is engaged in deity meditation and who is concerned about theclarity of the visualization. Completely let go of any subtle concepts aboutthere being an object to look at, a looker, and so on, and maintain a state ofbare awareness, free of questioning or identifying.In that way, train in the stake of the unchanging realization of reality and thestake of absorption in the deity, alternating between the two or integratingthem according to whatever works best. In all of these contexts recite the basicapproach mantra—the stake of mantra recitation—unceasingly. Whenever you areabout to end a session or end an approach mantra recitation retreat, perform theprojection and absorption of light rays—the stake of the enlightened activity ofprojection and absorption—according to the approach mantra manuals. These “fourstakes that bind the life force” are the Dharma terminology of the Old School ofthe Early Translations. Patrul Rinpoche said that since this is a unique pithinstruction from the Second Buddha of Uḍḍiyāna, it is of the utmost importance.Likewise, it is said in a tantra: > A practitioner who possesses this stake can practice> An evil demon in a charnel ground, and still,> Whichever results he seeks, supreme or mundane,> Will automatically, spontaneously emerge.> Without realizing this stake, he will mistake the deity as concrete.> In that mindset he may practice a wisdom being,> And perhaps reach some temporary, trifling result,> But an authentic fruition will be nearly impossible. According to the Early Translation School this involves seven topics. There arethe five preliminary topics that elicit the five experiences. These are (1)focusing the mind on the deity; (2) correcting flaws that involve changes; (3)parting from the deity; (4) bringing the deity onto the path; and (5) mergingyour mind with the deity. There is also one topic that comprises the mainpractice: (6) connecting the deity with reality (where you train on the path ofthe four linked divisions of approach and accomplishment as induced bymeditative absorption) and another that is the concluding topic: (7) integratingthe deity onto the path (which consists of the ten things to understand, the sixsamaya vows, and so on).For the first stage you meditate on a complete visualization of the deity’sform, including its complexion, face, hands, adornments, and apparel, with thefive sensory gates withdrawn and without letting the mind become distractedelsewhere. When meditating in this manner it may seem as though the movement ofyour thoughts has become even more turbulent than before. This is the experienceof movement, which can be likened to how the movement of fish, otters, and othersuch creatures cannot be seen below a rushing waterfall, although even thetiniest pebble is visible below a gentle current. This marks the beginning ofthe mind becoming somewhat settled.Subsequently, as thoughts gradually still, the deity will manifest withbrilliant clarity. This is the experience of attainment.The second stage of meditation involves explicitly targeting whatever remainsunclear in one’s visualization, whether it is the deity’s body, complexion,face, hands, or otherwise, while at the same time not falling under the sway ofthe general or specific flaws. The general flaws are taught as follows: > The seven faults are (1) forgetting the focal point, (2) laziness, (3)> doubting your ability to succeed, (4) dullness, (5) agitation, (6)> overexertion (being dissatisfied, even though one’s visualization appears> clear), (7) underexertion (leaving the visualization unclear), and so forth. > There are also twelve flaws that involve fluctuations in the visualization:> (1) haziness, (2) vagueness, (3) shadowy darkness, (4) changes in size, (5)> changes in apparel, (6) changes in shape, (7) changes in number, (8) changes> in position, (9) appearing only as colors, (10) appearing only as shapes, (11)> gradual disappearance, and (12) incomplete appearance. The third stage involves alternating between sessions whereby you meditatediligently and without distraction by focusing the mind on the deity andsessions whereby you sustain the nature of things by looking into the verynature of the one who is meditating.The fourth stage involves the continuous manifestation of the deity’s appearancethrough meditating while altering the size, expressions, and other aspects ofthe deity. This is the riverlike experience of familiarity.The fifth stage involves not separating from the vivid appearance of the deity,whereby one settles into a state of meditative equipoise in which the deity thatone is meditating upon and the one who is meditating are nondual. This is themountainlike experience of stability. In this context there are four measures ofclarity. The deity should be clear, insofar as the apparent aspect of itsenlightened body is visualized in precise detail, down to the pupils of itseyes. The deity should appear lucidly present, rather than clouded by one’sexperience of dullness devoid of the crisp clarity of awareness. It shouldpossess the vitality of awareness, which is clear, empty, and vividly awake. Itshould be vibrant, since deities are not rainbowlike forms of lifeless matter,but are suffused with the wisdom of omniscience down to the very pores of theirbodies and the strands of hair on their heads. This, in turn, causes them tomanifest with brilliant presence, with hundreds of qualities, in conjunctionwith the sensory cognitions. Moreover, the deity should manifest vividly sincethe intellect cannot infer that such deities exist in a certain way. Rather,they manifest vividly as though they are directly present before the mind.There are also four measures of stability. Rather than being subject to ourforgetfulness, laziness, and so on, the visualization should remain unswayed bythe general flaws. It should also be unchanged by specific faults, likehaziness, vagueness, and the like. Moreover, once the visualization is clear,without even subtle concepts stirring, and not for just a short period, but whenyou rest in meditative equipoise day and night, it is totally unchanging.Complete malleability refers to one having gained mastery over each element ofthe meditation, be it the form of the deity’s body, its complexion, face, hands,or movements, the projection and absorption of light rays, and so on. Byunflaggingly meditating on these eight measures of clarity and stability,whatever appears dawns as the maṇḍala of the deity. This is the measure ofattaining complete stability, the experience of perfection, which is referred toas “the wheel of divine appearance.”The sixth stage involves training on the path linked with the “four divisions ofapproach and accomplishment” by means of the pith instructions of the “fourstakes that bind the life force” and in connection with the three meditativeabsorptions. The division of approach is the stake of absorption. The divisionof close approach is the stake of the essence mantra. The division ofaccomplishment is the stake of unchanging realization. The division of greataccomplishment is the stake of the activity of projection and absorption. Thefour stakes that bind the life force are referred to as such because they arelike stakes that bind all dualistic pairs into the singularity of nondualwisdom.The “stake of meditative absorption in the deity” involves fully performing allfacets of conferring empowerments, sealing, and the like while meditating, bymeans of the three meditative absorptions, on the universe and its inhabitantsas the illusionlike empty appearance of the divine maṇḍala. In terms of saṃsāra,this purifies and refines away the habitual patterns of the body as they relateto the four modes of birth. In terms of buddhahood, the fruition will beperfected in the ground. Here the fruition refers to the secret of enlightenedbody, which is beyond conceptual constructs yet appears as manifestations ofwhatever is needed to tame beings. In terms of the path, the pure element of thechannels will be refined into the deity. This, in turn, will mature you for thecompletion stage wherein the vital points of the vajra body are penetrated.The “stake of the essence mantra” is to perform recitation with the mind focusedon the absorption being, the life force of enlightened mind present in the formof a seed syllable in the heart of the wisdom being which is surrounded by themantra garland. In terms of saṃsāra, this purifies the habitual patterns ofdeluded speech. In terms of buddhahood, the fruition will be perfected in theground. Here the fruition is the secret of enlightened speech, which transcendssound and expression yet manifests as the inconceivable number of vehicles. Interms of the path, this stake refines the nature of verbal winds into theessence mantra. This, in turn, will mature you for the completion stage based onthe winds, as is taught in the father tantras.When meditating on any deity or mantra, the “stake of unchanging realization”refers to abiding in the dimension of suchness that transcends the intellect—alldivisive, dualistic clinging is primordially purified and perfected in the vajramaṇḍala of the basic space of purity and equality. In terms of saṃsāra, thispurifies negative mindsets, along with their habitual patterns. In terms ofbuddhahood, this perfects the fruition in ground. Here the fruition is thesecret vajra of enlightened mind, which transcends conception and expression yetis the inconceivable wisdom of omniscience. From the perspective of the path,you will gain familiarity with the reality of nondual appearance and emptiness.This, in turn, will mature you for meditation on the completion stage of bliss,clarity, and emptiness.The “stake of projection and absorption” involves achieving the twofold benefitby projecting infinite multicolored light rays from the deity’s body and mantragarland, while the entire universe and its inhabitants remain unwavered fromtheir nature of deity, mantra, and wisdom. Through this you will attain thesupreme accomplishment; provisionally, you will attain the fouractivities—pacifying through white light rays, enriching through yellow lightrays, and so forth—as well as the eight mundane accomplishments.From the perspective of saṃsāra, this cleanses away and purifies saṃsāricactivities associated with body, speech, and mind. From the perspective ofbuddhahood, the activities of all aspects of enlightened body, speech, and mindare perfected within the ground. From the perspective of the path, this willmature you for the common path with reference points and the realization ofwisdom without reference points, which purifies all that appears and exists intoa body of light.Here the stake of unchanging realization is the view and, hence, the ground. Thestake of absorption in the deity is meditation, as is the stake of the essencemantra. Indirectly, those two are also conduct and, hence, the path. The stakeof projection and absorption is the enactment of buddha activity beginning fromthe present. Hence, it is the fruition. Thus, since here you train on a path inwhich view, meditation, conduct, and fruition (or ground, path, and fruition)are an undifferentiated and indivisible union, this is referred to as “thefruitional vehicle.”To elaborate, through the view of the ground, the circle of wisdom, you realizesaṃsāra and nirvāṇa to be equality and thereby gain mastery over the life forceof both peace and existence. Meditating on the path, the circle of deity andmantra, confers mastery over the life force of both development and completionstages. Spontaneously accomplishing the twofold benefit confers mastery over thelife force of inconceivable great skillful means. Each one of these, moreover,possesses multiple crucial features and includes all of the essential pointsfound in the path of the vajra vehicle of Secret Mantra.In particular, Patrul Rinpoche has said that, since the stake of unchangingrealization binds within it the life forces of the other three, it is especiallyimportant. It is also stated in a tantra: > If the four stakes that bind the life force are not planted,> Practice will never be fruitful, like running in place. Here “running in place” stands for stationary feet. It is taught as an examplefor the futility of being without the crucial points of the four stakes, suchthat you are only exhausted no matter how frantically you move.The seventh topic will be explained below.Generally, in terms of the four divisions of approach and accomplishment, thereare four divisions of approach and accomplishment in the context ofaccomplishment, four divisions of approach and accomplishment that are explainedto provide a structure that subsumes the development stage, four divisions ofapproach and accomplishment that are explained as a structure that subsumes thecompletion stage, and four divisions of approach and accomplishment explained asa structure that subsumes both the development and completion stages.From among these, here I shall discuss the four divisions of approach andaccomplishment that relate to the context of accomplishment. Since that, too, isdivided into the pair of approach and accomplishment, there are four divisionsof approach. Thus, Khenpo Pema Dorje has said, “You should understand that thereare four divisions of approach and accomplishment that pertain to the context ofpractice: the approach of approach, the close approach of approach, theaccomplishment of approach, and the great accomplishment of approach.”Alternatively, it is said in a tantric commentary: > There are four divisions of approach and accomplishment in the context of the> path: the absorptions of suchness and total illumination are the approach, the> single and complex seals are the close approach, and group assembly practice> is the accomplishment. From this point on, until you reach the levels of the> four knowledge holders that result from the practice, is the great> accomplishment. There are also four divisions of approach and accomplishment in the context ofunion. Seeking a consort and adorning her with the accoutrements is theapproach. Conferring blessing on her is the close approach. Causing seminalfluid to flow downward and retaining it based on sexual play is theaccomplishment. Reversing its flow and evenly dispersing it is greataccomplishment.In the context of practice, these four divisions of approach and accomplishmentare as follows. From gathering the causes and conditions up until commencing theaccomplishment practice is called the “approach.” The first fortnight ofpractice is called the “close approach.” The latter half of the retreat,excluding the final day, is called the “accomplishment.” Receiving the spiritualaccomplishments on the final night is called the “great accomplishment.”Alternatively, in the context of great accomplishment practice, the approachinvolves preparing the accomplishment substances and so forth on the first daythrough the point where you perform the ritual once. The close approach is toperform the visualization of purifying misdeeds and obscurations by projectingand absorbing white rays of light. This phase lasts for half the total number ofdays in which the practice is to be performed. Accomplishment is to visualizethe absorption of the supreme and mundane spiritual accomplishments into you bymeans of the projection and absorption of red light. This lasts for theremainder of the time in which the accomplishment is to be performed. Greataccomplishment involves receiving the spiritual accomplishments on the finalday.One can also connect these four with a single session of a ritual. Here theapproach involves the stages up through the point where you meditate on thethree samādhis. Close approach involves meditating on you as the central deity.Accomplishment involves meditating on the entire assembly of retinue deities.Great accomplishment involves conferring empowerment, sealing, inviting, and soon up to recitation, presenting offerings, praise, and so forth.Alternatively, it is also said that the approach involves focusing the mind onthe central deity. Close approach involves focusing the mind on the centraldeity with its entire retinue. Accomplishment involves applying yourself touttering recitations. Great accomplishment involves projecting and absorbinglight rays. Since these presentations do contain slight differences, here I havepresented them merely as a supplementary discussion.To summarize, as stated by Jigme Lingpa, these four are illustrated by theexample of gaining familiarity with a powerful object. He states: > Approach is when your being gets closer to the wisdom that you want to reach.> Close approach involves mingling the deity’s enlightened mind and your own> ordinary mind. Accomplishment involves gaining mastery over the wisdom that> you have approached. Great accomplishment, which is primarily for the benefit> of others, involves accomplishing the fourfold activities. Moreover, when gathering the accumulations in conjunction with a reparationritual, or when performing accomplishment and great accomplishment practices,you must visualize the deity in front of you. When conferring empowerment,guiding the deceased, and performing other elements for the welfare of others,you must also develop the vase as the deity. Thus, performing the self-,frontal, and vase visualizations together within the context of a single ritualis a feature unique to the highest yoga tantras of the Nyingma School of mantra.To elaborate, in the context of ritual practice, with the same sweeping movementyou develop yourself as the deity and visualize the deity in front of yourselfwithout viewing these two as different. Next, at the conclusion of the praise,you say, “BHRŪṂ VIŚVA . . . ,” up to “PHAṬ JA.” Here, with the syllable PHAṬ,the maṇḍala of the wisdom deity separates from the circle of yourself as thesamaya being and is projected out in front of you. JA stabilizes the flamingmountains that surround the two maṇḍalas such that they touch. On this point,Minling Terchen taught: > For example, just as the reflection of a single face can appear in two> separate mirrors, everything is, in essence, identical yet appears like a> mirror and its multitude of reflections due to the play of wisdom. Thus,> within one protective dome, together with the elements layered one atop the> other, you should simultaneously visualize yourself as the deity and also> project it in front of you. The flaming mountains that surround both of their> celestial mansions should touch one another. While doing so, develop the vase deity in the empty space of the foyer to theeast of the deity projected in the foreground. Whenever the ritual vase isneeded for a particular circumstance, it should be visualized in front of you.Alternatively, Karma Chagme taught that the deity in the foreground is developedwithin the charnel ground that surrounds the self-visualization. The protectivedome, vajra enclosure, and fiery mountains that surround the self-visualizationare spherical like a tent. Within that, you meditate on the vajra enclosure andfiery mountains like an iron fence encircling the front visualization.Alternatively, in the New Schools the self- and front visualizations aredeveloped separately, in succession, using different rituals.It is said that, in the context of developing just yourself as the deity, thiscentral deity, who is the support of the practice, is generally made up of yourown aggregates, elements, and sense faculties. Even while developing the deity,the form aggregate is itself visualized as the celestial mansion. It is not asthough you must newly transform your shape and meditate upon it as a celestialmansion.In this manner, whether you are practicing self- or front visualization, duringthe main part of the development stage, the deity should be brought forth fromwithin the practice of the samādhi of suchness by the compassion of the samādhiof total illumination. Without disconnecting these two, you should elicit thevivid appearance of the development-stage deity as much as possible. It does notsuffice to only meditate on the samādhis of suchness and total illuminationfirst, and then cast them aside.The inseparability of the samādhi of suchness and the vivid appearance of thedeity is the unity of clarity and emptiness, the indivisibility of profundityand clarity, or the unity of development and completion. That unity, inseparablefrom the momentum of compassion, constitutes the main practice of the path ofthe Great Vehicle. This is what we refer to as “emptiness with a core ofcompassion.”Thus, there is nothing more important than the two samādhis of suchness andtotal illumination, in that the unity of the two bodies, the two accumulations,the two truths, and means and knowledge should be understood as a unique featureof the profound and swift path of mantra.Without understanding this point you may believe that the development stage, inand of itself, is an actual entity with its own characteristics. When this isthe case, no matter how clear the appearance or how stable the divine pride, itwill not become the path to enlightenment. On top of that, it will become aformidable obstacle that will bind you to saṃsāra. Even vicious demons havetrained their minds in deity meditation yet failed to conjoin their trainingwith the mind of awakening. Meditating with the belief that peaceful deitiesexist, in their own right, will cause you to be reborn as a god in the formrealm, while meditating on wrathful ones with this belief will cause you to endup like the yogi in India who, after practicing Vajrabhairava, grew fangs anddeveloped a layer of nine boils in the form of nine heads. Similarly, it is saidin The Root Tantra of Mañjuśrī that this belief will cause you to be reborn as ademon or the lord of death in the guise of whichever deity you have meditatedupon. You should have conviction that if your anger or passion increases bymeditating on deities with wrathful or passionate expressions, then yourpractice has not become an authentic path.Therefore, it is said to be very important to connect the deity to the meaningof the statement: > Best is the powerful deity of the view.> Mediocre is the strong deity of the remedy.> And least is the subjugating wisdom deity. Likewise, it is necessary to connect all enlightened activities to the fourgates of Secret Mantra scripture, which are taught as follows: > Reminding yourself of the ultimate meaning is the gate of expressive words.> Invoking the essence of the yidam is the gate of Secret Mantra.> Single-pointed visualization is the gate of mental meditative absorption.> Symbolic signs are the gate of mudrā and dance. Thus, when reciting the words of the development stage visualization ritualstep-by-step, do not be distracted elsewhere. Rather, recite slowly and, witheach and every word, do not separate the visualization from the recitation. Ifyou happen to get temporarily distracted, go back and do it again from thebeginning. It is said that doing so will help you to avoid getting distractedfrom that point on.When you have become exhausted with meditating one-pointedly on the clarity,purity, and stability of the development stage, you should engage in recitation.The Thunder of the Precious Tantra of Enlightened Speech states: > If practitioners with devotion and samaya vows> Wish for the supreme accomplishment,> And want to mingle indivisibly with the wisdom deity,> They should exert themselves in mantra. Enlightened Speech The second main point concerns the recitation practice of enlightened speech.The general understanding of this practice is as follows. The object ofpurification is our ordinary impure and confused speech, expressions, andmeanings, along with all our habitual tendencies to ascribe reality to them. Theprocess of purification, emphasizing mantra recitation, is the mantra that youcontinuously repeat and recite. This, in turn, establishes an interdependentconnection with the result of purification, working for the welfare of othersvia the enlightened activity of vajra speech.The specific purpose of this practice is to call out to the wisdom deities, justas a person will naturally come closer if you call out his or her name. TheCondensed Realization states: > The deity is like a companion that you search for in order to accomplish a> given task. The mantra is like calling out to someone, saying, “Hey, my friend> . . .” A vajra song explains: > The buddhas, bodhisattvas,> Ḍākinīs, and your own queen—> To bring them right before you> Invoke them with mantra. In essence, knowledge mantras have the nature of wisdom, and are the vajraspeech of the buddhas. You meditate on the form of the ordinary syllables thatresemble these knowledge mantras with the conviction that they are wisdomknowledge mantras. Doing so, they are recited continuously. In Sanskrit this isreferred to as jap; this is the essence of recitation.Moreover, as you develop the vivid appearance of the deity, picture yourself asthe samaya being. In the jewel citta of your heart visualize a sphere of lightthat resembles a crystal dome. It is luminous, clear, and without any obscuringoverlay. In the middle of this sphere is a seat made of layered sun and moondiscs. This is where the wisdom being sits. The wisdom being resembles thesamaya being, yet is bereft of ornaments and symbolic implements. In its heartcenter is a symbolic implement, which has within it a seat made of either asingle sun disc or moon disc. Alternatively, the seat may be layered with both.In either case, the seat should be the size of a split pea. Upon it sits theabsorption being, the root life force of enlightened mind, such as a HRĪḤ or HŪṂsyllable. The same color as the deity, this syllable should be as fine as thoughit were drawn with a single hair and as bright and dazzling as a candle flame.It should also be standing upright and face the same direction as the deity.Although the three beings are tiered, it is said that you should not harbordistorted thoughts about them resembling containers stacked within one another.Moreover, the texts vary on this point—sometimes there are three beings in tiersand sometimes not, so you should follow the scripture of the ritual that you areperforming.The Tantra of Enlightened Body states: > Since you and whatever appears from you> Abide within a single samaya vow,> The apparition is known as the samaya being. As stated here, the term “samaya” is used since you visualize your body, speech,and mind as the deity’s body, speech, and mind and subsequently do not breakthat visualization. The term “being” is used since you visualize the deity andabandon ordinary wrong views. Again, The Tantra of Enlightened Body explains: > Since it appears as the king of awareness, primordial wisdom,> It is the wisdom being. While The Garland of Light says: > It is called “wisdom” because it unmistakenly knows the primordial nature. Moreover, according to Padma Mati, “wisdom” refers to knowing that the threebodies are primordially in-dwelling, while “being” indicates that you are freefrom the wrong view of dualism. Similarly, “absorption” connotes the method, orbasis, for resting the mind one-pointedly and without distraction, while “being”refers to not being oppressed by dullness, agitation, and other such faults.According to Karma Chagme, the syllable of the life force of enlightened mindfaces forward. However, the intent of the Lord Guru is what I have justexplained.Styles of Recitation For mantras that spin in a clockwise direction, the syllables begin in front ofthe life force of enlightened mind and face outward. They should be arrangedfrom left to right, as though you could read them from the outside, with theletters standing upright and circling to the right like a chain. The firstsyllable, such as OṂ, should be connected to HŪṂ, HRĪḤ, or whatever the lastsyllable happens to be. As a skillful way to deal with long mantras, the firstsyllable of the mantra must be visualized right in front of the life force ofenlightened mind with the other syllables following neatly after it in two orthree outer rings, like a coiled snake.When reciting mantras, the mantra chain should spin clockwise as though it werebeing read from the outside. Other mantra chains spin in a counterclockwisedirection. With these, the syllables are visualized standing upright, beginningin front of the life force of enlightened mind as was the case above. Thesyllables should face inwards and be arranged from right to left, as if readfrom the inside. Long mantras circle from the inside out, just as above, butwhen chanted they spin in a counterclockwise direction. This is how it isexplained in Husks of Unity.Generally speaking, for male deities the mantra spins clockwise and for femaledeities counterclockwise. This is not always the case, however, so you shouldfollow the approach of your own practice text. There are also other key pointsconcerning visualizations that are meant to protect or repel, but these shouldbe studied in their own contexts. It is also said that the more finely you canvisualize the syllables of the life force of enlightened mind and the mantrachain, the better it will be for your concentration.The considerations related to the intent of recitation are threefold: (1) silentrecitation, (2) mental recitation, and (3) verbal recitation.Silent recitation involves concentrating one-pointedly on the spinning of themantra chain around the life force of enlightened mind while arresting themovement of the breath. In this way, you merely keep the intermediate breathsmooth and balanced, without harming your health. Once the breath is exhaled,the life force of enlightened mind and the mantra chain emit five-colored lightin the shape of a long braided string that emerges from the two nostrils,purifying all that appears and exists into a pure realm. As you inhale, allanimate and inanimate objects—the world and its inhabitants—melt completely intofive-colored light that enters the two nostrils and dissolves back into themantra chain and the life force of enlightened mind. As the breath rests within,the intermediate breath is held and your awareness mingles indivisibly with themantra chain. Such is the training in silent recitation.Next, concentrate on the self-resounding tune emitted by the mantra chain andperform an exclusively mental recitation of the root mantra without anyomissions or additions.Finally, perform the verbal recitation. The Awesome Flash of Lightning states: > The voice should be neither loud nor quiet,> Not fast and not slow, nor rough or weak.> Enunciate the syllables in their entirety.> There should be no distraction or idle talk,> Nor interruptions by yawning and the like. Those are the ten faults of recitation that you must avoid. The CondensedRealization speaks in similar terms: > When performing verbal mantra recitation, you should avoid an overly drawn-out> pronunciation, which will strain your breath and interrupt your speech. Your> recitation should also not be overly rushed as your breath will then lose its> vigor, which, in turn, leads to a shortened lifespan or a dull complexion. If> you recite too intensely, your health will be damaged. If your recitation is> rough, you may harm nonhuman beings or cause them to faint, so avoid this> fault as well. If your recitation is too weak, the mantra will lose its> strength and delay its effectiveness, so avoid that. You should not take too> much time with the recitation either, as the number of repetitions will be too> few. If you rush the recitation, the words will not be pronounced properly and> you will end up missing or adding words. Hence, give up these six faults while you recite. The Tantra of the PreciousThunder Roar mentions: > Consuming garlic is a nine-day setback.> Consuming rasana is a twenty-one-day setback.> Eating ginger is a three-day setback.> Meat and alcohol that are not consecrated set you back by five days.> Lies, gossip, and other> Negative verbal acts> Will permanently destroy the mantra’s potency> Or greatly delay the goal.> Blessing worldly ones with your breath> Must be avoided as it destroys the mantra’s potency. Avoid these general and specific faults, and recite clearly, correctly, and in apleasant tone.As you recite the mantra, focus your mind on the seed syllable surrounded by themantra chain that rests in your heart center, and then recite the mantra asthough you are reading. This is known as “the arranged recitation” or “therecitation that resembles a moon with a garland of stars.” This style ofrecitation refers to the branch of approach. Sometimes it is taught that therecitation that resembles a moon with a garland of stars refers to focusing onthe syllable and mantra chain while it is raised above the seat and spinningwhile resounding with its own sound. However, the intent of the tantras and themasters is as I have mentioned here.The recitation of close approach is similar to a spinning firebrand. Here youvisualize a second mantra chain being projected from the mantra chain in theheart center. The syllables stand upright and are stacked on top of each other,one above the other, like a chain. They touch one another to form a continuouschain, but are not joined. Resounding with its own sound, the mantra firstemerges from the mouth of the wisdom being and then from the mouth of the samayabeing before entering the mouth of the consort. It travels through the interiorof the consort’s body to the secret space where it reenters the samaya beingthrough the passage of his jewel. Finally, as the essence of great bliss of themind of awakening, it is reabsorbed into the life force of enlightened mind,bringing you all the supreme and common spiritual accomplishments withoutexception. Then maintain the recitation while visualizing that the mantracontinues to spin as just described.Alternatively, when the samaya and wisdom beings are separated, you should usethe following visualization. First, the mantra chain emerges from your mouth andenters the mouth of the wisdom being in front of you. It then emerges from thenavel of the wisdom being and enters your own navel. It is sometimes said thatonly the mantra’s light spins, not the actual mantra chain. For all practicesthat involve a front visualization, the recitation should be applied in thismanner. It should only be the mantra’s light that is projected and absorbed inthis exchange between yourself and the front visualization.For accomplishment, we have the recitation that is intended to be like a king’smessenger. Here light is projected from the seed syllable in the heart center.Gradually it reaches the retinue and invokes their wisdom minds. Light is thenprojected again from the mantra chain such that it pervades all of space. Thelight brings pleasing offerings to all the buddhas, thereby perfecting the twoaccumulations. All their blessings and spiritual accomplishments then take theform of light and dissolve into you. In this way you obtain the fourempowerments, purify the four obscurations, and actualize the four bodies. Thisis known as “the recitation that gathers blessings for your own benefit.” Lightthen projects out again, this time touching all six types of sentient beingsthroughout space. Imagine that this light purifies all their karmic actions anddisturbing emotions, along with their latent tendencies, so that their body,speech, and mind are enlightened as the essence of the three vajras. This isreferred to as “the activity recitation that benefits others.”The recitation of great accomplishment is likened to a broken beehive. Herelimitless light rays stream forth from the deity and the mantra chain, cleansingand purifying the obscurations of the six types of beings. This transforms theworld into a celestial palace and all beings into deities, forming the maṇḍalaof the yidam deity. All sounds become the natural sound of mantra, humming likea broken beehive. All of the mind’s thoughts and memories become the play of thedharma body, the wisdom of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality. Reciting withinthis nondual state is known as “the recitation beyond self and other.”In general, visualizing the projection and absorption of light takes place inthe following way. First, light streams forth from the mantra chain in the heartcenter and emerges from the crown protuberance, the hair between the eyebrows,the tongue, the endless knot at the heart center, the pores of the skin, andother such places. The light pervades all the realms in the ten directions, suchas our present billionfold world system. At the tip of the light rays are aninconceivable number of male and female bodhisattvas who bring forth offeringclouds, songs of praise, showers of flowers, and streams of perfume. They makethese offerings to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas and sing their praises,entreating them to accomplish the welfare of sentient beings. They all thenassume the form of yidam deities of various sizes and appearances, arising as adisplay that guides those in need. Then all the deities project divine bodiesand light from their navels, secret places, hips, knees, soles of their feetwith thousand-spoked wheels, and other such places. This display utterly fillsthe entire world, which resounds with the sound of mantra. In this way, thekarmic actions, disturbing emotions, and deluded perceptions, along with allhabitual tendencies, of all six types of beings in the three realms arepurified, like frost melted by sunlight. Everyone transforms into the form ofthe yidam deity and the mantra resounds on its own, humming like bees from abroken hive.Once again the light rays gather back, bringing with them all the qualities ofthe knowledge, love, and ability of the victorious ones and their offspring. Theentire visualization of the world and its beings as the pure circle gathers inthe form of buddhas, syllables, symbolic implements, and light. It enters theroot maṇḍala and the central deity through the pores in the skin and dissolvesinto the life force of enlightened mind. As that happens, all concepts ofsaṃsāra and nirvāṇa and self and other mingle indivisibly as one taste withinthe state of awareness wisdom. In this way the deity, appearances, and realitybecome one. This is an important point to observe, as taught by Khenpo PemaDorje. The specific visualizations for each of the four activities should beperformed as described in each individual scripture.In short, you must possess the absorption of clearly visualizing the deity (theseal of the enlightened body), the genuine recitation of the Secret Mantra (theDharma seal of enlightened speech), and the realization of everything as beingunborn (the samaya seal of enlightened mind).As there is no fixed rule that you must incorporate these four styles ofrecitation in a single ritual, it will suffice to link this description with theactual description of the visualization for the recitation as it is found inyour individual practice text. In any case, according to Patrul Rinpoche, whenyou chant the mantra it is very beneficial and effective to imagine that thesyllables of the mantra naturally hum their particular sounds, that the hosts ofdeities chant the mantra, and that all the worlds and their inhabitants,including all fauna and flora, become the nature of the deity and hum with thesound of the mantra.As a beginner you should begin by focusing on the mantra chain as you chant themantra. Develop the confidence that you are the deity and, as you recite, foreach spin of the mantra chain refresh the visualization of the deity. Once youhave gotten used to that, you can gradually train in the other aspects, such asthe projection and absorption of light. Having completed the approach in thismanner, you can practice the visualization and recitation of accomplishment. TheKey Instructions of the Single Sphere of Purity explain: > In one session, focus your mind on the deity.> In one session, recite the secret mantra.> In one session, follow the movement of the breath.> In one session, apply the key point of direct perception—> Uncontrived awareness, the Ever-excellent One. The Great One from Uḍḍiyāna says: > Recite with undistracted concentration.> Should you become distracted elsewhere,> Even reciting for an eon will bring no result. The Secret Tantra says: > Recitation that is corrupted by drowsiness and dullness> Will cause the obstacle of malevolent spirits to enter.> Recitation that is based on a misguided intention> Will never become a path to enlightenment. The Tantra of the Layered Lotus Stems states: > The vitality of absorption, mantra, and recitation> Mutually give rise to one another.> So to have immaculate clarity, purity, and expression is important,> As it results in the accomplishment of all that you wish. As these verses mention, it is very important to maintain mindfulness andintrospection during all deity meditations and mantra recitations. The CondensedRealization says: > Good actions mixed with negativity> Are like water running under hay—> You risk not noticing your own confusion.> Thus, at times reflect on the way you are,> And consider the paths that result from good and bad.> Short sessions, repeated often, agree with both the outer and the inner.> Rest in the genuine natural state. Moreover, the way to recite is described in The Gradual Path: > Abandon the ten faults and, based on the three ways,> Complete the number of recitations. The ten faults were described above. The three ways refer to the recitationstyles of (1) the threefold visualization, (2) the outer, inner, and secretways, and (3) the three subtle ones.The “recitation of threefold visualization” refers to imagining (1) you as theone who projects and reabsorbs, (2) the front visualization as that whichreceives the projection, and (3) light as the projection that passes in between.This is mentioned in The Gradual Path: > Reciting to the wisdom being elevated before you> Takes place with the threefold visualization. With PHAṬ JAḤ you open up the maṇḍala of the wisdom being in the space beforeyou, complete as the support and the supported. Light projects out from theheart center of yourself (visualized as the samaya being) and then returns,going back and forth like a spinning firebrand. As it revolves, the sound of themantra resounds like the roar of a thousand thunderclaps. As you visualize this,perform the recitation within the state of the indivisibility of sound andemptiness.Next are the outer, inner, and secret recitation styles. The outer recitationbegins by opening the wisdom and samaya maṇḍalas. Next you recite the mantrawhile the projection and absorption of light take place, circling out from themouths of the central deities and back through the pathway of the secret vajra.Alternatively, as the light is projected out, it initiates the purification ofobscurations and, as it returns, makes you a suitable recipient for thespiritual accomplishments since the obscurations have been purified.The inner recitation can be performed regardless of whether the maṇḍala of thewisdom being has been opened or not. Here light is projected out, therebyinvoking the spiritual accomplishments. As it returns, you imagine that thespiritual accomplishments are attained.In the secret recitation light is not projected out and only the spiritualaccomplishments are absorbed. Alternatively, you can also visualize that thelight circles out through the male deity’s mouth and into the female deity’smouth before returning back through her secret space.The recitation of the three subtle ones is as follows. When performing theprojection and absorption, you project and absorb minute syllables, symbolicimplements, and divine bodies. Alternatively, you may also perform the vajrarecitation.Moreover, there are also the recitation styles of (1) the voice, (2) the form,(3) the practice, and (4) the vajra. “Voice” refers to the various verbalrecitation styles, such as the spinning firebrand, which were covered above. Itmay also involve the recitations of projection and absorption or those of thesamaya being, the wrathful style, and that of the palanquin. “Form recitation”refers to recollecting the appearance of the deity. Practice recitation takesplace by directing your mind to suchness. Vajra recitation is fourfold, asexpressed in The Prophecy of Realization: > Expressions, with focal point,> Symbolic, and ultimate. First, the “vajra recitation with expression” refers to verbally reciting thethree syllables. Next, the vajra recitation with a focal point refers tomeditating on the shape and color of the three letters. The “symbolic vajrarecitation” refers to imagining the exhalation, inhalation, and resting of thebreath as the melodies of the three syllables, and to thereby recite with theknowledge that the breath and mantra are indivisible. Finally, the “ultimatevajra recitation” refers to the realization that all names, words, andexpressions are illusory by their very nature. This realization occurs byrecognizing that the exhalation, inhalation, and resting of the breath, as wellas your body, speech, and mind, are inseparable from the Great Seal.The Rosary At this point, the rosary for counting the mantras should be mentioned. TheGreat Master explains: > For a rosary the best substances are jewels.> Seeds that come from trees are second-best.> The lowest are clay, stones,> And the nine types of medicine. > Conch makes for peaceful rosaries> And is recommended for pacifying activities.> Golden rosaries are used for enriching activities,> While rosaries of coral accomplish magnetizing activities. > Rosaries of iron and turquoise are for wrathful activities.> Zi and agate are auspicious for various activities.> Clay and seeds are used for pacifying activities.> Apricot seeds accomplish enriching activities. > Soapberry is auspicious for magnetizing activities.> Nāga, garuḍa beak, and rakṣa are recommended> As rosaries for wrathful activities,> While bodhi seeds are auspicious for all. > Rosaries of bodhi tree and the kyenyen tree> Are auspicious rosaries for pacifying activities.> Mulberry and other fruit trees make rosaries> That accomplish enriching activities. > Rosaries of red sandalwood and tamarisk> Are recommended for magnetizing activities.> Teak and thorns are wrathful trees.> Rosaries of barlo tree > Are recommended for all activities.> Ivory rosaries accomplish all activities.> Clay balls make peaceful rosaries.> For enriching, stone rosaries are auspicious. > Rosaries of medicine accomplish magnetizing activities,> While rosaries of the great bone, such as skull,> Will accomplish wrathful activities.> Rosaries composed of a mixture> Are said to accomplish all activities. In this way, certain substances and colors of rosaries are said to be auspiciousfor each of the four types of activity. In particular, the verse states thatbodhi seeds are auspicious for all. Moreover, in terms of the way that rosariesmultiply the effects of mantra recitation, it is said that the bodhi seedmultiplies infinitely. Since the bodhi seed is auspicious for both peaceful andwrathful recitations, it is praised as the supreme substance.You should not use a rosary that has been obtained from the hand of someone whohas committed any of the actions with immediate retribution, nor from a butcher,samaya breaker, murderer, widow, or thief. This also applies to rosaries thathave been obtained through robbery, offered to a deity by another, taken from adeity’s ornaments, have an unsuitable number of beads, have been burnt by fire,stepped over by an animal, or nibbled on by birds or mice. It is said that suchrosaries should be avoided since their use will lead to a lapse in the samayavows related to mantra.Instead, you should use a rosary made from a suitable substance and then wash itin water. You should also anoint it with the substances of a cow and perfume, asdescribed in The Root Tantra of Mañjuśrī. The Tantra of the Natural Arising ofAwareness explains: > For the rosary join three, five, or nine strings,> Symbolizing the three bodies, five families, and nine vehicles.> The knots are tied in three tiers, symbolizing the three bodies. As stated here, even the string for the rosary must be made of threads that aresuitable for the four kinds of activities. For example, for wrathful activity itis said that the string should be made of threaded intestines, tendons, and thelike. The Condensed Realization explains: > In all cases the thickness of the string> Should fit the hole in the beads—> Not too thick, not too thin;> Not too long, not too short.> If too thin, the activity will not succeed.> If too thick, faults and obstacles will interfere.> If too long, the deities are delayed and accomplishments fade.> If too short, your life force will be impaired.> If tangled, knotted, and uneven,> Misfortune will follow.> All these details should be understood. The same scripture continues: > If the string should break,> Replace it swiftly, within a day. The way to plait the threads is mentioned in The Saṃbhuṭi Tantra: > The seeds of the Sanskrit alphabet> Are strung with the thread of HŪṂ. Thus, it is said that you should imagine that the thread of the rosary is thecentral deity and that the rosary that surrounds it is of the retinue ofdeities. You should also string the rosary while singing the syllable HŪṂ in amelodious manner. The Condensed Realization states: > On the rosary of various activities are the central beads—> The seal of enlightened body, speech, and mind. As stated here, the central beads represent the three vajras of enlightenedbody, speech, and mind. It is said that the top bead should be blue, the middlered, and the bottom white.A rosary with these qualities must then be consecrated. The way to do so isdescribed in the following passage from The Explanation of the CondensedRealization: > With the central beads in the middle standing upright, place the rosary in> your left hand like a coiled snake. As the text says, first bless your hands, then say and imagine the following: > In the palm of the right hand is a sun disc marked with a HŪṂ. > In the palm of the left hand is a moon disc marked with an ĀḤ. > Next, with divine pride, purify all concepts of the rosary as being ordinary> with the mantra OṂ SVABHĀVA ŚUDDHAḤ SARVADHARMĀḤ SVABHĀVA ŚUDDHO ’HAṂ. Imagine> that a lotus with a seat of sun and moon discs appears within the state of> emptiness. On this seat the central beads transform into the central yidam> deity through instantaneous recollection and the rosary becomes the> surrounding retinue. The seed syllables at the three places then project> light, inviting wisdom beings that resemble the samaya being. With the mantra> DZAḤ HŪṂ BAṂ HOḤ the wisdom being dissolves indivisibly into the samaya being> and the seven vajra qualities become naturally and spontaneously present. The> thus-gone ones, accompanied by their retinue of bodhisattva heirs, arise as> the primordial essence of the rosary. Next, with the certainty of knowing> things as they are, join your fingers, representing means and knowledge, and> count the essence mantra. Doing so will bring about the power and potential to> unimpededly attain all worldly and transcendent spiritual accomplishments. After reciting the root mantra as much as you can, chant the “Essence ofDependent Origination” together with the Sanskrit alphabet. Then chant mantrasover the ritual rice and scatter the grains on the rosary. In particular, youshould recite the mantra that is given in your own scripture one hundred andeight times. In all cases, a specific point concerning the visualization is thatyou should visualize the deities you wish to accomplish dissolving into therosary in the form of the syllables of the mantra, colored to correspond withthe activity, like rain falling from the sky. Then recite the mantra OṂ RUCIPRAVARTAYA RATNAMAṆI DHARA JÑĀNADEVA ABHIṢIÑCA HŪṂ SVĀHĀ and chant the verses ofauspiciousness.When the time comes for applying the activity, first you should chant the threesyllables one hundred and eight times, followed by the Sanskrit alphabet, the“Essence of Dependent Origination” and the mantras for blessing the rosarytwenty-one times each. Following this, you should begin the relevant recitation.This is all very clearly explained in the relevant scriptures.It is said that by using such a genuine rosary the effects of your mantrarecitation will be multiplied by one hundred thousand. Moreover, the textcontinues: > It is good to repeat the consecration from time to time. And: > It is, therefore, a key instruction to regularly repeat the blessing ritual. For this reason, make sure to bless the rosary in this way at the beginning ofyour sessions.The way to count the mantras is mentioned in the Meteor Wheel That Tames theHaughty Ones: > The rosary for counting should be strung with several threads.> The DZAḤ on the thumb projects a hook of light,> Attracting the deity and bringing it to the navel and heart center.How to Recite Mantras Concerning the way in which mantras should be recited, the Great Master fromUḍḍiyāna explains: > Count at your heart for peaceful activity,> At your navel for enriching activity,> At the secret place for magnetizing activity,> Count with a wish to summon.> For wrathful activity count near your knee> At the point where the legs are crossed.> For multiple activities count wherever is comfortable. Explaining further, he states: > When reciting peaceful mantras> Count with the rosary on your index finger,> And for enriching mantras, on your middle finger.> For magnetizing, keep it on your ring finger,> And for wrathful mantras, on the little finger.> Always use your left hand;> Never count with your right hand. However, it is said that on some occasions you may count using both hands andthat for wrathful mantras you can count using the thumb of the right hand. Thereis also a way of counting that expels, as is the case with averting mantras.From a general point of view, an easy and effective way to practice is to placethe rosary on top of the index finger, and then count with the thumb in the formof a hook. This holds for all four types of enlightened activity.There are also samaya vows that must be observed. The great master Padmasambhavaexplains: > A genuine rosary should accompany you at all times,> Like the body and its shadow.> This is the fundamental samaya of the rosary. > Although a great many subsidiary samayas are taught,> In brief this is what you should know:> Do not show your rosary to others.> If you do not let it leave the warmth of your body,> Whatever you practice will quickly be accomplished. > Likewise, do not let anyone else hold it,> Especially, it is said, anyone with damaged samaya vows, obscurations,> Or with whom you do not share the same samaya.> It is important not to let it slip into the hands of such people. > Other than using it to count when reciting,> Do not hold it leisurely at inappropriate times.> Do not employ it for the sake of divination and astrology.> A rosary that has not been consecrated should never be held. > A consecrated rosary should be kept secret> And not used for other activities.> Do not place it on the ground or cast it aside. > Do not use a so-called “adulterated rosary,”> One mixed with inappropriate things. Furthermore, the masters of mantra have taught that if you slip intoconversation while counting the mantra, you must subtract some numbers, goingback four beads on the rosary. If you cough, go back five, three if you yawn,ten if you sneeze, and one if you spit.As described, first visualize the appearance of the deity, then the mantrachain, and finally the projection and absorption of light and so on. However, itis very important that these individual stages only be performed once you havereached stability in the visualizations of the preceding stage.Concluding the Session When the time comes to conclude the session, you must compensate for anyadditions and omissions in the recitation. To do so, chant the Sanskritalphabet, recite the hundred-syllable mantra and the “Essence of DependentOrigination” three times each. Following this, make offerings and offer praise.The meaning of this meditation was explained above.Should there be any auspicious sign when you arrive at the stage ofaccomplishment, you must immediately take the spiritual accomplishments or youwill run the risk of it dissipating. Therefore, when you reach this stage of thepractice, you should receive the spiritual accomplishments on a daily basis. Itis especially important to do so at dawn on the final day of your practice. Themeaning of this practice will be explained below.Next, present offerings and praise as an expression of gratitude, then ask forforgiveness by supplicating in the following way: > Ignorant and careless, we beginners have failed to develop meditative clarity> in our visualization and have not recited the required number of mantras. In> performing the ritual, we have added some things and omitted others. We have> also failed to gather offering substances and ritual implements, and fallen> prey to laziness. We now confess this and feel great embarrassment and remorse> for all our confused errors related to the performance of the profound rituals> of Secret Mantra. Please be forbearing and purify these errors. Next, as you recite the hundred-syllable mantra, imagine that all transgressionsare purified and cleansed.Enlightened Mind Thirdly comes the luminosity practice of enlightened mind. When there is a frontvisualization involved, such as during the accomplishment stage, the wisdombeings in front should be requested to remain in the support if there is one. Ifthere is no support present, you should request them to depart into the naturalbasic space of phenomena. The samaya beings are then gathered into theself-visualization.When there is only a self-visualization involved, the wisdom being within neverdeparts. Thus, chant the verses of the dissolution while you visualize thefollowing. First, imagine that the entire universe and its inhabitants melt intolight and dissolve into the celestial palace. Next, the palace itself, startingfrom the perimeter, is gradually absorbed into the retinue deities. The retinuedissolves into the central male and female deities. The female consort thendissolves into the male deity, the male deity dissolves into the wisdom being inhis heart center, and the wisdom being dissolves into the encircling mantra.Finally, the mantra dissolves into the absorption being—the seed syllable of thelife force of enlightened mind.Focus your attention on this syllable, which then dissolves, from the bottom up,until even the upper tip is gone. At this point, rest for as long as you areable in the nonconceptual state of emptiness free from dualistic observations.This clears away the extreme of permanence. Alternatively, you may also performthe dissolution that is likened to a rainbow vanishing in the sky. The first ofthese approaches is called the “subsequent dissolution,” while the latter isknown as the “complete dissolution.” These are, in fact, very similar but forbeginners it is very important to practice the subsequent dissolution. On thistopic, the Great Omniscient One explains: > The development stage ends the belief that appearances are real.> The completion stage eliminates the belief that holds them to be illusory.> When free from believing that appearance and emptiness are real,> You have reached the pure nature of indivisible development and completion. As stated here, the method for overcoming ordinary concepts, whereby we believein the reality of the world and its inhabitants, is to dissolve the illusoryperception of divine appearances into the space of luminosity. This is known asthe completion stage. And since this practice is the key point for purifying thestage of death into the dharma body, it cannot be dispensed with.Next, when emerging from this state of dissolution, recite the root mantra once.This creates the conditions for you to emerge as the single illusory form of thedeity during the subsequent attainment, thereby eliminating the extreme ofnihilism.Sometimes it is taught that the three places should be marked with the threesyllables that confer the blessings of vajra body, speech, and mind. At thecrown of your head, visualize the syllable HAṂ, which melts and forms armorcomposed of crossed-vajras. At your fingertips, visualize two wrathful deitiesto protect the body. The head ornaments and crown should fit tightly and be verystable. Next, visualize the protective dome and chant the dedication,aspirations, and verses of auspiciousness.When practicing the development stage it is important to understand each of theprinciples related to the object of purification, the process of purification,and the result of purification in relation to the practice of purification,perfection, and maturation. However, the details of these points should belearned from other sources.SUBSEQUENT PRACTICES The subsequent practices constitute the seventh topic presented earlier, whichis bringing the deity onto the path. This consists of the ten things tounderstand and the six fundamental samaya vows. Concerning the ten things tounderstand it is said: > Treat the subsequent attainment like an illusion, a mirage,> A dream, a reflection, the moon’s reflection in water,> A hallucination, an echo, a city of gandharvas,> A bubble, and a magical apparition. The six fundamental samaya vows are as follows: > Not to abandon the guru and the yidam deity,> Not to err about what should be accepted and abandoned,> To observe meditative absorption,> And to keep the object of your meditation and your conduct secret—> These six are the samayas of the development stage. As outlined here, you should adopt or abandon with respect to these. Moreover,you should also train in not parting from the three integrations byunderstanding the three seats to be the deity’s maṇḍala.The three seats are for the thirty-four deities. The aggregates and the elementsare the seat of the male and female thus-gone ones, the sense fields are theseats of the male and female bodhisattvas, and the limbs are the seats of themale and female wrathful deities. The male and female bodhisattvas are buddhasfrom the perspective of their pristine fruition. They should not be mistaken forbodhisattvas that dwell on the levels of spiritual attainment.In this way, whenever you engage in activities between sessions, or while movingaround, sitting, eating, or walking, you should cultivate pure realms, transformsense pleasures into feast offerings, engage in the ten Dharma activities (suchas prostrating, circumambulating, and reciting), and do anything that skillfullyripens the minds of others. Ensure that you do not let your body, speech, andmind slip into an ordinary state. It is said that if thoughts proliferate duringthe breaks, your sessions will become a farce. On the other hand, if you arouserenunciation, weariness with saṃsāra, and other such qualities during thebreaks, and your mind is weary with cyclic existence when entering a practicesession, that session will definitely be effective. If this then arouses a senseof enthusiasm, your subsequent sessions will also become increasingly endowedwith good qualities.Concerning the way to implement the practices associated with your behavior,such as eating, dressing, and so on, you may consult texts such as Dharmaśrī’sInner Dharma Conduct.During the other sessions you should act in the usual manner, beginning withinviting the field of merit into the space within the protective dome,supplicating, going for refuge, and generating the mind of awakening, all theway up to the dissolution, arising, and other elements that take place at theconclusion, as well as reciting dedications, aspirations, and auspiciousprayers.In some approach manuals it is said that the practices of expelling obstructors,the protective dome, and so forth can be excluded in the later sessions of theday, and you may begin these sessions with offerings and blessings. Someapproach manuals also say that you need not perform the stage of dissolution atthe end of each session; if you do perform the dissolution, it is only performedat the conclusion of the evening session. However, it is better to do thingsaccording to the instructions outlined here. The rationale is that, in thecontext of approach, it is necessary to train the mind in the entire range ofinstructions related to purifying birth, death, and the intermediate state bymeans of the development stage ritual. On this point it is said: > It is necessary to expel stray entities, protect against obstacles, and the> like, which may occur in the context of the breaks. If you dedicate a torma for obstructors on a regular basis, you should do so atthe beginning of the morning session, but you will not incur the fault ofomission if you do not. You should, however, dedicate a torma and perform areparation feast offering of appropriate length in the evening session. Ingeneral, since evening and late night are vital times for reparation feastofferings, you should perform them at such times. Alternatively, because it maybe easier to do so in the afternoon session, offering such a feast at that timedoes not present any problem either. Even without gathering regularly for afeast offering, doing it at the beginning and end of the approach and on sacreddays will suffice. It is also permissible to omit a regular covenantproclamation and the Tenma goddess offerings.Whatever the case, when you finish gathering the accumulations of offering thebody after the evening session, you should perform the practice of sleep.Dharmaśrī taught this as follows: > Outwardly, sleep in the style of a lion, facing west with your head to the> north, your back to the east, and your right side down. With the right hand> placed under your cheek, block the right nostril with your ring finger. Extend> your left arm, resting it on your thigh. With the notion that you will wake up> and engage in virtue, sleep while resting your mind in the spacelike nature of> reality with the thought, “May I attain the dharma body of buddhahood.”> Internally, visualize the maṇḍala that is to be absorbed, then imagine that> the entire impure universe and its inhabitants are struck with light from your> heart center and are dissolved into the support. Next, the support gradually> dissolves, all the way up to the uppermost tip of the life force of> enlightened mind. This, in turn, is absorbed into nonobjectified basic space.> Finally, fall asleep in the nonconceptual state. If you do not fall asleep, it> will suffice to repeat this process.> Secretly, at night you should “collect all objects of knowledge into a vase.”> In your heart center visualize a slightly closed red lotus with four petals,> and within it a white letter A without any additional punctuation. This letter> symbolizes the birthless nature and blazes like a butter lamp inside a vase.> As you focus your mind on this letter, collect and retain the energies in your> heart center with the sense that the upper and lower parts of your body have> gathered there. By falling asleep in this manner your sleep will be dreamless> and dawn as the luminosity of nonconceptual empty clarity. When it comes time for the dawn session, imagine that you are awakened by theḍākas and ḍākinīs who, accompanied by the sound of ḍamarus, bells, and cymbals,encourage you from the sky with this song: “Arise from luminosity as the formbodies!” Then, arising in the form of the deity in the context of the subsequentattainment, expel the stale winds and refresh your motivation. Next, bless yourspeech and then continue practicing up to the guru yoga and receive the fourempowerments. Once these steps are complete, perform the dawn session as usual.In this way you should practice the four sessions in a continuous successionuntil the approach is finished. The duration of the sessions is taught in TheRoot Tantra of Mañjuśrī: > A series of one hundred finger snaps> Is taught to be one circulation of the channels.> Four circulations of the channels occur during a forty-five minute period.> Four such periods are called a “session.” > Four sessions are taught to comprise a day.> A night is taught to consist of the same.> That which includes eight such sessions> Is considered a day and night of practice. > Ten blinks of an eye> Is considered the duration of one second.> “Ten seconds”> Is considered a moment.> Four moments are considered> “One session” by those who know mantra. To elaborate, the duration of an approach is threefold. There is a numberbasedapproach, in which case the general approach is either to recite until you havereached a specific number that you have kept in mind or, if the mantra for themain deity is short, to recite one hundred thousand mantras for each syllableand, if it is long, to recite one hundred thousand of the entire mantra.Specific details can be found in the text you are using. It is also explainedthat the mantras of each member of the retinue should be recited one-tenth thenumber of recitations of the root mantra.There is also a time-based approach. The Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvaraexplains: > In the complete epoch, a certain number of mantras is recited.> In the threefold epoch, it is twice that number.> In the twofold epoch, it is explained to be three times that number.> In the volatile epoch, four times that number must be recited. Alternatively, the approach may last for one year, or six months, three months,or any other number of days, depending upon your inclination.There is also a sign-based period of approach. This refers to continuing theapproach until you have witnessed a sign of accomplishment either in actuality,in a meditative experience, or in a dream. Signs will be specified in the textyou are using. On this topic, the Great Master of Uḍḍiyāna taught: > Joyous, ebullient, and with lucid awareness,> Your practice will develop and your mind and body will be at ease.> In particular, afterward> Realization will dawn in your mind-stream and you will be diligent.> You will no longer entertain mundane activities. Thus, if the qualities of the path, such as renunciation, weariness, devotion,pure perception, compassion, and the mind of awakening, develop further whiledisturbing emotions, such as attachment and anger, gradually diminish, then theother signs in actuality, in meditative experiences, or in dreams are likewiseauthentic. However, if the opposite occurs, then even visions, prophecies, andthe like are said to be demonic deceptions. With this understanding, it is veryimportant not to entertain preferences, hope, or fear concerning signs.Moreover, it is said in The Tantra of Layered Lotus Stems: > Thus, the master and the deity> Will be pleased because accomplishment is reached,> While the mother goddesses, ḍākinīs, and their servants> Will be enlisted in ritual actions because their wishes are fulfilled."},{"pageContent":" Thus, you should also understand that initiating ritual activity will bepointless prior to witnessing a sign of accomplishment.Alternatively, when performing the reparation and supplication rite of theprotectors in the evening or afternoon session, the protectors are to bevisualized in the periphery surrounding the celestial mansion. Alternatively,you may visualize yourself as the heruka and visualize the protectors in thespace in front of you, situated in the charnel ground surrounding the palace.Having done so, you may then present supplications and offerings. You may alsofollow these steps in the context of covenant proclamations and Tenma goddessofferings.It will suffice to perform the departure and absorption of the protectors at theconclusion of offering the session torma, in the final section of the Dharmaprotector ritual. It is also suitable to perform these at the end of the entireritual, together with the postritual proceedings.When dispatching tormas, the person holding them should shift or move slightlyaway from the row. Finally, the ritual master should make the gesture of holdingthem aloft with his hands, and then scatter flowers. Then, on the roof of theretreat house, or outside to the northeast, they should be offered on a tormastand in the appropriate manner, facing either outward or inward depending ontheir mundane or transcendent character. The manner of hurling them as magicalweapons, in the context of violent rites, should be performed according to thepith instructions.In particular, there is a special ancillary practice that is to be carried outby those who wish to swiftly assimilate the two accumulations based on theskillful means of the ultimate, secret path of the uncommon vajra vehicle. Thispractice is the gathering offering. There are different categories according towho or what gathers. The Vajra Explanatory Tantra of the Magical Web explains: > A gathering of all companions> Is called a “gathering of an assembly of practitioners.”> A complete array of sense pleasures> Is explained to be a “gathering of sense pleasures.”> An assembly of all deities and oath-bound protectors> Is explained to be a “gathering of a great assembly.”> Swiftly perfecting the two accumulations> By enjoying all of it without attachment> Is definitively explained to be a “great gathering.” If means and wisdom are inseparable, such an assembly is referred to as a “feastgathering.” Just an equal number of means and wisdom, relying on an imaginedwisdom seal, should be construed as a mere approximation. If means and wisdomhave not been unified, such an assembly is not known as a feast gathering ofḍākas and ḍākinīs.Moreover, an assembly of sublime beings who have unified means and wisdom inthis manner is referred to as a “feast gathering of fortunate people.” Agathering of the five materials for food and drink, clothes and jewelry, dancingand singing, ritual union and ritual liberation is a “feast gathering ofpleasurable materials.”The wisdom maṇḍala, along with the support, the supported, and the protectors,is the support for spiritual accomplishments, which is also depicted as an imageand meditated upon. This is termed a “feast gathering of delighted deities.” The“great gathering” is added to these three, making four in total. The greatgathering involves perfecting the collection of merit by partaking in theaforementioned gatherings without attachment and perfecting the collection ofwisdom by embracing the gatherings with nondual wisdom.The vajra siblings, an assembly without samaya breaches, should, moreover,relinquish heedless joking, commotion, and the like and, with the expression ofthe austerity of innnate awareness, take their seats after performingprostrations to the assembly of elders and to the maṇḍala. The Compendiumexplains: > Impure materials, which are connected> With misconduct and flaws from lapses,> Should be abandoned like a snake in your lap,> Banished far away with foxlike vigor. Thus, impure materials, meaning types of material obtained from wrong livelihoodand so forth, are unfit as feast substances and should be abandoned as such.Those who degrade the choice offering by, for instance, allowing the feast to beeaten before it is offered are referred to as “wolves of the feast gathering.”Those who loot the leftovers are also termed this way. Thus, unerringly observewhat is to be taken up and relinquished.Since the five meats and the five nectars, or meat and beer, are indispensable,you should collect as much as you are able. These are mentioned by their secretnames in The Galpo Tantra: > Vajra life, galchi,> Jamde, datrol, dagye,> Tsetri, dzagad, dzakti,> Branmo, shammo, kuntugyu,> Amra, gundrum, agaru,> Naling, gegye, and so forth are to be gathered. And also: > Appearance, great means, is the supreme life.> Emptiness, knowledge, is the essential basis.> Their nondual combination is the heart substance. In this statement “life” refers to rice flour and so forth, “essential basis”refers to beer and so forth, while “combination” refers to food made from thesetwo. To elaborate, Venerable Lord Atīśa said: > There will be no merit in Tibet.> They skimp on their torma ingredients. Likewise, it is said that skimping on feast offering foods is also unsuitable.Rather, prepare exactly as much as you yourself would eat.In the preceding quote “vajra life” is food. “Galchi” is a concoction of variousspices. “Jamde” is milk. “Datrol” can refer to butter, cream cheese, orbuttermilk. “Dagye” is curd and fried dough. “Tsetri” is a leafy vegetable.Madāna, pache, and “dzagad” are beer. Balom, “dzakti,” and māṁsa are meat.“Branmo” is vegetable. “Shammo” is diluted beer. “Kuntugyu” is salt. “Amra” ishuman meat. “Gundrum” is elephant meat. “Agaru” is horse meat. “Naling” is cowmeat. “Gegye” is dog meat.In summary, collect whatever types of edible ingredients and beverages, suchas garlic, herbs, and fruit, that your budget allows. The feast materials shouldnot be placed on the bare ground. Instead, on the surface of flayed human skin,the pelt of a wild animal, or a drawing, arrange the edibles to your right andthe beverages to your left using a skull cup, a jewel vessel, or the like.Anoint them with feast beer, and then with blessed vase water or clean water.Next, purify them by anointing them with the nectar of the inner offerings andexpel obstructors, thereby cleansing them of stains and faults and blessingthem. However, it is said that the inner offerings are not to be sprinkled onthe fivefold outer offering, nor on the rakta and the effigy. As indicated bythis, it has been said: > In general, even just anointing the torma and so forth with medicine and rakta> has multiple functions. Like adding the active ingredient to a medicine, it> will invoke the mind-stream of the yidam deity and the like, while cleansing> away stains and impurities, removing obstructors, making offerings, and> conferring blessings. Following this, imagine the five syllables on a sun disc, representing theuniverse, and the food, representing its inhabitants; then purify, increase, andtransform the food with the mantra and mudrā of the three syllables and soforth, thus blessing it as the sense pleasure goddesses. Next, emanating lightrays from you, gather all the vital essences of the sense pleasures in therealms of the worlds and dissolve them into the feast substances. This is saidto be an essential point.In general, it is suitable even to offer a feast gathering, torma, and so forthby means of the deity of the session breaks. But if you perform an abridgedversion in the evening session, visualize an activity deity resembling thecentral deity, which emerges from the heart of the central deity, settles in theeastern foyer of the maṇḍala, and then performs a feast, leads the consciousnessof obstructors and enemies to a higher state, and so on.Alternatively, imagine that the same activity deity settles in the charnelground in the outer northeast perimeter and there awakens the assembly of thethree roots and guardians, which fill all of space like clouds amassing in thesky. This includes the deities of the maṇḍala and those deities who have beeninvited as guests from the buddhafields in the ten directions.The Galpo Tantra explains: > First, make offerings with the six sense pleasures.> Second, make confession with the nectar of sacred substance.> Third, give the form aggregate to enemies and obstructors. Thus, it is said one should project in three parts the choice offerings thathave been set aside, though four parts are also taught. Whatever the case, beginby imagining that the sense pleasure goddesses fill all of space and makeofferings to the field of merit with an inconceivable variety of offeringclouds. This pleases the deities and, in turn, perfects the two accumulations.For the middle step of confession, visualize yourself confessing all degenerate,broken, faulty, and lapsed samaya vows while offering the five meats, the fivenectars, and the like as samaya substances in form, but as the nature of wisdomnectar in essence. Through this, those of the field of merit are pleased andregard you lovingly. Imagine that all your faults are thereby completelycleansed, and that breaches with the wisdom deity are purified.To conclude, if there is no separate effigy it will suffice to, at least,separate the makings for an effigy off from the feast food before blessing it.If this has not been done, then after offering the feast, as the nature ofnectar, the effigy can be carved from the back of the feast dough and arrangedfacing upward. Next, imagine that through saying HŪṂ the sense pleasuregoddesses of the feast gather into you, and summon, chain, bind, and intoxicatethe enemies and obstructors. Finally, imagine that, after the consciousness hasbeen delivered, the assembly of wrathful deities enjoys the remaining bodilysupport as vajra samaya food, then anoint it with nectar and offer it.There is also a tradition in which a reparation rite is performed before thechoice offerings are set aside. However, in this context, the practice traditionof Minling clearly makes more sense.Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche said, “The feast offering is like offering food anddrink as hospitality for a guest, while the reparation is like giving wealth,meaning a gift of material goods.”The fourth part is the choice sky offering. For this offering anoint thearranged feast substances with medicine and rakta, make offerings to theprotectors of the pure realms and so forth, and offer the choice sky offering ina clean place outside. In some treasures it is taught that this offering servesto bring about a fulfillment in the unity of the relative and ultimate truths.However, in the general transmitted teachings and treasures the fourth part isconstrued as the pure leftovers.For the fifth part the ritual assistant holds the substances of means andknowledge with arms crossed and offers them to the ritual master, who firstmakes the circular lotus mudrā then accepts them with the three-pointed mudrā.Next, the assistant gradually distributes them to the entire assembly, startingfrom the front row. Imagining these to be the five meats and the five nectars,everyone enjoys them in the manner of an internal burnt offering rite.Thereafter, aspiration prayers are made.Next, without hoarding anything, collect leftovers from those assembled,beginning from the last row. The Galpo Tantra states: > In the intermediate direction of the northeast, the maṇḍala of leftovers is> arranged,> On flayed human skin, a half-moon of rakta, and an E . . . Thus, it is said that to the northeast or southwest of the maṇḍala you shouldarrange a round disc of scented unguents for peaceful deities, or an image ofthe source of phenomena and a half-moon drawn on flayed human skin for wrathfuldeities. Upon it arrange the pure leftovers, which are the fourth part of thechoice offering set aside earlier in the feast. Add to this half of theliberation section, together with the impure leftovers, placing them on the topand bottom, respectively. Present the choice offering to the seven upperobjects. With the impure offerings of the Great Glorious One and practitionersmake offerings to the seven lower objects.Visualize a celestial mansion, with gates, inside a vast dark-blue triangle thatconstitutes the outer perimeter of the maṇḍala of leftovers. Inside thisvisualize the thirty miraculous deities of the feast gathering, which are thefive buddha families, the territorial entities, and the door guardians calledthe “seven upper objects.” Imagine that an OṂ situated on a moon disc on theleftover torma radiates and absorbs light, causing the leftover torma to swellinto a heap of nectar, the secret sense pleasures.Imagine that the seven lower objects, such as Ḍākiṇī Gingling and the others,are invited with the sound of shrill whistling and the king-of-desire mudrā.They arrive inside the triangular perimeter in a dark flurry, like ravensdescending on carrion. Overpower them with the mudrā of the heruka’s vajragaruḍa wings. Offer them seats with the lotus mantra and mudrā. Make themsubservient with the horse-faced mantra and mudrā. To the guests, seated in thefive groupings of their respective families, make general offerings and sprinklethem with medicine and rakta. Arouse certainty through proclaiming therationale. Then pour it on the many specific choice offering tormas and theimpure tormas, thus connecting the choice offerings and the leftovers. Moreover,it is also said that you should blend below in the context of pacifying,enriching, and magnetizing, and blend above in the context of wrathful activity.If the ritual master has realized the view, he or she should retain the pride ofbeing the central deity and, while visualizing the upper palate as Hayagrīva,the lower palate as Yoginī, and the nectar of the mind of awakening as flowingfrom their point of union, he or she should spray the offerings with saliva. Inthe case of an ordinary ritual master, sprinkling the offerings with medicineand rakta will suffice, thereby blessing them.At night place a candle in the torma to protect from confrontations during thenight. Next, make offerings and entrust the lower objects with enlightenedactivity by calling them by name. Finally, the ritual assistant, wearing a hatand shoes, should carry the impure leftovers to a location seventy paces outsidethe retreat house, since this is where the demons eat, and clean off the tormatray there. It is said that the tradition of dedicating the water used to cleanis not necessary. At the end, absorb the five buddha families of the upperobjects into yourself. Let the other guests depart and the maṇḍala bereabsorbed.A slightly different approach is taught in The Maṇḍala Ritual of ViśuddhaHeruka: > Vividly and clearly visualize the leftover torma as the seven upper deities.> Imagine that various clouds of offerings appear from the assembly of torma> deities and that you offer them to the deities. The torma deities then> dissolve into you and the torma becomes a swirling ocean of nectar. Next,> invite the seven lower objects and make offerings to the five groups of buddha> families. Then spit on the impure torma and dedicate it. In the context of pacifying, visualize the five male consorts of the buddhafamilies with their respective seats in the center and four directions of themaṇḍala of the leftovers, and thus bless the torma. Invite the thirty-twoḍākinīs, imagining that they join with the five buddhas. Then, having madeofferings with flowers and so forth, offer the torma.The method for making offerings to the lower objects is taught next. Certaintreasure teachings only teach how to dedicate to the lower objects and nothingmore. Whatever the case, when practicing for a specific number of days, holdingthe leftovers in the northeast of the maṇḍala as ransom serves the purpose ofhastening activity. In this context, the seven upper objects are as taught inThe Galpo Tantra: > That which is invoked from basic space,> That which is properly blessed,> Great means revealed as the male consorts,> Knowledge present as the female consorts,> The eight Kori wrathful goddesses,> The local great Tramen goddesses,> And the four wisdom-door guardians—> This is the maṇḍala of the seven upper objects. The Galpo Tantra also teaches the seven lower objects: > The thirty-two that miraculously travel through the sky,> The eight great Ging that take pleasure in union and liberation,> The three Tsar of Laṅka that offer their full realization,> The eight radiant goddesses that harm body, speech, and mind,> The seven demons, rakṣasa, and mātṛkā, and the four sisters—> The sixty-four beings are the objects who are messengers.> They are also the six objects that have dominion over leftovers.> Twenty-eight have dominion over the choice and leftover offerings. In particular, in the context of accumulating one hundred feast offerings, youshould repeat everything beginning from the blessing all the way through theconclusion of the leftovers. However, it will suffice to do the food offeringjust once afterwards. Alternatively, Goshi Geshe has said that, according to thepractice tradition of Minling, there is also an approach to offering food inwhich offerings are presented to the ritual master and, immediately afterimagining that he has partaken of it, the food is dedicated together with theleftovers. Goshi Geshe has said that it is good to accumulate numbers of suchfood offerings.Jigme Lingpa has taught: > It is said that such feast offerings involve six kinds of satiation. Those of> the field of merit are satiated with offerings. The practitioners are satiated> with vajra food and drink. The wheel of wisdom is satiated with the pure> essence of nectar. The deities in the maṇḍala of the body are satiated with> the wisdom of empty bliss. The outer and inner ḍākinīs are satiated with the> melody of song. And the haughty, elemental spirits who perform activities are> satiated with torma. Finally, imagine that the mundane guests of the feast gathering and the wisdombeings depart. You reabsorb the samaya beings and then dissolve them into yourheart center as the central deity. Alternatively, it is also suitable to performthe departure and absorption together with the postritual proceedings.As for the benefits of the feast gathering, The Vajra Net states: > Among all merits, the feast offering is supreme.> In this life you will accomplish all you wish> And obstructors and obstacles will be pacified.> In a future life you will be born in a knowledge holder buddhafield> Or attain the state of Samantabhadra. Thus, the deities being practiced will be pleased, the two accumulations of thepractitioner will be perfected, and all lapsed and broken samaya vows will berestored, such that you will become equal in fortune to the heruka.Now I will offer a brief explanation of the topic of ritual liberation thatoccurs in this context. In general, there are many opinions about major andminor supreme objects of liberation. However, roughly speaking, a major supremeobject is an auspicious and pure field, meaning a seventimes-reborn human, whilea minor supreme object is a field of compassion, an enemy or obstructor includedamong the ten fields and the seven lapsed ones. The ten fields are outlined in AClarification of Commitments: > Enemies of the three jewels, opponents of the master,> Violators, breakers, and transgressors of commitments,> Those who arrive at the assembly, who are harmful to all,> Those hostile to the commitments, wicked beings,> And those in the three lower realms:> These ten should the practitioner take on. The seven lapsed ones are outlined as follows: > Those lapsed from the sublime disparage the master and spiritual siblings.> Those lapsed from the Buddha’s word reject cause and effect.> Those lapsed from the meaning view the two truths as separate.> Those lapsed through action punish the blameless.> Those lapsed through marks hold biases about the Dharma.> Those lapsed through desire shamelessly steal and destroy.> Those lapsed through being misguided cause sentient beings to suffer. Taking any such enemy or obstructor as your model, sculpt a dough effigy withthe appropriate characteristics. As an auspicious connection for the troops ofsaṃsāra to retreat, lay it down supine with its head facing southwest and itsfeet facing northeast or, alternatively, as though facing nirvāṇa and turningaway from saṃsāra, lay it down with its head on the ground and its face directedtoward you. Next, anoint it with rakta; then enter your protective citadel.Then arrange the repelling vajra forces and make sure that the following ninefactors are complete: > ▶ The three types of bravery: the bravery of the body as divine form, the> bravery of ineffable speech, and the bravery of nonoriginating mind.> ▶ The three confidences: confidence in the view free of extremes, confidence> in meditation beyond intellect, and confidence in conduct that is automatic.> ▶ The three ferocities: an awareness sharper than a spear, which pierces> through arrogant external entities; an awareness like a honed weapon, which> cuts through internal afflictions; and an awareness like a strong wind, which> scatters the cloud formations of concepts. Replete with these nine factors, summon whichever enemy or obstructor is thetarget, imagine that he or she is actually present, then dissolve your enemyinto the effigy. Next, commence the ritual of liberation based on the viewcomprising the fortress of suchness, meditation comprising a ravine ofmeditative absorption, and conduct comprising the life force of compassion. Itis said in a tantra: > The samaya vow of liberating with compassion> Does not mean to kill and suppress. Accordingly, keep compassion as your basic motivation and unimpeded anger asyour temporary motivation. For the crucial point of irreversibility, visualizeyourself as the heruka. For the crucial point of invincibility, visualize theritual dagger as the Supreme Son. For the sake of hostility, visualize theeffigy as the actual target.Now, to cleanse away the target’s lifespan, visualize that inside the heart ofthe visualized target is consciousness, the substance of life force, which isthe pure essence of blood the size of a sparrow’s head. At its center is thesupport of the target’s lifespan, a white A in the nature of light. At thecenter of that is a drop, inside of which is the support of consciousness, thelife force syllable, a green NRI. Visualizing three HŪṂ syllables at the pointof the ritual dagger and three PHAṬ syllables underneath them, strike thelifespan support at its heart center with the dagger. The NRI, together with theA, collect on the point of the ritual dagger with a white flash. Then, bypointing the ritual dagger back toward yourself, the A syllable dissolves into aHŪṂ at your own heart, causing you to become brilliant and radiant. This isthe command over lifespan.Next, imagine that the life force syllable NRI dissolves into the three HŪṂsyllables at the point of the ritual dagger and is projected to the GreatGlorious One in Akiniṣṭha by the three PHAṬ syllables underneath. The NRI thendissolves into his heart center. Following this, from among the three HŪṂsyllables, the blue HŪṂ of the all-ground, together with the HŪṂ that is thelife force of enlightened mind, melt into light. Together with the red HŪṂ ofthe afflicted mind, they dissolve into the A at the throat. Both the A and thewhite HŪṂ of the mental consciousness then dissolve into the OṂ at the crown,which itself melts into light. Fused together, this descends to the space of themother by way of the horse of the spinal column. It is thus born as the son ofthe Victorious One. This is the command over purification.Following this, imagine that the physical support left behind is graduallydismembered, starting from the right foot for men, and from the left foot forwomen, and anointed with nectar. Next, imagine that, while dancing, thedevourer, the lotus Gingmo, along with its emanations, gives the liberatedofferings to the deities of the maṇḍala, thereby pleasing and delighting them.The offerings should be made as taught by Minling Terchen: > One part is to be given as an averting torma. One part is to be offered when> inciting the deities to avert. One part is to be mixed in with the pure and> impure leftover tormas. In this way, as the results of liberation there are three satisfactions: (1) youare satisfied by the vital essence of life, (2) the enemy is satisfied by havinghis or her consciousness elevated, and (3) the deities are satisfied throughbeing given flesh and blood. Thus, the procedure for the ritual of killing is torend asunder the three unions of deity and support, body and mind, and flesh andbones. Kongtrul has said: > The main factor in such violent activity is the end of the three activities of> protecting, averting, and killing. You should conclude protecting with> suppressing, averting with hurling, and killing with burning. When invoking the deities, invoke their enlightened mind-streams by visualizingthe torma as the deity and anointing it with medicine and rakta. Imagine that,from the basic space of the great peace of the dharma body, the form bodiesarise in a wrathful manner for the benefit of beings and unflaggingly carry outenlightened activity with ferocity and urgency.In the context of a covenant proclamation as well, bless the torma by anointingit with medicine and rakta and regularly offer it in the manner that you offertorma to the male, female, and hermaphroditic oath-bound protectors. During thespecial circumstances of wrathful ritual activity you should hurl the torma as amagical weapon. Anoint the torma of the local Tenma goddesses with the waterused to cleanse the torma tray, invite the twelve Tenma goddesses to the outsideof the retreat house with light rays from your heart center, and please themwith suitable substances. Thereafter, have the ritual assistant go to a placeseventy paces away and dispose of the torma, then send the guests back to wherethey came from. Next, put the torma tray upside down at the end of the row andupon it visualize the world system of the universe in the form of the syllable Eand a triangle, and that the enemy or demon is suppressed there. Following this,visualize the torma tray as Mount Meru and, on top of it, the sentient beingsthat inhabit the universe as the Supreme Steed Heruka. With this, imagine thathe performs a vajra dance, thus concluding the ritual. Some additional minor points are mentioned in The Condensed Realization: > Do not wear another person’s clothing until reaching accomplishment or your> accomplishment will dissipate. If you eat food from the hand of someone> possessed by a demon, accomplishment will be delayed. Do not move your seat or> the signs of heat will vanish. If you protect another, your power will> deteriorate. If you wash your old clothes or your body, spiritual attainments> will vanish.> If you cut your hair or nails, the power of mantra will deteriorate. If you> converse with others, mantras will not accrue in number. Especially, do not> converse with those with lapsed samaya vows, those who commit misdeeds, those> who are polluted, and the like. If you do recitations in a loud voice, their> potency will deteriorate and the subtle elemental spirits will fall> unconscious. Thus, recite in a whisper. Do not count prayer beads on your> chest while lying on your back. Do not blow on your prayer beads. If the> Dharma is preached in the retreat house, signs of accomplishment will not> appear.> If you make a commitment for a long duration obstacles will arise. Thus, start> with short periods and extend them. Except for during killing and averting> rites, do not expel saliva and mucus or a breach of samaya vows will enter> into the mantra. Do not expel them on a passageway or your voice will be> overpowered. Do not sleep during the day or there will be many problems. Do> not expel bodily waste where people can see it or on a passageway.> Do not show the accomplishment substance to others. Do not give away the> substance of spiritual accomplishment. When finished, give a thanksgiving> offering. Do not abruptly leave the retreat. Do not be distracted, disturb the> body, speech, and mind, or do busy work. To be distracted by ordinary> activities is referred to as “being impervious in a negative way,” while being> distracted by other virtuous activities is termed “being impervious in a> positive way.” Furthermore, it is also said: > If the tongue is not agile when reciting mantra, bathe and observe proper> cleanliness. Thoroughly scrape the phlegm off the tongue and, each session,> apply either long pepper or black pepper powder to the tongue. With the> second-to-last finger completely smear the powder all over the top of the> tongue. Doing this for a few days will help.> Regularly replenish the offerings, but do not replace them. On sacred days,> collect the old offerings that have not been thrown out and replace them. If> torma and offerings are not blessed as soon as they are set out, obstructors> will enter into them. Thus, anoint them with clean water and bless them.> Ensure that there is nothing between you and the torma. Ensure that the torma> is not too far away, that it has a stand, is not crooked, and that its> vertical arrangement is not in disarray, and so forth. Do not place an empty> vessel on the grass. By holding the collateral torma the deity and spiritual> accomplishments will gather. By holding the Dharma protector torma in the> morning and discarding it in the evening activities will be swift and> spiritual attainments will be conferred. When discarding the torma do not let> it face outward. Offer it on an outside torma stand with the torma facing> inward. Do not direct the torma tray outward either and do not wash it until> accomplishment has appeared.> In the context of a magical weapon rite, face the torma outward and also clean> the tray of the tormas related to ransoms, karmic debts, and so forth. In> general, do not hurl a pacifying torma as a magical weapon. Do not carry> enriching and magnetizing tormas far away. In order to remove obstacles> related to travel, discard the torma in the direction you will travel. Discard> tormas for deceiving death and karmic debts in the four directions. Place the> expelling tormas that remove obstructors farther away. Hurl wrathful tormas as> magical weapons to liberate enemies and obstructors.> In particular, offering Dharma protector offering tormas and so forth in burnt> offering rites, such as during a smoke offering, is extremely profound. Even> if you do not, carry them to a clean place where there is no bodily waste from> humans, dogs, or pigs and clean them there. Do not leave them for the> poisonous fangs of dogs, rats, and the like. Do not exchange items with anyone> else. If something must come inside the retreat space, wait a day and bring it> in gradually. At that time, if you have various dreams early in the retreat,> they are deluded appearances. Thus, focus on meditative absorption. If they> occur later, they are signs of pollution. Thus, assiduously recite the> hundred-syllable mantra. Now I will explain the meanings of mantras that occur in some ritual texts. Emeans “here.” ARALI means “play.” HRĪNG HRĪNG is a symbolic phrase that means“assemble.” SAMAYA means “commitment.” TIṢṬA means “firmly.” LHAN means“reside!” PŪJA means “to offer.” HO means “delight.” SARVA PAÑCA AMṚTA means“everything as the five nectars.” KARAM means “power.” KAHĪ means “partake.”MAHĀRAKTA PŪJA KAHĪ means “Partake of the offering of great blood.” BODHICITTAis “the mind of awakening.” MAHĀSŪKHA is “great bliss.” DHARMADHĀTU is “basicspace of phenomena.” MAHĀPŪJA is “great offering.” OṀ VAJRA AMṚTA KUṆḌALI HANAHANA HŪṂ is “Strike, strike where the vajra nectar collects!” SARVA ŚATRUM is“all enemies.” MĀRAYA is “Totally kill!” A is “nonorigination.” HO is “pleased.”MAHĀ is “great.” SŪKHA is “bliss.” Alternatively, in Avabhraṁśa, ALI is “cookedfood.” ULI is “drink.” TALI is “raw food.” TAPALI is “to mix.” Now, for the four lunar sacred days when virtuous activities are multiplied.From the first to the fifteenth of the final winter month of Māgha, the firstMongol month, is the sacred time frame when Buddha showed miracles. The seventhday of the final spring month of Vaiśākha, the fourth Mongol month, is thesacred day when Buddha was born. The fifteenth day of that month is the sacredday when Buddha became enlightened and passed away. The fourth day of the middlespring month of Āṣāḍha, the sixth Mongol month, is the sacred day when Buddhaturned the Wheel of the Dharma. The fifteenth of that month is the sacred daywhen Buddha entered the womb. The twenty-second day of the middle autumn monthof Āśvina, the ninth Mongol month, is the sacred day when Buddha descended fromthe god realm. The entire months in which these days occur are sacred periods.Moreover, the third day of the middle spring month of Caitra, the third Mongolmonth, is the time when Buddha preached The Wheel of Time. The fifteenth of thatmonth is the time when Buddha preached the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras andothers, in addition to many tantras. It is said that the full moon, new moon,and eighth days of the lunar month are always sacred days of Amitābha, BuddhaŚākyamuni, and Medicine Buddha, respectively. Alternatively, Lochen Dharmaśrīsaid: > Externally, during the three days of the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of> the waxing period and during the twenty-fifth, twenty-ninth, and new moon days> of the waning period the ḍākinīs circulate to the three external places.> Internally, these are times when there is a special circulation of energies in> the channels. In particular, on the tenth during the day and on the> twenty-fifth during the night the accomplished ḍākinīs convene at the places> of practitioners. Thus, in order to accomplish whatever ritual you initiate,> exert yourself at those times. CONCLUDING RITUALS Choose an auspicious day to end your retreat. In the last session of the day,before you plan to leave the retreat, begin by setting out a fresh offeringtorma along with other excellent offerings, such as the materials needed for agathering offering. Following this, perform an extensive gathering offering,fulfillment and confessions, and other such rituals. In the early morningsession on the following day, get up early and perform the ritual as it is laidout in the text you are using. Next, perform a gathering offering, fulfillmentceremony, and dedication of the torma. Then take the Dharma protector torma thatyou have been using on a daily basis and either burn it or take it to a cleanplace and perform the covenant proclamation and Tenma goddess offerings, alongwith the dance of Hayagrīva.When taking the spiritual accomplishments, replenish the offerings and place akapāla filled with fermented liquor, Dharma medicine, and dairy products on theshrine. Then light the offering lamp that you use on a daily basis. Dedicate atorma to the obstructing forces and, after they have been expelled, visualize astable protective dome, consecrate the offerings, and perform the descent ofblessings. Once these steps are complete, imagine that all the spiritualaccomplishments of the enlightened body, speech, and mind of the victorious onesthroughout the ten directions and their heirs coalesce in the form of the threesyllables and white, red, and dark-blue nectar, which rain down upon the tormaand nectar, dissolving into them.Next, recite the approach mantras of the main deity and the entire retinue andrecite an appropriate addendum to the mantra, such as KĀYA VĀKA CITTA SARVASIDDHI PHALA HŪṂ. At the break of day, instantaneously visualize the oldoffering tormas as the deity. Alternatively, in this context you may alsoseparate the wisdom maṇḍala from the samaya being and merge it indivisibly withthe torma.With the knowledge that the torma is the deity, think of it as the source fromwhich you receive empowerment and spiritual accomplishments. To begin, presentofferings and praise, and perform general confessions, such as the “SupremeWisdom Form,” along with the confession liturgy from the text you are using.Following these steps, purify whatever enmity may be present by reciting thehundred-syllable mantra twenty-one times and confess any impaired or brokensamaya vows, thereby purifying your mind-stream and making it a fit receptaclefor spiritual accomplishments.Next, recite an appropriate supplication prayer to invoke the enlightened mindof the deity. Hold the torma in your hands and recite the liturgy for invokingthe spiritual accomplishments. Then offer the following prayer with intensedevotion: > Supreme deity, I have shared a connection with you in my previous lives. Now,> once again, I have completed the samaya vows of approach and accomplishment. I> have completed the proper number of days and, with daybreak near, now the time> to bestow the spiritual accomplishments has arrived. In accordance with the> pledges you have made in the past, please pacify adverse conditions and> hostile forces with the boundless blessings of your wisdom, love, and power.> Please cause all positive qualities to develop fully and grant me mastery over> the splendor and riches of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Please vanquish all harmful> forces, enemies, obstructive forces, and demonic beings. Please bestow upon me> the common spiritual accomplishments, including the unobstructed> accomplishment of the infinite activities subsumed within the four forms of> enlightened activity. In particular, please grant my main objective: the fruit> of the culmination of abandonment and realization, the embodiment of the> spontaneously accomplished twofold benefit, the unsurpassed spiritual> accomplishment of the Great Seal, the union of bliss and emptiness,> inseparable in essence from your own vajra body, speech, and mind, supreme> yidam deity! Please bestow these upon me this very moment, without delay! With these words, imagine that all the supreme and ordinary spiritualaccomplishments emerge in the form of rays of light from the three places of theassembly of deities. Dissolving into your own three places, the light rays bringyou all the spiritual accomplishments you desire. Touch the torma to your threeplaces and take the four empowerments. Imagining that the torma deity thendissolves into light and becomes nectar, dip the material torma into the nectarand drink the nectar with the conviction that you are equal in status to theyidam deity.Alternatively, when there is a frontal visualization, there is no need toseparate the wisdom being of the self-visualization. In such cases you shouldhold up the substances of the spiritual accomplishments with your hands. Invokedby the blissful sounds of the passionate union of the assembly of deitiesvisualized in front of you, all the victorious ones throughout space gather andtheir bodhicitta, transforming into the essence of nectar, rains down. Thenectar completely fills up the bodies of the deities in front and their bodiesbegin to emit the common and supreme spiritual accomplishments.The spiritual accomplishments of enlightened form emerge as deities, enlightenedspeech as seed syllables, enlightened mind as symbolic implements, and theirbodhicitta, the nature of pristine great bliss, takes the form of five-coloredrainbow light. Inseparable from the torma, all of these dissolve into the fourplaces of the self-visualization, bringing with them empowerments, blessings,and the common and supreme spiritual accomplishments. Imagining all this, enjoythe consecrated substances.Following this, present offerings and songs of gratitude and, in this particularcontext, offer a peaceful fire puja offering to make up for any omissions oradditions made during the recitation. Offer the substances using only theprimary mantra. To petition for the retreat, recite the following: > May any lack of clarity in my meditative absorption, impurity in the ritual,> errors with the mantra and mudrā, and any additions, omissions,> contradictions, or confusion be cleansed and purified. In this way, ten percent of the recitation should be performed as a fire pujaoffering that utilizes substances and mantra. Since fire puja offerings arepraised in all the higher and lower classes of tantra as important for thedevelopment of your practice, the fire puja offering must not be dispensed with.During the dissolution stage, dissolve the visualization beginning with theprotective dome and complete the concluding rituals. This comprises thecompletion of the retreat on an inner level. Next, maintain an uninterruptedschedule of practice sessions for three, seven, or another appropriate number ofdays. As a gesture of gratitude, perform as many gathering offerings,fulfillment ceremonies, and so forth as you can, along with dedications,aspiration prayers, and so on. When you physically complete the retreat, ariseas the deity in the ensuing attainment, don armor, and protect the body. Go tothe boundary of the retreat and set out a white torma and offering cup in frontof the poles of each of the guardian kings. Then present offerings and praisesof gratitude, request them to depart, and dismantle the poles. You may thenproceed to meet a few of your companions who have received the same teachingsand who abide by the samaya vows. These and other such details can be understoodaccording to the system of The Universal Secret. If you are able, you can makeofferings, as represented by presenting “The Smoke Offering to the Kings,” andother such offerings, in an uncovered space to the lords of the four places, ingeneral, or to specific deities, as well as offering alms to the destitute.In some recitation manuals, it is taught that the substance of the spiritualaccomplishments should be divided into four portions and enjoyed by your guru,the knowledge holders, yourself, and companions with whom you share samaya vows.After daybreak, perform the rituals for the daily torma, the torma for theprotectors, and so forth.The residual that has been imprisoned should also be offered here. Of the threeportions of the practice torma, one part should be hidden as treasure in theretreat space, one part should be offered as material for the fire pujaoffering, and one part should be mixed with another torma and left outside.Remind the Tenma of their oath and complete their practice in its entirety, thenproceed with the stages of dissolution and so on, up to the prayer ofauspiciousness. Next, perform the amending fire puja, take down the guardiankings’ poles, and present offerings to the local protectors. Though it is taughtthat you should perform these steps in this order, in practice it suffices touse whichever structure is most convenient.Concerning the dedication, the unique feature of the skillful means of SecretMantra is that you accumulate as much merit by performing the ritual one timeeach session as you would normally accumulate in an entire great eon. For thisreason, dedicate all the virtue you have gathered, are gathering, and willgather—as exemplified by the basic virtues you have already accumulated in thepast—as causes of enlightenment. To do so while imbuing the dedication with theknowledge that does not conceptualize the three spheres is the way to dedicatein a completely pure manner. Nevertheless, for beginners it is unlikely thatsuch a dedication free from poison will occur, so you may also dedicate in amanner that simulates this state, thinking to yourself, “Just as the victoriousones throughout the three times and their heirs dedicated, likewise I nowdedicate this merit as well.” Reciting the dedication liturgy with this attitudeis a unique method that will ensure that the basic virtues will not go to waste,but instead will develop further and further.Concerning aspiration prayers, since the enlightened activity that benefitsothers is the culminating result that you seek through the path of the supremevehicle, give voice to whatever aspirations you bear in mind. Recite anyappropriate aspiration prayers, whether long or short, and attune your mind tothe words you chant. With the superior attitude of wishing to benefit theteachings and beings, recite pure aspiration prayers to ensure that thetemporary and ultimate benefit and happiness will be vast and unceasing. It isthe unfailing reality of the interdependence of cause and result that whateveraspirations are made will be fulfilled accordingly.For auspiciousness you may recite words of auspicious interdependence whilethinking to yourself, “Through the power of the blessings, compassion, and truthof the host of deities that have been approached and accomplished—the threeroots and three jewels—may all harmful and malevolent forces be pacified, mayall positive qualities increase and develop, and may the fruits born of thisvirtue manifest vividly, beautifying the universe and its inhabitants andbringing the sublime glory and auspiciousness of benefit, happiness, virtue andgoodness.” At the same time, imagine that the victorious ones and their heirsappear in the space above you, proclaiming the auspiciousness with vajra songsand sending down a shower of flowers from all directions. These dissolve intoyou, your surroundings, your things, and so on, imbuing you with positivequalities and causing your body to take on a radiant glow. Scattering flowersbrings virtue, and goodness to all times, places, and situations.In this way, the basis for purification is your own buddha nature, which isreferred to as “potential” and “element.” The objects of purification are allthe incidental impurities, while the process of purification is the path thatunites the two stages. Following that path, you actualize the result ofpurification, which refers to all the qualities of the ground.Moreover, the various forms of absorption serve as a skillful means. When youtrain in each of these absorptions and subsequently master them, you willgradually progress through the five practices of the defiled paths ofaccumulation and joining, as well as the undefiled states of the four knowledgeholders. This comprises the definitive perfection, practice throughactualization. One who practices in this manner is referred to as a “maturestudent.”Nevertheless, even if you have yet to attain stability in meditative absorption,there is also the approach of devoted training. This involves simply meditatingon the mere forms of the development stage to the best of your ability. In thatway you can complete the preparation, main practice, and concluding activitiesof the development stage in each session, from the protective sphere to theconcluding steps of donning armor and protecting the body. The Great One ofUḍḍiyāna taught: > The view relates to scripture and reasoning. Meditation relates to experience.> Secret Mantra relates to empowerment. Blessings relate to devotion. Experience> relates to realization. Conduct relates to time. Spiritual attainments relate> to the samaya vows. The fruition relates to benefiting others. Practical> instructions relate to the guru. Practice with these nine relationships. In particular, tantra relates to practice manuals. Practice manuals relate toliturgical arrangement. Liturgical arrangement relates to the practicetradition. The practice tradition relates to the key instructions of the lineagegurus. Accomplishing the yidam deity via these relationships is the very essenceof the infinite victorious ones.Hence, with certainty about these relationships, exert yourself withoutpartiality. The Condensed Realization states: > Accomplish one buddha and you accomplish all others without practice.> Hence, exert yourself in practicing one deity without partiality.> Should you practice many with an attitude of partiality,> You will have accomplished none, and it will wear you out. In particular, it is important to arouse faith and devotion in the yidam deity.You should not have any doubt that the yidam is, in essence, your own guru, theembodiment of all the buddhas, who has shown you the three forms of kindness. Atantra states: > But the spiritual accomplishments linked to that> Are still imminent for a simpleton who has faith. And Patrul Rinpoche taught: > That which opens the door to all dharmas,> Clears away adverse circumstances for all practices,> And enhances all the instructions> Is said to be devotion. This you should know. Once you have entered into the profound practice of approach and accomplishmentin the appropriate manner, it is important to arouse the compassion of thebuddhas with heartfelt yearning.Generally speaking, the compassion of the buddhas enters sentient beings in aparticular manner. First, their compassion is everlasting and continuouslyunfolds like a flowing river. It is natural and instinctive, occurring withouteffort or thought, like sunlight. Still, when aroused and prayed to, theircompassion is like the response of a compassionate person to a beggar asking formoney and when meeting with an appropriate object—someone in need ofguidance—their compassion resembles that of a parent seeing his or her childracing toward a precipice. In this way, it allows for the victorious ones andtheir heirs to view you as their child and kin, and for the ḍākinīs and Dharmaprotectors to see you as their companion and master, respectively. That providesa unique circumstance for you to receive their blessings. Consequently, if youarouse the compassion of the buddhas and pray to them with intense, heartfeltlonging, they will be powerless not to grant you the two spiritualaccomplishments, just as the result occurs once the right causes and conditionshave come together.At that point, there are lesser, middling, and great spiritual accomplishments.The lesser spiritual accomplishments are the four enlightened activities:pacifying the eight fears, increasing the six riches, magnetizing based on thefour kinds of devotion, and the four types of wrathful activity. The eight fearsare those of fire, water, lions, elephants, snakes, flesh-eating demons,shackles, and thieves. Alternatively, the eight fears can be listed as illness,famine, fire, water, war, weapons, imperial punishment, and untimely death. Thesix riches are longevity, merit, glory, splendor, retinue, and wealth. The fourkinds of devotion are when others feel affection toward you as though seeing youas their parent, respect for you as though seeing you as their guru, fear of youas though seeing you as a king, and love for you as though seeing you as afriend. The four wrathful activities are to annihilate by wrathfully instillingfear in hordes of enemies, banishing them, killing them, and summoning them. Thefour enlightened activities, counted together with these four subcategories ofwrathful activity, are referred to as the “eight great activities.” The middlingspiritual accomplishments are mentioned in the following song: > Eye medicine, swift-footedness,> Sword, unearthing,> Pills, flight, invisibility,> And extracting essences . . . The great spiritual accomplishments are the eight qualities of mastery, asoutlined in the following passage: > Subtle body, lightness to the touch,> Pervasiveness, genuine attainment,> Complete manifestation, stability,> Mastery, and control over desirable things . . . The supreme spiritual accomplishments are the four unique enlightenedactivities: pacifying the obscurations of karma, the afflictions, and theall-ground; increasing the qualities of scripture and realization; magnetizingthe wisdom of liberation and omniscience; liberating yourself throughrealization and others with compassion. It also refers to mastering all thequalities of the paths and levels, such as the powers, clairvoyance, retention,and eloquence. Moreover, the supreme spiritual accomplishments in the temporarycontext of the path of joining are to attain the illusory form of the maturedknowledge holder; on the path of seeing, to attain the form of luminosity of theknowledge holder with power over longevity and to attain the unified form oftraining of the Great Seal knowledge holder. Ultimately, the supreme spiritualaccomplishment is to attain the unified form beyond training of thespontaneously present knowledge holder.The glorious Ngawang Trakpa writes: > Complete enjoyment, integration, great bliss, lack of inherent existence,> Being completely filled with compassion, uninterrupted, and unceasing . . . Having actualized the state of the unified vajra holder with these seven unifiedfeatures, the twofold benefit will certainly be perfected. > The treatises of the learned and the key instructions of the accomplished> Are an ocean of eloquent expositions of the profound and vast,> Billowing with countless waves of scripture and reasoning.> Inferior minds can hardly fathom its depth. > Still, hoping to benefit a few with a fortune like mine,> I have compiled the oral instructions of realized beings.> These are droplets of nectar, written with devotion and faith.> Any mistakes that I have made, I confess to the masters of the three lineages. > May the wish-fulfilling cloud of virtue gathered through these efforts> Forever appear above all beings> And shower them with unceasing benefit and happiness,> Bringing forth the sublime result of the twofold benefit. At the request of some devoted students, and motivated by the wish to help thosewith inferior minds like my own, I gathered together these instructions from therecitation manuals of various indisputably learned and accomplished masters,along with the oral instructions of my own supreme and noble guru. I, theignorant one with the title of tulku, Kunkyen Tenpe Nyima, compiled these notesin my own retreat hut at Ngepa Dongyi Gatsel Chokhor Namgyal Ling.

The great vajra-holding Conqueror has taught uncountable gateways to the Dharmain accord with the capacities of beings to be guided. The goal of all of theseis the resultant supremely secret vajra vehicle, a path that has two stages: thedevelopment stage of means and the completion stage of knowledge. Here, with theintention to help beginners, I will set aside extensive quotations and verbosityand describe in a very concise and comprehensible way the theory and practice ofthe first level, the development stage, in connection with its ritual enactment.The vajra vehicle is a part of the Great Vehicle, in fact it is its pinnacle, sofirst of all it is vital to be grounded in the motivation and conduct of theGreat Vehicle. It will not suffice to delve haphazardly straight into mantra andclaim to be doing recitation practice. Instead, we should consider this: foronce, we have now attained something so rare and valuable, a precious human lifewith its freedoms and advantages. It will, however, not last long since we arenot immortal. When and where we will die is unsure, and there are so many waysdeath can happen. We have only a few things to help us stay alive, and many ofthem can cause our death as well. When death suddenly comes around, no one canstop it. When we die, we can take nothing along with us but our positive andnegative actions. If the ripening of our tainted, unwholesome actions carries usthen into the lower realms, we will face the endless suffering of heat, cold,starvation, thirst, and enslavement. Even if wholesome, tainted actions propelus into the higher realms, we will not remain there forever; they are stillconditioned states and will end at some time. Thus, any type of birth we maytake within existence will be characterized by the three types of suffering, andwill leave us without the slightest chance of real happiness.Now we are at this juncture of paths that lead up or down, whereby our futurefate, either good or bad, lies before us. Here we should reflect on the futilityof all the pain and happiness, victory and loss, joy and sorrow that occur inour lives and conclude that the only thing for us to do is reach thefruition—liberation from this perpetual suffering. If we cannot sincerelyengender such an attitude of disenchantment, our path will not even qualify asthat of the Lesser Vehicle, let alone the Great Vehicle. Beyond this, asfollowers of the Great Vehicle, it is vital to have the noble wish to helpothers. We should thus consider the great kindness of every single beingthroughout the reaches of space, without distinction regarding friend or enemy,connected as they have been to us as our fathers, mothers, friends, andrelatives in past lives. Though all of them want only happiness, they areunaware of the means to achieve it and instead perpetuate the causes and effectsof suffering. How sad! If only they could be happy and never suffer; and howwonderful if they could swiftly attain unsurpassed, complete enlightenment!Whatever the cost, we alone must bring them to that state. However, in order tohave the power to do so, we must, by all means, first reach the level ofcomplete enlightenment ourselves. To that end we must harmoniously integrate theprofound key points of the paths of sūtra and mantra and put them into practice.It is important to have a foundation in these special points of motivation andconduct, so train by repeatedly applying them to your personal experience.Always maintain mindfulness and attentiveness, and give up the self-centerednessthat impedes them. If we do not know how to continuously use all our physical,verbal, and mental endeavors for altruism and transform them into the seeds ofawakening, we will never enter the ranks of the Great Vehicle. This precise typeof mind training is crucial at the beginning since it will not be enough just toproclaim oneself a Great Vehicle practitioner.When a person is well grounded in the Great Vehicle attitude and behavior, andis ready to enter the resultant vajra vehicle of Secret Mantra, it is first ofall necessary to receive the ripening empowerments. Without that, we are notpermitted to even hear the teachings, let alone practice them. It also does notsuffice just to receive empowerments; we must adhere to the commitments, whichconstitute their life force. If we do not adhere to them, whatever we set out todo will go wrong—it will lead us to misfortune in this life and, afterwards,land us directly in vajra hell. It is said, however, that if one is able to keepthem correctly, one will be liberated within seven lifetimes even withoutpracticing.The root of these commitments is to never transgress the bonds related to theguru’s body, speech, and mind. If we are able to constantly supplicate the guru,his blessings will automatically penetrate us and all the qualities ofexperience and realization will emerge like ice melting in springtime. All themajor and minor qualities that emerge on the Great Vehicle path are said todepend on the guru, our spiritual guide. Thus, it is important to considerwhichever main part of practice we are doing—whether the development,recitation, or completion stage—as an expression of the guru’s body, speech, andmind.Those who lack the fortune to already be motivated by this sort of renunciation,enlightened attitude, and devotion may nonetheless wish to strive in thepractice of the two stages. For them there is no way around first reaching somedegree of practical understanding of the presentations of the ground, path, andfruition continua, just as in archery one must first identify the target. Oneshould learn the elaborate version of these from the profound sūtras and tantrason the definitive meaning as well as their commentaries and instructions. We canthen also learn the specific details from the oral teachings of a qualifiedmaster who holds a lineage for them. I will definitely not be able to presentthem here in just a few words.THE BASIS OF PURIFICATION To provide a mere kernel of the basic principles for beginners, the basis ofpurification—as it is commonly taught in sūtra and mantra—is the reality ofsuchness, or the essence of the bliss-gone ones. The nature or definition ofsuchness is resolved in the Victorious One’s middle wheel of teachings in termsof the empty essence, the natural state endowed with the three liberations. Inthe final wheel of teachings suchness is expressed in terms of the manifestaspect of luminous wakefulness indivisible from the undefiled enlightenedattributes. In mantra, however, suchness is described as vajra mind, which isthe unity of these two. This refers to the intrinsic wakefulness beyondexpression that is the innate luminosity of one’s own mind.Moreover, the basis of purification can also be described as the ultimate evaṃ,emptiness with all supreme qualities, the thoroughly immutable great bliss,indivisible unified wakefulness, the all-pervasive identity, the essence that isbeyond destruction and separation, and the unconditioned nature. Everything thatmanifests arises from this basis. This includes the impure delusion we initiallyexperience as a sentient being, our mixed pure and impure experiences while apractitioner on the path, and also the entirely pure experience of enlightenedbodies and wisdoms at the fruition of buddhahood.It is said that no matter how things temporarily appear, in their true andultimate condition they remain primordially as the infinitely pure circle ofdeities. This is what is seen by the eyes of a buddha whose obscurations havebeen purified, similar to how a pair of healthy eyes perceives the white colorof a conch.THE OBJECT OF PURIFICATION This essence is primordially pure in nature, and its identity is beyond thechanges of the three times. By not recognizing suchness, however, we ascribeself-entity to its manifestations, and out of the full-blown force of erroneousfixation confused experiences emerge adventitiously. Similar to how the sun canbe covered by clouds, the true face of our essence becomes obscured, while theappearances of environments, objects, and bodies emerge unendingly. This is theobject of purification—the aspect of the truth of origin, which is karma anddisturbing emotions, as well as the resulting defilements. This includes, inshort, all coarse and subtle obscurations of adventitious unreal appearancesdown to their most subtle aspects. These are overcome by wisdom at theconsummation of the path, whether that of sūtra or mantra. In the presentcontext of mantra, the development stage purifies the gross aspects, while thecompletion stage purifies the extremely subtle aspects, such as the obscurationof transference related to the three appearances.THE PROCESS OF PURIFICATION The process of purification, generally speaking, is any degree of goodness thatis created through the Great Vehicle. It constitutes the cause, or method, forpurifying the fleeting stains that obscure our potential. From the perspectiveof the resultant Secret Mantra, however, it refers specifically to perceivinghow everything within appearance and existence, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, isprimordially the nature of enlightenment, the inseparability of the truths ofpurity and equality, never apart from the great sublime dharma body. Havingresolved this as the view, the process of purification is to strive in both thedevelopment and completion stages of the path, method and insight, whichharmonize with this view.THE RESULT OF PURIFICATION As the path is completed by training in this way, we become free of thecloudlike, adventitious obscurations that appear, yet do not exist. At thatpoint we transform and become the essence of the twofold purity. This is theidentity of the three bodies of enlightenment and the actualization of all thequalities that abide within the ground. It is known as the effect of separation.Therefore, from the perspective of the essential reality of things, our essencedoes not change during the occasions of the ground, path, or fruition. In thissense, it remains without increase or decrease; nothing is ever removed from noradded to it. Furthermore, relative saṃsāric phenomena are unreal adventitiousappearances that never have existed and never will. This being the case, theyare empty forms—nonexistent deluded appearances emerging out of the power ofhabit—and are always devoid of reality. Just as a child in a dream, never havingbeen born will also never die, the intrinsic nature never increases nordisintegrates. This is the meaning of equality. I have heard the omniscientMipham Rinpoche himself say that comprehension of this is a crucial point inboth the systems of sūtra and mantra. We should therefore understand it to bethe single intended goal of the Great Vehicle paths, whether sūtra or mantra,which uniformly hold this as the single path to liberation.In short, the ground of purification is the naturally present ground, which isprimordially beyond being bound or liberated. The object of purificationconsists of fleeting and nonexistent appearances, which are the basis of deludedimputation. The path, or process of purification, is everything included in andassociated with the truth of the path, the wisdom that serves as a remedy bypurifying these appearances. The effect of separation is the quality of havingpurified delusion. In this way we should properly understand the key points ofhow these relate to one another. The ground and path are connected as that whichwe should know and what brings about this knowledge. The fruition and the pathare connected as that which we should attain and that which causes thisattainment. The ground and fruition are connected in being of a single essenceand identity. Without understanding these principles we will take the essentialnature to be merely a provisional reality and focus on it as a conditionedphenomenon, hoping that our present practice will create the cause for achievingit as a result in the distant future. Separating appearance and emptiness inthis way, we will not form even a basic understanding of the view, meditation,conduct, or fruition of the resultant path of unity, and our path will become anartificial fabrication. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that, if nothingelse, we gain some familiarity with this topic at the outset.After gaining this conviction we can enter the path. There are many suitableteachings directed toward this, such as the “five things to take as the path,”but here I will instead summarize the core points and consider the principles ofouter, inner, and secret approach and accomplishment as they are described bythe omniscient master Jampel Gyepa.First is the deity to be accomplished. The ultimate deity of reality, itself, isnaturally-existing wakefulness, the maṇḍala of the mind of awakening. Withinthis state, all phenomena of appearance and existence are primordially beyondunion and separation. Beings who do not realize this, however, experiencethemselves as different from the deity, and so become enveloped in thethoroughly binding shroud of karma and disturbing emotions. On the contrary, thedeity, with its liberated wisdom body, has manifested true reality and thusfulfilled its own benefit. By means of immeasurable wisdom, love, and ability,it appears for others’ sake in a form that may be peaceful or wrathful,representing its great aspiration and wisdom, such as Mañjuśrī or Yamāntaka,along with its emanated maṇḍala. It carries out enlightened activity unfailinglyby means of the features of its form, the knowledge mantras of its speech, andby entering into absorption mentally, thus granting any spiritual accomplishmentdesired and establishing beings definitively in the state of the lastinghappiness of liberation.To practice this imputed deity in an outer way, we visualize it, perform itsrecitation, and make offerings to it.To practice the deity on an inner level, consider the deities to be the pureessential wisdom energies and essences in the citadel of your own centralchannel. Your own impure body, speech, mind, and field of experience, on theother hand, are merely the magical display of the fluctuating energy of karma.Therefore, visualize the circle of deities as they naturally dwell in thecentral places of your channels, and practice energy and mantra indivisible.Accomplishment is then reached by focusing on the root of all this, which is theluminous dome of the heart, also known as the sphere of awakened mind, immutablegreat bliss, and unconditioned self-display.On a secret level, when you realize the truth that your own mind is originallyunborn, naturally existing wakefulness, the primordially equal basic space ofall saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, there is no other deity to accomplish whatsoever. Thedeity is thus accomplished spontaneously and without effort; it is nothing morethan a magical display that appears out of that basic space of saṃsāra andnirvāṇa. Therefore, to practice by resting evenly in natural awareness,originally beyond effort or cultivation, is the ultimate point of the profoundDharma. If you train by applying these instructions in accord with yourmeditative experiences as a practitioner, you will reach the utmost limit, theperspective of the great, primordial indivisibility of your mind and the deity.At that point it is said that you yourself become a greatly accomplished one.In short, the ground is your innate mind, intrinsic wakefulness that isoriginally beyond being bound or liberated. The ultimate fruition is whicheverdeity you are practicing, such as glorious Vajrasattva, dwelling in theUnexcelled Realm. The path consists of the practitioner appearing in the form ofthe deity by means of the imaginary development stage. If you understand thatthese three are naturally indivisible in the play of the guru’s mind—themanifest aspect of empty bliss, great wakefulness—then every true key point ofpractice is complete.The Great Lord of Secrets states, “Its rituals are unique in that they integratethe development stage rituals taught in the tantras,” which means that thedevelopment stage, with all its facets, is a complete path for purifying thehabits for the four modes of birth.The text also teaches that, “Its unique result is the capacity to develop thepower of mantra.” This is true although, generally speaking, a path that ismerely development stage will lead, at best, to achieving the level of knowledgeholder in the desire or form realms—up to great supreme worldly attribute—andaccomplishing the eight qualities such as lightness and subtleness. However, ifwe use the authentic path of definitive perfection as it is laid out in theunique teachings of the Early Translation School on the Secret Magical Web, wecan train in the path of unified development and completion from the outset,beginning with the three samādhis and progressing through the perfection of thefive experiences. In doing so, we can connect to the actual luminosity, theunified form of the deity, at the path of seeing. This is logical consideringthe explanations that even the ordinary sūtra path can eventually lead one tothe actual luminosity at the path of seeing.The text furthermore states that, “Its unique essence is the nature of blissfulmelting and emptiness.” This means that, when following the authentic path ofmeans, the form of the deity appears as the natural expression of the emptinessproduced by the blissful melting. Otherwise, for a follower of the path ofliberation, it appears as the natural expression of the union of utterlyimmutable bliss and emptiness that is complete with all supreme qualities.Finally, the text mentions that, “Its unique function is the completion ofpurification, perfection, and maturation.” In being a process of purification,the development stage path refines away and purifies the objects ofpurification, such as the three phenomena of cyclic existence, by manifesting ina similar way to them. The visualization of the seed syllable for the threeenlightened bodies perfects the fruition within the ground by resembling thenature of nirvāṇa, the result of purification. Finally, by laying the foundationfor extraordinary wisdom to dawn in one’s mind-stream, the development stagematures one for the completion stage. Thus, the development stage practice isunique in four ways. With conviction in these principles, we begin the main explanation, whichintegrates them with a ritual structure. Here there are three divisions: (1) thepreliminaries, (2) the main part, and (3) the conclusion.THE PRELIMINARIES The preliminaries consist of (1) the general and (2) the unique preliminaries.THE GENERAL COMMON PRELIMINARIES REFUGE The practice of taking refuge comes after we have engendered the genuinedisenchantment and noble attitude described above. In this case, we and allother sentient beings are those who take refuge in the guru, three jewels, andthe host of maṇḍala deities. We do so because we recognize the qualities of theobjects of refuge, and seek protection from the suffering of cyclic existence ingeneral, from selfishness in particular, and especially from ordinary, deluded,fixating thoughts. On a relative level, we take refuge by accepting the refugeobjects as teacher, path, and companions, and on an ultimate level byunderstanding that they are inseparable from our own minds. They then remain ourrefuge until we become enlightened or, in other words, until the objects ofrefuge have manifested in our mind-streams. With this understanding, visualizethe objects of refuge in the sky before you in the usual manner, and chant aloudthe refuge verses in your text three times.AROUSING THE MIND OF AWAKENING To arouse the mind of awakening in aspiration we make a commitment to theresult, wishing to attain the goal of unexcelled fruition for the sake of allbeings. To arouse it in application we make a commitment to the cause of thatfruition. These two aspects together constitute the relative type, which istaken symbolically. The ultimate type, which emerges from the power ofmeditation on ultimate reality, is to bring to mind an insight, a recognition ofthe fact that we and all other beings are equal in our primordially enlightenednature, and then to remain in meditation within that recognition without addingor omitting anything. This mind of awakening is, in short, emptiness that isintrinsically compassionate. Bring these points to mind and say the verses forarousing the mind of awakening according to your text while taking the field ofaccumulation as a witness. Afterward, train your mind in the four immeasurablequalities of: (1) love, wishing beings to be happy; (2) compassion, wishing themto be free from suffering; (3) joy, wishing them happiness devoid of suffering;and (4) equanimity, wishing them to remain with neither attachment to friendsnor hatred toward enemies.THE MEDITATION OF VAJRASATTVA Next is the meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva, which clears away adversecircumstances. Visualize Guru Vajrasattva above your head as the “power ofsupport.” Then give rise to the “power of remorse” as you sincerely regret thenegative deeds you have carried out in the past. Pledge henceforth to refrainfrom them at the cost of your life, which is the “power of resolve,” or“restoration.” For the “power of applying the antidote” imagine that yourrecitation of the hundred syllables causes a stream of nectar to flow down fromthe mantra circle in Guru Vajrasattva’s heart center. Entering you, and allothers, through the crown of your head, it fills your body and purifies you ofall your damaged and broken vows as well as concepts and obscurations. Whileintegrating the four powers of the antidote in this way, recite the hundredsyllables as many times as possible. At the end, supplicate with a sense ofshame and regret, and imagine that doing so leads Vajrasattva to melt into lightand dissolve into you. At that point, rest evenly in the state in which misdeedsand downfalls have no inherent existence.MAṆḌALA OFFERING The maṇḍala offering creates conducive circumstances. On an outer level themaṇḍala consists of the central mountain, continents, sun, moon, and the richesof the universe and its inhabitants. On an inner level it includes whatever youown—your home and valuables—while on an innermost level it refers to your bodywith its collections of aggregates, elements, and sense bases. Mentallytransform all this into a “Samantabhadra offering cloud” that is, by nature,great wisdom. Then offer it a suitable number of times, while reciting thecorresponding verses, and while bringing to mind the ultimate level of offering,the nonconceptual primordial state free from subject and object of offering.GURU YOGA Guru yoga infuses our mind-streams with extraordinary blessings. To practicethis, resolve, once and for all, that your root guru is, in fact, the embodimentof all buddhas, as it is taught in every sūtra and tantra. Recognize that yourguru has the same qualities as the Buddha, while his kindness towards you iseven greater, and then let your mind be overcome with devotion. In thispassionate state of mind, visualize your guru in the style of the “all-embodyingjewel” or, alternatively, together with all the lineage gurus, whether theyappear in tiers or surround him like a marketplace crowd. Then, along with allbeings, make a genuine offering of the seven branches, with your body, speech,and mind in unison. In this way you bow down, make offerings, confess to harmfuldeeds, rejoice in what is virtuous, request the turning of the Dharma wheel,supplicate the buddhas not to pass from their form bodies into nirvāṇa, anddedicate all virtue to unexcelled enlightenment. If there is a lineage prayer,recite it while still overwhelmed by intense devotion. At the end, use thevisualization for receiving the four empowerments and imagine that your gurumelts into light and dissolves into you. Then rest evenly, for as long as youcan, in the natural state in which the guru and your own mind are indivisible,the basic nature of great bliss, the nonconceptual state of empty luminositybeyond words. This is the ultimate guru yoga; afterwards you should makededications and the like. The meaning of the preliminaries, the method for practicing them, as well astheir precepts and benefits can be studied in the various other texts where suchthings are already described in detail.THE UNIQUE PRELIMINARIES The unique preliminaries have two parts: (1) removing adverse circumstances and(2) creating conducive circumstances.REMOVING ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES This section has two parts: (1) expelling obstructors and (2) drawing theboundary.Expelling Obstructors Like a fish leaping out of the water, visualize your mind, as the naturalexpression of emptiness, instantly in the form of a boundary deity, such as thewrathful king Hayagrīva or Vajra Rage. Cleanse and purify the obstructors’ tormainto emptiness, and imagine that within emptiness appears a jewel vessel holdingthe torma substance replete with nectar of the five sense pleasures. With OṂ,purify any impure stains, with ĀḤ, multiply the substances, with HŪṂ, transformthem into whatever enjoyments are wished for and, with HOḤ, remove any defilingstains. In this way the torma is consecrated and transformed into radiant wisdomnectar.With light rays from your heart center summon the obstructors before you andoffer them the torma with the mantra and mudrā. Command them with words of truthand, using the verse in your text, order them not to make obstacles to yourattainment of awakening; then toss the torma outside. There may be certainbeings who do not heed your command and set about making obstacles. So next, asyou continue to visualize yourself as the Wrathful King, imagine an overwhelmingtorrent of wrathful deities, weapons, and fireballs, numerous as the particlesin the universe, streaming out of your heart to expel those obstructors far, faraway. Fumigate using resin, scatter with charmed mustard seeds, chant fiercemantras, and put on a wrathful and terrifying air.Drawing the Boundary Second is to draw the boundary, which is analogous to locking the door after youhave chased out a thief. At this point the wrathful deities and weapons you havejust emanated now gather back, and as if melding together, coalesce to form avajra ground everywhere beneath you. Surrounding you like an iron mountain rangein every direction is a high and vast circular fence made of intertwinedvertical and horizontal vajras. A vajra dome that is fixed to the fence like alid encloses it above. Resembling the upper part of an Indian tent, it has ahigh peak that gradually slopes downward. Extending inward from the junction ofthe fence and the dome, a vajra lattice forms a sheltering canopy. Outside, avajra lattice made of interlocking, linked vajra chains covers the enclosure. Atthe apex of the dome is a half-vajra top ornament. The fence is secured on theoutside at its midpoint by a vajra chain. All of the vajras in thisvisualization are blue. Imagine that wrathful deities, weapons, fireballs, andvajra sparks emanate from this, shooting outwards to guard against anyobstructors or obstacles, so that even the wind at the end of an eon cannot passthrough.These are the general features of the protection circle. It should be understoodthat there are other specific details, for instance the ten wrathful deitiesarrayed on the spokes of the wheel of the protection dome. There are alsovisualizations for the domes of weapons and the protection circles of the fourelements, which are outside the main protection dome, and which should beapplied, by context, according to the central figure. Chant the verse from yourtext while imagining yourself contained within this along with the other peopleand valuables to be protected, including your retinue. Afterward, seal this withthe insight that holds no reference points of a self to be protected, wrathfuldeities and weapons doing the protecting, or of an act of protecting; this isthe protection circle of suchness, which is the most supreme form of protectionof all. Subsequent to this certain liturgies may include other parts, such as aconfession of damaged and broken vows in order to clear away any wrongdoing inrelation to the deity, or a vajra pledge never to transgress these vows again.If so, you should be able to understand the visualization according to itscontext by deriving the meaning from the verses.CREATING CONDUCIVE CIRCUMSTANCES Second, in order to create conducive circumstances, there are two parts: (1) theshower of blessings and (2) consecrating the offering articles.Shower of Blessings Here those that “shower down” are the great blessings, the resplendence of thewisdom deities’ five qualities of fruition. You, the practitioner, are therecipient, as well as your dwelling place and practice articles, for the purposethat you may connect with the shower of blessings of the wisdom deities’ threevajras. This instills you with a resplendence that enables you to bring allspiritual accomplishments within reach, foremost of which is your own inherentwisdom. The process of the shower of blessings begins with you making aninvocation with heartfelt devotion. This causes the blessings of the threevajras of all three root deities—who now fill the sky like sesame seeds burstingfrom a pod—as well as all spiritual accomplishments, to take the shape ofdeities for enlightened body; of seed syllables, for enlightened speech; and ofsymbolic implements, for enlightened mind. Imagine that these shower down likesnowflakes on a vast lake, dissolving into and blessing you as well as yourdwelling place and practice articles. Chant the verse for the shower ofblessings, fumigate with special substances, and invoke with the music of thehand drum and other instruments.Consecrating the Offering Articles Second, consecrating the offering articles has two parts: (1) the generalcleansing and purification and (2) the individual consecrations.The General Cleansing and Purification While visualizing yourself as the deity, the syllables RAṂ, YAṂ, and KHAṂ areprojected out of your heart center. From RAṂ appears fire, burning away anyimpure defects in the offering substances. From YAṂ wind arises, scatteringfixation on things as being real, while from KHAṂ appears water, cleansing awayhabitual tendencies. Finally, using the SVABHĀVA and other mantras, transformeverything into the nature of emptiness, and rest evenly in spacelike emptiness.The Individual Consecrations For the individual consecrations there are two parts, one general and onespecial. The general consecration applies to both the outer and inner offeringmaterials. First, the syllable BHRUṂ projects a wide and vast jewel vessel,which contains an OṂ, or else the individual seed syllables, meaning the firstletters in each word marked with a dot. The syllables produce the outer offeringmaterials, such as beautiful divine flowers, and the inner offerings, thenaturally occurring substances, including the flowers of the five sense organs.Also emanated are the five sense pleasures, the auspicious articles and symbols,the seven royal possessions, and every other possible offering. Every one ofthese offerings emanates countless goddesses, each bearing its respectiveoffering item. Thus, recite the mantra and the rest while visualizing thatclouds of offerings stream out to fill up all of space. There are then three special individual consecrations: one for medicine, one fortorma, and one for rakta.MedicineMedicine refers to the nectar in the naturally present, bliss-sustaining vesselof the skull cup. It consists of the commitment substances of the five familiesof male and female bliss-gone ones. There is human flesh and excrement in thecenter, cow flesh and semen in the east, dog flesh and the human brain in thesouth, horse flesh and menses in the west, and elephant flesh and urine in thenorth. For each of these there is a syllable, respectively: HRĪḤ and BAṂ, HŪṂand LĀṂ, TRĀṂ and MĀṂ, OṂ and MŪṂ, and ĀḤ and TĀṂ. Each of these syllablesproduces one of the five male and female buddhas, who then join together,inviting the victorious ones and their children throughout time and space withtheir blissful sounds and light rays from their places of union. The fire ofintense passion causes the victorious ones to melt into light and then dissolveinto the five pairs of male and female buddhas. This, in turn, causes the secretspaces to flow with white and red nectar, filling the skull cup. Finally, themale and female buddhas of the five families also melt into light and dissolveinto the nectar, which is transformed into the essence of the five wisdoms,perfect in color, fragrance, taste, and potency. Imagine all of this as yourecite the mantra.This description is based on the lotus-speech family, so here Vairocana andAmitābha have been switched. Otherwise, vajra-family practices, such as the“Magical Web of Vajrasattva,” should be applied to Akṣobhya. Practices relatedto the other four families should be applied to the buddha family if it is ofthe family of Vairocana, and so on. In any case, there is no contradiction, andyou should correlate it according to context with your text.TormaFor the torma, visualize a torma vessel as wide as the earth made of jewels.Within it is the torma substance, an inconceivable conglomeration of sensepleasures that appears as anything that delights the deities, emanated andamplified to fill the reaches of space. Though it is generally explained thatthere are three meanings of “torma,” in this context it is understood to mean anoffering substance.RaktaFor the rakta, imagine a fresh skull cup with the hair still on it, whichsymbolizes the space of the female consort. Within it gather all concepts thatcling to and fixate on the desire, form, and formless realms or, in other words,fixate on body, speech, and mind: those that cling to the body and appearance ofthe desire realm; to the speech and semiappearance of the form realm; and to themind and nonappearance of the formless realm. These all coalesce and arepurified into the nature of detached great bliss, a swirling ocean of rakta,which spreads throughout all of space while emanating clouds of desirablethings. These are the preliminary practices of engagement and counteraction.Collectively, they purify, perfect, and mature in a way that correlates to thelink between object, process, and result of purification. First, they purify andprotect against the objects of purification—the adverse circumstances of thesaṃsāric condition. These consist of the tainted modes of birth that cause us toenter into existence in the desire realm, as well as the abodes, bodies, andenjoyments that subsequently unfold. They also refine the conducivecircumstances that consist of accumulated meritorious actions. Next, theyperfect the fruition by paralleling the actual results of purification. Theseinclude the defeat of the four demons that obstruct enlightened activity, thegathering of the two accumulations, the bestowal of empowerment with greatflashes of light, and the actualization of the absorption that purifiesenlightened realms. Finally, they mature us for the completion stage by means ofthe process of purification. This refers to the incredible method whereby thesepreliminaries clear away the obstacles and pitfalls in the practices of thechannels, energies, and essences, and also produce within us the strength ofexperience and realization.Please keep in mind that the descriptions throughout this text regarding how theprinciples of purification, perfection, and maturation can be integrated comelargely from The Great Commentary on the Ritual of the Profound Path, TheAssembly of Bliss-gone Ones of the Great Compassionate One, composed by the sunof the teachings of the Early Translations, Minling Lochen Rinpoche.THE MAIN PRACTICE The main practice in absorption has three parts: (1) the visualization practiceof enlightened body, (2) the recitation practice of enlightened speech, and (3)the luminosity practice of enlightened mind.ENLIGHTENED BODY The visualization practice of enlightened body has five aspects: (1) the cause:setting up the framework through the three samādhis; (2) the result: developingthe support and supported maṇḍalas; (3) inviting and welcoming the wisdom beingsinto the support; (4) the activity stage of homage, offering, and praise; and(5) focusing on the deity’s appearance, the primary focal point.THE THREE SAMĀDHIS The Samādhi of Suchness Of the three samādhis, the first is the “samādhi of suchness,” which purifiesthe death process. When embodied beings die, their internal earth, water, fire,and wind elements successively dissolve into consciousness. At the same time,external visible forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures also successivelydissolve, and breathing ceases. The essences in the left and right channels thencoalesce at the upper and lower endpoints of the central channel. At that point,texture dissolves into mental objects and consciousness merges with luminosity.The two essences residing at the A and HAṂ dissolve at the heart into the spherethat is a nexus of five essences, at which point all coarse and subtle thinkingceases. In a process of progressive magnification, the stages of appearance,increase, and attainment dissolve the coarser thoughts, and the stage of fullattainment dissolves the subtler ones. If you fail to recognize empty luminositythrough all of this, it will now dawn for a brief moment—lucid, empty, and freeof thoughts, unobscured like space and free of the three discordant, pollutingconditions. This is the actual luminosity of death, which is the basis ofpurification. If you recognize it, you are liberated without passing through theintermediate state. A resemblance of this luminosity is also present, forinstance, during our sleep at night. For this reason, there is an instruction onrecognizing luminosity at that time and then resting within that state withoutdreaming. Thus, the object of purification here is the extremely subtle habitualtendency to regress when we fail to recognize suchness.The result of purification is the dharma body of enlightenment, a wakefulnessthat is utterly free of conceptual constructs. The process of purification isthe meditation on all phenomena as being empty and devoid of self-entity.Moreover, apart from all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa being merely theself-display of mind and wisdom, they do not possess an atom’s worth of trueexistence. Wisdom, moreover, is the true nature of mind and cannot be foundelsewhere. Thus, the intrinsic nature of our minds right now is unconfinedwisdom, empty and lucid, the equality that is, by nature, free from any marks ofconceptual elaboration.If we relate this to the three gates of liberation, the gate of emptiness refersto the fact that the nature of mind is not something created but is naturallyunconditioned, its essence empty. The gate of marklessness refers to the cause,and means that the nature of this emptiness is beyond the scope of conceptualmind’s ability to characterize it as existing in such-and-such a way. The gateof wishlessness refers to the fruition, and means that, within the equality ofthat intrinsic nature, there is no fruition to attain and no process by which toattain it, and thus there is nothing at all to wish for. In this way, bysettling your mind nonconceptually within the intrinsic nature that is beyondconcepts, there is nothing to add or remove, accept or reject. This is thesamādhi of suchness, which is primordially pure like the center of vajra space.To use this type of meditation to progress on the path, rest evenly withinemptiness for the main practice, free of elaboration and without concepts. Thisis in tune with the luminosity of dying as well as the dharma body at thefruition. Immediately afterwards, think, “This is the dharma body, deathpurified,” and with such conviction in the purification and perfection, restassured in the link between the ground and the fruition. On a downward level,practicing in this way purifies and refines away the stains of cyclic existence,the death state, the view of eternalism, fixation on appearance, and theformless realms. On an upward level, it nurtures the seed of the luminosity thatmanifests the dharma body, thus setting in place a link for perfecting thefruition. It also matures you by creating a foundation for the actual luminosityassociated with the higher path of the completion stage to dawn in yourmind-stream.The Samādhi of Total Illumination The object of purification at this stage is what occurs just after the fourthmoment of the dying process. At that time the manifest realms of the fivewisdoms magically appear as clusters of the five buddha families within theluminosity of the spontaneously present form body, which is similar to theautumn sky free of clouds. However, unless you have experience in the key pointsof practice, you will not recognize this. Thus, your conceptual mind, riding onenergy, will progressively undergo the three experiences, which in turn giverise to the extremely fine and subtle mental body of the intermediate state. Ithas all the senses, is unimpeded, possesses subtle clairvoyance, and experiencesmagical karmic displays. Sustaining itself on the scent of burnt offerings, itexperiences everchanging, fluctuating, and flickering dreamlike experiences thatare terrifying and painful; thus, it is also called “the perpetuatingdisembodied consciousness.”The result of purification is the buddhas’ enjoyment body adorned with the majorand minor marks of enlightenment. It resides in the ultimate, self-manifestUnexcelled Realm, where it performs the dance of magical wisdom. The process ofpurification is to cultivate all-pervasive illusory compassion for beings whohave not realized the way things are. To describe this in more detail, colors ofrainbow light appear incidentally out of the pure expanse of space, though theyare nothing but the nonexistent magical displays of space itself. Thus, in thenatural state of emptiness and suchness, there is no duality of saṃsāra andnirvāṇa. Still, while there is never any parting from nonduality, beings aredeceived by not recognizing the trick of the illusion. Confused, they regardthese manifestations as real and proceed to wander helplessly throughout therealms of cyclic existence. Toward these beings we form a nonconceptual,illusory compassion, which we extend to sentient beings in every realm, wishingthem permanent freedom from suffering.In order to take this onto the path, practice the samādhi of total illuminationas an illusory experience that, in the way it appears, accords with both theintermediate state and the resultant enjoyment body. Be confident that theintermediate state, in its pure form, is the enjoyment body. The samādhi oftotal illumination purifies the intermediate state, the view of nihilism,fixation on emptiness, and the form realms. It sets in place, moreover, a linkfor perfecting the resultant enjoyment body. Finally, it matures you by creatingthe foundation of great compassion, which is the cause for emerging in theunified, luminous state of the deity.The Causal Samādhi When intermediate-state beings approach their future place of conception, theydevelop craving toward it, whether it is the location of miraculous birth, thescent and taste in the case of birth from heat and moisture, or the copulationof their parents in egg- or womb-birth. The object of purification by the causalsamādhi is this intermediate-state energetic mind, precisely in the momentbefore it connects to its imminent place of birth due to such craving. Theresult of purification is said to be the display, in physical manifestation, ofcoarse emanation bodies of perfect enjoyment to guide beings according to theirneeds. The process of purification is to meditate on your own awareness, theunion of emptiness and compassion, as a particular seed syllable. This syllable,such as ĀḤ, HŪṂ, or HRĪḤ, has the nature of bliss, clarity, and emptiness, andis identical in color to the primary deity.Train progressively in the previous two samādhis until you reach familiaritywith them. Then proceed to the causal samādhi, the cause for accomplishing therealization of the emanation body, with which it is in tune. As the unity of theformer two, it is the intrinsic, unchanging great bliss, the essence thatpervades and extends throughout everything in existence as well as peace, boththe animate and inanimate universe. Its nature is indestructible like a vajra,and it is the support for the mind of awakening. It is the subtle, greatawakened life force, appearing in a way that is extremely fine yet vivid.Totally immutable, it has the features of clarity and stability, and canmanifest as anything whatsoever. This seed syllable, manifesting as the identityof the indestructible great essence, is what emanates the entire maṇḍala.Meditate on it as the nature of bliss, clarity, and emptiness. This will createthe causes for manifesting any maṇḍala as the magical display of bliss andclarity with the nature of emptiness.Just as the causal samādhi provides the seed for the unfolding of the entiremaṇḍala, the energetic mind in the intermediate state at the moment of enteringthe place of birth provides the seed for future existence. Similarly, a buddha’semanation body displays an array of manifestations to guide beings. These threeare, in this sense, a congruity, so in order to take the causal samādhi onto thepath, take assurance in the knowledge that birth in its pure form is theemanation body.The causal samādhi purifies and refines away the craving consciousness at themoment of entering the place of birth. It also purifies the desire realm, andthe concept that appearance and emptiness differ. In addition, it establishes alink for manifesting, out of the enjoyment body, resultant emanation bodies toguide beings according to their need. Finally, it also ripens you by creatingthe basis, in the context of completion stage, for emerging in the form of thedeity out of bliss and the energetic mind.In this way the three samādhis purify their objects: the habits associated withdeath, the intermediate existence, and rebirth. Their collective process ofpurification and the identity of their path as a whole is compassionateemptiness, which is, in fact, the single mainstay of the entire Great Vehiclepath. It is vital that we focus our energy wholly on this at the outset since,in its absence, any path is just artificial. Whether or not we practice thelater aspects of the development stage ritual in all their details isunimportant compared to having some degree of understanding and experience ofthis principle, as every key point is included within it.THE MAṆḌALAS OF THE SUPPORT AND THE SUPPORTED There are two aspects to the support and supported maṇḍalas: (1) visualizing thesupport, the celestial palace, and (2) visualizing the supported deities.The Celestial Palace Here there are also three parts: (1) visualizing the basis, the levels oflayered elements, (2) visualizing the celestial palace, and (3) visualizing theseat.The Basis In this stage the object of purification includes several things. First, itincludes the space element, which is the basis for the formation of the world,or the “container,” where sentient beings take birth. It also includes the maincause for the formation of the world, which is mind. In addition, it includesthe habits of shared karma that sentient beings have commonly gathered andingrained in their minds, which eventually ripen into common outer appearances.Finally, it includes the maṇḍalas of the four elements as well as the centralmountain. The result of purification is the basic space of phenomena, the realmwhere all buddhas become enlightened, symbolized by the pure expanses of thefive female buddhas.For the process of purification, begin with the causal seed syllable suspendedin space within the protection circle. This then projects the syllables E, YAṂ,RAṂ, BAṂ, LAṂ, and SUṂ, which in turn send out light rays, purifying the fiveelements as well as thoughts that fixate on them. The syllables then gather backthe pure essences of those five elements, which are all the qualities of thefive wisdoms. In doing so, they dissolve and become the progressively layeredelements. E gives rise to space in the form of a deep blue pyramid, “the sourceof phenomena.” The broad side faces upwards and the tip points downwards. Abovethat, the green wind maṇḍala emerges out of YAṂ in the shape of a vajra cross,surrounded by a ring of smoky, dark-green light. Next, RAṂ transforms into thefire maṇḍala, a red triangle surrounded by a chain of blazing flames. BAṂbecomes the round, white, and swirling maṇḍala of water, encircled by whitelight. LAṂ gives rise to the earth maṇḍala, a square made of gold and surroundedby yellow light. Finally, SUṂ becomes the square-shaped central mountain made ofthe four types of precious substance. It has four terraces and is entirelysurrounded by iron mountains. Visualize all of these touching one another butwithout being joined. Feel confidence in the link between the ground and thefruition, meaning that the five elements in their purity are the female buddhasof the five families.This explanation applies to peaceful deities, but for wrathful ones you shouldvisualize a sea of blood, a ground of human flesh, a mountain of skeletons, etc.in accordance with your practice text.The Celestial Palace Here the object of purification is the fixation that sentient beings have forthe places where they live and the homes they inhabit. The result ofpurification is the wisdom of the basic space of phenomena, free of allelaboration, which is said to be the dwelling place of all buddhas. This wisdomis, by nature, a celestial palace, which is described symbolically as “theexpanse of the vajra queen’s womb.” It is the celestial palace of delight in thesublime secret and supreme liberation, the great citadel of passing beyondsuffering, the ultimate Unexcelled Realm of the natural state just as it is.This immaculate, self-manifest celestial palace is the essence of Vairocana, andthus thoroughly pure.Here the process of purification is to take the self-manifest palace ofbuddhahood as the path. At this point imagine that the causal seed syllableprojects a five-colored syllable BHRUṂ, which descends onto the top of thecentral mountain. After projecting and absorbing light, it dissolves into lightand becomes the celestial palace composed of the two accumulations of merit andwisdom. In essence it has the nature of the five wisdoms, while its appearanceis that of a celestial palace, with perfect design and decorations.At the outermost level is an immense and vast protection dome. Inside of it isthe central mountain, the top of which is a perfectly even ground consisting ofminiscule vajras. At the periphery is a vajra enclosure resembling a fence ofiron mountains, which emanates masses of five-colored fire. Within thatenclosure, forming a perimeter, are the eight charnel grounds composed of alltheir awesome attributes, including stūpas, trees, fires, clouds, rivers,spiritual adepts, the guardians of the directions, gods, and nāgas. In thecenter of these is a thousand-petalled lotus made of a variety of jewels; itscenter is round, green, and level, and its red pistils are moist with dew. Thislotus supports a bright and resplendent sun disc that spans the width of thepistils. At the center of the sun is a double vajra. The hub of the vajra is adeep-blue square, and its spokes are the color of their respective direction—thethree extending eastward, for instance, are white. The celestial palace, whichis perfectly square in shape, rests on this foundation. It has five consecutivelayers of walls, each made of different types of jewels, the innermost of whichis the color of the family of the main deity.A ledge of red jewels surrounds the external foundation of the celestial palace,which protrudes at the base. On this ledge, the “platform of delights,” are theoffering goddesses, gathered in pairs and facing inward. Beginning at the farnorthern corner of the eastern side and continuing clockwise, they are: the bluelute goddess, the yellow flute goddess, the red round-drum goddess, and thegreen clay-drum goddess. Each of them holds her particular implement. Then,continuing on the southern side are: the blue goddess of beauty and the redgoddess of laughter, both bearing their emblems; the yellow goddess of song,holding miniature cymbals, and the green goddess of dance with the emblem ofdance. To the west are: the yellow goddess of flowers, the black goddess ofincense, the red goddess of lights, and the green goddess of perfume, allbearing their emblems. To the north are: the red goddess of visual form, bearinga mirror; the red goddess of taste, with a tray of food; the green goddess oftexture, carrying garments; and the white goddess of basic space, holding thetriangular “source of phenomena.” They are all adorned with silks and jewelryand have a serene and graceful countenance.At the corners of the porticos and in each corner—the southeast, southwest,etc.—of the palace itself there is the seal of a half-moon and vajra. At the topof the palace walls runs a yellow frieze trimmed with inlaid jewels resemblingfrost. Above that run beams, which are supported by posts, also called pillarstabilizers. On top of these are the rafters that support the roof, on the tipof each of which is a “face of glory.” From the mouths of these hang garlandsand tassels made of jewels, as well as flower garlands, silk streamers, mirrors,crescents, and tail fans, all fluttering in the breeze. The roof rests on therafters and extends out to the edge of the external foundation. Beneath, on theunderside of the roof, is a line of rainspouts made of white gemstone which looklike anointing vases turned upside down. Between them run garlands fasteneddirectly to the lower ends of the rafters. Holding down the base of the rooffrom above is a parapet, also called a lenken, which has a stūpa design andconsists of three or four levels of upright, white jewel planks. This is alsoreferred to as the “half-lotus petal.”Inside the celestial palace there are eight pillars that support fourinterlocked beams, upon which twenty-eight rafters rest. The rafters support theceiling, which is made of jeweled planks, except for a skylight in the center. Alayer of jewels covers this entire level. The so-called “central chamber” isformed by an arrangement of pillars or wooden posts at each of the four cornersof the skylight. They support the roof, the peak of which is adorned with ajewel-vajra top ornament.In the exact center of the walls in each of the four directions there is anentrance with an outer vestibule. The upper parts of the vestibules have twoprotruding corners, while the lower corners connect with the externalfoundation. Each has four pillars, upon which are four interlocked beams. Eachvestibule also has an architrave consisting of two parts, one “causal” and one“resultant.” The causal architrave consists of stairs leading into the entrance.There are eight of these, two at the left and right sides of the roofedentranceway, and four at the midway point of the entrance itself.The resultant architrave rests on top of the four interlocked beams mentionedabove, and may consist of either four or eight constituent parts. If we considerone with eight, they are, sequentially: the horse ankle, lotus, casket, lattice,cluster ornament, garlands, rainspout, and roof. The horse-ankle ledge consistsof a row of upright golden vajras set against a blue background. The lotus ledgeis a row of lotus petals made of red gemstone. The casket ledge is a flat boxmade of various jewels inserted between small pillars. The lattice is a net ofwhite jewels hanging down from the ledge of hanging clusters. Thecluster-ornament ledge is similar to the frieze. The garland ledge consists ofjewel garlands and tassels which hang from the mouths of lions against an evenbackground.The rainspouts and roof of the portico are similar to those described above, butthe portico roofs furthermore are adorned with garuḍa heads at their fourcorners. From the necks of these garuḍas hang bells with strikers that make themring in the breeze. In the middle of the architrave’s facade there is atrefoil-shaped gap resembling an elephant from the back decorated on the insidewith jeweled garlands and tassels.On top of the portico roof, on the center of a lotus, is a golden wheel. It issupported on either side by two deer, a horned male representing method, and ahornless female representing knowledge. Finally, a decorative white parasol madeof jewels surmounts it. Beyond this, the space in and around the palace isdecorated with a variety of beautiful things such as jeweled canopies, banners,pennants, tail-fans, and bells strung on golden thread that ring as they flutterin the breeze. All of this is clear, translucent, and unobstructing.This has been a mere overview. If you wish to study further details, they can belearned from other more specific texts, such as the Magical Web.In the case of wrathful maṇḍalas, the palace is in the structure of the “blazingcharnel ground palace,” which functions to tame disciples of a less tractablenature. It has walls made of alternating dry, fresh, and rotting skulls, pillarsmade of the eight great gods, and beams made of the eight great nāgas. Itsceiling consists of the twenty-eight lunar mansions, while the skylight is madeup of the eight planets, the sun, and the moon. The lattices and tassels aremade of snakes and skulls. The palace architraves are ornamented with fingers,skulls, the five major organs, and garlands of the sun and moon. Its rainspoutsare arm and leg bones, and its ledge is made of backbones. The roof consists ofthe hollow skull of Mahādeva and a heart adorns its pinnacle. The palace’sbanner is a human corpse. Its canopies are made of human skin, its tail-fans aremade of corpse hair, its wreaths are made of intestines, and it is ornamentedwith pendulant lungs and hearts. Inside and out, the whole area is filled withcharnel grounds and swirling lakes of blood, while terrifying fires and fiercestorms rage everywhere.In certain tantric scriptures you will see the phrases “beams of greatexcellence” and “rafters of lesser excellence.” Guru Rinpoche explains in hiscommentary on Vajrakīlaya that “great excellence” refers to human corpses. Hethen comments that “lesser excellence” refers to: people who have deviated fromthe royal caste and become rock-dwelling lizards, people who have deviated fromthe priestly caste and become meadow-dwelling marmots, people who have deviatedfrom the merchant caste and become forest-dwelling monkeys, and people who havedeviated from the untouchable caste and become water-dwelling frogs. Beyondthis, nothing more can be described here, as you must look to your particulartext to understand the inner chamber and divine abode associated with a specificmaṇḍala.When practicing in this manner, if you fail to recall the purity of eachindividual element of the visualization, the object of your meditation willstray into your ordinary state of mind. Therefore, keep in mind that it is thequalities of enlightenment—the phenomena related to complete purification,consisting of inconceivable compassion and activity—that appear as the celestialpalace in order to guide disciples. Composed of a variety of jewels, it isenlightened wisdom manifesting in shape and color in order to fulfill disciples’wishes.The fact that the palace is square in shape shows there is no unevennesswhatsoever in the basic space of phenomena. Its four doors represent the fouractivities of pacifying, increasing, magnetizing, and subjugating, or else, theway that the four boundless qualities, love and the rest, lead into the palaceof great bliss. They also represent entrance into the palace of the nonarisingbasic space of things from the levels of the four liberations: the emptiness ofcause, result, action, and essence.The eightfold raised architrave entranceways represent the eight vehicles: ofgods, humans, listeners, self-realized buddhas, bodhisattvas, action tantra,performance tantra, and yoga tantra. Otherwise they may symbolize passagethrough the eight effortful vehicles up to anuyoga and onto the effortless,nondual vehicle of ati. The four resultant architraves represent the four meansof magnetizing: giving, speaking nicely, behaving consistently, and actingmeaningfully. The eight parts of each of these symbolize the perfection of thequalities within the systems of the eight vehicles to complete liberation, orelse, if there are four, the four vehicles of listeners, self-realized buddhas,bodhisattvas, and Secret Mantra. The uninterrupted spinning of the wheel of theDharma is shown in the wheels and other such things.The “platform of delights” represents the four applications of mindfulness: ofthe body, sensation, mind, and mental objects. The four pillars in thearchitraves symbolize the four right exertions: to prevent nonvirtue fromhappening, restrain existing nonvirtue, create virtue where there is none, andincrease existing virtue. The four vestibules represent the four bases ofmiraculous power: intention, diligence, attention, and discernment.The five-layered walls symbolize the five faculties that govern completepurification: faith, diligence, mindfulness, concentration, and knowledge. Thefrieze, top border, rainspouts, eaves, and central chamber symbolize attainmentof the five strengths; when the same five (faith and the rest) become strengths,they cannot be overcome by their opposing factors.The decorative jewel lattices, tassels, flower garlands, silk streamers,mirrors, half-moons, and tail-fans symbolize the seven factors of enlightenment:mindfulness, discernment of phenomena, diligence, joy, pliancy, concentration,and equanimity. The eight internal pillars symbolize the eight aspects of thepath of the noble ones: right view, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort,recollection, and concentration.The pillar capitals symbolize the eight emancipations: (1) to perceive formswith regard to one’s own body, (2) to perceive forms other than one’s own body,(3) beauty, (4–7) the four sense spheres such as infinite space, and (8) theserenity of cessation. The four beams symbolize the four types of fearlessness:to proclaim that all has been abandoned and realized for one’s own benefit andto show the path and its obstacles for others’ benefit.The twenty-eight internal rafters symbolize the eighteen types of emptiness andthe ten perfections. The eighteen types of emptiness are: (1) emptiness of theouter, (2) emptiness of the inner, (3) emptiness of the outer and inner,(4) great emptiness, (5) emptiness of beginning and ending, (6) emptiness of theconditioned, 7) emptiness of the unconditioned, (8) emptiness of emptiness,(9) emptiness of what is beyond limits, (10) emptiness of nature, (11) emptinessof the unobserved, (12) emptiness of the ultimate, (13) emptiness ofnonabandonment, (14) emptiness of nonentities, (15) emptiness of all things,(16) emptiness of individual characteristics, (17) emptiness of entities andnonentities, and (18) emptiness of essence. The ten perfections are:(1) generosity, (2) discipline, (3) patience, (4) diligence, (5) concentration,(6) knowledge, (7) method, (8) power, (9) aspiration, and (10) wisdom.Otherwise, the twenty-eight rafters can be said to symbolize the buddhas’ tenpowers along with their eighteen unique qualities. The upper flat panelssymbolize inconceivable qualities. The four posts supporting the central chambersymbolize the four correct discriminations: of Dharmas, meanings, language, andconfidence. The crowning ornament symbolizes that all maṇḍalas of theenlightened ones coalesce in the expanse of naturally aware wakefulness.Furthermore, the canopy represents the utter purity of true reality. The parasolsymbolizes protecting beings with great compassion, while the pennant symbolizesgreat compassion itself. The banner represents victory over the demons and theprevailing of the Dharma. The bells resound with the sounds of the teachings ofemptiness. The light that radiates in all directions represents the eternaladornment wheel of enlightened body, speech, and mind. The palace’snonobstructing appearance, utterly clear and bright while at the same timetranslucent, shows how everything is none other than the expression ofwakefulness.The crossed-vajra that forms the ground symbolizes wakefulness whose nature isindivisible from emptiness. The twelve enclosures symbolize the complete purityof the twelve links of interdependent origination: (1) ignorance, (2) formation,(3) consciousness, (4) name and form, (5) the six sense bases, (6) contact, (7)sensation, (8) craving, (9) grasping, (10) becoming, (11) birth, and (12) oldage and death.The sun seat represents the natural luminosity of true reality. The lotusgarlands show that true reality is unstained by any faults. The eight charnelgrounds represent the innate purity of the eight collections of consciousness:the (1) eye, (2) ear, (3) nose, (4) tongue, (5) body, (6) mind, (7) disturbedmind, and (8) all-ground consciousnesses. They also represent the eightanalogies of illusion: (1) illusion, (2) dream, (3) reflection, (4) mirage, (5)the moon’s reflection in water, (6) visual distortion, (7) echo, and (8)apparition. The vajra fence symbolizes nonconceptual wakefulness, by natureutterly indestructible. The masses of flames symbolize the fire of wakefulnessconsuming wayward demons and disturbing emotions.All of these qualities mentioned here—from the applications of mindfulnessonward—are part of the extraordinary transformation that constitutes theundefiled state of enlightenment. Although it is important to remember thepurity of each symbol as well as what it represents, as a beginner you may notbe able to bring all of this to mind in a single practice session. If this isthe case, you can approximate the recollection of purity by thinking to yourselfthat all the features of the celestial palace represent the buddhas’inconceivable qualities of abandonment and realization. We visualize thesupporting maṇḍala, in short, so that we may take the self-manifest palace ofthe buddhas as our path. Through this process—by feeling confidence in perfectpurity, the fusion of ground and fruition—we take the realms of all buddhas asour path as well.Moreover, these visualizations ripen the practitioner for the subsequentpractices due to a series of correlations. The stacked elements and the centralmountain correlate to the five cakras and the central channel. The basis of themaṇḍala, the lotus, sun, and crossed-vajra, correlate as well to the energiesand essences at the center of the cakras. Finally, the mind that mingles withall these in one taste—with its aspects of clarity, emptiness, andbliss—correlates to the celestial palace. Thus, by training properly in thesupporting maṇḍala, the channels, essences, and energies will become pliable andunder control. It thus matures you for the higher path by setting a foundationfor the completion stage wisdom to dawn in your being.The Seat By visualizing the seat, the object of purification consists of sentient beings’fixation or habitual tendency toward a particular place of birth, such as themother’s lotus, the semen and ova, heat and moisture, etc. The result ofpurification is to manifest enlightened emanation bodies within saṃsāric statesthat guide beings according to their needs while being unstained by flaws suchas the four modes of birth. Another result is to perfect the wisdom ofluminosity—unified means and knowledge—through the natural purity of enlightenedmind.The actual procedure, or process of purification, is to visualize the seats ofthe central figure and retinue each in their respective manner. One commonpresentation, for instance, is to have a lotus in the center of the celestialpalace, surmounted by a red sun disc and a white moon disc equal in diameter tothe center of the lotus.Otherwise, in the Magical Web for example, the central deities of the fivebuddha families have seats with five layers: an animal throne with a surface ofjewels surmounted by a sun, a moon, and a lotus. The bodhisattvas have a seat ofthree layers: a sun, moon, and lotus. The six sages merely have a lotus for aseat, while the wrathful gatekeepers only have a sun. Finally, the doer and deedhave a four-layered seat made of a sun, moon, lotus, and jewels.This is just one example, however, and we must follow our own particular text.Wrathful deities have their own distinct thrones, which may consist, forinstance, of Rudra, Mahādeva, male and female direction guardians, the major andminor bases of deliverance, and beasts.In any case, with regard to the purity of the various seats, the animal thronesrepresent guiding beings by means of the four types of fearlessness, the tenstrengths, the four bases of miraculous power, the ten powers, or the fouractivities. These are symbolized, respectively, by the lion throne, elephantthrone, horse throne, peacock throne, and the half-bird, half-man shang shangthrone. The sun and moon represent the luminosity of awakened mind in itsnatural purity, the unity of means and knowledge. The lotus is a symbol offlawlessness, while the jewels represent the fulfillment of beings’ aspirations.The wrathful deities have seats that symbolize the defeat of ignorance,dualistic concepts, karma and disturbing emotions, as well as the four demons.However, for specific details, once again we must look to our particularscripture. While the other principles have been sufficiently described above,the ten strengths and the ten powers are as listed in the summary ofIntroduction to the Way of the Learned: > The ten strengths are: the correct and incorrect,> Ripening, elements, inclinations, faculties,> Absorptions, paths, previous states, death and transference,> And knowing the extinction of defilements. > The ten powers are to have power over:> Life, mind, materials, karma,> Rebirth, intention, aspiration,> Miracles, wisdom, and dharmas. Finally, the lotus seat is related to the channels and the cakras, the sun tothe fire of inner heat, and the moon to the syllable HAṂ at the top of the head.Therefore, visualizing the seat ripens you for the higher paths by creating afoundation for attaining the immutable bliss based on the melting bliss ofblazing and dripping.The Supported Deities The visualization of the supported deities has two parts: (1) the actualvisualization procedure and (2) the blessing and bestowal of empowerment.The Actual Visualization Procedure The visualization procedure has three aspects: (1) a general explanation of howto purify the habits of the four modes of birth, (2) a specific application ofthe visualization ritual of the three vajras, and (3) the characteristics of thedeities. Purifying the Four Modes of BirthThe Glorious Magical Web describes: > To purify the four types of birth> There are four types of development:> The very elaborate and elaborate,> The simple and the completely simple. Purifying Birth from an EggThe first of these four—the very elaborate and extensive style—refers to theprocedures called one’s own children and another’s child, which purify birthfrom an egg. It has both an extensive and a concise version.The extensive version is described according to the tradition of the sādhanasection in The Complete Secret of the Eight Sādhana Teachings, which explainsthe general meanings of one’s own children and another’s child.In the practice of one’s own children you visualize your mind, the nature of thebliss-gone—the essential awareness that constitutes the basis for allappearances within saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—as the central male and female deities.These then give birth to other thus-gone ones, who become your children and areestablished within your retinue.In another’s child all the other thus-gone ones who previously dissolved intoyou in the context of one’s own children and then exited the womb to manifestlike children in your retinue now merge with the heart of the central deity. Atthat point all your conceptuality takes the form of a syllable, which descendsinto the consort’s space. In this way you are born as her child and join theretinue.Furthermore, there are five steps in making others one’s own children. (1)First, the causal seed syllable descends onto the seat, projects and absorbslight, and then transforms, emerging as the causal heruka, the central maledeity with consort. (2) Next, the light of bliss that shines where the maledeity’s secret vajra joins the female deity’s space invokes all buddhas in theten directions, who then enter the male consort through his crown and dissolveinto the space of the female. (3) Once again, light rays are projected,summoning sentient beings and purifying their obscurations. They then dissolveinto the female consort’s space. (4) One then engenders the great pride of beingthe nondual identity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, thinking, “I am the Great GloriousOne, head of all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.” (5) Finally, the assembly of deitiesemerges from the secret space and they take their respective seats.Another’s child is similar, for instance, to birth from an egg whereby first theegg is laid and then hatches so that the sense organs and limbs fully develop.This process has eight parts: (1) The primary male and female deities firstdissolve into light and become a sphere of light, together with the seedsyllable and symbolic implement. (2) This then transforms and emerges as theresultant heruka with consort. (3) Next, all the male deity’s conceptuality istransformed into the essence of syllables while he thinks, “I am not able toproduce a child.” (4) Light rays of invocation then stream out of the femaledeity, and the deities in the retinue are supplicated to take birth as theirchildren. (5) The retinue deities then delightedly melt into light and dissolveinto the heart centers of the primary male and female deities. As they mergewith the heart of the central deity, one takes pride in being the identity ofgreat wisdom, the universal lord of every maṇḍala. (6) Next, the secret spacewhere the male and female consorts are joined is consecrated and the maṇḍalaemerges within the space of the female, complete with the celestial palace andthrone. (7) You then visualize your own forty-two concepts, which abideessentially as syllables, transforming into the complete assembly of primary andretinue deities, which emerge from the space of the female consort. (8) Finally,you invite the wisdom deities from basic space so that they dissolve into thesamaya being, and your three places are sealed with the three vajras. Theretinue deities are then established on their thrones, the primary deitydissolves into the resultant heruka, and the celestial palace and thrones eachdissolve into themselves.There is also a concise version, which follows the tradition of the tantrasection and accords with the Magical Web. There are, in fact, many points ofdiscrepancy when comparing the extensive and concise styles of this meditationand the various expositions of the sublime beings of the past. However, theyshould be studied elsewhere.Here, in our version of the concise method, you should begin by going for refugeand engendering the mind of awakening. Then visualize two stages, as occur inegg birth. First, visualize yourself instantly as the primary male and femaleconsorts and then invite and visualize the maṇḍala you are practicing within thespace before you. Next, make offerings, praise, supplications, dailyconfessions, and so on. Once this is finished, use VAJRA MU to rest evenly inemptiness again. This, in itself, is the unique feature of this approach—if youunderstand that, you can apply this presentation generally to the very extensiveand moderately extensive development stage approaches for purifying womb birth.In the majority of practices that outline a procedure such as the three vajras,the process of developing the deity is, in fact, as follows. Begin byvisualizing the field of accumulation and go through the steps for gathering theaccumulations; then dissolve the field into yourself, settling without anyreference point. Next, carry out the various ritual procedures such as theexpulsion of obstructors before proceeding to meditate on the samādhi ofsuchness and so on.Whichever style of development you use, whether extensive or brief, its purposeis to purify your fixation on empty appearances. In the extensive style, thecentral deity and the entire retinue—oneself and the children—melt into light,while in the concise manner, both are left within the state free of concepts.Both methods purify the death state, in which all concepts and outer appearancestemporarily cease. They perfect the dharma body—the basic space in which allhabitual tendencies are purified—within the ground. They mature one for thecompletion stage of luminosity, which abides within the wisdom state thateradicates dualistic thought. They lead to the remanifestation, at the time ofenlightenment, of the assembly of another’s child, the primary and maṇḍaladeities.When we use the concise style and train according to our specific practicemanual, there is a complete purifying and refining away of both the intermediatestate—which follows the death state and the subsequent, progressive flaring ofthe energetic mind—as well as the vastly unfolding experiences of the birthstate. There is a perfection within the ground of the divine form in the unifiedstate beyond training. Manifesting out of the dharma body as the form bodies, itappears infinitely throughout the basic space of phenomena. Finally, there is amaturation of the completion-stage practitioner so that he or she can emerge outof luminosity as the divine form in the state of unity in training. This was theexplanation of my teacher, Guṇa, lord of the tantra section of the great secretand a supreme expert in the definitive meaning. Purifying Womb BirthThere are three ways to purify womb birth: (1) the four manifestations ofenlightenment, (2) the ritual of the three vajras, and (3) the fivemanifestations of enlightenment. The Four Manifestations of EnlightenmentThe Heruka Galpo describes the four manifestations of enlightenment: > First, emptiness and the mind of awakening,> Second, the occurrence of the seed,> Third, the complete form,> Fourth, setting out the syllable . . . The first manifestation of enlightenment, as explained here, is to rest evenlyin the nonconceptual meditation of simplicity, and then cultivate the mind ofawakening within that state. This is an illusory, unattached compassion towardall those who are unable to realize such a state themselves. On a downwardlevel, this purifies the death state, in which all of the eighty intrinsicthought states subside due to confusion, as well as the indistinct appearancesthat unfold in the intermediate state as the karmic wind flares up again.Upwardly, it perfects the dharma and enjoyment bodies within the ground. Inbetween, it matures one for the practices of luminosity and illusory body.The second manifestation of enlightenment is to visualize the form of thedeity’s seed syllable, which is essentially the wisdom of unified emptiness andcompassion. This purifies and refines away the stage at which the intermediatestate consciousness, in the form of a disembodied perpetuating spirit, mergeswith the parents’ semen and ovum. It perfects the emanation body within theground, and matures one for emerging out of the symbolic wisdom in the illusorybody of the deity.The third manifestation of enlightenment is to visualize the seed syllabletransforming into the symbolic implement of vajra mind, and then from that intothe complete bodily form. This purifies and refines away the process of fetaldevelopment, beginning with the coalescence of the semen, ovum, and energeticmind, progressing through the embryonic stages: the oval, thickened, elongated,round, and solid phases. This would also include Viṣṇu’s “fishlike” and“turtlelike” stages, as well as the complete development of the eyes, the othersense organs, and the limbs. It perfects the unified essence body within theground, and matures one for emerging out of ultimate luminosity in the unifiedform of the deity.The fourth manifestation of enlightenment may entail the projection of the seedsyllable for producing the deities, or else the act of sealing via placement ofsyllables in the deity’s three places. This purifies the fixation the newborninfant has on engaging with various things when it begins to explore objectswith its senses. It also perfects the fruition of spontaneously presentenlightenment within the ground. Finally, as one emerges in the unified form ofthe deity through completion stage training, it matures one to enjoy theexperience of sense pleasures without any attachment as they have become theadornments of awareness. The Ritual of the Three VajrasThe second method, the ritual of the three vajras, will be explained below. The Five Manifestations of EnlightenmentThe Hevajra Tantra explains: > The moon is mirrorlike wisdom,> The seven of seven, equality.> Discernment is said to be the deity’s> Seed syllable and symbolic implements.> All becoming one is perseverance itself,> And perfection, the pure expanse of reality. In this regard, the “ground manifestation of enlightenment” refers to the factthat, in the context of the ground, the white essence, red essence, energeticmind, and their collections are primordially enlightened as the essence of thefive wisdoms. The “path manifestation of enlightenment” refers to the symbolicwisdom on the paths of accumulation and joining, and the fourfold unifiedemptiness that manifests the actual luminosity on the paths of seeing andcultivation. In order for this to develop in one’s mind-stream there are thedevelopment stage visualizations of the moon, sun, symbolic implement, etc. The“resultant manifestation of enlightenment” refers to the five bodies, fivewisdoms, and all of the qualities of the unified state beyond training at thefruition.With this understanding of how the manifestations of enlightenment are linked tothe ground, path, and fruition, we now turn to the specific way of training inthe five path manifestations of enlightenment. > (1) The basis of purification for the first manifestation includes: the> aggregate of form, the element of space, the body, the all-ground> consciousness, the disturbing emotion of delusion, the male element in womb> birth, the moisture in heat-and-moisture birth, the male element in egg birth,> and the empty aspect of miraculous birth. The process of purification is to> visualize the first manifestation of enlightenment, the moon disc, which is> the essence of Vairocana and mirrorlike wisdom and emerges from the vowels.> (2) The basis of purification for the second manifestation includes: the> aggregate of sensation, the element of earth, the disturbed consciousness,> stinginess and pride, the red female element in womb birth, the female element> in egg birth, the heat in heat-and-moisture birth, and the luminous aspect of> miraculous birth. The process of purification is to visualize the second> manifestation of enlightenment, the sun disc, which is the essence of> Ratnasambhava and the wisdom of equality and emerges from the consonants.> (3) The basis of purification for the third manifestation includes: the> intermediate-state consciousness (the disembodied perpetuating mind) merging> with the semen and ovum, the aggregate of perception, the element of fire,> speech, the mind consciousness, the disturbing emotion of desire, and the> intermediate-state consciousness as it enters into one of the four modes of> birth. The process of purification is to visualize the third manifestation of> enlightenment, the seed syllable combined with the symbolic implement, which> is the essence of Amitābha and discerning wisdom.> (4) The basis of purification for the fourth manifestation includes: the> coalescence of the semen, ovum, and mind into one; the aggregate of> formations; the element of wind; the actions of body, speech, and mind; the> five sense consciousnesses; the disturbing emotion of envy; and, in terms of> the four modes of birth, the coalescence of the intermediate-state> consciousness with semen and ovum in egg and womb birth, with heat and> moisture in heat-and-moisture birth, and with merely empty luminosity in> miraculous birth. The process of purification is to visualize the fourth> manifestation of enlightenment, the coalescence of the moon, sun, symbolic> implement, and seed syllable into one taste in the form of a spherical orb,> which is the essence of Amoghasiddhi and all-accomplishing wisdom.> (5) The basis of purification for the fifth manifestation includes: birth from> the womb after the period of gestation has culminated, the aggregate of> consciousness, the element of water, the mind consciousness, the act of> grasping at the reality of the eightfold collection, the disturbing emotion of> anger, and the state in which the physical sense fields associated with taking> birth in one of the four ways are fully developed. The process of purification> is to visualize the fifth manifestation of enlightenment, the complete bodily> form, which is the essence of Akṣobhya and the wisdom of the basic space of> phenomena. The three principles of purification, perfection, and maturation also apply tothe five manifestations of enlightenment. Someone with a special physicalsupport, such as a human body made of the six elements, can reach liberation byapplying skillful means. Such a body has the bases for purifying theelements—the coarse aspects of the channels, essences, and energetic mind—fullymanifest.A person with this type of body must first be matured via empowerment. Then heor she should train in the five manifestations of enlightenment in the contextof the conceptual path of the development stage. The main emphasis at that levelis also the white essence, red essence, and mind. Therefore, by taking somethingthat in appearance accords with saṃsāra as the path, one can thoroughly purifyall aspects of semen, ovum, energy, and mind, which are the nature of existenceand object of purification. Furthermore, by training on the path of devotedintent, which is in harmony with the true state of the victorious ones, one canperfect within the ground all the qualities of the five factors of fruition aswell as the five wisdoms. Both of these mature one for aspects of the completionstage, such as appearance, flaring, near-attainment, luminosity, and union. Purifying Birth from Heat and MoistureThird is the simple style of development stage. This practice is based on theintent of anuyoga and serves to purify birth from heat and moisture. It says inThe Magical Key to the Treasury: > In the anuyoga vehicle, without developing it,> But merely uttering the essence mantra,> The complete form of the deity is visualized. Unlike in womb birth, which involves a lengthy gestation, all the body parts ofthose taking birth from heat and moisture are fully formed as soon as theconsciousness enters the combination of heat and moisture. Similarly, here,there is no need to make use of the details explained in mahāyoga, such as thefive manifestations of enlightenment, nor the elaborate descriptions found inextensive development rituals. Instead, bring to mind the view of the greatanuyoga scriptures, according to which all things are naturally enlightened asthe fundamental maṇḍala of awakened mind—the great bliss child of nondual basicspace and wakefulness. Without wavering from this view, direct its expression,the force of compassion, toward purifying the habitual craving toward the bodiesand abodes of birth from heat and moisture. Then simply utter the essence mantraof the deity you are going to visualize. As you do so, visualize in completenessthe form of the supported deity along with its support. This is the manifestaspect of relative truth that appears from the ultimate basic space ofwisdom—Samantabhadra’s expanse of emptiness. In this way you should train in thepath of indivisible bliss and emptiness. This is known as “the magicaldevelopment stage of insight into the unreality of appearances.” Purifying Miraculous BirthFourth is the completely simple style of development stage, which complementsthe pith instructions of atiyoga and serves to purify miraculous birth. Evenfaster than in birth from heat and moisture, the body of a being bornmiraculously is fully formed as soon as its consciousness enters into emptyluminosity. The path that purifies this type of birth is a similar process, asMaster Ganthapāda explained: > Meditate without any seed,> Like a being taking birth miraculously. All sights, sounds, and thoughts—which is to say, all phenomena—are primordiallyenlightened as the vajra essence of the body, speech, and mind of the victoriousones. For this reason, the spontaneously perfect maṇḍala is already presentright now in the state of fruition, effortlessly and without being created. Thisis the view of the atiyoga pith instructions, within which we visualize themaṇḍala of support and supported perfectly complete in an instant, like a fishleaping from the water. The knowledge holder Jigme Lingpa has described this: > Those of the very highest acumen practice the development stage ritual of> complete simplicity by developing the mind’s inner potential. This potential> is linked with the universal view of the king of vehicles, the natural and> supreme yāna. The momentum that ensues from this process allows one to train> in the indivisibility of development and completion. Without having to> verbalize anything, the mind’s nature is visualized in its innate state, as> the complete form of the deity. This occurs in a manner similar to the way a> reflection can suddenly appear in a mirror. The following passage illustrates> this approach: > > The deity is you and you are the deity.> > > You and the deity arise together.> > > Since samaya and wisdom are nondual,> > > There is no need to invite the deity,> > > Nor to request it to take its seat.> > > Self-emanated and self-empowered,> > > Awareness itself is the Three Roots.> > In this form of development stage practice, the nature of the deity isinherently and perfectly present within illusory wisdom. This purifiesmiraculous birth. Explaining further, the omniscient Longchenpa writes,regarding the effortless approach of atiyoga: > In the same way that miraculous birth occurs instantaneously,> There is no need to start from nothing and then meditate> On development and completion in stages. General Remarks on the Development StageMoreover, it is said that each aspect of development stage, completion stage,and union possesses, in itself, these three aspects, creating a progression fromthe development stage of development stage to the union of union. Thus, everypractice that involves visualizing the form of a deity need not be categorizedas only development stage, i.e., as one part of a pair, opposed to completionstage. Nevertheless, when considering the development as one of only two stages,the development stage is the first step for someone who has not engendered thewisdom of the completion stage. Such a person trains in the development stage inorder to mature for the completion stage practice. First he or she must gainconviction in the view of mantra and then proceed to cultivate the appearance ofthe deity’s form as a conceptual imitation. Later, when the special realizationof the completion stage emerges, the form of the deity appears as an expressionof wisdom. This constitutes a direct cause of the unity in training.In light of this, even though as beginners our development stage practice isonly a conceptual imitation, we can nonetheless embrace it with confidence inthe view, so that it will be in harmony with the true wisdom. On the other hand,if we fail to do that, it will neither lead to nor ripen us for that wisdom.That is why both the stake of absorption and the stake of unchanging realizationare so crucial. For this reason, the practice of the two stages does not alwaysunfold precisely as described in the scriptures and practice manuals. Abeginner, for instance, may try to rest evenly in the wisdom of the completionstage, but it will be nothing more than holding something conceptually in mind.On the other hand, someone with superior realization can meditate on the complexdetails of the development stage in such a way that they manifest as the naturalexpression of wisdom.Furthermore, when someone who has not engendered the wisdom of the completionstage visualizes the deity in practices related to the channels, energies, andinner heat, it may be a conceptual imitation. However, it is still consideredthe completion-stage form of the deity because it is a way for intrinsic wisdomto emerge. Lastly, those who have realized a high view may still meditate onhighly elaborate forms of development stage. In their case, it is not out ofpersonal necessity, but rather for the sake of their disciples. Specifically, itis to underscore to their students the auspicious coincidence made by enteringinto and being ripened within a particular maṇḍala. This is how my teacher Guṇaexplained it.Moreover, when we train in the development stage as beginners and first bringout the appearance of the deity’s form, we should investigate where the deity wevisualize first appeared from, where it currently remains, where it will goafterward, and what its essence really is. We will then come to an understandingthat it did not come from anywhere in the beginning, does not remain anywhere inthe present, and will not go anywhere in the end; it is a projection of our ownmind. After this, we can proceed to analyze the essence of our own mind in thesame way and conclude that its true state is originally devoid of the marks ofarising, dwelling, and ceasing. With this understanding, we can perceive thesecret key point of unity, that the form of the deity in development stage isinseparable from our own mind, appearing while not being real, like a rainbow ormoon reflected in water.Having gained such an insight, we can apply it to all our experiences andactivities, and train progressively until all appearances arise, withoutfixation, as the empty yet luminous development stage of magical illusion. Wewill also come to some understanding—whether as an idea or in experience—of thekey point that the deity we are visualizing, our guru, and our own mind areindivisible. What I share here comes from my own experience, limited though itmay be. I impart it with the intention to benefit my present vajra brothers aswell as sādhana practitioners of future generations.In this way there are four styles of development stage practice related to thefour modes of birth. We should practice primarily the one among them thatcorresponds with our own type of birth, but above all the style that is inaccord with our mental capacity. The Omniscient Lord of Dharma has mentionedthis: > Though there are four ways to meditate, you should use> The one that addresses the type of birth that predominates.> To purify habitual patterns meditate accordingly using them all.> In particular, meditate in harmony with egg birth as a beginner,> And when this is somewhat stable, with womb birth.> Once very stable, meditate in harmony with heat-and-moisture birth,> And when completely habituated, use this true stability> To develop instantaneously, in harmony with miraculous birth. The Ritual of the Three VajrasLet us now look closer at the practical application in terms of the ritual ofthe three vajras. While in Ladder to Akaniṣṭha the meditation begins with thesymbolic implement, we will instead follow the more commonly known approach, theconcise practice to purify womb birth as it is used in the majority of thetreasure texts within the tradition of the Early Translations.According to this approach, the object of purification encompasses the entireprocess that begins with the intermediate-state consciousness entering inbetween the father’s semen and the mother’s ovum, on through the completedevelopment of the body. The various parts of the visualization, then, correlateto the stages of this process. The sun disc in the seat purifies the mother’sovum, while the moon disc purifies the father’s semen. The descent of the seedsyllable (the causal samādhi) onto the seat purifies the intermediate-stateconsciousness as it enters into the combination of red and white elements withinthe mother’s womb. When the seed syllable transforms into the symbolic implementof a particular deity, it purifies the coalescence of mind, semen, and ovumafter the consciousness has entered between the red and white elements. Thesubsequent projection and absorption of light rays purifies the fetaldevelopment of aggregates, elements, and sense bases through the workings of thefour elements. The symbolic implement transforming into the complete form of thedeity purifies the habits associated with the period from the completedevelopment of the fetus until the time of birth.This style of visualization can implicitly purify the habits for the other modesof birth as well. In terms of egg birth for instance, the seed syllable purifiesthe disembodied consciousness; the symbolic implement purifies its entrancebetween the semen and ovum; the projection, absorption, and transformation intoa sphere purifies the development of the egg; and that sphere transforming intothe bodily form purifies the development of the body out of the egg. Likewise,in terms of birth from heat and moisture, the sun disc in the seat purifies theheat aspect, while the moon disc purifies the moisture aspect; the seed syllableand symbolic implement purify the intermediate-state energetic mind; theprojection, absorption, and completion of the bodily form purify the bodymaterializing out of heat and moisture when the mind, heat, and moisturecoalesce. Finally, in terms of miraculous birth, the seat purifies the place ofbirth; the seed syllable and symbolic implement purify the intermediate-stateenergetic mind; the projection and absorption purify the craving for a home andbody, which is further sustained by grasping; and the completion of the bodilyform represents and purifies the instantaneous creation of the body.The result of purification for the ritual of the three vajras is to manifestenlightened emanation bodies to guide whoever is in need, acting out the processof entering into the womb and taking birth. The process of purification beginswith the ritual of the seed syllable of enlightened speech, in which the causalseed syllable suspended in space descends onto the seat. Then, in the ritual ofthe symbolic implement of enlightened mind, it transforms into the symbolicimplement of a particular buddha family, marked in the center by the seedsyllable. This then projects countless light rays, inviting the buddhas of theten directions into the sky before you, who then dissolve into thesyllable-marked implement in the form of light rays. Finally, in the ritual ofthe complete enlightened body, the symbolic implement with its seed syllabletransforms into the resultant vajra holder, meaning the bodily form of avisualized deity, vivid and complete with the major and minor marks.This is a way of taking the emanation body, the pure form of the birth state, asthe path. It also matures one for the completion stage. For instance, the sunand moon united upon the lotus seat represent the blissful heat in the contextof the higher paths where the blazing and dripping converge in the cakras of thecentral channel. The seed syllable and symbolic implement represent theenergetic mind dissolving into the central channel. The projection andabsorption of light and the subsequent transformation represent the empty blissproduced by the melting bliss. The completion of the bodily form represents theability to manifest out of empty bliss in the form of the wisdom deity, thenatural and innate empty bliss.This explanation has been in terms of a single primary deity but can also beapplied to the development of the other, secondary deities. For this there arefive steps. (1) First, visualize the complete form of the central deity. (2)Next, visualize the female consort’s seed syllable, and then (3) as ittransforms, the female consort. (4) Then visualize the three-tiered beings, andfinally 5) seal with the lord of the family.With regard to the ground, these five stages purify, respectively: (1) birth asan infant; (2) engaging in courtship, once one has come of age and feels thepangs of lust; (3) the act of taking a wife; (4) the progressive development ofone’s physical, verbal, and mental abilities; and (5) mastery over one’s familytrade. With regard to the fruition, they correspond respectively to: (1) takingbirth as an enlightened emanation body; (2) becoming a renunciant and undergoinghardship in pursuit of enlightenment; (3) emerging from austerities and going toBodhgayā; (4) taming the demons and developing concentration; and (5) gainingthe wisdom of complete omniscience.With regard to the higher path, the five steps mature the practitioner toaccomplish the empty and blissful form of the wisdom deity. They do so by layingthe foundation for manifesting out of the blissful energetic mind in the form ofthe deity. This involves relying on either one of the two seals in pursuit ofthe supreme spiritual accomplishments and thereby gradually cultivatingintrinsic wisdom. In this way one swiftly connects to the supreme spiritualaccomplishment.Likewise, when there is a visualization of retinue deities, the object ofpurification is the previous child conceiving its own sons and daughters. Theresult of purification is to project, through the great bliss of all buddhas,infinite emanations out of delightful clouds of music. It is also to establishone’s retinue at the level of enlightenment, indicated by their birth withinone’s buddha family. The process of purification is to visualize the deities inthe retinue who develop from their seed syllables. This is the most that can besaid about this here; you should also look to the specific details described inyour particular text. The Characteristics of the DeityThe third section concerns the characteristics of the visualized deity. At thispoint a definitive description of the object of meditation cannot be made aboveand beyond what appears in the practice manual of the deity that is beingvisualized. We can, however, identify meditation deities in general as beingeither peaceful or wrathful, and then describe the nine traits and thirteenenjoyment body ornaments of peaceful deities (the latter of which applygenerally in the Early Translations), as well as the nine expressions of thedance, glorious attributes, and charnel ground ornaments, which apply towrathful deities. The Nine Traits of Peaceful Deities> 1. Peaceful deities have soft bodies, arms, and legs, symbolizing the> purification of birth and the fact that pride is naturally purified without> being given up.> 2. They are well proportioned, with thin waists and smooth curves, showing> that anger and sickness are naturally purified.> 3. They are not slack, but firm, showing that desire and death are naturally> purified. This may also be shown in the embrace between means and knowledge.> 4. Their bodies are straight, and their joints amazingly flexible, showing> that envy is naturally purified.> 5. They are supple and have a youthful demeanor, showing that delusion and> aging are naturally purified. These are the five essential qualities.> 6. Furthermore, being free of ignorance, their bodies are immaculate, with> hues that are vivid and distinct.> 7. Having unfolded the wisdom that perfects the sphere of totality, they are> radiant, while glowing and emanating countless light rays.> 8. Being beautiful and dignified, they are majestic, replete with the flowers> of the major marks and the fruit of the minor marks.> 9. Finally, since they have perfected all supreme qualities, their> magnificence overwhelms the beings in need of guidance. The Thirteen Enjoyment Body OrnamentsAmong the thirteen enjoyment body ornaments, the first five are the fivegarments of divine silk, which symbolize the eradication of the disturbingemotions that afflict beings. These include: blue silk ribbons with whitepatterns that dangle down the back; a five-colored silk diadem, a set offluttering silk ribbons strung over the ears; dancing sleeves that come to theshoulders; a shirt of white silk embroidered with gold; and a dhoti, amulticolored type of lower garment, which sometimes appears instead as a skirtthat is entirely maroon.Since they have refined sense pleasures into ornaments without giving them up,they also wear eight jeweled ornaments, which symbolize the fulfillment ofbeings’ wishes. On their heads they wear a crest-shaped hollow crown of preciousmetal with a jewel at its peak. On each ear they wear earrings of preciousmaterials inlaid with gems. They wear necklaces of three lengths: a chokerstrung with various alternating jewels, a similarly-made necklace that hangsdown to the upper chest, and a long necklace that hangs down below the navel.They also wear jewel-inlaid armbands, as well as two bracelets, two anklets, andrings on their fingers and toes, all similarly designed. Lastly, they have abelt decorated with studded gems.These ornaments are sometimes counted in slightly different ways. For instance,some count the necklace and long necklace together, or the bracelets and ankletstogether, while counting the rings separately. Some even exclude the rings andinstead count each of the first eight individually. In any case, the ornamentsthemselves are just as described here.Moreover, in terms of the seven factors of enlightenment, the jeweled necklacerepresents mindfulness, the crown represents the discernment of phenomena, thebracelets represent diligence, the earrings represent pliancy, the armbandsrepresent concentration, the long necklace represents equanimity, and the flowergarland represents joy.In addition, the six perfections can be linked to the bone ornaments of the maledeity, in the sense that the necklace represents generosity, the braceletsdiscipline, the earrings patience, the crown wheel diligence, the beltconcentration, and the offering thread, known as the serka, knowledge.In terms of the female deity, her nakedness represents freedom from theobscuration of conceptual thought. Her age of sixteen years represents immutablegreat bliss endowed with the sixteen joys. Her hair hangs loose, symbolizing theboundless unfolding of basic space and wisdom. She is also adorned with fivebone ornaments: the wheel of bones representing the wisdom of basic space, thenecklace representing the wisdom of equality, the earrings representingdiscerning wisdom, the bracelets representing mirrorlike wisdom, and the beltrepresenting all-accomplishing wisdom.The male and female embrace each others’ bodies, symbolic of the fact thatemptiness and compassion are not separate. Their mouths are joined in a kiss,symbolic of one taste, the simplicity of flawless great bliss. They remainindivisible with vajra and lotus joined in union, symbolic of the unity of calmabiding and insight. The Nine Expressions of the DanceWrathful deities convey the nine dancing expressions. > 1. The first of these is captivating, which is an expression of passion. It> refers to the essence of Vairocana, which is the deities’ seductiveness, as> they are adorned with jewelry, the male and female consorts are embracing,> etc.> 2. They are also heroic, an expression of wrath, referring to the essence of> Ratnasambhava, the fact that they are so powerful as to be invincible.> 3. They are terrifying, an expression of stupidity, referring to the essence> of Akṣobhya, the way that they instill fear merely upon sight.These first three are their three physical expressions. > 4. They are laughing, the essence of Amitābha, emitting sounds of laughter> like “Ha ha!” due to their state of passionate, haughty glee.> 5. They are ferocious, the essence of Amoghasiddhi, berating with abusive> words like “Capture! Strike!”> 6. They are fearsome, the essence of Māmakī, as they overwhelm with fierce> roaring sounds similar to thunder cracks.These three are their verbal expressions. > 7. They are compassionate, the essence of Samayatāra, taking ignorant beings> and realms under their care with nonconceptual compassion.> 8. They are intimidating, the essence of Pāṇḍarāvasinī, meaning they are> capable of anything necessary to tame incorrigible beings with their wrath,> their state of mind being overcome by passionate wrath.> 9. Finally, they are peaceful, the essence of Locanā, referring to their> nonconceptual realization that everything is the same taste in true reality.These are their three mental expressions. The Eight Attributes of the Glorious OneThe eight attributes of the Glorious One are so called because they areprimordially and intrinsically present on the body of the Great Glorious One. Itseems, however, that there are some slight discrepancies in the ways these areidentified. Nevertheless, The Divine Realization Tantra describes these clearlyand also mentions their symbolism. According to this scripture they are: > 1. Hair tied in a knot for reversing cyclic existence> 2. Vajra garuḍa wings of method and knowledge> 3. A dark-blue diadem for overpowering eternalism and nihilism> 4. A vajra at the crown indicating supreme awareness> 5. A mighty coat of armor to advance in splendor> 6. The knowledge consort with whom the deity is in nondual union> 7. The iron of a hero for repelling harm and malevolence> 8. Vajra fire for incinerating disturbing emotions The Eight Charnel Ground OrnamentsThe eight charnel ground ornaments are decorations representing triumph andheroism. In the past they were the spoils of the liberation of Rudra, donned bythe Great Glorious One as ornaments on his body. They include the three worngarments, the two fastened ornaments, and the three smeared things."},{"pageContent":" The three garments are: > 1. The entire skin of a human> 2. An upper garment of elephant hide> 3. A skirt of tiger skin The two fastened ornaments are: > 4. Skull ornaments, which consist of:> a. A crown of five dry skulls> b. A necklace of fifty fresh skulls> c. Armbands of skull fragments> d. Bracelets and anklets > 5. Snake ornaments, which are types of jewelry resembling venomous snakes:> a.

A black necklace of the untouchable caste The three smeared things are: > 6. A clot of human ash on the forehead> 7. Drops of blood on the cheeks or, alternatively, on the cheeks and tip of> the nose> 8. Smears of grease on the chin Certain deities are of a semiwrathful type. They wear an elephant skin uppergarment, symbolizing the defeat of ignorance by means of the ten powers ofknowledge. They are swathed in a tiger skin skirt, representing the defeat ofanger by means of heroic wrathful activities. They are adorned with silkstreamers, symbolizing the defeat of desire by the mind of awakening. They havea crown of five dry skulls, the identity of the five buddhas, which representsthe defeat of pride. They wear a necklace of fifty fresh heads strung togetheras a garland, symbolizing the purity of the fifty mental states after envy hasbeen defeated. Finally, their bodies are adorned with the bone ornaments, whichhave the nature of the six perfections. You should visualize all this as it isdescribed in your particular text.Blessing and Empowerment This section covers (1) bestowing blessings and (2) conferring empowerment.BlessingWhen blessings are bestowed, the object of purification is the stage ofmaturation of the infant’s physical, verbal, and mental abilities. The result ofpurification is the attainment of mastery over the inconceivable secrets ofenlightened body, speech, and mind at the time of awakening. The process ofpurification utilizes the samaya maṇḍala you have already developed. You nextvisualize a white syllable OṂ, representing vajra body, clear and glowing, inthe skull palace cakra at the crowns of both the central and retinue deities inthe maṇḍala. At their throat cakras visualize a clear and glowing red syllableĀḤ, representing vajra speech. In their hearts visualize a clear and glowingblue syllable HŪṂ, representing vajra mind. It should be in front of the wisdombeing in the hearts of the primary male and female deities, while in front ofthe awakened life force syllable of the others. There are sometimes otherdetails as well, such as visualizing these syllables within a wheel, lotus, andvajra at the three respective places, and visualizations of the forms ofVairocana, Amitābha, and Akṣobhya. For these you should follow your text.In any case, take pride in joining the ground and fruition by having solidconviction that body, speech, and mind in their pure state are the three vajrasof all the thus-gone ones. In terms of the higher path, the three elements ofsemen, ovum, and energy correlate to enlightened body, speech, and mind. Byeradicating their impure aspects, you set a foundation for the dawning of thewisdom that emerges when their pure aspects flourish.EmpowermentDuring empowerment the object of purification consists of the coarse, disturbedthought processes that come about as the infant’s channels and elements develop.The result of purification is to be empowered, at the time of awakening, as theDharma King of the three realms and sovereign of all thus-gone ones. Here theprocess of purification entails the bestowal of empowerment, with mantra andgesture, upon the five places of the heads of all the deities: the crown,forehead, tip of the right ear, nape of the neck, and tip of the left ear. Placethe lord of the particular family in primary position in the middle, exchanginghis place with Vairocana.When empowerment is granted, the male and female buddhas appear out of seedsyllables and join in union. A stream of nectar of the mind of awakening, thenature of the five wisdoms, then pours down from the places of union. This fillsup your body, cleanses away obscurations, and purifies the five poisons into thefive wisdoms. As the excess liquid overflows above and dissolves into theintrinsically present lord of the family, take pride that you have realized thegoal of your inherent wisdom. There are a number of stages here, such asinviting the empowerment deities and the actual bestowal of empowerment, whichyou should apply according to context. In relation to the completion stage, thisprocess matures you for the higher path by creating the cause for theempowerment of the five poisons that takes place through the progression andreversal of the four joys. It also creates the cause for the energetic mind todissolve into the crown protuberance.INVITING AND WELCOMING THE WISDOM BEINGS Here the object of purification is the child’s process of gaining the sameaptitude as others in his caste before him. The result of purification is tounite with the wisdom of all the thus-gone ones at the time of awakening,thereby arriving at an equal experience, inseparable from their realization. Theprocess of purification consists of inviting and dissolving the wisdom beings,and has two parts: first inviting and then welcoming the natural wisdom maṇḍala.To invite the wisdom maṇḍala, you, as the samaya being, project light rays inthe shape of hooks from your seed syllable, the awakened life force. These lightrays permeate all the naturally and spontaneously present pure realms, wherethey cause the thus-gone ones of the four times and ten directions to manifestin a skillful dance of form bodies without leaving the great equality of thedharma body. As they take the forms of the deities in the maṇḍala you arepracticing, complete in its supporting and supported aspects, imagine that theyactually arrive in the sky in front of you. Fumigate with incense made ofspecial substances and play various instruments. Then, with your mind in a stateof one-pointed faith, chant the invitation verse in a melodious way. While stillvisualizing yourself in the samaya maṇḍala, imagine that they arrive in the skyabove you at the place where the flames of the protection circles meet.Second, to welcome the wisdom deities you have just invited into the samayamaṇḍala, say the general mantra DZAḤ HŪṂ BĀṂ HOḤ. With DZAḤ, you summon thewisdom deities into the samaya maṇḍala; with HŪṂ, they dissolve indivisibly;with BĀṂ, they are bound by an indestructible oath to remain until youraspirations are fulfilled; and with HOḤ, you welcome them to remain, continuallyand joyfully. This serves to remove any fixation on the samaya being as inferiorand the wisdom being as superior, and confirms that the wisdom maṇḍala isinseparable from your mind. It also serves as a way for you to receive theblessings of all the buddhas. Finally, it replicates the way the symbolicluminosity points out the actual wisdom in the context of the higher paths,while laying a foundation for the wisdom of the nonduality of saṃsāra andnirvāṇa to emerge in your being.OFFERING AND PRAISE Next, the description of the offerings and praise to the nondual maṇḍala has twoparts: a general explanation of the principles of purification, perfection, andmaturation, and then a description of the actual practice.For the first, the object of purification is the frivolous pleasure the childtakes in things such as food, drink, dress, jewelry, and houses, its partialitywith regard to property and possessions, and efforts to attain fame, fortune,and a certain economic status. The result of purification is to become, at thetime of awakening, an unsurpassed object of reverence and veneration, alwayssurrounded by infinite clouds of offerings. This is what is perfected. Theprocess of purification consists of the procedures for homage, offering, andpraise. This process matures you by forming a basis for you to revel in the playof awareness discipline during the higher path.Secondly, the actual practice process involves three stages: homage, offering,and praise.Homage Generally speaking, the superior mode of practice is the “homage of resoluteunity”: to realize that you are inseparable from the deity and then remain inthe nondual equality in which the samaya and wisdom beings have merged, likewater poured into water. This can be applied to the offering and praise as well;in fact, if you realize this, it is fine to forgo any separate conventional,conceptual homage or offering. Still, in a mere relative sense, you can followin the manner of common respect and conform to the style of the outer tantras bypaying homage and making offerings, etc. This is the approach of the unexcelledpractice system where one resolves that the displays are merely self-projectionsand recognizes their nondual nature. Just as the gods in Delightful Emanationsrevel in their own magically-created pleasures, imagine that either a secondbodily form like yourself or else emanated goddesses emerge from the heart ofthe central deity and offer the homage. They say, “ATIPU HOḤ,” representingtheir homage, and the deities accept the homage by responding, “PRATĪCCHA HOḤ.”Offering The offering has four aspects: outer, inner, innermost, and suchness.Outer Offerings For the outer offering, visualize yourself as the central deity and imagine thatclouds of goddesses of the sense pleasures project out of your heart. In themanner of deities worshipping deities, these fill up the infinitude of space andbestow offerings. Recite the offering verse from your text and imagine that theemanated goddesses, holding their respective offerings, present them and thendissolve into their respective places.The offerings include: a beverage of sweet, cool, and pure drinking water; cleanand refreshing bathing water for the hands and feet; brilliant and beautifulflowers for the eyes; fragrant incense for the nose; illuminating lamps for theeyes; cool, fragrant perfume for the heart; rich, nutritious food for thetongue; and lovely music for the ears.These all have a particular symbolism. The flower is a symbol of the beauty andbrilliance of wisdom awareness. Incense symbolizes the way nonconceptualcompassion burns away concepts. The lamp is a symbol of intrinsic luminositydispelling the darkness of ignorance. The perfume is a symbol of the extremelyprofound unconstructed wakefulness of spacious awareness unfolding and pervadingall things. The bathing water symbolizes wakefulness cleaning away the stains ofconcepts. The food and drinking water are symbols of the taste of untaintedconcentration. Finally, the music symbolizes the perpetual, audible, yet emptysound of mantra.Also included here are the five sense pleasures—visible form, sound, smell,taste, and texture—in the way that they create pleasure as objects of the fivesenses. On an inner level, when male and female join together and share inecstasy, there are also visible forms to behold, laughing sounds of union, thescent of satiation with bliss, the taste of the melting bliss, and texture inthe contact between the secret vajra and space, as well as the white and redsubstances. These are inner sense pleasures in the sense that they are phenomenathat cause all inner and outer phenomena to arise as empty bliss. They appear inthe forms of goddesses who express the sixteen types of joy—four times the fourof joy, supreme joy, extraordinary joy, and intrinsic joy.Inner Offerings The inner offering is divided into two: a common and a special type. The common type includes certain symbolic offerings, such as the flowers of thefive senses, which are the sacred substances of the eyes, tongue, ears, nose,and heart, naturally present in a clean corpse. In addition, there are: incensemade of human fat for fumigation and burnt offerings, butter lamps fueled byhuman oil with wicks of corpse hair, perfume made of bile, and food offerings ofhuman flesh.These all have a particular symbolism as well. The brilliant and beautifulflower represents the five subtle physical faculties that are inherently presentin the bodies of living beings. These faculties form the support for the fivesense consciousnesses and relate exclusively to their respective objects. Theincense offering of burnt human fat represents the odor that comes from theimpure aspect of flesh, which is the source of the fatty tissue. The oil lamprepresents the fluid that results from human oil, which gives the body itsradiant complexion. The perfume represents the gall bladder, a repository ofodor. Finally, the food offering consists of the nutrients that come fromdigesting food and drink and which develop one’s flesh and blood. Here it isused to feed the deities of the aggregates, elements, and sense sources.Beyond this, you can make actual or mentally created offerings of the outer andinner sensual pleasures, offer things you do not even own, and imagine countlessclouds of offerings produced through the power of aspiration. The special inner offering consists of medicine, torma, and rakta. For the medicine offering consider that everything within saṃsāra and nirvāṇaexists as an unfabricated, naturally present nectar. For this reason the sacredsubstance composed of the proper combination of the eight primary and onethousand subsidiary ingredients can emerge from the equality of true reality. Itis the identity of the five wisdoms and the five buddha families, an essentialextract of medicinal nectar that dispels thoughts of dualistic fixation.Take this nectar with your thumb and ring finger—the amulet of the sun andmoon—and offer it, imagining that you have delighted the deities. Then imaginethat the deities project all spiritual accomplishments and the blessings ofenlightened body, speech, and mind from their three places in the form of thethree seed syllables, which land upon the nectar. Again, take some nectarbetween your thumb and ring finger and touch it to your three places and thenyour tongue, while thinking that you have attained the accomplishments of thethree vajras.In the secret meaning, the five nectars refer to the pure essences of the fiveaggregates, while the five meats refer to the pure essences of the five senses.They constitute an ambrosia nectar because the accomplishment of immortality isgained by retaining them without letting them leak out.Next is the torma offering. Imagine that the outer container of completely purespace is the torma vessel, which contains the edible and drinkable tormasubstances along with everything desirable. Then offer it while you emanate itout in the form of vast clouds of the five sense pleasures. Imagine that tubesof light emerge from the vajra-shaped tongues of the deities with which theydraw up and imbibe the contents, so that your bond with them is mended. Youshould also bring to mind the true meaning that the foods are the five senseobjects and the drinks are the consciousnesses. In this way the contents areimbibed and subsequently dissolve within the expanse of luminosity.For the rakta offering consider that the root of the disturbing emotions is ourconceptual grasping and attachment to the three realms, which in fact createscyclic existence. To cut cyclic existence from the root, condense all attachedthoughts into the form of blood and vanquish them into unattached great bliss.Thereafter, within the basic space of the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, offerthis sacred substance, gathered into an ocean of pure essence and liberatedwithin the nonarising expanse of saṃsāra. The real meaning here is that thecourse of the sun and moon is arrested at the tip of the secret space, wherebythe continuity of saṃsāra is cut. Think that by making this offering saṃsāra, asan ocean of blood, is consumed, so that the realms of cyclic existence areemptied.Innermost Offerings Third, the innermost offering has two aspects: union and liberation. For the offering of union one should consider that all of appearance is of thenature of skillful means, the male aspect, while emptiness, in its entirety, isknowledge, the female consort. These two in essence remain indivisible. The factthat all phenomena are, in this way, naturally a nondual union constitutes theview of appearance and existence being a primordial unity. As an expression ofthis, while sustaining the three notions, visualize yourself as the male andfemale deities in union. Through their union, as the four joys unfold in forwardand reverse order via descending flow and ascending stabilization, the offeringcloud of stainless nondual bliss and emptiness is established. This pleases theperfect circle of the deities, who are themselves the original purity of theaggregates, elements, and sense sources.In the liberation offering the enemies that one seeks to liberate are thedisturbing emotions, which come about through strong dualistic fixation andbelief in a self. These emotions prevent our liberation and lead us into bondagein the three realms of cyclic existence. They are all liberated by the sharpweapon of nondual wisdom, the perfected essence of natural awareness, into theexpanse of great equality, empty awareness itself, the basic space of the sensesources’ primordial purity. This is the true meaning of the triple world beingprimordially liberated.As a manifestation of this primordial liberation, one should give rise to greatcompassion and then liberate, in an illusory way, the beings who lack thisrealization. Such beings are of ten types, including malevolent demons andrudras, impelled as they are by the ripening of vicious karma. Liberate theirsupported consciousnesses into basic space and place them within the circle ofgreat bliss. Then offer their aggregates of flesh, blood, and bones—impureresidue of the three poisons—as food to the deities and imagine the deities aredelighted.Suchness Offerings For the offering of suchness consider that all phenomena contained withinappearance and existence, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, are primordially the nature ofenlightenment—perfect within the single sphere of equality free of elaboration.Therefore, there is no duality in terms of an object to whom we offer, a personmaking the offering, and an act of offering; these are indivisibly of one tastein the maṇḍala of the mind of awakening. Thus, to offer all of appearance withinthe seal of Samantabhadra’s conduct, the great bliss of unity, is the mosteminent offering of all.Praise It says in the Karmamāla: > Wield the vajra and ring the bell,> Make the whirling gestures of the five families. First, make the relevant gestures. Then join your palms, bow, and offer praiseswhile bringing to mind the buddhas’ supreme qualities.To describe these in brief, the ultimate dharma body of the buddhas is endowedwith the twofold purity—both the primordial, natural purity of the basic spaceof phenomena and the freedom from all incidental conceptual elaborations ofsubject and object. While not wavering from this vast equality, the buddhasappear to disciples in the symbolic forms of great wisdom, in whatever way isbefitting. They manifest the various displays of the central and retinuedeities, whether peaceful and adorned with the major and minor marks or wrathfuland terrifying, mesmerizing with their dances.However, although they manifest in this way, the buddhas ultimately lack eventhe slightest material existence, both in appearance and in essence. With oneinstance of their perfectly melodious speech they can instantaneously reveal thecountless ways of the Dharma to their innumerable disciples, each according tothe disciple’s inclination. At the same time, their speech is ultimately theinvincible voice of indestructible resonance, beyond words and effort. Withtheir wisdom mind that knows things both as they are and in their extent theyinstantaneously perceive all that can be known in the three times. In essence,nonetheless, they never waver from resting evenly in equality, the nature ofwhich is beyond perceived and perceiver.They have mastery over inconceivable qualities such as the ten powers, thefearlessnesses, and the unique attributes. Still, essentially they remain in onetaste, inseparable in the three times from undefiled basic space. Theirinconceivable enlightened activity to benefit beings in any way necessaryextends constantly and spontaneously to the innumerable beings in need ofguidance for as long as cyclic existence lasts. At the same time, they areutterly free of any effort or thought-movement.These constitute the supreme qualities of the inexhaustible ornament wheel ofenlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity, while the supportingand supported maṇḍalas manifest as their specific expression. Here you shouldbring to mind the symbolism of every aspect of these maṇḍalas as described inyour particular text, and while doing so, sing vajra songs of praise.Furthermore, it is crucial to understand the inherent equality of the objectbeing praised, the subject offering the praise, and the act of praising,considering that in ultimate truth it is the innate, intrinsic wisdom of yourown mind—great bliss, simplicity, awakened mind without beginning or end—thatappears in the symbolic form of the maṇḍala circle.THE APPEARANCE OF THE DEITY The training in holding the appearance of the deity, the primary object offocus, has four aspects: (1) vivid appearance, (2) stable pride, (3)recollection of purity, and (4) manifesting as bliss, clarity, and emptiness.Vivid Appearance In terms of the authentic path of definitive perfection, vivid appearanceincludes seven aspects: > 1. Holding the deity in mind> 2. Correcting faults that involve change> 3. Parting from the deity> 4. Taking the deity onto the path> 5. Mingling with the deity> 6. Connecting the deity to ultimate truth> 7. Taking the deity as the path These, however, can all be understood by reading the detailed explanations inIlluminating Jewel Lamp: Essential General Points on Approach andAccomplishment, composed by the lord guru of unmatched kindness, whose very nameis difficult to mention, the true and definite great vajra holder Pema GarwangLodro Thaye. Since I am writing this text as a supplement and act of reverenceto it, I hesitate to say anything more.To summarize though, all of these points come down to visualizing the supportingand supported maṇḍalas perfectly complete in a single instant. At first, hold inmind the general appearance of the central figure’s form, and then scan throughthe specific features, from the crown protuberance down to the throne, includingthe subtle details of the body, symbolic implements, ornaments, and garments.When these appear vividly, visualize the central figure completely in onemoment. Then proceed from there until you can rest evenly while keeping theentirety of the supporting and supported maṇḍala in one-pointed focus, like astar or planet appearing in a clear lake. Otherwise, beyond the fact that youshould begin by concentrating on whatever is easiest to keep in mind, there isno particular fixed order or session length, so practice in accord with yourindividual temperament.After you have become adept in this practice, train in acquiring the eightmeasures of clarity and stability. Among these, first are the four measures ofclarity. The visualization should be distinct, meaning it should be unblurreddown to the pupils of the eyes. It should be alive, meaning there should be thesharpness of awareness, empty and lucid with an awake quality, rather than alethargic state that lacks the intense clarity of awareness. It should bevibrant, meaning it is not made of mindless matter like a rainbow, but ratherall features, even down to the pores of the skin and single strands of hair, aresuffused with omniscient wisdom. Thus, it is radiantly present, with the brightquality of the senses manifest a hundredfold. Finally, it should be vivid,appearing to your mind as if it were directly in front of you, rather than aconceptual speculation concerning the deity’s form.Of the four measures of stability, the first is unwavering, meaning not waveringdue to laziness, absent-mindedness, etc. The visualization should be unchanging,meaning that it does not become, for instance, blurry or vague. It should beutterly unchangeable, meaning though you remain composed for a long time, subtlethoughts will not disturb you. Finally, it should be flexible, meaning that youare able to visualize anything just as it should be, such as the color of thebody, the face, arms, movement or stillness, or the projection and absorption oflight rays.Vivid appearance refers to having attained these eight measures of clarity andstability.Stable Pride Stable pride refers to the pride we take in joining ground and fruition, as wasexplained in detail above. The main point, in short, is to take pride in beingthe deity you are practicing, the universal splendor of the wisdom of allbuddhas, who has eradicated all flaws and perfected all qualities. This is not asimple pretense but an acknowledgment of how things are. Our innate body,speech, and mind are primordially the essence of the three vajras, and soeverything that manifests out of them—our concepts, aggregates, elements, andsense sources—are primordially pure, nothing other than the manifestation of thedeity. Therefore, since there is no deity to meditate on and accomplishelsewhere, we can have pride—i.e., confidence—in the realization that we, as themeditators, are no different from the deities we are practicing. If in this waywe understand how to reach the innate by keeping such pride continuously,vividly, and without clinging to it, we can follow the authentic swift path.The object of purification, in this case, includes ordinary, impure experience,as well as grasping pride that fixates in an impure manner. The former ispurified by vivid appearance, and the latter by recollecting purity; training inthese transforms them respectively into pure vivid appearance and pure stablepride.Recollecting Purity The general points for recollecting purity were discussed earlier in the sectionon the development of the deity, in the context of the purity of the supportingand supported maṇḍalas.In terms of specific details, though, if a meditation deity has one face, itrepresents the single sphere of the dharma body, while one with three headssymbolizes the three bodies of enlightenment, or the three gates to completeliberation. Two arms symbolize the unity of method and knowledge, four symbolizethe activity to benefit beings via the four immeasurables, and six symbolize thesix wisdoms, which are the five plus inconceivable wisdom. Two legs representnot dwelling in either extreme of existence or tranquility, while four representthe four legs of miracles.Being white in color symbolizes the mirrorlike wisdom and being unstained byfaults. Yellow represents the wisdom of equality and the unfolding of thesupreme qualities. Red represents discerning wisdom and a loving, compassionateconcern for the welfare of the beings in need of guidance. Green representsall-accomplishing wisdom and the spontaneous accomplishment of unobstructedenlightened activity. Blue and black represent the wisdom of the basic space ofthings and immutable true reality.In terms of the symbolic implements, the vajra is a symbol of the unconditioned,the wheel symbolizes cutting through disturbing emotions, the jewel signifiesqualities emerging, the lotus is a symbol of being unstained by defects, and thecrossed-vajra and sword indicate unobstructed activity. The bell is a symbol ofemptiness, nonarising basic space. The kapāla symbolizes sustaining bliss andnonconceptual wisdom. The khaṭvāṅga staff shows liberation within the expanse ofthe three bodies of enlightenment. The curved knife symbolizes cutting birth anddeath at the root. The large horn is a symbol of conquering the four demons withgreat wisdom and then subduing, or offering up, cyclic existence. When the deityhas a male appearance it represents skillful means and immutable great bliss,while a female appearance represents knowledge and emptiness suffused with theexcellence of all aspects. The union of male and female symbolizes that blissand emptiness are beyond unity and separation. Beyond this, you should meditateon the specific associations of purity as described in your particular text.In conclusion, the main point is that the qualities of enlightenment arenaturally and spontaneously present within our innate nature. Whatever qualitiesa deity may have, they are pure as the essential nature of that deity. In short,your thoughts are pure as the deity, the deity is pure as wisdom, and wisdom isthe dharma body of enlightenment, discernment free of subject and object. Whilethe dharma body has no characteristics whatsoever, such as a face or arms, itsinconceivable qualities can still manifest with features of a face, arms, andornaments. In this way, the dharma body is the dominion of spontaneouslyaccomplished enlightened activity. You should, therefore, keep in mind that thedeity you are concentrating on in meditation is pure and free from the slightestconcrete, material existence. You should, of course, remember these points aboutpurity when you are chanting through a liturgy, but in this context inparticular you should train in the specific points of purity with sincereconviction. After developing a solid conviction in them, rest evenly inmeditation while maintaining the pride and vivid appearance of the deity as theywere described above.Bliss, Clarity, and Emptiness The basic identity of the meditation deity is the wisdom of bliss, clarity, andemptiness, which relate to three aspects of training. First is to draw out themelting bliss by meditating on the male and female deities joined passionatelyin union. Second is to train in the clear appearance of the deity’s form withinthat physical and mental experience of bliss. Third is to train in vivid prideunspoiled by clinging. When you seal your practice with these key points, it isan incredible method for letting any maṇḍala manifest as the dharma body.Even if you are unable to do this, when you are training in the developmentstage of vivid appearance, recollection of purity, and stable pride, it is vitalto be free of thoughts that cling to something as truly there. You should dothis with an understanding that the visualization is empty, in essence, while bynature it is like a rainbow or a moon reflected in water, appearing whilelacking real characteristics. Sealing the development stage with the completionstage, in this way, is the method for manifesting any maṇḍala as the dharmabody. It becomes a path that joins the two accumulations since the appearancesof the relative development stage gather the accumulation of merit while theultimate accumulation of wisdom is accrued through embracing those appearanceswith thorough insight into their nature, the unconditioned absolute. Moreover,it is a complete and unmistaken path in which method and knowledge are unified.This is to say that it incorporates the two bodies of enlightenment—theappearing form body and the empty dharma body—as well as the two truths: themethod of relative appearance and the knowledge of ultimate emptiness.Understand that this is the special quality of the profound and swift path ofmantra.If you lack this understanding and take up a one-sided development stage as ifit were concrete and material, it will not become a path to enlightenment, butonly a terrible impediment that binds you to cyclic existence. If you meditateon a peaceful deity as if it were materially existent, you will be born as a godin the desire realm, while if you meditate on a wrathful deity in this way, youwill be reborn as an evil worldly spirit or a powerful demon like Rudra. In theannals of the Secret Mantra tradition there are stories of this actuallyhappening.To conclude, it is important to practice the development stage with the threeelements of vivid appearance, recollection of purity, and stable pride for aslong as possible without becoming weary and fatigued. When you do become weary,begin the recitation.In most unelaborate daily practices and in the tradition of the higher yogas,the section from blessing and empowerment up until the praises is often omitted.This is not problematic since the identity of the wisdom being is sublimeultimate truth, the innate essence of your own mind, in which the sevenriches—basic space, wisdom, enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities, andactivities—are spontaneously present. As well, all conceptual phenomena thatmanifest as its expression—including the aggregates, elements, and sensesources—are the sublime relative truth, remaining primordially as the circle ofthe deities in the three seats of completeness.Furthermore, when you take this as the path and meditate on the maṇḍalas ofsupport and supported, that is the samaya being. The wisdom being and samayabeing remain primordially indivisible, like gold and its golden color orturquoise and its blue color. To train in meditation in accord with this fact isthe absorption being. Therefore, if we can understand that these three are, bynature, one identity, we will not fixate on the wisdom being as superior and thesamaya being as inferior. Once we no longer make such concepts, the act ofsealing, receiving empowerment, and the other parts of the process ofpurification are not necessary; the invitation, offering, praise, and so on arecomplete within the essence. The Secret Essence proclaims: > Everything that exists, without exception,> Is nothing other than the Buddha.> The Buddha himself cannot find> Anything that is not the Buddha. In The Marvels it is explained: > In the recognition and practice of the maṇḍala> Of primordial, spontaneous equality> There is no need for conceptual stages> Like inviting and requesting to depart. Similarly, The Two Segments declares: > The deity is you, and you are the deity.> You and the deity are coemergent.> So there’s no need to invite, nor request to remain.> Visualize your mind as the divine master. It also says: > The deity and mantra truly dwell> In the nature free of constructs. In short, we should see the vital point expressed by the Omniscient Lord ofDharma in Resting in the Nature of Mind: > Your mind is originally the nature of the deity.> Your body is the maṇḍala, words are Secret Mantra.> When everything is great wisdom, spontaneously perfect,> There are no separate samaya and wisdom beings, no invocation or welcome,> No need to request them to depart.> Nothing good you should do, or bad you should not.> When you bring to mind the fact that the maṇḍala is primordial,> And that that maṇḍala is within you,> There is no need to create what was never created.ENLIGHTENED SPEECH The recitation practice of enlightened speech has three divisions: (1) a generalpresentation of the key points of the four stakes that bind the life force, (2)a specific explanation of the relevant visualizations, and (3) a description ofthe extra concluding rituals.THE FOUR STAKES THAT BIND THE LIFE FORCE The thirty-ninth chapter of The Tantra of the Perfect Secret says: > Whether wisdom or mundane, if the four stakes> That bind the life force are not planted,> Practice will never be fruitful, like running in place.> The way to capture the life force of all glorious ones> Is to understand one point and attain the life force of all,> Just as Rahula swallows the sun out of the sky,> And, without having to catch its reflection> In all the thousands of pools of water,> Attains the life force of them all.> Thus, the four stakes that bind the life force are vital. In this quote, “running in place” means to undergo a pointless hardship, like achild who is tricked with an empty promise. The life force of the entiredevelopment stage is contained in the “four stakes that bind the life force,” aninstruction that works like a set of stakes in binding our body, speech, mind,and actions to the enlightened body, speech, mind, and activity of thebliss-gone ones.The Stake of Absorption In the stake of absorption you begin by focusing one-pointedly on the appearanceof the deity, for example a drawing inside a skull, as a support. By traininglike this, you can progress through all of the five meditation experiences,manifest the three types of objects, and let the intense clinging you have toyour ordinary body be perfected into the form of the deity.Of the five meditation experiences, the first is the experience of the movementof thoughts, which is to recognize thinking. It is like a waterfall cascadingover a steep cliff. The next is the experience of the attainment of a slighteasing of thoughts, like water rushing down a narrow ravine. Third is theexperience of familiarity with the tiring out of thinking, like the movements ofan old man. Fourth is the experience of stability, with only a slight formationof thoughts, like a pond undulating in the breeze. Last is the experience ofperfection of unwavering self-control, like an ocean free of waves.By training in this manner you can manifest the three types of objects in thefollowing way. First, the maṇḍalas of support and supported appear vividly clearto the mind. This is called “appearing as an object of imagination.” Second, bythe power of training in meditation the deity’s form appears as an object ofyour senses, which is known as “appearing as an object of perception.” Finally,when the energetic mind is matured into the form of the deity, others will, onoccasion, directly perceive your body as the form of the deity you arevisualizing. This stage is called “appearing as a tangible physical object.” Ihave heard firsthand the vajra holder Khyentse Wangpo say that this last stageis when you truly attain the level of a matured knowledge holder.The way that the three principles of purification, perfection, and maturationapply to this has already been explained above, so it is unnecessary to repeatit again. Nonetheless, to serve as a convenient reminder in the present context,I will quote the words of the Omniscient Śrī Nirmāṇakāya in this age of strife: > In terms of saṃsāra, this process will purify and refine away the habitual> patterns related to the body, as they relate to the four types of birth. In> terms of buddhahood, the fruition will be perfected within the ground. Here> the fruition is the inconceivable secret of enlightened body, which is beyond> having a face, hands, or marks, yet can appear in any form whatsoever, in> whatever way is needed to guide beings. In terms of the path, the web of pure> channels will be refined into the deity. This, in turn, will mature one for> the practices of the completion stage, in which the vital points of the vajra> body are penetrated. The Stake of the Essence Mantra The stake of the essence mantra will be explained later. Briefly, it means tochant with your attention one-pointedly focused on the essence mantra thatrevolves around the awakened life force (the seed syllable) within thethree-layered beings. You carry out the recitation of a certain number, such asone hundred thousand for each syllable of the mantra, or else for a certain timespan of months or years, or until a sign appears, such as having a vision of thedeity. In particular, you should practice the vajra recitation assiduously, withthe knowledge that the exhalation, inhalation, and resting of the breath aremantra.From a saṃsāric perspective, this process will purify the nature of the soundswe use to communicate, the habitual patterns related to the ordinary speech ofbeings. In the pure context of buddhahood, the fruition will be perfected in theground. Here the fruition refers to the inconceivable secret of enlightenedspeech, which transcends sounds, words, and expressions, yet appears in a wholerange of forms, such as the infinite number of teaching vehicles. In theinterim, in terms of practice, this process will purify the nature of ordinaryspeech and the subtle energies into the essence mantra. This, in turn, willmature one to carry out the completion stage practices in which one relies onthe energies, as taught in the father tantras.The Stake of Unchanging Realization Third is the stake of unchanging realization. Whether you practice a peaceful orwrathful yidam deity, such the Great Glorious One, a hybrid deity, or anoath-bound protector appearing in the form of a mundane or wisdom deity, youmust realize that it is none other than your own mind. This realization willmature you into its very essence: the great equality of the deity and reality.Moreover, everything external and internal, the universe and inhabitants thatyou visualize as the maṇḍala of support and supported, is simply a mentalmanifestation and possesses no other reality.The nature of mind is primordially the identity of the three bodies ofenlightenment. Its essence is empty, the dharma body. Its nature is lucid, theenjoyment body. Freed upon arising, with no clinging, it is the emanation body.Manifesting as its expression are the male aspect of relative appearance,method, and the female aspect of ultimate emptiness, knowledge. The circle ofthe Magical Web is the unity of these, a wisdom manifestation of indivisibleappearance and emptiness.In short, in the naturally present maṇḍala of appearance and existence asmanifest ground, material appearances are enlightened body, sounds areenlightened speech, and thoughts are enlightened mind. Within this maṇḍala, thenature of all phenomena is primordially enlightened. This is the realization weshould take up, the view of the natural state. In this way we can bind allconcepts that fixate on a distinct duality—self and other, samaya and wisdombeing, practice and goal, pure and impure—within the nondual expanse ofequality. This is not only the life force of the development stage, but thecompletion stage as well. It is the sole crucial and indispensable key pointthroughout every aspect of the development, recitation, and completion stages.The Advice of the Great Glorious One pronounces: > As the stake of unchanging realization, the Great Glorious One> And the whole range of peaceful and wrathful deities> Are none other than one’s own mind.> Even Rudra is the mind and is nowhere else.> In being empty, mind itself is the dharma body.> In being clear and distinct, it is the enjoyment body.> And appearing naturally in a variety of ways, it is the emanation body.> Appearances are the male consort and emptiness the female;> The union of appearance and emptiness is wisdom’s form.> The limitless thoughts and memories as well> Are completely perfect, the retinue of the Glorious One.> They are inconceivable and enlightened right from the start,> As they never move from this very nature.> Without the stake of unchanging realization,> Accomplishing the Great Glorious One> Will not bring supreme accomplishments,> Only the ordinary, and one will end up like Rudra. Furthermore, The Tantra of the Layered Lotus Stems describes: > A practitioner who possesses this stake can practice> An evil demon in a charnel ground, and still,> Whichever results he seeks, supreme or mundane,> Will automatically, spontaneously emerge.> Without realizing this stake, he will mistake the deity as concrete.> In that mindset he may practice a wisdom being,> And perhaps reach some temporary, trifling result,> But an authentic fruition will be nearly impossible. This is the crucial key point, not which deity you practice nor whose mantra youchant, so you should take this alone as the life force of the path.In terms of saṃsāra, this process will purify the negative mind and its habitualpatterns that are present as self-aware, natural clarity. In the context ofbuddhahood, the fruition will be perfected in the ground, this fruition beingthe inconceivable secret of enlightened mind, reality free from the complexitiesof thought and perception, as well as all the various forms this inconceivableclairvoyance can take. In the interim, in the context of practice, byfamiliarizing yourself with the reality of nondual appearance-emptiness, youwill be matured for the completion stage meditations on bliss, clarity, andnonthought, where one relies on the mind of awakening, in both its ultimate andrelative forms.The Activity Stake of Projection and Absorption The activity stake of projection and absorption involves the creation of amiraculous display that brings the countless enlightened activities one desiresunder one’s command. The basis for accomplishing this is the visualized deityand maṇḍala. Here you, as the deity, emit rays of light of the color thatcorresponds to a particular activity from the awakened life force of the seedsyllable, the mantra chain, and your various body parts. In doing so, the twogoals are fulfilled, and the universe and its inhabitants are united with thethree maṇḍalas. The focus in the visualization of projection and absorption isredirected according to what you seek to accomplish. White light pacifies,yellow enriches, red magnetizes, green or black light creates wrathful activity,and blue or multicolored light rays bring about all activities, or else supremespiritual accomplishment. A tantra explains: > If the nail of the various projections and absorptions is lacking,> You will not accomplish your goal just visualizing one thing.> But if you know how to direct the projection and absorption,> Then by practicing even the lowest tedrang spirit> You will have unhindered activity and accomplish all deeds. In a saṃsāric context this process will purify and refine away all ordinaryforms of physical, verbal, and mental activity, such as defeating enemies,caring for loved ones, business, agriculture, and so on. In the pure context ofbuddhahood it will perfect the fruition in the ground, meaning all forms ofinconceivable activity related to enlightened body, speech, and mind. In theinterim, in the context of practicing on the path this will mature one for thecompletion stage, in which one trains on the path that purifies intentionalefforts to accomplish the twofold benefit spontaneously. At this stage there isan ordinary path that entails a reference point and relies upon physical,verbal, and mental activities, as well as the practice of luminosity, whichinvolves the direct realization of nonreferential wisdom. Through this all thatappears and exists will be purified into bodies of light.If you can penetrate the key points related to the instruction on the fourstakes, you will come to see the deity’s form firsthand and so capture the lifeforce of enlightened body. You will also accomplish true speech, thus capturingthe life force of enlightened speech. You will gain control of the naturalstate, thus capturing the life force of enlightened mind. Your body, speech, andmind will merge in one taste with the enlightened body, speech, and mind of thebliss-gone ones, and so you will attain the life force of all saṃsāra andnirvāṇa. Finally, you will develop the power of wisdom and master the manifoldenlightened activities.Moreover, since the stake of unchanging realization is the view, it is also theground. The stake of deity absorption is the meditation. The stake of theessence mantra is also an aspect of meditation, but implicitly the conduct aswell; together these make up the path. The activity stake of projection andabsorption constitutes the fruition since it brings about the supreme and commonspiritual accomplishments and takes enlightened activity as the path in thepresent. Moreover, we should understand that they are all originally a unity,not different or separate from one another, nor are they alternating stages. Inthe words of Khepa Śrī Gyalpo: > As the great purity and equality of reality itself, this unchanging> realization is the enlightenment of space and wisdom. Its own display is the> union of development and completion, which appears naturally as the relative> maṇḍala of vajra space. Within this state one trains by transforming empty> sounds, the natural sound of mantra, and by manifesting the enlightened> activity of projection and absorption. Great wisdom, the enlightened body,> speech, and mind of the buddhas, is free from deliberate effort and conceptual> complexities. At the same time, it accomplishes the twofold benefit> spontaneously. This fruition, which is here in this very moment, is what is> known as the vajra vehicle of Secret Mantra, the vehicle of fruition.> By realizing the view of the ground—that the circle of wisdom is the equality> of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—one gains mastery over the life force of both existence> and peace. Through the path of meditation, the circle of deity and mantra, one> masters the life force of both development and completion. Finally, by> engaging in the spontaneous accomplishment of the twofold benefit mastery is> gained over the life force of the inconceivable, great skillful means. To give> an example, when Rahula swallows the moon out of the sky, he naturally takes> hold of all its reflections as well. In the same way, just by knowing these> instructions on the four stakes that bind the life force, one will be able to> practice all the inconceivable key points and intents of both sūtra and tantra> simultaneously. > KEY POINTS FOR THE STAKE OF UNCHANGING REALIZATION > There are various key points that relate specifically to each of the four> stakes. First are the eighteen key points that concern the stake of unchanging> realization:> ▶ Knowing the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is the key point that utterly> purifies acceptance and rejection.> ▶ Knowing the emptiness of one taste is the key point that destroys clinging> to reality and attachment to true existence.> ▶ Knowing appearance and emptiness to be a unity is the key point that> perfects the two accumulations simultaneously.> ▶ Embracing the view is the key point that prevents development and completion> from parting.> ▶ Not wavering from the state of realization is the key point of meditation> arriving at the view.> ▶ Being freed from clinging to the sublime deity is the key point that> prevents errors in the development stage.> ▶ Perfecting all that appears and exists as the manifest ground is the key> point that eliminates dualistic fixation on self and other.> ▶ Realizing that primordial liberation is perfected in the ground is the key> point that eliminates the faults of the five poisons.> ▶ Arriving at the realization of the dharma body is the key point that> perfects the three bodies in one’s own state of being.> ▶ Knowing the ground and the fruition to be of one taste is the key point of> not needing to practice or make a conscious effort on the paths and levels.> ▶ Meditation arriving at the fruition is the key point of not searching for> enlightenment elsewhere.> ▶ Fruition arriving at the ground is the key point that liberates fixation and> attachment to the idea that there is something to attain.> ▶ Oneness in the expanse of reality is the key point that purifies clinging to> the samaya being and wisdom being.> ▶ Realizing the sovereign lord of the one hundred families is the key point of> practicing one deity and accomplishing them all.> ▶ Achieving the supreme accomplishment is the key point that spontaneously> accomplishes the twofold benefit.> ▶ Being beyond good and evil, and acceptance and rejection, is the key point> of not depending on ritual purity or righteous conduct.> ▶ Knowing nonaction to be primordially complete is the key point of not> needing the gradual arrangement of ritual.> ▶ Purifying attachment to philosophical systems is the key point of having> reached the peak of all vehicles. > These are the eighteen major key points.

THE STAGES OF VISUALIZATION The specific explanation of the visualizations has three parts: (1) developingconfidence in the indivisibility of deity and mantra as a way to swiftly attainspiritual accomplishments; (2) a specific explanation of the recitationvisualizations related to the four aspects of approach and accomplishment; and(3) an explanation of recitation technique, combined with the purpose andbenefits of recitation.Developing Confidence in the Indivisibility of Deity and Mantra Generally speaking, recitation mantras essentially consist of vowels andconsonants, the syllables of method and knowledge. Moreover, all of the vowelsand consonants arise from, and have as their essence, the syllable A, theinexpressible source of all expression. The syllable A is unborn and, in theultimate sense, primordially devoid of conceptual constructs such as birth,remaining, and cessation, reference point, or coming and going. For this reason,and because of being a natural equality, it is the dharma body, in the sensethat all phenomena, as nothing but mere labels, are originally enlightened andpossess no intrinsic nature. This is described in The Tantra of the SecretEssence: > A is beyond reference points such as> Empty, not empty, or their middle way.> Everything is just labels, and all buddhas> Abide in the garland of syllables itself. This type of absorption is opened up by means of the inexpressible syllable A,so that the various vowels and consonants that are formed verbally appear. Sincethese expressions are unceasing and by nature originally enlightened, they arethe enjoyment body. The same text declares: > A itself appears in manifold forms,> As KA and the rest of the forty-two letters.> The names of these sounds are all-inclusive> And are themselves surely the perfect complete king. In this way, the unborn and unceasing basic space gives rise to collections ofsyllables of great skillful means that take on amazing and incredibleappearances through various emanations. These, in turn, form the basis of allthe purely relative and conventional names, words, and expressions. Moreover,they constitute the great miraculous display that reveals the countless ways ofDharma, in every way necessary, for those in need of guidance. These syllablesare the sublime speech of the enlightened emanation body. The same text alsomentions: > Incredible! This amazing and wondrous> Miraculous display of the forty-five syllables,> The basis for apprehension of every name and word,> Expressing and revealing all types of great meaning! Ultimately, syllables have no substantial existence but are mentalmanifestations that, from the very moment they arise, have no inherentexistence. The nature of mind is primordially empty and devoid of identity,never wavering from great equality free of constructs. Syllables are, therefore,also beyond the scope of dualistic mind, and remain as the wisdom mind of theenlightened emanation body. As it says in the same text: > The nature of unreal syllables is mind,> Beyond extremes, with no identity or reference point. The syllables never waver from this state, yet their unobstructed display ofinterdependent appearances emerges as the various shapes and forms of symbolicletters that produce words and names. These magical syllable clouds produce acompassionate display that emanates in every possible way, such as seedsyllables for developing deities and physical representations of scripture. Thisis how syllables manifest as the enlightened emanation body, performing aninfinite activity to benefit beings. The tantra continues: > Yet with names and words of color and shape> They create and manifest a manifold display. Finally it explains: > The body, speech, and mind of the wisdom beings,> Who appear throughout the four times and ten directions,> Are complete within the forty-fivefold maṇḍala> Of syllables culminating in KṢA. In other words, the nature of enlightened body, speech, and mind of all buddhasis vajra wisdom.More specifically, the mantras that we recite are effective because they areblessed with four types of establishment. First, they are established by theessence of reality itself since all syllables are primordially established asthe essence of equality and great emptiness. Second, they are established bytheir nature since the nature of each is unfailingly established to appear inits own unique way. Third, they are established through blessings since thebuddhas, who have mastery over all phenomena, have blessed certain mantras—fromone syllable to many—by revealing in them the magical displays of wisdom itself.Finally, they are established with potency, similar to medicine orwish-fulfilling jewels, since mantras have an unfailing and unimpeded power tobring about spiritual accomplishment. For these reasons there is no short-termor ultimate goal unattainable through the power of mantra.It is crucial then to take this confidence in the indivisibility of deity andmantra into the recitation and carry it out with one-pointed devotion. A tantrahighlights this: > The mantra is the form of the yoginī;> The yoginī is the form of the mantra.> Whoever strives for the sublime state,> Do not divide them in two! It also mentions: > If you practice with solid trust,> The sky may disappear, but it is impossible> To fail in the accomplishment of the mantra.> If the knowledge mantras pronounced> By deities and sages are infallible,> How could one fail in practicing> The secret mantras, pronounced free of desire?> They have never failed, and they never will. In short, the wisdom of enlightenment can manifest in any possible way to theminds of beings in need of guidance. Whether a buddha appears in actuality toguide beings as such, or whether he appears as something ordinary to guide themin a mundane way, there is no qualitative difference since they are both thewisdom display of a single buddha. In the present context we are discussing howthe buddha can manifest in the form of a mantra in the perception of ordinarybeings. Furthermore, when the deity appears directly through accomplishment ofthe mantra, it is simply the case that the deity had previously manifested asthe mantra. Then, through the process of practicing, the mantra remanifests asthe deity to bestow spiritual accomplishments to the disciple. So it is ofutmost importance that we develop confidence in the indivisibility of deity,mantra, and our minds.The Four Aspects of Approach and Accomplishment The second part covers two topics: (1) setting a foundation for the recitationand (2) the particular visualizations of projection and absorption.Setting a Foundation for the Recitation Continue to visualize yourself as the samaya being of any particular yidamdeity, applying the three principles of vivid appearance, recollection ofpurity, and stable pride. At your heart visualize the precious domelike cittamade of light. This may be a translucent, maroon-colored octagon, the shape oftwo cymbals pressed together, or else an orb of five-colored light. In itscenter is the wisdom being, sitting on a throne made of the sun and the moon.The wisdom being may be a likeness of yourself as the deity, or else bereft ofornaments and implements. In some cases this is framed in terms of an emanationand the source of the emanation, for instance Amitābha in the heart center ofAvalokiteśvara, or Vārāhī in the center of Yeshe Tsogyal. You should visualizeall of this according to your text.In the wisdom being’s heart center visualize a vajra, or the appropriatesymbolic implement of the buddha family, resting upright. In the center of thisimplement may be a stacked sun and moon, or else only a moon in the case ofpeaceful deities, or a sun in the case of wrathful ones; it is about the size ofa split pea. On this seat is the absorption being, the core awakened life forceof the main deity. It is in the form of a seed syllable, such as HRĪḤ or HŪṂ,depending on the yidam. The syllable is the same color as the deity, shinesbrightly like a candle flame, and stands upright, facing the same direction asthe deity. The mantra garland is arranged around this syllable.In some practice manuals you visualize yourself as the samaya being with theseed syllable and mantra garland in your heart center. However, there are alsomanuals without a wisdom being or symbolic implement. So you should alwaysfollow your particular text.The syllable we visualize can be in the Tibetan script, since the Tibetanlanguage subsists primordially as the essence of vajra speech. The profoundmystery of the buddhas’ wisdom and miraculous display, moreover, connects to allbeings in need of guidance in an equal manner. The difference between Sanskritand Tibetan lies only in the shapes of the letters. Otherwise, there is nodiscernible difference, like one language being holier than the other.Therefore, simply use whichever script most easily comes to mind; there is noneed to convert it to something else.The mantra garland should be arranged so that it begins in front of the seedsyllable, the core awakened life force. The letters of the recitation mantrashould be miniscule, as if drawn with a single fine hair, and shine brightly asthey rotate around the seed syllable. The other details should be sought in yourspecific text. Mantra garlands that spin clockwise should be facing outwards, sothat they are readable from the outside, with the syllables upright and arrangedin a counterclockwise sequence. As the mantra spins in a chain, the leadingsyllable, such as OṂ, will therefore be next to the final syllable, for instanceHŪṂ or HRĪḤ. Long mantras should begin with the first syllable in front andfacing inward, and then coil two or three times around like a snake, so that thefinal syllable is at the outside, directly in front of the first. When recitingwith this type of visualization, it should rotate clockwise so it is readablefrom left to right.Mantra garlands that spin counterclockwise should also stand upright and startin front of the awakened life force, but run clockwise and face inward, and thusbe readable from the inside. If a mantra is long, it should coil from the insideout as described just above. These mantras should then spin counterclockwiseduring the recitation. Generally speaking, for male deities the mantra garlandspins clockwise, while for female deities it spins counterclockwise, but thisdistinction cannot be made categorically; you must look to your own text.For mantra garlands that do not actually spin, but project and absorb lightwhile they remain stationary, the direction the letters face is the opposite ofabove. For these, the central factor is whether they are arranged with theletters running clockwise or counterclockwise. This should be taken case bycase.The Visualizations of Projection and Absorption ApproachThe first style of visualization is the arranged recitation, which is the aspectof approach, and is likened to a moon with a garland of stars. In this style yourepeatedly bring your attention back to the seed syllable, the mantra garland,and the projection and absorption of light. Eventually all of the deities beginto let the mantra resound in their voices, and the syllables of the mantra, eachmaking its own particular sound, rise slightly above the disc. At first it ismerely the light from the syllables that is revolving. Then the mantra garlanditself begins to revolve increasingly faster, and eventually projects light. Asthis light saturates your body, think that it clears away all illness, demonicinfluence, negativity, and obscurations, including even their latent tendencies.Close ApproachThe second style is the palanquin recitation, the aspect of close approach,which is likened to a spinning firebrand. In this style a second mantra garlandemanates out of the mantra in the heart center. One syllable follows theprevious without touching it in an uninterrupted chain, resounding with themantra’s sound. Like a spinning firebrand, the mantra chain emerges from themouth of the wisdom being and then the samaya being before entering the mouth ofthe female consort. Stimulating her wisdom mind, it courses through her body andemerges from her lotus, from which it enters the male consort followed by thewisdom being through their vajras. Traveling upward, it produces an exhilaratingrapture, the great bliss of the mind of awakening. Finally, imagine that itdissolves back into the seed syllable in the heart center, at which point youattain supreme spiritual accomplishment. This process stabilizes the subtleessences, creates an experience of clarity, and makes the downward-clearingenergy pass into the central channel.If done for too long, however, it can create an obstacle by transferring energyto the upper part of the body. To prevent this from happening, visualize themantra garland traveling the other way from the male consort’s vajra into thefemale’s lotus, then out of the female’s mouth and into the male’s, before itdissolves into the seed syllable in his heart center. Just as before, visualizethe mantra garland then reemerging and proceeding to revolve uninterruptedly.This is called the “palanquin,” or “sedan,” recitation. It creates an experienceof nonthought, leads the life energy into the central channel, and prevents anyobstacles deriving from energy moving into the upper body. If performed for toolong, there is a risk that the subtle essence might weaken and the clarity ofthe visualization might fade. So it is ideal to practice these two inalternation, visualizing the mantra as it revolves toward you in the morning anddusk sessions, and away from you in the midday and afternoon sessions. Both ofthese are called the “spinning style” recitation.This style can also be applied when there is a frontal visualization as well.Simply project and absorb the mantra garland back and forth between you and thefrontal visualization.AccomplishmentThird is the recitation of projection and absorption, the aspect ofaccomplishment, which is likened to a king’s emissaries. By reciting the mantra,light rays of the five colors stream out of the awakened life force and mantragarland, filling all of space. Innumerable goddesses bearing offerings thenemanate from the tips of the light rays, making countless gifts to delight thevictorious ones throughout space, along with their offspring. The deities areoverjoyed and in a state of stainless bliss; all of the spiritualaccomplishments and the blessings of enlightened body, speech, and mind showerdown like rain. These take the form of white, red, and blue light, or elsebodily forms for enlightened body, seed syllables for enlightened speech, andsymbolic implements for enlightened mind, which dissolve into your body, speech,and mind. As they do so, think that the two obscurations, as well as theirhabits, are purified; the two accumulations in their entirety are completed; andthe four empowerments are attained all at once. This is the visualization ofgathering the blessings for one’s own benefit.Then light rays stream out again, striking the sentient beings of the sixclasses and three realms, and instantly purifying them of all their karma,negativity, disturbing emotions, and their particular forms of suffering.Imagine as well that the listeners, self-realized buddhas, and bodhisattvas arefreed from their cognitive obscurations, and that all beings’ body, speech, andmind are transformed into the three vajras. This is the recitation ofenlightened activity for the benefit of others. In this context you should alsoknow how to perform the visualizations for any of the four activities that youwish to carry out.Great AccomplishmentThe aspect of great accomplishment is likened to a beehive that has burst open.In this style imagine that light rays project from the deity and the mantra,transforming the universe into a celestial palace, its inhabitants into thecircle of deities, all sounds into the nature of mantra, and all thoughts intothe play of wisdom. This is the recitation of the nonduality of self and other,which should be carried out in a state of nonfixation.There are different ways to apply these four styles of recitation, such as insequence or by focusing on one of them in particular, so it is important to seehow they are presented in your particular text.The Tradition of Oral InstructionThe fifth style is according to the special tradition of oral instructions,which is sufficient, in itself, for both approach and accomplishment. In thisstyle, as you visualize yourself as the yidam deity before you begin therecitation, imagine that above you sits Guru Padmasambhava wearing the attire ofVajradhara, surrounded by multitudes of masters of the instruction lineage.Imagine that your sincere devotion rouses his wisdom mind, so that white, red,and blue light emerges from the three places of his body, forming a nectar thatflows into you through the crown of your head. As it then saturates your bodyand purifies your obscurations, think that all the blessings of his wisdom mindpenetrate you, so that you attain the spiritual power to swiftly accomplishevery deity and mantra. With this in mind, chant one hundred or so of the VAJRAGURU mantra, and then dissolve the guru into yourself. Afterwards, carry out theconsecrations of speech and of the rosary, etc.Once this is done, continue to visualize yourself as the deity and imagine thata recitation mansion, complete in both supporting and supported aspects, emergesfrom your heart center into the space in front of you. The seed syllable andmantra garland in your heart center then emit light rays and mantra garlandsthat revolve between you like a spinning firebrand. Now the tip of your tongueprojects a great mass of light that gathers in the sky, presenting sublimeSamantabhadra offering clouds of great bliss to the conquerors and bodhisattvasthroughout space, who appear to be pleased and satisfied. This causes them tomanifest out of the dharma body and become active, throughout space, as formbodies appearing like the maṇḍala of deities you are practicing. They then enterthe deities in the recitation mansion like a mass of falling sesame seeds andmerge inseparably with them. The deities then emit light rays of enlightenedbody, speech, and mind that dissolve into you.Next, the mantra syllables in the sky before you emanate innumerable light rays.The light pleases the multitudes of root and lineage knowledge holder masters,arouses the bodhisattvas out of their equanimity to benefit beings, and inspirescourage in the mother ḍākinīs. It also incites the oath-bound Dharma protectorsinto action, rouses the listeners and self-realized buddhas from their state ofcessation, subdues the haughty mundane spirits, and menaces the demonic andextremist adversaries. It overpowers the misconceptions of all beings in thethree realms and annihilates malicious enemies and obstructors. Finally, thelight dispels the obscurations of all beings, in every time and place,completely fulfilling their temporary and ultimate wishes, and establishing themall at the level of the yidam deity.Then, one last time, light streams out, transforming the outer universe, all atonce, into a celestial palace, the inhabitants within it into male and femaledeities, and perfecting it all—the entirety of appearance and existence—into themaṇḍala of the deity you are practicing. The natural sound of the secret mantrayou are chanting then resounds in the voices of all the deities, and fromspinning mantra garlands everywhere throughout space. The sound, which resoundsthroughout the universe, is as loud as a thousand lightning bolts thundering atonce, a hundred thousand giant mountains collapsing, or a meteor strike.The light that radiates and swells from the mantras corresponds in color to thatof the main deity. Alternatively, the light may be of multiple colors, in whichcase it is dark blue in the center, maroon in the east, deep yellow in thesouth, dark red in the west, and dark green in the north. With all this in mind,carry out the recitation in a state of one-pointed concentration.This description applies when the central deity is wrathful. For peacefuldeities the basic framework is the same, while the light should be soft, andthere should be an arousal of bliss. Moreover, you should chant the mantra witha melodious tune, as beautiful as the voice of Brahmā. Throughout all of theabove recitation visualizations you should understand how they unfold within thesingle taste of great wisdom and bring all of appearance and existence under thesway of natural awareness. Doing so, you can use them as a way to attain all theblessings and spiritual accomplishments one can wish for.When breaking from a session, imagine that the seed syllables and light rays inthe sky—along with all of appearance and existence manifested as the divinemaṇḍala—dissolve into the recitation mansion. The deities in the recitationmansion then dissolve into you, so that your physical radiance and splendorincrease exponentially, and your body becomes entirely filled with miniatureforms of the deity you are practicing. This can be applied to the recitations ofeach of the principal and retinue deities. As per usual, to make up for mistakesin the mantra recitation and to stabilize its effectiveness, at the end of thesession chant the vowels and consonants, the “Essence of Dependent Origination,”and the hundred syllables three times each.This condensation of the oral instructions of the knowledge holders in thelineage of the Early Translations is the heart-extract of the omniscient JampelGyepa. There are many other common and unique details, including the general andspecific points for practicing the three roots, as well as the visualizationsfor pacifying, increasing, magnetizing, wrathful activity, protection, exorcism,and slaying. You should learn these from the primary recitation manuals andreceive thorough instruction on them from your teacher. If you then practicethem in secrecy, you will reach the pinnacle of the two spiritualaccomplishments.The Technique, Purpose, and Benefits of Mantra Recitation Recitation Technique Generally speaking, there are many different ways to recite mantras. You can dovocal recitation and chant loudly and clearly, or chant softly, using the lips,tip of the tongue, and vocal cords only slightly. There is silent recitation, inwhich you hold your breath while focusing your attention on the form and soundof the mantra. Then there is also a technique called mental recitation, in whichyou do not hold your breath, but simply keep in mind the form or the sound ofthe mantra. There is also another style called vajra recitation. In vajrarecitation you make the sound HŪṂ as you breathe out from the nāda of the seedsyllable, while projecting light rays or bodily forms to accomplish the twofoldbenefit. You reabsorb these as you breathe in while making the sound OṂ, anddissolve them into the nāda as you make the sound AḤ while holding the breath.Here, however, we will only concern ourselves with vocal recitation.You should learn about the requirements for a qualified rosary for counting, theway to consecrate it, and the manner of counting with the rosary for differentactivities from other general manuals. I will not go into them here for fear ofbeing long-winded. In terms of the main points of recitation technique, theGreat Master of Uḍḍiyāna has said, > Recite with undistracted concentration.> Should you become distracted elsewhere,> Even reciting for an eon will bring no result. In other words, if you recite while distracted, no matter how much you chant, itwill not lead to any great spiritual accomplishments but merely lessen yourverbal obscurations a bit. It is therefore vital to chant in one-pointedconcentration with your attention focused on the vivid appearance of the deityand the projection and absorption of light rays from the mantra garland, withoutstraying onto other things.If you know such details, you should also be sure to utter the sounds from thecorrect place of articulation, with proper aspiration and pronunciation.Moreover, you should avoid certain faults, such as chanting the individualsyllables too fast or overly slow. You should not shorten the long syllables orelongate the short ones, and be sure not to add excess syllables or leave any ofthe actual syllables out. Also, do not recite too loudly or quietly. When youare in session you should not interrupt the recitation by yawning, spitting, orengaging in excess conversation. The Awesome Flash of Lightning mentions thesethings: > Not too loud and not too quiet,> Not too fast and not too slow,> Not too rough and not too weak,> Enunciate the syllables in their entirety.> There should be no distraction or idle talk,> Nor interruptions by yawning and the like. In addition, if you know the meaning connected to the mantra, you can accomplishthe dhāraṇī of meaning and other such aims. This is described in a tantra: > For the expert with no doubt of the meaning> The spiritual accomplishments are near. Nonetheless, even without knowing the associated meaning, you can recite withone-pointed faith and sincerity, and still the great spiritual accomplishmentswill emerge just as they ought to. It continues: > But the accomplishments linked to that meaning> Are still close to the fool who has faith. This point can be seen in the old story about the adepts Darchar and SakyaPaṇḍita converting Harinanda.There is a reason why mantras in Sanskrit are not translated into Tibetan, thosein Tibetan mixed with Sanskrit are not translated completely into Sanskrit, andthose in the symbolic language of the ḍākinīs or other foreign languages are notrecreated or translated for the sake of communication. The rationale is that, inleaving them as they are, we do not alter the actualization of the true speechuttered by the ones who first articulated them. In fact, it is said thatanalyzing the practices of Secret Mantra only distances you from spiritualaccomplishment. As it is explained: > Spiritual accomplishment is extremely far> From the intellectual with his logic and scrutiny. Furthermore, > No accomplishment will occur if you scrutinize> The applications of sacred substance and mantra.> Though accomplishment may be otherwise near,> When you entertain reservations,> Waver in resolve, or slip in your faith,> You will undoubtedly regress. Therefore, it is crucial to recite with one-pointed faith and sincerity.Most mantras we recite involve an invocation of the deity through utterance ofits name. For instance, if we translate the six-syllable mantra, we are callingout to Avalokiteśvara by name: “O Jewel Lotus!” Or in the SIDDHI mantra we areinvoking Guru Rinpoche’s heart commitment: “Vajra Master Padma, please conferspiritual accomplishment!” In truth, distinctions like invoking or not invoking,hearing or not hearing, and near and far do not apply to wisdom deities.Nonetheless, by reciting wisdom-knowledge mantras—which are the enlightenedspeech of all buddhas, and the nature of the dharma body—we gradually depleteour obscurations and come ever closer to realizing the deity of the fruition. Indoing so, we naturally suffuse ourselves with the wisdom deity’s blessings.Gauging the Recitation As briefly mentioned above, the best gauge of recitation is achievement of thesigns of accomplishing the deity, whether in actuality, in a vision, or in adream. This is called indicative recitation. Second best is temporal recitation,where you recite for the length of time recommended in your particular text, forinstance half a year. Otherwise, the third option is numeric recitation, inwhich you chant the mantra of the primary deity in the maṇḍala one hundredthousand times for each of its syllables. Then you would chant the mantras ofthe other maṇḍala deities each a tenth of the number of the main mantra. On topof this, you chant an amending number of ten percent of each mantra, meaning foreach hundred thousand mantras you chant, you add 11,111. In certain otherexplanations, you chant one hundred thousand per syllable if the mantra isfifteen syllables or less, and ten thousand per syllable if it is thirtysyllables or more.The main presentation above is the way of counting in the age of perfection. Itis sometimes taught that this should be doubled in the age of three-quartersperfection, tripled in the age of half perfection, and quadrupled in the age ofstrife. Essentially though, the important thing is that we practice in accordwith our personal levels of insight and concentration.When doing recitation practice, moreover, it is said that you should insert the“one thousand verse,” an offering and praise made after each thousand mantras.Nonetheless, if you fail to do that, you can instead make the offering andpraise after you complete the recitation. At that point you would also chant thevowels and consonants, the hundred-syllable mantra, and the “Essence ofDependent Origination” in order to mend any broken commitments of body, speech,and mind. This also amends for recitation mistakes, such as mantras chanted inexcess or left out, and stabilizes the effectiveness of your practice. Youshould also receive the spiritual accomplishments and so on as laid out in yourtext. Beyond this, you should become familiar with all the activities duringsession breaks, including proper retreat behavior, from the writings of thegreat saints of the past where they are described in detail. In particular, youshould study the lord guru’s Great General Guide to Recitation and other similartexts. It is important that we put these details into practice.There is immeasurable value and benefit to focusing in practice on one-pointedvisualization of the deity and correctly carrying out the recitation—whethernumeric, temporal, or indicative. In this life alone you will pacify obstaclesand obstructions, acquire powerful verbal abilities, please the deity andreceive its blessing in your mind-stream, complete the two accumulations andthereby have your wishes fulfilled, create an extraordinary link between ground,path, and fruition, and mature your stream of being. In every lifetime hereafteryou will be under the care of the sublime deity. Ultimately, you will becomefully enlightened within the expanse of the lord of the family’s wisdom mind. Inthe short-term, moreover, you will gain mastery over measureless and remarkableactivity and spiritual accomplishment, and master the maṇḍala activities in therole of vajra master.SUBSEQUENT RITUALS The additional explanation regarding the concluding activities covers fourtopics: (1) the gathering offering, (2) sustaining the torma, (3) receiving thespiritual accomplishments, and (4) apologizing for mistakes.The Gathering Offering The “gathering circle” refers to indivisible method and knowledge, and takes theform of a special ceremony. The term derives from gaṇacakra, literally meaning acircle composed of offerings that form a gathering of great bliss used to cutthrough the web of disturbing emotions. It consists of several different types.There is the gathering of worthy people, which is to say, the gathering ofmethod and knowledge in union. Then there is the gathering of plentiful things,which means bringing all the sacred substances of inner Secret Mantra together.Third, there is the gathering of delighted deities, referring to thevisualization and invitation of the maṇḍala deities. Finally, when we bringthese three gatherings together and revel in them, we attain the gathering ofmerit and wisdom.Performing a Gathering Offering In this day and age people who can practice the gathering circle in its true andliteral sense are quite rare. So we will instead look at how to bring together asincerely emulated gathering based on a wisdom consort, the way tantric devoteescommonly practice these days.The first step is to prepare the arrangement of articles. Place whateveroffering items you have in front of the maṇḍala. This should be according tocommon procedure and include the outer, inner, and secret feast offerings aswell as food and drinks that are suitable as samaya substances. Next, theyshould be consecrated. For that, sprinkle nectar on the articles and then giverise to the pride of being the primary deity. With this confidence, imagine thatthe syllables RAṂ, YAṂ, and KHAṂ project from your heart center. They transformrespectively into wisdom fire, wind, and water, which burn, scatter, and washaway all clinging to impure reality. In this way everything is purified intoemptiness. Now imagine that a syllable BHRŪṂ manifests from the state ofemptiness and becomes a radiant feast bowl, made either out of jewels or anaturally manifest skull cup. Inside the feast bowl the contents, such as thethree syllables, all melt into light to form an elixir. This elixir is theessence of awakened mind and the nature of the five meats, five nectars, andfive wisdoms. It manifests, however, as anything that could possibly be desired.Imagining that, increase it to the reaches of space.Next comes the gathering and invitation. Visualize yourself as the central deitywith consort and imagine that your heart center—or else your place ofunion—projects countless light rays to the Unexcelled Realm and the infinitenatural emanation body realms. The light makes these realms burst open likesesame pods as the multitudes of masters and maṇḍalas of the three root deitiesawaken and manifest in actuality, spreading through and filling up the entireexpanse of space.Then, for the actual gathering offering, there are three parts; the firstinvolves the offering substances. In this, you take the prime, first portion ofthe feast. Imagine that it is essentially the nectar of stainless wisdom yetappears in the form of goddesses of the six sense pleasures along with aninexhaustible quantity of every possible delightful thing. Make the offering asyou imagine this filling all of space.Second is the offering of apology. For this you take the second, middle, portionof the feast and visualize it as the five nectars. As you offer it, think thatthe deities are pleased and your bond with them is mended. It also causes you tobe purified of concepts, obscurations, damaged and broken vows, and blessed bygreat wisdom. At this point, you should also chant the hundred-syllable mantraand so on.The third and final part is the offering of liberation. For this you should setaside an effigy, if you have one, or a triangle, before consecrating theofferings. Now place it in front of the offerings and imagine that the goddessesof the sense pleasures are reabsorbed back into you in the form of the syllableHŪṂ. Use the effigy as a support for your visualization. Then visualize yourselfas the deity and imagine that innumerable light rays and magical emissariesstream out of your heart center. They summon the objects to be liberated, thosewho meet the ten conditions. These ten conditions are described in the tantras: > Those who destroy the Buddha’s teachings,> Bring down the prestige of the Three Jewels,> Prevent the saṅgha from assembling,> Denigrate the Great Vehicle teachings,> Inflict physical harm on the teacher,> Sow discord among the vajra relatives,> Create obstacles for spiritual practice,> Those who transgress their commitments,> Who are compassionless monsters,> Who lead people to wrong, extremist beliefs,> And who inflict harm on practitioners:> These are the “ten objects of liberation.” A Clarification of Commitments presents in this way: > Enemies of the Three Jewels, opponents of the master,> Violators, breakers, and transgressors of commitments,> Those who arrive at the assembly, who are harmful to all,> Those hostile to the commitments, wicked beings,> And those in the three lower realms:> These ten the practitioner should take on. These are all summoned helplessly before you. You seize them by the heart with ahook, pull them by the neck with a lasso, bind their limbs with a chain, stunthem with a bell, and then dissolve them into the physical support. Imagine thatthey remain there incapacitated and without any divine savior.Then unify boundless great compassion—which is the ultimate state of mind,emptiness suffused with compassion—and magical illusory concentration. As you doso, let your empty mind manifest in the form of vajra wrath whereby you are theGreat Glorious One. The dagger in your hand is the Supreme Son Kīlaya, and theeffigy is the embodiment of everything harmful. With these three in mind, stabthe dagger to the heart of the effigy. In doing this, you gather all its life,wealth, glory, brilliance, and splendor into a syllable A. Imagine that thissyllable dissolves into you, where it becomes the mind of awakening, inseparablefrom your own vajra life force. This constitutes the transmission of life.Next, visualize the effigy’s all-ground consciousness in the form of NRI andlift it with the tip of your dagger, where you visualize a HŪṂ. It coursesthrough the dagger’s interior before you propel it with PHAṬ. This purifies theconsciousness of its temporary stains, so that it turns into a subtle spherethat travels to the Unexcelled Realm. There it finally dissolves into the heartcenter of the Great Glorious One, or whichever is the central deity, therebybeing empowered as its son. This constitutes the transmission of purification.In this way you can employ the transmissions of life, purification, andelevation to liberate the supported consciousness into basic space.Next you grab the support composed of the habitual aggregates—by the right legif it is male, or by the left leg if female—and proceed to chop it up. As youwork on this, consider the effigy to be, in essence, the three poisons,appearing as a mass of flesh, blood, and bones. Then offer it up as a meal tothe primary deity, along with its attendants and emanations. Think that youroffering empties the three realms of cyclic existence.In this way the triple satisfaction is fulfilled. You benefit, as you aresatisfied with the nourishment of the enemy’s life-span and merit, which havebecome your own. The enemy benefits, as he is satisfied in becoming the son ofthe Great Glorious One and his continuous stream of bad actions and theirripened effects have been cut. Also, the deities benefit, as the large retinueof attendants and guardians is satisfied in partaking of the flesh and blood ofthe corpse. Please look to other texts, such as my commentaries on Vajrakīlayaand on Viśuddha and Kīlaya combined, for the extensive version of this.After this it is time to enjoy the gathering offering. First, the vajra helpershould make prostrations to the chief of the gathering and offer him thesymbolic offering of the substances of method and knowledge. The master thensymbolically accepts these. Next, the vajra helper distributes the feast to theother participants, in order of seniority. Avoid quarreling, chattering, andclinging to ordinary reality within the gathering. Instead, feel satisfied anddelighted, yet remain without conceptual grasping as you enjoy the feast.Imagine that the feast is an offering of nectar that is refined into a pureessential extract by the fire of inner heat at your navel, and then offered tothe maṇḍala of deities within your body. In this way enjoy the feast as a typeof “inner burning and pouring.” In addition, make the secret gathering offeringbased solely on the wisdom consort. Finally, bring to mind the offering ofsuchness, great bliss free of concepts of the three spheres, in which subjectand object are unified as natural awareness, while emptiness and saṃsāra andnirvāṇa are primordially present as the maṇḍala. With the permission of thevajra master or vajra helper you may also perform vajra song and dance whileinspired by your practice.Afterward, collect the residuals without saving or hoarding anything. Thisconstitutes the “impure torma,” to which you add the “morsel offering,” and topoff with part of the three prime portions. Next, the vajra helper makes aninvocation and the vajra master subsequently spits wine onto the offerings whilesaying mantras and making gestures. During this ritual the vajra master’s tongueis visualized as Hayagrīva, sporting with his consort, until a stream of thenectar of awakened mind pours down. This transforms the offerings into nectarand increases them. The offerings are then placed either to the northeast or thesoutheast of the shrine, on a human hide or something of the sort. You thensummon the “residual guests” with mantras and gestures, and offer them thingslike flowers. In accord with the oath they took in the past in the presence ofthe Great Glorious One, command them to partake of the great, stainless,delightful, and sacred substance that is the residual torma and to carry out theactivities that practitioners enjoin them to. Next, carry the residuals to aspot that is seventy paces away from the practice place, which is called the“feeding path of demons.” Finally, make aspirations and do whatever otherrituals your text lays out.Sustaining the Torma The second of the subsequent rituals is the sustaining of the torma. For this,first invoke the assembly of maṇḍala deities to manifest out of basic space byreminding them of their sacred commitment. Then remove the protector torma fromthe row of tormas and sprinkle it with medicine and rakta. Next, consider theessence of the torma to be the flesh, blood, and bones of the enemies andobstructors. Transform it mentally into the form of stainless wisdom nectar andincrease it. Now imagine that nonarising basic space gives rise to self-manifestoath-bound protectors of the three tantras who appear with their entourage ofnumerous haughty spirits. Remind them of their strict past oath and then offerthe torma to them. You should do so outside while commanding them to carry outthe four types of enlightened activity unimpededly. At this time, if you wish tothrow a curse, you should visualize the torma as being made of disease, weapons,and poison, and imagine it being projected in the direction of the hateful,destructive enemies, who are annihilated beyond a trace.Subsequently, sprinkle the torma for the earth goddesses with the selectmedicine used to rinse the torma vessel, and consecrate it with the three seedsyllables. This torma is offered to the twelve primary protectresses of Tibetand Kham. On an inner level, they are the very embodiments of the twelve linksof dependent origination being naturally purified, while externally they have asteadfast presence. Offer the torma to them along with theirhundred-thousandfold entourage of menmo goddesses, and enjoin them to carry outthe activity that ensures the welfare of the Snowy Land, from its interior toits borders.After this, perform the horse dance. Suppress the object of your focus below thetorma vessel, which you turn upside down and visualize as the central mountain.Seal it with the vajra, and then carry out the dance activity. While imaginingthat the entire universe with its inhabitants consists of multitudes of male andfemale wrathful deities corresponding to the particular activity, for instanceNoble Supreme Steed Heruka, perform the dance in the nonduality of method andknowledge. Imagine that through this the particular activity—whether pacifying,increasing, magnetizing, or wrathful—is accomplished in the short term, and thatultimately all concepts dissolve into basic space beyond reference point, wherethey manifest as enlightened bodies and wisdoms and the music of great bliss.Receiving the Accomplishments Next among the subsequent rituals is receiving the spiritual accomplishments,which is usually done after one has completed the practice of approach andaccomplishment. I hesitate to say much here about the extensive way to receivethe accomplishments, which is better learned from the specific recitation manualof the maṇḍala you are practicing. So here I will just give a rough overview ofwhat happens at the very end of your activity text.When you reach the conclusion, visualize the accomplishment torma as the deity,and then supplicate it with devotion and invoke its resolve. As you do so, themain places of the principal deities send out blessings of enlightened body,speech, and mind, as well as all spiritual accomplishments, which take the formof the three syllables and light rays. Imagine that these dissolve into yourthree places, purifying your obscurations of body, speech, and mind, andgranting you every blessing and spiritual accomplishment. Then touch theaccomplishment torma to your three places, or else taste the inner offering ofnectar and place a drop of it on each of your three places. Afterward, restevenly in innate equal taste.Apologizing for Mistakes Next you should make the offering and praise of thanksgiving. When completingthem, you should address the maṇḍala deities in the following way, withheartfelt earnestness: > I am completely deficient as a practitioner, lacking any insight and> concentration, and therefore have not gained confidence in your oceanlike> realization and conduct. I have fallen prey to dullness and agitation. My> concentration has been hazy, my recitation sloppy, and I have left out> elements of the ritual. I have not assembled all the sacred articles and> substances, and I let those I have assembled become polluted. In these and> many other ways I have transgressed many general and specific root and> subsidiary commitments. In the presence of all of you, oceanlike gathering of> gurus, hosts of maṇḍala deities, and my spiritual brothers and sisters, I> admit and confess to any and all faults I have committed. Please cleanse and> purify them so they do not turn into temporary or lasting obscurations. With this in mind, chant a specific apology or else the generic hundred-syllablemantra of Vajrasattva. Afterward, either dissolve the wisdom being or request itto depart, whichever is appropriate, and then dissolve the samaya being.Alternatively, according to the unique and special approach of unexcelledmantra, you do not request the wisdom being to depart but rather dissolve thesamaya and wisdom beings indivisibly.ENLIGHTENED MIND The practice of enlightened mind corresponds to its object of purification,which is the process in which a child, after growing old, dies and thenreemerges. You now dissolve the world and its beings into the protection circleand then gradually into the tip of the seed syllable, which symbolizes the outerand inner stages of dissolution that occur at the moment of death, as well asthe luminosity of the dharma body in the death state. Afterward, in the breaksbetween sessions, you arise from this state as the deity, which parallels theexistence of the intermediate state.The steps in the process of purification are as follows. First, train as much aspossible in the practices of deity and mantra as explained above. Then, when youare no longer able to continue the practice, perform the dissolution stage. Itis said that if you did not cling to thoughts of a sublime deity during thepreceding development stage, you can perform the dissolution stage all at once:simply let the entire maṇḍala of support and supported vanish instantaneouslylike a rainbow fading into the sky. Then rest evenly within the great andsupreme dharma body of the indivisible two truths, holding nothing in mind.If the case is otherwise, however, you will have to subsequently dismantle themaṇḍala. In that case, first imagine that light from your heart center causesthe entire pure external universe and its inhabitants to dissolve into light,which merges with the protection circle. Next, the inner layered elementsgradually dissolve into the protection circle, which in turn dissolves into thecharnel grounds. These dissolve into the celestial palace, the palace into theretinue, and the retinue into the primary male and female consorts, who dissolveinto the wisdom being in the center of the heart. The wisdom being dissolvesinto the absorption being, the seed syllable of the awakened life force, whichitself dissolves gradually upward until reaching the tip of the syllable. Afterthat fades away, rest evenly in the expanse of original purity, free ofconstructs, thoughts, and reference points. This eliminates the extreme ofeternalism.Afterward, utter the mantra by which you reappear in the form of the main deity,like a fish leaping out of the water. Bless the three places of your body, don“the armor for physical protection” and so on, and proceed to bring allexperiences and activities onto the path as the play of the enlightened bodiesand wisdoms. This eliminates the extreme of nihilism. Strive then to make yourdaily activities a continuous stream of practice.Here the result of purification is the manifestation of the form bodies ofbuddhahood, which constitutes the enlightened activity of the dharma body. Sincethe wisdom of the dharma body is also the essence of basic space, the formbodies dissolve back into it. Generally speaking, the wisdom of the dharma bodyis characterized by unconditioned simplicity, so, of course, it is essentiallybeyond any notion of something to dissolve or a process of dissolution. Still,the term “dissolve” is applied because of something seemingly disappearing inthe perception of others, those in need of guidance. The reemergence illustratesthe continuous reappearance of the form bodies in accord with the particularpropensities of the beings in need of guidance. In addition, this matures youfor the higher path, as it creates a foundation for the ability to reemerge inthe unified illusory body after having established the universe and itsinhabitants in luminosity during the practice of the fourth empowerment.Though the explanations up to this point have clearly emphasized the developmentstage, in fact they have been suffused with the genuine oral instructions of theprecious Early Translation lineage. In this way they present a path of unifieddevelopment and completion, as I have pointed out above. The crux of the matteris that all conceptual phenomena that appear internally or externally, includingthe aggregates, elements, and sense sources, are primordially the great divinecircle of all-encompassing purity, the three seats of completeness. It is notthat they become this way, or are newly crafted as such through the path ofpurifying obstacles and discards. The Tantra of the All-Creating King proclaims: > Hark!> This manifestation of the all-creating king, guide among guides—> The essential maṇḍala of enlightened forms—> Is the manifestation of all things as they appear and exist> Within nonarising true reality.> Everything, however it may exist or be called,> Manifesting in language within nonarising basic space,> Consists of essential, inexpressible speech,> Which itself is manifested by the all-creating king. There is also a song that says: > There are no buddhas or sentient beings> Outside of the jewel of this mind. In this way, all conceptual phenomena are pure as the deities, whose bodies areforms of the wisdom of equality. Here “wisdom” means the naturally presentwisdom of the nature of mind, which does not divide into concepts of subject andobject and is originally and utterly pure as the essence of the vajra mind ofall buddhas. Once we resolve our view in a way that is in tune with the truestate of things, we can meditate and gain experience. In this way, the illusorynonexistent appearances of saṃsāric phenomena, on one hand, as well as ourclinging to them, on the other hand, are all naturally purified. Thereafter, allappearances become a manifestation of great wisdom with a nature of bliss,clarity, and emptiness. At that point we can resolve that all outer and innerconceptual phenomena are an expression of our own minds, while the nature ofmind is primordially the form of the deity. When that happens, there is no deityapart from our own mind, no mind apart from the deity, as mind and the deity’sform are a unity. All experiences and activities are sealed by illusory emptylucidness free of fixation.Everything that appears physically is the illusory form of the deity, appearingwhile lacking true existence, lucid while free of thought, blissful while freeof clinging, the embodiment of the indivisible essence of dharma body,appearance of enjoyment body, and activity of emanation body. As we then trainin this type of pure perception and take it as our path, all appearances becomenatural appearance, and all of emptiness, natural emptiness, while the union ofappearance and emptiness manifests in divine forms as the circle ofall-encompassing purity.Similarly, all internal and external sounds—whether pleasant or unpleasant, madeby animate or inanimate things, including verbal expression and breathing—areprimordially nonarising empty sounds, the invincible enlightened speech of theconquerors, the great melodious resounding. There is no sound, speech, orutterance apart from mantra, no mantra other than sound, speech, and utterance.When we seal all sound, speech, and utterance in the animate and inanimate worldwith the vajra recitation of nonarising empty sound, breath and mantraindivisibly united, they become unbound as the inconceivable mystery ofenlightened speech: echolike, invincible, empty resounding.Moreover, when we release all the good and bad thoughts that occur to our mindsinto innate naturalness, they remain as the primordial essence of the vajra mindof the conquerors. Therefore, in the expanse of mind nature’s nondual equality,great bliss free of constructs, discard and remedy are of a single taste. Thisis the basic state of things as it is. This state naturally expresses itselfthrough an unceasing display of diverse manifestations: such is the way thingsappear in their extent. The way things are and the way they appear areessentially a unity. They are an inseparable equality as the identity ofinexpressible and innate wisdom. This is also the nonconceptual wisdom mind ofthe buddhas. Thus, there is no buddha mind apart from this naturally lucidnature of mind, and no mind of innate lucidness other than the buddha mind.In the expanse of the great perfection free of concepts—the equal taste of mindand appearances—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are of equal taste, and the phrase “groundof delusion” has never even been heard of. When we cross decisively into thisgreat primordial purity, all thoughts and appearances manifest as great wisdom.Therefore, this, in fact, subsumes all the key points of the completion stage ofvajra mind, and is itself the crucial point of the special path of the greatperfection.At the outset we must distinguish conceptual mind from awareness. First,recognize the nature of mind directly. This means to realize that your presentawareness itself—free of thought and concept, uncontrived, and unspoiled—isnaturally present wakefulness, the wisdom mind of the primordially pure dharmabody. Then decide on one thing, which means to sustain the continuity of yourpresent fresh awareness—the fourth part without the three—in which thoughts ofthe past and future are absent. Finally, gain confidence in liberation, in whichthoughts are naturally and tracelessly freed as soon as they arise—like wavesdissolving back into the ocean—and sensations subside into the basic ground. Allof these profound points about the view, meditation, conduct, and fruition needto be learned, in detail, from a teacher.While training in this way, it is vital that we practice, throughout allsessions and breaks, by means of the tenfold understanding of mantra, andsupported by the six commitments. The knowledge holder Jigme Lingpa has outlinedthe tenfold understanding as follows: > (1) All sādhanas are like an illusion; (2) all names and words have no> substance, like a mirage that deceives a wild animal; (3) all activities are> like a dream; (4) all things lack any true nature, like the reflection in a> mirror; (5) all lands and places are like a city of spirits; (6) all sounds> are like an echo; (7) all divine forms are like the reflection of the moon in> water—they appear but have no true existence; (8) the various meditative> absorptions are like bubbles surfacing on a lake; (9) the entire range of> projections and absorptions is manifold, like optical illusions; and (10) all> miraculous displays appear in various ways but have no characteristics of> their own, like magical emanations. Secondly, the lord guru has said that we should keep the support of thefollowing five commitments: (1) Have the unceasing, earnest devotion to see the master who teaches you thepith instruction as a buddha in person. (2) Create favorable circumstances thataid you in meditation practice. (3) Give up any unfavorable, adversecircumstances. (4) Never let your meditative concentration fade throughout anyactivity, including when you walk, move around, sit, or lie down. (5) Neverabandon the yidam deity you are practicing, and carry through with its practiceand meditation until the end.This fifth point means that you should not accept and reject when it comes tothe yidam deity, but realize instead that no matter which deity you practice,the wisdom mind of all buddhas is the same. By simply meditating on one, you aremeditating on every buddha. There are no buddhas to meditate on other thanrealizing your mind. Since the yidam deity is also a projection of your mind,there is nothing separate to meditate on or accomplish. In short, all buddhasare embodied in the yidam deity. Whether you meditate on many different yidamdeities or on one alone, they are all projections of your mind.(6) Maintain confidentiality about the deity you are practicing, its essencemantra, and the nature of your practice and conduct. Keep them utterly secretfrom those who are unsuitable to hear about them.CONCLUDING ACTIVITIES The third main topic is about the concluding activities, which consist of thethree aspects of dedication, aspiration, and making auspicious prayers.DEDICATION Here what we are dedicating is everything positive in the past, present, andfuture, represented by the training in the development and completion stagesthat we have now carried out correctly in all its preparatory, primary, andconcluding parts. The goal to which we dedicate this is the state of Vajradhara,the sovereign buddha of the sixth family, the embodiment of the five wisdoms andthe four bodies of enlightenment, which is to say, complete and perfectenlightenment that does not dwell in either of the two extremes. We dedicatethis goodness to all sentient beings throughout the reaches of space so thatthey may attain the result of unexcelled wisdom. It is dedicated in anonconceptual manner devoid of subject or object of dedication, considering thatin ultimate truth the nature of everything is nonduality. At the same time, on apurely relative and conventional level, there is a dreamlike illusory experienceof someone doing something, an object of that action, and a virtue being carriedout, though in truth there is no reality to them.In harmony with this, chant the verse of dedication while thinking sincerely andone-pointedly: “Just as the conquerors who appear in the past, present, andfuture, as well as their spiritual heirs, dedicate, I too dedicate this virtuecompletely to unexcelled enlightenment.” The value and benefit of dedicating inthis way is such that your accomplishments become inexhaustible. This isdescribed in The Sūtra Requested by Sāgaramati: > When a drop of water falls into a great ocean,> It will remain until the ocean itself dries up.> Just so, when dedicated to complete enlightenment,> Virtue will remain until enlightenment is attained.ASPIRATION Next, while suffused with the attitude of the mind of awakening, make pureaspirations for the vast benefit of everyone. Recite the aspiration verse fromyour specific text and make the ten great aspirations: to worship the buddhas,to uphold the sacred teachings, to always display form bodies, to enter intoevery realm, to complete the perfections, to bring sentient beings to maturity,to purify realms, to act out the activity of the bodhisattvas, to only behave ina meaningful way, and to attain great enlightenment. Make these prayers andcountless others. Then chant “The Aspiration of Excellent Conduct” spoken bynoble Samantabhadra and any other suitable aspiration, for example, that theteachings may flourish.AUSPICIOUS PRAYERS Finally, imagine that the maṇḍala deities, along with all buddhas and theirspiritual heirs throughout every time and place, proclaim the true words ofauspicious prayer, sing melodious vajra songs, and rain down a great cascade ofheavenly flowers. With this in mind, join in their auspicious prayer, sing, playmusic, scatter flowers, and so on. In this way, no matter what situation weencounter in the four times and ten directions, may even the word “adversity”never be heard, and may excellent prosperity and auspicious signs proliferate asour hopes and aims are fulfilled according to our wishes.* * * This description has purely followed the style of practice called “devotedtraining.” The part up to and including the three samādhis constitutes“approach.” The visualization of oneself as the main deity constitutes “closeapproach.” The visualization of the female consort, including the consecrationof the secret space, along with the complete visualization of all the retinuedeities, constitutes “accomplishment.” Finally, the empowerment, sealing,invitation, and so on up to the recitation, offering, and praise constitute“great accomplishment.” This is described in The Tantra of the Great Practice ofKīlaya: > To define Secret Mantra in general,> Developing the three samādhis is “approach,”> Visualizing yourself as the deity, “close approach,”> The female consort is known as “accomplishment,”> While the other parts are “great accomplishment.” It is said that just carrying out the practice correctly in this manner duringone single session—complete in all its preparatory, primary, and concludingparts—garners an eon’s worth of the accumulations, which is evidence of theincredible richness of skillful means present in Secret Mantra. The fact that asharp-minded person of superior intelligence and diligence can gather threeincalculable eons’ worth of the accumulations in one lifetime comes down to thesame key point. Therefore, it is crucial that we strive solely in this approach.The other fine details of how to engage in the four aspects of approach andaccomplishment and their proper practice can only be understood from thewritings of past masters and especially from the instructions of the lord guru. AFTERWORD > People like me may not be very fortunate,> Yet under the care of numerous teachers who are genuine buddhas> I have imbibed much of the nectar of ripening and liberation.> So perhaps I’m still fortunate at the end of the dark age. > Though I have surely spent most of my life lost in distraction,> I’ve posed in recitation retreat now for more than a decade.> Though I’ve not gained stability in the path of definite perfection,> I’ve gained a bit of acquaintance with devoted training. > What is the use of long explanations and verbosity—> Does that style even impress modern-day people?> Instead, I’ve combined my own limited experience> With a few quotations of the great saints of the past. > With the intention of aiding beginners, my Dharma friends,> Both those living today and those yet to come,> I focused on the ease of understanding as I wrote this.> I apologize to the protectors for any errors and mistakes. > Before, profound instructions were paid for in gold, and practiced.> These days people consider just reading books a hardship.> So what more can I hope for than to lend a small hand> To uneducated beginners like myself? > When life is so short, and sudden mishaps abound,> We can’t expect to stay long in this degenerate time.> So take the essential, core meaning to heart,> And do not squander your lives, my friends. > Since no one can cover the vast span of all there is to know,> Why not apply whatever you have learned?> Thus, for this dark age with our minds rife with disturbance,> The vajra holders taught this supremely effective method. > It is said, not just once, but in many secret tantras,> That those who meet this teaching have reached the end of existence.> So now that you have acquired the freedom to choose,> Strive as much as you can on the path of the two stages. > The three vajras of innate luminosity are the basis of purification,> The three fleeting experiences and the veil of transference are the object of> purification,> Through the process of purification, the practice of the three vajras,> May the result of purification auspiciously manifest in this life. In order to assist people who are as dull-witted as me I made the aspiration tocompose a text that would serve as a supplement to The Great General Guide toRecitation. That text is authored by the lord guru and great vajra holder LodroThaye, the emanation body whom the Buddha himself prophesied to be a regent ofthe Sage in the northern land. He was an assembler of the scriptures on thedefinitive secret and none other than the lord of secrets, Vajradharma, inperson.Moreover, the supreme emanation body Kunzang Lodro Shenpen Thaye and, morerecently, the diligent practitioner Jamyang Losel also both encouraged me withpersistent and sincere requests. Finally, my younger brother, Tubten GelegGyamtso, and the eminent Lama Shingkyong advised that it would be good tocompose it soon.Even though the elements in my body were disturbed and ravaged me with the forceof an ocean, I could not ignore these requests. So I brought the moonlikecompassion of the Three Jewels to mind and decided to write.Thus I, Gyurme Pema Namgyal from Shechen Monastery, authored this text at theDemchog Tashi Gepel Hermitage. May it bring all beings to the level of theall-pervading Lord Vajrasattva in a festival of supreme spiritual attainment,and may this cause the precious, essential teachings of the definitive secret toremain long and flourish.BIBLIOGRAPHY [CR%210YBEZ33SMH6V78ZMKH21Q0PWCEWC_split_000.html#filepos11020]image [images/00004.jpg] Dilgo Khyentse.
