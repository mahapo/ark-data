I consider that the composition of synopses of this nature—terse and meaningful, succinct and precise—is within the perceptual range of omniscient beings alone, and otherwise inconceivable.The task of understanding all the points expressed in this scripture, which integrates the many different classical sciences, and then rendering it in Eng­lish, is one of great difficulty, and there are without doubt many complexities.

In Tibetan, there are two extant autobiographical accounts, not to mention the writings of his student Karma Tashi Chopel and the later abridged biographies contained in the Bud­dhist histories of Zhechen Gyaltsab (1910) and Dudjom Rinpoche (1964). Gene Smith was the first Western scholar to appraise the life and works of Kongtrul in his ground-breaking introduction to the Indian edition of the Treasury of Knowledge, published in 1970. The longest account in English is Richard Barron’s translation, entitled The Autobiography of Jamgon Kongtrul (2.003); while short hagiographies are also be found in the English transla­tion of Dudjom Rinpoche’s The Nyingma School o f Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History (1991) and in Ringu Tulkus The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great (zoo 6).Revered as a spiritual emanation of the great eighth-century translator Vairocana, Jamgon Kongtrul was born into a Bon family at Rongyab Pema Lhatse in Drida Zelmogang, within the principality of Derge. After famil­iarizing himself with the teachings and iconography of the Bon tradition in childhood, and mastering the local pharmacopeia, he was introduced to the formal study and practice of Buddhism from his eighteenth year onwards— initially at Zhechen under the tutelage of Gyurme Tutob Namgyal (b. 1787) and subsequently at Palpung, which had been founded by Situ Chokyi Jungne (1700-1774). In these institutions he twice received the vows of monastic ordination, according to the lower and upper Vinaya lineages respectively. During these formative years, Kongtrul accepted Situ Pema Nyinje (1774- 1853) as his main teacher, receiving the Kagyu and Jonangpa transmissions from him and some sixty other teachers in all. His exhaustive studies are fully documented in the record of his received teachings {gsan yig), which was devotedly compiled by Karma Tashi Chopel.In 184Z, Situ Pema Nyinje granted Kongtrul permission to leave the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2 —THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEmonastery and enter into a three-year solitary retreat at Tsadra Rinchen Drak, revered as one of the twenty-five foremost power-places in Kham, specifically associated with the “mind aspect of Padmasambhavas enlightened attributes” (yon tan gyi thugs). At Tsadra, on a concealed ridge, high above Palpung Monastery, Kongtrul founded the hermitage of Kunzang Dechen Oseling. It was here that he completed his prodigious writings, passed long periods in isolated meditation, and first liaised with his closest associates—Jamy- angKhyentse Wangpo of Dzongsar (1820-1892), Chogyur Dechen Lingpa of Nangchen (1829-1870), and others—to establish the dynamic and all- embracing non-sectarian (ris med) tradition of eastern Tibet. Together, they sought to preserve and integrate the diverse lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, large and small, without fear of persecution, in an age of increasing strife. Receptive to Padmasambhavas spiritual revelations, they also mapped out the twenty-five ancient sacred sites of eastern Tibet which had been imbued with his blessings.While Kongtrul uniquely juxtaposed the realizations of Tibet’s diverse spiritual traditions, Buddhist and Bon, he had a special affinity with the Jona- ngpa and Shangpa Kagyu teachings maintained in the lineage of Taranatha (1575-1634). His writings display a particular penchant for the views and expositions of this multi-talented renaissance figure and later scholars who empathized with his approach—Nyingma masters such as Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu (1698-1755) and Gyurme Tsewang Chokdrub (1761-1829) ofKatok, and Sarma masters including the aforementioned Situ Chokyi Jungne of Palpung.After dedicating a lifetime to the preservation ofTibet s spiritual traditions in their entirety, Kongtrul passed away at Tsadra in his eighty-seventh year. By that time he had ensured the successful transmission of his diverse teach­ings to the foremost lineage-holders of a younger generation, who resolved to continue this legacy of eclecticism into the twentieth century.DergeIt is true that the success of Jamgon Kongtruls all-embracing non-sectarian approach can be measured in terms of his outstanding attributes and talents alone, yet his activities were undeniably facilitated by the political climate in which he lived and worked. The principality of Derge, where Jamgon Kong­trul was born, is characterized by fast-flowing rivers that, in summertime, carry fertile red silt downstream through alpine woodlands and small farming vil­lages, discharging into the turbid Yangtze Gorge. The villages, which exude an"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONair of quiet prosperity—their houses constructed distinctively of red-painted horizontal timbers, with surrounding barley fields—were renowned for their craftsmen and artisans, working in metal and wood-carving.The rulers of Derge, who had been granted hegemony in Kham by Cho- gyal Phakpa and assumed outright power from the mid-fourteenth century onwards, claimed their descent from Lonpo Gar—an illustrious seventh-cen­tury emissary of the Tibetan emperor Songtsen Gampo. Under their author­ity, the Bon, Nyingma, and Sakya traditions all flourished in Derge—their best known sites being at Dzong-nying, Katok, and Dzongsar, respectively. In the early fifteenth century, Lodro Tobden relocated his capital and palace to a sheltered ravine abutting the Zi-chu River, where, in 1448, Tangtong Gyalpo consecrated the site for the building of Gonchen Monastery.Later, in the eighteenth century, Tenpa Tsering (1678-1738) brought Derge to the zenith of its power by conquering the outlying northern grasslands of Dzachuka and the Jomda region to the west of the Yangtze. Under his aus­pices, two imposing, free-standing buildings were constructed in a strikingly similar architectural style, both of them destined to become vital centers of learning and repositories of Tibetan culture. One was Palpung Monastery, founded in 1717 above the village of Rashenda in the Pa-chu Valley, which the king bequeathed to Situ Chokyi Jungne, the eighth incumbent of the Tai Situpa lineage of the Kagyu school. The other was the Derge Parkhang, founded between 1729 and 1750 within the Gonchen monastic complex of the Sakya-Ngor tradition. This treasure-store of Tibet’s great literary endeavors still houses the largest and most eclectic collection of xylographs and printed texts on the plateau. It was here that Situ Chokyi Jungne, Zhuchen Tsultrim Rinchen, and Gyurme Tsewang Chokdrub respectively edited newly commis­sioned xylographic editions of the Kangyur, Tengyur, and Nyingma Gyud- bum, the woodblocks of which are still used for printing at the present day.This remarkably tolerant and culturally stimulating environment provided the setting for Jamgon Kongtruls refreshing non-sectarian approach. The eclectic patronage of the Derge rulers during the seventeenth to mid-nine­teenth centuries stood in marked contrast to the fortress-like mentality of the neighboring lands of Eastern Tibet—Jyekundo, Sershul, and Beri, where a Bon chieftain had been deposed and his lands occupied by Gushi Qan in the 1640s. In those regions, large Gelukpa monasteries had been established by Mongol force of arms, often uprooting or supplanting the earlier traditions.Yet, even Derge could not remain aloof from the turbulence of the age. In 1863, the principality succumbed to Gonpo Namgyal, the chieftain of Nyarong, around the time when Jamgon Kongtrul was composing his"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEsupremely eclectic treatise, The Treasury of Knowledge. Then, shortly after this work was completed, in 1865, the forces of Nyarong were defeated by an expeditionary force from Lhasa. During this period, Jamgon Kongtrul is said to have personally averted a forced conversion of Kagyu monasteries, includ­ing Palpung, to the Gelukpa school by successfully offering medical treatment to Dongkam Tulku of Drayab. Although the principality relinquished its independence in 1909, one short decade after Kongtruls passing, when the Chinese warlord Zhao Erfeng incorporated it within his new but short-lived Xikang Province, Derge even now retains its prestige as the cultural center of Kham.Do xo graphical Traditio nsJust as Western literature can be said to have, in the words of the encyclope­dist Robert Hutchins, maintained a “great conversation,” handing down and reworking ideas, insights, and methodologies in successive literary contexts since the time of Homer, the world of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism has contin­ued its own parallel great conversation, one that can be traced back to the canonical works of the Buddha, the classical Indian commentaries, and Tibet’s indigenous commentarial literature. While this conversation has continued unabated into the modern era, in the writings ofDudjomJigdral Yeshe Dorje, Dungkar Lobzang Trinle, Tseten Zhabdrung, and so forth, many historians share the view that Jamgon Kongtruls writings and those of his contempo­raries, notably Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Mipham Namgyal Gyatso, represent the culmination of the trend towards syncretism in those works of Tibetan literature that focus on the theoretical understandings and practical application of the Buddhist teachings.There are some early canonical sutras that might be considered doxographi­cal in content, such as the Net of Brahma (.Brahmajdlasutra), which iden­tifies sixty-two distinct inauthentic views with regard to the limits of past and future time. However, the Indian master Bhavaviveka (ca. 500-570) is reckoned to have been the first exponent of classical Mahayana Buddhism to construct a formal, hierarchical doxography of all the Indian philosophical systems {siddhanta, grub mtha). In his Flame of Dialectics (Tarkajvala), he in fact differentiates one hundred and ten primary and three hundred and sixty-three derivative philosophical views. The trend which he set in motion continues in the elaborate commentarial writings of subsequent scholars, including Kamalaslla (740-795), Vitapada (fl. late ninth century), Avaloki- tavrata, and Bodhibhadra (fl. 1000). Later texts generally focus on the four"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 5commonly accepted philosophical systems of Indian Buddhism—Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Cittamatra, and Madhyamaka—preceded by a Buddhist analysis of the non-Buddhist systems of ancient India, including materialism, Jainism, and various strands of Brahmanism.From the eighth century onwards, the Indian Buddhist doxographical tra­dition began to take root in Tibet, initially in the writings of Kawa Peltsek and Zhang Yeshede, and later during the new wave of translations that flour­ished in Tibet from the eleventh century onwards. Each of the main Tibetan schools gradually evolved its distinctive standpoints with regard to the four main Indian Buddhist philosophical systems. Among the Nyingmapa, this trend is exemplified by the writings of Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo (fl. elev­enth century) and Longchen Rabjampa (1308-1363); among the Sakyapa, by the works of Sakya Panchen Kunga Gyaltsen (1182-1251) and Zilungpa Shakya Chokden (1428-1507); in the Kadampa school, by the systematic presentations of Chomden Rigpci Raldri (1227-1305) and his student Upa Losal (fl. thirteenth century); in the Kagyu school, by the likes of Karmapa RangjungDorje (1284-1339) andDrukchenPemaKarpo (1527-1592); in the Jonangpa school, by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292-1361) and Taranatha (1575-1634); andamong the Gelukpa, byTsongkhapa(i357-i4i9),Khedrub Gelek Pelzangpo (1385-1438), and the incumbents ofLabrangand Gonlung monasteries in Aando, notably Jamyang Zhepa II Konchok Jigme Wangpo (1728-17 9 i),Jangkya RolpeiDorje (1717-1786), and Tuken Lobzang Chokyi Nyima (1732-1802).While many of these great masters naturally tended to focus on the per­spectives of their own traditions and often highlighted their differences rather than their common ground, Tibet’s greatest literati of the eighteenth cen­tury made concerted efforts, in the wake of the civil war and persecutions of the seventeenth century, towards a more ecumenical approach, giving more emphasis to the commonality of the various traditions rather than the nuances that divided them. This eclectic approach found its inspiration in the long career of Tangtong Gyalpo (1361-1485), and was presaged during the eigh­teenth century by the non-partisan activities of Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu of Katok (1698-1755) and Situ Chokyi Jungne of Palpung (1700-1774).There were, in addition to those exponents of the Buddhist systems of philosophy, others who adopted an encyclopedic perspective, striving in their works to encompass the full range of secular and spiritual knowledge that had been handed down and preserved within die Indo-Tibetan classical tra­dition. Such works include the Elucidation of Knowledge (Sloes by a rab gsal) by Chogyal Phakpa Lodro Gyaltsen (1235-1280), the Compendium of Facts"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(De nyid \\duspa) by Bodong Panchen (1376-1451), and the Exegetical Trea­sury: A Wish-fulfilling Gem (bShad mdzodyid bzhin nor hu), attributed to Dondam Mawei Senge (fl. fifteenth century), which syncretizes ideas derived from Buddhism, Bon, and the mundane sciences—astrology, medicine, lin­guistics, and rhetoric. Later, during the early life ofjamgon Kongtrul, another important encyclopedia entitled Treasury of Sutras and Tantras {mDo rgyud mdzod) was compiled at Keude Monastery in Repkong by Tobden Choying Dorje (1785-1848). In five recently republished volumes, this work covers the full range of the classical sciences, sutras, and tantras, principally from a Nyingma perspective, and it may be considered an Amdowa precursor to Jamgon Kongtruls encyclopedia.Jam g o n Kongtrul’s WritingsThe collected writings ofjamgon Kongtrul are known as the “five great trea­suries” (mdzodchen Inga), a title prophetically bestowed upon them by Kong­trul s closest associate, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, in 18 6 4 when only the first of the five had been composed. As Dudjom Rinpoche writes, “When the vase ofjamgon Kongtruls mind had been filled with the textual exegeses and oral explanations of the transmitted precepts, treatises, tantras, transmissions and esoteric instructions, along with their rituals, practical techniques, and fine points, he too composed treatises. These form the wonderful legacy of his studies, reflections and meditations.”1Among these works, the earliest was The Treasury Encompassing A ll Knowl­edge {Shes bya kun khyab mdzod) in three volumes—ten books (gnas bcu) and forty parts (skabs bzhi bcu)—covering the entire corpus of the sutra and man­tra traditions, from the common sciences of Indo-Tibetan classical learning, all the way up to the uncommon teachings of Atiyoga, which is the culmina­tion of the nine vehicles of Buddhist practice. (1) The Treasury o f Precious Instructions [gDams ngag rin po che’i mdzod), in twelve volumes and nine books, collates the empowerment rites and oral instructions pertaining to the eight instructional lineages that are extant in Tibet—those of the Nyingma, Kadam, Sakya, Marpa Kagyu, Shangpa Kagyu, Kalacakra, Pacification, and Oddiyana tradition of ritual service and attainment. (3) The Tretisury of Kagyu Mantra {bKd brgyud sngags kyi mdzod), in six volumes, contains descrip­tions of thirteen principal mandalas along with guidance on the perfection stage of meditation and integrated empowerment rites according to tantras of both the ancient and new transmissions, with an emphasis on the cycles of Marpa and Ngok.

The former was composed at the Tsadra Hermitage in1862, at the behest of Dabzang Ngedon Tenpa Rabgye, who had requested Kongtrul to write more narrowly, on the integration of monastic, bodhi- sattva, and mantra vows. Kongtrul purposefully widened the scope of his treatise, following in the tradition of the earlier encyclopedists, and success­fully integrated the full range of traditional Buddhist studies and practice in his work. It is said that the commentary was compiled and written at the behest of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo in only four months, during the year1863, and revised in its final form the following year, with the assistance of Tashi Ozer of Palpung.This work, as mentioned above, contains ten books, the first four of which are historically oriented, focussing respectively on cosmology, the Buddha, his teachings, and their propagation in ancient India and Tibet. The fifth book concerns the integration of monastic, bodhisattva, and mantra vows, while the next three concern the cultivation of discriminative awareness, which is to be achieved respectively by study, reflection, and meditation. The last two books offer Kongtrul s syncretic analysis of the spiritual paths and goals attained through the causal and fruitional vehicles of Buddhist practice.Each of the ten books is also divided into four parts, through which the author moves gradually from general or foundational levels of exegesis towards more specialized and advanced themes, objectively explaining the distinctions between different theories and practices, without adopting a partisan stance."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Book Six: The Cultivation of Discrim inative Aw areness th r o u g h StudyAmong the ten books, the sixth specifically concerns the range of traditional studies through which discriminative awareness may be cultivated. The first part focuses on the so-called common fields of knowledge (.sadharanavidya) and the meditative techniques of calm abiding (samatha) and higher insight (;vipaJyana) through which spiritual progress can be achieved, with or without successfully terminating the cycle of rebirth. The second part highlights the distinctions between non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosophical systems and goes on to present three nuanced perspectives of Buddhist phenomenology (,abhidharma), based on the commentarial traditions associated with the three successive promulgations of the sutras. Part three oudines the philosophical systems of the so-called causal vehicles—those of the pious attendants, her­mit buddhas, and bodhisattvas, culminating in the elaborate presentation of Madhyamaka philosophy, from the perspectives of intrinsic emptiness, independent reasoning, consequential reasoning, extrinsic emptiness, and its integration with the view of the tantras. Part four presents the philosophi­cal systems of the resultant or fruitional vehicles—those of Action Tantra, Conduct Tantra, Yoga Tantra, and Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra—emphasizing the distinctive continua of the ground, path, and result, and outlining the scriptures and exegetical techniques favored by exponents of both the new (gsarma) and ancient (rnyingma) traditions.The present work contains an annotated English translation of parts one and two, under the collective title Indo-Tibetan Classical Learning and Bud­dhist Phenomenology. The two subsequent parts of Book Six have already been translated and published—part three by Elizabeth Callahan under the title Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy, and part four by Elio Guarisco and Ingrid McLeod under the title Systems of Buddhist Tantra.Part On e: In d o-Tibetan Classical LearningEarly in Book Six, Jamgon Kongtrul remarks that since the enlightened attri­butes of erudition are limitless, studies should be thoroughly pursued in an impartial manner—as if explaining his own non-sectarian motivation in writing this treatise. He begins by defining the purpose of learning, with the preamble:In order that persons who have become well grounded in the higherethical disciplines that form the basis of all those virtuous teach-8 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 9ings [discussed in Book Five] might understand without error the spiritual paths that lead to freedom [from cyclic existence] and to omniscience [as expounded in Books Seven and Eight], it will be necessary to investigate the discriminative awareness (prajna, shes rab) that arises through studying the [various] fields of knowledge, which are as vast as an ocean in their extent.He then concisely crystallizes the content of Books Five, Six, Seven, and Eight—the core of his treatise—in the following words:It is through knowledge of non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosoph­ical and spiritual systems (siddhanta, grub m tha) [i.e., Book Six] that one will come to discern those things that should be adopted and those things that should be renounced. Then, after one has studied the training of ethical discipline (iilaiiksa., tshul khrims kyi bslabpa) [i.e., Book Five], negative actions will be reversed.After studying the training of the mind (<cittasiksd, sems kyi bslab pa) [through meditation, i.e., Book Seven], pointless desires will be completely abandoned; and after studying the training of dis­criminative awareness (prajnasiksa, shes rab kyi bslab pa) [i.e., Book Eight], the state of nirvana that is actually free from corruption will be attained.The range of general subjects that fall within the scope of Indo-Tibetan classical learning traditionally include the “five major sciences” of Sanskrit grammar, logic, fine arts, medicine, and Buddhist philosophy, along with a further group of “five minor sciences”—astrology, poetics, prosody, lexicogra­phy or synonymies, and dramaturgy. The latter classification appears to have evolved from the Vedic doxography of the six subsidiary sciences necessary for the comprehension of ritual texts (sadvedanga) in the Brahmanical tradition, namely, ritual sacrifice (kalpa), elocution (siksa)y prosody (chandas), etymol- ogy (nirukta), grammar (vydkarana), and astronomy/ astrology (jyotisa). The rationale for including these disparate subjects as an aid to spiritual cultiva­tion is offered in a scriptural passage from the Sutra o f Great Skillful Means Repaying [the Buddha] with Gratitude (Thabs mkhaspa drin lan bsabspai mdo), which says:In this regard, if you ask why bodhisattvas continue to pursue these studies, bodhisattvas continue to investigate thoroughly"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the teachings of the Buddha because they are obliged to master earnestly and authentically all doctrines that are in conformity with the sacred teaching and because they impart those doctrines extensively and authentically to others.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science oflogic because they have to thoroughly and qualitatively understand the elo­quence and solecism found in the treatises themselves, because they are obliged to refute the critiques of others, because they have to convince those lacking faith in this teaching [of Buddhism], and because they have to reinvigorate those who already have faith.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of grammar because, while constructing refined Sanskrit syntax with fine words and syllables and an elegant use of etymological definitions, they inspire confidence in those wishing them to speak, and because they have to employ terminology in conformity with diverse ety­mological nuances, even though their shades of meaning might be identical.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of medicine because they are obliged to alleviate the various ailments that afflict sentient beings, and because they can benefit the great mass of living creatures.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the aspects of knowl­edge concerning the status of mundane past actions because they acquire resources without difficulty for the sake of sentient beings, and because they are obliged to cherish all sentient beings.And:The five ordinary sciences cultivated by bodhisattvas are also to be investigated because bodhisattvas are obliged to perfect the great provision of pristine cognition (jñánasambhára,ye sloes kyi tshogs) of unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment. If they do not study all those subjects, they will not in due course attain the unobscured all-knowing pristine cognition.Prior to commencing the study of the classical sciences, it will be essential to grasp the intricacies of phonetics and semantics. To this end, Kongtrul starts by emphasizing the importance of articulation, etymology, graphology, phonology, syntax, and morphology in respect of the Sanskrit and TibetanIO - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- IIlanguages. He also summarizes Che Khyidruks Eight Elements of Linguistic Application (Jugpaignas brgyad), where the semantic concepts of objective referent, sound generation, shared ideation, commonality, and adhesion are introduced.Armed with these linguistic tools, the neophyte may commence the study of the classical sciences, keeping in mind that in Book Six, Kongtrul discusses the actual content of the various classical sciences rather than their historical transmission and the literary sources, which he has already covered in Book Four. Generally speaking, he notes that:Grammar and logic eradicate wrong understandings of word and meaning. Fine arts and medicine bring into the fold students [seek­ing] both general and particular [skills].Theinnerscience [of Bud­dhism] brings about an understanding of all aspects of the path to omniscience. Therefore, the classical sciences may also be grouped in three categories: those that eradicate [wrong understandings], those that bring [seekers] into the fold, and the one through which omniscience is attained.Sanskrit GrammarKongtruls presentation of Sanskrit grammar {sabdavidya, sgrai riggnas) owes much to the writings of Situ Chokyi Jungne of Palpung (1699-1774), who was one of the most influential Tibetan authorities on Sanskrit language and the related vedahga literature. The ancient Grammar of Pdnini had been translated into Tibetan only during the seventeenth century. Instead, Sanskrit grammati­cal studies had been traditionally pursued in Tibet through the medium of the three medieval grammars—the Kaldpasutra, the Candravyakarana, and the Sarasvatavyakarana. Among these, the Shaivite Kaldpasutra (also known as the Kdtantra) had great popularity in northern India and Nepal from the thir­teenth century onwards and was translated by Pang Lodro Tenpa and Buton Rinchendrub during the fourteenth century. The Buddhist Candravyakarana is a masterful abridgement of Pdnini composed by Candragomin, one of the great scholars of the Nalanda tradition, which had great prestige in Tibet. The Sdrasvatavydkarana, revealed in a vision to Anubhutisvarupa, was translated from the seventeenth century onwards on three occasions—by Taranatha, by Darpa Lotsawa, and by Situ Chokyi Jungne.The traditional presentation of Sanskrit grammar outlined here is based on the distinctions between primary bases {prakrti, rang bzhin), affixation"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"II -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(pratyaya, rkyen), and morphological derivation (vikdra, mam gyur), as pre­sented in the writings of Pang Lodro Tenpa. There are two different sorts of primary base—verbal roots (dhatu, byings) and nominal stems (naman, ming). Affixation is applied to these stems or roots through the agency of verbal or nominal suffixes, which can differentiate tense, mood, voice, num­ber, declension, gender, and case. The processes of morphological derivation are more complex and are traditionally understood through the so-called Paninian technical markers (anubandha, rjes su ’brel ba), which prescribe certain rules for forming derivatives, as well as through the diverse verbal prepositions, augments, and affixes which can be appended, and the compex rules for elision, vowel strengthening, and euphonic conjunction {sandhi, sbyor ba). Many examples are offered in the course of this terse summary, which concludes with a short section on the nuances of nominal compound­ing (.samdsa, tshigsdud), a distinctive feature of Sanskrit syntax, that enables several conjoined word-forms to take a single termination.Following in the footsteps of Situ Chokyi Jungne, who encouraged the study of Sanskrit grammatical and related literature, Kongtrul concludes this section by stating that “for one who would learn the phonetic articulations of the Sanskrit language, an intelligence that easily understands both word and meaning will arise if one becomes undeluded with regard not only to the words but also to their meaning.”Buddh ist LogicBuddhist logic (pramanavidya, tshadmai riggnas) is founded on the classical Sanskrit treatises of Dignaga, Dharmaklrti, and their commentators. All the main schools of Tibetan Buddhism also developed distinctive interpretations and points of emphasis. Among them, the earliest Tibetan interpretations include the Kadampa writings of Chapa Chokyi Senge (ii 09-1169), Chom- den Rigpei Raldri (1227-1305), and Bodong Panchen (1376-1451). Within the Sakya tradition, the most influential text is the Tshad ma rigsgter of Sakya Panchen Kunga Gyaltsen (1182-1251) and its commentaries by Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429-1489) andZilungpaShakyaChokden (1428-1507). For Kagyupas, the most influential source is the Rigs pai gzhung lugs kyi rgya mtsho ofKarmapa VII Chodrak Gyatso (1454-1506), although Kongtrul also cites the work of Zhamarpa VI Garwang Chokyi Wangchuk (1584-1630).Noteworthy Nyingma exponents, who by and large have adopted a more utilitarian approach to the study of logic, include Sodokpa Lodro Gyaltsen (b. 1552) and more recently Mipham Namgyal Gyatso (1846-1912). On the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 13other hand, Gelukpa writers have tended to emphasize the study of logic as an elaborate preliminary exercise that hones the mind for spiritual practice. Fol­lowers ofTsongkhapa who have exemplified this approach include Khedrubje Gelek Pelzangpo (1385-1438), Panchen Sonam Drakpa (1478-1554), and more recently Phurbuchok Tsultrim Jampa Gyatso Pelzangpo (1825-1901). The last mentioned authored th z Magic Key of the Path of Reason: A Presenta­tion of the Collected Topics, Analyzing the Meaning of Valid Cognition (Tshad maigzhung don ’byedpdi bsdusgrva mam gzhag rigs lam ’phrulgyi Ide mig), which has become a bible for structured debate.Kongtrul begins by reiterating that the purpose of Buddhist logic is to “eradicate wrong understandings, with regard to all objects of knowledge that are not directly evident but held to be indirectly evident to one s own mind.” His main exegesis appears to follow the tradition of Phurbuchok, although parallels are found also in Sakya Panchens Tshad ma rigsgter. There are diree main topics to be analyzed: appraisable objects (visaya,yul), subjects (visayin, yul can), and processes of logical understanding.Appraisable objects are categorized as either substantial (dngospo) or insub­stantial (dngos med) in nature, the former comprising external and internal matter, and the latter cognitive phenomena. Among them, substantial objects have causal efficiency {kdrana, byed pa), either in terms of direct or indirect causes; they may be compounded or uncompounded (dus by as dang dus ma byas); and they may be permanent or impermanent (rtagpa dang mi rtag pa). In terms of their process of objectification, objects are also classed as apparent (snangyul), apprehended {grdhyakavisaya, bzungyut), conceived {adhyavasayavisaya, zhenyut), or engaged {jug yul). In terms of their under­standing, however, they are said to include specifically or generally charac­terized phenomena, directly or indirecdy evident objects of appraisal, and signified phenomena (vakya, brjod by a).Subjects are, by contrast, defined as signifiers (vdcaka, brjod byed), com­prising nouns (naman, ming), syntactically bound phrases (pada, tshig), and sentences (vdk, ngag). They include words that signify types {rigs brjod kyi sgra) or sets {tshogs brjod kyi sgra); words signifying predicate expressions {chos brjod kyi sgra); and words signifying subject expressions {chos can brjod pdi sgra), or preclusion {vyavaccheda, mam gcod). In terms of their theoreti­cal presentation, subjects are also analyzed as direcdy or implicitly conceived signifiers {zhenpdi brjod byed) and actual signifiers {dngos kyi brjod byed).Having then defined what is meant by the terms “syllable” {varna,yige) and “individual person” {gangzag), Kongtrul shows how valid, reliable cognition {pramdna, tshad ma) takes place either through direct perception {mngon"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"sum tshad ma) or inference (rjes dpag tshad ma)—the former including direct perception of the senses, mental consciousness, intrinsic awareness, and yoga, and die latter including inference through the cogent power of facts, popular acclaim, and conviction. On the other hand, cognition may also be unreli­able {apramdna, tshad min), just as it may be conceptual or non-conceptual, and mistaken or unmistaken. Distinctions are then drawn between intrinsic or reflexive awareness (.svasamvedana, rang rig) and extraneous awareness {anyasamvid,gzhan rig), and between mind (citta,sems) and its diverse mental states (caitta, sems byung).The logical understanding acquired in relation to the aforementioned objects and subjects may result from the presence of contradiction (virudha, galba), relation {sambandha, *brelba), negation {pratisedha, dgagpa), proof (;vidhi, sgrubpa), universals {sdmdnya, spyi), particulars (visesa, bye brag), iden­tity and difference {abhinnabhinna,gcigdang tha dad), eliminative engage­ment {apohapravrtti, sel jug), affirmative engagement (vidhipravrtti, sgrub ’jug), or extraneous elimination {any dp oh a, gzh an set). Specific expressions are also categorized as exemplars of definition (laksana, mtshan nyid) or definien- dum (laksya, mtshon bya); and as substance phenomena {dravyadharma, rdzas chos) or distinguishing counterpart phenomena {vydvrttidharma, Idog chos).When inference is employed for ones own sake {rangdon rjes dpag), the property of the thesis {paksadharma, phyogs chos) may be subject to either forward logical entailment {anvayavydpti, rjeskhyab) or counter logical entail- ment {vyatirekavydpti, Idog khyab). Genuine evidence may be obtained in three ways {gtan tshigs gsum): through the axiom of the result {kdryahetu,Jbras bui rtags), the axiom of identity (svabhdvahetu, rangbzhingyi rtags), and the axiom of the absence of the objective referent {ma dmigs pa’i rtags). On the other hand, untenable evidence {khas mi len pa i rtags) may be rejected as ostensible, contradictory, uncertain, or unestablished. The examples employed in the construction of logical arguments {drstdnta, dpe) are classified as cor­rect analogous examples, non-analogous examples, or ostensible examples.When inference is employed for others’ sake {gzhan don rjes dpag), the argument may take the form of either a correctly formulated statement of proof {sgrub ngag) with qualitative similarity or dissimilarity, or an ostensible statement of proof {sgrub ngagltar snang), in which case the evidence {rtags) that has been presented may be subject to elimination, refutation, or conse­quential reasoning. Kongtrul also describes the defining characteristics of an ideal antagonist {snga rgot) and an ideal respondent or protagonist {phyi rgot) in the context of debate.The author ends this section by mentioning other important logical tra­14 - t h e t r e a s u r y of k n o w l e d g e"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 15ditions that evolved in Tibet prior to Phurbuchok, including that of Sakya Panchen s Treasure of Logical Reasoning [Tshad ma rigs g ter), Karmapa Cho- drak Gyatso s Oceanic Textbook o f Uncommon Logical Reasoning [Thun min rig gzhung rgya mtsho), and the ancient Kadampa logical traditions.He then goes on to summarize che techniques employed in debate or dia­lectics. These include correct and ostensible forms of direct perception and inference, correct and ostensible forms of proof and refutation, and apprais- able objects that may be directly evident, indirectly evident, or indirectly evident to an extreme degree. Moreover, according to the particular Kagyu presentation of Zhamarpa Chokyi Wangchuk, five essential modes of logical reasoning are identified.The practicalities of debate include how to recognize evidence and specific predicates [rtagsgsalgyi ngos dzin),zn6. what are the suitable rejoinders made by respondents to antagonists upon recognizing or accepting a valid cogni­tion, or a non-valid cognition, on the basis of non-establishment of the argu­ment, contradictory reasoning, or unascertained reasoning. The dialectician should know that there are eight possible approaches to logical entailment [khyabpasgo brgyad), namely, forward logical entailment (,anvayavydpti, rjes khyab), contrary entailment (viruddhavyapti, gal khyab), backward entail­ment (hesthavyapti, thur khyab), and counter entailment (vyatirekavydpti, Idog khyab), each of which may be positive or negative.Fine ArtsThe indigenous Indian literature concerning the fine and applied arts [silpasastra, bzo rig) includes commentaries on specific chapters or elements of the tantras. Among them are the works of Kuladatta, Jaggadarpana, Sakyamitra, and Atreya. In emphasizing the importance of the arts, Kong­trul remarks thatAll the [material] things that are deemed necessary for the Bud­dhist teachings and mundane activities cannot be created or achieved without relying on this science [of fine arts].And:Although the [diverse] artistic traditions are infinite, all aspects of knowledge—not only the arts—can be categorized in terms of the “fine arts of the three media” [body, speech, and mind]."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In this section, which is the most extensive in Book Six, Part One, Kongtrul considers the physical, vocal, and mental arts in succession. Each of these has supreme and common forms; and in the case of the supreme arts of the body, these comprisesculptures, paintings, and sculpted images of the buddhas, which are all representations of buddha body; the literary works of India and Tibet, which are representations of buddha speech; and the stupas and [various] kinds of symbolic hand-held emblem, which are representations of buddha mind.The section on the representations of buddha body (sku rten) is preceded by a passage discussing the virtues and faults exhibited by artists and patrons of the arts. Sculptures and paintings depicting the icons of sacred Buddhist art are to be drawn in accordance with the prescribed rules of iconometric proportion (brten pa lha’i cha tshad). In general, it is said that there are five iconometric scales and six categories of icons, which accords with the distinc­tions found in the Tantra of the Wheel of Time (.Kdlacakra Tantra), the Tantra o f the Emergence of Cakrasamvara (Samvarodaya Tantra), and the Tantras of Black and Red Yamdri (Krsnayamdri Tantra/ Raktayamari Tantrardja). More specifically, however, in terms of current practice, there are two main traditions of iconographic measurement extant in Tibet—the Encampment style {gar bri) of Eastern Tibet, which bases itself on Buton Rinchendrub’s identification of eleven distinct categories of icon, and the Menri {sman ris) style, based on Menla Dondrub s system, which recognizes eight distinct cat­egories of icon.The essential elements of iconographic painting and sculpture that require the undivided attention of the artist include the demeanor {nyams\\ posture (dugstangs\\ ornaments (rgyan), hand emblems {phyagmtshan), thrones, and backrests {khri rgyab)> as well as the application of colors and shading (tshon mdangs), stylistic features [mam ’gyur), and the correction of errors in drafts­manship {skyon set). Special procedures and iconometric rules are applied when drawing and painting celestial palaces {rten gzhalyas khang) and the elements of the mandalas they contain. Colored sand may be applied to repre­sent the distinct bands of a mandala—its walls, gates, and pedimental arches. Furthermore, the symbols emblematic of the deities may be represented as either two-dimensional painted forms or three-dimensional sculpted forms.The representations of buddha speech {gsung rten) include the ancient Indie scripts, some of which, such as Ranjana and Vartula, are still well-known16 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 17in Tibet, and the various categories of Tibetan scripts. Kongtrul, in the lat­ter case, emphasizes the evolution and functions of the headed and head­less block-letter forms of Tibetan script (gzab chen/chung). He includes pith instructions concerning the eight important strokes in block-letter calligra­phy, the ten calligraphic points to be memorized and recited, the twenty-one primary characteristics, the sixteen secondary characteristics, the three gen­eral characteristics, and the calligraphic gridlines. The functions and useful­ness of other Tibetan scripts are then examined, among them the headless thick-stroked italic script (Jbru chen), the headless thin-stroked italic script (Jbru chung), the handwriting scripts (bshurma) and the cursive shorthand scripts (’khyugyig). In a long passage of verse, he describes the technicalities of paper-making (bris gzhi), the cutting of bamboo pens (rgya smyug), and the preparation of vermilion and black ink (mtshal snag).The representations of buddha mind (thugs rten) include stupas, which are essentially of five types: those that are spontaneously present by nature, those that are unsurpassed, those that are consecrated by blessings, those that have arisen from spiritual accomplishments, and those that correspond to the different vehicles. In terms of actual stupa construction, however, there are different designs to be followed, including die model stupas prescribed for ordinary persons, pious attendants, hermit buddhas, and buddhas. The last, which are most widely constructed in the Indo-Tibetan tradition, themselves comprise eight distinct types, symbolic of eight distinct deeds in the life of the Buddha, namely, the Stupa of the Sugatas (bde gshegs mchod rten), the Stupa of Supreme Enlightenment (byang chub chen poi mchod rten), the Stupa of the Wheel of the Sacred Teachings (chos 1khor mchod rten), the Stupa of Miracles (cho ’phrul mchod rten), the Stupa of the Divine Descent (lha babs mchod rten), the Stupa of Resolving Schism (dbyen bzlums mchod rten), the Stupa of Victory (mam rgyal mchod rten), and the Stupa of Nirvana (my ang das mchod rten).Kongtrul then goes on to describe the dimensions and symbolism of the different elements of the stupa (mchod rten gyi tshad), concluding with an account of certain miraculous stupas which are said not to have been made by human hand, such as the Jnanabimbakaya Stupa (ye shes gzugs kyi sku) of southwest India and the Svayambhu Stupa (rang byung mchod rten) of Nepal, as well as other distinctive models that are mentioned in the Nyingma tradition.In addition to stupas, the hand-held emblems of the deities, such as the vajra and bell (rdo rje drilbu), are also classed among the supreme representa­tions of buddha mind."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"This long section concerning the supreme arts of the body concludes with a discussion on the playing of sacred percussion instruments—various sorts of drums and cymbals (rnga dangsbub chol)—and the choreographic move­ments [stangs stabs) of sacred masked dances. Here, Kongtrul summarizes the writings of Lochen Dharmasri, describing the preparation of the dance arena, the sacred offering dances, the nine dramatic dance moods, the thirteen pro­cedures in the basic dance of the herukas, and the masked dances of exorcism.By contrast, the common physical arts (lus bzopbalpa) are said to include construction of high-rise buildings, such as royal palaces, sports stadia, meet­ing halls, and the residences of ordinary people, as well as ocean-faring ships and small ferry boats, the particular styles of clothing and ornaments suitable for men and women, culinary techniques, palanquins, irrigation turbines, and military contraptions—armor, arrows, bows, swords, artillery, stone- catapults, naval cannons, Greek fire, curved knives, wind machines, siege catapults, and war chariots.The supreme arts of speech (ngaggi bzo gnas) are the techniques of debate, teaching, and composition (rtsod ichad rtsom gsum). They also include the expression of the four melodic contours [nga ro) of sacred chanting (gdangs). Among them:(i) The sustaining note [sthdyi, dren pa) may be of five types, because it may be induced by the vowel A, which is level or neutral; E, which is sharp; I, which is flat; O, which is high; or U, which is low.(2.) The descending note [avarohi, bkugpa), through its undulations, may last for a single beat or multiple beats.(3) The changing note (sancdri, bsgyur ba) occurs due to repetition and includes three types—guttural variation, lingual variation, and nasal variation.(4) The ascending note [drohi, Itengs pa) occurs by raising [the voice an octave], and may be of two sorts—long and short.Kongtrul remarks that the preliminary training in chanting should empha­size three essentials—courage or brilliance [spobs paignad), tempo [dus kyi gnad), and refinement [sbyangspdignad), through which the six defects [skyon drug) and their five causes [rgyu Inga) also should be abandoned. Then, citing Candrasri, he adds that sacred chanting should be performed in six great cer­emonial contexts: offering rites of attainment [sgrub mchod), empowerments (1dbangbskur), consecrations [rabgnas)y anniversary offering ceremonies [dus mchod), funeral rites [gshin don), and elaborate burnt offerings [sbyin sreg). In conclusion, he notes that Sakya Panchens Treatise on Music [Rol mo’i bstanl8 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 19bcos) refers to twelve ancillary modes of chanting, while Candrasrl alludes to twelve modalities of voice pitch.The common vocal arts (ngag bzo phalpa) include the songs performed at secular festivals recounting tales of yaks or wealth and contests of repartee between the sexes, along with the musical accompaniment of flutes, assorted percussion, and string instruments. Rhetoric, comprising informal discursive talks ('belgtam) and formal speeches (gral ’phros), is also included here.The supreme arts of mind {yidgi bzognas mchogtu gyur pa) include study, reflection, and meditation (thos bsam sgom gsum), through which discrimi­native awareness is cultivated, in accordance with the exposition Kongtrul himself offers in Books Six through Eight of The Treasury of Knowledge. By contrast, the common mental arts include the so-called eighteen great topics of knowledge (rigs gnas chen po bco brgyad!), as well as the scrutiny of land (sa gzhi brtagpa), gems and precious metals (rin po che brtagpa), trees and elephants (Ijong shing dangglangpo che brtagpa), treasures (gter brtagpa), horses (rta brtagpa), and men and women (pho mo brtagpa).In addition, there are several treatises on human behavior (lugs kyi bstan bcos) preserved in the Tengyur, along with various listings of the sixty-four crafts (sgyu rtsaldrugcu rtsa bzhi), the thirty designated arts (bzo la sogspar gtogspa sum cu), the eighteen requisites of musical performance (rol mo’i bye brag bco brgyad), the seven tones of the musical scale (glu dbyangs kyi nges pa bdun), and the nine dramatic moods (gurgyi cha by ad dgu). According to Sllapalita, the common mental arts are differentiated on the basis of whether they pertain to wealth or objects, to desire, to religion, or to liberation. More elaborately, Longchen Rabjampa in his Treasury of Wish-fulfilling Gems (Yid bzhin mdzod) identifies the arts of mind with the full diversity of ordinary human activities, which he summarizes in twenty-two aspects, starting with the characteristics of the six classes of sentient beings.MedicineThe Indian medical science of Ayurveda straddles the Brahmanical and Bud­dhist traditions. At its roots are the compilations (samhitd) of two celebrated physicians of antiquity—Caraka and Susruta, but specifically within the Buddhist tradition, there are treatises by Candranandana, Nagarjuna, and Vagbhata, extant in the Tengyur. Among them, Vagbhatas Eight Divisions of Medical Science (Astangahrdayasamhita) has been particularly influential. Within the Tibetan medical tradition, however, primacy is given to the Great Tantra of Secret Instructions on the Eight Branches of the Essence of the Glorious"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"20- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEElixir of Immortality (dPal Idan bdud rtsi snyingpoyan lag brgyad pagsang ba man ngaggi rgyudchenpo). This text is said to have been transmitted in Tibet by the great translator Vairocana during the eighth century, based on teachings he received from Candranandana and Padmasambhava in the lifetime of the great physician Yutok Yonten Gonpo the Elder, and to have been concealed as a “treasure-doctrine” {gter cbos) at Samye, from where it was subsequently revealed by DrapaNgonshe of Dratangon i^July 1038. Subsequently the text was redacted and came to be known as the Four Tantras of Dratang (Grva thang rgyud bzhi). Some contemporary scholars consider the work to have been adapted by Yutok Yonten Gonpo himself from an earlier Bon medical treatise by Chebu Trishe {dpyad bu khri shes), entitled Four Collections of Medical Science (gSo rig 1bum bzhi). Whatever its origin, the Four Tantras of Dratang has become the primary sourcebook for the practice of Buddhist medicine in Tibet, surpassing in its importance the aforementioned Sanskrit treatises.By the fifteenth century, two main schools of interpretation had evolved: theJangpa school, stemming from Rigdzin Namgyal Trakzangpel and includ- ingNamgyal Dorje (fl. sixteenth century); and the Zurkhar lineage, stemming from Wangchuk Drak and including Zurkhar Nyamnyi Dorje (1439-1475). These and other medical lineages were integrated during the seventeenth cen­tury by Sangye Gy atso (1653-1705), the author of the authoritative Blue Beryl (.Baidurya sngon po) treatise. Sangye Gyatso additionally composed further texts on medicine—the Survey o f Medicine (sMangyi khog 'bubs) and his con- .cise appraisal in chapter thirty-four of the Removal o f the Tarnish of Deluded Appearances (’KhrulsnanggYa set), which is an addendum to the White Beryl (.Baidurya dkarpo).Concerning the Four Tantras of Dratang, Kongtrul remarks that the text is “easy to comprehend and well-intentioned. It perfectly reveals the mean­ings of the eight aspects [of medicine] and is great on account of its extensive benefits for all [sentient beings], regardless of their status.”Each of the Four Tantras of Dratang is presented for pedagogic reasons in the form of a graphic arboreal metaphor, comprising roots, stems, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits. On this analogy, the “root” of physiology and pathology gives rise to eighty-eight “leaves,” the “root” of diagnosis to thirty- eight “leaves,” and the “root” of the methods of remedial treatment to ninety- six “leaves.” The “flowers” symbolize the freedom from disease and longevity acquired by those who have properly understood and implemented medical science, while the “fruits” symbolize the endowments of the sacred teachings, wealth, and well-being."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- IIThe promulgation ofthzFour TantrasofDratangis attributed to the hermit sage Vidyajriana, appearing in succession as an emanation of Bhaisajyaguru’s buddha mind, body, attributes, and activities. Among them, the Root Tan- tra (rTsa ba thugs kyi rgyud) describes the tree of medicine, which has three roots—those of physiology [gnas lugs), diagnosis (ngos dzin rtags), and methods of treatment [gso byed thabs). The second is the Exegetical Tantra [bShadpa skuyi rgyud), which concerns the four therapeutic principles (tshul bzhi) outlined below. The third is the Instructional Tantra [Man ngagyon tan rgyud), which concerns the treatment of humoral and internal disorders of the body in general, as well as pediatrics, gynecological diseases, demonic possession, traumas, poisoning, elixirs of rejuvenation in the treatment of old age, the restoration of virility, and the treatment of infertility. The fourth is the Subsequent Tantra [Phyi maphrin las kyi rgyud), which elaborates on the diseases afflicting the patient [gsoyulgyi nad), the remedies [gso byedgnyen po), and the methods of treatment [gso bdi thabs) from the standpoint of medical practice.Kongtrul dwells briefly on the themes of the Subsequent Tantra: All ail­ments are generally classified as either imaginary diseases due to demonic possession [kun brtags gdon), ostensible diseases that suddenly occur [Itar snang ’phrat), absolute diseases that harm the life span [yongsgrub tshe), or dependent diseases due to past actions [gzhan dbangsngon las kyi nad). The remedies that may be applied include medications [sman), external therapies [dpyad), diet [zas) and regimen [spyod Lam). Treatment begins with diag­nostics [brtag thabs) based on pulse palpation [reg pa rtsa) and urinalysis [mthongba chulabrtagpdj.Thzn, keeping in mind nine therapeutic principles [gso tshul mam pa dgu), the following curative methods [bcos thabs) may be applied: eight classes of tranquilizing agents [zhi byedsde tshan brgyad), seven cathartic procedures [sbyongbyed bdun), and six techniques of external therapy [dpyadpa drug).At this juncture, Kongtrul returns to the theoretical basis outlined in the second of the Four Tantras ofDratang, to introduce the four therapeutic prin­ciples [gso bdi tshul bzhi rgyaspar bshadpa), namely, the patient to be treated [gso bydiyul), the remedy [gso byed gnyen po), the method of treatment [gso thabs), and the practicing physician [gso mkhan).Among them, the patient is considered in terms of physiology and pathol­ogy. Under physiology, the text elaborates on the themes of human embry­ology, anatomy, bodily constituents, interconnecting channels, vulnerable points, passageways, and orifices. The defining characteristics of human physiology are the seven bodily constituents; the three impurities; the humors"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"2.2. - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEthat may be harmful; physical activities, distinctions based on sex, age, and constitution; and the signs of physical decay. Pathology, by contrast, concerns the remote and immediate primary causes of disease as well as the second­ary causes of disease, such as the affected sensory activity fields, the covert gathering and overt arising of the three humors, the full manifestation of disease, the inception of disease, its characteristics, and classification accord­ing to primary causes, the sex or age of the patient, and the actual humoral disorders that manifest.The second therapeutic principle concerns the remedy, which may include daily, seasonal, or occasional regimen; dietetics; the prescription of com­pounded medications, which have their distinctive tastes, potencies, and post-digestive tastes; and the techniques of external therapy, whether mild, rough, or rigorous. This section ends with a listing of the various surgical instruments and their functions.The third therapeutic principle concerns suitable methods of treatment, including prophylactics (nad medgnas shing 1tsho ba) and actual treatment (na bagso bar by do). The latter entails effective diagnostics, whether based on genuine understanding, subterfuge, or the so-called four parameters (spang blangmu bzhii brtagpa), followed by the application of general and specific therapeutic principles as well as anabolic and catabolic methods of treatment.The fourth therapeutic principle concerns the practicing physician, who should be distinguished by six primary attributes and avoid the twelve defects of inferior doctors.Minor classical sciencesAmong the five minor sciences (rigsgnas cbung ba), poetics, prosody, lexi­cography, and dramaturgy are all considered subsidiary to Sanskrit gram­mar, while astrology is most closely affiliated with medicine in the Tibetan tradition.AstrologyIn India, the non-Buddhist traditions of astrology (jyotihsastra, skar rtsis) are exemplified by the works of Varahamihira, whose Fivefold Textbook Cal­culation (Pancasiddhantika) exhibits indigenous and Bactrian Greek influ­ences. Buddhist sources on astrology include canonical works, such as the Sutra of the Nucleus of the Sun (Suryagarbhasutra), the Tantra o f the Wheel of Time (Kdlacakra Tantra), Pundarikas Taintless Light (Vimalaprabhd), and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 2.3Vasubandhus Treasury of Phenomenology (Abhidharmakosa). The extensive Tibetan commentarial literature, upon which different calendrical systems are based, includes the following traditions:(1) Sakya, exemplified by the works of Chogyal Phakpa Lodro Gyaltsen (1235-1280) and Yungton Dorjepel (1284-1365);(2) Tsurphu, exemplified by the writings of Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339) and PawoTsuklakTrengwa (1504-1566);(3) Go Lotsáwa Zhonupel (1392-1481), who introduced the practical “error correction” system;(4) the Phugpa system, represented by the writings of Phugpa Lhundrub Gyatso (fl. fifteenth century) and Norzang Gyatso (1423 — 1513);(5) the New Phugpa system, represented by Sangye Gyatso (1653-1705) and Lochen DharmasrI (1654-1717); and(6) the Jonang system, represented by the works of Drakpa Pelzang (fl. sixteenth to seventeenth centuries) and Banda Gelek Gyatso(1844-1904)-Kongtrul begins by observing that “Since this science [of astrology] is unde­luded with respect to the mathematical calculations and circumstances appli­cable in the relative world, it should disclose without error [the appropriate courses or actions] that are to be adopted and those that are to be abandoned ”The Tantra of the Wheel of Time in particular emphasizes the correlation between the microcosmic precision of the inner world (nanggi ngespa) and the precision of the calculations that pertain to the macrocosm—constella­tions and planets. The former refers to the cycles of exhalation and inhalation of breath through the left and right nostrils of the body respectively, setting in motion the five elements—space, wind, fire, water, and earth—in progres­sive and retrograde sequences. Here, it is said that the step index of slow (dal rkang) and fast planetary motion (myur rkang) may be correlated with the calculations applicable to the fire element and the wind element respectively. Each of these minor elemental cycles (’pho chung) is equivalent to three hun­dred and sixty breaths, and when all five elements have been completely set in motion, that is known as a major cycle ('pho chen), equivalent to one thousand eight hundred breaths.Furthermore, it is said that there are six major cycles of breath associated with Aries and the other odd-numbered solar mansions (mi mnyam pai khyim), correlating with the right-side energy channel, and six major cycles of breath associated with Taurus and the other even-numbered solar man­sions (mnyam pai khyim), correlating with the left-side energy channel. Col-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"2-4- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEleccively, the breaths corresponding to the twelve solar mansions number twenty-one thousand six hundred, which is reckoned to be the total number of breaths in a single solar day. In the interval between any two major cycles, the breath is said to re-enter the central energy channel of the subtle body from the left- and right-side channels. This moment correlates with the state of vacuity {stongpargnas) that endures when the cycle of cosmological forma­tion and dissolution has ended, or when consciousness enters naturally into a state of natural inner radiance {rang bzhin ’odgsal) in the interval between the cycle of birth and death.In terms of the macrocosm, when the twelve solar mansions {khyim bcu gnyis) and the twenty-eight constellations {rgyu skar nyer brgyad) become manifest upon the zodiac, they seem to move clockwise, while the Sun and the planetary bodies appear to move anti-clockwise—with the exception of Rahu, the eclipser, who ostensibly moves clockwise, devouring the Moon and the Sun at regular and predictable lunar and solar eclipses.There are three distinct ways of calculating the duration of the day, in terms of the zodiacal or sidereal day {khyim zhag), the calendar day (tithi, tsheszhag), and the solar day {dina, nyin zhag). Among them, the zodiacal day is a measure of time equivalent to one thirtieth of a single sign of the zodiac, there being three hundred and sixty of them in a zodiacal year. The calendar or lunar day is dependent on the phases of the moon, thirty of them corresponding in duration to the lunar month. The solar day comprises twelve two-hour periods, commencing from daybreak {nam langs.pratyusa) at approximately 5AM, and ending with pre-dawn {tho rangs) around 3AM. The solar days are therefore of equal length and correspond to the days of the week, from Mon­day through to Sunday.Kongtrul then examines conventional divisions of time, contrasting the three different months which may traditionally herald the lunar new year; and he shows how there are different views as to whether the waning or waxing half of the lunar month has precedence.When practically applied, there are five aspects of astrological calculation (yan lag Inga/ Inga bsdus) which are to be determined: the seven alternat­ing days of the week, the twenty-seven constellations that demarcate lunar and solar longitude individually, the twenty-seven combined calculations of solar and lunar longitude (yoga, sbyor ba), and the eleven impacts of the lunar month (<karana, byedpa), four of which are “fixed” and seven “transient.” Further calculations then take into account the apparent motion of the five main planetary bodies against the zodiacal band of the constellations, the predictions of solar and lunar eclipses, and the current ascendant conjunction or rising sign {tatkdla, dus sbyor)."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 2.5Outside astrology, subsidiary calculations also have to be made in respect of other systems of divination, especially the Svarodaya system [dbyangs 'char), which derives from Jumla in northwest Nepal, and the system of elemental divination (Jbyungrtsis) which derives from China.PoeticsThe Tibetan appreciation of Sanskrit poetics (kdvya, snyan dngags) is based almost exclusively on Dandin’s Mirror of Poetics (.Kdvyddarsa), in contrast to the works of Bhamaha and Udbhata, which were never translated. Later Tibetan writers also refer to the Sanskrit commentaries on Dandin s work by Ratnašrl and Vagin draklrti. According to the Mirror of Poetics, the body of poetry (.šarira, lus) comprises metrical compositions {padya, tshigs bead), prose. compositions {gadya, Ihugpa), and compositions of mixed verse and prose (misra, spel ma). The first includes detached verse, clustered verses, intricate verse, compound verse, and cantos. Prose, by contrast, includes both narrative and legend; while the versatile or mixed composition may take the form of courtly drama or Campu-style composition and employ any of the four estab­lished literary languages of ancient India—the “refined language of Sanskrit, the common language of Prakrit, the corrupted language of Apabhramsa, and the hybrid language of Misrabhásá.”There are various poetic devices or ornaments [alamkdra, rgyan) that may be employed, including the ten uncommon ornaments of the mellifluous South Indian or Vaidarbha style, and the somewhat harsher and more uneven East Indian or Gauda style. Ksemendras Wish-granting Tree: Narrative of the Bodhisattva (.Bodhisattvávadánakalpalatd, dPag bsam ’khri shing) is extolled as an exemplary text according to the tradition of the easterners, and Súras Garland o f Birth Stories (Jdtakamdla) has a similar status according to the tradition of the southerners.The common ornaments, of which both styles partake, include the thirty- five recognized ornaments of sense {arthdlamkdra, don rgyan), namely, natural description, simile, metaphor, poetic association, repetition, denial, corrobora­tion, contrast, peculiar causation, concise suggestion, hyperbole, poetic fancy, cause, misrepresentation, subtlety, respective ordering of words and meaning, flattery, sentiment, vigor, indirect speech, coincidence, exaltation, obfuscation, double entendre, expressions of distinction, equal pairing, incongruity, artful praise, damning with faint praise, co-mention, illustrative simile, exchange, benediction, conjunction of poetic figures, and underlying intention.In addition, there are phonetic ornaments (.sabddlamkdra, sgra rgyan), including repetition; complex ornaments employing acrostic verse and alliter­"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEation; as well as sixteen “ornaments of enigmatic innuendo” {sodaiaprahelika, gab tshigbcu drug), which are employed to incite laughter.The Mirror of Poetics concludes with a summary of the ten potential defects of poetic composition, which, along with vernacular slang, are to be avoided. These include incoherence, incongruity, tautology, ambiguity, syntactical dis­order, grammatical error, discordance of metrical pause, prosodic deviation, absence of euphonic conjunction, and non-sequitur with regard to place, time, fine arts, the mundane world, scriptural authority, or logical reasoning.ProsodyThe Tibetan understanding of prosody (chandas, sdeb sbyor) derives largely from Ratnakarasantis Precious Source o f Prosody (Chandoratndkara) and its auto-commentary. Prosody includes metric rules governing syllabic quantity (■vrtta) or moric instants (jdti), either of which may be applied in the context of a traditional stanza (sloka) comprising four metrical lines of verse.The former entails the scansion of the syllabic quantity of meters with equal lines [samavrtta, mnyampai vrttta), unequal lines (visamavrtta, mi mnyam pa!i vrtta), or semi-equal lines {ardhavrtta, phyed mnyam pai vrtta). Among them, when the lines are of equal length, Ratnakaraianti holds, in common with earlier traditional Sanskrit sources such as Pirigalas Discourse on Prosody {Chandahsutra), that meter classes may begin with verses comprising only a single syllable and range up to verses of twenty-seven syllables or more. Seven of the most commonly employed meter classes are named after the mythic seven horses that pull the chariot of Aditya—the sun—across the heavens in the course of a solar day, viz. Gayatrl (six syllables), Usnih (seven syllables), Anustubh (eight syllables), Brhatl (nine syllables), Pariktl (ten syllables), Tristubh (eleven syllables), and Jagatl (twelve syllables).By contrast, when lines of verse are divided according to the number of moric instants {jdti), there are three possible meters—the Arya, Vaitalya, and Paingala meters—in which the eight kinds of trimeter (gana, tshogs) that are well known from classical Greek poetry are scanned:[Trimeters] adopting a “heavy” stress in the first, middle, and last syllablesAre [respectively known as]The dactyl (bha), the amphibrach (dza), and the anapaest (sa).Those adopting a Tight” stress [in the first, middle, and last syllables]Are [respectively known as]The bachius (ya), the cretic (ra), and the antibachius (ta)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 27While the molossus (ma) and the tribach (na) respectivelyHave [all three syllables] “heavy” and “light.”The final section of the Precious Source of Prosody concerns certain astonish­ing applications (adbhutaprayoga, ngo mtshar rtogs byed kyi sbyor bd). These relate to the mathematical field of combinatorics—examining possible com­binations or permutations, in response to the basic question posed by Rachel Hall in “The Mathematics of Poetry,” namely, how many ways are there to do or make something. In all, there are six astonishing calculations that can be made:(1) The first is the preparation of a table of metrical variants (prastdra, god tshul), indicating how the number of possible permutations of heavy and light syllables doubles as the number of syllables in a line of verse increases incrementally by one.(2) The second facilitates the process of understanding the general cal­culations applicable to each distinct meter class—as for example in the case of the tabular chart for the ten-syllable meter class, there are 1,024 variant meters, so that the table is nineteen units wide, 2,047 units deep, and comprises 3 8,893 square units in its extent.(3) The third is the so-called “reductionist” calculation (nasta choga) of Piiigala, which shows how any specific meter in a given class can be spontaneously applied and the cadence of its heavy and light syllables easily understood, without the need for setting out all the tabular variations. This is achieved by dividing the number of the specific meter (e.g., the fourteenth permutation of the six-syllable class) by two, repeatedly until there is no remainder. An even quotient indicates that the first syllable will be “light,” and an odd quotient, that it will be “heavy.” This calculation ranks as the earliest known description of the binary numeral system.(4) The fourth, also known as the “grouping of patterns,” is used to calcu­late the specific position of a given meter within its class (uddista), by placing the sequence of heavy and light syllables sequentially below the incremental tabular numbers (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 3 2, 64, etc.). One thus obtains the numbers corresponding to the light syllables in the given meter, ignoring those that correspond to the heavy syllables. The num­bers corresponding to the light syllables should then be tallied, and the number one added to the total. The answer indicates that the given meter is xth among the possible permutations in its meter class."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"(5) The fifth is the formation of a triangular chart of light syllables {yang bai by a ba), which exactly resembles Pascals triangle, enabling one to understand, with regard to a specific meter class, how many permuta­tions have all their syllables “heavy” {Lei ba Jba zhigpa du)> how many have one “light” syllable (gcigyangba du), how many have two “light” syllables {gnyisyang ba du), and so on.(6) The sixth is thtadhva calculation of the exact point of cadence (,adhva, ji tsam gro ba) in a given meter, formed on the basis of a grid compris­ing horizontal and vertical units, which shows the variations of heavy and light syllables and the intermediate units that are left blank.Lastly, there are also three common ways of calculating the number of syllables, the number of moric instants, and the number of heavy and light syllables in a given line of verse.Synonym icsSynonymies (,abhidana, mngon brjod) is a form of lexicography, based on the format of a traditional thesaurus containing lists of homonyms and synonyms appropriate for the composition of Sanskrit poetry {kavya,snyan ngag). Fore­most among the texts of this genre is the Treasury of Amarasimha (.Amarakosa), also known as the Treatise on Nouns and Gender {Namalihganusdsana). The author, Amarasimha, is revered as one of the “nine gems” (navaratna) in the imperial court of Candragupta II (fl. 400 CE), although other sources assign him to the much later period of Vikramaditya (fl. seventh century). The popularity of this thesaurus among exponents of classical Indian poetry is attested by its forty-one Sanskrit commentaries, which are formally listed in Radhakantadevas Sabdakalpadruma lexicon, and about twenty further com­mentaries which exist in manuscript form—some in other Indie languages. Amarasimha is considered to have been a Buddhist, based on the prominence given in the text to synonyms of the word buddha, although others suggest that he may have followed the Jain tradition. Among the commentaries, only one—the Wish-fulfilling Commentary (.Amaratikakamadhenu), composed by the Buddhist scholar Subhuticandra—was translated into Tibetan.The Treasury of Amarasimha contains three chapters (khanda) The first, entitled “Celestial Realms and so forth” (.svargavargadikhanda), is divided into ten sections concerning celestial realms, time, abstract terms, speech, sound, dramaturgy, subterranean abodes, serpents, hells, and water. The second chapter, entitled “Terrestrial Realms and so forth” (bhumivargadikhanda),2,8 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION - 19is divided into ten sections concerning earth, towns, minerals, vegetables, animals, humans, the priestly class, the royal class, the mercantile class, and the laboring class. The third chapter, entitled “General Topics and so forth” (.samanyadikhanda), concerns adjectives, compounds, homonyms (ndndrtha- varga), indeclinables, and gender.At the outset, Kongtrul defines “names” (naman, ming) as signifiers, capable of subsuming multi-syllabic forms as the basis of their designation {prajnaptivastu,gdags gzhi), and indicating the bare essential nature of a given object that is not syntactically bound. They include primary radical names, derived names, proper names, and imputed names. The application of syn­onyms and homonyms in poetry and literary composition requires knowledge of the paradigms of Sanskrit roots and the definitions of the terms expressed in both Sanskrit and Tibetan.DramaturgyAlthough the essential Sanskrit treatise on dramaturgy (ndtya, zlos gar), Bharatas Ndtyasdstra, was not translated into Tibetan, there are a small num­ber of indigenous Tibetan compositions on this subject, which is distinct from the Tibetan operatic tradition. Among the few classical Sanskrit dra­mas that were translated into Tibetan, Harsadevas Utter Delight of the Ndgas (.Nagdnandanamanataka) is contained within the Tengyur.Kongtrul summarizes the significance of drama in the followingparagraph:[Dramatic performances informed by] the science of Indian dra­maturgy are endowed with sentiments or moods which give rise to joy in the people who see and hear [them], because the physi­cal and verbal moods [that they evoke] are repeatedly recreated in the context of a play which captivates the minds [of the audi­ence] . Although [this science] is known to be particularly amazing, the relevant [classical Indian] treatises are not extant in [Tibet,] the Land of Snows, and they are not immediately useful for the purpose of attaining liberation [from cyclic existence]. Even so, all the actions of the bodhisattvas, which are reminiscent of such [dramatic sentiments] and bring delight to sentient beings, should be studied.Dramaturgy is considered by Kongtrul in terms of three topics: the sixty- five aspects of the five sequences of dramatic juncture (samdhyanga, mtshams"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"sbyor gyi yan lag), the sixteen contexts of the four dramatic elements (vrty- ariga, ’jugpaiyan lag), and the thirty-six characteristics of stagecraft (laksana, mtshan nyid).The five dramatic junctures, each of which has multiple aspects, indicate the different phases of a play or plot. Among them, the first is the dramatic juncture of the introduction (mukhasamdhi, sgo’i mtshams sbyor), in which an initial proposal (dri ba) is made. The second is the dramatic juncture of the progression {pratimukhasamdhi, lan gyi sgoi mtshams sbyor), in which a multitude of causes provoke a dialogue of proposals and rejoinders. The third is the dramatic juncture of the development {garbhasamdhi, snyingpo’i mtshams sbyor), in which, following many verbal exchanges exemplified by episodic discussions, the plot is decisively determined. The fourth is the dra­matic juncture of the plot-crisis (vimarsasamdhi, mi bzodpdi mtshams sbyor), in which words that seek to expose the wrongdoings of another backfire, exposing the speakers own wrongdoings, which cannot be tolerated. The fifth is the dramatic juncture of the conclusion (nirvahanasamdhi, nges pa thob byedkyi mtshams sbyor), in which, following many statements expressing hesitation, a singular resolution or positive outcome is obtained.The four dramatic elements are those of dialogue (bhdrati), grandeur {satvati), intimacy {kausiki), and conflict {arabhati), each of which may occur in four distinct dramatic contexts. For example, dialogue may occur in the context of stimulating prologues, preludes, single-act dramas, or farce.The thirty-six characteristics of stagecraft are enumerated as embellish­ment, abbreviation, beauty, declarations, reasons, doubts, objectives, attain­ments, prosperity, evidence, explanations, accomplishments, distinctions, disqualifications, hyperbole, similarity of ideas, versification, observations, suggestion, discrimination, opposition, solecism, conciliation, the bestowal of flower garlands, concord, reproach, presumption, proof, interrogation, mis­taken identity, imagination, the use of disparaging metaphor, agitation, the proclamation of talents, understated achievements, and words of endearment.Plays should also evoke key sentiments {rasa, nyams), including the “senti­ment of extreme anger, the sentiment of anguish caused by desire, the senti­ment of suffering caused by sorrow, the sentiment of astonishment caused by amazement, and other dramatic moods.”Mundane Spiritual PathsHaving examined the major and minor classical sciences, in the final section of Book Six, Part One, Kongtrul considers the advantages and disadvantages30 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 31of worldly spiritual pursuits. In general, the term “philosophical system” (.siddhanta, grub m tha) implies that a specific level of realization may be attained but cannot be transcended. “Although reality (tattva, de nyid) is true, the perspectives of it which are known in the world are uncertain in terms of their truthfulness.” Some of them, such as the views expressed in the so-called “exalted” vehicle (,abhyudayayana, mngon mthoi thegpa), are deemed to be authentic, while others espousing eternalism (nityadrsti, rtag Ita) or nihil­ism (ucchedadrstiy chad Ita) are considered inauthentic. The doxographical penchant of Indian philosophers has already been noted.Among the exponents of the non-Buddhist traditions of ancient India, who are labeled as “extremists” or “forders” because they cannot transcend the temporary props on which they rely and are therefore incapable of tran­scending the sufferings of cyclic existence, there are those classed as nomi­nal extremists (btagspa ba’i mu stegspa), emanational extremists {sprulpai mu stegs pa), and independently minded extremists (rangrgyud kyi mu stegs pa). The first are exemplified by virtuous ascetics (sramana, dge sbyong) who advocate materialism, and even the Vatslputrlya Buddhists, who held the psycho-physical aggregates {skandha,phungpo) to be truly existent. The sec­ond include those extremists who have power to emanate in diverse forms on account of their meditative abilities and supernormal cognitive powers. The third include three types of meditator (dhyayi, bsam gtan pa)—lower, middling and superior—who respectively have the ability to recollect thirty, sixty, and ninety aeons of time, as well as the dialecticians (tdrkika, rtogge pa) who developed the nihilistic and eternalistic philosophical systems.Following the presentation of Chomden Rigpei Raldri, Kongtrul then enumerates twelve distinct categories of nihilistic and eternalistic view that are to be refuted and transcended.1. Mundane MaterialismFirstly, the mundane materialists (lokdyatika, rgyang 'phenpa) are regarded asthe lowest of all those propounding spiritual and philosophical systems; and they are the most severely [deluded] among deluded beings. Let us not even mention [the possibility of them aspiring to] liberation [from cyclic existence]! Since they lack the causal basis for attaining simply a physical body compatible with the exalted realms (svarga, mtho ris) [of gods and humans], the result that they accrue is exclusively compatible with the inferior realms (durgati, ngan 'gro)."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"31- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEThe mundane materialists seek to establish four points: (i) that there is an indiscernible soul or self (<avyaktatma, mi gsal bai bdag) existing when the elements are in their causative or formative state; (2) there is a discernible soul or self (vyaktdtma,gsal bai bdag) existing when the elements are in their resultant or fruitional state; (3) that gods (deva), anguished spirits (p?rta),and denizens of the hells (naraka) do not exist, whereas animistic spirits do exist, as do people and animals; and (4) that the syllogistic concept of an inanimate object such as a “vase” may also be applicable to sentient beings in whom the physical body and the mind are of a single material substance. At the same time, they reject the existence of non-visible causes, denying the existence of past and future lives as well as the processes of past actions, causes and results, the existence of invisible phenomena, the validity of logical inference, and the revered status of the “three precious jewels” (triratna, dkon mchoggsum).2. SdmkhyaThe Sámkhya {grangs can pa) hold that all appraisable objects of knowl­edge may be considered in terms of the “twenty-five categories of reality” (pañcavimsatitattva, de nyid nyer lnga)\\ primal matter (pradhdna, gtso bo); great intelligence (mahat/ buddhi, chenpo/bio); the threefold ego-principle (ahamkdra, nga rgyalgsum); the five quidities of subtle matter (pañcatanmdtra, de tsam lnga)y identified with the potentialities of sound, touch, color, taste, and smell; the five elements {pañcabhüta, Jbyungpo Inga); the five inner sense organs {pañcantarendriya, nang bloi dbangpo Inga); the five motor organs (pañcabahyendriya, phyi las kyi dbangpo Inga), namely, speech, handling, walking, excretion, and reproduction; the mind or mental faculty {manas, yid); and the “soul” {dtma, bdag) or “intelligent self” (purusa, shes riggi skyes bu). These twenty-five categories may also be reduced to primal matter and “intelligent self” the former comprising nature {prakrti, rang bzhin) and the latter the absence of nature (aprakrti, rang bzhin min pa).The “self” is essentially conceived as permanent—an actor or creator (byed pa po) and a consumer (za ba po), devoid of lightness (.sattva, snying stobs), motility [rajas, rdut), and dullness [tamas, munpa), but intelligent with regard to the nature of primary matter. Primal matter, in which all the other twenty- four categories are subsumed, is identified with nature (prakrti, rang bzhin) at the causal level. It is the circumstance in which motility, dullness, and lightness are present in a state of perfect equilibrium. The “soul,” or “cognizant self* being ignorant of the impurity of “nature” which gives rise to the aforemen­tioned modifications, then becomes attached through a series of events, and as long as it enjoys or partakes of the sense objects, it will remain within the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 33cycle of existence. But when it becomes dissatisfied with such enjoyments of the sense objects, through the supernormal cognitive powers associated with meditative concentration, it will directly behold the impurity of this engage­ment in “nature,” and flee away in shame. Separated from this involvement in “nature,” all the modifications produced by “nature” will be reversed in turn, and dissolve into the reality of unmodified nature itself. When the “self” abides in an absolutely radiant state, it is held that it will attain release From the cycle of existence.In addition to the valid cognition ofsense-perception (pratyaksapramdna), accepted by mundane materialists, the Samkhya school also upholds the valid cognition of inference for one’s own sake (svdrthanumana), which entails seven kinds of relation (.saptasambandhana, ’brel ba bdun), and inference for the sake of others {pardrthdnumdna), which may include syllogisms based or not based on yogic experience.3. VaisesikaThe Vaisesika (bye brag pa) hold that knowable phenomena comprise six cat­egories (.satpadartha, tshigdon drug)-, (i) substance (dravya, rdzas) including “self” time, relative direction, space, and mind, along with the primary ele­ments; (2) the nine attributes of the “self” {atmanavaguna, bdaggiyon tan dgu), such as intellect, happiness, sorrow, effort, merit, demerit, and velocity;(3) actions {karma, las)\\ (4) universals {samanya,spyi); (5) particulars {visesa, bye brag) \\ and (6) relational inherence {samavaya, du ba).They hold that these six categories may be appraised by means not only of direct perception and the two kinds of inference but also through Vedic testimony {sabdapramana,sgra byungtshadma). As long as the nine attributes are all inherent in the soul, it will remain trapped within the cycle of existence, performing virtuous and non-virtuous actions. However, once the six catego­ries that pertain to the “self” (purusa,skyes bu) are known, the nine attributes and their roots will be cut off, leaving the self or soul isolated, whereupon it will be released from the cycle of existence.4. NaiydyikaThe Naiyayika {rig pa can pa) uphold the same categorization of phenomena and modes of valid cognition as do the Vaisesika. In addition, any apprais- able object is implicitly classed as partaking of one of twelve possible kinds of entity (bhdva, dngos po), namely, self, body, sense organs, sense objects, understanding, mind, sensory engagement, defiled emotion, rebirth, future lives, suffering, and final emancipation."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"34- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE5. AisvaryaThe Aisvarya {dbangphyugpa) hold that almighty Isvara, through his eight emanational forms, is endowed with eight distinct supernormal powers: subtlety {suksmatd,phra ba), agility (laghutva, yang ba), worthiness of offer­ing {pujya, mchod par os pa), supremacy (isitva, bdagpor gyurpa), dominion (;vasitva, dbang du gyurpa), the power to move freely and obtain anything {prdpti,garyangphyinpa), irresistible will-power {prdkdmya, doddgursgyur ba), and teleportation {yatrakamdvasdyitva, dga mgurgnaspa). As such, he is the creator of the inanimate and living world, the sun and moon, the five elements, and sacrificial offering rites. Mundane beings have no control over their own actions, but by making offerings to Isvara, a non-symbolic knowl­edge and liberation will be attained.6. VaisnavaThe Vaisnava (khyab jugpa) revere the ten incarnations ofVisnu (dasavatara, 'jugpa bcu), and claim that Bhagavan Vasudeva or Krsna is the omniscient, all-seeing creator of all living beings, the conferrer of release from the cycle of existence. At the same time, their view may be considered as either eternalist or nihilist, since some of them hold the nature of mind, which they call the “self” (dtman) or the sacred Vasudeva, to be eternal, free from creation and destruction, and to be without duality (advaita) in terms of substantial exis­tence and non-existence; while others emphasize the nihilist view, expressed at the time when Visnu was on the verge of being defeated in battle with the antigods. In terms of meditation, they engage in the Vaisnavite yoga of the six branches (sadangayoga).Z BrahmanaThe Brahmana (tshangspa ba) maintain that the Vedas are eternal and not cre­ated because they are the recollections of Brahma, and as such they represent a valid form of cognition in their own right. They hold that those who die in battle will be reborn in exalted realms, that negative actions can be cancelled out by bathing in sacred rivers such as the Ganges, and that the whole world and its living organisms were created by Brahma.8. VedantaupanisadikaThe Vedantaupanisadika (rigs byed kyi mtha gsang ba pa) hold that there is a shining immortal person (amrtamayapurusa, ’chimedbdudrtsiiskyes bu) sub­merged within the sphere of terrestrial darkness (prthivitalatamomandala), in which the eternal “self” (atman), “consciousness” {cit), and “being” {sat,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 35dam pa) are all gathered together as a single entity, in the manner of space, and that both the container world and living beings originated through its modifications. When all phenomena are seen to be illusory, at that time, by cultivating the view concerning the creator “self” (kartrkapurusa, byed pa poi skyes bu), they hold that one will awaken from darkness, and, perceiving all things as golden light, one will then be liberated by merging with the immortal person or brahman in a single savor.9. VaiyakaranaThe Grammarians (vaiyakarana, brda sprodpa) hold that the valid cognition of direct perception and inference are not definitive. Instead, the foundations of all knowledge are the treatises on Sanskrit grammar, while the Vedas offer genuine valid cognition. All phenomena are embodiments of sound, and the ultimate among all sounds (.sgra don) is the syllable OM, which is the pure source (brahman, tshangs pa) of sound, free from creation, destruction, and preservation, and entirely without relative direction. Although this sound is eternal and unchanging, it has become sullied by ignorance and consequently appears as form. But when this apparitional aspect is reversed, the pure source of non-apparitional sound is realized to be immortal.10. MlmamsakaThe Mlmamsaka followers of Jaimini (rGyal dpogs pa) hold that there are twelve defining characteristics that apply to ritual sacrifices: (i) validity or authority of Vedic ritual and tradition; (i) general rules on lack ofprecedence and improper implementation of rites; (3) particular rules on the context and sense of specific Vedic rites; (4) the impact of general and particular rules on other ritual practices; (5) the relative sequence of the stages of ritual practices and textual passages; (6) the basic obligations and prescriptions regarding officiatingpriests and ritual materials; (7-8) the general and specific prescrip­tions concerning the transfer from one rite to another, based respectively on the direct injunctions of the Vedic texts and overt or covert signs; (9) the discussion on the adaptation of Vedic hymns, saman, and mantra; (10) the debate concerning the preclusion of secondary rites; (11) the continuous performance of several autonomous rites in sequence; and (12.) the contiguity between primary and secondary rites.The Mlmamsaka accept six modes of valid cognition: direct perception, inference, scriptural testimony, comparison, presumption, and absence or non-entity. They also propound the ideas that (1) since the self (dtman) is the progenitor of the psycho-physical constituents {skandha, phungpo),"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"36 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEpermanence is a condition of mankind (mdnava, shed las sky es)\\ (2) impurity is a condition of the nature of mind; and (3) once it has expired, release from the cycle of existence will occur.11. CdrakaThe followers of Caraka (Caraka, Tsa ra ka pa) are largely similar to the Mlmamsaka (dpyodpa ha), while recognizing that objects may be appraised by means of eight modes of valid cognition, because they differentiate between inferences that refer to the past, present, and future.12. JainismThe Nirgrantha Jains {gcer hu pa) hold that knowable phenomena comprise nine categories (navapadartha, tshigdon dgu): animate substances {jiva, srog Idan), inanimate substances (ajiva, zagpa), controlled actions (samvara, sdom pa), rejuvenation (nirjara, nges par dga), bondage (bandha, \\ching), deeds (karma, las), negative acts (papa, sdigpa), merits (punya, bsodnams), and release (moksa, tharpa). Since animate substances include the elementary life-forms of earth, water, wood, fire, and wind, as well as the four classes of living creatures, namely, animalcules, ants, bees, and human beings, they hold that earth and other elements are living organisms, and that consequently the excavation of land and construction of monastic gardens is a causal basis of negativity.The path followed by Nirgrantha Jains entails the observance of controlled actions, the vows of ascetic restraint, and the cultivation of knowledge, each of which has five aspects, as well as the thirteen modes of conduct, and various austerities designed to terminate the impact of past actions. They hold that by subjecting the physical body to austerities, the knots that bind the mind are destroyed, and they are known to esteem three hundred and sixty-three modes of ascetic discipline, including the control of the three “staffs” of body, speech, and mind (tridandin, dbyu gu gsum pa) and the “possession of only a tree” (palasin, lo ma can).The objects that may be appraised by means of the three modes of valid cognition—direct perception, inference, and scriptural authority—include the three times and the six substances (animate things, matter, time, space, merit, and negativity), along with the aforementioned nine categories of phe­nomena, and the nine kinds of animate substance.The fruit of the practice of Jainism is that, on bringing an end to the impact of past actions, the animate abode known as the “aggregate of wo rids” (lokasamgraha, jigrten dus pa) will still remain, present at the summit of the three world-systems, and that even when one has been released from cyclic"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 37existence, the release that is attained will still be a positive state of being, “pure and resembling an upturned parasol, fragrantly scented and pleasant, extend­ing to a distance of four million five hundred thousand fathoms.”Barbarous ViewsIn addition to those nihilistic and eternalistic non-Buddhist systems of Indian philosophy, Kongtrul briefly alludes to the inappropriate practices advocated by so-called barbarians (mleccha, kla klo), such as the ritual killing of animals in Islam, the amoral acts of killing condoned by the Ajlvaka of ancient India and the unreformed Bon of Tibet, as well as Daoist numerology and Chinese Confucianism.The Exalted VehicleAt this juncture, Kongtrul differentiates between two modes of spiritual practice that are advantageous, the vehicle that aspires to the exalted realms (abhyudaya) and the level of definitive excellence (nihsreyasa, nges legs kyigo 'phang), noting that the former brings “immediate release from the suffer­ings [of rebirth] in the three inferior realms in which the happiness of gods and humans is accrued by means of a ripening [of virtuous past actions] in conformity with their [appropriate] causes.” The latter, by contrast, is the result attained through practice of the Buddhist teachings, bringing “release, passing beyond sorrow and into nirvana, which is a perpetual liberation from the sufferings of all [classes of beings] within cyclic existence.”From the perspective of gradual spiritual development, initially one should become secure in the vehicle of the exalted realms, and then subsequently aim to attain the conclusive path of definitive excellence. However, faith and discriminative awareness are both regarded as common prerequisites for the attainment of these two goals. This is because “in the case of the exalted realms, when one is motivated principally by the faith born of conviction in the results of past actions, among the three kinds of faith, one can effectively adopt virtuous actions and reject negative actions.” Also, it is because, “in the case of the attainment of definitive excellence, the roots of cyclic existence are severed by means of discriminative awareness that is non-discursive with respect to the three spheres of subject, object, and their interaction.”Mundane vehicle o f gods and humansThe vehicle of the exalted realms itself has two aspects—the mundane vehicle of gods and humans (,devamanusyayana, lha m ii thegpa) and the more refined"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"38 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEvehicle of Brahma {brahmdyana, tshangspai thegpa). The former is defined by Kongtrul as the means of attaining an exalted physical form through fear of rebirth in the inferior realms (durgati, ngan song) and by striving for the result of happiness, which is associated with the higher realms (svarga, mtho ris). This is a spiritual path suited for persons of inferior ability, relying on protection from fear and auspicious aspirational prayers. It is the path influ­enced by the impact of past actions, which conforms to the practice of the ten virtuous actions (dasakusala, dge ba bcu) but which is not yet apprehended by means of meditative concentration (dhyana, bsam gtan).The correct view maintained by followers of this vehicle is the conviction that there are other worlds, and that past actions do have causes and results. In conduct, ten non-virtuous actions are to be continuously rejected and ten virtuous actions actively pursued. Consequently, those who adopt this course will traverse the various realms of the world-system of desire as far as the Paranirmitavasavartin realm, experiencing the conclusive happiness of the human beings of the four continents and the six species of Kama divinities.Vehicle o f BrahmaThe vehicle of Brahma requires not only ethical observances but the cultiva­tion of the four meditative concentrations associated with the world-system of form (rupadhatu, gzugs khams), and the four meditative absorptions (samapatti, snyoms jug) associated with the world-system of formlessness [arupyadhatu, gzugs medkhams).Calm abiding and higher insightIn preparing for the attainment of the first meditative concentration, the beginner is required to cultivate the experiences of calm abiding (.samatha, gzhignas) and higher insight (vipasyana, lhag mthong). In the former case, meditative stability (.samadhi, ting nge dzin) will be secured by means of nine techniques: mental placement, perpetual placement, integrated place­ment, intensified placement, control, calmness, quiescence, onc-pointedness, and meditative equipoise that is effortlessly free from all mental dullness and agitation. Consequently, a state of happiness, characterized by both physical and mental refinement will be experienced.In higher insight, one cultivates a continual alertness that accords with six modes of attention [sadmanaskara,yid la byedpa drug), namely, attention that is aware of individual characteristics, attention that arises through resolve, attention that arises through isolation, attention imbued with encompass­ing joy, attention imbued with scrutiny, and attention imbued with perfected"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 39application. Consequently, even the subtlest and most minute dissonant men­tal states associated with the world system of desire will be overcome. For this reason, these modes of higher insight are equivalent to the spiritual realizations attained by pious attendants, hermit buddhas, and mundane gods and humans.Attainments o f thefour meditative concentrationsFollowing these preparations, the actual attainment (maula, dngos gzhi) of the four successive meditative concentrations will ensue. Among them, the first meditative concentration is endowed with ideation, scrutiny, joy, bliss, and one-pointed mind. The second meditative concentration is endowed with intense inner clarity, joy, and bliss arising from meditative stability, and con­tinuous meditative stability (.samadhisthanga, tingnge dzingnas kyiyan lag). The third meditative concentration is endowed with recollection, alertness, equanimity, bliss in which joy has been renounced, and continuous meditative stability. Finally, the fourth meditative concentration is endowed with purity of recollection, purity of equanimity, equanimity of feelings, and continuous meditative stability.The result attained by those who have mastered the four meditative con­centrations is rebirth in the twelve successive realms of the world-system of form, three of which are each attained through the lesser, mediocre, and greater realizations of the four successive meditative concentrations.Attainments of the four meditative absorptionsHaving traversed the world-system of form, the practitioner may then focus on the four successive meditative absorptions associated with the world sys­tem of formlessness, namely, the meditative absorption of the sensory activity field of infinite space (,dkasdnantydyatana, nam mkha mtha yas skye mched kyi snyoms jug), the meditative absorption of the sensory activity field of infinite consciousness (vijndndntydyatana, mam shes mtha’yas skye mched kyi snyoms jug), the meditative absorption of the sensory activity field of nothing-at-all (akimcanydyatana, ciyang medpa’i skye mched kyi snyoms jug), and the meditative absorption of neither perception nor non-perception (;naivasamjndnasamjndyatana, du shes med mingyi snyoms jug). This is the conclusive perfection of the path that leads to the summit of mundane cyclic existence (bhavdgra, sridpa’i rtse).Kongtrul adds that the rebirth in the four levels of the world-system of formlessness is distinguished on the basis of their superior and inferior degrees of meditative absorption, the duration of the life span enjoyed by their inhab­itants, and other hierarchical aspects."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"40~ THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEConclusionThe distinctive attributes acquired by those who have successively attained the world-systems of form and formlessness include the four immeasurable aspirations (caturaprameya, tshadmed bzhi)—loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity—along with five supernormal cognitive pow­ers {pancâbhijnâ, mngon shes Inga)—clairvoyance, clairaudience, knowledge of the minds of others, recollection of past lives, and knowledge of death and rebirth.All those who would enter upon the Buddhist vehicles are initially required to cultivate these meditative stabilities and attributes, familiarizing themselves with the distinctive features of the higher realms. In particular, the conclusive meditative absorption of cessation (nirodhasamâpatti, gog pai snyoms jug) is obtained dependent on the mind that has successfully reached the summit of existence (bhavâgra, sridpa’i rtse) by cultivating the fourth meditative concentration and the meditative absorption of neither perception nor non-perception. It is for this reason that the higher realms are objectives of the pious attendants and hermit buddhas, who follow the Lesser Vehicle of Buddhism, as well as of non-Buddhist sages and philosophi­cal extremists.Part Tw o: Bud d h ist Ph eno m enolog yIn the second part of Book Six, Kongtrul examines the various traditions of phenomenology, corresponding to the three promulgations of the Buddhist teachings. As a preamble to the main discussion, he begins by differentiating Buddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical systems according to their view, meditation, conduct, and result:The “view” (Ita ba) on the basis of which one embarks upon any philosophical and spiritual system is differentiated according to whether it accepts or does not accept the four hallmarks [of imper­manence, suffering, selflessness, and quiescent nirvana], which are indicative of the Buddhist transmitted teachings.The “meditation” (sgom pa) is differentiated on the basis of whether it acts or does not act as an antidote for [attachment to] the summit of existence.“Conduct” (spyod pa) is differentiated on the basis of whether it renounces or does not renounce die two extremes of self-mor­tification and over-indulgence."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 41Release [from cyclic existence], which is the “result,” is differ­entiated on the basis of whether it upholds or does not uphold the extraordinary truth of the cessation [of suffering], which is [completely] free from the corruption [of past actions] that are to be renounced.Then, with regard to the actual Buddhist teachings, although many diverse classifications have been attempted, the hierarchy of the four spiritual and philosophical systems (grub mtha bzhi) is the one that gained greatest cur­rency in the Indo-Tibetan tradition. These comprise the Vaibhasika (bye brag smra ba), the Sautrantika (mdo sdepa), the Yogacarin (rnal }byor spyodpa) and the Madhyamika (dbu ma pa) systems—the first two being maintained by followers of the Lesser Vehicle (hinaydnin, thegdman pa), and the last two by followers of the Greater Vehicle (mahaydnin, thegchen pa).Phenom enological structuresOnce the causal basis of cyclic existence has been abandoned, in order that release from cyclic existence might be attained, it will be essential to establish the defining characteristics of all objects of knowledge by means of discrimina­tive awareness (prajna, shes rab), which thoroughly discerns all phenomena. This is effected by structuring all phenomena in terms of the five psycho­physical aggregates (pancaskandha, phung po Inga), the eighteen sensory bases (astadasadhatu, khams bco brgyad), the twelve sensory activity fields (dvadaiayatana, skye mched bcugnyis), and the processes of dependent origi­nation [pratityasamutpada, rten cing ’brel bar ’byung ba), which collectively function as an antidote for the deluded apprehension of wholeness.These structures of Buddhist phenomenology—the psycho-physical aggregates, sensory bases, and sensory activity fields—may be differently understood in the context of the three promulgations of the Buddhist teach­ings, exemplified in the “Higher Abhidharma” tradition (mngonpagongmai lugs) of Asanga, the “Lower Abhidharma” tradition (mngon pa og ma) of Vasubandhu, and the “third turning” expositions of Maitreya, Taranatha and so forth.Phenomenological structures according to the tradition o f Higher AbhidharmaAccording to the system of Higher Abhidharma, the psycho-physical con­tinuum that constitutes an individual person or living being comprises five aggregates (skandha, phung po), which are so called because they “function"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"41 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEheaps of multiple phenomena, partaking of a common class, or because they bundle together all the distinctive attributes of their respective classes.” They are the aggregate of physical forms {rupaskandhay gzugs kyi phung po)y the aggregate of feelings (vedanaskandha, tshor bai phungpo), the aggregate of perceptions (.samjndskandha, dusheskyi phungpo), the aggregate of formative predispositions (samskaraskandha, du byedkyiphungpo), and the aggregate of consciousness (vijnanaskandha, mam par shes pai phungpo).Aggregate of physicalformsThe aggregate of physical forms includes primary matter (heturupa, rgyui gzugs)y derivative matter {phalarupa, Jbras buigzugs), and forms associated with the sensory activity field of phenomena (dharmayatanarupa, choskyiskye mched pai gzugs). Primary matter refers to the four elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—which are known through their respective properties—solid­ity, cohesion, warmth, and motion. Derivative matter includes the five sense organs—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body—in their subde or sensitive and gross material aspects, as well as the corresponding five sense objects—visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tangibles.There are intricate sub-classifications. For example, in the case of visible forms {rupaygzugs), twenty-five aspects have been enumerated individually: blueness, yellowness, redness, whiteness, longness, shortness, squareness, roundness, subde particles, coarse particles, evenness, unevenness, highness, lowness, shadow, sun, light, darkness, cloud, smoke, dust, mist, atmospheric forms, apperceived but intangible forms, and monochrome sky. These can then be reduced to four categories: visual forms differentiated on the basis of color, shape, appearance, and circumstances.There are eleven recognized categories of sound (sabda, sgra), compris­ing pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sounds, as well as sounds produced by the primary elements, which may either be organic, such as human sounds; inorganic, such as rusding trees; or both, such as the sound of a musical instru­ment. Then there are sounds that are known in the world, demonstrated by accomplished spiritual masters, or imagined; and those that are designated as originating from sublime beings (dryay phagspa) and from those who are not sublime. These eleven categories may then be reduced to three: sounds differentiated on the basis of the feelings they evoke, i.e., pleasant, unpleas­ant, and neutral sounds; sounds differentiated on the basis of whether they are produced organically or inorganically; and sounds differentiated on the basis of imputed symbols and conventional terms.There are six recognized categories of odor {gandhay dri) \\ fragrant, strong,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 43and neutral odors that are differentiated on the basis of the feelings they evoke, along with natural, compounded and developmental odors that are differentiated on the basis of circumstances. In the case of taste (rasa, ro), there are twelve types: sweet, astringent, bitter, sour, spicy, salty, pleasant, unpleas­ant, neutral, natural, compounded, and modified. Then, there are twenty-two types of tangible sensation (.sprastavya, regbya): softness, roughness, lightness, heaviness, suppleness or flexibility, languidness, tension, warmth, coldness, hunger, thirst, satisfaction, strength, weakness, faintness, itchiness, putre­faction, sickness, aging, death, fatigue, rest, and energy. The latter may be reduced to three categories: tangible sensations differentiated on the basis of mutual contact or interaction, tangible sensations differentiated on the basis of whether the outer and inner elements are balanced or imbalanced, and tangible sensations differentiated on the basis of circumstances.As for forms associated with the sensory activity field of phenomena, the “sensory activity field of phenomena” (dharmayatana, chos kyi skye mched) refers to the appearances of physical form that are exclusively within the range of the sense faculty of the mind (;mana indriya, yid kyi dbangpo), and are therefore neither revealed to visual consciousness nor obstructed by tangible objects. There are recognized to be five types of form within this range:(1) forms that are extremely small and concentrated, such as indivisible atomic particles, which appear as the objects of mental consciousness;(2) forms that are widespread and spacious, including atmospheric phe­nomena which appear to mental consciousness but not to visual consciousness;(3) forms that derive from genuine meditative commitment, including uninterrupted forms indicative of spiritual progress. These are also called unon-apperceived forms” (avijnaptirupa, mam par rigbyed ma yin pa’i gzugs) because they are imperceptible to those with different motivations.(4) forms that are imagined, including the skeleton that is visualized while practicing the meditative stability on impure phenomena; and(5) forms that derive from supernormal powers, including the form of the earth element that derives from the meditative stability of the all- consuming earth element (zadparsa’i tingnge ’dzin). The latter are also called “images that appear within the perceptual range of meditative stability” (tingnge ’dzingyispyodyulgzugs brnyan).In addition, physical forms may be classified as revealed and obstructed (sanidarsanasapratigha, bstan yod thogs bcas), unrevealed and obstructed"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"4 4- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(iinidarsanasapratigha, bstan medthogsbcas), or unrevealed and unobstructed (,anidarsanapratigha, mod thogs med)> and so forth.Aggregate of feelingsThe aggregate of feelings, when considered according to its essential nature, is sixfold, comprising feelings that are conditioned by sensory contact that is visually, audibly, nasally, lingually, tangibly, or mentally compounded. In addition, there are also six kinds of feelings that are differentiated according to their affinity (.sabhdga, mtshungs Idan):(1) physical feelings or sensations originating in affinity with the five types of sensory consciousness;(2) mental feelings originating in affinity with mental consciousness;(3) disturbed feelings originating in affinity with attachment to self;(4) undisturbed feelings acting as an actual antidote for the aforemen­tioned attachment;(5) feelings associated with greed, originating in affinity with attachment to the objects of the five senses; and(6) feelings dependent on renunciation which function as an actual anti­dote for the aforementioned greed.There is also a further fivefold classification, comprising feelings of sensual happiness, which has affinity with the five types of sensory consciousness; mental happiness, which has affinity with mental consciousness; physical pain, which has affinity with the five types of sensory consciousness; mental unhappiness, which has affinity with mental consciousness; and equanimity, which is free from both happiness and sorrow.Aggregate of perceptionsThe aggregate of perceptions, when considered according to its essential nature, is also sixfold, including perceptions conditioned by sensory contact that is either visually, audibly, nasally, lingually, tangibly, or mentally com­pounded. There are also six categories of perception that are differentiated according to their circumstances or objects of reference:(1) non-symbolic perceptions (<animittasamjna, mtshan ma m edpai ’du shes), coincidental with meditative equipoise in reality, and those compounded by the levels of meditative equipoise at the summit of existence within the formless realms;(2) symbolic perceptions (sanimittasamjnd:, mtshan ma dangbcaspai du"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 45shes), comprising all perceptions compounded by the three world sys­tems, excluding those [belonging to the following categories];(3) limited perceptions (parittasamjnd, chungngu’i ’du shes), compounded by the world system of desire;(4) extensive perceptions (mahadgatasamjňd, chen po’i du shes), com­pounded by the word-system of form;(5) infinite perceptions (aprameyasamjňd, tshad medpai du shes), com­pounded by the sensory activity fields of infinite space and infinite consciousness;(6) the perception of nothing-at-all (akimcanyasamjnd, ci yang med pa’i du shes), compounded by the level of nothing-at-all.Aggregate o f formative predispositionsThe aggregate of formative predispositions refers to the mental processes whereby the mind, through an accumulation or combination of various conditions, directly interacts with its objects or points of reference and is driven or motivated towards diverse objects. In terms of their essential nature, these include formative predispositions originating from sensory contact that is visually, audibly, nasally, lingually, tangibly, or mentally com­pounded. Then, when differentiated according to their circumstances, they include formative predispositions which are either associated with the mind (cittaprayuktasamskdra, sems dang mtshungs Idan gyi ’du byed) or disassoci­ated with the mind (cittaviprayuktasamskdra, mtshungs par Idan pa ma yin pa’i ’du byed).Formative predispositions associated with the mindSince this class of formative predispositions is identified with the various men­tal states, Kongtrul begins this long section by examining the defining char­acteristics of mind (citta, sems) and its mental states (caitasika, sems byung). Here, mind comprises either eight or six modes of consciousness (vijňdnakdya, mam par shes pa’i tshogs), and it objectively refers to the essential nature of its corresponding sense-data—visual form, sound, and so forth. Mental states, on the other hand, objectively refer to the distinguishing characteristics of a given sense datum, such as states of happiness and suffering, or moods that are pleasant and unpleasant. In all, the concomitance of mental states with mind is fivefold (pancasamprayuktaka, mtshungs Idan mam pa Inga), in that they are said to share a concomitance of location or support [gnassam rten), of objective referent (dmigspa), of sensum (mam pa), of time (dus), and of substance (rdzas). However, as Kongtrul observes, there is no unanimity of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"46 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEopinion as to whether mind and its mental states are of a single substance or different. Santaraksita and Dharmaklrti appear to hold the former view, and Candraklrti the latter. Asaiiga suggests that there would be six defects if mind and mental states were identical in substance, while ambiguously stating that this difference is ascertained with respect to material rather than immaterial phenomena.In addition, mental states may be classified in term ofwhether they are sub­stantial existents (<dravyatah, rdzas yod) or imputed existents {prajnaptitah, btags yod). According to Asaiiga s interpretation, only autonomy (svatantra, mngrkya thubpa) can determine whether things are substantially existent—an autonomous object being something that arises as an intrinsic object-universal (svdrthasdmdnya, khoi don spyi), without dependence on the arising of an extraneous object-universal (anydrthasdmdnya,gzhangyidon spyi). Similarly, in his view, only imputation on the basis of its parts can determine whether an object is an imputed existent; that is to say, existents may be acceptably imputed through their partial or incomplete presence because they are the fragments of whole phenomena which are the basis of their designation. In accordance with these criteria, twenty-two of the following fifty-one mental states are classed as substantial existents and the remaining twenty-nine as imputed existents.Classification o f mental statesKongtrul points out that although various other classifications are found, the prevailing view of Asaiiga is that the mental states are fifty-one in number and divided into the following six categories:(i) The five ever-present mental states (.sarvatraga, kun gro) comprise feel­ing (vedana, tshor ba), perception (.samjna, du shes), volition (cetana, semspa), contact (sparia, regpa), and attention (manaskara,yidbyed). They are designated as “ever-present” because they shadow all aspects of consciousness assumed by the central mind.(i) The five object-determining mental states (visayaniyata,yulnges) com­prise will (chanda, dun pa), resolve {adhimoksa, mos pa), mindfulness (smrti, dran pa), meditative stability {samadbi, tingnge dzin), and discriminative awareness (prajna, shes rab).

They also, in conjunction with four of the six primary dissonant mental states (desire, pride, ignorance, and wrong views) and six of the twenty subsidiary dissonant mental states (distraction, carelessness, mental agitation, faithless­ness, indolence, and dullness), arise within the periphery of the dissonant mental consciousness (klistamanovijndna, nyon yid kyi mam par shes pa)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"48 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEIn the case of the six modes of engaged consciousness (pravrttivijndna, jug pai mam shes), there are two distinct mental processes entailing either involuntary or voluntary perception. Only the five ever-present mental states arise within the periphery of an involuntary or passive consciousness; but, in the case of voluntary perception, when the consciousnesses of the five senses (pancadvdravijnana, sgo Inga mam shes) willingly engage in virtuous actions, there are twenty-three mental states which may arise, and another twenty-five when they are engaged in defiled actions, or twelve when they are engaged in ethically unspecified or indeterminate actions. In addition, twenty-five of these mental states may arise within the periphery of mental consciousness (;manovijnana) when it is engaged in virtuous actions, forty when it is engaged in defiled actions, but only fourteen when it is engaged in ethically unspecified or indeterminate actions.Formative predispositions disassociated with the mindThe formative predispositions that are disassociated with the mind are so called because they do not share the five concomitant characteristics when the mind engages with its object of reference. Even so, they are designated as “formative predispositions” (samskdra, du byed) because they partake of their distinctive predisposed circumstances. In the view of Asaiiga, they number twenty-three: acquisition (prdpti, thob pa), meditative absorption devoid of perception (asamjnisamdpatti, du shes m edpai snyoms 'jug), meditative absorption of cessation (nirodhasamapatti, ’gogpa’isnyoms’jug), the state of non-perception (dsamjnika, ’du shes med pa), the faculty of the life-force (jivitendriya, sroggi dbangpo), homogeneity of sensory experience (nikdyasabhdga, rigs mthun pa), birth (jati, skye ba), aging (jard, rga ba), duration [sthiti, gnas), imper­manence (anityata, mi rtagpa), nominal clusters (namakdya, minggi tshogs), phrasal clusters (padakaya, tshiggi tshogs), syllabic clusters (vyanjanakdya, yige’i tshogs), the status of an ordinary individual (prthagjanatva, so so’i skye bo), engagement (pravrtti, ’jugpa), distinctive regularity (pratiniyama, so sor ngespa), connection (yoga, ’byor ’brelba), rapidity (java, mgyogspa), sequence (anukrama,go rim), time (kdla, dus), location (desa,yut), number (samkhyd, grangs), and grouping (.sdmagri, tshogs pa).Aggregate of consciousnessThe aggregate of consciousness includes “mind” (citta, sems), “mentation” (manas, yid), and “consciousness” (vijnana, mam par shes pa), which cor­relate with either the “six modes” of consciousness or the “eight modes” of consciousness. In the latter case, these three terms correspond respectively to"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 49the substratum consciousness, the dissonant mental consciousness, and the six modes of engaged consciousness.Substratum consciousnessThe substratum consciousness is the unobscured and unspecified conscious­ness, functioning as the ground from which propensities are distributed, cognizing the essential nature of its objects dependent on both maturational (;vipdkabhdga, mam smingyi cha) and seminal aspects (bijabhaga, sa bongyi cha). The former are the causal conditions giving rise to distinct fruitional phenomena, while the latter are the latent propensities atemporally present within the substratum.The workings of the substratum consciousness are demonstrated in those sense data which, with reference to the psycho-physical aggregates and the external physical world, are invisible and fractional, and, therefore, barely capable of appearing objectively. Such sensa are associated with the five ever­present mental states and particularly with equanimity (upeksa, btang snyoms), and they are essentially unobscured by dissonant mental states, ethically inde­terminate, and uninterrupted for the duration of cyclic existence. In addi­tion, the seminal aspect of the substratum consciousness is demonstrable in propensities which are capable of regenerating the content of the substratum itself, while the maturational aspect is demonstrable in maturational phe­nomena that have already been ripened or projected by means of corrupt past actions.The sense data associated with the substratum consciousness include the aggregates of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and con­sciousness, which are subtle, invisible to engaged sensory consciousness, and imprecisely ascertained. The substratum s process of engagement occurs con­tinuously through a succession of lives, expiring at the moment of death and reviving through the propensities of past actions at the moment of rebirth. Although this process takes place exclusively in association with the five ever­present mental states, it is concurrent with the dissonant mental conscious­ness, the mental consciousness, or all the other seven modes of consciousness. By contrast, the reversal of the substratum consciousness occurs when the status of either an arhat or non-residual nirvana has been attained and the adamantine meditative stability (vajropamasamadhi, rdo rje Ita bui ting nge dzin) has arisen, transforming consciousness into the mirror-like pristine cognition (,adarsajnana, me long Ita bui ye shes).Kongtrul at this point elaborates on the distribution of propensities (:vdsand, bag chags) within the substratum consciousness, pointing out that"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"50- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEthis occurs because the substratum has a stable continuum, is ethically unspec­ified, and lacks the well-defined clarity of the six modes of engaged conscious­ness, or the clarity and limitations of the dissonant mental consciousness. This distribution of propensities occurs on the level of an individuals mental continuum, where the substratum is concurrent with the other seven modes of consciousness that act as distributors, and it cannot occur when these are apart because they and their associated mental states have the function of localizing the propensities. Following this act of distribution, the production and cessation of propensities continues so that even if the mental phenomena that originally distributed them cease to exist, the stream of propensities will still continue to adhere to the substratum. So it is that the causal propensities (,nisyandavasana, rgyu mthun gyi bag chags) have an extraordinary capacity to homogeneously regenerate their own locus, which is the substratum itself; whereas the maturational propensities (vipdkavdsand, mam par sminpa’i bag chags) are new imprints, generating distinctly different phenomena or newly acquired propensities.The term seed (bija,sa bon), which is used synonymously with “propensity,” may convey six distinct shades of meaning: external seeds such as those of the sal tree; internal seeds present in the substratum; the two kinds of invis­ible and unspecified seeds; the relative seeds comprising objects of external, conventional appearance; and the absolute seed, which is the support for all the seeds that can be detected internally. In addition, these seeds display five natural properties {prakrti, rang bzhin):(i) They originate co-emergently, intending to produce their appropriate results in an immediate manner, uninterrupted by the instant when they perish, which immediately follows their production, or by any other intervening instant of time.(i) They originate continuously, until their continuum is destroyed by an appropriate antidote.(3) They originate exclusively with distinctive regularity.(4) They originate through proximate conditions.(5) They originate indirectly from beginningless seeds.It is for these reasons that an intrinsic result may be established as being present in its seed, or a result may be established on the basis of its seed.According to Asanga, Asvabhava, and others, such seeds or propensities are neither identical nor different in substance to the unspecified substra­tum consciousness. While they are merely propensities they do not appear diversified, but when their appropriate ripening occurs, they themselves are"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 51transformed into the diversity of phenomena. In the Greater Vehicle, this process is called the “profound and subtle dependent origination” (zab cing phra bai rten ’brel). Indeed, Dharmapala observes that “if one could think of all the classes of the propensities one would be well acquainted with begin- ningless cyclic existence!”Dissonant mental consciousnessThe dissonant mental consciousness cognizes the bare objects of the substra­tum and has the capacity to initiate extremely agitated mental activity. As long as the sublime path of the buddhas has not been attained, it refers objectively to the substratum consciousness, obscured by the dissonant mental states of perpetual egotism, and it is ethically unspecified. Its associated mental states include egotistical delusion, view, attachment, and pride, along with the aforementioned five “ever-present” mental states.The dissonant mental consciousness initiates the processes of mental consciousness (manovijndna,yid shes) and functions as the locus that binds the six modes of engaged consciousness to substantialist views and corrupt states, ensuring that seeds are implanted in the substratum. In ordinary mun­dane circumstances, it refers objectively to the substratum consciousness and engages routinely with the six modes of engaged consciousness. It still persists while a bodhisattva or pious attendant is traversing the four paths of learn­ing (.saiksamdrga) and undertaking post-meditative activities, even though subject to reversal during this process, but it finally ceases to exist during the meditative equipoise of sublime arhats and the meditative absorption of ces­sation, when its most subtle latent tendencies are reversed, in tandem with the reversal of the substratum consciousness itself. On the buddha level, it is then transformed into the conclusivepristine cognition of sameness (.samatdjndna, my am nyid kyi ye shes).Six modes of engaged consciousnessThe six modes of engaged consciousness are the processes through which consciousness becomes localized on account of its ability to cognize dissimi­lar sense objects. There are six aspects: visual consciousness (caksurvijndna, miggi rnam par shes pa), auditory consciousness (.srotravijndna, m ai mam par shes pa), olfactory consciousness (ghrdnavijnana, snai rnam par shes pa), gustatory consciousness {jihvdvijnana, Icei rnam par shes pa), tactile con­sciousness (kayavijndna, lus kyi mam par shes pa), and mental consciousness (;manovijndna, yid kyi rnam par shes pa).Each of these six modes of engaged consciousness arises dependent on"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"four conditions. For example, in the case of visual consciousness, the refer­ential condition (,alambanapratyaya, dmigs pai rkyen) comprises the visual forms that appear as if they were external to itself. The predominant condition (adhipatipratyaya, bdag rkyen) comprises the sense organs of the eyes. The immediate condition (.sa.manantara.pmty ay a, dema thagrkyen) comprises an uninterrupted preceding moment of mental attention. The causal condition (hetupratyaya, rgyui rkyen) comprises the visual consciousness that arises, dependent on the propensities of the substratum, endowed with the charac­teristic of apperceiving individual visual forms.In the case of mental consciousness, the referential condition comprises the knowable phenomena which appear as if they were different to itself; the predominant condition comprises, with one special exception, the dis­sonant mental consciousness; the immediate condition is the mental activity preceding it; and the causal condition is the mental consciousness that arises, dependent on the propensities of the substratum, endowed with the charac­teristic of apperceiving individual mental phenomena.The “special exception” {dmigsgsat) is that the predominant condition of the uncorrupted pristine cognition of sublime minds is its necessity to con­tinue functioning by means of mentation immediately after the six modes of engaged consciousness have been reversed.The functions (kdritrakarma, byed las) of these six modes of engaged con­sciousness are to facilitate the apprehension of their respective sense objects. Among them, the five modes of sensory consciousness {sgo Inga) engage in virtuous and non-virtuous actions, pursuing positive and negative motiva­tions, and they consequently engage with the corresponding results which are imbued with suffering or the absence of suffering. On the other hand, mental consciousness only has the functions of engaging with virtuous or non-virtuous phenomena, and otherwise does not in itself engage with those consequential results. Mental consciousness originates without interruption in all circumstances, except the following five which are characterized by an absence of mind: rebirth as a deity devoid of perception in the world- system of formlessness, the two kinds of meditative absorption, sleep, and unconsciousness.ConclusionSummarizing the foregoing presentation of the five psycho-physical aggre­gates, Kongtrul emphasizes that sentient beings inhabiting the world-system of desire (,kamadhatu, dod khams) are endowed with all five of them, but these are progressively diminished in higher realms of experience, such as the world- system of form {rupadhatu, gzugs khams), the world-system of formlessness51 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 53(árúpyadhátu, gzugs med khams), and the exalted states attained through the sublime path of the Lesser Vehicle.Eighteen sensory basesThe diversity of physical and mental phenomena encompassed in the five psycho-physical aggregates may also be restructured, repackaged, and pre­sented for the sake of those of varying intellectual abilities in terms of the eighteen sensory bases (,astadašadhatu, khams bco brgyad). These comprise the six internal sensory bases (nanggi khams drug), exemplified by the eyes; the six external sensory bases (phyi’i khams drug), exemplified by visual form; and the six cognizant sensory bases (mam par shes pai khams drug), exemplified by visual consciousness. They in turn may be reduced to the following three categories: sensory bases that are subsumed in the psycho-physical aggregates (phungpos bsduspai khams)', those that are not subsumed in the psycho­physical aggregates (des ma bsdus pai khams)', and the sensory base of mental phenomena (dharmadhátu, chos kyi khams).Sensory bases subsumed in the aggregatesHere, the single aggregate of physical forms is restructured as the “ten physical sensory bases” (daíarúpakadhátu, gzugs can gyi khams bcu), comprising the sensory bases of the five physical sense organs (dbangpo gzugs can Ingai khams) and the sensory bases of the five physical sense objects (yul gzugs can Ingai khams). Classed alongside these is the “material portion of the sensory activ­ity field of phenomena” (dharmáyatanampa, chos kyi skye mched kyi gzugs), which may be exemplified by intangible atomic forms that are extremely small and concentrated. Then, the three aggregates of feelings, perceptions, and formative predispositions are restructured as the “mental portion of the sen­sory activity field of phenomena” (dharmáyatandhátu, chos kyi skye mched kyi khams), forming a separate sensory base because they are exclusively objects of the mental faculty. Lastly, the single aggregate of consciousness is restructured as the “seven sensory bases of consciousness” (.saptavijňánadhátu, mam par shes pai khams bdun), comprising the six modes of engaged consciousness, extending from visual consciousness as far as mental consciousness, along with the sensory base of the dissonant mental consciousness.Sensory bases not subsumed in the aggregatesThe sensory bases which are not subsumed in the five psycho-physical aggre­gates include one portion of the sensory base of phenomena (dharmadhátu, chos kyi khams), comprising unconditioned phenomena such as the three"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"54 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEaspects of reality, space, cessation obtained through non-analytical or ana­lytical means, the immovable state, and the cessation of perception and feeling.Sensory base o f phenomenaThe sensory base of phenomena (,dharmadhatu, chos kyi khams) includes objects that are exclusively within the range of mental consciousness, such as the aforementioned five subtle aspects of form; the three aggregates of feelings, perceptions, and formative predispositions; and the eight uncon­ditioned states.Twelve sensory activity fieldsIn a further refinement, all physical and mental phenomena may then be restructured in terms of the twelve sensory activity fields. Here, they comprise the six inner sensory activity fields (nanggi skye mched drug), such as the eye (caksurdyatana, miggiskye mched), and six outer sensory activity fields {phyii skye mched drug), such as visible form [rup ay at ana, gzugs kyi skye mched). Ten of these subjectively or objectively activate the five sensory gates where the five modes of sensory consciousness arise. The eleventh is the sensory activity field of the mental faculty (mana ayatana,yid kyi skye mched), which activates the sensory gate where mental consciousness arises on the basis of its immediate condition, and die twelfth is the sensory activity field of phe­nomena {dharmayatana, chos kyi skye mched), which activates the sensory gate where mental consciousness arises on the basis of its referential or objective condition.Sensory bases subsumed in the sensory activity fieldsIn this context, the ten physical sensory bases, comprising the five sense organs and the five sense objects, are re-designated as the “ten physical sensory activ­ity fields.” The seven sensory bases of consciousness are restructured as the single “sensory activity field of the mental faculty”; while the sensory base of phenomena is re-designated as the “sensory activity field of phenomena.”Phenomenological structures according to the tradition ofLower AbhidharmaAnother presentational method, generally associated with the Lower Abhi­dharma tradition of Vasubandhu but also found in Asarigas writings, struc­tures all physical and mental phenomena in terms of five basic categories (pancajneya, shes by a thams cad gzhi lnga)\\ apparent forms (snang b a gzugs"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 55kyigzhi), the central mind {gtso bo sems kyigzhi), the peripheral mental states (Jkborsems byunggigzhi), the circumstantial formative predispositions disas­sociated with mind and mental states (gnasskabs Idanpa m ayinpai du byed kyigzhi), and the unconditioned states {gagpa dus ma byas kyigzhi).Among them, apparent forms comprise eleven substances—the five sense organs, their corresponding five sense objects, and imperceptible form {avijñaptirüpa, rnam par rig byed ma yin pai gzugs), which includes those forms belonging to the sensory activity field of phenomena that arise dur­ing distracted periods of apperception {rnam par rig byed) and during any meditative stability, providing continuity of experience, and which have the characteristics of imperceptible universals (,avijñaptisámánya, rig min spyii mtshan nyid).The central mind, in this context, refers only to the six modes of engaged consciousness, excluding the substratum and the dissonant mental conscious­ness. Also, the peripheral mental states are forty-six in number (rather than fifty-one), and they are divided into the following six groups:(i) the ten mental states found in all minds {dalacittamahábhümika, sems kyi sa mangpo bcu)\\(i) the ten mental states found in all virtuous minds {dasakusalamaha- bhümika, dge bai sa mang bcu);(3) the six mental states found in all afflicted minds (.satklesamahdbhümika, nyon mongs can gyi sa mang drug);(4) the two mental states found in all non-virtuous minds {dvyaydkusa- lamahdbhümika, mi dge bai sa pa chen po gny is);(5) the ten mental states found in all slightly afflicted minds (parittaklesa- bhümika, nyon mongs chung ngui sa pa bcu)\\(6) the eight indeterminate mental states {astdniyatabhümika, ma ngespai sa pa brgyad).In addition, there are eight or fourteen formative predispositions disas­sociated with mind (cittavip ray uktaca itasika, Idan min du byed kyigzhi), and three kinds of unconditioned phenomena {asamskrta, dus ma byas kyigzhi): space, cessation obtained through analytical means, and cessation obtained through non-analytical means.Phenomenology o f the definitive promulgationIn a further refinement of the phenomenological presentations of the Higher and Lower Abhidharma, Kongtrul now reaches the culmination of Book Six, Part Two, where physical and mental phenomena are restructured in"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"56 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEaccordance with the interpretations of Maitreya and Taranatha, who elabo­rated on the definitive sutras of the Buddhas third promulgation. The analysis here comprises the “twenty-one phenomenological categories of the ground” (gzhi’i chos nyergcig); the “spiritual path and goal” (lam dang ’bras bu); the “five foundational factors” of epistemology (pancadharma, chos Inga); the “three natures” (trilaksana, mtshan nyidgsum); and the “twelve links of dependent origination” (dvadasangapratityasamutpada, rten ’brelgyiyan lagbcu gnyis).Twenty-one aspects of the groundOnce all the aforementioned phenomenological structures of the Higher and Lower Abhidharma have been established, it becomes apparent that the eighteen sensory bases derive from the five psycho-physical aggregates, and the twelve sensory activity fields derive from the eighteen sensory bases. All of these phenomena may then be further reconstituted under three simpler headings: the aggregate of physical forms, the sensory base of mental phe­nomena, and the sensory activity field of the mental faculty. This is the start­ing point for the phenomenological interpretation of the so-called definitive promulgation.Taranatha enumerates the twenty-one phenomenological categories of the ground (gzhi’i chos nyer gcig) as follows: (i) the aggregate of physical forms (gzugs kyiphungpo)', (2) the sensory base of mental phenomena (chos kyi khams); (3) the sensory activity field of the mental faculty (yid kyi skye mched). Each of these also has three further subdivisions. Among them, the aggregate of physical forms comprises (4) the sensory base of the elements (’byungbai khams), (5) the containing physical world (snod kyi jig rten), and(6) its sentient inhabitants (bcud kyi sems can). The sensory activity field of the mental faculty comprises (7) mind (sems), ($) mentation (yid), and (9) consciousness (mam par shes pa). The sensory base of mental phenomena comprises (10) mental phenomena denoting demonstrations (mtshan gzhi’i chos), (11) mental phenomena denoting defining characteristics (mtshannyid kyi chos), and (11) non-substantial mental phenomena (dngos med kyi chos). Then, among the last three, demonstrations comprise the aggregates of (13) feelings, (14) perceptions, and (1$) formative predispositions. Defining char­acteristics comprise those that are imputed (16) with regard to space (yul la btagspa), (17) with regard to time (dus la btagspa), and (18) with regard to substance (dngos la btags pa). Finally, non-substantial mental phenomena may also be subdivided into (19) those that arise through the transformation of substance (dngospogzhan ’gyurgyi dngos med), (20) those that are dependent"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 57on substance (dngospo la brten pai dngos med), and (zi) those that do not exist (misridpai dngos med).Spiritual path and goalOn this phenomenological basis, three approaches of the spiritual path are then charted. These comprise (i) the common path pursued in the vehicles of the gods and of Brahma (lha dang tshangs pa’i thegpa), (i) the uncom­mon path followed in the vehicles of pious attendants and hermit buddhas (,nyan ranggi theg pa), and (3) the extraordinary path of the Greater Vehicle (thegpa chen po) through which the abiding nature or level of the Buddha might be reached. This conclusive goal, identified with the expanse of reality (dharmadhatu, chos kyi dbyings), or ultimate truth (paramdrthasatya, don dam pai bden pa), is uniquely considered to be uncompounded, whereas all the unconditioned phenomena posited by pious attendants are merely classed as “symbolic or imputed unconditioned phenomena” (rnamgrangs sam btags pai dus ma by as).FivefactorsFollowing Taranatha, Kongtrul now proceeds to analyze mundane andsupra- mundane phenomena in terms of the five epistemic factors (pancadharma, chos Inga). Here, the term “factor” (chos) suggests a foundation facilitating the understanding of phenomena. Elsewhere, the five factors are also known as the “five entities” (pancavastu, dngos po Inga), indicating that they have the causal efficacy of substantial entities, or that they form the “ground that subsumes all phenomenological structures” (shes by a bsdu baigzhi). Together, they comprise appearances (nimitta, rgyu mtshan), names (nama, ming), false imaginations (vikalpa, mam par rtogpa), absolute reality (tathata, de bzhin nyid), and genuine non-conceptual knowledge (nirvikalpajndna, yang dag pai ye shes).1. AppearancesAppearances are defined as “universal images of states or objects, which may be signified verbally or conceptually.” They include (1) natural appearances (svabhdvanimitta, rang bzhin gyi rgyu mtshan)—the signs of diversely appear­ing propensities that manifest to the innate mind in cyclic existence; (z) pro­jected appearances (bimbanimitta,gzugs bmyengyi rgyu mtshan), such as the apprehension of a self, which is imputed by erroneous philosophical systems; and (3) polarizing appearances (dvandvanimitta, rgyu mtshan gnyis gnyis),"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"$8 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEsuch as the dichotomies of the realized and unrealized, clear and unclear, or symbolic and non-symbolic.2. NamesNames are defined as verbally designated universals which, on being imputed with respect to a given appearance, will be perceived and labeled, as in the example of the name “vase,” which is perceived as the term-universal (sgra spyi) corresponding to its given object, even without it being audibly sensed. Here, there is a sixfold classification comprising (i) substantive names (dngos po’i ming), (2.) relational names {’brel bai ming), (3) integrating names ('dus pai ming), (4) diversifying names [tha dadpai ming), (5) known names (grags pai ming), and (6) unknown names (magragspai ming).3. False imaginationsFalse imaginations denote the mind and its mental states. There are both symbolic and non-symbolic aspects (nimittavikalpa cdnimittavikalpa, mtshan bcas dang mtshan ma medpai mam rtog). The former refers principally to imaginations associated with the mind and mental states prevalent in the world-system of desire, as well as those prevalent as far as the first meditative concentration. The latter refers to imaginations that are prevalent from that first meditative concentration as far as the summit of existence (bhavagra, srid rtse), as well as the temporary mind and mental states associated with unconsciousness and sleep.Other classifications are also found. For example, imaginations may include those associated with dissonant mental states (klistavikalpa, nyon mongs ean gyi rnam rtog) and those associated with non-dissonant mental states {aklistavikalpa, nyon mongs can ma yin pa'i rnam rtog). The former are the non-virtuous notions prevalent in the world system of desire, while the latter are the imaginations compounded by uncorrupted states.4. Absolute realityThe actual reality that transcends objects of verbal expression and mental conception is also known as “suchness” or “absolute reality,” which is within the perceptual range of the non-conceptual pristine cognition (rnam par mi rtogpaiyeshes) alone, experienced during the meditative equipoise of sublime beings.5. Genuine non-conceptual knowledgeThe genuine non-conceptual knowledge is that of the authentic spiritual paths, which characteristically intermingle supramundane meditative equi­"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 59poise (samdhita, mnyamgzhag) with supramundane post-meditative experi­ence (prsthalabdha, rjes thob).Three naturesThe five factors are then analyzed in terms of the three natures of which they partake. Accordingly, postulated concepts which are not apprehended on the basis of appearances are assigned, along with names, to the imaginary nature (parikalpita, kun brtags). Conceptual thoughts and genuine knowledge are assigned to the dependent nature (paratantra, gzhan dbang)\\ while the abso­lute reality is assigned to the unchanging consummate nature (parinispanna, yongs grub).1. Imaginary natureWhen the imaginary nature is classified, it comprises(i) the imaginary nature of delimited characteristics (paricchedapari- kalpita, mtshan nyid yongs su chad pai kun btags), exemplified by objects apprehended through the deluded apprehension of individual selfhood;(i) the nominal imaginary {parydyaparikalpita, mam grangs pai kun btags), which is exemplified by the dualistic appearances of the subject- object dichotomy; and (3) the referentially imputed imaginary (Itos nas btags pa), which may be exemplified by imputed dichotomies such as “large” and “small,” “west” and “east,” or “basis of designation” (gdags gzhi) and “designa­tor” (gdags byed).Other enumerations are also found, such as the twelve aspects of false imagination that are listed in the Sutra of the Descent to Laňka, and the ten aspects of distracting imagination.2. Dependent natureThe dependent nature which entails “apperception alone,” or “ideation alone” (vijnaptimdtra, mam par rig pa tsam), arising through its own intrinsic causes and conditions, has two aspects: the dependent nature comprising the seeds of all dissonant mental states, and the dependent nature in which neither deluded nor purified mental states inherently exist because conscious aware­ness is pure and unmodified by propensities.Alternatively, the dependent nature may be classified according to the impure mundane dependent nature (ma dag jig rtenpaigzhan dbang), in which the mind and mental states of the three world systems manifest as real"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"6o- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEexistents through the power of propensities, and the pure mundane depen­dent nature {dagpa ’jigrtenpa’igzhan dbang), in which appearances devoid of substantial existence manifest in an illusory manner during the post-med­itative experiences of sublime beings.Further enumerations are also found, such as the six aspects of the depen­dent nature that are listed in the Sütra of the Descent to Lanka and the eleven aspects of apperception {mam rig bcugcig) mentioned by Táranátha.3. Consummate natureThe consummate nature is the actual reality of all phenomena, the original ultimate truth, which is known under diverse epithets such as the “reality of physical form” {rüpatathatá, gzugs kyi de bzhin nyid) and the “reality of feel­ing” (vedanátathatá, tshor ba’i de bzhin nyid). Asañga identifies four aspects, for the consummate nature is natural, immaculate, dynamic in terms of its spiritual path, and fruitional in terms of its objectives. Maitreya, in th t Analysis of the Middle and Extremes (.Madhyantavibhaga), differentiates the unchang­ing consummate nature and the incontrovertible consummate nature.Other enumerations are also found, such as the nine aspects of the con­summate nature identified in the Extensive Mother {Yum rgyaspa), which have been interpreted by Vasubandhu; the sixteen aspects of emptiness {soddasaíünyatá, stong nyid bcu drug); and so forth.Integration of the three naturesFrom a reductionist perspective, the three natures can in turn be reconstituted as two: the imaginary nature that relates to phenomena {chos kun brtags kyi mtshan nyid) and the consummate nature that relates to actual reality {chos nyidyongssugrubpa’i mtshan nyid). Elsewhere it is said that they are all “inex­pressible apart from the absolute reality”; for the imaginary is the aspect which imputes reification or exaggeration, the dependent is the object of this reifica­tion or exaggeration, and the consummate is the actual reality of those other two aspects. For example, “Whether there are appearances that arise before visual consciousness or appearances that arise before mental consciousness, at the time when [this visual or mental object] appears, e.g., as a ‘vase,’ the aspect which apprehends the vase is the imaginary nature. The bare consciousness, radiant and aware, which distinguishes it, is the dependent nature, and the pristine cognition that remains when the imaginary and dependent natures have ceased to exist is held to be the consummate nature.”Alternatively, “it can certainly be asserted that all phenomena are mind, that the nature of this mind—described by many synonyms, including inner"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION— 6lradiance (prab has vara), emptiness (.sunyatd), ultimate reality (paramdrtha), buddha nature (,dhatu), the nucleus of those gone to bliss (.sugatagarbha), and so forth—is the consummate nature, that the relative appearances of this mind as mere illusory apperception are the dependent nature, and that the aspect imputed as the dualistic phenomena of the subject-object dichotomy and so forth, even while apperception is non-existent, is the imaginary nature.” In terms of the three corresponding aspects of emptiness (.stongpa nyid gsum), the imaginary nature is designated as the “emptiness of non-existence” {medpai stongpa nyid) and is entirely devoid of inherent existence. The depen­dent nature is designated as the “emptiness of existence” {yodpa’i stongpa nyid) and is non-existent from the standpoint of ultimate truth (paramdrthasatya, don dam bden pa) but does exist in terms of the relative truth (samvrtisatya, kun rdzob bden pa). The consummate nature is designated as the “emptiness of inherent existence” (rang bzhin stongpa nyid) and abides as the actual reality of all things.ConclusionKongtrul ends this discussion by emphasizing that three natures are estab­lished, not only in the sutras of the final promulgation but also in the commen- tarial writings ofMaitreya, in Nagarjuna’s Commentary on the Salistambhaka Sutra {Sdlistambhakasutratikd), and in Vasubandhus Dissertation on the Thirty Verses {Trimsikdprakarana). He rejects the view that three natures are known only to the Cittamatrins and not to the Madhyamika, citing various other sources such as Candraklrti s Auto-commentary on the Introduction to Madhyamaka {Madhyamakdvatdrabhasya), Santaraksitas Auto-commentary on the Ornament of Madhyamaka (.Madhyamakalamkaravrtti), Kamalasllas Lamp of Madhyamaka {.Madhyamakaloka), and Nagarjunas Commentary on Enlightened Mind {Bodhicittavivarana).Twelve links o f dependent originationIn the final section of Book Six, Part Two, Kongtrul offers an extensive exe­gesis of dependent origination (pratityasamutpada, rten Tret) according to the common inclusive standpoint of both the Greater and Lesser Vehicles, because, as he states, “In whatever ways the first two of the three natures—the imaginary and the dependent—arise, it is the case that they do so through the power of dependent origination. The consummate nature may also be explained in terms of dependent origination with an intention directed towards the ultimate aspect of dependent origination, even though it is not actually subject to relative dependent origination.”"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"6l - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEGenerally speaking, dependent origination is “endowed with generated and generative aspects” (utpadyotpadakapratityasamutpada, bskyed bya skyed byed kyi rten ;brel), which are respectively the fruitional and causal processes associated with the arising of the physical environment and its sentient inhab­itants, along with the internal modes of consciousness. These processes prin­cipally fall within the scope of the dependent nature, as does the “genuine dependent origination” (samyakpratityasamutpada, yang dagpa’i rten ’brel), which determines the composition of the substratum consciousness and its propensities. However, the term may also refer to the relativistic “dependent origination endowed with determined and determinative aspects” (sthdpani yasthapakapratityasamutpada,gzhag bya jog byed kyi rten ’brel), which prin­cipally falls within the scope of the imaginary nature.When all phenomena are investigated, although they ultimately abide as emptiness, without inherent existence in any respect, the essential nature of dependent origination is that this is an empirical process that occurs only with regard to their appearances. Although there are many distinct shades of meaning, generally this term refers to the interconnecting causal nexus through which birth and rebirth within the cycle of existence are perpet­uated. As such, this causal nexus comprises the twelve successive links of dependent origination (dvadaJahgapratityasamutpada, rten ’brelgyiyan lag bcugnyis): fundamental ignorance (<avidya, ma rig pa), formative predisposi­tions (samskara, ’du byed), substratum consciousness (dlayavijndna, kungzbi’i mam shes), name and form (ndmarupa, minggzugs), the six sensory activity fields (sadayatana, skye mched drug), sensory contact (sparsa, regpa), sensa­tion (vedana, tshor ba), craving (trsna, sredpa), grasping (upadana, len pa), rebirth process (bhava,sridpa), actual birth (jdti,skyeba), and aging and death (jaramarana, rga shi’iyan lag). The individual functions of the twelve links are also analyzed by Kongtrul.Processes and scopes o f dependent originationThere are two processes through which these twelve links unfold: a static process whereby they manifest the propensities imposed on the substratum, and a dynamic process whereby they are manifested through the maturation of the seeds of past actions.Furthermore, there are several scopes of dependent origination that have been differentiated. For example:(i) The dependent origination that distinguishes the essential nature (sva bhavavibhdgapratityasamutpada, ngo bo nyid mam par ’byedpa’i rten"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 6 3*brel) refers to the emanation of all outer and inner phenomena from the substratum consciousness, and to the appearances that manifest through its power as being deposited upon it. This realization accords only with the scope of the Greater Vehicle.(2.) The dependent origination that distinguishes attractive and unattract­ive goals {priyapriyavibhdgapratityasamutpada, sdugpa dang mi sdug pa mam par ’byed pa’i rten ’brei!) accords with the views of pious atten­dants and hermit buddhas, among whom the latter extensively under­stand both the “arising process” (anuloma, lugs ’byung) of dependent origination and its “reversal process” [pratiloma, lugs Idog), whereas the pious attendants’ understanding is less complete.(3) The dependent origination associated with sensory engagement (,aupabhogikapratityasamutpada, nyer spyod can gyi rten }brel) is the process through which the six modes of engaged consciousness gen­erate dissonant mental states of attachment, aversion, and delusion, dependent on sensory contact, respectively with agreeable, disagree­able, and indifferent sensations. To counter this, the pious attendants seek to control the dependent dissonant mental states.Serial, instantaneous, and interconnected dependent origination It is said that the twelve links of dependent origination unfold in three dif­ferent ways: serially, instantaneously, or interconnectedly.Among them, serial or circumstantial dependent origination {prakarsika- pratityasamutpada, rgyun chagspdam gnas skabspa’i rten ’bret) includes the process whereby one cycle of the twelve links is completed over two lifetimes within the world system of desire, the process through which one cycle is completed over three lifetimes, and the process through which one cycle is completed within a single lifetime. On the other hand, instantaneous depen­dent origination (,ksanikapratityasamutpada, skad cigmdi rten 'hrel) refers to the completion of all twelve links of dependent origination in a single instant, as may occur when the act of murder is willfully committed.Eight aspects and two interpretations o f interconnected dependent originationThe “interconnected dependent origination'\\sambandbikapratityasamut- pada, ’brel ba can gyi rten ’brel) that relates to the causal nexus has eight aspects:(1) the dependent origination through which consciousness arises;(2.) the dependent origination through which birth and death arise;"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"64 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE(3) the uninterrupted dependent origination of the external world;(4) the dependent origination which is an extensive analysis of the physical environment(5) the dependent origination distinguished by the nourishing sustenance of the sensory bases, sensory contact, volition, and consciousness;(6) the dependent origination that distinguishes living beings according to desirable and undesirable realms of rebirth on the basis of virtuous and non-virtuous past actions;(7) the dependent origination that is well distinguished by means of purity acquired by cultivating the three higher trainings and the five spiritual paths;(8) the dependent origination that is well distinguished by means of the six supernormal cognitive powers.The first six of these fall within the range of dissonant mental states, and the last two are associated with purified states.There are also two distinct interpretations of interconnected dependent origination, based on the textual commentaries of Maitreya (rje btsun byams pdi gzhung don) and Vasubandhu {slob dpon dbyiggnyengyigzhungdon).Interpretation of MaitreyaMaitreya explains that three links—fundamental ignorance, craving, and grasping—are classed as dissonant mental states arising from other dissonant mental states {kleiasamklesa, nyon mongs pdi kun nos nyon mongs pa)\\ whereas two links—formative predispositions and rebirth process—are classed as dis­sonant mental states arising from past actions (<karmasamklesa, las kyi kun nas nyon mongspa); and the remaining seven are classed as dissonant mental states arising from the birth of sufferings {janmasamklesa, sdug bsngal mams skye bai kun nas nyon mongs pa). Alternatively, five links—fundamental ignorance, formative predispositions, craving, grasping, and the rebirth process—may be designated as causal dissonant mental states (,betusamkleia), and the remain­der as fruitional dissonant mental states (phalasamklesa).Interpretation of VasubandhuVasubandhu explains that when the cycle of the twelve links of dependent origination is completed over two lifetimes, it comprises “seven projective and formative aspects” {’phengrub rgyu bdun). Moreover, there are differences in the distribution of the twelve links of dependent origination. All of them are"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONfully present in the world-system of desire, whereas in the two higher world- systems they are only partly present, because the link of aging exists therein in the manner of formative predispositions that are old and putrid, while in the world-system of formlessness specifically, the physical aspects of dependent origination are absent.ConclusionAsaiiga notes, in conclusion, that the processes of dependent origination have five inherent contradictions, for which reason their reality is only fully under­stood by buddhas. These are summarized as follows:(i) Although dependent origination is momentary, it is also observed to have duration.(2.) Although dependent origination arises from unmoving conditions, it is also observed that its potencies are idiosyncratic.(3) Although dependent origination occurs without reference to sentient beings, it is also observed in respect of sentient beings.(4) Although dependent origination has no creator, it is also observed that past actions are not fruitless.(5) Although dependent origination does not arise from the four extremes, it does not arise with reference to any other agency.Furthermore, all phenomena, just as they appear, are established as the rela­tive dependent origination, whereas their actual reality is merely designated as the dependent origination of emptiness, the ultimate truth. This crucial point is “extremely profound and subtle, for which reasons it is an object known by the Buddha alone.”The real nature of dependent origination is to be understood in terms of the four hallmarks of the Buddhas teachings: impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and selflessness. Briefly stated, phenomena are uncreated by die dynamics of conceptual thought present in the mind of a creator divinity, and they are impermanent because that which is permanent and steadfast would not be subject to the arising and cessation of causes and conditions. Since phe­nomena have a nature that partakes of arising and cessation, and substantial things are seeds endowed with potency, they are produced by causes capable of generating their respective results. Without knowing the processes of aris­ing and cessation in respect of substantial things in accordance with the three natures of which they partake, non-Buddhist philosophers propound their diverse perspectives of eternalism and nihilism. However, when the meaning"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"66- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGEof dependent origination is properly understood, “the reality will be known, and by also comprehending the three natures, one will obtain certainty with regard to dependent origination.”From the ultimate perspective, although emptiness is identified with dependent origination, the pristine cognition of natural inner radiance (rang bzhin od gsal bai ye shes), which is the ultimate truth, actually transcends dependent origination because it is beyond all objects of verbal expression and mental conception, being liberated from the dichotomies between genera­tive causes and generated results, or determined and determinative aspects. This natural inner radiance has not been generated by any cause whatsoever because it does not produce an extraneous result, nor is it a causal action of extraneous production. On the other hand, it is not contradictory to say that although the ultimate truth is not dependent origination, it can be realized by meditating on dependent origination.The TranslationThe root verses ofjamgon Kongtruls Encompassment o f A ll Knowledge {Shes bya kun khyab) are terse and pithy, designed as a mnemonic aid for erudite exponents of the various Tibetan traditions, and they are virtually unin­telligible without reference to his auto-commentary, the Infinite Ocean ofi Knowledge {Shes bya mtha yaspa’i rgya mtsho\\ which was written in prose, in an encyclopedic style. The latter is replete with quotations from classical Indian sources and the Tibetan commentarial tradition, in keeping with the “great conversation” of the ongoing Indo-Tibetan philosophical tradition. Among Tibetan sources, specific mention should be made ofTáranátha, an inspirational writer for Jamgon Kongtrul, whose ghostly presence at times seems to permeate the Treasury o f Knowledge. In general, Kongtrul takes great care to cite his sources, but references to Táranátha and his disciple Khewang Yeshe Gyatso are not always acknowledged, possibly for diplomatic reasons, as his new treatise was to gain great currency throughout Tibet—even in the central regions where the works ofTáranátha had been proscribed during the seventeenth century.There are several challenges to be faced in translating this complex text into readable English. Despite its encyclopedic vastness, the Treasury o f Knowledge is remarkably terse and concise in style. It contains many pas­sages and observations requiring further elucidation or annotation, even for the educated Tibetan reader. Since accuracy has to be the benchmark, often at the expense of elegance, words have sometimes been added in brackets to"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION - 6 7assist the reader s understanding. More frequently, endnotes have been added to explain obscure points or to refer the reader to more detailed works in Tibetan, Sanskrit, or Western languages for further reading. Wherever pos­sible, I have also sought to cross-reference Jamgon Kongtruls observations to other volumes in this series.In preparing this translation, the range of the English terminology for technical language has had to match the wide diversity of the books subject- matter, covering the disparate fields of linguistics, logic, fine art, medicine, astrology, poetics, metrics, lexicography, dramaturgy, and Buddhist phenom­enology. The full range of terminology employed can be ascertained from the trilingual thematic concordance of technical terms, at the end of the book. In addition, I have frequently opted to retain Tibetan and Sanskrit technical terms in parenthesis, in the body of the text, as an aid for the educated reader, even at the risk of diminishing fluency.In view of the technical nature of the subject matter, the intricacies of San­skrit grammar which are explained in the text and so forth, I have deliberately followed the standard academic system of romanization for Sanskrit. In tran­scribing Tibetan technical terms, I have utilized the standard modifications of extended Wylie for romanized Tibetan, except in the case of personal names or place-names, where a more simplified phonetic system has been employed.In addition to Kongtruls root verses and prose commentary, this volume also contains an outline (sa bead) of the headings used by Jamgon Kongtrul in his treatise, following the traditional convoluted style which academic Tibetan treatises employ for pedagogic and mnemonic purposes. This out­line has its basis in the Outline o f the Encompassment o f A ll Knowledge (Shes by a kun khyab kyi sa bead), which was written and published in Tibetan by Professor Thubten Nyima (Zenkar Rinpoche) in 1990.The bibliography at the end of the book is in two sections. The first contains references to Indie and Tibetan works cited by the author, and the second includes other works—in Sanskrit, Tibetan and other languages—which have been recommended for further reading in the introduction and endnotes.Ack now ledgm entsThis project—the English translation of the entire Treasury o f Knowledge— was initiated by the previous Kalu Rinpoche during the winters of 1988 and 1989 and subsequently maintained by his lineage-holder, Bokar Rinpoche.

While undertaking this pres­ent translation, I also felt a sense of joy in re-establishing a Kagyu connection that I had had when, as an undergraduate, I first met the previous Trungpa Rinpoche at Samye Ling in Scotland. I would like to thank Eric Colombel of the Tsadra Foundation for providing this opportunity, and for all the sup­port he has generously given over the last three years—dedicated, as he is, to fulfilling this long-term vision of Kalu Rinpoche.The disparate themes and the wide ranging technical terminology found in Indo-Tibetan Classical Learning and Buddhist Phenomenology are com­plex and challenging, even for a jack-of-all-trades. Translation is inevitably a solitary and painstaking pursuit, and I have been able to draw upon my background knowledge in Nyingma and general Buddhist studies, however flawed, acquired under the guidance of the aforementioned peerless teach­ers, alongside Tulku Pema Wangyal and Zenkar Rinpoche. It also helped immensely to have studied the subjects contained in this volume with authori­tative teachers, east and west.My introduction to Sanskrit grammar, poetics, prosody, and Indian phi­losophy owes much to the instruction of Dr. Michael Coulson and Dr. John Brockington at the University of Edinburgh during the 1960s. Subsequently, I studied Tibetan grammar under the venerable Lobsangjamspal at Sanskrit University in Varanasi in 1968-69. During the 1970s I worked briefly with Terry Clifford on the translations from the Four Medical Tantras ofDratang contained in her Tibetan Buddhist Medicine and Psychiatry, and in the early 1990s I translated numerous passages from Desi Sangye Gyatsos Blue Beryl treatise on Tibetan medicine, in connection with my work with Fernand Meyer on Tibetan Medical Paintings.During the 1990s, I also had the good fortune to work at close quarters for four years with Professor Thubten Nyima (Zenkar Rinpoche) at London University, on the translation of the Greater Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary {Bod rgya tshigmdzod chen mo), which is replete with technical terms drawn from all the subjects contained in this volume, including logic, fine art, astrology,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION- 6c,dramaturgy, phenomenology, and others already mentioned. Towards the end of that same decade, I studied astrology and especially elemental divina­tion in some depth, with the late Khenpo Tsultrim Gyaltsen at the Lhasa Mentsikhang, working on an illuminated manuscript, in conjunction with the commentaries of Sangye Gyatsos White Beryl treatise and the writings of Lochen Dharmasrl. The fruits of this research were subsequently published in Tibetan Elemental Divination Paintings.At various times I had also acquired a limited knowledge of sources relevant for the study of Tibetan art, working on specific texts with Philip Denwood at SO AS, with the art historian Jane Casey, and in discussions with Robert Beer, as well as through my fieldwork in researching the successive editions of Footprint Tibet and Jokhang: Tibet’s Most Sacred Buddhist Temple.While translating and researching this present volume between 1007 and 2010, source materials were generously provided by Gene Smith and his col­leagues at the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center in New York, as well as by Burkhard Quessel of the British Library, Robert Chilton of the Asian Classics Input Project, and Yangchen Lhamo of the Sichuan Nationalities Publishing House in Chengdu. I also made good use of my own private library in Crieff, and the Indological collection at the library of the University of Edinburgh. I am grateful to all those who kindly helped bring this project to fruition.Teachers, colleagues, and friends in various parts of the world have also con­tributed by helping to resolve obscurities and difficulties in the text. Professor Thubten Nyima worked intensively and carefully through my list of unresolved issues in London, in October 2009, over a number of days. Specific points were also resolved in discussion with Peter Verhagen (on Sanskrit grammar); Thupten Jinpa Langri, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, and Georges Dreyfus (on logic); David Jackson, Robert Beer, and Khenpo Kalsang Gyaltsen (on fine art); Gene Smith and Paldor (on various subjects); Ricardo Canzio (on Tibetan music and chanting); Edward Henning (on astrology and art); Chris­topher Fynn (on calligraphy); and Karl Brunnholzl, Michael Sheehy, and Bhikkhu Bodhi (on phenomenology). I would like to express my gratitude to them; and, last but not least, to my friend and colleague Martin Boord, who carefully proofread the text and its Sanskrit terminology over several months. The inevitable faults that will be found in this work are entirely mine.In the course of translating this volume, I soon realized that there are some sections that would uniquely benefit from the inclusion of graphics or illus­trations—particularly the chapters on fine art and medicine.

That is to say, it is through knowledge of non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosophical and spiritual systems that one will come to discern those things that should be adopted and those things that should be renounced. Then, after one has studied the training of ethical discipline, negative actions will be reversed. After studying the training of the mind [through meditation], pointless desires will be completely abandoned; and after studying the train­ing of discriminative awareness, the state of nirvana that is actually free from corruption will be attained.8In the transmission [entitled] Analysis [of Monastic Discipline], it is said that an erudite person has five advantages;9 and elsewhere, it is said in various sutras and treatises that the enlightened attributes of erudition are limitless.10 It is for this reason that, at the outset, studies should be thoroughly pursued in an impartial manner.Three General Areas of Stu dy—Sc r iptu r es, Treatises, and Fine Arts [II]Secondly, the three ways in which studies can be pursued are explained in accordance with the Level o f the Bodhisattvas:uWhatever one investigates—scriptural compilations, treatises, or fine arts—One should be aided by humility and perseverance.Why so? In order to accumulate genuine [analytic] knowledge and so forth!Whenever bodhisattvas who are in pursuit of the sacred teachings engage in any investigation, it is actually the knowledge of the scriptural compilations ipitaka,sdesnod), the treatises (lastra, bstan bcos), the mundane fine arts (.silpa, bzo), and the status of past actions {karma, las) that they are investigating.The “scriptural compilation” [of the Buddhist canon] includes the scrip­tures of the bodhisattvas and the scriptures of the pious attendants.12 Among the so-called twelve branches of the scriptures, the category of extensive teach­ings {mahdvaipulya) is said to comprise the former, while the remaining eleven branches comprise the scriptures of the pious attendants.13 Together, these"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF LEARNING— IOIform the [canonical] subject matter of the Buddhist treatises or Buddhist studies.“Treatises,” when abbreviated in this context, comprise three categories, namely, commentaries on logic, grammar, and medicine;14 but these may also be designated as non-Buddhist on account of their allegiance to two [or more] teachers [and not only Sakyamuni].15Third, as for the “arts,” the commentaries on the thirty designated arts (bzor btags pa sum cu)16 and so forth are established as fields of mundane science, and for this reason are not [formally] categorized as treatises.When [bodhisattvas] investigate [the sciences] accordingly, those who know that seeds are conducive to their [appropriate] fruits should conduct their research, aided by humility that never slackens and perseverance that is never interrupted, until the objective of their studies is conclusively compre­hended. If you ask why they should conduct their investigations in this way, it says in the Sutra o f the Ascertainment of the Characteristics o f Phenomena:'1Manjusrl! One who knows the essence and defining characteris­tics of all teachings attains genuine analytic knowledge of their meaning. One who knows their various distinctions and their systematic presentations attains the genuine analytic knowledge of intellectual brilliance. One who knows the range of various syn­onyms attains the genuine analytic knowledge of the teaching.One who knows etymological definitions attains the genuine ana­lytic knowledge of etymological definition.18 Therefore, Manjusrl, if one strives after omniscience, one should initially cultivate the discriminative awareness that arises from study and reflection.19 This is because she is the mother of all the buddhas!Also it is said in the Discourse on Designations:20The genuine analytic knowledge of the teaching will be attained through scholarship with regard to names, [syntactically bound] phrases, and syllables. The genuine analytic knowledge of meaning will be attained through scholarship with regard to their meaning.The genuine analytic knowledge of etymological definition will be attained through scholarship with regard to words and designa­tions.

The following summary, derived from that work, is relevant in the context of bodhisattvas who investigate the empirical teachings:22In this regard, if you ask why bodhisattvas continue to pursue these studies, bodhisattvas continue to investigate thoroughly the teach­ings of the Buddha because they are obliged to master earnestly and authentically all doctrines that are in conformity with the sacred teaching and because they impart those doctrines extensively and authentically to others.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of logic because they have to thoroughly and qualitatively understand the elo­quence and solecism found in the treatises themselves, because they are obliged to refute the critiques of others, because they have to convince those lacking faith in this teaching [of Buddhism], and because they have to reinvigorate those who already have faith.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of grammar because, while constructing refined Sanskrit syntax with fine words or syllables and an elegant use of etymological definitions, they inspire confidence in those wishing them to speak, and because they have to employ terminology in conformity with diverse ety­mological nuances, even though their meaning may be identical.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of medicine because they are obliged to alleviate the various ailments that afflict sentient beings, and because they can benefit the great mass of living creatures.Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the aspects of knowl­edge concerning the status of mundane past actions because they acquire resources without difficulty for the sake of sentient beings, and because they are obliged to cherish all sentient beings.The same text concludes that:23The five ordinary sciences cultivated by bodhisattvas are also to be investigated because bodhisattvas are obliged to perfect the great provision of pristine cognition {jndnasambhdra.ye shes kyi tshogs)102 . - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF LEARNING— 103of unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment.24 If they do not study all those subjects, they will not in due course attain the unobscured all-knowing pristine cognition.When these extensive comments are abbreviated, [bodhisattvas] are obliged to persevere for the sake of their objective—the causal basis of the provisions through which the all-knowing pristine cognition is attained.In t r o d u c t io n to th e Actual Texts of Classical Learning [III]Thirdly, the exegesis of the actual content [of classical learning] has three parts: the articulation of syllables which is the basis of all knowledge, the ordinary sciences and their branches, and the mundane spiritual paths that focus on this life."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"2.

Actual sounds are held to be not fruitional [in nature],But they are either produced in conformity with their causes, or cumulatively.Articulation of syllables (yi gei sbyor ba) is the basis of all knowledge because the techniques of training enunciated by the Buddha are maintained with reference to it, because it is also the causal basis of [those teachings that] propound the Four Vedas of the non-Buddhists,25 and because all linguistic expressions throughout the world commonly depend on [articulated] syl­lables. Therefore, at the outset, it is important that the articulation of syllables should be studied and skillfully comprehended. As Tonmi Sambhota himself has said [in his Thirty Verses]:16It should be explained that articulation of syllablesIs the basis of all [higher] spiritual trainings,27As well as being a causal basis for exponents of the Vedas;And it is the foundation of all forms of linguistic expression.Although the number of different languages in the world and the scripts that have been intellectually devised to represent them may be limitless and indefinable, the [common] foundation of all languages and scripts com­prises vowels and consonants, including both phonemes and their character representations.Among these, it is said that the basic element of sound—the pho­neme (.sabdadhatu, sgrai khams)—is not produced from a ripening cause (vipakahetu, mam smingyi rgyu)> because it arises whenever its articulation is desired and does not arise when this condition is absent. By contrast, [results] produced from a ripening [cause] may not arise voluntarily but do arise invol­untarily. For this reason sound is held by the Vaibhasikas to be produced either [as a result] in conformity with its own cause (nisyandaphala, rgyu mthun), or from a causal basis of homogeneity (.sabhdgahetu, skal mnyam), or else through the four cumulative experiences (caturaupacdyika, rgyas byung bzhi). The four cumulative experiences are enumerated as eating, sleeping, good conduct, and meditative stability.28Secondly, the detailed exegesis of the defining characteristics of syllabic articulation is presented through the following seven topics: essential nature, etymology, graphology, phonological analysis, morphology, pronunciation, and the eight elements of linguistic application (’jug pa i gnas brgyad).106 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"ARTICULATION AND SEMANTICS- 107Essential Nature of Articulation [i]Concerning the essential nature of the syllables [yi gei ngo bo) [it is said in the root verses]:The essential nature of syllabic articulation is vocal pulsation, Which may be short, long, or diphthong in its duration,Enduring [respectively] for one, two, or three blinks of an eye.Each fraction [of a vocal pulsation] lasts but a single instant,And, along with others, forms a continuum.[Syllables] are categorized in the Treasury [of Phenomenology] Among the disassociated [formative predispositions].The essential nature of the syllables is simply vocal pulsation (skad kyi gdangs). It is said in the Exposition o f Valid Cognition:29Having understood the motility of articulation,Sound is produced by one who knows how to produce it.The air-stream of vital energy (vdyu, rlung) is activated voluntarily, and the pulsation of the syllables arises from that. Depending on whether a pulsation endures for one, two, or three blinks of the eye, it is conventionally termed short, long, or diphthong in its duration. As the previous source also states:30The full extent of a syllableMay be measured in the blinking of an eye.Now, each fraction of a syllable is equivalent to an instant or indivisible time moment (ksana, skad cig), and a series or continuum is formed when the other [fractions] are gathered along with it. The Treasury o f Phenom­enology explains that among the [identifiable] phenomenological categories, [syllables] are held by both the Vaibhasikas and Sautrántikas to belong to the category of formative predispositions that are disassociated from mind (citta viprayuktasamskdra) .31Etym ology [2]Concerning the etymological definition [of the term “syllable” (yi ge’i nges tshig), it is said in the root verses]:"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"108 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEThe etymological definitions [of “syllable”] include “unchanging nature,”“Elucidator of nouns and words,” and “signifier of meanings.”The etymological definitions (nirukta, nges tshig) of the tzzm yi ge (“syl­lable”) include the following: In Sanskrit, the tri-syllabic a-ksa-ra [which is rendered in English as “syllable”] means “unchanging.” Even when translated into different languages, the nature of the vowels and consonants is unchang­ing—for example, a single character, such as [the vowel] A or [the consonant] KA, does not transform into a syllable with another phonetic value.The Sanskrit term vyanjana (“consonant”) means “elucidator” in the sense that the consonants elucidate or specify all nouns and words. The Sanskrit term varna (“letter” or “syllable”) means “signifier” in the sense that [the syl­lables] signify all meanings.Graphology [3]Concerning the graphology or character representation of syllables (yi gei mam pa) [it is said in the root verses]:The syllabic scripts include Ranjana, and so forth.There exist an almost limitless number of syllabic scripts (yiggzugs), the foremost of which are the sixty-four [traditional Indie scripts], including Brahml {tshangspdiyige) and Ranjana (lanydza).32Phonological Analysis of Sansk rit and Tibetan [4]The phonological analysis of the syllables [yigei dbye ba), [in this context] includes the Sanskrit tradition and the Tibetan tradition.[Sanskrit Ph o no lo g y]With regard to the former [it says in the root verses]:As for the analysis that is commonly made,In Sanskrit, the foremost of the four classical languages of India, The vowels include simple vowels and diphthongs,And the consonants include basic phonetic sets, semi-vowels, and spirants."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"ARTICULATION AND SEMANTICS— 109The vowels [according to the Grammar o f Candragomin]Number one hundred and thirty-two,And the basic consonants thirty-seven, which, when multiplied by the vowels,Become four thousand three hundred and fifty-six.These all arise dependent on eight places of articulation,Their articulators, and the modes of inner and outer articulation.While there are many systematic presentations of phonological analysis found in the traditions derived from each of the [eight renowned] gram­matical treatises33 and also in the uncommon tantra texts, the one that is com­monly made refers to the four major classical languages of India,34 of which the foremost is known as Sanskrit.The Sanskrit language includes both vowels and consonants. The vowels comprise the ten simple vowels (samdnaksara, mtshungspaiyige), from A and A to L, and L, as well as the four diphthongs (.samdhyaksara, mtshams sbyorgyi y ig e \\ E, Al, O, and AU—sixteen altogether.35 The consonants comprise five phonetic sets (pancavarga, sdepa Inga) [of stops/ sparsa], including the [velar/ kantha] set beginning with k a, as well as the four semi-vowels (<antahsthd, mthargnas), ya, r a, la and va, and the four spirants (usmdn, dro baiyige), sa and so forth.

Each of these five also may have the three tones, high, low, or middle, making thirty, and these are doubled to sixty when a distinction is made between those that accept nasalization and those that do not. Added to the aforementioned category, the vowels now number one hundred and thirty-two.39The consonants, meanwhile, include the basic thirty-three, along with H (visarga, mam gcad), AM (anusvara, nga ro)y HKA (jihvdmuliya, Ice rtsa can), and hpa (upadhmaniya, mchu can), making thirty-seven.40 Then, each of the basic thirty-three consonants, including k a, may take each of the hundred and thirty-two vowels, making a total of four thousand three hundred and fifty-six combinations.41All these consonants arise dependent on their appropriate places of articu­lation, articulators, and processes of articulation. Among them, concerning the places of articulation (vacanavasthd, rtsol baignas), it is said:42The chest, the throat, the head,And similarly the tip of the tongue, the teeth,The nose, the lips, and the palateComprise the eight places of syllabic [articulation].The syllable A, the stops of the velar phonetic set (kanthavarga) beginning with k a,43 and the spirant syllable h a all have their place of articulation in the velum or the throat.44 The vowels I, E, and a i are produced by contact with the throat and the palate; and the vowels U, O, and a u by contact between the throat and the lips.45The vowel R, the stops of the retroflex phonetic set (murdhanyavarga) beginning with t a,46 the semi-vowel r a,47 and the spirant syllable s a have their place of articulation in the head.48 Thejihvdmuliya has its place of articu­lation at the root of the palate.The vowel L, the stops of the dental phonetic set (dantyavarga) beginning with t a,49 the semi-vowel l a , and the spirant syllable SA all have their place of articulation in the teeth.50"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The anusvdra (a m ) has its place of articulation in the nose.

The semi-vowel VA is formed by contact with the teeth and the lips.55[Incidentally], the chest or trunk is said to be included here [among the places of articulation] because the velar or guttural syllables are produced with reference to it [as chest pulses], and the other syllables also inevitably have some association with the throat and thereby with the chest.With regard to the articulators [of the syllables] (karana, byedpa], the articulator of the jihvdmuliya ( h k a ) is the root of the tongue. The articula­tor of the palatal syllables is the blade of the tongue. The articulator of the retroflex or cacuminal syllables is the tip of the tongue in proximity [with the upper incisors]. The articulator of the dental syllables is the tip of the tongue. The remaining syllables all have articulators corresponding to dieir places of articulation.56The actual process of articulation (rtsol ba) includes both inner and outer aspects.57 There are four inner modes of articulation: closure or occlusion of the vocal tract (samvdra, btsums pa), opening of the vocal tract (vivdra,phye ba), contact or plosion (sprsta,phradpa), and partial contact (isatsprsta, cung zadphradpa).58 Among these, the syllable A is articulated in coincidence with occlusion, while the other vowels and the spirants are articulated in coincidence with the opening of the vocal tract. In this context, the spirants (usman, dro baiyige) accord with the explanation that is given below [in the next paragraph]. Contact characterizes the inner articulation of the [stop consonants, i.e., the syllables of the various] phonetic sets, which are emit­ted energetically and loudly expressed. Partial contact characterizes the inner articulation of the semi-vowels.There are five modes of outer articulation: unvoiced surds (,aghosa, sgra med), non-aspirates (alpapana, srog chung), aspirates (mahdpdna, srogchen), voiced sonants (ghosavant, sgra Idan), and spirants (usman, dro ba)P Among them, the unvoiced surds comprise the first and second syllables of each phonetic set, along with spirants s a , s a , SA, the jihvdmuliya ( h k a ) , and the upadhmaniya ( h p a ) .

These are combinedwith the syllable A because they cannot be expressed in isolation. The thirty basic consonants, commencing with k a and ending with A, are analyzed as follows.

Therefore, the distinction between the three tenses is found universally in sentence construction pertaining to the action of the subject, and the distinction between agentive and objective, though not quite as all- embracing, is made alongside [the distinction of tense] because sentences include constructions expressive of both the subject and the object.80Examples of constructions expressing the agentive or subject include [nominal forms such as] sgrub pa po (“achiever”), ston pa po (“teacher”), sgrub byed (“means of achievement,” “practice”), and ston byed (“means of teach­ing,” “instruction”); and verbal forms such asgsalbarbyedpa (“is clarifying”), sgrub par byed pa (“is achieving”), ston par byed pa (“is teaching”), sgrub bo (“is achieving”), and ston to (“is teaching”).Examples of constructions expressing the objective include [nominal forms such as] sgrub par bya ba (“object to be achieved,” “goal”), bstan par bya ba (“object to be taught,” “student”), bsgrub bya (“goal”), and bstan bya (“teach­ing”), as well as their verbal forms;—sgrub par bya (“is to be achieved”), bstan par bya (“is to be taught”), brgrub bo (“will be achieved”), and bstan no (“will be taught”).81As for the distinctive forms of the three tenses, which are not subsumed in that [agentive-objective] classification, there are many examples.

Conven­tional terms (vyavahdra, tha snyad) embody semantic usage, which naturally partakes of three [successive] phases: cognition, signification, and semantic application or engagement (.shes brjod juggsum). Among these, the imputative cognition (btagspa’i shes pa) is the consciousness that thinks [for example], “This is a pillar.” From this there follows signification—the verbalization of the word “pillar”—and application, which is [the understanding that] since there is a pillar, building work may be undertaken.Although universals (spyi) do not exist in reality, they are superimposed in order that [terms] might be meaningfully applied, just as, for example, a “piece of wood that supports a beam” is imputed to be a “pillar.”91Regarding these [semantic distinctions], names have the function of sig­nifying the bare essential nature (ngo bo tsam) of a given object. Attributes [of form and color] have the function of illustrating a given object.

This is because, when the level of omni­science {sarvajñdtd, thams cadmkhyenpa nyid) is attained, results will emerge that are in conformity with their causes. So it is said in the Introduction to the Conduct of a Bodhisattva:96There is nothing at all which is not to be studiedBy the sons of the Conqueror.For one who has such learning,Nothing at all will be without merit.Nágarjuna has also said [in his Eulogy to the Expanse o f Actual Reality]'.From all such seeds fruits will emerge that resemble their causes.Which learned one can prove that fruits come into being without seeds!The principal that similar classes of results are derived from similar classes of cause is one that conforms to the norms of worldly folk.

Fine arts and medicine bring into the fold students [seeking] both general and particular [skills]. The inner science [of Buddhism] brings about an understanding of all aspects of the path to omniscience. Therefore, the classical sciences may also be grouped in three categories: those that eradi­cate [wrongunderstandings], those that bring [seekers] into the fold, and the one that attains omniscience.98These then are [the fields of knowledge] that are to be studied. It is said in the Sutra o f [Great] Skillful Means, Repaying the Buddha with GratitudePIf a bodhisattva does not study the five sciences, he can never obtain all-knowing pristine cognition in the unsurpassed, genuine, and perfect enlightenment.

They comprise both genuine (dngos) and imputed or conventional {btags) bases, among which the primary element or the verbal root is consid­ered to be the genuine basis of word formation.103W hen verbal roots are analyzed, they partake o f the following six104categories:(1) [primary] verbal roots that have been listed or formally conjugated {paripathitadbatu, yongs su bklagspai byings) in the nine chapters of the Paradigms o f Verbal Roots, commencing with [chapter one, which concerns the Class One] verbs blou (“become”), andcit (“thinkof”);105(2.) verbal roots that have not been listed or formally conjugated {viparipathitadhatu,yongs su ma bklags pa’i byings) in any of the Com­mentaries on Verbal Roots (mDo ’grel), including [derivative Class Ten] forms such as adolayati (“raises up”), which have acquired wide con­ventional usage;106(3) verbal roots that have both been and not been listed or formally conju­gated (gnyis Idan), which are mentioned incidentally in the paradigms and Indian commentaries, such as the verbal root of ju (“hasten,” dzu mdo’i byings) and the verbal root of skambhu (“impede,” skambhui byings), but have not been formally listed or conjugated in any table of verbal roots (dhatupatha, byings kyi tshogs);107(4) denominative verbal roots (namadhatu, minggi byings), including twenty that are formed from nouns such as kandu (“itching”) by affixing -ya {yaK)m from among the desiderative and related suffixes (saN) to the nominal stem, thereby making a denominative verbal root [kanduyati];109(5) affixed verbal roots {pratyayadhatu, rkyengyi byings), including those formed by affixing any of the twelve desiderative and related suffixes {saN la sogspa) to a verbal root as appropriate, so that its ending also becomes a derivative verbal root;110(6) verbal roots that can be both denominative and affixed {gnyis ka), since their void terminations, formed by a zero suffix -v (.KvIP la sogs pa)m may be classed as nouns or affixes, in order that a conjugated verbal root may take the form of a noun, or vice versa, and then be reconsti­tuted as a verbal root, in accordance with the applied rules of verbal morphology {dkhyata, kun bshad)."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"When these [six categories of verbal roots] are subsumed, they comprise transitive verbs [of the active voice] {sakarmaka, las bcas) and intransitive or reflexive verbs [of the middle voice] (akarmaka, las med).m With regard to the former, it says in Purijarajas commentary:113When one “conceives,” “knows,” or “sees,”«r » « i »hats, or quarrels,“Makes,” “sells,” “holds,” or “steals,”“Gives,” “offers,” “desires,” or “touches,”“Pays homage,” “eulogizes,” “likes,” or “tolerates,”“Nourishes,” “considers,” or “impedes,” and so forth,“Speaks” or “kills,” and so forth—All such verbs are known as transitive.This is because they take a direct object.Thus, any verbal root such as these which takes a direct object (karman, by a baiyul), including, for example, the verbs to “conceive,” to “know,” to “see,” and to “hear,” and those which are [classed as] agentive (kartr, byedpa) because they are required to attach a second case accusative inflection to the direct object, are considered to be transitive.With regard to the latter, it says in the Analysis of the Grammar ofSdrasvata\\114When one is “embarrassed,” “sitting,” or “keeping watch,”“Waxing,” “waning,” “decaying,” “living,” or “dying,”“Lying down,” “playing,” or “shining,”These categories of verbal roots are explained to be intransitive.Since verbal roots such as siN (“to lie down”) accomplish their action of their own accord, without requiring a direct object in the accusative, they are classed as intransitive or reflexive.lisTo illustrate [the forming of derivatives from verbal roots], here [in Tibet], for the sake of those who have not studied Sanskrit grammar, the verbal root does not in itself signify anything, just like the Tibetan syllable ka. However, just as when prefixes and suffixes are added to ka making bka* (“Buddhist teachings”), so the Sanskrit verbal root bhu (to “become,” to “be”) through moderate vowel strengthening (guna, aC) may assume the form bhava (“exis­tence”) and through extreme vowel strengthening (vrddhi, GHaN) assumes the form bhava (“object”).116 In ways such as these, verbal roots assume the form of nouns.130 - THE TREASURY OF KNOW LEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"SANSKRIT GRAMMAR- 131On the subject of derivation (vikdra, mam gyur), just as in Tibetan the subscript letters la,ya and ra assume other forms [when subscripted], so in Sanskrit also, the verbal root bhu assumes a great number of other character representations, such as bhava, through the application of moderate vowel strengthening. In Sanskrit there are two types of inflected endings: verbal suf­fixes (tiN, indicating verbal desinence) and nominal suffixes (sUP, indicating nominal desinence),117 whereas in Tibetan there is only one.

Thus, when it assumes the mas­culine form, prakrtih may mean “nature” or “citizen,” “wine seller,” “potter,” and so forth, and when it assumes the feminine form .prakrti should be understood to mean “womb.”(6) stems of indeterminate gender {mi gsal ba’i rtags), including many words that are derived from an indeclinable class [avyayibhavavarga, mi zadpa’i sde tshan), such as ucchi (“high”) which have no variant forms because all their inflections are elided.124These are the six types of nominal stem.Affix a tio n [2']With regard to the second part of the detailed explanation [of Sanskrit gram­mar], on the subject of affixation [pratyaya) [it is said in the root verses]:Affixation includes desiderative suffixes,Enabling verbal roots to be formed as [other] verbal roots,Verbally conjugated suffixes, enabling verbal roots to be formed as phrases,Primary nominal suffixes associated with verbal action,Enabling verbal roots to be formed as nouns,131 - THE TREASURY OF KNOW LEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"SANSKRIT GRAMMAR- 133Denominative suffixes, enabling nouns to be formed as verbal roots,Feminine-forming suffixes, enabling gender to be formed as [another] gender,Secondary nominal suffixes, enabling nouns to be formed as [other] nouns,And nominal case suffixes, enabling nouns to be formed as phrases.Although there are a great many types of affixation that enable verbal roots to be formed as [syntactically] denoting words or phrases, when these are subsumed, they are classed according to the following seven types:(1) desiderative and related suffixes [saNla sogspa),m which are attached externally to the termination of the verbal root, enabling verbal roots to be reformed as [other] verbal roots;(2) the eighteen suffixes of verbal conjugation (tiN ’i mam dbye bco brg- yad),126 which alter tense and mood (l-akdraf27 without the need for an intervening vowel, enabling verbal roots to be formed as phrases.128 These [syntactically] denote the agent (,karana), the verbal action (,bhdva) and the direct object (karman), and in [Sarvadharas] ver­bal morphology section (akhydta) of the Kaldpa Grammar, they are known as the hundred and eighty personal verb inflections (tyadi, ti la sogspai mam dbye brgya dang brgyad cu).m(3) primary nominal suffixes (,krt), enabling verbal roots to be formed as substantives.

Alternatively, all words can be considered in terms of the [threefold] classification, denoting agents (karana, byedpa), verbal actions (bhdva, dngospo), and objects (karman, las).mDer ivatio n [3']With regard to the third part of the detailed explanation [of Sanskrit gram­mar], on the subject of derivation [it is said in the root verses]:Derivation comprises both actual [derivation] and nominal compounding.The essential elements of derivation concern the substitution [of retroflex syllables for dentals],And the classification of technical markers attached to verbal roots, affixes,Gender terminations, augments, indeclinable and [permitted final] words."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"SANSKRIT GRAMMAR- 135Elision should be carried out in respect of [final vowels] that facilitate pronunciation And [final letters] denoting peculiarities [of inflection],As well as those that are [merely] technical markers.139Derivation refers to the morphological transformations that the verbal roots undergo through contact with affixes and so forth. This includes actual derivation and the nominal compounds that are considered as a subcategory.Actual Der iv a t io n [a]Concerning the former, the substitution of initial [retroflex] s of a verbal root for dental s (satva), the substitution of initial [retroflex] n [of a verbal root] for n (natva)A° and the various classifications of the technical markers (anubandha, rjes su ’brel ba) are the essential elements of derivation.Concerning the classifications [of the technical markers]:141(1) Technical markers may be attached directly to verbal roots {dhat- vanubandha, byings kyi rjes su Jbrel ba), in which case they may take the form of [following] vowels, such as -A, [preceding] consonants such as [the nominal derivation markers] Tu- and Du-, or combined [vowels and consonants] such as [the following] -IRA1(2) Technical markers may be attached to affixes {pratyayanubandha, rkyen gyi rjes su ’brel ba), in which case they may take the form of consonants such as the -iVin ¿¿zTVand the -N in GHaNA3 or of vowels and conso­nants combined, such as the -A T in IAT, or the N and / in Nasi A4(3) Technical markers may be attached to long or short gender termina­tions (dirghahrasvalinganubandha, ring thungrtags kyi rjes su Jbrelba), in which case they take the form of a [following] -T (takdra, t-yig)A*>(4) Technical markers may be attached to augments {agamanubandha,glo bur gyi rkyen gyi rjes su ’brel ba), in which case they may be exemplified by the -M in nUMA6(5) Moreover, there are certain technical markers that may be attached to indeclinable words {avyayibhavanbandha, mi zadpa’i sde tshangyi rjes su ’brel ba), as well as to [permitted] final letters (padanta, tshig m thajA1 The latter entail elision [dbyi ba) which occurs in the follow­ing circumstances:(a) [Certain final vowels] such as -A have the function of facilitating the pronunciation of a given sound that would otherwise lack a"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"136 - THE TREASURY OF KNOW LEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEvowel and be unpronounceable, even though they can only occur in conjunction with a consonantal syllable, such as K A, when denoting the actual object to which a [given] sound refers. These should be elided, for example, when the vowel A attached to K- comes into contact with other affixes.148(b) Some [final letters] denote peculiarities [of inflection] (khyad don), arid these should be elided once the [corresponding] pecu­liarities [of inflection] have been applied.149(c) Some [final letters] are merely technical markers denoting the function of a substantive or primary base, and should be elided once the rules they prescribe have been implemented.150The verbal prepositions that modify meaning and form, and the augmentsConstitute the ancillary aspects of derivation.As for [derivations due to] affixation,All three aspects—syllables, affixes, and inflections—Undergo infinite transformations,Including those due to euphonic conjunction.There are twenty verbal prepositions (upasarga) that can modify both the meaning and the form [of a word].151 For example, when the verbal preposition pra- is placed before the root ni (meaning “control”),152 it formsprani (mean­ing “lead”); or when the same verbal preposition pra- is placed before mdna, it formspramdna (meaning “valid cognition”); whereas when anu- is placed before mdna, it forms the word anumdna (meaning “inference”). Similarly, there are a great many such combinations [that can be formed by this and the other verbal prepositions], e.g., upamd i)l%\\rc)}\\z),pratimd (“image”), and abhima (“arrogance”).Also there is the class of augments (<igama’i rkyen) which are indefinite with regard to their placement, as initial prefixes, medial infixes, or final suffixes, as when the augment -s (saK!)153 is inserted between ay a- and -kara, forming the word ayaskdra (“iron”). These are classed among the ancillary aspects of derivation.Then, with regard to derivations that are due to affixation (nipatavikara, phrad pai mam gyur), these occur when verbal roots make contact with affixes, so that consequently(i) the syllables undergo transformation, as when stha becomes tistha, or priya becomes pasya-, and subsidiary [syllabic] transformations occur"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"SANSKRIT GRAMMAR- 137through the strengthening gradations ot guna {yon tan) and vrddhi (‘'phelba), and so forth;154(1) the affixes undergo transformation, as when the primary nominal suf­fix -yu is transformed into -ana, and -vu is transformed into -aka™ or when the secondary nominal suffix final -ch is transformed into -iya\\™ and(3) the inflections undergo transformation, as when the eighteen verbal inflections [tiN sogs) derived from the paradigms of verbal morphol­ogy or conjugation, modify mood and tense (/) without the need for an intervening vowel,157 or when the nominal inflections [susogs] undergo transformation, as when Td is transformed into -ina,15* andAfe is trans­formed into -ya.™In short, all three categories—syllables, affixes, and inflections—can undergo an infinite number of morphological transformations, including the [elaborate] transformations brought about by the euphonic conjunction {sandhi) of vowels and consonants.160 These are exemplified by the formation of long Á through the combination of A and A, E through the combination of A and I, and O through the combination of A and U.161No m in al Co m p o u n d in g [b’]There are six kinds of nominal compound:Descriptive, pre-numerical, uncountable,Initially dependent, exocentric, and coordinative.The second part of the detailed explanation on derivation concerns the changes that occur in the formation of nominal compounds (samdsa, tsbig sdud). Nominal compounds combine two or multiple nouns, thereby form­ing a phrase, with a final nominal suffix (su sogs) attached, indicating name or gender. There are six [main] types of nominal compound:162(1) descriptive determinative compounds {karmadhdraya, las \\dzin pa), the function of which is to combine an appositional noun or adjective with its object for descriptive purposes;(2) dual compounds (dvigu, bagnyispa) in which the [main word of] the compound is preceded by a numeral—“two,” for example;(3) adverbial compounds (upakumbha, nye bai bum pa) which principally form an indeclinable phrase {avyayibhdva)\\(4) dependent determinative compounds {tatpurusa, dei skyes bu) in"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"138 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEwhich the first member of the compound forms one of twenty-one possible oblique relations [i.e., seven cases times three genders] with the main part, exemplified by the term tatpurusa [lit. “his man”], which entails a genitive relation;(5) exocentric compounds (bahuvrhi, ’bru mangpo) in which the subject with which the compound forms a possessive relation is external to the compound;(6) coordinative compounds {dvandva, zlas dbye ba) in which pairs [of nouns or adjectives] are conjoined.All these types of compound are capable of subsuming many meanings in a single point, and they may also combine many expressions and multiple case inflections in a single [phrase, with a single inflection]. The purpose of nominal compounding is to facilitate the construction of complicated expres­sions in few words. In general, they number six types, but in fact there are explained to be twenty-eight sub categories altogether.163Sy n o p sis of Sa n sk r it Gr a m m a r [c c]As to the synopsis of Sanskrit grammar [it is said in the root verses]:The essence [of grammar] is subsumed in nouns, words, and derivations.To learn the language, one should be undeluded with respect to meaning.When the essence of all these [aspects of Sanskrit grammar] is summarized, they may be subsumed together under the headings of nouns, words, and morphological derivations.

The defining characteristics of these respectively are that “substantial objects” (vastu, dngospo) are causally effective (arthakriyakdrana, don byed nuspa); “insubstantial objects” (avastu, dngos meet) are not causally effective, like space, for example; “compounded objects” (.samskrta, dus by as) can be produced from their own primary causes and secondary conditions; “uncompounded objects” (<asamskrta, dusma by as) cannot be produced from their own primary causes and secondary conditions; “permanent objects” (nitya, rtagpa) are imperishable phenomena; and “impermanent objects” (anitya, mi rtag pa) do not endure from the moment of their formation into a second moment.167Substantial [objects] include material and cognitive phenomena,Causes and results, along with their subdivisions.When substantial objects are analyzed in terms of their essential nature, they comprise both material phenomena (rupa, bem po) and cognitive"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"144- THE TREASURY OF KNOW LEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEphenomena (vidya, rigpa). The defining characteristic of material phenomena is that they are composed of atomic particles, while the defining characteristic of cognitive phenomena is that the object is cognitive.168Material phenomena, when analyzed, comprise both outer material phe­nomena and inner material phenomena. Their defining characteristics are respectively that the former are composed of external atomic particles and the latter of internal atomic particles. External matter {phyi don hem po), when analyzed, comprises the five objects of visual form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Their defining characteristics are that external matter comprises the substantial objects of visual, auditory, and olfactory consciousness, and so forth. Internal matter (nangdon bempo), when analyzed, comprises the five physical sense organs of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—their defining characteristics being that they are capable of functioning as the predominant condition (adhipatipratyaya, bdagrkyen) [prerequisite] for visual conscious­ness and so forth.169When substantial objects are analyzed in terms of their efficiency (kdraita, byedpa), they include both causes (hetu, rgyu) and results {phala, 1bras bu). The defining characteristic is whether or not x, the given property, assumes a subsequent existence as a distinct object, either through positive logical concomitance {anvaya, rjes ’gro) or through negative logical concomitance (vyatireka, Idog byed).mWhen causes are analyzed in terms of their essential nature, there are both direct causes (saksatkarana, dngos rgyu) and indirect causes (avedhahetu, brgyud rgyu). The defining characteristics of these are respectively that in the case of the [direct] cause of a given property x, there are no [extraneous factors intervening] between the cause of the property x and its resulty, as in the example of a seed and a shoot; whereas [in the case of an indirect cause], there are [extraneous intervening factors] between the cause of the given property x and its resultj/, just as a shoot is sequentially produced from a seed and finally [ripens] as a fruit.171Causes have many subdivisions, when analyzed in terms of primary and ordinary [causes], or when analyzed in terms of their four secondary condi­tions, and so forth.172Incidentally, with regard to the three tenses and so forth, the defining char­acteristic of the past is that it has elapsed, the defining characteristic of the future is that it has not yet arrived, [and the defining characteristic of the present is that it is here], just like one edge of the atom that appears before one here and now.173 The defining characteristic of the continuum of time (santana, rgyun) is something that has many sequential temporal moments"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"LOGIC- 145(ksana, skad cig) which serve to establish its identity, like “year,” for example. The defining characteristic of an indivisible time moment (nivirbhdgaksanika, skad cig cha mecí) is something that is without a sequential series of time- moments that serve to establish its identity, like, for example, the first of the sixty time-moments that constitute a fraction of a syllable.174Objects in Term s of Th e ir Fu n c t io n a l it y [a ]In terms of their functionality [objects] fall into three categories, Namely, apparent, conceived, and applied objects.When objects are analyzed in terms of their different functionalities as objects [yul du byed tshuL!), they fall into three distinct categories, namely, apparent (snangyul) or apprehended objects {grdhyakavisaya, bzungyul), conceived objects (adhyavasdyavisaya, zhen yul), and applied or engaged objects {pravrttivisaya, 'jugyul). The defining characteristic of apprehended objects is that they appear and are then apperceived, as is, for example, an “object-universal” (<arthasdmdnya, don spyi).m The defining characteristic of conceived objects is that they are conceived and then apperceived, just as, for example, the [imagined] seated posture of a man dwelling in another house. The defining characteristic of applied objects is that when they are utilized either as objects to be accepted or rejected, they are [consistently] unfailing {avisamvddi, mislu ba) [in their results], as, for example, when a farmer has a [productive] field that has absorbed seeds, water, fertilizer, heat, and humid­ity. These three categories also have many subdivisions.176Objects in Term s of Th e ir Un d e r st a n d in g [in ]In terms of the processes of understanding objects that are to be appraised:[Objects] include specifically and generally characterized phenomena,Or else they are established as directly evident, indirectly evident, And indirectly evident to an extreme degree,Or else [they comprise] signified [phenomena] and their supplementary [definitions].When objects to be appraised (prameya, gzhal bya) are analyzed in terms of the processes of understanding, they are said to include both specifically"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"146 - t h e TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEcharacterized phenomena (svalaksana, rangmtshan) and generally character­ized phenomena (.sdmdnyalaksana, spyi mtshan). Alternatively, they fall into three [categories]—appraisable objects that are directly evident (,abhimukhi, mngon gyur), those that are indirecdy evident (paroksa, Ikoggyur), and those that are indirectly evident to an extreme degree (,atyantaparoksa, shin tu Ikog gyur)}71Now, the defining characteristic of specifically characterized phenomena is that ultimately they are causally effective, as, for example, the color blue. The defining characteristic of generally characterized phenomena is that ulti­mately they are not causally effective, inasmuch as they are objects that appear conceptually but are indeterminate with regard to place and time, just as, for example, the image [of a vase] as something bulbous in the middle and narrow at the base.178The defining characteristic of appraisable objects that are directly evident is that they are to be understood through the valid cognition of direct percep­tion {pratyaksapramana, mngon sum tshad ma), like, for example, the color blue.

There are four kinds of direct perception,Three logical axioms of inference,And various technical terms that derive from these.When all the topics of valid cognition are abbreviated, they are gathered under the three headings of appraisable objects igzhal bya) that are directly evident {abhimukhi, mngon gyur), indirectly evident {paroksa, Ikoggyur), and indirectly evident to an extreme degree (,atyantaparoksa, shin tu Ikoggyur). As for the means of appraisal (gzhal byed), they may all be subsumed under the three [respective] headings of appraisal by direct perception [pratyaksa, mngon sum), logical inference {anumana, rjes dpag), and scriptural authority {dgama, lung), of which the purity is established by three kinds of scrutiny (<dpyad gsum).Dir ec tly Ev id e n t Objects of Appr a isa l [i']Directly evident objects of appraisal include(1) the five sensory activity fields (pancayatana, skye mchedInga) compris­ing visible, audible, olfactory, gustatory, and tangible forms, which can eliminate superimposition through the experiential power of direct perception, an extraneous or non-apperceptive awareness of external objects that refers to the immediately visible [world];243 (1) the sensory activity fields of the six modes of consciousness {sadvijnana,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"mam shes tshogs drug),244 which are experienced through the valid cog­nition of intrinsic or reflexive awareness245 and only with reference to objects of experience (myongbya) based on the consciousness that can eliminate superimpositions through logical reasoning;(3) the aspects of experiential awareness associated with mental states that relate collectively to the sensory activity field of phenomena (tdharmayatana, chos kyi skye mched).1HAlthough there are realists (dngospor smra ba mams) who [additionally] hold that, in the case of a sublime being, the abiding nature of selflessness including the sixteen aspects of the four truths (.sodasdkaravisaritacaturarya satya, bden chung bcu drug), beginning with impermanence (anitya, mi rtag pa),247 and in the case of a buddha, all quantifiable objects of knowledge248 are directly evident, Dharmaklrti has said that the processes of cognition that a buddha experiences are inconceivable.249 Therefore, direct perception, as a means of appraising the [range of] objects that are to be appraised, is said to comprise the four following categories: direct perception of the sense organs, direct perception of mental consciousness, direct perception of intrin­sic awareness, and direct perception of yoga.In d ir e c t l y Ev id e n t Objects of Appr a isa l [if]Indirectly evident objects of appraisal include the physical sense faculties (dbangpo gzugs can)', the sixteen aspects of the four truths, such as imper­manence, the suffering of change (viparinamaduhkhata, gyur bai sdug bsngat), the emptiness of self dtmasunyatd, bdaggi bos stongpa), and self­lessness (andtmaka, bdag med)-™ the selflessness of the individual person (pudgalanairatmya, gang zag gi bdagmed), exemplified by these [aspects of the four truths], and the selflessness of phenomena (dharmanairatmya, chos kyi bdagmed)'™ as well as [the concepts of] identical nature (ekdtman, bdag gcig) and relation of identical nature (tadatmyasahbandha, de byunggi 1brel ba),252 primary causes (hetu, rgyu) or potentialities (sakti, nuspa), the seeds of dissonant and purified mental states (sems kyi stenggi kun byang),253 the activities associated with renunciation and antidotes (spang gnyen),1^ and so forth. These are all indirectly evident—the second category of objects of appraisal—because they have to be established exclusively through logical axioms proceeding from the cogent power of facts (vastubalapravrrttahetu, dngospo stobs zhugs kyigtan tshigs).There are also objects of appraisal that cannot be established through168 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"LOGIC- 169the direct perception of an individual person and require reference to pure [authoritative] sources [see below].255There are three kinds of logical axiom dependent on inference, which appraise and establish these [indirectly evident] objects of appraisal through the cogent power of facts.

For this reason, scriptures of which the purity is not established by three kinds of scrutiny only obstruct or impede certainty because they demonstrate or repre­sent heretical [views]. On the other hand, [scriptures] of which purity can be established by the three kinds of scrutiny contain words of definitive meaning (nitartha, nges don), without resorting to terms that express a flawed convic­tion, the need for a [concealed] intention, and so forth.257The diverse technical language employed in logical reasoning exclusively derives from these basic categories.As far as the three kinds of scrutiny are concerned, [reasoning based on scriptural authority] is not contradicted by direct perception with regard to direcdy evident objects, nor by inference through the cogent power of facts with regard to indirectly evident objects, nor by contradictions inherent in the sequence of [authoritative] utterances with regard to objects that are indi­rectly evident to an extreme degree.Sy n o p sis of Five Esse n t ia l Mo des of Lo g ical Re a so n in g [3*]The third [part of the actual exegesis] is a synopsis of these [categories of logical reasoning] in terms of their five essential modalities.

First, [concerning the detailed explanation,] there are both valid and non-valid forms of cognition.Rejo inders Rec o g nizin g Valid Co g n it io n [if]The former requires a definitive logical axiom, [presented] through valid cog­nition in which the three criteria are fully present. Let us take, for example, the statement, “It follows that the vase, the subject for discussion, is impermanent, because it has been created.” For the antagonist who accepts this statement:(1) the criterion of the property of the thesis {phyogs chos kyi tshutf) is certain because the given evidence “created” (,x) is applicable to the subject of discussion, the “vase”;(1) the criterion of positive concomitance is certain because the given evidence “created” (x) is not contradicted by either the property of the probandum or the specific predicate (gsal) “impermanent”; and(3) the criterion of the distinguishing counterpart is certain because, in respect of the given evidence “created” (x), there is no absence of cer­tainty with regard to the specific predicate “impermanent.”If a given [proposition] in which these three criteria are fully present is to be determined through valid cognition, the respondent is required to answer.Rejo inders Rec o g nizin g Invalid Co g n it io n [iif]In the case of the second, [invalid cognition,] there is no such certainty because [the reasoning] is unestablished, contradictory, and [consequently] unascertained.264Rejo inders Rec o g n izin g Unestablish ed Rea so ning [aa]Among these [invalid forms], first, concerning non-establishment with regard to the proof of the thesis, the defining characteristic of the term “unestab­lished” (ma grub pa) is illustrated, for example, by the statement, “It follows that the vase, the subject for discussion, is impermanent, because it has not"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"174- THE TREASURY OF KNOW LEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEbeen created.” Here, the given evidence “not been created” (x) does not apply to the subject for discussion, the “vase.” Also, in the statement, “It follows that the vase, the subject for discussion, is permanent, because it has not been created,” both the evidence and the specific predicate are inapplicable to the subject for discussion, the “vase.”Again, in the statement, “Taking ‘in many places over here’ as the subject for discussion, it follows that there are peacocks, because the sound of the peacock is heard,” in this case, the evidence is not established because there is room for doubt with regard to the subject of the discussion.Also, in the statement, “Taking ‘this ground over there' as the subject for discussion, it follows that there is fire, because there is some kind of smoky vapor,” here the evidence is not established because there is room for doubt with regard to the evidence.Also, in the statement, “Taking the children of a barren woman as the subject for discussion, it follows that they are noble because they are of a good family,” in this case the evidence is not established on account of the non-existence of the subject for discussion. In all these cases, the respondent should say, “The evidence is unestablished!”265Rejoinders Rec o g nizin g Co n tr a d ic to r y Reaso ning [bbf]Second, contradictory reasoning (gal baigtan tsbigs) is that in which the pro- bandum is established by a contradictory proof. The defining characteristic of contradictory reasoning may be illustrated, for example, by the statement, “It follows that sound, the subject for discussion, is permanent, because it has been created.” Here, although the given evidence “created” (x) does apply to the subject for discussion, “sound,” even so, because the specific predicate is contradicted by the term “impermanent,” the respondent should say, “The logical entailment is contradicted!”266Rejo inders Rec o g nizin g Unascertained Rea so ning [cc]Third, concerning unascertained reasoning (ma nges pai gtan tshigs), the defining characteristic is that there is uncertainty and room for doubt because there are both analogous or compatible factors (.sapaksa, mthun phyogs) and non-analogous or incompatible factors (vipaksa, mi mthun phyogs). This may be illustrated, for example, by the statement, “It follows that the color of a"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"LOGIC- 175ruby, the subject for discussion, is red, because it is a color.” Here, the given evidence “color” (*) is compatible with the red of ruby, but because it may also be applied to other properties of the thesis, such as a white conch, it is incompatible or contradictory. Therefore, [the respondent should say,] “It is unascertained!”267Sum m ary of th e Rejo inders [c]Second, concerning the summary [of the rejoinders made by the respondent to the antagonist in the course of debate]:( i ) If the evidence * does not apply to the subject for discussion, which is the basis of the debate, the evidence is not established.(2) If the specific predicate of the probandum is contradictory, logical entailment is contradicted.(3) [Even] though the specific predicate of the probandum is certain, the logical entailment may be unascertained.If the evidence* does not at all apply to the subject under discussion, even though there is some uncertainty with regard to contradiction of the specific predicate, one may respond that the evidence is not established. If none of the three—non-establishment, contradiction, or uncertainty—is present, one should respond by accepting [the proposition].Eig h t Appro ach es to Logical Entailm ent [i']Moreover, when the eight approaches to logical entailment {khyab pa sgo brgyad) are considered:( 1 ) [Positive] forward logical entailment (anvayavyàpti, rjes khyab) takes the form, “If* is the evidence, it is logically entailed that the specific predicate isy?(2) [Positive] contrary entailment (viruddhavyâpti, gal khyab) takes the form, “If* is the evidence,268 it is logically entailed that the distinctive predicate is noty.”(3) [Positive] backward entailment (hesthavydpti, thur khyab)1™ takes the form, “Ify is the specific predicate, it is logically entailed that the evi­dence is *.”(4) [Positive] counter entailment (vyatirekavyâpti, Idog khyab) takes the form, “Ify is not the specific predicate, it is logically entailed that the evidence is not *.”"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"176 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEIn brief, one should know also that, in the case of four kinds [of logical entailment]—comp rising forward and contrary positive entailment and their negative forms—the specific predicate arises from the evidence, whereas in the case of the other four kinds [of logical entailment] —comprising backward and counter positive entailment and their negative forms—the evidence arises from the specific predicate, and so forth.[Co nc lu sio n]In general, with regard to the reasons for engaging in debate, innate discrimi­native awareness will be enhanced, the mind will be trained in Sanskrit gram­mar and logic, and the mind will be trained in one s own [Buddhist] textual traditions and in those of others.As for the graceful trappings or finery associated with debate, [debate will engender] a clear complexion; pleasant and gentle speech, refraining from verbal assaults that would humiliate an opponent; clarity and sharpness with regard to scriptural authority and logical reasoning; avoidance of idleness and arrogance; avoidance of deception, attachment, and aversion that forsake the path of logical reasoning; and dedication to the well-being of oneself and others, along with the Buddhist teaching.With regard to the similes that illustrate the term “debate,” “debate” is purposefully said to resemble a wheel that cuts off one s own delusions and those of others, or to resemble a mountain that cannot be shaken by the winds of refutation, or else to resemble a child of Munlndra, undeluded with regard to words and their meanings.Then, as for the result of engaging in debate, one s own mind will be satisfied by the increasing understanding that is contingent on the reasons for engag­ing in debate, as well as by its fine trappings, [stimulating] ideas, and excel­lently constructed syllogisms (sbyor ba).

and it has even been suggested that disrespect for the arts is a philosophical tenet associated [not with the Buddhists but] with the Nirgrantha Jains.273 Therefore, it is most important to understand this subject.Although the [diverse] artistic traditions are infinite, all aspects of knowl­edge—not only the arts—can be categorized in terms of the “fine arts of the three media” [body, speech, and mind], fpr which reason scholars have formulated the systematic presentation, oudined here:(i) While mental activity precedes all [forms of artistic expression], the arts of the body {lus bzo) are so called because they emphasize physi- cality, motivated by [mind]. They may be exemplified by the first two items in the series “dancing, drawing, and singing.”(z) The arts of speech {ngag bzo) are so called because they emphasize verbal and vocal forms of expression, exemplified by the third item in that same series.(3) The arts of the mind (yid bzo) [by contrast] are those that are achieved by means of mental activity [alone], without emphasizing either body or speech, and they may be exemplified by the extraordinary knowl­edge (rigshes) associated with processes of thought.274"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"- THE TREASURY OF KNOW LEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEPh ysical, Vocal, and Mental Arts [bb]As to the latter, this comprises the [detailed] exegeses of the physical, vocal, and mental arts.Physical Arts [i']The first of them [the physical arts] comprise both supreme and common [forms], among which the former will be briefly presented and then discussed in detail.Suprem e Arts of th e Body [a ]Brief Presentation [i‘]Concerning the first [the brief presentation of the supreme arts of the body, it says in the root verses]:The supreme arts of the body are the representations O f buddha body, speech, and mind.Among the supreme and common aspects of the arts of the body, it should be known that the foremost or supreme forms respectively comprise sculp­tures, paintings, and sculpted images of the buddhas, which are all repre­sentations of buddha body; the literary works of India and Tibet, which are representations of buddha speech; and the stupas and [various] kinds of symbolic hand-held emblem, which are representations of buddha mind.Detailed Discu ssio n [ii’]The second [the detailed discussion of the supreme fine arts of the body] is in three parts, respectively comprising the exegeses of the representations of buddha body (sku rten\\ the representations of buddha speech (gsungrten), and the representations of buddha mind (thugs rten).Representatio ns of Bu d d h a Body [aa]The first of these also has three aspects:"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"FINE ARTS- 183(i) an exegesis of the defining characteristics, blessings, and so forth of an artist (bzo bo);(1) the iconometric proportions of the images contained [within the celes­tial palace] (brtenpai lha’i cha tshad); and(3) some further remarks concerning the celestial palace that contains them (rten gzhalyas khang).D e f i n i n g C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f a n A r t i s t [im]With regard to the first of these [the exegesis of the defining characteristics, blessings, and so forth of an artist, it says in the root verses]:Artists are skilled and maintain the one-day observances (upavdsa).

Since to criticize the artist is tantamount to criticizing the deity [he has recreated], it is important that faith and respect should be awarded the artist, like that directed towards a deity, or as if attend­ing upon a [revered] spiritual advisor. Nowadays, though representations of buddha body, speech, and mind are bought and sold, the outcome might still be positive when the artists and their patrons bravely assess the value [of their works], determining the price appropriate in [particular] places and times.

of extremely wrathful deities, such as Yamantaka and Vajrapani.317The fifth category represents an [indigenous] tradition associated with the learned and accomplished masters of Tibet that later

the iconometric scale used for depicting human figures which is mentioned in the Wheel o f Time, although it is applicable for the drawing of pious attendants (.srdvaka), it is not included among the categories of iconometric scale appropriate for representing deity [icons].328 However, since the hermit buddhas (pratyekabuddha) are more sublime on account of their [small] crown protuberances, and

For example, in the [ Tantra of the] Ocean ofSkyfarers, the celestial palace is explained to take the form of a lotus flower;409 while in the Sutra of Final Nirvana, among the sutras of the Greater Vehicle, the array of the palace is explained to be limidess.Among the [various descriptions of mandalas] in the tantra texts that are to be applied in practice, there are passages that exclusively describe the palatial mansion {khangbzang), which is endowed with four corners, four gates, and arched pediments in order to symbolize that it is imbued with the purity of the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment {byangphyogs so bdun).410 Such palaces may be either three-dimensional (bios bslang) or two-dimensional [bri cha) in structure.

These measurements are all with reference to the four sides of the base line (rtsa thig)lX}>When precise measurements are prescribed on the basis of the [different sorts of] patrons [who commission these mandalas], it says in an authoritative passage from a tantra text quoted in the [Indestructible] Garland:414A lord of Jambudvlpa, or universal monarch,Should draw an external mandala,Extending in its dimensions from infinity to ontyojana^Elsewhere, Jayasena mentions in [his Commentary on] the Tantra of the Ocean of Skyfarers that [the size of such mandalas] should be estimated in accordance with the particular wealth of the patron:"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Z}6 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE[In this context] it is held that the mandala should measure eight cubits,But otherwise, it is said that, in the case of kings,It should measure one hundred cubits,Half of that in the case of [arhats] in their final birth,416 And, in the case of important persons, half of that again.Those commissioned by merchants should measure twelve cubits,And those commissioned by practitioners should measure six cubits.Secondly, with regard to mandalas that have no precise measurement, it says in the Four Hundred and Fifty Verse [Mandala Rite of the Secret Assembly] :417Although precise measurements and so forth can be made On the basis of the aspirations of sentient beings,With regard to the spiritual accomplishmentsWhich derive from skillful means and discriminative awareness,How can measurements and the like be made precisely!Therefore [the mandala] should measure [whatever is appropriate], Starting from a single cubit,And [possibly] extending as far as one thousand cubits.The lines should be marked accordingly in respect of this [mandala] wheel.Th t Indestructible Garland and other sources also offer similar explanations.

However, it is said in the Great [Commentary\\ on the Wheel of Time [entided Taintless Light]:441In this context, at all times, three aspects should be arrayed upon the sun and moon cushions in the mandala of colored powders because there are gross, subde, and extraneous categories to be symbolically represented. Among these, the extraneous category (gzhangyi dbye ba) refers to the arrayal of the mantra seed-syllables (sngags kyisa bon). The subde category {phra ba’i dbye ba) refers to the arrayal of the symbolic hand-held emblems such as the vajra which are manifested from the mantra seed-syllables; and the gross category (ragspai dbye ba) refers to the arrayal of the images or icons of the deities which are manifested from the symbolic [hand­held emblems] such as the vajra.Nagabodhi also said [in his Twenty Rituals of the Mandala of the Secret Assembly]:441In accordance with one s ability,The seed syllables should be arrayed within the mandala,Or else the [corresponding] symbolic [hand-held] emblems,Or the [actual] deity icons should be arrayed,Either fashioned of cast metal, or in a composite form."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"FINE ARTS- 143Similar passages are found in the Tantra of Embrace and in the Cornuco­pia of Esoteric Instructions.^ Also in the [Secret] Tantra of General [Rites], it says:444An intelligent person, without having [prior] training,Should array the [symbolic] emblems.Even one who has prior training will have difficulty Perfecdy representing all the distinct subsidiary [symbols of the mandala],But if the subsidiary [emblems] are perfecdy fashioned, in detail,They should be held in place for the duration of the rite.Even if the [corresponding] icons are well sculpted,[The mandala] will not hold a great many [of them].[In short], it has been well explained thatThere will be no blessings if the subsidiary [emblems] are reduced,Nor will spiritual accomplishments be attained.So it is that skilled persons should array the deities In the form of their [respective] emblems.[The point here is that] if the forms of the deities are to be drawn perfecdy and completely, it will be time-consuming, and the ritual will not be com­pleted [for lack of time].

For these reasons, the drawing of the hand-held emblems will be highly esteemed.With regard to the techniques employed by contemporary skilled [art­ists] who are of the appropriate standard, it will turn out well and be most satisfactory if the main deity is arrayed as a statue, the retinue in the form of their corresponding symbolic hand-held emblems, and the gatekeepers and other peripheral figures in the form of their corresponding seed-syllables. In this regard, it also says in the [Indestructible] Garland:If the circumstances are inauspiciousThe symbols and the hand-held emblems should be correctly drawn.

Therefore, if CA, CHA, RA, and A [which have convex curves or shoulder strokes] are too long, they will be defective. If d a, n a, and z h a [which have tapering strokes] are too long or too short, they will be defective. If k a, g a, and SHA [which have leg strokes] are too short, they will be defective.

This is but a rough explanation [of how the block-letter script] is to be drawn. One will still have to learn the practical techniques in detail.505Italic Scripts [bM]As for the headless thick-stroked italic script,There were two [original] traditions—those of Li and Den—From which many [others] gradually evolved.With regard to the headless thick-stroked italic script (*bru chen), which is the best of the cursive Tibetan scripts [bodyiggshar ma), the letters are drawn against a large grid [thigtshad che ba), either in accordance with the Li calli­graphic tradition (li lugs), which has long been extinct, or the Den calligraphic tradition (Idan lugs). The latter is so-called either because it was the tradition of Denma Tsemang, or because it “possesses” (Idan pa) an authoritative cal­ligraphic standard.506Then there is the headless thin-stroked italic script (’bru chungt), in which the letters have a similar form but are drawn against a small grid (thig tshad chungba). These headless italic scripts (’bru tsha mams) which [originally] had only eighteen distinct letters (yig ybru), formed the earliest basic transmission of calligraphy [in Tibet], and it was from them that the “punctuated script” (tshegbris), in which letters forming syllables aligned in squares, separated by punctuation marks, [subsequently] evolved.507H a n d w r i t i n g a n d S h o r t h a n d S c r i p t s [cm]The “gentle rounded script” [jam pa zlum bris) developed out of the italic scripts, and it had variant forms known as the “tailed script” (sugpo) and the derivative Baho script (Jbaho), in which elongated tails are accentuated.

That in turn gave rise to the “finely rounded tailed script” (mnyen pa sugskor), and that to the [contemporary] “easy and common letter-writing script” (bde baphrinyigdkyus ma). So with regard to these [scripts], there are a great many different practical traditions (lagrgyun) in different parts of the country.508Presentatio n of Callig raph ic Tec h n iq u e [3\"]Concerning the third [section on the representations of buddha speech, which is a presentation of calligraphic technique, it says in the root verses]:One should proficiently study the calligraphic proportions,W riting surfaces, ink, and pens;One should cherish all major and minor [characteristics of composition],Maintaining neatness, elegance, and accuracy.One should write, without contravening the hierarchy [of the various scripts],Whereby the sacred scriptures [of the Buddhas]Are copied in the block-letter script, and so forth.I cannot digress [to consider here] other kinds of calligraphy because they are limitless.Before one starts to write, it is important to study the calligraphic propor­tions (cha tshad) and shapes (dbyibs) of the letters. In this regard, it is explained that scribes who voluminously copy the sacred scriptures (gsung rab) esteem the block-letter script (dbu can), as well as the headless italic scripts ('bru ma), the “punctuated script” (tsheg sgrig), and the “rounded script” (zlum ris). Scholar monks (dge ba'i kshesgnyen) esteem the “short-tailed script” (sug thung) and the finely executed script (gra ris). Administrators (sde dpon) esteem the “long-tailed” script ('ba'bo) and the “finely rounded tailed script” (sugskor), while other persons esteem the common letter-writing script ('phrinyig). Therefore, individuals should perfect and refine the [scripts] that are particularly useful for their own needs.After mastering [the appropriate scripts], when one begins to write, one should [initially] study the techniques [for making] paper, the writing surface ('brigzhi), as well as vermilion and black ink (;mtshalsnag), and bamboo pens (smyugu), until one has become proficient in accordance with the ancient"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"treatises and the authentic practical traditions derived from them.

Consequently they were ridiculed by extremist [teachers], and householders had no faith [in them]. Therefore, the householder Anathapindada made a [spe­cific] entreaty. At that time, the Teacher granted permission for melodic chants to be intoned as an offering to the [three] precious jewels.

Astrology discloses things to be adopted or rejected From the perspective of relative appearances.The gross apparitional forms of reality or emptiness Underlie the astrological calculations to be made,While the techniques of astrological calculationAre mathematical computations of interdependence or correlation.The point [of astrology] is that since this [science] is undeluded with respect to the mathematical calculations and circumstances applicable in the world of relative appearances, it should disclose without error the things [or courses of action] that are to be adopted or rejected. The well-known [sys­tems] of astrology (.skarrtsis) which maintain this purpose include both outer [non-Buddhist] traditions and inner [Buddhist] traditions,837 and among them here [in Tibet, the tradition] which adheres to the [astrological system] enunciated in the KingofTantras [The Wheel of Time] is [considered to be] the most useful or purposeful.According to this [system of the Wheel of Time], it is important, at the outset, to understand the precision of the inner world (nanggi ngespa): The abiding nature of reality (de kho na nyid kyignas lugs), the emptiness that is free from conceptual elaborations (stongpa spros bral) owing to the contami­nation of fundamental ignorance (ma rig pa), its mode of bewilderment, has been fabricated or superimposed in a limitless number of gross apparitional forms.838 These include dichotomies exemplified by object and subject, or the outer and inner [worlds], and trichotomies, exemplified by the energy channels, winds, and generative essences (rtsa rlungthigle) [within the subtle body], or [the three energy channels of] the Sun, Moon, and Ráhu.839It is this mere apparitional aspect [of emptiness] that underlies the astro­logical calculations to be made in respect of ordinary individuals,840 while the actual techniques or methods of astrological calculation are mathematical computations applied to [ascertain] the interdependence or correlation [of these apparent phenomena].Precisio n of th e In n er World [2']Secondly, with regard to the precision of the inner [world, it says in the root verses]:"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"346 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEThe stepping of the planets derives from the breath within the central channel,But at the end of the four ages, they will enter a state of vacuity.The precision of time arises through repeated scrutiny.The breath (ivdsa, dbugs) that moves within the central energy channel (<avadhiiti, dbu md) [of the subde body] is known as the vital energy of pris­tine cognition {ye shes kyi rlung). Just as the left-side and right-side energy channels manifestly arise in dependence on the central energy channel, the vital energy of past actions {las kyi rlung), which embodies the five material elements (Jbyung ba Ingdi bdaggnyid)> arises or circulates dependent on the vital energy of pristine cognition.841Cycles of Breath w it h in th e Energy Ch annels [a]Dependent on the left-side energy channel {laland, gYon rkyangma) [of the subtle body], [this vital energy] generates the objective aspect [of the subject- object dichotomy] which is nature endowed with “lightness” (.sattvaprakrti, snyingstobskyi rangbzhin)> setting in motion the five peaceful planets {zhigza Inga) respectively through the [progressive elemental] sequence—space, wind, fire, water, and earth. Meanwhile, dependent on the right-side energy channel {rasanaygYas ro ma)> the same vital energy manifests as nature endowed with “motility” (rajahprakrti, rdulkyi rang bzhiri), thereby generating the primal self {pradhana,gtso bo), which is the subjective or conceptualizing aspect [of the same dichotomy], and setting in motion the five wrathful planets {drag gza! Inga) respectively through the [regressive elemental] sequence—earth, water, fire, wind, and space.842 For this reason it is said that, in the case of the external world, the stepping of the planets in a slow orbital motion {dal rkang) and the stepping of the planets in a fast orbital motion {myur rkang) and so forth843 may be correlated with the calculations applicable to the fire element and the wind element respectively.844The number of the years {lo grangs) and so forth after which these planets will enter into a state of vacuity at the end of the four ages [of time] 845 may also be correlated with the inner [or subtle, microcosmic] body, as stated above, in which case a mature adult male, free from ill-health, should be taken as the [ideal] exemplar: At first five mandalas are set in motion through the [progres­sive] sequence of the elements—space, wind, fire, water, and earth—emerging exhaled from the left nostril, dependent on the left-side energy channel [of the subtle body], and each of these mandalas is equivalent to three hundred"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"ASTROLOGY AND DIVINATION- 347and sixty [breaths]. Then, five mandalas are set in motion in the reverse order, through the [regressive] sequence of the elements—earth, water, fire, wind, and space—absorbed or inhaled into the right [nostril], dependent on the right-side energy channel [of the subtle body].Each of these mandalas or minor cycles ('pho chung) is equivalent to three hundred and sixty [breaths], and when all five mandalas are completed, that is known as one major cycle ('pho chen), which is equivalent to one thousand eight hundred breaths. Once these two processes of the exhalation and inhala­tion [of breath] have been completed, in the interval between any two major cycles, [the breath] re-enters the central energy channel.Co rrela tio n of Micr o c o sm and Macro co sm [b1][On this analogy, it is said that] when the processes associated with the for­mation and dissolution of the world have come to an end, there will endure a state of vacuity (stongpar gnas)-, or else when the spheres (mandala) of the planets have come to an end, they will enter into [a state of] vacuity.846 Corporeal beings, after [completing] the cycle of birth and death, similarly enter into the [state of] natural inner radiance (rang bzhin odgsal).847 Such are the points [indicated here].In accordance with this principle of correlation, there are six major cycles [of breath] ('pho chen) associated with the odd-numbered solar mansions (mi mnyampa’i khyim), starting with Aries (mesa, lug), which emerge from the right-side energy channel and six major cycles [of breath] associated with the even-numbered solar mansions (mnyam pa'i khyim), starting with Taurus (vrsa, glang), which emerge from the left-side energy channel.848 Together, these [solar mansions] form the “twelvefold cycle of the ascendant conjunc­tions” (dussbyorgyi 'pho ba bcugnyis),m which is [precisely] equivalent [in its duration] to twenty-one thousand six hundred breaths—i.e., the total number of breaths (rang dbugs) in a single [solar] day.850Therefore, internally, once the elements have completed their course of exhalation and inhalation over two major cycles [of breath], they come to rest in emptiness or vacuity within the central energy channel [of the subtle body]. This is the meaning that accords with the [Buddhist] teachings.In other contexts, in order to induce eternalistic extremists to enter upon [the Buddhist path], this [process] is [provisionally and artfully] presented as if it were due to a powerful “self” (purusa, gtso bo), for whom one single breath is equivalent to one thousand and two hundred human years.851 When two major cycles of his breath have come to an end, it is said that, externally,"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"348 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEone Great Age [of time] (mahdyuga) will come to an end;852 and that in the interval between [these] and [the next] of his [major breathing] cycles, [the breath] will enter the central energy channel [ofhis subde body], while exter­nally the planets will enter into a state of vacuity.Concerning the timing of this entry into [the state of] vacuity (stong'jug), the followers of the Tsurphu tradition hold that the actual calculations pre­sented in the Tantra [of the Wheel of Time] should be taken literally, while the followers of the Phugpa tradition hold that the [actual] calculations were concealed in order that [non-Buddhist] extremists might not understand them, and that therefore [the comments of the Tantra] are not to be taken literally.

This is why, at the end of the solar mansion Pisces {nya khyim), on the thirtieth day of the month of Phalguna {dbo zla ba), in the fire tiger year [which is the last year of the Jovian sexagenary cycle], the exact longitude (longs spy od mam par dagpa) of the planets and constellations is convention­ally designated as an “entry into vacuity” [i.e., zero degrees]. Then, once again from the first day of the month of Caitra (nag zla) in the [fire hare] year of Prabhava (rab byung), [which is the first year of the next sexagenary cycle], the mean longitudinal positions (rtagpa'i longs spyod) pertaining to all the years, months, planets, and constellations newly arise.854The Basis of Astro lo gical Calculations in th e Macrocosm [3’]Thirdly [with regard to the basis of astrological calculations pertaining to the outer world, it says in the root verses]:The inner [world] qualitatively manifested as the [phenomena of] the external world,Among which the solar mansions and constellationsWhich [the planets] traverse took form;And the planetary bodies that traverse them [also] arose.The Sun marks out its [anti-clockwise] longitude through the solar mansions,While the four [terrestrial] seasons rotate in a clockwise manner."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"ASTROLOGY AND DIVINATION- 349The solar mansions of the constellations and the zodiac,Dependent on the motion of the wind element,Also rotate clockwise in the course of each solar day,While the planets demarcate celestial [longitude], through their respective motions.The inner abiding nature of the [subtle] body of indestructible reality (rdo rje’i lus) qualitatively manifested as [the diverse phenomena of] the external world,855 among which, at the outset, the twelve solar mansions (khyim bcu gnyis)856 and twenty-eight constellations (rgyu skar nyer brgyad)™ took form upon the zodiac (go la), the space in which [the planets] make their traverse.

For this reason, Râhu demarcates its longitude in reverse, starting from [the constellation] Pisces (RevatI,Nam gru) and ending with Aries (AsvinI, Tha skar)."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"350- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEFurthermore, since Rahu internally is an aspect of the pristine cogni­tion within the central energy channel [of the subtle body], the nature of Rahu may also be understood through the adamantine meditative stability (:vajropamasamadhi) which destroys aspects of bewilderment with regard to relative [truth]. In accordance with this perspective, correlated to the exter­nal world, while the other planets demarcate their celestial longitude in an anti-clockwise manner, and are weak in power (stobs dman)y Rahu takes an opposite course because it is endowed with the higher power of merit.860Rahu encounters the Sun and the Moon,In the interval which follows the passing of three “seasons.”Since Rahu partakes of the nature of emptiness or vacuity within the central energy channel of [the yogins] own body, and is unobscured and unimpeded in terms of the physical elements, its upper part (yarsna) has [the appearance of] a ball of semen (dpyid kyi gongbu)y formed of the water element, and its lower part (mar sna) has [the appearance of] a blazing seed (thigle), formed of the fire element. Moreover, since Rahu is endowed with a single purity in respect of both external and internal aspects, its body is vacuous, unobscured and unimpeded, like the space element, while its head (vaktraygdong) is black, embodying darkness, the nature of the water element, and its tail (puccha, mjug ma) is red and fiery, [embodying] the nature of the fire element. These two [nodes—the head and the tail—] are the coarsely [appearing aspects of Rahu], which have the power to cause [solar and lunar] eclipses.861Internally [within the subtle body], during the last of a series of three “sea­sons” (try rtuy dusgsum) [each lasting two months], which are respectively named motility (rajas)y lightness (sattva)y and darkness (tamas)y [Rahu] steals the power of the right-side channel through the vital energy of great darkness (mun pa chen poi rlung). Similarly, when the [cycle of the] six elements— earth, water, fire, wind, space, and pristine cognition—comes to an end [after six months], it steals the power of the left-side channel.862By analogy, in the outer [world], the eclipser Rahu (mun can) appears to enter [across the path of] the Sun in the interval between the waxing and waning phases of the Moon [i.e., on the thirtieth day of the lunar month], once three “seasons” [i.e., six lunar months] have elapsed, whether this period is calculated on the basis of a single link [of dependent origination] or a single “season” corresponding to two months [of the year] ,863 Furthermore, when six months have elapsed [on the fifteenth day of the lunar month], Rahu appears to enter [across the path of] the Moon.864"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"ASTROLOGY AND DIVINATION- 351According to [the system] whereby [the Sun is considered to] rotate sequentially through the twelve links of dependent origination (dvádašaňga- pratityasamutpdda, rten 'brelyan lag bcu gnyis), solar eclipses (nyi dzin) inevi­tably coincide with the last day [of the lunar month], which is identified with the link of dependent origination known as “contact” (sparsa, regpa'i rten 'bret).

As for these,(1) The Tantra states that, starting from the mid-summer month, in the solar mansion of Cancer (karkatai khyim)>m not long after the for­mation of the world, when the autumn, spring, Sun, Moon, and so forth were still non-existent, the Sun was born—its birth-sign, in terms of celestial longitude, commencing from the third quadrant of the"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"constellation Gemini (punarvasü, nabs so) or the first [quadrant] of the solar mansion Cancer.

This is because, even though they may investigate [the nature of] phenomena through their mundane discriminative awareness, they lack the spiritual path that is in con­formity with [the attainment of] nirvana, the abiding nature of reality (yin lugs). However, they are also designated as “extremists” or “forders” (tirthaka, mu stegspa) because, in slightly simulating this attainment, they continue to maintain their extreme [positions] (mu) and cling to their [inconclusive] platforms or fords (stegs). Therefore, it is said in the Commentary on theAspi- rationalPrayerofGood Conduct,1037 composed by the great translator Yeshede:In the case of the term “extremist” (mu stegs can), the word “extreme” (tirtha, mu stegs) designates, for example, a ford (rah kha) where a river is easily crossed, or a stepping stone that is reached when negotiating a pool or pond of water. Accordingly, this term comes to refer to the [inconclusive] “fords” (mu stegs) encountered while embarking on the lake that leads to [the attainment of] nirvana, and the “fords” encountered on the path of skillful means, whereby the river of cyclic existence (samsdra) is crossed. Those who main­tain and cultivate spiritual paths [fixated on fords and supports] are called “extremists” or “forders” (tirthaka).Their defining characteristic is that they propound spiritual and philo­sophical tenets which are contrary to Buddhism in terms of their view, medi­tation, action, and result.Classificatio n [ii]With regard to their classification [it says in the root verses]:[Extremists] are o f three sorts:Nominal, emanational, and independently established.In general, philosophical extremists are of three sorts: nominal (htagspa ha), emanational (sprulpa), and independently established (rangrgyudpa).Nom inal Extrem ists [aa]Among them, concerning nominal [extremists] it says in the Sutra o f the Descent to Lankd\\m*"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"As long as the mind engages [with sense objects],So long will there be mundane materialism.While elsewhere in the sütras it says, for instance, that those virtuous ascet­ics (sramanay dgesbyong) who advocate mundane materialism are corrupt.1039In addition, the Vatslputrlya and others like them who hold the psycho­physical aggregates (skandha, phungpo) and so forth to be truly existent1040 may also be nominally designated as extremists, alongside those who are cut off from the seed of buddha nature, maintaining heretical views and imputing disillusionment [with the world] as the bliss of quiescence.1041Em anational Extrem ists [bb]With reference to the emanational [sort of extremists], it says in the Sutra on Substantialism:miWhen one has encountered a wish-fulfilling gem and quartz,[The latter] never appears to be genuine.Similarly, the precious Buddha and the extremist Never appear in a single field.Despite that, one should know that this approach of the extremists Requires mastery of meditative concentration,Supernormal cognitive powers, and overpowering [means].Those inclined to engage [in such practices],Through their discriminative awareness and skilful means,May display diverse emanational forms.Many similar passages are found in die sütras.I n d e p e n d e n t N o n - B u d d h i s t S y s t e m s [c c]Then, with reference to the independendy established [philosophical schools of the non-Buddhists], it says in the Mother.When a hundred itinerant teachers {parivrdjika) came, thinking to seek confrontation, I did not discern them to have even a single positive teaching.And so on.400 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Detailed Exegesis of No n-Bu d d h ist System s [b]Thirdly, the detailed exegesis [of the non-Buddhist systems] presents [the views] of the meditators (dhyayi, bsam gtan pa), the dialecticians (tdrkika, rtoggepa), and, incidentally, of the barbarians (mleccha, kla klo), which are all to be rejected.Meditators [i]Among them, as to the first [it says in the root verses]:The last of these [the independently established extremist schools] include meditators Who possess the fivefold supernormal cognitive powers.With regard to the last of these aforementioned categories, the indepen­dently established [extremist schools] (svatantrikatirthaka, mu stegs rang rgyudpa), their spiritual and philosophical systems, which are to be explained here, include both those of the meditators and the dialecticians.Among them, the former possess the five supernormal cognitive powers {pancdbhijnd, mngon shes Inga) associated with formless meditative concen­tration, as suggested in the [poetic] words of the master Sura, “The great hermit sage, endowed with five supernormal cognitive powers.”1043It is explained in the extensive Interlinear Commentary on the Compen­dium of the Nucleus of Pristine Cognition,1044 in the Flame of Dialectics, and so forth that the extremists include three types of meditator—lower, middling, and superior—who respectively have the ability to recollect thirty, sixty, and ninety aeons of time.

In general, three such subdivisions are identified in the Compendium of the Nucleus of Pristine Cognition, comprising the Advo­cates of the [Three] Attributes [traigunya,yon tan [gsum] canpa), the Samkhya (grangs can pa) and the Brahmana (tshangs pa \\ba\\). However, according to the Flame of Dialectics (Tarkajvdld), they fail into four categories, including the Samkhya [grangs canpa), the Vaisesika (bye bragpa), the Vedantaupanisadika [rigs byed kyi mtha gsang bapa), and the Mlmamsaka [spyodpa can).According to the Tantra of the Wheel of Time, there are six categories of extremist, including the Brahmana, the Ai^varya [dbangphyugpa), the Vaisnava [khyab jug pa), the Lokayatika [[jig rten] rgyang ’phen pa), the Nirgrantha Jains [gcer bupa), and, in another context, the Samkhya.Then, according to the eloquent textual tradition of the Sakya school,1045 there are nine categories, including five eternalist schools—Samkhya, Barhaspatya [phur bu pa), Vaisesika, Naiyayika [rig pa can pa), and the Nirgrantha Jains—along with four nihilist schools, namely, the Carvaka [tshu rol mdzes pa), the Mlmamsaka, the Vedantaupanisadika, and those [Advaitavedantins] who simulate the approach of Madhyamaka [dbu mai tshuldu smra ba).m6Yet again, in the Ornamental Flower of Philosophical Systems, composed by Chomden Rigpei Raldri, a twelvefold classification is given, starting with the Lokayatika, and it is his presentation that I have followed below.1047Exemplified by these [diverse enumerations], many [different] classifica­tions are be found in the [different] textual traditions. However, all these"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"MUNDANE SPIRITUAL PATHS- 403[systems] of the dialecticians may be subsumed within two basic divisions— the eternalist schools and the nihilist schools.They are all largely similar in their common adherence to Visnu, Isvara, and Brahma, in their adherence to th zFour Vedas as [the revelatory source of] their teachings, in their propounding of the [concepts of] “soul” (atmavada, bdagsmras byedpa) and eternally existing entities (nityabhava, rtagdngos), in their inclusion of livelihood or the means of [mundane] sustenance among their tenets, in their polemics directed against the Buddhist tradition, and so forth.[In short,] all these categories of extremist take refuge in those three [Brahmanical] deities, they uphold [the authority of] the Four Vedas, and they propound [the existence of] a “soul” or “self” among the four primary causes (caturupadana, nye barlenpa bzhi) [of involuntary rebirth in the cycle of existence], which [from the Buddhist perspective] is the [misconception] that generally underlies all the other [three] primary causes.1048 This is because even the mundane materialists uphold [the existence of] a “soul” or “self” comprising the four elements and formed of a single substance.Classificatory Presentation [bb]The Nih ilist Sch o o l [i']Among all these [twelve] schools [identified by Chomden Rigpei Raldri], the Lokáyatika (rgyang ’pken pa) are so called because, in holding that past actions {karma, las) have no result, they have “deviated far” {rgyang ring du songba) from the genuine view as understood by worldly persons [in general].In antiquity, during the legendary battles between the gods {deva) and the antigods {asura), the gods, being of a naturally virtuous disposition, were dis­inclined to fight and consequendy they were nearly defeated in battle. At that time, the hermit sage Brhaspati composed and revealed a text on the nihilist view {chadpar Ita ba!igzhung), in order to induce the gods to fight, with the result that the gods grew confident and emerged victorious in the battle.Later, hesitating to propagate this negative view in the god realms, Brhaspati threw the book into the River Ganges, where it was retrieved by a hermit sage [Valmlki] and propagated in India. Derived from it, [new treatises] were compiled—the primary text by the hermit sage Lokáksin (’Jig rten mig) and its commentary by Avatárabalin (’Jugstobs [can]).1049 Their followers [during the lifetime of Sakyamuni Buddha] were known as the six nihilist teachers who were masters of meditative absorption {chadsmrai ston pa snyoms ’jugpa"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"404 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEdrug) y the six who emulated them (rjessgrogspa drug) y and the six dialecticians or teachers (rtoggepadm ston pa drug)}mMoreover, it is said that the hermit sage Avatârabalin wished to engage in sexual intercourse with his own daughter, and set out to do so. [To vindicate his incestuous intention,] he established four kinds of proof (.sgrub pa bzhi) and five kinds of refutation {dgagpa lnga).mx [The four kinds of proof are as follows:](1) There is an indiscernible soul or self [avyaktdtma, migsal bai bdag) existing when the elements are in their causative or formative state.(2) There is a discernible soul or self {vyaktdtma, gsal bai bdag) existing when the elements are in their resultant or fruitional state.(3) There are three classes of sentient beings—the enumeration of six classes being incorrect because the gods {deva), anguished spirits {prêta), and denizens of the hells (;naraka) do not exist. The three that do exist include human beings and animals which are discernible. They also include animistic spirits ofwoods, trees, and so forth, composed of the four indiscernible elements, in which the faculty of consciousness has not yet expired.(4) Although they themselves do not uphold [the deductions of] logical inference {anumdna, rjes dpag), they [seek to] establish a reasoned argument which could be communicated to others in logical terms, such as the following [syllogism]: “The [concept] vase, the subject for discussion, may denote sentient beings in whom the physical body and the mind are of a single [material] substance, and it may signify any [actual] vase whatsoever, because it is a material object distinct from the lily [it contains], just as is, for example, a wall [that has a vase upon it].1052As for their five kinds of refutation:(1) They profess that causes and so forth which are not visible are non­existent because the [diverse] states of sorrow and happiness inherently originate in themselves, just as, for example, a pea is round, a thorn sharp, and so forth. Therefore they deny the existence of past and future lives.(2.) They deny the processes of past actions, causes and results.( 3 ) They deny the three precious jewels.(4) They deny that there are invisible phenomena.(5) They deny the valid cognition of logical inference."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"M UNDANE SPIRITUAL PATHS - 40$Since these [mundane materialists] hold the basest of all [philosophical] views, they are [regarded as] the lowest of all those propounding spiritual and philosophical systems; and they are the most severely [deluded] among deluded beings. Let us not even mention [the possibility of them aspiring to] liberation [from cyclic existence]! Since they lack the causal basis for attaining simply a physical body compatible with the exalted realms (svarga, mtho ris) [of gods and humans], the result that they accrue is exclusively compatible with the inferior realms (durgati, ngan gro).The Eternalist Schools [2’]Secondly, there follows the description of the eternalist schools.Sam khya [a]The first of the eternalist schools is the Samkhya, [on which it says in the root verses]:The oldest of all the eternalist schools is the Samkhya,Who through three modes of valid cognition Appraise the twenty-five aspects of reality.In particular, they hold that the “self?’Endowed with five [characteristics],Relates to the fundamental state of “nature,”[Identified with] primal matter in which the three attributes Are in a state of equilibrium,And from which evolves the “[great] intelligence.”From that in turn the ego principle evolves,Along with the five aspects of subtle matter,The motor organs, the sense organs, and the mind.As they unfold in series, they give rise to cyclic existence,But if these modifications are reversed,The “self” will attain release.The oldest of all the eternalist schools among the extremist [traditions] is the Samkhya.

In order to reveal to others the reality which he had seen, he composed the Treatise on the Categories of Reality}™ Later, the hermit sage Patanjali who was a practitioner of yoga, upholding the Shaivite tradition, reworked the Thirty Chapter and Six Chapter Tantras oflsvarakrsna, 105S and so forth, for which reason he is held to be their teacher, but, as it is said in the Introduction to Madhyamaka:1056Through minor variations on this theme,The extremists form their different traditions.Accordingly, there were many different traditions that evolved from this [school].With regard to the tenets of the [Samkhya school],1057 the valid cogni­tion of direct perception {pratyaksapramdna) is held to apply to the sense organs, while inference for one s own sake {svdrthdnumdna) entails seven kinds of relation [saptasambandhana), including the relation of implication {arthapattisambandhana, nor bdaggi ’brel ba),m* and inference for the sake of others (pardrthanumdna) may include both [syllogisms in which the infer­ence] is based on yoga and those employing elimination {bsal ba). In this way, they hold that through these three modes of valid cognition, appraisable objects will be discerned in terms of the “twenty-five categories of reality” (pancavimsatitattva, de nyid nyer Inga).The twenty-five categories [of reality] are enumerated as follows: (i) pri­mal matter {pradhana, gtso bo)\\ (2) great intelligence (mahat/buddhi, chen po/blo)\\ (3) the threefold ego-principle (ahamkara, nga rgyalgsum)\\ (4-8) the five potentials of subtle matter (pancatanmatra, de tsam Inga), namely, sound-potential, touch-potential, color-potential, taste-potential, and smell- potential; (9-13) the five elements {pancabhuta, ’byungpo Inga), including space; (14-18) the five inner sense organs [pancantarendriya, nangblo’i dbang po Inga), namely, ear, skin, eye, tongue, and nose; (19-23) the five motor organs (pancabahyendriya, phyi las kyi dbang po Inga), namely, speech, handling, walking, excretion, and reproduction; (24) the mind (manas, yid), which is a faculty shared by both [categories of sense organs], bringing the number of sense organs up to eleven; and (25) the “soul” (dtma, bdag) or “cognizant self ” ipurusa, shes riggi skyes bu).When these are all subsumed, they may be gathered into two categories, primal matter and cognizant “self” the former comprising nature (prakrti, rangbzhin) and the latter the absence of nature {aprakrti, rangbzhin min pa).Among them, with regard to the “self” its essential nature is both that of an"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"M UNDANE SPIRITUAL PATHS- 407actor or creator and a consumer. It is said to be a consumer in the sense that it enjoys or partakes of its sense objects. It is [regarded as] permanent because it cannot be destroyed, nor is it created because nothing has produced it. It is devoid of the threefold attributes—lightness (.sattva, snying stobs), motility [rajas, rdul), and dullness [tamos, munpa). It is free from activity because it permeates all space and time. In short, it is endowed with all those five distinc­tive or defining characteristics. [Therefore] it is known as the [unchanging] soul or self that is cognizant of the nature of primary [matter], subject to various changes.Then, with regard to the essential nature of primal matter in general, the term “primal matter” [pradhana,gtso bo) is employed as a general term encom­passing all twenty-four categories [of reality] distinct from the self. In terms of the dichotomy between sense objects and their subject, it refers to the sense objects, their [three] attributes [triguna,yon tangsum), and physical matter. More specifically, primal matter at the causal level [hetupradhâna, rgyuigsto bo) is identified with nature [prakrti, rangbzhin), the first of the twenty-five categories. It is the circumstance in which die three attributes—motility, dull­ness, and lightness—are present in a state of equilibrium.The defining characteristic of these three [attributes] is that [motility] is dynamic and interactive, [dullness] is heavy and obstructive, and [lightness] is light and luminous. This [equilibrium] is said to be an ideal state [of homo­geneity] [prakarana, rab tu byedpa), because it is [the actual state of] “nature” itself, not subject to modifications or change.From this primal matter, there [first] originated “intelligence” (buddhi, bio), which is designated as “great” [mahat, chen po). From that, the three­fold ego-principle originated;1059 and from it there evolved in succession the five quidities or aspects of subtle matter from the modified ego-principle [vaikârikâhamkâra),mo and the five gross elements from those five aspects. Meanwhile, the five motor organs and the five sense organs, along with the single category of the mind [manas,yid), which is a faculty shared by both [motor and sense organs], all evolved from the ego-principle imbued with lightness [sâttvikâhamkâra). As for the ego-principle imbued with dull­ness [tdmasikâhamkâra), it interacts with both the other two aspects of the ego-principle.The [great] intelligence, the ego-principle, and the five aspects of subtle matter all are all modifications when contrasted with the [original and unmod­ified] nature. On the other hand, from the standpoint of their actual modifica­tions, the great intelligence, the ego-principle, and so forth are assigned to the [unmodified] nature, and only the remaining sixteen categories [comprising"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"408 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEthe five elements, the five sense organs, the five motor organs, and mind] are considered to be [extraneous] modifications.The “soul” or “cognizant self” being ignorant of the impurity of “nature” which gives rise to [the aforementioned] modifications, then becomes attached through a series of events, and as long as it enjoys or partakes of the sense objects, such as sound, and so forth, it will remain within the cycle of existence. But when it becomes dissatisfied with such enjoyments of the sense objects, through the supernormal cognitive powers associated with meditative concentration {dhyana), it will [directly] behold the impurity of this engagement in “nature” and flee away in shame. Separated from [this involvement], all the modifications produced by nature will be reversed in turn, and dissolve into the reality [of unmodified nature] itself.

However, once the six categories that pertain to the “individual” {purusa,skyes bu) are known, the nine attributes and their roots will be cut off, leaving the “self” or “soul” alone, whereupon it will be released [from the cycle of existence].Naiyayika [c]Thirdly, the Naiyayika {rig pa can pa) are similar [to the Vaisesika] in holding that there are six phenomenological categories. They also uphold the four kinds of valid cognition, namely, (i) the valid cognition of direct perception, through which objects encountered by the senses are unmistakenly examined; (2-3) the two kinds of inference, which are undertaken for ones own and others’ sake; and (4) the valid cognition originating from Vedic testimony, proffering examples which virtually appraise the scriptural testimony [of the Vedas] on the basis of trust.They hold that if there is an appraisable object, it is implicitly an entity (<bhava, dngospo), and they do not accept that it may be a non-entity [abhava, dngos med).

He himself is also [said to have] exhibited an extraordinary manifest pride, in saying, “I am fire, water, and wind. I am also the [bestower of] food and drink, and the lord of all living creatures. I abide within the physical body of a Brahmin. I am the actor and also the giver!”1071The adherents [of this system] respect the legends composed around the [celebrated] ten incarnations (dasavatara, jug pa bcu) [ofVisnu], and they maintain either eternalist or nihilist views.Now [among the ten incarnations], it is said that (1) Visnu incarnated [first] as Matsya (nya bo che), “the great fish,” and retrieved the Four Vedas, which had sunk into the ocean on account of a primeval [flood].

Yet they also propound the nihilist view, which may be exemplified by the many verses [in their own scriptures] concerning the view of non-existence, [particularly] at the time when Visnu was [on the verge of] being defeated in battle [with the antigods]; and also by the passages from the Ornament of the Madhyamaka, which explain that the view of the Vaisnava is partly in conformity with Madhyamaka.1074In terms of meditation, the Vaisnava engage in the yoga of the six branches {.sadangayoga) and so forth.1075Moreover, their subdivisions include the Mlmamsaka (spyodpa po), theMUNDANE SPIRITUAL PATHS - 411"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Vaidika [rig byedpa), the Vaiyakarana [brda sprodpa), the Caraka [tsa ra ka pa), and the Aupanisadika [gsangbapa).]076Brah m ana [ f ']Sixth, there are the Brahmana [tshangspa ba), who maintain that the Vedas are eternal, and not created because they are the recollections of Brahma, and as such they represent a valid form of cognition [in their own right]. They hold that those who die in battle will be reborn in exalted realms, that negative actions can be cancelled out by bathing in [sacred rivers] such as the Ganges, and that the whole world and its living organisms were created by Brahma.

This has three parts: a brief presentation, a detailed explanation, and a synopsis.Brief In t r o d u c t io n [a]First, concerning the brief presentation [it says in the root verses]:The god [realms] and the [worlds of] Brahma Are within [reach of] the exalted vehicle.In general, the exalted realms (<abhyudaya, mngon mtho) and the level of definitive excellence (nihlreyasa, nges legs kyigo *phang)xm are the objectives to be attained by intelligent beings. The defining characteristics of these are, respectively, (1) the immediate release from the sufferings [of rebirth] in the three inferior realms, accruing the happiness of gods and humans through the ripening [ofvirtuous past actions] in conformity with their [appropriate] causes; and (2.) the release passing beyond sorrow and into nirvana, which is a perpetual liberation from the sufferings of all [classes of beings] within cyclic existence.With regard to these two [goals], initially one has to become secure in the vehicle of the exalted realms, and then subsequently one should attain the conclusive path of definitive excellence. It says in the Precious Garlandf:1101First there are the teachings of the exalted [vehicle],And subsequently the [level of] definitive excellence will emerge.For this reason, having attained the exalted [realms],"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"THE EXALTED VEHICLE- 411One should successively [attain] definitive excellence.We hold that the exalted [realms are states] of happiness,While definitive excellence is release [from cyclic existence].Among them, the vehicle of the exalted realms which is first to be attained comprises both the vehicle of gods and humans (devamanusyaydna, lha mi’i thegpa) and the vehicle of Brahma (brahmdydna, tshangspai thegpa).Detailed Ex plan atio n of th e Exalted Realms [b]Secondly, the detailed explanation has three parts: (i) an explanation of the common preliminaries, followed by the distinctive explanations of (i) the vehicle of gods, and (3) the vehicle of Brahma.1102The Co m m o n Prelim inar ies [i]Concerning the first [it says in the root verses]:Among the three kinds of faith,Which are the prerequisites1103 of all [spiritual paths],It is through the conviction that [the impact of] past actions Is of primary importance, and so forth,And through the four correct ways of progressing [on the path]...The teaching presented in this section is preliminary, to be actually under­taken before engaging in the vehicle of the exalted realms. Yet, as if to supple­ment [the main instructions] byway of incidental commentary, it says in the Precious Garland:1104When the means of attaining this [path] are abbreviated,They comprise faith and discriminative awareness.In order to acquire faith,One should consult the [sacred] teachings,And in order to acquire discriminative awareness,One should [cultivate] genuine awareness.The most important of these two is discriminative awareness,But it should be preceded by faith."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"412.- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONEAccordingly, the foremost of all the means of attaining both the exalted realms and the definitive excellence are faith and discriminative awareness. This is because [in the case of the exalted realms], when one is motivated principally by the faith born of conviction in the results of past actions, among the three kinds of faith, one can effectively adopt virtuous actions and reject negative actions. Also, it is because [in the case of the attainment of definitive excellence,] the roots of cyclic existence are severed by means of discriminative awareness that is non-discursive with respect to the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction].The defining characteristics of these two [prerequisites] are, respectively, that (i) faith reverses, without any special reason, the four erroneous ways of progressing [on the spiritual path], namely, (a) progressing with attachment to one s own affairs, (b) with aversion for others, (c) with delusion in respect of what should be adopted and rejected, and (d) with fear of officialdom and so forth. Consequently, [with faith,] one will not transgress the things that should be [properly] accepted and rejected by means of the four correct ways of progressing [on the path]. (2) Discriminative awareness engages body, speech, and mind while being non-discursive with respect to the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction], whether one possesses or lacks the great compassion that emphasizes the well-being of others.Accordingly, it says in the same source:1105A faithful person is one who does not transgress the [sacred] teachingsThrough attachment, aversion, fear, and delusion—That one is a supremely excellent recipient [of the teachings].Discriminative awareness is that which knowsAnd always engages in actions of body, speech, and mind,Which are beneficial to both self and others,Without being discursive with respect to the three spheres.Therefore, as one should generally know, it is said that if one is not moti­vated by [genuine] faith, one will not progress [effectively] towards [engage­ment in] even a modicum of virtuous activity. Equally, if one does not realize selflessness [with respect to individual persons and phenomena] through dis­criminative awareness that is non-discursive with respect to the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction], one will never progress on the path that leads to release [from cyclic existence].This being the case, the prerequisites of all those who would enter upon the"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"THE EXALTED VEHICLE- 42-3vehicle of [any spiritual] path are the three kinds of faith.1106 When, among these, one is motivated mainly by the faith born of conviction in the results of past actions, [it is clear that] the attainment of virtuous actions by means of the four correct ways of progressing [on the path] will itself be preliminary to engaging in the vehicle of the exalted realms.The Vehicle of Go ds a n d Hum ans [ii]Concerning the second, [it says in the root verses]:...That the ten non-virtuous actions are abandoned,While the ten virtuous actions and their peripheral acts are adopted.In this way, laws are maintained concerning [conduct] to be rejected and accepted,While confused [virtuous and non-virtuous actions]And disharmonious [goals] are abandoned.Those who perfect the path of [virtuous] actions And are disciplined [in respect of their vows]W ill, in the higher reams, attain excellent results,Mastering the ripening fruits that conform to their causes.The mundane vehicle of gods and humans is the means of attaining an exalted physical form through fear of [rebirth in] the inferior realms (<dur- gati, ngan song) and by striving for the result of happiness, which is associ­ated with the higher realms (svarga, mtho ris).mi This is the [spiritual] path suited for persons of inferior ability, which relies on protection from fear and auspicious aspirational prayers. It is the path influenced by [the impact of] past actions, which is in conformity with [the practice of] the ten virtuous actions (daJakusala, dge ba bcu) but which is not yet apprehended by means of meditative concentration (dhydna, bsamgtan)—the actual attainment of experiential cultivation.Since there are no [higher] vehicles that do not engage in [the basic virtu­ous practices associated with] this [vehicle], it is [regarded as] the foundation of all vehicles and precedes them all. As it is said in the Tantra ofHevajra\\imHaving commenced from the ten virtues His teachings are disclosed."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"It is said in the Sutra of the Descent to Lanka that this [vehicle] is called the “vehicle of the gods” (devaydna) with reference to the foremost [levels of the world system of desire] which are to be traversed [through it], but, in respect of its peripheral [attainments], it also encompasses all the [lower] paths that progress to the happiness [ofhumans], experienced in the [world system of] desire (kama[dhdtu\\).xmWith regard to this [vehicle], the view (Ita ba) is [deemed to be] correct in its convictions that there are other worlds and that past actions do have causes and results. Conduct {spyodpa) requires an uninterrupted familiar­ity with practices in which the ten non-virtuous actions are renounced and the path of the ten virtuous and peripheral actions is pursued. Thereby, as a result ('bras bu), one will traverse [the various realms of the world-system of desire], as far as the Paranirmitavasavartin realm, experiencing the conclusive happiness of the human beings of the four continents and the six species of Kama divinities.1110[At the outset] it is important for followers of this [vehicle] to retain the authentic worldly view, which functions as an antidote for the wrong view that past actions have no result, and so forth. For this reason, it says in the Letter to a Friend:1,nIf one espouses the release associated with the higher realms,One should cultivate familiarity with the correct view.Even though an individual may have practiced well,With a wrong view, all that matures will be unbearable.Thereafter, it will be important for them to maintain the ethical discipline (sila, tshulkhrims) which does not confuse the things that are to be rejected and those that are to be accepted. For this reason, it says in the Four Hundred Verses (Catuhsataka):1112Through ethical discipline,Progress towards happiness will be attained.And in the Introduction [to Madhyamaka\\Ll}>Apart from ethical discipline,There is no other cause of [rebirth in] the exalted realms.4 2 .4 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"THE EXALTED VEHICLE- 415If the ethical discipline associated with this vehicle is analyzed to some extent, it generally requires that, motivated by modesty and decency, one should train oneself in the three modes of conduct (spyod pagsum) that are in conformity with principled physical and verbal behavior.

Therefore, with reference to the wide range of the term, as explained by Arya V imuktisena, everything subsumed within the levels of the two higher world- systems [of form and formlessness] is designated by the term “Brahma”; while the path that traverses and reaches that [goal] along with its peripheral [activi­ties] is called the “the vehicle of Brahma.”1118"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"THE EXALTED VEHICLE- 417Exegesis of th e Actual Path [bb]The latter has two parts: an exegesis of the four meditative concentrations associated with the world-system of form (gzugs khams kyi bsamgtan bzhi), and an exegesis of the four meditative absorptions associated with the world- system of formlessness [gzugs med khams kyi snyoms 'jug bzhi).The Wo r l d-System s of Form an d th e Fo ur Meditative Co n c e n t r a t io n s [T]The first of these includes both a brief introduction and a detailed explanation.Brief In t r o d u c t io n [a]The brief introduction [comments on the root verse]:The four meditative concentrations associated with the world- system of form Have both causal and fruitional phases.The world-system of form [rupadhatu,gzugs khams) comprises [the realms attained through] the first meditative concentration (prathamadhyana, bsam gtan dangpo), the second meditative concentration (dvitiyadhyana, bsamgtan gnyispa), the third meditative concentration [trtiyadhyana, bsamgtangsum pa), and the fourth meditative concentration (caturthadhyana, bsamgtan bzhi pa).

Mind comprises the eight modes of consciousness (rnam shes tshogs brgyad), and objectively refers to its given range of objects.66 As such, its perceptual range is the essential nature of [a given] object, i.e., the supporting substance, exemplified by a visual form or sound. Mental states comprise fifty-one aspects such as feel­ing (vedand, tshor ba), and objectively refer to their given range of objects.67 As such, their perceptual range comprises the distinguishing attributes of [a given] object, i.e., the supported qualities, exemplified by states of happiness and suffering, or moods that are pleasant and unpleasant. Therefore, it is said in the Analysis of the Middle and Extremes that mind perceives the essential nature of its [given] object and mental states perceive the distinguishing attri­butes of dieir [given] object.68With regard to the second [the presentation of mental states based on their concomitance with the mind, it says in the root verses]:[Mental states] adhere to the mindThrough their five concomitant [characteristics],Such as their [common] location.490 ^ THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWO"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"It is explained in [Vasubandhus Dissertation on] the Five Psycho-physical Aggregates and in its Commentary composed by Sthiramati,69 that the central mind and its peripheral mental states have a natural concomitance that is acquired through five unrelated factors. That is to say, mental states adhere to mind through their five concomitant characteristics {pancasamprayuktaka, mtshungs Idan mam pa Inga), starting from their [concomitance of] location or support, and continuing through their [concomitance of] objective refer­ent, their [concomitance of] sensum, their [concomitance of] time, and their [concomitance of] substance.70Among these, first, concomitance of support (asrayasamprayukta, rten mts­hungs) means that both the central [mind] and peripheral [mental states] are dependent on a single sense organ. For example, when visual consciousness depends on the sense organ of the eye, its peripheral feelings or sensations also depend on that identical [sense organ].Second, concomitance of objective referent (dlambanasamprayukta, dmigs mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] refer to an identi­cal object. For example, when visual consciousness refers to a visual form, [the peripheral] feelings or sensations also refer to that [identical object].Third, concomitance of sensum (<akdrasamprayukta, mam pa mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] share an identical sensum in the course of sensory apprehension. For example, when the sensum of blueness arises in visual consciousness, that [identical sensum] also arises in respect of [the peripheral] feelings or sensations.Fourth, concomitance of time {kdlasamprayukta, dus mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] are active instantaneously. For example, whenever visual consciousness is active, [the peripheral] feelings or sensations are also active [in that same instant].Fifth, concomitance of substance (dravyasamprayukta, rdzas mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] are of similar class and are identical in number. For example, if visual consciousness refers to a single substance, [the peripheral] feelings or sensations also refer only to a single substance.71The rejection of doubt with regard to [certain apparent] contradictions concerning the concomitance of sensum and time, and so forth, are not dis­cussed here, and these points should therefore be understood from [other] texts.72THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA - 491"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Are Mind and Mental States Substantially Identic al or Diffe r e n t?

He disagrees [with this standpoint], stating, for example, that if mind and mental states were not different in substance, the definitive order of the five psycho-physical aggregates would not hold.74 Therefore, we should follow his position.[At the same time,] he also states that although they are different, this is with reference to material things. It is hard to investigate this remark in detail because he did not elaborate, and yet one should know that this [distinction between material and immaterial phenomena is understood] dependant on both scriptural authority grounded in conviction and logical reasoning, as when the sense organs focus upon sensitive [inner] forms [which are not objects of external sense perception].75Relatio nsh ips betw een th e Central Mind and Peripheral Mental States [cc\"]The third [of these three topics] concerns the relationships between the cen­tral [mind] and peripheral [mental states] that are to be ascertained.

The other [primary and secondary dissonant mental states] do not arise here because they are essentially dissimilar and lack the [requisite] concomitances of objec­tive referent, sensum, and so forth.78[Third,] in the case of the engaged modes of consciousness (pravrttivijnàna, jugpa’i rnam shes), there are two sorts [of mental process]: one in which the conditions are only simulated, as when visual forms are involuntarily per­ceived, and the other in which the mind has precedence, as when they are voluntarily perceived. In this regard, only the five ever-present mental states arise within the periphery of the former [involuntary or passive conscious­ness] because if the other [mental] states were to manifest therein, there would be no such thing as blindness, for example.In the case of the latter [voluntary or active consciousness], there are twenty-three [mental states] which may arise within the periphery of thé five sense consciousnesses (pancadvâravijnâna, sgo Inga mam shes) when they are engaged in virtuous actions, namely, the first twenty-one [of the fifty-one] mental states, along with [the last two], ideation and scrutiny. There are also twenty-five [mental states] which may arise within the periphery of those [five sensory modes of consciousnesses] when they are engaged in defiled actions, namely, the first ten, the “three poisons” among the six primary dissonant mental states, and the last group of ten subsidiary dissonant mental states,"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"494- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOalong with ideation and scrutiny.

However, all the mental states, with the exception of the eleven virtuous ones (dge ba bcu gcig) may arise within the periphery of that [same mental con­sciousness] when it is engaged in defiled actions, while [only] the first ten and the last four may arise within its periphery when it is engaged in unspecified or indeterminate actions.In brief, all [fifty-one] mental states arise according to their respective cir­cumstances. The reasons why they do so can be known through investigation, starting with the defining characteristics of each of them in turn.79Particular Explanatio n of Mental States [iin]The second part [of the account of mental states which are associated with mind] comprises a particular explanation of mental states.

An autonomous object is exemplified by something that arises as an intrinsic object-universal {svarthasdmdnya, kloo'i don spyi) and is not depen­dent on the arising of an extraneous object-universal (anydrthasdmanya, gzhangyi don spyi).*0However, in other [traditions], all [mental states] may be implicitly estab­lished as substantial existents on the basis of their causal effectiveness and reasoned proof, while the [mental state known as] “mundane view” or “view of mundane aggregates” (satkayadrsti, jigtshogsla Ita ba) may even be implicitly established as a substantial existent on the basis of its enduring continuity.81Similarly, there are also four criteria in respect of imputed existents. Among them, existents imputed on the basis of circumstances are exemplified by [mental states] disassociated with the mind {cittaviprayuktacaitasika). Exis­tents imputed through exaggeration, while not actually existing, are exempli­fied by [the concepts of] “self” and the “horns of a hare.” Existents imputed through extraneous [labeling] are exemplified by [the concept of] a “vase.” However, existent s imputed through their parts are the fragments of the phe­nomena which are the basis of their designation and these, [being valid,] are not to be rejected.Accordingly, the master Sthiramati has explained that [a mental state] which has its intrinsic continuity independently established is a substantial existent, while one that does not is an imputed existent.82In this regard, [the mental states that are classed] as substantial existents are twenty-two in number, including the first two groups of five, along with seven [of the eleven] wholesome mental states (kusalacaitasikay dge baisems byung), with the exception of non-delusion, vigilance, equanimity, and non-violence, and five [of the six primary] dissonant mental states, with the exception of [wrong] view. This is because they are autonomous and not dependent on other [object-universals].[The mental states that are classed] as imputed existents are twenty-nine in number, including the four remaining wholesome mental states, along with [wrong] view [among the six primary dissonant mental states], the"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"496 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOtwenty subsidiary dissonant mental states, and the four variable mental states (gzhan gyur bzht). This is because, in their essential nature, they turn the mind towards its object and are [therefore] dependent on specific phenomena which are the basis of their designation.83In brief, as explained above, these [categories of] substantial and imputed existents are each determined on the basis of four criteria, among which, in this tradition [of Higher Abhidharma], it is maintained that substantial existents are autonomous and imputed existents are partial or incomplete.The exact number and the sequence [of the mental states] is established on the basis of supposition, and is not precise. Therefore, in the Minor Transmis­sions (Ksudragama), the mental states are numbered fifty-seven, while in the texts of the mantra [traditions], other sources give other figures, exemplified by the eighty natural [states of conceptual thought] ([kun rtoggi] rangbzhin brgyad cu).Si However, all of them are designated as \"mental states” (caitasika, sems byung) because they are contingent on the mind and arise from the mind, or because they emerge from the mind and emerge dependent upon the mind, or else because they are modifications of the mind, just as the ripples of a river are modifications of the river. Since they emerge immediately in the manner of the sound of a conch shell and the flames of a fire, there is no need [to state] even that they emerge [in a subsequent moment] respectively from their homogeneous classes (sajdtiya., rigs dra las ’byung ba)Classificatio n of Mental States [bb\"]The mental states are altogether said to number fifty-one, divided into the following six categories.The Five Ever-Present Mental States [(i)]Regarding the first [it says in the root verses]:The classification [of mental states] comprises The five ever-present mental states...It is explained in [Vasubandhus] Thirty Verses that:86Feeling, perception, volition, contact, and attention Are the five ever-present mental states."},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 497Among [the five ever-present mental states {pancasarvatraga, kun 'gro lnga)\\ (i) feeling (vedana,, tshor ba) and (i) perception (samjnd, dushes) are both similar in their essential nature to the corresponding aggregates, apart from [certain] general and particular distinctions. The reason for these two having to be additionally included among the mental states is that they are the roots of disputation, foremost among the causal bases [of the continuity] of cyclic existence—feeling is the basis on which the laity engage in disputa­tions concerning sentiments of happiness and sorrow, while perception is the basis on which renunciant monks engage in disputations concerning different views. (3) Volition (cetana, semspa) is a modification of the mind, occurring in the circumstances when the mind is propelled towards its object. (4) Contact (.sparsa, regpa) is die imposition or confirmation of [certain] modifications of the sense faculties [through the preclusion of others], in conformity with feelings of happiness and sorrow, whenever sense objects, faculties, and con­sciousness interact. (3) Attention (manaskdra, yid byed) is the apprehension of details, through which the mind focuses repeatedly on its object.87If any one of these five [ever-present mental states] is absent, the process through which the mind focuses on its object will be incomplete. They are designated as “ever-present” because they shadow all aspects of consciousness assumed by the central mind, compounded by [all sentient beings within] the three world-systems.88The Five Object-Deter m in in g Mental States [(2)]With regard to the second [category, it says in the root verses]:... The five object-determining mental states...It is said in the Thirty Verses:89Will, resolve, mindfulness, meditative stability, and discriminative awarenessAre the five object-determining sensa that arise.Among [these five object-determining mental states {pancavisayaniyata,, yul nges Inga)], (6) will (chanda, dun pa) is the striving towards a conceived objective; (7) resolve {adhimoksa, mospa) is the focusing exclusively on an ascertained object; (8) mindfulness (smrti, dranpa) is the non-forgetting of"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"498 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW Oan object with which one has experience or familiarity; (9) meditative stabil­ity (samadhi, ting nge dzin) is the one-pointed mental focus on an object to be investigated, such as the coarse and quiescent [objects of higher insight]90 and the four truths;91 and (10) discriminative awareness {prajnd, shes mb) is the analysis of specific and general defining characteristics.92These are all designated as “object-determining mental states” because they determine their objects, which are [respectively] conceived, ascertained, expe­rienced, and investigated, without the mind grasping anything apart from these objects.The Eleven Wholesom e Mental States [(3)]With regard to the third [category, it says in the root verses]:... The eleven wholesome mental states...It is said in the Thirty VersesPFaith, conscience, shame, non-attachment, non-hatred, non-delusion, Perseverance, refinement, vigilance, equanimity, and non-violence: These eleven are wholesome mental states.As for [these eleven wholesome mental states (ekadasakuialacaitasika,, dge ba’i sems byung bcugcig)], (11) faith {sraddha, dad pa) has three qualities— conviction, serenity, and eagerness; (11) conscience {hri, ngo tsha shes pa) is the means of avoiding inadmissible or censurable offences with reference to oneself; (13) shame {apatrdpya, khrelyod) is the means of avoiding those [offences] with reference to others; (14) non-attachment (alobha, ma chags pa) is the manifest absence of clinging to the five psycho-physical aggregates, which are compulsively acquired, and to mundane resources; (15) non-hatred (advesa, zhe sdang medpa) is the absence of enmity with regard to inimical objects; (16) non-delusion (amoha, gtimugmedpa) is the absence of delusion with regard to the practices that are to be adopted and those that are to be rejected; (17) perseverance (virya,, brtson ’grus) is the non-relaxation of enthu­siasm for virtuous actions; (18) refinement [prairabdhi, shin sbyangs) is the ability of the mind to engage its object of reference with physical and mental malleability; (19) vigilance (apramada, bagyod) is the means ofprotecting the mind against things that are corrupt and of meditating on things that are vir­tuous; (10) equanimity (upeksd, btangsnyoms) is the means of abiding effort­"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 499lessly in sameness when absorbed in meditative equipoise (.samasamsthdpa) without being submerged by mental dullness, agitation, and so forth; (21) non-violence {ahimsa, mi Jtshe ba) is the means of not harming others owing to the [presence of] the minds compassionate aspect.94These [eleven] are all designated as \"wholesome mental states” and estab­lished as virtuous phenomena, ensuring that a pleasant ripening [result] will emerge through the appropriate ethical practices. As such, they are the causal bases [ofvirtuous conduct], [collectively] named according to their fruitional effect.Disso n a n t Mental States [(4)]The fourth [category of mental states] has two aspects: (1) a general explana­tion of the six primary dissonant mental states and (2) the particular clas­sifications of [wrong] view.The Six Prim ary Disso n a n t Mental States [(a)]With regard to the former [it says in the root verses]:. . .

These include the view that the Tathagata continues to exist after passing into [final] nirvana, which is said to be a deluded view, other than the truth; and similarly the views that he does not continue to exist, that he both continues and does not continue to exist, and that he neither continues nor does not continue to exist. Thus there are four [unspecified] views with reference to [his] attainment of [final] nirvana.This subcategory also includes four extreme views with reference to future lives, namely, that the self and the world are finite, infinite, both, or neither; as well as four extreme views with reference to past lives, namely, that the self and the world are eternal, not eternal, both eternal and not eternal, and neither eternal nor not eternal. The first position in each of these distinct tetralemmas represents the eternalist view of the Samkhya. The second posi­tion in each tetralemma represents the nihilist view of the Lokayatika. The third position in each tetralemma represents the view of the Nirgrantha Jains that nature [prakrti) is permanent and its actual circumstances impermanent. The fourth position in each of the tetralemmas represents the view of the Vatslputrlya that nothing at all can be expressed with regard to permanence and impermanence.103In addition, [this subcategory] also includes the view that the vitality or life-force is to be identified with the physical body, and the view that the vitality or life-force and the physical body are independent of one another."},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"Thus there are [two standpoints] with reference to the physical body and its vitality. The former represents the view of the Naiyayika and the latter the view of the Samkhya.These fourteen standpoints are designated as “unspecified or indeterminate views” because when the transcendent lord [Buddha] was asked about them, he said, “Starting from the [concept of] selfwith regard to individual persons, one may know how to speculate [about these matters] but they cannot be established. Therefore, it is not right to investigate these points particularly, and I will not do so!” For this reason, his enlightened intention was not swayed in that direction, and these [speculations] were deemed to be inde­terminate or unspecified.104Subsidiary Disso na nt Mental States [(5)]With regard to the fifth [category of mental states, it says in the root verses]:There are also twenty subsidiary dissonant mental states...It is said in the Thirty Verses:mAnger, enmity, hypocrisy, annoyance, jealousy,Miserliness, deceit, pretentiousness, self-satisfaction, violence,Lack of conscience, shamelessness, dullness, mental agitation, faithlessness,Indolence, carelessness, forgetfulness, distraction,106 and inattentiveness,And similarly regret, drowsiness, ideation, and scrutiny—These are the subsidiary dissonant mental states,Though the last two pairs may be of two kinds.The twenty listed here, from inattentiveness backwards, are consistently classed as subsidiary dissonant mental states (upakleia., nye bar nyon mongs), while the [last] four—regret, drowsiness, ideation, and scrutiny—partake of some circumstances when they are dissonant and others when they are not, for which reason, when they do so, they are included alongside the subsidiary dissonant mental states.Now, with regard to the first of the twenty that are consistently consid­ered to be subsidiary dissonant mental states: (z8) Anger (krodha, khro ba) is the inability to tolerate harmful [thoughts or deeds].

(30) Hypocrisy (mraksa, chab pa) is the concealment of one s own inadmissible faults. (31) Annoyance (pradasa, ‘tshigpa) is the desire to utter harsh words, preceded by anger and enmity. (31) Jealousy (irsya,phragdog) is the inability to tolerate the excellence of another. (33) Miserliness (mdtsarya, ser sna) is not daring to use one s own resources. (34) Deceit {maya, sgyu) is the physical or verbal fabrication one employs with an intention to deceive others. (35) Pretentiousness {sdthya, gYo) is the [deliberate] misrepresentation of one s own faults whenever they are seen or heard. (36) Self-satisfaction (mada, rgyagspa) is the obsession of those in the prime of life, and so forth, with their own prosperity and prestige. It entails attachment to one s own talents, in contrast to “pride,” which entails conceit with regard to the talents of others. (37) Violence [vihimsa, mam par 'tshe ba) is the permitting of oneself or others to engage in acts of killing, beating, and so forth. (38) Lack of conscience {ahrikya, ngo tsha medpa) is the non-avoidance of wrong-doing with regard to oneself. (39) Shamelessness {anapatrdpya, khrelmedpa) is the non-avoidance of wrong-doing with regard to others. (40) Dullness {styana, rmugs pa) is the lack of malleability in the mind with regard to its objects or sensa. (41) Mental agitation {auddhatya, rgodpa) is the reverting [of the mind] to previously encountered sense objects. (41) Faithlessness {asraddhya, ma dad pa) is an absence of eagerness due to lack of conviction in virtuous teachings or wholesome phenomena. (43) Indolence {kausldya, le lo) is the attachment to inferior activities and the lack of enthusiasm for wholesome phenomena. (44) Carelessness {pramada, bag med) is the means of not protecting the mind [from corruption], permitting it to run carefree. (45) Forgetfulness {musitasmrtitd, brjed ngas pa) is the lack of clarity and repeated loss of memory with respect to virtuous objects of reference. (46) Distraction (viksepa, gYeng ba) is the fascination of the mind for any objects associated with the three poisons. It has six aspects: natural distraction {svabhavaviksepa, ngo bo nyidkyigYengba)} exemplified by the consciousnesses of the five senses; external distraction (bahirdhaviksepa, phyi roldugYeng Az), which is consciousness engaging its sense objects; inter­nal distraction {adhyatmaviksepa, nanggi gYeng ba), which occurs in the context of the mental dullness and agitation experienced when one savors meditative stability; the distraction of symbolism {nimittaviksepa, mtshan maigYeng ba), which is the practice of the [sacred] teachings for the sake of the eight [worldly] concerns;107 distraction due to adverse circumstances {dausthulyaviksepa, gnas ngan lengyigYeng ba), which is craving for the hap­piness associated with physical and mental refinement; and distraction due to mental attention {manasikaraviksepa, yid la byedpai mam gYeng), which"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"506 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOoccurs when the mind, without having completed its engagement in one object of reference, engages in another. (47) Inattentiveness {asamprajanya, shes bzhin mayinpa) refers to the mental processes of the afflicted discrimina­tive awareness that inappropriately scrutinizes states [of non-virtue] that are to be rejected and those [states of virtue] that are to be adopted.108All of these are established as the [six] primary and [twenty] subsidiary or lesser dissonant mental states.Variable Mental States [(6)]With regard to the sixth [category of mental states, it says in the root verses]: ... And there are the four variable [mental states].With regard to these four, which are mentioned at the end of the afore­mentioned passage quoted from the Thirty Verses, (48) regret {kaukrtya} ’gyod pa) refers to the subsequent thought of remorse in respect of an action that one has previously undertaken; (49) drowsiness (middha, gnyidpa) occurs when the six modes of the engaged consciousness (satpravrttivijndna, 'jug pai sems drug) are internally absorbed; (50) ideation (yitarka, rtogpa) refers to the [process of] coarse [mental] engagement with the phenomena char­acterized as formative predispositions; and (51) scrutiny {vicdra, dpyodpa) refers to the [process of] subde mental engagement [with regard to the same phenomena].109These four are all designated as “variable mental states” [gzhan ’gyur bzhi) because their application varies according to circumstances and they are unspecified in terms of wholesome and unwholesome [phenomena], without being limited to one or the other. They may be exemplified by the negativity that ensues when one regrets virtuous actions, the virtue that ensues when one regrets negative actions, the negativity that ensues when one becomes drowsy while focusing on virtuous actions, and the virtue that ensues when one becomes drowsy while focusing on negative actions.Form ative Pr edispo sitio ns Disassociated w ith th e Mind [bM]Secondly [see p. 489], the exegesis of formative predispositions disassoci­ated with the mind (cittaviprayuktasamskdra, mtshungs par Idan pa mayin pa'i \\du byed) includes (1) [a recognition of] their essential nature and (2) their classification."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 507Essential Nature [iM]With regard to the former [it says in the root verses]:The formative predispositions disassociated with the mind...This category [of formative predispositions] is designated as “disassociated” (viprayukta, mi Idan pa) because they do not, like mental states, partake of [the aforementioned] circumstances where the mind engages with its object of reference through the five concomitant characteristics {paňcasamprayuktaka, mtshungs Idan mam pa lnga).m They are nonetheless designated as “formative predispositions” (.samskdra, du byed) because they partake of predisposed circumstances.111In this regard, Upa Losal112 and others have held that these refer to circum­stances other than physical form, mind, and mental states. As for [the opinion of] most [masters] of the past, Karma Trinlepa II113 says thatThere is nothing other than physical form, mind, and mental states, but the designations that are imputed with regard to the circum­stantial factors cannot be described as being either the same as or other than physical form, mind, and mental states. That is to say, they are neither established as any distinct substance apart from the triad of physical form and so on, which are the basis of their designation, nor [can they be considered to be] distinguishing counterparts (vyatireka, Idogpa) of those three kinds of entity, physical form and the like. They resemble, for example, a fist that cannot be described as identical with or anything other than its fingers.114Classificatio n [ii\"]Secondly, with regard to [the classification of formative predispositions disas­sociated with the mind], there are two parts: (1) the analysis of twenty-three [formative predispositions] and (1) their synthesis in eight categories.Analysis of Tw en ty-th ree Form ative Pr ed ispo sitio n s [aaM]With regard to the former [it says in the root verses]:"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"508 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWO...are twenty-three [in number].In this regard, there are various extant enumerations and sequences, such as in the Sutra That Reveals the Ten Abodes, where it is stated that there are seven hundred formative predispositions disassociated [with mind and men­tal states], and in the [Dissertation on] the Five Psycho-physical Aggregates, which presents a different account.115However, when these are subsumed principally in accordance with the Higher Abhidharma [of the Compendium of Phenomenology, the following twenty-three formative predispositions are enumerated]:116(1) Acquisition {prapti, thobpa) is an imputed existent referring to the [particular or qualitative] circumstances of which all formative predisposi­tions partake, including wholesome and unwholesome phenomena, although the Vaibhasika regard it as a substantial existent.117(2) The meditative absorption devoid of perception (asamjnisamdpatti, du shes medpai snyoms jug) is characterized as the cessation of the six modes of consciousness, which are non-stable conditions of mind and its mental states, by relying on the state of mind associated with the attainment phase of the fourth meditative concentration.118(3) The meditative absorption of cessation (nirodhasamapatti, gogpai snyoms jug) is characterized as the cessation of the six modes of consciousness, which are non-stable conditions of mind and its mental states, along with the dissonant mental consciousness which is their stable condition. This occurs when a sublime [practitioner] of the Lesser Vehicle, who has mastered calm abiding—his mind reaching the summit of existence—and higher insight, relies on whatever uncorrupted discriminative awareness is present in the mind-stream.119(4) The state of non-perception [asamjnika, du shes med pa) is charac­terized as the cessation of directly evident innate feelings and perceptions, deriving from the mind that has attained the fourth meditative concentration. This is a particular [attribute of] Great Fruition (brhatphala, Jbras bu che), a distinct abode associated with the fourth meditative concentration. This refers to the abode of the so-called “long-living gods” (dirghayusadeva, lha tshe ringpo), who lack the leisure [to engage effectively in Buddhist practice] because they maintain a false view that deprecates [the possibility of attain­ing] release [from cyclic existence] at the time of their death, [knowing that] they would die and transmigrate [away from their exalted state] if perceptions were to arise.120(5) The faculty of the life-force (jivitendriya, sroggi dbangpo) is the very substratum of formative predispositions, sustaining living beings for a fixed"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 509period of time, in accordance with their respective classes.

In the world-systems of desire and form, [sentient beings] appear to have a con­tinuum comprising five [aggregates], whereas in the world-system of form­lessness they have a continuum comprising four [aggregates]. Alternatively, [similarity of class] indicates the interrelationship of bodily parts belonging to sentient beings who may partake of different classes [gods, humans, etc.], assuming different physical appearances, and so forth.122(7) Birth (jati, skye ba) refers to the arising of a [particular] continuum of internal formative predispositions, which precludes [the possibility] of it taking birth in any other form. As such, [this continuum] partakes of a newly emerging [appearance], one that has not previously emerged.123(8) Aging [jardy rga ba) refers to the distinct transformational and sequen­tial circumstances of which this continuum partakes, from the moment of birth through to the moment of death, including childhood, youth, adult maturity, and old age.(9) Duration {sthiti, gnas) refers to the period during which this continuum does not perish, starting from birth and ending with death.(10) Impermanence (anityatd,, mi rtagpa) refers to the time of death, when this formerly existing continuum perishes and comes to an end.(11) Nominal clusters (namakdya, minggi tshogs) are the expressive des­ignations which, although the essential nature of the aggregate of knowable phenomena and the like cannot actually be expressed, nonetheless extrapolate the essential nature of [generic] clusters [of phenomena], such as the eye and ears, or individual beings, such as gods and humans. “Names” are so- called because they are the means through which the intellect symbolically appraises conventional circumstances. “Clusters” are so-called because they combine within them many syllables or many similarities pertaining to their own particular classes.124(12)125 Phrasal clusters (padakaya, tshiggi tshogs) express [meaning] by extrapolating particularities, even though the particular attributes of phe­nomena cannot actually be expressed, as in the sentence, “All formative predis­positions are impermanent.” “Phrases or words” are so-called because through them particular objects are known.

By contrast, the Madhyamika and Cittamatrin apply them as term-universals correlating with the eight modes [of consciousness] (tshogs brgyad), whether in the context of the ordinary presentation [of mind] or with reference to the widest sense of these terms.130The defining characteristic which these three terms [commonly] share is that they are all [aspects of] mind, apperceiving the essential nature of objects and differentiating the essential nature of their respective referents by means of cognition.However, when the [mentalist] teachings are emphasized, or when one refers to these three terms in their narrowest possible sense, “mind,” “intellect,” and “consciousness” may be separately applied as follows:131(1) The substratum consciousness {alayavijnana, kungzhii mam par shes pa) should be exclusively established as “mind” (citta) because (a) it accumu­lates the [latent] propensities or seeds of all the psycho-physical aggregates, sensory bases, and activity fields; (b) it refers objectively to the diversity [of its maturational propensities]; and (c) it cognizes its objects.(2) The dissonant mental consciousness (klistamanovijndna, nyon yid kyi mam par shes pa) should be exclusively established as “mentation” (manas) because it is the cognition that at all times is conceited with pride, imposing egotistical thoughts on clear sensory images, for which reason it embodies arrogance and egotism.(3) The six modes of engaged consciousness (pravrttivijndna, jug shes tshogs drug) should be exclusively established as “consciousness” (vijnana) because they clearly refer to diverse particulars, engaging with their distinctive [sense] objects individually. Therefore, it is said in the [Sutra of the] Dense Array (Ghanavyuhasutra):132Mind pertains to the substratum consciousness,Mentation embodies the egotistical mind.Consciousness is that which apprehends sense objects.Detailed Exegesis [ii*]The latter has three parts: (1) [the exegesis of] mind, which is the substra­tum [consciousness]; (2) [the exegesis of] mentation which is the dissonant mental consciousness; and (3) the exegesis of the six modes of [engaged] consciousness.512 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW O"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Exegesis of Mind or Substratum Co nscio usness [aa]The first of these comprises five topics: (i) the defining characteristics [of the substratum consciousness]; (i) its demonstrations; (3) its objective referents and sense data; (4) its processes of engagement and reversal; and (5) an exege­sis of the propensities (vasand, bagchags) that issue from the seminal aspect (1bijabhaga, sa bongyi cha) [of the substratum consciousness].Defining Ch ara cteristics [in]With regard to the first [it says in the root verses]:The substratum consciousness, unobscured and unspecified,Has both seminal and maturational aspectsOn the basis o f which propensities are [actually] distributed.The ordinary or general definition of the substratum consciousness is that it is the unobscured and unspecified principal mode of consciousness, function­ing as the ground from which propensities are actually distributed, cognizing the essential nature of its objects dependent on both its maturational aspects and its seminal aspects.133Among the nuances implied by the term “aspect” {cha) in this context, the definition of the seminal aspect {bijabhaga, sa bongyi cha) [of the substratum consciousness] is that it denotes the [latent] propensities present within the substratum, while the definition of the maturational aspect {vipdkabhaga, mam smin gyi cha) is that it is the causal condition giving rise to distinct fruitional phenomena.

For, when [the substra­tum consciousness] pertaining to this [present] life expires, it will be revived by the propensities of past actions {karmavdsand, las kyi bagchags) and the propensities of the subject-object dichotomy [grahyagrdhakavasand, bzung dzin gyi bag chags) and then re-engage as the substratum [consciousness] pertaining to the next life.

At that time it is held that the continuity of awareness will also be interrupted.146With regard to the non-virtuous or unwholesome phenomena pertaining to the seminal aspect [of the substratum consciousness], once the antidotes for these unwholesome phenomena have arisen and become steadfast, they [too] will be reversed.[Synonym s for th e Substr atum Co n sc io u sn ess]There are many synonyms for this [substratum consciousness].

It is known as the “fruitional conscious­ness” (vipdkavijndna, mamsmingyi mam shes) because it assuredly ripens and generates past actions and their corrupt deeds; and it is commonly known as the “substratum consciousness” {dlayavijnana, kungzhii mam shes) because it functions as the ground of all things of cyclic existence and nirvana.149The terms “fundamental consciousness” (;mulavijnana, rtsa ba'i mam shes), “aggregate that persists for the duration of cyclic existence” {asamsaraskandha, ’khorbaji srid pa’i phungpo), “link of the rebirth process” (bhavdnga, srid pai yan lag), “maturational consciousness” (vipdkavijndna, mam smingyi mam shes j and so forth, which are known in the context of the Lesser Vehicle, are also identical in their meaning.150Although these terms cannot be differentiated in their essential nature, there are indeed many characteristics that differentiate them on the basis of the propensities.Proofs are also found of [this substratum consciousness] in the Summa- tion of Ascertainmentfrom the Yogdcara Level, established by means of scrip­tural authority and logical reasoning, including the eightfold reasoning [of Asanga].151Pro pensities That Issue from th e Sem inal Aspect of Su bstr atum Co nsc io usness [5”]Fifth, the exegesis of the propensities that issue from the seminal aspect [of the substratum consciousness] includes (1) a brief description and (2) a detailed exegesis.Brief Desc r ipt io n [aM]With regard to the former [it says in the root verses]:Propensities [are analyzed] according to the ground in which they are distributed,THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA - 517"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"518 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOTheir distributors, the distribution process, and their actual content.Detailed Exegesis [b\"]When the aforementioned description [of the substratum consciousness] as being “endowed with propensities” (bagchags Idanpa) is analyzed in greater detail, there are four topics to be considered: (i) the ground in which [propen- sities] are distributed, (2.) the distributors, (3) the [on-going] distribution pro­cess, and (4) an exegesis of the actual content of the distributed propensities.The Gro un d in Wh ic h Pro pensities Are Distr ibu t ed [i\"jConcerning the first of these [it says in the root verses]:The stable continuum [of the substratum], though not clearly [cognized],Is that in which [propensities] have the capacity to be distributed, Because it is concurrent with the [other modes o f consciousness] Which are their [actual] distributors.The distribution of the propensities takes place within the substratum, which has a stable continuum, and not within the six modes [of engaged consciousness] and their external physical forms, which are unstable.

Rather, it is the mind motivating these [actions] that acts as their distributor, enabling their [ripening] results to emerge.The Dist r ib u t io n Process [iiiM]Concerning the third, the [ongoing] distribution process [it says in die root verses]:Even though [propensities] may have ceased,They still have the capacity to generate their results.THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARM A - 519"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"The substratum [consciousness] maintains its association over alongperiod of time with [the propensities] that give rise to the unspecified virtuous and non-virtuous phenomena of the seven [other] modes [of consciousness].

This is because they are identical in substance to the unspecified substratum.However, you might ask, surely this [process] applies not to the diversity of propensities, but rather to the causes of the diversity of phenomena? [One should know that] while [these propensities] are [merely] propensities they do not appear diversified, but when their [appropriate] results are taking shape, they themselves are transformed into the diversity of phenomena. In the Greater Vehicle, this is also called the “profound and subtle dependent origination” (zab cingphra bai rten ;hr el).160Then, with regard to whether the propensities abide in a manner that is qualitatively identical or different [to the substratum], one might think that if the propensities are identical in substance to the substratum and [conse­quently] unspecified, there would be a contradiction in them subsequently emerging from it as the manifold diversity of virtuous and non-virtuous [phe­nomena]; and that if they are different [in substance], the seeds themselves would [have to be identified with] the [diversity of] mind and its mental states, and so it would be implicit that a single individual person could partake of many minds.The sublime [Asanga] has said in this regard that the propensities cannot be described as [phenomena] that are the same or distinct from this [sub­$22 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWO"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 52-3stratum].161 In the Combined Commentary [on the Summary of the Greater Vehicle], [Asvabhava] explains with examples that the Sautrantika hold the mind which apprehends the sensum of an object and the sensum itself to be neither identical nor different. Accordingly, on that analogy, he states that “the propensities and the substratum cannot be described as counterparts that are identical [in substance], nor can they even be described as different substances”'62Lo calization [eeM]Concerning the localization [of the propensities, it says in the root verses]:They become localized by regenerating their own habitat,And by generating [impulses] that did not previously exist.In this regard, although there are different explanations which accord with [different] teachers, the master Dharmapala163 and others have said that if one could think of [all] the classes of the propensities one would be well acquainted with beginningless cyclic existence! For this reason he identified both of the ways in which [the propensities] become localized: (1) their pri­mary function is to regenerate their own locus or habitat [which is the sub­stratum]; and (2.) they also newly generate [imprints] that did not previously exist, as when maturational propensities newly emerge or the propensities associated with what one has heard or studied are newly established.Exegesis of Men ta tio n, or Disso na nt Mental Co nsc io u sn ess [bb*]The second part [of the detailed exegesis of the aggregate of consciousness; see p. 511] is the exegesis of the dissonant mental consciousness (klista- manovijndna, nyon yid kyi mam par shes pa).

Its most subtle latent tendencies {bagla nyalphra zhing phra ba) are reversed at the same time when the substratum [consciousness itself is reversed], i.e., at the end of the continuum of the ten [bodhisattva] levels {dasabhumi). On the buddha level, it is then transformed into the con­clusive pristine cognition of sameness {samatajnana, myam nyidkyiyeshes).167There are many authoritative passages of the scriptures that establish the proofofthis [dissonant mental consciousness].168 The Summary of the Greater Vehicle itself offers six reasons.169Incidentally, if I may digress, there is a passage [in the Treasury of Phenom­enology] which says:170Mentation is the [residual] consciousness immediately after The sixfold [engaged consciousness] has passed.In accordance with this passage, Je Rangjungwa has designated the [resid­ual] mentation [that remains] immediately after [any of] the six modes ofTHE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA - 515"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"consciousness have ceased by the term “mentation that is [an aspect of] the sixth [mode of consciousness]” {drugpai yid).m It is [generally] acknowl­edged that this does not refer to the dissonant mental consciousness, but is, rather, a synonym for mentation (;manas). However, there are some who also refer to it as the “mentation that serves as a property of the dissonant mental [consciousness]” {nyon mongs cangyiyidkyi chos can dugyurpaiyid)}71 It is explained that this immediate mentation must also continue to func­tion, after the sixfold [mode of engaged consciousness] has ceased, as the predominant condition of the uncorrupted pristine cognition in the mind of a sublime being.173Also on this point, there are some who employ similar terminology, saying that the principal [aspect of] mind is the substratum, and that mentation has two aspects, comprising absolute mentation {don dam paiyid) and circum­stantial mentation (gnas skabs pa!iyid). In this case, the former refers to the dissonant mental [consciousness] and the latter to the [residual] conscious­ness that remains immediately after the cessation of the six modes of engaged consciousness.174Exegesis of the Six Modes of Engaged Co nscio usness [cc]The third part [of the detailed exegesis of the aggregate of consciousness; see p. 512] is the exegesis of the six modes of [engaged] consciousness {rnam shes tshogs drug). This has four topics: (1) their essential nature; (2) their defining characteristics; (3) their locus, sense objects, and concomitants; and (4) their functions along with their origins.E s s e n t i a l N a t u r e [T'jWith regard to the first [the essential nature of engaged consciousness, it says in the root verses]:The essential nature o f the process o f sensory engagement is that The [modes of] consciousness, referring objectively to their diversely appearing objects,Arise in conjunction with four conditions.In general it is the case that consciousness becomes localized on account of its [ability] to cognize dissimilar sense objects. The term “engagement”52.6 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW O"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"(pravrttijugpa) suggests that [consciousness] relates to individual sense objects among those that diversely appear, and consequently a clear sensum repeatedly emerges. The term “consciousness” (vijndna, mam par shes pa) here suggests that [the subject] refers objectively to the essential nature of its [appropriate] sense object.This [engaged consciousness] comprises six [modes], extending from visual consciousness (caksurvijndna, miggi mam par shes pa), as far as mental con­sciousness {manovijndna, yid kyi mam par shes pa).Furthermore, each of these [six modes of engaged consciousness] arises dependent on four conditions. Among them, in the case of visual con­sciousness, the referential condition (.alamhanapratyaya, dmigspai rkyen) comprises the visual forms that appear as if they were external to itself The predominant condition (adhipatipratyaya, bdag rkyen) comprises the sense organs of the eyes. The immediate condition [samanantarapratyaya, de ma thag rkyen) comprises an uninterrupted preceding moment of mental atten­tion. The causal condition {hetupratyaya, rgyui rkyen) comprises the [visual] consciousness that arises, dependent on [the propensities of] the substratum, endowed with the characteristic of apperceiving individual visual forms.1'5These four conditions are similarly applied to each of the [following] four [modes of engaged consciousness], namely, auditory consciousness [irotravijndna, mairnamparshespa), olfactory consciousness (ghrdnavijndna, sna’i mam par shes pa), gustatory consciousness {jihvdvijndna, Ice ’i mam par shes pa), and tactile consciousness {kdyavijndna, lus kyi mam par shes pa).As far as mental consciousness is concerned, the referential condition comprises the knowable phenomena which appear as if they were different to itself; the predominant condition comprises, with one special exception, the dissonant mental [consciousness]; the immediate condition is the mental activity preceding it; and the causal condition is the mental consciousness that arises, dependent on [the propensities of] the substratum, endowed with the characteristic of apperceiving individual mental phenomena.With regard to the [aforementioned] “special exception,” the predominant condition of the uncorrupted pristine cognition of sublime minds is its neces­sity to [continue] functioning by means of mentation immediately after the six [modes of consciousness] have ceased.176Defining Ch ara cteristics [2”]With regard to the second [it says in the root verses]:THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABH1DHARMA - 527"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"528 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOTheir defining characteristic is that, dependent on their predominant condition,They perceive the sensory activity fields.As far as the defining characteristics of these six [modes of engaged con­sciousness] are concerned, the defining characteristic of visual consciousness is that, dependent on the sense organs of the eyes, which are its predominant condition, sensory consciousness perceives sensa corresponding to the activ­ity field of visual form, and so on [in the case of auditory consciousness, etc.]. The defining characteristic of the sixth, mental consciousness, is that the central consciousness cognizes the activity field of mental phenomena, which is its own object, dependent on the sense faculty of the mind (mana indriya,yid dbang), which is its predominant condition, and it is [therefore] different in substance from the [previously mentioned] dissonant mental [consciousness].L ocus, S e n s e O b j e c t s , a n d C o n c o m i t a n t s [3\"]With regard to the third [it says in the root verses]:Through the locus o f the sense organs,They refer objectively to their sense objects,And they maintain a concomitance [between mind and mental states].Regarding the locus [of the six modes of engaged consciousness], (1) in general, the substratum consciousness is the locus for the seeds of all [the six modes of consciousness]. Their former locus—immediately preceding that [subsidence in the substratum]—is the immediate mentation which lingers following their cessation; and their subsequent locus which will re-emerge concurrently with mental consciousness [when they are reactivated] is the dissonant mental consciousness.177 Thereafter, the peripheral mental states are the locus in which all the six modes [of engaged consciousness] pursue virtuous or non-virtuous actions, and dissonant mental consciousness is the locus in which they pursue corrupt [actions] and are consequently bound to substantialist [views]. (2) In particular, the [distinctive] loci that emerge con­currently with [the consciousnesses of] the five senses comprise the respective sense organs, such as the eye.It is through these loci that [the six modes of engaged consciousness] refer"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 52-9objectively to their respective six sense objects—visual forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena. At the same time, they maintain a concomitance between mind and its mental states, including the five ever­present [mental states].Fu n c t io n s and Orig ins [4’']With regard to the fourth [the functions of the six modes of engaged con­sciousnesses, along with their origins, it says in the root verses]:Their functions include conceptualizing with respect to objects of reference,Prevarication with respect to objects o f reference, and so forth.They originate in conjunction with conditions, like waves from water.In particular, mental consciousness is uninterrupted,Except in the five [special] circumstances, where mind is absent.The functions (byed Us) of these [six modes of engaged consciousness] are to facilitate the apprehension of their respective sense objects. [Among them,] the five modes of sensory [consciousness] engage in the pursuit of virtuous and dissonant [actions], they engage in the pursuit of the [positive and negative] motivations behind those actions, and they engage in the pur­suit of [the corresponding results] which are imbued with suffering or the absence of suffering.178On the other hand, mental consciousness [only] has the functions of engag­ing in [the pursuit of] virtuous or non-virtuous phenomena and the [associ­ated] actions, whereas the other [five modes of engaged] consciousness also facilitate the complete apprehension of their [respective] results, endowed with suffering or the absence of suffering. The salient point here is that the actions themselves originate, in particular, through mental activity.In this regard, [the most distinctive activities pursued by the engaged con­sciousness are outlined in] the following maxim:179Conceptualizing with respect to objects of reference,Prevaricating with respect to objects of reference,Being intoxicated, falling sleep, and waking up.Fainting and regaining consciousness,Engaging in physical and verbal activities,"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Experiencing activity devoid of attachment,Cutting off and connecting with the roots of virtue,Transmigrating at death and being reborn.With regard to the origins [of the six modes of engaged consciousness], the Sautrantika and others hold that there is no multiplicity of immediate conditions and that each [moment of] consciousness arises exclusively due to a single [preceding moment of] consciousness, because an immediate condition comprising a multiplicity [of immediate conditions] would not be causally effective. However, in this [tradition of Higher Abhidharma], it is the referential condition of consciousness that is individually ascertained, and consequently, there is no need to individually ascertain the immediate condition. Indeed, many [moments of] consciousness may originate from a single immediate condition. Therefore, it is explained in the Thirty Verses that [the moments of] consciousness that originate may number anything from one to a multiplicity [of moments], according to the conditions that emerge concurrently with the substratum, just as waves emerge from water.180In particular, mental consciousness originates without interruption in all circumstances, except the following five which are characterized by an absence of mind: (i) rebirth as a deity without perception, (2.-3) the two kinds of meditative absorption, (4) sleep, and (5) unconsciousness.181Exponents of Buddhist phenomenology explain that in the case of the five modes of sensory consciousness, there are both simulated or proximate con­ditions, as when visual forms are involuntarily observed, and [instances of] sensory consciousness being preceded by mentation, as when [visual forms] are voluntarily observed.182Co m binatio ns of th e Five Aggregates [c c]Third [see p. 477], there is a brief summary concerning the quantification [of the psycho-physical aggregates within the three world-systems]. In this regard [it says in the root verses]:In the [world-system of] desire, all o f the aggregates,Including the aggregate o f physical forms, are possessed,While in the higher realms, they are progressively reduced.In the world-system of desire (kdmadhatu, dodkhams), all [the five psycho­physical aggregates] are possessed, starting from the aggregate of physical530 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW O"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 53*forms, and continuing with the aggregates of feelings, perceptions, forma­tive predispositions, and consciousness.

At this juncture, the many intricate ways of quantifying [the aggregates] should be studied in the texts of phenomenol­ogy. Since these are hard to understand, I fear that my writing [on this subject would be too protracted].183The Eig h teen Sensory Bases [ii]The second topic [of this chapter on Higher Abhidharma; see p. 476] is the systematic presentation of the sensory bases.

These are designated as the “unconditioned sensory bases” {asamskrtadhdtu, dus ma by as kyi khams), included within one part of the sensory base of phenomena (dharmadhatu, chos kyi khams) that is not covered by the five psycho-physical aggregates, because they are not gener­ated by causes and conditions and are not [considered to be] an agglomeration of parts, as is, for example, [the continuum of] past time.Although there are different exegetical traditions, such as the explanation in the [Dissertation on the\\ Five Psycho-physical Aggregates which asserts that there are four unconditioned things (dus ma byed bzhi),m according to this tradition [of Higher Abhidharma] there are said to be eight [unconditioned things].

This is the essential nature that comprises the two aspects of selflessness because it is [characterized by] emptiness in respect of both the self of the individual person (pudgalatma, gungzaggi bdag), as when a “self” with permanent, unitary, and independent properties is [mistakenly] appre­hended, and the self of phenomena (dharmdtma, chos kyi bdag), as when phenomena comprising the apprehended [object] and the apprehending [subject] are both [mistakenly] imputed [to have inherent existence].192There are many synonyms of this reality, including emptiness (.sunyatd, stongpa nyidi), signlessness (animitta, mtshan nyid medpa), genuine goal {bhutakoti, yang dag pai mtha!), ultimate reality {paramdrtha, don dam pa), and expanse of reality {dbarmadhatu, chos kyi dbyings).mWith regard to the fourth, space {akdsa, nam m kba), since things become manifest exclusively through physical form, this refers to anything charac­terized by an absence of material form which is [still] an object of mental consciousness and facilitates or conducts the arising, perishing, and so forth of obstructive matter [sapratigharupa, thogs bcas kyi gzugs). Actually, [space] is not designated as such because it facilitates or conducts [matter] by means of motion but merely because it does not impede the possibility of obstruc­tive matter arising.194With regard to the fifth, cessation obtained through non-analytical means {apratisamkhyanirodha, so sor brtags mingyi ’gogpa), this refers to the [tem­porary] cessation [of phenomena] obtained on account of the insufficiency of the causes and conditions [for their arising]. Even so, the seeds or subcon­scious tendencies of these [phenomena] are, for the while, not destroyed and they are never disconnected because their rejection is not irreversible. This may be exemplified by the non-arising of other modes of consciousness when visual consciousness is distracted by visual forms.195With regard to the sixth, cessation obtained through analytical means {pratisamkhyanirodha, so sor brtags pai gogpa), this occurs when the [spiri­tual] path associated with any uncorrupted antidote is [consciously] cul­tivated in the mind, and all the corresponding [impurities] that are to be rejected cease, without exception. In this case, the dissonant mental states and their seeds or subconscious tendencies are thoroughly destroyed by means of the antidote in question, and the [impurities] which are to be rejected are perpetually disconnected because their rejection is irreversible.196With regard to the seventh, the immovable state {aninjya, mi gYo ba) is designated as such because when one is free from the desires associated with the third mundane meditative concentration and those below it, and all feel­"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"ings of happiness and suffering have ceased, one is unmoved by the eight defects [associated with meditative concentration], and, in particular, one is unmoved by transitory happiness and suffering. The eight [defects] comprise ideation and scrutiny, feelings of bliss and sorrow, [feelings of] mental com­fort and discomfort, and exhalation and inhalation of breath.197With regard to the eighth, the cessation of perception and feeling (samjnd- vedayitanirodha, du shes dang tshor ba gogpa), when one is free from the desires associated with the sensory activity field of nothing-at-all and those below it, and has left behind all sorts of [impurities] that are to be abandoned, passing beyond the very summit of [mundane] existence, the six modes [of engaged consciousness] and the dissonant mental consciousness will cease to function, preceded by the perception that even the perception of moving upwards and the feeling of equanimity will come to rest in a state of quiescence (.santavihara, zhi bargnaspa).mSensory Base of Mental Ph eno m en a [c]With regard to the third [the sensory base ofmentalphenomena (dharmadhatu, chos kyi khams) in particular, it says in the root verses]:The two sets o f eight conditioned and unconditioned things Together are objects within range exclusively o f mental consciousness.Therefore, these are particularly assigned to the “sensory base of phenomena.”The aforementioned eight conditioned things comprise the five aspects [of form that constitute the sensory activity field of phenomena], start­ing with [atomic] forms that are extremely [small and] concentrated {abhisamksepikarupa, bsdus pa las gyur pai gzugs), along with the three aggregates of feelings, perceptions, and formative predispositions. Together with the eight unconditioned states [described earlier], these two [sets of eight], totaling sixteen, are objects exclusively within the range of mental consciousness. For this reason, they are assigned separately and particularly to the sensory base of phenomena.199The Twelve Sensory Activity Fields [iii]The third topic [of this chapter on Higher Abhidharma; see p. 476] is the systematic presentation of the sensory activity fields. It has two parts: (i) theTHE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA - 537"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"538 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW Orecognition of their essential nature, and (2) the reduction [of the sensory bases] into the sensory activity fields.Th eir Essential Nature [aa]With regard to the former [it says in the root verses]:There are twelve [sensory activity fields], such as the eye and visual form,Emerging from the sensory gatesWhere the [corresponding modes of] consciousness arise, Facilitating the extension [of consciousness] to extraneous objects. Subjective and immediate conditions direct [these modes of consciousness] internally While objective and referential conditions direct them externally Toward [their respective] gates that form the sensory activity fields.The “sensory activity fields” (ayatana,, skye mched) are so designated because their environmental role is to “extend [sense perception] outwards” (mched pa) to extraneous objects from the sensory gates (dvara., sgo) where conscious­ness “arises” {skye ba).100There are twelve [sensory activity fields], comprising (1-6) the six inner sensory activity fields {nanggi skye mched drug), such as the eye {caksurayatana, miggi skye mched) \\ and (7-12) the six outer sensory activity fields {phyi’i skye mched drug), such as visible form (rupdyatana, gzugs kyi skye mched).It says in the Commentary on the Treasury [ofPheno?nenology):mThe [Sanskrit] term dyatana {skye mched) [literally meaning “seat” or “abode”]202 is interpreted to mean “sensory gate where [consciousness] arises” {ayadva[ra], skye ba’i sgo).203 The sensory activity fields are designated as such because they are the portals through which mind and mental states arise and extend or expand outwards, dependent on whichever [internal or external aspect of sense perception is applicable].When [this definition] is applied in detail to each of [the sensory activity fields] individually, (1) the sensory activity field of the eye {caksurayatana, mig gi skye mched) subjectively activates the sensory gate where visual conscious"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF HIGHER ABHIDHARMA- 539arises, and (2.) the sensory activity field of visible form (rupdyatana,, gzugs kyi skye niched) objectively activates the sensory gate of visual consciousness. Then, in the same manner, [this dual function] applies to all the remaining [sensory activity fields], since each of them activates the corresponding sen­sory gate where its respective mode of consciousness [auditory, olfactory, etc.] arises, both subjectively and objectively.However, as in the case [of the aforementioned sensory bases], one should know in particular that the sensory activity field of the mental faculty (mano ayatana,yid kyi skye mched) activates the sensory gate where mental conscious­ness arises on the basis of its immediate condition [samanantarapratyaya, de ma thagrkyen), and the sensory activity field of phenomena (<dharmayatana, chos kyi skye mched) activates the sensory gate where mental consciousness arises on the basis of its referential or objective condition [dlambanapratyaya, dmigspa1i rkyen).204In brief, subjective and immediate conditions direct [the modes of] con­sciousness internally, while referential and objective conditions direct them externally, towards the [respective] gates that form the sensory activity fields.At this juncture, you may ask why only the sense objects of the eyes are designated as [the sensory activity field of] form (rupdyatana,, gzugs kyi skye mched), even though the first ten [of the twelve sensory activity fields] all partake of [the aggregate of] physical forms (rupaskandha), and why only the objects of the mental faculty are designated as [the sensory activity field of] phenomena [dharmdyatana, chos kyi skye mched), even though all twelve [of the sensory activity fields] constitute phenomena.In the former case, the point is that a single item [in a group] is distin­guished from the others [in the same group] on account of its distinctive designation [and usage]. Specifically, in this case, only the sense objects of the eyes are designated as [the sensory activity field of] form because they are [held to be] the foremost aspects of form on account of their being both revealed and obstructed [sanidarsanasapratigha, bstanyod thogs bcas).Similarly, [in the latter case,] the point is, just as in the former case, that a single item [in a group] is distinguished from the others [in the same group] owing to its distinctive designation [and usage]. Specifically, only the objects of the mental faculty are designated as [the sensory activity field of] phenom­ena because they include within them many [diverse mental] phenomena, such as feelings, and they also include nirvana, which is the supreme among all phenomena.205"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Red u c tio n of the Sensory Bases into th e Sensory Activity Fields [bb]The latter, the reduction [of the sensory bases into the sensory activity fields], has three parts: (i) the reduction that accords with the physical [sensory activ­ity fields], (i) the reduction that accords with the mental [sensory activity fields], and (3) the reduction that accords with [the sensory activity field] of mental phenomena.With regard to the first [it says in the root verses]:[Here,] the ten physical sensory activity fields resemble [their corresponding] sensory bases.The ten physical sensory activity fields {gzugs can skye mched bcu) are similar in content to the [corresponding] aforementioned sensory bases, apart from the mere change in their designation. Therefore they are reduced as follows: the physical sensory bases, comprising the five sense organs and the five sense objects, which are presented as ten in number in the context of the sensory bases, [here] in the context of the sensory activity fields are also designated as the “ten physical sensory activity fields.”With regard to the second [it says in the root verses]:The seven sensory bases of consciousness are [subsumed in]The sensory activity field of the mental faculty.The seven sensory bases associated with consciousness (mam par shes pa’i khams bdun), here, in the context of the sensory activity fields, are all reduced within the single “sensory activity field of the mental faculty” (mano dyatana, yidkyi skye mched).Then, with regard to the third [it says in the root verses]:The sixteen sensory bases of phenomena are [subsumed in]The sensory activity field of phenomena.The sixteen sensory bases of phenomena, in the context of the sensory activ­ity fields, are all subsumed in the single “sensory activity field of phenomena.”540 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWO"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"5.

They comprise (i) the basic category of apparent forms {snangba gzugs kyi gzhi), (z) the basic category of the central mind (gtso bo sems kyi gzhi), (3) the basic category of peripheral mental states (’khor sems byung gigzhi), (4) the basic category of circumstantial forma­tive predispositions disassociated [with mind and mental states] [gnas skabs Idan pa mayin pai du byed kyi gzhi), and (5) the basic category of uncondi­tioned states [including] cessation (gagpa dus mabyas kyi gzhi).206 The pious attendants hold that all knowable phenomena may be subsumed within these five basic categories, but as Zilung Panchen has said, “One cannot agree that the five basic categories are assigned exclusively within the tradition of the Vaibhasikas because they are also lucidly explained in the Compendium of Phenomenology ”207Detailed Exegesis of This System [ii]With regard to die second [it says in the root verses]:Form comprises the five sense organs, and their five objects,Along with imperceptible form.[Mind comprises] the six modes [of engaged consciousness],And there are forty-six mental states,Comprising the group of ten states found in [all] minds,The group of ten mental states found in [all] virtuous [minds],The group of six mental states found in dissonant or afflicted [minds],The group of two mental states found in [all] non-virtuous [minds],"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF THE LOWER ABHIDHARMA- 543The group of ten mental states found in [all] slightly [afflicted minds],And the group of eight mental states that are found indeterminately.There are also fourteen formative predispositions Disassociated [with mind and mental states], along with their aspects,And two unconditioned states, comprising cessation and space.Although the meanings of these [categories] have already been explained in detail, the structures presented according to the [traditions of] Higher and Lower Abhidharma are dissimilar. Since the system of the Treasury [of Phenomenology ] accords with the tradition of the pious attendants, its prin­ciples and theses have been illustrated to some extent [in another section of this book].208 However, since there is also a need to understand this [text] incidentally, in the present context, I will now briefly discuss it here as well.Basic Category of Apparent Form s [aa]Among these [five basic categories], the first is the basic category of appar­ent forms, which comprises eleven substances—the five sense organs, their [corresponding] five [sense] objects, and imperceptible form. The five sense organs are as [explained] above. Among the five [sense] objects, the sensory activity field of visible forms (rüpáyatana, gzugs kyi skye mched) , comprising the sense objects of the eye, includes both color and shape:209When these are differentiated there are twenty aspects:Blueness, yellowness, whiteness, redness,Light [of the moon and stars], darkness, cloud,Smoke, dust, mist, sunlight, and shadow,Along with the long, the short, the square, the round,The high, the low, the even, and the uneven.The first twelve of these are [classed as] colors [and shades] —Four of them are primary colorsAnd eight are particular or secondary aspects [of shade].The last eight items [in the list] are [classed as] shapes.210Sounds (.sabda} sgra) comprise both organically produced sounds [such as human sounds] and inorganically produced sounds [such as rustling trees]."},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"544 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW OThese become four because each [of the two] types includes [sounds] capable of signifying their object and the opposite, and they become eight because each of these [four types] includes sounds that are pleasant and unpleasant.2'1Odors {gandha, dri) include both those that are fragrant and strong, and each of these is differentiated on the basis of whether [it evokes] a neutral [feeling] or one that is not neutral.212Tastes {rasa, ro) include the six essential types, namely, those that are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, spicy, and astringent.213Tangibles {sprastavya, reg bya) are eleven in number, comprising the four primary elements, which are [classed as] causal tangibles {rgyui reg bya), and the seven [sensations of] softness, roughness, heaviness, lightness, hunger, thirst, and coldness, which are [classed as] fruitional tangibles {'bras bui reg bya).mImperceptible forms {avijñaptirüpa, mam min gyigzugs) are those forms belonging to the sensory activity field of phenomena, which arise during [distracted periods of] apperception and during any meditative stability, whether virtuous or non-virtuous, [providing continuity of experience,] and which have the characteristics of imperceptible universals. When classified, they comprise both [imperceptible forms] that originate during [distracted] apperception and those that originate during meditative stability. The former includes three types: [distracted apperceptions] that are disciplined, undisci­plined, or neutral; while the latter includes two types: [periods of] meditative concentration and [periods of] uncorrupted discipline {zagmed kyi sdompa).Here, “disciplined” {sdompa) implies virtuous [states], “undisciplined” {sdom min) implies non-virtuous [states], and “neutral” {barma) implies any unspecified virtuous or non-virtuous state. The causal bases of these [imper­ceptible forms] are the four primary elements, as [explained] above.215Basic Category of th e Central Mind [bb]The second is the basic category of the central mind, which refers to the six modes [of engaged consciousness], commencing from visual consciousness and continuing through to mental consciousness.B a s i c C a t e g o r y o f P e r i p h e r a l M e n t a l S t a t e s [c c]The third is the basic category of peripheral mental states, which partake of the following five classes:"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF THE LOWER ABHIDHARMA - 545(1) The group often mental states that are found in all minds (dasacitta- mahabhumika, sems kyi sa mangpo bcu) comprises216Feeling, volition, perception, will, contact, intelligence,Mindfulness, attention, resolve, and meditative stability.(z) The group of ten mental states that are found in all virtuous minds (<dasakusalamahabhumika, dge baisa mangbcu) comprises217Faith, vigilance, refinement, equanimity, conscience, shame,The two roots of virtue, namely, non-attachment and non-hatred, Along with non-violence and perseverance.(3) The group of six mental states that are found in all dissonant or afflicted minds (satklesamahdbhumika, nyon mongs cangyisa mangdrug) comprises218Delusion, carelessness, indolence,Faithlessness, dullness, and mental agitation.(4) The group of two mental states that are found in all non-virtuous minds (dvayakusalamahabhumika, mi dge bai sa pa chen po gny is) comprises219Lack of conscience and shamelessness.(5) The group often mental states that are found in all slightly dissonant or afflicted minds [parittaklesabhumika, nyon mongs chung ngui sa pa bcu) comprises220Anger, enmity, pretentiousness, jealousy, annoyance,Hypocrisy, miserliness, deceit, self-satisfaction, and violence.These thirty-eight [mental states] are actually presented in the Treasury [of Phenomenology], while the commentaries of Vasubandhu (bhasya) and Yasomitra (pika) supplement the list with the addition of the following eight indeterminate mental states (astaniyatabhumika, ma ngespa’isapa brgyad)-}1'Ideation, scrutiny, regret, drowsiness,Hostility, desire, pride, and doubt.222"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"546 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOBasic Category of Form ative Predispo sitio ns Disassociated w ith Mind [dd]The fourth is the basic category of the formative predispositions that are dis­associated with mind.

For, medi­tative absorption includes both the meditative absorption devoid of percep­tion and the meditative absorption of cessation. Conditioned characteristics include four aspects: birth, aging, duration [of the life span], and imperma­nence. Nominal clusters imply three clusters altogether, with the addition of phrasal clusters and syllabic clusters.Derived from these [fourteen] there are also many further classifications. Thus, it is extensively explained, for example, that acquisition may have three aspects, with the addition of new acquisition {labdhaprapti, rnyed thob) and [uninterrupted] possession {samanvdgama, Idan thob). Even “former acquisition” (purvaprdpti, sngar las thob pa) may include the acquisition of something that had not been acquired {apraptiprdpti, ma thob pa las thob pa), the acquisition of something that had been lost {vihinaprdpti, nyams nas thob pa), and the acquisition of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena {samskrtdsamskrtaprdpti, dus by as dang dus ma by as pdi thob pa), and so forth.231Basic Category of Un c o n d itio n e d Ph eno m ena [ee]The fifth is the basic category of unconditioned phenomena, which are explained to be three in number: space {akdsa, nam mkha), cessation obtained through analytical means {pratisamkhyanirodha, sosorbrtags gog), and cessa­tion obtained through non-analytical means {apratisamkhyanirodha, so sor brtags min gyi gog pa).232"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"THE TRADITION OF THE LOWER ABHIDHARMA- 547Sy no psis of Lo w er Ab h id h a r m a [iii]The third part [of the exegesis according to Lower Abhidharma] is a synopsis of all its points [on which it says in the root verses]:All relative [appearances] are subsumedIn the aggregate of physical forms, the sensory base of mental phenomena,And the sensory activity field of the mental faculty.These [appearances] are of three sorts: causally effective phenomena,Including substantial existents and imputed existents,And non-causally effective phenomena.With regard to all those [phenomenological structures] that have just been explained, the sensory bases are established, having been specially extracted from the psycho-physical aggregates, and the sensory activity fields are [sim­ilarly] established, having been specially extracted from the sensory bases.

The [class of] imputed causally effective phenom­ena is so designated because, although in general things that are not subject to ideation or scrutiny such as a “vase” are substantially existent, the [con­cepts of] production and cessation in relation to the vase and so forth are imputed by the intellect. Then, [the class of] non-causally effective phenom­ena includes [unconditioned phenomena] such as space.In addition, [phenomena] are also explained to be subsumed within [the categories of] substantial entities [dravyavastu, rdzas dngos), imputed entities (prajnaptivastu, btags dngos),238 relative entities {samvrtivastu, kun rdzob kyi dngos po), and absolute entities [paramarthavastu, don dam gyi dngos po).239"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"6.

However, the “defining characteristics” refer [in this context] to particular aspects of phenomena that are imaginary or imputed (chos kun tu btags pa). These include all phenomena that are relatively determined, such as [the dichotomies of] cause and result, greatness and smallness, light and dark, or example and exemplified, which are all said to be imputed with regard to space (yul la btags pa).

As such, they may be exemplified by the universal image of a given conceived object that arises in the mind due to the apprehending imagination of a “vase.”Among their subdivisions, there are many variations, including (a) natu­ral appearances {svabhdvanimitta, rang bzhin gyi rgyu mtshan)—the signs of the diverse imaging or propensities that manifest to the innate mind in cyclic existence; (b) projected appearances (bimbanimitta, gzugs bmyen gyi rgyu mtshan), such as the apprehension of a self, which is imputed by errone­ous philosophical systems; and (c) dichotomizing or polarizing appearances {dvandvanimitta, rgyu mtshan gnyis gnyis), such as [phenomena that are] realized and unrealized, clear and unclear, or symbolic and non-symbolic.253Furthermore, the term “appearance” may also be uniquely applied to each of the five foundational factors, as follows:(1) The appearance of appearances {rgyu mtshan gyi rgyu mtshan) refers to the subjective apprehension of the universal image corresponding to a conceived object, such as a “vase.”(2) The appearance of names {minggi rgyu mtshan) may be exemplified, in this instance, by the universal image of the conceived object [i.e., the “vase”].(3) The appearance of false imagination {mam rtoggi rgyu mtshan) is exemplified by the workings of the mind and its mental states.(4) The appearance of absolute reality {de bzhin nyid kyi rgyu mtshan) refers to a given object imputed as absolute reality by means of thought processes.(3) The appearance of genuine [non-conceptual] knowledge {yangdagpai shespai rgyu mtshan) refers to a given universal image apprehended while one adheres to the [spiritual] path.254Nam es [2']The second [comments on the root verses]:Names are verbally designated universals,Imputed with respect to these [appearances]."},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"558 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOThey include substantive, relational, integrated,Diversified, known, and unknown names.The essential nature of names is that they are verbally designated universals which, on being imputed with respect to a given appearance, are perceived and then labeled. For example, a “vase” is designated on the basis of a given object apprehended by means of the imagination that conceives a vase; and indeed it is even perceived as the term-universal {sgra spyi) corresponding to its given [object], without being audibly sensed.Although among the subdivisions [of names] almost forty have been enu­merated,255 here they are subsumed in the following six:(1) Substantive names (dngos poi ming) may be exemplified, in this instance, by the given term-universal {sgra spyi) “vase.”(2) Relational names (Jbrel bai ming) may be exemplified by the term- universal inherent in the thought, “This vase is large. This vase is small.”(3) Integrating names {duspdi ming) are exemplified by term-universals in which multiple aspects are perceived as one, as in the statement, “These golden vases, silver vases, and copper vases are vases.”(4) Diversifying names {tha dadpa’i ming) are the opposite of these, exem­plified by term-universals in which the details derived from a single descriptive base {khyadgzhi) are diversely perceived, as in the state­ment, “These vases comprise golden, silver, and copper vases.”(5-6) Known names {gragspdi ming) and unknown names {magragspdi ming) refer to those that are known and unknown in a given place and time. For example, the Sanskrit term hasti {lagldan) is known to mean “elephant,” while the same expression {lagpa dang Idan pa) is not known to mean “bull.”False Im aginations [3']The third [comments on the root verses]:False imagination denotes the mind and its mental states,Including symbolic and non-symbolic [concepts],As well as dissonant and non-dissonant mental states.The essential nature of false imagination is that it denotes the mind and its mental states;256 while its subdivisions may be either symbolic or non-symbolic"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"[nimittavikalpa cdnimittavikalpa, mtshan bcas dangmtshan ma medpdi mam rtog). The former refers principally to the imaginations associated with the mind and mental states prevalent in the world-system of desire, as well as those prevalent as far as the first meditative concentration. The latter refers to [imaginations that are prevalent] from that [first meditative concentra­tion] as far as the summit of existence, as well as to the temporary mind and mental states associated with unconsciousness and sleep. However, the last mentioned are not designated as “perpetually non-symbolic” (mtshan magtan nos med pa) but as “inferior states which are subject to cessation.”Alternatively, imaginations may include those associated with dissonant mental states {klistavikalpa, nyon mongs can gyi mam rtog) and those associ­ated with non-dissonant mental states {aklistavikalpa, nyon mongs can mayin pai mam rtog). Among these, the former are the non-virtuous imaginations prevalent in the world system of desire, while the latter are the imaginations compounded by uncorrupted [states]. Among these, three further types are also distinguished, namely, object-oriented [imaginations] {dlambanavikalpa, yul la jugpa) »investigative [imaginations] {paryesakavikalpa, *tsholbapo),2iná analytical imaginations (pratyaveksakavikalpa, so sor rtog pai mam rtog).257Absolute Reality [4']The fourth [comments on the root verses]:The absolute reality transcends expression and thought.The actual reality that transcends objects of verbal expression and mental conception is [also known as] suchness or absolute reality (tathatd, de bzhin nyid), which is within the perceptual range of the non-conceptual pristine cognition [nirvikalpajñdna, rnam par mi rtogpdiye shes) alone, [experienced during] the meditative equipoise of sublime beings.258Genuine No nco nceptual Kno w ledg e [$’]The fifth [comments on the root verses]:Knowledge of the [spiritual] path,[Intermingling] meditative equipoise and post-meditative experience,Is the genuine [non-conceptual] knowledge.THE FIVE FOUNDATIONAL FACTORS - 559"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"$6o - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOThe [last two—absolute reality and genuine knowledge— ]Are respectively endowed with objective and subjective characteristics.All the phenomenological categories associated with the supportive [consciousness]Are gathered within this [fivefold classification].Knowledge of the [spiritual] path, which characteristically intermingles supramundane meditative equipoise {samâhita, mnyam gzhag) with supra- mundane post-meditative experience {prsthalabdha, rjes thob) is genuine [non-conceptual] knowledge (nirvikalpajñana, yang dag pai ye shes).259The [last] two [foundational factors], absolute reality and the genuine [non-conceptual] knowledge, are endowed with defining characteristics that are respectively objective and subjective.Conclusio n [bb]Elaborating on these [five foundational factors of epistemology], if I might offer some further words of explanation:260 Since names and appearances are neither identical nor different, they are both [said to be] “inexpressible apart from the absolute reality,”261 while it is also said of the four other foundational factors in relation to the absolute reality that they too are “inexpressible apart from the absolute reality.”[In terms of their defining characteristics,] appearances are the defining characteristic of the subjective aspect of false imagination. This is because while appearances are the objective aspect of imagination they are also the agent or enactor of a given object of imagination. Names are the defining characteristics of the ground or locus from which conventional expressions originate.[In term of substantial and imputed existents,] both false imagination that objectifies appearances and genuine knowledge are [classed as] “substan­tial existents” {rdzas yod), while names are [classed as] “imputed existents” (btagsyod). Those aspects [of imagination] that apprehend [both] names and appearances are [classed as] substantial existents. Absolute reality transcends both substantial and imputed existents.262[In terms of the three natures, those postulated concepts] which are not apprehended on the basis of appearances are assigned, along with names, to the imaginary nature (parikalpita, kun brtags). Both false imagination and genuine knowledge are assigned to the dependent nature {paratantra, gzhan"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"dbang). The absolute reality refers to the unchanging consummate nature (parinispanna, yongs grub).163With regard to the term “factor” (cbos) as employed here in the expression “five [foundational] factors” {cbos Inga), it conveys the sense of a foundation [of epistemology], facilitating the understanding of phenomena. Alterna­tively, these [five factors] are also known as the “five entities” {pancavastu, dngospo Inga), simply indicating that they have the causal efficacy of substan­tial entities (bhavasadartha, dngospo’i donyodpa).16AThe expression “five foundational factors” was mentioned by the Con­queror himself [ in the sutras of the final promulgation] ,265 because the factors of demonstration {laksyadharma, mtshan gzhi chos) among the twofold divi­sion of defining characteristics and demonstration, and all phenomenological categories associated with the supportive [consciousness] {rten gyi shes bya thams cad) among the twofold division of the supportive [consciousness] and its supported [objects], are subsumed within these five [foundational factors].THE FIVE FOUNDATIONAL FACTORS - 561"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"8.

In the case of a designated object imputed by the term “vase,” for example, the act of designation is carried out by the imaginations of mental consciousness and its peripheral mental states.When classified, [the imaginary nature] comprises the following three aspects:(1) the imaginary nature of delimited characteristics {paricchedaparikal- pita, mtshan nyid yongs su chad pai kun btags), exemplified by objects that are apprehended through the [deluded] apprehension of indi­vidual selfhood (pudgalatma, gangzaggi bdag).

The term “extraneous” here refers to the diverse propensi­ties which are imprinted upon the substratum, and it is under the “control” of these propensities that the substratum consciousness, congruent with apper­ception, becomes manifest.When there is only a radiant and aware consciousness, uncontrolled by propensities, the apperception does not become diversified and abides right"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"566 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW Owhere it is, [unmodified,] but otherwise, through its dependence on propensi­ties, the apperception does become diversified.When classified, [the dependent nature] has two aspects: the dependent nature comprising the seeds of all dissonant mental states (kun nas nyon mongs pa sa bongyigzhan dbang) and the dependent nature in which neither deluded nor purified mental states inherently exist (kun byanggi ngo bor ma grub pai gzhan dbang), because conscious awareness is pure and unmodified by propensities.271Alternatively, [the dependent nature] may be classified according to the impure mundane dependent nature [ma dag ’jig rten pa’igzhan dbang), in which the mind and mental states of the three world systems manifest as real existents through the power of propensities, and the pure mundane depen­dent nature [dag pa jig rten pai gzhan dbang), in which appearances devoid of substantial existence manifest in an illusory manner during the post-med­itative experiences of sublime beings.272Or else, it may be classified into six aspects, in accordance with the fol­lowing sixfold enumeration that is mentioned in the Sutra of the Descent to Lanka*, (i) visual consciousness and the physical forms that are its object; (2.) the mental states that originate within its periphery; (3) the dissonant mental consciousness that closely depends upon these [mental states]; (4) the substratum that is the initial entry-point of diversification; (5) the application of this general process to the other [modes of consciousness]; and (6) the relation of the six modes [of engaged consciousness] to the substratum and the dissonant mental consciousness.273Consum m ate Nature [3']The third part [concerning the consummate nature, comments on the root verses]:The consummate nature is the ultimate actual reality—the absolute reality.The [consummate] nature has four aspects:For it is naturally pure, it is free from adventitious stains,It is the pristine cognition of the spiritual path,And it is the objective of the scriptures.The term “consummate nature” [parinispanna, yongs grub) refers to the actual reality of all phenomena, the original ultimate [truth].

For this reason, the natures that are classi­fied may be reduced to two: (1) the imaginary nature that relates to phenomena [dharmaparikalpitalaksana, choskun brtags kyi mtshan nyid) and (1) the con­summate nature that relates to actual reality (dharmataparinispannalaksana, chos nyidyongs su grub pai mtshan nyid).More generally, with regard to the relationship between these two natures—one combining the imaginary and the dependent, and the other being the consummate—it is also said that they are [all] “inexpressible apart from the absolute reality.”285 The imaginary is the aspect which imputes reifi­cation or exaggeration, and the dependent is the object of this reification or exaggeration. The consummate is the actual reality of those other two aspects. Therefore, when the three natures are analyzed from one perspective they are not identical, but when analyzed from another perspective, they are not different.

Subhuti, this one-pointed focus­ing of the mind on physical form, [firstly] with reference to the emptiness of its non-substantiality, and similarly with reference to the emptiness of its substantiality, and [thirdly] with reference to the emptiness of its inherent existence, is known as the meditative stability of emptiness {Junyatasamadhi). So it is that the bodhi- sattvas should completely understand meditative stability with regard to physical form.Th eir Dem o nstrations [b*]The second aspect concerns the demonstrations of the three natures, which maybe exemplified as follows: Whether there are appearances that arise before visual consciousness or appearances that arise before mental consciousness, at the time when [this visual or mental object] appears [for example] as a “vase,” the aspect which apprehends the vase is the imaginary nature. The bare con­sciousness, radiant and aware, which distinguishes it is the dependent nature,"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"THE THREE NATURES- 573and the pristine cognition that remains when the imaginary and dependent natures have ceased to exist is held to be the consummate nature.Then, taking as another example a dissonant mental state, such as attach­ment or hatred: When a strong attachment or hatred arises in the mind, the afflictive apparitional aspect of attachment or hatred is the imaginary nature, the aspect of radiant awareness that cognizes it is the dependent nature, and the pristine cognition, free from conceptual elaboration, that permeates all things in a common savor is the consummate nature.In this context, the expression “common savor” (ro mnyam) may be under­stood as follows: Although, for example, the radiant and aware aspect of the consciousness of hatred and the radiant and aware aspect of the consciousness of attachment are both very similar, because they relate to different things, they are not mutually inclusive. However, according to the consummate nature of these [apparently dissimilar mental states] they are essentially inseparable, for which reason they are of a common savor in their essential nature.290One should know that this analogy may also be applied to [the apparent dichotomy between all] the phenomenological categories of the path and the result.In d ia n Com m entators on th e Three Natures [c]The definitive establishment of the three natures is extensively found in the surras of the final promulgation, but it can equally be recognized in [the writ­ings of] venerable Maitreya and in Nagarjunas Commentary on the Sutra of the Shoots of Rice.291A somewhat different interpretation may be found, however, in Vasuban- dhu s Dissertation on the Thirty Verses, which is well known among the expo­nents of extraneous emptiness.292 Accordingly, the mighty lord of awareness [ Vasubandhu] has clearly established that293The objects that are imputed by false imagination Are the imaginary nature,While the imaginations [themselves] are the dependent [nature],And their emptiness is the consummate nature.I disagree with those who think that the definitive structure of the three essential natures is a tradition that is known only to the Cittamatrins (sems tsampa) and not to the Madhyamika (<dbu mapa).294 Indeed, it says in the"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"574 -THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW OChapter Requested by Maitreya from the Sutra of the Transcendental Perfection of Discriminative Awareness:295Maitreya, the thorough analysis of physical form has three aspects: the thorough analysis of the imaginary nature, the thorough analy­sis of the imputed nature (mam par btags pai mtshan nyid), and the thorough analysis of the nature of actual reality.The systematic presentation of the three natures of our own tradition is also established in [Cznitdkivtis] Auto-commentary on the Introduction [toMadh- yamaka] and in [Santaraksitas] Auto-commentary on the Ornament of Madh- yamakaP6 Furthermore, in [Kamalasllas] Lamp ofMadhyamaka, it says:It is not the case that the adherents ofMadhyamaka do not admit the systematic presentation of the three essential natures.

The consum­mate nature may also be explained in terms of dependent origination with an intention directed towards the ultimate aspect of dependent origination (paramdrthapratityasamutpdda), even though it is not actually subject to rela­tive dependent origination {samvrtipratityasamutpdda).298In general, [the term] “dependent origination” denotes the dependent origination that is endowed with generated and generative aspects (utpdd- yotpadakapratityasa m utpdda, bskyed by a skyed byed kyi rten 1brel), which are [respectively] the fruitional and causal processes associated with the arising of the physical environment and its sentient inhabitants, along with the inner consciousness. These processes principally fall within the scope of the depen­dent nature.The same term may also denote the dependent origination that is endowed with determined and determinative aspects (.sthdpaniyasthdpakapratitya- samutpdda, gzhag by a dang 'jog byed kyi rten 'brel). Here, the determinative aspects {’jogbyed) occur with reference to the [just-mentioned] generated and generative [causal nexus] and may be exemplified by the arising of the con­sciousness in which a shoot appears from the consciousness in which a seed appears. The determined or relational aspects {gzhag by a) also occur without reference to this [causal nexus] and may be exemplified by the determination of “small” in relation to Targe.” In brief, these interrelated aspects [of causality] principally fall within the scope of the imaginary nature.299As far as the genuine dependent origination (.samyakpratityasamutpdda, yang dag pa i rten 'brel) is concerned, it is this that determines [the composi­tion of] the substratum consciousness, along with all its propensities. This is one of the two categories of dependent origination—provisional and genu­ine—which are identified within the dependent origination of the generative and generated [causal nexus]; and for this reason it is subsumed within the dependent nature.300"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"378 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW OExtensive Analytical Exegesis of Dependent Orig ination [b]The latter, the extensive [analytical] exegesis [of dependent origination], has eight topics: (i) essential nature (ngo bo), (2) etymology [nges tshig), (3) literal meaning [sgra don), (4) recognition of the twelve individual links of dependent origination (yan lag bcu gnyis so so'i ngos dzin), (3) function [karmavyavasthana, byedlas), (6) analysis {prabheda, rabdbye), (7) synthesis (angasamdsa,don bsdu), and (8) a presentation of the real nature of dependent origination (rten ’brelgyi de kho na nyid bstanpa).mEssential Nature [of Dependent Orig in a t io n] [i]With regard to the first of these [the essential nature, it says in the root verses]:The essential nature [of dependent origination]Is that it occurs only with regard to appearances,And it arises contingent on them.When all phenomena are investigated, although they [ultimately] abide as emptiness, without inherent existence in any respect, the characteristic or essential nature of dependent origination is that this is an [empirical process] that occurs only with regard to appearances, and it arises contingent on them. It is said in the Fundamental Stanzas ofMadhyamaka, entitled Discriminative Awareness:302Whatever is dependently originated,This has been explained as emptiness.It is imputed [as existent], dependent on [something else].This is indeed the path ofMadhyamaka.Because there is nothing that is not dependendy originated,There is nothing that is not empty.Etym ology [ii]With regard to the second, the etymology [it says in the root verses]:The etymology implies “originationDependent on a complex of causes and conditions.”"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"DEPENDENT O RIG IN A TIO N -579The Tibetan term rten ’brel [translated as “dependent origination”] in the original Sanskrit is rendered aspratityasamutpada. The pztfaxpratitya [here] conveys the meanings of a “congregation,” a “convergence” or an “encoun­ter.”303 Samutpada means “generated” or “originated.” The point is that, what­ever object one considers, it is impossible for diverse results to arise from a single cause, or for only a single result to arise from diverse causes. Rather, diverse results originate dependent on an encounter or convergence of diverse causes and conditions, or else one might say that [causal] links originate in dependence on previous links.304Literal Meaning [iii]With regard to the third, the literal meaning [it says in the root verses]:The literal meanings include “without an agent,”“Endowed with causal basisand so forth.The [Sanskrit] term pratityasamutpada is generally said to convey eleven literal meanings. As such, it can mean “without an agent” (nihkdrtrka, byed papo medpa), “endowed with causal basis” (sahetuka,, rgyu dang bcaspa), “non-sentient” (nihsattva, sems can med pa), “dependent” (paratantrdrtha, gzhan gyi dbang), “unmoving” {nirihaka, gYo ba med pa)™ impermanent (anitya, mi rtagpa), “momentary” (ksanika, skad cigpa), “uninterrupted” iprabandhanupaccheda, rgyun mi \\chadpa), “conformity of causes and results” {anurupahetuphala, rgyu ’bras mthunpa), “diversity [of causes and results]” (ivicitrabetuphala, sna tshogs pa), and a “distinctive regular pattern of causes and results” {pratiniyatahetuphala, rgyu ’brasso sorngespa).306 For example, it could be understood in the sense, “All phenomena are dependendy originated, without an agent,” and so forth.The Twelve Ind ividual Links of Dependent Orig inatio n [iv][Fundam ental Ig n o r a n c e]With regard to the fourth, the recognition of the twelve individual links of dependent origination [it says in the root verses]:Fundamental ignorance, the opposite of awareness,Is endowed with three attributes."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"380 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOAlthough it has many classifications,It comprises both [ignorance] endowed with dissonant mental statesAnd [ignorance] devoid of dissonant mental states.Fundamental [ignorance] is within the peripheryO f the dissonant mental consciousness,Deluded with respect to [its imputation of] a self.The essential nature of fundamental ignorance {avidya, ma rig pa), which is the first of the twelve links of dependent origination {dvadaJarigapra- tityasamutpada, rten ’brelgyiyan lagbcu gnyis), is that it is the opposite or disharmonious counterpoint of awareness (vidya,, rigpa) and is endowed with the following three particular attributes: (1) it implies a consciousness that refers objectively to its object; (2) it implies that the sense data of this object are extremely inconspicuous; and (3) it is the gateway through which the mental continuum arises in a non-quiescent dissonant or afflicted state.307Although [fundamental ignorance] has many classifications, it [essen­tially comprises] both the ignorance endowed with dissonant mental states (klistavidya, nyon mong pa can gyi ma rig pa) and the ignorance devoid of dissonant mental states {aklistavidya, nyon mongpa can mayinpa!i ma rigpa). The former is the causal basis of cyclic existence, the obscuration comprising dissonant mental states {klesdvarana, nyon monggi sgrib) that obscures [the attainment of] release [from cyclic existence]. The latter is the obscuration of knowable phenomena (jneydvarana, sbes bya’i sgrib), which obscures [the attainment of] omniscience (sarvajna,, thams cad mkhyenpa).According to this tradition [of Taranatha], fundamental ignorance {mulavidya, rtsa ba’i ma rigpa) actually lies within the periphery of the dis­sonant mental consciousness and is said to denote “delusion with respect to [the erroneous imputation of] a self.”308There are also some who have simplistically stated that, from the perspec­tive of its conspicuousness, [ignorance] is recognized as and identified with the [aforementioned egotistical] views that uphold mundane aggregates (satkayadrsti, jig tshogs su Ita ba).m[Form ative Pr e d ispo sitio n s, Co n sc io u sn ess, Nam e and Fo rm, Sensory Activity Fields]Formative predispositions include those associated with meritorious past actions,"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"DEPENDENT O R IG IN A T IO N - 581Those associated with non-meritorious past actions,And those associated with past actions that do not transcend [cyclic existence].The substratum consciousness, along with its propensities,Includes both causal and fruitional aspects.[Name and form] comprise the four [aggregates endowed with] names,Along with physical form in its five stages of embryonic and fetal development;W hile the sensory activity fields essentially demarcate the six sense organs.The second link [of dependent origination] comprises formative predis­positions [samskara, du byed) which may be associated with meritorious past actions (bsodnams kyi las), non-meritorious past actions {bsodnams minpa’i las), or unwavering or non-dynamic past actions {ániňjyakarma, migYo bdi las). The first of these are the virtuous past actions pertaining to the world- system of desire; the second are the non-virtuous past actions associated with the world-system of desire; and the third are the past actions, or meditative stabilities, through which the two higher world-systems [of form and form­lessness] are attained.310The third link [of dependent origination] is the substratum conscious­ness {dlayavijňdna, kungzhii mam shes) upon which the propensities of past actions are imposed, for which reason they represent the transformational aspect of this consciousness. It includes both the [substratum] consciousness that is replete with causal imprints and the [substratum] consciousness replete with fruitional imprints.311The fourth link [of dependent origination] comprises name and form {ndmampa, minggzugs). Here “name” refers to the four nominal aggregates (ming bzhii phungpo), i.e., the four subsequent aggregates of feelings, and so forth. Although there are reasons for these [feelings, perceptions, forma­tive predispositions, and consciousness] being assigned to the “four nominal aggregates,” the aggregate of physical forms should not be understood as being dependent on names because it manifests direcdy within the perceptual range of the five sensory consciousnesses. By contrast, the four subsequent aggre­gates, being present in the mental continua of others {parasdntdnika, gzhan gyi rgyud layodpa),3lz are understood to be dependent on names.313The link of form comprises the five stages of embryonic and fetal develop­ment (mngalgyi skabs Inga), known respectively as the clotting of the embryo"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"581 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW O(kalala, nurnurpo), the oval formation of the embryo [arbuda, mer merpo), the rounded formation or solidification of the embryo {peii, gor gor po), the suspension of the embryo (ghana, mklorang gyur), and the limb formation of the fetus {praJdkha, rkanglagrnam par ’gyus pa).314The fifth link [of dependent origination] comprises the six sensory activ­ity fields {sadayatana, skye mched drug), the essential nature of which is that they clearly demarcate the six sense organs, consequent on the five stages of embryonic and fetal development.315[Sensory Contact, Sen satio n, Cr a ving]Sensory contact, which [fully manifests] after birth,Is an interaction of sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness.The sensations dependent on that are attachment, aversion, and neutrality.[Consequendy] there is craving desirous [of rebirth]And craving that grasps after perishable things.The sixth link [of dependent origination] is sensory contact (.sparsa, regpa). Following birth from the womb, there emerges sensory contact, in which sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness all converge together. However, sensory contact actually refers to a transformation that occurs in conscious­ness [prior to birth] due to the presence [in the womb] of its sense objects, and consequent on the interaction of consciousness and its sense objects.316The seventh link [of dependent origination] is sensation {vedana, tshorba). Dependent on that sensory contact, sensations or feelings of happiness, suf­fering, and neutrality are then experienced. This process may be exemplified as follows: Through the convergence of the sense organ of the eye with its sense objects—comprising pleasant physical forms—and visual conscious­ness, visual consciousness initially generates sensory contact, which delimits its sense objects. Immediately thereafter, there arises the sensation of happi­ness, which is experienced through that sensory contact.317Since this analysis of the three types of sensation may be made in relation to all of the six [modes of engaged] sensory consciousness, sensations are collectively designated as the eighteen sensory objects that impact upon the mind {astadasamanopavicara, yid nye bar rgyu ba bco brgyad).i]8The eighth link [of dependent origination] is craving {trsnd, sredpa), which refers to the craving and attachment that occur in relation to the three [just- mentioned] types of sensation—those of happiness, suffering, and neutrality."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"DEPENDENT O RIG IN A TIO N - 583Now there are [three aspects of craving] that may arise: the craving that one might not be separated from happiness, the craving that desires separation from suffering, and the craving that desires not to be separated from neutrality.Alternatively, craving may comprise the craving that desires rebirth (,kdmatrsnd, srid pa la \\dodpai sredpa), the craving associated with the rebirth process (bhavatrsna, srid pa’i sred pa), and the craving associated with decay or perishable phenomena (vibhavatrsnd, ’jigpdi sred pa). The first of these is [the craving] associated with the world-system of desire, the second is [the craving] associated with the two higher world systems, and the third is the craving that grasps after [material] resources.319[Gr a spin g, Rebirth Pro cess, Bir t h, and Aging and Dea th]Through grasping after desires, rebirth, erroneous views,And belief in [an inherently existing] self,[The rebirth process] is endowed with the potent function O f implementing reincarnation.Reaching the moment of conception, birth is obtained,And commencing from then,There is a continuous series of indivisible time moments,Leading to the obstruction of the life essence, aging, and death.The ninth link [of dependent origination] is grasping (updddna, len pa), which originates dependent on craving. When, for example, there is craving for and attachment to the sensa of pleasurable objects, such as food, drink, and resources, the desire that these [pleasures] might repeatedly arise, and the potential to engage in diverse activities in pursuit of that goal, are designated as “grasping.”It is said that there are four kinds of grasping {caturupdddna, nye bar len pa bzhi), namely, the grasping after desires (kdmopdddna., dod pai len pa), the grasping of rebirth (bhavopdddna, srid pa’i len pa),320 the grasping of [errone­ous] views (drstyopádána, Ita bai len pa), and the grasping after belief in an [inherently existing] self {dtmavddopádána, bdagtu smra bai nye bar len pa).Through these [aspects of grasping], the subsequent links [of dependent origination] are formed or fulfilled.321The tenth link [of dependent origination] is the rebirth process (bhava, srid pa), which is endowed with the potent function of implementing reincarnation.322"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"584 - t h e TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOThe eleventh link [of dependent origination] is actual birth (jdti, skye ba).

This is said to be the case because if there is no aging, there is also no death.Therefore, one should know that in respect of all [phenomena] that arise, there are two processes of unfolding (dvisammukhibhdva, mngon du *gyur ba gnyis): one [static process] whereby the twelve links of dependent origina­tion manifest the propensities imposed on the substratum, and one [dynamic process] whereby the twelve links are manifested through the maturation of the seeds [of past actions].324F u n c t i o n s [ o f t h e T w e l v e L in k s o f D e p e n d e n t O r i g i n a t i o n ] [v]With regard to the fifth topic [of the extensive exegesis], concerning the func­tions (karmavyavasthdna, byed las) [of dependent origination, it says in the root verses] :The functions [of the twelve links]Are respectively to obscure the truth,To plant seeds, to direct towards [birth],To offer complete support [to the body],To perfect it, to delimit [its sense objects],To partake of [happiness], to acquire [rebirth],To conjoin [with birth], to propel towards [birth],[To engender] suffering, and to transform [age].The individual functions of these [twelve links of dependent origination] are presented in one and a half stanzas from the [Analysis of 'the] Middle and Extremes.325[Accordingly, it is said that]"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"DEPENDENT O R IG IN A T IO N - 583(1) The function of fundamental ignorance is to obscure the vision of the genuine truth, and similarly, through the power of that [fundamental ignorance]:(2) The function of formative predispositions is to cause the seeds of past actions to be sown in the substratum.(3) The function of consciousness is to convey [formative predispositions] towards [an appropriate] place of birth, in conformity with those seeds [of past actions].(4) The function of name and form is to fully embrace a physical body, corresponding to the direction in which [consciousness] has been conveyed.(3) The function of the six sensory activity fields is to fully perfect a physi­cal body, corresponding to that which is embraced [by name and form].(6) The function of sensory contact is to integrate the three aspects [of the sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness] through the power of those [sensory activity fields] and to delimit the sense objects.(7) The function of sensation is to partake of happiness and so forth, cor­responding to the [sense objects] that have been delimited [by sensory contact].(8) The function of craving is to acquire rebirth corresponding to ones past actions, through the power of these [sensations].(9) The function of grasping is to conjoin the consciousness with birth, corresponding to that craving.(10) The function of the rebirth process is to manifestly propel a reincar­nating [consciousness] towards birth, corresponding to that union [induced by craving].(11) The function of birth is to engender an aggregate of suffering through the power of that [rebirth process].(12) The function of aging and death is to transform youth and vitality in accordance with the disadvantages [of birth].All of these [functions] indeed induce dissonant mental states, conducive [to rebirth] within cyclic existence.Detailed Analysis [of Dependent Or ig in a tio n] [vi]The sixth topic, concerning the detailed analysis of dependent origination, includes (i) a brief introduction, and (2) an extensive exegesis."},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"586 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOBrief In t r o d u c t io n [aa]Concerning the former [it says in the root verses]:The detailed analysis [of dependent origination] comprises A threefold [analysis], an eightfold [analysis],And a detailed exegesis according to the [twelve] links.Although, in general, the exegeses that offer a detailed analysis of depen­dent origination have many variations, here I will refer sequentially to the threefold analysis (gsum du dbye ba), the eightfold analysis (brgyad du dbye ba), and the detailed exegesis of the twelve links (yan lag bcugnyis bye brag tub shad pa).Extensive Analysis [bb]The latter has three parts: (i) the threefold [analysis], (2) the eightfold [analy­sis], and (3) the detailed [analysis of the twelve links].T h e T h r e e f o l d A n a l y s i s [i‘]This also has three topics, namely, (1) the dependent origination that distin­guishes the essential nature (.svabhavavibhagapratityasamutpada, ngo bo nyid mam par'byedpai rten 'brel);

This refers to the emana­tion of all outer and inner phenomena from the substratum consciousness, and to the appearances that manifest through its power as being deposited upon it. This [realization] was presented as the lot of only bodhisattvas of highest acumen who enter into the Greater Vehicle, but was not disclosed to the other two sorts of spiritual being who follow the way of Buddhism. This means that it is a realization attained uniquely by bodhisattvas or buddhas, whereas the pious attendants and hermit buddhas are not even partly aware ofit.327Depend en t Orig inatio n That Disting uish es Attractive and Unattractive Goals [b']Concerning the second [it says in the root verses]:[The dependent origination] that distinguishes attractive and unattractive [goals]Is said to be [understood] by pious attendants and hermit buddhas. It has two aspects, referring to dissonant mental states and purification.[Here] the verb “distinguishes” is understood To mean “augments” and “magnifies.”Attractive [goals] {priya, sdugpa) are pleasant or agreeable, while unattract- ive [goals] (apriya, mi sdugpa) are unpleasant or disagreeable. Distinguishing between these two accords with the twelve links of dependent origination. This [realization] was presented by the transcendent lord [Buddha] to both the pious attendants and the hermit buddhas who follow the way of Buddhism. Although both of these types meditate in accordance with this teaching, the hermit buddhas extensively understand the [two] processes of dependent origination, namely, its “arising process” [anuloma, lugs ’byung) and its “reversal process” [pratiloma, lugs Idog), whereas the pious attendants do not extensively understand the [processes] of dependent origination through their own comprehension, as do the hermit buddhas.328Now this process [distinguishing attractive and unattractive goals] has two aspects, which refer respectively to dissonant mental states [samklesa, kun nas nyon mongspa) and to purification {vyavadana, mam byang).329The former, [evolving in association with dissonant mental states,] includes"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"588 - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOa [positive] process that gives rise to birth within the higher realms (svarga,, mtho ris) through the power of corrupt virtuous actions that are concomitant with ignorance (ma rig pa dang mtshungs Idan gyi dge ba zag bcas) and is designated as the “dependent origination that distinguishes attractive goals” (sdugpa mam par ’byedpa’i rten 1brel).

This is because it is by means of all the diverse appearances, including visible forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangible phenomena, and all the inauthentic imaginations associated with mind and mental states, that propensities are imposed upon the substratum, causing the substratum itself to be “augmented” or “magnified.”Dependent Orig ination Associated w ith Sensory Engagem ent [c]Concerning the third [it says in the root verses]:[The dependent origination] associated with sensory engagement Refers to the process that generates and obstructs the six modes [of consciousness],Which pious attendants then control by means of selflessness.The dependent origination associated with sensory engagement is the process that causes the six modes of consciousness to arise and cease.

The sensation of happiness experienced through consciousness of that agreeable sensum of the object is [known as] the “gateway that generates attachment” (dod chags skye bai sgo), and the [consequent] thought that desires not to be separated from that agreeable mental object is [known as] “volition” (cetana, semspa). Accordingly, when visual consciousness arises through these four conditions, the mental states that emerge in the periphery of this [visual consciousness] — namely, sensory contact, sensation, and volition—obscure the nature of die central mind and render it impure.One should know by analogy that when this process depends on a dis­agreeable sense object, [the unhappy sensation experienced is known as] the “gateway that generates aversion” {zhe sdang skye bai sgo), and when it depends on a neutral or indifferent sense object, [the neutral sensation experienced is known as] the “gateway that generates delusion” [gti mug skye bai sgo).In this way, the six modes of [engaged] consciousness generate the disso­nant mental states of attachment, aversion, and delusion, dependent on sense objects that are respectively agreeable, disagreeable, and neutral; and there is an activation of false imagination that ensues.

In this way, two cycles of causal and fruitional phases are completed over three lifetimes within the world system of desire.This process is extensively revealed by the Buddha in order that sentient beings might reverse the three aspects of delusion, with regard to the limits of the past [life], the future [life], and the present [life].346C o m p l e t i o n o f O n e C y c l e in a S i n g l e L i f e t i m e [in ] Concerning the third process [it says in the root verses]:There is also [a process whereby] the [cycle of dependent origination]W ill be completed in a single lifetime,Experiencing [the fruits] of presently perceptible phenomena.With reference to the experience of [the fruits of] the presently perceptible phenomena [of this life] (drstadharmavedayitvá, mthong chos myong gyur), [it is said that the cycle of] the twelve links [of dependent origination] may also be completed in a single lifetime.For example, when sentient beings who have committed an inexpiable crime proceed into the hells, or when, motivated by fundamental ignorance, a man becomes predisposed towards action with a strong thought desirous of being reborn as a woman, through this action, the seeds associated with rebirth in that [corresponding state] are deposited upon consciousness; and then the seeds of [the consequent] links—name and form, the six sensory activity fields, sensory contact, and sensation—are also sequentially deposited [upon that consciousness].

Consequently, when one s own mind projects negativity, and the propensities to take birth in a [lower realm of existence], such as the hells, contaminate consciousness, this is [considered to be] the link of conscious­ness. When, at that time, the concerned individuals five psycho-physical aggregates and six sensory activity fields give rise to [further] negativity which contaminates the sensa, these are respectively [considered to be] the links [of name and form and the sensory activity fields]. When, at that time, the sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness all converge and the sense objects are delimited, this is [considered to be] the link of sensory contact. When, on that occasion, he or she experiences the killing of the victim, this is the link of sensation. When, at that time, there is a manifest craving to commit that act of murder, this is the link of craving. When he or she then desires to fulfill that deed through craving, this is the link of grasping. When the propensities for [negative] rebirth in the next life are determined by that [grasping], this is the link of the rebirth process; and when the psycho-physical aggregates determined at that time are actually transformed [into a hellish state of exis­tence], these are [the links of] birth and aging and death."},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"Inter co nnected Dependent Orig inatio n [c]The third of these topics, the exegesis concerning interconnected dependent origination (Jbrel ba can gyi rten 1brel), has two parts: (i) the textual inter­pretation of the venerable Maitreya, and (i) the textual interpretation of the master Vasubandhu.T h e T e x t u a l I n t e r p r e t a t i o n o f M a i t r e y a [i]The first of these has three topics: (i) analysis, (2) synthesis and (3) the pre­sentation of seven [projective and formative] causes.[Analysis]Concerning the first [it is said in the root verses]:W ith regard to the interconnected [dependent origination] According to the Analysis of the Middle and Extremes,Birth is conjoined with aging and death.Consequently, there are [only] eleven links.As far as the interconnected dependent origination is concerned, according to the Analysis of the Middle and Extremes, [the process of dependent origi­nation] is classified according to [only] eleven links, starting with [the links of] fundamental ignorance and formative predispositions and ending with birth and aging and death, which are all combined together [in a single link].This integration is made because [the link of] birth is [designated as] the “suffering of the supportive” [physical body] (<ádháraduhkha, rten gyi sdug bsngal), while the diverse manifestations of the aggregate of suffering, includ­ing aging, dying, unhappy thoughts, and cries of lamentation, are all [desig­nated as] the “sufferings supported upon it” (ádheyaduhkha, de la brten pa*i sdugbsngal).

Together these [links] constitute the “projective dependent origination” (’phenpa’irten Jbrel), and they are completed with reference to the previous life.

[Specifically,] the “projective dependent origination” (aksepapratityasamutpdda, ’phenpa’i rten ’brel) is divided into three aspects: the projector (ganggis ’phenpa), the pro­jection process {tshulji Itar ’phenpa), and the projected (gang ’phangspa).

In addition, the aspect of disadvantage (adinava, nyes dmigs) is also presented.358These seven aspects or points are correlated to the sequence of the twelve links of dependent origination as follows: Among them, “the projector” refers to the two links of fundamental ignorance and the formative predispositions motivated by it. “The projection process” denotes the way in which the seeds of past actions are deposited or projected by the link of formative predispo­sitions upon the single link of consciousness. “The projected” refers to the four [consequent links]—name and form, six sensory activity fields, sensory contact, and sensation—which are projected.Although the seed of the next rebirth is ripened and fully projected by means of these [just-mentioned] seven links, this same seed merely exists as a potential,359 and it is uncertain that the [corresponding] rebirth will be swiftly assumed. Therefore, it is the [next four] links of formation ('grub pa'i yan lag) that will determine the outcome of the [corresponding] rebirth, in the next life, for example, in a swift and timely manner. In this context, “the former” denotes the two links of craving and grasping through which [the next rebirth] will be formed. “The formation process” denotes the way in which that same seed of the rebirth process, existing in a potential form con­sequent on the previously projected [links], is actually formed. “The formed” refers to the single link of birth in the next reincarnation.The seventh aspect, the “disadvantages,” correlates with the single link of aging and death.Alternative Processes of Dependent Orig ination [in ]These [processes], for the most part, occur [over sequential lives], just as described in the example [given above]. The alternative [processes], on the other hand, are imprecise because it is possible for many past lives to project a single rebirth, or for a body ripened by certain past actions to endure beyond a hundred aeons, and so forth. Also, as mentioned above, the cycle can be completed within a single lifetime. However, Jetsun Chenpo [Taranatha] of Jonang has said that those [irregular] modalities that confuse the order [of the links of dependent origination], by appending the three links of craving, grasping, and rebirth process directly to the first three links of the [chain], and so forth, are quite mistaken.3606Ol - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWO"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"DEPENDENT O R IG IN A T IO N - 603Depend en t Orig inatio n in th e Three Wo r ld-System s [iv]Incidentally, if one were to wonder what sort of dependent origination is applicable in the context of the [three] world systems, and whether these [links] are similar for those abiding on the same level (sa mtshungspa) or not, in the world-system of desire the twelve links [of dependent origina­tion] are fully present, whereas in the two higher world-systems the twelve [links] are partly present because it is explained that [the link of] aging exists therein, in the manner of formative predispositions that are old and putrid. Meanwhile, in the [world system of] formlessness, the physical aspects of dependent origination are absent.Depend en t Orig inatio n in respect of th e Nine Levels of th e Three Wo r ld-System s [v]The nine [experiential] levels that collectively comprise the three world- systems (khams gsum sa dguf61 may be reduced to the following three cir­cumstances: (i) one’s present level (.svabhumi, rang so), (z) the level below it (adhabhumi, ogsa), and (3) the level above it (urdhvabhumi, gong sa); or alternatively, (1) the level of death (1chi sa), (z) the level of birth (skyesa), and(3) the level of neither [death nor birth] (sagnyis ka mayin pa).In this context, a single link [of dependent origination], with the exception of fundamental ignorance, can only be similar for those who share the level on which they have been born [among these nine levels or three circumstances].As for fundamental ignorance, when beings are reborn from the world- system of desire back into the [world-system of] desire, this link is similar for all those who continue to abide on this level because it is inherent within the [world system of] desire; but when beings are reborn from their own level among the eight higher levels [of experience, associated with the world- systems of form and formlessness] back into the same [higher] level, [it is said that] there is no fundamental ignorance afflicting those who continue to abide on that same level. This is because the [immediate] past actions that would [ordinarily] project a birth into these [higher levels] are the medita­tions on quiescent and coarse [appearances] (zhi rags su sgompd), but when one [merely] continues to abide on one s own [previous] level, [the impact of past actions is projected directly, through their own power] and not through the meditations on quiescent and coarse [appearances].362However, when one makes a detailed investigation, there are many par­"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"604 - t h e TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TWOticular explanations, which should be understood from the [aforementioned] work of the supreme scholar Vasubandhu, and other texts.363Synth esis [of th e Links of Dependent Or ig in a tio n] [vii]The seventh part [of the extensive exegesis; see p. 578] concerns the synthesis (,angasamasa,, don bsdu) [of dependent origination]. This has three topics: (1) the understanding of arising and cessation that accords with dependent origi­nation, (2) the synthesis of dependent origination in terms of the two truths, and (3) an explanation of the advantages that accrue when difficult points are incidentally understood in accordance with the five profound contradictions [of dependent origination].Und er sta ndin g of Arising and Cessation That Accords w ith Dependent Orig inatio n [aa]Concerning the first of these topics [it says in the root verses]:The arising and cessation of substantial things Through uncreated and impermanent seeds Which are endowed with potencyAccords with the understanding of dependent origination.With regard to the arising and cessation of substantial things: Phenomena are uncreated by the dynamics of false imagination present in the mind of a creator, and they are impermanent because anythingpermanent and steadfast would not be subject to the arising and cessation of causes and conditions. Since phenomena have a nature that partakes of arising and cessation, and substantial things are seeds endowed with potency, they are produced by causes capable of generating their respective results.364Without knowing the processes of arising and cessation in respect of sub­stantial things in accordance with the three natures of which they may partake, non-Buddhists and others propound their diverse [views of] eternalism and nihilism. However, when the meaning of dependent origination is [properly] understood, the reality will be known.

However, their actual reality is the lack of true existence, despite their appearances, and this can merely be designated as the “ultimate dependent origination of emptiness” (don dam stongpa nyid kyi rten Jbrel). This crucial point is extremely profound and subtle, for which reasons it is an object known by the Buddha alone. Since it is this process of dependent origination that reaches the summit of all the promulgations of buddha speech, it has been extolled as the most genuine of all the [views] that have been propounded.In this way, the systematic presentation of dependent origination should be known to correspond quantitatively to the essential nature of the two truths.T h e F iv e P r o f o u n d C o n t r a d i c t i o n s o f D e p e n d e n t O r i g i n a t i o n [c c]Concerning the third topic [the advantages that accrue when difficult points are incidentally understood in accordance with the five profound contradic­tions of dependent origination, it says in the root verses]:[Dependent origination] is hard to understand On account of the profundity of its causal basis,Defining characteristic, arising, duration, and functioning,And on account of its five ostensible contradictions.Now, as for the reasons why this [ultimate] reality [of dependent origina­tion] is not understood by others apart from the omniscient Buddha: This [process] is endowed with five [profundities], i.e., it is profound on account of its causal basis (hetugdmbhirya, rgyus zab pa), profound on account of its"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"6o6- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW Odefining characteristics (laksanagâmbhïrya, mtshan 7iyid kyis zab pa), pro­found on account of its arising (utpattigámbhirya, skye b¿is zab pa), profound on account of its duration [sthitigámbhirya, gnaspas zab pa), and profound on account of its functioning (vrttigâmbhïrya, ’byungbas zab pa).365 And it is endowed with five ostensible contradictions (Itar snang Inga), namely,( i ) Although [dependent origination] is momentary, it is also observed to have duration.(z) Although [dependent origination] arises from unmoving conditions, it is also observed that its potencies are idiosyncratic.(3) Although [dependent origination] occurs without reference to sen­tient beings, it is also observed in respect of sentient beings.(4) Although [dependent origination] has no creator, it is also observed that past actions are not fruitless.(5) Although [dependent origination] does not arise from the four extremes,366 it does not arise with reference to any other agency.367One who knows the meaning of this profound dependent origination is endowed with a great sense of purpose because the level of perfect buddha- hood will be attained contingent on the pure view that sees emptiness and dependent origination as indivisible. Accordingly, it is said in the Four Hun- dred Verses:When dependent origination is perceived,Delusion will not arise.Therefore, at this juncture,And by every possible effort,I should explain this point alone.And in the Letter to a Friend:368This dependent origination is the profound and precious treasure Of the compositions of buddha speech of all the conquerors.

It has three topics: (1) the real nature"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"of selflessness (bdagmedpai de kho na nyid), (z) the real nature of internal [phenomena] (nanggi dekho na nyia!), and (3) the real nature devoid of inher­ent existence (rangbzhin medpai de kho na nyid).The Real Nature of Selflessness [aa]Regarding the first of these topics [it says in the root verses]:A ll phenomena are merely dependency originated and without self.Since all relative phenomena, associated with cyclic existence and with the [spiritual] paths and their results, arise from compounded causes and condi­tions, they are impermanent, they are imbued with suffering, they are empty, and they are without self.369As for these [four hallmarks], with regard to the first, impermanence (ani- tya, mi rtagpa), all substantial things are endowed with a subtle imperma­nence, whereby they arise and cease instantaneously. This is because although things may not perish immediately after they have arisen, the real nature of things that are arising is that they are also perishing. Since there is not the slightest intervening period of duration [between them], the parameters are the present moment of arising and the present moment of perishing.With regard to suffering (duhkha,, sdugbsngalba), since things are imper­manent, it is established that they are imbued with suffering because they are powerless to endure for more than a mere moment.With regard to emptiness (.sunyatd, stongpa nyid), taking any substantial thing, whether external or internal, into consideration, it is simply die case that from its causes and conditions, which are multifaceted, diverse, and of the nature of impermanence, the results that arise are also diverse and of the nature of impermanence. However, things are also [designated as] empty because they are in all respects devoid of self and devoid of a creator.With regard to selflessness (nairdtmya, bdagmed pa), these phenomena are not created by any truly existing creator, but they appear merely as the process of dependent origination, which can be analyzed in terms of causes and conditions.The Real Nature of Internal Ph eno m ena [bb]Regarding the second topic [it says in the root verses]:DEPENDENT O R IG IN A T IO N - 607"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"6o8- THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW OThe real nature of internal [phenomena] is apperception, devoid of self.If one were to wonder whether, although [substantial things] are without self, the processes of dependent origination that apply to internal conscious­ness and external objects are in reality truly existent, it is the case that all dependently originated phenomena are without true or substantial existence in any respect whatsoever, because they are contrived and adventitious.The [dependent origination] that arises through the power of mere apper­ception or imagination, focussing on the absence of erroneous bewilderment, is designated as the “real nature of internal phenomena” (nanggi de kho na nyid).370T h e R e a l N a t u r e D e v o i d o f I n h e r e n t E x i s t e n c e [c c] Regarding the third topic [it says in the root verses]:Regarding this [mere apperception],Although it does not primordially exist, it does appear,Without contradiction,In the manner of consciousness that is tainted by sleep.This is the real nature devoid of inherent existence,The pristine cognition of inner radianceThat transcends the objects of dependent origination,Because it is liberated from the mutual interdependence O f determined and determinative aspects.There is no contradiction [in saying that] although this mere apperception does not truly exist because it has not existed primordially, it is just something that appears. For example, although the appearances that arise diversely in the form of Mount Sumeru, houses, and so forth in the consciousness of the dream state tainted by sleep have never actually existed, there is a dormant consciousness that does exist in that temporary state. In the same way, all the sensa of sense objects and sense data that arise have never truly existed from the beginning, and yet there is a conceptual basis for their arising that is pres­ent in this temporary state.371Just as, although the fire that occurs in a dream has never existed from the beginning but it does appear to kindle firewood, this [mere apperception] also transcends all [extremes] of existence and non-existence, eternalism and"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"DEPENDENT ORIG IN ATIO N— 609nihilism. That is to say, since the diverse sensa associated with the dependent origination of causes and conditions do arise as mere appearances, they tran­scend [the extreme of] non-existence; and since they are without inherent existence, they also transcend [the extreme of] existence.372Similarly, since the appearances associated with the dependent origination of causes and conditions partake of the nature of impermanence, the former [links] ceasing as the subsequent links arise, they also transcend the extreme of permanence; and since the gateways through which these mere appear­ances arise from their causes and conditions manifest without ceasing, they transcend the extreme of nihilism. This [process] is [designated as] the “real nature devoid of inherent existence” (rang bzhin medpa’i de kho na nyid)?11For this reason, it is said in the Compendium [of Phenomenology]'?1*It does not arise from itself, or from anything else, nor does it arise from both. It does not arise without a cause. It does not inherently exist in an intrinsic manner, and it does not inherently exist in an extraneous manner. Nor does it inherently exist in a combination of these two.Although formative predispositions originate through the condition of fundamental ignorance, they do not originate solely from the [concept of] self associated with fundamental ignorance because it is impossible for many [diverse] results to arise from only a single cause. Nor is it the case that they originate from an extraneous substance because they do so with reference to their own cause. Nor indeed do they originate from both [a single intrinsic and an external cause] because [the postulations of] “self” and “other” [as the causes] have been individually refuted. Also, it is not the case that [they can originate] without a cause because one can clearly see that the arising of a result is certainly determined with reference to a cause.375There is an extravagantly proud [view] emphasized by some who have suggested that “this structure of dependent origination associated with Nagarjuna is the tradition of Madhyamaka, whereas the Cittamatra tradi­tion was expounded by Asahga and his brother [Vasubandhu] because they uphold [the concept of] extraneous arising [or production from an external cause].” One can truly understand that this [view] is incorrect on the basis of the foregoing exegesis, which is based on the above citation from the Com­pendium o f Phenomenology?16In general, the expression “extraneous arising” {parata utpada, gzhan las skye ba) refers to the appearances that appear to arise extraneously merely"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"within the scope of the relative [truth], and the [corollary] expression “extra­neous non-arising” {gzhan las mi skye) is refuted because the extraneous aris­ing that truly [or independently] exists is refuted.377Nowadays, those who claim to uphold the content ofNágárjunas scriptures unanimously assert the logical congruence that emptiness is dependent origi­nation, and yet it should be understood that the pristine cognition of natural inner radiance (rangbzhin odgsalbaiyesbes), which is the ultimate [truth], [actually] transcends dependent origination because it transcends objects of verbal expression and mental conception, and because it is liberated from [the distinctions between] generative causes and generated results, and from the mutual interdependence of determined and determinative aspects {mam par gzhag by a 'jog byed kyi It os bzhag).mFurthermore, with regard to this natural inner radiance, its essential nature is the original pristine cognition, natural and spontaneously present, which has not been generated by any cause whatsoever. This is because it does not produce an extraneous result, nor is it a causal action of extraneous produc­tion. This pristine cognition is not even an object ofverbal expression or men­tal conception. However much one who has never previously seen [Mount] Potala might describe or mentally conceive its defining characteristics, one can never depict it, just as it is. In the same way, too, however much the natural inner radiance can be conceived and determined by means of verbal expressions and mental conceptions, its defining characteristics cannot be qualitatively illustrated by any direct or indirect means.379Since [from the perspective of logical analysis], those [processes] of mutu­ally interdependent origination {Itos ’joggi rten *bret) are [considered to be] generally characterized phenomena (.sdmdnyalaksana, spyi mtshan) [which are not causally effective], such processes do not even rank among the prop­erties of [ordinary] material things which are [considered to be] specifically characterized phenomena {svalaksana, rang mtshan) [and therefore causally effective], insofar as they are the directly evident signified objects (dngos kyi brjodbya) ofverbal signifiers. This being the case, there is no question that nat­ural inner radiance transcends the objective range of dependent origination.380On the other hand, it is not contradictory to say that although the ultimate [truth] is not dependent origination, the ultimate [truth] can be realized by meditating on dependent origination. This is because all phenomena are accepted as dependently originated.381This systematic presentation of dependent origination is expounded as an addendum to the [exegesis of] the three natures, and in order to acquire a6IO - THE TREASURY OF KNOWLEDGE: BOOK SIX, PART TW O"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"more extensive comprehension of it, one should refer to the exegeses that are mainly found in the textual tradition of Asahga and his brother [ Vasubandhu].This completes the auto-commentary on Book Six, Part Two: A Systematic Presentation of Phenomenological Structures Common to Both the Greater Vehicle and the Lesser Vehicle.DEPENDENT ORIG IN ATIO N— 6ll"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"Appen d ix: Outline of the TextThis outline derives from the Shes bya kun khyab kyi sa bead, prepared by Zenkar Rinpoche, Thubten Nyima, and published by the Sichuan Nationali­ties Publishing House in 1990.

H ere, “sun” (Skc. surya and arka, T ib. nyi ma) suggests the num ber 12 because there are twelve aditya— charioteers o f the sun in Puranic m ythology.In fig. 4 the m easurem ent o f 25 relative finger-widtlis from the crown protuberance to die throat is presented slightly differendy, in the divisions 4, 4.5,12.5, and 4, but overall the result is the same.The text reads ma-nu, i.e., 14 (w hich is so nam ed because there are fourteen subdivisions o f the four classes o f traditional Indian society). H ow ever, this num ber refers n o t to the h eigh t but to the length o f the soles o f the fee t. See Yeshe Sherab, Iconometric Drawings, 31 and 42, w here this p oin t is clarified. The h eight o f the feet is n ot specifically m en ­tion ed in the tantra but is included in the drawings based upon it.Similarly, the knees and their m easurem ent are o m itted in the text, but see fig. 4 and Yeshe Sherab, Iconometric Drawings, 30-31, as w ell as references to the relevant ic o n o ­metric diagrams in the follow ing notes.This makes the total num ber o f vertical relative finger-widths 125. Sanskrit tattva {de nyid), m ean in g “reality” suggests the num ber 25 because according to the Sam khya p h i­losophy, reality com prises tw enty-five categories {tattva). Veda {rigs byed) suggests the num ber 4 because there are four Vcdas.The m easurem ents o f the elbow s and wrists are n o t specified in the tantra text, but they are included in all the diagrams based u pon it.

See also the illustrations in Y onten Tsering, The Supreme Arts, 12-13 and 16-17. The m ain distinction here is that the sub-m easurem ents o f twelve and a h a lf found in the Kalacakra system are replaced by m easurem ents o f tw elve finger-widths. Peterson 1980, 2 4 6 , show s how, in the Cakrasamvara system, the vertical m easurem ents o f the seated buddha figure com prise three units o f four relative finger-widths (protuberance, hairline, nose, and chin), along w ith three units o f tw elve relative finger-widths, repre­senting the heart, navel, and genitalia, and another tw o units o f four, representing the hips and the edge o f the plinth. The h orizontal m easurem ents are similar to those o f the Kalacakra system except that die distance from the center o f the chest to the armpit is tw elve rather than tw elve and a h a lf finger-widths. Various large measures can then be established on the basis o f that grid o f 120 finger-widths. A ccord ing to Jackson and Jackson 1984, 52, these large p alm -length measures are each based on the standard o f twelve finger-widths. A m o n g them , the m easurem ents o f ten and nine large units are reserved respectively for peaceful bodhisattvas and peaceful female deities— their Class II and Class III figures— the form er m easuring 120 finger-widths and the latter 108 finger-widths. The division o f twelve large m easurem ents is reserved for sem i-w rathful m editational deities, such as Hevajra, Cakrasamvara, and Kalacakra. See Peterson 1980, 2 4 0 . O n Kuladatta’s interpretation o f the tw elve and ten p alm -length measures, see also Skorupski 2 0 0 2 ,1 3 7 -1 3 9 .307 The face-length and palm -length measures are identical.

Taranatha offers further technical details regarding these disparities in his Origin of Happiness, ff.5b4-6b2.309 See Jackson and Jackson 1984, 52, Class IV, where diis m easurem ent, a m ou nting to 96 finger-widths, is reserved for the larger wrathful deities.310 H ow ever, according to Peterson 1980, 2 4 2 ff, this text is closer to the Emergence of Cakrasamvara in positing an iconom etric m easurem ent o f 120 finger-widths, albeit w ith som e differences ou tlin ed in the chart on p. 2 4 6 o f that work."},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"NOTES TO PART ONE- 7673 11 Three m andalas from this work, w hich is attributed to Jagaddarpana(’G r o b a ’i m e long), are in cluded by Abhayakaragupta in his Indestructible Garland.

Paldu, Exegesis onTibetan Writing, 62, states chat the Li tradition originated with Tonmi Sambhota and it implied “refined writing” [legs bris).

The extant D en tradition dates from the era o f King Trisong Detsen, Denma Tsemang being one o f the twenty-five recognized disciples o f Padmasambhava, on whom see Dudjom Rinpoche 1991,1:535 75^.507 These italic scripts (’bru tsha) are considered by contemporary scholars to have predated the block-letter scripts. On their origin, see above, note 480. Pari Sangye, The Writing of Tibetan, discusses them in greater detail (pp. 6 -7 , and 89 -9 6 , with illustrations). See also Gu Wenyi and Shi Xueli, Compilation of the Various Types of Calligraphy, 67-73.508 Some o f these variant scripts are illustrated in Pari Sangye, The Writing of Tibetan, 6 9 -8 8 (on sug ring and sug thung) and 97-108 (on the common letter-writing scripts). Also see Gu Wenyi and Shi Xueli, Compilation of the Various Types of Calligraphy, 7 4 ff (on sug ring), 91 (on sug thung), 97ff. [ongshar ma), and 99 fF. (on rgyugbris).

Metal-nib pens also include the fountain pen (Icags smyug chu babs), but that would be anachronistic in this context. Paldu also suggests, p. 51, that the “southern\" pen and the \"ravine” pen arc suitable on account o f the quality o f their bamboo, for which reason the former may possibly derive from the southern border area o f Lhomon (Bhutan) and Lhodrak, and the latter from the gorges o f Tsawarong or Gyelrong in Eastern Tibet, where bamboo is abundant.511 This procedure is also explained in detail in Paldu, Exegesis on Tibetan Writing, 53-58, and in Konchok Tendzin, The Fine Arts, 176-177.511 Tib. rtse dang so mo grang bag zhol.513 See Paldu, Exegesis on Tibetan Writing, 58.514 Tib. khal, for which Paldu, Exegesis on Tibetan Writing, 59, reads lan.

The three parts o f the nib are probably the two tines (kham gnyis) o f the actual nib (smyug rdzing), which are separated by the cleft, along with the vent hole (.smyugyur), while the five attributes may possibly refer to the tines, the tip, die vent hole, the cleft, and the shoulders o f the nib.

More likely, it is to be taken as an alternative spelling for nya ’khridpa, meaning either the cherry tree (Zhang Yisun et al., Great Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary, 928) or Sibiracaangustata (Karma Chopel, Illustrations, 121). Jamgon Mipham Gyatsos Cornu­copia of Practical Techniques Pertaining to the Arts, Collected Works, 1:76-78, describes nine different ingredients for making ink, but makes no mention o f this.

A m o n g them , V agbhatas Eight Divisions of Medical Science {Astangahrdayasamhita) has been particularly influential (see Vogel 1965).W ith in the T ib etan m edical tradition, prim acy is given to the Great Tantra of Secret Instructions on the Eight Branches of the Essence of the Glorious Elixir of Immortality {dPal Idan bdud rtsi snying po y an lag brgyad pa gsang ba man ngaggi rgyud chen po). This text is said to have been transm itted in T ib et by the great translator Vairocana during the eighth century, based on teachings he received from C andranandana and Padm asam bhava, in the lifetim e o f the great physician Yutok Yonten G o n p o the Elder, and to have been concealed as a “treasurc-doctrine” {gter chos) at Samye, from where it was subsequendy revealed by Drapa N g o n sh e o f Dratang on 19 July 1038. Subsequently the text was redacted and cam e to be k now n as the Four Tantras of Dratang {Grva thang rgyud bzhi).

These and other m edical lineages were integrated during the seventeenth century by Sangye Gyatso ( 1 6 5 3 - 1 7 0 5 ) , the author o f the authoritative Blue Beryl [ Treatise on Medicine, Clarifying the Four Tantras Which Are the Enlightened Intention ofBhaisajyaguru] ( gSo ba rig pai bstan bcos sman bla’i dgongs rgyan rgyud bzhii gsal byed baidurya sngon po’i mallika).

Tables listing all the precise meter classes, commencing from those with a single syllable up to those with twenty-seven syllables, may be found in Nyagong Konchok Tseten et al., Commen­tary, 16 4 -1 6 $ . The same twenty-seven meter classes are also presented with examples in an appendix to Apte 196$, 1 0 3 5-1041. Seven o f the most com m only used meter classes are named after the mythic seven horses that pull the chariot o f Aditya across the heavens in the course o f a solar day, viz., Gayatrl (six syllables), Usnih (seven sylla­bles), Anustubh (eight syllables), Brhatl (nine syllables), Panktl (ten syllables), Tristubh (eleven syllables), and Jagatl (twelve syllables).

This number o f possible permutations o f heavy and light syllables in respect o f a given meter class is obtained by doubling the number o f possible permutations given for the preceding meter class, i.e., only two permutations are possible for a single-syllable line o f verse, but four are possible for a two-syllable line, eight for a three-syllable line, sixteen for a four-syllable line, thirty-two for a five syllable line, sixty-four for a six syl­lable line, one hundred and twenty eight for a seven syllable line, two hundred and fifty six for an eight syllable line, five hundred and twelve for a nine syllable line, and thus one thousand and twenty-four for a ten-syllable line (Panktl).9 4 4 For the example o f the Tanumadhya meter, see Nyagong Konchok Tseten et al., Com­mentary, 23.

T he same work, pp. 1 4 4 -1 4 8 , differentiates the traditions o f Ratnakarasanti and Pirigala in preparing these general tables. A related table on pp. 1 6 4 -1 6 5 (see fig. 4 8) show s h o w the num ber o f possible perm utations o f heavy and light syllables doubles as the n um ber o f syllables in a line o f verse increases by one. For exam ple, the six-syllable m eter has 6 4 perm utations, the seven-syllable m eter has 128, and the eight-syllable meter, 256.967 This step is listed in N y a g o n g K o n ch o k Tseten et al., Commentary, 1 6 3 -1 6 7 , and in Shastri 1990 as the fifth step rather than the second. The tabular chart for the ten-syllable m eter class includes 1,024 variant meters, so that the corresp ond in gprastara table is 19 units w ide, 2 ,0 4 7 units deep, and com prises 38,893 square units in its extent. Hall, n.d., notes that this calculation is originally attributed to Pirigala.968 This is listed as the secon d step in the N y a g o n g K o n ch o k Tseten et al., Commentary, 148-151, and 185; also in Shastri 1990. See fig. 4 9. The resulting cadence o f heavy and light syllables is d eterm ined by d ividing the num ber o f the specific m eter (e.g., the four­teenth perm utation o f the six-syllable class) by tw o, repeatedly, until there is n o rem ain­der. A n even q uotient indicates that the first syllable will be “light,” and an o d d quotient, that it w ill be “heavy.” Since 14 is an even number, the first syllable w ill be light. D ivid ed again by tw o, the q uotien t w ill be seven, an o d d number, indicating that the second syllable w ill be heavy. A d d one to that, m aking eight, and again divide by tw o, so that the next q uotien t will be four, m aking the third syllable light. That in turn is divided by tw o, giving a q uotien t o f tw o, so that the fourth syllable is also light. T w o is divided by tw o, m aking one, so that the fifth syllable is heavy. A gain adding one, tw o is on ce again divided by tw o, so that the final syllable is heavy. The calculation thus continues until, in the case o f our example, six syllables o f varied heavy and light cadence are fully present in the sequence: light, heavy, light, light, heavy, heavy. This m athem atical focus on the com binations o f heavy and light syllables, w hich can be traced back to Pirigala, ranks as die earliest k now n description o f the binary num eral system in m athem atics.969 This step (illustrated in fig. 50) is listed as the third in N y a g o n g K o n ch o k Tseten et al., Commentary, 151-154, and 183. T he calculation is m ade by aligning the sequence o f heavy and light syllables in a given m eter sequentially below the increm ental prastara num bers (1, 2, 4, 8,16, 32, 6 4, etc). O n e thus obtains the num bers corresponding to the light syllables in the given meter, ignoring those that correspond to the heavy syllables. The num bers corresponding to the light syllables should then be tallied, and the num ber o n e added to the total, hi the exam ple given here, w e k n o w from the prastara table that the ten-syllable m eter class has 1,024 perm utations.
