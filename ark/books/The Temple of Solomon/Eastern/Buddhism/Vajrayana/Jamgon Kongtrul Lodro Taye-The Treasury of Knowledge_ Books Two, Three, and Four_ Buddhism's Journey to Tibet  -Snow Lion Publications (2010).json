Tedious for some, enthralling for others, the subject of history that is central to this volume makes it the most accessible of all parts of Th e Treasury of Knowledge series. Once we accustom ourselves to the idiosyn-crasies of a classic Tibetan literary style—lines of verse that encapsulate the prose which follows—readers can relax in the impression that we have read many books of this nature before.Yet history as we have previously encountered it, be it Indian, Tibetan, or Chinese, was not Jamgön Kongtrul’s project in this work. Th e details of secular life rarely intrude into his narrative. Kingdoms rose and fell, the seas of Asian civilization roiled and roared all around the people we read of, but the author gives us no hint of them. For example, one great lama whose work he commends to us was beheaded, his sister violated, and his monastery sacked by foreign armies (from Mongolia), but we read of this personage as if he lived and thrived in the best of all possible worlds. Secular history, as we are familiar with it in book form, is absent here.Since this book was written by a Tibetan lama on the subject of Buddhism over the ages, we might equally expect to fi nd here ecclesiastical history—the inside story of the land of Tibet dominated by super-sized monasteries. Many of us have seen some pictures of old Tibet or its remains, and maybe even met those recognized as reincarnations of the founders of those massive institutions. Yet Kongtrul manages to fi ll hundreds of pages on the story of Buddhism with only the most cursory mention of church history. For example, where in this book, we might ask, do we read of the “four major orders or sects,” the framework we once learned held the key to assimilating the evolution of Buddhism on Tibetan soil? Th ey hardly merit more than a few furtive mentions. Moreover, we reach the end of Kongtrul’s survey of Buddhist activity in Tibet none the wiser TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 16/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeconcerning Buddhism’s infrastructure: did this order spawn ten or ten thousand monasteries, did ten or ten thousand monks live in each? We will not learn these facts reading Kongtrul. He seems to have been as deaf to the siren calls of the architectural and institutional splendors of the Tibetan Buddhist church as he was undistracted by the squalor of Asian political and military aff airs. He has not even compiled the stories and histories that tantric Buddhists have told one another for generations over centuries, to sustain ourselves and the next generation on our spiritual path, the stories such as we read in Th e Hundred Th ousand Songs of Milarepa or Th e Words of My Perfect Teacher, for example.What Kongtrul has written here in Books Two, Th ree, and Four of Th e Treasury of Knowledge is a Buddhist history of Buddhism. It makes for prosaic but essential reading : this is the Buddha; these are his origins; this is what Buddhism is—these material scriptures and this non-material realization; this is how Buddhism has been preserved and transmitted, and this is how it journeyed to and was assimilated into Tibetan life. What we learn is that Buddhism only exists in transmissions that pass from person to person, master to disciple, time and time again. Whether or not the master also bequeathed to his or her main disciple the keys to the temple and its treasury might fi gure in other authors’ accounts of specifi c institutions, but that transfer of goods and followers, however impressive and signifi cant, is not Buddhism’s story. Buddhist institutions can survive lifetimes of inept administrators; Buddhism itself cannot aff ord to skip even a single generation while coasting on grand buildings and able organizers. In my own experience of serving two generations of masters of one lineage—Kalu Rinpoché and Bokar Rinpoché—I wit-nessed the transmission of Buddhist wisdom, nectar poured from one full golden vase into another, as the process is sometimes described, with-out the two individuals having shared common institutions, or personal styles and backgrounds. One could have been Indian, the other Tibetan, for all that they were two radically diff erent characters who met with the sole purpose of giving and receiving Buddhist wisdom so it could be pre-served intact and re-transmitted.Th e latter half of Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet describes how that kind of meeting transpired fi rst in India among Indians, then between Indians and Tibetans, and fi nally just among Tibetans. Kongtrul traces many lines of transmission of Buddhist monastic practice, philosophy, and medita-tion, and oft en notes when some lines became irretrievably severed, the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 26/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 3fault of missed connections: a qualifi ed lineage holder in one generation passed away before passing on the teachings to a worthy disciple. Th e pertinent texts might still exist, and what is called the reading transmis-sion might survive, but the lack of a living link to the teaching dooms it to become a mere subject of study as we understand that activity in the modern world. In terms of Buddhist history, such an irrevocable break in a lineage amounts to a heart-breaking tragedy, akin to the collapse of a vibrant, enlightened culture. In those terms, Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet must be read as a cheerful book: yes, some of our ancestors’ wealth which they intended to bequeath us has been forever lost. Yet the Buddha appeared in this world and taught, many have followed in his footsteps, such individuals live among us today, and they are willing to share with us the unimaginable treasures they bear. Many are those who can still boast as one master did of his lineage centuries ago:Moreover, in this lineage that originated with the great perfect Buddha Vajra Bearer and has been transmitted until the pres-ent day, the moist warmth of the profound teachings has not evaporated, the blessed waters of the instructions’ streams have not ebbed, the lineage’s bridge of accomplished masters stands unbroken, gateways to meditative experience and realization remain wide open, and the seal of the doctrine’s leaders, the dakinis, endures intact: this lineage’s pith instructions are uni-versally recognized as irreproachable.How incredible! How perfectly marvelous!Th e words of this book may be consistently sober and prudent, as befi ts historical writing, but the spirit that animates them is exultant and cel-ebratory . . . with the caveat that any rejoicing in our priceless spiritual inheritance should be matched by our dedication to its preservation.Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet can be read by itself, yet it forms part of a much longer work, Th e Treasury of Knowledge. Th e next section of the introduction will help you gauge the towering ambitions of the author, Jamgön Kongtrul, in this Treasury which encompasses the length and breadth of Buddhist theory and practice, from its most elementary begin-nings to the most complex and demanding views and meditations.Why did Kongtrul write such an opus? For whom did he intend it, what TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 36/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgewas his purpose? Under what conditions did he compose this sprawling text, one of his life’s major triumphs? I devote one section of the intro-duction to those questions. Following that, I try to answer a similar set of questions concerning the present translation: why did Kalu Rinpoché decide it was a good idea to initiate this translation project? What was his purpose, his mission, that informed his will to lead the translation of this Treasury? Why did he think this series of books would be relevant in this day and age?I would give anything in my power to have Jamgön Kongtrul and Kalu Rinpoché be alive today, to answer those questions in person. Alas, I must try to divine their intent based on what amounts to tea leaves left at the bottom of the once brimming cups of their lives: a few lines gleaned from Kongtrul’s voluminous writings and a few words faintly recalled from Kalu Rinpoché’s plentiful talks. What I have read (or heard) and under-stood, and what another might read or recall from the same sources will likely diff er. I am the proverbial blind man touching the leg (or is it the trunk?) of an elephant and trying to guess the rest. Nonetheless, what-ever I have glimpsed of their vision has inspired me in this translation; the last section of the introduction is intended as a reader’s short guide to this book based on that inspiration. Translators must make choices—in explaining mine, I hope to enhance your experience as a reader and additionally inform you of what supplementary information is included where, be it in the supplementary material for each chapter, or in the book’s indexes.An Overview of The Treasury of KnowledgeAt the outset of the project to translate Jamgön Kongtrul’s Treasury of Knowledge, Kalu Rinpoché gave each of the book’s forty chapters to indi-vidual translators, asking us to produce a draft translation of that piece of the whole. Th us initially, the translators’ experience was probably not unlike that of the readers of this series who, by interest or coincidence or karmic affi nity, discover one part of Th e Treasury before another, but not in sequence. While the author set out a coherent progression among the topics in his work, I suspect that most readers of the original Tibetan Treasury read from it much as most modern readers likely do: pell-mell, according to need or interest. While this seems to be a perfectly valid use of this series of books, literate Tibetans recognize the structure of Th e TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 46/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 5Treasury of Knowledge as conforming to a known genre and therefore easily orient themselves and navigate within Th e Treasury’s seas of infor-mation. Since the rest of us, like the group of us translators at the outset of this project, have no familiarity with this kind of text, each volume of this series in translation includes an outline of the entire work to help the reader situate a specifi c book within Jamgön Kongtrul’s sweeping vision.Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet gathers into one volume three parts (Books Two, Th ree, and Four) of Jamgön Kongtrul’s ten-part master-work Th e Treasury of Knowledge. Book One of Th e Treasury, Myriad Worlds, describes our universe from many Buddhist perspectives and leads us through space and time within universes beyond all reckoning. Myriad Worlds marked the start of the series and precedes this book. (It was published in 1995 by Snow Lion Publications.) Th e book’s original four chapters became fi ve in translation:1. Th e Cosmolog y of the Universal Way2. Our Universe according to the Individual and Universal Ways3. Space and Time in the Tantra of the Wheel of Time4. Th e Causes of Cyclic Life5. Th e Primordial Purity of the UniverseMyriad Worlds sets the stage for the three books contained within Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet: “Th e Light of the World,” “What the Bud-dha Taught,” and “Buddhism Resplendent in the World.” “Th e Light of the World,” Book Two, situates the reader in somewhat familiar territory: our world, where we welcome among us the appearance of an enlightened being, the Buddha. Th is book’s four chapters present a multitude of views of the Buddha’s manifestation of enlightenment in this world:1. Our Teacher’s Path to Awakening2. Th e Buddha’s Enlightenment3. Th e Buddha’s Twelve Deeds4. Enlightenment’s Bodies and Pure Realms“What the Buddha Taught,” Book Th ree, elucidates what is meant by the Sanskrit term dharma, mainly in the sense of the teachings that illuminate our path to enlightenment. Th rough the course of these four chapters we discover that “what the Buddha taught” includes all teach-ings the Buddha inspired, even if he did not himself voice them:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 56/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge1.

Th at request provided an impetus for him to write, but he did not limit himself to the text origi-nally solicited. Jamgön Kongtrul felt his work “should be more compre-hensive in scope, something that would be of use to people who had not studied much.”1 He refers to the book he had in mind as “a treatise deal-ing with the three higher trainings,” that is to say, Buddhist training in ethical conduct, meditation, and sublime insight. At this point in early 1862, Jamgön Kongtrul relates that he wrote the root text in verse during intervals between sessions of meditation; he showed what he had written to his teacher, who encouraged him to compose a corresponding com-mentary in prose. His fi rst account of having used the completed text to teach occurs in 1866 (p. 144); it was fi nally published nine years later, in 1875 (p. 176).Practically speaking, apart from educating a general audience compris-ing those “who had not studied much,” Jamgön Kongtrul found another use for Th e Treasury of Knowledge: as a primer for those about to enter the three-year, three-fortnight retreats under his guidance. He wrote the following lines in 1864:Before entering either [three-year, three fortnight] retreat [a reference to his own retreat center at Tsadra Rinchen Drak and the one at Palpung Monastery nearby], retreatants should study the entire Treasury of Knowledge, or if that much study and refl ection is not feasible, they should at least have 1.

Yes, he was a Buddhist master, but he lived and wrote as a master of tantric Bud-dhism. Yes, he was ecumenical in outlook, but we should understand that the fi eld of his sincere and laudable ecumenism was limited to Himalayan tantric Buddhism. Yes, he was an enormously prolifi c writer and com-piler, but if we were to cull texts on Mahayana, the great way, and Madh-yamaka, the middle way, from his fi ve great treasuries, they would scarcely fi ll a single volume among the hundred or so he produced. He always pointed to the great way and the middle way as providing the indispens-able underpinning to tantra, but in his personal study and practice, and in his writing, teaching, and active life as a leading Buddhist personage of his day, he devoted himself to tantra:Casting aside the way of Bön, I have entered the door of the Buddhist teachings.Nowadays, dissatisfi ed with my practice in view and action,I aspire to follow aft er those of yore.I have read the many commentaries in an unbiased way,and examined the biographies of many learned and accomplished ones.I cannot abide even seeing booksby those sectarians who chase aft er fame,for speaking judgmentally is the way of fools.Knowing this, I have savored the fl avor of things in the cave of enlightened intentof the new and old schools without prejudice.I have practiced pure view for all the Victorious One’s teachings.Rejecting the Buddhist teachings [that is, holding sectarian attitudes] is a heavy burden which I have no wish to carry.I know that a life of simplicity and study alone is dearerthan public ceremonies, empowerments and formal rituals, and all the cultural trappingsTOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 10TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 106/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 11of religion mixed with the eight worldly pursuits.I have more faith in the inner meaning of the sutras and tantras alonethan in all there is to be learned in the fi elds of knowledge.I have more interest in the Buddha’s words than commentary,for I know that while there are many profound instructions,there is nothing which is not complete in the Buddha’s words.I aspire to defi nitive truth more than provisional truth,and to the pinnacle of the Madhyamaka even more than that.I have more faith in correct view than in action,and I know that the welfare of others is dearer than my own.I trust renunciation more than studying books,for it is better to tame the mind even a bitthan to be very learned in scripture and logic.I have more faith in the methods of tantra than of sutra,for the unsurpassable view and action of tantramakes my hairs stand on end when I even see or hear of them.Rather than a loft y position at odds with the Buddhist teachings,I would sooner be humble, dying like a dog ;I always think, “Oh, to die engaged in contemplationin empty caves and solitary dales!” (Autobiography, pp. 53–54)Kongtrul wrote those words at the age of thirty, and included them in his life story since they “seem to be something of an autobiographi-cal statement” (ibid., p. 52). He produced the bulk of his writing aft er this composition, but the spirit of the statement “I have more faith in the methods of tantra than of sutra, for the unsurpassable view and action of tantra makes my hairs stand on end when I even see or hear of them” echoes throughout his work, and throughout his long life. Aft er he had converted to Buddhism, having “cast aside the way of Bön,” Kongtrul reports that during his late adolescence he studied and refl ected upon, and wrote many outlines for, Longchenpa’s Seven Treasuries into the night until his lamp was spent. At the age of twenty, he left his fi rst monastic home for another but not before having learned and begun to practice the highest form of meditation his initial spiritual tradition had to off er—Direct Vision (“tögal” in Tibetan).Most people assume that at some point Kongtrul acquired a classic Buddhist education, but in fact his résumé in that fi eld is surprisingly thin. In a summing up of his studies, he writes that he received detailed TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 11TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 116/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeinstruction in just four texts of “the general Buddhist tradition” (Mai-treya’s Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization, Chandrakirti’s Entering the Middle Way, Asanga’s A Compendium of Observed Phenomena, and Maitreya’s Th e Highest Continuity), and in an autobiography chock full of details of his studies and meditation practice, he never mentions when he received instruction in the fi rst three of these texts, nor does he report that he ever taught them. On the other hand, he wrote a long commentary to Th e Highest Continuity (translated into English by Rosemarie Fuchs and published as Buddha Nature [Snow Lion Publications, 2000]), taught it oft en, and recommended it for all meditators within his tradition.Conspicuously absent from Kongtrul’s own account of his studies are the many other classics of the lesser and great ways (the hinayana and mahayana). Let us surmise that he read them; he neither engaged in formal study of them, nor did he teach them. His later studies corresponded to his early studies, his later meditations to his early practices, his early writ-ing to his later work: the vast majority centered on tantra. Anyone can now quickly and easily confi rm this by reading the tables of contents to Kongtrul’s Five Treasuries, found on pages 515–531 in an appendix to the Autobiography. We may call Kongtrul a scholar and a prolifi c writer, yet if we are to understand him and what he sought to achieve in Th e Treasury of Knowledge, we must situate his scholarship and writing squarely within the fi eld of tantra.Time and again throughout Th e Treasury of Knowledge, Kongtrul ably introduces us to the subjects of general Buddhism but does not allow us to tarry with them. For instance, he gives a grand tour of all subjects of pre-tantric Buddhist study, mundane and sacred, in the fi rst three chapters of Book Six and then declares at the outset of the next chapter (Systems of Buddhist Tantra) to sum up what one has just read: Th e culmination of the path of training in the way of the perfections gives rise to none other than the mantric path of training in the mind of its practitioner. Th erefore, the ulti-mate direct result of the perfections is not full awakening. Th e culmination of all aspects of the path of training in the mantra way directly yields the result of full awakening. Th at being the case, the fully awakened state is the direct result solely of the culmination of the mantric path of training . . .

Why? My guess is that as faithful to Buddhism as he was, his religion for him was simply the most effi cient means to an end—enlightenment—rather than a subject of intellectu-ally rewarding study. Unveiling and stressing throughout Th e Treasury the primary place of the highest tantras was his way of encouraging his readership to become participants, not spectators, on that path.Since the work translated here resembles the rest of Th e Treasury in its tantra-centered view of Buddhism, we might well ask what Kongtrul considered to be the crucial distinction between tantra (which he some-times refers to as “the mantric way” or “mantra”) and other forms of Bud-dhism (specifi cally with its closest neighbor, the way of the perfections). He answers that tantra and the Buddhist ways that lead to it share the same goal—a state beyond formulations or elaborations. Nevertheless, “Th e diff erence lies in the subject. . . In mantra, the subject is [the mind of ] great bliss used as method” (Systems of Buddhist Tantra, p. 81). Th is statement is couched in frightfully dualistic language, but Kongtrul could not avoid it: according to him, in tantra a shift must be made in the sub-ject, ourselves, from an ordinary, discursive consciousness to awareness grounded in the experience of great bliss. He goes on to state that tantric practice takes three forms—“the best, the lesser, and the secondary. Th e essence of the best form is great bliss; that of the lesser, the pride in being the deity; and that of the secondary, mere mantric rituals and applica-tions” (ibid., p. 86). Th e best, he says, is exemplifi ed by tantra’s phase of completion, the next by its phase of creation, and the last by methods or rituals for harnessing the power of meditation.We may seem to have digressed in these last paragraphs, yet these are the keys to reading Th e Treasury as he intended. If we impartially inspect Kongtrul’s accounts of his spiritual life, his writing, and his teaching, we see that he devoted his time and energ y to just these three forms of tantric practice. Th e Treasury of Knowledge does not represent a departure from his lifelong concerns, but instead constitutes a partic-ularly wide-ranging articulation of the crucial place of tantric practice on the Buddhist path.Kongtrul founded two retreat centers, where he welcomed those who were prepared to learn from him how to make a shift from conventional consciousness to tantric nondual wisdom. He accepted in his courses TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 13TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 136/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgepersons unversed in Buddhist studies. Kongtrul himself never attended a day of classes in one of the many monastic colleges of his day; he never founded a college of his own. He hoped his disciples could fi nd the time to read Th e Treasury of Knowledge, but he would be content if they had at least digested Buddhist Ethics. Some other Buddhist masters then and now might consider such an admission policy to be reckless, but this is not a word we can associate with Kongtrul. He knew what he was doing in receiving neophyte Buddhists into advanced tantric training : he was having them follow his personal example.It would be fair to ask whether Kongtrul lived in a hermitage and wrote just for those whose sole ambition was to live as renunciants. Jamgön Kongtrul did thrive in a retreat center, it is true, but his life and his out-look were not limited by those surroundings. For example, in 1863, the year aft er he began work on Th e Treasury of Knowledge, his idyllic life as a meditator, writer, and retreat teacher is interrupted: summoned by a military commander, Kongtrul slips “over a desolate pass to come down to the military camp.” While there, the opposing armies approached,. . . and there was great tumult and anxiety—an experience that reminded me what circumstances would be in the intermedi-ate state aft er death. At that point I was required to give coun-sel and do divinations to fi nd out when the Nyarong foe would strike and from which direction he would come. Such aff airs are hardly covered in the explanations concerning divination procedures, so I just spoke whatever came to mind and by the blessings of the three jewels everything I said turned out to be accurate. Even the commander was impressed. On the actual day of battle, the central Tibetan forces were victorious and congratulations were heaped upon me. (Auto-biography, p. 139)Before returning home aft er tending to these most worldly of secu-lar aff airs, Kongtrul asks and receives a dispensation for the monastery (Palpung , where he once lived and which hosted his hermitage) from retribution on the part of the forces he has just aided. As Kongtrul had noted earlier, “Our monastery of Palpung was in danger of being attacked, since it harbored some who were very hostile to the government force” (ibid., p. 139). In recompense for his help, he slylyTOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 14TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 146/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 15. . . made a petition on behalf of everyone connected to Palpung , mentioning every name I knew, and this landed well on the ear of the commander, who gave me his promise that everyone under the jurisdiction of Palpung, both the monastery and the surrounding countryside, would be spared any aggression. Th en, while the war with the Nyarong forces was still raging , I returned home. (ibid., p. 139)Although I do not believe such events infl uenced his writing, it was in the midst of times of such “great tumult and anxiety” that Jamgön Kongtrul wrote Th e Treasury of Knowledge. He was no innocent other-worldly monk; he seems to have known secular and church history as well as anyone in his day. Events in his life forced him to navigate oft en in a public role in turbulent, tricky waters that were not his own, those of church or state aff airs at the highest level in his region of Eastern Tibet, the kingdom of Dergé.Two concerns led me to include the preceding passages from Kong-trul’s autobiography. First, for those unfamiliar with his autobiography and other writing, I wanted to show that he knew how to write a story, a talent he rarely exhibits in the pages translated here. Kongtrul mas-tered many styles; the one we read in Th e Treasury of Knowledge refl ects a deliberate choice, not his limitations as a writer. Second, we can eas-ily prejudge a nineteenth-century Tibetan lama and imagine that his circumstances had so little in common with our own that we would be unwise to lend him much credence. Admittedly, he owned none of the gadgets or machines, large and small, with which we surround ourselves; then again, neither did the greats of the past whose writings constitute the touchstones of our own cultures. Yes, he was a monk who lived in a retreat center, but he was also a painter, a medical doctor, a prolifi c writer, an astrologer, an administrator, a meditation instructor, and a competent if unwilling military strategist who could be called upon to keep his cool in the thick of battle during a major civil war. Compared to his degree of involvement in active life, and in ongoing relations with men and women of high or humble station in his world, our average modern lives can seem coddled and cocooned.How easy it is to think when we read a long-dead foreigner’s writing, “He is a clerg yman preaching to his choir,” “He could never understand our lives these days,” “We have nothing in common.” What if those sup-positions were unfounded? What if Kongtrul had a fuller life than ours, TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 15TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 156/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeand what if he wrote with exactly our mentality in mind, to help us evolve toward a better understanding of ourselves and the world? It is likely that if he were alive today, transported from his time and place, we would fi nd him as innocently amazed as our own ancestors would be when encoun-tering modern inventions. Yet I also think he would fi nd us, stripped of those labor-saving devices that few among us could explain let alone repair, to be dangerously naïve and unprepared in relation to the facts of life that have not changed since his day, that will never change: the raw realities of birth, aging, the wretched sicknesses and other calamities that strike all ages indiscriminately, and death.What if Kongtrul wrote as our spiritual friend and mentor who not only understood us as human beings but wished us well and chose his words accordingly? If Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet is the fi rst book of Th e Treasury of Knowledge one reads, it might be diffi cult to glimpse Kong-trul’s underlying intent. Th e original, integral Tibetan text is more reveal-ing : we pass from the last lines of Myriad Worlds directly into Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet. Th us, a reader would wade into the subjects of the Bud-dha, his teaching, and the saga of Buddhist history having just read these words:Th e outer world and the fi ve [types] of objects that fi nd sup-port in it—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch—do not exist anywhere, externally or internally. Nonetheless, due to object-oriented instincts, objects appear to the mind as if they were externally existent. (Myriad Worlds, p. 200)Because of body-oriented instincts, the six types of beings—the matrices for the arising of subject and object—adhere intense-ly to [their] individual forms and [their functions in terms of ] object, agent, and action. Even while dreaming, they adhere to their bodies [as real]. Consequently, they experience plea-sure and pain, and the strength of the three types of instincts increases, causing deceptive subjective and objective appear-ances to manifest. Rejection or acceptance of those [deceptive appearances] increases the power of obscuring emotions, lead-ing to the accumulation of evolutionary actions. In this way, the beginningless and endless chain of cyclic life continuously recreates itself.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 16TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 166/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 17Instincts [created] from time without beginning produced our succession of past lives.

With this realization, the basis of deception collapses from its inner core. Deceptive appearances are exhausted within the sphere of reality, and liberation, supreme happiness, is at-tained. (ibid., p. 202)Based on what has been explained above, one trains in the cru-cial body postures, ways of gazing , and breathing techniques in relation to the targets of external and internal objects.

(ibid., p. 227)Again in the original Tibetan, on completion of the sections translated in Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet, Kongtrul leaves the sweeping horizon of his-tory for the intensely personal subject of a teacher-student relationship. On the fi rst page of the following book, Buddhist Ethics, we again read Kongtrul speaking to us directly:Th e source of our present and lasting happiness and well-being is the precious teaching of the Buddha. Just to hear its name is rare, how much more to encounter it. Now that the Buddha’s teaching is known in this world and you are a human being whose life is replete with leisure and endowments, do not waste this opportunity, for such a life is a wish-fulfi lling jewel.

(Buddhist Ethics, p. 39)Is Kongtrul proselytizing ? Is Th e Treasury of Knowledge a treatise or a tract? I would speculate that Kongtrul imagined he was writing to a one hundred percent Buddhist audience not in need of conversion. I would guess that he wished his Tibetan readers would use his writing to guide themselves from the relative comfort of being faithful Buddhists to the ultimate sanctuary of being Buddha. Th e Treasury of Knowledge has been called a kind of encyclopedia, and to a point that is true, but an Encyclo-pedia Britannica it is not: as rich in information as it is, Th e Treasury of Knowledge does not present information for information’s (or for study’s) sake. While Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet presents a full picture of the past, Th e Treasury of Knowledge overall dwells in the present and points to the near future: we can fi nd ourselves on its detailed map of the path to awak-ening and we learn much of what we need for our personal journey to enlightenment.Kalu Rinpoché and the Purpose of the Translation of The Treasury of KnowledgeHad Jamgön Kongtrul only written Th e Treasury of Knowledge and a few minor works, he might have been more eloquent concerning his motiva-tions and intentions in composing them. As it was, his other writings and compilations, given the collective name of Th e Five Treasuries, dwarfed this Treasury, by far the smallest of the fi ve. He did relatively little to extol this treatise. Kalu Rinpoché, who initiated the translation of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, could enjoy no such luxury: the project he had in mind towered over any previous translation from Tibetan to a Western lan-guage. In his own quiet way, he had to proselytize.When Kalu Rinpoché fi rst gathered his Western disciples around him to propose the translation of Jamgön Kongtrul’s Treasury of Knowledge, he knew his fi rst task was to convince us of the necessity of the undertak-ing. Specifi cally, why had he chosen this mammoth work, by itself sig-nifi cant enough to be counted as the fi rst among Jamgön Kongtrul’s fi ve treasuries?To the translators, and then to anyone who asked what he was doing with the fi nal few years of his life, Kalu Rinpoché would explain that Th e TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 18TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 186/14/10 3:51:40 PM6/14/10 3:51:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 19Treasury of Knowledge served as an ideal springboard for the study and practice of Buddhism: a reader could fi nd there any subject grounded in its proper context, be it the Buddhist view, meditation, or conduct, or the basis, path, and result of Buddhist training. Once well informed of where a topic fi t into the larger scheme, a reader could then search for more detailed information elsewhere. Rinpoché would further remark that Th e Treasury of Knowledge could likewise be used by more sophisti-cated readers at the end of specialized studies and practice, to reacquaint themselves with the entire breadth and depth of the Buddhist experience. He said that he considered Th e Treasury of Knowledge as both a spring and an ocean, both a point of departure and the fi nal destination.Once we translators had grasped the nature of the work we had been asked to undertake—the scope of Th e Treasury of Knowledge and our individual task within it—that understanding alone did not necessarily persuade us of the wisdom of the project itself. While that is a somewhat embarrassing admission, it may help you, an intrepid reader faced with the daunting prospect of absorbing Th e Treasury of Knowledge, to know that we initially as readers and then as translators struggled with ques-tions concerning its relevance and purpose. With time, I believe we have come to a shared understanding and deep appreciation of Kalu Rinpo-ché’s choice of this work, and the deep purpose of the project.As Sarah Harding recounts in her preface to Esoteric Instructions, Rinpo-ché began speaking of his plans for a translation committee in 1986. He was eighty-one years old at the time, traveling throughout North America and teaching on a schedule that would challenge someone half his age. I had accompanied him as a translator and attendant throughout Asia until Hawaii during that tour, and I can attest that at that point Rinpoché never hinted of a nascent translation project bubbling in his mind. Yet by the time he returned to Hawaii, it was all he wanted to talk about. I had come from Asia to accompany him back home, and found him enthused and energized by a good idea whose time had surely come.In subsequent private conversations, he noted two things that had wak-ened him to the necessity of setting this translation in motion. First was his fi nal meeting with His Holiness Dujom Rinpoché in France, prob-ably in 1985. Kalu Rinpoché told me he had always assumed that Dujom Rinpoché would head a major translation project in the West. Th at lama, one of Kalu Rinpoché’s teachers and just one year his senior, had settled in France and gathered around him many excellent Western disciples.

Kalu Rinpo-ché would have gladly given his full support to Dujom Rinpoché had he decided to start a project on the scale of Th e Treasury of Knowledge. Yet no such project was in the brewing ; Dujom Rinpoché was clearly exhibiting signs of poor health (he passed away in 1987). Kalu Rinpoché felt the bur-den fall to him. And a burden it was: Kalu Rinpoché felt ill-suited to the job of heading a translation project: his active life had been centered on teaching meditation, not on scholastic endeavors or writing. Neverthe-less, he was still well and also led a sizable group of bilingual disciples.Meeting those disciples again in North America in 1986 proved to be the second and deciding spur to Kalu Rinpoché’s plans. Sarah Harding reports that she off ered a seemingly royal “‘our’ everlasting translation service in whatever way he saw fi t” and that later Rinpoché announced during a radio interview the formation of “a committee to translate the entire Buddhist canon” (Esoteric Instructions, p. 13). In the end, Rinpoché scaled down his ambitions to Th e Treasury of Knowledge, and quickly con-tacted prospective translators. In our conversations aft er leaving North America, he didn’t recount Sarah Harding’s off er, but did mention her and Richard Barron, two of his most gift ed translators, of whom he was particularly fond. He didn’t want to lose their talents to lesser projects; he hoped his plans would give them a challenge at the level of their capa-bilities. I got the impression that he felt the tasks of a “Dharma center” translator—oral translation of elementary teachings and written transla-tion of relatively short texts of rituals or meditation instruction—were confi ning them to living below their intellectual means.Another individual who had an impact on the early planning of the project was a Buddhist scholar who walked into Kalu Rinpoché’s room at his monastery in India for an interview just as Rinpoché completed his fi rst draft of an announcement of his translation committee plans. Dr. Daniel Perdue’s timing was “auspicious” as the Tibetans say, and Rinpo-ché always treasured that serendipitous fi rst encounter with the man who would become his earliest go-to scholar, trusted for his capacious mind, sunny disposition, and warm, generous heart. Th e following paragraph is excerpted from what Rinpoché wrote that day:Th e world is currently experiencing unprecedented material development and the discovery of new scientifi c knowledge, TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 20TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 206/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 21creating good fortune and well-being for everyone. At such a time as this, the unsurpassable wisdom of Buddhism can bring immense happiness and benefi t to humanity. Th is wisdom is contained in the great treatise Th e Treasury of Knowledge, written by Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé (1813–1900), the nonsectar-ian master of all Buddhist teachings whose life was prophesied by the Buddha. If this great work is translated into English, the nature of all existence and nirvana will appear as vividly as a refl ection in a clear mirror in the minds of the most learned people in the world, as though the expanse of their under-standing were illuminated with sunlight.Th is is how Rinpoché “sold” his project to us, and to his disciples worldwide. He felt that Buddhism’s wisdom culture perfectly matched the depth and complexity of modern life. Yes, he spent years of his life in solitary meditation retreat, oft en in conditions of extreme hardship, and he routinely encouraged renunciation—a life of immersion in study, contemplation, and meditation. Nonetheless, his vision of Buddhism’s place in the world was not as a marginal faith for reclusive individuals. As we can read in the above paragraph, he strove to wed Buddhism to the best of modern, secular education and technological progress. Buddhism could share its compassionate heart, advanced meditation techniques, and insightful wisdom with modern, well-educated persons in Asia and the West, giving them the best of both worlds. Kalu Rinpoché’s commit-ment to Buddhism beyond his own personal practice was based on the simple belief that it could contribute signifi cantly to the modern world by bringing our material and spiritual lives into balance. He felt confi dent that we would receive his Buddhism—Himalayan tantric Buddhism at that—as relevant and up-to-date. Th is belief bore witness to his trust in the eventual readership of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, and, incidentally, to dizzyingly high expectations for his translators.For us translators, he wrote the following prayer to help us join our intentions with his in the course of our work:For the sake of all beings whose numbers fi ll all space—Each one at some time my parent—And especially for all humanity of this world,I give rise to this aspiration:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 21TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 216/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeMay all come to know, in their own languages,Th e enlightened ones’ teachings, epitomized by scriptures and realization,And may all develop the extraordinary wisdomTh at is the understanding of cyclic existence and transcendent states.May this dispel the dark oblivion of ignorance,And based on the Buddhist view, meditation, and conduct,May all accomplish what is meaningful for themselves and othersAnd so come to realize perfect enlightenment.Now that I have developed this awakened aspiration,Th e force of my intention will not diminishUntil I reach this very goal.Lamas, buddhas, and bodhisattvas, bear witness to this,And as I have made this commitment,Th ink of me as your child!Inspire us all so that the brilliance of wisdom from study, refl ection, and meditationMay blaze in the minds of all.May whatever is benefi cial for the doctrine and for all beingsArise throughout the infi nity of space.Although he had us focus our attention exclusively on Th e Treasury of Knowledge, we noted that this aspiration points beyond a single text to “the enlightened ones’ teachings,” a scale that was (and remains) truly intimidating to contemplate. As written in the preface of Myriad Worlds, Kalu Rinpoché added to this prayer of aspiration some succinct advice concerning what audience we were to imagine we wrote for as we translated:Venerable Kalu Rinpoché originally suggested three principles to follow in the translation of this work: literal, accurate, and accessible. He felt that our eff orts should be aimed at trans-lating the actual text into English (tshig bsg yur—translating the words) rather than at interpreting the text in English (don TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 22TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 226/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 23bsg yur—translating the meaning ). Secondly, he was more interested in an accurate translation than one that sacrifi ced accuracy for elegance. Finally, he encouraged us to use a vocab-ulary that would be accessible to the average educated reader rather than a highly technical vocabulary that depended on prior training in Buddhist or East Asian studies. (Myriad Worlds, p. 11)On the subject of Kalu Rinpoché’s intentions, the last sentence in this passage reveals an important key. In his own phrasing, we were to aim for a readership of those “who had gained a university degree” (by which I assumed he meant at least a BA or its equivalent) “but who did not intend to become Buddhist scholars.” Th e preface goes on to remark, “Reasonable and sensible as these principles are . . .” and then eloquently describes the conundrums and coping strategies of all Treasury of Knowl-edge translators who received Rinpoché’s unsolvable koan at the core of his vision for our work. I will return to this subject in a later section of this introduction.Whatever the practicality of Rinpoché’s directives, his objective for Th e Treasury of Knowledge seems to coincide with Kongtrul’s resolve at the outset of the text’s composition, to write “something that would be of use to people who had not studied much.” In mid-nineteenth-century Tibet, that meant persons who were literate but had not embarked upon a career in Buddhist academia. In the late twentieth century, Kalu Rinpo-ché transposed that audience to our context: persons with a reasonable degree of education able to appreciate ideas from outside the common worldview, but not necessarily Buddhists or prospective scholars of Buddhism.Like Jamgön Kongtrul, Kalu Rinpoché had a second target audience in mind for Th e Treasury of Knowledge: both of them wished for it to be read by a tiny group—those entering three-year, three-month retreats. Above, I included Kongtrul’s advice to those entering retreat under his guidance to at least read the section of Th e Treasury now entitled Bud-dhist Ethics. In his last public talk outside his home (given in Bodhgaya, India, in early 1989), Kalu Rinpoché looked back over his years of teach-ing throughout the world. He said that his central hope in founding so many meditation centers far and wide was that they would lead to the establishment of three-year, three-month retreat centers, an important TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 23TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 236/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeinstitution for training meditators in Tibetan Buddhism’s Kag yu and Nyingma orders. As gratifi ed as he was at the success of those plans and his tireless eff orts, he felt that the results of those retreats would be greatly improved if men and women entered retreat having read Th e Treasury of Knowledge. 2Meditation in retreat, his own or others’, consumed most of Kalu Rinpoché’s life: he entered a three-year, three-month retreat (in the insti-tution Jamgön Kongtrul founded, at a place called Tsadra Rinchen Drak) at the age of fi ft een; then at the age of twenty-four, he spent twelve years as a vagabond retreatant, living in caves or tents in eastern Tibet. Th ose happy years ended when his teacher insisted he assume the leadership of the retreat at Tsadra. From that point on, wherever Kalu Rinpoché called home—Tibet, Bhutan, and India—he built and led three-year retreats. By his own testimony, the establishment of the same retreat institutions outside the Himalayan region was his goal over many years of tireless teaching throughout the world. His closest disciple, Bokar Rinpoché, lived a life centered on the same institution: he entered a three-year retreat at Karmapa’s monastery in central Tibet, but had to leave retreat to escape the Chinese takeover in 1959. He later completed two three-year, three-month retreats at Kalu Rinpoché’s monastery near Darjeeling, India. When Bokar Rinpoché built his own monastery nearby, he con-structed not one but two three-year retreat centers on its adjacent land. Kalu Rinpoché’s closest friend in his later years, Chatral Rinpoché, also devoted his early life to meditation in retreat and has founded a number of three-year retreat centers in Nepal, India, and Bhutan.In relation to his lifelong career as a retreat master, the translation of Th e Treasury of Knowledge marked a change in approach for Kalu Rinpo-ché, but only at a superfi cial level. His private confi dences during the last years of his life matched his public statements: he initiated this translation project to help the world in general, the worldwide Buddhist community, and the few of his disciples willing and able to embark upon long-term retreats. He did not entertain any false dichotomy between the study and practice of Buddhism—they are hardly opposed to one another! Yet he upheld and exuded the spirit of Buddhist practice fi rst and foremost, and this was refl ected in his choices of spiritual teachers, companions, and disciples, as well as in his life’s defi ning acts and teaching.

He was no spiritual snob, yet he had a specifi c domain of spe-cialization—the meditation techniques of Himalayan tantric Buddhism. He knew that readers could use Th e Treasury of Knowledge in a variety of ways, but his personal motivation in spearheading the translation project was to improve everyone’s comprehension of the path to which he (and Kongtrul) had dedicated his life.Absent from Kongtrul’s writings and Kalu Rinpoché’s remarks is any mention of what might seem to some the most obvious use of Th e Treasury of Knowledge—as a textbook for study. Neither Kongtrul nor Kalu Rinpoché attended or founded Buddhist colleges; both trained as young monks in three-year, three-month retreats, and both later founded and guided that same kind of institution. Despite their lack of personal experience with Tibetan higher education, both certainly knew that traditional Buddhist colleges delved into the subjects on their curricula in much greater depth than Th e Treasury of Knowledge, and that most Buddhist colleges in old Tibet did not include tantra in their programs, which would exclude major sections of Th e Treasury. While not an ideal textbook in its native land, this work’s inclusiveness can have a positive eff ect on members of the Buddhist intelligentsia who sometimes exit from years of laudably intensive immersion in study or meditation prac-tice with an excess of chauvinistic school loyalty, which exposure to Th e Treasury can soft en, as Sarah Harding points out:[E]xposure to the vast array of techniques virtually forces one to accept that they are more or less the same, and therefore are all equally valid Buddhist teachings. Th e diff erences that are fi ne-tuned to the individual are, aft er all, very minor and the similarities in being viable techniques on the path to awaken-ing are dominant. Each tradition is profound and brilliant in its own right, once it is glimpsed. It must be seen to be believed. But if a person comprehends only a single philosophical pre-sentation or one esoteric instruction and becomes fi xated on it as truth, then the rumors of alternatives will seem strange and erroneous. (Esoteric Instructions, p. 34)By the standards of classical Tibetan education, Th e Treasury of Knowledge is as Kalu Rinpoché described it—a starting point or a brief concluding summation.

As massive and as comprehensive as Th e Treasury appears, its primary target audience, yesterday in Tibet or today outside Tibet, is in fact as Jamgön Kongtrul and Kalu Rinpoché intended: those of us without a topnotch Buddhist education.Paying for the Translation of The Treasury of KnowledgeLaunching the grand idea of a translation project on the scale of Th e Trea-sury of Knowledge was audacious enough, but once he had done so, Kalu Rinpoché had to fi nd a way to fi nance the project. Th erein lies a tale.In the beginning , translators were asked to work on their respective chapters at home in their spare time, for free. To my knowledge, there was never any discussion of compensation. We were invited to join Kalu Rinpoché, Bokar Rinpoché, and Khenpo Lodrö Dönyö in Bodhgaya, India, during three months in the winters of 1987–88, and 1988–89, peri-ods of all-day, seven-days-a-week group work on the translation. Each translator was responsible for all travel expenses; once at our destination, we were housed and fed at monasteries in this most sacred of Buddhist pilgrimage places. By 1988, Kalu Rinpoché had decided that some of us should move to his monastery near Darjeeling, India, to work full time on the translation. Th at decision changed the dynamic: in asking us to leave our lives and work in the world behind, he knew we were also aban-doning any source of income. From that point on (beginning in 1989), he was responsible for us.In 1988, he traveled with Bokar Rinpoché and around twenty lamas from his monastery through southeast Asia, to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. (I accompanied them as interpreter, travel coor-dinator, and lama herder.) In the past, Kalu Rinpoché had never used his travels and teaching for fundraising, except if the funds were destined for the establishment or strengthening of Buddhist projects in the specifi c location where he taught. Th is had always been one of his guiding prin-ciples. He told each audience that he was changing his approach in the case of this exceptional project that would benefi t all Buddhist communi-ties equally: could they please support the translation project which he would describe in detail. In each major city or country, he would appoint TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 26TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 266/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 27trusted disciples to collect donations, and he gave them a bank account number in Hong Kong for deposits.Having planted those seeds during an extremely successful teaching tour, his last in those countries, he expected to be pleased with the results when we returned to Hong Kong many months later, aft er his last over-seas trip (to Los Angeles). His general-secretary returned from a visit to the bank indisposed: not one dollar had been deposited there. Not one.Th is revealed one of the only mysteries of Tibetan Buddhism that forever perplexed Kalu Rinpoché: he had helped raise thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of dollars worldwide for buildings—monaster-ies, retreat centers, public meditation centers, and stupas (monuments in honor of the Buddha’s wisdom). And he had done so with ease: his word was gold, as it were. Yet now his repeated eloquent requests for help were not even worth brass or tin. We were dumbfounded.All was not lost, however. One Chinese woman invited Rinpoché to a meal in a restaurant in Los Angeles and over dessert gave him a check for $40,000 for his translation project. And one kind couple in Malaysia (Foo Chong Hong and Pang Wing Hai of Ipoh, Malaysia) did collect and transmit donations for the project as well. During Rinpoché’s last months (he passed away fi ve months aft er our return from the US), these were the sole signifi cant rays of hope for the translation project’s long-term survival.Many well-meaning persons asked Rinpoché to locate the translation committee in Europe or North America. While he might have seriously considered another option had there been indications of dependable, generous support, all signs pointed instead toward home, his monastery in the Darjeeling hills of northeast India. Th ere, the translators were installed in a separate building on a hill overlooking the main temple and Rinpoché’s residence. Be it ever so humble—some rooms’ walls let air and light in, the only running water fl owed from a tap in the courtyard, the two toilets were holes in the fl oor of an adjacent building, the bath/shower room in the same structure also had a hole in the fl oor and nothing else, not even running water. Electricity in that region was spotty, oft en off for days at a time. Food was prepared by young , and extraordinarily good-natured, monks. Every month, Rinpoché would call us down to his room and hand us each our monthly wages—at the time the equivalent in Indian rupees of $20 US—for work that continued seven days a week.If we compared ourselves to middle-class Westerners, we had wandered TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 27TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 276/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeinto a hardship setting. But if we looked outside our windows, we were living comparatively privileged lives. Th e house we occupied had been built to house His Holiness Karmapa, head of the Kag yu order, on the occasion of his visit to the monastery some years before. Kalu Rinpo-ché’s home was slightly better equipped, but he had moved into it when over seventy years of age. I was once asked to stay in his old rooms at the monastery for a week while their occupant was away; from that experi-ence, I can attest that the rooms he used to live in all those years were not up to our standard. Next door to the monastery, including the transla-tors’ house, a Tibetan refugee camp perched on the hillside, again mak-ing our home and conditions look palatial. Beyond our village we had all seen, heard, and smelled the panorama of India’s billion-plus human kaleidoscope. Rinpoché had trained us over the years to not think of ourselves as any diff erent or more deserving than the least of our Indian or Tibetan sisters and brothers. Did he want better for us? Perhaps. While in the United States, he had stated that he wanted to pay us $100 per month . . .Most of the translators had completed at least one if not two three-year, three-month retreats under Kalu Rinpoché’s direction. Although these retreats had taken place in Europe or North America, their con-ditions were rougher than our living conditions in India. For example, in France where Ingrid McLeod, Sarah Harding , Richard Barron, and I completed our retreats (or in upstate New York, where Elizabeth Cal-lahan did hers), our rooms were unheated—water would freeze in the off ering bowls, the toilets were also squat style, our daily schedule began at four AM and ended at nine PM with one day (Tibetan New Year) off each year, and we had no beds, as Rinpoché asked us to not lie down for the duration of the retreat, including while sleeping. And of course not only were we unpaid during our retreats, we had to work and save beforehand to aff ord it. Our lives at Rinpoché’s monastery in India were less rigorous than what we had known during the period we had spent in retreat, what seemed to most of us like the best, most productive (if one can call sitting alone in a room doing next to nothing—i.e., praying or meditating— “productive”), and oft en happiest years of our lives. No one in Buddhism fetishizes poverty, yet individuals dedicated to living a life centered on meditation practice commonly aim to live in cir-cumstances best described as modest to humble, close to the standards shared by the majority of the decent and unpretentious human beings TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 28TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 286/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 29on this planet. Th e value of simplicity is not something that is preached but not practiced by our spiritual leaders: the meditation masters who have most immersed themselves in Buddhist practice usually continue to prize a simple life. During my years in India, Kalu Rinpoché, Bokar Rinpoché, and Chatral Rinpoché all lived in villages in the Darjeeling district, all in rooms that warmly welcomed but did not impress. Local people would visit to pay their respects; if they left intimidated it would be due only to the presence of these gurus, and not because of their mate-rial surroundings. For instance, the room in which Kalu Rinpoché passed away was so small that when we moved his small bed away from the wall a few minutes before his passing, to allow those attending him to fi t in the room, no more than one person could fi t between the bed and the wall at any one point along its length. Th ere was a single window at one end. Yet it was there that he spent the better part of his days, meditat-ing, taking his meals, or meeting a constant stream of visitors. If he had a more formal interview or meeting , or gave a talk to a group, he would use an adjoining room that included a cabinet with religious statues and objects, and had many more windows. Even that room was smaller than many bedrooms in modern middle-class homes. Bokar Rinpoché’s room was furnished only with a wooden frame such as we used to sit in during three-year retreats, the frame used to support one’s back while sleeping sitting up. I assumed he slept lying down on a separate mattress, but I never asked. Chatral Rinpoché did have a mattress when I visited him during those years, but it was always placed directly on the fl oor, and it was there that he sat during the day. Please note that each of these masters ate, slept, meditated, read, wrote, received visitors, hosted meetings, and gave teachings all in the same small rooms. Th eir living spaces did not include a single chair or a couch or a television or a telephone (Chatral Rinpoché used to own a radio). I have spent hours, days, months with each of them, and I cannot recall them ever leaning against a wall or other back support, except in vehicles. Th ey would spend their days relaxed sit-ting cross-legged, alert and engrossed in the tasks at hand, working or in conversation or in silent ease. Th ey each had a gentle and lively sense of humor. Even people with no special faith felt as if they drank with them the cool, pure, fresh water of human communion. Th ose with faith, even some non-Buddhists, left meetings with them inebriated with the potent, exhilarating elixir of spiritual communion.We translators had long admired these teachers and strove to emulate TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 29TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 296/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeand to serve them. Our lives with them entailed a healthy dose of hard-ship but little or no suff ering.Aft er Kalu Rinpoché left us in May, 1989, we counted among our losses that of the sole spokesperson and fundraiser for the translation project. Th ings looked dire. Soon thereaft er I received a letter from a Japanese man who felt inspired to support the continuation of our work. He had met me as Rinpoché’s translator during our tour of Japan two years before, and asked me to act as the committee’s representative, to come once a month to Japan to report on the work’s progress, and to ask for and to receive funds. In Asia, all is negotiable, and I held out for trips every three or four months. I would speak to him through an interpreter, present the next quarter’s plan—this many translators, these expenses, including their travel and the $100 per month salary Rinpoché had once envisioned—and receive a couple of days later a thick stack of hundred dollar bills.Th is proved ideal for a while, and defi nitely relieved a signifi cant strain from the monastery’s budget. But it did not have a happy ending. Over time, aft er a number of trips to Japan, I noticed that each departure was preceded by some outer upheaval, small but disturbing accidents, or troubling dreams. One always has to be extremely cautious when trying to pinpoint the source of upheavals: when I encounter the unpleasant eff ects of my ignoble thoughts, words, or deeds, I can scarcely believe they belong to me, and are entirely of my own making. Surely someone else, or samsara’s own treachery, is responsible. Th erefore, I spent a long time in introspection, continuing to travel regularly to our benefactor, while trying as best I could to examine myself—what was my motivation? How was I subverting this perfect situation? Our faultlessly polite and unde-manding sponsor was happy to support Kalu Rinpoché’s work, and the translators were entirely grateful.My inner turmoil reached a crescendo. I dutifully dragged myself to Tokyo one more time, but try as I might, I could not manage to force myself to meet with our sponsor. I called instead and asked him to send future donations to the fateful Hong Kong bank account, fi rm in the con-fi dence that it was a terrestrial black hole. And so it proved to be once more.It was very hard to walk away from cold hard cash given in whatever quantity I asked for, and without a single request for receipts. Nothing more was asked of me and of our group than we continue to do our best TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 30TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 306/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 31to complete the work Kalu Rinpoché had asked of us. Th en and now I am amazed and deeply grateful to my colleagues, none of whom voiced a single word of blame or complaint when I returned from that trip empty-handed, with the very bad news that our sponsorship had likely come to an end thanks to a capricious failure of my will. Th e fl ush times of $100/month salaries had ended, we would have to rely on the monastery and on ourselves. I have not saved the date; it was during 1991 or 1992. I’ve never heard from that generous man since, but I know exactly where I could fi nd him if I wanted to renew contact: on Japan’s death row, where he sits having been judged guilty for masterminding the 1995 sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway.Over the next few years our numbers dwindled. Th e reasons for my departure were both personal and typical in that I felt unwillingly wrenched from a sinking ship. We all felt a strong commitment to the project, but all but the strongest of us were unable to match our inten-tions with our acts. In my case, I had regular bouts of bronchitis in the mile-high cold and damp hills that provide the perfect conditions for some of the world’s best tea and most intractable lung diseases. At each point when I thought I would never again stop coughing or sleep a full night, I would take a short trip to the hot and dry plains not far away, and my cough would disappear by itself. I was not alone among the trans-lators with bouts of bronchitis, dysentery, and malaria—unremarkable door prizes for those who live more or less as the local people do, things we dealt with and learned to take in stride. But I balked when I tested positive for tuberculosis, aft er the sunny plains did not work their magic and my lungs remained leaden.Each one of us faced the same predicament: our coping strategies ran up against an immovable predicament that loomed too large, and we left . I will always regret leaving, and I will always marvel at those who stayed. For it is not that they did not face exactly the same kinds of crossroads, each in his or her own way. Th ey simply decided to do as we had been trained to do: to sit through it, living on faith, devotion, and insight. I cannot say whether such persons have “happy” lives, but I am fairly con-fi dent they will have exemplary deaths.To the best of my knowledge, once our Japanese sponsorship ended, the monastery became the main source of support for the translation com-mittee . . . until the appearance of Tsadra Foundation, which allowed TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 31TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 316/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeBokar Rinpoché to revive the project, and to contact us far-fl ung transla-tors in the hope that its magnanimous sponsorship would allow us to complete the work we’d started. No one, including Kalu Rinpoché, ever imagined it would take this long, or be this arduous. No one could have predicted the enormous cost of these last years of work, for time in the modern world away from Tibetan monasteries is incalculably expensive. Th e directors of Tsadra Foundation—Eric and Andrea Colombel, and Lama Drubg yu Tenzin (Anthony Chapman)—have achieved a rare bal-ance of tenacity and generosity in embracing Kalu Rinpoché’s original vision of Th e Treasury of Knowledge. Kalu Rinpoché supplied the inspira-tion and the direction, the translators the manpower, and Tsadra Founda-tion the means to realize Rinpoché’s intentions. He fi rmly believed that Th e Treasury of Knowledge will have a very positive impact in our world; we owe Tsadra Foundation our deepest gratitude for sharing that belief and nurturing the project to its completion.My purpose in writing this section is to mull over some of the practical details concerning a translation project of this size. During Kalu Rinpo-ché’s lifetime, the Buddhist community exhibited faint enthusiasm for funding translation projects. Many very kind people made signifi cant donations to our work, but their helping hands were not joined by many others. Major translation projects need major funding , even when they are located in the hinterlands of the Himalayas. In the past, both in the anglophone world, as in the Tibetan, kings, not commoners, have funded the most signifi cant, lasting translations. I have King James of England, and King Trisong Déutsen and King Ralpachen of Tibet in mind; Chi-nese emperors also sponsored Buddhist translations in their country. Emperors and kings oft en have blood on their hands, for fl eeting good or ill, yet translators (and those concerned with other religious projects, many of which have involved large amounts of wood and stone) have accepted their support over the ages, providing an avenue for Caesar to do some rendering of his own. We might wish for philanthropic founda-tions whose leaders have hearts as pure as new driven snow, but along the arc of Buddhist history the likes of Tsadra Foundation are as rare as daytime stars.If there is any lesson in our experience with the relatively small work called Th e Treasury of Knowledge, it is this: Let no one underestimate the time, energ y, and resources necessary to bring to fruition the monumen-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 32TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 326/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 33tal translation work that lies before us as Buddhism takes root in new cultures and languages.The Treasury in TranslationFor all that Kalu Rinpoché fi rst aimed at Sarah Harding and Richard Barron, his arrows hit Ingrid McLeod and Elio Guarisco, the translation team responsible above all other contributors for ensuring the continuity and eventual success of his translation project. Although every book in this series can be considered a work of many hands, these two have been primarily responsible for bringing four of the series’ ten books to comple-tion: Myriad Worlds, Buddhist Ethics, Systems of Buddhist Tantra, and Th e Elements of Tantric Practice. Without their consistent willingness to do the heavy lift ing through thick and very, very thin (in terms of others’ contributions) over the years, it is hard to imagine any other books of the series ever seeing the light of day in our time. I write in awe of their ability to accomplish what I could not, and in deep appreciation that their dedi-cation has resulted in the fulfi llment of Kalu Rinpoché’s wishes. We all thought we wanted that; only they had the strength of character to accept the tremendous sacrifi ces necessary to actually make it happen. Th ere is a story of gentle courage here; it is theirs alone to tell.I return to them and their work in this section because they represent the heart of this translation project. Th ey fi rst presented Kalu Rinpoché’s “three principles” to the reader in their preface to Myriad Worlds, con-scientiously laying forth what Rinpoché had asked of us, and honestly appraising the practicality of his requests. In later books, their choices and strategies changed and evolved, as might be expected in a series of books on such diverse subjects, translated over the course of twenty years. As they note, “translations and translators also evolve. . . Such evolution is important, as to lay out the standards a priori would result in lifeless and probably inaccurate renderings” (Systems of Buddhist Tantra, p. 52). Each of the other translators in this series—Sarah Harding, Elizabeth Calla-han, Richard Barron, and Gyurmé Dorjé—has had to grapple with very diff erent sets of challenges in the translation of each respective book, and each has triumphed in her or his own way. Please don’t take my word for it: read their books, landmark publications all.Th e general challenge the other translators have faced originates in the fact that their work has been ground-breaking. We simply cannot fi nd TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 33TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 336/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgebooks in English that match their clarity and comprehensiveness. Read-ers could wade through Myriad Worlds with the idea that its subject, cos-molog y, was located in another dimension and only familiar for being so other-worldly, a kind of Buddhist science fi ction. Th e seriousness of the other books (published or forthcoming ) cannot be so easily defl ected. Here we have a book leading us to the summit of Buddhist philosophy, here another with full details of all levels of Buddhist vows, and then others taking us as deep as possible into the subject of tantra. If these books were matched with similar studies in English on our bookshelves, the translators’ task would have been far lighter.Th e books themselves, too, would have been lighter, quite literally. In one edition (published in Beijing ), the Tibetan originals of Myriad Worlds and Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy are practically the same length; the latter text is two pages longer. I do not believe the diff er-ence in the English editions refl ects personal choices in translation styles (Myriad Worlds ends with a mere twenty-fi ve pages of endnotes, most of which were light and easy, just notes; Frameworks has eight hundred and eighty-eight notes covering more than a hundred pages with dense infor-mation. For its part, Buddhist Ethics included over a thousand robust notes covering over one hundred and seventy pages. Th e notes portions of Elements of Tantric Practice are in fact longer even in their smaller type than the translated commentary they embellish). Th is evolution of style was driven by love of the author, the reader, and the material, and a wish to best connect the three. If our bookshelves already bulged with books in English on the intricate workings of Buddhist tantra, the two phases of tantric meditation, the three levels of vows, and the esoteric instruc-tions that fueled Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, Th e Treasury of Knowledge books would have been slimmer and what is left of the transla-tors’ hair would be less grey.Translators of Buddhist books also face another fact: we read diff er-ently than our Asian Buddhist sisters and brothers. We expect to read and understand a book on our own; an author (or translator) is judged by the ability to articulate a subject within the confi nes of a book’s cov-ers. Whatever it takes is supposed to be found there. Kongtrul wrote for a Buddhist culture in which groups of adults spend hours, days, weeks, and sometimes even months listening to other adults read books to them, sometimes pausing in their reading to elucidate diffi cult points. Th is is not a scholastic exercise: if you want to read any written word, TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 34TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 346/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 35or even recite it aloud, you ask someone who has once heard the book read in this way to read it to you. Once you have listened to the book, you peruse it yourself and ideally ask the person who read the book to you to clear up the questions your reading elicited. Books were alive in Tibet. Tibetan books sometimes have a notice printed on their title page indicating that the line of readers from the original author to the pres-ent has been broken—the book itself is intact but its living breath has expired. Th is was and is still regarded with sadness as an irretrievable loss, a failure on the part of what we might call Tibet’s country-wide wisdom book clubs. Such books are still read silently and valued, but they only exist on the page.Kongtrul wrote in the knowledge that his readers had access to any number of other texts on the subjects he presented; they represented one of his culture’s major preoccupations. He also expected the human con-nections that accompanied any major work in his culture to always attend his Treasury, and both those assumptions are still correct in the Tibetan world.Modern translators work in the knowledge that their chapters of Th e Treasury of Knowledge have to stand alone in two ways. First, as unique, ground-breaking works, they have few or no companion volumes that approach their depth or scope in Western languages. Second, our culture into which these translations are born receives books, however warmly, without adequate post-natal Buddhist nurturing. Th e books and the readers are on their own. Th e result? If one is a translator who cares for the author, reader, and material: lengthy introductions and hundreds of endnotes. We rue the present situation and yearn for the day when such massive training wheels do not have to accompany important texts—no one imagines that these additional words and information improve the original even slightly—but here we are.Translating and Reading Buddhism’s Journey to TibetWithin Th e Treasury of Knowledge series, the subjects of Books Two, Th ree, and Four are the most immediately accessible for those who are not and have no intention of becoming Buddhist scholars but who wish to learn of or be stimulated by Buddhist ideas. My task as a translator was to get out of the author Jamgön Kongtrul’s way and not to distract you TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 35TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 356/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe reader. Th erefore, I abandoned the endnote-intense style of previous volumes in favor of a lighter main text. As in any book of this series, what Kongtrul wrote is more or less what you will read in translation; in Bud-dhism’s Journey, there will be far fewer numbers to lead you to further explanations. Th is is not to say that there isn’t more that could be said. Th is book unfurls the whole tapestry of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism: Kongtrul weaves hundreds of names and titles of books into his tale, each culled from among a thousand more, and each with its own com-pelling backstory. Further, as each translator learns, what Kongtrul has left unsaid can also prove fascinating. Th ere is so much more that could be told, but during the process of preparing this text, I decided to leave you the reader in Kongtrul’s hands alone. His work here is accessible and edifying exactly as it is; in this book unlike the others in this series, volu-minous notes would have merely refl ected my personal enthusiasms and would not have been a service to Kongtrul or to his new readership.I have enjoyed a lifelong habit of reading Russian history, due to a teenage love of Dostoyevsky, in turn due to a childhood fondness for Tchaikovsky. When I read books on Russia, I cannot retain names and dates as they whiz by, but I didn’t pick up those histories to fi ll my brain with information. I keep coming back to them to appreciate some grand quality in the Russian soul that the country’s epic history reveals. I will not fi nd what I am looking for in the book’s notes. Likewise, and more recently, I have become infatuated by Robert Fagles’ translations of Th e Odyssey, Th e Iliad, and Th e Aeneid. Once again, I am borne by the exhila-rating narrative, which he does not interrupt visually with invitations to pause to consider endnoted or footnoted remarks of analysis of a passage in the text, or of further information concerning specifi c places, persons, gods, or incidents, or their place in later Greek or Roman life and lore. In each book, these details are left to a scholar’s (Bernard Knox) introduc-tion and the translator’s postscript. I did not consciously set out to follow their example, but at a certain point I stood back from this translation and came to the conclusion that its text was intended to draw the reader in and to open up a world.Kongtrul’s project does not seem to have been solely the transfer of knowledge. He occasionally launches into long inventories of names or brief précis of important texts that are far too dense to be easily decoded: what was he thinking ? My guess is that he intended us at some points to savor small tastes from a banquet—this best typifi es Th ai spices, here TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 36TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 366/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 37we have some Ethiopian food, this is considered a delicacy in Denmark, and so on—rather than to sit down to a full meal. Kongtrul knew how to write for his declared “unscholarly” readership: he has left us with other countless, highly accessible texts on myriad subjects, gems of pared-down simplicity and directness. When in Buddhism’s Journey he sometimes veers into jargon that is practically impenetrable to the laypersons he said he wrote for, I have assumed that his words refl ect a deliberate choice and not a lapse. Other Buddhist texts sometimes use the same strateg y—in Th e Flower Ornament Discourse, one of the cornerstone texts of Indian, Tibetan, and Chinese Buddhism, we read sublime instructions inter-spersed with interminable lists of buddhas, bodhisattvas, meditative states, places, and seemingly anything else that can be categorized. Woe to the reader who tries to retain all those words; they overwhelm our ears and memories to help us suspend our information-ingesting mind, so that we might allow ourselves to be held, carried, and set down at another setting of sublime teaching, this time with our mind slightly soft er and more relaxed than before. Th en the process is repeated, and again, over thousands of pages. When I would translate for Kalu Rinpoché, he would typically speak directly to his audience in simple and profound language, “putting buddhahood in the palm of your hand,” as it’s called. Yet occa-sionally he would launch into subjects or styles of discourse that were well beyond anyone in the room. Th e fi rst time this happened, I looked at him and thought, “Really?” then did my job. When he next left his audience gaping in baffl ed wonder, I realized that they weren’t supposed to “get” it: they were being lift ed off their familiar earth where he usually met them verbally and intellectually, and given a tour of small patches of his/the Buddha’s heavens. I have allowed myself to suppose that Kongtrul occa-sionally does likewise in this book, that his Treasury concerns knowledge that is something more than an accumulation of facts and information. Th at of course is nothing more than conjecture on my part, but that opin-ion has informed my choices.What has appeared to me to be necessary to readers unfamiliar with any of Kongtrul’s material is an introduction and a general textual analysis of each chapter, including a review of the information from the preced-ing book, Myriad Worlds, that is pertinent to the present volume. I have placed these at the back of the book, aft er the translation of Kongtrul’s work. Readers who approach Buddhist source texts gingerly can read these introductions before they read the translation; those who are bolder TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 37TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 376/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgebut left baffl ed concerning what they have just read will fi nd in them some walk-throughs which will perhaps prove helpful. To those who might rea-sonably expect the sort of deep and thoughtful reiteration of Kongtrul’s words we have come to expect from modern Buddhist scholarship, I must admit that I cannot pretend to be a scholar of Buddhism. I am just a lover of Buddhism, and it is from that perspective that I write. In unison with Kalu Rinpoché, I hope that this book will be generally acceptable to scholars and useful for practitioners and budding scholars.AcknowledgmentsMany minds, hearts, and hands contributed to earlier versions of the chapters in this book. Th e following translators, in no particular order, all spent signifi cant amounts of time and energ y kneading, soft ening, and coaxing meaning from the original Tibetan text: Ingrid McLeod, Elio Guarisco, Drubg yu Tenzin, Peter Alan Roberts, Yeshé Wangmo, Dechen Eva Cronin, Dominique Radas, Tara Mann, Barbara Hazelton, Samdrup, Norbu, Surya Das, Sylvie Carteron, Daniel Boschero, Olivier and Lydia Brunet, Roar Vestre, Kitty Rogers and her husband Yönten Gyatso, Mat-thieu Ricard, and Eric Péma Kunzang. All of us have been helped at one time or another by Khenpo Lodrö Dönyö’s boundless erudition and infectious good spirits. I fairly glow when I recall these deeply positive individuals and their selfl ess, conscientious eff orts. I have been conscious of my debt to them throughout my solitary work on this book, and I hope the results bring them a measure of contentment.Acharya Tenpa Gyaltsen, presently a teacher at Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, showed extraordinary patience and kindness in answering hundreds of questions over many hours and days, covering every subject in this book.Many years ago, Lama Gyaltsen Ratak, Kalu Rinpoché’s general sec-retary, served the translation committee and its members in every way possible. It was he who had to conjure up what money we needed when other sources ran dry. He never complained, and always proved his belief in us and our work by his tireless aid and availability. On a personal level, Faye Angevine and Howard Brewer of Taipei, and Kathleen Bryan and Richard Melton of Hawaii would years ago regularly welcome a destitute and oft en frail translator from India into their homes for indefi nite peri-ods of renewal. Few people have shown me such kindness as these couples TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 38TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 386/14/10 3:51:41 PM6/14/10 3:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"translator’s introduction \u0003 39consistently did; I certainly have never been so kind to anyone, although I aspire to follow their example someday.More recently, it is Tsadra Foundation to which I owe my deepest grat-itude for their support of all of us who work on Th e Treasury of Knowl-edge series. Lama Drubg yu Tenzin, cited above as a translator, has been a member of the committee since the very beginning, and spent many years in Bodhgaya and the Darjeeling hills laboring shoulder to shoulder with us. He has transformed himself into a lama-midwife, as his quiet, able, knowing, and reassuring presence has accompanied the births of all of the books in this series. All of us translators, myself very much included, deeply love him and keenly appreciate his always discreet contributions to our success.Th e person most responsible for helping this book reach comple-tion is the head of Tsadra Foundation, Eric Colombel, who never asks for more recognition than a couple of impersonal lines acknowledging Tsadra’s sponsorship aft er a book’s title page. In this case, that short for-mula does not do justice to his contribution. He has lavished upon me the same steadfast support and patience he has shown every translator of Th e Treasury of Knowledge series, and then more. In my case, Th e Treasury of Knowledge has managed to be a kind of karmic lightning rod, attracting with its blessings every conceivable cloud, upheaval, trial, and challenge, some small, some very imposing. Th is has been for me a totally unique experience in my life as a translator. Since deciding to sponsor our work, Eric has been with me every diffi cult step of the way, for the duration. No one is as responsible as he for seeing me through and ensuring that this book came to term. Th ank you, Eric, you have been a hero.Once our book babies are born, we gladly hand them off to the loving hands and eyes of a crew of vital bodhisattvas known collectively as Snow Lion Publications—Sidney Piburn, Jeff rey Cox, Susan Kyser, and Steven Rhodes, to name a few of that precious sangha. We the translators and you the reader are in the best of hands.Finally, from the beginning to the end, and beyond these ephemeral circumstances, beyond whatever this book and project have become, Kalu Rinpoché and Bokar Rinpoché live forever less than a breath or a heartbeat away.

During that time, enlightened beings’ compassion, aspirations, and activity will be inex-haustible. Th erefore, in the ten directions’ measureless world-systems, those celebrated with the titles of “victor,” “leader who guides the way,” and “supreme human being,” such as Transcendent Buddha Moon of Human-ity and Transcendent Buddha Jewel Heart, have appeared in the past in inexpressible numbers. At present, incalculable buddhas live and impart the teachings, such as Buddha Unshakable in the world-system Truly Joyous, Buddha Infi nite Light in the world-system Blissful, and Buddha Splendid Excellence in the world-system Lotus Splendor. In the future, indeterminable numbers of inconceivable guides, lions of humanity, will appear in succession, such as wondrous Transcendent Buddha All-Seeing Lord in the world-system called Perfect Collection Without Particles.Ages during which buddhas appear are called ages of illumination. Ages when none appear are called dark ages. Dark ages are very numer-ous; ages of illumination are rare. Aft er this present Fortunate Age has passed, sixty-fi ve great ages of darkness will elapse until an illuminated age called Great Fame, during which ten thousand buddhas will appear. Eighty thousand dark ages will ensue, aft er which eighty thousand bud-dhas will appear during an illuminated age called Star-like. Th en, aft er three hundred dark ages have elapsed, eighty-four thousand buddhas will appear in an illuminated age called Array of Qualities. Th ese details are presented in Th e Fortunate Age Discourse and serve here to illustrate this point.Some believe that among the infi nite [buddhas] mentioned within the scriptures of the Buddha’s word, an undetermined number of so-called buddhas of the interval will appear during our specifi c Fortunate Age, which was heralded by the [gods’] sight of one thousand lotuses. Never-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 44TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 446/14/10 3:51:42 PM6/14/10 3:51:42 PM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"our teacher’s path to awakening \u0003 45theless, the fi xed number of one thousand buddhas to appear is prevalent within the great and lesser ways in common. Further, in the past dur-ing the period when these thousand buddhas engaged in bodhisattvas’ conduct, they together formulated aspirations to reach awakening [as recounted later in this chapter].Followers of the lesser way believe that buddhas appear as the human life span in this world declines from eighty thousand to one hundred years. Buddhas do not appear earlier because sentient beings, having few sorrows, do not strive in their spiritual lives. Th ey do not appear aft er the life span is less than one hundred years since the world’s degeneration is by then far too advanced. When the life span again increases, buddhas need not appear because beings naturally spurn nonvirtuous acts and the strength of virtuous acts increases.During this present age, when the human life span was forty thou-sand years, the fi rst of the thousand buddhas appeared—Destroyer of the Wheel of Life; when thirty thousand years, Golden Sage; when twenty thousand [years], Guardian of the Light; and when one hundred [years], Shakyamuni. [When the life span again reaches] eighty thousand years, Loving-Kindness will appear. Regarding such buddhas, Th e Fortunate Age Discourse describes thirteen features in detail: each buddha’s home region, caste, measure of physical radiance, father, mother, children, attendants, foremost disciple in terms of knowledge, foremost disciple in miracles, [number of ] disciples, life span, doctrine’s duration, and rel-ics. Further, it is said that a guide of this world known as Transcendent Buddha Devotion (or as Transcendent Buddha Illuminator) will appear as the last of the [thousand] buddhas and will embody the totality of all of their life spans and activities.Among this age’s thousand buddhas is one who has the courage, unri-valed by any other, to accept disciples in this age of confl ict abandoned by all other buddhas. Th e victors and their spiritual heirs praised him, proclaiming , “How marvelous! Th is bodhisattva is like a white lotus.” Th is lauded our own teacher, the incomparable King of the Shakyas.A Concise Presentation of the Story of the Buddha’s Liberation [II]Initially, he developed the aspiration to awaken; subsequently, he performed bodhisattvas’ conduct.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 45TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 456/14/10 3:51:42 PM6/14/10 3:51:42 PM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeFinally, [he demonstrated] manifest enlightenment and aided beings.Here is a concise presentation or synopsis of the story of the Buddha’s liberation:Ultimately, our compassionate teacher has been manifestly awakened since time immemorial. He appeared throughout past, present, and future as various buddhas and bodhisattvas, acting for the welfare of beings. For the benefi t of disciples in the age of confl ict, he initially developed the supreme aspiration to attain awakening. Subsequently, he performed bodhisattvas’ conduct during three incalculable ages and other periods of time. Finally, he demonstrated manifest, complete enlight-enment at Vajra Seat in Magadha, then unceasingly aided beings by performing the four great miracles to guide them.How the Buddha Initially Developed the Aspiration to Attain Awakening [III]Th is section has two parts: (1) how the Buddha initially developed the aspiration to attain awakening according to the lesser way’s tradition and (2) how the Buddha initially developed the aspiration to attain awaken-ing according to the great way’s tradition.How the Buddha Initially Developed the Aspiration to Attain Awakening according to the Lesser Way’s Tradition [A]According to the lesser way,King Luminous fi rst developed the supreme aspiration to awaken for three reasons.Later, [our teacher] developed the mind of awakening upon seeing the great buddhas Shakyamuni and God of the Pure.[Th is marked] the beginning of the fi rst incalculable age of his spiritual path.How did our teacher develop the aspiration to awaken?

[Th is viewpoint is substantiated] by the following dialogue [recorded in] Th e Scripture on Monastic Discipline:Ananda asked such questions as,Principal guide of the world,Most fortunate one,Tell me how you, the sage,First developed the aspiration to awaken.To this, [the Buddha] replied,I heard that the buddhas are free from attachment,Witnessed the elephant’s overpowering arrogance,And saw the world’s suff ering ,Th en gave rise to the mind of awakening.In a later life, when our teacher was a potter named Vast Light in the city of Vaishali, a transcendent conqueror called Shakyamuni appeared in this world. Anointing [that buddha’s] body with butter and sesame oil, and presenting sweet drinks and other off erings, he developed the mind of awakening and formulated this aspiration:May my perfect off erings ensure my rebirth in the Shakya clanTo become a buddha with qualities, class, and family lineage equal to yours.May I fearlessly liberate those bound by misery in this world, up to Heaven of the Pure,In vast transcendent peace.Dasabala Shrimitra in his treatise Certainty about the Conditioned and the Unconditioned presents the elders’ viewpoint:Th e Transcendent Conqueror was a wheel-monarch, lord of humanity, by the name of Exceptional God. Since time im-memorial within the wheel of life, he had not seen [a buddha].

Th e White Lotus of Compassion Discourse states:Long ago, incalculable ages ago—as many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges—a great age called Holder occurred in this buddha realm. During that great age in this four-conti-nent buddha realm, there lived a four-continent wheel-mon-arch called Spoke’s Rim. His principal priest, a brahmin called Ocean Particles, had a son called Ocean Heart who, having realized manifest enlightenment, was called Buddha Jewel Heart. King Spoke’s Rim, together with his thousand sons, off ered him unequaled wealth. Aft erward, the great Brahmin Ocean Particles made similar off erings.Later on another occasion, Brahmin Ocean Particles placed all humans of the Land of Jambu [our continent] within the fi ve basic precepts and the mind of awakening, and induced King Spoke’s Rim, together with his thousand sons, includ-ing Open Eyes, to develop the mind of true awakening.

Likewise, he foretold the enlight-enment of all one thousand sons: To the eldest, Open Eyes, he gave the name All-Seeing One and foretold his enlightenment as King Radiant Noble Manifold Glory at dawn following the evening when Boundless Life transcends sorrow. He foretold the enlightenment of the second son, Attainment of Great Strength, as King Perfectly Stable Cluster of Jewels and that of the third son, Glorious Gentle Accumulation of Power, as All Seeing ; and he foretold that the ninth prince, Sinless, being imperturbable, would attain enlightenment in the pure land Truly Joyful as Buddha Unshakable, and so on.He then foretold the enlightenment of trillions of living be-ings, including the kingdom’s governors and Ocean Particles’ children and disciples.

At that time, a companion of mine was weak and could not pull the chariot. Avang prodded him with an iron trident and struck him with an iron hammer, causing a torrent of blood. Upon seeing this, unbearable com-passion arose within me, which inspired me to develop the mind of awakening. I begged Avang, ‘Be a little kind!’ Th at infuriated him; he pierced the nape of my neck with the iron trident, killing me. I was purifi ed of eight ages of negative acts and freed from the hell realm.”Th e Th ree Practices Discourse states:Just as the Conqueror, Transcendent Buddha Shakyamuni, when the merchant’s son called Truly Joyous, fi rst developed the mind of awakening by relying on the Conqueror Transcen-dent Buddha Great Beauty, likewise . . .Th e Vast Enjoyment Discourse states:At fi rst you off ered a sala fl ower to Buddha Sight of the Meaningful.When the future Buddha met Transcendent Buddha Sight of the Mean-ingful, his initial development of the aspiration to awaken is said to have been in that buddha’s presence.Th us, the lesser and great ways diff er in regard to our teacher’s ini-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 50TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 506/14/10 3:51:42 PM6/14/10 3:51:42 PM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"our teacher’s path to awakening \u0003 51tial development of the mind of awakening, and even within the great way, the discourses present many diff erent accounts.

Following that, when the stage of devoted conduct is perfectly complete, two [more] incalculable ages will have passed. Aft er that, each stage of awakening, from its fi rst stage, Great Joy, up to its tenth stage, Cloud of Dharma, requires three incalculable ages to complete. Finally, the stage of enlightenment, Ever Excellent, is achieved. Th us, enlightenment is attained aft er thirty-three incalculable ages, so it is said.Th e Rare and Sublime Cloud Discourse states:Th e state of a transcendent buddha is fully accomplished aft er many incalculable ages. Child of my spiritual family, you can-not measure, conceive of, or evaluate a transcendent buddha!Among these and many other viewpoints, some diff er with regard to sys-tems of calculation. Th e Stages of Awakening presents two frameworks. One attributes “incalculable” to the incalculable years, months, days, moments of time, etc., of each great age; the other, to the great ages them-selves that are beyond calculation. Th e exalted elders’ order believes that a number with fi ft y-fi ve digits is a “small incalculable number.” Counting this as a single unit, and multiplying it to the fi ft y-fi ft h power is a “large incalculable number.” Many scholars, including Abhayakaragupta, teach in accord with Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena’s main text and com-mentary that “incalculable” refers to a sixty digit number. Further, Th e Vast Enjoyment Discourse, Th e Flower Ornament Discourse, and other texts present very extensive frameworks for numbers that are the experiential domain [only] of exalted beings. Such a variety of systems of enumeration were taught in relation to specifi c considerations.Moreover, the incalculable ages’ starting point is designated on the basis of various underlying intentions and is said to be calculated from [the Buddha’s] initial aspiration to awaken.

Th ere are some who become indolent and do not enter [the path of ] supreme awakening [when considering ] such [a long period]; thus, to make them enter it, the period is said to be short. Further, the time can be unspecifi ed, to demonstrate that ulti-mately, numbers and enumeration lack an intrinsic nature, and to present the inconceivable ultimate nature, such as that time’s multiplicity does not contradict its unity and that time’s multiplicity converges into one. [Th ese presentations] are suitable due to many purposes; do not consider them contradictory.Th e Actual Way the Buddha Engaged in a Bodhisattva’s Conduct [2]Th e most prevalent [view is that the period] from the path of accumulation to awakening’s fi rst stage required one incalculable age.During the second incalculable age, he traversed six stages;During the third incalculable age, he traversed from Unwavering to the eleventh.Collectively, these represent the stages of ordinary individuals and [exalted beings’] path of training; he thereby completed the twofold accumulation.Among these many kinds of accounts, both extensive and brief, of incal-culable ages and how [our teacher] engaged in a bodhisattva’s conduct, the most prevalent is as follows:From the time our teacher venerated Buddha Great Embodiment during his lifetime as Prince Youthful Diligent Action, he cultivated the accumulations for one incalculable age, traversing the path of accumula-tion to awakening’s fi rst stage.

Th ey arise as celestial palaces of light, and principal deities and retinues, spontaneously present as the fi ve wisdoms’ aspects, death-less and changeless throughout all time. Each assembly of the fi ve wis-dom families’ sacred circles self-manifests throughout the infi nity of the expanse of space.[Th ird,] “Unsurpassed Realm, the natural realm of enlightenment’s manifest body” appears as the fi ve wisdom families’ realms (Unsurpassed Realm’s multi-storied palace in the center, etc.), for the benefi t of dis-ciples who have attained stages of awakening. What is widely known as “Unsurpassed Realm of the pure domains,” the supreme place perceiv-able by beings of world-systems such as Endurance, appears for the ben-efi t of both [exalted and ordinary beings]. In each world, Unsurpassed Realm lies within the form realm, the pure domains of the fi ve levels of gods immersed in the fourth degree of concentration. Th is Unsurpassed Realm has no coarse substance: it is a place made of pure light; various specifi c features, such as a celestial palace, adorn it.Th ese three are the three bodies of enlightenment’s realms: the former two (true ultimate Unsurpassed and Richly Adorned Supreme Unsur-passed Realm) are realms of the body of ultimate enlightenment and the body of enlightenment’s perfect rapture, while the latter two (the natural realm of enlightenment’s manifest body, and the pure domains’ Unsur-passed Realm) are the manifest body’s realms.In addition, many explanations exist, based on distinctions of Unsurpassed Realm being actual or nominal, etc.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 72TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 726/14/10 3:51:43 PM6/14/10 3:51:43 PM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the buddha’s enlightenment \u0003 73In addition to these, Tibetan scholars have produced a proliferation of explanations, refutations, and assertions concerning Unsurpassed Realm, such as distinctions between the actual and the nominal [Unsurpassed Realm]. I will not present these explanations here, yet all-knowing Tara-nata captures their essence in his threefold categorization of Richly Adorned Unsurpassed Realm based on a distinction between the actual and nominal [realms]: the Unsurpassed Realm similar [to the actual realm], which appears to bodhisattvas at awakening’s eighth and ninth stages; the slightly obscured realm, which appears to bodhisattvas at the tenth stage; and the very pure realm, which appears only to buddhas. It is also appropriate to affi x the terms nominal, ordinary, and special to these three. Th ese constitute Unsurpassed Realm as a realm of enlightenment’s perfect rapture.Th e realm referred to in Th e Journey to Lanka Discourse as situated in the form realm is the great powerful gods’ heaven but is not the Unsur-passed Realm of the pure domains. Th e description of the process of enlightenment in that place [above, under the heading “Perspectives of the Great Way’s Followers”] does not refer to the process of the body of perfect rapture’s enlightenment, but to the supreme manifest body’s dem-onstration of that process. Such a manifest body appears to bodhisattvas and it thus serves as the basic source [of further emanations], whereas demonstrations of the twelve deeds throughout the threefold thou-sand world-system constitute its secondary emanations. Moreover, such an Unsurpassed Realm [where the source manifest body demonstrates enlightenment] created by the collective virtuous actions of bodhisattvas who are mainly engaged in intentional conduct and exalted bodhisattvas on awakening’s impure stages has a defi nite size. It is taught that Buddha Illuminator newly created it; thus, it is not the realm Richly Adorned, which is like the pure realm Blissful. Th e Wheel of Time Ta n t r a states:A transcendent conqueror who resides in the pure domains and other heavens does so for the pious attendants’ sake.Th e “pure domains” mentioned here are identical with that [Unsurpassed Realm] just described. When discourses state that [Unsurpassed Realm as the place of enlightenment] is not situated among the pure domains, their underlying intent is to identify that realm as not among the fi ve pure domains taught in the pious attendants’ collected teachings.

It is not contradictory to refer to it both as exalted bodhisattvas’ exclusive experiential domain and as existing for the pious attendants’ sake, since [Unsurpassed Realm] pro-vides the basis for the emanation of the supreme manifest bodies who turn the teachings’ wheel for ordinary disciples, including the pious attendants.In general, pure realms that are realms of enlightenment’s manifest body (a special feature of the great way) have two kinds—sublime pure realms and lesser pure realms. Realms such as Blissful which are created mainly by exalted bodhisattvas’ roots of virtue constitute independent pure realms and do not belong to the wheel of life’s three realms.

In that site for the teachings, he presented one hundred and eight approaches to illuminate the Dharma, including “faith, the illuminating approach to the teachings that produces unwavering resolve.”He then placed a turban and crown on the head of Bodhisattva Lov-ing-Kindness (Maitreya), and foretold: “Aft er me, you shall gain manifest and complete enlightenment,” thereby empowering Loving-Kindness as his regent, presenter of the teachings in Joyful.

His father was of the royal caste.[Th e future Buddha saw] the Land of Jambu, an especially exalted land compared to the other three continents [of this world-system] inhabited by human beings.He saw that during the period human life span increases to eighty thousand years, the wealth of enjoyments is so abundant that disillu-sionment with life is diffi cult. When [the maximum possible] life span decreases under a hundred years, the fi ve degenerations’ extreme spread makes human life one without leisure. A period free from those draw-backs, during which it would be easy to guide many beings, is the time that the human life span is one hundred years.He saw that the region holding a central position [India] would not become as debased [as others] with faults that arise in other countries due to the era of confl ict.He saw that in this world the royal caste is sometimes the most hon-ored [among castes]; at other times, it is the brahmin caste.

During the fi ft h week, he dwelt at the residence of the naga Mucilinda. During the sixth week, he moved from there to the foot of a banyan tree. During the seventh week, the Buddha sat at the foot of the tree of liberation.At this time, Trapusha and Bhallika, two merchants encouraged by the gods, off ered him the fi rst alms.

Th e tidings, “Th e Transcendent Buddha will turn the wheel of Dharma!” resounded as far as Brahma’s realm.Th e Buddha then went to seek alms in Varanasi. When he arrived at Deer Park, Descent of the Sages, the fi ve excellent ones came to greet him. Th e Buddha called them forth, and they thereby became true fully ordained monks.At that place, one thousand magnifi cent lion-supported thrones appeared. Th e Buddha circumambulated the fi rst three; when he sat in cross-legged posture on the fourth, a great light spread throughout worlds in the ten directions, and a sound arose calling beings to listen to his teachings. A god called Bodhisattva Who Turned the Wheel of the Teachings upon Developing the Intention to Attain Awakening pre-sented him with a one thousand-spoked wheel made of gold from the Jambu River. He and countless other bodhisattvas and gods assembled.On the fourth day of the sixth lunar month, the Buddha taught the four truths in three enunciations: [he fi rst explained] their essence, then their function, and fi nally their result. In this way, he presented that cycle of teaching in twelve aspects. As a result, the fi ve excellent ones attained [the state of ] arhat (foe-subduer), and for the fi rst time the three jewels (Buddha, Teaching, and Spiritual Community) appeared in this world.Beginning with instruction in the expedient and defi nitive meanings [of Dharma], the Buddha turned the great wheel of Dharma—virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end—in three stages. He taught in known locations—Gaya Peak, Gandhamadana Mountain, Rajgir, Vulture Peak, Shravasti, Jetavana, Kosala, Kapilavastu, and the city of Vaishali—as well as in many places unknown [to humans], such as realms of gods and nagas, and the precious vajra palace.Th e Buddha led innumerable disciples of the four kinds, including the sublime pair, to the attainment of four results. He foretold the awaken-ing of countless humans and gods who had affi nity with the great way. In Shravasti, he displayed supreme miracles, both mundane and supra-mundane. For his mother Mayadévi’s sake, he spent one summer retreat period in Heaven of the Th irty-three, then descended from the gods’ realm [back to earth] at Sankashya.

In these ways, his display of the four taming miracles was incon-ceivable and indescribable.In summary, the Buddha stayed in his father’s royal residence until the age of twenty-nine. He practiced austerities during six years, and at the age of thirty-fi ve he attained enlightenment. From then until his eighti-eth year, he conducted forty-fi ve summer retreats and set in motion the highest wheel of the teachings.Th e Twelft h Deed [L]He demonstrated unlimited transcendence of sorrow.His relics spread throughout the world.When the Buddha had completed these deeds, the composite factors [that sustained] his life span were spent. [At the request of some disciples,] he blessed the composite factors [that sustained] his life-force [and thereby extended his life]. Signifi cant portents appeared, and he proceeded to such places as the city of Vaishali together with his followers. Th ere, he counseled them to distinguish in the future between what is Dharma and what is not: what concurs with the [collection of ] discourses, appears in the collection on discipline, and does not contradict the nature of reality should be accepted as the teacher’s doctrine.[Th e Buddha] ate his last meal, off ered by the blacksmith’s son, Chunda. Th en, in Kushinagara, he reclined in the lion’s sleeping posture on his last bed, between a pair of sal trees. He then gave his attention to the percep-tion of illumination, to the perception of recollection and mindfulness, and to the perception of transcending sorrow. He gave instructions to Ananda concerning the three groups of four marvelous teachings, and oral counsel. He converted the king of the celestial musicians [called] Gaiety, a wandering mendicant Subhadra, and others. Furthermore, he gave specifi c instructions on how to continue the teacher’s acts, such as [for the community of ordained persons] to recite Th e Individual Libera-tion Discourse every fortnight.Th e Buddha then entered absorption within of each level of meditative concentration in ascending and reverse order, and [ascended] again to the farthest limit of the fourth level of concentration. Resting there, he attained unmoving tranquil vision, and within the unlimited basic space of phenomena, he demonstrated transcendence of sorrow.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 87TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 876/14/10 3:51:43 PM6/14/10 3:51:43 PM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"88 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeFor seven days, amidst vast off erings of gods and humans, his physi-cal remains were carried to [a stupa known as] Stupa Adorned with a Crown Off ered by the Mallas.

To illustrate this, in the pious attendant system, the major miracles are said to have occurred [on the same day], as explained in Vari-ous Scriptures on Monastic Discipline. However, according to proponents of the great way system, the Buddha performed miracles over fi ft een days, as related in Th e Discourse of the Wise and the Foolish. Diff erent explana-tions exist regarding how the Buddha turned the wheel of the teachings, on the length of the Buddha’s life, and other points. According to the common view, he lived eighty years, but scriptures of defi nitive meaning teach another perspective in detail:Th e Buddha does not transcend sorrow,Nor will the teachings disappear.Major diff erences in scope exist between the great and lesser ways. How-ever, since the pious attendant system records what all the Buddha’s com-mon disciples witnessed, it has become prevalent and accepted. When [the Buddha’s deeds] are presented, the two perspectives must be diff eren-tiated and unmixed; composite, blended versions should not be taught.How the twelve deeds are enumerated is stated by the noble Nagarjuna in Th e Precious Garland and in Ancient Praise (a text said to be by the same author), and in many books by Tibetan scholars. I have recounted here the deeds according to the praise in verse composed by the illustrious Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa, who derived his work from the text quoted above [Th e Highest Continuity] by the sovereign bodhisattva of awakening’s tenth stage, the regent Maitreya. Th e noble master all-knowing Taranata, in his work Meaning ful to Behold, states:Although the stories of the Transcendent Buddha’s liberation as they appear throughout the three collections are all equally [valid], we must distinguish between the great way and lesser way versions. Th e Vast Enjoyment Discourse, for instance, gives a detailed account of the events from the Buddha’s residence in Joyful Heaven until his fi rst turning of the wheel of the teach-ings. Since this is a great way discourse, if one wishes to con-tinue an account of the Buddha’s deeds, it would be best, in brief, to use as supplements sources that are exclusively great way discourses. Th ese include the account of the outstanding pair of the Buddha’s disciples from Th e Concise Long Mantra of Precious Top Ornament; the accounts that appear in Th e TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 89TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 896/14/10 3:51:44 PM6/14/10 3:51:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeReunion of Father and Son Discourse, from the collection Th e Noble Cluster of Jewels Discourse; the great miracles explained in Th e Discourse of the Wise and the Foolish; and the circum-stances of his transcendence of sorrow in Th e Great Discourse of Transcendence of Sorrow.Th e discourses from the collection on observed phenom-ena and in the collection on monastic discipline belong to the systems of the common Buddhist way—the collections of the pious attendants. Th erefore, if one is interested in furthering their accounts, it is best to supplement them only with sources found in diverse lesser way discourses. Th ese include Th e Dis-course of One Hundred Actions and Th e Hundred Histories. It is unacceptable to mix the two, making them neither one nor the other, which is incorrect.Here in Tibet, Th e Discourse of the Wise and the Foolish, Th e Great Discourse on Mindfulness, and others are considered to be part of the pious attendants’ collection, but in fact, they defi nitely belong to the great way collection. Th e presentation of the major miracles in Th e Discourse of the Wise and the Fool-ish is of the great way system: the pious attendant system states that there was [only] one day of miracles; the great way, fi ft een days. Th is illustrates many marked diff erences among all other points [that prove the provenance of these books].Th e system of the common Buddhist way (or pious atten-dant system) gives the account of the Buddha’s activity and deeds in the world as they appeared in common to all who were in the vicinity of the Buddha’s presence and were apt [witnesses]—including those holding wrong views, non-Bud-dhists, or even animals. Th e great way discourses relate how the deeds appeared in the experience of disciples for whom the extraordinary great way was taught. As a result, [the two sys-tems] have diff erent enumerations of the deeds in general, and in particular, very marked diff erences in scope. Th erefore, al-though these two systems are not fundamentally contradictory, their styles of teaching must not be mixed. For this reason, I do not see as very acceptable [the account of the Buddha’s twelve deeds by] a master known in Tibet as the second omniscient one, since he explained the fi rst eleven deeds according to Th e TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 90TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 906/14/10 3:51:44 PM6/14/10 3:51:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the buddha’s twelve deeds \u0003 91Vast Enjoyment Discourse and supplemented that record with the last deed according to Th e Minor Scripture on Discipline.

Nevertheless, only the common system [of the lesser way] provides a basis for various points of en-quiry, such as what existed in the common perception of all individuals [at that time], the Buddha’s life span, the chronol-og y [of the events of his life], and assertions that the Buddha traveled to one place and did not travel to another.Th e great way system cannot serve in that way.

To take examples from discourses,Some things [dharma] are composite, some non-composite.Further,TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 117TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1176/14/10 3:51:45 PM6/14/10 3:51:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeKnow all phenomena [dharma] to be like that.(2) Dharma denotes the spiritual path, as in the following :O monks, an erroneous view is not the spiritual path [dharma];A correct view is the path.(3) Dharma denotes transcendence of sorrow:Having taken refuge in the Dharma . . .(4) Dharma denotes the mental function’s domain:Th e sense bases’ domains [dharma] . . .(5) Dharma denotes merit:[Th e Buddha] enjoyed [the fruits of ] merit [dharma] together with his circle of queens and youthful maidens . . .(6) Dharma denotes life:Immature persons cherish the life [dharma] they see.(7) Dharma denotes scriptures:O monks, that which is called scripture [dharma] is the dis-courses, the melodious expressions, [and] . . .(8) Dharma denotes nature:Composite substances have this nature [dharma].Further,Not even I have transcended the nature [dharma] of death, and the reality of death.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 118TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1186/14/10 3:51:45 PM6/14/10 3:51:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"what are the sacred teachings? \u0003 119(9) Dharma denotes specifi ed conduct:Th e four regulations [dharmas] for a mendicant . . .Moreover,O monks, killing is not specifi ed conduct [dharma]; renuncia-tion of killing is specifi ed conduct.(10) Dharma denotes tradition, as in a country’s traditions [dharma] or a caste’s customs.What is the connection between these and the meaning of the [Tibetan] word ’dzin [pronounced “dzin”], “to hold”? One can infer the logic [of the connection in the following illustrations]:(1) Phenomena hold specifi c and general characteristics.

As an example of the canon his wisdom speech blessed, [the Buddha] ordered Manjushri to assuage Ajatashatru’s despair. Th is resulted in Th e Discourse to Assuage Ajatashatru’s Despair. As an example of the canon his wisdom mind blessed, the Transcendent Conqueror entered the meditative state of profound illumination and blessed Shariputra and All-Seeing One, who then spoke Th e Discourse of the Heart of the Perfection of Sublime Insight.Further, [the Buddha’s] spontaneously present qualities’ and activities’ blessings shone lights that illuminated transcendent buddhas’ bodies, who taught the Dharma, as presented in the introduction to Th e Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Th ousand Verses.

Since many meanings are included in each, [each collection] is like a large measure, just as a large measure contains many small measures.

Th ose teachings eliminate the extreme of engaging in begging for what is desired by prohibiting engagement in inadmissible conduct, such as hoarding motivated by craving. Th rough dispensations, the teachings reject the extreme of exhausting oneself; for instance, they permit an ordained per-son to possess expensive clothing when he or she has acquired it while fully engaged in pure ethical conduct without inadmissible acts, and he or she has gained defi nite freedom from attachment.

On what is meant by “Dharma and its meaning,” A Commentary on “ Th e Ornament of the Discourses” states:“Dharma” [in this case] refers to names, words, and letters. “Meaning” refers to the subjects they express: the psycho-physical aggregates, sense constituents, and sense bases. Or, “Dharma” can refer to the aggregates, sense constituents, and sense bases, etc.; “meaning,” to the four intentions and covert intentions in the Buddha’s speech. Or, “Dharma” can refer to the ten virtuous acts, causes that lead to the attainment of the higher realms; “meaning,” to such subjects as thirty-seven as-pects of awakening, causes that lead to the attainment of tran-scendent states.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 133TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1336/14/10 3:51:45 PM6/14/10 3:51:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeConsidering these [reasons], Th e Ornament of the Discourses states:Th e collections can also be considered as threefold or twofold because they are compilations.Th eir primary causes are believed to be ninefold.Alternatively, disciples are defi nitely of two kinds: individuals who have entered the great way and those who have entered the lesser way. Th erefore, [the collections] are also grouped into two: the bodhisattva collection and the pious attendant collection. In other words, the three collections just presented are each divided into two, diff erentiated according to what was spoken to those drawn to a lesser scope and what was spoken before those drawn to a wide-ranging scope. It is as Venerable Asanga states:Th ese three become two based upon the diff erence between the lesser and sublime ways—the pious attendant collection and the bodhisattva collection.Classifi cation of the Canon according to Modes of Expression [iii']In terms of content alone, the Victor’s canonIs divided into twelve branches of the Buddha’s excellent speech:Discourses, aphorisms in verse, prophetic declarations, verses,Purposeful declarations, accounts to provide a framework, narrative stories, legends,Accounts of former lives, extensive teachings, marvelous events, and defi nitions.In terms of content or mode of expression alone, it is reasonable to divide the Victor’s canon into twelve branches of the Buddha’s excellent speech.(1) Th e fi rst of these is the class of the discourses.

Specifi cally, these are dis-courses of defi nitive meaning since they reveal the Buddha’s intent.(4) Verses are what the Buddha spoke in verse, from two to six stanzas.(5) Purposeful declarations are what the Buddha appeared to speak out of his wisdom mind’s own initiative, rather than from others’ encouragement.(6) Accounts to provide a framework are what the Buddha spoke for the sake of an individual, or to relate a background story along with a proscribed point of training.(7) Narrative stories are what the Buddha spoke accompanied by illus-trative examples.

In Th e Meaning of the Scripture “Th e Discourse of the Defi nite Elucidation of the Wisdom Mind,” all-knowing Drimé Özer [i.e., Longchenpa] states:At the beginner’s level, the Buddha mainly taught an enumera-tion of the four truths—including the stages of renunciation, antidotes, and the acceptance and rejection [of conduct]—to protect the mind from the binding affl ictive emotions pro-duced by a dualistic autonomous mind stream. At the inter-mediate level, he taught the absence of defi ning characteristics to prevent manifest attachment to antidotes. Finally, he taught the way the fundamental nature abides—the ultimate and de-fi nitive enumeration of the teaching. Th us three enumerations arose.When the canon is divided based on [the disciples’] degrees of acumen, there are three ways—the pious attendants’ way, the solitary sages’ way, and the unsurpassable way.

Th erefore, treatises are called [from the Tibetan “ten-chö”] “refi nement of the doc-trine.” A Rational System of Exposition states:Texts that refi ne every affl ictive emotion—our enemies—And protect us from the miserable existences are treatises,Since they have these qualities of refi nement and protection.Th ese two qualities cannot be found in other systems.Alternatively, Th e Treasury of Immortality presents the term shastra as meaning “defi nitive teaching” or “textual tradition.” [One of Asanga’s] fi ve treatises on awakening’s stages states:Th ree [kinds of ] treatise are believed to be free from these six [faults]:Meaningless, [or] irrational, [versus] meaningful;Stressing study, [or] debate, [versus] emphasizing practice;Misleading, [or] cruel, [versus eff ective in] relieving suff ering.Th e six types of defi cient treatises [referred to here] are treatises that lack authentic meaning , such as the four Vedas; irrational treatises, such as those that assert that liberation can be accomplished based on such views as eternalism or nihilism; treatises stressing subjects of study, such as poetic composition; treatises stressing debate, such as polemical texts; misleading treatises, such as those concerned with victory in battle; and treatises devoid of loving-kindness that are harmful to the reader and others, such as those that assert that the sacrifi ce of cows or other animals constitutes a religious practice of off ering or generosity.Buddhists believe that three kinds of treatise, diff erent from these six defi cient types of treatise, should be accepted: treatises imbued with great meaning—the achievement of temporal happiness and ultimate freedom; treatises that [emphasize] the accomplishment of awakening ; and trea-tises that promote renunciation of every suff ering of the wheel of life.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 139TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1396/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeClassifi cations of Treatises [d']Th is section has three parts: (1) classifi cation of treatises according to function, (2) classifi cation of treatises according to topics, and (3) classi-fi cation of treatises according to subject.Classifi cation of Treatises according to Function [i']In terms of function, there are three kinds of treatise:Treatises that encompass the vast, reveal the profound, or rectify order.In terms of function, treatises are divided into three kinds: treatises that encompass a vast [wealth of information], treatises that reveal the subject of the profound, and treatises that rectify order.Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena is an example of the fi rst; Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization, of the second; and Th e Ornament of the Discourses, of the third.Classifi cation of Treatises according to Topics [ii']Among commentaries on the intent [of the canon’s] general or specifi c topics,Th e three wheels’ commentaries on the view and conduct are distinct.In terms of the canon’s topics, there are two kinds of treatises: commen-taries on the canon in general, and commentaries on the intent of specifi c [passages].Th e fi rst [category] includes treatises on grammar, such as Th e Kalapa Grammar and Chandra’s Grammar, and those on the study of logic, such as the seven treatises on logic.Th e second is divided into commentaries on the view and conduct of the three turnings of the wheel; thus, it has many distinct [categories]:Commentaries on the view aspect of the fi rst wheel include the seven texts on observed phenomena of pious attendants and Th e Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition; and Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena, which TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 140TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1406/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"what are the sacred teachings? \u0003 141summarizes their meaning.

Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:Th e wheel of Dharma is the path of seeing.It travels quickly, etc. . . .As stated, when a wheel-monarch’s precious wheel is set in motion, it travels swift ly to its intended destination, passing some places and enter-ing others. It defeats unconquered regions, such as cities or villages, and naturally establishes its dominion over them. It ascends to some places and descends to others. Likewise, the wheel of Dharma moves swift ly since truth is realized in fi ft een moments. It passes through the uninter-rupted path and makes manifest the path of liberation, thereby enter-ing it. Alternatively, the wheel of Dharma rejects focus on the reality [of things] and enters another [i.e., spiritual path]. Th rough [the power] of fi rm decisiveness, the uninterrupted path defeats unconquered affl ictive emotions, such as the view of perishable collections [as a self ]. Th e path of liberation is the attainment of separation from affl ictive emotions. Dominion over those emotions is naturally established at the same time.

Th e scriptures make these compre-hensible to others’ mind streams; thus, the phrase, “turning the wheel of Dharma.”Th e Characteristics of Scriptural Transmission [2]Th e essence of scriptural transmission is knowledge manifest in speech.Based upon the Victor’s wisdom and beings’ pure minds,Disciples’ understanding manifests as terms, words, and letters.Th e particularist and discourse schools assert that words and terms belong to two [diff erent] aggregates.Th e essence of the wheel of Dharma of scriptural transmission is any sacred teachings spoken by our teacher. Its main subject is the transcen-dence of sorrow’s cause, result, and essence; it is knowledge manifest in the form of speech.Th e basis for this defi nition is as follows: Th e dominant cause [for scriptural transmission] is the Buddha’s wisdom; its causal condition is the pure mind streams of beings who are his disciples. Based on the convergence of these two, those disciples’ understanding manifests in the form of terms, words, and letters.Since the Transcendent Conqueror did not fall under the sway of habitual patterns that motivate speech, and since he had no lack of aware-ness, [including ] inner cognition attached to external sound, ultimately, the Transcendent Buddha did not teach through the power of intentions. Th us, in consideration of this fact, some great way discourses relate that the Joyful Buddha did not teach even one word or syllable.Followers of the lesser way do not share that belief.

Th erefore, the teachings belong to [the aggregate of ] non-associated formative factors. Th e discourse school believes that the scriptures’ grammar has its own identifi able attributes; therefore, the teachings belong to the form aggregate. [Both schools believe that scrip-tural transmission] falls within these two limits of substance.Etymology of the Term “Wheel of Dharma” [B]Concerning the etymology of the term “wheel of Dharma,” chakra, the latter part of the term Dharmachakra,Denotes the movement of realization and the aggregate of scriptural transmission.In the Sanskrit term dharmachakra, the meaning of dharma has been explained above [in the previous chapter]. Th e term chakra denotes move-ment or a collection. Th e term chakra (wheel) is used because the wheel of the Dharma of realization seems to move to disciples’ mind streams, and because the cycle of scriptural transmission is the epitome of many aggregates of Dharma. Dharmamitra states:Th e term “wheel” is used because [realization] appears to move into disciples’ mind streams or because it has the meaning of a collection, since the meaning of the word “wheel” is close to those [intended meanings].Also, in other synonyms for it, reference is made to “Brahma’s wheel,” as Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:It [the wheel of Dharma] itself [is Brahma’s wheel], since in purity, Brahma’s [literally: the Pure’s] wheel is turned by Brahma.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 150TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1506/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"cycles of scriptural transmission \u0003 151Categories of the Wheel of Dharma [C]Th is section has two parts: (1) the common wheel of Dharma and (2) the extraordinary wheel of Dharma according to the secret mantra way.Th e Common Wheel of Dharma [1]Th is section has two parts: (1) the wheel of Dharma classifi ed as three cycles of teaching and (2) the wheel of Dharma described in terms of aggregates.Th e Wheel of Dharma Classifi ed as Th ree Cycles of Teaching [a]Th is section has two parts: (1) the general classifi cation of three cycles of teaching and (2) separate frameworks of the three cycles of teaching.Th e General Classifi cation of Th ree Cycles of Teaching [i]When scriptural transmission is classifi ed, the fi rst doctrine comprises the four truths;Th e intermediate doctrine, absence of characteristics; the fi nal doctrine, accurate discernment.[Th e Buddha] spoke of renunciation, freedom, and irreversibilityTo have beings enter peace, reach spiritual maturity, and fulfi ll prophecies;And to have them turn away from what is not meritorious, from the self, and from [the basis of] all views.When scriptural transmissions are classifi ed, the wheel of Dharma has three cycles; this is widely known and accepted among followers of the great way.Th e fi rst doctrine the Buddha taught is the scriptural transmission of the four truths; the middle one, the scriptural transmission concerning absence of characteristics; and the fi nal one, the scriptural transmission of accurate discernment.

Th e fi rst is speech [that inspired] renunciation toward the wheel of life; the second, speech that presented the three gateways to freedom; and the third, speech that described the irreversible wheel. Th e reason for this order is that these stages connect disciples to supreme awakening. Th e Highest Continuity states:Th e form [bodies] constitute the cause which makes the worldly enter the path of peace,Brings them to spiritual maturity, and gives prophecies.As stated, the Buddha’s initial talks of disillusionment given to those attached to the wheel of life compelled them to enter the path of peace.

He mainly taught this cycle to disciples with an affi nity for the lesser way. Th e scriptures known to pious atten-dants as [collections] on discipline, on observed phenomena, and of the discourses, such as the four classes of discourses, exemplify this cycle.Why is it referred to as the doctrinal cycle of “the four truths”? Th is term is used because, to guide disciples inclined to the lesser way, [the Buddha] taught the correct view and conduct starting from the princi-pal subject of this cycle, the four truths. Th e main teachings of the fi rst wheel took place in the region of Varanasi, at Deer Park, Descent of the Seers. To a circle of disciples, the excellent group of fi ve, [the Buddha] fi rst enunciated the four truths three times. Th us, he taught this turning of the wheel in a twelve-part format.On the subject of that format, the particularist school considers that presentations of the four truths’ essence, function, and result constitute the three enunciations. Moreover, each repetition had four aspects—words, knowledge, understanding, and realization. Th us, the teaching was carried out in twelve parts.Th e discourse school maintains that the fi rst repetition focused upon the essence of the four truths themselves; the second focused upon the essence of their functions; and the third focused upon their ultimate [result]. What was repeated was the system of the four truths; in the course of three repetitions, the focus was upon three features (essence, function, and result) of each of the four truths. Th us, this school states TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 153TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1536/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethat the teaching had twelve parts. Th is belief seems reasonable to me.Th is doctrinal cycle’s actual purpose included to bring the excellent group of fi ve to the attainment of the state of arhat. Its special purpose is that, from that time until the end of the doctrine of fruition, those who attain the four results [of the lesser way’s path] will be as numerous as the earth’s dust motes.Other teachings besides the ones mentioned here belong to the four truths’ doctrinal cycle. For example, the Buddha spoke fragments of the scriptural transmission on discipline in six cities and in other locations. [In the same way, this doctrinal cycle was enunciated] in various unspeci-fi ed times and places.Th e Middle Cycle of Teaching [bb]To teach the absence of characteristics, the explicit teaching presented the three gateways to freedom;Th e hidden meaning explained the eight manifest realizations and related topics.Th e middle wheel of Dharma can be characterized as sacred teachings the Buddha spoke with the intention to establish the great way’s actual path. He mainly taught them to disciples with an affi nity for the great way. Th e discourses on the perfection of sublime insight, including the text referred to as the mother [of all buddhas] in its extensive, medium, and brief versions, chiefl y exemplify this cycle.Why is this cycle referred to as the doctrinal cycle of “the absence of characteristics”? All phenomena, from form up to and including omni-science, dwell far removed from substantial characteristics. Th ese teach-ings were apparently given to show this indescribable, inconceivable, and inexpressible ultimate nature; thus this term is used.At the site of Vulture Peak at Rajgir, [the Buddha] taught a circle of disciples belonging to the four assemblies [of laywomen, laymen, nuns, and monks] and an infi nite gathering of bodhisattvas. He began with an explicit teaching , the three gateways to freedom; then, by presenting the profound subject of emptiness, he explained the hidden meaning, the stages through which the eight manifest realizations arise in disciples’ mind streams, and he included seventy related topics. He employed three TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 154TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1546/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"cycles of scriptural transmission \u0003 155styles and eleven systems [listed here below] that serve as eff ective means to achieve realization.Th e three gateways to freedom are as follows: the basis is emptiness; the path, absence of characteristics; and the result, aspirationlessness.

Based on these purposes, they entered the transcendent buddhas’ domain. Indirectly, this cycle removes all sentient beings’ obscuring veils of wrong views, leading to the manifest and irreversible realization of all phenomena’s abiding nature, and the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 155TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1556/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeattainment of the supreme transcendence of sorrow which does not fall into the two extremes.Th e Final Cycle of Teaching [cc]Th e fi nal cycle principally teaches the three characteristics [of knowable things].Th e fi nal wheel of Dharma can be characterized as sacred teachings the Buddha spoke with the intention of teaching the ultimate meaning. He mainly taught bodhisattvas at levels of no regression. Scriptures that prin-cipally teach accounts of buddha-nature, such as Th e Flower Ornament Discourse and Th e Journey to Lanka Discourse, exemplify this cycle.Why are they referred to as “the doctrinal cycle of accurate analysis”? Th is expression is used since the Buddha mainly began with an accurate analysis of all phenomena, from form up to and including omniscience, according to three characteristics [of knowable things]: imagined, depen-dent, and consummate.Th e fi nal doctrinal cycle’s main part is ultimately immeasurable, yet merely in the visual and aural domain of spiritually immature persons like ourselves, the Buddha spoke at indefi nite times at Mount Malaya, Heart of Awakening, Vaishali, and other places. Th erefore, a single delin-eation—“Th is, and this alone, constitutes the [fi nal cycle of teaching ]”—is diffi cult to make. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned texts and others, such as A Cluster of Jewels, that have extensive [elucidations] of both the words and meanings [of the subjects of this cycle] should be placed within this cycle. Many words spoken with an underlying intention in the majority of lesser and great way discourses are largely clarifi ed in these [discourses of the fi nal cycle of instruction]. For example, Th e Basic Dis-course on Monastic Discipline states:Monks are permitted to eat suitable meat. Th is meat that is pure in three ways—[the meat has] not been designated [for the monk], nor begged for, nor ordered—will not occur; thus do not eat meat.In this and other examples, the Buddha gave many instructions with an underlying intention.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 156TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1566/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"cycles of scriptural transmission \u0003 157Th e Wheel of Dharma Described in Terms of Aggregates [b]All scriptural transmissions are referred to as “aggregates of Dharma,”Of which there are eighty-four thousand.All scriptural transmissions are generally referred to as “aggregates of Dharma” because their various subjects’ meanings and their content’s words appear as a heaped mound. Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena states that there are eighty thousand aggregates of Dharma; a commen-tary to Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena states that some schools believe that there are eighty-four thousand. Followers of the great way have made this latter belief prevalent. Omniscient Drimé Özer [Long-chenpa] states:Classifi ed according to the number of antidotes [to the affl ic-tive emotions], there are eighty-four thousand aggregates of Dharma. Th e Radiant Lamp states:Among the eighty-four thousand aggregates of DharmaTh e great Sage spoke, . . .Pious attendants determine an aggregate in three ways.Th ere are many beliefs concerning the ways of measuring a single aggre-gate of Dharma. Th e pious attendants have three main beliefs: Some [pious attendant] schools claim that since the main text of Aggregates of Dharma by Shariputra (one of the seven texts on observed phenomena, which the particularist school believes to belong in the canon; the dis-course school, among the treatises) is six thousand verses long, that rep-resents the measure of one aggregate of Dharma. Th ey say that among the eighty thousand [aggregates], just this remains; the rest has disappeared.Some schools believe that a complete discussion of the topic of each enumeration (such as the psycho-physical aggregates, sense constituents, sense bases, or interdependency) is a measure of an aggregate of Dharma, and they classify them accordingly.Moreover, some schools believe that various sub-classifi cations and combinations of the affl ictive emotions (desire, anger, stupidity, pride, TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 157TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 1576/14/10 3:51:46 PM6/14/10 3:51:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgewrong view, and doubt) total eighty thousand. As an antidote to each of them, an aggregate of Dharma was taught. Th ey believe that the mea-sure [of an aggregate of Dharma] is the words that completely present the application of each antidote.Others consider that the measure is equal to [a load] on the back of the elephant Steadfast.According to followers of the great way (including Nagabodhi), one aggregate of Dharma denotes the number of words or terms of Dharma, written without any borders or embellishments with a pen (the tip of which is as fi ne as a fraction of a hair’s tip) on white birch bark or palmyra paper as thin and light as the garment of the gods, that can be loaded onto the back of a full-grown elephant. Clear Words states:Th e perspective of the unsurpassable way is that one aggregate of Dharma is however much can be written with the amount of ink that can be carried by Indra’s elephant, Steadfast. Th at being the case, some discourses quote exalted Dévadatta as stating that this would equal the number of volumes of scrip-tures, suitable for chanting, that fi ve thousand elephants could carry.

Stricken with grief, Ananda left the sublime assembly and entered a monsoon-season-style retreat in Vriji province. When he taught the doctrine to the four circles of fol-lowers, including a Vriji man, the Vriji man attained the state of arhat. With clairvoyance, [this arhat] gazed at his preceptor’s mind; seeing that Ananda was still training to become free from attachment, [he exhorted him with] these words:Gautama! Don’t be careless!Sit in the shade at the foot of a tree, and place your mindIn the transcendence of sorrow!

From an uncommon perspective, many state-ments appear, such as that the doctrine’s duration is limitless. Neverthe-less, the opinion most prevalent among this country’s researchers, and accepted as reasonable by them, is that [the doctrine] will endure for ten fi ve-hundred-year periods—fi ve thousand years.

Th en, in the midst of three Kukkutapada mountains in the south, eminent Kashyapa covered his body with the Buddha’s discarded robes, blessed his physical remains so that they would not decay before the advent of Bud-dha Loving-Kindness, and transcended sorrow. Gods and other beings worshipped his physical remains, then joined the three mountains into one, enveloping his body.Ananda ordained Shanavasa, son of a trader, and entrusted the doc-trine to him. Ananda emanated an island in the middle of the Ganges River, where fi ve hundred seers took full ordination and became arhats. Th ey became known as mid-stream arhats or mid-day arhats [the time of TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 200TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2006/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"buddhism in the land of exalted beings \u0003 201their ordination]. Ananda advised Shanavasa, chief among them, to pre-serve the doctrine in general, and specifi cally to propagate it in Kashmir. Ananda then transcended sorrow in basic space without residue. Shanavasa journeyed to Kashmir, where he subdued the violent naga Audushta and his entourage, and claimed the land [which had been covered by a lake]. Shanavasa obtained saff ron seeds from Mount Gandhamadana and planted them in Kashmir, consecrating them so that saff ron would grow there as long as the doctrine of the Buddha lasted. It is said that Shanavasa’s teaching led ten thousand persons to the state of arhat and one hundred thousand to the perception of the truth. He ordained Upagupta (son of Gupta, an incense merchant) and entrusted the doctrine to him. Th e teacher himself had predicted Upagupta’s life when he said,A century aft er my transcendence of sorrow, an enlightened being without the characteristic features [of a buddha] will perform a buddha’s acts.Using miraculous powers, exalted Upagupta subdued evil demons. He gave profound instructions for meditation in a cave eighteen cubits deep, twelve cubits wide, and six cubits high. Each [of his disciples] who attained the state of arhat cast into the cave a stick four fi nger-widths in length. When the cave was fi lled, Upagupta ordained Dhitika, son of an Ujjaini city Brahmin, and entrusted the doctrine to him.Dhitika fully illuminated the teacher’s doctrine by such acts as using miraculous powers to convert many people from the royal and brah-min castes who had entered erroneous paths. Dhitika rescued Krishna, a householder’s son, from danger upon an ocean island, ordained him, and entrusted the doctrine to him.Exalted Venerable Krishna brought many monks, ordinary beings who persisted in their belief in an existent self, to the true view. He performed a wide range of activity in the service of the doctrine, such as illuminating the teachings on the island of Sri Lanka, then entrusted the doctrine to Sudar-shana (son of Darshana, a descendant of Pandu), who had previously been brought to liberation by arhat Sukayana. Eminent Sudarshana subdued fi ve hundred nagas and noxious spirits who had no faith in the doctrine. He fi lled the entirety of south India with temples and members of the Buddhist spiritual community, introduced the doctrine to many minor lands, spread Buddhism a little in China, then transcended sorrow.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 201TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2016/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"202 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh us, there were seven patriarchs of the doctrine from Eminent Kash-yapa to Sudarshana, or eight, if Eminent Madhyantika (mentioned above) is added. All were arhats: they were completely free of the two [obscuring ] factors, had attained meditative concentration within the eight aspects of liberation, had heard and retained the entire excellent speech of the Bud-dha, and preserved the complete doctrine. Th eir deeds were similar to those of the Buddha himself. Although many arhats followed them, none equaled their deeds. Th is concludes an account of the doctrine’s seven patriarchs, as it appears in Various Scriptures on Monastic Discipline.Within the pious attendant [tradition], there are no explicit accounts of patriarchs aft er these. In the great way, A Commentary on “Th e Journey to Lanka Discourse” relates a succession of subsequent patriarchs until Bhikshu Singha. Th is [other] line of patriarchs is as above from our teacher until Dhitika, then Dhitika entrusted the teaching to Vibhaga, who entrusted it to Venerable Buddhanandi, and so on, through Buddhamitra, Bhikshu Parshva, Sushanata, Ashvagosha, Amrita, Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Rahula, Sanghanandi, Bhikshu Arhat, Kalasha, Kumarala, Shavata, Vasubandhu, Manota, Hagalikanayanasha, and Bhikshu Singha.

Th ose who received full ordination, applied themselves to medita-tive concentration, and attained the four results—stream enterer, once returner, non-returner, and arhat—increased daily: they became as numerous as dust motes. On the subject of Th e Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition, the omniscient master Taranata states:“Detailed exposition” means “a thorough explanation.” Be-fore this treatise, the exact words of the teacher’s canon were recited, followed by a presentation of their profound instruc-tions. In the course of that teaching, the canon’s meanings were elucidated, yet no separate treatises more accessible than the discourses existed. Subsequently, for the benefi t of future TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 202TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2026/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"buddhism in the land of exalted beings \u0003 203beings, this treatise which provides detailed expositions was composed. Some state that arhats living during the time of Up-agupta wrote it together. Others believe that Yashah, Sarvaka-ma, and others composed it. Tibetans claim that fi ve hundred arhats, including Sarvakama and Kubjita, wrote this treatise at Nata-bhatika Monastery in the northern Vindhya Hills. Th at account seems to blend the two former customary versions. In any case, those arhats’ verbal transmissions were compiled in one place; what had been passed from one elder’s ear to an-other was recorded in writing.According to the proponents of the materialist school’s tra-dition, the seven texts on observed phenomena belong to the canon, and the earliest treatise of commentary is Th e Great Trea-sury of Detailed Exposition. Proponents of the discourse school believe that pious attendants who were ordinary beings wrote the seven texts on observed phenomena that predate Th e Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition, and that those seven texts were spuriously promoted as Shariputra’s and others’ compilations of our teacher’s words. Th ey therefore contend that the fi rst treatis-es to comment upon the Buddha’s intent were the seven texts on observed phenomena. Some masters state that the seven texts on observed phenomena were originally the Buddha’s canon, but words were subsequently interpolated from pious attendants who were ordinary beings; this is possible, as in the case of some discourses that have [diff ering redactions] in diff erent Buddhist ways. Th erefore, errors in these [seven texts] that contradict [proof based upon] the three kinds of logic should be viewed as later contaminating interpolations. [Th ese masters] believe that since the great way tradition has a distinct collection on ob-served phenomena, a similar collection must also appear in the pious attendant tradition. Although it is true that the three col-lections are interrelated in meaning, the other two collections did appear in distinct volumes [within the pious attendant tra-dition]. Th erefore, there is no reason why the mother teachings should not follow the same pattern. So they contend.While this latter proposition seems reasonable, the preemi-nent Master Vasubandhu appears to have agreed with the dis-course school’s belief; thus, I provisionally accept that view.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 203TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2036/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"204 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge[During] the pious attendant period, many hundred thousand monks—the four great noble masters and others—Preserved the masters’ individual schools.Th e eminent monk Dharmatrata from Kashmir, the prominent monk Vasumitra from Maru in the west, the prominent monk Ghoshaka from Togar (Tukharistan), and the monk Buddhadev from Varanasi were known as the detailed exposition school’s four leading masters.

During his lifetime, the prominent monk Avitarka and others, including Vigataragadvaja, Divyakaragupta, Rahulamitra, and Jnanatala, received teachings directly from lord bodhi-sattvas of awakening’s tenth stage, including Loving-Kindness, Gentle Splendor, All-Seeing One, and Lord of Secrets. Five hundred such mas-ters appeared who without exception attained the meditative state of the stream of the teachings.King Lakshashva presented them off erings in faith, and donated temples and disciples. He sponsored the copying of volumes of the teachings’ col-lections, and initiated their study and teaching. One thousand, fi ve hun-dred practitioners of the great way appeared; all without exception retained countless discourses, gained unimpeded intelligence, and attained forbear-ance [of the nature of reality]. Each demonstrated openly to others some displays of miracles and clairvoyance. Many followers of the great way issued from them.Concurrently, the majority of great way discourses, including the hundred-thousand-verse Th e Noble Cluster of Jewels Discourse, the hun-dred-thousand-verse Th e Flower Ornament Discourse, the twenty-fi ve-thousand-verse Journey to Lanka Discourse, the twelve-thousand-verse Discourse of the Richly Designed Ornament, and the twelve-thousand-verse True Compendium of the Dharma, were brought to the human world from such diverse regions as those of gods, nagas, celestial musicians, and ogres. In particular, many texts came from the nagas’ lands. During that period, the great way’s fame fi lled every region, which did not meet with the pious attendants’ approval. Th ey disparaged the teachings: “Th e great way does not constitute the Buddha’s word.” Th erefore, Aryapada [i.e., Nagarjuna] and other masters later proved the great way to be the Buddha’s word.At Nalanda, Udbhatasiddhisvamin built a temple.Nanda and others composed many treatises.Th ey were known as proponents of the aspects of consciousness.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 205TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2056/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"206 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeFive hundred masters of the great way then conferred. Th ey saw that due to auspicious connections, if Buddhism were taught at Maudgalyayana’s birthplace, it would merely become powerful, whereas if it were taught at exalted Shariputra’s birthplace, it would fl ourish extensively. Noble Shariputra’s birth [had taken place centuries earlier] in the brahmin town Nalada or Nalanda (translated in Tibetan as either “given continu-ously“ or “given by reeds”). Later, in the ruins of this town, King Ashoka repaired and honored Shariputra’s stupa and built a temple. It was there that the masters lived and taught.During this period, two brahmin brothers Udbhatasiddhisvamin and Shamkarapati built eight temples there, and placed within them all the vol-umes of the great way’s texts. Later, noble Nanda, Paramasena, and Samyak-satya wrote many treatises to elucidate the yogachara scriptural tradition. Th ose three masters are known as “the early yogachara proponents.” All the earlier fi ve hundred masters, along with their followers, form what is known as the school of aspects of consciousness.Th e Spread of the Great Middle Way View [b]Th e ancestor of accomplished masters, Venerable Rahulabhadra,First elucidated the supreme vehicle’s middle way tradition.Around that time, Brahmin Rahulabhadra, the ancestor of every accom-plished master, took full ordination from Venerable Krishna. He received an ocean of great way discourses and tantras from many [human] masters, such as Avitarka, and from many supreme wisdom deities, such as Lord of Secrets. His teaching of those discourses at Nalanda marked the fi rst full elucidation of the great way’s middle way tradition.At that time, there appeared just eight masters, including noble Kama-lagarbha, who held the middle way tradition. Among them, the prominent monk Prakashdharmamani received teaching directly from the exalted bodhisattva Dispeller of Obscurations, attained the state of forbearance of unborn phenomena, then retrieved the hundred-thousand-verse, thou-sand-chapter Th e Great Compendium Discourse from a world beneath the ground.Th e second buddha, exalted Nagarjuna,Th en brought the Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Th ousand Verses [to this world].TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 206TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2066/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"buddhism in the land of exalted beings \u0003 207Nagarjuna’s three collections explain the intent of the teachings’ three wheels.He defeated in debate believers in external reality, and proved the great way to be the Buddha’s word.Th e great master Nagarjuna, whose impact was that of a second buddha, was born in the southern land of Vaidarbha.

He studied, taught, and meditated, built ten million temples and stupas, provided for Buddhist communities, aided nagas and other non-human beings, and defeated challenges from non-Buddhists.

Aryadeva defeated him in debate and had him enter the Buddha’s doctrine. He then became known as the master Shura, who composed Th irty-four Past Lives of Buddha Shakyamuni and other texts of great benefi t to the Buddhist doctrine.A lineage of disciples appeared in succession, including [Aryadeva’s dis-ciple] Rahulabhadra, a commoner who took renunciant vows and attained sublime accomplishment.

Hold-ing the bodhisattva’s robe, he traveled to Joyful Heaven, where during twenty-fi ve human years he received fi ve treatises and other teachings directly from Maitreya. Asanga then returned to the human world to aid beings and became the supreme epitome of inconceivable qualities such as clairvoyance.He wrote down Maitreya’s fi ve treatises and composed extensive trea-tises to elucidate their intent—his fi ve treatises on the stages of awaken-ing. He also composed general summaries of the lesser and great way: A Compendium of Observed Phenomena and A Compendium of the Great Way. In particular, this master elucidated the great way’s collection on observed phenomena, which no one had been able to understand.

Maitreya’s fi rst three teachings spread and became widely known from the beginning, but Discerning Between Phenomena and Th eir Nature and Th e Highest Continuity were originally unknown to other scholars. At a later time [more than fi ve hundred years later], Métripa saw light shining from a crack in a stupa, where [he retrieved] these two texts. When Métripa prayed to noble Maitreya, the bodhisattva appeared clearly in a gap in the clouds and confi rmed the teachings. Métripa gave them to Pandit Nandakirti, who passed them to the Kashmiri Master Saj-jana, from whom they passed in a successive lineage. Th erefore, such texts as Hari bhadra’s An Extensive Commentary to “Th e Perfection of Sublime Insight TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 211TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2116/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"212 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeDiscourse in Eight Th ousand Verses” contain no quotations from those two treatises.

Th e second, Th e Ornament of the Discourses, resembles a compendium of various, miscel-laneous great way discourses. Th ey consider that those two treatises’ sub-jects are somewhat summarized in Discerning Between the Center and the Extremes; their subjects are summarized to a great degree in Discerning Between Phenomena and Th eir Nature. Th e treatise Th e Highest Continu-ity (which includes a concluding dedication) elucidates the intent of the Buddha’s foremost excellent speech, the defi nitive meaning based upon the fi nal wheel of the teachings. Th e three intermediate texts possess neither an [initial] expression of homage nor a [concluding ] dedication. Th e fi rst text has no dedication; the last, no expression of homage. Th erefore, they attribute the fi ve treatises this order as one continuous body of work. Th us it is taught.Among these texts, Th e Ornament of the Discourses synthesizes all great way teaching into fi ve points, which it presents. Th us, it is a commentary on the intent of infi nite discourses of the great way. In twenty-one chapters, it establishes proof of the great way as the Buddha’s word, and other subjects. Th e stages of the path are explained in ten points, including “Spiritual affi n-ity, the aspiration to practice the teachings . . . ,” to present various provi-sional and defi nitive aspects of the teachings.Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization employs eight main topics and seventy branch points to defi ne the hidden meaning of the perfection of sublime insight. Discerning Between the Center and the Extremes employs the three characteristics [dependent, imagined, and consummate] (the text’s subject) to present the path of the middle way by diff erentiating between the center, which does not fall into the two extremes of imputation and dep-recation, and the extremes that result from such falling. Discerning Between Phenomena and Th eir Nature presents all phenomena by diff erentiating between the phenomenal, the wheel of life; and the nature of phenomena, transcendence of sorrow. Th e Highest Continuity’s seven vajra subjects pri-marily defi ne buddha nature.Tibetans scholars in general think that Th e Ornament of the Discourses TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 212TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2126/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"buddhism in the land of exalted beings \u0003 213and the two Discernings primarily elucidate the intent of the fi nal doctri-nal cycle and present the mind-only view.

Th ere is no disagree-ment concerning [this description of those four texts].Concerning Th e Highest Continuity, early Tibetan masters consider it to be a commentary on the intent of the middle doctrinal cycle, that it teaches the independently verifi able reason view. Lord Drakpa Gyaltsen and peer-less Gampopa, along with their disciples, considered it to be a middle way text. Butön Rinpoché stated that it is a commentary to the fi nal doctrinal cycle, and that it teaches mind-only and middle way views, as suitable. Lord Tsongkapa considered it to belong among consequentialist texts; Ludrup Gyatso, mind-only works. Various such confl icting views exist concerning the nature of this text.Master Vasubandhu, Dignaga, Shantipa, and others explain Th e Orna-ment of Manifest Realization as a text that expounds the view of aspects of consciousness. Exalted Haribhadra, Jnanapada, Abhayakaragupta, Lord Atisha, and others explain it to be a text that expounds the view of the lack of inherent nature. Most earlier and later Tibetan scholars consider it a com-mentary on the second turning of the wheel, presenting the independently verifi able reason view. Venerable Lord Mikyö Dorjé, Tsongkapa, and others consider that it presents the consequentialist view. Th e omniscient lord of the Jonang teachings, the spiritual father [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] and his heirs, consider that apart from mere diff erences in degree, Maitreya’s fi ve treatises are middle way texts, and that they mostly teach extrinsic empti-ness, the view of the great middle way.Asanga’s Five TreatisesAsanga’s fi ve treatises on awakening’s stages comprise a principal text and four summaries. Among them, the main description of awakening’s stages is synthesized into seventeen stages and presented as such.

Th e stage with the fi ve consciousnesses and the stage of the mental function constitute the nature of the support. Th ree stages—examination and analysis, analysis without examination, and with nei-ther examination nor analysis—show how the support is entered. Four stages—settling in evenness, not settling, with mind, and without mind—are the circumstances of the support. In relation to engagement, there are three stages: listening , contemplation, and meditation. In relation to the result, the temporary results are three stages of the three ways—of pious attendants, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas; and the ultimate result—the result accompanied by the psycho-physical aggregates as a remainder or without this remainder.[Among the four summaries,] A Summary of Defi nitive Presentations is like a commentary to those stages. A Summary of the Basis presents how the preceding treatises are contained within the three collections. A Sum-mary of Enumerations is so named because it enumerates the terms used, or because it explains specifi cally the enumeration of defi lements and purifi ca-tions. A Summary of Avenues of Explanation presents teaching methods. In this way, this fi vefold collection presents the intent of the Buddha’s excellent speech, Buddhism’s basic texts, and its teachings methods.Vasubandhu and others transmitted the doctrine widely.Th e Root Tantra of Manjushri states:Aft erwards, the famed one,A southern brahmin,Whose [name] begins with Va ,TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 214TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2146/14/10 3:51:48 PM6/14/10 3:51:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"buddhism in the land of exalted beings \u0003 215Will cherish the Buddha’s teachingsAnd reside at Arama Stupa.On the stage of an attractiveRefl ection of a lamp,He will adorn everythingAs far as the two oceans.His life thus foretold, it is said of Master Vasubandhu, Asanga’s younger brother, that no one as learned as he has appeared since our teacher’s transcendence of sorrow. All spiritual communities of the lesser and great ways esteem him. He composed at least fi ft y commentarial treatises on others’ works, as well as eight original works known as the dissertations. He worked widely for the doctrine, including establishing six hundred and fi ft y-four monasteries, and supporting over sixty thousand monks of the great way. Some Indian and Tibetan [scholars] think that the above prophecy indicates that he was an exalted being who achieved awaken-ing’s eighth stage. An unbroken succession of many scholars and accom-plished masters from him include four of his disciples more learned than he himself, and further, the lord of speech Ratnadasa, Vinitadeva, Chandragomi, and master Dharmapala, all of whom spread the doctrine widely.Th e eight dissertations, original texts composed by the master himself, are as follows: (1) Th irty Verses presents all phenomena to be mind alone; (2) Tw e n t y Ve r s e s uses reasoning to prove [all phenomena to be mind alone]; (3) A Dissertation on the Five Aggregates validates the fi ve aggregates as the basis for [all phenomena]; (4) A Rational System of Exposition validates that study and teaching ; (5) Th e Accomplishment of Actions validates the actions of the three avenues [of body, speech, and mind].

He received teachings directly from Manjushri. He explained many discourses and composed an extensive collection of works on observed phenomena. Purely through his own exceptional abilities, he wrote many miscellaneous treatises on dialectics. Subsequently, with the intention of compiling them into a single work, he composed an [introductory] expression of homage. A portent [of the work’s success] was a challenge from Brahmin Krishna, whom Dignaga defeated in debate. Dignaga then continued to compose a total of a hun-dred earlier and later treatises, including A Compendium of All Discourses on Logic. He was the fi rst to illuminate a system of logic. He restored many failing monasteries and established many new ones. Known as “the great bull of debate,” he totally defeated in debate most of the pernicious attacks made by those expressing wrong views. His disciples fi lled the breadth of all directions, and illuminated the doctrine.Dharmakirti initially studied logic under Ishvarasena, a disciple of Dig-naga.

Th e principal ones, as famous as the sun and moon, known as six adornments who beautify the world, are Nagarjuna, Asanga, and Dignaga—who wrote the classics—and Arya-deva, Vasubandhu, and Dharmakirti—who wrote commentaries. Shura, Rahulabhadra, Gunaprabha, and Dharmapala are the four supreme mas-ters.

In par-ticular, not long aft er the third compilation of the teachings, when all the great way discourses arrived together [in this world] and spread, [these two classes of tantra] were openly practiced, and they fl ourished. It has been said that one hundred thousand or more awareness holders appeared who accomplished these tantras’ awareness mantras.Saraha brought an ocean of tantras,Including Buddha Skull, from the region of Oddiyana.Just three hundred years aft er our teacher’s transcendence of sorrow, at the time Buddhist King Chandravardhana in Shambhala departed to the body of perfect rapture, the great Brahmin Rahula appeared in the region of Lada. He had many teachers, such as Master Avitarka and Visukalpa, king of Orissa, who went to Oddiyana, where a yogini trans-formed from a naga granted him Matrix of Mystery empowerment, and he attained accomplishment. In particular, Rahula received many tantras directly from Lord of Secrets and other sublime wisdom deities, and then attained sublime accomplishment. When he engaged in tantric conduct, he became known as Saraha. He brought many volumes of an ocean of tantras, including Buddha Skull, from the region of Oddiyana, and he composed A Commentary on “Th e Buddha Skull Tantra” and other texts.Before Saraha, it seems that yoga and highest yoga tantras appeared directly only to supremely fortunate disciples but did not remain as con-tinuous transmissions. Later, from this superb master’s time forward, these tantras fl ourished and endured in continuous transmissions. Th erefore, Saraha is the supreme source of every tantra and accomplished master.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 218TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2186/14/10 3:51:49 PM6/14/10 3:51:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"buddhism in the land of exalted beings \u0003 219Due to the accomplishment of King Indrabhuti and his retinue,His land became the source of the vajra way.It has been taught that secret mantra’s tantras were brought from the region of Oddiyana; how is it that all secret mantra’s tantras dwelled there?As related above, during the Transcendent Conqueror’s lifetime, the western kingdom of Oddiyana was located fi ve hundred leagues west of Shravasti. Th ere, the king known as Indrabhuti heard the Transcendent Conqueror’s name, had faith and paid homage, and mentally supplicated him. Th us, the Transcendent Conqueror appeared before him, emanated the sacred circle of Matrix of Mystery Unmoving Vajra, and granted empow-erment to the king and his court. Th e Buddha taught the tantra that reveals special techniques to travel the spiritual path without relinquishing sensory pleasures, and he granted its subsequent profound instructions. Th e king comprehended the entire import of those teachings and began wide-rang-ing , elaborate tantric conduct. Th us he and his court attained the stage of awareness holder; this is known as this country being emptied all at once.Immediately thereaft er, a southern lake swelled; its waters along with many nagas fi lled the land. Vajra Holder entrusted volumes of tantras to those nagas, who changed themselves into human beings and built a city on the lakeshore. In cultivating their experience on the path, most attained accomplishment. Th ose who did not gain achievement became human beings; they and the monarchs who protected them all received Buddhist teaching.Later, the lake dried up; on its dry bed stood Dharmaganja, called “Trove of the Teachings,” a palace that housed all secret mantra’s tantras. A city where many awareness-holding spiritual heroes and yoginis lived circled the palace. Due to the primary condition of this steady gathering of awak-ened beings, and a sublime convergence of auspicious connections, this land known as “Oddiyana, Land of the Dakinis” became the supreme source of the secret mantra vajra way.Th e father, the exalted master, and his spiritual heirs clearly elucidated Matrix of Mystery.Th e exalted master [Nagarjuna] and his spiritual heirs clearly elucidated the traditional path of glorious Matrix of Mystery as follows.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 219TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2196/14/10 3:51:49 PM6/14/10 3:51:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"220 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e great Brahmin [Saraha] granted the exalted master [Nagarjuna] empowerment, taught him the tantra and pith instructions; and entrusted the secret mantra doctrine to him.

His works include A Lamp for the Concise Practice, which has the attribute of not needing other supplementary texts; and a separate small text for self-consecration of the illusory body.Th e exalted master’s direct disciple Nagabodhi composed Th e Twenty-Part Ritual for the Sacred Circle; A Graded Outline for the phase of creation; and Discerning Activity’s Culmination, concerning the phase of completion. Chandrakirti composed a commentary to the tantra, Th e Radiant Lamp; Narotapa later composed A Clear Summary of the Five Stages.In general, we count fi ft y-some known Indian texts concerning Matrix of Mystery, yet the undisputed forebear of all these teachings is the exalted master’s cycle of root texts and commentaries mentioned above. Neverthe-less, during the actual lifetimes of Nagarjuna, the father, and his spiritual heirs, those works were not commonly spread in forms such as those [in texts, which have] the three combinations [of terms, words, and letters]. Th e exalted master’s direct disciple Nagabodhi attained vajra rainbow body and lived at Shriparvata, where about seven hundred years aft er Nagar-juna’s passing, he accepted two disciples, the untouchable Matangipa and Prince Gomishra, to whom he gave the exalted master’s cycle of teachings. Rakshitapada, a master from Kongkana, met Chandrakirti [in a vision], then acquired the volume Th e Radiant Lamp.

He had been the king of Oddiyana’s scribe by the name of Ever Virtuous. His fi rst spiritual master was the accomplished master Shavaripa. In Bangala (eastern India), he ate fi sh entrails and practiced meditation, thus becoming known as Luyipa in Sanskrit, or “fi sh entrails man.” Having attained accomplish-ment, he used miracles to guide Orissa’s king and chief minister. Later, the king attained accomplishment as Darikapa. He and his court of sixty thousand achieved rainbow body. Th e minister attained accomplishment as Dingipa, and achieved rainbow body along with his circle of fi ve hun-dred disciples.Master Luyipa drew forth such tantras as Th e Ta n t r a o f Yoginis’ Conduct and composed the text Binder of the Wheel—A Description of the Deity, for which Kambala wrote a commentary.

His actual name was Matigarbhashri. Vajra Sow openly foretold that he would be a scholar able to defeat Hindus’ challenges. When practicing in the region of Orissa, he fi rst refused the king’s invitation. Later, he lived with a consort; as a result, people lost faith in him. To guide them, he ema-nated a son and daughter, and appeared once with them in a city. When people berated him, he struck his horn drinking vessel on the ground, and water gushed from the earth below. He turned the boy into a vajra, the girl became a bell, and he bore them in his hands. Th e master and his con-sort changed into the co-emergent form of Supreme Bliss and fl ew into the sky. By this display of miracles, he became known as Vajraghantapa [vajra and bell master]. From that time, he accomplished beings’ welfare through the secret mantra way.

Moreover, he wrote commentar-ies to many tantras [not among yoga tantras], such as Matrix of Mys-tery, illuminating secret mantra in general, and the yoga tantra system in particular.Buddhashanti, Prajnapalita, and others also emphasized yoga tantra’s scholarship and meditation practice, and widely disseminated yoga tantra’s historical tradition.Chilupa and Kalachakrapada, the elder and the younger,Drew forth Th e Wheel of Time Tantra, and spread the bodhisattvas’ commentaries.Chilupa (also known as Pito Acharya the Elder) from Orvipa in the east became a great scholar.

Once he had memorized every text, Chi-lupa’s mind was satisfi ed and he returned [to India]. In Varendra, Chilupa accepted Pindopa the Younger as his disciple, and granted him the entirety of the empowerments, tantras, etc. When war’s destruction erupted, this master concealed the tantra and its commentaries; thus, the root tantra and commentaries later became incomplete.Of special import to the lineage, the one known as Kalachakrapada the Elder appeared in Varendra. He met Chilupa the Younger, who could not satisfy this disciple. Kalachakrapada journeyed to Shambhala; on his way, he met the lineage bearer’s manifestation, who granted him empowerments and taught the pith instructions. Aft er meditation [on those instructions], he attained accomplishment and arrived in Shambhala, where he received the empowerments, tantra commentaries, and pith instructions directly from the lineage bearer himself.Kalachakrapada returned to India and extensively spread the cycle of the bodhisattvas’ commentaries. Among his disciples, Shri Bhadra, “Kalachakra-pada the Younger,” entered discussions with fi ve hundred scholars in Nal-anda and overwhelmed them with his speech.

Aft er the conclusion of the Chandra Dynasty [i.e., Gupta], [a series of ] fourteen Pala kings arose. King Dharmapala, fourth in that line, wielded extremely great power and infl uence. In Magadha’s northern edge, at the top of a knoll on the banks of the Ganges, he built what was lauded by the name Vikramashila, “Th e Nature of Complete Subjuga-tion.” Th is great temple hosted scholars who illuminated the doctrine—many very great masters of the secret mantra way, such as Buddhajnana; and a succession of masters who defended Buddhism by uniting the dis-course and secret mantra doctrines.

Th e guardian of the east-ern gate was Ratnakarashantipa, the omniscient master during the age of confl ict; the guardian of the southern gate was Prajnakara; the guard-ian of the western gate was Vakishvarakirti; the guardian of the northern gate was Naropa; the guardian of the fi rst central pillar was Brahmin Rat-navajra; and the guardian of the second central pillar was Jnanashrimitra.

Learned in all secret mantra tantras, he attained the path of seeing’s quali-ties. He had many vajra holder disciples, such as the great master Pitopa. In particular, his kindness and activity in the Himalayan region were exceptionally impressive.AbhayakaraguptaAbhayakaragupta served as abbot at three Buddhist centers: Vajra Seat [Bodhgaya], Vikramashila, and Nalanda. A great lord of the doctrine, he was incomparable in his own time. He caused all lesser and great way teachings to fl ourish very widely, especially the perfection of sublime insight teaching system. Aft er the six ornaments, it is said that no one so extensively served the doctrine and aided beings as did Ratnakarashan-tipa (one of the six learned gate guardians) and this master.Aft er Vajra Yogini blessed Abhayakaragupta and bestowed her autho-rization, he composed many profound and vast treatises on the secret mantra doctrine, including a commentary on Samputa Tantra, Sheaves of Pith Instructions; and Th e Garland Trilog y. For later generations, these treatises he wrote are like revitalizing nectar for someone on the point of death. It is said that no one followed him who was his equal as a prodi-gious scholar who illuminated the doctrine. He also knew this, so he left behind, like answering replies for future generations, eloquent treatises that clarifi ed what had been unclear, compiled what had been scattered, and systematized what had become disorganized.Abhayakaragupta had many disciples, such as Shubhakaragupta, who were vajra holders, were diligent vow keepers, had crossed the ocean of the Buddha’s teachings, and illuminated the doctrine. In particular, Ratnarakshita attained accomplishment and composed such texts as a commentary to Th e Origins of Binder of the Wheel Tantra. While Rat-narakshita served as the master of secret mantra at Vikramashila, those known as the twenty-four mahantas appeared and widely transmitted the doctrine of the vajra way.How Th ese Collections Will Spread in India in the Present and Future [3]Secret mantra remained in Koki in the east and in the midst of the southern Vindhya Hills.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 231TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2316/14/10 3:51:49 PM6/14/10 3:51:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"232 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeIn some small lands in the southeast and southwest,Th e Victor’s doctrine lasted until later times.In the region of Koki (which forms one of the three regions of eastern India), monastic communities appeared from the time of King Ashoka and later increased and proliferated. Before Vasubandhu, these commu-nities were solely composed of the lesser way’s pious attendants. Some of Vasubandhu’s disciples propagated the great way there, where it contin-ued to a minor degree. From the reign of King Dharmapala, a large num-ber of disciples from these regions came to central India. In particular, during the reign of the four Sena Dynasty kings, about half of the monas-tic community in Magadha originated in Koki. As a result, the great way became very widespread [in Koki], and there, as in Tibet, no distinction was made between the great and lesser ways.From the time of Abhayakaragupta, the secret mantra way also became very widespread [in Koki]. When the Turukshas conquered Magadha, most central Indian scholars fl ed to Koki and spread the doctrine widely there. Later, masters who were of supreme kindness to the secret mantra tradition (such as Vanaratna, who was accepted as a disciple by glorious Shavaripa) came from this country and journeyed to Tibet.Later, a Koki king named Vasundhara appeared. In his land, the textual traditions of the monastic discipline, the collection on observed phenom-ena, and the great way were very widespread, but secret mantra teachings had become extremely rare apart from a few texts such as those related to Wheel of Time and Th e Garland Trilog y. Th erefore, the king dispatched two hundred scholars as emissaries to the supremely accomplished mas-ter Shantigupta and other masters in Dravida and Khagendra in southern India, to have them train in secret mantra teachings. On their return, they revived [secret mantra in their homeland].Further, in the land of exalted beings’ southern region, the doctrine fl our-ished widely and continued without interruption. In later times in particu-lar, the king of accomplishment Shantigupta’s powerful blessings ensured that the genuine doctrine of mainly secret mantra’s scholarship and practice greatly spread and was transmitted in Khagendra and in the midst of the Vindhya Hills.

Th en a monkey blessed by [Bodhisattva] Great Compas-sion arrived from the realm of Potala and cohabited with a female ogre who lived in the cliff s. Ancient Tibetan chronicles state that the Tibetan people descend from their union. [In another account,] Master Prajna-varman’s A Commentary on “Th e Foremost Praise fr om the Gods” states that the fi ve Pandava brothers, who lived at the outset of the era of con-fl ict, defeated an army of eighteen regiments. At that time, a king called Rupati, fi ghting with a single regiment, escaped during battle disguised in women’s clothing. He entered the fastness of the Himalayas and stayed there; the Tibetan people descend from his family. Many such explana-tions [of the origins of the Tibetan people] have appeared. In any case, nonhumans fi rst claimed this land. Humans gradually appeared, ruled by twelve minor kings and fourteen feudal lords.Th e fi rst human king to govern all Tibet was Nyatri Tsenpo. Concern-ing him, scriptures affi rm that Tibet’s Buddhist kings descended from the Licchavi clan. Some believe the royal family comes from the continent Ominous Sound; some, that they descend from the royal Shakya line or from King Shantanika’s son. Some claim that their line begins fi ve genera-tions aft er Kosala King Prasanajit’s son; or fi ve generations aft er the son of Tobchung, youngest son of King Bimbisara.[Another account states that] King Udayana of Vatsa had a son whose eyebrows covered his eyes and whose fi ngers were connected by webs. Th is was feared to be a bad omen so he was put in a sealed copper con-tainer and sent down the Ganges River. A farmer found and raised him. When he had grown and the previous story was related to him, he became despondent and ran off to the Himalayan hills. In time, he reached the entrance to Lhari Yolwa. When he emerged at Tsentang Gozhi, Bönpos said that since he had arrived on a cord of light, he was a god. “Who are you?” they asked. “I am a ruler [Tibetan: “tsenpo”],” he replied. “Where TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 237TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2376/14/10 3:51:49 PM6/14/10 3:51:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"238 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgehave you come from?” they asked, and he pointed to the sky. At that, they set him on a wooden palanquin [“tri”], which four people bore on the nape of their necks [“nya”]; and so it was that he was called Nyatri Tsenpo, ruler of the nape-borne palanquin. His descendents, including his son Mutri Tsenpo, ruled in dynasties designated by such names as the seven heavenly thrones, the six earthly goodnesses, the seven fragments, and fi ve generations of kings named Tsen. During these earlier kingdoms, legends and enigmatic riddles guided the system of government.Th e Stainless Goddess Prophecy states:Tw e n t y - fi ve hundred years aft er my transcendence of sorrow, the sacred teachings will spread to the land of the red-faced people.As foretold, during the twenty-seventh dynasty, when King Lha Totori Nyentsen, emanation of Bodhisattva Ever Excellent, lived in Yumbu Lagang Palace, a container fell on the palace roof. Opening it, he found Th e Discourse of One Hundred Homages to Renunciation and Fulfi llment; the long mantra [of Bodhisattva All-Seeing One], chindamani, carved on a bowl; Th e Discourse of the Container; the six-syllable mantra [of All-Seeing One]; and a golden stupa. Although he didn’t know what these were, he understood them to be good. He called them by the name “Strict Secret,” made off erings, and venerated them; their blessings returned the sixty-one-year-old king to sixteen-year-old youthfulness. Living another sixty years, he reached the age of one hundred and twenty. He received a prophecy that aft er fi ve generations in his family, the meaning of these events would be understood. Th us did the sacred teachings reach Tibet.Although this account has been interpreted in many ways, Nelpa Pan-dit states that the so-called falling [of the objects] out of the sky is a Bön tale because Bönpos like space. He says that in fact Scholar Buddhirak-shita and Translator Tilésé bore the two texts on their arrival in Tibet, but as the king was illiterate and couldn’t understand their meaning, the scholar and translator returned home. Th is is probably the case.Later, when Ba Salnang went to Nepal to meet the abbot Shantarak-shita, the abbot said, “During the time of Kashyapa’s doctrine, the three of us—the Tibetan king, you, and I—were a poultry woman’s three sons, and we made aspirations to spread the doctrine in Tibet.

When the king was fi ft een, the emanated monk Akaramati Shila brought the self-formed [statue] of the exalted bodhisattva [All-Seeing One to Tibet]. Th e king commanded the Buddhist offi cial Gar, emanation of Bodhisattva Vajra Holder: “Bring to Tibet life-size statues that are actual representatives of our teacher at the age of eight and twelve years old.”7 To that end, the king conformed to worldly customs and married two women known as lotuses in the lake: the Nepali bride Tritsun, an emanation of Frowning Goddess, and the Chinese bride Princess Wencheng Gonju, emanation of Tara. Since nonhuman spirits impeded the construction of the Temple of Magical Manifestation [now called the Jokang, in Lhasa], the three—the king and the two queens—entered retreat at Kyishö Valley’s Nyangtren Rock, known as Maru Palace. Th ey practiced the wisdom deity and gained success. Th en, as foretold, on vital points on the land which is a demoness lying supine, they constructed border-subduing and suppression temples, conquering evil enemy earth spirits.

Th ey cultivated their experience and it is said that [at that time, generations] before the seven men under examination renounced home life [i.e., the fi rst Tibetan monks], about one hundred long-haired adepts continually engaged in the contempla-tive practice of Great Compassion at Kyishö Valley’s Nyangtren Rock.All the teachings the king imparted during that time were compiled as the cycle of the king’s testament and concealed as three treasures. Th ree treasure revealers—the accomplished master Drup-tob Ngödrup, Lord Nyang-ral Nyima Özer, and the teacher Shakya Ö—drew them from their treasure repositories. Now known as Th e Hundred Th ousand Instructions on the “Mani” Mantra, this represents Tibet’s fi rst indigenous Buddhist text.Tonmi Sambhota invented an orthography and grammar,Opening the great door of Himalayan discourse for the fi rst time.Th e king dispatched Tonmi Sambhota, emanation of Bodhisattva Gentle Melody, to India to learn linguistics and writing. Using Indian letters as a model, he invented Tibetan orthography and composed eight treatises on grammar. Previously in the Himalayan region, there had been no Bud-dhist discussion of what was to be adopted and what was to be rejected.

When the predicted time arrived, King Trisong Déutsen developed the intention to spread the sacred teachings. He invited the abbot from Zahor, Shantarakshita, who imparted the eight precepts to some people and gave teachings relating to the ten virtues and the eighteen sense con-stituents. At this, Tibet’s hostile gods and demons became incensed and acted harmfully, making various obstacles.Th e time [of the ripening ] of previous aspirations and prayers thus arrived: as the abbot advised, the king invited to Tibet the master from Oddiyana, Padmasambhava. When the king had reached twenty-two years of age, the foundation of glorious Samyé Monastery was laid. Padmasambhava performed the earth consecration ritual; Bodhisatto [i.e., Shantarakshita], the geomancy. Using [India’s] Odantapuri Temple as a model, they constructed the arrangement of [this world system’s] Supreme Mountain, twelve continents, the pair of the sun and moon, and circle of iron mountains.

Translations and teachings of secret mantra were extremely secret and reserved as private instruction.It is said that there were twelve colleges, one hundred and eight accomplished masters each at Yerpa and Chuwori, and twenty-fi ve great accomplished masters at Chimpu, etc. Particularly, great Master Padma-sambhava accepted as disciples infi nite numbers of fortunate persons, including twenty-fi ve disciples (the king and his subjects), within the unsurpassable secret mantra way; the numbers of those who traveled to the exalted state of supreme accomplishment exceed all reckoning.Master Padmasambhava concealed countless treasures of teaching and wealth, subdued all hostile gods and demons, and issued commands to TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 241TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2416/14/10 3:51:49 PM6/14/10 3:51:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"242 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe twelve subterranean goddesses.

For these, search for valuable words from our language and add them, revis-ing the translations to make them consistent with the terminolog y of the lesser and great ways.” Th us in Penyul’s Kawa Namo Ché, the extensive version of the mother [discourse on the perfection of sublime insight] was revised and made into sixteen volumes.

[What follows is a description] of how those who hold the collection of the sacred teachings on monastic discipline, the basis of all the Buddha’s doctrine, appeared [in Tibet].When Buddhist King Trisong Déutsen heard that the great abbot from Zahor [named] Bodhisatto or Shantarakshita, lord of all collec-tions of teachings and the entire doctrine, was staying in Nepal, he sent Ba Salnang as an envoy to invite him. With deep respect, the king served the scholar attentively and invited from India twelve monks of the sub-stantialist order.At one point, to determine if Tibetans were capable of living as home-less renunciants, the king requested Ba Trizik, his close advisor and a faith-ful Buddhist, to take ordination. Bodhisatto served as abbot; Danashila TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 243TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2436/14/10 3:51:50 PM6/14/10 3:51:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"244 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeand Jinamitra, the action master and secret teacher; and ten other schol-ars, the full assembly. Ba Trizik renounced home life and took monas-tic vows of full ordination. His monastic name was Palyang ; lauded by the king , he was also known as Ba Ratna. Having meditated, he became endowed with fi ve kinds of clairvoyance. Th en, Ba Salnang, Pagor Bérot-sana, Ngenlam Gyalwa Chok-yang, Ma Rinchen Chok, Kön Lu’i Wangpo Sungwa, and Lasum Gyalwa Jangchub respectively renounced home life, changed their names to Yeshé Wangpo, etc., and took full ordination. Th ese seven, known as the seven men under examination, constitute the fi rst Tibetans to renounce home life. Th e king then concluded that Tibet-ans could renounce home life, so his close advisor Drama and three hun-dred intelligent subjects were ordained. As all Tibetans heeded the king’s commands, the king instituted the major Buddhist law that the king and his subjects should all make those who had renounced home life the fore-most recipients of their off erings, and should honor, venerate, and respect them. A stone pillar with this edict [engraved upon it] was erected.One hundred translators, including Kawa Paltsek, studied with the seven men under examination. In turn, one thousand assistant translators, including Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen, studied under [the hundred]: countless sublime individuals—emanations, translators, and monks—appeared.Aft er Lang Darma’s suppression of Buddhism, the lineage passed through Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung, and Tsang Rabsal.Lachen Gongpa Rabsal and his disciples—the ten men from central and western Tibet—Revived the doctrine and established monastic communities far and wide.Due to perverted aspirations, a demon entered the mind of Lord Tri Ral-pachen’s younger brother, Lang Darma Udum Tsen, and he suppressed Buddhism. During that time, three of Ba Ratna’s disciples—Mar Shakya-muni, Yo Géjung, and Tsang Rabsal—took the texts of monastic disci-pline in one mule-load and went [eastward] to Golok and Mongolia. Unable to propagate the doctrine there, they journeyed to Kham [eastern Tibet]. While meditating and living in Malung at Dorjé Drakra Enchung Nam-dzong, or the hermitage of Dentik Shel, [a man named] Muzuk Labar went to investigate, developed faith in them, and requested to renounce home life. Mar Shakyamuni served as abbot and Yo Géjung as TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 244TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2446/14/10 3:51:50 PM6/14/10 3:51:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 245the master, and he was ordained.

Th ey sought Lhalung Palg yi Dorjé, who lived in Den, who replied, “Since I killed the evil king, it is impos-sible for me to join the full assembly. However, I will look for another monk and send him.” He sent two, the Chinese monks Kéwang and Gyipen; as this completed the assembly of fi ve, [Shakya Géwa Rabsal] took full ordination. He studied monastic discipline for fi ft een years with the abbot and master. Later, he studied monastic discipline with Gorong Sengé Drak, the perfection of sublime insight with Kawa Ö Chok-drak, and the mind cycle of great perfection with Yudra Nyingpo. Th e explana-tion of Th e Sovereign All-Creating Mind Tantra passed through him until later times. Due to his outstanding activity, illustrated by these examples, and his vast knowledge, he was also known as Lachen Gongpa Rabsal (the great lama with brilliant realization).Five years aft er he received full ordination, Lord Yeshé Gyaltsen and others sent to Kham fi ve persons from central Tibet, including Lumé Tsultrim Sherab, and fi ve persons from western Tibet, including Lotön Dorjé Wangchuk, to repair the doctrine’s deterioration in central Tibet. On a single occasion, those ten men received the three-part full ordina-tion in stages; they then studied monastic discipline and became learned in it.Th us, Lachen Gongpa Rabsal granted the full ordination at one time without having completed the requisite ten-year supplementary quali-fi cation for an elder. Nevertheless, because Lachen was known to be a bodhisattva acting on his aspirations, because [the others who offi ciated] on this occasion—Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung , and Tsang Rabsal—were special individuals, and because there was an important purpose in that the doctrine had reached a crossroad between its disappearance or re-emergence, holy persons deemed the ordination appropriate and authorized it as faultless. At the ordination, Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung , and Tsang Rabsal were present, but said they were too elderly to con-tinually keep disciples, so they served as action masters [while Lachen Gongpa Rabsal, who they themselves had ordained, served as abbot]. He appointed Lumé Tsultrim Sherab abbot; the ten men from central and western Tibet returned [to central Tibet] and became teachers to the country’s rulers.Lumé Tsultrim Sherab’s disciples included four “pillars,” eight “beams,” thirty-two “raft ers,” and one thousand “planks”; he thus restored the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 245TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2456/14/10 3:51:50 PM6/14/10 3:51:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"246 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgedoctrine’s decline from its foundation. He founded countless monastic centers, such as Lamo Rag yel, Yerpa, and Baré Tsongdu. His disciple from Yamshu, Geshé Trapa, is said to have alone established one hundred and eight monastic centers. In these and other ways, it was as if monastic centers founded by Master Lumé Tsultrim Sherab and his disciples cov-ered the earth. Every day, the ranks of the spiritual community who had renounced home life greatly increased.Th is was known as the tradition of monastic discipline from lower Tibet; these were the men who renounced home life during the period of the early translations. Later, Yudra Nyingpo’s magical manifestation Lochen Dharmashri transmitted widely this tradition’s teachings and practices; thus, the unique ornament of the Tibetan Himalayas, Org yen Mindrol Ling’s monastic community and its branch institutions, [pre-serve] this line of the vows. Most of the earliest sublime individuals who persevered in the vows during the doctrine’s later propagation, and most of the spiritual mentors of the old and new Kadampa orders, were diligent in this lineage of vows. Th ese include many outstanding holders of monastic discipline, such as Gya Duldzin, Matso Changdor, Ja Duldzin, and Shami Mönlam Dorjé. Many well-known sublime individuals appeared uninter-ruptedly [later within this lineage], such as the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, Putopa, Pu-chungwa, Sharawa Yönten Drak, Translator Ngok Loden Sherab, Dré Sherab Bar, Dakpo Lhajé [Gampopa], Drogön Pak-dru, and Chomden Rikpé Raldri.Th e Tradition of Monastic Discipline fr om Kashmir [B]Th e ordination lineage of the great scholar’s two disciples named PalHas continued until the present.Shakyashri, a great Kashmiri scholar known to be a magical manifesta-tion of Great Illumination, the third buddha in the future, mastered the entirety of the discourses and tantras and had visions of many wisdom deities. He physically cultivated the twelve qualities of training and was chief among all holders of monastic discipline of his time. His widespread renown was such that it was said, “Even one off ering of alms to him causes rebirth in the Heaven of the Th irty-three.” When he lived in India, Trans-lator Chal Chökyi Zangpo, Chak Drachom, and others from Tibet took full ordination in his presence.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 246TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2466/14/10 3:51:50 PM6/14/10 3:51:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 247Translator Tropu Champa Pal invited the great scholar himself to Tibet, resulting in boundless activity.

Jangchub Pal founded Gendun Gang ; and Dorjé Pal, Nyémo Tsalmik. Th eir two dis-ciples Umdzé Sönam and Könchok Gyaltsen started four groups, includ-ing Chölung and Jé-dzing , from which what became known as the four communities fl ourished.In the upper temple of Nyang-tö Gyen, Jamyang Sakya Pandita took full ordination; he transmitted [this vow lineage] widely. In particular, the vow lineages of the two named Pal have spread and fl ourished until the present within the Karma Kag yu and Sakya traditions: the omniscient Karmapas’ successive incarnations have accepted Jangchub Pal’s vow lin-eage, while Buddha Vajra Bearer Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo accepted that of Dorjé Pal. Sakya Pandit’s vow lineage later fl ourished through the activity of the great fi ft h Dalai Lama.It seems that Chölung and Jé-dzing monasteries’ vow lineages no lon-ger exist today. In general, although each vow lineage died out within each of the four communities’ monastic colleges, they were passed else-where and transmitted. Countless sublime individuals, scholars, and accomplished masters well known during Buddhism’s later propagation appeared in this vow lineage. In particular, the omniscient master of the age of dispute, Butön Rinchen Drup, and the precious lord father Lozang Drakpa [Tsongkapa] and his spiritual sons fi lled this great world with their especially exalted teachings and practice of the sacred teachings of monastic discipline.Th e Tradition of Monastic Discipline fr om Upper Tibet [C]Pala’s lineage, known as monastic discipline from upper Tibet, also appeared.Aft er Lang Darma‘s suppression of Buddhism, Tibet became [politically] fragmented. However, in upper Ngari, at a period when the Buddhist kings’ dynasty had only patches of authority, the later propagation of Buddhism began. Lha Lama Yeshé Ö invited from India Scholar Dharma-pala, who inspired many men, including three named Pala, to renounce home life and take full ordination. Among these, Prajnapala had a dis-ciple Zhang Zhung Gyalwé Sherab, who met many scholars.

Nevertheless, this lineage did produce a few outstanding scholars and accomplished masters, such as Translator Gö Zhönnu Pal and Chen-nga Chökyi Drakpa, who took full ordination within this lineage of vows.All three vow lineages belong to the substantialist order. Here in Tibet, by command of the Buddhist kings, except for the middle way view and the substantialist order of monastic conduct, no other [views or monastic orders] were authorized [to be transmitted in the country].

In the case of the doctrine of realization, one makes meditation practice on the meaning of what one has heard one’s spiritual path, cul-tivating the experience of the thirty-seven aspects of awakening in one’s own stream of being. Th is is how the doctrine of realization must be pre-served. Venerable Master Vasubandhu states:Our teacher’s doctrine has two aspects—Epitomes of scripture and realization.Th ese can be preserved only through articulating [the teachings]And through meditation practice.Th e Specifi c Teaching Traditions [B]Th is section has three parts: (1) the common way’s teaching traditions, (2) the uncommon secret mantra’s teaching traditions, and (3) teaching transmissions in brief.Th e Common Way’s Teaching Traditions [1]Th is section has four parts: the origin of teaching traditions in (1) monas-tic discipline, (2) the study of observed phenomena, (3) the perfection of sublime insight, and (4) the middle way.Th e Origin of Teaching Traditions in Monastic Discipline [a]Concerning the teaching lineage of monastic discipline,In southern India, two masters—Gunaprabha and Shakyaprabha—Six masters named Mitra, and othersWidely transmitted commentaries on the substantialist order’s system.I will fi rst describe the origin of the teaching lineage of the sacred teach-ings of monastic discipline. In the beginning in southern India, four prin-cipal orders of pious attendants existed, each of which used a diff erent TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 249TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2496/14/10 3:51:50 PM6/14/10 3:51:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"250 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgelanguage, such as Sanskrit, to encode the root text, Th e Individual Lib-eration Discourse. In turn, each had diff erent explanatory scriptures for that root text’s four sections of monastic discipline. Th ese four orders split into eighteen, and it was said that each kept its own separate root and explanatory scriptures. Here, I will describe the substantialist order’s system—the series of their four explanatory scriptures [Th e Scripture of Distinctions, Th e Minor Scripture on Monastic Discipline, Th e Basic Scrip-ture on Monastic Discipline, and Th e Highest Scripture] and the meaning of their contents—according to Serdok Panchen.Th e Scripture of Distinctions provides a commentary to the words of Th e Individual Liberation Discourse. Th e Minor Scripture on Monastic Discipline expands upon the fi ne points of training to elucidate the gen-eral meaning of Th e Individual Liberation Discourse. Th e Basic Scripture on Monastic Discipline is a supplementary text to complete anything left out. Th e Highest Scripture is crucial in that it resolves contentious issues. Treatises of explanation include Th e Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition, which is said to present the pious attendants’ own monastic discipline.Concerning monastic discipline held in common with the great way, among Vasubandhu’s four disciples more learned than himself, the one more learned in monastic discipline was a brahmin, Master Gunaprabha, who dwelled on awakening’s third stage, Luminous. He systematized what had lacked order in the four scriptures, subsuming their topics into [the monastic legal code’s] seventeen bases in his work, Th e Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline. Among his other books, he collected [the monastic community’s] activity rituals into one place in the text Karma Shatam. Th e arhat Vishakhadéva wrote Th e Continual Flower Garland; the Kash-miri Sanghabhadra wrote Th e Fift y-Verse Karika for Novices; and Master Shakyaprabha wrote the root text and commentary of Th ree Hundred Verses on Monastic Discipline, and so on. Among all of these, Gunaprabha and Shakyaprabha are widely recognized as the chief authorities.It is said that fi ve hundred disciples of Gunaprabha could recite [from memory] the one hundred thousand sections of monastic discipline. Among these men, Dharmamitra wrote An Extensive Commentary to “Th e Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline,” which became the authori-tative work on the subject everywhere in India and Tibet. Six masters named Mitra—Vimalamitra, Vishésamitra, Kalyanamitra, Géwé She-nyen, and Shilamitra—and others extensively explained and transmitted this lineage.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 250TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2506/14/10 3:51:50 PM6/14/10 3:51:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 251In this land, lineages from Danashila, Jinamitra, and Chokro Lu’i GyaltsenWere united by Zu Dorjé Gyaltsen into a single teaching line,Which gradually spread from his four disciples.Tsonapa, Gya Duldzin, Ja Duldzin, and many other especially exalted individuals appeared.Omniscient Butön Rinchen Drup received the legacy; his activity was that of a second powerful Sage.In this Himalayan land, Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen received [the teaching lin-eage of monastic discipline] from two masters from the land of exalted beings, Danashila and Jinamitra. Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung, and Rab-sal of Tsang requested it from Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen; they in turn taught Lachen Gongpa Rabsal; and the four of them taught Lumé Tsultrim Sherab, who taught Zu Dorjé Gyaltsen.

At the request of the protector Trakshé, he composed such texts as a detailed explanation of monastic discipline, Rays of Sunlight, and thereby estab-lished the foundation for the doctrine of monastic discipline.Other famous Tibetan masters of monastic discipline during Bud-dhism’s later propagation include Gyadulwa Wangchuk Tsultrim and Jadulwa Wangchuk Bar, each of whom wrote a commentary to Th e Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline and founded monastic colleges such as Zulpu.

Most Tibetans quote from Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena:Th e collection on observed phenomena is fl awless sublime insight and that which follows it.Since this is what is to be attained, there is both this [sublime insight] and its treatises.Th is quote refers to ultimate knowledge and representative knowledge. Th e fi rst [ultimate knowledge] is fl awless sublime insight that discerns phenomena’s specifi c and general characteristics, along with the fi ve psy-cho-physical aggregates. Th e second [representative knowledge] has two parts: fl awed knowledge and the treatises. First, contaminated knowledge is knowledge gained from listening, refl ection, and meditation, [that is, knowledge that] has arisen from application or which is innate. Th e sec-ond is treatises, such as the seven texts on observed phenomena.To explain those subjects, all the contents of the treatise Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena are summarized within its body’s outline into two sections—defi led affl ictive emotions and complete purity—[referred to with the words] “contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena.” How these are connected in sequence within the treatise is as follows.Phenomena that are synthesized into [two categories,] contaminated and uncontaminated, can also be summarized into psycho-physical aggregates, sense constituents, and sense bases.

[First,] the Buddha’s regent Maitreya perfectly elucidated in the scripture known as Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization the hidden meaning of the perfection of sublime insight—the stages of manifest realization. Venerable Asanga considered that this text and Th e Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in Twenty-fi ve Th ousand Verses shared the same meaning, and he composed the commentary Certainty in Relation to the Ultimate.

Consis-tent with the middle way style of expressing essenceless-ness, this master combined Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization and Th e Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in Twenty-fi ve Th ousand Verses in his com-mentary Illuminating the Twenty Th ousand Verses. Th at text marks the inception of the tradition of joining the discourses with Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization. Later, Vairochanabhadra and others wrote many commentaries blending that text with the extensive and the medium-length perfection of sublime insight texts.In particular, Master Haribhadra understood all systems of the perfec-tion of sublime insight. Lord Maitreya granted permission [for his writ-ing ]; the force of that blessing led him to compose Th e Eighth Chapter’s Concise Meaning, which blended [Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization] with the medium-length version [of the perfection of sublime insight text]; Th e Great Commentary on “Th e Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Th ousand Verses,” which blended that text with Th e Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Th ousand Verses; An Easy-to-Under-stand Commentary on “Th e Concise Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight,” which combined it with the concise version; and A Commen-tary of Clear Meaning, which integrated it with all three versions of the mother of sublime insight.Th ese elucidations in the intrinsic emptiness style constitute an excel-lent teaching system, thus all later masters who taught the perfection of sublime insight followed in their footsteps: their enlightened activity has proved to be especially exalted.Here in Tibet, the perfection of sublime insight was taught and practiced widelyDue to the kindness of Lang Khampa Gocha and Bérotsana.It is said that all teachings of the middle wheel, the cycle of the perfection of sublime insight, which existed in the land of exalted beings came here to the province of Tibet.

Based on commentaries to this book, written by the masters Buddhapalita and Bhavaviveka, the middle way grew into two schools of thought, [known as] consequentialist and independently verifi able reason. Holders of the former tradition include Chandrakirti and Shantideva; holders of the latter tradition include Jnanagarbha, Shantarakshita, and Kamalashila, known as the three eastern proponents of the independently verifi able reason school.

Such masters as Asanga, his brother [Vasubandhu], Master Chandragomi, and their followers; and Shantipa, the omniscient master of the era of dispute, taught and transmitted widely the meaning of these texts.Translator Ngok Loden Sherab and Tsen Kawoché received from SajjanaTh e teaching and practice transmissions thought to be two—the middle way and mind-only.Tsang Nakpa Tsöndru Sengé, Rangjung Dorjé, the omniscient master [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] and his spiritual children, and othersTOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 269TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2696/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"270 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeSounded a lion’s great roar of the incontrovertible meaning.In Tibet during both the early and later dissemination of Buddhism, countless discourses and treatises of commentary on the subject of the fi nal wheel [of the Buddha’s instruction] were translated. Especially dur-ing the later spread, great Translator Ngok Loden Sherab received the scriptures, commentary, and teaching on Maitreya’s four later instruc-tions from the Kashmiri Master Sajjana; he then transmitted them widely. From Translator Ngok, Trapa Ngonshé’s disciple Tsen Kawoché received Th e Highest Continuity and the other [texts of Maitreya]. Th e teaching system reached Chang Rawa and others, and continued until later times. Th e former [Ngok Loden Sherab] inherited the teaching transmission; the latter [Tsen Kawoché], the practice transmission. It is thought that two traditions gradually developed, that of those who hold the middle way view and that of those who hold the mind-only view. In later writ-ings, they both accept knowledge of emptiness—truly existent, naturally clear intrinsic awareness—as the potent cause of enlightenment. Th us states omniscient Dharmakara.From the streams of these transmissions, such masters as Scholar Tsang Nakpa Tsöndru Sengé; the second Victor, Rangjung Dorjé; the great omniscient master of Jonang [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] and his spiritual children; omniscient Drimé Özer [i.e., Longchenpa]; Minling Terchen and his brother [Dharmashri]; and Lord Tenpé Nyinjé [i.e., Chökyi Jungné], along with his followers, sounded a lion’s great roar of the incontrovertible meaning and elucidated the defi nite meaning beyond the mind-only view, the historical tradition of the great middle way.Shri Dharmapala’s collections of reasoningAre said to elucidate the fi nal wheel’s intent.In the land of exalted beings, the outstanding Master Venerable Shri Dharmapala wrote the treatise Th e Dawn of Positive Forms elucidat-ing how [Nagarjuna’s] six collections of middle way reasoning and Th e Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight in particular constitute the fi nal wheel’s intent.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 270TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2706/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 271Th us, in both India and Tibet, the source of this renowned philosophical school is Th e Highest Continuity, which states:Buddha, the teachings, the assembly, the innate constituent, awakening ,Enlightenment’s qualities, and, fi nally, activity:Th ese constitute the body of the entire treatise.In brief, they are the seven vajra points.Th e content of Th e Highest Continuity is synthesized as the ultimate vajra’s seven points.

Buddhaguhya’s tradition appeared in Tibet during the doctrine’s early spread but ceased in later times. During the later spread, only Anandagarbha’s tradition was introduced. Initially, the great Transla-tor Rinchen Zangpo went to Kashmir and relied on many masters. He received many tantras and profound instructions for meditation, and became very learned in secret mantra in general, and in yoga tantra in particular. Although most yoga tantras had already reached Tibet, [Rinchen Zangpo] made new translations consistent with the commen-taries. He also translated commentaries such as Illuminating the Absolute, a commentary to A Synthesis of the Absolute, and fi nalized them through teaching and study. He composed a text of their practical instructions, Th e Defi nite Essence, and gave [the entire transmission] to many disciples, principally his four heart-sons: Lochung Lekpé Sherab, Gungshing Tsön-dru Gyaltsen, Drapa Zhönnu Sherab, and Kyinor Jnana. Many preserved this lineage through study and teaching.Following [Rinchen Zangpo’s death in 1050], Podrang Shiwa Ö invited to Tibet Scholar Kalasha and others, who made many translations, par-ticularly the untranslated sections of Th e Glorious Original Supreme Tan-tra. Kalasha taught many disciples Th e Vajra Pinnacle Instruction Tantra. Th e supreme Master Atisha gave empowerments and pith instructions for Th e Purifi cation Tantra of Buddha All Knowing to Gomi Gomchen and others. Th ese were transmitted successively through Kyinor Jnana, Nyalpa Nyima Sherab, and others, and were spread widely.Translator Zangkar studied the yoga tantra cycle thoroughly and made a complete translation of the three chapters of the latter part of the com-mentary [Illuminating the Absolute]. He transmitted this principally to those known as Zangkar’s four sons: Nyalpa Nyima Sherab, Marpa Dorjé Yeshé, Nyentön Tsultrim Bar, and Chang Tsangpa Sengé Gyaltsen. Th is teaching system became very widespread. During an interim period, Tsakyawa Tönshak, Nur Nyima Özer (a disciple of Nyalpa Nyima Sherab), and Dzimpa Lochen were the three principal masters who upheld this tradition through their study and teaching. Further, several other systems appeared, such as a lineage transmitted from the Nepalese Master Rav-indra to Translator Mal Lodrö Drakpa, and another transmitted from Vibhutichandra to Yakdé Zémarwa.Later, these traditions almost disappeared, becoming very slender threads. Th e hundred streams of these [yoga tantra traditions] fl owed into the ocean of learning of Butön Rinchen Drup, whose karmic affi nity TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 274TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2746/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 275with the yoga tantras had fully awakened at the end of this later period.

Th ere number now just thirteen major and minor empowerments, including A Compilation of the Original Supreme Glory Tantra, A Com-pilation of the Vajra Pinnacle Tantra, and Vajra Basic Space Tantra; the reading transmission for those tantras; and the empowerments for twelve sacred circles related to or extrapolated from Th e Purifi cation Tantra of Buddha All Knowing.Within the yoga tantra tradition, there is what are known as the upper and lower traditions. In the early half of his life, the great translator [Rinchen Zangpo] followed Shakyamitra’s teaching system and Anan-dagarbha’s practical instructions. Although this occurred in the upper half of his life, this tradition is known as the lower yoga tantra tradition, because it spread toward the lowlands [i.e., eastward]. Gyalpo Chölo of upper Nyang, Sumtön of Rinpung, and Bodong Bangka Dangchung upheld this tradition.Concerning the upper tradition, later in life, the great translator fol-lowed Anandagarbha’s tradition in both teaching and practice. Although this occurred during the latter part of his life, it is known as the upper yoga tantra tradition, because it spread toward the highlands. Transla-tor Mal Lodrö Drakpa passed it to the great Sakya lama [Sachen Kunga Nyingpo], allowing it to continue as an oral lineage. Supreme Lord Drakpa Gyaltsen, fearful that the lineage would disappear because dis-ciples of future generations would have weak intellects and memories, and would be unable to preserve an orally transmitted lineage, wrote such texts as Th e Benefi t of Others Trilog y. Th e gradual dissemination of his works has ensured that the practical instructions of Th e Purifi cation Tantra of Buddha All Knowing has spread widely throughout all schools to the present time.Th e History of Teaching of the Highest Yoga Tantras [iii]Th is section has two parts: the history of teaching of (1) father tantras and (2) mother tantras.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 275TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2756/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"276 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e History of Teaching of Father Tantras [aa]Th is section has three parts: the history of teaching of (1) the tantras of the desire family, (2) the tantras of the anger family, and (3) the tantras of the stupidity family.Th e Tantras of the Desire Family [1']It is said that there were twenty-four traditions of Matrix of Mystery.As many as twenty-four traditions of the highest yoga father tantra, Matrix of Mystery, were said to have arisen in India. Th ese include those of the supreme Master Padmavajra, Anangavajra, Nagarjuna, Lalitavajra, Vajrahasa, Trikandhendra, Madhuraghoshapala, Buddhajnana, Shantipa, and Anandagarbha. Among them, the last is considered incorrect since, although based upon commentaries by an Indian scholar, it elucidates what is defi nitely a highest yoga tantra as a yoga tantra.Among just the six traditions to appear in Tibet,Th e principal two are those of the exalted master [Nagarjuna] and Venerable Buddhajnana.Among those [twenty-four] traditions, six appeared here in Tibet: tra-ditions from the exalted master [Nagarjuna], Venerable Buddhajnana, Shantipa, Vajrahasa, Padmavajra, and Anandagarbha.During Buddhism’s early spread in Tibet, [a translator] named Ché Tashi translated this tantra, and it was known among the eighteen major tantras as Th e Matrix of Mystery Mind Tantra. Teachings that elucidated it appeared, as the appearance of Vajrahasa’s tradition illustrates. Never-theless, the empowerments, teaching systems, and pith instructions of the later [four traditions on the list] were not disseminated for long.

He thoroughly mastered their empowerments, teachings, and so on. Later, many Tibetan translators studied Matrix of Mystery in India, made various translations of it, and taught them. Th e most renowned of these are two traditions, those of Marpa Chökyi Lodrö and Gö Kukpa Lhétsé.Translator Marpa Chökyi Lodrö received the Matrix of Mystery cycle from masters Naropa, Jnanagarbha, and others. He taught this to his disciples in Tibet; among his foremost disciples—the “four pillars”—he particularly transmitted the complete Matrix of Mystery cycle to Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé, who passed it in turn to Khampa Ronyam Dorjé, who had started a journey to India to obtain Matrix of Mystery teachings. En route, he met two Indians who were on their way to receive Matrix of Mystery from Marpa Chökyi Lodrö; Ronyam Dorjé decided to return. Since Marpa had already passed away, Khampa Ronyam Dorjé received Matrix of Mystery, etc., from Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé. Th is proximate lineage from Khampa Ronyam Dorjé became known as Marpa Chökyi Lodrö’s tradition.On the subject of Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s tradition, the great Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé received Matrix of Mystery empowerments, tantras, commentaries, and pith instructions from seventy scholars, including the supreme Master Dipamkara, Dévakarachandra, and Viryabhadra, and from two dakinis. In Tibet, he made excellent corrections and revisions of the earlier period’s translations of Th e Matrix of Mystery Tantra and its major and minor commentaries. He gave extensive Matrix of Mystery teachings to his disciples. Among his disciples were four who planted the tantra’s pillars, eight who raised the pith instructions’ beams, and innu-merable ones who set the raft ers—skill in minor activities and enlight-ened activity.

Th is is known as Atisha’s tradition. Chak Chöje Pal relied on Pandit Ravindra and others, and received Matrix of Mystery teachings. He taught it to his disciples, includ-ing Uyuk Kung-rab Lama Pal. Th at proximate lineage is known as Chak Chöjé Pal’s tradition.Scholar [Shakyashri] from Kashmir taught Matrix of Mystery to Sakya Pandit, Chal Chökyi Zangpo, and others. Th is is known as Panchen’s tra-dition. Th at lineage from Sakya Pandit divided into two, the Sakya tradi-tion and the Chak tradition. Th us, we count six traditions of Matrix of Mystery [from Nagarjuna]. Further, there are various lineages that have slightly diff ering teaching systems.Concerning the latter tradition that originated from Buddhajnana, great Translator Rinchen Zangpo fi rst passed it to Kyangpo Chökyi Lodrö and others. Smriti Jnana also taught it in Kham [eastern Tibet]. Th erefore, it is known as the Kham tradition. Th e lineage of these teach-ings from Scholar Sunayashri and Translator Nyen became prevalent among the Sakyapas; thus it is known as the Sakya tradition. Ra Chörab received Matrix of Mystery from Scholar Punyéshri and others, and then spread it; thus, it is known as Ra’s tradition. Nyö Jungpo relied upon Ba-ling Acharya and received Matrix of Mystery; thus his lineage is known as the Nyö tradition. Th ese and other traditions arose.In these two traditions [of Matrix of Mystery from Nagarjuna and Buddhajnana], there seems to have been in Tibet a very great number of writers of such works as commentaries, practice texts, rituals of the sacred circle, and pith instructions.Th e supreme traditions are Marpa Chökyi Lodrö’s and Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s transmissions of practice and teaching.Marpa’s teaching line fl owed through Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé.Gö’s tradition continued through the pillars, beams, raft ers, etc.;It reached the second omniscient one, Butön Rinchen Drup.Among those traditions, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö’s and Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s traditions reign supreme.

Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s teaching system passed through his dis-ciples, including the tantras’ “four pillars.” Th ese traditions of teaching were united by omniscient master Chöku Özer (a rebirth of Kashmiri Scholar [Shakyashri]), who could comprehend any treatise by merely reading it. He gave these teachings to Pakpa Ö, a master of Nagarjuna’s [work], yoga tantra, and Wheel of Time. From him, the precious master Butön Rinchen Drup received [the transmission of Matrix of Mystery], became greatly learned in it, and composed texts, such as Th e Major Com-mentary: A Clear Lamp. Butön Rinchen Drup’s disciple, Kyung Lhépa Zhönnu Sönam, taught the supreme Lord Lozang Drakpa [Tsongkapa] whose teaching of Matrix of Mystery covered the entire earth. Matrix of Mystery All-Seeing One is Lord Atisha’s personal tradition he gave Lhatsun Jangchub Ö. A minor tradition, only its empowerment remains today.Only the doctrinal empowerments and the tantras’ reading transmis-sions in both traditions of Matrix of Mystery are widespread in every [school].

Within the Géden tradition, a teaching system continues uninterrupted that proclaims a fourfold interweaving of the root tantra, Th e Major Commentary: A Clear Lamp, interlinear notes, and a concluding analysis.It is said that Lord Marpa had seven teaching systems for Matrix of Mystery, but their streams disappeared in later times.Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé received many textual teaching traditions based on the scriptures of Nagarjuna’s fi vefold cycle of Matrix of Mystery. Among them, he emphasized three traditions—from Abhijna, a scholar from Bengal; Dévikara (known in Tibetan as Tsunmo Chen), a scholar from Sahor; and Krishna-samaya-vajra, a scholar from Vajra Seat. From among these three, he took Krishna-samaya-vajra’s tradition as the basis of his teachings.Th e Matrix of Mystery TantraTh at system (the view of the father exalted Master [Nagarjuna] and his spiritual heirs) considers that the teachings in the great sovereign Matrix TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 279TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2796/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"280 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeof Mystery tantra have two aspects: those determined by its true sub-stance and those determined by specifi c circumstances.Concerning the fi rst [the teaching of the true substance of the tantra], the meaning presented in such lines [from the tantra] as, “Non-medita-tion within insubstantiality” is that of the inexpressible and indescribable abiding nature of nondual [relative and ultimate] truth.Concerning the second [the teaching based on specifi c circumstances], the tantra can be synthesized under three categories: the tantra’s subject matter, its means of expression, and the relation between those two.First, [the tantra’s subject:] Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s Th e Great Teaching Session states:Th e individual, the support which enters the tantra, purifi es these ordinary appearances of natural phenomena, which con-stitute the basis of purifi cation. What must be relinquished are the seeds of the three kinds of thoughts present in the in-dividual’s own mind stream. To eliminate them, the individual focuses on the focal point—the sixth Buddha Great Vajra Bearer—then cultivates experience on the two paths: the path of maturation and the path of liberation. Th us, the individual attains temporary and ultimate results. Th ese points comprise the subject matter of Matrix of Mystery.As stated, this tantra’s subject matter has six points: (1) the individual, the support which enters the tantra; (2) natural phenomena, the basis of purifi cation, which the individual must know and transform; (3) what must be relinquished, confl ictual impurities encountered on the path; (4) the focal point; (5) techniques of experiential cultivation; and (6) the results gained from perfecting experiential cultivation.(1) First, there are two kinds of individuals: those to be rejected—non-Buddhists who view the self [as existent]; and those to be accepted—Buddhists, proponents of the absence of a self. Th is latter group comprises those of the lesser way, pious attendants and solitary sages; and those of the great way, those free from desire and those with desire. Th e fi rst three [pious attendants, solitary sages, and those without desire] are not true vessels for this tantra, yet since this tantra synthesizes all approaches to the teachings, the text’s words mention them.Th ere are two kinds of individuals with desire: those with the affl ictive TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 280TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2806/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 281emotion of desire and those with desire for the antidotes.

Th ere are four kinds of desire for the antidotes: devotion, compassion, faith, and wisdom, which are, respectively, desire toward the spiritual mas-ter, sentient beings, the wisdom deity, and the nature of reality. Further, among those of the lowest degree of acumen, who delight in knowledge, and those with the highest degree of acumen, who delight in methods, it is taught that the latter are worthy vessels for this tantra.Th ese subjects [related to individuals who enter this tantra] are synthe-sized under [four headings]: the individual’s essence; concise and detailed classifi cations of the individual; characteristics [of the individual] in gen-eral, in specifi c cases, and of worthy recipients [for the teachings]; and the reasoning of the literal defi nition [of the individual].(2) Second, the basis of purifi cation has two parts: birth, the basis of purifi cation of relative truth; and death, the basis of purifi cation of ulti-mate truth. Th e former comprises two supreme victors—the sacred resi-dence and the sacred residents. Th e latter entails application to each of the fi ve stages’ bases of purifi cation.(3) Th ird, impurities encountered on the path has three parts: strong defi lements, unbridled thoughts of material phenomena as ordinary; subtle defi lements, active dualistic thoughts; and very subtle defi lements, concepts of the very essence of material substance. Each of these has two kinds of remedies: a weaker remedy that purifi es coarse defi lements to be relinquished, and a strong remedy that purifi es subtle defi lements to be relinquished.(4) Fourth, the focal point is the supreme Buddha Vajra Bearer, the state of union beyond training , [the buddha] replete with seven features, and epitome of enlightenment’s three bodies, the three times, three Bud-dhist ways, three sacred circles, and three truths.(5) Fift h, the techniques of experiential cultivation has two parts: (1) the path of maturation [i.e., empowerment] that ripens those whose mind streams are immature and that makes individuals worthy vessels for the achievement of the three kinds of accomplishment; and (2) the path of liberation [i.e., instruction in meditation practice] that frees those not liberated from the three concepts.Th e fi rst has three parts: the preliminary practice of approach, the master’s entry [into the sacred circle], and the disciples’ entry.

Th e latter is of two kinds: that which is free from desire, the vast activity of the transcendent perfections; and that which has desire, the profound conduct of secret mantra. On the subject of secret mantra conduct, this is taught in general in relation to the four tantras’ methods; in this case, the conduct of the fi nal class of tantra, supreme yoga, takes two specifi c forms: a lord’s conduct and secret mantra conduct. Th ese are known respectively as “the conduct of total victory,” and “the conduct of the young king” (or “the conduct of the illustrious regent”). Th e latter conduct has two kinds: the common con-duct of training based on engagement in desire, and the conduct of the tantric discipline of awareness. Each of these is presented in three modes: elaborate, simple, and very simple.Th e elaborate conduct of the discipline of awareness has fi ve aspects: practices of the number of seals; two categories of the inner propensity and those who have that propensity; characteristics; time; and attributes. Th e simple conduct of the discipline of awareness has fi ve aspects: union with the wisdom mudra [consort], which is the conduct of desire for the diligent to achieve enlightenment within their lifetime; the conduct of blending with death for the lazy, the primary cause for enlightenment during the interval between death and rebirth; the conduct of blend-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 282TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2826/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 283ing with sleep for those who have obstacles, the primary cause for their enlightenment aft er a succession of lifetimes; the conduct of Shakya-muni’s way to enlightenment, beginning the spiritual path with the way of philosophical systems and concluding the path with the secret mantra way (the former brings attainment of awakening’s ten stages; the latter, bestowal of the three higher empowerments in the highest pure land and attainment of enlightenment); and the conduct that seals the fi rst three forms of conduct—[realization of ] the absence of a self of phenomena and the conduct of union. Th e rituals for elaborate and simple conduct include the place, implements, and how to practice the forms of conduct. Th e special characteristics of the individuals who engage in these forms of conduct are presented as ancillary subjects.Settling in evenness has two aspects: the preliminary to the prac-tice, how to train in the motivation of the Buddha’s way; and the actual practice. Th e latter has two parts: (1) creation phase meditation, which indirectly makes wisdom arise, and (2) completion phase, which directly makes wisdom arise.(1) Creation phase meditation is synthesized in two parts. Th e fi rst is the basis of purifi cation, the authentic creation phase, which is presented through three subjects: its essence, classifi cation, and the reasoning of its literal meaning. [Th e second part of creation phase meditation] is puri-fi cation, the nominal creation phase, which is made up of two aspects: approach and practice. Approach, which pleases the wisdom deities, has two aspects: single-pointed mindfulness, which is training in single-minded concentration on coarse [phenomena] using familiarity with the deities’ substantial [appearances]; and conceptual contemplative practice, attachment to and conceptualization of very subtle phenomena.Th e former, single-pointed mindfulness, has two categories: [medita-tion on] the sacred circle’s wheel and on the spiritual warrior alone. Each of these has a support, the celestial palace; and contents, wisdom deities. Or, [they can be treated separately,] with the wheel of the sacred circle as the subject of meditation—[Matrix of Mystery’s] thirty-two deities. Th e principal deity upon which the buddha-family fl ower landed [during the empowerment] moves [to the center; that confi guration] is counted [as a whole circle of thirty-two]. Further, each deity has both a pledge and wisdom aspect; counted together, there are ninety-six “applications.” [Second,] for [meditation on] the spiritual warrior alone, individuals with the highest degree of acumen create the deity’s presence using four TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 283TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2836/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"284 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgecontemplative practices.

Th ose with a lesser degree of acumen create the deity using [a ritual comprising ] the four vajras. Each has a sacred circle of thirty-two deities, with one that moves to become the principal deity, thus ninety-six “applications.” Th e techniques for their experiential cul-tivation can be synthesized into two: the preliminary practices and the main practice.Second, conceptual contemplative practice has two aspects: inner absorption, taught for those with a high degree of acumen, who delight in meditation; and absorption in mantra [recitation], taught for those of a low degree of acumen, who delight in mantra recitation. In the fi rst, there are two aspects, the upper gate and the lower gate, applied as antidotes for the elements, affl ictive emotions, and constituents of sickness. In these practices, one trains in the meditative state of the fi ve certainties. Th e second [absorption in mantra recitation] has two kinds: counting recita-tions of the three syllables or mantra garlands, for those who delight in either concise [the fi rst] or lengthy practices [the latter]. [In either case,] burnt off erings supplement the recitations. Each of these former and lat-ter four categories [two aspects of inner absorption and two aspects of mantra recitation absorption] has thirty-two deities, as before [in the description of single-pointed mindfulness]; thus, a total of one hundred and twenty-eight “applications.”In a beginner’s absorption to practice for desired accomplishments, the preliminary practices entail six months of engagement in the con-duct of the discipline of awareness. Th e actual practice has two parts: practice for worldly accomplishment—the four activities [listed below]; and practice for common accomplishment—the eight supreme attain-ments. First, [the four activities are] concentration produced by the phase of creation; concentration produced by the phase of completion; mantra and text recitations endowed with eight distinctive features; and four devices endowed with four special absorptions: burnt off erings, yantra substances, mantras, and tantra. Each of these four has thirty-two catego-ries of practitioners, making a hundred and twenty-eight categories. It is also taught that each of the four activities has many subdivisions in terms of the aims of the practice.[Second,] in relation to common accomplishments, the root tantra lists six, whereas the explanatory tantra lists eight.

Th e last three have no subdivisions.(2) Th e phase of completion has two parts. [First,] three topics—the essence, classifi cation, and etymolog y—present the authentic comple-tion phase, the basis of purifi cation. [Second,] the nominal completion phase, the agent of purifi cation, comprises the six aspects of approach and accomplishment—fi ve stages of approach, and accomplishment of union.First, among the fi ve stages of approach—three facets of solitude, illu-sory body, and clear light—the fi rst is physical solitude, which has nine topics: the individual, who is the support; the essence of physical soli-tude; etymolog y; what must be known; defi lements to be relinquished; the classifi cation of physical solitude into form, nature, consciousness, and meditative states (these constitute the basis of solitude synthesized into its subjects); techniques of experiential cultivation; evaluation of signs; and the results of having cultivated the experience.Second, vocal solitude is presented like physical solitude, in nine top-ics: basis, essence, etc. Th ere are three categories: the ultimate nature of circulating energ y, the basis; the ultimate nature of sound, its content; and the ultimate nature of the root of those two, the sound to be known. Th e fi rst [the ultimate nature of circulating energ y] has thirteen aspects: essence, etymolog y, outer and inner categories, function, source, gateways of movement, individual names, colors, sequence, enumeration, methods of training , evaluation of signs, and results. Second, [the ultimate nature of sound] has three general topics: mantras of the continuity of the cause, mantras of the continuity of techniques, and mantras of the continuity of the result. Each of these is presented in four topics: essence, etymolog y, categories, and their functions in the wheel of life and transcendence. Specifi cally, in the case of the mantras of the continuity of techniques, to those four topics the following are added: a full classifi cation of terms, how mantras multiply, the mantras’ meanings, the mantras’ symbolism, accumulation of mantras, techniques of recitation, counting mantras, TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 285TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2856/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"286 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeevaluation of signs, and results.

[Mental solitude] can also be presented in fi ve topics: the support; what must be known; what must be relinquished; categories, with the characteristics of each; and etymolog y.Fourth, illusory body has seventeen topics: basis; essence; etymolog y; categories of pure and impure [illusory body]; causes and consequences; causes and conditions; how illusory body is attained; the gradual path that makes one a [worthy] vessel; the faults of lacking attainment and the qualities of attainment; the pervasion of things and actions; what must be relinquished; what must be known; enumeration of terms; illustrative examples; techniques of experiential cultivation; evaluation of signs; and results.Fift h, clear light has eighteen topics: the support; essence; etymolog y; categories such as the eighteen degrees of emptiness, or outer and inner manifest awakening ; stages that make one a [worthy] vessel; what must be known; what must be relinquished, antidotes and manifest awaken-ing ; methods of practice and meditative concentration; enumeration of terms; how clear light pervades; causes and consequences; categories; characteristics; engagement and reversal; classifi cation of pith instruc-tions; meditation; evaluation of signs; and results.[Sixth,] the contemplative practice of union has twelve topics: the individual who is the support; essence; etymolog y; categories of [stages of ] learning and beyond learning ; how to rise from clear light; enumera-tion of terms; characteristics; causes and conditions of accomplishment; what must be known; techniques for experiential cultivation; evaluation of signs; and results.

Th ese are categorized as twenty-four: common accomplishments are the eight great activities and the eight feats; supreme accomplish-ments are the eight qualities of union.Th at concludes the presentation of this tantra’s subject matter. Second, the means of expression, the verbal tantra, is presented by means of the six parameters and the four modes.Both provisional meanings and defi nitive meanings are based on the limits of meaning : the same words can present both an obvious and an obscure meaning. Implicit and explicit meanings are based on the limits of words: words of both provisional and defi nitive meanings can present the same defi nite meaning. Literal and non-literal meanings are based in both limits of [meanings and words], since two [diff erent] words can present the same meaning, and the same word can have two meanings.Provisional meaning can conclusively present only the creation phase; defi nitive meaning can conclusively present only the completion phase. Implicit teachings mostly present the completion phase, yet [some] pres-ent the creation phase. Th e contrary is the case for teachings of explicit meaning. Non-literal meaning mostly presents the completion phase, yet in some cases it teaches the creation phase. Th e contrary is the case for the literal meaning. If two meanings are understood from one word, there is defi nitely a provisional and a defi nitive meaning. If there is an inapposite word in whichever of the two phases are taught, this is an explanation with an implicit meaning. Th e contrary case [i.e., no inapposite words] is an explicit explanation. Likewise, if there is just a symbolic explana-tion, the words will have a non-literal meaning. If the explanation can be understood by everyone, learned and unlearned, the words are to be understood literally.Teaching using the four modes is explained in detail below [in Systems TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 287TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2876/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"288 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeof Buddhist Tantra, pp. 287–290]. In brief, one word [in a tantra] can have four meanings: Th e fi rst two meanings are taught on the basis of the words themselves: the semantic meaning and the general meaning. Th e hidden meaning and the ultimate meaning are taught based on the [tantra’s] meaning. All ten (the six limits and four modes) are taught in two contexts, public lectures and teaching to disciples.Th ird is the relation between the tantra’s subject matter and its means of expression, the connection between the subject matter’s six topics and the twelve means of expression by which they are taught. For example, in the tantra’s fi rst topic, the four kinds of individual who are the support (such as an individual like sandalwood, [or like a blue lotus, or a white lotus, or a red lotus]) are taught using the provisional meaning and a semantic mode of explanation. A jewel-like individual is taught using the defi nitive meaning and the ultimate mode of explanation. Th e provisional mean-ing, and semantic and general modes of explanation, are used to present the phase of creation’s basis of purifi cation (the defi lements of thoughts of things as ordinary); the phase of creation’s focus; the vase empower-ment; the phase of creation’s path; the fi rst half of physical solitude; and the worldly and common accomplishments. Th e defi nitive meaning and the hidden and ultimate modes of explanation are used to present the phase of completion’s basis of purifi cation, active dualistic thoughts; the phase of completion’s focus; the higher three empowerments; the phase of completion’s six stages; and sublime accomplishment. Th e four [of the six limits not explained here], such as implicit and explicit meaning, are taught related to all six points of the subject matter.In brief, the subject, the ultimate Matrix of Mystery, is as stated here:I have taught the mystery in three aspects:Wisdom body, wisdom speech, and wisdom mind.Th e assembly, expressed as a matrix,Is a synonym for all buddhas.Th us, all buddhas’ ultimate wisdom body, speech, and mind are the mys-tery, since they are secret to those not endowed with outstanding fortune, such as pious attendants, solitary sages, and even followers of the great way. Th is is not a Buddha related to a limited realm and set of disciples, but one who epitomizes all buddhas’ assembly or matrix, a body of inte-gral union, known as supreme Buddha Vajra Bearer or “the one who is TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 288TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2886/14/10 3:51:51 PM6/14/10 3:51:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 289all buddhas.” It is taught, “Th is is the place of the ultimate. Th erefore, its means of expression, the verbal Matrix of Mystery [tantra], is the crown of all tantras.”It is thought that even the bodhisattvas’ commentaries on the Wheel of Time [tantra] present Matrix of Mystery’s meaning, the tantras of Vajra of Delight are oriented toward Matrix of Mystery, and the Wheel of Supreme Bliss [tantras] elucidate Matrix of Mystery’s ultimate nature.Th e Tantras of the Anger Family [2']Slayer of the Lord of Death spans fi ve time periods:Desired Accomplishment, Various Forms of Conduct,Harmful, Defi nite Engagement, and Partial Engagement.Slayer of the Lord of Death’s cycle of teachings appeared in India dur-ing fi ve successive time periods. Not long aft er the canon’s third compila-tion, the secret mantra tantras of Slayer of the Lord of Death spread: that period of two hundred years constitutes the fi rst time period, Desired Accomplishment. Groups of many thousands of followers reached great seal’s sublime accomplishment.Th e second time period, Accomplishment of Various Forms of Con-duct, lasted three hundred years. All without a single exception who entered this sacred circle achieved their goal. Further, very many reached sublime accomplishment. Th e third period, Harmful, lasted over fi ve hundred years. Although many attained accomplishment, this was the era of Brahmin Chanaka and others, who primarily used their powers to enact overt conduct of wrathful activity. During the fourth period (from Master Lalitavajra until Kamalarakshita), Defi nite Engagement, [persons] defi nitely engaged in and mastered the creation phase and its activity.Th e fi ft h time period, Partial Engagement, continues until the present day.

Most of the root and explanatory tantras’ empowerments, reading transmissions, and teaching doctrines reached Tibet. A large proportion of Indian accomplished masters gained accomplishment in this tantra. Th erefore, in general, traditions of Supreme Bliss were very numerous. Nevertheless, three traditions—from Luyipa, Vajraghantapa, and Krishnacharya—predominated, as renowned as the sun and moon. Further, there were traditions from Darikapa, Dengipa, Indrabhuti the lesser, the Sri Lankan Jinabhadra, Durjayachandra, the eastern Lavapa ([also known as] Sunyata-samadhi), the fi rst part of Vajra Holder’s com-mentary, Bhavabhadra, and Brahmin Ratnavajra. Th ese were indepen-dent traditions based upon the root tantra of Supreme Bliss; they have been translated into Tibetan.Th ere were an additional fi ft een independent traditions developed in India by fi ft een great accomplished masters: the accomplished Master Luyang Ken, Krishnavajra (a style in which the deity has an extended left leg ), Kalahamsakumara, Dharmapa (a style in which all the deities are black), Kukkutipa (a style in which all the deities have animal heads), Ghundaripa (a style in which the male and female consorts have the same color, and all other deities have no defi nite color), Chatipa, Nadipa, Ghandhatapa, Vinapa (a style in which all deities have two arms), Tan-tapa, Bhadepa, Tadakapa, Kamkalapa, and Jayanandipa (a style in which all the deities are yellow). Further, the tradition of Master Bodhivajra, whose life was foretold in Th e Latter Tantra of the Wheel of Time, did not spread for long in India but continues in Dravida until the present day.Th e explanatory tantras [of Supreme Bliss] present many sacred circles.

Translator Mal himself relied upon many masters, including the Pamting brothers, and became profi cient in the Supreme Bliss cycle. When Sachen Kunga Nyingpo and others received these teachings from him, they spread widely among the Sakya father and sons, and through their lineage.Translator Marpa Chökyi Lodrö received the highest, defi nitive, secret teachings of the Supreme Bliss cycle from Naropa and later taught them to his disciples in Tibet. It appears that many special systems of empow-erment and instructions were transmitted through the Marpa and Mila-repa doctrinal lineages. In particular, Marpa Dopa Chökyi Wangchuk relied upon many teachers, including Naropa’s disciple Manakashri, and received Naropa’s tradition of the empowerments, tantras, teaching sys-tem, and pith instructions for Supreme Bliss. He also translated many parts of the Supreme Bliss cycle and had many disciples in Tibet.Various lineages appeared, which include those of Puhrang Lochung and Translator Nyö Jungpo, who received instruction from the three Pamting brothers and other masters. In particular, the lineages that passed through Puhrang Lochung had an excellent teaching system that lasted a long time. Lord Atisha gave Supreme Bliss to great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, Rongpo Gargé, and others. Th e latter passed this to Yakdé Zémarwa, from whom a tradition of explanatory teachings, etc., TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 296TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 2966/14/10 3:51:52 PM6/14/10 3:51:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 297arose.

Th e doctrines of its empowerments and teaching system, etc., spread widely in Tibet.Among the various other empowerment doctrines and teaching doc-trines related to other explanatory tantras, the most exalted was that of Marpa Dopa Chökyi Wangchuk. His disciples, including the Tsang scholar Gyanam Dozepa Loden, perfectly preserved his lineage of teach-ings: the stream of its teaching and practice diff used throughout all schools. Among those lineages, Butön Rinpoché composed commentar-ies to the root tantra and Th e Tantra of Yoginis’ Conduct: his teaching system continues within the Gédenpa order to this day. Over twenty minor lineage empowerments, instruction in the Luyipa, Vajraghantapa, and Krishnacharya traditions, and many kinds of creation and comple-tion phase meditations of the female consort’s [Vajra Yogini] doctrine continue to exist.Explanation of the Tantra of Supreme BlissTh is king of tantras of supreme contemplative practice brings accom-plishment by having been read; it constitutes a marvelous rite for accom-plishment. To explain this primordially existent great tantra, Lord Jampal Nyingpo’s teaching system in Th e Complete Illumination of the Hidden Meaning provides a wonderful, brilliant analysis of the profound sub-jects of the discourses and tantras without relying on others’ work. He presents a preliminary outline of the Buddha’s word in general and then introduces the specifi c tantra of Supreme Bliss. Within that, he begins the main explanation of Th e Short Root Tantra of Supreme Bliss with a synthesis in three parts: the pith instructions used for the teaching, how the teaching is given, and the actual teaching.First [the pith instructions used for the teaching ], the tantras can be taught using other tantras [as models], using the bodhisattvas’ commen-taries, or based upon spiritual masters’ pith instructions.

He opened a previously unknown door to a treasure of profound, eloquent teachings based on the power of his wisdom and realization of the threefold explanation described above, the oral trans-mission from great Indian accomplished masters, and his discernment of secret subjects.Taranata’s explanation of the tantras of Supreme Bliss is synthesized in two parts: its subject matter, the tantra’s meaning , presented as the binding of manifest realization; and its means of expression, the tantra’s words, elucidated in terms of provisional and defi nitive meanings.

In later times, the transmission to Taklungpa is the Jnana tradition of Vajra of Delight; the transmission to all-knowing lord Taranata is the Shantigupta tradition.Among the many traditions (of which these are the main ones), the most exalted are those whose streams of empowerments, teachings, pith instructions, and experiential cultivation have not disappeared: the lin-eage from Translator Marpa Chökyi Lodrö to Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, and Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé; and the lineage from Translator Drokmi Shakya Yeshé to the Sakyapa lineage holders.

Lord Marpa received [Mahamaya] from Shantibhadra; from those empowerments and teachings, along with pith instructions, the great lord of Jonang [Taranata] composed instructions for the empowerments, and commentaries to the tantra, for which only the instruction through reading transmission remains.Th ere were two Indian traditions of the family of permanence deity, Four Seats: Aryadeva’s tradition based upon the root tantra, and Master Bhavabhadra’s tradition based upon the concise tantra. In Tibet, there were Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s tradition, from Scholar Smriti Jnana’s own cycle of translations; and Gayadhara’s and Drokmi Pönlop’s [i.e., Drokmi Shakya Yeshé’s] teachings and translations.

Th e texts Master Kalachakrapada the Elder, Manjuvajra, Master Chilupa, and Pito Acharya each brought to India from Shambhala dif-fered [only] in having one or two more, or less, verses.In Tibet, initially Scholar Shri Bhadrabodhi and Translator Gyijo Dawé Özer translated the tantra and its commentary. Th e lineage of masters to whom they entrusted the empowerments, teachings, and pith instruc-tions, including Translator Trom, is known as the Jo tradition. Tsami Sang yé Drak received the teachings from Kalachakrapada and translated the major commentary. He taught this to his disciples, including Transla-tor Ga Namg yal Dorjé; this is the Tsami tradition.

Th e lord precious master [Tsongkapa] received these teachings from a disciple of Butön Rinpoché, Gangsumpa Déchen Chökyi Palwa. Tsongkapa transmitted these teachings only once. At that time, countless persons who preserved the collections of the Buddha’s teachings gathered to receive them. Th ree among these masters wrote major commentaries, one of whom was Kédrup Gélek Palwa [i.e., Kédrup Jé]. Zhang Zhungpa Chöwang Drakpa added a supplementary postface to Kédrup Jé’s commentary, from which a stream of teaching continues to the present day. All the doctrinal empowerments and profound and vast pith instructions of both the Jonang and Zhalu lineages continue as unbroken transmissions.Explanation of Wheel of Time TantraIn teaching this sovereign of tantras, three subjects provide a general pre-sentation: the meaning of what must be taught, the words used in teach-ing, and how the teaching is given. Th is last has two parts: the branches of the teaching method and the act of teaching. Th e fi rst [the branches of the teaching method] has four parts: how the teacher, the Buddha, appeared; how the Buddha taught the Buddhist ways in general and the Wheel of Time specifi cally; the story of the source of the lineage; and how it is taught and learned. Th e second [the act of teaching ] has three parts: the master who teaches, the disciple who listens, and how the teaching is given and received.Following that preliminary [general presentation], the main part of the tantra’s major commentary, the words used in the teaching, has fi ve parts—the fi ve chapters on the purity of all phenomena.

Th e fi rst six present teachings that cover the tantra in general; the remaining four teach what is covered, the tantra’s meaning as the external Wheel of Time. Chapter Two, “Inner Certainty,” teaches the inner Wheel of Time through seven summaries, the pure seven elements—the four elements [earth, fi re, water, air], the sun, the moon, and Rahu. Chapter Th ree, “Empowerment,” teaches six summaries, the pure essence of the six sense constituents as the six wisdom families’ chief buddhas. Chapter Four, “Th e Means of Practice,” teaches fi ve summaries, the pure aspect of the fi ve families’ chief buddhas. Chapter Five, “Wisdom,” teaches four major summaries, the pure aspect of the four vajras. Among these, summaries from the third chapter teach the alternative Wheel of Time as the nature of suchness. Th e fi nal summary teaches in full detail the purifi cation of the buddhas’ realms, acts for beings’ benefi t, and the conclusion, prayers of dedication and aspiration.In relation to the [eighty-one] points [“the pure signs of physical per-fection”], Chapter One has twenty-four points—the pure aspects of the twelve links of interdependent causation in unfolding and reverse sequences. Chapter Two has eighteen points: the pure aspects of the six senses, six sense objects, and six natures. Chapter Th ree has twelve points: the pure aspects of the twelve empowerments of entering as a child. Chap-ter Four has seven points: the pure aspects of the seven birthplaces. Chap-ter Five has twenty points: the twenty aspects that illustrate awakening.As to the meaning of “summaries,” just as many small measures are con-tained in a larger measure, these summaries contain many confl uences of words and meanings. As to “points,” just as a large measure contains many small measures, these points contain various separate words and meanings. In brief, the outer, inner, and alternative Wheels of Time are summarized as the subjects to be presented, then taught.Th e History of Teaching the Tantras of the Early Translations [b]Th e early translations’ teaching tradition continues to the present day.Th e Vajrasattva Net of Illusion Tantra is the root tantra.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 308TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3086/14/10 3:51:52 PM6/14/10 3:51:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 309It stands above the crown of the head of all tantras like a victory banner.In the early translations of the Ancient secret mantra way, due to the kind-ness of the great reincarnate translators and scholars of Buddhism’s ear-lier spread in Tibet, when Lord Atisha inspected the Indian texts stored in Samyé Monastery, he saw many tantras he had never heard of before. In praise, he remarked, “It seems as if secret mantra’s doctrines have not fl ourished even in India as they have in Tibet.” As that story indicates, countless empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions appeared [during the early period]. Nevertheless, secret mantra was zealously kept secret during that time: monastic colleges stressed the way of philosophi-cal systems, while meditation centers emphasized the secret mantra way. Th erefore, it seems that no college curriculums included [any tantras] apart from a few outer tantras, and none of the three inner tantras. From that period until the present day, the doctrines of empowerments and teachings have continued uninterrupted.Vajrasattva’s Net of Illusion, the Secret Essence, the Sovereign Tantra of Defi nite Suchness constitutes the eighteen great tantras’ root or general meaning. Many special qualities make it exalted like a victory banner above the crown of the head of all tantras.Lalitavajra, Shri Singhaprabha, and Buddhaguhya explained this tantra.Vimalamitra, Ma Rinchen Chok, and Nyak Jnana Kumara translated and taught it.Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo, Longchenpa, Chomden Rikpé Raldri, and others spread it.Zurpa’s especially exalted doctrinal tradition dwindled to become a slender hair.Th e brothers of Mindrol Ling Monastery revived the doctrine’s dying embers.Th e lineage of these sovereign tantras [that make up the cycle of Th e Secret Essence Tantra] passed from King Ja to his daughter [Princess Gomadevi] and Kukuraja, and from them to Lalitavajra and Buddhaguhya. Th e former composed the commentary Th e Precious Design; the latter, An Explanation of Categories.

Ma Rinchen Chok translated the tan-tra into Tibetan. Further, great Master [Padmasambhava] passed this teaching to Nyak Jnana Kumara, who taught it to Sokpo Palg yi Yeshé, who taught Nupchen Sang yé Yeshé. In eastern Tibet, Ma Rinchen Chok taught Tsukru Rinchen Zhönnu and Gyéré Chok-kyong. Th ose two taught Darjé Paldrak and Zhang Gyalwé Yönten. Zhang Gyalwé Yönten taught Nupchen Sang yé Yeshé.

Th e transmission derived from Nupchen Sang yé Yeshé and received by the elder and nephew Zurpa is known as the Zur tradition.Dampa Déshek of Gyalwa Katok Monastery received the teachings from Dzom Drowé Gönpo, a disciple of Lhajé Dropukpa. In Dampa Déshek’s lineage, there were such masters as Buborpa Yeshé Gyaltsen, who composed a commentary to this tantra. Th e teaching and practice transmissions of Dampa Déshek’s lineage spread back to central Tibet and later became known as the Kham tradition of Th e Net of Magical Illusion Tantra.Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo inherited all the doctrines of such masters as Padmasambhava, Bérotsana, and Vimalamitra. He wrote a commentary to Th e Secret Essence Tantra entitled Th e Jewel Commentary; this consti-tutes the Rong tradition. Omniscient Longchen Rabjam Zangpo wrote the commentary Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions, elucidating [this tantra] according to the atiyoga tradition. Rok Sherab Ö gathered many transmissions, such as the So, Zur, and Kyo traditions; his teaching became known as the Rok tradition.Later, when scholars of the later tantras denied [the validity of Th e Secret Essence Tantra], Chomden Rikpé Raldri obtained the actual Sanskrit text that had belonged to Master Padmasambhava, and asked Translator Tarpa Nyima Gyaltsen to translate it. Chomden Rikpé Raldri composed Adorning Flowers for “Th e Secret Essence Tantra” and other texts, and spread this teaching.

[One of the brothers,] Terchen Rinpoché, received with great eff ort in many ways the cycle of the early translations’ canon, principally those of this sovereign tantra. He com-posed various outstanding texts for each tantra’s practice techniques and sacred circle rituals. He also wrote a brief, clear practice for the sacred circle of Th e Net of Magical Illusion of the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities, and established the custom of the regular performance of its practice-off ering ritual.

Based on these and other works, an especially exalted teaching transmission has continued until the present, thus restoring the doctrine’s dying embers on its foundation.Th e Secret Essence TantraTh e Sovereign Tantra, the Secret Essence, exalted due to eight supreme qualities, is the subject; it is taught by four explanatory tantras—Th e Ocean-like Exposition Tantra, Th e Unimpeded Sound Tantra, Th e Essence of Wisdom Tantra, and Th e Vajra Mirror Tantra—and by the three sources of authority. How is it taught? In general, this supreme tantra is taught through mahayoga’s seven adornments; and specifi cally, early masters taught it [in the following three ways]: “Th e explanation grasps the point, like an arrow.” Th is is an explanation of how all phenomena, gathered into the basis, path, and result, are found within the title.[For the second,] “the explanation grasps the middle, like a spear,” Chapter Five [of Th e Secret Essence Tantra] states:Long mantras endowed with the characteristics of knowledge and engagementAre the cause and contributory conditions that ripen the result.Th at which has powerIs known as the realm of awareness holders and victors.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 311TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3116/14/10 3:51:52 PM6/14/10 3:51:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"312 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh ese lines state that the primary “cause” is the characteristic of know-ing—the view; the “contributory conditions” are the characteristics of engagement—meditative states; and the path’s results are the states of the four awareness holders. Th us, this teaching [system] is based upon a syn-thesis into these three characteristics.“Th e explanation grasps the handle, like a sword” is an explanation of the meaning of two four-line verses in the last chapter in terms of four perceptions: the natural perceptions of the basis; deluded perceptions of lack of realization; disciples’ perceptions of the path; and the transcen-dent buddhas’ perceptions, the result.Th e Zur teaching system of the canon’s [tantras] is based upon a fi ve-fold explanation of the nature, the abiding nature of things; of lack of realization, delusion’s perceptions; how omniscient buddhas see things; how compassion arises from love; and how beings are aided.Th e present-day method of teaching is as stated in Vimalamitra’s Th e Framework Scripture:To the best, present the title; to the medium, the categories;And to the least, a word-by-word commentary.Th us, there are three styles: for those with the highest degree of acumen, the teaching of the tantra based on the presentation of the title; for those of a medium degree of acumen, a categorization of the tantra’s general meanings; and for those of the least degree of acumen, a word-by-word commentary.

In the category of the later translations’ way of philosophical systems, teaching systems for many major and minor scrip-tures appeared in the past, including those based upon the monastic dis-cipline text Th e Continual Flower Garland, Th e Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight, the additional three works of Maitreya, A Message fr om a Friend, and Entering the Conduct of Enlightenment. Now, only reading transmissions for their root texts and some commentaries still remain, yet it seems that individual masters teach them based on their own powers of explanation.In the category of secret mantra, explanatory teachings once existed for most tantras. Many teaching systems appeared, including those for Indian scriptures of the type that describe deities, illustrated by the six scriptures of profound instruction in Vajra Sow; and there were what was known as Great Seal’s eight teaching systems.In the category of the Ancient tradition, teaching transmissions that continued to exist until later times include those based upon Th e Sov-ereign All-Creating Mind, the root of the eighteen [tantras] of the later mind section; Th e Discourse of All-Encompassing Awareness, the root of anuyoga’s scriptural transmission of the four discourses; and Th e Explan-atory Tantra: Th e Matrix of Wisdom Mind, taught in such texts as Th e Armor Against Darkness by Nupchen Sang yé Yeshé; Th e Path’s Array by Buddhaguhya; and Clear Tantric Pledges by Lalitavajra.Translator Gö Zhönnu Pal states that in his time, teaching transmis-sions existed for forty-one texts of tantra.

Later, Lord Marpa Chökyi Lodrö imparted the lineage of the teaching of profound instructions for meditation, which continues without inter-ruption to the present day. Next, Vairochana Rakshita, a great scholar from Kosala, came to Tibet and translated and taught [Saraha’s] trilog y of songs of realization. Th en Kor Nirupa gave extensive teachings on the essential meaning.Next, the Indian Pani, Master Vajrapani, taught the seven categories of accomplishment; the three essential meanings, which are the trilog y of songs of realization—the scripture of Th e Essence of Accomplishment with its minor parts; and twenty-seven fragments. Among these “frag-ments,” nine are profound instructions for meditation consistent with the way of philosophical systems, nine are profound instructions consis-tent with father tantras, and nine are profound instructions consistent with mother tantras. Th ese twenty-seven fragments are bound by the four seals: the seal of activity, the seal of phenomena, great seal, and the seal of the pledges. Th e twenty-seven fragments have six connections: the view, related to scriptural authority and logic; meditation, related to spiritual experience; conduct, related to circumstance; the result, related to aiding others; the path, related to indications of meditative heat; and empower-ments, related to tantric pledges. Th ese teachings are known as the earlier tradition.Next, Asu of Nepal taught the songs of spiritual realization and other texts, resulting in many tens of thousands of lineage holders. Th is is known as the later tradition. Th en, Lord Réchungpa spread the cycle of the bodiless dakinis’ teachings and Asu’s profound instructions for medi-tation. Next, Nakpo Sherdé of Ngari received from the Indian master Vajrapani ten doctrines of mental non-engagement, including Th e Trea-sury of Wisdom Body, Speech, and Mind. He then translated and taught them, yet only their reading transmission now remains. All these great seal doctrines originate only from Brahmin [Saraha] and his spiritual son [Nagarjuna], and from Lord Victor Métripa.Jnanashri and others were famous for preserving many reading transmissions.In Tibet, there were also Chomden Rikpé Raldri, Bak-tön Zhönnu Tsultrim, and others.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 314TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3146/14/10 3:51:52 PM6/14/10 3:51:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"how buddhist transmissions came to tibet \u0003 315Most of Buddhism’s sacred teachings in scripture are found in Th e Collec-tion of the Buddha’s Words in Translation [Tibetan: Kang yur; bka’ ’g yur] and Th e Collection of Indian Treatises in Translation [Tibetan: Teng yur; bstan ’g yur].

Moreover, these were teaching systems only of the tantras, many of which were later preserved among the Karma Kag yu, Géluk, Jonang , and Zhalu orders. Omniscient Rangjung Gyalwa [the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé] appeared in this world, and mainly emphasized the teaching doctrines of Th e Profound Inner Meaning, Th e Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters, and Th e Highest Continuity. He did this because the Dakpo Kag yu lineages, known as the four major and eight lesser orders, only transmitted various tantras’ empowerments and doctrinal instruction passed down from Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, and Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé. Apart from that, they did not stress teaching and study based in the way of philosophical systems, since they purely upheld Lord Milarepa’s practice lineage and diligently devoted themselves exclusively to meditation practice.

Th us, this doctrine’s principal pillars are the canon’s Th e Discourse Th at Gathers Wisdom’s Realization, Th e Net of Magical Illusion Tantra, and two traditions of the mind category of instructions. Th e profound teachings of the eight groups of meditation practices and their ancillary texts serve as ornaments, including [the deities that represents the] wis-dom body, Manjushri [Slayer of the Lord of Death]; and wisdom speech, Lotus [Héruka]. Great perfection’s secret essence cycle, now known as the four-part heart essence, comprises the quintessence of the wisdom mind of two masters [Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra], and dwells as the pure essence of the tradition’s life force.Specifi c Transmissions within the Ancient Tradition [b]Th is section has six parts: transmissions from (1) Padmakara; (2) Béro-tsana; (3) Vimalamitra; (4) Nupchen Sang yé Yeshé; (5) Ma Rinchen Chok, Nyak Jnana Kumara, and others; and (6) later treasure revealers.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 324TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3246/14/10 3:51:53 PM6/14/10 3:51:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"the eight major chariots \u0003 325Th e Transmission fr om Padmakara [i]Due to the immeasurable kindness and altruistic intention of Lord Trisong Déutsen, instigator of the doctrine in the Himalayas,Padmakara, the second Buddha, [came to Tibet].In common perception, he merely taught Th e Pith Instructions, a Garland of Views;To fortunate disciples, he imparted inconceivable cycles of ripening and liberating instructions,Including the eight groups of meditation practices.Considering beings of the future, he concealed many treasuresAnd established three meditation communities: countless accomplished masters appeared.Th e great instigator who led the dawning sun of the Victor’s doctrine into the Himalayas’ dark continent was Bodhisattva Gentle Melody [incar-nate], King Trisong Déutsen.

In the country’s four directions and in its central region, he sealed [his instructions] with seven levels of seals and concealed them in ten million treasure sites with names, illustrated by the fi ve great treasures sites, and innumerable unnamed ones.At Chimpu, Yerpa, and Chuwori, he founded three major meditation communities. Moreover, in a miraculous display, there is no area any-where in Tibet, such as central, western and eastern Tibet, so much as the size of a horse’s hoof, which his feet did not touch. He consecrated every cliff as a meditation site. Due to the instructions he granted to fortunate disciples, countless accomplished masters appeared, such as twenty-fi ve supreme accomplished masters at Chimpu, fi ft y-fi ve realized adepts of Yang Dzong, one hundred and eight persons who attained a body of light both at Yerpa and Chuwori, thirty mantra adepts at Sheldrak, and twenty-fi ve dakinis who departed into a body of light.Th e Transmission fr om Bérotsana [ii]Experiencing hardships, Bérostana received Shri Singha’s heart essence.It spread through the fi ve links and the teacher Pang-gen Sangyé Gönpo.Th e mind and spatial categories of instruction produced the kingdom of Buddha Ever Excellent.Th e majestic Buddhist King Trisong Déutsen dispatched Bérotsana, Tibet’s fi rst bilingual great translator, to India.

Fearing a [local] ruler’s punishment if he did not keep complete secrecy, Bérotsana trained in the teachings of the way of philosophical systems during the day and received [these secret teachings] at night, using skillful means and auspicious connections.

Due to slander, [he was forced] to journey to Gyalmo Tsawa Rong [in eastern Tibet]. Th ere, he taught Yudra Nyingpo at Gönpo Monastery in Gyalrong Drak, Sangtön Yeshé Lama at Tsar-ong Taktsé Kar, and Pang-gen Sang yé Gönpo in Red Cliff Gön-dzong at Tongkung Rong. In central Tibet, he taught Nyak Jnana Kumara and Liza Sherab Drönma. Th ese fi ve individuals to whom he taught great perfection’s teachings are known as the fi ve links. Lineages from them, and in particular from Pang-gen Mipam Gönpo, gradually spread: these instructions of the mind and spatial categories produced [realization of ] Buddha Ever Excellent’s infi nite kingdom.Among those instructions, the continuity of the mind category exists today in what are known as Nyang’s tradition and Aro’s tradition. Th e former consists of the transmitted teachings Bérotsana gave Nyak Jnana Kumara, which were passed in stages to masters including Nyang Yeshé Jungné and the Zur clan’s grandfather and grandson. Th e latter [Aro tra-dition] consists of the instructions transmitted by the incarnated master Aro Yeshé Jungné of Dokham, who mastered the profound teachings of the lineage of seven Indian and Chinese masters.

Nyang-ben Tingzin Zangpo bestowed the doctrinal transmission [of this set of teachings] to Bé Lodrö Wangchuk. Th e textual transmission encoded as a treasure was [later] revealed by Dangma Lhung yal, who also received their doctrinal transmission. He gave these pith instructions to Chétsun Sengé Wangchuk, who also attained liberation in a body of light. Th ese instructions were passed successively to Gyalwa Zhangtön and others, and came to be known as Th e Heart Essence of Vimalamitra.Péma Lédrel retrieved Padmasambhava’s profound instructions, Th e Heart Essence of the Dakinis, from [concealment as a] treasure, and gave it to the incarnate master Rangjung Dorjé and to Sho’i Gyalsé Lekpa. Of the former of these masters, Th e Unimpeded Sound Tantra states:A bodhisattva dwelling on awakening’s stagesWill spread [this teaching ] to the ocean’s shores.As foretold, Rangjung Dorjé performed the act of spreading this teach-ing throughout the world, and the profound teachings known as Karma Heart Essence arose from the expanse of his wisdom mind.Th e latter master [Sho’i Gyalsé Lekpa] gave instruction to the omni-scient master Drimé Özer [i.e., Longchenpa], who composed treatises that overfl owed from the expanse of Buddha Ever Excellent’s wisdom mind, including the root texts and commentaries of Th e Innermost Essence of the Spiritual Master, Th e Profound Innermost Essence, Th e Innermost Essence of the Dakinis, Th e Seven Treasures, and Th e Trilog y on Relaxation. He produced many outstanding disciples as lineage holders. In brief, the Secret Heart Essence doctrines lead to the birth of a body of light from the material body. He who is known as Longchen Rabjam Zangpo, the sec-ond Garab Dorjé incarnate, made these teachings spread far and wide.Th e Transmission fr om Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé [iv]From four masters of India, Nepal, and Drusha,Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé received Th e Discourse Th at Gathers Wisdom’s Realization, the cycle of Slayer of the Lord of Death, and other [teachings].TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 328TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3286/14/10 3:51:53 PM6/14/10 3:51:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"the eight major chariots \u0003 329Th e accomplished master Nupchen Sang yé Yeshé Rinpoché, who dwelt on awakening’s [third] stage, Luminous, received anuyoga’s transmission of the four discourses, including Th e Discourse Th at Gathers Wisdom’s Realization, and their gradual path; that cycle of discourses’ empower-ments, teachings, and pith instructions; and infi nite numbers of pro-found instructions for meditation, such as the cycle of Slayer of the Lord of Death, principally Slayer of the Lord of Death who Overpowers with Gestures. He received these from the Indian masters Black Héruka and Dharmarajapala, Vasubhasha of Nepal, Master Chétsen Kyé of Gilgit, and others.

Nyak Jnana Kumara’s principal disciples were eight whose name included Pal, among whom Sokpo Palg yi Yeshé imparted every profound instruction to Nup-chen Sang yé Yeshé.Further, Nup Namké Nyingpo traveled to India and requested from the accomplished master Hungkara the complete teaching cycle of Yangdak Héruka; he accomplished the body of nondual wisdom. Th e lineage through him, the So tradition of Yangdak Héruka’s profound instructions for meditation, is still extant in the present day. So Yeshé Jungné’s disciple, Nyang Sherab Chok, had a disciple Nyang Yeshé Jungné, whose disciple was Lhajé Zurpoché Shakya Jungné. Moreover, among the instructions which the great master [Padmasambhava] imparted to Khön Lu’i Wangpo Sungwa, both Yangdak Héruka and Vajra Dagger were transmitted through the glorious Sakyapas in a lineage which continues in the present day.Moreover, many of Lhazig Lang’s family descendents, such as Khampa Gocha, Palg yi Sengé the later, Odren Palg yi Wangchuk, Kharchen Palg yi Wangchuk, Drokmi Palg yi Yeshé, Nyen Palyang, and Nanam Dorjé Dujom, were accepted as disciples by the sublime masters [men-tioned above].

Among Sharawa’s disciples was Tumtön Lodrö Drak, who founded glorious Nartang Monastery. Th ese individuals mainly pre-served the teaching system.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 334TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3346/14/10 3:51:53 PM6/14/10 3:51:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"the eight major chariots \u0003 335Th e transmission of profound instructions for meditation constitutes a teaching system that present the four noble truths as profound instruc-tions for meditation.

At the present time, it is thought that its doctrines have fl owed into the Dakpo Kag yu order.Th e transmission of pith instructions—the sixteen drops’ empower-ments, instructions, and supportive authorizations, accompanied by pre-cious volumes of teachings—were transmitted to Pu-chungwa Zhönnu Gyaltsen.

As a result, their gradual path’s instructions, such as four thoughts which turn the mind away [from the wheel of life], appear at the beginning of all teaching systems of the later and early tradi-tions, for example, and pervade every spiritual school in the Himalayas. Yet later, when it seemed that institutions that preserved this tradition’s own systems were becoming somewhat eclipsed, there appeared Lord Manjushri’s magical manifestation with irrefutable supreme knowledge and masterful compassion; like a Buddha appearing in this world, he was known as Tsongkapa Lozang Drakpé Pal.Tsongkapa emphasized the Buddha’s Word as Instruction’s scriptural TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 335TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3356/14/10 3:51:53 PM6/14/10 3:51:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"336 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeteaching system.

Further, Machik Lapdrön clearly predicted that for as long as Shakyamuni’s doctrine endures, no one will appear comparable to the sovereign Karmapa and this holy individual. His acts, typifi ed by four great deeds, including the establish-ment of the [yearly] great prayer festival during the miracle month [i.e., the fi rst lunar month] at Lhasa, are unfathomable for ordinary beings. Th e streams of his activity—his disciples who held the collections of the Buddha’s doctrine, and the over one hundred and forty monasteries they established, are visible to the eye today. In brief, in this end time of the Buddha’s doctrine, the kindness he has shown toward the doctrine of scriptural transmission is unique.Th us, it is said that the Buddha’s Word as Instruction originated at the time of Lord Atisha; the precious master Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné founded the system; it grew and fl ourished during the time of the three brothers; and spread widely during the lifetimes of such masters as Langri Tangpa, Sharawa Yönten Drak, and Ja Yulwa.Th e Path with the Result [3]Th is section has two parts: (1) identifi cation of the tradition and (2) a presentation of its lineages.Identifi cation of the Tradition [a]Nine cycles of the path from Virupa, Saroruha, and othersWere transmitted as essential profound instructions for meditation to the great Master Drokmi Shakya Yeshé.Th e teachings that resulted from his spiritual connections with the six gates’ [scholars], the pith instructions without root [verses],TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 336TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3366/14/10 3:51:53 PM6/14/10 3:51:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"the eight major chariots \u0003 337Concealed teachings of the path in a direct lineage, and Clarifi cation of the Meaning through SymbolsAre the most important wisdom speech in the Path with the Result.Th e lord of yogis, known [in Tibetan] as Jikdral Palden Chökyong or [in Sanskrit] as the great accomplished master Virupa, was given empower-ment within a sacred circle emanated by Selfl ess Goddess.

In particular, both Marpa and Gö initially trained with Drokmi, who was remarkably exalted: for example, it is said that he attained Great Seal’s sublime accomplishment in the intermediate state aft er death. He received all nine cycles of teaching on the path, which are the ocean-like profound essence of meditation instructions. When he was about to return to Tibet from India, he asked for profound instruc-tions for meditation as a spiritual connection from the scholars of the six gates [at Vikramashila Monastery]: he received instructions for integrat-ing the discourses and tantras; techniques for dispelling three levels of obstacles—external demons, disturbances of the body’s constituent ele-ments, and mental obstacles to meditative states; great seal that dispels three suff erings; and Clear Recollection of the Natural State.In addition, powerful Lord Virupa gave Dombi Héruka a very extensive teaching on the tantra and taught him a very concise version of the pith instructions. Dombi Héruka taught Alalavajra; [and the lineage passes in turn to] Shavaripa, Garbharipa, Jayashri, Durjayachandra, and Viravajra. In east India, Drokmi Shakya Yeshé requested this from Viravajra, who gave him what is known as the Path with the Result without root verses. Th is refers to the fact that while previous versions had vajra verses, there were none in this case.

Th e fi rst of these was the glorious master of great loving-kindness, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, who received the three Vajra of Delight tantras from Drokmi Shakya Yeshé, Supreme Bliss from Translator Mal Lodrö Drakpa, yoga tantra and the protector from great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, and Th e Hundred Meditation Techniques from Bari Rinchen Drakpa. He thus received these and other doctrinal transmissions of profound instructions for meditation from four great translators.Most signifi cantly, at the age of forty-seven, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo beheld Lord Virupa in a fi vefold sacred circle [comprising the masters Virupa, Krishnacharin, Gayadhara, Kotalipa, and Vinapa], bringing teach-ings.

Th is sublime spiritual heir brought to this world the later Teaching Cycle of the Disembodied Dakini. He traveled to the celestial realms without leaving his body and later accepted many fortunate beings as his disciples, including Palden Drukpa. Among his disciples were twelve heart spiritual heirs to whom he directly conferred the instructions; foremost among them was Gyalwa Kyung-tsangpa, to whom he entrusted the oral lineage’s treasury.

He lived for one hundred and fi ft y years, and employed inconceivable great miracles to turn an infi nite wheel of teachings.His system of the spiritual path can be summarized into a threefold gradual path, of teaching, debate, and meditation practice. His teach-ings’ gradual path covered the discourses, their treatises of commen-tary, tantras, and tantric commentaries. He taught correctly the way of philosophical systems’ four major schools, and the vajra way’s four major classes of tantra. In the gradual path of debate, he learned the seven works on logic of latter-day logicians’ systems, yet he mainly followed earlier systems of logic to defi ne the three characteristics with the four major proofs. Valid cognition is classifi ed as direct perception, inference, and belief, aft er which the subject is defi nitely ascertained with refutation of objections.Regarding the gradual path of meditation practice, he taught every form of experiential cultivation of the cause-based way of the perfections and the result-based vajra way encapsulated as pith instructions of how to cultivate experience through the general and special crucial points of the thirty-seven aspects of awakening. Th us, this one teacher who appeared in the Himalayas provided infi nite approaches to the teachings and incom-parable enlightened activity: he was an inconceivable master.Among all those teachings, only the essence of his gradual path of meditation practice has lasted to the present day.

On his fi ft h visit, he traveled to China, where he lived for twelve years, then returned to Dingri [in Tibet].During these visits, Padampa Sang yé saw each individual’s exact character and capabilities, and to each he gave corresponding profound meditation instructions that led to liberation. Although his teaching did not belong to one specifi c scripture or system, it was based mainly on Th e Great River Tantra of Ali Kali and Th e Tantra of the Great Seal’s Symbol.

Th e fi rst set includes a general discourse, Th e Discourse of the River’s Play; a specifi c discourse, Th e Discourse of the Heart of the Perfection of Sublime Insight; a general tantra, Elucidating the Teachings’ Collections; and a specifi c tantra, Th e Great River Tantra of Ali Kali. Th e practical applications are the large and middle sacred circles for empowerment, and the threefold gradual path, major and minor. Th e doctrinal transmission and its oral lineage comprise four doctrinal transmissions and four oral lineages for having them arise as the path. Concerning the “immaculate” and the jewel drops, the “immaculate” has six cycles, including the root upon which the teach-ings are established. Th e jewel drops consist of profound instructions by Jangchub Sempa Kunga in answer to Patsab Gompa’s questions concern-ing hindrances caused by unhappiness. Concerning the “strainer” and one hundred thousand teachings, the “strainer” consists of eight teach-ings, such as Th e Strainer Cycle of the Nectar of Oral Instructions, which are talks by Patsab Gompa transcribed by Gyalwa Tené. Th e hundred thousand teachings contain teachings by such masters as Gyalwa Tené, Zhikpo, and Nyé-dowa.Th e extraordinary section of teachings consists of the tantra with its main points; the empowerment, accompanied by the spiritual path and guidelines; and three secret troves, fi ve cycles on the path, and eight vol-umes [of collected pith instructions].Padampa Sang yé and Jangchub Sempa Kunga gave all these pro-found instructions to learned, venerable Patsab Gompa, who passed them to Gyalwa Tené, from whom the great joyful buddha Rok Sherab Ö received Pacifi cation of Suff ering’s entire doctrinal transmission.

It consists of the wisdom of such masters as Brah-min Aryadeva and Lord Métripa; its essence is the perfection of sublime insight; and it follows the tantras’ teachings. In this practice, the four demons that bind us to the wheel of life are severed only upon the mind’s egoistic thoughts and self-clinging. Just as you must identify the ground as the place to cut trees, the place where the demons of egoistic thoughts are severed is the perfection of sublime insight. Th e profound instruc-tions for meditation related to that domain are called Severance.Th e Lineages of Severance [ii]Th is section has two parts: (1) the male system of Severance and (2) the female system of Severance.Th e Male System of Severance [aa]Padampa Sangyé gave Kyo Shakya Yeshé and Yarlung Mara SerpoSix portions of profound instruction, the male system of Severance.Padampa Sang yé gave Kyo Shakya Yeshé and Yarlung Mara Serpo what are called the six portions of profound instruction, an independent Sev-erance tradition of the discourse system, which represent the meaning of TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 362TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3626/14/10 3:51:54 PM6/14/10 3:51:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"the eight major chariots \u0003 363Aryadeva’s small scripture, Th e Fift y Verses.

Mara Serpo taught them to the attendant Nyönpa Beré, who passed them to Rok Sherab Ö; the learned, accomplished master Samding Zhönnu Drup; and others, who spread these teachings known as the male system of Severance.Th e Female System of Severance [bb]Th e female system of Severance, the intended meaning of the perfection of sublime insight, the teachings that Machik Lapdrön realized,Encompasses doctrinal transmissions of father, mother, nondual, and the dakinis’ meditative experience,Or [lineages of] her sixteen spiritual children.Aft er Padampa Sang yé arrived in Tibet, four black birds, miraculous manifestations of dakinis, fl ew toward him. When he saw them, they became four dakinis: Yé Lapdrön, Majo Jangchub of Nyaltö, Zhangmo Gyalting from Tsang , and Lhasa Nyönma.When Machik Lapdrön read the discourses of the perfection of sublime insight, the view of emptiness arose within her. Padampa Sang yé gave her a single piece of personal heart advice, which liberated her stream of being and she became a natural yogini. Machik Lapdrön opened wide a system born from her wisdom mind’s meditative experience. Th is is known as the place of Severance, the teachings she realized—the intended meaning of the perfection of sublime insight. She composed texts of inconceivable, profound instructions for meditation, among which there are Th e Great Collection of Teachings; Th e Essential Collection in Twenty-fi ve Chapters; and eight chapters of common, extraordinary, and special teachings—twenty-four in all. Th eir stream of transmission continues to the present day and constitutes the female system of Severance.Th is tradition is divided into four doctrinal transmissions: the father doctrinal transmission, skillful means; the mother doctrinal transmission, sublime insight; the nondual doctrinal transmission, the meaning ; and the doctrinal transmissions of the dakinis’ meditative experience.

Th ese were the foremost among her many groups of disciples, including one hundred and eight female and male accomplished masters, who fi lled the land of Tibet. Among them, the holder of the lineage of the discourses, her son Lang-lungpa Gyalwa Döndrup’s eldest son Tséwang, had three sons. Th e middle one, known as Tönyön Samdrup, was an unequaled accomplished master and holder of the secret mantra lineage. He had twenty-one male and female disciples, and eighteen spiritual daughters who were accomplished masters. From this point, a special Severance lineage appeared, known as Gangpa.Th e lineage of union was constituted solely of accomplished masters, from its holder Kugom Chökyi Sengé until Drogön Sang yé Tönpa and Samding Zhönnu Drup; aft er them, the lineage was transmitted widely. Lord Rangjung Dorjé received this lineage from Namtso-wa Mikyö Dorjé; he composed texts, which became the Rupa Severance lineage. Later, the Zurmang lineage emerged, from which emerged a secondary stream of Severance, Kyab-ché, founded by Nédo and Kyasé Tokden. Th is illustrates how each lineage has increased boundlessly.Machik Lapdrön’s daughter’s historical lineage, the direct lineage in Gyaltang’s tradition,Kunpang Tsöndru Sengé and Ladu Dorjé Drönma’s treasure Severance tradition, and othersHave continuing marvelous and widespread enlightened activity.Further, the historical lineage passed from Machik Lapdrön’s daugh-ter Lacham to others in stages. Samten Özer of Gyal-tang received the historical lineages of peaceful Severance, wrathful Severance, and the integrated system of peaceful and wrathful Severance, then traveled to a hundred wild, secluded places. At Ocho-lhatsé in upper Tsang, he met Machik in person; through her blessings, he composed Th e Profound Meaning, the Essence of Wisdom Mind. Th is is known as Gyaltang’s direct lineage.

Among these cycles of profound and vast teachings of Severance, the former [historical] transmission—the Gyatön Severance lineage—has continued unbroken to the present day. Since Severance is a profound technique, its enlightened activity in these and other ways is amazing : it has become widespread, fi lling the entire Himalayan region. Until the present, all spiritual masters regardless of their original tradition cultivate its experience, and it continues to be indispensable for subduing external and internal conditions that are diffi cult to subdue by other means.In general, this doctrinal system’s own terminolog y states:Th e four pair and eight discrete lineages create the framework, and six illustrative examples express its superb qualities.First, based on the individuals who requested specifi c transmissions, there are male and female lineages. Based on the essence, there are [lineages] associated with systematic texts and those with diverse texts. Based on well-known histories, there are earlier and later periods of propagation. Based on the teachings’ sources, there are canonical lineages and treasure lineages. Th ese are the four pairs or eight discrete lineages that appeared.Some present Severance in eight pairs or sixteen single [lineages]: male and female Severance, canonical and treasure Severance, Indian and Tibetan Severance, discourse and tantra traditions, the spiritual children’s lineages and the lineage of the meaning, heaven and earth teachings, sys-tematic and unsystematic teachings, and diverse and minor lineages.Among these, the fi rst [male Severance] consists of Padampa Sang yé’s transmission that includes the six portions and the three cycles on the fi nal conclusion. Second, [female Severance] consists of Machik Lap-drön’s transmission that includes Vajra Sow’s Severance cycle, and long and short texts of commentary.

Likewise, it is good if a Severance adept has knowledge acquired from education, but fi ne if not. Severance is like a lion: intimidating to a crowd yet fearless alone. Likewise, an adept is fi ne befriending the public, but fi ne traveling alone. Severance is like a large drum’s sound: a large drum’s beat can be accompanied by other instru-ments, but can be played alone. Likewise, there is no diff erence whether or not this practice is accompanied by other virtuous activities. Severance is like a spring of accomplishment: water of accomplishment fl ows in quantity equal to the number of people [present to drink it]. Likewise, in this tradition, the training suits an individual’s mental acumen. Severance is like a broken piece of a turquoise or gold: if large, it will be valuable, and even if small, it will have value according [to its size].

From the Buddhist perspective, the former are said to be the fi ve major fi elds of culture, the fi rst of which is the study of Sanskrit grammar.In Heaven of the Th irty-three, a god called All-Knowing God com-posed the fi rst great treatise on grammar. It is said that Indra studied with him and composed his own treatise, Indra’s Grammar. Th e seer Brihaspati studied this treatise under Indra, became profi cient, and served as teacher to the gods. Venerated as “guru of the gods,” strong pride swelled within him, at which Indra remarked,Knowledge of grammar in its entiretyIs boundless, like an ocean;TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 379TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3796/14/10 3:51:55 PM6/14/10 3:51:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"380 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeMy own knowledge is like a full vase,Your knowledge amounts to just a single drop!Th is shattered Brihaspati’s pride: disheartened, he vowed never to speak of grammar again, but Indra commanded him, “Nevertheless, you must teach whatever you know.” Since Brihaspati had made his vow, he observed the practice of not speaking on four restricted days, but he taught at other times. Th is account is found in ancient Tibetan histories.On the four restricted days, Indians proscribed not only learning gram-mar but study in general. Swift Realization, a text belonging to the later translations, lists fi ve restricted days:On the eighth [lunar day], the teacher is vanquished.On the fourteenth, the students are vanquished.On the thirtieth, both are vanquished.On the fi ft eenth, everyone is vanquished.Th e action of reading on the fi rst [day of the lunar month],Diminishes one’s very intelligence,Just as when Gangaja’s arrowsStruck Yudhishtira’s army.How the Study of Sanskrit Grammar Spread in the Human World [b]Th is section has four parts: (1) Panini’s Grammar, (2) Chandragomi’s grammar, (3) Th e Kalapa Grammar, and (4) the Sarasvati and other grammars.Panini’s Grammar [i]Brahmin Panini, the grammarian whose life the Buddha foretold,Was blessed by Lord of the World and composed the ancestor of grammar texts,Commented upon by Shesha and Vararuchi.Panini’s tradition includes Th e Mahabhasha’s root text and commentaries, Moonlight of Analysis,An Introduction to Form, Shakatayana, and Katyayana’s [Grammar].TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 380TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3806/14/10 3:51:55 PM6/14/10 3:51:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"a history of buddhist culture \u0003 381His life foretold by the Buddha in Th e Journey to Lanka Discourse, which refers to “the grammarian Panini,” and in Th e Root Tantra of Manjushri, Brahmin Panini was born in Bhiruka Grove in west India. He consulted a palmist to ascertain whether or not he could learn grammar. When the palmist predicted that he could not, Panini took a small knife and cut the missing lines on his palm, then studied with every grammarian in the world. He acquired an excellent knowledge of grammar but was left dis-satisfi ed. He practiced [Bodhisattva] Lord of the World’s awareness man-tra and saw the exalted bodhisattva, who asked, “What is it you wish?” Panini said, “Bestow upon me the knowledge of grammar.” Th e bodhi-sattva then recited the [Sanskrit] alphabet: “A, I, U, . . . ,” etc. Th rough the exalted bodhisattva’s blessing, that act alone gave Panini understanding of all grammars in the three worlds.Panini then composed the thousand-verse Panini’s Grammar and the thousand-verse Discourse Th at Distinguishes Particularities. Until that time, except for the various grammar texts found in non-Buddhist tradi-tions (such as Indra’s Grammar that Shariputra is said to have studied for twelve years), no treatise in the Buddhist tradition combined every application of grammar. Th erefore, these two texts by Panini are like the source text or ancestor of all works on grammar.To help King Udayana learn grammar, Brahmin Vararuchi used the power of an awareness mantra to summon naga King Shesha and compel him to teach a hundred-thousand-verse commentary to Panini’s Gram-mar. Th e naga, behind a curtain, dictated while Vararuchi transcribed his words. Once, Vararuchi wondered, “What does [Shesha’s] body look like?” He lift ed the curtain and saw a great rearing serpent. Th e naga fl ed in embarrassment. At that point, only twenty-fi ve thousand verses had been written. Vararuchi composed the rest of the text, another twelve thousand verses; it was called Th e Mahabhasha (Great Speech). Teaching and study of Panini’s works with this commentary have not declined but continue in India to the present day.Grammar texts that follow Panini’s tradition include Bhasha (Speech), a root text by Purushottama of about nine hundred verses, accompanied by an autocommentary; Moonlight of Analysis by Ramachandra; An Introduction to Form: A Commentary to the Meaning of Panini by illustri-ous Dharmakirti; Shakatayana, a text included as a part of Panini’s Gram-mar; and the writings of Katyayana.It is said that Translator Darpa later translated just the root text of Panini’s Grammar, but this was not a literal translation.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 381TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3816/14/10 3:51:55 PM6/14/10 3:51:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"382 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeChandragomi’s Grammar [ii]Chandragomi’s discourse, commentaries, and ancillary textsProvide a perfect summary [of Panini’s Grammar], being concise, clear, and complete;From among many texts written by him and others,Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen fi rst translated and taught the root text.His life foretold in Th e Latter Tantra of the Wheel of Time, Master Chan-dragomi was born in Varendra in east India. He knew all the general fi elds of culture, such as grammar and logic, without having studied them. From the age of seven, he was able to refute non-Buddhists’ doctrinal challenges. Chandragomi received scriptural transmission from Master Ashoka, attained accomplishment in the practice of the awareness man-tras of All-Seeing One and Tara, and became a great scholar. Encouraged by exalted Bodhisattva All-Seeing One, Chandragomi adhered to the dis-cipline of “gomi,” or layperson. Th e marvelous story of Chandragomi’s life is inconceivable; he is alive even now, residing in Potala pure land.He composed one hundred and eight praises, Buddhist treatises, non-Buddhist treatises, and treatises on the arts, a total of four hundred and thirty-two diff erent texts on various subjects. In Dakshina, Chandragomi read Th e Mahabhasha, the commentary composed by [the Naga king ] Shesha. He criticized it with these words:A commentary should contain few words and many meanings; it should be without repetition and be complete. Th e Naga, very dull of mind, [composed a commentary] that has many words and little meaning, is repetitive and incomplete.Chandragomi then composed Chandra’s Grammar, which has seven hundred verses [divided into] twenty-four chapters. Th is commentary provides a perfect summary of the meaning of Panini’s Grammar and has the qualities of being concise, clear, and complete. He also wrote such ancillary texts as A Discourse on Letters. In Nalanda, however, Chandrag-omi read Th e Ever-Excellent Grammar Discourse, written by Chandrakirti. “Th is has been composed with perfect wording,” Chandragomi thought. “My work is not as good as this.” Feeling his grammar would not help TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 382TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 3826/14/10 3:51:55 PM6/14/10 3:51:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"a history of buddhist culture \u0003 383beings, he threw the volume of Chandra’s Grammar down a well.

Chandrakirti wrote out of pride in his scholarship, so his work will prove to be of little use to others. Th erefore, retrieve your text from the well.” Heeding her prophetic instruction, he retrieved it. Such is the exalted quality of this text that it was said that just drinking that well’s water imparted great knowledge.Chandragomi’s maternal uncle, Dharmadéva, wrote a commentary to his work; Ratnamati wrote a commentary to Dharmadéva’s text, and Pur-nachandra composed a commentary to Ratnamati’s commentary. [Th is tradition includes] many other texts, both those by Chandragomi him-self, such as A Discourse on Unadi, etc. along with its autocommentary and A Discourse on Verbal Roots, as well as texts composed by others.Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen translated this tradition’s principal source text [Chandra’s Grammar]. Since that time, its teaching trans-mission has continued uninterruptedly in Tibet. A number of Tibetan commentaries have also been written, such as those by great Translator Tuk-jé Palwa and Zhalu Chökyong Zangpo.

Not long aft erward, to gain understanding of this grammar, Brahmin Sapta-varman followed King Udayana’s command and practiced meditation on Six-Faced Youth [Indra].

By the deity’s mere enunciation, “Siddho varna samamnayah,” Saptavarman acquired full knowledge of grammar, then composed Th e Kalapa Grammar. As this belongs to the tradition of Indra’s Grammar, a large number of both Buddhist and non-Buddhist commentaries on it have appeared.In Tibet as well, many have studied Th e Kalapa Grammar. Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen fi rst translated the principal text. Th en, over time, Translator Pang Loten and others translated such Kalapa Grammar com-mentaries as Th e Durga Singha Commentary, Syadanta, and Tyadyanta. A number of both good and poor-quality commentaries on Th e Kalapa Grammar have been written in Tibetan.Th e Sarasvati and Other Grammars [iv]Noble Sarasvati taught a grammar to Anubhuti.Th e lord of Jonang and Chökyi Nangwa translated and taught the root text and commentary.During the lifetimes of the six learned gate guardians [of Vikramashila Monastery], exalted Sarasvati taught Sarasvati’s Grammar directly to Master Anubhuti, a brahmin from Maharashtra in southern India. Th is grammar became widely studied throughout the land of exalted beings.In Tibet, the lord of Jonang, Drolwé Gönpo [Taranata] studied Saras-vati’s Grammar with the scholars Krishna and Palabhadra, then made the fi rst Tibetan translation of the text and its commentary, and also com-posed his own commentary. It is thought that Translator Darpa revised Taranata’s translation of the main text and made a new translation of the commentary. It is possible that Darpa’s translation of some of the text’s chapters were well done, yet when one compares his Tibetan version of the commentary to the Sanskrit original, they are usually diff erent. It seems that his work must be classifi ed as original rather than as a transla-tion. Nevertheless, a lineage of teaching spread based on this text.Omniscient Chökyi Nangwa, having fi rst questioned Brahmin Vish-nupati of Nepal, gained a perfect understanding of the diffi cult points of Sarasvati’s Grammar. He then made a new translation of Th e Clear Distinction, Master Anubhuti’s own commentary to [Sarasvati’s Gram-mar].

In our teacher’s doctrine, the fi rst Bud-dhist text on logic is Establishing Debate. Some assert that its author was Master Vasubandhu, but in the autocommentary to A Compendium of All Discourses on Logic, this opinion is clearly refuted at length: the Vasuban-dhu [commonly referred to as] the “younger brother” [of Asanga] clearly did not write it.

Th e Proclamation of Brahma: Characteristics of Painting, written by Seer Atreya, states that in the past during the fi rst eon, when the human life span decreased from one hun-dred thousand years, a human monarch called Subduer of Fear appeared. He ruled this world according to spiritual principles; thus the life span increased again to one hundred thousand years and great happiness pre-vailed. Th e king practiced disciplines of asceticism and attained Ishvara’s eight qualities. Brahma gave him the supreme boon of understanding all treatises and made a promise that the gods’ armies and weapons would not intrude into the human world.

If you do not raise my son [from death], I will kill myself here.Th e king led the brahmin into the presence of the King of the Lord of Death, blazingly resplendent as the sun. He prostrated and asked that the brahmin’s son be returned. Th e Lord of Death replied, “I did not take him: his own karma was exhausted!” Th e king demanded, “Give him back!” Th e Lord of Death repeated again and again that it was not right, until fi nally they prepared for battle, and poured a deluge of weapons upon one another.

As he was the fi rst to fashion a formal painting, he was also called First Artist. Brahma ordered the king to off er prostrations and gift s to the Lord of Death, and everyone was pleased [at the outcome]. Th e king then went to the world of Brahma, and asked how to paint.

Udrayana sent Bimbisara the gift of a suit of armor of priceless jewels; in reply, Bimbisara ordered a painting of the Buddha’s body to be made on cotton and sent it [to Udrayana]. Our teacher’s brilliant splendor was unendurable; the artist was unable to paint him. Th e Buddha sat at the edge of a bathing pool and his likeness refl ected on the water was painted on cotton. Above and below [the central fi gure of the Buddha], the artist painted the links of interdependent causation, in unfolding and reverse order, and the fi ve bases of training in refuge, together with their benefi ts. When this was sent to Udrayana, he perceived the truth. It is said that this painting was known as “Th e Sage Drawn from Water.”When the Transcendent Conqueror proclaimed the teachings in Kap-ilavastu, the wife of Mahanaman sent a maidservant named Rohita to fetch a garland. On the way, a cow about to give birth gored her, and she died. As she had faith in the Buddha, she immediately entered the womb of the queen of Sri Lanka. At her birth, it rained pearls: she was given the name Muktiki (“Pearl”), or Muktikakhatti (“Pearl Th rone”). She heard stories of the Buddha from a merchant from central India and was moved to faith, then sent the Buddha a letter. In reply, the Buddha sent a painting an artist made on cotton, depicting how our teacher had shone light rays onto it, together with a metrical line of instruction. On seeing it, Muk-tikakhatti perceived the truth.

Vishvakarma undertook to measure the Buddha, tying a thread to our teacher’s little toe, but before he completed his task, he arrived in the presence of Buddha Joyous Splendor in the world Joyful Glowing Light. Th at buddha said, “Set aside thoughts of the Buddha’s size; instead, bring your teacher to mind.” As soon as Vishvakarma did this, he arrived in the teacher’s presence. With various miraculous acts, he produced statues of the Buddha at the ages of eight and twelve, with measurements provided by the Buddha’s former nursemaids; and a statue of the Buddha at the age of twenty-fi ve, with measurements correspond-ing to common perception. Our teacher’s face shone and gathered light to bless the statues.Shakra invited the latter of these statues (the one the size of his body at the age of twenty-fi ve) to the heavens. For many years, the other two statues dwelled in the heavens, Oddiyana, the nagas’ lands, and at Vajra Seat. Th en, during King Dévapala’s reign, the statue of the Buddha at twelve years of age was invited to China; the statue of the Buddha at eight years of age, to Nepal. Eventually, both arrived in Tibet: these statues are those that sit [in Lhasa] in the Temple of Magical Manifestation [i.e., the Jokang ] and Ramoché Temple.

During Trisong Déutsen’s reign, Tibet’s earli-est paintings and sculpted images were those at Samyé Monastery, which portrayed the three turnings of the wheel of the teachings, principally the great awakening.Translator Taktsang relates that “Th e Sage Drawn from Water,” Tibet’s earliest model of a painted image, came from [the statue of ] great awak-ening at Vajra Seat having been sprinkled with saff ron water, then covered with moist clean cotton. When the cloth was lift ed away, the two arms directly appeared upon the cloth due to the statue’s blessing. A style of painting was transmitted using this model.

Th ree artists named Tashi founded the Gardri tradition.In sculpture as well, a succession of masters appeared.At fi rst, Nepalese- [Tibetan: Béri-] style painting was the only wide-spread system. Th en [Bodhisattva] Gentle Melody took birth in human form as Venerable Menla Döndrup in [Tibet, at] Mentang, Lhodrak. He originated the use of that area’s vermilion. Because of his wife, he left his homeland and moved to Tsang, where he studied painting under Dopa Tashi Gyalpo. He remembered a previous lifetime in China during which he had seen paintings made of embroidered silk. He then constantly cre-ated wonderful paintings, including the great Mentang painting. He inspired lines of both father-son and master-disciple lineages. Further, a tradition known as Kyentsé Chenmo appeared in Gongkar Gangtö, an artistic tradition derived from the earlier one. Th ese two, the Menri and Kyenri, became two distinct, original systems, as famous in the Himalayas as the sun and moon.An artist known as Tulku Chiu traveled tirelessly for the sake of [mas-tering ] this fi eld of art.

Later, Chöying Gyatso of Tsang founded the New Menri tradition. Th is and many other artistic lineages appeared, but they mainly belong within the previous systems.In Yartö, an artist known as Tulku Namka Tashi appeared. Venerable Lord Mikyö Dorjé affi rmed that artist was one of his own emanations, and foretold that he would spread the [Karmapa’s] physical enlightened activity. As Zhamar Könchok Yenlak and Gyaltsap Drakpa Döndrup instructed, Tulku Namka Tashi learned the Menri tradition from Kalden Sharchokpa Könchok Pendé of Ené, known as an emanation of the Chi-nese princess [Wencheng ]. He then developed the painting tradition known as Gardri, in which he used Indian bronze casting and the Men-tang school styles of facial and physical depiction as a basic framework, and followed the Ming dynasty style of silk embroidered hangings for such details as landscape, and for coloring and shading. Aft er him, an artist known as Chö Tashi, and later, Karshö Karma Tashi continued this unrivalled system of painting which still exists today. In brief, the three artists named Tashi [Tulku Namka Tashi, Chö Tashi, and Karshö Karma Tashi] founded the widespread Gardri school.Similarly, the foremost masters of sculpture were Tulku Léu-chungpa and Péma Karpa. Later, a Gardri tradition master, an offi cial of Dakpo Gopa Monastery known as Kundün Karma Sidral, or Go-nyön, had unequaled intelligence and was known as a physical emanation of the eighth Lord [Karmapa]. Th ey, Karma Rinchen, and many others master sculptors appeared, but no lineages from them can be found today.During the time of the great fi ft h [Dalai Lama], there was a sculptor known as Épa Kukpa, or Hordar; and Tulku Baptro, known as an ema-nated artist.

While Buddhism lasted in India, such scripts as Lancha, Vartula, and Nagara predominated, whereas aft er the doctrine’s decline, only the Arabic script was widespread.In China during the reign of the fi ve Dhi [emperors] and others, carved and impressed letters originated; later, written letters were devised by the high offi cial Li Tse while at war.

He studied Sanskrit grammar and [Indian] writ-ten language perfectly from scholars such as Pandit Dévavidyasingha and Brahmin Livikara, and returned to Tibet, where he pleased the king with poetic compositions of praises in intricate structure.In [Lhasa’s] Maru Palace, Tonmi Sambhota created a new Tibetan script based on the [Deva]nagara script, omitting the [Sanskrit] vowels and consonants unnecessary for the Tibetan language, and adding six necessary letters [not in the Sanskrit alphabet]. He thus founded the written language tradition known as “the thirty mother letters and the six child letters.” He is said to have composed eight grammar texts, including Th e Th irty Letters and Tibetan Grammar; however, it is said that the six others apart from these two were lost during King Lang Darma’s reign.

Nevertheless, in this chapter dealing with the common subjects of cul-ture, I accept the view of Shura and other Buddhist masters, and present unchanged what is known in the Vedas’ source texts.In the past, during [the eon of ] perfection, the unlimited life spans of gods and humans decreased slightly and death occurred. Th e gods then conferred on ways to attain immortality. Th e text Moonlight of the Words’ Meanings states that naturally occurring sounds Om, Ah, and Ta emerged eff ortlessly from Brahma’s cheeks; some Vedic texts state that they fl owed naturally from his mouth. In any case, it is said that immediately thereaf-ter, the four Vedas arose from his four mouths. As is stated:Brahma’s central mouthSpoke Th e Life Veda;Th e other mouthsSpoke the Songs, the Hymns, and the Sacrifi ces.Th erefore, Th e Life Veda fi rst emerged from Brahma’s central mouth: thus, knowledge of medicine had naturally come into his mind. Th e other Vedas appeared successively thereaft er. All four are believed to possess three qualities: they are permanent since no one created them; they are self-occurring since no eff ort contaminated them; and they are valid since they describe everything.Following [Brahma’s proclamation of the Vedas], when [the gods] sought the nectar [of deathlessness] from the ocean, they used Mandara [Mountain] as a churning rod and [the naga] Vasuki as the rope to turn it. Brahma added the world’s medicines and vital essences to the ocean and churned it vigorously. First, a heap of darkness was produced; Brahma threatened it with [the syllable] Hung so that it merged into the animate and inanimate, becoming what is called poison. Th en in succession such riches appeared as [the goddess] Shridévi, the supreme horse, the elephant, the sun, and the moon. When what is called alcohol emerged, those who were too frightened to drink it were known as non-gods [or demi-gods]; those able to drink it, gods. Finally nectar arose, fi lling eight great vessels.

It was taught and transmitted in succession: Dasha Prajapati taught the gods’ physi-cians, Ashvini’s twin sons; they taught Indra. He taught Atreya, Dhan-vantari, Kanyi Chö, Nemindhara, Gopurarakshita, and Sholdro Kyé. Th e fi rst of these, Atreya, composed the major text A Summary of Brahma’s Teaching.From Agnivesha and other gods, the lineage passed to human beings.Harichandra composed Charaka;Other erudite seers composed many medical texts.Th e great seers just mentioned taught Agnivesha, Bhela, Jatukarna, Parashara, Ksharapani, and other gods, who composed a variety of gen-eralized and specifi c texts. Th is teaching was eventually passed on from those divine seers to a human lineage. Establishing the Essentials of Medi-cine states:Brahma taught this Veda of Preserving Life in the higher realms. Eventually, the King of Kashi taught it to humans.Th is text thus teaches that medical treatment fi rst appeared [in this world] in the land of Kashi in India, then gradually spread.

Th e lord of all Vedas, Seer Harichandra, also known as Very Venerable Charaka, composed the medical treatment treatise entitled Charaka. In his family lineage appeared the great physicians Shri Krishna, Lalita, Mukachandra, Ratnakara, and Avatara, who all had the name Shri.

His teaching consists primarily of instructions on the four types of medicine permissible for fully ordained individuals. Medicines include broths, which can be kept only during appropriate times [for eating ] (i.e., before noon); drinks consisting of fruit juice or yoghurt, which can be kept for one period of time (i.e., one whole day); molasses or clarifi ed butter, which can be kept for a week; and herbal medicines, which can be kept for a lifetime. Th e text also contains a supplementary general account of the physician Jivakumara.When the Buddha taught Th e Sacred Golden Light Discourse, he said that in the past, during the time of Buddha Jeweled Crown’s doctrine, he himself was a merchant’s son Chubep. At that time he questioned his father Jatadhari, who was a great doctor, on how to become learned in the elements.

His student was Jivakumara, a supreme physician who exceeded human limits; they and others are not known to have written any books on medicine. It seems that some believe a passage in Th e Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition that begins, “Four years in the Forest of Medicine . . .” to refer to [the Buddha] teaching the four medical tantras and other [instructions on medicine] while living there.Due to erroneous statements concerning A Cluster of Jewels,A great deal of nonsense has been written on this subject.However, the teachings of the later Zurkar Lekshé Tsol are unmistaken works.Some believe A Cluster of Jewels, a text written and taught by the three sons, including Tsenpa Shilaha, to be the Buddha’s own words. Primarily due to this erroneous belief, some who are renowned as Tibetan scholars have written a great deal of nonsense on this subject. Nevertheless, Lord Tenpé Nyinjé and his spiritual heirs concur that the detailed verifi cation and refutations in the later Zurkar Lekshé Tsol’s writings (such as Th e Framework of Medicine) constitute excellent compositions that present the facts.How Medicine Spread in India, China, and Tibet [c]Th is section has three parts: (1) the history of medicine in India, (2) China, and (3) Tibet.Th e History of Medicine in India [i]Aft erwards, Suryapala composed Establishing the Essentials of Medicine.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 410TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4106/14/10 3:51:56 PM6/14/10 3:51:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"a history of buddhist culture \u0003 411Th e exalted master [Nagarjuna] composed Th e Hundred Prescriptions and other medical texts.Aft er the Victor appeared in our world, the physician Suryapala, who came from a family of horse breeders in west India, composed the text Establishing the Essentials of Medicine.

Even on a merely apparent level, he traveled with miraculous powers throughout the Land of Jambu; in particular, he journeyed to India six times. Oddiyana’s principal dakini, Shrimala, entrusted him with her secret trove of instructions, including Th e Eight Branches and Th e Tantra of Black Tresses. He also directly met [in visions] many gods and great human seers, who granted him their instructions for medical treatments. He extracted the pith instructions in medicine from all lands of Jambu and its islands, including Sri Lanka, and he received the essence of learned, accomplished masters’ profound instructions.During his early life, he composed A Synthesis of the Eight Branches’ Essence and a commentary to its fi rst chapter. During the latter part of his life, he manifested inconceivable miracles in turning the wheel of the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 419TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4196/14/10 3:51:57 PM6/14/10 3:51:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"420 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeteachings, composing Th e Essence of Nectar: Th e Four Great Tantras of the Eight Branches’ Secret Pith Instructions, a synthesis of the meaning of all medical texts. He also wrote A Vase of Nectar: A Short Medical Tan-tra, together with some [ancillary] texts. He taught common students medical treatments; and in particular, for Sumtön Yeshé Zung, his dis-ciple with supreme good fortune, he turned the wheel of Th e Secret Heart Essence teachings. He sealed his instruction on Th e Four Medical Tantras and Th e Secret Heart Essence for twelve years, and fi nally, without leaving his body behind, he departed to Medicine Buddha’s pure realm.On the subject of Th e Four Medical Tantras, diff erent beliefs have arisen, such as belief that they belong to either the canon or the treatises, that they are both, or that they constitute a treatise. Nevertheless, such masters as Lord Tenpé Nyinjé and his spiritual heirs consider that exter-nally Th e Four Medical Tantras are the Victor’s canon; internally, they constitute a treasure transmission; and secretly, they are the words of Yutok Yönten Gönpo himself. Th is belief is correct. Th e fi rst is proved by scriptures, as in Th e Concise Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight, which states,Whatever doctrine the Victor’s pious attendants teach . . . , etc.Th e Highest Continuity states:Th e one who [teaches] solely the Victor’s teaching . . . , etc.It is also [proven by the fact] that nothing else has appeared in this land of snow mountains [Tibet] to equal the textual tradition of the glori-ous Four Medical Tantras, which are self-contained and can benefi t every individual, high or low.Th e second [statement that Th e Four Medical Tantras constitute a trea-sure transmission is true] because Drapa Ngönshé discovered just the root text [of Th e Four Medical Tantras] concealed as a treasure by Bérotsana; he entrusted it to Yutok Yönten Gönpo. Th is does not contradict [the above statement], but shows the connection [between the early tantras and treasure tradition].Th e third [statement that Th e Four Medical Tantras are Yutok’s own words is proven] by the fact that this is directly stated in Leading to Cer-tainty, the history of Th e Heart Essence. Not only that, examination of Th e Four Medical Tantras proves this to be correct.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 420TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4206/14/10 3:51:57 PM6/14/10 3:51:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"a history of buddhist culture \u0003 421A nest of physicians overfl owed and innumerable lineage holders emerged,Such as the traditions of the Jang father and sons, and the Zurkar uncle and nephew.Most famous in later times were Dési Sangyé Gyatso and Chökyi Jungné.[Such masters] elucidated these teachings and cared for the land of Tibet.Th roughout the early, middle, and later parts of Yutok Yönten Gönpo’s life, a nest of physicians overfl owed: like the stars of the heavens and par-ticles of earth, lineage holders beyond number and measure appeared. Chiefl y, eleven doctors, including Dzamen Lebpo and Jang-men Palé, were the most famous. Among them, Sum-tön Yeshé Zung received the entirety of all [Yutok’s] instructions and was the designated heir of Th e Four Medical Tantras, Th e Secret Heart Essence, and ancillary texts. Yutok Bümseng, Viji Lekden Gönpo, Drangti Palden Tsojé, and many others in earlier and later times composed commentaries to Th e Four Medical Ta n t r a s.In particular, in later times, the father Jangpa Rikden Chenpo Nam-g yal Drak-zang, and his sons Mi’i Nyima, Lhatsun Tashi Palzang, and Sönam Yeshé Gyaltsen composed many commentaries to the medical tantras, medical overviews, and supplementary texts; they thereby estab-lished what is known as the Jang tradition.Zurkar Kuwo Nyam-nyi Dorjé received direct authorization from Yutok Yönten Gönpo and then composed many medical texts, including a revised edition of Th e Four Medical Tantras, a supplementary practice of the spiritual master, and Ten Million Relics. Among his many disciples, such as the eight blessed ones, a transmission arose with four perfect char-acteristics in the fi eld of medicine: pith instructions, activity, practical instructions, and teaching. It produced many skilled doctors who wrote extensively, including Kongmé Kyenpa Lata Tséwang, Tsomé Kenchen, and Jarpo Penchen. In particular, the uncle [presumably Zurkar Kuwo Nyam-nyi Dorjé] lord of the teachings’ nephew, Zurkar Lodrö Gyalpo (also known as Karma Lekshé Tsol), followed Lord Mikyö Dorjé’s pro-phetic advice and taught and spread medicine’s textual tradition with great enthusiasm.

He also founded a medical school.Further, all-seeing Chökyi Jungné became an exceptionally skilled physician, his mastery of medicine overfl owing as though his training in previous lifetimes had reawakened. From Pön-tsang Yeshé of the later Zurkar’s lineage of training, the doctor Étrosé of Malava in west India, and skilled doctors from China, he received teaching transmissions and came to defi nitive conclusions based on his questions concerning diffi cult points. He attained the state of a second Medicine Buddha. He had many skilled students, and their transmission of teaching and practical instruc-tions continues unimpaired to the present day, so that the holders of this lineage are widely renowned to be superior to all other physicians.In brief, by elucidating medical knowledge, master physicians such as these cared for the entire land of Tibet.Th e Minor Fields of Culture [B]Th is section has four parts: (1) astrological calculation, (2) poetics, (3) metrical composition, and (4) lexicography, and an ancillary statement on theater.Astrological Calculation [1]Th is section has three parts: (1) stellar calculation (Indian astrolog y), (2) victory in battle, and (3) element calculation (Chinese astrolog y).Stellar Calculation (Indian Astrology) [a]Seers created many systems of stellar calculation.Nga-bong, Garga, and other seers created a system of astrolog y based on the planets’ and constellations’ movements.

Th e lineage-bearer Gyalka then established the basis of astrolog y by making the explicit teaching of the summarized Wheel of Time Tantra into an applicable practical astrolog y.Later, in the Fire Hare year [1027], when Th e Wheel of Time became known throughout India, and both non-Buddhist [simplifi ed] practical astrolog y and esoteric astrolog y had declined as that tantra foretold, its pure astrological system began.

Further, in most tantras (pri-marily An Ocean of Dakas Supreme Bliss Tantra) and in particular Th e Glorious Wheel of Time Tantra’s worldly realms chapter, his clear presen-tation provides a basis for learned masters to devise various methods for practical astrological applications.In Tibet, omniscient Butön Rinchen Drup and all-knowing Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen elucidated in detail the three aspects of the Wheel of Time: outer, inner, and alternative.

Th ese were the fi rst Tibetan astrological texts.Pukpa Lhundrup Gyatso, the Lord of Jang, and others elucidated their own systems.In later times, the two astrological traditions of Pukpa and Tsurpu developed.Later [in 1447], Kéwang Norzang Gyatso and Pukpa Lhundrup Gyatso composed the mother and child Precepts of Pundarika, spread by Sam-g yalwa and others, creating what is known as the Pukpa tradition. Th e great lineage bearer of Jang correctly elucidated another system using his own analysis of Th e Wheel of Time Tantra. Jamyang Chenpo Dön-drup Özer from Tsurpu [Monastery], a follower of the Victor Rangjung Dorjé’s astrological system, composed a major astrological text. Trinlépa Choklé Namg yal and the illustrious Tsuklak Trengwa both composed major commentaries to A Compilation of All Astrolog y.

Th ese teachings became Th e Glorious Tantra of Complete Victory in War.Karma Siddha Utpala fi rst transmitted this tantra in the human world. Dzumlang Scholar Jayananda and Translator Lowo Sherab Rinchen trans-lated it into Tibetan. Texts such as Elucidating Hidden Pith Instructions and An Ocean of Jewels also appeared. Th e fi rst Tibetan commentary to this tantra was Supreme Delight by Pukpa Lhundrup Gyatso. In that mas-ter’s family lineage through nephews, glorious Lord Trinlépa’s disciple Durampa Chimé Déwa wrote Th e Jewel Garland of Practice, also known as Th e Hundred Light Rays. Pékar Yi-zhin Wangpo wrote Th e Wonderful Adorning Flame. Bodong Yönten Lodrö wrote a root text, Th e Concise Essence, and its commentary. Many such writings appeared, yet due to the fact that the vital pith instructions were kept very secret from the begin-ning , [this teaching ] strayed into fabricated theory. Th ese days, it exists in Tibet in name only, whereas it seems prevalent, together with its pith instructions, among Hindus in India and Nepal.Element Calculation (Chinese Astrology) [c]Emperor Hung Dhi created element calculation when he examined a turtle.Many subsequent texts were based on this.Khampa Tramo, Krishnachandra, Kyung-nak Shakya Dargyé, and others founded systems,But the early translations were very adulterated.Later, the omniscient Lord made many new reliable translations of Chinese astrology.Element calculation, or what is known as “Chinese astrolog y,” originated in China. Th e fi rst Chinese emperor, Fu Hsi of the Dhi Dynasty, was given a gold-colored turtle by one of his subjects from the far ocean’s shore. Gazing upon and examining it, the eight trigram symbols dawned in his mind for the fi rst time.

During Buddhism’s later spread, Translator Khampa Tramo, Scholar Krishnachandra, Kyung-nak Shakya Darg yé, and others translated and taught many texts, such as Th e Illuminating Torch. Kyung-nak Shakya Darg yé and others discovered many element calculation trea-sure texts and founded a great and famous system. Nevertheless, the early translations, including the later Chinese bride’s translation of cycles of astrological application and other works, were extremely adulterated. Due to the feeble merit of Tibetans and the deviousness of the Chinese (who concealed the most essential cycles of astrological application), astrolog y was taken to be what it was not, pride was taken in personal fabrications as though they were gold, and the teaching became meaningless chatter with many leaves but no essential fruit. Consequently, no texts existed that corresponded with the Chinese originals.Later, the omniscient lord of the teachings Dharmakara [Chökyi Jungné] made new, defi nitely reliable translations of Chinese astrolog y based on the primary cause of his recollection of previous lifetimes, and the favorable conditions of the monasteries of Nan Chao, with their tra-ditions of learned masters such as Yuan Wan Ling. In these new trans-lations, many subjects appear in the textual cycle entitled Th e Magical Mirror of Existence, such as geomancy; life span calculations; calculations of times for funerals, for marriages, and for avoiding misfortune; and cal-culations of helpful results.Poetics [2]Th e most famous work of poetry is Hindu, the Bharata.Kalidasa composed works such as Th e Eight Messengers.Th ere were many Indian commentaries to Th e Mirror, composed by Dandi.Proponents of Hindu tenets wrote the most famous poetic treatises of lit-erary embellishment.

Many well-known texts appeared in later times, as illustrated by the treatises of Kalidasa, including Th e Eight Messengers (Cloud Messenger, etc.), and his Kumarasambhava.One text gathered the best aspects of all the earlier texts—the treatise of literary embellishment, Th e Mirror of Poetics, written by the outwardly Hindu master Dandi (“who carried a cane”), who was learned in both Hindu and Buddhist philosophy. Many Hindu and Buddhist commen-taries were made to this text in India.

It was all-knowing Tenpé Nyinjé alone who, directly and through his disciples, elucidated all ten fi elds of Buddhist culture, and grammar and medicine in particular.A Note on Culture in General [2]As the Victor did not emphasize worldly treatises,He did not teach the basic texts of culture.Since they are branch fi elds, the learned have elaborated them.Th ese fi elds of culture do not actually belong within the teachings’ three cycles. Th e principal activity through which the Buddhas establish their disciples in freedom and omniscience is the sequential teaching of the three ways and the four tantras. Th ey turn the amazing, exceptional wheel of teachings that do not share [the values of ] worldly individuals, and they do not emphasize worldly treatises in their doctrine. Th erefore, the victors taught none of the basic texts of these fi elds of culture. Never-theless, there is not the slightest thing the buddhas do not see or know; therefore, when the time has come to train a being through one of these fi elds of culture, they do so by giving a teaching (describing the subject’s causes, examples, nature, and semantics), the meaning of which no one else would be capable of knowing. Th is is a special quality of a Buddha.Since most of the Buddha’s excellent speech exists in Sanskrit, one should have a good knowledge of Sanskrit grammar to understand it without error. Likewise, understanding these branches of culture is indis-pensable. Th erefore, the learned have greatly elaborated upon them.An Account of How Buddhism Appeared in Other Major Countries [II]Th is section has fi ve parts, accounts of how Buddhism appeared in (1) Shambhala, (2) China, (3) Khotan, (4) Dravida, and (5) other islands.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 430TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4306/14/10 3:51:57 PM6/14/10 3:51:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"a history of buddhist culture \u0003 431Buddhism in Shambhala [A]In Shambhala, the lineage-bearing Buddhist kingsContinuously turn the unsurpassable doctrine’s wheel.Its ninety-six provinces practice the great way’s secret mantra.In the fi ft h of the major countries, Shambhala to the north, Lord of Secrets King Suchandra collected all tantras in general, and in particu-lar he composed a sixty-thousand-verse major commentary to Th e Root Tantra of the Wheel of Time.

He granted empowerment to all of Shambhala’s inhab-itants (including three and a half million brahmin seers, such as the seer Suryarata) in a single sacred circle, and he taught them the tantra. From that time, the kings were known as lineage bearers. Upon Suryarata’s request, Manjushrikirti compiled Th e Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time from Th e Root Tantra of the Wheel of Time.Subsequently, the lineage-bearing monarch Pundarika composed such texts as Th e Stainless Light Commentary to the Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time, an extensive commentary to Th e Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time; and Familiarization with the Ultimate. Th en, successive lineage bearers, each reigning on the vajra throne for a defi nite period of one hun-dred years, continuously turn the wheel of the doctrine of the unsurpass-able way, beginning with the defi nitive secrets of glorious Wheel of Time. Th e gold-turbaned rulers of [Shambhala’s] ninety-six provinces and their inhabitants thus possess the good fortune of practicing the great way’s secret mantra teachings.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 431TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4316/14/10 3:51:57 PM6/14/10 3:51:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"432 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeIn the future, the lineage-bearing kingsWill bring the age of perfection to the twelve parts of the lands of action in succession.In the future, Muslims will increase and take control of most of this lesser Land of Jambu.

In the past, the [fourth] Chou [emperor] Chao Wang had a dream omen inscribed on a stone column. As predicted, pandits Tara and Jvala from India, who had perceived the truth, brought upon a white horse fi ft y-two texts from the lesser way collection and a painting of Shakyamuni made by Udayana. Th ey introduced the doctrine, building the fi rst temple, named Saiwai Si. Th e two pandits attained the state of arhat, and subdued the elements. Many persons renounced home life in faith, and the monastic commu-nity spread widely.In later times, Scholar Kumara was invited to China, and he further spread the doctrine. During the Tang Dynasty, Tang Hsuan Tsang became a disciple of Master Vasubandhu and translated countless teachings of the lesser and great ways. It is said that before him, there had been two hun-dred Chinese translators with the ability to translate the teachings. Since they had translated numerous scriptures, the doctrine became widely propagated and many arhats appeared.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 432TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4326/14/10 3:51:57 PM6/14/10 3:51:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"a history of buddhist culture \u0003 433Between the ascension of the Minyak [Hsi Hsia] and Mongolian [Yuan] dynasties, there were many generations of [Han] Chinese emper-ors.

Th e Hsi Hsia Emperor Tai Hu sent an invitation to the Lord of the Teachings, [the fi rst Karmapa] Dusum Kyenpa, who did not travel himself [to China], but sent Tsang Powa, from whom the ruler received religious instruction.In Mongolia, during the reign of Emperor Ghenghis Khan, Tsangwa Dungkur-wa (a disciple of Zhang Tsalpa Tsöndru Drakpa) traveled to Mongolia and merely encouraged the development of faith [in Bud-dhism] among the shamans. Later, Minyak was taken over by the Mon-gols. Subsequently, Emperor Godan extended an invitation to Sakya Pandit. Following that, the precious lord of the teachings Chög yal Pakpa elucidated the doctrine by giving empowerments, and so on, to Prince Kublai Khan. Also, Mogor Khan extended an invitation to Karma Pak-shi. In this and other ways, Tibet’s doctrines came to receive all manner of patronage.During the later Chinese empire, Emperor Tai Ju [Hung Wu?] of the Ming dynasty invited Virupa and the sixteen elders to his court, and Tai Ming Yunglo invited lord of the teachings [the fi ft h Karmapa] Dézhin Shekpa. Th us, there appeared only emperors who, through their venera-tion, became patrons of Buddhism. During this present Ching dynasty [Kongtrul wrote this in 1862–1864], Emperor Shin Tsi invited all-know-ing Ngawang Lozang Gyatso [the fi ft h Dalai Lama, to the Chinese court]. Th us, Buddhism continues to be venerated and patronized in the present day.Nevertheless, although Chög yal Pakpa granted Emperor Kublai Khan empowerment within the sacred circle of Vajra of Delight, and Dézhin Shekpa granted the Tai Ming emperor [Yunglo] the empowerment and instructions of Great Compassion Ocean of Victors, and it was possible that one or two fortunate individuals practiced secret mantra, it seems that the secret mantra doctrine did not spread to everyone as it has in Tibet. Accordingly, the Chinese collection of the Buddha’s excellent speech does not contain the main tantras of the secret mantra way, apart from a few minor long mantras from action tantras. As such, among the discourses, primarily those of the great way spread, and among those, principally the discourses of the last cycle of teachings.

Th ere, the queen of Ashoka, the Buddhist king of India, had a son named Vasanu, who took control of the land. A long time thereaft er, during King Vijaya Sambhava’s reign, the monk Vairochana and others spread the doctrine, and many stupas and temples were built.

Th e great master Padmakara went there and subdued malevolent tramenma [human-form demons] and bound them under oath three times.

From that time, for one hundred years, many vajra holders from Magadha, Oddiyana, Kashmir, etc., visited and caused the secret mantra way to markedly fl our-ish. Many tantras previously concealed at the time of King Dharmapala and no longer extant in India, or which had been brought from Oddiyana and do not exist in India, can still be found there.It is taught that even now the teaching of the four classes of secret man-tra tantras are widespread there in a genuine form as in earlier times, and there are also a few scriptural traditions of monastic discipline, observed phenomena, and the perfection of sublime insight.Buddhism in Other Islands [E]On the islands of Sri Lanka, Dhanashri, Payigu,Tamra, Java, and others, the great way [spread] a little;Th e lesser way spread widely and continues to exist without decline until the present.Th e Victor’s doctrine also appeared in early times on the islands of Sri Lanka, Dhanashri, Payigu, Tamra, and Java; “others” includes Sumatra.

As the translation of Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet evolved, I watched the text swell alarmingly due to a severe case of endnote-itis. If one were so inclined, there is simply no limit to what can be added to Kongtrul’s text—reams of information and endless details, in fact. As I mentioned in my introduction, I came to the conclusion that whereas my colleagues were justifi ed in decoding their sections of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, the three books translated here could be read by practically everyone just as they were written. My love of every conceivable side story and reference was detracting from the author’s intent, and so many teachers can supply more and better infor-mation in the proper context of instruction using this as a textbook.

A valid criticism that could be leveled at the book is that it should be twice or three times its modest length. Yet for all its concision, the book off ers enough detail to allow us to navigate longer texts on the subject, and more importantly, to grasp references to Buddhist cosmologies as we explore unrelated topics. What we call Buddhism has always taken place within the worlds described in Myriad Worlds; if we are to orient ourselves as residents (or even as tourists) in the Buddha’s cosmos, this book serves as our map.I will present briefl y here some of the places Kongtrul wrote of in Myr-iad Worlds to which he refers in Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet and which he assumes his readership knows from the previous volume.Myriad Worlds begins with the cosmolog y of the great way (the “maha-yana,” rendered as the “universal way” in Myriad Worlds). In a general sense, when Kongtrul set out to describe the Buddha’s appearance in “our world,” he had the great way’s world in mind. What seem most impor-tant to retain from Chapter One of Myriad Worlds are two subjects—that of a specifi c place and that of a particular buddha. We read of the place under the heading “Th e Arrangement of the Realms”; it is called Richly Adorned Realm and is also referred to as Unsurpassed. Th e bud-dha who dwells there is referred to as “Omnipresent Illuminator, Great Glacial Lake of Wisdom.” Kongtrul spends a few pages (Myriad Worlds, pp. 98–101) on details of this realm and buddha to which he will return in the present volume.Apart from gleaning information, a conscientious reader should ideally also come away from exposure to this great way cosmolog y with a specifi c initial impression—something akin to baffl ement, perplexity, and disori-entation. I believe that Kongtrul had a reason to begin Myriad Worlds (not to mention the entire Treasury of Knowledge) with this unreason-able, irrational cosmolog y rather than with that of the staid lesser way which would normally precede it. Here are a few lines from that chapter (square brackets in the original):Moreover, realms as numerous as the atoms in the [entire] realm appear within each atom [of each realm]. Infi nite oceans of [Illuminator’s] forms appear within his one form. Each form appears as though it were pervading all of the infi nite oceans TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 492TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4926/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 493of his forms and realms.

(p. 105)Th is cosmolog y, so confounding at our fi rst appraisal, can eventu-ally generate a genuine sense of awe and wonder. It is anything but tidy or mechanical; it is intricate, unlimited, and marvelous. And it is this cosmolog y that Kongtrul returns to implicitly, if not explicitly, when he introduces us to the Buddha of the great way, the Buddha of the majority of Buddhists.Th e second chapter of Myriad Worlds, entitled “Our Universe,” follows the teachings of a Buddhism of a more modest scope. What we need to take from this chapter is mainly the levels of heavens that fl oat above us, since reference is made to them at diff erent junctures in the Buddha’s life.In this schema, beings live in three realms; we humans and most other life forms inhabit the desire realm. Th e gods who share this realm with us belong to one of six groups, each of which has a horizontal heaven. Th ese are stacked vertically in six levels. Th e lowest is called Four Groups of the Great Kings: the four great kings visited the Buddha aft er his enlighten-ment. Th e next heaven is the Th irty-three [Groups of Gods], where the Buddha’s mother took rebirth. Th e fourth highest is Joyful, where the Buddha lived before his birth in our world. Of the other three—Free from Confl ict, Enjoying Creations, and Mastery Over Others’ Creations—only the last is mentioned in the present book.Th e second of the three realms, called the form realm, is composed entirely of heavens, seventeen in all, grouped in four levels. Farther from our world, these heavens are infrequently mentioned, apart from the fi rst level—three heavens called Group of the Pure, Priests of Brahma, and TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 494TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4946/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 495Great Pure Ones—whose gods sometimes intervene in our world, and the last of the seventeen—Unsurpassed, one of the highest fi ve, which are collectively referred to as the pure domains. Kongtrul ensures that readers will remember Unsurpassed by the end of Book Two, “Th e Light of the World.”Passing reference is made in “Th e Light of the World” to wheel-mon-archs, past rulers of signifi cant portions of the human world. Omens indicated that the Buddha would have become a wheel-monarch had he decided to remain a prince. Myriad Worlds has a section devoted to the history of wheel-monarchs and their conditions of life (pp. 134–138).Th e third chapter of Myriad Worlds presents a cosmolog y based upon the tantras of the Wheel of Time. Although Kongtrul states at the outset that “Th is tantra refutes the erroneous descriptions of space and time based on” both non-Buddhist and elementary Buddhist systems, he did not draw from this chapter in writing the chapters included in Buddhism’s Journey to Tibet. Nor does the fourth chapter, “Th e Causes of Cyclic Life,” echo in the present volume. Th at chapter and Myriad Worlds’ last, “Th e Primordial Purity of the Universe,” do not purport to present cosmolog y but rather the mechanics of the wheel of life. As Kongtrul states at the beginning of “Th e Causes of Cyclic Life,” he set out to describe “the causes and conditions that produce deception [within cyclic life] and those that eff ect liberation” (p. 203). Th is Kongtrul does in one of the densest and most challenging chapters in the entire Treasury of Knowledge if one is not already familiar with the ideas he presents there in an incredibly concise form. Th e larger picture of the great perfection cosmolog y that frames the theory and practice he writes of in “Th e Primordial Purity of the Universe” can be found in “Enlightenment’s Bodies and Pure Realms,” Chapter Four of “Th e Light of the World.”Book Two: The Light of the WorldChapter One: Our Teacher’s Path to AwakeningMyriad Worlds sets a stage—the cosmos—and introduces an infi nite sup-porting cast—sentient beings. Now enters the hero, the Buddha, referred to in familiar, aff ectionate, almost possessive terms, as “our Teacher.” Nevertheless this Buddha of ours is not unique, far from it. However familiar the template of one son of God or one prophet might be in TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 495TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4956/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"496 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeother religions, Kongtrul helps Buddhists shake free from it at the outset of “Th e Light of the World.” Under its chapter’s fi rst heading, “Distin-guishing Our Teacher from Buddhas in General,” he introduces us to the cosmos as populated with buddhas in incalculable numbers, destined to appear in world-systems such as our own for as long as space exists. In fact, the fi rst sentence of the entire text of Th e Treasury of Knowledge reads, “Oceans of realms have arisen from the relationship between those to be guided to enlightenment [sentient beings], and the enlightened guides [the buddhas]” (Myriad Worlds, p. 95). Th e interplay between enlight-ened and unenlightened beings itself produces what we experience as our world.Under the second heading in this chapter, “A Concise Presentation of the Story of the Buddha’s Liberation,” we fi nd another major challenge to non-Buddhist concepts of space and time, and of the Buddha’s life: “Ulti-mately, our compassionate Teacher has been manifestly awakened since time immemorial. He appeared throughout past, present, and future as various buddhas and bodhisattvas, acting for the welfare of beings.” Fur-ther, the genuinely dramatic events of the Buddha’s life—his abdication of the throne, his astounding austerities, his defeat of demons, his enlight-enment, and his teaching—are referred to here as, for example, his having “demonstrated manifest, complete enlightenment.” He merely showed us how it is done; he had done it all before (as had so many other buddhas) and, according to Kongtrul, will do it again until the end of time.Two parts of this chapter present diff erent stories of the Buddha’s fi rst step on the spiritual path that eventually led to enlightenment. We read of him as everything from a majestic wheel-monarch to a hapless soul tormented in the hells. Each tale relates how he fi rst decided to embark on the course that would lead to awakening as a buddha. At the end, Kongtrul comments,Th us, the lesser and great ways diff er in regard to our Teach-er’s initial development of the mind of awakening, and even within the great way, the discourses present many diff erent ac-counts. Evidently, these are taught with many diff ering under-lying intents, such as suitability in relation to disciples’ specifi c times, circumstances, or mentalities; or in relation to diff erent aspects of the mind of awakening—aspiration, application, or ultimate. Th erefore, rigid adherence to a single viewpoint, as if TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 496TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4966/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 497to say, “Th is event alone marked the Buddha’s initial develop-ment of the mind of awakening,” while fi tting them into a set chronological order, is pointless.As with this issue, so with many others: Kongtrul, echoing the Buddhist masters before him, asks us to suspend our desire for tidy narratives. Th e Buddha we chance to meet—his story, his character, his teaching—has far more to do with us than it does with the Buddha. We live within the bounds of material reality, of predictable space and time, and of linear personal narratives, all of which we conscientiously attend to, persuaded as we are of their obvious reality. While it may seem that any other atti-tude is unreasonable, buddhas and bodhisattvas do not seem to share our views and beliefs. For example, to answer our straightforward and practi-cal question, “How long does it take to arrive at the end of the path?” we might receive any number of answers, as Kongtrul explains:In some cases, the period spent [on the path to awakening ] is said to be long ; vast accumulations of merit and wisdom are taught to show how diffi cult it is for a buddha to appear. Th ere are some who become indolent and do not enter [the path of ] supreme awakening [when considering ] such [a long period]; thus, to make them enter it, the period is said to be short. Further, the time can be unspecifi ed, to demonstrate that ultimately, numbers and enumeration lack an intrinsic nature, and to present the inconceivable ultimate nature, such as that time’s multiplicity does not contradict its unity and that time’s multiplicity converges into one. [Th ese presenta-tions] are suitable due to many purposes; do not consider them contradictory.Buddhist teachings might seem contradictory to the point of incoher-ence, but each system of Buddhism refl ects the needs of those addressed. Buddhism is not mysterious, but what it describes—the nature of reality, the nature of our being—is. Buddhist wisdom is not complicated, but the dispositions and characters of sentient beings—those it must lead to enlightenment—are. Th e buddhas themselves, however, may in fact be inscrutable, since even their own path to enlightenment amounts to a display they deploy intending to inspire and guide us. Kongtrul answers TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 497TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4976/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"498 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe understandable question, “What did the Buddha do when on the spiritual path?” with a variety of answers, of which the most typical might be this:. . . he engaged in four forms of conduct: for those devoted to the great way, the conduct of the ten transcendent perfec-tions; for those devoted to the lesser way, the conduct of the thirty-seven aspects of awakening ; for those devoted to both, the conduct of clairvoyance to inspire them through his pow-ers; and to guide all, the conduct of bringing sentient beings to spiritual maturity.In other words, even on the spiritual path, the Buddha appeared to act in ways that refl ected the needs or corresponded to the aspirations of others.Kongtrul mentions three “schools” of Buddhist thought by name, here rendered as materialist, substantialist, and majority. All three belong to the lesser way; some readers may be familiar with them by their Sanskrit or Tibetan names. Th e translation “materialist school” for “jédrak mawa” (bye brag smra ba; Vaibhashika) is based on this quote in Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy: “Because they state that [the phenomena] of the three times exist as discrete particular substances . . . they are referred to as such [that is, as Vaibhashikas, Proponents of Particular (Substances)]” (p. 124; brackets in the original).Th e translation “substantialist school” for “zhi tamché yöpar mawa” (gzhi thams cad yod par smra ba; Mulasarvastivadin) is based on this quote in Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy: “Mulasarvastivadins (. . . Proponents of the Existence of All Bases) are known by that name because. . . they state that the fi ve bases . . . , which are knowable objects, exist. . . substantially” (p. 136).Th e translation “majority school” for “gendun pal chenpa” (dge ’dun dpal chen pa; Mahasanghika) is based on this quote in Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy: “Mahasanghika (. . . Majority of the Community) are referred to as such because, at the time of the split, the majority of the sangha formed this group” (p. 136).Th e important points to retain from this chapter are some of the cen-tral beliefs of the great way concerning the Buddha: that he belongs to an infi nite community of enlightened beings, and specifi cally to a group of one thousand who each in turn over the course of millennia appear in TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 498TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 4986/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 499our world in the guise of ones who start with the aspiration to awaken, follow the path, then demonstrate the process of enlightenment, all the while having already gained manifest awakening since the dawn of time. While this belief challenges us, serious consideration and adoption of it serve at the very least to loosen our rigid views of space and time, self and other, so we will be better able to appreciate deeper truths of the Buddha’s appearance in the world, such as are presented later in this book.Contrast the scope of this, most Buddhists’ Buddha, with a common but far narrower view of who the Buddha was: a very good man whose dedication and sacrifi ce led him during the course of his lifetime to spiri-tual realization and to a career of teaching that had a major impact on human history. As sympathetic to Buddhism as this second view might be, and as easily digestible as it is, many Buddhists would not recognize it as our own. Moreover, confi ning the Buddha to the status of the most excellent among human beings does not allow us to begin to comprehend the wealth of Buddhist wisdom that describes the appearance of enlight-enment in the world. Th e ideas Kongtrul sets forth in this and the follow-ing chapters create an essential entryway leading to the understanding of passages such as this (from one of Kongtrul’s source texts), which begins with a quote from the Buddha then continues with a commentary by Longchenpa:Th e Amassing of the Rare and Sublime states:O Shantimati, from the night that I awakened to manifestly perfect buddhahood to the night that I pass into nirvana, I will not have spoken even a single syllable of spiritual teachings.Some ignorant people say that this means he did not teach in the ultimate sense, only in the relative sense. But they seem to be confused about what is actually so—that enlightened speech, which is beyond words and letters, seems to be ex-pressed in words and letters that conform to the perceptions of beings . . . When those to be guided diff er in three ways—in terms of bias, character, and interest—what each of them hears the Tathagata speak will be a diff erent teaching, and all of these teachings will occur simultaneously.

Among all the things the Buddha did during his lifetime, this was the signal act. What happened, and how did it hap-pen, that he sat down one day as a sentient being and rose from the same seat as the Buddha, the awakened one? For Buddhists, this central ques-tion has two points of interest. We wish to comprehend as best we can the Buddha’s experience, for therein lies our ideal, the cornerstone of our faith. Yet we nurture faith not only in another’s success, no matter how exalted, but also in our own ability to tread the path to become in turn buddhas, fully awakened ones.Nevertheless, this specifi c chapter is not about us. Kongtrul recounts only Buddha Shakyamuni’s enlightenment, not enlightenment as a gen-eral subject. In the last chapters of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, in Books Nine and Ten, Kongtrul tells us our story: how we will progress through the stages of awakening that culminate in full enlightenment. And he spends hundreds of pages doing so, as well he might. For as much as we revere and worship the Buddha, and the countless men and women who have followed him to the ultimate goal, Buddhism’s purpose has always been to serve as a vehicle to liberation for ordinary sentient beings. We begin, however, by examining how that liberation was gained in the past.Kongtrul tells us that the Buddha’s enlightenment can be explained according to the lesser way, the great way, and secret mantra, or tantric, teachings. At the outset of his presentation of the lesser way’s beliefs, he slips an astounding statement into his narrative without further explanation:At the end of that time, he repeated a verse of praise to Buddha Star Monarch unceasingly for seven days, an act which equaled nine ages of accumulation. (emphasis added)TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 500TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5006/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 501We have read in the previous chapter how the lesser way’s version of the Buddha’s path to enlightenment was characterized by veneration of enlightened beings over countless ages. Here we fi nd that all forms of veneration are not of equal value. Th at diff erent acts or spiritual practices can have radically diff erent eff ects—a week of one equaling nine ages of others, in this instance—is an idea that both the great way and tantra develop liberally in their literature.Under the heading of the great way’s perspective, we read of how the Buddha merely demonstrates the process of enlightenment in this world, something he has done and will do repeatedly. Kongtrul quotes the Bud-dha in an important discourse:In the past, countless ages ago, in a world-system that united as many realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, I attained enlightenment as Transcendent Buddha Crown of the Pow-erful One, aided beings, and transcended sorrow. Th en once again, from that point until the present age, I have repeatedly demonstrated the inconceivable process of enlightenment.I will continue, until cyclic existence is empty, to demon-strate [this process of ] enlightenment beginning with the initial development of the mind of awakening as an ordinary being.While such statements do not help us grasp the nature of the Buddha’s enlightenment, they do underline the fact that enlightenment is a specifi c experience, the result of a known and knowable process that the Bud-dha deliberately demonstrates time and again so that we might follow his example, no guesswork involved.Kongtrul then introduces an iconic place he will return to through-out this chapter, the true location of the Buddha’s enlightenment, called Unsurpassed Realm. Th is information relegates the traditional setting of awakening, Vajra Seat (located in the small north-central Indian village Bodhgaya), to the rank of a place where he merely re-enacted a previously gained enlightenment. If we read Th e Treasury of Knowledge in the order Kongtrul wrote it, we will have already read of Unsurpassed in the fi rst few pages of Myriad Worlds, where Kongtrul gives the best defi nition of the realm:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 501TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5016/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"502 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeEnlightenment is attained when the naturally pure sphere of reality [of the mind] is freed of adventitious defi lements, and the sphere of reality becomes inseparable from pristine wisdom.

(p. 98)Th ese excellent sentences stand alongside countless priceless explana-tions found in the best Buddhist writing, including Kongtrul’s: succinct, simple, and profound. But in this case, we soon discover terrible conse-quences of the choice of this name for the highest realm imaginable. A hint of the headaches to follow can be found in these words from the paragraph immediately following the fi rst mention of Unsurpassed in the present chapter:Some assert that aft er he attained enlightenment in Unsur-passed Richly Adorned Realm, he demonstrated the process of enlightenment in the Unsurpassed of the pure domains [in the gods’ heavens].As rich and varied as Buddhist nomenclature normally appears to be, it saddled itself with the same name for a pure realm and the highest of sev-enteen heavens of the gods’ form realm. We read in Myriad Worlds:[Th e latter fi ve heavens are the] “pure domains”. . . Unsurpassed is so called because within this group of heavens no heaven surpasses the qualities of this one . . . Asanga’s Five Treatises on the Stages states that the Place of the Great Lords, where [bodhisattvas] who have attained mastery of the tenth stage [of awakening ] take birth, is located above Unsurpassed. (pp. 120–121)Th e fi nal sentence of the section presenting the great way perspective on enlightenment reveals the ambivalence that results from this confusion in place names. Where we might expect a conclusive ending statement con-cerning the site of the most sublime experience, we read instead,TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 502TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5026/14/10 3:51:59 PM6/14/10 3:51:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 503Some evidently identify “Unsurpassed Realm”. . . as an Unsur-passed Realm that is higher than another located among the pure gods’ realms, and that it was only there that he fi rst at-tained enlightenment.Kongtrul returns to this subject at length at the end of “Th e Buddha’s Enlightenment” since Unsurpassed Realm fi gures as well in the tantras’ account of the Buddha’s enlightenment.In the section on the great way, Kongtrul mentions an event that takes on a central importance in the secret mantra: “In his fi nal lifetime in Unsurpassed Realm, [the Buddha] received the empowerment of great radiance fr om the ten directions’ victors, a vajra-like meditative state arose within him, and he attained enlightenment as the body of perfect rap-ture” (emphasis added).Th e Buddha continues to attain enlightenment, but the process changes, and as diff erent elements are introduced to that process, the path we follow in his footsteps also changes. If empowerment provided the catalyst to the Buddha’s enlightenment, empowerment becomes central to our path. We read in the section on the action and conduct tantras’ view of his enlightenment, “[the Buddha] engaged in tantric conduct, [and as a result] manifestly achieved awakening’s tenth stage. . .” (brackets added); tantric conduct then becomes the prescribed path. Under the heading of yoga tantra, we read that “his wisdom body went to Unsurpassed” and aft er attaining enlightenment there, “he re-entered his [human] body of ripened acts, then demonstrated the process of enlight-enment.” And we notice marked diff erences in brief accounts of the Bud-dha’s development:Th e ten directions’ joyful buddhasTurned him away from that unimpeded mental state,And taught him nondual profound clarity,Pure like the sphere of space.Th us, at midnight he was like a victor;By meditating on that state,He attained genuine realization in an instant at dawn.and, from the yoga tantras themselves:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 503TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5036/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"504 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh ey granted him the empowerment of the eclipse of sun and moon,And revealed the sweet savor of enjoyment:He became a transcendent buddha, gone to suchness.Under the heading of the highest yoga tantras’ view of the Buddha’s enlightenment, Kongtrul asserts that the following words represent the defi nitive or ultimate meaning :. . . a bodhisattva in his fi nal lifetime in the supreme Unsur-passed Realm engaged in the exceptional profound path’s immediate cause and used such means as the fi ve branches of manifest awakening to attain enlightenment as Buddha Vajra Bearer. Even when his emanation demonstrated the process of enlightenment in Magadha, in the Land of Jambu, he trav-eled the path of the immediate cause, such as enjoyment of his circle of queens, and reached the limits of renunciation and realization.We have come light-years from the fi rst story of the Buddha’s enlight-enment just a few pages before, where Kongtrul related the lesser way’s version:During his fi nal lifetime, as Prince Siddharta, although he had perfected the accumulations during three incalculable ages, his physical support was merely at the highest [stage of the] path of accumulation, with all the limitations of an ordinary being , until he sat at Vajra Seat.

Only at that very place and time did the path of realization of the four noble truths’ sixteen aspects, such as impermanence, have him reach the end of the four [re-maining ] paths—preparation, seeing, meditation, and beyond training. With knowledge of extinguishing and non-arising, he attained enlightenment.Two statements in this version bear repeating to contrast them with every other version that followed: that the Buddha had “all the limitations of TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 504TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5046/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 505an ordinary being . . . until he sat at Vajra Seat” and that “only at that very place and time” did he attain enlightenment.It’s possible that most Buddhists know that story and honor the Bud-dha there portrayed, yet when Buddhists of any path apart from the lesser way set out to practice their religion, this basic story is not necessarily the most helpful. Beliefs matter. If the story of the Buddha who was a normal human being until enlightenment is the only one that is credible to us, we must align ourselves with the path that corresponds to that belief. Or, should we fi nd our natural affi nity is with Buddhist practices or medita-tions other than that of the lesser way, it seems reasonable to inform our-selves of the belief system upon which those practices are founded.Kongtrul and the masters who preceded and followed him whom we identify as non-sectarian saw value in the views, paths, and results of all levels of Buddhist practice. Th eir open-mindedness and syncretic vision did not, however, tolerate incoherence or dissonance between an individ-ual’s view or belief system, the basis of their faith, and the path that person then cultivated in study and meditation. Th is is not to say that Kongtrul or the others did not incorporate elements of the lesser way, great way, or various levels of tantras into their daily personal spiritual practice. Th ey most certainly did. Yet each had a guiding set of beliefs and principles that gave coherence to the whole, the higher levels of Buddhist theory and practice tending to absorb and re-situate the lower ones. For example, in the case of the Buddha’s enlightenment, the great way and tantras do not negate the earlier account, but they reframe the whole story as the Bud-dha’s enactment in this world of an enlightenment he attained at another place and time.A parallel reframing occurs in Buddhist practice when acts of medi-tation or forms of behavior conceptualized at one level of practice are done with such radically diff erent attitudes or views that they are entirely re-imagined and re-contextualized. One of the more surprising examples of this can be found in a passage above where Kongtrul states that the Buddha “engaged in the exceptional profound path’s immediate cause and used such means as the fi ve branches of manifest awakening to attain enlightenment as Buddha Vajra Bearer,” then later, when living in this world to demonstrate enlightenment, “even then . . . he traveled the path of the immediate cause, such as enjoyment of his circle of queens.” “Imme-diate cause” and “fi ve branches of manifest awakening” are evidently tantric code words and terms, the fi rst referring to sexual intercourse in TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 505TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5056/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"506 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgetantric practice, thus the reference to the period of the future Buddha’s married life in the palace. As for the fi ve branches of manifest awakening, this term typically refers to elements in the phase of creation meditation, yet Kongtrul explains the term in a passage close to the end of Th e Trea-sury of Knowledge, relocating it in a manner that corresponds to his use of it here. Th e following translation enters this book through the kindness of Richard Barron, whose terminolog y diff ers slightly from what readers fi nd in this book (“ganacakra feast” corresponds to “vajra feast”; “Anut-tarayoga,” to “highest yoga”; “bindu,” to “vital essence”; “mahasiddhas,” to “accomplished masters”; “Guhyasamaja,” to “Matrix of Mystery”; and most importantly, “manifest enlightenment,” to “manifest awakening”).[W ]hen twilight falls, one begins by performing a ganacakra feast and other rituals, and then joins one’s consort in suppli-cating one’s spiritual master. Th e master confers the empower-ment into sublime knowing and timeless awareness, and then teaches the participants the instructions that introduce one to the stages for attaining manifest enlightenment through the anticipatory phase of timeless awareness. Th is leads to the fourth stage of empowerment: by familiarizing oneself with the ongoing experience of that phase, at dawn the path of seeing (which constitutes manifest enlightenment) becomes fully evident.10 Th is process is described in both the father and mother classes of the Anuttarayoga tantras.If we consider the explanations given by the mahasiddhas who were learned in the mother tantras, the process is as fol-lows: When the empowerment is conferred, one engages in union with one’s consort (who embodies sublime knowing ). From the melting of the white energ y comes consummate insight into supremely blissful emptiness; this insight consti-tutes the aspect of “manifest enlightenment through the lunar energ y.” When the bindu is drawn upward together with the red energ y of the consort (the woman who embodies sublime knowing ), it is the support for the consummate and experi-10.

Due to the suchness itself of things, enlightened mind expresses itself as dharmakaya, while enlightened form expresses itself as sambhogakaya; this constitutes the aspect of “manifest enlightenment through the totality of the kayas.”. . . Th e previous interpretation [common to the father and mother tantras] concerns a process of transformation taking place in one’s ongoing experience. Th e latter interpretation, although not clearly laid out in the Guhyasamaja cycle, is the tradition followed in the mother tantras. In the context of one awakening to buddhahood, even an ordinary person engaged in the conduct of the immediate cause11 awakens to buddha-hood by relying on such conduct. (excerpt from Book Ten, “An Analysis of the Consummate Fruition State,” in Chapter Th ree, “Th e Fruition in the Vajrayana”)Kongtrul has emphasized in this chapter, “Th e Buddha’s Enlightenment,” how this process constitutes all buddhas’ path to enlightenment accord-ing to the tantras. To reiterate that point at the other end of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, he underlines that in the highest yoga tantras “it is said that even though one may have traversed the ten bodhisattva levels of the transcendent perfections, up to the point at which one is in one’s fi nal rebirth, still one must defi nitely rely on this tantric path of the fi ve aspects of manifest enlightenment.”11.

Kongtrul includes the writings of an Indian master, Buddhaguhya, and those of two Tibetans, Longchenpa and Taranata, two of his principal sources. Each of these three masters gives a diff erent interpretation of this true site of enlightenment, and Kongtrul evidently approves of each. Th is section does not make for easy reading ; we get the sense of what Kongtrul refers to when he remarks, “Tibetan scholars have produced a proliferation of explanations, refuta-tions, and assertions concerning Unsurpassed Realm.” Try as he might to spare us the details, the subject is crucial and deserves our attention. I do not have the impression that the subject of Unsurpassed Realm and the view of the Buddha that underlies it has had much impact on popular Buddhism outside Asia.Translators of great way or tantric texts into non-Buddhist languages are oft en faced with the fact that the idea of the Buddha’s life as a mere “demonstration of the process” of treading the spiritual path, or of enlight-enment, etc., is so embedded in Buddhist language and thought that the term (in Tibetan, “tsul ten”; tshul bstan) is used casually and ubiquitously without any further remarks. We are conscious that many new Bud-dhists, even those drawn to the great way or to elementary tantric prac-tice, would be uncomfortable in considering the Buddha to be anything but an exemplary human being whose life was lived only on physical and mental planes that resemble our own. Th at is to say, they believe natu-rally in what could be identifi ed by and large as the lesser way view. Few northern Asians of the great way or tantric persuasions base their faith and their path on such a Buddha.Th e re-location of the Buddha’s enlightenment from Vajra Seat, a place rooted in human geography, to a pure realm would seem to have the felicitous eff ect of opening up the site of enlightenment and experience to all Buddhists. Very few beings become Buddha in the sense that the thousand buddhas of our age do—always as a male, always as a member of Indian caste society, and always at the same, specifi c place: Vajra Seat in north central India. Conversely, when the majority of Buddhists affi rm Unsurpassed Realm as the one and only place where all beings attain enlightenment, any being regardless of race, age, gender, social status, or country of origin can turn their aspirations there for an enlightenment even in this very body and lifetime, since that realm is open to us all.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 508TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5086/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 509Chapter Th ree: Th e Buddha’s Twelve DeedsTh is title seems to promise the tamest and the most traditional chapter of “Th e Light of the World,” or even of the entire Treasury of Knowledge, and that proves to be the case. Buddhists of all hues cherish in awe and rever-ence this twelve-part story of the Buddha’s life. As usual in Buddhism, there are diff erences in details between various schools’ versions; Kong-trul’s treatment resolutely follows the great way view.Th e classic story of the Buddha’s life begins with his departure from his previous life as the teacher to bodhisattvas in one of the heavens, Joy-ful, so called because there “the gods are [fi lled] with joy [at hearing ] the teaching of the victorious one” (Myriad Worlds, pp. 118–119). Joyful is the fourth of six heavens located in the desire realm, not especially exalted among heavens, yet only there are Buddhist teachings heard. Th e future Buddha leaves the heavens for India, where all buddhas take rebirth, to demonstrate the process of enlightenment. Aft er his conception, which would appear to be immaculate—he enters his mother’s womb while she stays in retreat and observes eight precepts, including celibacy—he uses his period of gestation to bring “thirty-six hundred billion gods and humans to spiritual maturity.” As we’ve seen in the previous chapter, all these twelve deeds occur aft er the Buddha’s enlightenment in Unsur-passed Realm. Th us, claims of the Buddha’s impact on the worlds of gods and humanity even while in the womb are not rhetorical fl ourishes to be skimmed over by sophisticated readers: for adherents to the great way and tantra, who include Kongtrul, these are indeed the deeds of the Buddha as he enters this world.One curious omission in the story involves the Buddha’s mother. She delivered the Buddha from “her right side, without harm . . . ,” and is always portrayed in childbirth standing, her right hand gripping the branch of a tree above her. She did not survive long aft er giving birth, just one week, thus the thirty-two wet nurses who cared in her absence for the child Buddha. Later in life, he would spend one summer retreat teaching his mother in the heavens, where she was reborn.Th e birth scene includes a description of the newborn Buddha taking seven steps in each of the four cardinal directions and making declara-tions. Th is underlines that this child was not a prodig y who had a great future ahead of him, but an enlightened being whose every gesture was meaningful for all who encountered him, then or now.

Appearing to train under the grammarian Vishvamitra, he revealed many subjects the names of which his teacher had never heard” (emphasis added). Later, in the fi ft h deed, which is his marriage to three women and their coterie, a total of sixty thousand or eight-four thousand queens, Kongtrul, who men-tioned this period in the last chapter as the Buddha’s demonstration of traveling “the path of the immediate cause,” here states that his practice on that path in turn “brought his circle of queens to full spiritual maturity within awakening.”With the sixth deed, we enter more familiar territory with the tale of the Buddha’s renunciation and departure from life at his father’s palace. Again, instead of the future Buddha feeling true anguish at the sight of aging, sickness, and death, and being fatefully intrigued by a mendicant, Kongtrul has him “show signs of disillusionment.” Incidentally, “show” does not imply that he feigned that disillusionment.In the seventh deed, the future Buddha’s period of extreme austerity, we read that instead of him trying severe disciplines and concluding them futile, he “sought out those who affi rmed that there are karmic causes [for liberation] and who aspired to follow misleading [austere] disciplines. Seeing that [he could fulfi ll] many purposes, such as showing that [such beliefs and practices] did not lead to liberation, he passed six years on the Nairanjana River bank in the same crossed-legged posture” (empha-sis added). Kongtrul has here slipped an important idea into the narra-tive—that the Buddha would later teach (according to some) that karmic causes do not produce liberation or enlightenment, thus his engagement in spiritual practice at this point in his life to refute the contrary view. Further, we read of his unimaginable austerities as only proving points rather than representing a path he once wholeheartedly believed in but would subsequently discard.Th e eighth, ninth, and tenth deeds—the Buddha’s walk to the Heart of Awakening , his defeat of demons, and his enlightenment—all portray him as one who enacts or reenacts the mystery of enlightenment as one among countless buddhas in a universe that moves in concert with him. Even his encounter with hordes of demons results from his intentional challenge, rather than being due to inner egoistic aggression and attach-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 510TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5106/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 511ment he needed to confront before he could be free to attain enlight-enment. Not the slightest trace can be found here of an individual who evinces “all the limitations of an ordinary being.”Th e eleventh deed, the Buddha’s teaching, holds the most signifi cance for Buddhists. It is said that buddhas sometimes appear in this world but do not teach, which consigns those historical periods to ones of miser-able darkness. In the case of our Buddha, he at fi rst decides to not teach, faced with the impossibility of articulating his experience intelligibly. He memorably remarks:Deep, tranquil, unformulated, non-composite clear light:Th is ambrosia-like reality I have gainedIs unfathomable by anyone I might teach.Th us in silence will I dwell at the forest’s edge.Only aft er three entreaties on the part of the gods does he consent to teach. Th is threefold request has become standard in Buddhism; traditionally, teachers do not teach unless asked, and not until the third request. It was only when the Buddha taught that the three jewels, all Buddhists’ place of refuge, appeared in our world: the Buddha, his Teaching, and the Spiri-tual Community.Th e last deed is the Buddha’s transcendence of sorrow, nirvana, and even here he “demonstrates” rather than undergoes that fi nal act. We note that here, as oft en, the cause of his passing (accidental food poisoning ) is left unmentioned, which contrasts so dramatically with Christianity, in which the birth and death of Jesus seem to have become the central events in that religion’s collective lived memory and are refl ected in its practice. In Buddhism, the Buddha’s enlightenment and teaching far outshine any other event in his life.Th is chapter ends with the keys to much of what Kongtrul has pre-sented to this point in “Th e Light of the World”: his perspective on coher-ence and consistency in presenting the Buddha’s life. Th e basic problem, or tension, lies in the confl icting demands of writing that prizes histori-cal accuracy and writing that refl ects genuine spiritual insight. Kongtrul asserts that these two demands are irreconcilable and that accounts of the Buddha’s life written from either perspective must be kept separate from the other:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 511TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5116/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"512 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeMajor diff erences in scope exist between the great and lesser ways. However, since the pious attendant system records what all the Buddha’s common disciples witnessed, it has become prevalent and accepted. When [the Buddha’s deeds] are pre-sented, the two perspectives must be diff erentiated and un-mixed; composite, blended versions should not be taught.Kongtrul and Taranata, whom he quotes at length in summation, state that each account is equally valid, but that each must be appreciated within its own context. Kongtrul quotes Taranata to reiterate:Th e system of the common Buddhist way (or pious attendant system) gives the account of the Buddha’s activity and deeds in the world as they appeared in common to all who were in the vicinity of the Buddha’s presence and were apt [witnesses]—including those holding wrong views, non-Buddhists, or even animals. Th e great way discourses relate how the deeds ap-peared in the experience of disciples for whom the extraordi-nary great way was taught. As a result, [the two systems] have diff erent enumerations of the deeds in general, and in par-ticular, very marked diff erences in scope. Th erefore, although these two systems are not fundamentally contradictory, their styles of teaching must not be mixed.If the fi rst historical account refl ects what anyone could have seen, includ-ing even animals, it necessarily excludes the Buddha’s own visionary expe-rience, which even the great way does not pretend to describe. Further, a straight historical narrative also discounts or marginalizes the visionary experience of disciples who were suffi ciently mature to meet the Buddha mind-to-mind rather than just face-to-face.It is clear that Kongtrul has written of the Buddha’s life from the great way perspective; I have tried above to show how Kongtrul’s use of lan-guage and his interpretation of events signal that intent. Taranata defends that choice—to eschew a “fact”-based narrative in favor of a visionary one—in these words:Comparing the two systems’ [accounts of the Buddha’s twelve deeds], the great way’s account is superior to the pious at-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 512TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5126/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 513tendant system for various reasons: it is vaster; it relates the domain of experience of inconceivable wisdom; it refl ects the perceptions of sublime disciples; it relates the esoteric story of his liberation; the great way itself has diff erent levels [of ac-counts], and so forth.Th e lesser way’s perspective is not without merit, since, as Taranata continues:. . . only the common system [of the lesser way] provides a basis for various points of enquiry, such as what existed in the com-mon perception of all individuals [at that time], the Buddha’s life span, the chronolog y [of the events of his life], and asser-tions that the Buddha traveled to one place and did not travel to another.Th e great way system cannot serve in that way. It is the do-main of the inconceivable: it is diffi cult for it to provide set limits, such as, “Th ese alone were the Buddha’s places of resi-dence, historical period, and deeds.” Th erefore, the system of the common Buddhist way is defi nitely of primary signifi cance when writing history.For some in the modern world, Buddhism answers a need for a non-the-istic, humanistic spirituality that is not antagonistic to much of the latest science, psycholog y, or technolog y. It is entirely possible that some forms of Buddhism correspond to those expectations. I cannot say; my own areas of knowledge in Buddhism are woefully limited. What does seem apparent to me is that to expect dispassionate hard facts and verifi able, detached historical writing concerning the Buddha from Kongtrul and his sources betrays wishful thinking. Th ey give a purely materialistic view its due, but they wrote and taught to prepare us for and to lead us to the domain of the inconceivable and the unimaginable, which is the subject of the next chapter.Chapter Four: Enlightenment’s Bodies and Pure RealmsIn Th e Words of My Perfect Teacher, Patrul Rinpoché tells the story of two frogs, one who had always lived in a well, and another who came to visit TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 513TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5136/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"514 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgefrom his home at the edge of an ocean. Th at any body of water could be larger than a well strained the fi rst frog’s credulity, but he agreed to accompany his friend to the ocean, whereupon, “he fainted, his head split apart, and he died” (p. 140).To this point, I have tried to bring to the reader’s attention the language that Kongtrul used to portray the Buddha and his life. While Kongtrul’s style of telling a story all Buddhists are familiar with might to us seem subversive, his language and its implications conformed to the belief sys-tem of virtually his entire readership. Th e Buddhists of the Himalayas can be counted as adherents of the great way at the very least, if not of the tantras, and those with any exposure to their faith’s fundamental beliefs would recognize Kongtrul’s Buddha as their own. In these chapters, we could say that he preached to or wrote for the choir. I have dwelled on the ideas that he assumed his readers would have already assimilated since at the time of this translation it is my impression that some converts to Himalayan tantric Buddhism and some of their nascent spiritual com-munities outside the Himalayas have not reviewed the life of the Bud-dha in the light of their maturing faith and practice. In a few years’ time, such reexamination of the implications of Kongtrul’s use of language may indeed seem dated, superfl uous, and irrelevant.Whether or not we are challenged by Kongtrul’s portrayal of the Bud-dha, he and we are still plumbing the depths of the same, somewhat famil-iar well. With this fourth chapter of “Th e Light of the World,” we leave that well to ponder the ocean.Th is chapter’s treatment of the Buddha’s appearance in the world pro-vides the necessary framework of beliefs for persons engaging in the prac-tice of meditations of great perfection, what Kongtrul identifi es as the culmination of the nine Buddhist ways. To each path its own Buddha, but we do not have to read far to grasp why this path and its Buddha have a chapter to themselves. In the previous chapters, we understood that Buddha Shakyamuni is believed in the great way and in the tantras to be an emanation of a being who attained enlightenment in another place, Unsurpassed Realm, eons in the past. Yet that original enlightened being and that enlightenment were not explicitly described. Here, we trace enlightenment back to its source, Buddha Ever Excellent; outline his enlightenment; and introduce his emanation—Buddha Vajra Bearer; another emanation, Buddha Great Glacial Lake; and further emanations, including , fi nally, our Teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 514TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5146/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 515Two challenges await the reader: fi rst and most daunting, a fresh set of ideas; second, a new vocabulary. What might be of some solace is the fact that well-dwellers before us—those trained in any of the eight lower Buddhist ways—all fi nd their initial exposure to great perfection, the full breadth of Buddhism at its apex, bracing , if not confounding , disorient-ing, and destabilizing. As a translator, I usually feel some responsibility to aid readers unfamiliar with ideas and words in a given text, but here I can only off er the very fl imsiest of guides. Th e only sure help anyone (includ-ing this translator who is at home only in the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage tradition) can get for this chapter is that off ered by a qualifi ed teacher of great perfection.Kongtrul begins by describing the enlightenment of the original bud-dha, Ever Excellent:Th e basis of being dawned as manifest appearances from basic space, self-arisen wisdom, buddha nature, the original ground. At the very moment those appearances arose from the basis of being, [Ever Excellent] recognized them as his own manifesta-tions; thus, his self-arisen wisdom of awareness was liberated on the basis of being, in its own ground.Kongtrul described the same process in the fi nal chapter of Myriad Worlds. (In the following passage from that book, “basis of being” appears as “ground” or “ground of being”; “delusion,” as “deception”; “Ever Excel-lent,” as “Ever Perfect.” Square brackets are in the original.)Liberation as the [primordial buddha] occurs in the following way: Th e instant the ground’s manifestations arise, one does not apprehend them as something else but rather recognizes them as one’s own inner radiance. Consequently, the move-ment [of constructive thoughts] ceases in itself: at the fi rst in-stant [of movement], the recognition that the manifestations are inner radiance causes realization to dawn. Th is realization defi nes the diff erence [between liberation and deception].Immediately thereaft er, deception is dispelled and pristine wisdom unfolds. At this point, the ground fully develops into the result [i.e., awakening ]. Th is is re-enlightenment, the real-ization of primordial enlightenment within one’s own nature.

[Th e personifi ca-tion of ] this awakening is the enlightened guide known as Ever Perfect. (p. 211)Just as Shakyamuni’s enlightenment process, however variously it is portrayed, anticipates the path sentient beings must take to gain libera-tion, Buddha Ever Excellent’s original enlightenment, his reaching of the “youthful vase body,” shows how enlightenment is attained for those treading the path of great perfection.Kongtrul follows his description of Ever Excellent’s enlightenment with a section entitled “How Buddha Ever Excellent Created Oceans of Self-Manifest Pure Realms,” which describes a cosmolog y centered upon Buddha Ever Excellent’s post-enlightenment creations. Here we fi nd our-selves in a universe much like that described in the fi rst chapter of Myriad Worlds, where we fi rst met the realm called Richly Adorned (another name for Unsurpassed Realm) and the Buddha Great Glacial Lake. Th e diff erence between this cosmolog y and that of the great way seems to be that here it is Buddha Ever Excellent, the body of ultimate enlightenment (Tibetan: “chöku”; Sanskrit: dharmakaya), whose “dynamic expression” provides the creative force that produces the realm and the buddha that both cosmologies identify as the body of perfect rapture (Tibetan: “long-ku”; Sanskrit: sambhogakaya).As further evidence of Buddha Ever Excellent’s central place in this scheme, Kongtrul then recounts the origins of Buddha Vajra Bearer, the axial buddha of much of the tantras, as an emanation of Ever Excellent who “demonstrated a seeming series of incarnations” that ended with enlightenment. Th is account, though brief, obviously follows the pat-terns we’ve seen in previous chapters. On the subject of Vajra Bearer’s deeds, that buddha is equated with all tantras’ teachers, be they called Vajra Bearer, Ever Excellent, or Vajrasattva. Kongtrul notes that his sec-tion on Buddha Vajra Bearer’s deeds marks the conclusion of his descrip-tion of the basis for the appearance of the body of perfect rapture; all that follows describes what manifests from that basis.What fi rst arises returns us to the subject of Buddha Great Glacial Lake, and not for the last time in this chapter. Th is buddha, so central to both the great way’s and great perfection’s cosmologies, has not oft en been the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 516TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5166/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 517focus of teaching or writing outside Buddhist countries and languages. Here Kongtrul devotes a long section to him, adding the secondary name “Illuminator” in front of his proper name. Th is, of course, is familiar to many Buddhists in the Sanskrit, Vairochana. As Kongtrul states, not only does this buddha encompass all phenomena of the wheel of life—our cos-mos amounting to an infi nitesimal part of his physical confi guration—all forms of enlightenment also merely refl ect this buddha’s dynamic expres-sion. All that we experience as impure or limited appears in this buddha’s world as pure and magnifi ed. In the end, Kongtrul avers,Only a buddha’s mind can encompass a buddha’s experiential domain; therefore, what has been described transcends even the experiential domain of lord bodhisattvas of awakening’s tenth stage. Self-manifest supreme clear light of the basis of being’s appearing aspect arises as the worlds and beings of the panorama of infi nite purity. Th eir appearances have the same qualities as those of a pure dream; apart from those qualities, they do not in the least exist in their own right as [things made of ] substantial atoms.Each body of enlightenment provides the basis for the appearance of the next—Ever Excellent, the body of ultimate enlightenment, produced Buddha Vajra Bearer, whose emanations include Buddha Great Glacial Lake. Th ose bodies of perfect rapture in turn seem to act like crystal in the sunshine: a proliferation of emanations stream from them without in any way altering their source. Among their manifestations are buddhas who perform the twelve deeds of the last chapter: “sublime emanations simul-taneously demonstrate the Buddha’s twelve deeds in all ten directions’ infi nite worldly realms.” Th e Buddha who dominated the last chapters becomes a buddha, and one of very, very many.In this chapter to this point, the most dramatic novelty has been fi nding Buddha Ever Excellent at the source of all things, and the most unique description has been that of his primordial enlightenment. Th at excepted, much of the information presented here until the end of the section entitled “Enlightenment’s Diverse Manifestations” generally con-forms with what we can read in the monumental scriptures of the great way, such as Th e Flower Ornament Scripture, or throughout the higher tantras. What Kongtrul has done that is remarkable is to present this TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 517TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5176/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"518 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgenon-provocative information couched in an unusual terminolog y, that of great perfection.Here are some terms we encounter in this chapter that force us to reconsider not the cosmolog y, or the framework of the three bodies of enlightenment—both quite familiar to Buddhist readers—but their the-oretical underpinnings according to great perfection: self-arisen wisdom of awareness, primordial purity, spontaneous presence, spontaneously present jeweled enclosure, youthful vase body, essence, dynamic expres-sion, original basis, self-manifest, continual state, inner luminosity, out-wardly appearing luminosity.Th ese number among many key terms in great perfection that are distinct from all Buddhist paths that lead to this uppermost summit of theory and practice. To this point in the chapter, Kongtrul has presented easily understood and accepted ideas in this unusual vocabulary, whereas from the section entitled “Th e Manifest Body according to Great Perfec-tion” until the end of this chapter, he does the opposite—he avoids special great perfection terms altogether and introduces in plain language wildly variant accounts of the Buddha’s place in the world and of cosmolog y. Nowhere else except in great perfection texts will we read of the twelve teachers (the last of which is Buddha Shakyamuni), whose main teaching places were not necessarily located in India. Nowhere else will we read of the three representations of the teachings which move through space and time in relation to the evolution of the teaching of great perfection. And nowhere else will we read these astounding lines that describe the origins of sentient beings in this world:Aft er the period of formation, goddesses of water and wind, etc., place the minds of the world’s possible sentient beings into a jeweled lotus tree. Th e sound of a lotus voice radiates in the ten directions as an invocation. Th is wakes into manifesta-tion the latent seeds that dwell in the fi xation aspect of con-sciousness even of [beings of the] formless [heavens]. Th ese consciousnesses’ meditative states create emanated bodies that gradually spread throughout the three realms, [beginning with the highest formless realm, absorption within] neither dis-cernment nor no discernment. Th us even now, the haphazard movement of awareness in basic space produces the arising of sentient beings’ adventitious delusion.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 518TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5186/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 519Kongtrul ends the chapter on that note, adding only that should a reader want (or dare?) to discover more on these subjects, he recommends some books for further reading.

If one had to choose one among those works, Th e Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phe-nomena (both the short text and its commentary, published separately) is something of a Bible for those who practice great perfection.Th is vision of the ocean of great perfection’s view of buddhas and the universe they pervade and inhabit substantially concludes not only Kong-trul’s study of the Buddha but his presentation of the cosmos that began with Myriad Worlds. In great perfection the two subjects are inextricably intertwined, which leaves us at a unique summit of Buddhist philosophy before we begin in Book Th ree, “What the Buddha Taught,” the ascent and examination of another splendid mountain—the jewel of the Bud-dha’s teaching, the Dharma.Book Three: What the Buddha TaughtChapter One: What Are the Sacred Teachings?I have the impression that non-fundamentalist non-Buddhists generally respect the Buddha, or at least do not feel uneasy in the presence of his image. Buddhas, by turns jovial or serene, (and, it must be said, oft en of uncertain rank and pedigree in traditional Buddhist pantheons) can turn up in random public places—stores, fashion or interior design magazines, restaurants, or even bars—without being resented as grim clerical intrud-ers in secular environments. Members of the Buddhist community as well seem by and large to be smiled upon by non-believers. Without any knowledge of Buddhism, non-Buddhists seem to know that expressions of hatred, acts of physical or verbal aggression, or even simple schadenfreude are contrary to the Buddhist spirit. If Buddhists are thought of unkindly because of our beliefs—as exotic, befuddled fools, or worse—I think we are also credited with being harmless, even if that is meant in a derogatory sense. Such an aura of harmlessness that accompanies our communities worldwide could very well be a result of centuries-long heeding of the Buddha’s word, and of individual Buddhists’ lifelong spiritual discipline.Among the three jewels then, the Buddha and the spiritual commu-nity would appear to pass casual tests of public acceptability. But what TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 519TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5196/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"520 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeof Buddhism itself ? How much tolerance do even Buddhists, let alone non-Buddhists, have for textual Buddhism as it has been taught and pre-served for centuries? If you’ve ever wondered about this for yourself, let this chapter be your test, for here we fi nd Kongtrul’s cover version of one of our favorite songs, both the words and the music: What the Buddha Ta u g h t .Th e words here describe the Buddha’s teaching and the work of Indian Buddhist masters who elucidated and systematized Buddhism before it reached Tibet. Kongtrul has borrowed many of his words without attri-bution, but he expected much of his readership would recognize them immediately. Butön and Longchenpa, two prolifi c writers of very dif-ferent backgrounds and persuasions, and who coincidentally died a year apart in the mid-1300s, are responsible for much of the material found in this chapter. (Th ey in turn may have borrowed from others before them, but it is their impact and renown that continue undiminished to the present day.) Not only have we become accustomed to this informa-tion concerning the textual traditions of our faith, this is how we’re used to reading Buddhism delineated. Th is chapter evokes a “they’re playing our song” feeling. Why else would the foremost modern Himalayan Bud-dhist writer, His Holiness Dujom Rinpoché, have done much of what Kongtrul has here, and repeated the same material, oft en line for line, in his monumental Th e Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism (pp. 51–53, 72–96)? He, like Kongtrul, could have written something entirely new and original, and both authors knew we would recognize immediately these words and this style as borrowed from others. I suspect he and Kongtrul both could count on our swooning once again to the same old song : if you love textual Buddhism, here is its true fl avor, undiluted, the way we love it.Th e chapter begins by identifying the Buddha’s “apt speech” as the fore-most among the Buddha’s miracles to guide beings to enlightenment, the most important of his acts. What the Buddha transmitted, the Dharma, is said to be an “antidote to obscurations.” Th ese are two key terms: Th e word “antidote” sounds medical, and it is oft en used in that way: for instance, to foster loving-kindness if you hate, to rejoice in others’ merit and happiness if you envy, etc. In modern terms, these are solutions to our problems, the main one here being that of our “obscurations.” Obscura-tions are admittedly not problems most of us were aware we had, yet any-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 520TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5206/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 521thing that veils our sight of our own inherent enlightened (or “buddha”) nature falls into the category of obscurations.What seems crucial to notice here is that the essence of the Buddha’s path to enlightenment, the Dharma, is presented only as techniques (antidotes) to remove blockages (obscurations) to the full experience of our in-dwelling enlightenment. Th e essence of what the Buddha taught is not portrayed as correcting or improving whatever may lie beneath those obscurations. No claims are made that the Dharma will help us attain enlightenment per se; it seems to be enough that it removes what veils us from the sight of our true nature.Under the heading of “Th e Etymolog y of the Word Dharma,” we learn what translators discover early on: the huge range of meaning of this word dharma—ten meanings at least. Whenever its analogue in Tibetan (“chö,” chos) appears in a text, a translator must decide (sometimes aft er consulta-tion with resource persons) which meaning is intended. For instance, few among us would likely have guessed the example Kongtrul gives for the third of the ten meanings, that of transcendence of sorrow, or nirvana. He states the meaning, then provides an example: “(3) Dharma denotes tran-scendence of sorrow:” which he illustrates with a line we are all familiar with, yet read it here, its meaning altered, as if for the fi rst time: “Having taken refuge in the Dharma . . .”We read later how Dharma in the sense of holy Dharma in which we take refuge has two aspects, realization of the last two of the Buddha’s four truths—the truth of cessation of suff ering and of the spiritual path that leads to that cessation—and the articulation of that realization, the teachings. Th roughout this book, I have most oft en translated chö as “sacred teachings” where it seems the most likely meaning Kongtrul intends for that word. Nevertheless, I ruefully admit that on occasion he could in fact have wanted to indicate the other, intangible aspect of Dharma—realization—but I am not (yet) persuaded that the reader is any better served by having all instances of chö in the religious sense ren-dered as “Dharma.”Kongtrul fi rst tells us that the Buddha was articulate and eloquent, that his words were “well spoken.” He provides the list of sixty-two quali-ties of his speech, the sort of contemplative stroll through the qualities of enlightenment that I enjoy but which are likely an acquired taste. Later in the chapter, under the heading of “Classifi cation of the Canon accord-ing to Its Dominant Cause,” we notice a drift from whatever the Buddha TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 521TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5216/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"522 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgesaid as being well spoken to whatever was well spoken as the Buddha’s speech (I owe this formulation to an insightful colleague, Sarah Hard-ing ). Kongtrul states:. . . the teaching’s melodious sounds that emerged from moun-tains, trees, birds, lotuses, great drums, and so on; the teach-ings expressed by any pious attendant through the power of the Buddha’s blessing ; and the teachings expressed by men, women, boys, girls, and others through the power of the Bud-dha’s supreme activity have been compiled in the canon.“Compiled in the canon” means to be accepted as the Buddha’s word. At this point in the chapter, Kongtrul quotes a passage from one of the dis-courses on sublime insight in defense of the above statement, then signifi -cantly goes on to transpose the subject of the Buddha’s speech to a Tibetan controversy concerning what was admissible as authentic doctrine:Th is scripture and its reasoning validate the teachings which emerge from symbols written on yellow parchment, pure vi-sions, or wisdom mind’s manifest expression produced by trea-sure revealers—the sublime emanated individuals belonging to the early translation school.Other than this potent declaration of principle, Kongtrul is relatively cir-cumspect on the subject of the treasure teachings throughout Th e Trea-sury of Knowledge, which is surprising since he would spend much of his long life working tirelessly to collect, systematize, and preserve them.He makes a similarly bold statement under the next heading, “Clas-sifi cation of the Canon according to Its Subjects,” in an equally discreet way. When presenting the three collections, he announces without fan-fare that in fact there can be said to be nine collections:. . . from the perspective of the lesser way’s individual liberation system, there are three collections; from the perspective of the great way’s bodhisattva system, there are three collections; and from the perspective of the secret mantra vajra way’s system, there are three collections, a total of nine collections.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 522TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5226/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 523Th is was no doubt true in Kongtrul’s mind, but he knew very well that this formulation represented the end result of a long and hard-fought battle for acceptance. If nothing else, he had certainly read one of the best Buddhist histories written by Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa (1504–1566), whom Kongtrul mentioned in the chapter on the Buddha’s twelve deeds as having inspired his writing on the subject. In that history, Feast for the Wise (written in 1564), we read this on the subject of the arduous process of acceptance of innovation into the Buddhist canon:In general, the principal among the Buddha’s inconceivable teachings are those that only existed in the abodes of other be-ings, such as nagas and gods. Among them, the exalted master Nagarjuna retrieved such texts as Th e Discourse on the Perfec-tion of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Th ousand Verses from the land of the nagas. Th e exalted master Asanga retrieved many texts, such as Th e Discourse on Awakening’s Ten Stages, from Joyful Heaven. When such texts were disseminated, all authorities of the pious attendant persuasion criticized them, but they became assimilated as part of the doctrine of the great way.Such masters as Garab Dorjé and the great master Lotus-Born brought the Nyingma secret mantra texts [i.e., tantras] from such places as Unsurpassed Heaven and the land of ogres. Such masters as exalted Nagarjuna, King Indrabodhi, master Lavapa, and Asvara Vinasa retrieved such [new tantras] as Joy-ous Vajra, Sublime Bliss, and Matrix of Mystery. When such texts were disseminated, those of the way of philosophical sys-tems [i.e., mahayana] criticized them, but they became assimi-lated and essential as part of the doctrine of secret mantra.Th us, what real point is there to the perspective that au-thenticates those texts for which Indian manuscripts exist and dismisses as spurious those texts for which Indian manuscripts do not? We have Indian manuscripts for non-Buddhist teach-ings, such as the source texts of the charvaka [nihilist school of Indian philosophy], [but that fact does not authenticate them as Buddhist texts], whereas it is diffi cult to guarantee that vol-umes retrieved from such places as Joyful Heaven, Unsurpassed TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 523TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5236/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"524 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeHeaven, and the land of the nagas only be written on palm leaves, and in words common to scholars and translators.

However, even if you were able to see the texts, it is possible that you would develop the view that the texts are inauthentic. Nevertheless, the Buddha’s teaching is inconceivable—it is given in relation to the character and capacity of disciples at specifi c places and times, in language and terms comprehensible to them. Th us, if volumes of teach-ings appear in other realms through the Buddha’s power, it is not inconsistent that they appear in the letters and language of that place and time. Th erefore, when such teachers as the master Lotus-Born retrieved texts from locations such as Un-surpassed Heaven for the benefi t of his Tibetan disciples, it is not out of the question that those books were written in Tibetan letters and language.Th ese are subjects that surpass the bounds of pious atten-dants’ and bodhisattvas’ comprehension: why should spiritu-ally immature persons such as us tire ourselves in attempting to judge them? Be cautious about this! (Feast for the Wise, pp. 541–542)Th roughout the section that describes the three (or nine) collections, I have preferred rough equivalents in English to the Tibetan, or to what one is more likely to fi nd in other works—Sanskrit. Finding an acceptable translation for “chö ngön pa” [written in Tibetan chos mngon pa], or abhi-dharma in Sanskrit, proved the toughest challenge. In Book Four, “Bud-dhism Resplendent in the World,” Kongtrul will give a short overview of the content of one of the main compendiums of this collection, which contains teachings that describe reality as it is, that is to say, subjects that include cosmolog y, geography, the kinds of beings, the conditions of their life, karma, the human body, the workings of the senses, the way the mind works, and meditative states. Th e word “ngön pa” in Tibetan is defi ned as “clear, visible, conspicuous, manifest, evident” (An Encyclopaedic Tibetan-English Dictionary: p. 917, column 2).In this chapter, and throughout this book, I have translated “chö ngön TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 524TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5246/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 525pa,” or abhidharma, as “the collection on observed phenomena.” I do not imagine that this will be the last word on the subject; I introduce it to encourage the search for an apt translation for this key collection.Who made the observations of phenomena there recorded? Th e Bud-dha observed, and he recounted to his disciples what he thought they should know concerning the cosmos and their own psycho-physical makeup. While that sounds quite dualistic, as if the Buddha was a subject viewing phenomena as objects, and that he taught his followers to do the same, I believe he intended these teachings to help his auditors hone their acuity, perceiving the world and themselves through sharper eyes, on the way to seeing through dualistic limitations entirely. If we trust our eyes alone, we witness the sun moving daily, yet long and careful attention has revealed to us that we cannot believe what we plainly see. Likewise, the Buddha asks his disciples to turn their attention to specifi c outer and inner phenomena so that they might discover, as he did, that despite our daily experience to the contrary, all external and internal phenomena appear but are unreal, as in a dream or a magical display.In the list of twelve branches of the Buddha’s speech, the fi ft h—pur-poseful declarations—is noteworthy in that among the twelve it alone was spoken not in response to others’ questions or encouragement but on the Buddha’s own initiative. Th e best-known mode of the Buddha’s speech, the discourse, is in Sanskrit sutra, source of our word “suture.” In Tibetan, this word has been translated as mdo (pronounced like the English word “doe”), meaning junction, crossroads, meeting point. What the Buddha said in the discourses represents the speech of enlightenment that resulted from the meeting of his mind and another’s. Like a modern doctor, the Buddha did not preach or proselytize, he let those who needed his wisdom come to him and initiate his teaching with their questions; this spirit runs through all the Buddha’s teachings, apart from the single category of “purposeful declarations.” Th e Buddha and his followers to the present day are not evangelistic seemingly by nature and defi nitely not by training.Th e fi nal main part of this chapter presents what are called here “trea-tises,” what we would call Buddhist books other than teachings of the Buddha himself. Th e most striking passage is the last (entitled “A Sup-plementary Explanation of Which Treatises to Adopt and Which to Reject”), where Kongtrul sets aside his customary equanimity to make some acerbic comments on Buddhist readers’ habits, beginning with:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 525TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5256/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"526 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeAt this time of the disappearance of Buddha’s doctrine, human beings’ faint merit and intelligence result in treatises being more esteemed than the Victor’s canon; Tibetan works, more than Indian works; and modern works, more than earlier ones.He then goes on to commend a practice that fi nds faint sympathy in the modern world, but which is highly valued in Buddhist Asia—repeating aloud the Buddha’s words:Among words expressed in this world, the most sublime and magnifi cent are those that comprise the Victor’s precious ex-cellent speech. Th us, even though you do not understand the meaning of the Buddha’s words, to merely recite them aloud has inconceivable blessing and purpose.What Kongtrul does not include in his overview of the canon and trea-tises is an account of the texts grouped in the two massive Tibetan collec-tions called Th e Collection of the Buddha’s Words in Translation [Tibetan: Kang yur] and Th e Collection of Indian Treatises in Translation [Tibetan: Teng yur]. When Tibetans refer to their inheritance of Indian Buddhist literature, they have these texts in mind. Another nineteenth-century eastern Tibetan writer provided a broad outline of the two collections’ contents, which might have corresponded to Kongtrul’s accounting, had he written one.In brief, Th e Collection of the Buddha’s Words in Translation, the words of the Buddha translated into Tibetan, contains a total of 1,117 texts. Among those, 210 belong in the general category of discourses, be they of the lesser or great way; all but twenty-four of those texts were translated during the fi rst period of translation in Tibet. Th e remaining 907 texts of scripture are tantras, of which all but 189 were early translations. It must be remembered that these numbers are somewhat deceptive: Th e Flower Ornament Discourse, 1,500 pages in English translation, counts as one text, as does the single-page Discourse of the Heart of the Perfection of Sublime Insight.Th e Collection of Indian Treatises in Translation in Tibetan contains 3,492 texts, of which 175 are supplementary works, such as praises and dedication prayers. Among the core collection of treatises, 536 comment upon the discourses and 2,781 are concerned with the tantras.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 526TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5266/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 527Th ese numbers tell a story all by themselves. In the two collections of what the Tibetans worship as the foundation texts of their faith, 746 works are discourses, a category which would here include all works in the collections on monastic discipline, of discourses, and on observed phenomena; and the writings of such masters as Maitreya, Asanga, Nagarjuna, Shantideva, Chandragomi, Vasubandhu, and Chandrakirti. Many (but far from all) of the discourses and their related treatises have appeared in Western-language translations, and inform non-Asian appre-ciation of Buddhism. Th e same cannot be said for the 3,688 texts of tan-tra, almost fi ve times the number of discourses.We cannot escape the fact that the preponderance of Indian Buddhist literature the Tibetans held to be sacred were tantras and tantric com-mentaries. Further, only the tiniest fraction, barely a handful, of texts from these collections of tantras have appeared in Western languages. Th is has two obvious eff ects: fi rst, Himalayan tantric Buddhism remains largely unknown to those who do not read Tibetan. Th e best translation of an overview of Buddhist tantra belongs to this Treasury of Knowledge series: Systems of Buddhist Tantra, translated by Elio Guarisco and Ingrid McLeod, and published in 2005. As the rest of Th e Treasury of Knowl-edge appears in English, readers at last have the opportunity to encounter previously unheard-of views and ideas which form the basis of tantric Buddhism.Th e second eff ect of the paucity of direct access to tantric source texts is that their ideas have had no impact yet on culture and thinking outside the Tibetan-reading Himalayas. Imagine if all that we had were texts from the lesser way on monastic discipline—Buddhist law—and that we only heard vague rumors of such concepts as buddha nature, emptiness, rela-tive and ultimate mind of awakening, the perfection of sublime insight, and the rest of the great way, and we had no means to read Nagarjuna, Shantideva, and other masters. Th ese days, any conscientious Buddhists can inform themselves in English on all major concepts of the great way directly from Buddhism’s greatest minds. Th eir understanding can then inform their lives, work, and personal disciplines outside any formal spir-itual practice. Most importantly for the culture at large, any Buddhist ideas thus absorbed change the individual’s personal narrative and behav-ior. One doesn’t have to have been born Japanese to thrive on raw fi sh, rice, wasabi, and soy sauce; one doesn’t have to be Buddhist to welcome its basic tenets as touchstones in a well-lived and well-refl ected human TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 527TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5276/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"528 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgelife. All faiths and all uplift ing forms of human culture can learn from one another. For example, the head of a Tibetan monastery remarked ruefully to me one day, “If we Buddhists practiced like Muslims, we’d all attain enlightenment.” Buddhist tantra has yet to become part of the global conversation in religion and culture, to which it has so much to add. It will remain marginal, mysterious, and misunderstood until its source texts appear in translation.Chapter Two: Cycles of Scriptural TransmissionTh is chapter begins with a statement from the pious attendant tradition (Tibetan: nyan thos; Sanskrit: shravaka) to the eff ect that the Buddha taught only one set of teachings, centered on the theme of the four truths. Kongtrul does not bother to refute that belief; he merely acknowledges it and moves on to presenting his own belief system, which adds both the great way and the tantras to the Buddha’s fi rst teachings.We are here introduced to the image of a “wheel of Dharma,” an emblem that recurs throughout Buddhist writing and artistic representation. Although the wheel is perhaps the foremost symbol of the Buddha and Buddhism, it resonates in Asia as more than just a necessary appendage to a vehicle. When we see paintings of gods or demons brandishing a wheel, they are prepared to fl ing it as a sharp weapon that slices through what-ever it strikes. Kongtrul writes here that the wheel refers to the teachings that “have the power to subdue and cut through.” Further, the wheel sym-bolizes authority, specifi cally the dominion of “wheel-monarchs” whose origins and opulence were described in Myriad Worlds (pp. 134–138). In brief, “Wheel-monarchs, who reign over the four continents [by virtue of their possession of ] a gold, silver, copper or iron wheel, are said to appear in this world whenever the life span rises above eighty thousand years” (p. 135, square brackets in the original). Finally, a wheel itself can be understood in Buddhist texts as a conveyance, independent of any other vehicle. For example, from the same text, “. . . a gold wheel appeared in space before him. He fl ung the wheel with the command, ‘Conquer the East!’ Th e wheel moved in that direction, carrying the king’s attendants upon it” (p. 135).Th ese layers of meaning must be kept in mind when we read here:[W]hen a wheel-monarch’s precious wheel is set in motion, it travels swift ly to its intended destination, passing some places TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 528TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5286/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 529and entering others. It defeats unconquered regions, such as cities or villages, and naturally establishes its dominion over them. It ascends to some places and descends to others. Like-wise, the wheel of Dharma . . .To justify the use of this object laden with military and imperial conno-tations to symbolize the Buddha’s teaching, Kongtrul then writes some lines that for many readers need decoding :Likewise, the wheel of Dharma moves swift ly since truth is re-alized in fi ft een moments. It passes through the uninterrupted path and makes manifest the path of liberation, thereby en-tering it. Alternatively, the wheel of Dharma rejects focus on the reality [of things] and enters another [i.e., spiritual path]. Th rough [the power] of fi rm decisiveness, the uninterrupted path defeats unconquered affl ictive emotions, such as the view of perishable collections [as a self ]. Th e path of liberation is the attainment of separation from affl ictive emotions. Domin-ion over them is naturally established at the same time. Focus-ing on the form or formless realms, [the wheel of Dharma] ascends; focusing on the desire realm, it descends.“Truth” in the fi rst sentence refers to the four truths (of suff ering, its origins, its cessation, and the path), and the “fi ft een moments” refer to moments of realization that culminate in a sixteenth—realization. One glossary presents them particularly well:Th e perception of the doctrine of the truth of suff ering . . . , re-ceptiveness to the perception of the doctrine of [the truth of ] suff ering . . . , the aft er-eff ect to the perception of the doctrine of [the truth of ] suff ering . . . , and receptiveness to the aft er-eff ect to the perception of the doctrine of the truth of suff ering. . . Th ese four moments are then applied in the same order to the truth of the origin of suff ering, to the truth of its cessation and to the truth of the path, making sixteen moments in all. (Th e Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism, v. 2, p. 174)“Th e uninterrupted path” and “the path of liberation” form two parts of the path of seeing, the fi rst corresponding to the eight moments of TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 529TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5296/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"530 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgereceptiveness; the latter, to the eight moments of perception. As Kong-trul states above, the uninterrupted path “defeats unconquered affl ictive emotions,” whereas the path of liberation entails the experience of sepa-ration from those emotions. Much later in Th e Treasury of Knowledge (Book 9, Chapter 2), Kongtrul comments that the fi rst fi ft een moments span the path of seeing, and the sixteenth marks attainment of the path of meditation. Kongtrul ends this section with a comment:An acceptable alternative approach is to consider the real wheel of Dharma to be the Dharma of realization, and the paths of accumulation and preparation to be branches of it. Th e scriptures make these comprehensible to others’ mind streams; thus, the phrase, “turning the wheel of Dharma.”It is tempting to read these lines as useful keys to what preceded them: that the wheel itself can represent one or more paths—the Buddha’s realization—and the movement of that realization into others’ minds, through verbal and other modes of teaching , constitutes the turning of the wheel.Th e next section, “Th e Characteristics of Scriptural Transmission,” lays forth the great way’s and tantra’s view of the Buddha’s teaching—that it exists principally in the ear of the auditor. Ordinary beings met an enlightened being, and a teaching emerged and unfolded, but not due to the teacher’s agenda:Th e dominant cause [for scriptural transmission] is the Bud-dha’s wisdom; its causal condition is the pure mind streams of beings who are his disciples. Based on the convergence of these two, those disciples’ understanding manifests in the form of terms, words, and letters.Since the Transcendent Conqueror was not under the sway of habitual patterns that motivate speech, and since he had no lack of awareness, [including ] inner cognition attached to external sound, ultimately, the Transcendent Buddha did not teach through the power of intentions. Th us, in consideration of this fact, some great way discourses relate that the Joyful Buddha did not teach even one word or syllable.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 530TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5306/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 531Th is could be said to be the mood of many great way discourses and most, if not all, of the tantras. Kongtrul contrasts this with the lesser way by portraying its adherents as concerned with which category among the fi ve psycho-physical aggregates—form or formative factors—they might place the Buddha’s teaching in, concerns which seem absurdly category-obsessive aft er the last paragraph.Kongtrul then shift s the topic to one of the main defi ning frame-works of the Buddha’s teaching, that of three cycles. As in the preceding chapter, we learn of the many strategies developed in India and Tibet to bring some coherence to the enormous wealth of material included in the Buddhist canon. Kongtrul considers this “three-cycle” frame impor-tant enough to merit its own chapter. Th ese three do not correspond to the three main Buddhist ways (lesser, great, and vajra systems); they only include the lesser and great way, the fi rst of the three cycles being that of the lesser way; the latter two belong to the great way. Kongtrul quotes a discourse to the eff ect that the purpose of the fi rst cycle, enunciation of the four truths, was to have ordinary beings enter “exalted beings’ spiri-tual discipline.” Th e second cycle presented “emptiness, absence of inher-ent characteristics, and lack of aspiration” (what are referred to as the “three gateways to freedom”) in order to have beings “comprehend the nature of transcendent buddhas.” Th e point of the last cycle was to have beings enter “the transcendent buddhas’ domain.”As mild as these words may seem to us, they can be read as a contro-versial statement in that Kongtrul implies that the fi nal cycle represents the most profound teachings. Not everyone accepted that belief, a fact acknowledged in the statement, “Various perspectives related to the three wheels of Dharma will appear in detail in later chapters within Th e Trea-sury of Knowledge.” ( Th is may refer to Book Four, Chapter Two, “How Buddhist Monastic Discipline and Scriptural Transmissions Came to Tibet,” below, where he returns to the subject at greater length.)An example of an affi rmation that seems reasonable and non-con-tentious on fi rst reading can be found in the section in this chapter on the fi rst cycle of teaching : “Th e fi rst wheel of Dharma, that of the four truths, can be characterized as sacred teachings the Buddha spoke with the intention of establishing a foundation for the great way’s path” (empha-sis added). For followers of the lesser way, this is nothing short of infl am-matory. Likewise, on the subject of the middle cycle of teaching, he states TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 531TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5316/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"532 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethat it was given “with the intention of establishing the great way’s actual path,” whereas the fi nal cycle was given to teach “the ultimate meaning.” Again, statements such as those kept lamps burning and ink fl owing long into the night over the centuries throughout the Himalayas. Signifi cant, unresolvable diff erences of opinion exist and persist. In a later chapter, Kongtrul will elucidate each belief system and show what each adds to the conversation, while at the same time reveal his own preference among those beliefs. Th ose who appreciate Kongtrul marvel at his talent for fi nd-ing genuine value in every voice. At the conclusion of the section “Th e Middle Cycle of Teaching,” he lauds that cycle in terms that its adherents would approve of:Th is doctrinal cycle’s purposes are as follows: directly, the Bud-dha demonstrated the way of turning the wheel, and the re-cipients, his disciples’ minds, were defi nitely liberated. Based on these purposes, they entered the transcendent buddhas’ domain. Indirectly, this cycle removes all sentient beings’ ob-scuring veils of wrong views, leading to the manifest and ir-reversible realization of all phenomena’s abiding nature, and the attainment of the supreme transcendence of sorrow which does not fall into the two extremes.Yet his next sentence opens the section “Th e Final Cycle of Teaching” with the information that the Buddha taught it to articulate “the ultimate meaning,” presumably beyond the range of the middle cycle. Kongtrul’s style has no trace of polemics; he found space for every belief around the Tibetan conference table and somehow managed to express his own opinions without denigrating those holding other views.In the section “Th e Final Cycle of Teaching,” we read of three char-acteristics of knowable things: imagined, dependent, and consummate. Another book of this series, Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy, treats this subject in detail (pp. 179–183) and I have borrowed the translator Elizabeth Callahan’s translations for these key terms. In brief, “depen-dent” refers to the arising of phenomena from the consciousness of the ground of all ordinary experience (alaya in that book), “imagined” to the dualistic perception of those phenomena, and “consummate” to non-dual, nonconceptual perception. As Kongtrul writes in summation in that book,TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 532TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5326/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 533In brief, we enter the path by recognizing delusion, which is the imagined [characteristic]; by abandoning the imagination, which is the dependent [nature]; and by directly seeing the consummate. (p. 183; brackets in the original)Aft er the section on the fi nal cycle, Kongtrul includes one last frame-work for organizing the Buddha’s teaching , this time by “aggregates” or units. Th is may seem a little far-fetched, particularly since one proposed measure of a single aggregate is however much can be written with as much ink as the god Indra’s elephant can carry. Nevertheless, I oft en trans-lated for Kalu Rinpoché when he would introduce the breadth of the Buddha’s teachings in just this way (without mentioning the elephant). He would say that of the eighty-four thousand aggregates, the collection on discipline comprised twenty-one thousand, the antidotes to desire; the discourses, another twenty-one thousand, to counteract anger; the teachings on observed phenomena, twenty-one thousand, the solution to stupidity; and the tantras, a fi nal twenty-one thousand, to remedy as many varied combinations of the three poisons. Rinpoché told me that an earnest Buddhist scholar once informed him aft er hearing that pre-sentation that no such number of teachings existed. Th at remark caused Rinpoché no end of amusement, and certainly didn’t deter him from regularly repeating that teaching.Th e truth of the matter is that the more we immerse ourselves in the Buddhist canon, the fonder we become of such clichéd words as inex-pressible, indescribable, and inconceivable when we are asked to explain our lifelong infatuation with the source texts of Buddhism. None of the many framing systems Kongtrul has presented comes close to capturing the experience of our encounter with the range and depth of the Buddha’s word, but any (and perhaps the simpler the better) can help portray the scope and content of the canon.Th e last parts of this chapter describe the origins of tantra, here divided into four levels. Contrary to common expectations, these sections are straightforward and easily comprehensible, although they locate the orig-inal teachings of the tantras throughout the larger Buddhist cosmolog y. Many places were mentioned earlier; one, Flower-Filled World, could hardly be less precise. Of it, Myriad Worlds relates,TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 533TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5336/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"534 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeOne billion third-order thousand world-systems constitutes the world-system Infi nite Links.

(p. 103)Note that one “third-order thousand world-system” combines one thou-sand of our cosmos, counted as one, which is then multiplied by one thousand, that cosmos counted as one, which is again multiplied by one thousand. Willow Grove, another location of tantra’s teaching, can be found in the heavens of the desire realm’s gods; specifi cally it is “Supreme Mountain’s northern turret, border of Heaven of the Th irty-three.”We notice throughout this section the occasional re-telling of the Bud-dha’s enlightenment story, either of his original enlightenment in Unsur-passed Realm, or of its reenactment in this world. For example, Matrix of Mystery tantra recounts its origins as follows:Our teacher attained enlightenment at midnight; he subdued demons at dawn and went to Joyful Heaven. Th ere, he emanat-ed a celestial palace from his wisdom body’s major elements; and from his aggregates, sense constituents, etc., he emanated deities arrayed in a sacred circle. His circle of disciples that fi lled space then supplicated the Transcendent Conqueror [to teach].Th e Slayer of the Lord of Death cycle has another origin story, also based on the enlightenment events:As our teacher reached manifest awakening, the demons’ armies created obstacles. Th e teacher dwelt in a meditative state called “complete victory over the great demon.” Wrathful Slayer of the Lord of Death arose from the Buddha’s vajra body, speech, and mind, and he emanated the deity’s sacred circle. He sub-dued every demon and taught the extensive tantra.Th e Buddha also taught the Vajra of Delight tantra immediately follow-ing his enlightenment. In the case of the Supreme Bliss tantra, even the teaching of the tantra itself constitutes a reenactment since “from time TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 534TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5346/14/10 3:52:00 PM6/14/10 3:52:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 535immemorial, all buddhas have taught this tantra, and it is thought that since time immemorial our teacher attained enlightenment and revealed it.” Th e passage on Supreme Bliss identifi es the teacher as the “fruition Héruka,” which refers to an enlightened being (therefore “fruition”) who appears as a wrathful male deity (“héruka”). Tara or All-Seeing One number among many bodhisattvas designated in other texts as “fruition bodhisattvas”—bodhisattvas in appearance alone, since they are consid-ered to be fully enlightened and no longer on the spiritual path even as bodhisattvas at the highest level.Kongtrul ends this somewhat discursive, narrative chapter with a return to basics from the point of view of tantra—nondual, timeless awareness. He comments upon all he has just written on the subject of the origins of tantra:Th ose explanations just given refl ect specifi c perspectives. Nevertheless, the great way’s mode of secret mantra is the apo-gee of depth and vastness. Th erefore, it is impossible to say, “It happened only in this way and no other; he did not impart tantra apart from this.”And he concludes with a reminder that the teaching of tantra, great seal, and great perfection all take place not only outside the confi nes of our limited spatial dimension, but also within a diff erent time zone, that of timelessness, and the boundlessness of nonduality:As is said,I am the one who teaches.I am the teaching.I am the listeners replete with accumulations.I am the world, the teacher, and the practice.I am both the mundane and supramundane.As stated, you should understand that the teacher and the circle of his disciples are inseparable. Within their single na-ture of great bliss, the indestructible sound (vajra nada) of supreme mystery forever turns the wheel of Dharma and pro-claims the tantras.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 535TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5356/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"536 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeChapter Th ree: Compilations of the Buddha’s WordTh e excellent speech of the Buddha was just that—speech. No record exists of him having written a word, nor did a team of scribes attend his teachings. In this chapter, Kongtrul relates the story of how the Buddha’s speech became words on pages, for the process of compilation was pre-ceded by recitation, affi rmation, and transcription.Th e chapter begins with the account of the compilation of the texts of the lesser way, which took place not long aft er the Buddha passed away. Five hundred arhats—those of the highest degree of realization upon the lesser way’s path—each replete with clairvoyant abilities, participated in the compilation. Ananda, the Buddha’s nephew and constant attendant, began by reciting the Buddha’s discourses from memory. Th e arhats then “entered absorption within the four levels of meditative concentration and considered [Ananda’s presentation] with clairvoyance. Once they rose from their meditative state, they collectively confi rmed [the dis-courses as valid].” Another close disciple, Upali, responded to questions in his recounting of the Buddha’s teachings on monastic discipline, and Kashyapa recited the “mother” teachings, those that provided the basis for the collection on observed phenomena. Each arhat’s enunciation of the Buddha’s teachings was confi rmed in the same way: the entire con-gregation of arhats surveyed what it had heard from the perspective of higher meditative states, and affi rmed it as a reliable repetition of the Buddha’s speech.Many centuries later, when the Tibetans inherited these texts from Indian masters, the fi rst translators counted a total of seventy-two texts from this cycle.Th e compilation of the great way’s texts follows somewhat the same pattern, but Kongtrul shares few details. A million bodhisattvas con-vened; three among them “compiled” the texts that belong to the three collections related to the bodhisattva path. Kongtrul does not mention the fate of the texts produced at that time, but other Buddhist histories relate that the bodhisattvas mainly entrusted them to nonhuman beings for safekeeping.Again, the fi rst Tibetan translators received twenty-four texts from the doctrine’s middle cycle, including the many versions of Th e Perfection of Sublime Insight that Nagarjuna retrieved from the underworld realms of nagas many centuries aft er this compilation. Further, ninety texts from TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 536TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5366/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 537the doctrine’s fi nal cycle, including Th e Flower Ornament Discourse, accompanied Buddhism’s initial journey to Tibet. During Buddhism’s later period of propagation, a total of twenty-four texts from all three cycles arrived and were translated in Tibet.Kongtrul includes at this point a lengthy discussion of the future dura-tion of the doctrine according to many sources. Kongtrul encourages his readership to learn more. If you wished to do so from a book written in English, this subject (of prophecies of the doctrine’s decline in fi ve-hundred-year increments) is treated very well in a fascinating book, Once Upon a Future Time, by Janice Nattier.Th is section concludes with another contrast between diff erent Bud-dhist perspectives on how we might determine whether or not Buddhism exists in any given country or region. Th e traditional perspective seems to be that Buddhism is alive wherever the basic collections are studied, and where monks and nuns continue to live according to the Buddha’s com-munity discipline. We read:. . . whether the doctrine abides or not is determined on the basis of whether or not the three trainings, and the collections that explain them, are studied; whether or not the monastic community’s one hundred and one formal procedures are put into practice; and whether or not there are those who keep the outer signs and attire of the pious attendant tradition.By that measure, worldwide Buddhism in the modern day is fragile indeed. Kongtrul then provides what he calls “the defi nitive meaning” (truth that cannot be superseded), by quoting a discourse and a tantra, the latter of which states:As long as the great massOf all sentient beings exists,Th e fl ow of enlightenment’s emanations is continuousAnd the teachings that liberate do not disappear.He then turns our attention to the compilation of the tantras. Th e great way’s compilation was performed by bodhisattvas in this world; tantras were compiled by similar beings but in realms outside our own, or on this earth in the kingdom of Shambhala, by its rulers King Suchandra and TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 537TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5376/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"538 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeLineage Bearer Manjushrimitra. Kongtrul contents himself with citing a few instances of such work, then states, “Th ere are limitless examples such as these.” While the compilers of other texts had diff erent identities, he states that all tantras were compiled by the same wisdom being, Lord of Secrets, under diff erent names or in diff erent incarnations.Kongtrul ends this, the lightest of all chapters of Th e Treasury of Knowl-edge, with accounts of two further compilations concerned with the lesser way. Both seem to have occurred due to severe controversies within the monastic community. Th e story of the second compilation, which Kong-trul calls “partial,” does not even mention the transcription of any texts; its sole purpose seems to have been to return the community to its fun-damental principles. It proved a success. Th e same cannot be said entirely for the third compilation assembly, for it marked the formal split of the once unifi ed monastic community into fi rst four, then eighteen, orders. Th e landmark decision taken at the time established all eighteen orders as having been foretold in the Buddha’s own words, thus what had begun as a perilous schism was reformulated as a predicted event that enriched rather than undermined the larger community. A considerable number of texts were transcribed or revised during this fi nal compilation.For those interested in the four orders and their eighteen divisions, Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy provides a very useful exposition of their diff erences, including those of language, dress, names given at the time of ordination, and belief systems (pp. 135–140).Chapter Four: Th e Origins of the EarlyTranslations’ Ancient TraditionTh roughout Th e Treasury of Knowledge, Kongtrul more oft en than not reserves the fi nal chapter of each book for a study of the Ancient Tradi-tion’s perspective on the respective subject. Myriad Worlds ended deeply and densely in great perfection; “Th e Light of the World,” with the Ancient Tradition’s version of enlightenment’s bodies and pure lands; and now in “What the Buddha Taught” we read of the origins of the tantras fi rst introduced to Tibet. Why did Kongtrul end books with the Ancient Tradition’s view ? He did not explain; I can only speculate. For each subject, Kongtrul usually begins with the lesser way’s perspec-tive, then the great way’s, then that of the vajra way of secret mantra, the lower tantras followed by the higher. In that scheme, his placement of the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 538TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5386/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 539Ancient Tradition at the end honors it with the last word since, by its own lights, it represents the summit of the nine Buddhist ways. Kongtrul self-consciously identifi es himself in “Buddhism Resplendent in the World” as a member of Tibet’s Karma Kag yu order, yet that affi liation would not have prevented him from preferring the Ancient Tradition’s view.In a general sense, Kongtrul’s repeated return to the Ancient Tradition when presenting the depth and breadth of Buddhism makes sense for a Tibetan author whose erudition spanned all orders, sects, and persua-sions in the Himalayas. Th e original translations, and the Indian masters and Tibetan adepts of their era, ushered in a radically new mentality—a new faith, new ideas, a new literature in a new language—changes that the country never abandoned despite a short, brutal period of govern-ment suppression. It was in this form that Buddhism fi rst made sense to the Tibetan people; during the approximately two hundred and fi ft y years between the time of King Trisong Déutsen (755–797/8) and Atisha (in Tibet from 1042–1054), this was the only Buddhism Tibet knew and embraced. I have mentioned above how the early translation work domi-nates Tibet’s Buddhist canon: of 210 texts in the category of discourses, all but twenty-four were translated during that time; of 907 texts of tan-tra, all but 189 were early translations. Further, those translations were performed with a common lexicon and under a central authority over a relatively short period of time. Presumably the fi nished works were pre-served as a collection. Th e translations of the later propagation took place over centuries by translators of diverse practices and affi nities, living in disparate corners of a land unequipped with libraries that would receive and store any and all translators’ work. Only in the fourteenth century did an edition of most scriptures in Tibetan translation appear (“most” since it unfortunately excluded many of the early tantras).It is impossible to say how Tibetans of earlier eras experienced what had evolved from a foreign faith into “Tibetan” Buddhism and the new texts and practices imported from a still-vibrant Buddhist India. I wonder if they accepted the foundations of their faith as it had fi rst been taught in their country, then integrated new techniques or deities into that basic template. I fi nd this passage below from Kongtrul (in Book Four) tell-ing : it refers to the period when the incomparable Indian master Atisha reached Tibet and reports that although the Buddhist kings’ dynasty had long since disappeared, its authority a distant memory, the kings’ edicts still held sway. Th us it transpired that Atisha, the perfect monk, was not TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 539TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5396/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"540 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeasked to ordain monks or nuns in Tibet due to Tibetans’ loyalty to their Buddhism rooted in the time of the original translations:Here in Tibet, by command of the Buddhist kings, except for the middle way view and the substantialist order of monastic conduct, no other [views or monastic orders] were authorized [to be transmitted in the country]. Th erefore, since Atisha, for example, was of the majority order, he wasn’t asked to transmit that vow lineage.What I infer from this incident is that Tibet’s Buddhists developed and retained a self-confi dent, autonomous identity as Buddhists based on the original period of teachings and translations. Atisha and all who fol-lowed in his wake added to but did not supplant Tibet’s fi rst founda-tions of Buddhist practice. Translators Drokmi, Marpa, Kyungpo Naljor, and other Tibetans who introduced teachings of lasting value to their country did not journey to India as blank-slate spiritual seekers but as sophisticated adepts who had already gained in their homeland high degrees of competence in the theory and practice of Buddhist tantras. While some dissatisfaction with Tibet’s Buddhist horizons in their day may have motivated their travel to India, they were not revolutionaries but evolutionaries—energetic geniuses who wished to add to, not under-mine, their country’s Buddhist wealth.Th e present chapter presents the origins of Tibet’s founding Buddhism. What Kongtrul describes here cannot be called the “Nyingma” tradi-tion as we have come to understand that term—as a Tibetan container of specifi c Buddhist practices. He makes no reference to Tibet; the lin-eages he mentions are either entirely Indian or arisen from an atempo-ral communion of buddhas’ minds occurring in pure lands well beyond human realms. Hence in the title he writes “Ancient Tradition,” which seems more accurate in this context than the more Tibet-centered term “Nyingma.”Th e framework Kongtrul uses for this chapter consists of three lin-eages that transmit the same teachings in three radically diff erent styles: a mind-to-mind transmission passed between enlightened beings; trans-mission through symbols passed between highly realized human beings, called awareness holders; and verbal transmission passed aurally between TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 540TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5406/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 541human beings. We can conceive of these lineages as located in history and temporally sequential, and to a degree this is how Kongtrul presents them. Or we can consider all three to be ongoing , with only the last of the three perceptible to ordinary persons such as ourselves.Th e fi rst, the victors’ (i.e., the buddhas’ or enlightened beings’) lin-eage transmitted through wisdom mind, begins with a now-familiar sub-ject, Unsurpassed Realm, here renovated according to great perfection’s terminolog y:[T]he essence of being is originally pure and, in relation to its self-manifestation, [is free from] transitory defi lements of delusion, which have been purifi ed directly upon the basis of being. Th is essence of being is designated by the term “Unsur-passed Realm.” It is the basic space of phenomena, the self-manifest sacred circle of essential awakening not belonging to minds [of beings in] the ten directions, and not defi ned by size, limits, or orientation.Th is passage describes Unsurpassed as the location of the teaching of the body of ultimate enlightenment, Buddha Ever Excellent, and is the fi rst of a fi ve-part framework commonly used to detail the circumstances of enlightened beings designated as the body of perfect rapture, character-ized by fi ve marvels—of location, teacher, disciples, teaching, and time. Th e rest of the paragraph touches on the remaining four, and Kongtrul repeats this fi ve-part presentation in subsequent sections when he intro-duces other buddhas’ manifestations.Despite the fi ve marvels depicted, this fi rst teacher is formless. In con-trast, the next teacher mentioned exhibits form, although this is qualifi ed as “self-manifest,” that is to say, apparent only to the enlightened being whose qualities manifest in the form of the fi ve marvels. As Kongtrul states, this closed environment lies “beyond the experiential range of even those [bodhisattvas who dwell on] awakening’s tenth stage.” Only the next set of enlightened beings can be perceived by others, yet those perceivers are exclusively “sovereign bodhisattvas of awakening’s tenth stage” who are referred to as the buddhas’ “coexistent circle of disciples”; such buddhas are thus designated “the partially apparent body of perfect rapture.” Th ese enlightened beings manifest in fi ve styles, called wisdom families, so ubiquitous that Kongtrul does not mention their names here TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 541TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5416/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"542 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge(buddha, vajra, jewel, lotus, and action) when he lists their pure realms and their corresponding directions.In the course of their teachings, the partially apparent buddhas ema-nate six teachers (oft en referred to as six sages) to guide the six kinds of beings. Th e teachers are therefore forms of enlightenment fully apparent to ordinary beings; they include Buddha Shakyamuni, the Sage in our realm.It seems that no description of enlightenment’s appearance in worlds of ordinary beings could be complete without a mention of the other Unsurpassed, where in this version the Buddha manifests in a likeness of the body of perfect rapture rather than reenacting the process of enlightenment:In Unsurpassed [Heaven] of the pure domains, the most sub-lime place in Endurance and other [world-systems], before he appears in the world, the Buddha presents himself as a buddha endowed with the adorning marks and signs of physical perfec-tion similar to the qualities of the supreme body of rapture.In mentioning the teachings given to diff erent beings, Kongtrul weaves in uncommon, unconventional names of three ways or vehicles of spiri-tual development: the inner way of mastery, the way of techniques (refer-ring to the highest three tantras); the way of vedic asceticism (the three outer tantras); and the way that liberates from the origin of suff ering (the pre-tantric Buddhist teachings). When great perfection texts refer to the three ways of spiritual development (the three “yanas”), a reader could infer that these three are indicated.Although this chapter’s fi rst main section describes the teachings passed between enlightened beings directly from one wisdom mind to another, we read under the heading “How the Retinue Compiled the Teachings” that symbols and words were sometimes used to teach others, and that these teachings were compiled. Nevertheless, Kongtrul reassures us thatthese compilers are the self-manifestation of the primordial lord’s supreme wisdom, one in essence with Transcendent Conqueror Lord of Secrets. Th erefore, the teacher and his circle of disciples were indivisible within the constant state of equanimity of their wisdom minds . . .TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 542TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5426/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 543In other words, despite separate appearances, the seeming teacher and seeming recipients of the teachings were refl ections of the same encom-passing wisdom mind. Kongtrul fi nishes with the statement, “[I]ndividu-als with autonomous mind streams did not perform this compilation.” Th e term “autonomous mind stream” (Tibetan: “rang g yu,” rang rg yud) has not yet entered non-Asian Buddhist discourse. We discover it here in its common usage in the higher tantras, where it denotes a being dis-tracted from their inner enlightened nature by the chimera of dualistic experience. Th e opposite of that experience is alluded to in a common saying in the higher tantras: “Th e victors’ wisdom minds are one within the expanse” (“expanse” referring to the basic space of phenomena and the nature of reality). We have perhaps outlived the worst of the West’s misap-prehension of Buddhism’s “emptiness” as nothingness, a terrible void, but we have undoubtedly yet to exhaust its unease with reading “individuals with autonomous mind streams” as a pejorative. “Does being enlightened mean that we lose our individuality?” seems an obvious question. To give a fair and thorough response to it would require patiently teasing out all the assumed meanings of the word “individuality” and doing the same for what is indicated by “wisdom mind.” All Kongtrul does here is introduce a context in which a teaching occurs, given, received, and compiled by those for whom conventional categories of self and other are irrelevant. He concludes this section with a statement to underline the fact:To summarize these explanations, within the context of the framework of the teacher’s three bodies, wisdom mind has a single fl avor within evenness. Th us, there is nothing to teach and no teaching, yet the teachings appear as a seeming process that unfolds from wisdom’s manifest expression.We turn from the mysteries of wisdom minds’ transmission to that of slightly more approachable modes of expression—transmission of teach-ings through symbols passed between corporeal beings known as aware-ness holders, and oral transmission passed between human beings.For the fi rst, Kongtrul assumes our familiarity with his subject: he writes “the other two yogas” and never names them in this chapter as mahayoga and anuyoga, secure that we would know these collective terms for countless tantric meditations based mainly in the phase of creation (mahayoga) and the phase of completion (anuyoga).

Kalu Rinpoché used to say that our faces are invisible to us until a kind person shows us a mirror; likewise, we only encounter our awareness when a spiritual master’s pointing out instruc-tions—a mirror—allow us to see it. “Holder” is a delightfully ambivalent term in Tibetan (“dzin,” ’dzin), here used in a positive sense, but it more oft en denotes the opposite of release—clinging, grasping, holding on—all that Buddhist meditation aims to undo. Th e same term can mean to uphold, preserve, or sustain. In all those cases, the word implies a holder and something held; for an awareness holder, this is not true. Such indi-viduals are immersed in (thus “hold”) panoramic, nondual awareness as eff ortlessly as we immerse (or hold) ourselves in and feel apprehensive about anything other than dualistic, discursive consciousness. Th e path of great perfection leads to four degrees of awareness holder, culminating in the state of full enlightenment.In this section, Kongtrul introduces us to three groups of awareness holders who constitute the source of the lineage. Garab Dorjé, an Indian most oft en referred to by this Tibetan name, towers above them all; his birth story is recounted here. Manjushrimitra, Shri Singha, Jnanasutra, Vimalamitra, and Padmakara are the others listed as masters of atiyoga. Th is fi rst group includes only human beings, whereas the second has only nonhuman members, and the third has both. Kongtrul presents some details of the lineage but does not attempt to describe the symbols that were the means of transmission among these awareness holders.Th e fi nal of the three modes of transmission is the most familiar to us, that passed through audible words among human beings. At the source of this lineage, we again fi nd Garab Dorjé, and Kongtrul fi nishes with a tribute to Padmakara, Guru Rinpoché:Th e vajra of wisdom speech, Padmakara, demonstrated the process of requesting the teachings from each of these mas-ters; in meditation practice, he reached a state of knowledge and accomplishment superior to each of them. At that point, urged by the dakini, he retrieved from the Bliss-Giving Pin-nacle Stupa all the still-sealed tantras, scriptures, and pith in-structions, such as treasure chests of eight precious substances containing the general tantras. Th us, the complete transmis-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 544TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5446/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 545sion, convergence of them all, was gathered in this supreme master, who became the foremost teacher of secret mantra. Th roughout past, present, and future, his acts to aid beings equal the sky’s breadth.Although he mentions Guru Rinpoché in later chapters, this marks the highest praise he off ers him in Th e Treasury of Knowledge. Moreover, Kongtrul mentions treasures here not as a ubiquitous Tibetan phenom-enon but as an occurrence in long-ago India. Th e only lines he devotes to the subject of concealed teachings in Tibet are these (from Book Four, Chapter Th ree, “Th e History of Lineages of Meditation Practice in Tibet, the Eight Major Chariots”):[Guru Rinpoché] saw that there were not the circumstances nor was there the need to transmit most of his profound in-structions for meditation during that period, and considered the infi nite numbers of beings of the future. In the country’s four directions and in its central region, he sealed [his instruc-tions] with seven levels of seals and concealed them in ten million treasure sites with names, illustrated by the fi ve great treasures sites, and innumerable unnamed ones.Finally, what seems important to note is that in this chapter Kongtrul makes no hierarchical distinction among the three sources of the ancient tradition. According to those who preserve this tradition, none should be assumed. Th e three modes of transmission—through wisdom mind, symbols, and words—each contributed to the teachings, yet the mean-ing of all three is identical. It can be tempting to idealize the cleanliness of mind-to-mind teachings passed between enlightened beings, particu-larly when compared to the clumsiness of language spoken among human beings, yet if the concept of a lineage has any true meaning, it is that the living breath of all the teachings reaches us vital and undiminished in the person of our spiritual master. Buddhas and awareness holders have the luxury of nonverbal communication; we do not, but what is transmitted in language should correspond to exactly what the primordial buddhas and awareness holders shared among themselves. Th at is the promise of this and of all lineages.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 545TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5456/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"546 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeBook Four: Buddhism Resplendent in the WorldChapter One: Buddhism in the Land of Exalted BeingsBuddhist wisdom culture asserts that discernment, sincere appreciation, and verbalization of others’ positive qualities constitute acts that deeply enhance one’s own experience and contribute to one’s own eventual suc-cess. Worship of wisdom beings, be they human or not, can never be detrimental to us or subtract from whatever qualities we ourselves might possess. To rejoice in even the slightest merit of ordinary beings and to appreciate their qualities have also long been commended as a pillar of Buddhist practice.So it is that we fi nd Kongtrul, who tirelessly served Tibetan Buddhism all his life, bowing southward toward India in unison, it must be said, with all Tibetan masters before and since. “Land of exalted beings,” he calls it, rarely slipping into the more familiar and non-honorifi c “India.” It was not as if only saints walked Indian soil in those days, but suffi cient numbers of buddhas and bodhisattvas suff used its culture for a time that their lives and their impact are forever memorialized in Tibetan.Having surveyed the Buddha and his teaching in the previous books, Kongtrul now appraises the development of Buddhism in India aft er the Buddha. He introduces us to a tiny fraction of the incredible masters Indian Buddhism produced; in writing a short, comprehensive history of Buddhism in India, his intent was likely to focus upon the fi gures whose work would seed Buddhism in Tibet and throughout the Himalayas.Th e chapter begins with the period of Indian Buddhism before the advent of the great way, and we sense that Kongtrul dispenses with that long passage of time somewhat quickly: as he states later in this chapter, “in Tibet, no distinction was made between the great and lesser ways.” To be clear, this does not imply a loosening of the essential monastic vows among Tibetan practitioners, nor a blending of the two ways. Nevertheless, no Tibetan system countenances embrace of codes of personal ethical conduct outside of rigorous training in the bodhisattva path, just as they do not con-ceive of the bodhisattva path without a fi rm grounding in rejection of acts that harm others or are detrimental to one’s own buddha nature. Th erefore, regardless of the sterling qualities of the arhats—“foe destroyers”—who lived in the period of lesser way Indian Buddhism, they held less interest to Kongtrul or his readership than the subsequent masters, who fi rst wove the lesser and great ways into the rich and durable fabric the Tibetans still strive to duplicate, generation aft er generation.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 546TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5466/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 547On the subject of the great way, we commonly hear from the mouths of Tibetan masters that the Buddha imparted the teachings during his life-time, and the discourses in question confi rm that fact, yet it is rare to hear or read, as we do in the next sections on the spread of the great way and the vajra way, how the chronolog y of introduction of those teachings to human beings was strikingly diff erent from that of the lesser way. An arhat named Nanda “became the fi rst to hold the great way teachings”; he was joined by other exceptional masters during his lifetime, they gained royal patronage, and some fl edging acceptance: “[o]ne thousand, fi ve hundred practitioners of the great way appeared.” Th e provenance of the great way’s massive collec-tion of discourses is remarkable in itself, as Kongtrul mentions:Concurrently, the majority of great way discourses . . . were brought to the human world from such diverse regions as those of gods, nagas, celestial musicians, and cannibal spirits. In particular, many texts came from the nagas’ lands.In our day, when such regions seem the stuff of fancy, serious scholars generally elide what centuries of Buddhists have asserted, and sidestep the question of the discourses’ sources. Th at may work as a short-term strateg y for modern great way scholarship, but does not serve the larger Buddhist canon: the huge range of Indian Buddhist tantras and Tibetan treasure teachings share exactly the same visionary or supernatural origins. Tantras and treasure teachings are considered to be particularly problematic due to their late dates and idiosyncratic voices, yet it would seem that most if not all the staid and sober great way discourses have similar back-stories. And although their assimilation as classic Buddhist texts is beyond seri-ous dispute, such was not always the case: “Th ey disparaged the teachings: ‘Th e great way is not the Buddha’s word.’” Kongtrul attributes this disap-proval to jealousy, but solemn upholders of the lesser way could have been justifi ably alarmed at the turn of events and at the swelling of the canon with dramatically diff erent versions of the Buddha and his teaching. Kong-trul reports that the incomparable master Nagarjuna retrieved the fi nal great way discourse—the monumental Th e Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Th ousand Verses—from the nagas’ realm, “aft er which no new great way discourses appeared.” It remained to Nagarjuna and others the task of writing the great way irrevocably into the Buddhist conversation, which they succeeded in doing only over the course of centuries.Th e founding of institutions played a role in the success of the great way, TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 547TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5476/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"548 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeaccording to Kongtrul. He mentions the founding of Nalanda as a con-scious act on the part of great way masters to further their project. Th ey chose as its site the birthplace of one of the iconic fi gures of the lesser way—Shariputra—but constructed the antithesis of a spare and light space for forest-dwelling monks. Nalanda became a monastic university, teaching place, and repository for the new great way canon. Amid its ruins, modern visitors still see ample evidence of its founders’ sweeping ambitions for the great way and their open declaration in the form of decorative, exquisite sculpture that Buddhism had changed, and grown.Kongtrul steps aside from his narrative in this chapter (as he will do in the next) to provide details of the works of the masters he cares about. Here we are treated to an overview of the works of Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Dignaga, and Dharmakirti—the six adornments of the world, as they are collectively known—that Kongtrul feels were especially note-worthy in assuring the lasting prominence of the great way. Of the six, he accords the most attention to Nagarjuna and Asanga, the two major found-ers of the great way.In presenting Asanga’s life and work, Kongtrul describes the fi ve treatises that Asanga transcribed from teachings given by Bodhisattva Maitreya in the heavens. To return to the topic of the unusual provenance of great way teachings, not only did these fi ve essential treatises originate in the heav-ens, where Asanga spent twenty-fi ve human years, but two of the fi ve were unknown for more than fi ve hundred years aft er their composition, discov-ered by one of the main teachers of such Tibetan translators as Marpa—Métripa. Kongtrul recounts:Maitreya’s fi rst three teachings spread and became widely known from the beginning, but Discerning Between Phenome-na and Th eir Nature and Th e Highest Continuity were original-ly unknown to other scholars. At a later time [more than fi ve hundred years later], Métripa saw light shining from a crack in a stupa, where [he retrieved] these two texts. When Métripa prayed to noble Maitreya, the bodhisattva appeared clearly in a gap in the clouds and confi rmed the teachings.At this point in the text, Kongtrul is content to introduce the fi ve trea-tises, presenting them as “a continuous body of work,” the fi rst of the series including an introductory homage; the last, a dedication. He will return TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 548TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5486/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 549to these two texts—Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization and Highest Continuity—in more detail in the next chapter. He reviews a number of perspectives Indian and Tibetan scholars have affi rmed in relation to these fi ve treatises, and he saves the last word for the perspective that likely corresponds to his own: “Maitreya’s fi ve treatises are middle way texts, and they mostly teach extrinsic emptiness, the view of the great middle way.” We will examine the subject of extrinsic emptiness and its history in Tibet in the next chapter.In listing Vasubandhu’s eight dissertations, Kongtrul begins by claiming them to be original works, yet only the fi rst fi ve are counted to be indepen-dent texts, whereas the latter three are commentaries on others’ writings. Kongtrul does not note here that Taranata, one of his main authorities, raises that contradiction and urges the three be placed apart; Kongtrul instead quietly follows Butön’s lead in this case.Th e last major subject of this chapter is that of the origin and spread of tantric practice in India. As with the great way, Kongtrul never even breathes a suggestion that tantra belongs anywhere except as the crown of the Buddha’s canon, but he does locate its origins in time at points post-dating the wave of great way texts that appeared in India from other realms. Concerning the lower two tantras, action and conduct, he reports:. . . not long aft er the third compilation of the teachings, when all the great way discourses arrived together [in this world] and spread, [these two classes of tantra] were openly practiced, and they fl ourished.In relation to the higher, and infi nitely more numerous, tantras of the yoga and highest yoga groups, Kongtrul points fi rst to Saraha as the originator. Nevertheless, he situates his life at a distance of but three hundred years aft er the Buddha’s passing, not an opinion shared by modern researchers. Nevertheless, regardless of the era,Before Saraha, it seems that yoga and highest yoga tantras appeared directly only to supremely fortunate disciples but did not remain as a continuous transmission. Later, from this TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 549TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5496/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"550 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge superb master’s time forward, these tantras fl ourished and en-dured in continuous transmissions. Th erefore, Saraha is the supreme source of every tantra and accomplished master.In Saraha’s case, and in the lives of many other masters listed in this chapter, Kongtrul uses a word translated here as “retrieved,” “drew forth,” or “brought” to describe how the specifi c master came to possess spe-cifi c tantras. Th e implication of the word (Tibetan: “chen-drang,” spyan drangs—an honorifi c word oft en used to mean “to invite”) is that the tantras lay undiscovered in a geographical site—oft en Oddiyana, usually situated in the far northwest corner of the Indian subcontinent—or as content accessible only through visions, and that the master received that which corresponded to his (or her) spiritual propensity and realization. As with the great way texts, no original human authorship is admitted or implied, although the transcription process is necessarily idiosyncratic and leaves traces of each transcriber, whoever he or she may have been.Kongtrul does not mention in this section tantra having undergone the process of initial rejection and later assimilation that occurred when the great way surged on the Indian scene. I have included above (in the notes to Chapter One of Book Th ree, “What the Buddha Taught”) a quotation from Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa that affi rms this to have been the case. Nevertheless, it must be said that tantra by its nature did not aim for widespread public acceptance, and in the end, its strategies for validation as Buddhist source texts seem to mirror those of the great way: having impressive spiritual masters affi liate with it, and creating dazzling institutions. For the fi rst, tantra could claim (well aft er the fact) that some of the brightest lights of the great way had been in fact early tantric adepts. Kongtrul mentions how it is that Nagarjuna (here referred to as “the exalted master”), doyen of the great way, resurfaced many hundreds of years aft er his life as a major proponent of tantra. Some of course say that there were two Nagarjunas, he who retrieved the texts on sublime insight and whose writings became the pillars of the great way, and another who belongs to tantric lineages. Th is does not appear to be Kongtrul’s view:Th e exalted master’s direct disciple Nagabodhi attained vajra rainbow body and lived at Shriparvata, where about seven hundred years aft er Nagarjuna’s passing, he accepted two dis-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 550TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5506/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 551ciples, the untouchable Matangipa and Prince Gomishra, to whom he gave the exalted master’s cycle of teachings.As for tantric institutions, Kongtrul mentions just one stellar example—Vikramashila Monastery, which like Nalanda was situated in northern India within traveling range of Tibet. Royal patronage was involved in its construction. By the time of its founding in the ninth century, the range of accepted tantras available was likely suffi ciently varied and complex, and the collections of the canon and treatises burgeoning, to require such major institutions even just to preserve the tradition. Further, whatever their drawbacks, these large campuses attracted incredible talents. Read-ers will note in this section, as in the rest of his story of how Buddhism spread and journeyed to Tibet, that for Kongtrul, Buddhism’s spread means from person to person. He never tarries long on the subject of temples or institutions, Indian or Tibetan—they were simply means to an end. He measured their success not by an institution’s size or longev-ity, but only by whether or not great masters learned, taught, or wrote there.Chapter Two: How Buddhist Monastic Discipline and Scriptural Transmissions Came to TibetTh is, the longest and most challenging chapter of this book, begins the three sections that describe Buddhism’s arrival in Tibet, which for Kong-trul means the study and practice of Buddhism. In writing hundreds of pages of dense histories, he fi nds only enough space for a few spare sentences that mention religious institutions or for the many whose lives were spent in their sanctuary. Instead, he focuses relentlessly on the masters and disciples who were instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibetans, those who translated its foundational texts, and those who sustained its vitality.Th e chapter begins with two versions of the origins of the Tibetan people, and some possible sources of the Tibetan royal line. According to Kongtrul, the Tibetan people are either descended from the union of a bodhisattva-ape and a female ogre or are the progeny of a king who fl ed battle disguised as a woman, an event presumably described in the Mahabharata, since the victors are named as the fi ve Pandava brothers, who lived in that epic Indian poem.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 551TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5516/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"552 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTibet’s rulers do not necessarily share the same origins as their peo-ple, it would seem. A number of possibilities for the royalty’s sources are mentioned: all except one (which originated in another continent alto-gether) point to India’s rulers, including the Licchavi clan, a branch of the Shakya clan. Whatever diff erent Tibetan scholars’ opinions of the rulers’ origins, each major fi gure among them who was instrumental in bringing Buddhism to Tibet has become identifi ed with a bodhisattva: Lha Totori Nyentsen with Bodhisattva Ever Excellent; Songtsen Gampo, with All-Seeing One; his minister Gar Tong-tsen Yul-zung , with Vajra Holder; his Nepalese queen, with Frowning Goddess; his Chinese queen, with Tara; the father of the Tibetan script, with Gentle Melody; King Trisong Déutsen, with the same bodhisattva; and King Ralpachen, with Vajra Holder. In fact, the Tibetan people still revere these early rulers as gods in human form (or as incarnate bodhisattvas) more than they recall their Indian royal blood-lines.Woven into the account of the kings we fi nd the story of Buddhism’s arrival in Tibet. What strikes the reader is the Tibet-centered nature of this history. We do not read of the many Indian masters’ inspiration to take Buddhism northward (a perspective some histories favor); instead we learn of the Tibetan kings’ intent and initiative to convert and civilize their country, which led them to invite foreign spiritual masters.Central to Buddhism’s integration with Tibetan society was the trans-lation of the wealth of Indian and Chinese Buddhist sacred literature. While all histories of this era mention the hundred and eight Indian scholars and meditation masters who supervised a group of exceptional Tibetan translators, few go on to recount a major revision of their work carried out under the command of Trisong Déutsen’s grandson, King Ral-pachen. Th at king’s remarks (quoted by Kongtrul) given to translators and scholars of his day to explain the need for and the methods of the revision are astounding :In my forefathers’ time, when the translators and scholars translated the teachings, among terms unknown in Tibetan, they used some words inconsistent with Buddhist scriptures and the vyakarana system, and which are diffi cult to under-stand. For these, search for valuable words from our language and add them, revising the translations to make them consis-tent with the terminolog y of the lesser and great ways.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 552TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5526/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 553I fi nd it diffi cult to believe that the scholars and translators of King Trisong Déutsen’s time used language that contradicted Buddhist scriptures or “the vyakarana system.” Th is latter term could refer to a grammatical sys-tem (a possibility which seems highly unlikely) or a series of eight com-mentaries of key Buddhist texts by Vasubandhu given the same collective name. What seems credible to me is that the original translations had included “terms unknown in Tibetan” which rendered the works insuf-fi ciently accessible to most readers, thus “diffi cult to understand.” In a word, the terms were foreign. Th at “the one hundred and eight scholars, including that abbot and master, as well as Master Vimalamitra, Shantin-garbha, and Dharmakirti; and Tibetan translators, including Bérotsana, Kawa Paltsek, and Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen” produced translations that were faulty in doctrine and shoddy in grammar strains all credibility. Kong-trul seems to point to the true motive—that the august fi rst translation process had resulted in technically perfect but inaccessible books—when he goes on to report of the revision, “most of the scriptures translated during his forefathers’ time were fi nalized using contemporary language.” Notably, he does not mention any correction of doctrinally unacceptable language.Monastic Discipline Arrives in TibetAt the outset of the next section, which describes the origins of monas-tic discipline in Tibet, Kongtrul takes a single sentence to lay forth a core principle of Buddhist practice and life in all countries considered “Buddhist”:Whether or not the Victor’s doctrine exists [in any country] is determined only upon whether or not the training and prac-tice of the vows of individual liberation exist there.While all systems of monastic vows and the monastic community’s inter-nal functions are based on the same basic legal system, no unanimity exists in relation to the monastic vows’ duration in a person’s lifetime. Some countries, like Th ailand, have a fl exible set of options—short- or long-term commitment to the vows—whereas others, like Tibet, off er a single choice: a life-long pledge. Yet regardless of the vows’ duration in individual cases, the Buddha’s entire system for the life of his renunciant followers seems indispensable: too much of the Buddha’s wisdom and TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 553TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5536/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"554 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgespirit are found within his community’s legal code for it to be subtracted from the whole and still bear the name Buddhism.Kongtrul tells how Tibetan men fi rst took monastic vows—at the ini-tial instigation of the king , who pressed one of his advisors to take vows. He was followed by six others, who became the test group. Once it was deemed a success, many joined them. Th en,. . . the king instituted the major Buddhist law that the king and his subjects should all make those who had renounced home life the foremost recipients of their off erings, and should honor, venerate, and respect them. A stone pillar with this edict [engraved upon it] was erected.Th ose happy days did not last. In the wake of an anti-Buddhist king and a general suppression of Buddhist practice, Tibet’s monastic com-munity was reduced to shreds—just three monks, short of the quorum necessary to pass on the vows. When two Chinese monks joined them, the vow lineage survived but was soon overtaken once again by events:Lachen Gongpa Rabsal granted the full ordination at one time without having completed the requisite ten-year supplementa-ry qualifi cation for an elder. Nevertheless, because Lachen was known to be a bodhisattva acting on his aspirations, because [the others who offi ciated] on this occasion—Mar Shakya-muni, Yo Géjung, and Tsang Rabsal—were special individu-als, and because there was an important purpose in that the doctrine had reached a crossroad between its disappearance or re-emergence, holy persons deemed the ordination appropri-ate, and authorized it as faultless.Buddhism and its monastic discipline had come to Tibet thanks to a series of enlightened kings, but the same royal authority came close to annihi-lating it. In the resolution of this specifi c controversy (caused by a monk acting as an elder before having spent ten years as a full-fl edged member of the monastic community, in contravention of Buddhist law), we see a signifi cant shift in authority from kings or Indian Buddhist masters to unnamed home-grown Buddhist “holy persons.” Tibetans still worship and mourn the passing of their best, bodhisattva ruler kings, but they TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 554TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5546/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 555retain the awful memory of that same authority wielded in error.Kongtrul fi nishes this section with information on two other lineages of vows that reached Tibet. He leaves the reader to speculate on when monastic vows were fi rst accepted by women in Tibet, and whether or not their vow lineages followed the same patterns and shared the same favor or slow decline as their male counterparts.A History of the Study of BuddhismTh e conclusion of the accounts of monastic discipline’s introduction to Tibet marks the end of the narrative history part of this chapter. Kongtrul sets the stage for the rest of Book Four with what he calls a “preface”—a few words that elucidate his orientation toward Buddhist history, for he entitled this book, “how this doctrine grew and spread throughout this world.” To defi ne what he means by the Buddhist doctrine, he quotes a famous verse from Vasubandhu to the eff ect that what we call Buddhism comes down to two things: sacred texts and spiritual realization, which are preserved only in teaching and study for the fi rst, and in meditation practice for the second. He doesn’t spell out what soon becomes obvi-ous to the reader: if we accept that Buddhism comprises scripture and realization, then a purely Buddhist history of Buddhism will trace the preservation of lineages of scholarship (the remainder of this chapter) and of meditation practice (the next).Th us, for the rest of this chapter, Kongtrul delves into the lineages of scriptural transmission in fi ve fi elds: monastic discipline, observed phenomena, sublime insight, the middle way, and tantra (in Sanskrit: vinaya, abhidharma, prajnaparamita, madhyamaka, tantra). From the perspective of teachers, these can be called subjects of scholarship; for us as students, they are what constitute the indispensable core subjects of a well-rounded Buddhist education. Each of these is essential; for a Buddhist education, other areas of study or interest are of comparatively minor import (Kongtrul devotes the last chapter of this book to those ancillary fi elds). Each section in this chapter follows the same pattern: Kongtrul provides a short survey of the Indian origins of the teach-ings in question, the foundational texts of that fi eld, and the important Indian masters and their commentaries. He then turns our attention to how those scriptural transmissions reached Tibet, the early Tibetan masters and commentaries, and how their teaching systems fared over time.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 555TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5556/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"556 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e Study of Buddhist LawOn the subject of monastic discipline, Kongtrul mentions the Indian master Gunaprabha’s work Th e Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline, in which he “systematized what had lacked order in the four scriptures, subsuming their topics into [the monastic legal code’s] seventeen bases.” As one text states, “Th e entire [monastic disciplinary code] is contained within [seventeen] bases” and goes on to list them:(1) Ordination, (2) confession,(3) Th e lift ing of restrictions, (4) the rainy season [retreat], and (5) [rules concerning ] the use of leather articles,(6) Food and medicines, (7) robes, (8) the making and the distribution [of the robes],(9) Koshambi (legal procedures in case of disagreements over formal procedures), (10) formal procedures,(11) Th e Pandulohitaka (for amending downfalls through subjugation), (12) [factors concerning ] the individual,(13) Demotion, (14) suspension from confession,(15) [Rules concerning ] monastery sites and monks’ quarters, (16) procedures [for settling ] disputes, and (17) procedures [to resolve] schisms in the community. (Buddhist Ethics, pp. 129–130)Th is kind of systematic approach which organized a large volume of textual information into a useful and accessible form typifi es Buddhist treatises at their best. Further, although at fi rst glance no subject could seem more prosaic than monastic discipline, it forms the basis of the path to enlightenment. Th us Kongtrul tells us that a later Tibetan master, Tsonapa the Great, “in a dream, received teachings on Th e Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline from Gunaprabha. At the request of the protector Trakshé, he composed such texts as a detailed explanation of monastic discipline, Rays of Sunlight, and thereby established the foundation for the doctrine of monastic discipline.”Th e Study of Observed PhenomenaIn the next section as well, on the study of observed phenomena, we read that “Th e great Scholar Shakyashri taught Th e Treasury of Observed Phe-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 556TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5566/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 557nomena to Sakya Pandit, who received teachings from Vasubandhu in his dreams for one month.

All that one stud-ies is directly or indirectly rooted in the Buddha’s spiritual realization, if not in others’ visions, dreams, or meditative experiences. Th e purpose of one’s study is not to absorb the lessons of someone else’s wisdom; the sole purpose of study is to lead one to the same experience and realization, beyond words and concepts.In the section on the study of observed phenomena, Kongtrul fi nishes his presentation of the teaching systems and their lineages, then provides a short overview of the contents of Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena. He will repeat this format in each major section of this chapter from now on.Th e Study of the Perfection of Sublime InsightIn the section on the perfection of sublime insight, it is noteworthy that, once again, some of the core texts arose in visionary experiences. Th e fi rst mentioned, Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization, is a transcript of teachings given in the heavens by Bodhisattva Maitreya to Asanga, who had spent twelve years in meditation retreat before traveling to the heav-ens to receive instruction. Haribhadra, one of the later prolifi c masters of this subject, wrote with the express blessing of the same Maitreya.At the end of this section, Kongtrul outlines the contents of Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization. Understanding this text represents a diff erent order of diffi culty from Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena or the monastic legal code, for example, which are foundational texts in their own right, and mines of information presented whole. On the other hand, Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization is a commentary that systematizes a huge body of work—the discourses on the perfection of sublime insight. Th erefore, its topics refer to a separate collection and presuppose a reader’s familiarity with it. As Kongtrul states, Th e Orna-ment of Manifest Realization “constitutes a treatise of pith instructions that elucidate the intent of discourses on the perfection of sublime insight” and again, that it presents “the hidden meaning of the perfection of sublime insight—the stages of manifest realization.”A reader must be alert to this intertextuality when reading Kongtrul’s TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 557TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5576/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"558 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgesynopsis of this treatise. He plunges into a presentation of the eight points or main topics that provide the structure of Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization, which itself gives this list:Eight points fully elucidateTh e perfection of sublime insight:Knowledge of all aspects of phenomena, knowledge of paths,Knowledge of everything,Manifest perfect realization of all aspects,Reaching the peak, culmination,Instantaneous manifest perfect awakening,And the body of ultimate enlightenment. Th ese are the eight points.When Kongtrul describes each of these eight points, readers may feel as if some information is missing , which may be true in that he assumes that we’ve read and absorbed the discourses on sublime insight. As he wrote elsewhere in this text, “Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization employs eight main topics and seventy branch points to defi ne the hidden meaning of the perfection of sublime insight.” Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization off ers a lens through which we can clearly view the content and import of another set of texts. Aft er a brief description of the eight points, Kongtrul correlates the eight with chapters in the discourse, then delineates the seventy-part hidden meaning contained within the eight points. Our reading gives us a sense of an airtight system, a precision instrument ideal for understanding a body of work with which we are likely unfamiliar. Perhaps Kongtrul meant this bracing passage as a spur for us to revisit the discourses on the perfec-tion of sublime insight, this time armed with Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization as a guide.Th at having been said, Kongtrul would be the fi rst to admit that what one takes away from Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization refl ects one’s own perspective. In the previous chapter, “Buddhism in the Land of Exalted Beings,” he listed the very diff erent ways in which many great past masters had interpreted the text’s message:Master Vasubandhu, Dignaga, Shantipa, and others explain Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization as a text that expounds the view of aspects of consciousness. Exalted Haribhadra, Jnanapada, Abhayakaragupta, Lord Atisha, and others explain TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 558TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5586/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 559it to be a text that expounds the view of the lack of inherent nature. Most earlier and later Tibetan scholars consider it a commentary on the second turning of the wheel, present-ing the independently verifi able reason view. Venerable Lord Mikyö Dorjé, Tsongkapa, and others consider that it presents the consequentialist view. Th e omniscient lord of the Jonang teachings, the spiritual father [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] and his heirs, consider that apart from mere diff erences in degree, Maitreya’s fi ve treatises are middle way texts, and that they mostly teach extrinsic emptiness, the view of the great middle way.Th e Ornament of Manifest Realization may be unanimously acclaimed as the essential guide to the discourses of the perfection of sublime insight, yet the choice of an essential guide to Th e Ornament of Manifest Realiza-tion itself seems far more challenging.Th e Study of Intrinsic and Extrinsic EmptinessWe read in the last line of the quote above the words “extrinsic empti-ness” and the last section contained a passing reference to “intrinsic emp-tiness.” Th ese two terms provide the organizing principles for Kongtrul’s presentation of the origins of lineages of scholarship in the middle way, yet he does not defi ne in this section what he means by these key terms. For that, we must turn to a later chapter of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy, for which we are fortunate to have Elizabeth Callahan’s excellent translation and extraordinarily helpful introduction. Here she encapsulates the diff erences according to Jamgön Kongtrul between the views of intrinsic emptiness and extrinsic empti-ness (appearing here in Tibetan—Rangtong and Shentong ):[T]he Shentong and Rangtong systems do not diff er in the way they determine all conventional phenomena to be empty, nor do they disagree that the extremes of conceptual elaboration cease during meditative equipoise. Th ese two systems only dif-fer in their exposition of their philosophical tenet systems. As a conventional position, Shentong Proponents state that the consummate characteristic, or dharmata, exists, and Rangtong Proponents say that it does not exist. Shentong Proponents state that nondual primordial wisdom is truly established at TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 559TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5596/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"560 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe time of fi nal analysis by means of reasonings that analyze for ultimacy, and Rangtong Proponents do not make such as-sertions. Th e Shentong position is that ultimate reality is not simply a nonimplicative negation—that is the way the imag-ined and dependent characteristics are empty. For them, the ultimate is primordial wisdom, which is empty of the duality of perceived and perceiver. (Frameworks of Buddhist Philoso-phy, p. 48)In our chapter, intrinsic emptiness is presented fi rst, its source texts written by Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti. Th e view of extrinsic emptiness fi nds its sources in Maitreya’s fi ve texts and in the writings of Asanga. Th ese are called the two great chariot systems, as Kongtrul states:What equal the sun and moon—which alone ornament the sky of the great Sage’s teachings—are none other than the scriptural traditions of the two great chariot[-systems]. . . Th e supreme traditions of these two chariots do not contradict each other: one emphasizes outer principles, the other inner principles. (ibid., p. 262)Callahan adds a note at that point to explain:Nagarjuna’s system emphasizes from the “outer,” or objective, side, that the ultimate nature is emptiness, whereas Maitreya and Asanga’s system emphasizes from the “inner,” or subjec-tive, side that the ultimate nature is nondual primordial wis-dom. (ibid., p. 403, n. 852)Indeed, Kongtrul quotes Shakya Chokden:For explaining the thought of Nagarjuna, the Rangtong ex-egetical system is superior; and for elucidating the thought of the exalted Maitreya, the Shentong mode is most profound. Th e scriptures and reasonings of one, therefore, are not able to negate the other. (ibid., p. 265)Within the intrinsic emptiness view, two schools developed, men-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 560TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5606/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 561tioned in this section by name but without explanation: the consequen-tialist and the independently verifi able reason schools. Of their origin, Kongtrul writes:Bhavaviveka read Buddhapalita’s commentary, wrote a refuta-tion, and started his own school. Chandrakirti refuted it and supported Buddhapalita’s original tradition; thus, two schools are known.In Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy, he gives a short explanation of their diff erences (“independently verifi able reason” appears here in Sanskrit, Sva-tantrika; “consequentialist,” as Prasangika):Th e followers of Bhavaviveka are called Svatantrikas because they assert, as a convention that is part of their own system, that all phenomena are without arising, are empty, and so forth. As proofs [of those assertions], they primarily use independently [verifi able] reasons in which the three modes are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things.Th e followers of Chandrakirti are called Prasangikas, be-cause they accept that [phenomena] are without arising, are empty, and so forth only from the perspective of others, which means that they commit to this only to refute others’ mistaken ideas. [For Prasangikas] there are no independently [verifi able] reasons in which the three modes are established through the power of their [relationship to real] things. Th erefore, they primarily just use consequences to demonstrate to Realists their internal contradictions. (p. 204)What seems most important to take away from this discussion is an appreciation of how vitally important both these views are to us as Bud-dhists of the middle way. Kongtrul does not introduce any hint of confl ict between the two; he simply presents their respective origins. In Frame-works of Buddhist Philosophy, he insists on their complementary nature. Th e following passage from Callahan’s introduction shows how each view can inform our practice of tantric meditation (“middle way” appears here in Sanskrit, Madhyamaka; “generation stage” here appears elsewhere in this book as “the phase of creation”):TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 561TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5616/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"562 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeGeneration stage practice involves imagining deities and their mandalas. Th e practice of the completion stage is to remain within primordial wisdom. Each stage has two aspects, for which either the Rangtong or the Shentong expression of Madhyamaka is more profound. Th e fi rst aspect of genera-tion phase practice is the ground for the arising of the deities. Shentong-Madhyamaka explanations clarify how the seed syl-lables and emblems (from which the deities manifest) arise within emptiness and are expressions of nondual primordial wisdom. Th e second aspect of generation phase practice is that these deities manifest without conceptual elaborations. Rangtong-Madhyamaka teachings are more useful for under-standing this. In terms of the completion phase, fi rst we must let go of any fi xations on the generation phase by dissolving the visualization of the deities and mandalas and resting without reference points. Th e Rangtong approach is most eff ective for this phase. However, simply resting without reference points is not the actual completion-phase wisdom. Th e second aspect of completion phase is the actual completion-phase wisdom: the primordial wisdom of connate great bliss. Th is is described in the Shentong-Madhyamaka teachings. (ibid., p. 49)Th e Study of TantraKongtrul now turns our attention to tantra, the fi nal subject of this sur-vey of scholastic transmissions that reached Tibet. He devotes as many pages on this single subject as he did for the previous four. As essential as the common ways of spiritual development are within Buddhism, their sacred texts, commentaries, and proponents never claim to deliver their adherents to enlightenment except aft er imponderably numerous life-times of spiritual practice. Th ey also do not promise ease and a variety of techniques; in a word, user-friendliness. In contrast, tantra repeatedly boasts of its effi ciency—enlightenment in this very lifetime, or immedi-ately aft er death, or in the course of a short series of lifetimes—ease of use, and clarity among a large number of diverse techniques. As Kongtrul remarks in Systems of Buddhist Tantra, all paths lead to tantra, and only tantra (or “mantra” in this quote) leads to enlightenment:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 562TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5626/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 563Th e culmination of the path of training in the way of the perfections gives rise to none other than the mantric path of training in the mind of its practitioners. Th erefore, the ulti-mate direct result of the perfections is not full awakening. Th e culmination of all aspects on the path of training in the mantra way directly yields the result of full awakening. Th at being the case, the fully awakened state is the direct result solely of the culmination of the mantric path of training. (Systems of Bud-dhist Tantra, p. 82)Not everyone may believe this; Kongtrul does, and from the evidence of what Tibetans collected and preserved of Indian Buddhism, and what they spent the ensuing centuries practicing and writing about, Himala-yan Buddhist masters of all affi liations also believed it. Th is core belief informs Kongtrul’s priorities in his writing ; he refl ects the values of the past masters and writers he emulates, and his prolifi c writing is so tantra-oriented that in sum it is as if he declares to his readers: “If the suff ering of sentient beings leaves you aghast and determined to attain full awakening for their benefi t as quickly and easily as you possibly can, once you have completed your education in basic Buddhism, here is what you really need to know—tantra.”Kongtrul begins by stating that he will present the later tantras’ teach-ing transmissions before those of the early translations. Th e early period lasted less than eighty years. Chinese records at the time state that Trisong Déutsen ascended the throne in 756 (according to an esteemed modern Tibetan scholar, Dungkar Lozang Trinlé). Th e construction of Samyé Monastery lasted from 762–767, by which time the fi rst Tibetan monks were ordained and the translation project begun. Tri Ralpachen, Trisong Déutsen’s grandson who ordered a revision of the fi rst translations, died in 841, to be followed by his brother who succeeded (during fi ve calami-tous years until his assassination in 846) in eradicating Buddhist activity in central Tibet. Th e dynasty itself collapsed in 869, although Ralpachen’s demise must certainly be taken as the end date of the early translation period, one characterized by centralized organization: the royal fam-ily sponsored the project, Indian scholars and masters supervised, and Tibetan translators worked in teams with a number of lead translators and a constellation of lesser translators and scribes surrounding each. Th ey TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 563TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5636/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"564 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeproved both prolifi c and inspired, for their basic vocabulary choices and much of their writing style were adopted in many subsequent Tibetan translations.Th e later translation period began in roughly 1042, when the great Indian master Atisha arrived in Tibet (he passed away there in 1054). Th is period of translation resembles our present haphazard production of Buddhist translations from Asian to Western languages. Tibet then lacked both a central secular and religious authority, as well as a spon-soring dynasty; Indian masters and Tibetan translators worked together independently on both sides of the Himalayas; no central library col-lected or coordinated their work. Huge amounts of valuable work were done, yet sometimes in duplicate: for example, Kongtrul counts twenty-four variant translations of a single tantra (Th e Wheel of Time)!Th e later translations’ tantras are assigned one of four categories: action, conduct, yoga, and highest yoga. Kongtrul dispenses quickly with the fi rst three, ending the single section on the action and conduct tantras with what will become a recurring refrain throughout the part of this chapter on the tantras: “Yet, apart from these, no continuity of teaching systems remains.” By the chapter’s end, Kongtrul will account somewhat for the unhappy fate of many of the tantras’ teaching transmissions in Tibet; in the meantime, we are surprised at what would appear to be a recurring pattern of negligence on the part of tantra’s Tibetan custodians.Th e Father TantrasWhen Kongtrul turns to the highest yoga tantras, he introduces the father tantras’ three families—of desire, of anger, and of stupidity. Cen-tral to the family of desire is a wisdom deity called Matrix of Mystery (Tibetan: Sangwa-dupa, gsang ba ’dus pa; Sanskrit: Guhyasamaja). Per-sons most strongly driven by desire engage in this cycle of teachings which uses desire as a technique for spiritual awakening. Kongtrul reports that six of the twenty-four Indian lineages of teaching of this tantra reached Tibet; among them, two were particularly outstanding, of which one centered on the practice, the other on the teaching system. Th e former, that of Marpa the Translator, included seven teaching systems, none of which lasted until Kongtrul’s time. Th e latter thrives within the Géluk tradition.As he has done for previous subjects, Kongtrul interrupts his nar-rative of teaching transmissions to describe the basic text. In this case, TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 564TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5646/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 565he provides more details of the Matrix of Mystery system than of any other, before or aft er. Th e challenge for a reader is to allow oneself to be carried by Kongtrul through the tantra’s subjects, a bracing experience that reveals a seemingly unlimited horizon for further elaboration. Th ese dense pages help us comprehend how it is that commentaries to tantras can fi ll large volumes and yet manage to be compellingly readable; per-haps Kongtrul wrote this overview to encourage his readership to pick up just such a commentary.Matrix of Mystery tantra has six subjects, the fi rst of which concerns the individual who is the “worthy vessel” for this tantra. We sense how far outside of typical Buddhist territory we have ventured when individuals untroubled by desire are lumped together with those engaged in lower Buddhist paths in the category of unsuitable practitioners of this tantra. Th e fi ft h subject of the tantra is that of techniques of experiential cultiva-tion, how the tantra becomes a spiritual practice. Th is entails receiving an empowerment then embarking on the path of liberation. In this case, the customary order of conduct and meditation (“settling in evenness”) are reversed, and once again, this being the family of desire tantra, desire is highlighted as the path: “the conduct of desire for the diligent to achieve enlightenment within their lifetime”; other forms of conduct are said to lead to the goal only aft er this or many other lifetimes.In relation to meditation, the tantra presents both the phase of creation (“which indirectly makes wisdom arise”) and the phase of completion (“which directly makes wisdom arise”). Under the heading of the phase of creation, Kongtrul does not describe Matrix of Mystery’s sacred circle that encompasses thirty-two deities. He labels such visualization practice “training in single-minded concentration on coarse [phenomena] using familiarity with the deities’ substantial [appearances].” He touches on the other familiar aspect of tantric Buddhist deity meditation—mantra reci-tation—under the heading of “conceptual contemplative practice, attach-ment to and conceptualization of very subtle phenomena,” where he calls mantra recitation a lesser technique. Th ese two forms of meditation are designated “the approach” whereas what he calls “the practice” refers to employing techniques learned to achieve accomplishments, which Kong-trul lists.We then turn to the crux of the tantra, the phase of completion. Each tantra has its own phase of completion system, and each its own termi-nolog y; regardless of the tantra, the phase of creation is regarded as a TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 565TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5656/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"566 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgenecessary step, but just a step nonetheless, toward the phase of comple-tion, “which directly makes wisdom arise.” Most teachers and commen-tators of tantras emphasize the phase of completion for that reason. Certainly it is within the phase of completion that we discover each tan-tra’s special character more than in the sometimes ornate complexities of the phase of creation’s visualization of deities in regalia.Matrix of Mystery’s phase of completion system is known as “the fi ve stages.” Kongtrul refers to them throughout this section without listing them. When he arrives at the phase of completion, he presents “the six aspects of approach and accomplishment—fi ve stages of approach, and accomplishment of union.” Matrix of Mystery’s fi ve stages are not the fi ve stages of approach (physical solitude, vocal solitude, mental solitude, illu-sory body, and clear light), but in fact the second (vocal solitude) through the fi ft h, plus union.Kongtrul does not describe these six aspects of approach and accom-plishment; he merely lists the topics that are used in the tantra and its commentaries to elucidate them. In the end of the section on the phase of completion, he off ers us a small map of the terrain he just covered, explaining why we would follow these stages of practice:Among those six [aspects of approach and accomplishment], the initial three solitudes make the body, speech, and mind pliable; and they set a foundation for tranquil abiding. Th e latter three primarily teach insight, the abiding nature of things: illusory body, the emptiness of the [mind’s] objects, is the proximate cause of the body of perfect rapture; clear light, the emptiness of mind, is the ultimate truth; and [the accom-plishment of union,] the emptiness of nondual mind and its objects, the indivisible two truths, abides as the result.Having presented the tantra’s six topics, Kongtrul turns our attention to an analysis of how the tantra was expressed. Th is involves judging the intent of the tantra’s words: is a specifi c passage or teaching meant liter-ally or not? Does it express provisional or defi nitive meaning ? Is there an implicit meaning implied or not? When we read the tantras we must resolve these questions, using the keys called the six parameters and four modes. Nevertheless, at a certain point in his discussion, Kongtrul informs us that he will provide a more complete picture of these subjects TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 566TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5666/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 567“below,” by which he means later in Th e Treasury of Knowledge, specifi cally Systems of Buddhist Tantra, pp. 286–290. In that book, those pages end with the comment that he had just explained the six parameters and four modes “according to the tradition of the Guhyasamaja Tantra,” in other words, this same Matrix of Mystery. He states at the outset of that section (“Exposition Methods in Highest Yoga Tantra”) that these two and other teaching methods among “the seven ornaments” fi nd their source in this tantra of Matrix of Mystery, although they are used to elucidate the high-est tantras in general (ibid., p. 283).As Kongtrul ends his own brief presentation of Matrix of Mystery tantra, which is as dense and demanding as some entire chapters of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, he writes this by way of an explanation for his care in setting forth the tantra’s content:Th is is not a Buddha related to a limited realm and set of dis-ciples but one who epitomizes all buddhas’ assembly or ma-trix, a body of integral union, known as supreme Buddha Vajra Bearer or “the one who is all buddhas.” It is taught, “Th is is the place of the ultimate. Th erefore, its means of expression, the verbal Matrix of Mystery [tantra], is the crown of all tantras.” It is thought that even the bodhisattvas’ commentaries on Wheel of Time present Matrix of Mystery’s meaning, the tan-tras of Vajra of Delight are oriented toward Matrix of Mystery, and the Wheel of Supreme Bliss [tantras] elucidate Matrix of Mystery’s ultimate nature.In this chapter, Kongtrul lavishes such attention on no other tantra. In fact, the next family of tantras, that of anger, is not described at all, just its lines of teaching transmissions.Th e tantra that exemplifi es the stupidity family, Th e Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri, has been interpreted in diff erent ways, as Kongtrul states:Th e bodhisattvas elucidated it as part of the Wheel of Time tradition; Lalitavajra, as a father tantra of the highest yoga tan-tras; Manjushrikirti and Manjushrimitra, as a yoga tantra. It is even said that in Tibet it is elucidated as great perfection, and in India as the middle way.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 567TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5676/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"568 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh is again reveals the importance of the commentators who interpret a tantra to us. Each author—realized masters all—had the same text in hand; each understood those same words in a radically diff erent manner. Regardless of how this specifi c tantra is framed, Kongtrul recommends it to us with a quote from Stainless Light, a commentary to Th e Wheel of Time Tantra:Th ose who do not know Th e Full Litany of the Names of Man-jushri do not know Buddha Vajra Bearer’s wisdom body. Th ose who do not know Buddha Vajra Bearer’s wisdom body do not know the secret mantra way. Th ose who do not know the se-cret mantra way are beings dwelling in the wheel of life, since they live apart from the path of the Transcendent Conqueror Vajra Bearer.Nevertheless, Kongtrul does not enter into the details of the tantra as he did with Matrix of Mystery. He simply lists the fourteen chapters that a king of Shambhala assigned the tantra’s contents.Th e Mother TantrasTh e next main subject is the three families of mother tantras, here referred to as the héruka family, the family of permanence, and the Vajrasattva family. “Héruka,” a generic term for a wrathful deity, is used here as a code word for the vajra wisdom family and its chief buddha, Unmov-ing. Likewise, “permanence” indicates the buddha wisdom family and its chief buddha, Illuminator.Many deities belong to the héruka family; Kongtrul here presents two of the most prevalent ones, Wheel of Supreme Bliss (Tibetan: Korlo Demchok, ’khor lo bde mchog; Sanskrit: Chakrasamvara) and Vajra of Delight (Tibetan: Gyépa Dorjé, dg yes pa rdo rje; Sanskrit: Hévajra). In the section on the Tantra of Supreme Bliss, Kongtrul ends his description of the teaching lineages with presentations of two teaching systems, by Jampal Nyingpo and Taranata. For the fi rst, Kongtrul lists the six topics that constitute the tantra’s subject, but when he arrives at the actual teach-ing in the tantra’s fi ft y-one chapters, he leaves the reader with, “Second, [the full explanation] comprises the forty-nine remaining chapters.”His presentation of Taranata’s teaching of the same tantra follows a similar pattern. He informs us that Taranata’s system uses the framework TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 568TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5686/14/10 3:52:01 PM6/14/10 3:52:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 569of the three continuities—the basis of being, the spiritual path, and the result—and he lists the main points in each subject. Nevertheless, when the tantra itself is broached, we read only, “the second chapter up to half-way through the fi ft ieth chapter provides a full explanation” concerning which Kongtrul adds that this full explanation runs the gamut from, “a presentation of the master’s qualifi cations to the burnt off ering rite for the activity of magnetizing.” Clearly, Kongtrul did not intend to give his readership the same glimpse into this tantra as he did for Matrix of Mys-tery. Th is holds true as well for the next tantra, Vajra of Delight. Aft er tracing the Indian origins and the Tibetan reception of this central tan-tra, Kongtrul gives scant details as he informs us how the tantra is taught. To give an example, under the heading of the tantra’s general meaning, he tells us:Th e second [continuity of techniques] has [fi ft y-three teach-ings]: ten on stages of conduct, four on stages of the view, four on uncommon stages, seven for the highest stages, eleven on the main part of the path, twelve stages in the temporary re-sults, and fi ve branches in the ultimate result.To be fair, Kongtrul himself wrote a massive commentary to the Vajra of Delight Tantra, and he could assume that whoever read Th e Treasury of Knowledge in its original was well equipped to fi nd, read, and compre-hend the many Indian and Tibetan commentaries available to them. Of course, we do not have such resources. Two translations of the Vajra of Delight Tantra have been published in English, and only recently a single translation of the Supreme Bliss Tantra has appeared. As fortunate as we are to have those works, they can be regarded as valuable steps on the way to full translations of the commentaries to these tantras, for such treatises’ framing and interpretations can be extraordinarily helpful for our appre-ciation of the texts of the original tantras.Under the heading of the second family among mother tantra deities, the family of permanence, Kongtrul includes Mahamaya, Four Seats, Buddha Skull, and “the sovereign horse family,” presumably Horse Neck (Tibetan: Tamdrin, tra mgrin; Sanskrit: Hayagriva). In the midst of brief overviews of their lineages, Kongtrul writes these lines, perhaps only per-taining to the family of permanence at the time he wrote them, but rel-evant to all lineages today:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 569TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5696/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"570 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeIn brief, through the kindness of those translators, the empow-erments, teachings, and profound instructions for meditation of many tantras spread for a long time, and due to that, count-less accomplished masters appeared. Nevertheless, the strand of the transmission of their teachings and practice is extremely tenuous. Th erefore, I ask those who care about the doctrine to apply themselves with great eff ort to preserve these transmis-sions with as much diligence as they are able.In the fi nal section on the mother tantras, the Vajrasattva fam-ily, we fi nd the Wheel of Time (Tibetan: Dukor, dus ’khor; Sanskrit: Kalachakra), perhaps the most recognized name of a Buddhist tantra in modern times, due to the tireless activity of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the late Kalu Rinpoché. Among the many traditions of the Wheel of Time, Kongtrul states,[T]he main Wheel of Time traditions are the Dro tradition, heirs to the practice of experiential cultivation; and the Ra tra-dition, heirs of the tantra’s teaching. Th e Dro practice tradi-tion appears to be transmitted through the Jonang lineage; the Ra teaching tradition, through the Zhalu lineage.When Kalu Rinpoché would give the Wheel of Time empowerment, he drew mainly from the Dro and Jonang traditions, whereas the Dalai Lama’s transmission is grounded in the Ra and Zhalu lineages.When Kongtrul fi nished the account of the transmission lineages, he turned once again to the Wheel of Time Tantra itself, this time present-ing how the teaching of the tantra is given. He names the tantra’s fi ve chapters and shows how thirty-two summaries and eighty-one points are woven through those chapters. Th ese numbers are not random, since they immediately suggest the thirty-two marks and the eighty-one signs of physical perfection that manifest on the body of a sublime emanation of enlightenment. Kongtrul explains this idiosyncratic use of the terms “points” and “summaries” in this way:As to the meaning of “summaries,” just as many small measures are contained in a larger measure, these summaries contain many confl uences of words and meanings. As to “points,” just TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 570TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5706/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 571as a large measure contains many small measures, these points contain various separate words and meanings.Th e fi rst chapter’s ten summaries are said to be the pure form of the “powerful ten-letter mantra” which is the primary emblem of the Wheel of Time. It is described in Systems of Buddhist Tantra, pp. 197–200. Kong-trul’s last sentence on the subject of the Wheel of Time, “In brief, the outer, inner, and alternative Wheels of Time are summarized as the sub-jects to be presented, then taught,” refers to the Wheel of Time as the outer world, the body (inner), and the wisdom deity (alternative), a fram-ing terminolog y unique to the Wheel of Time tantras.Th e Early TantrasTh e next section introduces the teaching transmission of the early trans-lations’ tantras. Th e Tibetan text calls these tantras “old” or “ancient” as opposed to the “new” tantras just described. Although these desig-nations obviously work for Tibetans, for us to call translations which began to be produced in the vicinity of 1042 “new” seems unreasonable, particularly if that appellation causes other translations done roughly two hundred years before to be labeled “ancient” or “old.” I have taken the liberty to replace those terms with another pair of words oft en used in Tibetan to name the same translation periods: early and later. On the other hand, I have not tampered with the name of the Nyingma or Ancient Tradition for various reasons, including that as we saw above, it traces its lineages of transmission back before the dawn of human time in this world.Kongtrul begins by remarking how rich in tantras Tibet became dur-ing the early translation period: “countless empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions appeared [during the early period].” Th en he makes an observation that explains the split in Tibetan education between the fi rst four subjects of study mentioned in this chapter, and tantra:[S]ecret mantra was zealously kept secret during that time: monastic colleges stressed the way of philosophical systems, while meditation centers emphasized the secret mantra way. Th erefore, it seems that no college curriculums included [any tantras] apart from a few outer tantras, and none of the three inner tantras.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 571TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5716/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"572 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e three inner tantras mentioned here are the highest three classes of tan-tra in the Ancient Tradition system—mahayoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga.To this day, the curricula of most monastic colleges is weighted heavily in studies of the code of monastic discipline, Th e Treasury of Observed Phenomena, the perfection of sublime insight, and the middle way view, with possible branch studies in such fi elds as Sanskrit and Tibetan lan-guages, and logic. As Kongtrul states, in times past, the subject of tan-tra was not broached at all in such settings, and even now, most colleges reserve general tantric studies for the last year or two of a very long pro-gram. One notable exception to that rule is the college founded and directed by the late Khenpo Jikmé Puntsok Rinpoché of Sertak, Sichuan Province, China. He blended serious study of all subjects, especially the tantras, and tantric meditation practice over a multi-year program, and the results have been spectacular.In this section, Kongtrul focuses entirely on one of the early tantras, Th e Secret Essence Tantra, which he considers to tower above all others. As he did with the later tantras, he traces the Indian lineage, the early his-tory of its acceptance in Tibet, and the development of Tibetan teaching transmissions. Kongtrul touches on the condemnation of early tantras that was common on the part of some adherents of the later tantras, but he restricts the story to one episode that had a relatively happy ending :Later, when scholars of the later tantras denied [the valid-ity of Th e Secret Essence Tantra], Chomden Rikpé Raldri ob-tained the actual Sanskrit text that had belonged to Master Padmasambhava, and asked Translator Tarpa Nyima Gyaltsen to translate it. Chomden Rikpé Raldri composed Adorning Flowers for “Th e Secret Essence Tantra” and other texts, and spread this teaching. From then on, even academic logicians could not dispute [this tantra’s validity].When Kongtrul turns to Th e Secret Essence Tantra itself, he again eluci-dates not the content of the tantra, but the diff erent ways it has tradition-ally been taught. Although it might seem that his generous explanation of Matrix of Mystery Tantra is evidence of favoritism of the later tantras, in fact that tantra is a unique bridge shared by both early and later tantric schools. As he wrote in that previous section to prove that it was not exclusively a later tantra:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 572TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5726/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 573During Buddhism’s early spread in Tibet, [a translator] named Ché Tashi translated this tantra, and it was known among the eighteen major tantras as Th e Matrix of Mystery Mind Tantra. Teachings that elucidated it appeared, as the appearance of Vajrahasa’s tradition illustrates.Buddhism Betrayed by TimeIn what he calls a supplementary section, Kongtrul provides a short account of the teaching transmissions that had lasted until his time. He states that in the category of fundamental Buddhist instruction, “teaching systems for many major and minor scriptures appeared in the past” but that by the time of his writing, the mid-nineteenth century, “only reading transmissions for their root texts and some commentaries still remain, yet it appears that individual masters teach them based on their own powers of explanation.” While this remark may seem obvious and neutral to us, for Kongtrul and for his readership it must have been tinged with sad-ness. Buddhists yearn to read our sacred literature through the eyes of realized masters of the past, unadulterated by new ideas and concepts, no matter how brilliant. We make room for the exigencies of teaching basic Buddhism to each new generation, yet when each individual practitioner becomes suffi ciently mature in their study and meditation practice to turn from expedient teachings to immersion in the timeless wisdom of Bud-dhism’s source texts, we hope to be accompanied and guided by beings of timeless realization. Hence most Tibetan Buddhist masters’ emphasis on preservation of their traditions of sacred teachings and meditations, and not on new inventive methods. Kongtrul’s quote of Taranata’s sixteenth-century injunction in a previous chapter sums up our still-prevalent mood: “Do not delight in the talk of later generations! Scholars of the past were accomplished masters. Modern scholars are frauds.”On the subject of the surviving tantric teaching transmissions, Kong-trul did not do the math for his own time but cites that of an author-ity who lived fi ve hundred years before him: Translator Gö Zhönnu Pal (1392–1481), who wrote a famous history, Th e Blue Annals in 1476. Kong-trul states:. . . in his time, teaching transmissions existed for forty-one texts of tantra.

His disciples, including Upa Losal Sang yé Büm, continued his ac-tivity with great diligence, such as writing out the volumes. Further, Butön Rinchen Drup made a very detailed classifi ca-tion and a catalogue [of these collections].Th is massive work of compilation, organization, and editing began with Chomden Rikpé Raldri during the mid-thirteenth century. Butön Rinchen Drup (1290–1364) gave the collections their lasting form. Kong-trul does not mention here that each of these two great masters consid-ered parts of the collections spurious. For Chomden Rikpé Raldri, Th e Wheel of Time Tantra was unacceptable as Buddhist teaching, whereas (as mentioned above) he deemed valid Th e Secret Essence Tantra and pre-sumably other early tantras. Butön had the opposite opinion, and it was he who had the fi nal word, as the early tantras and their commentaries were excluded from his edition of the collections. Kongtrul agreed with neither exclusion: he accepted both Th e Wheel of Time Tantra and the early tantras as perfectly authentic.Yogins and ScholarsKongtrul ends this chapter with a summary and some cogent remarks concerning his own tradition, that of the Marpa Doctrinal Lineage.To begin, he names “the ten foremost pillars who raised the teach-ing transmissions” over the course of the Tibetan assimilation of Indian Buddhism. Th e fi rst is Tonmi Sambhota, the inventor of Tibetan writ-ten language. Six are translators, four of them participants in the early translations. Th ree, of whom one lived in the early period, are those who received and preserved the transmissions of teaching. Of them all, Kong-trul states:TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 574TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5746/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 575In the dark land of the northern country of Tibet, they were like the sun, able to illuminate the Buddha’s doctrine and thereby further Buddha Shakyamuni’s activity. Th eir kindness cannot be measured, even by the bounds of space.Th is chapter has delineated the arrival and spread of teaching transmis-sions in Tibet; the next chapter will do the same for lineages of medita-tion practice. Kongtrul describes them all as organic lineages that have lived and survived, or died, on their own, whereas in fact they became aligned with monastic institutions and colleges, alignments that could well determine a specifi c transmission’s fate. Here, Kongtrul fi nally men-tions the four major monastic groupings in Tibet, and how teaching and meditation practice fared in their institutions:From the time that separate sects diverged during the doctrine’s later spread, each had transmissions of both teaching and med-itation practice, yet it seems that the teaching doctrines were mainly inherited by the Sakya and Géden [i.e., Gélukpa] or-ders, whereas the doctrines of lineages of meditation practice were mainly inherited by the Kag yu and Nyingma orders.Th is statement allows Kongtrul to segue into a discussion of his own tra-dition, that of the Marpa Doctrinal Lineage in general, and the Karma Kag yu in particular. He credits the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé (1284–1339) with a transformative vision that still guides the lineage:Omniscient Rangjung Gyalwa [the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé] appeared in this world, and mainly emphasized the teaching doctrines of Th e Profound Inner Meaning, Th e Two Chapters of the Vajra of Delight Tantra, and Th e Highest Continuity.Th e Karmapa was responding to his followers who “purely upheld Lord Milarepa’s practice lineage and diligently devoted themselves exclu-sively to meditation practice” to the point of setting aside the teaching and study of pre-tantric subjects. Instead of calling for meditators to leave their cushions and enter college, Rangjung Dorjé entreated them to read and study just these three texts, which as Kongtrul states, “are suffi cient in themselves for arriving at a fi nal conclusion in the course TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 575TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5756/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"576 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeof study and contemplation concerning experiential cultivation of what is to be practiced in meditation; these texts are indispensable for that purpose.”Of the three, Kongtrul says of Th e Profound Inner Meaning, “it is improper for practitioners of the [phase of completion’s] six doctrines to not know this text”; of Th e Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters, “It is vital to know this text at the outset of tantric meditations on the creation and completion phases”; and of Th e Highest Continuity, “it is important to know this text for great seal meditation.” Of them all, he reiterates:Th ese three scriptures are not subjects for academic study or debate; they are teachings to be conjoined with experiential cultivation. Th erefore it is vital above all else that holders of the practice lineage preserve the undiminished teaching trans-mission of these texts.Kongtrul wrote long commentaries to each of these three texts, books which have since become cherished treasures to Kag yu meditators.Somewhat defensively, Kongtrul follows that section with a passage that describes some traces of scholarship within the Karma Kag yu order, specifi cally thanks to the brilliance of the sixth, seventh, and especially the eighth Karmapa. He comments in a hopeful tone that as a result of the Karmapas’ and their close disciples’ writing,although no specifi c [Karma Kag yu] monastic college exists at the present time, its true scholastic tradition continues unbro-ken. Th us, the source of these Karma Kag yu teaching systems is mainly found in the Sakya order, and, within that tradition, in the great Rongtön Shéja Kunzik’s teaching system. Never-theless, it should be understood that the Karma Kag yu later developed its own independent teaching systems.In fact, in modern times the Karma Kag yu has managed to found monas-tic colleges while maintaining and adding to the retreat centers for which it has always been celebrated. Kongtrul ends this chapter with praise for a tradition and a teacher on the opposite end of the teaching-meditation practice spectrum from the Karma Kag yu. Curiously, he mentions two of the teacher’s given names, and lauds him as “[l]ight of Shakyamuni’s TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 576TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5766/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 577doctrine, he was a second Nagarjuna appearing in the Himalayas,” but he does not refer to him with the name we all know so well: Tsongkapa.Chapter Th ree: Th e History of Lineages of Meditation Practicein Tibet, the Eight Major ChariotsWhen Kalu Rinpoché fi rst taught Buddhism outside central Asia, he realized that he was not only a teacher with his own specifi c lessons to impart, he was also an ambassador of Himalayan tantric Buddhism out-side its native lands, the fi rst lama that many ever had the chance to meet. Th us in the 1970s he would include in many public talks an overview of Tibet’s Buddhist landscape, which he summarized in the subject of its four main orders, or sects: Nyingma, Sakya, Kag yu, and Géluk, which he invariably described as equally authentic and viable repositories of Bud-dhist wisdom. By the 1980s, he found that his audience had retained this message only too well: his simplifi ed scheme of Tibet’s spirituality had been turned into solid, restricting categories to which everyone, Rinpo-ché included, could be assigned. For someone who had claimed himself to be “a Buddhist department store: you can fi nd everything you want here,” relegation to the pigeonhole of “Kag yu lama” did not sit well. One memorable day in southeast Asia, his frustration led him to declare in a public talk, “Yes, I’m a Kag yu lama . . . a Nyingma Kag yu lama, a Kad-ampa Kag yu lama . . .” and so on, using the term “Kag yu” not in the sense of a monastic order but in its literal meaning of “doctrinal lineage.” And the series of names he affi xed this term to corresponds to the subject of this chapter—the eight lineages of meditation practice in Tibet. As his translator, I knew what he referred to, but the blank stares of his audi-tors told us they did not, although everyone understood he was trying to change the frame of their understanding of Tibetan Buddhism. It was during the year following that talk that Kalu Rinpoché initiated Th e Trea-sury of Knowledge translation project. I do not mean to suggest that this experience spurred him to encourage translations, but it had become evi-dent to him that his audience in general had matured and needed more information for their perspective on Tibetan Buddhism to grow. Public lectures were not enough to eff ect the change he envisioned.All categories tend to be reductive; look under any of our labels and we fi nd a teeming mass of unstable relations and contradictions, which have just changed, or are about to change, having already become or being in TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 577TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5776/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"578 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgethe process of becoming something other than what we just perceived. “Th e four main orders of Tibetan Buddhism” is no exception. Th e term provides us with the name on the bottle, the producer, but does little to describe the wine. Th e four orders are, simply put, institutions—contain-ers that house diverse scriptural transmissions of the last chapter and the present chapter’s lineages of meditation techniques. Th e institutions were likely founded with the intent to preserve and promote specifi c scriptures and meditations, yet those institutions’ missions invariably evolved over the centuries. For example, while Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, and Milarepa—non-monks all—might view with astonishment the many Kag yu monas-tic networks erected in their name, Gampopa, Dusum Kyenpa, Pamo Drupa, and the others who founded those networks might be equally amazed at their modern content. What a strictly Kag yu practitioner learns today as the lineage’s core curriculum of theory and practice would hardly have been considered kosher in the founding fathers’ day.To identify anyone as affi liated with one of the four orders is fair—we all start somewhere. In Kalu Rinpoché’s case, he joined a Kag yu monastery during his adolescence and he would sometimes add the prefi x “Karma” to his name in veneration of the Karmapa and his lineage. Nevertheless, aft er his early training, his three-year retreat course consisted of mostly non-Karma Kag yu meditations, and in his post-retreat-graduate period of education and meditation, he seems to have treated Tibetan Buddhism as a self-serve buff et from which he slowly but surely tried and savored just about everything. Some of us had the impression that at some point he reached the end of the path, about which he was fond of saying, “Th ere is no such thing as a Nyingma, Sakya, Kag yu, or Géluk enlightenment, just enlightenment.” He worked tirelessly to give back to the institutions, mainly Kag yu, that had given him so much over the years, but he found it tiresome and limiting to be regarded as a Kag yu Buddha, even among a stellar group of other equally misidentifi ed Kag yu, Nyingma, Sakya, and Géluk buddhas.Kalu Rinpoché did not live long enough to successfully supplant the “four orders” schema with the eightfold framework of meditation lin-eages that is more helpful in situating us in relation to our spiritual path in Tibetan Buddhism. An institution provides the setting , teachers, and companions that most of us need at the outset of our practice. Yet it is one of the eight lineages of meditation practice that we receive and follow, ideally in stages from the preliminary to the culminant practices. And TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 578TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5786/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 579having fi nished one course, we could then engage in another, and then another, to our heart’s content, without changing our affi liation and loy-alty to the fi rst institution we joined. Kalu Rinpoché remained a lifelong Kag yu lama whose mastery extended to most, if not all, the eight lineages of meditation practice. Like Jamgön Kongtrul before him, he lived as a happy spiritual omnivore, encouraged others to do the same once they had completed one path from start to fi nish, and expected at all times from his followers unfailing respect toward all spiritual traditions, Bud-dhist or non-Buddhist.One signifi cant diff erence between the four-order and eight-lineage approaches is their respective locations: the four orders are centered in the Himalayas; the eight lineages of meditation exist mainly in the spiri-tual masters who embody them, and once you have received instruction in one of the lineages, it only really takes life wherever you sit on a medi-tation cushion or whenever their teachings’ wisdom intrudes upon the fl ow of your daily plans and preoccupations. Further, one cannot assume that monasteries labeled as belonging to a specifi c order will specialize in the teachings we might associate with that order. For example, the senior lamas of Kalu Rinpoché’s “Kag yu” monastery were likely to be most pro-fi cient in the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage, whereas at Bokar Rinpoché’s “Kag yu” monastery, the greatest enthusiasm was reserved for Vajra Yoga, the lineage of meditation instructions related to the Wheel of Time (Kalachakra). Other “Kag yu” monasteries seem to feature a preponder-ance of Ancient Lineage rituals and practices in their programs. Some “Nyingma” groups focus on Severance practices, as do some Kag yus. If the institutions are unpredictable in orientation, the same and more can be said for individuals, whose lifelong dedication to the Buddhist path can be expressed in many diff erent rites, liturgies, and practices.Among “organized religions,” Buddhism is the least organized, but I do not mean to suggest that its Tibetan strain has descended into chaos and anarchy. Yet if one is only armed with the organizing principle of “four orders,” one will soon be confronted with many inconvenient facts of lived faith that are clearly incompatible with that framework. If one instead learns and retains the eight lineage template, everything that may have seemed incongruous and haphazard in Himalayan meditation prac-tice can be understood as part of a larger, coherent system. It is this system that Kongtrul introduces to us here, to the detriment of the four-order scheme, which does not merit a single explicit mention in this chapter.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 579TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5796/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"580 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeTh e four-order scheme can be useful as long as its fi eld of usage is iden-tifi ed and it is wielded gently and mindfully. It is not a precision instru-ment. My personal preference is to mentally adopt the Chinese names for the four Tibetan orders. In the place of our transliterated Tibetan names—Nyingma, Sakya, Kag yu, and Géluk—the Chinese use their own words for the four: red, multicolored, white, and yellow. Th ese terms seem like code, and they are in fact ingenious in that they identify all we can know for sure without further enquiry concerning any specifi c mon-astery: the color of its exterior walls. (To explain “multicolored,” Sakyas paint a single horizontal, multicolored stripe around their buildings.) When I meet a Nyingma, all I can safely assume about her is that she and her spiritual community gather to learn, refl ect, meditate, and worship in a red building ; if Géluk, in a yellow one. Th at system has the virtues of simplicity, ease of use, and accuracy, but I don’t expect it to gain any currency: we are not yet close enough to Tibet to comfortably call things by our own names.Th e Eight ChariotsTh e companion volume to this chapter is entitled Esoteric Instructions, the third chapter of Book Eight of Th e Treasury of Knowledge, translated brilliantly by Sarah Harding. In that book, Kongtrul gives an overview of the esoteric instructions of each lineage. I confess that whether I read it in Tibetan or English, the eff ect is the same: his descriptions of what I have already practiced seem fairly clear, if incredibly concise; the rest remains, well, esoteric. Nevertheless, throughout this chapter, Kongtrul does not pause as he did in the last, to give us a brief tour of the subject in ques-tion. Th at information constitutes the entirety of Esoteric Instructions. Our present chapter consists entirely of history. Sarah Harding wisely included information from this chapter at the outset of each of her book’s chapters. I have not provided any details of the contents of the lineages in this book: any reader curious to learn more can fi nd no better source than Esoteric Instructions, surely a landmark translation in its comprehen-sive scope. Further, I would strongly encourage readers of this chapter to at least read Sarah Harding’s invaluable introduction to that book (pp. 13–48); her elucidation of the eight-lineage system (and related ideas) will prove extremely useful in navigating the information found here, as well as in thinking through its implications.When we look at this chapter, in the title “Th e History of Lineages of Meditation Practice in Tibet, the Eight Major Chariots,” the word “char-TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 580TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5806/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 581iot” stands out. We have to imagine that conveyances, be they vehicles (the yanas), or chariots or carriages in this case, had considerably more allure in India and Tibet than they do in our day. We cannot gauge what resonance they had for readers in Tibet, where vehicles and chariots were generally the stuff of imaginary tales. Do they correspond for us to space-ships or magic carpets? Kongtrul does not help answer that question, for he uses the image in the chapter’s title and introductory paragraphs, does not explain it, and never repeats it. Perhaps “chariot” did not resonate for him either.Th e one complication of the term “major chariot” (Tibetan: “shing ta chen po,” shing rta chen po) is that, as Sarah Harding points out, it is used not only to indicate the conveyance but also the conveyer—the masters at the source of these lineages in Tibet. Th e Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary gives three defi nitions for “shing ta chen po”:1. A large-wheeled chariot; 2. the two masters Nagarjuna and Asanga; 3. the founder in a new custom. Th ere are two of these: the one who inaugurates the chariot’s way and the one who maintains the chariot’s way. Th e fi rst is called the master of the specifi c school; the second is called the chief holder of its lineage. (p. 2844, col. 2)Th erefore, in the text of Th e Treasury of Knowledge above, when Nagar-juna, Asanga, and Anandagarbha were named as major chariot/eers of their respective specialties (the middle way, mind-only, and yoga tantra), I translated the word as “founder.” Here, however, we are stuck with “chariot,” as Kongtrul only refers to the lineages. In another work, a ritual of off ering to the spiritual masters of the eight major lineages of medita-tion practice, he does the opposite, using the same term to instead refer to those lineages’ founders. Harding (op. cit., p. 27 and note 44) provides one list of the eight founders; there are others, and I have seen no two alike. When we read this chapter, it is easy to see why the identities of the founding masters have proved so elusive.Kongtrul lists the eight chariots as follows:1. Ancient Tradition2.

Approach and Accomplishment of the Th ree VajrasTh e Ancient TraditionTh e fi rst of the eight is the Ancient Tradition, “ancient” only because it predates all others in Tibet. Kongtrul uses the same format to intro-duce all eight lineages: fi rst a general overview of the lineage, followed by details of the early history of the lines of transmission within it.In relation to the Ancient Tradition, conventional wisdom states that Guru Rinpoché (here referred to as Padmakara) stands alone at the source, yet here we read that there are six distinct lines, each stretching back to India or outside of common space and time. Kongtrul lists Guru Rinpoché fi rst among them, but in terms of teachings rather than his activity’s impact, he is just fi rst among equals. In fact, when we exam-ine Kongtrul’s account of the early masters of this tradition, we discover that most of their teachings were concealed as treasures, to be revealed at later, more propitious dates. On the subject of Padmakara’s teachings, for instance, he states:[Guru Rinpoché] saw that there were not the circumstances nor was there the need to transmit most of his profound in-structions for meditation during that period, and considered the infi nite numbers of beings of the future. In the country’s four directions and in its central region, he sealed [his instruc-tions] with seven levels of seals and concealed them in ten million treasure sites with names, illustrated by the fi ve great treasures sites, and in innumerable unnamed ones.Kongtrul revisits the subject of the treasures in the fi nal section on the Ancient Tradition. In the section titled, “Th e Transmission from Ma Rinchen Chok, Nyak Jnana Kumara, and Others,” Kongtrul makes an aside that reminds us of more traditional histories: he takes a paragraph to discuss family lines, mentioning in passing,Most of the sublime individuals who became translators of the later translations were born within the hereditary lines of the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 582TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5826/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 583Ancient Tradition’s series of accomplished masters and aware-ness holders.It seems clear that Kongtrul could have traced Tibet’s masters’ family lines for us—certainly most, including Kongtrul, include their personal family history in their autobiographies—but he chose not to in this book. His version of history fl oats at a safe distance above the mundane.On the subject of the treasures, Kongtrul mentions that there are eigh-teen kinds, and that Guru Rinpoché’s disciples’ reincarnations retrieved them at the right time over the centuries to the present day. In the fi nal section, he mentions three among Guru Rinpoché’s disciples—“the king, [the king’s] subject, and [Guru Rinpoché’s] companion”—who would be King Trisong Déutsen, Bérotsana, and Yeshé Tsog yal. Th e identities of the middle three of the fi ve mentioned earlier in much the same way—“the king, [the king’s three] subjects, and [Guru Rinpoché’s] companion”—are more diffi cult to identify. In one instance, the famous collection of supplications called Th e Seven Chapters, the three subjects are Namké Nyingpo, Dorjé Dujom, and Prince Mutri Tsépo, yet it is highly unlikely that every mention of “the king’s three subjects” would refer to those same three.At the end of the section on the Ancient Tradition, Kongtrul reminds us that these lineages of teachings comprise tantric teachings above all, and that despite what he said earlier—that the presence of Buddhism in any land must be measured by the practice of monastic discipline—such might not always be the case:Th e chief masters of their teachings, along with their lineage-holding disciples, preserve the sacred teachings during the darkest of evil times. Even in places where the doctrines of scriptures on monastic discipline no longer exist, the secret mantra vajra way does not vanish into fragments, but spreads and fl ourishes. Its wide-reaching, continual activity liberates every being who is diffi cult to guide.If we look back now over this fi rst of the eight lineages, we can easily appraise the fl imsiness of such constructs as group indicators—Ancient Tradition, etc.—when we read just the briefest examination of them. A dizzying number of threads are seen to have some interrelation and are therefore categorized as “a lineage,” yet each separate line of transmission TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 583TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5836/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"584 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeboasts of masters who received, held, and practiced a distinct thread and who assert that it alone led them to extraordinary attainments, such as a body of light. Kongtrul’s organizing principle for the Ancient Tradi-tion is a general set of teachings that provide the theoretical and practi-cal basis for the tradition (he never once mentions institutions in this case), yet one would be hard-pressed to fi nd any institution where those texts and practices formed a curriculum. In our time, we can meet well-trained, dedicated, and deeply spiritual people who are immersed in, for example, the wide-ranging and bountiful collections called the Chokling New Treasures or the Dujom New Treasures with little or no knowledge of or relation to the texts or teachings Kongtrul names as the basis of the tradition. Further, if we were to compare even the two modern systems just named, we would fi nd that they do not share the same rituals, music styles, dances, and meditation practices. We could observe that the bud-dhas and bodhisattvas these systems produce seem similar, but the same could be said of the happy graduates of any tantric system.Among the masters of the Ancient Tradition, Kongtrul mentioned one whose life was foretold in a great perfection tantra, and who as predicted spread both the inherited lineage and his own wisdom mind treasures to the ocean’s shores (presumably China’s Pacifi c coast). He refers to this master simply as the incarnate master Rangjung Dorjé, leaving it to the reader to guess that this is none other than the third Karmapa. Kongtrul will again mention him as having contributed to the Marpa Doctrinal Lineage, Severance, and Approach and Accomplishment of the Th ree Vajras; in chapters Two and Four as well, he cites Rangjung Dorjé as an important authority in Vajra Yoga. To see Rangjung Dorjé (hierarch of the Karma Kag yu monastic order) and so many others solely through the lens of their institutional responsibilities, and to make assumptions based on that view, is self-defeating. For Tibetans, a question akin to “Is the Pope Catholic?” within their own context may not be simply rhetorical and may not be easily answered.Buddha’s Word as InstructionTh e second chariot is that of Buddha’s Word as Instruction, known as Kadam in Tibetan. I owe this translation to Elio Guarisco; it seems to capture the fl avor of the original as well as the spirit of the lineage itself.Kongtrul’s description of the lineage begins with the details of the line originating with Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa, the translator who invited Atisha to Tibet and who studied with the great master for nineteen TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 584TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5846/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 585years. Kongtrul ends his root text with a hanging “yet,” which hints at what in fact transpired: the main lineage passed through someone else—Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné. We read of the spread of the lineage far and wide, and even of some institutions established in its name. But the main thrust of this section is an accounting of the lineage’s dissolution, for it disappeared entirely, its teachings’ streams fl owing into and merging with other rivers. As I’ve remarked elsewhere:Th e spiritual masters of the Buddha’s Word as Instruction Lineage are remembered for their unfl inching self-exami-nation and scrupulous honesty. Th ey dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to spiritual life. One of their famous sayings advises:Turn your innermost attention to the teachings.Once you have embraced spiritual life, live as a beggar.In living as a beggar, decide to die as one.When dying, do so without companions.Leave human society.Join the ranks of dogs.Attain the rank of an enlightened one.Th is sort of attitude won the lineage universal respect and admiration, but few adherents. Its practice centers withered and its teachings found new, more opulent homes in other monastic systems. (Jamgön Kongtrul’s Retreat Manual, p. 80)Th e Kag yu order inherited the lineage’s meditation practice, while both the meditation and teaching systems served as the basis for what Kong-trul calls both “the new Buddha’s Word as Instruction” tradition and “the Géden [tradition].” Th e latter refers to what we now call the Géluk order. I recall Dézhung Rinpoché always saying “Géden” rather than “Géluk”; I do not know if “Géluk” is a recent appellation, nor what if any connota-tion either name has, or if “Géluk” is simply a contraction of “Géden-luk” (literally, the tradition of the virtuous). Kongtrul gives a succinct over-view of the mixed fate of this lineage:During that [early] period, spiritual mentors who held this tradition fi lled the land of Tibet, and their monastic sites spread far and wide throughout eastern and central Tibet. As TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 585TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5856/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"586 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgea result, their gradual path’s instructions, such as four thoughts which turn the mind away [from the wheel of life], appear at the beginning of all teaching systems of the later and early tra-ditions, for example, and pervade every spiritual order in the Himalayas. Yet later, when it seemed that institutions that pre-served this tradition’s own systems were becoming somewhat eclipsed, there appeared Lord Manjushri’s magical manifesta-tion with irrefutable supreme knowledge and masterful com-passion; like a Buddha appearing in this world, he was known as Tsongkapa Lozang Drakpé Pal.All Himalayan Buddhists revere the early masters of this lineage, and their teaching methods have had a lasting impact in every school. Th ey were the earth to the Ancient Tradition’s heaven—they made elemen-tary Buddhism accessible with plain and practical teaching manuals and methods that helped ordinary people take their fi rst steps on the path. For example, in Marpa’s Doctrinal Lineage, Milarepa did not teach the ABC’s of Buddhism or meditation practice; his main disciple, Gampopa, who had trained in the Buddha’s Word as Instruction lineage prior to meeting Milarepa, opened up the lineage teachings to all by initiating a two-track system: one gradual and one direct. Gampopa’s popular mas-terwork, Th e Jewel Ornament of Liberation, gives an excellent example of the gradual path for those who needed a more gentle entry into Buddhist practice. He imported this style of instruction from the Buddha’s Word as Instruction lineage and it proved tremendously useful. Th e Words of My Perfect Teacher, a must-read manual of the preliminary practices of one Ancient Tradition lineage, also follows the format fi rst designed by the early masters of this lineage.Th e Path with the ResultKongtrul’s account of the third chariot, the Path with the Result, is far more substantial than the last. Th e central Tibetan fi gure who received this lineage and fi rst brought it to Tibet was Drokmi Shakya Yeshé, whose name should be better known than it is. As Kongtrul remarks:In general, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, Gö Kukpa Lhétsé, and Drokmi Shakya Yeshé are the three sources of secret mantra vajra way’s later spread [in Tibet]. In particular, both Marpa TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 586TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5866/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 587and Gö initially trained with Drokmi, who was remarkably exalted.Th e reader’s eye is also drawn to the statement in the section’s fi rst sen-tence: “Drokmi Shakya Yeshé had eighteen [outstanding ] disciples: seven—three men and four women—who gained accomplishment.” Kongtrul names neither the men nor the women (Tömo Dorjétso, Rémo Köné, Shapmo Chamchik, and Chémo Namka Yeshé), but it comes as some relief to have another gender mentioned in this book. In the same section, another remarkable woman is named as a lineage holder—here referred to as Machik Zhama Naljorma. Her personal name was Machik Gyalmo (1062–1149; she was a contemporary of the renowned Machik Labdrön [1031–1129], and also met Padampa Sang yé). She and other women gained prominence due to their outstanding qualities and real-ization in a time before gender-exclusive monasteries held sway in Tibet.At the time of this book’s publication in English, the Path with the Result is unique among all eight lineages in that its core instructions are all translated and easily available. Th e book, Taking the Result as the Path: Core Teachings of the Sakya Lamdré Tradition, in a splendid translation by Cyrus Stearns, is accompanied by a foreword from His Holiness Sakya Trizin, a living Buddha and head of the Sakya order. Longer stories of most of the masters we read about in this section can be found in that book (pp. 127–284), which I highly recommend. I also urge any reader to read attentively Stearns’ Note to the Reader (p. xvii) which states in part:Most of the texts translated in this book are of an esoteric na-ture. Traditionally, they have been studied and practiced in Tibet only by people who have received the teachings of the Path with the Result. Four of the texts . . . are appropriate for anyone to read and study without preparation.He goes on to name the criteria for reading and studying the remaining parts of the book. Although I eagerly bought the book soon aft er its pub-lication, I have followed Stearns’ advice and restricted my reading as he directs, for I believe what he says,For, according to tradition, good results cannot come from study and practice of Vajrayana teachings unless the student TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 587TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5876/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"588 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgehas fi rst received the initiations and careful guidance that can only be received from a living master. (ibid., p. xvii)My own experience with Tibetan Buddhism is somewhat mixed: I have studied and practiced it since I turned eighteen, when I took refuge. On the one hand, if I’m honest about my inner spiritual growth, I seem to have squandered all that time and eff ort. On the other hand, as the sort of person who doesn’t oft en peer within, I’m happy to the degree I remain blissfully ignorant. But regardless of my inner state, when I’ve sat at the feet of Buddhist masters, I fi nd it best to let them lead, for them to open up new vistas as they see fi t, and for their words to have full impact, which can be severely muffl ed when we encounter them having already read their manuals and anticipating the content and progress of their instruction. In Tibetan, and now in English, we try not to read ahead of our teachers. We try instead to trust them and to allow ourselves to be supple, and surprised.Th e lamas of the Path with the Result have in fact consistently sur-prised me, none more than a khenpo, a scholar, who lived in Ghoom, a village close to our translation house in the Darjeeling hills. Some transla-tors visited him and asked questions to help our reading of Th e Treasury, which apparently bemused him—the fact that we were translating it, that is. He passed away some time later, and we attended his cremation aft er it became known that he spent well over a week in a state of suspended animation aft er his death, in what is known as the fi nal meditation. He had passed away—his heart and lungs had stopped—but his body did not exhibit signs of death—pallor, stiff ness of skin, decay, etc. (Kalu Rinpoché spent three days in such a state at his death.) He fi nally exhibited signs of having completed his meditation, and his corpse was cremated. A couple of days later, we stopped by his monastery as his disciples dismantled the pyre structure: it contained his remains, including pieces of bone embed-ded with the most luminous gem-like pills. Th ese were his “relics,” of which I had read but had never witnessed, and they were unlike anything I have ever seen. His disciples sift ed through the ashes and came upon these gems in fi ve brilliant colors, some seemingly emerging from the bone frag-ments while still part of them, most were separate. Th e relics were col-lected and later placed within a reliquary stupa at that monastery.I have faith in all eight “chariots” and try to extend my respect and devotion equally among them, yet by some happy chance, the lamas—men and women—and the lay practitioners—man and women—of the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 588TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5886/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 589Path with the Result lineage that I have met have all appeared to me to have remarkable integrity and humility. Th is lineage has done little to draw attention to itself, either at home in Asia or elsewhere, which makes me believe the lamas and their disciples are fully occupied in study and practice.Th e Marpa Doctrinal LineageTh e next two chariots have oft en been mistaken for a single lineage or institution since their Tibetan names end in “Kag yu,” and they have shared history in India as well as Tibet, as a Tibetan saying has it: “Naropa and Niguma were husband and wife in India, and remain companions in Tibet.” However, the Marpa Doctrinal Lineage and the Shangpa Doctri-nal Lineage are defi nitely two totally distinct lineages, separate-but-equal members of the eight lineages.In Kongtrul’s introduction to the Marpa Doctrinal Lineage, he con-sistently names the Indian founder as Télopa rather than the common Tilopa, and he describes him as someone more dedicated to the spiritual path than to social conventions. Th e same could be said for the other masters of this lineage until the fi ft h in the line, Gampopa, whose train-ing as a doctor perhaps guided him to establish institutions that were of practical spiritual benefi t for all Tibetans, and to gather around him-self like-minded disciples whose systems of monasteries still thrive in the Himalayas. Kongtrul does not comment upon that shift explicitly, but we notice that his account until the end of the section “Réchungpa’s Doctri-nal Lineage” does not include any word of institutions having been built by those outstanding masters. Th en, mid-way through the next section, “Th e Dakpo Doctrinal Lineage Tradition,” we realize that Kongtrul no longer informs us of new teachings or doctrinal lineages, but of disciples’ skill in presenting received teachings and in founding institutions.In the midst of lauding Gampopa, Kongtrul comments on his teaching method and helps us to understand how the lineage and the teachings became diluted, or at least changed from a single track to a two-track sys-tem, allowing less zealous disciples access to at least the name of the prime teachings the lineage has to off er. Of Gampopa, he writes:To his ordinary disciples, he taught the stages of the path from the tradition of Buddha’s Word as Instruction and the meditative states of the discourse system adorned with the name of great seal. To his uncommon disciples, he taught the TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 589TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5896/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"590 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge extraordinary great seal of secret mantra related to his spiritual master Milarepa’s path of skillful means.

As one commentator (Sakya Pandita) remarked:[Great Seal’s] realization will be attained in this very lifeif one is skilled in the techniques of Mantra.Besides this, the Buddha did not teachthe realization of the Great Seal otherwise.Th us if one is interested in the Great Seal,one should practice in accord with Mantra Vehicle texts. (A Clear Diff erentiation of the Th ree Codes, p. 117; brackets added)He goes on to cite the sources of Marpa’s Doctrinal Lineage in defense of his objections to the innovations that Gampopa and his followers introduced:Th e Great Seal that Naro and Maitripa espousedis held to consist preciselyof the seals of Action, Dharma, and Pledge,and of the Great Seal as expoundedin tantras of the Mantra system.In his Caturmudra, exalted Nagarjuna himself also asserts this:“If, through having not known the Action seal,one is also ignorant of the seal of Dharma,it is impossible that one might understandeven the name of Great Seal.” (ibid., p. 119)Kongtrul was well aware of these and other objections concerning the Dakpo Kag yu style of teaching great seal “light” based in the discourses, and he knew of the spirited refutations Kag yu teachers wrote in reply. Th is was (and remains) contentious, a sore point. Nevertheless, he wrote TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 590TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5906/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 591those two remarkable sentences without further commentary, perhaps to jolt drowsy readers to full alert. On the subject of such objections raised over the centuries, Dujom Rinpoché sagely comments, “If all the doctrines refuted by learned and accomplished Tibetans were false, no authentic doctrine at all would be found.” (Th e Nyingma School, p. 929)Th e Shangpa Doctrinal LineageWhen it is said that Naropa and Niguma remain companions in Tibet, this refers to the fact that lineage bearers of one set of teachings have oft en practiced the other as well. Th e second Tibetan in the Shangpa Doctri-nal Lineage, Rinchen Tsöndru, received instruction from Gampopa, and members of the Karma Kag yu order have repaid the compliment over generations, as Kongtrul reports:Th e fourth Karmapa, Dzamling Rolpé Dorjé, made the doc-trines from the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage the heart of his meditation practice and his teaching. Since his day, the series of omniscient Karmapas have consistently upheld and sus-tained the Dakpo Kag yu and the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage together. (Spiritual Life, p. 96a)When we examine the list of the foremost Shangpa masters of each generation, we oft en discover individuals better known as the heads of monasteries or whole orders of monasteries. For instance, Kongtrul men-tions here the central place Tangtong Gyalpo occupies in the Shangpa lineage, yet when we read his incredible biography (King of the Empty Plain, translated by Cyrus Stearns), the part of his active life occupied by the Shangpa teachings is barely perceptible. Th e same can be said for Kunga Drolchok and Taranata, two towering fi gures of the Shangpa lin-eage whose contribution to the lineage was made entirely in writing and in teaching. Kongtrul mentions in this short history how a few masters founded some monasteries; what he doesn’t mention is that those insti-tutions either gradually faded or changed affi liation. No edict prevents Shangpa masters from creating Shangpa institutions, but no one has tried to do so for many centuries.Shang is a place name; as Kongtrul relates in this chapter, the fi rst Tibetan of the lineage, Kyungpo Naljor, “established his monastic seat at Zhang Zhong, in Tsang Yéru Shang ; thus he became known as Lama TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 591TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5916/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"592 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeShang and the holders of his lineage, the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage.” His chosen spiritual heir, Rinchen Tsöndru, simply walked away from the monastery that gave its name to the lineage he held. Neither he nor most of the later lineage holders even visited that mother institution, let alone directed it. Th eir attitude was not born of any recorded confl ict with that Shangpa monastery or even of disaff ection with groups or monasteries per se—some led their own large circles of disciples (such as Kalu Rinpo-ché or Bokar Rinpoché in the last century). We cannot hope to explain why some realized beings attract and seem to thrive in the midst of real estate and leadership responsibilities while other equally impressive saints seem allergic to them, but the Shangpa lineage, a faith without a church, is not unique: the last four of the eight chariots are alike in that way. Th e Shangpa, Pacifi cation of Suff ering and Severance, Vajra Yoga, and Approach and Accomplishment of the Th ree Vajras are all purely lineages of meditation instruction.Pacifi cation of Suff ering and SeverancePacifi cation of Suff ering is a label that covers the enormous range of instructions given by Padampa Sang yé in the course of his fi ve visits to Tibet made during a lifetime said to be fi ve hundred and seventy years long. While in Tibet, he “saw each individual’s exact character and capa-bilities, and to each he gave corresponding profound meditation instruc-tions that led to liberation.” Practically speaking , this meant that “his teaching did not belong to one specifi c scripture or system . . . he drew destined beings, as many as the number of stars in the heavens, to the state of enlightenment.” Padampa Sang yé was an accomplished master on a par with the other greats of India, and like them, he was a unique individual, an enlightened nonconformist. His lineage, the Pacifi cation of Suff er-ing, never met its Gampopa, someone who could systematize and bring order to the wealth of the teachings. Kongtrul mentions Rok Sherab Ö (1166–1244) as the master in whom all lines of Pacifi cation of Suff er-ing converged, but although he was an omniscient master according to Kongtrul, it fell to one of his reincarnations (who also mainly practiced the Ancient Tradition), great Translator Dharmashri (1654–1718), to save the teachings from extinction:In later times, as this lineage’s thread became increasingly thin, the patterns [of a former life as] the omniscient master Rok Sherab Ö awakened in the great translator of Mindrol Ling TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 592TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5926/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 593Monastery, Dharmashri. With great diligence, he received the streams of this lineage’s [empowerments for] spiritual ripening and [its instructions for] liberation, and composed texts and rituals for its empowerments and practical guidelines. Due to his kindness in teaching and spreading this lineage, even today, a bridge rope to this tradition continues unbroken.Curiously, this sort of gradual dissolution was not shared by Pacifi ca-tion of Suff ering’s sister lineage, Severance. Kongtrul calls this a branch tradition of Pacifi cation of Suff ering, yet if that is so, it seems to have far outgrown the central trunk. We read here of Severance lineages galore, and never a hint of any line diminishing, although Kongtrul has much more to report concerning the female than the male system of Severance. Th is is no doubt due to the central fi gure of Machik Labdrön (1031–1129), who succeeded in establishing her lineage of meditation practice against all odds. Not only was she of an uncommon gender in her line of work, but her practice was demanding, anything but staid, and not anchored in institutions. Somehow she managed to become the sort of authority fi gure whose approbation Kongtrul mentions in this book as character references for the Karmapa and Tsongkapa! He writes:Further, Machik Lapdrön clearly predicted that for as long as Shakyamuni’s doctrine endures, no one comparable to the sov-ereign Karmapa and this holy individual will appear.In addition, Machik has not become a unique but distant fi gure’s disem-bodied voice without spiritual progeny or a modern presence:Since Severance is a profound technique, its enlightened activ-ity in these and other ways is amazing : it has become wide-spread, fi lling the entire Himalayan region. Until the present, all spiritual masters regardless of their original tradition cul-tivate its experience, and it continues to be indispensable for subduing external and internal conditions that are diffi cult to subdue by other means.We can get a clear picture of this enormously charismatic female buddha, and of her teaching style, from a compilation of her teachings entitled Machik’s Complete Explanation, translated by Sarah Harding.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 593TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5936/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"594 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeVajra YogaIn his fi rst list of the eight chariots at the beginning of this chapter, Kong-trul calls number seven “Six Applications,” whereas he later refers to it only as Vajra Yoga. Both Six Applications and Vajra Yoga can be used as names for this lineage, although the six applications are located in the instructions as the phase of completion, as Kongtrul here states to iden-tify the lineage:All extensive root tantras . . . unanimously teach the phase of completion. Th e essence of them all is the sixfold application, related to the three vajras’ yoga.To call this lineage Six Applications is akin to referring to Marpa’s Doc-trinal Lineage as the six doctrines of Naropa, which is neither correct nor incorrect. Th e eight chariots exist only in retrospect; even the name of the fi rst “ancient” tradition surely came into being in response to the arrival of newer lineages in Tibet. What had once been revolutionary and challeng-ing became “old” and perhaps somewhat respectable and dependable by comparison. It would be hard for us to fi nd a single text before Kongtrul’s time with the words “Marpa’s Doctrinal Lineage” in the title; Padampa Sang yé’s disciples probably had no sense of themselves as belonging to a lineage called Pacifi cation of Suff ering. In this case, Vajra Yoga seems the more inclusive term for the lineage, although the name may have a relatively recent provenance.In previous sections, we have encountered lineages with a single easily identifi able fi gure who incarnates the lineage and its history. For Vajra Yoga, Kongtrul mentions eleven occasions when the teachings arrived in the Himalayas from India, and seventeen ensuing traditions. Th e fi rst translator and master who brought Th e Wheel of Time Tantra to Tibet, Gyijo Dawé Özer, had an impact far beyond the confi nes of his own teaching transmission: the entire nation has set its calendar to the year of his return home with the tantra, 1027, as the start of its fi rst sixty-year cycle.Among the seventeen traditions, Kongtrul singles out the tradition of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen and Taranata as the foremost masters in the transmission of this lineage of meditation practice, and we fi nd Dol-popa memorialized as the central fi gure in some representations of the Vajra Yoga lineage.

Th e fi nal one of the eight, Org yen Rinchen Pal (1230–1309), is by far the latest but his life story has not yet been translated, although it should be. He was a disciple of Götsangpa and the second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi, and the teacher to the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé. As Kongtrul mentions, he traveled to India’s sacred places just before the end of Buddhism there (he repaired the stupa at Bodhgaya, site of the Buddha’s enlightenment, in 1261), and brought back the last major lineage of meditation practice, Approach and Accomplishment of the Th ree Vajras.He was unique among the founders of these eight lineages in an odd way for a region later so dominated by monks: if we take Guru Rinpoché, Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné, Drokmi Shakya Yeshé, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, Kyungpo Naljor, Padampa Sang yé (and Machik Lapdrön), Gyijo Dawé Özer, and Org yen Rinchen Pal as the nine leaders (I have chosen Tibet-ans when the candidate is obvious), only the last was a monk, and even he received his lineage instructions from Vajra Yogini, who fi rst presented herself to him in the guise of a prostitute. Among the nine, Kyungpo Naljor took monastic ordination but later said he considered Sukasiddhi the kindest of all his teachers in part because she had accepted him as her partner in sexual practice.Kongtrul has very little to say about the Approach and Accomplish-ment of the Th ree Vajras’ lineage, but the mere fact of its inclusion in this group is useful for the preservation of the lineage in that attention is drawn to it. Further, as Sarah Harding notes:[T]his very arrangement—that of displaying all the lineage teachings side by side, equal but separate and distinct—is a signifi cant methodolog y in itself. . . [E]xposure to the vast array of techniques virtually forces one to accept that they are more or less the same, and therefore all equally valid Bud-dhist teachings.

Each tradition is profound and brilliant in its own right, once it is glimpsed. It must be seen to be believed.

(Esoteric Instructions, pp. 24, 34)Th e Eight Lineages in Time and a PlaceTh e rich era of the originators of six of the eight lineages (not counting the Ancient Tradition and the last lineage) ended with the passing away of Kyungpo Naljor in 1127 and Machik Lapdrön in 1129, two exception-ally long-lived individuals. Th is period of innovation began with Atisha’s arrival in Tibet in 1042—thus the six main “new” lineages of meditation practice were established in Tibet during a mere eighty-seven-year span. When we speak of tantric meditation practice in Himalayan Buddhism nine hundred years aft er Machik, we still refer only to these eight. Here is how Kongtrul thought aloud in 1864 concerning the eight lineages and the programs at two retreat centers affi liated with the monastery where he lived. It is a testament to the longevity of the eight lineages and to the unusual care Kongtrul took to ensure their vitality.I have created a positive connection to the profound tantric creation and completion phase meditations for the residents of the two retreat centers [at Palpung Monastery] by intro-ducing them to the general styles of all eight lineages of medi-tation practice, except that of the Path with the Result. Th e profound instructions of this particular tradition are diffi cult to teach and practice properly with so much else on the pro-gram. But because one half of the Himalayan region is fi lled with upholders of its tradition, I feel reassured that it can be absent from the programs of the retreats.For some time now the program of the large retreat cen-ter has focused on the profound and extensive creation and completion phase meditations of Marpa’s Doctrinal Lineage, and the practice of Severance. I have established the custom of supplementing this program with the ripening and liberating TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 596TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5966/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 597practices of the Pacifi cation of Suff ering. Here in this retreat center [Tsadra Rinchen Drak], we maintain the traditions of the entire cycle of meditations from the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage; Vajra Yoga’s six branches of application, [supple-mented by instruction in] Approach and Accomplishment of the Th ree Vajras; and the inner heart of the Ancient Tradi-tion, great completion, along with its inner secret, the Heart Essence practices. In both retreat centers, [a manual written by Taranata entitled] Th e Stages of the Path of the Th ree Types of Individuals [a core text of the Buddha’s Word as Instruction Lineage] forms the basis for the preliminary practices. [Be-tween these two centers, then,] seven [of the eight] systems [of meditation practice] are fully represented. (Spiritual Life, p. 97a, b)Chapter Four: A History of Buddhist CultureWherever we live where Buddhism has become established, we wit-ness how secular cultures borrow from Buddhism, be it in the domains of thought or language, or in art or sculpture. Further, quasi-Buddhist notions of karma, emptiness, past and future lives, states aft er death, etc., turn up in incongruous settings, sometimes with fanciful twists, be they deliberate or not. Buddhists should not begrudge this appropriation of our spiritual property, for as we see in this chapter, Buddhists have long adopted large swaths of secular culture, relocated them in our spiritual context, and made them irretrievably our own. Th e temptation has been overpowering : someone has given up all thoughts of themselves and has had a positive impact on the lives of others—they must be a buddha or bodhisattva in disguise! Some thing or some idea or some fi eld of human endeavor lightens the burden of beings’ suff erings or opens their minds to new horizons and awakenings—it must be Buddhist! So it is that we have such a thing as Buddhist culture that accompanies our Buddhist spiritual path: it was too hard to resist.But is Buddhist culture really Buddhism? Kongtrul jumps right into this chapter’s fi rst subject, Sanskrit grammar, and into stories of its ori-gins among the otherwise Hindu gods without a word of explanation of how we have moved from classic Buddhism—sacred texts and spiritual TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 597TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5976/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"598 \u0002 the treasury of knowledge realization, teaching and study, and meditation practice—to grammar, medicine, sculpture, astrolog y, and the like. Close to the end of the chap-ter, he catches his breath and avers, somewhat sheepishly it seems to me:Th ese fi elds of culture do not actually belong within the teach-ings’ three cycles. Th e principal activity through which the Buddhas establish their disciples in freedom and omniscience is the sequential teaching of the three ways and the four tan-tras. Th ey turn the amazing, exceptional wheel of teachings that do not share [the values of ] worldly individuals, and they do not emphasize worldly treatises in their doctrine. Th ere-fore, the victors taught none of the basic texts of these fi elds of culture.Could this be a Tibetan predicament, shared with other lands where the Buddha’s enlightenment was introduced along with radically new forms of cultural enlightenment? As we read in this chapter, the mod-ern Tibetan script and grammar were developed late, and under Bud-dhist auspices. Even when spiritually agnostic, Tibet’s intelligentsia likely regarded their southern neighbor as Mother India.Modern Buddhists do not share that Buddhism-as-mother experience on a cultural level. We more resemble the Chinese, who had a vibrant, well-developed culture before Buddhism arrived so that its cultural appendages became merely parts of an already rich mosaic. We may regard the sub-jects of this chapter with sincere curiosity, but they remain curios, things rare and unusual from elsewhere, from which we might glean some useful insights but which we would not consider adopting in the place of our native cultures. One can love Buddhist culture without being attracted to Buddhism as a personal faith, and one can be a devout Buddhist without feeling any personal affi nity for its cultural fl owerings. Does every Japa-nese Buddhist feel compelled to learn fl ower arranging, archery, fencing, calligraphy, or tea service? For Tibetans, however, the subjects we fi nd here were not regarded as optional Buddhist hobbies; even if one didn’t have the opportunity or acumen to learn them, one respected them as the heart of one’s culture, how the world made sense. Kongtrul defends the inclusion of the study of Buddhist culture in this way:[T]here is not the slightest thing the buddhas do not see or know; therefore, when the time has come to train a being TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 598TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 5986/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 599through one of these fi elds of culture, they do so by giving a teaching (describing the subject’s causes, examples, nature, and semantics), the meaning of which no one else would be ca-pable of knowing. Th is is a special quality of a Buddha.Since most of the Buddha’s excellent speech exists in San-skrit, one should have a good knowledge of Sanskrit grammar to understand it without error. Likewise, understanding these branches of culture is indispensable. Th erefore, the learned have greatly elaborated upon them.Kongtrul himself numbered among the learned who greatly elaborated on these subjects. He was a Tibetan renaissance man, someone fully cul-tivated in virtually every subject in his day and age. We imagine he wrote with an exclusively Tibetan readership in mind; when he writes here that “understanding these branches of culture is indispensable,” we must remember that he knew his readers had two stark choices—to broaden their minds, a choice that obliged them to study some subject of Buddhist culture presented here, or not. “How Buddhist Monastic Discipline and Scriptural Transmissions Came to Tibet” (Chapter Two of Book Four) presented Buddhist higher education; we fi nd here secular higher educa-tion as it existed in Tibet—available mainly (but not entirely exclusively) at Buddhist monasteries, and mainly (but not exclusively) for monks.Th is chapter begins with a section entitled “Th e Major Fields of Culture,” in which we read histories of studies of Sanskrit, logic, sacred art, and medicine. Th e only words of introduction are these:What are known as fi elds of culture, studied and learned by non-Buddhists and Buddhists of all philosophical persuasions alike, are of two kinds: major and minor. From the Buddhist perspective, the former are said to be the fi v e major fi elds of culture . . . [emphasis added]Th e fi ft h major fi eld of culture never mentioned in this chapter is that of Buddhist studies, more than adequately covered in “How Buddhist Monastic Discipline and Scriptural Transmissions Came to Tibet.”In one part of the survey of Sanskrit studies, we are told of a great scholar referred to as Dharmakara, and soon thereaft er in a description of another system of Sanskrit grammar, we read of Chökyi Nangwa.

Kongtrul will cite him as a lead-ing authority in most of the major and minor forms of Buddhist culture, albeit under various names: Tsuklak Chökyi Nangwa, the great omni-scient master, Chökyi Jungné, Dharmakara, Chökyi Nangwa, Tenzin Chökyi Nyima, Tenpé Nyinjé, and the all-knowing lord. Kongtrul was a disciple of the ninth Tai Situpa, and was obviously deeply impressed by his lama’s predecessor. We can learn more of this master in a book that is essential reading for Western Buddhist scholars, Among Tibetan Texts, by E. Gene Smith, in the chapter “Th e Diaries of Si tu Pan chen” (pp. 87–96). Here is how Kongtrul introduced this master in the previous chapter, under the heading of Marpa’s Doctrinal Lineage:In the past, groups of Kag yu masters fi lled the breadth of the Land of Jambu and lesser continents, yet later only a semblance of Buddha’s doctrine in general remained, and the doctrine of the precious lineage of meditation practice in particular was setting over the western mountains. At that time, Marpa the Translator, [the wisdom deity] Vajra of Delight incarnate, in-tentionally arose as a manifestation of wisdom, Karma Tenpé Nyinjé Tsuklak Chökyi Nangwa (commonly known as Tai Situ, omniscient Chökyi Jungné). Th e great light of his wis-dom, love, and power shone forth, nurturing the vitality of the doctrine of meditation practice.Kongtrul makes clear at the outset of the section on art that he only intends to describe sacred Buddhist art (I wonder whether any Tibetans before the modern era ever studied the history of non-religious art in Tibet):All fi elds of art can be gathered into physical, verbal, or men-tal arts. What I will describe here is principally art produced physically and, among all artistic endeavors, that which pro-vides both immediate and long-term inexhaustible aid and pleasure: representations of wisdom form, wisdom speech, and wisdom mind related to the Th ree Jewels.We note that Kongtrul attributes to the Buddha himself a shift from art as sacred supports to nurture faith and devotion of Buddhists to art TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 600TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 6006/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 601as helpful for the doctrine, even to convert non-believers: “Later, when our teacher was about to transcend sorrow, he ordered, ‘Make representa-tive images of my body in order that the teachings endure and to convert Hindus.’”Kongtrul ends the section on art as he began it, underlining that he considers only sacred art pertinent to this book:Most physical, verbal, or mental activities, such as the eighteen branches of art, are commonly taught to be included within the fi eld of art. Th eir minor histories are diffi cult to research; I have not related them here as it would serve no purpose.In this chapter, the subject he covers in the most detail is medicine. He begins with a disclaimer:In fact, Buddhist tantric texts widely refute the Vedas’ lasting validity. Nevertheless, in this chapter dealing with the com-mon subjects of culture, I accept the view of Shura and other Buddhist masters, and present unchanged what is known in the Vedas’ source texts.At each new subject in this chapter before medicine, Kongtrul has simi-larly drawn on non-Buddhist sources to recount the oft en charming his-tories of diverse forms of human culture. Th e enduring beauty of Sanskrit, logic, and sacred art may be in the eyes, ears, and mind of the beholder, but the beholder does not have to be Buddhist to be transported by them. On the subject of medicine, Buddhist masters seem to have concluded that skill in healing is not the sole purview of Buddhist doctors.Th e main name to take away from this section is Yutok Yönten Gönpo (1127–1203), always the foremost name in Tibetan medical history. Slightly before him, Drapa Ngönshé (1012–1090) was a treasure revealer who lived during the high tide of the later lineages of meditation practice described in the last chapter. It was he who revealed the treasure of Th e Four Medical Tantras, the transmission of which passed through Yutok Yönten Gönpo. Whereas most treasures’ retrieval times are unrecorded, it seems appropriate for medical texts to have a specifi c birth place, date, and time: the medical tantras—quadruplets—came into the world, deliv-ered from the vase pillar of the middle storey of the innermost shrine at TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 601TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 6016/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"602 \u0002 the treasury of knowledgeSamyé Monastery, on Wednesday, July 19, 1038, at approximately 1:12 AM (this according to Th e Nyingma School, p. 753).Of the four minor fi elds of culture, the fi rst presented here is astrolog y, which the Tibetans inherited from both India and China. Under the head-ing of stellar astrolog y, two diff erent systems developed in Tibet, which means that the national Buddhist holidays are sometimes celebrated in unison throughout the Tibetan community, and sometimes with a whole month diff erence between them. Th is includes the all-important New Year festival. Tibetan calendars now sold in foreign countries may or may not specify which system they are based upon; one could easily discover that one’s calendar is diff erent from that of one’s Tibetan neighbor.Although everyone watches a calendar for the arrival of celebrations, not all Tibetans, be they lamas or laypersons, believe in astrolog y. Aft er all, this is a form of Buddhist culture, which does not necessarily intrude into a Buddhist’s spiritual life any more than would poetry, metrical com-position, or lexicography, the last three aspects of Buddhist culture that Kongtrul mentions. Th eater should be included as one of the fi ve minor fi elds of culture, but Kongtrul admits, “Since theater was not useful in Tibet, its treatises were not translated.”Within Th e Treasury of Knowledge, the companion volume to this chapter on the history of Buddhist culture is the fi rst chapter of Book Six, “A Presentation of the Common Fields of Knowledge and Worldly Paths,” where Kongtrul describes the subjects themselves. Even just translating the history of these subjects has been extremely challenging and I have been helped in this chapter’s every domain by Dr. Peter Alan Roberts, without whom the translation would have proved impossible. Th e forthcoming translation of “A Presentation of the Common Fields of Knowledge and Worldly Paths” is many degrees more daunting, and I eagerly await its arrival from an incredibly knowledgeable translator, Gyurmé Dorjé.Kongtrul ends this chapter with a short description of the journey of Buddhism elsewhere in the region, although with the exception of China, we would be hard pressed to locate on our maps the lands he mentions. Shambhala is said to thrive in this world, but is invisible to most of us; Khotan is a city state in western China that long ago per-ished; and while Kongtrul states that Dravida still existed in his day and that Buddhism had lasted, I have not found anyone willing to affi rm its modern identity.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 602TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 6026/14/10 3:52:02 PM6/14/10 3:52:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"translator's postscript \u0003 603Th is concludes Kongtrul’s survey of Buddhist culture as it was. He alluded to eighteen diff erent arts and craft s, which include metal working , leather work, incense manufacture, and even preparation of alcohol. In Tibet, all of these would have shown some evidence of Buddhist infl uence, or have been entirely at the service of Buddhist institutions and practitioners. In our modern day, Buddhist teachers from the Himalayas are opening up new horizons in Buddhist culture, bringing Buddhist sensibilities to new domains, such as cinema, or encouraging new Buddhists to see how their post-meditative experience can be enriched by applying mindfulness to such missions as stewardship of the planet and its environment. Pure Tibetan Buddhism, that which is meticulously preserved through study and teaching , and meditation practice, opens unexpected and unlimited inner space, yet its basic recipes have not changed for around a thousand years. Applied Buddhism—how Buddhist sensibilities are refl ected in its attendant cultural expressions—can unfold in unexpected and unlimited ways, its many-splendored display forever evolving.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 603TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 6036/14/10 3:52:03 PM6/14/10 3:52:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 604TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 6046/14/10 3:52:03 PM6/14/10 3:52:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"BibliographyA true and complete bibliography for this text would be overwhelming.

Th e list of their names can be found here, followed by the way their names appeared in the original Tibetan text. I have not supplied any “Wylie” transcription: my impression is that this style of writing Tibetan will soon go the way of the fl oppy disk—something that was incredibly useful at the time but has since become outmoded. Further, it has proved impossible to use the Wylie scheme to accurately reconstruct Sanskrit names written in Tibetan, something that seems important for this book.Kongtrul gives no information concerning dates throughout these chap-ters and I have not supplemented his work with the latest information on chronolog y according to modern scholarship. In reading Kongtrul we are left with the impression that events of countless lifetimes and eons past, and the events and personages of mere centuries ago or even yesterday, occupy the same historical space. To wander in that space unmoored by references to our calendars is how Buddhists read and integrate our history—the Bud-dha, Nagarjuna, Padmasambhava, Atisha, Butön, Longchenpa, and so many other wisdom beings down to our day have escaped conventional time. To label them as having been alive in another era, centuries ago, is natural for us as modern readers, but this refl exive distancing is counterproductive for us as Buddhists. Nevertheless, this is not the main reason I have not supplied dates here.In the young fi eld of Tibetan historical studies, there is no single reliable source for birth and death dates of historical fi gures. Some dates become accepted then change—for instance, Kongtrul probably passed away in 1900 rather than in 1899, as we had long assumed. Provide a date for the early kings of Tibet and I will show you authoritative sources that locate the persons in question a century or more before or aft er what you propose.

Without knowledge of the original sources of the infor-mation that appears in other reference works, I am reluctant to repeat dates for the lives of our Tibetan and Indian Buddhist ancestors named in this reference work. If Kongtrul had supplied even a single date, I would have been delighted to write it below. I regret very much that he did not.It may seem obvious that where Kongtrul usually wrote the names of Indian personages in Tibetan, I translated them back into Sanskrit, which is how they appear in the text and in the list below. While this refl ects a com-mon decision these days, Buddhist translators of the past have come to the opposite conclusion and translated most of the original Sanskrit names into new languages; thus, the Tibetans say “Lu-drup” where we and he would say “Nagarjuna.” Christians as well are used to their important fi gures sport-ing names in their own languages: we anglophones feel comfortable with Saint “James,” as opposed to the French equivalent “Jacques,” or the Span-ish “Diego,” or whatever the man himself would have answered to some 2,000 years ago. Tibetans enjoy the same linguistic familiarity with their Tibetan-named Indian spiritual heroes. I fi nd it interesting to consider fol-lowing in the footsteps of the great translators of the past, who had good reasons to make the saints of yore less foreign, but as one colleague, Dr. Peter Alan Roberts, wisely remarked to me long ago, Th e Treasury of Knowledge is hardly the appropriate place for such experiments.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 610TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 6106/14/10

beings, both holy and mundane, whose only common characteristic is the fact that they are not human beings. We fi nd among them denizens of hell, animals, and gods, as well as wisdom deities, buddhas, and bodhisattvas.Where possible, I have translated these names into English. Years ago, I asked three Kag yu masters their opinions concerning the translations of names, and I received three diff erent answers. All three seem per-fectly reasonable to me, yet I had to make a choice. Dabzang Rinpoché believed every name should be rendered in its language of origin, which he explained meant that deities’ names should appear in Sanskrit. Trangu Rinpoché quoted from memory directives given to the fi rst Tibetan translators, telling them to translate everything they could—names included—into Tibetan. Tai Situpa, whose advice I followed in the end, advised to keep human beings’ names as the individuals in question had known them, but to translate into English (when possible) names of dei-ties, buddhas, and bodhisattvas, as they belong to us all.You will fi nd here the names as they appear in translation, followed by how they appeared in the original text.TOK 2-3-4 Interior_FINAL.indd 633TOK

following texts were mentioned by Kongtrul in Th e Treasury of Knowledge: Books Two, Th ree, and Four. You will fi nd the title as it appears in the translation, followed by the words in Tibetan Kongtrul used to refer to the text, rather than its more formal, long title. Th is is followed by the author, and in the case of works among the collections of the Bud-dha’s words (Kang yur) and Indian Buddhist works (Teng yur) in Tibetan translation, a number preceded by either a K in the case of the Buddha’s word or a T, to indicate the book’s placement among the classics.All such numbers coincide with the texts’ location within the Dergé editions of those collections, except when the K or T is preceded by a P, to signal that the book in question is found within the Beijing editions. Scholars who wish to fi nd the complete Tibetan and Sanskrit title of a text can enter the number into the search function at http://web.otani.ac.jp/cri/twrp/tibdate/Peking_online_search to glean that and more information. My impression is that native Chinese speakers who might read this book far outnumber Sanskritists; alas, I do not know of a web-site where one could similarly get one’s bearings in the midst of English, Tibetan, and Chinese translations of Buddhism’s holy texts.My reasoning in recording here Kongtrul’s nicknames for texts is to help those wanting to enquire further with living Tibetan-speaking teachers, who will likely be more familiar with the short name of a book than its formal title. Further, since Kongtrul (like other Tibetan authors) gives us only the fl imsiest hints of what text he refers to at any point, it seems helpful to divulge the stepping-off point for any possibly faulty conclusion. For the same reason, I have tried to limit my designation of locations of any text in the collections of Buddhist scriptures to those that seem highly likely.
